<h2><a id="chap1" name="chap1">I. A MODERN SPORTSMAN</a></h2>
<p class="first">It was a gala night at the National Opera House, and the
theatre was crammed from floor to roof, for Melba was sustaining a new part,
and all London had gathered to listen. It was rarely indeed that so fashionable
an audience assembled in February. The boxes were ablaze with diamonds. On the
grand tier, however, there was one box which was not filled with gaily garbed
women and which attracted attention by the fact that its sole occupants were a
girl and two men. Though she was quietly dressed and wore no ornaments except
flowers, nevertheless a good many women envied May Haredale; for the box
belonged to Raymond Copley, who was quite the last thing in the way of South
African millionaires. He was a youngish, smart-looking Englishman of the florid
type, was becoming known as a sportsman and, according to all accounts, was
fabulously rich. He was supposed to have discovered diamonds in Rhodesia, a
stroke of fortune which put him in a position, it was alleged, practically, to
dictate terms to the De Beers Company, and those "in the know" in the City
declared he had come out of a negotiation for amalgamation with two millions of
money in his pocket.</p>
<p>Be that as it may, he had purchased a fine old estate within twenty miles of
London, and lavished large sums upon his racing stud, and people began to court
his acquaintance. He was on very friendly terms with his near neighbour, Sir
George Haredale, of Haredale Park, which accounted for the fact that the
Baronet and his only daughter were availing themselves of Copley's hospitality
that evening.</p>
<p>May Haredale ought to have been enjoying herself. She did not have many
opportunities for pleasures of this kind, for, sooth to say, Sir George
Haredale was a poor man. He had a constant struggle to keep up appearances, and
most of his friends wondered how he managed to pay the expenses of his racing
stable. But the Haredales had been kings of the turf for a hundred years or
more, and Sir George clung desperately to this last vestige of the family
greatness. The whole estate was going to rack and ruin, the gardens and grounds
were neglected, the conservatories were empty, the carpets and old furniture
were faded and worn. But the stables left nothing to be desired. How near they
were to the verge of collapse only Sir George himself knew.</p>
<p>He had few rich and influential friends. He did not care for moneyed men, as
a rule, and so the old county families were surprised to see the intimacy that
had grown up between him and Raymond Copley. They professed not to understand
it, but one or two shrewd observers declared that May Haredale was at the
bottom of it, and that Copley was over head and ears in love with the girl.</p>
<p>It would have been strange were it otherwise. She was just the sort of girl
to attract a man like Copley. She was tall, well formed and exceedingly pretty,
though cold and haughty at the mere suggestion of a liberty.</p>
<p>What she thought of Copley she had never been heard to say. She had not many
friends in her own circle. She was perfectly happy and contented so long as she
had a good horse and the promise of a day with the hounds. Most people deemed
her rather distant and reserved, but a few hinted that May Haredale could be
chummy enough when she chose. Others, however, had noticed a great change in
the girl during the past two years. There was a time when she had been one of
the merriest madcaps, and then, all at once, she seemed to grow up and become
staid and dignified. And it was not altogether the weight of family trouble
which bore her down, for, as a matter of fact, she had no idea how desperate
Sir George's fortunes were.</p>
<p>She appeared on friendly terms with Copley, but, though for the past twelve
months he had been a familiar visitor at Haredale Park, he did not think that
he was making much progress in her good graces. Clever as he was, the girl
managed to keep him at a distance without wounding his pride, and as time went
on he found himself more and more infatuated with May Haredale.</p>
<p>He belonged to the class of man who never counts the cost of anything and is
ready to go any lengths in the pursuit of a fancy. He thought he had been
extremely patient, and told himself earlier in the evening that before the week
was out things would have to be settled one way or the other. And he was not
without weapons, either. Sir George could have unfolded a tale in that respect
had he chosen to do so. The Baronet was proud, but there are times when pride
has to take a second place, and such a crisis in his affairs had arrived. May
would have been surprised to learn that Copley could at any moment sell the old
home over their heads and turn them out to shift as best they might.</p>
<p>She sat with her face on her hand, looking at the stage, but she was not
listening to Melba's marvellous voice. Her mind had gone back to a somewhat
similar scene two years ago when she was last in the same opera house. How
different things had seemed then! How much happier she had been in those days!
She roused herself presently to find that Copley was addressing her.</p>
<p>"Oh, I beg pardon," she said. "I suppose the singing carried me away. What
were you saying?"</p>
<p>Copley uttered something appropriate. There was a hard look in his eyes as
he took in the details of May's fresh beauty. She was just the wife for him.
She had a fine appearance and good breeding and would take him into certain
houses the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> of which had as yet been denied him. They were
going on afterwards to supper at the Carlton, and before he slept that night
Copley would know his fate; indeed, he knew it already. He had a kind of
instinct that May disliked him. But that, after all, was a small matter. When
she learned the truth there would be no alternative. That her dislike might
turn into hatred mattered nothing to Copley. He bent down already with an air
of possession which brought a faint flush into May's cheeks. She was feeling
rebellious.</p>
<p>"You are enjoying it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. I should be a strange creature if I didn't. I have so few treats
like this."</p>
<p>"Isn't that your own fault?" Copley returned. "Surely, you must know that if
you only liked to say the word&mdash;"</p>
<p>A sudden outburst of applause drowned the rest of his speech, but to all
intents May heard everything that he had to say. She blamed herself that she
had not shown this man earlier that her feelings towards him were merely
conventional. And now she would have to make up her mind one way or the other.
Copley stood with a smile upon his face, evidently very sure of his ground. A
longing to get away, to be alone with herself, came over May Haredale. In a way
she was grateful to Copley for saying no more. She was glad when the
performance was over and they began to move towards the stairs. Here a stranger
bustled up and touched Copley on the arm. As he turned to the intruder his face
changed. May thought he looked almost alarmed, but it was a trifle and she only
noticed it vaguely. The recollection was to come back to her later.</p>
<p>"One moment, Sir George," Copley said. "Would you mind waiting for me in the
vestibule? It is a little business affair which won't detain me five
minutes."</p>
<p>Sir George passed on with his daughter, leaving the two men together. Copley
turned sharply round upon his companion.</p>
<p>"Now what is it?" he asked curtly.</p>
<p>"Oh, I thought you would like to know," the other said. "I only got back
last night. The first man I met this morning in the City was Aaron
Phillips."</p>
<p>"You don't mean that," Copley exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I do, indeed. It is a thousand pities I haven't managed to find you before
to-day. I have been chasing you from place to place in the most maddening
fashion. However, Phillips is here, and so I thought I would come and warn you.
No, no, I have made no mistake."</p>
<p>"But the thing is impossible, Foster. You know as well as I do that Phillips
was killed&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, so we imagined. Anyway, the beggar's back again, and there's no
getting away from it. And if he is allowed to talk, and we don't square
him&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Square him! Why, it would cost half a million!"</p>
<p>"Well, suppose it does. Won't it be cheap at the price? Wouldn't it be
better for us to plank that money down than be standing in&mdash;but you know
what I mean. It's a most infernal piece of ill luck, but, after all, your
position is by no means a bad one. You go everywhere, you are eagerly sought
after. Besides, who is to know whether you are a millionaire or a pauper?
You've got the reputation of being a rich man, and with brains like
yours&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I can't stop now," Copley said hurriedly. "I have some people supping with
me at the Carlton, and it is impossible to put them off."</p>
<p>The other man grinned.</p>
<p>"I understand," he said. "I guessed who the lady was. I'll come round to
your rooms at half-past twelve or a quarter to one, and then we can talk the
thing over quietly. You can see for yourself that the matter won't keep."</p>
<h2><a id="chap2" name="chap2">II. AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</a></h2>
<p class="first">Meanwhile, Sir George and his daughter were waiting
impatiently for Copley. As they stood, the fashionable stream hurried by them.
The road outside was crammed with cabs and 'buses and motors, for all the
theatres were discharging their audiences. The street was one seething mass
when Copley joined his friends. They pressed together towards the pavement, and
Copley could scarcely conceal his annoyance that his car was not in attendance.
He supposed there was some misunderstanding and suggested that it would save
time if they took a cab.</p>
<p>"We might have some difficulty in getting two cabs," he said. "One of us had
better walk."</p>
<p>"I'll walk," Sir George answered. "I haven't had any exercise to-day, and it
will give me an appetite for supper."</p>
<p>May looked up vaguely alarmed. She had no fancy for a drive to the Carlton
in the company of Raymond Copley.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it be better to walk along till we come to the end of the street?"
she proposed. "There would be more chance of getting a cab when we are out of
the crush."</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply she stepped on to the pavement. In his
aggressive way Copley elbowed a clear path. The road seemed to be fuller than
ever of vehicles. Then there rose the quick cry of a woman's voice, the sound
of clashing metal, and before any one could realize it two motors had
overturned. Instantly all was confusion, and five minutes later May found
herself on the other side of the street alone and presenting a somewhat
conspicuous figure in her evening dress and cloak.</p>
<p>She was not frightened or alarmed. She had too much pluck and courage for
that. She thought the best thing would be to turn down this dark side street
and make her way to the Haymarket.</p>
<p>She walked quietly and fearlessly along, the road getting narrower as she
went. She passed one or two men who made audible remarks upon her appearance,
but she did not heed them. And, then, almost before she knew what had happened,
a man by her side began to pester her with remarks which brought the blood
flaming to her face. That the nighthawk was not sober did not tend to improve
the situation.</p>
<p>She looked about for some one to appeal to, and with sudden thankfulness
heard steps hurrying behind. Next moment she saw her tormentor lying on his
back in the gutter with another man standing over him.</p>
<p>"I am glad to be of assistance to you," the stranger said. "If you will
allow me to walk with you as far as the corner of the street I will call a cab.
I suppose you got separated from your party and this fellow followed you."</p>
<p>"That is so," May replied. "I cannot sufficiently thank you."</p>
<p>She paused in the midst of her speech, for her rescuer's face was shining
out clear and distinct in the lamplight. At the same instant the stranger
turned and their eyes met.</p>
<p>"Harry," the girl murmured, "Harry!"</p>
<p>"Well, yes," the stranger laughed awkwardly. "This is rather an unexpected
meeting, isn't it?"</p>
<p>May made no reply at the moment. She was studying her companion intently.
She noticed how white his handsome face was. There was the suspicion of
suffering in his eyes. His dress was neat, but worn and shabby, and yet there
was an unmistakable air about Harry Fielden which proclaimed that he had been
accustomed to better things. He stood half-defiant, half-smiling, and yet he
held up his head as if he had nothing to be ashamed of.</p>
<p>"Where have you been for the last two years?" May asked.</p>
<p>Harry Fielden shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"It would be difficult to tell," he said. "In the first place, I tried
Australia. But things were worse there than they are here. America I could not
stand at any price; then I went to South Africa, where I managed to starve. I
had one slice of fortune, but was cruelly used by a man I trusted. And now, if
it be possible, I am poorer than ever. I am trying to get employment at a stud
farm or racing stable. It is the only thing I really know."</p>
<p>May Haredale listened with trembling lips. Raymond Copley would have been
surprised had he seen the expression on her face. He might have been uneasy,
too.</p>
<p>"I am very sorry," the girl remarked. "Oh, my dear boy, how foolish you have
been! To think what you wasted! To think of that beautiful old house!"</p>
<p>"I try not to think of it," Fielden said. "I was all the fool you took me
for, and worse. It was my misfortune that I had no one to look after me. When I
came into a fine property at the age of twenty-one I had no knowledge of the
world. And every blackguard and sponger who came along I accepted at his own
valuation. Well, it is an old story, May&mdash;a fool and his money are soon
parted. But, thank goodness! I never did anything to be ashamed of. I never
wronged man or woman and I pulled up in time to pay all my debts. There is
nothing left now but the old house, and that I couldn't sell because it is not
worth any one's while to buy it. More for the sake of sentiment than anything
else I have managed to pay my subscriptions to my clubs. I still have the
freedom of Tattersall's and Newmarket, though I have known what it is to sleep
out of doors, but not till this minute did I fully realize what I threw away.
Ah, we were good friends in those days, May."</p>
<p>May Haredale nodded. It was difficult to speak at that moment, for she and
Harry Fielden had been more than friends. They had been brought up together
from childhood, and had been together at many a dance and tennis party and many
a clinking run with the hounds. Nothing had ever passed between them, but it
was a tacit understanding that Fielden and May Haredale would wait for one
another.</p>
<p>When the crash came and Fielden disappeared, May had made no sign, but from
that time she was more sedate and seemed to have left her old life and spirits
behind her.</p>
<p>"I had not forgotten you," she murmured presently. "We must try to do
something for you, Harry. I will speak to father. And then there is Mr. Copley.
He has a fine establishment near us and one of the largest racing stables in
the kingdom. But you don't know him. He is a South African millionaire who has
come into our neighbourhood since your time."</p>
<p>"Oh, I have met some of them," Fielden said grimly. "They don't think so
much of them out there as folk do at home. I fancy I know the name. I wonder if
it is the same Copley I met on the Rand&mdash;but, no, that is out of the
question. So you think he might find me something to do? You don't know what
heartbreaking work it is, seeking occupation and finding none. And I am anxious
to work, goodness knows. I am young and strong, steady and trustworthy, and
there is no man living who knows more about horses than I do. I wonder if you
would mind speaking to this man for me. I've got no pride now. I have had that
knocked out of me. But perhaps you would not like me to come down into the old
neighbourhood again. You might not care for it."</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear boy," May said reproachfully. "How can you talk like that! You
know that there are some friends who were ready to do anything for you. But you
would not give them a chance. You disappeared without so much as saying
good-bye."</p>
<p>"Well, you can understand my feelings," Fielden answered. "However, I've got
to go down to the old place to-morrow, in any case. There are some things in
the house that I need, and I shall hope to meet Joe Raffle. It was very good of
you to take Joe into your service. It was awfully kind of your father to buy
most of my horses. I hope there is a Derby winner amongst them."</p>
<p>"We think so," May exclaimed. "We have great hopes of a Blenheim colt. He
hasn't been seen in public since the Middle Park Plate which he won handsomely
enough. We think he is the best horse we ever had, and people appear to be of
the same opinion. If he doesn't win the Derby I don't know what will become of
us. But get Raffle to take you over to Mallow's to-morrow and he will show you
the colt. It's only a matter of a few hundred yards, as you will recollect,
from our lodge gates to Mallow's stables. Mallow is only a small trainer, but
he suits us and is not expensive. I wish you would stay down for a day or two.
We shall be back to-morrow night, and my father will be disappointed if he
doesn't see you. And now, really&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am sorry," Fielden said. "I have no right to keep you talking here. Come
along and I will get you a cab. And if I can manage to stay at the old place
over to-morrow I will come and see you. How jolly if one of my colts should win
the Derby for Sir George!"</p>
<p>There was a tender smile on May's lips and a dash of colour in her face as
she drove presently to the Carlton. Sir George was waiting with fussy anxiety.
Copley looked disturbed and rather ill-tempered. They accepted May's
explanation. Naturally, they put down her heightened colour and sparkling eyes
to the excitement of her adventure.</p>
<h2><a id="chap3" name="chap3">III. A LIVING FORTUNE</a></h2>
<p class="first">Harry Fielden would have shirked the visit if he could, but
there was nobody whom he could trust to go down to the old home and procure the
papers he required. He was glad to see Herons Dyke again, but, at the same
time, he was half ashamed to meet the old faces. Many would have welcomed him
gladly, but he had made an utter failure of his life, and pride stood in the
way of meeting these acquaintances.</p>
<p>There was nothing left but the house. Long ago the estate had passed into
the hands of strangers. The stables had fallen into decay. The tan track round
the park was overgrown with weeds and grass. He was surprised to find himself
unrecognized. A dozen people passed him with no more than a casual glance. He
had forgotten that two years' "roughing it" had changed him from a handsome boy
into a stern, resolute man, with an expression far beyond his age. Even his
moustache had altered him. It was true that May Haredale had recognized him
readily enough, but that, surely, was different.</p>
<p>He would go as far as Haredale Park Farm and look at the horses. He was all
the more ready to do this, because he felt assured he would pass for a total
stranger. It was possible Joe Raffle might identify him, but, then, the old
head groom had known him ever since he could walk. And now Joe was Sir George
Haredale's trusted right-hand man and had been so for the last eighteen months,
since the death of his predecessor. It had always been a consolation to Fielden
to know that Raffle had gone on to Mallow's, with the stud which had once been
his property. They had not been a very brilliant lot and few of the horses had
ever paid for their keep; but Raffle believed in the Blenheim blood and had
always prophesied that some of the colts would do great things at the proper
time.</p>
<p>Fielden was amused to see the suspicious glances cast at him by more than
one of the lads. Presently Raffle came himself, a short, sturdy man, bent with
age, whitehaired, but with cheeks rosy as a winter apple. He was about to ask
Fielden's business sharply, when his face changed and he led Fielden to one
side. The old man was moved and with difficulty held his voice steady, but his
keen blue eyes gleamed with pleasure.</p>
<p>"I never expected to see this day, Master Harry," he said. "And one of those
lads wanted to order you off the premises. Just think of it! And they told me
you were dead. I met a man in London who said he knew for a fact that you were
drowned in the Modder in South Africa."</p>
<p>Fielden's face grew stern for a moment.</p>
<p>"Your friend wasn't far wrong, Joe," he said grimly. "It was a near thing.
But that is too long a story to tell now. I came down on business, and I don't
know whether I was glad or sorry to find that no one recognized me."</p>
<p>"Miss May would have been glad to see you," Raffle said.</p>
<p>"Oh, we have already met. That was an accident, too. I told her I was coming
to-day, and she gave me a cordial invitation to look at the horses. I couldn't
resist a chance like that. Well, Joe, I hope that Sir George has done better
with the Blenheim stock than I did. I understand he didn't give much for them.
I am told he bought the whole lot, lock, stock and barrel, for a bagatelle. And
now they say there is a Derby winner amongst them. Is that a fact, Joe? Or is
it one of the fairy tales one is always hearing in regard to turf matters?"</p>
<p>Raffle lowered his voice impressively.</p>
<p>"It is no fairy tale, Mr. Harry," he said. "Barring accidents, we are going
to win the Derby this year with a colt locally bred and locally trained. It is
a Blenheim colt, too, and if you hadn't been unfortunate he would have been
yours. He's only once been seen in public yet, and nobody but ourselves knows
what he can do. Still, people will get talking and our horse stands at a short
price in the betting."</p>
<p>"I am glad to hear it," Fielden said heartily. "I am especially glad to hear
it for Sir George's sake. You know almost as much about the family as I do. You
know what Sir George could do with the money. We don't want to gossip, but I
know Sir George is a good master to you and that his interests are yours."</p>
<p>"That's true, Mr. Harry. I'd do anything for Sir George, who has been a rare
good master to me. But he ain't you, sir, and he ain't the old squire, either.
You see, I served under a Fielden from the time I was ten years old till I was
close on seventy, and it was a bit of a wrench leaving Herons Dyke. And when I
heard you were dead, it seemed to me, sir, that I had nothing else left to live
for. I ain't one to show my feelings much, sir, but when I saw you in the yard
just now I could have burst out crying like a kid. You ought never to have gone
away, sir. You ought to have stayed here and faced it out. But, perhaps, you
did well in South Africa. Maybe you have come back with a fortune. I'd like to
hear you say so."</p>
<p>"I think I am rather worse off than when I went out," Fielden smiled. "I had
a fortune in my grasp, but was robbed by a pair of murderous scoundrels, who
will have something to answer for later. And now, take me round and show me the
horses. Let me see this Blenheim colt of which such great things are
expected."</p>
<p>Raffle led the way across the fields to the neat yard along the range of
stables where Mallow trained for a small owner or two. Whatever the condition
of the house and grounds, there was nothing lacking in the stables. They came
at length to a loose box a little apart from the rest, and Raffle stripped the
clothing off a great raking chestnut horse, showing a skin like satin gleaming
in the sunlight. The expression on Raffle's face was almost motherly. His eyes
shone as he laid his hand upon the horse's glossy neck.</p>
<p>"There," he said proudly, "look at that! You are most as good a judge of a
horse as I am, tell me if he doesn't look all the way a Derby winner. Just cast
your eye over those shoulders, look at those quarters. And a real tryer he is,
too, and as good-tempered as a lamb. I always knew we should do great things
some day with one of the Blenheim colts, but I never expected anything quite as
good as this."</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour later the two left the box. So far as Fielden could
see, Raffle had not overestimated the chances of the Blenheim colt. If
everything went well for the next three months, Sir George's fortunes would be
restored and there would be no more poverty at Harefield Park.</p>
<p>Fielden was extravagant in his praise, but there was no answering enthusiasm
upon Raffle's part. He was moody and thoughtful. There was something almost
guilty in the glance that he turned upon Fielden.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" the latter asked.</p>
<p>"No man ever yet did a foolish thing without being found out," Raffle
muttered. "Let's walk across the park where we can be alone, because there is
something I must say to you. If you hadn't turned up yet, Mr. Harry, it would
have been all right, but seeing you have turned up, why, it's all wrong and I
am bound to tell you. When you went away, you left your affairs in a muddle.
There was money coming to you from Weatherby's, though perhaps you didn't know
it, and up to this year they have kept up your subscriptions to one or two
races, the Derby amongst others. Oh, I knew it, and I am going to tell you now
why I kept the knowledge to myself. The year you went away so sudden you
nominated more than one colt for the Derby and, of course, the money was all
right. Well, after you disappeared and they said you was dead, nothing seemed
to matter and I thought no more about things. Sir George took over your 'osses,
and it was only when this Blenheim colt began to shape so well that I began to
ask myself a few questions. It was easy to bamboozle Sir George, because he is
the worst man of business in the world. And I can prove every bit of it, sir; I
can prove every word I am saying. And therefore it comes about that this
Blenheim colt&mdash;this one that's going to win the Derby&mdash;belongs to
you, or at any rate he was nominated in your name, which comes to the same
thing. I daresay you will ask me why I have done this, and why I kept the
secret, and I'll tell you. I really did it for the sake of Miss May. I would do
anything for her, anything to put Sir George on his legs again. You see, I
thought you was dead and out of the way and, after all said and done, I was
doing nobody any harm by keeping my mouth shut. And yet now you have come back
home again I feel a bit of a scoundrel."</p>
<p>"It seems incredible," Fielden exclaimed; "it is a strange discovery for a
pauper to make."</p>
<p>"Well, sir," Raffle said doggedly, "there it is, and this wonderful chance
is entirely in your own hands, pauper or no pauper."</p>
<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">IV. A GREAT TEMPTATION</a></h2>
<p class="first">As yet Fielden could not realize it. The thing was so
unexpected he found it hard to grasp Joe Raffle's meaning. He was too
conventional to have much imagination. He had not thought it possible that
fortune could have devised a method of restoring his old prosperity. But after
the first shock of discovery it seemed feasible. Similar things had happened
before, though, perhaps, not exactly on lines such as these.</p>
<p>And now the position of things as they were at the time he left was coming
back to him. He had a vivid recollection of the night when he first stood face
to face with ruin, when he knew that he had come to the end of his tether. For
Harry Fielden had not drifted into a mess with his eyes shut. He had known that
things were getting desperate and had staked pretty well everything on a
certain race and his horse had lost. When things came to be settled up there
was just enough to pay his creditors in full. He recalled how he sat down one
night with pencil and paper and worked out the whole thing fairly and squarely.
He had had friends to dinner that evening. It was daybreak before the last hand
had been played and Fielden found himself alone to face the dreaded
disaster.</p>
<p>How clearly it all returned to him now! He had not felt disposed to sleep,
but had gone up to his room in the silent house and refreshed himself with a
bath and changed his clothes, after which he had come down to the dining-room
again. He had thrown back the curtains and opened the windows to admit the
sunshine of a perfect day&mdash;the day of his ruin!</p>
<p>But he had done nothing to be ashamed of. He had not disgraced himself, and
no friend or tradesman was the poorer for his rashness. So leaving his affairs
to the family solicitors, he quietly vanished from the scene of his folly.</p>
<p>He did not know then&mdash;indeed, he did not know fully now&mdash;that out
of a sum of money waiting at his banker's his various subscriptions and racing
liabilities were being paid, for it had never occurred to him to withdraw the
various orders he had given to his banker.</p>
<p>Obviously Joe Raffle was speaking the truth as to the Blenheim colt, though
the other part of the business still remained a mystery. But if he could
believe his ears aright, then at that moment he was not an outcast and pauper,
but one of the most envied men who had ever set foot upon a racecourse. At the
lowest estimate, he was worth five thousand pounds. He could sell the Blenheim
colt with all his engagements for such a figure before the day was out. He
might return to the old house and restore some of its glories. He might have
enough to keep him comfortably, and, above all, acquire a position that would
entitle him to go to Sir George Haredale and ask for the hand of his
daughter.</p>
<p>This was all very well from one point of view, but there was another side.
His prosperity would be Sir George's ruin. Still, the temptation was dazzling,
and for a few minutes Fielden was afraid to trust himself to words.</p>
<p>"You have done very wrong, Raffle," he said presently.</p>
<p>Joe scratched his head contritely.</p>
<p>"I know it, sir," he admitted. "I didn't realize how wrong I had behaved
till I saw you come in the stable yard, and you could have knocked me down with
a feather. But what else could I do? You had gone away and I heard you were
dead. I had to believe it, because the man who told me gave me chapter and
verse for it, and I felt as if I had lost a child of my own. By-and-by I was
comfortably settled in Sir George's employ, having as much money as I needed
for my wants, and never, so far as I knew, a single relation in the world. I
said nothing about the colt, because I hadn't much opinion of it at first. Then
I began to get as fond of Miss May as I used to be of you, sir. An idea came to
me one night when I was sitting over my pipe&mdash;and, bear in mind, nobody
else knew&mdash;and that was that, bar accidents, I had a Derby winner in the
stable. For Miss May's sake I was willing to do much. There was no chance of
anybody finding it out. And, after all, I was doing nothing wrong. You see, in
the first place, nobody will be a penny the worse. As to Sir George and
yourself, there is no reason why you shouldn't make a large fortune. It makes
no difference to me, of course; I am long past troubling about that sort of
thing. But now that I know you are alive it is another matter. Still, the
colt's keep hasn't been much, and it's only a matter of luck that he don't
happen to belong to Sir George. Besides, Sir George is expecting to win a
fortune, and he is not the man to grudge you your share. You will have to tell
him what I've told you, sir, and if Sir George wants proofs I shall have them
ready when the time comes."</p>
<p>"Nobody knows anything of this?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>"Not a soul, sir," Raffle said solemnly. "Nobody even guesses it, and if you
hadn't turned up I should have gone down to my grave with the secret unspoken.
Because, as I said before, sir, there's no harm done, and nobody any the worse.
But, seeing that you have come back, why, the truth must be told."</p>
<p>"And what will Miss Haredale say?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>Raffle's face paled perceptibly.</p>
<p>"Ah, well, sir," he said, "that won't be very pleasant. I'd do anything in
the world for Miss May, but she isn't you, and that makes a difference. Of
course, I know what you would do if you had your own way. You would just say
nothing about it and let Sir George put the money in his pocket. You would
rather starve than do anything you didn't consider right. I can see it in your
face now, I can tell by your eyes. But it isn't going to be, sir. You'll excuse
me for speaking so plainly, but I couldn't rest comfortably in my grave if I
thought you were in want, when, by every right, you ought to have a fortune in
your pocket. It's no use you arguing, Mr. Harry, if you don't tell the truth, I
shall."</p>
<p>The old man's voice shook strangely as he spoke. His lips were quivering,
but there was an air of determination about him which there was no mistaking.
Nobody knew better than Fielden how obstinate Joe Raffle could be. There was
nothing to gain by threats, and sternness would be worse than useless.</p>
<p>"I am certain you have acted for the best," Fielden said soothingly. "And,
as you say, there is nothing wrong in this little scheme of yours. Why, you
might have kept the colt yourself and made a fortune over him. But, to use a
pet expression of your own, my dear Joe, what you have told me has knocked me
all of a heap. I must have time to think it over. I should be sorry to spoil an
interesting situation like this by doing anything rash. Besides, there is
plenty of time between now and the Derby&mdash;pretty well three months, isn't
it? Has the colt any other engagements before Epsom?"</p>
<p>"Only two," Raffle explained. "And then he'll be an eye-opener to some
people. Now don't you do anything foolish, sir. If you go the right way about
it you've got a hundred thousand pounds in your pocket."</p>
<p>"Oh, I'll do nothing rash," Fielden laughed. "You needn't be afraid of that.
But I must have time to think this matter over. I shall stay down here a day or
two, though I had intended to go back to London to-morrow. I don't mind so much
now that I find nobody identifying me, and there are several things at the
house I want to gather together. I had no idea the old furniture was left. I
suppose they didn't sell it because they had no instructions from me, and
enough was saved from the wreck to pay my creditors without it. I'll come round
in the morning and see you again, Joe. To-night I believe I am dining with Sir
George. If anybody asks you who I am, you had better say my name is Field; it
sounds like Fielden and is easy to remember. Seeing that I am so changed,
nobody will connect me with the old family. Now I must be off."</p>
<p>In a thoughtful mood Fielden turned towards the old house. He was glad no
one recognized him, for the knowledge was likely to make his task all the
easier. He had the key of the house in his pocket. The mansion appeared to have
been left exactly as he last saw it. There was not even a caretaker on the
premises. The estate around Herons Dyke had long passed into the possession of
strangers. It presented a striking contrast to the neglected grounds and
grass-covered paths which surrounded the old mansion where, for the last three
hundred years, the Fieldens had kept open house and dispensed a lavish
hospitality. But those days were gone for ever, they would never come back
again, unless, perhaps&mdash;</p>
<p>"What a chance!" Fielden muttered to himself. "What a wonderful stroke of
fortune! And yet, I don't see how I can do it. There is no honourable course
but silence."</p>
<h2><a id="chap5" name="chap5">V. THE SHADOW OF DOUBT</a></h2>
<p class="first">There were many things in the place which Fielden had
forgotten. Here were boxes of cigars and cigarettes, while cards still lay
scattered about and the glasses had not been removed. Fielden had learnt much
in the hard school of adversity, and he began to realize that he had about him
the means to secure a considerable sum of money. Despite the dust and gloom and
air of decay, the library was intact. Fielden was surprised at this, for he had
frequently heard his father say that the books were valuable. Perhaps it had
occurred to nobody to look for rare books in the house of a man who gave
himself over entirely to sport, but here they were and possibly a little later
they might appear to advantage in a London auction-room. Fielden was not so
sanguine as he once had been, but at a modest computation he thought they would
fetch at least a thousand pounds.</p>
<p>He went up to his bedroom and began idly turning out the drawers. At any
rate he would be able to cut a presentable appearance at Haredale Park. He
might venture in the open, too, for it was nearly dark. The lights of Haredale
gleamed hospitably as he walked up the drive. He had had no formal invitation,
nothing save May Haredale's suggestion, but he knew Sir George well enough to
be sure of his reception.</p>
<p>It all looked strangely familiar as the butler opened the door and asked his
name. Fielden knew the butler's face well, but it was plain the latter did not
recognize him. Yes, Sir George and Miss Haredale were at home. They had arrived
from London late in the afternoon, but, so far as the butler knew, did not
expect any guest. Still, so many people came and went to that hospitable house
that the advent of a stranger caused no surprise in the butler's mind.</p>
<p>"If you will give me your name, sir," he suggested.</p>
<p>"Oh, tell Miss Haredale that Mr. Field is here. She expects me,
because&mdash;"</p>
<p>Fielden broke off suddenly, for May Haredale came across the hall at that
moment. She smiled a welcome and held out her hand. She dismissed the butler,
after giving instructions to him to take the visitor's bag upstairs.</p>
<p>"I was almost afraid you wouldn't come," she said. "I feared you would be
too proud or something equally absurd."</p>
<p>"I plead guilty," Harry Fielden smiled. "Really I don't think I should have
had courage to come, only I found that not a soul knew me with the exception of
Joe Raffle. I have passed a score of people to-day whom I know intimately. But
it is just as well, May. Why, even Mason, your butler, looked at me as if I
were a perfect stranger."</p>
<p>"But I recognized you," May said quietly.</p>
<p>"Ah, you recognized me, and I was glad of that. I don't think I can tell you
how happy that made me. When we met in London I felt for the first time for
more than two years that I was not alone in the world. It makes one hard and
bitter to be always amongst strangers who care nothing for one, to feel that if
one dropped dead in the street no one would feel even a pang of regret. But I
ought not to be talking like this. There is one thing I am going to ask you and
Sir George, and that is, to keep my identity a secret. It is possible I may be
here a good deal off and on, and that is why I am going to drop the last two
letters of my name and call myself Field."</p>
<p>It was with mixed feelings that Fielden stood by his dressing-table
adjusting his black evening tie an hour later. His surroundings were bringing
back his boyhood's associations vividly, every object was growing familiar. It
was just the same when he came down to the drawing-room and found Sir George
waiting him.</p>
<p>Here was a change, at any rate. Those around him daily might not have seen
much difference, but to Fielden Sir George had grown old and bent. There were
lines of care about his eyes and his manner was painfully nervous. In this old
man there was no suggestion of one of the finest sportsmen and most fearless
riders in the county. Fielden had learnt much in the light of bitter
experience. He knew great mental anxiety when he saw it, and he needed no one
to tell him that he was face to face with it now. But Sir George's welcome was
hearty. The ring in his voice and the pressure of his hand left nothing lacking
in the way of sincerity.</p>
<p>"Ah, my boy, this is an unexpected pleasure," he said. "I don't think you
really know how glad I am to see you. You are almost the only one of the old
stock left except ourselves. One by one they have passed away, and of the score
of houses where I used to go as a boy there isn't one to-day which is not
inhabited by new people. Most of them are sportsmen of a sort, but they haven't
the old feeling for it. Well, perhaps I am a bit old-fashioned. And how you
have changed! I give you my word for it, I should not have known you from Adam.
Yet it seems only the other day that you came into one of the finest properties
and proceeded to get rid of it after the manner of your kind. How we missed
you! But it is no use crying over spilt milk. I hoped at one time that you and
May&mdash;God bless me, what am I talking about! May tells me that you don't
want to be known by your own name, and that we are to speak of you as Mr.
Field. Perhaps it is natural. Now you are here, you had better stay a few days,
and I'll see if I can find something for you to do. A friend of mine lives
close by, Mr. Raymond Copley. He is new since your time, is very rich, has a
fancy to keep a stable, and is looking for some one he can rely upon to take
the entire management. He has had one or two men who have robbed him. I am sure
I can recommend you; with all your folly and extravagance you never forgot what
is due to your name."</p>
<p>"You are very good, sir," Fielden answered. "The post you speak of would be
a perfect boon to me. Besides, it is about the only thing I am capable of doing
properly. But who is Mr. Copley and where did he make his money?"</p>
<p>"South Africa, I believe. He is a millionaire with a taste for sport, not
exactly what you would call a gentleman, but I believe him to be a thoroughly
good fellow. I don't mind telling you, between ourselves, that I am under
obligations to him. Things haven't gone very well with me, and I don't know how
I should have pulled through if it hadn't been for Copley. He has been very
generous and I only wish May could be more cordial towards him. I can't think
why she doesn't like the man. It would be a splendid thing for her&mdash;But,
there. I am rambling again."</p>
<p>Fielden turned his face aside. He was feeling a strange pain at his heart
which he could not account for. But he understood what Sir George intended to
convey. Beyond all doubt, Sir George Haredale was under great obligations to
this newcomer and was warning Fielden there must be no more nonsense between
May and himself. He was telling the latter precisely what his hopes for his
daughter were.</p>
<p>Of course there was nothing in it that Fielden could resent. He had had his
opportunity and deliberately lost it. It was only during the last twenty-four
hours that he realized what his feelings towards May were. If he had not been a
fool, he would be rich and prosperous at this moment, with May for his
wife.</p>
<p>The strange sensation was with him all through dinner. He tried in vain to
shake it off. It was not a cheerful meal, on the whole, for every now and then
Sir George lapsed into moody silence and May's gaiety was fitful. The evening
dragged on till ten o'clock before Sir George came into the drawing-room with
slightly flushed face and eyes that were too bright. May looked anxiously at
her father. So here, Fielden thought, was another skeleton in the closet. The
discovery was a fresh stab to him. His own selfishness and folly were a
reproach. It was a relief when the door bell clanged and the butler announced
that Mr. Copley would like to speak to Sir George.</p>
<p>"Ask him in," Sir George said unsteadily.</p>
<p>Fielden glanced at May. He could see that her face had changed slightly and
her eyes grown hard and cold. Then the door opened and Copley came in, big and
self-important, with the air of a man entirely at home. There was something in
his appearance which jarred upon Fielden, something that aroused a pang beyond
mere jealousy. As Copley bent over May Haredale's hand and murmured something
which he intended for a compliment, Fielden started back for a moment.</p>
<p>"This is my young friend, Mr. Harry Field," Sir George said. "Harry, let me
introduce you to Mr. Copley. I think I have found the very man you want for
your stables, Copley. He is the son of an old pal of mine and has all the game
at his finger-tips."</p>
<p>Copley threw a half-contemptuous glance at Fielden and did not hold out his
hand, for which discourtesy Harry felt grateful.</p>
<p>"Excuse me a moment," Fielden said. "I have forgotten something. I'll be
back presently."</p>
<p>With his head in a whirl Fielden walked into the library. He was fighting
hard for the mastery of himself.</p>
<p>"Good God!" he muttered, "so it's that blackguard! What a blessing he
doesn't know me by sight! Raymond Copley and May Haredale! Not if it costs me
my life!"</p>
<h2><a id="chap6" name="chap6">VI. A TRIAL SPIN ON THE DOWNS</a></h2>
<p class="first">Harry Fielden spent a sleepless night and was glad when it was
time to come down to breakfast. He congratulated himself upon the way he had
restrained himself on the previous evening. He had even forced himself to be
polite to Copley, though his one impulse had been to take him by the throat and
choke the life out of him. His very presence in a house like Haredale Park was
an outrage. He wondered what Sir George would say if he had known the real
character of his guest. Possibly Fielden would have spoken freely, had not he
remembered what Sir George had said as to the relationship existing between
himself and Raymond Copley. Plainly the master of Haredale Park was under the
scoundrel's thumb. No doubt he had lent him money, and probably the price of
the assistance was to be May Haredale's hand. There had been no mistaking
Copley's manner towards her. His air of cool proprietorship had sent the blood
humming in Fielden's head and caused it to tingle in his finger-tips. Harry had
to smile complacently whilst every instinct in his nature was crying out
against the villain's presence. He had only to speak and he knew that Sir
George would do his duty at any cost.</p>
<p>But he dared not speak. He had no desire to ruin the man who had been so
kind to him. It was far better to play a waiting game. But come what might, May
Haredale should never marry that man. Sir George should be ruined a thousand
times over and Haredale Park pass into the hands of strangers before that
catastrophe occurred.</p>
<p>It had been a relief to hear Copley say that he would not be down again till
the end of the week. Therefore he had three days in which to think of some
scheme. It was a bright, fresh February morning, with a touch of frost in the
air, but the diamonds were growing soft and yielding to the sunshine. May
Haredale was in excellent spirits. It was impossible not to catch the infection
of her gaiety. Fielden put trouble on one side. There would be time for that
later, he thought, as they rode out together over the Downs. They were out
again in the afternoon and it was dark before they returned. It was like old
times for Fielden to feel a good horse under him. The exercise and motion drove
all gloomy thoughts away. Still, from time to time the shadow of distress lay
heavily upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>He strolled round to Mallow's after tea to have a pipe and chat with Raffle.
Everything appeared to be going well, and the old man was in high glee.</p>
<p>"We shall try the colt at daybreak," he said. "Would you like to come and
have a look, Mr. Harry? I daresay there will be one or two people about, but I
don't think they'll learn much. I've got a plan of my own on foot, and after
to-morrow I shouldn't be surprised if you found the colt going a little queerly
in the betting."</p>
<p>Raffle chuckled as he spoke, but refused to be more explicit.</p>
<p>"Oh, never you mind, sir," he said. "There are some things it is as well not
to talk about. If you like to turn out to-morrow as soon as it is light, I
think I can show you something worth looking at."</p>
<p>Fielden nodded approvingly. He woke fairly early with the pale dull light of
the wintry morning streaming through his window, crept downstairs into the
deserted hall and let himself out by a side door. The grey mist hanging over
the Downs lifted as the sun began to make his influence felt. A little later
Fielden discerned a group of figures faintly sketched against the skyline, and
could see two horses in their clothing. Then he picked out the form of Joe
Raffle. There was a stretch of turf between two banks of gorse, and the horses
began to move along the flat expanse. Fielden strolled up to the group, and was
amused to see the suspicious glances turned in his direction.</p>
<p>"That's all right, Mr. Mallow," Raffle muttered. "This gentleman is a friend
of mine. Now, sir, will you go on to the top of the Downs and wait for us by
the boundary stone? That will be the winning post. No reason, I suppose, to ask
you if you know which is the colt and which is the old horse. That's pretty
plain even in this light."</p>
<p>"That's right enough," Fielden smiled.</p>
<p>He walked rapidly towards the improvised winning-post, unslung his glasses
and fixed them steadily upon the little specks in the distance. Presently they
made a move in his direction and grew larger as they came along. Fielden could
hear the thud of hoofs upon the turf. Then they flashed by him, the old horse
lengths ahead. It came as a surprise to the watcher, for he had expected an
entirely different result. What was Mallow doing? What scheme had that wily man
in his brain? Fielden stepped aside into the gorse, so as to be out of the wind
which had already extinguished two matches he had used in his attempt to light
a cigarette. As he stooped, he heard voices from somewhere close by. The voices
carried clear enough in the silence of the spot, and Fielden could hear every
word. With an instinct of caution which he could not have explained he crouched
down behind the thick shelter of a bush.</p>
<p>He thought he had recognized one of the voices and now he felt sure of it.
It was Raymond Copley beyond a doubt. Who the other man was Fielden had not the
slightest idea.</p>
<p>"Now what does that mean?" Copley was asking.</p>
<p>"What does it mean?" the other man exclaimed with a sneer. "Why, it is as
plain as the nose on your face. I felt certain what was going to happen when I
advised you to come here this morning. The boy told me there was going to be a
trial, and I wanted you to see for yourself. You are always too sanguine in
these matters, Copley, and that's a fact. Now what do you think of the chances
of your friend Sir George's colt?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what to say," Copley muttered. "The colt seemed to be beaten
fairly and squarely. I suppose there is no faking about it."</p>
<p>"Faking! Sir George and his trainer between them haven't got brains enough
for that. They belong to the old-fashioned school who pride themselves upon
doing everything above board. And a precious good job for you and me, because
they find the money to keep and train horses and we sail in when it comes to
making a book. Perhaps you're sorry you had anything on the Blenheim colt."</p>
<p>"Oh, you were quite right to bring me here," Copley replied. "I owe you one
for this day's work. But the worst of it is I have backed that horse for a big
stake, just when I don't know where to turn for ready money. If anybody knew my
present position, a good many people would be anxious to have an interview with
Raymond Copley, the South African millionaire. Then there's that scoundrel
Phillips to be reckoned with. But come along, let us go before anybody sees us.
After breakfast&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Breakfast be hanged!" the other man broke out impatiently. "What's the use
of worrying about breakfast with a bit of information like this in our pockets?
The delay of half an hour may make all the difference in the world. Besides,
there may be a dozen other people watching for all we know."</p>
<p>"Well, what do you suggest?" Copley asked.</p>
<p>"Suggest, who wants to suggest anything? What we have to do is to get back
to your place as soon as possible and take the motor straight to town. By ten
o'clock we can get our commission on the market at our own price. Then we can
have as much breakfast as you like. That's the worst of you, Copley. You always
think everything can wait. Now come on."</p>
<p>The voices died away in the distance, and then Fielden straightened himself
again. He was somewhat mystified by what he had seen. He was puzzled to know
what Joe Raffle and Mallow were driving at. But no doubt the old man would tell
him at the first opportunity. Some clever scheme was in the wind. It was just
possible, too, that Raffle expected that Copley and his friend would be there.
It was more than possible that Raffle knew the class of scoundrel he had to
deal with. The old man was coming down the wide stretch of turf, and Fielden
looked eagerly towards him. As he vaulted a patch of gorse, his left foot
dropped on something soft, like a bundle, and he was thrown violently to his
knees. Then he turned to find that he had stumbled upon the figure of a man
lying at the foot of the gorse bush, snugly rolled up in a railway rug. Here
was another tout, beyond doubt, another of the hateful tribe which has always
been the detestation of every racing man. Fielden turned upon him savagely and
demanded what he was doing there. He bent over the stranger threateningly, and
the latter rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"Keep your temper," he said. "I'm doing no harm. I'm not the only one who
has earned a bit on the Downs this morning. Hands off, please. Why, bless my
soul! if it isn't Mr. Fielden."</p>
<p>Harry stared in amazement at the mention of his name. For a moment he did
not recognize the dark unshaven features of the man. They seemed familiar, yet
somehow he failed to connect them with time, or space, or locality.</p>
<p>Then it suddenly came to him.</p>
<p>"Aaron Phillips!" he exclaimed. "Now is it Luck that has sent you here, or
Coincidence?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap7" name="chap7">VII. A LEAF FROM THE PAST</a></h2>
<p class="first">Aaron Phillips was standing up with something like a smile
upon his face. He was a short, slim person, swarthy and foreign-looking, except
for the pair of keen blue eyes which bespoke the Anglo-Saxon in his blood. From
the roots of his hair across to his left temple was a long, angry red furrow
which looked like a comparatively freshly-healed wound. As to the rest, he was
fairly well dressed, with that indescribable air of nattiness which usually
pertains to those who belong to the <i>genus</i>"horsey."</p>
<p>"Glad to meet you, Mr. Fielden," he grinned.</p>
<p>"I shall be obliged if you won't use that name here," Harry replied. "For
the present my name is Field, and I want you not to forget it. But how did you
manage to get home again? I thought you were dead."</p>
<p>Phillips indicated the scar on his forehead.</p>
<p>"It was a near thing, Mr. Fielden, I beg pardon, Field. It wasn't the fault
of those scoundrels, I can tell you. They left me for dead, and if I hadn't
been picked up by some of the boys I should have died of starvation on the
veldt. As it was, I had a very close shave, and so did Copley and Foster, for
the matter of that. Our friends chased them all across the Colony and how they
managed to escape was a mystery to me. Still, perhaps it is as well. There are
more ways than one of taking revenge."</p>
<p>The little man's eyes gleamed as he spoke. He glanced meaningly at Fielden
and jingled a few coppers in his pocket.</p>
<p>"Make them pay for it, you mean," Fielden smiled.</p>
<p>"That's it, sir, you've got it first time. Now, as you know perfectly well,
there are a dozen or more people out yonder who would give a good round sum to
have Copley on the end of a rope, or within reach of a revolver shot. They are
not the sort to give information to the police, because that is not the way we
used to do things. Still, if I like to open my mouth widely enough I could make
it deuced hot for Copley &amp; Co. I could have them conveyed to Cape Town, and
it wouldn't take me long to find evidence enough to give those two chaps ten
years on the Breakwater. Yes, sir, I'd have done it, too, but there's a better
way than that. It took me the best part of a year or more to scrape enough
money together to pay my passage home. I had heard some queer stories about
Copley, and I wanted to find out if they were true. What do I see when I reach
London? Why, Copley with a set of offices in the city&mdash;Copley with a suite
of rooms at a palatial hotel&mdash;Copley with a place in the country and a
string of race-horses. Oh, I tell you, Mr. Fielden&mdash;Field, I mean&mdash;I
rubbed my hands when I heard of it. Thinks I to myself, 'This is a better game
than handing Copley over to the South African police.' I don't quite know yet
how Copley has managed it, but here he is ruffling it with the best, spending
money like water, and going to marry the daughter of a baronet in these
parts."</p>
<p>Fielden's face flushed angrily. He winced at this home thrust on Phillips'
part. So already people were coupling May Haredale's name with Copley. It had
not occurred to him that things had gone as far as that. However, Phillips
could not be expected to know this. He was merely innocently repeating local
gossip.</p>
<p>"I suppose you mean to have some of this money?" he asked.</p>
<p>"If you don't mind my using the expression, I am going to blackmail Copley.
I am not afraid of the blackguard here. There is no chance of his trying on any
of his murderous tricks in England. He knows I have come back, but as yet I
have not waited upon him. I have had a hint to call from Foster, but I am not
taking any of that, thank you. You don't catch me dropping into a police trap
with a chance of being prosecuted and hustled out of the country before I know
where I am. When I do strike it will be in a different way altogether. For the
present, I have been looking around asking questions, because, you see, it will
be of considerable advantage to me to find out where Copley is getting his
money. That he is earning it honestly I don't believe. He couldn't do it if he
wanted to. He is the sort of blackguard who would rather make five pounds
dishonestly than a tenner by legitimate business."</p>
<p>"I suppose you never found those plans?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>Phillips swore heartily.</p>
<p>"Never, sir," he said. "They were in my portmanteau, as you know. I had the
portmanteau in my possession when those blackguards attacked me, and they had
to levant without it, so closely were they pressed. But when I was well again I
asked for my baggage and no one could tell me what had become of it. It
vanished in a most mysterious manner. If you ask me, the portmanteau was stolen
by one of those thievish Kaffre boys. It makes me wild when I think of it.
Probably it is concealed in a Kaffre hut. In the old portmanteau is a scrap of
paper which is worth hundreds of thousands to us. I say us, because it is yours
just as much as it is mine. I don't belong to your class, Mr. Fielden, but you
played the game and were always a white man. And if those papers ever do come
to hand, I shall do the fair thing by you. It doesn't follow because I happen
to be the son of a sporting publican that I don't know the difference between
right and wrong. But what's the good of worrying about that? We shall never see
those papers again, and as far as we are concerned that diamond mine might
never have existed. But what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"I used to live close by," Fielden explained. "Most of this was once my
property. Sir George Haredale's trainer employs an old servant of mine and I
came out this morning to see that trial. I might ask you the same
question."</p>
<p>Phillips' blue eyes twinkled.</p>
<p>"Bit of a disappointment, wasn't it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"What do you know about it?" Fielden demanded.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, sir, we are not partners in this job, at any rate. If you like to
keep your counsel, I am perfectly willing to keep mine. Old Raffle is as
straight as they make 'em, but he is a downy old fox all the same, and pretty
neatly he drew the feather over Copley's eye this morning. Oh, yes, I heard all
those blackguards had to say; in fact, I followed them here. I am glad I came,
because I heard something that confirmed my suspicions."</p>
<p>"You mean as to Copley's movements?"</p>
<p>"To be sure. I wanted to know where Copley is getting his money. I know he
isn't paying his tradesmen, but that doesn't matter, for a man with a
reputation for wealth can get as much credit as he likes. But Copley is flying
at high game and must have the command of a good deal of ready cash. Now where
does it come from? What sort of a swindle is on? Why were they so anxious to
watch the trial of the Blenheim colt this morning? And, by the way, Mr.
Fielden, you must give old Raffle a hint to keep his eye on the stable lads.
Somebody has been betraying confidence. It doesn't matter this time, because
Copley was fooled this morning as easily as if he had been a schoolboy. But I
am getting a bit away from the point. I was going to tell you where Copley got
his money. Well, it's a betting swindle, one of the biggest and most ingenious
that has been attempted on the turf for many a long day. I just heard enough to
put me on the track. But I've my work cut out before I reach the bottom of it.
You have no occasion to love Copley&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Indeed, I haven't," Fielden said bitterly. "I have every reason for
disliking the man, every reason for exposing him before Miss&mdash;well, before
things have gone too far. If I can help you, I will do so cheerfully."</p>
<p>"That's right," Phillips said approvingly. "Now where can I see you for half
an hour in the course of the afternoon? We mustn't stay talking here. There is
old Raffle."</p>
<p>Fielden thought it over for a moment or two. He was glad enough to meet this
old South African comrade of his again. In several respects Phillips was
anything but a desirable acquaintance. His upbringing had been none too strict,
but, at the same time, he had a rough code of honour, and it was one of his
proudest boasts that he never forgot a friend or a favour. Probably he had had
his own reasons for leaving England suddenly, and no doubt those reasons had
something to do with the turf. At any rate, he had a profound and intricate
knowledge of racing matters, and there was no swindle or trick with which he
was not familiar.</p>
<p>"You had better meet me at Heron's Dyke," Fielden said. "You can be outside
in the road about a quarter to five. There is nobody on the premises. I have
the key in my pocket, and I daresay I shall manage to get a light from
somewhere."</p>
<p>Phillips disappeared amongst the high gorse. As Fielden stepped into the
open he saw Raffle looking about for him. There was a shrewd smile on the old
man's face, and he did not appear in the least disconcerted by the result of
the trial.</p>
<p>"Well?" Fielden asked. "What about your Derby winner now?"</p>
<p>Raffle's eye contracted in a wink.</p>
<p>"It's all right, sir," he said. "The trial was a great success. Did you
happen to see anybody in the gorse?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Fielden replied. "I saw Mr. Copley."</p>
<p>"And a friend," Raffle chuckled. "I know all about it. And between you and
me, sir, I got this up for the benefit of Mr. Copley, who is about the greatest
rascal unhanged, and that's saying a good deal. It was high time you came
back."</p>
<h2><a id="chap8" name="chap8">VIII. ROGUES IN COUNCIL</a></h2>
<p class="first">Raffle strode sturdily along, refusing to say another word.
What deep-laid schemes the old man had in his mind Fielden could only faintly
guess. At any rate it was good to know that Raffle was satisfied, and that some
careful plan was afoot with a view to Copley's discomfiture.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you are wise to keep your own counsel," Fielden said. "But I've
learnt something this morning, too, Raffle. There is somebody in the stable who
is disclosing secrets, and the sooner you know it the better."</p>
<p>"I know it already," Raffle grinned. "It is all part of the scheme. They
have got hold of one of the boys, and I am watching him carefully. I let him
take away just as much information as I like. Don't you worry about me, Mr.
Harry. I haven't been at this game for fifty years without learning a thing or
two. I have always made it a rule to go straight myself, but that is no reason
why I should keep my eyes closed to the doings of other people."</p>
<p>"Quite right," Fielden said approvingly. "But what do you know about Mr.
Copley? He is a stranger in these parts."</p>
<p>"That may be, sir, but he is no stranger to me. I never forget a face, and
I've been on every racecourse in the country during the last five and twenty
years. The first time I saw Mr. Copley, he was being shown round the stables by
Sir George. I didn't like him, and I didn't like his manner, and thinks I to
myself, 'I wonder where I've seen <i>you</i>before?' Suddenly there flashes
into my mind a little incident that happened at Lincoln. I can see it as plain
as I can see this book in my hand. And then I knew that Mr. Copley, the African
millionaire, was one and the same with the welsher that I had seen half killed
at Lincoln a good many years ago. Well, it wasn't for me to say anything about
it, because I can find you a score of men to-day, rich and prosperous men, who
started life amongst the scum of the racecourse. I have been making a few
inquiries amongst my old pals, and it is just as I expected. Mr. Copley may be
a rich man now, but he is just as big a scamp as ever he was, and Sir George
ought to know it. I tell you, Mr. Harry, it fairly makes my blood boil to see
that blackguard swaggering about here and hanging around Miss May as if she
belonged to him. It fair spoils my enjoyment and my food, it does. But you see
how difficult it is for a man in my position to interfere. But your case is
different."</p>
<p>Fielden shook his head sadly. His case was very different indeed. More and
more bitterly did he blame himself for the heedless, senseless folly which had
brought him to his present pitch. How changed things might have been if he had
only shown ordinary prudence! What would he gain if he went to Sir George with
these vague stories about Copley? He could not doubt but that Sir George was
deeply in Copley's debt, and that Copley had brought this about so that, when
the time came, he could force May to marry him. These painful thoughts were
uppermost in his mind as he strode back to the house. He could not shake them
off, though May rallied him on his quietness and offered him the proverbial
penny for his thoughts.</p>
<p>"I know what is the matter," she said gaily. "You are fretting because you
have nothing to do. But that won't be for long. Do you know that we are dining
with Mr. Copley to-night, and that you have been included in the invitation?
Mr. Copley telephoned from London this morning, and you were especially
mentioned by name. I am sure if I put in a word for you the post will be as
good as yours. Before long you will be occupying an important place in the
racing world, and the rest is in your own hands. You have the consolation, too,
of knowing that no one has recognized you."</p>
<p>It was on the tip of Fielden's tongue to refuse. It was repugnant to his
instincts to take service with a man like Copley. Yet, on the other hand, it
was fair enough to fight this fellow with his own weapons. Through him Fielden
had lost the chance of his lifetime. But for him and his rascally associates,
Fielden and Phillips would have been rich men to-day. Moreover, if something
were not done speedily, a fate which was worse than death awaited May Haredale.
To turn his back upon a chance like this would be to precipitate the very
calamity which he was most anxious to avert. Copley was the type of strong man
who always gets his way. He was not the least scrupulous as to his methods, and
Sir George Haredale was bound to him hand and foot. It would be far better to
seize this coign of vantage, especially as Copley had not the smallest idea of
the bitter enemy he was maintaining under his roof.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Copley and his friend Foster had returned from town. They reached
Copley's establishment, Seton Manor, just before dark. They had not lost any
time. Apparently they had done their work fairly well, for, according to the
late evening papers, the Blenheim colt had receded steadily in the betting.
People were asking themselves what had happened. Most of the public knew and
respected Sir George Haredale. Not the faintest shadow rested on his
reputation, and this fact had had somewhat of a steady effect on the market.
But though a certain division had rushed in at these improved prices to back
their fancy, there seemed to be an unlimited amount of money ready to be laid
against the horse. At any rate, Copley was fairly satisfied. He had invested
several thousand pounds against the Blenheim colt, which, in his opinion, was
already as good as out of the running altogether.</p>
<p>He came into what he called his library just before dinner and found Foster
awaiting him. Both were in evening dress, both exceedingly shiny and glossy,
and both carried more jewellery than was in accordance with good taste. The
guests were not expected for half an hour, so Copley helped himself liberally
to brandy and soda and lighted a fresh cigarette.</p>
<p>"Any letters?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing of importance," Foster replied. "When I left you this morning I
went round to see if I could see anything of Phillips. He wasn't at his
lodgings, and they said he wasn't expected back till to-morrow. Now what are
you going to do about that chap?"</p>
<p>"Oh, let him go to the devil!" Copley growled.</p>
<p>"My dear Copley, why do you always talk like that? Why do you think that
every man is a fool except yourself? You appear to be very prosperous. Nobody
can deny your courage. And because you are not afraid of Phillips you seem to
think he isn't dangerous. I think he is. Suppose he goes to Scotland Yard and
lays his information before the people there, and suppose they communicate with
the authorities in Cape Town, the result will be an application for your
arrest, and once you get out there you know what will happen. It will be all
U.P."</p>
<p>"Thinking about your own skin," Copley sneered.</p>
<p>"Well, and what if I am? I haven't got a sanguine temperament like yours. Of
course, we could buy Phillips off; at least we could buy him off for the time
being and keep his mouth shut till we devised some plan for getting rid of him
altogether. But he is a cunning devil, is Aaron Phillips, and has learnt how to
profit by past experience. It is no use asking him to come to your hotel. He
isn't going to walk into a trap like that, and he isn't going to wait much
longer, either. If we could give him a thousand pounds just to go on with,
why&mdash;"</p>
<p>"A thousand devils," Copley exclaimed furiously. "Where am I going to get a
thousand pounds? I mean, where am I going to get it just at this moment? I've
got this place here, which isn't paid for. I managed to get the bank to advance
the money till I could complete the purchase, and the furnishing was an easy
matter. One can get as much credit as one likes in this country, provided one
winks at extortionate charges. As I will never pay for the stuff at all, the
West End tradesmen can charge what they please. But the fact remains that
though people are tumbling over one another to get my custom I am fairly at my
wits' end for ready cash. Of course, it will be all right when the flat season
begins in earnest. With any luck there'll be a hatful of money to share between
us before the October meeting at Newmarket. We ought to make over a thousand
pounds at Mirst Park on Saturday week. I suppose you've got it all ready. Got
the telephone in place? The worst of this game is that one has to take so many
people into one's confidence."</p>
<p>"That's all right," Foster explained. "Everything is in its place now. I
went down to Mirst Park the day before yesterday. The house is finished and all
the workmen have gone. The telephone is in good order, because I tried it. The
man who fixed up the extension from the hall to the roof was a bit curious, but
I managed to put him off the scent by some lie about the doctor's orders and a
patient who had been recommended to try outdoor treatment. But we ought to have
a mechanic of our own, Copley. If any hint of our little secret leaked out, the
man who fixed that extended telephone would be certain to see it, and naturally
he would ask himself a question or two. The fewer outsiders we have to deal
with the better."</p>
<p>"There's no doubt of that," Copley agreed. "Then there's nothing to settle
now. Did you rehearse the bit in Covent Garden?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes. I was in the office we have taken next door to the Post Club, and
went through the whole thing with Radley, who was stationed outside. There
wasn't a hitch anywhere. I don't see why we shouldn't clear a thousand pounds;
indeed, we might make a great deal more. But perhaps it would be just as well
to be on the safe side. It would be a fatal mistake to arouse the suspicions of
the bookmakers at the beginning, and if this scheme breaks down we've got
another one."</p>
<p>Copley smiled as he finished his brandy and soda. He threw the end of his
cigarette into the grate as the door bell rang.</p>
<p>"Come along," he said. "Here are our guests. Let us go into the drawing-room
and wait for them. We must assume respectability even if we have it not."</p>
<h2><a id="chap9" name="chap9">IX. IN THE TOILS</a></h2>
<p class="first">In spite of his dislike of Copley, Fielden could not see much
to object to in his manner as he came forward to receive his guests. He was,
perhaps, a trifle loud and domineering, perhaps a little too familiar in the
way in which he held May Haredale's hand in his. Foster more or less
obliterated himself. It was his r&ocirc;le in company to play the confidential
servant. He was quiet and subdued, though nothing escaped his sharp glance. The
dinner was excellent. Everything was in good taste, as Fielden was forced to
admit. The talk, for the most part, was lively and was kept principally to the
topic of sport. Afterwards there was a move towards the billiard-room, and ere
he realized it, Fielden found himself engaged in a game of pool with Sir George
and Foster, while May Haredale and Copley looked on. A moment or two later
these two vanished on a pretext of Copley's that he wished to show May some
sporting pictures he had lately acquired. The pictures were duly inspected, but
Copley made no move to rejoin the party.</p>
<p>"Hadn't we better go back?" May suggested.</p>
<p>Copley turned an admiring glance upon the girl. There was no mistaking the
expression of his face. May had more than her fair share of courage, but she
was feeling a bit restless and nervous. She was wondering why she disliked this
man so much. She had had nothing but kindness and courtesy at his hands. She
knew that he had helped her father more than once. Yet her instinct told her
that Copley was not to be trusted. There was a boldness about him that repelled
her, something in his glittering eye from which she recoiled. Now she knew
almost before the words were spoken what Copley was going to say.</p>
<p>"The others are not likely to miss us for a bit," he said. "Besides, there
is something I have to talk to you about. To be perfectly candid, I asked you
over here this evening on purpose. I wonder why it is that you avoid me
so."</p>
<p>"I was not aware of it," May murmured.</p>
<p>"But, indeed, you do. I have noticed it more than once. Surely you must know
why I come so frequently to Haredale Park. I am not much of a ladies' man, Miss
May, and I never have been. I have led a rough kind of life. I know so little
of the atmosphere of drawing-rooms. But every man recognizes, when the time
comes, when he meets with the woman who is made for him alone, and that is the
point I have reached. I think I could provide you all you need. You will have a
fine house and a good position, and everything you want. I daresay this is a
rough way of putting it, but it is none the less sincere for that."</p>
<p>It was sincere enough, as May had to admit. Copley's assurance had vanished.
He was speaking from his heart. The man was rogue and scoundrel through and
through, but had fallen deeply in love with May Haredale. He was prepared to go
any lengths to make her his wife. It was the only piece of honesty and
sincerity that he had ever displayed since he was old enough to know the
distinction between right and wrong.</p>
<p>May stood silent and trembling. She was not insensible to the compliment
Copley was paying her. She knew that he meant every word he said, and she knew,
too, that there must be a hard fight before she could convince him that the
thing he so ardently desired was impossible. She had an uneasy feeling, too,
that Copley had not yet played all his cards. "I ought to thank you, I
suppose," she said. "In a sense you are doing me an honour, and this is the
first time that any man has asked me such a question, and naturally I feel
disturbed. But what you ask of me is quite impossible."</p>
<p>"Why impossible?" Copley asked grimly. "Oh, I didn't expect you to jump at
me; I know you are not that sort of girl. Perhaps that is one of the main
reasons why I am so anxious to make you my wife. But if there is no one
else&mdash;"</p>
<p>"There is no one else," May said with a sorrowful sincerity which was not
lost upon her companion. "There is no one else, and there never will be. If it
is any sort of consolation to you, Mr. Copley, I shall never marry."</p>
<p>"Never is a long day," Copley smiled. "At any rate, as long as there is
nobody else in question I shall feel encouraged to go on. I am a very
persistent man, and in the end I always get my own way. I'll ask you again in a
week or two, and, perhaps, when you have had time to think it over&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, no," May said firmly. "There must be no thinking it over. I could not
marry you. I could not care for you enough for that and I would never marry a
man to whom I could not give myself wholly and entirely. It is the same to-day,
it will be the same next year. Mr. Copley, I ask you not to allude to this
distressing topic again. If you do, I shall have no alternative but to treat
you as a stranger."</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the sincerity of May's words. Her natural courage and
resolution had come back to her. She met Copley's glance without flinching. Her
little mouth was firmly set. Even Copley, with all his egotism and assurance,
knew that the last words had been said.</p>
<p>A sudden blind rage clutched him. His thin veneer of gentility vanished. He
stretched out a hand and laid it upon the girl's arm.</p>
<p>"So you mean to defy me," he said hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Defy you!" May cried, indignantly. "What do you mean? Have you forgotten
that you are a gentleman? Anybody would think to look at you and hear you speak
that you were playing the villain in some sensational melodrama. You have paid
me the compliment of asking me to be your wife, and I have done my best to
decline in such a manner as to give you as little pain as possible. You will be
good enough to take me back to the billiard-room and not to allude to this
matter again."</p>
<p>Copley laughed derisively. He had forgotten himself. The love and passion in
his heart had died away to a sullen anger. Never since he had known May
Haredale had he felt such a wild longing to possess her. Well, if the girl
would have it, then he must speak openly and freely. She must be made to
understand that here was her master, whose lightest wish she must learn to
obey.</p>
<p>"You don't understand," he said. "I suppose you think you have only to raise
your hand and pick and choose. Ah, you are mistaken, my dear young lady. If you
don't believe me, ask Sir George. He promised to speak to you on my behalf, but
I see he hasn't done so. Probably he shirked it. Now I shall have to tell you
myself. Do you know that at the present moment I am master of Haredale Park? I
don't imagine you are acquainted with business, but you know that your father
is not a rich man. Has that fact escaped you?"</p>
<p>"I am aware of it," May said coldly.</p>
<p>"Very well, then. Where do you suppose he has found the money to pay his
racing debts? Do you suppose it dropped from the clouds? During the last twelve
months, your father has had from me something like thirty thousand pounds. Even
a rich man can't always put his hand on large sums of money like that. And I
should have refused to part with the money if it had not been for your sake.
But when a man is in love, he is guilty of all sorts of follies and
extravagances and when a man like me is in love he does not stick at trifles.
Now try to realize my position. Try to realize that if I say the word there is
an end to Haredale Park as far as you are concerned. I am not boasting. I could
turn you both out to-morrow if I chose, and what would become of you then? Ask
yourself the question. You needn't answer it now; you can take time to do
so."</p>
<p>May Haredale trembled from head to foot. She had half-dreaded, half-expected
this, but the blow was no less crushing now that it had fallen, and she could
see from the grim expression on Copley's face that he meant every word he said.
She had read of similar situations in novels, but they had sounded cold and
unconvincing, and little like the real thing now that she was face to face with
it.</p>
<p>"You would never do it," she faltered.</p>
<p>"By Heaven, I would!" Copley cried. "Ah, you do not know what manner of man
I am. Why, when you look at me like that, instead of melting I grow all the
harder. I must make you my wife. You little know the sacrifices I have made to
bring this about. I never thought that I could be a fool for the sake of a
woman. I could almost laugh at my own folly, but it has become part and parcel
of my very existence, the only object in the world that is worth attaining.
Well, it is no use talking, for I could go on in the same strain all night. It
is for you to decide. You can please yourself whether your father is turned out
of house and home, or whether your prosperous and happy future&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Prosperous and happy future," May echoed scornfully. "The words on your
lips sound like blasphemy. It seems almost incredible that a man with any sort
of pride should stoop to such a trick as this to force a woman to marry him,
when, from the bottom of her heart, she loathes and detests him."</p>
<p>Copley jeered.</p>
<p>"Oh, go on," he said. "Let it come out. Treat me as if I were dirt under
your feet. But you will think better of it before a week has passed. Tell your
father what I have been saying to-night, and talk it over with him. Perhaps he
will be able to persuade you better than I can. Let us go back to the
billiard-room."</p>
<p>May turned coldly away, but her eyes were dim, and all the world seemed
slipping away from beneath her feet.</p>
<h2><a id="chap10" name="chap10">X. CONFESSION</a></h2>
<p class="first">Fielden was not enjoying his game of billiards. It was a
favourite game of his, and one which he had not had much opportunity of
exercising lately, but he would have given something for an excuse to get out
of it. The reason was obvious why Raymond Copley had made an excuse to get May
out of the room. His instinct told him what was going on, and if he had had any
lingering doubt on the subject it would have been dispelled by the most casual
glance at Sir George.</p>
<p>For Haredale had lost all geniality. He became silent and depressed. From
time to time he glanced anxiously towards the door. If such a thing were
possible to a man of his position, and with a record like his, it might be said
that he looked as if he had been committing some crime and was in deadly fear
of being found out.</p>
<p>There was no longer room for hesitation in Fielden's mind. There was a
conspiracy between Sir George and Copley against May Haredale's happiness.
Fielden was boiling. It seemed incredible that a man like Sir George could
deliberately become a party to such a scheme as this. And so the game went on,
with two people at least not taking the faintest interest in it. Then the door
opened and May Haredale entered.</p>
<p>Fielden shot a swift glance in her direction. He saw how pale her face was,
how rigidly haughty and set were her features. There were traces of tears in
her eyes, but so far as Fielden could see he had no cause to despair. Whatever
had been said or done, Copley had not gained much. His face showed that. Defeat
was written all over it. He was not the man to put up with disaster without
showing it, and Fielden knew in that moment that so far, at any rate, things
had not gone well with his host. Sir George saw it, too, for his jaw dropped,
and he turned almost a guilty face towards Copley. For a moment there was an
awkward silence.</p>
<p>"It is getting very late," May said. "Don't you think we had better be
going?"</p>
<p>Haredale looked at Copley as if waiting for a lesson.</p>
<p>"It is not so very late," he remarked.</p>
<p>"Well, it seems so to me," May said. "Besides I am very tired. I am sure Mr.
Copley will excuse me."</p>
<p>Copley murmured something more or less appropriate. He was not used to
taking the trouble to disguise his humiliation.</p>
<p>"If you must go, you must," he said. "I'll come round after breakfast and
see you to-morrow morning, Sir George. I have something important to say to
you. Perhaps you will be there, too, Mr. Fielden. I fancy I can put something
in your way. I want some one to take a general superintendence of my stables.
Sir George tells me you are thoroughly up to the work, and that I can place
every confidence in you. You seem to be the sort of man I am looking for, and,
though I am interested in racing, I have very little time to spare to look into
the details."</p>
<p>It was hard work to return thanks for this ungracious speech, but Fielden
managed it somehow. He was feeling strangely elated, and hoped that nothing of
his emotions found expression on his face. He was glad enough to find himself
at length seated in the brougham with his friends on the way back to Haredale
Park. It was a singularly silent ride, for May never spoke a word the whole
time and Sir George was ill at ease. When they reached home May turned to
Fielden.</p>
<p>"I hope you will excuse me a moment or two, Harry," she said. "I have
something to say to my father. It won't take many minutes. Perhaps you will
wait for us in the library. I think you will find everything you want
there."</p>
<p>Sir George stood nervously in the hall shuffling from one foot to another.
It seemed to take him a long time to get out of his overcoat. He turned to May
testily.</p>
<p>"Surely, there is nothing you have to say to me to-night," he said. "It will
keep till to-morrow."</p>
<p>Without reply May turned towards the drawing-room and Sir George followed.
He closed the door carefully behind him. She crossed to the fireplace and stood
facing her father. Her face was firm, though her lips trembled slightly, and
the task before her was by no means a pleasant one.</p>
<p>"I hardly know how to begin," she said. "It is so difficult for me in my
unfortunate position. I have never ceased to regret the death of my mother, but
I cannot remember feeling the want of her so much as I do now. I suppose you
can guess what happened to-night. You know what Mr. Copley said to me."</p>
<p>Sir George shook his head. His attempt to appear unconcerned was so
grotesque a failure that, in spite of her unhappiness, May could not repress a
smile.</p>
<p>"You are very transparent," she cried. "You make a bad conspirator, father.
You know perfectly well what happened to-night. You know why we were asked to
dine with Mr. Copley. He has done me the honour to ask me to be his wife. Now
don't pretend to be surprised, because Mr. Copley had your full sanction; in
fact, he told me he had discussed the matter with you more than once."</p>
<p>"And you accepted him?" Sir George asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"We will come to that presently. Now let me ask you a question. Suppose that
your position was as good as it was twenty years ago, that there were no
mortgages on the estate. In that case, what would you have said to Mr. Copley
if he had expressed a wish to become your son-in-law? You wouldn't have turned
him out of the house, because we don't do things like that. But your reply
would have been no less unmistakable. You would have made Mr. Copley feel the
absurdity of his ambition. He would never have been asked to come here again.
Now isn't that so?"</p>
<p>Sir George shuffled about uneasily.</p>
<p>"Other times, other methods," he answered. "You see the condition of things
is quite altered. Really, some of our best women marry rich men who have
nothing particular to boast of in the way of pedigree. I can call a dozen cases
to mind."</p>
<p>"Yes," May retorted. "And I can call a dozen cases to mind where you have
expressed the strongest indignation with parents who have encouraged marriages
of that sort. You have stigmatized the thing as a sale. Why, you refused to
shake hands with Lord Middlebourne when he told you that his daughter was going
to marry young Blackley. Yet, in the face of all this, you entered into a
conspiracy with Mr. Copley, a conspiracy which you must know would be fatal to
my happiness."</p>
<p>"You, you didn't refuse him?" Sir George gasped.</p>
<p>"Refuse him! Of course I did. I hope I did not say too much. But I let him
know that the thing was impossible. I told him that in no circumstances could I
become his wife. I have felt that this was coming for some time, and I blame
myself for permitting things to go so far. Mr. Copley took it very badly. He
lost his temper. He threatened me. He even went so far as to say that, unless I
thought better of my reply, he would turn us out of Haredale Park."</p>
<p>Sir George turned a white and anxious face towards his daughter.</p>
<p>"Did he say that?" he asked hoarsely.</p>
<p>"I have already told you so. But, of course, this is ridiculous. You would
never have been so foolish as to place yourself in the power of a man like Mr.
Copley. It is very well to know such people, and I daresay you have found him
useful in business. But as to the rest&mdash;Why do you look at me like that?
You don't mean to say that his story is actually true?"</p>
<p>Sir George seemed to have some difficulty in speaking. When at length the
words came they were free enough.</p>
<p>"It is true," he said. "My dear child, you must not blame me unduly. I have
been terribly unfortunate of late. Everything I have touched has gone wrong. I
am almost afraid to look at my betting book, and if the Blenheim colt does not
win the Derby, then I shall be something worse than a pauper. You don't know
what hopes I build upon this. If it comes off all right we shall be rich and
prosperous. But it has been an awful struggle to keep my head above water so
far, and when Copley offered to help me in an open-handed way, I dared not
refuse. Of course, I had not the least idea then that he had given you even
more than a passing thought. It never occurred to me that he was lending me
this money merely to have a hold upon me, and I thought it possible you might
care for him. There is always the chance&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, you didn't. I cannot believe you would ever think so meanly of me as
that."</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know," Sir George said, stung into retort. "Anyhow, it is
unfortunate that Harry Fielden should come back just now."</p>
<p>The hot blood flamed into May's face.</p>
<p>"That is unjust and ungenerous," she cried. "In any case, my reply would be
just the same. I never did care for anybody but Harry Fielden, and I never
will. You know that. There is not the slightest chance of his ever being in a
position to keep a wife. But we are talking in a circle. I am more than sorry
to hear what you say, but if the worst comes to the worst we shall have to
dispose of everything and leave Haredale Park. For nothing shall induce me to
marry Raymond Copley."</p>
<p>"Well, there's an end of it all," Sir George said. "This makes a beggar of
me. But don't decide like that. Think it over and give me your final answer in
the morning."</p>
<h2><a id="chap11" name="chap11">XI. ON THE EDGE If Harry Fielden had hoped to
see May again that night he was disappointed. She was tired, Sir George said,
and hoped that Fielden would not mind if she did not come into the library. He
was a little bit under the mark himself and would go to bed. So Fielden was
left to his uneasy thoughts with the hope that he might learn something in the
morning. But glancing at May across the breakfast table he could read nothing
from the expression of her face. She was a little silent, but otherwise her
features were tranquil, and it was not till an hour or so afterwards that
Fielden found himself alone with her</a></h2>
<p class="first">"I hope you are better?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, there's nothing whatever the matter with me," May said in her candid
way. "I am only worried, that's all. You have been here quite long enough to
see that things are not going with us as they should. It will be a terrible
thing if our colt fails to win the Derby. Indeed, I don't know how we shall be
able to carry on till the end of May in any case. What a wretched business it
all is! How foolish people are to risk their happiness on the speed of a horse!
But the Haredales have always been gamblers. I suppose it is in the blood. Put
on your hat and take me for a walk across the Downs. I need something to blow
the cobwebs away."</p>
<p>Fielden was eager. For some time he walked in silence by the girl's side,
waiting for her to speak. He had a feeling that, sooner or later, May would
confide in him. She stopped suddenly and raised her eyes to his.</p>
<p>"I am going to ask you a question," she said. "I want you to put yourself in
my place for a moment. Suppose that the honour and fortune of the family rested
in my hands, and it was for me to say whether the Haredales were to leave this
old place in poverty and disgrace, or whether they were to stay on occupying
the old position, what would you do?"</p>
<p>"It depends on circumstances," Fielden said.</p>
<p>"Of course it does, my dear boy. I didn't expect you to make such a tame
reply as that. Surely you must know what I mean. It is for me to decide. I have
the opportunity of bringing into the family the necessary money to set
everything right. But at a price."</p>
<p>"As usual," Fielden, said sadly. "The price happens to be yourself."</p>
<p>"You have guessed it. The price is myself. I suppose it would be no news to
you if I told you who the man was."</p>
<p>"Not after last night," Fielden said between his teeth. "So Raymond Copley
has asked you to marry him. I suppose it is the old story which one has read in
books and newspapers a thousand times. Copley has got your father under his
thumb and has threatened to ruin him, unless you consent to be his wife. I am
not a very shrewd person, but I felt sure of this when we came home last night.
You refused Copley, of course, and he took his refusal in the way such a cad
would. He threatened you and said he had your father on his side. And now you
are hesitating what to do. You have said that no power on earth shall force you
to consent, that you cannot save the family honour at such a price. You are
right, May. It is a vile thing to ask of a girl. It is so mean and
dishonourable. Heaven knows, I care for your welfare. I never knew how much I
did care till we met in London the other night. Then I realized for the first
time the price I am paying for my folly. If I hadn't been a fool, you would be
my wife to-day, and it would have been my pleasure and privilege to help Sir
George out of his trouble. Can you ever forgive me?"</p>
<p>May turned a tearful face towards Fielden. Impulsively she held out her
hands to him, and he caught them almost fiercely. They were alone on the wide
stretch of Downs. Not a soul was in sight. Neither knew how it happened, but a
moment later Fielden's arms were about the girl, and she was crying
unrestrainedly upon his shoulder. There was only one thing for it, and that was
to kiss the tears away and bring the smiles back to May's lips.</p>
<p>"Now we have done it," Fielden said ruefully. "I am a nice fellow to talk
about other men being dishonourable. I ought to be well thrashed for giving way
to temptation like this. Fancy a man in my position daring to make love to any
girl. But you knew what my feelings were."</p>
<p>"I was sure," May whispered.</p>
<p>"But what are we to do? It would be another matter, I suppose, if it were
three months later and the Blenheim colt had won the Derby. Then, perhaps, Sir
George would forgive me and make the best of it for your sake. As it is, I have
only succeeded in complicating matters. You are resolved, of course, that
nothing will induce you to change your mind so far as Copley is concerned. But
will you have strength enough to do it, May? I don't think you realize the
pressure which would be put upon you when you find that Haredale Park will have
to go, when you find yourself in lodgings&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never," May cried passionately. "I refuse even to discuss it. The idea is
unthinkable."</p>
<p>Fielden pressed the point no longer. He really had not the heart to do so.
Sufficient unto the day was the evil thereof. But it was with mixed feelings
that an hour or so later he walked across the fields to Seton Manor. Copley was
waiting to receive him. The latter was in his hardest and most businesslike
mood. There was something repellent about the expression of his face. The
library reeked strongly of tobacco and spirits. From the ruddy tinge on
Copley's face he had partaken of more than one brandy and soda already.</p>
<p>Fielden hoped there was nothing in the expression of his face which in any
way betrayed his thoughts. Fancy a man like this married to a girl like May
Haredale! Copley was braggart and bully to his finger-tips&mdash;a man without
heart, or conscience, or feeling. Nay, he was worse than this, as Fielden very
well knew. For the moment, it was on the tip of Harry's tongue to say he had
thought the matter over and had decided to decline Copley's offer. But more
prudent thoughts prevailed. It would be as well to be as near Copley as
possible, to be on the spot, to act when disaster threatened. Besides, Fielden,
to some extent, was in league with Aaron Phillips, and if there was anything in
the way of rascality afoot, it might be possible to detect it. It would be a
fine thing to go to Copley with the evidence of his rascality in plain black
and white, and agree to silence on the condition that this persecution of Miss
Haredale ceased.</p>
<p>"Ah! you have come," Copley said in his blunt way. "Well, I have arranged
everything for you. I want you to take over the entire management of my stable.
The last man had four hundred a year and the run of the house, and I am
prepared to offer you the same terms. Everything will be left in your hands. As
I told you last night, my racing stable is only a side-show, and I don't want
to be bothered with it. You can make a start next week at Mirst Park. I have
horses running in races both days, and I shall probably run down myself. But
you know the ropes well enough."</p>
<p>"I think you can leave it to me," Fielden remarked.</p>
<p>"Very well, then, that's settled. You can ask the housekeeper to give you a
room. You can have all the meals you want, and the horses will be yours to
handle as you like. I must wish you good morning, for I have a score of things
to occupy my attention before I motor to town at six o'clock. I think that will
do. Good day."</p>
<p>Fielden took his leave, hardly knowing whether to be pleased or not. He
spent the next hour or so in the stables, interviewing the stud groom and the
helpers, who seemed to know all about the new arrangement. He said little or
nothing about it, but was somewhat surprised to find what a poor set of horses
Copley owned. For the most part they were little better than platers. There
might be a racer or two amongst them, but only for small meetings. The groom
was quite open in his comments, and to these Fielden listened discreetly. He
was free, presently, to go over to Haredale Park and get his belongings
together. He strode across the Downs and passed the wide stretch of turf where
the trial of the Blenheim colt had taken place. He was hurrying down the slope
when he came face to face with Aaron Phillips.</p>
<p>"I was looking for you," the latter said. "I haven't been letting the grass
grow under my feet since we met last. I am beginning to get a hold of the game.
We shall be able to make those fellows sit up before long. I suppose you
couldn't manage to get away on Friday and Saturday next for the two days'
racing at Mirst Park? If you can, I shall show you something that will open
your eyes."</p>
<p>"As it happens," Fielden explained, "I am going there. I have just been
appointed a kind of general manager to Mr. Copley. I have to thank Sir George
Haredale for this. As you can imagine, Phillips, it is not a congenial
occupation. But there are urgent reasons why I ought to accept it. We have a
horse or two entered for the Mirst Park meeting, and I shall go with them. Now,
then, what is it?"</p>
<p>Aaron Phillips' face lightened.</p>
<p>"What a stroke of luck!" he exclaimed. "In that case, I need not detain you
now. But I'll contrive to see you on the course, and then I think it will be
our turn."</p>
<h2><a id="chap12" name="chap12">XII. A LION IN THE PATH</a></h2>
<p class="first">Copley did not appear to be so busy as he had professed when
he dismissed Fielden so unceremoniously. He lighted a fresh cigar and sat down
moodily over a mass of accounts. He pushed these aside presently, and took up a
copy of the <i>Sportsman</i>, which he proceeded to read with a perplexed frown
on his moody face.</p>
<p>"I cannot for the life of me understand it," he muttered. "The trial was
fair and square, and I see no reason why the boy's information was not to be
relied upon. But that colt is more firmly established in the betting than ever.
I can't recollect anything like it. It seemed a dead sure thing to lay that
money against the horse. And, yet, though I laid over ten thousand pounds
against him, in this morning's paper he is at a shorter price than before.
Well, if the public like to be such fools, it's their look-out, not mine.
Still, it's unpleasant. I wonder if Foster has learnt anything this
morning."</p>
<p>Foster came in a moment or two later. His usual smile had deserted him, and
he looked troubled and anxious.</p>
<p>"I wanted to see you," said Copley. "I can't for the life of me understand
this betting. Here's the Blenheim colt backed for a ton of money again. Why, in
the face of the commission we have put on the market, he ought to be fairly
knocked out."</p>
<p>"Oh, I've seen it," Foster replied. "I've sent for the boy. I wonder if that
young rascal played us false. But, no, I don't think he would dare do that.
Besides, he stands to win a pot of money himself. At any rate, I have sent for
him, and if there was anything about the trial that was not fair we shall know
it in half an hour."</p>
<p>For the next hour or so the two conspirators sat discussing the matter. Then
there came to them a diminutive youth, shrunken and clean-shaven, with the air
of one who has passed all his life in the atmosphere of a stable. His little
wizened face was white with agitation, and he stood, with his eyes cast to the
ground, waiting for Copley to speak.</p>
<p>"What is it?" the latter asked roughly.</p>
<p>"I don't know, sir," the boy said humbly. "I don't know how it was done. Ah,
that there Raffle is a deep 'un. I made sure as the trial the other morning was
all open and above board, and now I find as how it wasn't the Blenheim colt we
saw at all. It is no use asking me to explain, gentlemen, and it is no use
bullying me, for the more you do that the more muddled I get. It is only a word
or two I 'eard between Raffle and the 'ead lad that put me on the scent. We've
got two or three 'osses in the stable as like the Blenheim colt as two peas.
They are nearly all the same blood, you know. What old Raffle is a-driving at,
I dunno. But it looks as if one colt was changed for another at the last
moment, and nobody would have been any the wiser if I hadn't 'eard that little
conversation this blessed morning."</p>
<p>Copley and Foster exchanged glances. It was no use to scarify the boy, for
the conspiracy was none of his making, and he was obviously telling the truth;
indeed, he had been well paid to bring information to Copley and had nothing to
gain by further deception. But what was the meaning of it all? Why had Raffle
chosen to bring off a mock trial? So far as Copley knew, Raffle had no reason
to suspect the honesty of the stable boy. He could not know that he was in
Copley's pay, nor could he have known, either, that Copley and Foster would
witness that early morning trial. Could it be that there was some one else in
the field whom Raffle wished to deceive? At any rate, whether that was so or
not, Joe Raffle had put both Copley and his accomplice in a hole. After
witnessing the trial they had laid against the colt to an enormous amount, and,
after all, Sir George Haredale's horse might win the Derby. They dismissed the
boy with strict injunctions to keep his eyes open and let them know the latest
developments. Then they talked the matter over to see if they could find some
way out of the trouble.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of a facer," Copley muttered. "I am bound to confess I never
expected anything like this. I wonder what that old fox Raffle was driving at?
Whom is he trying to deceive? I'd give something to know."</p>
<p>"What does it matter?" Foster asked impatiently. "Wilfully or not, he has
deceived us. As I figure it out, we stand to lose something like five thousand
pounds. If that horse starts fit and well for the Derby we shall be in a rare
mess. And there's nothing to beat the colt. It would be maddening to be done at
the beginning of the season. Fancy having to upset all our plans because of a
misfortune like this!"</p>
<p>"Unless we could stop the colt," Copley suggested.</p>
<p>Foster looked keenly across the table at his companion.</p>
<p>"That's not a bad idea," he said thoughtfully. "If the Blenheim colt lost
the Derby we should win ten thousand pounds at least. At the price the horse
stands in the betting to-day, we could lay another twenty thousand pounds
without knocking him altogether out of the betting. I don't call to mind a case
in which the public have been more infatuated about a horse. Why, our
commission never shook him at all. Suppose, without anybody knowing it, we
could guarantee that the horse didn't start. In that case, we could lay a
hundred thousand pounds against him, with the absolute knowledge that it would
be only a question of time before we scooped up the money. Our Mirst Park
scheme is a mere fleabite to it."</p>
<p>Copley's sombre eyes lighted a little.</p>
<p>"Yes, if we could only do it," he sneered. "But the age for that game is
past. There is no chance of hocussing a horse, or laming him, or bribing a
stable boy, or squaring a jockey. That was all very well in the old days, when
meetings were few and far between, and we hadn't got an enlightened Press that
watches everything as a cat watches a mouse. It's no use wasting time over idle
dreams of that sort, Foster. Poor as he is, Sir George wouldn't even hear of
such a thing."</p>
<p>"Think not?" Foster asked. "Well, I believe myself that every man has his
price. I have never found anything to the contrary. I thought you were a fool
to come down here at all. I thought you were a fool to allow yourself to be
fascinated by that girl, but now I begin to see a way of turning it to account.
I don't suppose she'll marry you. I never thought she would."</p>
<p>The big veins on Copley's temples thickened.</p>
<p>"Stow that," he said hoarsely. "You are going too far. I'll not listen to a
word of it. It is no business of yours. If you have anything good to suggest, I
shall be glad to listen to it, but I'll thank you to leave Miss Haredale's name
out of the discussion."</p>
<p>"Oh, very well," Foster said sulkily. "But, in this case, one thing leads to
another. To gain Miss Haredale you found money for her father when we could
have done with it ourselves&mdash;indeed, we wanted it pretty badly. Now is
your chance to get it back, and more. Sir George can't pay you. He could as
easily repay a million. He will find, too, that it is impossible to coerce Miss
Haredale into marrying you. Don't get wild. I don't want to introduce the young
lady's name more than I can help, but I am bound to speak of her. You will find
that she will hold out to the end, and that, if need be, she won't object to
leaving Haredale Park. But Sir George will cut up rough when the time comes. He
is chockful of family pride. He is the sort of chap who is wedded to the family
home, and when the pinch comes you'll find him ready for anything. Of course,
he will make a fuss. He will ask you how you dare suggest such a thing to him,
but it will come right in the end."</p>
<p>Copley glanced contemptuously at the speaker.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" he exclaimed. "What are you driving at? Do you
take Sir George for an utter fool? Do you suppose that he is likely to scratch
a horse he has backed to win or lose everything he has?"</p>
<p>"Well, why not? He backed the colt at a very long price, and I don't suppose
he has put down more than a thousand altogether. On the other hand, he owes you
at least forty. Suppose you ask him to pay that back at once. Suppose you let
him know that if he doesn't you will turn him out of his house a mere beggar.
Suppose, if he consent, you offer to wipe out his debt and give him, say ten
thousand pounds, the day after the colt is scratched. You needn't do it now;
you can wait a month. Then you can put the screw on at once. He'll kick, jib,
order you out of the house, but he will knuckle under in the long run. If he
doesn't, then I'm a fool and know nothing about human nature. Why, the thing is
so easy and perfectly safe not a soul will know anything about it. The colt
pulls up lame one day at exercise, he is reported to be coughing, and before
the fools who back horses know what has happened the pen has been put through
the name of the favourite. You've got the game entirely in your hands. Then we
can get our commissions out all over the country and make a fortune without a
penn'orth of risk. By Jove! it makes me tremble only to think of it. If the
thing is properly worked, we should divide half a million between us. Now, what
have you got to say to that? Doesn't it sound right?"</p>
<p>Copley brought his fist down upon the table.</p>
<p>"By gad," he exclaimed, "I'll do it, Foster!"</p>
<h2><a id="chap13" name="chap13">XIII. "AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN"</a></h2>
<p class="first">As most people are aware, the camp-followers of the turf are a
large body whose ways of earning a living are, to say the least of it,
peculiar. This noble army numbers folk of all kinds, from the member of a
swagger West End club to the humble seller of cards on the various courses.
Amongst these, in his place, came Aaron Phillips. If he had been asked, he
would probably have said that he was a professional backer of horses, a
description which covers a wide field and embraces many methods of getting a
living&mdash;more or less honestly.</p>
<p>In all likelihood Phillips would have resented the imputation that he was
not a sportsman, and have declared emphatically that he was nothing else. He
had been connected with racing ever since he could recollect, but had never
been across a horse in his life, and would have found it impossible to pick out
the good points of an animal. But he was fond of horses in his way. He had
heard them talked about for years, and most of the frequenters of his father's
public-house were either followers of racing or indirectly mixed up with the
"sport of kings." He had been born, too, in the vicinity of a classic course
and had always taken the greatest interest in the dramatic side of the turf.
There was not an ingenious swindle but he had the details of it by heart.</p>
<p>For some years before his departure for South Africa he had followed racing
from one course to another. Though he had never done anything deliberately
dishonest, he was up to every dodge, always seemed to have money in his pocket,
and was invariably well dressed. The fact that his mother had belonged to one
of the leading Romany tribes Phillips found greatly to his advantage. He was
never above passing the time of day with such nomads as he encountered, and
more than once had benefited by this politeness. Had he ever wanted a useful
and faithful tool, something uncommonly smart in the way of a human ferret, he
knew where to put his hand on such a person. Strange as it may seem, there was
never a great fraud connected with the turf that was not freely whispered
amongst its humble followers long before it reached the ears of the
authorities. More than once Phillips had listened to the outline of a story
which would have astonished the magnates of the Jockey Club if they could have
heard it. And it was by such means that he had managed to pick up the threads
of a plot which, before long, seemed likely to promise sensational disclosures.
It was an additional satisfaction to Phillips to know that the main persons in
this plot were his old enemies Raymond Copley and Foster. He had followed up
the clues in his patient way, and at last had something really definite to go
upon.</p>
<p>It might be inferred that Phillips already had these two in the hollow of
his hand. But he had learnt patience in the hard school of adversity, and had
no intention of throwing away the chance of making money for the mere sake of
revenge. At any moment he might have pricked the glittering bubble which Copley
had blown, and laid both scoundrels by the heels in gaol, but that would have
entailed loss of time and a considerable sojourn in South Africa, without any
material return beyond that of triumph over his enemies. Now he was beginning
to see a way to crush both Copley and Foster, and fill his own pockets at the
same time.</p>
<p>He was not without his peculiar code of honour. Harry Fielden had defended
him at one time and he was not going to forget it. Fielden would have been
astonished to learn how much Phillips knew about his affairs. He knew, for
instance, all about May Haredale. He knew that Copley was infatuated with the
girl and was prepared to go any lengths to make her his wife. He knew too,
pretty well what was in old Raffle's mind, and chuckled as he thought of it.
And now the time had come to fire the first shot.</p>
<p>He turned out of his lodgings on a sunny Friday in February, and made his
way to Russell Square. He was more carefully dressed than usual and wore a
dark, quiet-looking suit, with a grey overcoat and felt hat. His gloves were
neat, his boots well polished, and, save the horseshoe pin in his white cravat,
there was no suggestion of the racing man about him. He turned presently into
Kelly Street, and, knocking at the door of a certain house, asked for Major
Carden. The Major, he was informed, was just finishing breakfast, but would see
Mr. Phillips.</p>
<p>It was the usual room in a lodging-house&mdash;shabby Axminster carpet,
dingy horsehair furniture, with the inevitable lustres on the mantelpiece. The
tablecloth was none too clean, though on it was a vase or two of flowers,
tastefully arranged. At one end of the table sat a stout pink-faced person with
a carefully-trimmed grey moustache. He was a typical specimen of the retired
military man, bluff and hearty in manner, with a pair of faded grey eyes
faintly tinged with pink. Evidently, too, he had been accustomed to mix with
the best people, as he would have phrased it himself. Probably, he still
belonged to a good club, and no doubt found it exceedingly difficult to make
both ends meet.</p>
<p>The second person at the breakfast table was an exceedingly pretty girl, who
looked none the less refined and attractive because her black dress was of the
plainest. She was chattering gaily as Phillips came in. She appeared to have a
proper respect and affection for her father, whose words she seemed to hang
upon. The Major looked up from the table and nodded genially.</p>
<p>"You are punctual, Phillips," he said. "I am afraid I am a little late this
morning. Alice, my dear, this is Mr. Phillips. He is the distinguished
journalist I was telling you about last night. We are both connected with the
same papers."</p>
<p>As the Major spoke, he winked swiftly at Phillips, and the latter smiled.
What the Major was driving at he hadn't the remotest idea.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," he murmured. "The Major and I are old friends."</p>
<p>The girl smiled pleasantly. She appeared a trifle shy, and gave Phillips the
impression that she had no friends, and that her young life was, for the most
part, a constant sacrifice for her selfish and dissipated father. She rose
presently, and with an excuse left the two men together. Immediately she was
gone the Major crossed the room and produced a bottle of brandy, from which he
helped himself liberally. Phillips curtly refused.</p>
<p>"I met some old friends last night," the Major said. "I am afraid I was just
a little&mdash;well, you know how it is."</p>
<p>"I do," Phillips said shortly. "But what did you tell that lie for? What
have we got to do with journalism?"</p>
<p>"My dear sir, there are times when one must dissemble. I know I am a bit of
an old scamp, but, you see, my daughter doesn't know it. I wouldn't for worlds
like her to know the life I am leading. She is a good girl and believes in me,
and I have managed to give her a fine education. She is the only thing I have
in the world to care for. She is the only thing that has kept me from going
headlong to the dogs. I daresay when I am done with, some of my relations will
look after her. Meanwhile, they take precious good care to keep me at arm's
length. I don't blame them, either. I hit upon the journalistic dodge to
account for my late hours. I was afraid you might give me away. I am bound to
tell you this, and I hope you will respect my confidence. Well, now, what do
you want me for? Sit down a minute."</p>
<p>"I have come to put a little money in your way," Phillips replied. "I gave
you a hint of what I was after the night before last. They tell me you are a
member of the Post Club."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," Carden replied. "I have managed, somehow or other, to keep myself
on the club books. Not that I go to the Post very much, because I can't afford
it. If I meet a young friend occasionally who is anxious to see life, I take
him there to lunch, on the strict understanding, of course, that he repays
me."</p>
<p>"Then I want you to take me there. I would like to lunch there to-day, and I
wish you to introduce me to Mr. Rickerby, the commission agent. It is a very
simple matter. If you can bring this about and get me half an hour's
conversation with Rickerby after lunch, I'll give you a tenner and pay for the
lunch besides. There's no risk and no responsibility as far as you are
concerned."</p>
<p>The Major pondered the matter.</p>
<p>"What are you up to?" he asked presently.</p>
<p>"That," Phillips said, "is no business of yours. But I assure you that I am
up to nothing wrong. Nothing I can say or do will get you into trouble. I don't
mind telling you there is a big swindle on foot to rob the leading bookmakers
and commission agents and I am trying to expose it. If I do, there will be a
good round sum of money for me, and if I fail, I shall be none the worse off.
Now, are you game?"</p>
<p>The Major smiled. At that moment ten-pound notes were scarce, and Phillips'
offer came in the nature of a windfall. But it was not part of his diplomacy to
accept the suggestion too eagerly.</p>
<p>"I think so," he said. "I don't see why I shouldn't accommodate you.
Perhaps, later, you might have something else to put in my way."</p>
<p>"Very well, then," Phillips replied. "I need not detain you now. I'll meet
you at the club at half-past one."</p>
<h2><a id="chap14" name="chap14">XIV. THE POST CLUB</a></h2>
<p class="first">There are several smart betting clubs in London, but none
smarter or more up-to-date than the Post Club. Like most institutions of the
kind, it is somewhat mixed and largely devoted to the purposes of gambling. All
sorts and conditions of men can be met there, from the magnates of the turf
down to small bookmakers. At the same time the subscription is a heavy one and
the entrance fee large. It is so large, indeed, that the police have never been
bold enough to raid the club, which is conducted on the best principles.
Betting on the tape goes on to an enormous extent, and there on most afternoons
of the racing season nearly all the chief commission agents can be found. The
club premises consist of a billiard-room, dining-room, and smoking-room, the
last fitted with several tape machines, which bring the result of the day's
racing directly from the course. Great wagers are constantly being made and
sometimes enormous bets effected even after the horses have been dispatched by
the starter.</p>
<p>Till after lunch the club is very quiet as a rule. On the first day of the
Mirst Park Meeting not more than half a dozen racing men were in the
dining-room. At a little table near the door sat the Major and his guest,
discussing a dainty luncheon to the accompaniment of a choice brand of
champagne. The Major was beaming. This was a pastime after his own heart, and
seeing that the luncheon was costing him nothing he was doing the thing very
lavishly indeed. There was something almost regal in the way he spoke to the
waiters. His manner was bland and florid, and, beyond all was the consciousness
of the five-pound note in his pocket which Phillips had given him to pay for
the repast. They sat for some little time, when the door was flung violently
open and a large man in an impossible waistcoat came into the dining-room.</p>
<p>Full-bodied and scarlet, he had an air of prosperity and in an aggressive
way suggested money. Most persons in the sporting world were familiar with that
huge personage in the striking waistcoat, for it was none other than Mr.
Rickerby, of a firm of turf accountants, who advertised that they recognized no
limit. In early life Mr. Rickerby, or Rick, as his friends styled him, had been
a butcher. He had failed at that principally because he spent most of his time
backing horses or arranging prize-fights. After he had passed through the
Bankruptcy Court he began with a small silver book and, having a real genius
for figures, together with a striking presence, an enormous voice and amazing
audacity which amounted almost to simplicity, he soon made headway in his new
profession. In a short time he took a partner who had been a smart accountant,
and now had a suite of palatial offices in the Strand, where he kept a large
staff of clerks, and where telephone messages were pouring in almost day and
night. Rickerby was a leviathan, and though he by no means despised the small
fish that came into his net, revelled in big bets and dramatic wagers.</p>
<p>He nodded to the Major with a mixture of insolent familiarity and fawning
politeness. Occasionally the Major was of use to him. Besides, Carden was well
connected and Mr. Rickerby had a profound admiration for the aristocracy. He
would have passed on only, at a sign from Phillips, Carden detained him.</p>
<p>"Come and lunch with us, Rickerby," he said. "Try this new brand of
champagne. Waiter, lay a place for Mr. Rickerby. Bring another bottle. No, on
second thoughts, you had better bring a magnum. Rickerby, let me introduce my
friend Mr. Phillips. He is just home from the Cape."</p>
<p>Rickerby touched an imaginary forelock.</p>
<p>"Proud to make your acquaintance, sir," he said. "Do you do anything in our
line?"</p>
<p>"Well, I have," Phillips said. "I used to follow racing closely enough
before I left England. Out yonder, from my point of view, I found something
better. Still, there is nothing so fascinating as the great game. I daresay I
shall make a wager or two before the season is over. I suppose one can't make
bets here?"</p>
<p>"Not unless you are a member," the Major explained. "The committee are most
particular about that kind of thing. They must think of the police. But I've no
doubt Rickerby will be glad to accommodate you."</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir," Rickerby said. "Up to any amount you like. The Major's
introduction is good enough for me, and a telegram or letter will always
receive attention."</p>
<p>Gradually the conversation became more general. Luncheon was a thing of the
past, and cigars and coffee had been set out in the smoking-room. Phillips
seemed to find Rickerby a mine of interesting information, for he plied him
with diplomatic questions. Under the influence of the champagne and brandy
Rickerby expanded.</p>
<p>"Swindles, my dear sir!" he exclaimed. "There is no end to them. We drop on
a dozen dodges every year of which the public know nothing. Why don't we
prosecute? Because it isn't worth while, and the police are not sympathetic.
Moreover, why should we let the public know of ways and means by which they
might rob us? Ah, I could tell you of one or two men, and big men, too, in some
of the West End clubs who would find themselves in a pretty tight place if some
of us only liked to open our mouths. But what's the use? Why throw good money
after bad?"</p>
<p>"But don't you get done?" Phillips asked.</p>
<p>"Well, very rarely," Rickerby responded, "but there are others in the club,
who seem to me to lay themselves out for that sort of thing. There's a chap
here called Selwyn, a rich young Australian fool, who thinks he knows
everything. He's just the type of mark that the broken-down racing man prays
for. He's in the hands of one or two here who are robbing him of thousands.
He's soft enough to make bets five minutes after a race has been run. I've
tipped him a hint once or twice, but bless you, it's no use. It is waste of
breath to tell Selwyn that the men in whose hands he is are manipulating the
telephone or wire and always betting on a dead certainty. One or two of the
bets have been offered to me, but I am not taking any. I daresay you may think
I ought to expose these people, but I've got something better to do."</p>
<p>"I should like to ask you one question," Phillips said. "Have you noticed by
any chance if the people you are speaking about are particularly lucky in their
bets on races run at Mirst Park?"</p>
<p>Rickerby looked admiringly at the speaker.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, "you know more than I gave you credit for, but perhaps
you are in the habit of studying this kind of thing. Now I come to think of it,
I do recollect hearing it said that Selwyn had dropped a lot of money to these
men last Mirst Park Meeting. If you really know anything, Mr. Phillips, I think
you ought to say so."</p>
<p>"Oh, I won't go quite so far as that," Phillips said modestly; "it's only an
idea that occurred to me which I was reminded of by something I read when I was
in South Africa. But mightn't this be a coincidence?"</p>
<p>"I think not," Rickerby replied, "you could hardly say that of a series of
bets in which Selwyn always loses and which are never made till after the race
is run."</p>
<p>"Extraordinary," Phillips said. "But I can't see how it can be anything more
than a mere coincidence. I suppose you do a tremendous lot of late
betting."</p>
<p>"My dear sir, that is exactly what the club is for. Some of us wouldn't be
able to live without it. But, all the same, we don't bet a second after the
official time of starting."</p>
<p>By this time the smoking-room was filling up rapidly. Two or three score of
men had come mainly to hear the result of the afternoon's racing and to make
their bets up to the very last moment that wagers were accepted. Phillips,
apparently perfectly satisfied with what he had heard, lounged in one corner
smoking a cigar, watching the crowd of sportsmen keenly out of the corner of
his eye. He seemed to have one glance, too, for the weather outside, which had
changed somewhat, for the sky was overcast and flakes of snow were falling. A
little later the room was almost in darkness and the whole world seemed to be
lost in a white drift. The clock over the mantelpiece pointed to nearly twenty
minutes past three. The result of the three o'clock race had been announced,
and, so far as Phillips could tell, there had not been one sensational incident
in the way of a bet.</p>
<p>"Your friend Selwyn is evidently not present to-day," Phillips observed, as
Rickerby dropped into a seat by his side.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, he is," the bookmaker retorted.</p>
<p>"That's very interesting," Phillips said. "I wish you would introduce me to
Mr. Selwyn. I think a little later I shall be able to show him a way of saving
money."</p>
<h2><a id="chap15" name="chap15">XV. JOLLY &amp; CO</a></h2>
<p class="first">Phillips slipped out of the club by and by, and for a while
walked up and down opposite, studying the building in which the Post Club was
situated. It was a large block of offices on five or six floors, mostly given
over to merchants and dealers whose business was in connexion with Covent
Garden Market. Moving up and down as if waiting for a friend, Phillips was
making an exceedingly careful scrutiny of the building.</p>
<p>"It isn't as easy as I thought it was at first," he said. "I've got a pretty
shrewd idea, for which I have in the main to thank that snowstorm. It is
evident that Rickerby is perfectly right, and that there is some cunning plot
afoot to rob this Selwyn. I wonder whether Rickerby was alluding to Raymond
Copley. It can't be anybody else. Now it is clear the gang cannot make late
bets during a snowstorm or thick mist or anything of that kind. I should like
to know how they manage to get the name of the winner into the club before the
horse is past the post. But that I must leave for the present. The point I have
to find out now is how the man upstairs who comes to do the betting gets his
information. If there was another block of buildings opposite the club I could
understand it, because it would be easy to signal from one window to another.
But there's nothing opposite except the Market with a lot of porters hanging
about, and I don't suppose they have anything to do with it. The puzzle beats
me for the moment. Still, having got so far, it is hard if I can't get to the
bottom of it. The signal must come from somewhere in the block of buildings
where the club is situated. Well, that gives me something to go on with anyhow,
and I haven't much time to spare, especially as I must meet Fielden to-morrow
at Mirst Park. I suppose there is only one thing to do, and that is to find out
the name and occupation of every firm which has an office under the roof. The
first thing I need is a Post Office Directory."</p>
<p>With the aid of this book he managed to winnow down the doubtful firms to
five or six. The rest he found were established houses engaged in legitimate
trade, the others being more or less new-comers whose callings were rather
nondescript. By a stroke of good fortune, just before five o'clock Phillips
obtained the assistance of a clerk in a fruit concern, whose firm was in the
block of buildings in which the club was housed, and the doubtful firms were
reduced to two. Standing outside looking up at the club, the windows of which
were now in darkness, Phillips saw that next door were a couple of windows
bearing on their wire blinds the legend, Jolly &amp; Co. There was a light
behind the blinds, so that the lettering stood out clear and distinct.</p>
<p>"I think I am getting on," Phillips commented. "Now, how am I going to find
out about Jolly &amp; Co.? It is a bit too dangerous to ask casually for Mr.
Jolly. But, stop. Most of the people have left, and it is any odds the light
has been used by the charwoman who is cleaning out the offices. It won't do any
harm to go up and see."</p>
<p>Phillips put his plan into execution. He came at length to the second floor,
and stopped at a door at the end of the passage which led to the rooms occupied
by the Post Club. On the door the name of Jolly &amp; Co. was painted in white
letters. From behind it came the sound of scrubbing. Phillips entered boldly.
The room was furnished as an office. There were a table and a chair or two, and
in a corner an American roll-top desk. Beside the desk was a telephone which,
from its glittering newness, had not been long erected. Attached to the
receiver in the place of the usual short flex was a cord at least eight or nine
feet long. It was a small matter in itself, but it did not escape Phillips'
keen glance. He wondered what it was for. It was certain that it was not
attached to the receiver by accident.</p>
<p>In one part of the room an old woman was kneeling down scrubbing the
floorcloth.</p>
<p>"Is Mr. Jolly here?" Phillips asked.</p>
<p>"No, sir," was the reply. "He went away early. I saw the key of the office
hanging up soon after half-past three."</p>
<p>Phillips smiled. He was beginning to understand now. There had been
snowstorms most of the afternoon at intervals, and this, no doubt, had
interfered with the campaign against the bookmakers.</p>
<p>"That is very annoying," Phillips said. "I particularly want to see Mr.
Jolly. I have some very important business with him. Can you tell me where he
lives?"</p>
<p>The old woman shook her head emphatically.</p>
<p>"No, I can't, sir," she said. "I haven't any idea where he lives. And,
besides, he is mostly a stranger to me."</p>
<p>"He hasn't been here long, then?"</p>
<p>"No, sir. He came last autumn and, of course, I does for him like I do for
the other gentlemen. He stayed till about the end of November, then he told me
he had to go abroad for the winter. He has only been back about a week."</p>
<p>Phillips thought his time was not being wasted. Everything appeared to be
going his way.</p>
<p>"I am very sorry," he said, "but, really, I must find him. It is most
awkward, seeing that he is a stranger to me. Would you mind telling me what he
is like? If you can give me a description of him I might make inquiries in the
neighbourhood. It is possible he may be in one of the hotels close by playing
billiards or something of that sort."</p>
<p>"Well, that's possible," the old woman said. "I know Mr. Jolly is fond of a
game of billiards, because my little boy has had to fetch him once or twice. He
is young and clean-shaven, looks like a boy almost till you get close to him,
and then you can see what a lot of wrinkles he has round his eyes. He might
easily be mistaken for an actor. Dresses very well, he does, except he wears a
steel watch-chain."</p>
<p>Phillips gave the old woman a shilling and departed. He had found out all he
was likely to discover. He had already moved towards the door when a sudden
thought struck him.</p>
<p>"Oh, by the way," he said, "I wish you would let me have the number of your
telephone. If I can't come here again I shall telephone Mr. Jolly in the
morning."</p>
<p>The old woman intimated that the number was on the top of the telephone, and
Phillips made a note of it. Then he went away, on the whole very well satisfied
with his afternoon's work. He had yet, however, to verify a certain suspicion,
and this he could not accomplish till late in the evening. It was eight o'clock
or more before he turned into a public telephone call-office and rang up the
number which he had copied in Jolly's office. He was not surprised to find that
he received no reply, but it was not a reply he was after. What he really
wanted was to get in connexion with the Exchange. He managed this presently. It
was growing late, and there was no great pressure upon the office.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to trouble you," he said, "but I can't get anything from this
number. Can you tell me if Mr. Jolly has a wire between the office and his
house?"</p>
<p>The assistant amiably replied she would ascertain. In a few moments she
spoke again.</p>
<p>"No wonder you couldn't get a reply," she said. "Jolly &amp; Co. are not
connected with the Exchange at all. We switch them on by arrangement for
business purposes, but their wire is a private one. It has only been recently
erected."</p>
<p>Phillips drew a sharp breath. He was expecting sensational developments, but
this information fairly staggered him.</p>
<p>"I am much obliged to you," he said. "But I am very anxious to get on to Mr.
Jolly. You say the wire is a private one. I suppose it goes from the office to
Mr. Jolly's own house. Where is that?"</p>
<p>"His place is called The Nook, Mirst Park."</p>
<p>Once more Phillips was taken aback. The whole plot was opening up before his
eyes. Many important matters remained to be cleared up, but he felt he was
getting on with a vengeance.</p>
<p>"I didn't know where he lived," he said, "but many thanks for this
information and all the trouble you have taken. Would you mind putting me in
connexion with the Nook?"</p>
<p>The assistant was still obliging. For the best part of five minutes Phillips
stood there with the receiver at his ear, and the longer he had to wait the
more satisfied he appeared to be. Then, presently, the thin voice at the other
end of the wire began to speak to him again.</p>
<p>"I am very sorry," she said. "But I have rung half a dozen times and can't
make anybody hear. Probably they have left the receiver off the instrument. I
can try again presently."</p>
<p>"A thousand thanks," Phillips said. "But I won't trouble you. I'll call
round at the office in the morning. What a stroke of luck! Now for Mirst
Park."</p>
<h2><a id="chap16" name="chap16">XVI. THE NOOK</a></h2>
<p class="first">On second thoughts, Phillips deemed it more prudent to remain
in town overnight. There would be no difficulty in reaching Mirst Park
to-morrow in time to open his campaign. Besides, when he came to think it over
there were a good many things yet to be done. He ate his modest dinner in his
modest lodgings and then sat down over a cigarette to think out the result of
his day's work. The more he cogitated the more satisfied he was with his rate
of progress.</p>
<p>He had got past the age when a man burns for revenge and that sort of thing.
He infinitely preferred to make Copley smart and put money in his own pocket at
the same time. As for his diamond-mining adventure, he expected to hear no more
of that. He had been robbed of his precious plans and had no hopes of seeing
his missing portmanteau again, but, like a prudent man, he was not inclined to
cry over spilt milk.</p>
<p>He had thought it all out before morning, and shortly after ten o'clock set
out to call upon Major Carden again. To his surprise he found that the Major
had already breakfasted and was making preparations for going out. A big fur
coat was carelessly thrown across an arm-chair, and Phillips smiled when he saw
it. Probably the Major had struck a prosperous line. Possibly some of the
ten-pound note had been laid out at an adjacent pawnbroker's.</p>
<p>"I didn't expect to see you this morning," the Major said genially. "Most
infernally cold, isn't it? Looks like snow, too. Still, one must take the rough
with the smooth when one goes racing."</p>
<p>"So you are going racing?"</p>
<p>"Well, I had thought of it. I don't often get the chance of treating myself,
and my idea was to run down to Mirst Park this afternoon. You're going, aren't
you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I am going down on business. But I wanted you to stay in town and
do a little commission for me."</p>
<p>The Major's florid face fell.</p>
<p>"That is very awkward," he muttered. "You see, I promised to take my
daughter with me. She is fonder of that kind of thing than I am, and the poor
child seldom has an outing. In the old days of my prosperity Alice had her own
horse, and deuced good across country she was. Can't you manage to put it off
till to-morrow, Phillips? I shall be greatly obliged if you can."</p>
<p>Phillips reflected for a moment.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said. "I daresay it can be managed. I will see you on the
course this afternoon and let you know what my address is. If you are discreet
and cautious over this little matter there is a fair sum of money in it for
you. You can drop me a note to-night, because there is no pressing hurry, and
you can get the information this evening or early to-morrow. What you have to
do is to go round to the Post Club and find out all the heavy bets which were
made there with Selwyn in connexion with to-day's racing at Mirst Park. You
must let me know with whom the bets were made and who made them. I think that
is all. But I shall see you on the course later, and if anything crops up in
the meantime I shall let you know."</p>
<p>There was nothing to prevent Phillips from making his way to Mirst Park.
Half an hour later he took train from Waterloo and, arrived at his destination,
proceeded to look out for lodgings. He had his own reasons for preferring rooms
to an hotel. He needed to keep himself as quiet as possible. This matter
satisfactorily settled, he turned his steps to the course, which was as yet
practically deserted. There was little to indicate that a race meeting was in
progress, excepting the shows and roundabouts and booths outside the stands and
paddocks. There were the usual loafers picnicking on the grass, the usual
litter of torn betting-tickets and papers scattered far and wide. Phillips
passed along, looking eagerly about him. He wanted somebody who could give him
certain information. He stood on the centre of the course, some four or five
hundred yards from the ring. He appeared to be admiring the landscape, which
was pleasant enough under the brilliant sunshine, though this was interspersed
now and then by ominous-looking clouds which seemed to threaten snow later.</p>
<p>As most people know, Mirst Park course is situated in a kind of theatre,
with rising ground behind the stands, so that it is possible for everybody to
obtain a perfect view of a race from start to finish. Peeping out of the trees
here and there were a few good-class houses, one of which, standing higher than
the rest, towered over the top of the grand stand. There was the suggestion of
a smile on Phillips' face as he adjusted his racing-glasses and made a close
inspection of the house in question. He could see that it possessed a flat roof
with a parapet around it. Phillips was still intent upon his examination when a
policeman with a fine air of detachment strolled by.</p>
<p>"The best natural course I have ever seen," Phillips said with enthusiasm.
"Have you got many like this in these parts, officer?"</p>
<p>"Not that I know of," the policeman said. "I suppose you have never been
here before."</p>
<p>"I am from South Africa," Phillips said. "We've got nothing like this out
there. I should like to have one of those houses yonder. It must be nice to sit
in your own house and be able to watch all the races, especially in weather
like this. Now there's that place at the back of the stand. I suppose you know
who that belongs to. Some man with money, I expect?"</p>
<p>"I can't tell you, sir," the policeman replied. "I've lived here most of my
life, but that house yonder has been empty for a long time. I understood it was
taken by some Colonial gentleman last autumn, but I don't think he has been in
it yet. Of course, I don't know for certain, because my beat is on the other
side of the Common, and I am only on duty here on race days."</p>
<p>"Just so. What is the name of the house?"</p>
<p>"Let me see," the policeman said, reflectively. "Oh, I know. I think they
call it The Nook."</p>
<p>The officer passed on, and Phillips replaced the racing-glasses in their
case. Fortune was still on his side. He made his way through the woods up into
the road which ran in front of the houses, and came at length to a pair of iron
gates with the name of the house, The Nook, painted on them in gilt letters.
The place appeared to be fairly well looked after. The paths were trim, but, so
far as Phillips could see, there was little traffic through the gates and no
sign whatever of wheels, either of cabs or motors. Peering through the shrubs,
he noticed that the windows were fitted with curtains and blinds as if the
house were inhabited. There was, perhaps, some risk in what Phillips was about
to do, but he was prepared to take the consequences. He walked briskly up the
drive until he came in front of the house. Most of the blinds were up. He saw
evidences of refinement and luxury in the blinds and curtains, though it struck
him as rather significant that the gardens had not had much attention bestowed
upon them. Phillips hesitated before ringing the bell. It was an old-fashioned
bell, with a drop-handle, and he could hear it clanging through the house with
a hollow sound which suggested emptiness. As he expected, no reply came, though
he rang two or three times. It was impossible for any one to see into the
living-rooms, for the house was built upon a slope and the front door was
approached by a flight of steps. Just as Phillips was turning away a man
emerged from behind a belt of shrubs, followed by a truculent-looking
bull-terrier. He looked like a gardener, though there was in his appearance
that faint, intangible something which suggested a close familiarity with the
turf. He eyed Phillips sourly and suspiciously, and none too politely requested
to know his business.</p>
<p>"Are you employed here?" Phillips asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am," the man growled. "I am the gardener. And there's no one at
home, if you want to know."</p>
<p>Phillips' assumption of annoyance was artistic. He turned away
impatiently.</p>
<p>"Then Mr. Ronaldson is not here now?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Never heard the name," the gardener responded.</p>
<p>"But he used to live here. I knew him well in South Africa. He gave me his
address two years ago and asked me to look him up if ever I came to England. I
suppose he has gone somewhere else then. Do you happen to know the name?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't," the gardener said sulkily. "We've only been here a few
months, and my master hasn't come into the house yet. He's a stranger, too. You
had better make inquiries in the village."</p>
<p>Phillips expressed his thanks. He had found out pretty well all he wanted to
know, and felt that if this repellent person had entertained any suspicions
they were lulled to sleep by this time. He stood examining the
repulsive-looking bull-terrier. He alluded to the animal's points approvingly.
He spoke, too, as a man who knew what he was talking about. One or two remarks
elicited the assent of the gruff gardener, who smiled slightly.</p>
<p>"Yes, he's a good dog," he said. "And capital in the house."</p>
<p>"Keeps the burglars away," Phillips laughed.</p>
<p>"Oh, I daresay he would if I left him here. But I don't live on the
premises. I only look round to see that things are all right. I believe the
servants are coming in next week."</p>
<p>"But why not have a caretaker?" Phillips asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, there's no occasion for that. They're more trouble than they're
worth."</p>
<p>Phillips nodded and walked leisurely away.</p>
<h2><a id="chap17" name="chap17">XVII. A FAIR DAY'S SPORT</a></h2>
<p class="first">At Mirst Park there was not very much for Fielden to do. The
horses he had brought with him were a moderate lot, and, in the words of the
stud-groom, there was not a racer amongst them. With his intimate knowledge of
horse-flesh Fielden wondered why Copley kept such an indifferent stable, and
where he got his animals. They were even worse than the ordinary run of equine
rubbish usually foisted on the millionaire whose ambition it is to figure as a
patron of the turf. Perhaps the whole thing was a blind. Perhaps the stud at
Seton Manor was merely intended to cover Copley's rascality in another
direction. At any rate, Fielden watched the first two races with mingled
feelings of contempt and amusement. He had seen his employer's horses figure in
both in the sorriest fashion, and till the four o'clock race was free to do as
he pleased.</p>
<p>It was strange to move about the paddock, by the weighing-room and on the
stand, rubbing shoulders with a score of men whom he knew well. The course was
familiar to him, too. Were the past two years but a dream, and had he never
left the scene of his former recreations? But no one recognized him. He
strolled about listening to the roar of the betting-ring and the cries of the
multitude, or threaded his way in and out among the horses. He even spoke to
one or two jockeys whom he had once known, but none seemed to identify him.</p>
<p>Despite the crowd and the horses, the ladies on the stand and the members in
the enclosure, however, it was a lonely business, and his face lightened as he
caught sight of May Haredale seated by herself on one of the stands. He made
his way eagerly to her side. She turned and smiled upon him. There was a
healthy flush on her face. Her eyes were sparkling, and yet there was a
suspicion of anxiety about her which Fielden had noticed more than once
lately.</p>
<p>"Why are you alone?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, it has only been the last few minutes," May explained. "We have a colt
running in this race, and my father has gone to give instructions to his
jockey. By the way, how badly your horses have cut up to-day. No, I am not
particularly interested in this race, and I haven't so much as a pair of gloves
on it."</p>
<p>"Then what do you say to a stroll?" Fielden suggested. "It is cold, and we
look like having another fall of snow. I couldn't see the three o'clock race
for the snow. Positively I hadn't the faintest notion what had won till I saw
the numbers go up. Let us walk across the course to the starting-point and
back. We shall have plenty of time."</p>
<p>May consented, and soon they were beyond the enclosure and past the white
posts and rails towards the patch of gorse across the Downs, where the starter
was already fidgeting about on his cob. Away from the noise and excitement of
the ring the flush faded from May's face, and her eyes seemed inexpressibly
sad.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" Fielden asked anxiously. "We all change as we grow
older. I suppose I am different from what I used to be. But I don't like to see
you so quiet. It is so foreign to your nature, May. There was a time when you
were all laughter and sunshine. Oh, dear, what a fool I have been, to be sure.
How different things might have been if I had only had a little common sense.
You don't know how I blame myself."</p>
<p>"Were you altogether to blame?" May asked. "I don't think so. You had no one
to look after you from the time you were at school till you came into your
property. You were merely a boy then, and you behaved like one."</p>
<p>"Oh, I know, I know," Fielden sighed. "But that's all past and done with.
But don't talk about me. I am far more interested in you. I hope nothing has
happened to increase your anxiety. You know what I mean."</p>
<p>May looked irresolutely at her companion.</p>
<p>"I ought not, perhaps, to tell you," she said. "I ought not to tell anybody.
But, then, well, you are Harry Fielden, and I have known you all my life. If
you didn't care for me quite as much as you do, if I had not cared for
you&mdash;but, there, we need not go into that. It is my father who has worried
me. It is extraordinary what a change has come over him lately. He used to be
so kind to me, to let me do as I liked, and even when we were so poor that we
didn't know where to turn for money he was always happy and cheerful. Why, a
few months ago he would have laughed at the idea of my marrying a man like Mr.
Copley. Now he is almost eager for it."</p>
<p>Fielden made no reply for a moment. A wave of indignation came over him. He
caught his lip between his teeth and bit it fiercely. A year or two ago he
would have smiled at the suggestion that Sir George would sanction a match
between his daughter and a man like Copley. But during the hard and bitter
months of his wanderings he had learnt some amount of cynical wisdom. He was no
longer inclined, as he had been in the old days, to take every man at his face
valuation. And, no doubt, when the pinch came, Sir George was just like the
rest. He would speak loudly enough of his willingness to give up the old house
and live in humble lodgings rather than have any slur cast upon his honour. But
it would be different when this pretty theory came to be put to the test.
Fielden forgot all about the racecourse. He heard nothing of the shouting
crowd. The horses streaming to the post conveyed nothing to his eye.</p>
<p>"I want you to be candid with me," he said. "Is Sir George putting pressure
upon you to marry that blackguard?"</p>
<p>There was something so vehement in Fielden's speech that May looked at him
in astonishment.</p>
<p>"Surely you are going too far," she said. "Mr. Copley is not a gentleman, of
course&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I tell you, he is a scoundrel," Fielden interrupted. "Believe me, May, I
would not have spoken unless I had been bound to. That man is not fit to go
into any respectable house. I cannot say more than that at present, because the
secret is not altogether mine. But this much I tell you: Had there been no such
person as Raymond Copley I should be a rich man at the present moment. I know
that, but for the merest accident, there would be blood on that man's hands.
You must not marry him, May. You must not give him the slightest encouragement.
When I think of your associating with that rascal my blood boils. If the worst
comes to the worst, I must tell Sir George what I know myself. It is with the
greatest reluctance I entered Copley's employment; indeed, I only did so
because there are certain things I want to find out and this seemed to provide
a favourable opportunity. Otherwise, I would rather get my living by selling
race-cards and sleep under a furze bush. But do you mean to say your father
really insists on this?"</p>
<p>A rush of tears filled May's eyes.</p>
<p>"That is what it comes to," she rejoined. "It is only the last two days that
I have noticed such a change in my father. Harry, do you think it is as bad as
he says it is? He tells me that unless I consent to marry Mr. Copley we shall
be ruined and be turned out of the house without so much as a penny. It seems
incredible. I can't understand a man with an atom of self-respect who would
compel a girl to marry him against her will. It isn't as if I were rich, or
intellectual, or beautiful."</p>
<p>Harry thought he could understand. Indeed, any man could understand who
looked down into the pretty, pleading, anxious face that was turned up towards
Fielden.</p>
<p>"There is no accounting for people like Copley," he said. "He is the kind of
man that has not an atom of consideration for anybody but himself. He has no
heart or conscience, and the more unattainable a thing is the more he longs for
it. He cannot win you; therefore, you are the one thing in the world that he
passionately desires. God help the woman, however fascinating and beautiful,
who becomes Copley's wife! It would mean years of brutality and neglect and
self-contempt. You mustn't, May. I understand the duty you owe to your father,
but no man has a right to exact such a sacrifice as that. Don't you think I had
better see Sir George and give him a hint of the sort of man Copley is?"</p>
<p>May shook her head resolutely.</p>
<p>"I am afraid that would do more harm than good," she said. "I must fight my
battle alone, Harry, and if you interfered my father might forbid you Haredale
Park. He has already hinted that, if you had not come home again, I should have
been willing to become Mrs. Raymond Copley, and if I were not allowed to see
you I don't know what I should do. There is nobody else I could confide in. But
I will let you know how things go on. We had better go back. I feel better for
this confession."</p>
<p>But it seemed a hopeless business, and Fielden's face was sad and gloomy as
he strode alongside May towards the stand.</p>
<p>Ah! but hope was not dead yet.</p>
<h2><a id="chap18" name="chap18">XVIII. AN EVENING VISIT</a></h2>
<p class="first">For once Sir George Haredale did not seem to be in the least
pleased to see Fielden. He was standing on the lower steps of the stand talking
to Major Carden with the air of one who is conversing with an old acquaintance.
By Carden's side was his daughter, eager and interested, following all that was
going on around her with the zest and enjoyment of a child.</p>
<p>"Oh, here you are," Sir George said fussily. "I was beginning to wonder what
had become of you. Carden, this is my daughter. Major Carden and I were at Eton
together. We used to do a good deal of racing before you were born."</p>
<p>The Major took off his hat with a flourish.</p>
<p>"Charmed to meet the daughter of my old friend," he said, "charmed. Ah,
those were pleasant days when one had youth and strength and a banking account
which appeared to be inexhaustible. Now I deem myself fortunate if I can steal
a day off occasionally to get down to a suburban racecourse. Let me present you
to my daughter. My dear Alice&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But I know her already," May Haredale cried. "We were at school together. I
had no idea that my father and yours knew one another. I am so pleased to see
you again. Father, Alice Carden was my greatest friend all the years I was at
Eastbourne. We parted promising to write to one another regularly, but somehow
or another we have never corresponded. But now that I have met you I won't lose
sight of you any more. Major Carden, you really must let Alice come and stay at
Haredale Park with me. I want her for a long visit."</p>
<p>Carden professed himself to be delighted, and this in all sincerity. He
began to see visions of a snug and comfortable time, away from dingy lodgings
and vilely-cooked food to which he had never become accustomed. The two girls
paired off, and the Major strolled towards the paddock gates, for he had
noticed Phillips there, evidently waiting for a chance to speak to him.</p>
<p>"Got any instructions?" the Major asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing fresh," Phillips explained. "I want you to do exactly as I asked
you, and if you can manage it this evening, after you get back to town, so much
the better. I have written my address on the back of this card, and it is
possible I may be here for two or three days longer. I want you to find out
what wagering there was to big money with Selwyn at the Post Club to-day, and
wire to the address on this card. It is more than probable that, before the
week is out, I may be able to put a good thing in your way. I suppose I can
come round and see you whenever I like."</p>
<p>The Major thought that would be all right. It would be just as well,
perhaps, to get his daughter out of the way. With diplomacy he might contrive
to expedite the invitation to Haredale Park, so that he could have the ground
clear without fear of interruption. He returned to the place where his daughter
was waiting for him.</p>
<p>At a sign from Phillips, Fielden came forward.</p>
<p>"Well," he asked, "how are you getting on?"</p>
<p>"Splendidly," Phillips replied. "I have been far more fortunate than I
anticipated. We will get some fun out of Copley and Foster yet. From your point
of view I daresay you may think I am wrong. But I mean to make money out of
this. I will expose Copley and fill my purse at the same time. You wonder what
I am driving at? Can you manage to stay here over to-morrow?"</p>
<p>"I think so," Fielden said.</p>
<p>"That's good. In that case we can push our investigations farther and, with
any luck, before the week is out we shall not only know where Copley gets his
money, but how he makes it. Of course, we know that he doesn't even begin as a
millionaire; we know that he is an unscrupulous adventurer. But he has the
command of ready money, and we wish to know how he makes it. As a matter of
fact, I know that already. But there are a few weak points in my case, and we
can't make a definite move till these are cleared up. Now I want you to have
dinner with me in my lodgings. I told my landlady I might have a friend staying
with me, and she will be ready to put a bedroom at your disposal."</p>
<p>"Why this mystery?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, it is no mystery. I only want to interest you. After dark we shall
indulge in a little quiet burglary, that is, if you don't object."</p>
<p>"It is not an alluring prospect," Fielden said.</p>
<p>"Of course it isn't," Phillips agreed. "But when you are dealing with
scoundrels it is necessary to use their own weapons. I presume you are as
interested as I am in the exposure of Copley and Foster and all their
methods."</p>
<p>"Up to the hilt," Fielden said between his teeth. "Poor as I am, I would
give all I possess to bring that about. I would give five years of my life to
manage that between now and Derby Day. And if necessary I can find some money.
I am better off than I expected, but I intended to keep the money for a start
in life later. Still, if you want it and will promise to put it to a good use,
I will give you every farthing cheerfully. You have only to say the word."</p>
<p>Phillips chuckled.</p>
<p>"Oh, there's no occasion to do that, sir," he said. "Keep the money in your
pocket. I shall have enough and to spare before long. I mean to drag Copley's
plunder from between his teeth. I will take all I can get from him, and when
the time comes we shall drop a hint in the proper quarter, and there will be an
end to Raymond Copley. Within three months you will see that man in gaol. You
needn't be alarmed for Miss Haredale. She is as safe from that man as if she
were the daughter of the King. I had better be going, because it is as well
that we should not be seen talking together for too long. I have scribbled my
address on the back of this card, and shall expect you about half-past
seven."</p>
<p>Fielden asked no more questions, but returned to his friends with a vivid
sense of curiosity. He listened to Major Carden's flamboyant talk, and as he
bowed to Alice Carden could not help thinking what a pretty and refined girl
she was. He made his excuses for not returning to Haredale, and was faintly
amused to see how relieved Sir George appeared to be.</p>
<p>"No, I can't get back to-night," he explained. "I have several things to do
here. But I hope to see you on Sunday, if I may be allowed to come over."</p>
<p>"Of course, you may," May smiled, as she held out her hand. "Miss Carden is
coming to stay with me to-morrow. I have persuaded her to come at once. I am
ashamed to have neglected her so long."</p>
<p>Fielden finished his business, saw the stud-groom and the horses safely on
the rail, and then went to the retired part of the village where Phillips'
lodgings were situated. It was little more than a cottage, but the place was
neat and clean, and the cooking left nothing to be desired.</p>
<p>"It is only a bit of fish and a steak," Phillips said cheerfully, "but you
will find it beautifully served, and as to the wine, well, I got that myself,
and I know it is everything it should be. Please sit down and make yourself at
home. We can discuss matters over our cigars. There's nothing like racing to
give you an appetite. I only hope it won't snow before morning."</p>
<p>"I hope not," Fielden said. "To all intents and purposes the racing was
spoilt this afternoon by the snow, and it is very odd that no one saw a yard
from start to finish of the three o'clock race. It was most annoying."</p>
<p>"Was it?" Phillips asked. "Well, I confess I didn't find it so. Yesterday at
the time of the three o'clock race I was at the Post Club, and, singular to
say, we had the same blinding snowstorm in Covent Garden. Now it surprises you,
but from your point of view and mine that snowstorm was the most fortunate
thing that could have happened. When I sat smoking my cigar in the Post Club
there came to me the inspiration of a lifetime. I seemed to see in a flash
exactly what had happened, and soon I shall know to a dead certainty. You must
restrain your curiosity for a little longer. You will probably know all about
it before you go to bed. Try one of these cigars. They are excellent."</p>
<p>Fielden had hardly got his cigar aglow before the landlady came in with a
telegram, which Phillips opened eagerly. There was a smile of triumph on his
face as he handed it to Fielden.</p>
<p>"What do you make of that?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I can make nothing of it," Fielden said. "It is a wire to the effect that
no important wager was made this afternoon on the three o'clock race at the
Post Club, and is signed Carden. I presume that is our stout friend with the
florid face and ingratiating manner, who was talking to you this afternoon. But
how it helps us I haven't the ghost of an idea."</p>
<p>Phillips rose and threw his cigar in the fire.</p>
<p>"Come," he said. "It is time to start. You haven't much longer to wait."</p>
<h2><a id="chap19" name="chap19">XIX. THE EMPTY HOUSE</a></h2>
<p class="first">There was just enough moonlight for Phillips' purpose, but not
enough to render his task dangerous. Fielden asked no questions, partly because
he deemed it would be useless, and partly because he did not wish to spoil what
appeared to have in it the making of a dramatic adventure. His spirits were
rising, and he was looking forward keenly to something in the way of
enterprise. He and Phillips had been in more than one tight place together, and
he had every confidence in his companion.</p>
<p>They made their way along the main street in silence, and came presently to
the deserted racecourse. There was very little evidence of the afternoon's
sport, nothing but a few partially dismantled tents and booths, and the
extraordinary remnants of reeking humanity that always haunt a race
meeting.</p>
<p>They went across the heath, and by and by Phillips pulled up in front of the
avenue to The Nook.</p>
<p>"This is the place," he said quietly.</p>
<p>"Oh, is it?" Fielden asked. "Perhaps you had better tell me before we go
farther who lives here."</p>
<p>"That is precisely what we've come to find out," Phillips said coolly. "I've
got a pretty shrewd notion, but that isn't good enough for me. I've told you
that there's a gang of clever swindlers in England who have put their heads
together to rob the betting ring of an enormous sum of money. Operations began
last autumn, but the flat-racing was nearly finished, so that they did not make
quite such a haul as they had anticipated. Still, they made enough to keep
themselves in luxury all the winter and to find the necessary funds for
carrying on the campaign in the spring. It is a big combine, and unless
something is done to stop it, these people will make colossal fortunes. Mind
you, one or two of the large bookmakers have a suspicion, but up to now they
haven't been able to prove anything. Indeed, without egotism, I may say they
would be powerless without me. I got some vague idea of the scheme three years
ago from a man who is now dead. Then when racing began again this year I
fancied I could see a trace of the same idea in this business. I knew I was
right when I discovered that Copley was operating on a large scale. I lunched
at the Post Club with a member who gave me an introduction to Rickerby, the
financial agent. You remember him?"</p>
<p>"I ought to," Fielden said drily. "Goodness knows, his firm had enough of my
money. But go on."</p>
<p>"Well, I pumped Rickerby. I don't mind telling you that I went to the Post
Club on purpose. He has been pretty hard hit. He believes he has been the
victim of a swindle, and he is right, though it was no part of my policy at the
time to tell him so. He can't very well refuse to take big bets, even when he
feels there is something underhand going on. Only a short time ago he was hit
for some thousands of pounds by one of the gang, and, moreover, had to pay the
money."</p>
<p>"This sounds very interesting," Fielden said, "but what has it to do with
our present adventure?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am coming to that," Phillips went on quietly. "You see, these bets
are always made in the same way. One of the conspirators, who is actually a
member of the Post Club, strolls into the smoking-room some five or six minutes
before&mdash;well, we'll say before the three o'clock race. He hangs about till
the horses are about finishing and then, in the most casual way in the world,
makes a bet. Now, mind you, this bet is booked before the race is finished, as
a careful comparison of the time shows. Yet the horse has won, and the man in
the smoking-room of the Post Club knows it before the judge has given his
decision."</p>
<p>"Impossible," Fielden exclaimed.</p>
<p>"I know it seems impossible, and twenty years ago you would have said the
telephone was impossible, and people would have scouted the idea of wireless
telegraphy. But they both came, like the phonograph and other wonders."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all very well," Fielden smiled. "But you are not going to ask me
to believe that this thing is done by thought-reading or anything of that sort?
You won't tell me that this famous member of the Post Club is a clairvoyant who
sees the race finished while it is being run? Because, if that were the case,
the favoured person would have no need of a syndicate to help him; he would do
it all by himself."</p>
<p>"I am not suggesting anything of the kind," Phillips said. "There's nothing
occult about the business. The thing is capable of explanation, and I am in a
position to give it, except for the finishing touches, which make this dodge
almost a work of genius. I know who is at the bottom of it, I know who is
working it, and I know how the information is conveyed to within a few feet of
the tape machines in the Post Club. But how that information is filtered to the
man inside is the thing that beats me at present. But so much I have found out.
In the very next office to the smoking-room of the Post Club is a firm who call
themselves Jolly &amp; Co. Now Jolly &amp; Co. only took their office last
September or October. There is not the slightest sign of any business being
done there, because I have been in the office myself. Taken in conjunction with
what I have told you, it must strike you as an odd thing that this mysterious
Jolly &amp; Co. shut up the office and went abroad last year after the
flat-racing was over. Probably Jolly &amp; Co. went off to make a bit in the
Riviera, or Egypt, or some other fashionable resort where fools and money
congregate. It is an odd thing that during the January meeting at Mirst Park
Jolly &amp; Co. should turn up again and resume operations in Covent Garden.
Now I called to see Mr. Jolly. He had left his office, but I guessed that
before I called, or I shouldn't have ventured. The first thing I saw was a
telephone with an unusually long flex to it. I don't quite understand why this
flex is so long, but I can make a shrewd guess. It cost me an hour or two and
plenty of hard thinking to get farther in my investigations, but I found late
in the evening that Jolly &amp; Co.'s telephone was a private wire leading from
Covent Garden to his residence at Mirst Park. Now do you begin to
understand?"</p>
<p>Fielden shook his head.</p>
<p>"It begins to smell suspicious," he said. "I am bound to confess it looks
very like a deep-laid conspiracy. But I must confess myself too dense to follow
it."</p>
<p>"Oh, it requires explanation. But luck favoured me in my investigations, and
I managed to pick up a good many unlooked for clues. Still, the fact remains
that from this house here to an office next door to the Post Club there is a
private telephone. Now a child would admit that no one would have a private
telephone from here to an office in London, at a cost of something like a
hundred and fifty pounds a year, merely for the sake of sending domestic
messages. I came here to have a good look at The Nook, as this house is called,
and I found, not altogether unexpectedly, that nobody was living here. I was
told by a gardener that the tenant had not yet taken possession, though it has
been furnished for some time. I had rung the bell a few times, and when the man
came professed I had called to see some one who used to live here. Considering
that it is supposed to be a fully-furnished house, that bell made a great deal
of noise. I am ready to bet that the house is practically empty. At any rate, I
have come here to find out for myself, and as I believe there is nobody on the
premises our task ought not to be difficult."</p>
<p>"I don't like it," Fielden said. "It smells very much like burglary, and if
we were discovered we should find some difficulty in giving an explanation
which would satisfy the police. Isn't there any other way?"</p>
<p>Phillips waved the suggestion aside impatiently.</p>
<p>"You can go back if you like, sir," he said. "As for me, I will see this
thing through. We might never have such an opportunity again. And, besides, I
want to have a look at that telephone. I think we shall find something that
will open our eyes. I am not in a position actually to prove it, but I am
convinced that Jolly &amp; Co. will be found to be part and parcel of Copley
and Foster. Now you understand why I am so anxious to enter the house. Still,
if you prefer to remain outside and leave the matter to me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Fielden said hastily. "Having come so far I won't turn back. I am
taking it that you are correct in thinking the house is empty."</p>
<p>"Of course it is, there is no question about that. The gardener told me so,
and I see no reason to doubt his statement. I wouldn't miss this chance for
anything. Even if I get nothing out of it, I should like to know how this
swindle is being worked. But come along, we are wasting time. There is enough
moonlight to help us without using lights, which is so far fortunate. It may be
a little awkward for you, connected as you are with Copley, but it is all in
the game."</p>
<p>"Lead on," Fielden said curtly.</p>
<p>They turned into the avenue and came presently to the front of the house.
Somebody had evidently been in since Phillips' visit, for all the blinds had
been pulled down. Then they walked cautiously round, looking for a weak spot
where they could effect an entrance.</p>
<h2><a id="chap20" name="chap20">XX. INSIDE</a></h2>
<p class="first">The adventurers managed to squeeze through a scullery window,
the latch of which had not been secured, and a moment later were in the house.
As Phillips had surmised, the place was empty. There were, however, cooking
utensils in the kitchen, a quantity of plates and dishes and glass, with two
baskets containing a small supply of cutlery and silver. Floorcloth had been
laid down on the kitchen floor and a carpet in the hall, and there were carpets
on the stairs, but three of the four living-rooms on the ground floor were
empty. But the fourth room was comfortably furnished. A fire was still burning
in the grate, and on the tiled hearth Phillips detected the ends of two or
three cigarettes. There was a faint aroma of tobacco on the air, not the sort
of tobacco likely to be consumed by a caretaker.</p>
<p>"It is just as I told you," Phillips chuckled. "I felt sure we should find
the house empty."</p>
<p>"Yet you are not altogether right," Fielden replied. "Somebody has been here
recently, and somebody who knows how to appreciate a good cigarette. Besides,
look at that fire. I don't like it, Phillips, and wish we were well out of it.
We don't happen to be in South Africa now."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right," Phillips said cheerfully. "No doubt the fire was
lighted this morning by the gardener, and no doubt also one of the conspirators
has been here. In fact, I should have been disappointed if I hadn't found
traces of him. It isn't necessary for our friends to come often, but they
couldn't very well work their scheme unless they were on the spot when racing
is taking place at Mirst Park. I wonder what our friend thought of the
snowstorm about three o'clock. I guess that must have upset his calculations a
bit. Now look at this."</p>
<p>Phillips bent down to the fireplace and lifted one of the cigarette ends,
which he handed to Fielden.</p>
<p>"Do you know anybody who smokes these?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I think so," Fielden said after close inspection. "They are particularly
expensive cigarettes, and can't be had unless specially ordered. The only man I
know who smokes them is Raymond Copley."</p>
<p>"Precisely. And you may bet your boots this is one of his. At any rate, it
is a curious coincidence, and tends to confirm what I have already told you. I
should be greatly surprised if Copley were not here this afternoon. Now let us
get a bit farther. There is nothing to detain us after we have examined the
telephone. I am afraid we shall have to use a match, but, then, we are bound to
take certain risks."</p>
<p>By the aid of a box of vestas the telephone instrument was found in the
hall. It presented no special features. It appeared to be the kind of hanging
instrument to be seen in hundreds of offices and private houses.</p>
<p>"Nothing remarkable about that," Fielden said.</p>
<p>For the moment Phillips made no reply. He fetched a chair from the kitchen
and mounted it. After the expenditure of two or three matches, the ends of
which he was careful to deposit in his pocket, he broke into a smile.</p>
<p>"Ah, I expected something like this," he said. "There is an extension to
this instrument. If you look in the angle of the wall you will see that it goes
up to the ceiling. To tell you the truth, I am glad to find this, because it
bears out what strikes me as a very plausible theory. I was rather disappointed
to find the telephone here at all. But now I can understand why it was placed
in this particular spot. We have a cunning lot to deal with, and it was to be
expected they would not do things like other people. Let us go upstairs and see
how far this extension goes. To the roof, unless I am mistaken."</p>
<p>The exploration proved troublesome, but the extension was traced to the
second floor and thence along the ceiling, where it finally disappeared through
a skylight which gave on to the roof. An iron ladder was attached to the
skylight, and Phillips pointed out to his companion that the ladder appeared to
have been regularly used. The iron rungs were worn bright, the sides were clean
and shiny.</p>
<p>"Come along," Phillips whispered. "We must get out on the top. But be
cautious and display as little light as possible. I daresay we can manage with
a solitary match."</p>
<p>They found themselves on the roof presently. By feeling about they could
trace the flex of the extension to a square wooden box screwed down to the
leads. The box did not appear to be locked, and it was easy for Phillips to
fumble about inside it until he drew out a cylinder of gutta percha with
something glittering at either end.</p>
<p>"Stoop down and light a match," he whispered, "and hide the flame under your
coat. Now, then, bend down here. That's right."</p>
<p>The match burst into flame under cover of Fielden's coat. The feeble light
displayed another telephone receiver attached to the end of a somewhat long
flex.</p>
<p>"You can blow out the match," Phillips went on, "and don't forget to put the
end in your pocket. It is just as well to be careful when dealing with such a
gang. Perhaps you begin to understand? You don't know, I expect, that this roof
commands the whole racecourse, and enables one to see everything from start to
finish. Now a man could sit down here on this box and watch the race with the
telephone receiver to his mouth. If he were a really good judge of
racing&mdash;I mean, if he were any good as a judge of a finish&mdash;he would
be able to spot the winner in nine cases out of ten fifty lengths from home,
and therefore, if there was some one at the other end in the office of Jolly
&amp; Co., the result of a particular race would be known in London before the
horse was past the post. Do you follow?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's all very well," Fielden objected, "but that does not account
for the fact that&mdash;"</p>
<p>"That the information is conveyed in the smoking room of the Post Club. Of
course it doesn't. That, I confess, is where I am beaten for the present. I am
certain that a second later the confederate in the Post Club knows what has
happened. Don't ask me to tell you how the final touches are put on, because I
don't know. But, knowing as much as I do, we shall soon find out, and I think
you will admit that we haven't wasted our evening. You understand now why
either Copley or a confederate was here this afternoon. The man, whoever he
was, came with the intention of sending the result of the three o'clock race to
Covent Garden. Why the three o'clock race is always picked out for this swindle
we don't know, but that will be made plain sooner or later. They didn't make
anything yesterday or to-day, because on both occasions the race was run in a
snowstorm. It was the snowstorm that first put the idea into my head; in fact,
it was the snowstorm that led me here at all. And now, let us go back to my
lodgings and discuss the matter over a cigar."</p>
<p>The telephone receiver was replaced in its box, the lid shut down, and the
investigators began their descent to the lower rooms. They had not forgotten to
be cautious and walked as quietly and carefully as if the house were occupied,
which was, perhaps, as well, for as they reached the first-floor landing there
came the scratch of a match downstairs. It was only a slight noise, but in the
empty house it boomed loudly in the ears of the explorers. The match had been
struck to light the gas, for a moment later the hall blazed up brightly, and
Fielden and his companion, looking over the banisters, saw two men in the
hall.</p>
<p>"Have you made up a fire in the dining-room?" one of them asked. "You
haven't? Well, do so at once. I am half frozen. It's precious poor fun motoring
from London on a night like this. Did you bring in the hamper?"</p>
<p>Phillips started at the sound of the voice.</p>
<p>"This is awkward," he whispered. "I wish to goodness we had gone five
minutes sooner. It will be worse for you than for me if we are found out. Did
you recognize that voice?"</p>
<p>"Copley," Fielden muttered. "I'd give something to be out of this. The other
man is Foster, of course. I wonder what ill luck brings these fellows here
to-night. Still, as all these rooms are empty they are not likely to come
upstairs. But they mean to stay, or Copley would not have been so fastidious
about the fire."</p>
<p>"They are going to make a night of it," Phillips replied. "Judging from that
remark about the hamper, they have brought supper with them, expecting somebody
else, very likely. Well, there is nothing for it but to wait. If we could only
put out the gas in the hall we might have a chance. We can slip down while they
are at supper and leave by the way we came. We must have that gas out."</p>
<p>"They would only light it again."</p>
<p>"Not if I plug the burner. I'll go and look for a piece of wood. It is
likely the carpenters have left some behind: they generally do. If I can find a
piece about four feet long, the trick will be done."</p>
<h2><a id="chap21" name="chap21">XXI. THE EAVESDROPPERS</a></h2>
<p class="first">To Fielden, waiting, it seemed that Phillips was a long time
away. While he stood looking over the banisters he learned that the fire had
been made up downstairs. With grim amusement he watched Foster open the hamper
and take from it certain delicacies which formed the foundation of what
promised to be an exceedingly good supper. There were sundry bottles, too, with
gold foil about the necks, and when the hamper had been emptied Foster repaired
to the kitchen and presently reappeared with a tray laden with plates and
dishes, the requisite number of glasses and knives and forks, and a tablecloth.
Judging from the smell, Copley was smoking in the dining-room whilst his
accomplice was preparing the supper. Matters had progressed thus far when
Phillips stole gently back, carrying a long very thin slip of wood from a
broken board, the end of which he had whittled to a fine point.</p>
<p>"I've found it," he said. "If I lean over the banisters I can jam the point
of this stick into the eye of the burner, and put out the gas. They won't be
able to light it again for a while. Is it safe?"</p>
<p>The sudden pop of a cork was heard.</p>
<p>"Sounds like it," Fielden whispered. "I think Foster carried in everything
and they are at supper. Now is your time."</p>
<p>Phillips leant over the banisters, and at the second attempt thrust the
sharpened end of the long strip of wood into the eye of the burner. There was a
feeble flicker or two, and then the whole place was wrapped in darkness. He was
only just in time, for almost on the same instant Foster came out of the
dining-room. They heard him muttering that the gas had gone wrong, and watched
him, faintly outlined by a match, strive in vain to light the gas once more.
After the third attempt he abandoned the effort with an oath and went back to
the dining-room. Straining their ears, the two men on the landing could hear
Copley's reply.</p>
<p>"Choked up with dust, I suppose. But never mind so long as we are all right.
Sit down and eat. I daresay those other fellows will be some time yet."</p>
<p>Phillips whispered in his companion's ear.</p>
<p>"I think we shall be safe. What do you say to creep away now we have the
opportunity? Or would it be worth while to stay outside the dining-room and
listen to what they're talking about? It is pitch dark, and we can slope at any
moment."</p>
<p>Fielden was feeling reckless. It did not matter what happened. Without
further ado they tiptoed into the hall where, by the aid of the intense
stillness and a door ajar, they commanded all that was going on. Copley sat at
one end of the table, facing Foster at the other. For some time the two men ate
steadily with an appetite sharpened by their drive through the cold air. When
the meal was finished Copley pushed his chair aside and strode over to the
fireplace. Would Foster remove the supper things? He had begun to gather the
plates and dishes together when Copley stopped him.</p>
<p>"Oh, never mind the things," he said impatiently. "Let the man remove them
in the morning. He can finish up what is left. We have more important matters
to attend to. Take a cigar and sit down by the fire. What is the next
move?"</p>
<p>"We have had cruel bad luck," Foster replied. "Who would have expected to
have two race-days ruined by snowstorms? A prophet could not have foreseen
anything like this. I reckon we have lost twenty thousand pounds the last two
days."</p>
<p>"It's a bad start," Copley answered. "We didn't have the luck, and we
haven't made the money. I was on the roof yesterday and to-day, and I declare
to you I couldn't see a single incident in the race. I've never seen two such
blinding snow showers. It was simply maddening to stand there and feel a
fortune supping through your fingers, all on account of the snow. And that's
not the worst, Foster. It will be another month before there will be two days'
racing at Mirst Park, and we can't count upon a single penny till then. I tell
you frankly I don't know where to turn for ready cash. It's all very fine to
have tradesmen breaking their necks to get my custom, but that doesn't fill my
purse with the needful. It's very odd that a man in my position can procure
almost any article of value he pleases, but when it comes to raising a bit of
cash everybody's suspicions are aroused at once."</p>
<p>"Well, philosophy won't help us," Foster said. "We must annex some ready
money to carry us over the next month, at any rate. The same ill luck can't
happen at the next meeting. Such a coincidence couldn't happen twice. Don't
forget that if we can manage to hang on for four weeks we shall make enough to
carry us on to the Derby, and after the big race is run we shall be in clover.
If you work your cards properly the Blenheim colt is bound to lose, and with
this knowledge we can lay against the horse as long as anybody is fool enough
to take our bets."</p>
<p>"I haven't forgotten that," Copley said. "Of course, I haven't spoken to Sir
George about it yet, but I have asked him to dine with me on Sunday evening at
Seton Manor, and I shall put on the screw then. He'll kick at first. He'll talk
about the blood of his ancestors and the honour of his race and all that kind
of rot, but he is bound to give in. If I asked him to-night he would say he
would rather leave Haredale Park and beg his bread before he would do anything
to be ashamed of. We have both heard people talk like that before now, but when
it comes to the point Sir George will sing another tune. They all do."</p>
<p>"Provided the lady does not change her mind," Foster said with a grin, which
caused Fielden, listening at the door, to clench his fists. "You mustn't lose
sight of that fact, Copley. Miss Haredale dislikes and despises you. But though
she vows that nothing in the world will induce her to marry you, circumstances
alter cases, and when she knows she is no longer mistress of Haredale Park, it
is possible her frowns may turn into smiles."</p>
<p>Copley laughed unpleasantly.</p>
<p>"I haven't lost sight of these things," he said. "Miss Haredale has the bad
taste to dislike me exceedingly. I would give anything if I could induce her to
change her mind. I believe I might even grow honest and lead a respectable
life. Still, that would be beastly monotonous. Your plan is the best. I had
better accept my dismissal and leave Miss Haredale to go her own way. Then I
can put the screw on Sir George and compel him to find some excuse for
scratching his colt. When he sees that I mean to have my money and discovers
the sheriff in possession, he will not be long in inventing a reason why the
Blenheim colt should not run that shall be consistent with his confounded
dignity. You can leave that safely to me, Foster. My word, how cold it is! I
wish you would shut that door. The draught is cutting my legs off. I
daresay&mdash;"</p>
<p>What Copley was about to say was lost to the listeners in the hall by the
closing of the door. They could hear nothing save a murmur of voices which
conveyed nothing to their ears. Phillips touched his companion's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Here's our chance," he whispered. "The sooner we are off the better. We
cannot learn anything more this evening; indeed, there cannot be much more to
learn."</p>
<p>They stole cautiously along the hall, through the kitchen and outhouses, and
were soon outside safe under cover of the darkness. It was black enough now
that the moon had gone down, and they could move freely into the road and
across the heath to the village.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think of these precious rascals?" Phillips asked. "Don't
you agree that we are deep in the secrets of a vile conspiracy? We can't leave
it where it is."</p>
<p>"Most certainly not," Fielden said. "At present I am thinking more about Sir
George Haredale than of anybody else. A year or two ago I should have scorned
the idea of his doing anything dishonourable. But I have learnt worldly wisdom,
and can imagine how it would be if Sir George were suddenly face to face with
poverty. He is completely under Copley's thumb. If these two men bring off
their coup, they will make an enormous fortune. But it must be prevented at all
costs, Phillips. Think out some scheme of checkmate, and I shall be your debtor
for the rest of my life."</p>
<p>"I think I can manage that," Phillips said. "I'll tell you what my plan is
when we get back to my rooms."</p>
<h2><a id="chap22" name="chap22">XXII. A SOLDIER OF FORTUNE</a></h2>
<p class="first">Major Carden sat over the breakfast which his daughter had
prepared for him. He had been unusually late the night before, and showed it in
the additional pinkness of his cheeks and the slightly red rims under his eyes.
Not that he was feeling much the worse for the previous evening's pleasure;
indeed, in his philosophical moments, the Major was fond of speculating which
was the wiser&mdash;to take his fill of enjoyment's cup with its concomitants
in the morrow of suffering and tribulation, or abandon such courses, however
delightful. One mode of life was jolly to a point, but, on the other hand, the
man who exercised prudence and some measure of control had a compensation in
his economy. As a matter of fact, the Major never had been economical.
"Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof" summed up his religion to its
fullest extent. After a stimulant he knew he would be himself again, so he ate
his breakfast with a zest that was truly amazing after the carousal of the
night.</p>
<p>For Major Carden always appeared to be in the best of health and spirits.
Beyond his impecuniosity he had little to trouble him, and at the moment things
appeared to be going very well indeed. He saw his way to make money out of
Phillips, and had also been offered a roving commission on the Continent to
purchase horses for the Army. This would entail his being away for three or
four months, but his travelling allowance was liberal, he would put up at the
best hotels, and enjoy himself in a manner consonant with his mission and
dignity. He would tell his daughter that he was going abroad on some
journalistic commission, for the Major, to do him justice, would have been loth
for Alice to know all the expedients he resorted to in earning his precarious
living.</p>
<p>His love for his daughter was the one wholesome spot in his otherwise shady
existence. He had been a selfish man all his life, had spent his own fortune
and his wife's, and had broken the heart of that unhappy woman in a gentlemanly
way. There had been no violence, no open unkindness, but the refinement of
neglect that undermines health and spirit. When the crash finally came the
Major removed to London with his young daughter. He told her just as much as he
considered necessary, with the consequence that she regarded him as one of the
best and most self-denying of men. Alice had few friends, and none knew
anything about the Major's means, so that the journalistic fiction remained
unassailable, and Alice could speak freely of her father as adding high
intellectual qualities to his other gifts. His frequent late absences from home
were explained in this way, and if he never said anything definite about his
work, his diffidence might be attributed to natural modesty.</p>
<p>In the circumstances, therefore, the Major was not sorry his daughter had
had an invitation to spend a holiday at Haredale Park. He had thought of
inviting himself also, but his new commission put that out of the question.
After he had finished his breakfast he helped himself to a liberal dose of
brandy and soda, and had just lighted his first cigar when his daughter came
in.</p>
<p>"You are very late," she said with playful fondness. "I declare you grow
worse and worse."</p>
<p>"Not my fault, my dear," the Major protested. "These things are inevitable
amongst newspaper men. I thought I should be at home by eleven, but something
important turned up at the last moment and they told me off to attend to it.
They are good enough to say they can depend on me, Alice. That is one of the
advantages of being steady. If anything goes wrong at the office the first
thing they say is, 'Where is Carden?'"</p>
<p>Alice smiled affectionately. To her this was quite natural. For a girl who
had spent so many years in London she was wonderfully simple.</p>
<p>"I suppose it can't be helped," she said. "How few men there are who would
have endured your misfortunes and turned to and made a living as you are doing!
I wish I were clever."</p>
<p>"Oh, so you are, my dear, so you are," the Major said magnanimously. "The
great thing is pluck and perseverance. Without egotism, I think I am endowed
with those qualities, and to some extent so are you, and you will make a name
as an artist yet. Stick to it, my child, stick to it. At the same time, it is
good to have an occasional change, and I am glad you are going to Haredale
Park. I suppose you can manage to put your painting pupils off for a week or
two? Probably you will find it lonely when I am away. I shall only be able to
run over from the Continent occasionally."</p>
<p>"Oh, I shall miss you," Alice said. "But I shall be safe enough. The
landlady is always motherly, and she will see I come to no harm."</p>
<p>The Major dismissed the subject with a flourish of his cigar. He had rather
feared his daughter might give way to tears. He thought she might ask him to
take her along with him and so put him to the pain of refusal. Possibly the
girl was looking too eagerly forward to her visit to Haredale Park to think of
anything else. She had not forgotten the days when Major Carden was a man of
position and they occupied a fine house in the country, when she had her horse
and plunged into the dear delights of country life. It was good to feel she was
going back to it, even though it was only for a little time. She had already
made her modest preparations. She only hoped there would not be too many
visitors at Haredale Park. But May Haredale had assured her they lived very
quietly and had not many friends.</p>
<p>"I am getting nervous about it," she said. "It will seem so different to the
life I have been leading here. If I had only foreseen this I might have saved
up and bought myself another dress or two. Still, I know I shall enjoy
myself."</p>
<p>"Of course you will," the Major said heartily. "But you won't get much
gaiety at Haredale. They don't go in for society much. You see, there are very
few of the old families left. Times change, my dear, and we change with them. I
don't suppose, plainly speaking, that Sir George is much better off than I am.
I happen to know that much depends upon the Blenheim colt winning this year's
Derby. I was in the Post Club yesterday with one or two of my&mdash;"</p>
<p>The Major coughed hastily as if his cigar smoke had gone the wrong way.</p>
<p>"What am I talking about?" he exclaimed. "Anybody would think I am still
interested in sport. Do you know, beyond an occasional day at a small meeting,
I have no time for that sort of thing. I was in the Post Club on business,
purely on business. It is a very sad thing to see young men wasting so much of
their time and money on horses. But I can't prevent them from talking and am
bound to hear the gossip that goes on. That is how I came to know so much about
Sir George's affairs. Every penny he can scrape together goes on the stables,
so you'll probably find that Miss Haredale leads a very quiet existence."</p>
<p>"I am glad to hear it," Alice said. "I shall be happy with her. She was the
greatest friend I had at school, and I can't understand how I ever managed to
lose sight of her. Is it a nice place?"</p>
<p>"Very pleasant," the Major said critically. "It is a grand old house, full
of works of art and furniture and that kind of thing. Of course, all these
things go with the estate, so that Sir George could not dispose of them, which
is a precious lucky thing for the heir, for there won't be too much for him
when the time comes. The stables are very fine, too, and Sir George has some of
the best cattle in the country. Oh, I have no doubt you will enjoy yourself.
When do you go?"</p>
<p>"To-day," Alice said.</p>
<p>The Major appeared to be slightly embarrassed.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," he said, "I had forgotten. It is a trifle awkward, because I have
only a little money just now. The cashier at the office is so careless. He
omitted to draw my cheque on Friday. Till to-morrow I am not sure whether I
shall be able to spare money for your fare. Next week it would be quite
different."</p>
<p>Alice Carden kissed the speaker affectionately.</p>
<p>"How thoughtful you are!" she said. "You are always thinking about other
people. But please don't worry about that. I have saved a little, and shall
have enough to keep me for the next two or three weeks and bring me home
again."</p>
<p>The Major expressed his gratification. For once at least he was sincere. It
was most unfortunate, he said, that he should be in temporary need of cash. He
laid strict injunctions upon Alice to spend what she had freely and not for one
moment to forget that she was a Carden; if she wanted more money she was to
write to him without hesitation. He saw her off at Waterloo presently. He paid
for the cab in the most lordly fashion, and insisted on his daughter travelling
first class, though he had not the money to pay for the ticket. But Alice was
looking forward too eagerly to her holiday to notice these things.</p>
<p>"Good-bye," she cried. "You will have left for the Continent before I come
back. But don't let the thought of my being alone in London interfere with your
pleasure. I should like to feel you were not troubling about me."</p>
<p>"I'll try, my dear," the Major said. "Good-bye."</p>
<h2><a id="chap23" name="chap23">XXIII. A CHANGE OF AIR</a></h2>
<p class="first">About the same time that Major Carden was sitting over his
breakfast, Sir George Haredale was gloomily contemplating his own. He had read
most of his letters, and had impatiently pushed aside the sheaf of bills and
applications for money which poured like a flood upon him at every post. Some
of them were peremptory and some imploring. But they had been coming in for so
long that the master of Haredale Park was more or less hardened to them. But
one communication was distinctly out of the common and worried him
excessively.</p>
<p>"What the deuce does it mean?" he soliloquized irritably. "And who are these
people, Absalom &amp; Co.? I never had any dealings with them. According to
their note-paper they call themselves financial agents, but the whole thing
looks more like a communication from money-lenders. Yet I don't see how I owe
them anything. They write to remind me that in virtue of an assignment made by
Mr. Raymond Copley of a certain date I am in their debt to the extent of more
than forty thousand pounds. What the dickens is an assignment? And what does
Copley mean by doing a thing of this sort without consulting me? These people
hope I shall make arrangements to liquidate the debt in the course of the next
fourteen days. Why, they might just as well ask me to find as many millions.
But I daresay there is nothing really alarming about the thing if I only
understood it. I wish I had a head for figures. I wish my father had given me a
business training. Still, Copley will put it right. Perhaps he is annoyed at
the way that May has been behaving. But I hardly think he will visit her folly
upon me. However, I must say the thing is alarming."</p>
<p>Sir George shuffled the letter into his pocket as the door opened and May
entered. She was dressed for going out and was buttoning her driving gloves
round her wrists. Outside on the gravel stood a smart cob in a Whitechapel
cart.</p>
<p>"Where are you going?" Sir George asked.</p>
<p>"To the station to meet Alice Carden. She will be here for lunch."</p>
<p>"I had forgotten her," Sir George murmured. "To tell you the truth, my dear,
I am rather sorry you asked her."</p>
<p>"But I was always fond of Alice."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course, why not? The girl is all right. But, between ourselves,
Carden is a bit of a bad egg. He comes of an old family, and I recollect when
his position was as good as ours. But he muddled his money away. He always
affected the society of those sportsmen who are ready to do anybody. He made
the mistake of regarding everybody as a fool except himself, and naturally he
came to grief. Those fellows always do."</p>
<p>"But he belongs to one or two good clubs," May protested.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know that. He was never actually found out. He was mixed up in one or
two very queer transactions, but contrived to keep clear of trouble himself.
There are scores of men who meet him on familiar terms, but precious few ask
him to their houses. Still, the girl is coming here, and we must make the best
of it. But I wouldn't ask her again if I were you. You can easily drop the
acquaintance after the next week or so."</p>
<p>May discreetly refrained from discussing the matter further. There was a
strong vein of loyalty in her nature. She liked Alice Carden, and was not
disposed to visit any of the father's shortcomings on the daughter. She had
almost forgotten what Sir George said during her drive to the station. It was a
crisp day, and a frosty sun was shining. There was an exhilaration in the air
almost like champagne. Before the station was reached May put her troubles
behind her, not a very difficult matter for a girl in her twentieth year who
boasts of a fine constitution and a perfect flow of animal spirits. Her cheeks
were glowing, her eyes sparkling, as she advanced to meet Alice Carden.</p>
<p>"I thought I would come for you myself," she said. "I brought a cart which I
am driving. Now if you will pick out your boxes we'll get a porter to put them
in the trap for you."</p>
<p>"My boxes," Alice laughed. "Behold my humble belongings. I have come down
here with one dress-basket which contains all the finery I have. I hope you
haven't many dinner parties and that kind of thing, for, positively, I have
only one evening dress, and I am afraid that that is hopelessly out of date.
Still, if you have any special functions, it will be easy to plead a convenient
headache."</p>
<p>May laughed as she took up the reins.</p>
<p>"Calm yourself," she said. "I assure you there will be nothing of that sort.
We have dropped out of gaieties. For one thing, most of our old friends have
left the neighbourhood, and my father doesn't care for new people. We three
will probably dine alone every night of your stay, and we can ride and drive,
and I can give you a day or two with the hounds if you like."</p>
<p>Alice Carden protested sincerely that she wanted nothing better. It was
pleasant to find herself once more driving down the country roads behind a good
horse. It was like old times when she came to Haredale Park and surveyed the
room which had been appropriated to her use. It was exactly as her father had
described. Here was the old oak, the long rambling passages, the china and
pictures and ancient furniture, all in the setting where they had been fixed
the best part of two centuries ago. Here was the open landscape in front of the
mullioned windows. Here were the woods and fields and lawns, and in the
distance the stables where Sir George Haredale's stud led its luxurious
existence.</p>
<p>It was pleasant to sit in the dining-room before a well-appointed lunch with
the fine silver on the table, the vases of flowers, and the beautiful glass.
Whatever Sir George's feelings on the subject of his daughter's guest were,
there was nothing in his manner to which the girl could take exception. He was
natural, courtly and charming, as he always was, and appeared to take the
keenest pleasure in Alice Carden's arrival. So far as she could see, there was
no sign of trouble, no grim shadow to forecast the ruin hanging over the house.
The butler and a footman or two moved about the room. The sunshine poured
through the painted windows. Altogether it was a household to be envied.
Alice's spirits rose accordingly. She meant thoroughly to enjoy herself, and
when lunch was over professed herself willing to fall in with any plan May had
to suggest.</p>
<p>"Well, let us have a ride," the latter said. "We will go over the Downs
towards the sea and come back by Seton Manor. Now run away and get your habit
on. I will have a horse saddled for you which is not too fresh. You used to be
a daring rider at one time, but it is as well to begin cautiously. In a day or
two you shall have a hunter after your own heart."</p>
<p>They rode out in the keen sunshine and broke across the wide expanse of
Downs, and Alice Carden gave herself up to the exquisite enjoyment of the hour.
It was good to feel the elastic movement of the cob, to listen to the thud of
his hoofs on the turf and catch the breeze streaming in her face. They turned
presently as the sun was setting, and jogged more quietly homewards. A little
later, as they came to Seton Manor, a string of horses clothed and hooded were
turning into the stables. Alice pulled up.</p>
<p>"Who lives there?" she asked.</p>
<p>Some colour crept into May Haredale's cheeks.</p>
<p>"Our neighbour, Mr. Copley," she explained. "He is a newcomer and a great
lover of horses; he is very rich, having made a large fortune in South Africa,
and I suppose this is one way of getting rid of his income. Like most beginners
at the game, he has hardly any good horses, but that is probably because he
hasn't time to look after them himself."</p>
<p>"Is he a friend of yours?" Alice asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, well, he comes over to Haredale Park pretty frequently. My father has
struck up a sort of intimacy with him. Between ourselves, I detest the man. He
goes everywhere in virtue of his money, but he is not a gentleman, as anybody
can see. I am going to tell you a secret, Alice, which you must not tell to a
soul. Mr. Copley is anxious to marry me. Needless to say, I have given him very
little encouragement."</p>
<p>"Of course, you wouldn't," Alice said. "You haven't forgotten what you used
to tell me at school. Don't you remember how you confided in me about Harry
Fielden, and how you used to read part of his letters? I never knew what became
of him."</p>
<p>"No, I never told you. Well, perhaps I will to-night before we go to bed. It
was a very unfortunate business altogether. There was nothing wrong about
Harry. He was merely very reckless and extravagant, and got rid of his money
and went abroad. He hadn't a single penny left, and there was an end of my
romance. It sounds very commonplace, but it is just as serious to me as if it
were one of those pretty stories we read in books. So now Harry has nothing and
I have nothing, and some day or other I shall end, I suppose, in marrying a man
for the sake of a home. But you may be certain it won't be Mr. Raymond
Copley."</p>
<p>"How very sad!" Alice said sympathetically. "Do you ever see Mr.
Fielden?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," May laughed unsteadily. "In fact, he is coming towards us
now."</p>
<h2><a id="chap24" name="chap24">XXIV. A STRANGE VISITOR</a></h2>
<p class="first">Interest as well as sympathy lit up Alice Carden's eyes. She
looked with something more than curiosity at the well-set-up young man who came
striding across the turf towards them. May reached over and laid an impressive
hand upon her friend's arm.</p>
<p>"I am not sure I meant to tell you so much," she whispered. "I spoke on the
spur of the moment. Harry came back to England unexpectedly a little time ago,
and I met him by accident in London. It was a bit romantic in its way, but I'll
tell you about that later. He came down here to his old home to get some of his
belongings, and, to his surprise, nobody recognized him. I was the only person
who knew him, excepting an old stud-groom who had been in the employ of the
Fieldens for the last fifty years. When he found that no one knew him, he
thought he might procure some congenial occupation in his own neighbourhood. It
was part of the same romance that he should obtain this employment at the hands
of Mr. Copley. But, of course, he does not pass in his own name. Please to
recollect that he is Mr. Field. Now, my dear, you have the whole story in a
nutshell. It is like the plot of a novel. I am the beautiful heroine, beloved
by the rich bounder, while my heart is given to the handsome penniless young
man of good family who is in the villain's employ. Don't think me heartless
because I speak so lightly of it, and don't forget to behave as if I had not
told you this story. Mr. Field is an old friend of ours, and that's the only
thing you have to remember."</p>
<p>Alice Carden promised to act discreetly. There was no time to say more, for
Fielden was beside them, and Alice found herself bowing to him as if he were a
new acquaintance.</p>
<p>"You have not been here before?" he asked.</p>
<p>"This is my first visit to Haredale," Alice said. "But I have seen you
before, Mr. Field. Don't you remember you were with my father and Sir George at
Mirst Park a day or two ago? We were not introduced then."</p>
<p>"Oh, I have not forgotten it," Fielden laughed. "I understand you are an old
friend of May's, I mean Miss Haredale's. Would you mind if I came over to-night
after dinner?"</p>
<p>May flashed a glance at the speaker.</p>
<p>"We shall be delighted," she said. "I fancy my father told me he expected
Mr. Copley, too."</p>
<p>Fielden said nothing for a moment or two; then it suddenly occurred to him
that he had forgotten an important matter which would detain him that evening.
He understood what May had hinted to him. He knew it was hardly prudent for him
to be much at Haredale Park whilst Copley was in the neighbourhood. By way of
turning the conversation, he suggested that the girls should dismount and
inspect the stables.</p>
<p>"Nothing I should like better," Alice cried.</p>
<p>"Then come on," Fielden said eagerly. "Let me help you down. You will find
the stables everything to be desired. They are modern, luxurious, and nothing
appears to have been overlooked. From first to last they must have cost about
twice as much as the house. We have a dozen helpers more than are necessary;
indeed, things are conducted on a most lavish scale."</p>
<p>"And the horses?" Alice asked. "Are they&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, as to the horses, the less said about them the better. They are a
pretty moderate lot. Perhaps later we may weed them out a bit. But come and see
for yourself."</p>
<p>It was growing dusk by the time the inspection was over. Then the two girls
walked back towards the archway which led into the wide stable-yard. Outside
the gate two of the stable helps were engaged in an altercation with a
seedy-looking tramp in an advanced state of intoxication.</p>
<p>"Excuse me for a moment," Fielden said, "I must see what is wrong. Now, my
man, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>It was easy for the girls to notice what was going on and to hear every word
that was said. At the tones of authority in Fielden's voice the tramp looked up
and made a ludicrous effort to pull himself together. Over his right eye there
was a fresh cut, from which the blood was trickling. The helpers, too, showed
signs of punishment, and a desire to fling out the stranger, but they dropped
back as Fielden appeared.</p>
<p>"I came to see Mr. Copley," the tramp said.</p>
<p>"Mr. Copley isn't here," Fielden said curtly. "Still, if you want him, it
would be as well to ask for him in a proper manner. What do you mean by pushing
yourself forward in this fashion?"</p>
<p>"I didn't," the tramp said sulkily. "I never said nothing to these men till
they ordered me out, and one of them shoved up against me. I don't stand that
from any one, guv'nor, and so I tell you. If you don't believe me, try it on
yourself."</p>
<p>Fielden was conscious that the blood was mounting into his cheeks. He
returned for a moment to where the two girls were standing and walked with them
into the road.</p>
<p>"I think you had better leave us," he said. "I must give that fellow a
lesson, and this is no place for either of you."</p>
<p>"I hope you won't get hurt," Alice Carden said. "It is curious, but I know
that man quite well by sight. He used to be in my father's regiment; in fact,
he was his servant. He comes to our rooms in London occasionally and my father
helps him with a few coppers and some clothes now and again. I am afraid it is
another case of degradation caused by drink."</p>
<p>"It looks like it," Fielden said. "This man was probably one of the Major's
racing-touts, one of those broken-down creatures occasionally employed on more
or less shady jobs. But he must be taught decent manners. I don't think you
need be afraid for me. I'll try to come over to lunch to-morrow."</p>
<p>Fielden saluted the two girls and returned to the spot where the tramp was
swaying about defiantly.</p>
<p>"Now what do you want?" he demanded once more.</p>
<p>"What do I want?" the fellow sneered. "Well, I want a sovereign, and I am
not going till I get it. If Mr. Copley was here I could have ten sovereigns.
Yes, and he would be glad to pay me, too. You think, because I have been
unfortunate that I can't get any money. You are wrong, young man, you are
wrong."</p>
<p>"Well, you won't get any here," Fielden said. "If you have anything to say
to Mr. Copley you had better wait. He will be here at five o'clock, but you
must wait outside."</p>
<p>"Me wait outside! Who are you talking to? I don't wait for no man, not even
for Raymond Copley. I have got to get back to London to-night anyhow. You just
give me a sovereign or two and tell Mr. Copley you've done it. Tell him if I
have any more of this sort of thing he had best look for somebody else to play
building houses with fruit baskets in Covent Garden. Tell him that. If I have
any more of this to put up with he can get somebody else to monkey with his
fruit baskets. You needn't say more than that."</p>
<p>In spite of the man's intoxication he knew what he was talking about, and
was plainly desirous of conveying something definite. There was a malignant
look in his eye which Fielden did not fail to notice.</p>
<p>"Oh, be off," he said impatiently. "I won't have any row here. Are you
going, or shall I turn you out?"</p>
<p>The intruder answered with a furious oath. He was anxious, he said, to see
any man on the face of the earth who could do a job like that. He lurched
violently at Fielden, and the next moment was sprawling on his back with the
haziest knowledge of what had happened. Then, at a sign from Fielden, the two
helpers took him by the shoulders and legs and carried him into the road. He
rose muttering and threatening. He shook his fist towards the stables and
lurched off until he was swallowed up by the darkness. Quite unconscious that
his knuckles were cut and bleeding Fielden went about his work. It was only
when Copley himself appeared and asked what had happened that Fielden looked at
his damaged hand.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's nothing," he laughed. "A tramp came here not long since asking
for you and demanding a sovereign or two as if you were his banker. The fellow
was insolent, and I had to knock him down, but I had no idea my knuckles were
cut. Needless to say the man didn't get his sovereign, though he did leave a
queer message for you. It is astonishing what strange things men say when they
are in liquor."</p>
<p>"And what did this one say?" Copley asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, he said if he could see you he would get as many pounds as he liked. He
went on to remark that if he had to put up with any more of this you could find
somebody else to monkey with your fruit baskets at Covent Garden. Idiotic,
wasn't it?"</p>
<p>Fielden spoke carelessly, but he kept an eye upon Copley. He saw the latter
start, remarked the queer look on his face, and how his eyes gleamed with
anger.</p>
<p>"Absurd," he said. "I suppose the fellow thinks I am interested in Covent
Garden. But there is no accounting for the vagaries of a drunken man. Anyway,
it's not worth thinking about. Anything fresh to report?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap25" name="chap25">XXV. THE DERELICT</a></h2>
<p class="first">Raymond Copley went back into the house in a thoughtful mood.
The much-envied and much-talked-of millionaire was not particularly happy. He
had a good deal to occupy his attention and had reached a crisis in his affairs
which was likely to prove awkward unless something turned up speedily. It was
easy, as he often cynically observed, to obtain almost unlimited credit upon
the strength of his fictitious wealth, but exceedingly difficult to raise even
a hundred pounds in the City. He had practically no security to offer his
bankers, and dared not do anything that would suggest to an outsider that he
was in want of ready cash. One or two of his schemes lately had ended in
failure, and, so far as he could see, it was almost impossible for him to hold
out for the month which intervened between now and the next meeting at Mirst
Park.</p>
<p>Now here was a fresh cause of annoyance which he had not anticipated.
Unfortunately for the ultimate success of Copley's schemes, they necessitated
the employment of more than one subordinate, and these subordinates had to be
paid. Moreover, they were drawn unavoidably from the refuse of the population,
so that they were a standing source of danger, for it is hazardous to depend
upon people who are usually ready to sell their services to the highest bidder.
One of them had been so audacious as to turn up at the very gates of Seton
Manor and demand money. Luckily, he had not said enough to rouse suspicions.
His remarks to Fielden might easily be ignored as the ravings of a drunken
wretch. Certainly they did not convey much intelligence. So far all was
safe.</p>
<p>But it was a warning, and a warning that Copley did not care to disregard.
Happily, he thought, Fielden was not a curious man, or he might have inquired
farther into the incident. He might even have been disposed to speculate a
sovereign or two, and the tramp might have been in a sufficiently reckless mood
to sell information at that price. The thing must be looked into at once.</p>
<p>Foster sprawled in the library with a copy of the <i>Sportsman</i> in his
hand and a cigarette in his mouth. He looked up carelessly at his employer, but
seeing there was something amiss put down the paper and waited for Copley to
speak.</p>
<p>"What has gone wrong?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, everything," Copley said savagely. "Has a single thing gone straight
since the Mirst Park meeting? Here am I in a big house, furnished regardless of
expense, with scores of tradesmen tumbling over one another to serve me, and
yet I haven't a ten-pound note to call my own. As if that was not bad enough,
that blackguard Chaffey has turned up here."</p>
<p>"I suppose he wants money," Foster asked.</p>
<p>"Well, that was the idea, no doubt. I didn't see him myself, but I
understand he was drunk and objectionable, and Field turned him out. They had a
bit of a scrimmage, and I hope Field gave the fellow a lesson. At any rate, he
went off quietly in the end."</p>
<p>"Then why worry?" Foster said.</p>
<p>"Why worry? What a question! I forgot to tell you the worst. Chaffey came
here demanding money. He said if I had been at home he could have got as much
as he wanted. Imagine what Field must have thought. He would conclude that I
was under obligations to the scamp, but, as you know, I haven't exchanged a
dozen words with him. Everything has been done through you, and I must say I
can't congratulate you on your choice."</p>
<p>"You never do when things go wrong," Foster retorted. "Would you have had me
employ a gentleman? Did you want a man of intelligence, who would have asked
many questions of himself. Chaffey is the man for us. But you are making a
great fuss about nothing."</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think of this? Chaffey told Field that if he had any more
of this sort of thing I could get somebody else to monkey with my fruit baskets
in Covent Garden. Ah, I thought you would change your tune. Imagine a remark
like that in a sporting public-house! Scores of people would smell a rat
instantly. They would get on the track of money-making, especially if Chaffey
happened to mention my name in connexion with the affair. If they only found
him with money and plied him with drink, he would tell them all he knew."</p>
<p>"Which is precious little," Foster said coolly, as he lighted a fresh
cigarette. "Chaffey doesn't really know anything. Still, we must make him
understand that we won't stand this kind of thing. What do you propose to
do?"</p>
<p>"Why, follow him, of course. He can't be far away. He is sure to have gone
to some pothouse. He went down the London Road, and the best thing is to go
after him at once. Let us take the car and make excuses that we shan't be back
in time for dinner. You think I am making much ado about nothing. But my nerves
are not what they used to be. Come along."</p>
<p>Foster made no objection. In truth he was almost as uneasy as his employer.
By and by they were rolling along the road in a car, stopping under some
pretext or other at every public-house. They came presently to a small place
where they heard news of the man they were after. He had left a short time
before; in fact, he had been violently ejected, because he had no money to pay
for the drink he had consumed. Half a mile farther on the motorists espied a
shadowy outline staggering down the middle of the road and lurching from side
to side, singing as he went.</p>
<p>"That's the man," Foster whispered. "Stop the car and I'll get out and
tackle him."</p>
<p>The tramp paused when he found himself within the radius of the powerful
lights. He stood trying to collect his scattered senses, until, finally, he got
some hazy idea of whom he was talking to. His face grew hard and sullen, and he
looked none the better for a swollen eye and a cut forehead.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's you, is it?" he said. "This is a nice way to treat a gentleman.
Here am I, miles away from my happy home and not a penny in my pocket."</p>
<p>"What are you doing here?" Foster asked.</p>
<p>"That, sir," said the tramp with great dignity, "is my business. I have
private occupations of which you know nothing. You are taking advantage of my
poverty. Don't forget that I was in as good a position as yourself at one
time."</p>
<p>"You might easily be better," Foster said contemptuously. "Still, you
haven't told me what brings you here, and why you made a disturbance at Seton
Manor."</p>
<p>"I was at the Lington Meeting," Chaffey answered. "I lost all I had and was
tramping back to London when I recollected that Mr. Copley lived close by. I
thought I would borrow a pound or two from him, and that's why I called. It
would have been all right but for those stable men. Would you care to be
treated like a dog? I lost my temper. You'd have lost yours if you had been in
my place. And that's all about it. I don't want to make any trouble if you
treat me properly. Give me a few pounds and I'll go back to London the first
thing in the morning."</p>
<p>"I'll give you money if you return to-night," Foster said curtly. "Get in
the car and we'll drive you as far as Maley Junction. Come on."</p>
<p>"I will not come on," Chaffey said with an assumption of his old dignity.
"You give me the money and I'll go to town early in the morning. I can't go
before, because I have heard something. There's a trial coming off here
to-morrow morning, and I am bound to see it. You don't suppose I live on what I
get from you. If the trial turns out as I hope it will, it will put a lump in
my pocket. Now what is the good of standing frowning at me like that? I tell
you I'm not going back to London to-night. I won't go till eight o'clock
to-morrow morning. If you don't help me, I know a man who will give me a tenner
cheerfully to hear how I monkey with the fruit baskets in Covent Garden. But do
as you please. I don't mind lying in a ditch till morning, and I don't mind
tramping to town to-morrow. It wouldn't be the first time I've done both. Not
that I want to quarrel with you, Mr. Foster; if you do the fair thing by me,
I'll do the fair thing by you. Give me a quid or two so that I can get some
supper and a bed, and I'll promise not to come near Seton Manor again. What's
more, if the trial turns out all right, I'll send a message to Mr. Copley."</p>
<p>"Oh, give him money and let him have his way," Copley cried impatiently.
"There isn't much chance of drumming sense into him to-night."</p>
<p>A whispered conversation between Copley and Foster followed, then three
sovereigns changed hands and Chaffey departed along the road with the air of a
man who has an object in life.</p>
<p>"You have done the right thing," he said. "I knew you would, when you came
to think of it, and I'll let Mr. Copley know all about the trial. Good-night,
gentlemen, and good luck to you."</p>
<p>So Chaffey vanished into the darkness.</p>
<h2><a id="chap26" name="chap26">XXVI. A SECOND TRIAL</a></h2>
<p class="first">Despite his cheery optimism, Joe Raffle did not appear so gay
as usual. He seemed to have something on his mind, and those under him noticed
that now and then he spoke with a sharpness that was not customary. In fact,
the groom was troubled. He had been glad to see his old master again and to
know that his small conspiracy looked like setting Harry Fielden on his feet
once more. But when he came to review the position of affairs he did not feel
absolutely satisfied, though he had done nobody a wrong, nor had calculated on
putting a single penny in his pocket. On the contrary, he had been convinced
that he was doing a most disinterested action.</p>
<p>But in the light of the past few days everything looked different. Raffle
was by no means blind to what was going on around him. There was plenty of
gossip in the stables, for some degree of friendship between the lads at
Haredale Park and those at Seton Manor was inevitable, and it was an open
secret that there might possibly be an alliance between the two houses. It was
plain to Raffle's keen eyes that May Haredale disliked Raymond Copley intensely
and that Sir George was doing all he could to remove this objection. Raffle
guessed, too, pretty accurately what was the state of Harry Fielden's feelings,
and saw that if this marriage took place his little scheme would be worse than
useless. If Fielden had not turned up again it would not have mattered. But as
it was the large fortune which Sir George was about to annex seemed likely to
go into the pockets of Raymond Copley.</p>
<p>Joe hated Raymond Copley with all the contempt that an old sportsman has for
an ignorant dabbler in the great game. He knew that Copley cared nothing for
racing for its own sake, that he kept his stable only to give himself
importance in the eyes of his neighbours. Raffle was not aware that the Seton
Manor stud was a blind to cover the conspiracies hatched between Copley and
Foster, but he knew enough to set his teeth on edge and to make him determined
to stop this hateful marriage if he could. It was gall and wormwood to feel
that after all he had been working and planning for the advantage of Copley. He
knew that Harry Fielden would have some delicacy in interfering and believed it
likely that, if May consented to become Copley's wife, he would forbid Raffle
to say a word about the real ownership of the Blenheim colt.</p>
<p>This was bad, but worse was to follow. For the last two or three days the
colt had been off his feed, and Raffle thought he was developing symptoms of
staleness. To settle this point, he arranged for another early morning trial.
He had confided his intention to a couple of his trusty helpers, who fondly
imagined that no one knew of it but themselves. But these things leak out in
stables, and in some mysterious way the projected trial reached the ears of
Chaffey, who, when he chose to tear himself away from his beloved bars, was one
of the cleverest touts that ever worried a stable. After parting from Copley
and Foster, he staggered along cheerfully till he came to a roadside
public-house, where he obtained a shakedown for the night. The thirst for drink
was upon him&mdash;indeed, it was seldom or never absent&mdash;but he managed
to put a check upon himself, and retired to bed with strict injunctions to be
called at daybreak. In the morning he rose a trembling wreck, his tongue
cleaved to the roof of his mouth, his nerves were a-quiver, but, by a supreme
effort, he kept himself from the drink which called to him so strongly. The
smell of it in the dingy public-house appealed to him mockingly, but he thrust
the fierce desire aside and stole off to the Downs with splitting head and
aching brows. He resolved to make up for his sufferings later. With luck he
would be in London soon after nine o'clock. An hour later he would have sold
his valuable information, and then&mdash;well, then, he would enjoy himself
after the manner of his kind.</p>
<p>Having concealed himself in a patch of gorse, he waited with what patience
he could for the trial. It was a long and weary vigil, but presently he heard
the muffled tramp of horses and the sound of voices. Cautiously Chaffey raised
himself and peeped out. He knew he was hiding just behind the winning-post. The
solitary figure standing there was familiar to him. With a grin he recognized
Fielden.</p>
<p>In the distance he could see two horses flashing along, and as they drew
nearer he made out the fine dashing outline of the Blenheim colt. He had never
seen that noble animal before, but his keen instinct told him he was not
mistaken. He forgot his aches, pains, and everything else in the excitement of
the moment. He saw the Blenheim colt holding his own, sailing along with a free
and easy stride, and then suddenly, within a hundred yards or so of the gorse
bushes, the other horse came away and finished many lengths ahead. The colt had
a peculiar action that Chaffey did not fail to notice.</p>
<p>"They are right," he said, "the colt's queer. My word! it was well I came
here this morning. This will be five and twenty pounds in my pocket. And if I
have any luck that bloomin' Copley can get somebody else to look after his
fruit baskets. I've had enough of it."</p>
<p>Chaffey dropped down as he saw Raffle coming up to the winning-post. The
horses had been led away, and nobody could hear what Fielden and his companion
and Mallow had to say.</p>
<p>"This is a bad business," Harry observed.</p>
<p>"Looks like it, sir," Raffle said gloomily. "I can't make out what's wrong
with the colt. I thought I knew all about horses, but this puzzles me. He
seemed quite right a day or two ago, and I can't see now what's wrong."</p>
<p>"Oh, there's plenty of time," Fielden said cheerfully. "I daresay you'll
manage to make him fit for the Guineas. It is a good thing I didn't take your
advice and back him. I am glad the money I got for the library is still in the
bank."</p>
<p>The stud-groom shook his head obstinately.</p>
<p>"I don't think you are right, sir," he said. "I still believe in the colt
and, as you say, there is heaps of time between now and the Guineas. Of course,
I must tell Sir George, and a fine state he'll be in, I expect. Just think what
a difference that colt will make if he wins. And yet you refuse, sir, to
benefit by so much as a penny."</p>
<p>"Why should I?" Fielden asked. "Practically the horse doesn't belong to me.
Legally, I suppose, he does, and I have no doubt I could put in a successful
claim. But the colt was only a yearling when I went away. He has been trained
in Mallow's stable and by Sir George's man."</p>
<p>"I never call myself that, sir," Raffle muttered.</p>
<p>"Ah, but you are, Joe, morally speaking. You have accepted service under
him, and you take his money. I know you have behaved exceedingly well to me. I
know you have meant everything for the best, and I thank you for it. But I
cannot interfere. Can't you see that I am in honour bound&mdash;"</p>
<p>"In honour bound to stand by and see Mr. Copley marry Miss Haredale?" Raffle
asked indignantly. "I am sure I beg your pardon. I forgot myself. I had no
business to speak like that to you. But that is what it is coming to. Here have
I been working and scheming and keeping my mouth shut to put a matter of a
hundred thousand pounds into Mr. Copley's pockets."</p>
<p>"If the colt wins," Fielden suggested.</p>
<p>"Oh, he'll be all right, sir. It is only a matter of a few days, but if this
thing gets talked about, why, the colt will go bang down in the betting and we
shall all make fortunes with the outlay of a few pounds. There is another thing
I must tell you. You see, it is like this&mdash;"</p>
<p>Raffle turned away as he spoke, and Fielden followed him, so that the figure
eagerly listening behind the gorse bush could hear no more. Though, on the
whole, he had had an exceedingly fortunate morning, he bitterly regretted that
the deeply-interesting conversation had been cut short just at the point when
he might have picked up information that might have made his fortune.</p>
<p>"I wonder what they're talking about?" he muttered, as he limped painfully
and slowly across the Downs towards Seton Manor. "I suppose I had better give
Mr. Copley a tip. I can send it to him from one of these pubs. He doesn't
deserve any consideration from me, but it will be worth a fiver later. Now for
breakfast and just one drink&mdash;only one before I get back to London and
draw my money. There will be plenty of time for fun this evening. What a fool
I've been! If I could only have kept off that accursed liquor I should have had
a stud of my own by this time."</p>
<p>With this philosophy on his lips Chaffey turned into the bar of the nearest
public-house.</p>
<h2><a id="chap27" name="chap27">XXVII. DRIVING IT HOME</a></h2>
<p class="first">Copley sat at the breakfast-table waiting for Foster to come
down. He had glanced impatiently through his letters, none of which appeared to
be particularly interesting. Then he picked up a repulsive-looking envelope
that lay by the side of his plate. The envelope was greasy and forbidding,
though the handwriting upon it was fairly neat and clear, if a trifle unsteady.
Copley was on the point of pitching it into the fire, feeling pretty sure it
was something in the nature of a begging epistle, when he changed his mind and
opened it.</p>
<p>"Dear sir," it ran, "I was on the Downs this morning and saw the trial I was
speaking to you about last night. Sir George's head man thought it a dead
secret, but I had had it from a sure quarter, and I saw the race between the
Blenheim colt and another at half-past seven. The colt was quite stale, and, if
I am any judge of such matters, I think it will take all their time to wind him
up for the Guineas. I thought you would like to know this, because, properly
handled, there is money in it. Perhaps it may be worth a five-pound note to me
the next time we meet."</p>
<p>There was no signature to this document, but Copley guessed where it came
from. He rose from the table and stood for a while thinking this over. There
was money in the tidings, but not in the way hinted at by Chaffey.</p>
<p>"Anything fresh?" Foster asked, as he attacked his breakfast with zest. "You
look rather pleased about something."</p>
<p>"Well, I am," Copley said, with a sinister smile he found it hard to
conceal. "I've got something here that looks like good business if we can only
hold on a bit longer. As you know, we don't quite agree as to how Sir George
Haredale is to be handled. If I went to him boldly and told him that he must
scratch the Blenheim colt, do you think he would consent if he saw I was in
earnest? My opinion is he would kick me out of the house. But there is another
way of working it, and for the hint I have to thank Chaffey, of all people in
the world. Here is a note from him."</p>
<p>"Wants more money," Foster said with his mouth full.</p>
<p>"Not for the moment, at any rate. He thinks his information is worth a
prospective fiver. As a matter of fact, it is invaluable. You know he told us
last night that he wasn't going away till he witnessed a trial this morning. He
has seen it, and this letter gives me the result. The trial was that of the
Blenheim colt. Chaffey says it will take them all their time to get him fit for
the Guineas, even if they can manage it. Chaffey is probably in town by now,
and has no doubt sold his information to some smart bookmaker. By this time
to-morrow the Blenheim colt will be knocked out of the betting, and one will be
able to get any price one likes. When this becomes public property Sir George
will be justified in scratching the colt. He could say he had no hopes now of
winning the Derby, and has taken this step solely on behalf of the public.
Everybody will believe him. No questions will be asked, and his conduct will be
regarded as most sportsmanlike. Do you see what I am driving at?"</p>
<p>"By Jove!" Foster exclaimed. "That is really smart of you. As Sir George
backed his colt at long prices the money loss will be small. You can arrange as
to the money Sir George owes you, and directly the pen is put through the
colt's name we shall be masters of a hundred thousand pounds. It isn't so much
as we expected, but we shall be able to draw the money during the next few
days, and then be in a position to carry on a war against the bookmakers till
we have made as much as we like. Things are entirely in your hands. You have
only to put it plainly to Sir George and offer to cancel his mortgages, and the
thing is done. He'll fall in with your suggestion readily. He only wants the
excuse to get out. You'll want to handle him carefully, of course. But every
man has his price, and I don't believe Haredale is any exception to the
rule."</p>
<p>"I'll do it to-day," Copley muttered.</p>
<p>"That's right," Foster said approvingly, "there's nothing like striking
while the iron is hot. But if I were you I'd run up to town first and give
Absalom &amp; Co. a hint to put the screw on without delay. What you have to do
is thoroughly to frighten Sir George, who will probably send for you, and see
if he can't arrange terms. We had better motor to London at once. It might be
as well to get Absalom's people to send a man down this afternoon to let Sir
George know that business is meant. By the time we get back this evening there
will be a note from Sir George asking you to go over and see him. If not, I am
no prophet."</p>
<p>On the best of terms with themselves the conspirators started for town half
an hour later, and before eleven o'clock Copley was closeted with the principal
of the well-known financial house of Absalom &amp; Co. Apparently the interview
was to his satisfaction, for he soon made his way to the Post Club. Foster
joined him at lunch, and up to four o'clock they amused themselves by making
small wagers on the day's racing. Soon after five one of the waiters came into
the smoking-room and informed Copley that a gentleman was waiting to see
him.</p>
<p>He went downstairs to find Mr. Absalom in the ante-room. The latter smiled
as he heard the clicking of the machines.</p>
<p>"Do you do anything in that way?" Copley asked.</p>
<p>"Not I," the visitor laughed. "I leave that to the fools who have more money
than sense. If there were no such thing as a horse or a bet I should be
deprived of nine-tenths of my clients, and instead of being a rich man, I
should be hard put to it to obtain a living. So the sport has all my sympathy.
But I didn't come here to discuss racing. I want to speak to you about Sir
George Haredale. I sent my manager down to see him."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes," Copley said impatiently.</p>
<p>"Oh, I won't detain you longer than I can help. My manager saw Sir George
and had a long conversation with him. He was inclined to be high and mighty at
first, but we soon changed all that. He was very anxious to know why you had
transferred your debt to us, and we told him, of course, that you were engaged
in very big speculations which called for all the ready capital you could lay
your hands upon. We also hinted that we were finding money tight, and gave him
to know that unless the cash was paid within a week, we should have to avail
ourselves of our rights and place a man in possession at Haredale Park. That
rather knocked the old gentleman off his balance. My manager said he was quite
civil after that, and intimated his intention to do everything he could. But,
at the same time, he appears to be very much annoyed with you. He thinks you
have not treated him fairly, and seems to hope that when he has seen you he can
arrange matters. Of course, he hasn't the least idea that we are merely
dummies, so if you change your mind you can telephone to us and we will sit
tight. He said he expected to see you this evening."</p>
<p>Copley nodded approvingly. There was no need for hurry, for he knew that the
longer Sir George Haredale thought over the matter, the more likely he was to
yield in the end. After thanking Absalom, who went his way, he sent for
Foster.</p>
<p>"It's all right," he said when the latter came downstairs. "Absalom's people
have seen Sir George, and have left him in a state of blue funk. I think the
best thing we can do is to let him think it over for a day or two, because the
longer he dwells upon the prospect before him the more likely he will be to
listen to any terms I choose to offer. But we can talk this over after dinner.
Let's get back to Seton Manor. By the way, I suppose you have dealt with those
commissions. Did you manage to lay any money against the Blenheim colt to
advantage? Has the trial leaked out yet?"</p>
<p>"I managed to get a good lump on," Foster explained. "I fancy the story is
getting known. According to one of the papers, the Blenheim colt has gone back
to six to one. I think we have done as much as we can. At any rate, the money
is as good as in our pockets."</p>
<p>At Seton Manor Copley and his accomplice sat down to dinner in higher
spirits and with better appetite than they had displayed for some time. There
was nothing to trouble them. They had netted a huge sum of money without the
slightest risk, and, what was more to the point, they would be in a position to
handle it in the course of a few days. There was a good deal of flavour in
Copley's cigar as he lay back in his seat sipping his coffee. A moment or two
later a footman came in with a note on a tray. Copley smiled as he tore open
the envelope, and intimated to the servant that he need not wait.</p>
<p>"From the Baronet?" Foster grinned.</p>
<p>"You've guessed it," Copley replied. "He wants me to go over at once on most
important business."</p>
<h2><a id="chap28" name="chap28">XXVIII. HONOUR BRIGHT</a></h2>
<p class="first">As time passed Sir George Haredale began to think that trouble
was really before him. He had not the least pretence to be a business man. He
had always been prone to take people at their own valuation. He would never
have done anything dishonest or underhanded, and he paid his fellow-men a
similar compliment. He had never counted the cost of anything, for the simple
reason that he had never been taught to. If he wanted a thing he got it. If he
couldn't pay for anything he simply owed for it. When, from time to time, his
creditors grew pressing, he gave his lawyers instructions to raise another
mortgage, and there, so far as he was concerned, was an end of the whole
transaction.</p>
<p>It does not take long, especially with two or three generations of similar
incapacity, seriously to embarrass even so fine an estate as Haredale Park. The
day came at length when Sir George was under the painful necessity of facing
the inevitable, when his worried lawyer told him a few plain truths, and he
realized that his income was barely sufficient to live upon. Unfortunately, at
this crisis, an occasional run of luck on the turf had relieved the pressure,
and it occurred to Sir George as a brilliant idea that here was a source of
permanent income. Then luck ran steadily against him, as it always does sooner
or later, and at the time Sir George made the acquaintance of Copley he was
literally at his wits' end to know what to do.</p>
<p>It was a misfortune, though a disguised one, that Copley in his headstrong
way should fall in love with May Haredale. He had gone about his wooing in
characteristic fashion, and had recognized that, unless he were in a position
to force the pace, his suit was hopeless. Hence he had helped Sir George,
although he needed every penny he had for himself. At that time Copley did not
see his way to get it all back and a great deal more. But now he had the
consolation of knowing that he would come out all right, whether May Haredale
became his wife or not.</p>
<p>He was playing his game with wonted caution and cunning. In response to Sir
George's note, he pleaded some excuse, and on one pretext or other kept clear
of Haredale Park for the best part of a week. He knew how to play his fish. He
knew that delay was in his favour, and was not going to spoil his triumph by
undue haste.</p>
<p>Sir George was thoroughly frightened. The interview with Messrs. Absalom's
manager came in the light of a revelation to him. He realized that he was in
Copley's power, and that the latter could ruin him whenever he chose. Not that
he expected anything of the kind. He was of far too sanguine a nature for that,
and being a gentleman and a man of honour he naturally believed the story that
Copley was temporarily hard put to it for the want of money. From that point of
view, of course, Copley was behaving very well. He had not pressed Sir George,
nor had he insisted that the money must be paid. In point of fact, he had not
mentioned the matter at all.</p>
<p>But Messrs. Absalom's manager had been emphatic enough. There was something
in his manner which Sir George did not like. He actually had no respect for the
aristocracy, and spoke as if money were the only thing in the world that
mattered.</p>
<p>"It comes to this, Sir George," he said. "We must ask you to make
arrangements to clear this off in a week. It is business, pure and simple, and
my people want the money. Things are not going well, and we must look to you to
settle this claim."</p>
<p>"Within a week?" Sir George cried. "Impossible!"</p>
<p>The shrewd manager shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"I am sorry to hear you say that, Sir George," he replied. "In that case, we
must take matters into our own hands and sell you up, including your horses in
training. We shall much regret this step, but necessity will compel us. The
best thing you can do is to consult your solicitors and see if you can raise a
loan. Otherwise&mdash;well, I think I have made myself plain."</p>
<p>The man withdrew, leaving Sir George to his own disturbed thoughts. With his
sanguine disposition and lack of business knowledge he still clung to the idea
that Copley would be able to put this matter right. But when Copley wrote that
business called him elsewhere Sir George's vague sense of alarm began to
develop into a perfect nightmare. At the expiration of a week the first blow
fell. A man, shabbily dressed and dingy of aspect, called to see Sir George and
would take no refusal. He stood in the hall grimly quiet, waiting for the
master of the house, who appeared presently and demanded in his haughtiest
manner what the intruder wanted.</p>
<p>"I am here on behalf of Absalom &amp; Co.," the intruder said. "Fact is, I
represent the sheriff. It is no use blaming me, Sir George. I am only doing my
duty, and it's not so pleasant, at that. But I am here in possession, and here
I am bound by law to stay until this money is paid. As soon as that is done I
shall be only too pleased to go away."</p>
<p>Sir George began to understand the position. He had heard of these things
before, but they had always appeared to be remote enough from him. This was
what was called an execution, and Sir George's dignity disappeared
accordingly.</p>
<p>"This is very awkward," he said. "I had not anticipated anything like this.
How long will you have to stay here?"</p>
<p>"Well, it varies according to circumstances," the man explained. "It all
depends upon what action the plaintiffs take. If they give you an extension of
time I may be here for a month. Sometimes I have been in a house much
longer."</p>
<p>"A month," Sir George exclaimed, "impossible!"</p>
<p>"It may be less than that," the man said. "If they don't give you any time
at all I shall be gone in a week. In the ordinary course of things, at the
expiration of seven days the sheriff will come in and sell everything."</p>
<p>"Seven days!" Sir George repeated the words over and over again, as if he
were trying to grasp their meaning. He had barely a week to find this money,
and, if it were not forthcoming, everything he had would be disposed of. He
would have to face the world without a penny. He wondered if these people would
take his horses. He wondered whether their action would injure him in the
Derby. But misfortunes never came singly, and it was possible that the Blenheim
colt might not start for the historic race at all. For the moment everything
lay in the hands of Raymond Copley. Probably he had not the slightest idea that
Absalom &amp; Co. had gone to these lengths. No doubt he would devise a way out
of this disgraceful situation. It was the only chance.</p>
<p>"If you wouldn't mind going away," Sir George said, "and coming back later
in the day, I will see what I can do."</p>
<p>The man smiled broadly.</p>
<p>"Bless you! I couldn't do that," he said. "It would be as much as my place
is worth. I might even get prosecuted, and I've a wife and family to think of.
I dare not stir a step from here, Sir George; indeed, I dare not. If people
treat me well I always try to give as little trouble as possible, and as yet
nobody knows who I am and why I came. I daresay you can think of some excuse to
account for my presence in the house."</p>
<p>It was very humiliating, but there was nothing for it but a mild conspiracy
between the master of Haredale and this grubby representative of the majesty of
the law. Sir George led the way into the library.</p>
<p>"You had better stay here," he said. "I can say you've come down from London
on some business in connexion with the stable. By the way, it is just as well I
should know your name. Oh, Brown, is it? Well, you had better remain here till
I come back, and I can arrange for you to have your meals in the kitchen. I
suppose you won't object to that?"</p>
<p>"I shan't, if the servants don't," Brown said.</p>
<p>"Very good. I am going to see a friend, and shall return as soon as
possible. I suppose if you had a telegram from Absalom calling you back to
London, you would disappear without any trouble."</p>
<p>"Certainly, sir, and very glad to go. I have never been in a big house like
this before, and it makes all the difference. But I'll do my best to save your
servants from knowing who I am and what I am doing at Haredale Park."</p>
<p>Possibly the speaker had some hope that this complacency would not leave him
poorer than it found him, and, in his sanguine way, Sir George was already
settling in his mind the size of the tip he would give this fellow after he had
seen Copley and made arrangements to get rid of him. Nevertheless the master of
Haredale was really distressed and alarmed as he made his way across the fields
to Seton Manor. Perhaps Copley might not be back from London till dinner-time.
But Copley was there. He was in the stable-yard talking to Foster as Sir George
approached.</p>
<p>"Here he comes," said Foster with a grin. "I thought he wouldn't be very
long. It is any odds that Absalom's man is in possession already. Our friend
looks rather dejected, doesn't he? Now is your time to clinch the
business."</p>
<p>Copley smiled his assent. "I don't think we are likely to have much trouble
with Sir George."</p>
<h2><a id="chap29" name="chap29">XXIX. ACTING THE FRIEND</a></h2>
<p class="first">Copley turned to his visitor with an air of surprise. He held
out his hand with an appearance of great friendliness and began to talk about
horses as if nothing out of the common had happened.</p>
<p>"I am sorry I have been unable to see you," he said. "But I have been
dreadfully harassed in business. You country gentlemen think that capitalists
like myself have unlimited cash. Never, my dear Sir George, was there a greater
mistake. There are times when I would give one of my ears for a thousand pounds
in hard cash. Everything we have is locked up, and bankers are so chary of
speculative securities. Of course, it comes all right in the long run, but
really, for some days, matters have been extremely critical. However, I managed
to make a satisfactory arrangement last night, and came home dead tired, with
the full intention of not going near the City for two or three days. I hope
there is nothing amiss with you. I don't suppose there is. Ah, you want to be
in my line to know what anxiety is."</p>
<p>"I think I've a pretty fair idea of it," Sir George said, as he shook hands.
"You have been good enough to advise me once or twice, and I thought I would
come over this morning and consult you about a worry of my own. I came on the
off-chance, and esteem myself fortunate to find you at home."</p>
<p>"Oh, not at all, not at all," Copley said breezily. "In fact, I was coming
to see you. My conscience has been pricking me, and I feel I have been very
rude. But come into the library and tell me all about it. I'll help you if I
can."</p>
<p>"You are exceedingly good," Sir George said gratefully. "I have had a most
unpleasant shock this morning. It has to do with those people, Absalom &amp;
Co. They tell me you have transferred my debt to them. I can't understand
it."</p>
<p>Copley shook his head as he motioned his visitor to a chair. He passed over
the cigars to Sir George, and sat down to listen in an attitude of respectful
attention.</p>
<p>"No, you wouldn't understand these things," he explained. "It is only the
man of hard business training and instinct that can follow the ramifications of
modern finance. Finance is a fascinating sport with substantial gains for the
successful man, but Heaven help him who fails. He is bound to go to the wall,
and no one has the slightest mercy for him. It is almost a truism to say that
we are at war with one another. Though outwardly on good terms, we really are
the bitterest enemies. It is part of the game. I go and stay with other
financiers, and they come and stay with me. We drink each other's wine and
smoke each other's cigars. We share grouse moors and yachts, we even marry each
other's daughters. But, at the same time, it is everybody for himself. That is
one of the recognized rules, and if you go under you may become a clerk or
something of that kind, unless you prefer to blow out your brains. It is all
the same in the City. I tell you this, so that you may understand what a lot of
enemies one makes when one embarks in a new venture. It is a mistake to imagine
that all the money the successful man makes comes from the public. Every time I
make a quarter of a million, some of my friends must suffer. I have a very big
thing on at present, and thought I had guarded myself at all points. But man is
only human, and it is impossible to foresee everything. Two of my cleverest
friends spotted the weak point in my armour, and were not slow to take their
opportunity. They squeezed me to such an extent that, about a fortnight ago,
they very nearly crushed the life out of me altogether. I was compelled to find
forty thousand pounds at a few hours' notice. The only people I could think of
were Absalom &amp; Co., and I transferred your debt to them. My dear fellow, if
I hadn't done so I should have been in the Bankruptcy Court to-day. Absalom
&amp; Co., in their turn, are being squeezed, and that is why they are putting
pressure upon you."</p>
<p>"Then you can't help me?" Sir George said blankly.</p>
<p>"My dear Sir George, I am afraid not. It is with great regret I say this. In
two or three weeks I shall be in funds, and if you will wait till then, why I
shall give you my cheque with pleasure. At the moment I have nothing. In a
month's time I shall have a fortune at my disposal. But probably these people
won't wait."</p>
<p>"Then I am ruined," Sir George exclaimed.</p>
<p>Copley murmured that it looked very much like it. He made no suggestion at
all. He merely appeared to be duly sympathetic. He was waiting for Sir George
Haredale to realize his position. That done, it would be easy to play his game
successfully.</p>
<p>For a time Sir George paced up and down the library. He cursed himself and
his bad fortune, blamed Chance, bemoaned his cruel ill luck; in fact, like the
weak man he was, he blamed everything except the headlong folly and
short-sighted blindness which had brought all this about. In the meantime,
Copley sat letting his fish play until his strength was exhausted and he could
readily be drawn to land. It was a one-sided battle.</p>
<p>"Is there nothing you can suggest?" Sir George cried despairingly. "Is there
no way of getting delay?"</p>
<p>Copley made no reply for a time. When at length he spoke he dropped his
voice to a persuasive whisper.</p>
<p>"Well, there is one method," he said. "Absalom is a sportsman, and he takes
a great interest in racing matters. Between ourselves, he finances some of the
swell bookmakers, and I understand has a grip upon some of the large commission
firms. If you could show him a way to make thirty or forty thousand pounds on a
race like the Derby, you might induce him to withdraw his execution for a
month. Though he is in a corner, or he wouldn't have dropped on you, the
suggestion I speak of would be worth a sacrifice."</p>
<p>"I don't follow you," Sir George said.</p>
<p>"No? Then I must speak more plainly. At the present moment you own a colt
which looks like winning the Derby. I know the colt has been coughing lately,
but your man Raffle is very sanguine and knows what he is talking about. I see
the colt has come back in the betting to eight to one, and the public never
seem to be tired of backing him. That, however, is the public's look-out and is
no concern of yours. In the colt's present condition you will be justified in
putting a pen through his name and nobody could blame you. Owners don't raise
horses for the benefit of the public, and if the public choose to come in and
forestall the market and the horse is scratched, then they must take the
consequences. It has been done over and over again, and I don't see why you
shouldn't do it yourself. You needn't do it to-day, or to-morrow, or even next
week, but if I can assure Absalom that this is going to happen, why, in that
case, I feel certain these proceedings will be withdrawn, and perhaps such
terms arranged as will wipe the debt out altogether. Do you follow me?"</p>
<p>Sir George sat white and rigid. He seemed trying dimly to comprehend what
Copley was driving at. All the time Copley was speaking he did not meet the eye
of his victim. But Sir George's face was no index of his feelings. He was
quivering from head to foot with a nameless indignation and, though Copley did
not know it, was within an ace of inflicting personal punishment on the
financier.</p>
<p>"You can't be in earnest," Sir George said with difficulty. "Surely, you
were joking when you asked me to do this thing? Why, it would be contemptible,
dishonourable to the last degree. I expect to win a fortune with the Blenheim
colt, but I backed him at a very long price, and if he breaks down the loss
will not be so great. It would be bad enough to lose a fortune which I regarded
as as good as in my pocket, but deliberately to scratch the horse, to wait for
a fortnight whilst these friends of yours are laying against the colt, is an
insult which I did not dream any man would put upon me."</p>
<p>"You will pardon me if I don't see it in that light," Copley said coolly.
"You have a right to do what you like with your own. You are justified in
scratching the horse and, indeed, you have every excuse for doing so. I don't
see that it matters much whether it is done to-day or in a fortnight's time.
You may lose the few thousands pounds you put on the colt, but that seems
probable in any case. And, on the other hand, you have it in your power to wipe
out your debt to me&mdash;that is, to benefit to the extent of forty thousand
pounds."</p>
<p>Sir George's indignation began to ebb. He no longer felt a disposition to
smite Copley hip and thigh; he was thinking of his own position and future.</p>
<p>"And if I refuse?"</p>
<p>Copley shrugged his shoulders eloquently.</p>
<p>"In that case, there is no more to be said or done," he answered. "I would
help you if I could, but I am powerless just now. But perhaps you will think
better of it. I am sure you will be tired of that man in possession by the end
of a week."</p>
<h2><a id="chap30" name="chap30">XXX. AN ULTIMATUM</a></h2>
<p class="first">Copley rose as if the interview were over, and he had done all
he could for his friend. But Sir George lingered. He stood gazing into the fire
thoughtfully and moodily. Copley's last shaft had gone home. Sir George's whole
nature revolted from spending a week in the company of the man in possession.
He wanted to gain time, to have an opportunity to consider matters, and, above
all, to get rid of the incubus which, in his mind's eye, he could see seated
patiently in the library at Haredale Park. Yet he also knew what he ought to
have done. He ought either to have knocked Copley down out of hand, or to have
walked out of the house with a curt intimation that he and Copley must be
strangers in the future.</p>
<p>But, like the weak man he was, when the pinch came he did neither of these
things. It would never have occurred to him to assert that he was a man of
honour. All the world had taken it for granted, and in this opinion Sir George
shared. But, on the other hand, he was face to face with disgrace, and in a few
days would be homeless and penniless, a mark for the finger of scorn, and the
object of pity of those whom he had looked down upon from a lofty standpoint.
But was there, after all, any great harm in what Copley suggested? Scores of
owners of horses had done such things before, and he had a genuine excuse for
drawing the pen through the name of the Blenheim colt, since it had fallen ill.
If other people benefited by the knowledge, it was no concern of his. If the
colt were no better at the end of a fortnight, he could be scratched and things
go on as they were. Besides, the colt was a good one, and in the autumn there
would be every chance of winning the St. Leger with him. This reasoning was all
very specious and wrong, but it wasn't long before Sir George had justified
himself, as Copley felt sure he would do.</p>
<p>"Wait a little," Sir George said. "You can't expect me to make up my mind at
once. I must have time to think it over. But I can't do anything as long as
that man is at Haredale Park. If you can get rid of him for me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I think I can do that," Copley interrupted. "But if I telephone to
Absalom &amp; Co. from here they will want some guarantee from you
that&mdash;well, you know what I mean. They won't want any writing, your word
will be good enough for that."</p>
<p>Sir George expanded at this suggestion. It never struck him that a mere
negotiation on this point from Copley's view would be as good as a written
document.</p>
<p>"I think I can give it," he said.</p>
<p>"Very well," Copley said briskly. "I am glad to hear you talk like that. It
is a commonsense view of the situation. Sit down and smoke your cigar in peace
and don't worry any more about the matter. I'll go into my office and ring up
Absalom &amp; Co., and in an hour's time you will be free from your
trouble."</p>
<p>For three-quarters of an hour Sir George sat immersed in gloomy thoughts.
Manipulate the transaction as he might, deceive himself as he pleased, there
was no getting away from the fact that he was contemplating a shameful thing,
and the knowledge that he was saving himself did not mend matters. The best
part of an hour had passed before Copley returned with a cheerful face.</p>
<p>"I thought I could manage," he exclaimed. "I felt sure there would be little
difficulty, if we only convinced Absalom &amp; Co. that there was a good thing
for them here. But, mind you, I had to give them my word. They wouldn't accept
anything in the least vague. Nothing is to be done for a fortnight; in fact,
not till after the next meeting at Mirst Park, and at the end of that time the
Blenheim colt is to be scratched. You have only to keep him short of exercise,
and the public will conclude that something serious is amiss with the colt. I
had to promise this before I could move these people at all. Of course, if you
don't want to go as far as that I can ring them up again. It would be a pity to
do so, however, seeing that by this time Absalom's have taken steps to withdraw
their action, and in a few minutes the man at Haredale Park will receive a
telegram calling him back to London at once. You had better think the matter
over. Don't say that I persuaded you, for, if you wish to break off
negotiations, it is not too late to do so."</p>
<p>Copley's voice was gentle, but there was nothing persuasive about him. He
meant to leave the matter entirely in Sir George's hands. But, as he had
confidently expected, Sir George did not repudiate the bargain. On the
contrary, he thanked Copley for what he had done, and when they left the
library a few minutes later the arrangement was ratified. As they made for the
stable-yard Copley paused as if something had suddenly occurred to him.</p>
<p>"There is one other matter," he said. "I didn't like to mention it before
for fear you should imagine I was forcing your hand. Now I can speak freely. It
relates to your daughter. When I lent you that money I expected to have the
privilege of calling myself your son-in-law. I have not yet had anything
definite from Miss Haredale; in fact, I am afraid she dislikes me. But things
can't go on like this, and you promised to put in a good word for me. I daresay
you will think it strange, but I have set my heart on this marriage. It will be
well, perhaps, to let your daughter know how things stand. I fear she doesn't
comprehend the position. Tell her yourself."</p>
<p>There was no mistaking the ring of command in the last words.</p>
<p>"Certainly," Sir George promised. "I will do so without delay. I can't for
the life of me understand May's hesitancy. Almost every girl in the county
would jump at the chance of being Mrs. Raymond Copley. Besides, May must marry
a rich man. But leave it to me, Copley. Come over after dinner this evening and
see if we can't fix this thing up once and for all."</p>
<p>Sir George returned to Haredale trying to feel on good terms with himself
and elated with the turn things had taken. But he could not disguise that he
had done wrong. He could not still the voice of conscience. However, he was
relieved to hear from his butler of the departure of Brown on receipt of a
telegram. The man had made certain promises. He would call again later in the
day, but had left his address in case Sir George wanted to write to him. It was
very correct and discreet, no one was any the wiser, nobody had guessed about
this black disgrace, and in the fullness of his heart Sir George wrote a short
note to Brown enclosing a cheque. He was sealing up the envelope and putting on
the stamp when May entered.</p>
<p>She was fresh from her ride. Her eyes were sparkling and her cheeks glowed.
There was something in her gay abandon and her clear light of innocence that
jarred upon Sir George. Why should she have none of this trouble? Why should
she be outside of it all? To some extent, she was the cause of the mischief.
But for her Copley would never have lent Sir George any money; but for her he
would never have found himself in the clutches of Absalom &amp; Co. This was as
specious as his other moralizing, and he never imagined that he had fallen into
a trap set by Copley. What he wanted was some one to vent his anger upon.</p>
<p>"Where have you been?" he asked irritably. "I have been looking for you
everywhere. I have just been having a conversation about you with Mr. Copley.
He wants to know&mdash;"</p>
<p>"He already does know," May said coldly. "I thought I had made that quite
clear. I shall be glad if you will not allude to this again. It is most
distasteful to me."</p>
<p>Sir George brought his fist with a bang on the table.</p>
<p>"You are a fool," he cried. "I beg pardon, but I can't think of any other
word. You don't seem to realize what obligations we are under to Mr. Copley. Do
you know that if he liked he could turn us out of the house to-morrow? Do you
know that even this morning he has saved us from a great disgrace? And he has
done all this out of affection for you. I can assure you that Mr. Raymond
Copley is not the man to be played with."</p>
<p>"My dear father," May protested, "why this violence? I don't in the least
want to play with Mr. Copley."</p>
<p>"Oh, this is no joking matter. You ought to be proud to think that a man
like that is ready to lay his wealth at your feet. Now, I want you to
understand that if you treat him in this way he will very likely teach you a
lesson. It is no use beating about the bush. We are in his hands. And,
therefore, you must marry him."</p>
<p>"Must, my dear father. Surely&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, I am not going to listen to any more. I won't argue with you. You are
either going to marry Mr. Copley or I wash my hands of you altogether. I will
not be ruined for the mere whim of a girl. Now you quite understand me? If this
thing isn't settled to-morrow, Haredale will be no place for you."</p>
<h2><a id="chap31" name="chap31">XXXI. A POINT-BLANK REFUSAL</a></h2>
<p class="first">It was a cruel shock to the girl. She had never heard her
father speak like that before; indeed, she would not have deemed him capable of
such harshness. For many years May and her father had been the best of friends;
indeed, their relationship had been more like brother and sister than anything
else. She had shared in Sir George's pleasures, she had known most of his
troubles, and generally had been allowed to do exactly as she pleased. And if
she had a proper sense of pride, it was Sir George who was mainly responsible
for it. He had never forgotten that he was the master of Haredale Park, and
that the family had lived there three centuries and more. He had always spoken
his mind freely to May on the subject of new-comers and interlopers. He had
declared that no matter what his neighbours might do, not one of them should
ever cross his threshold; he had apparently despised these new rich from the
bottom of his heart. It seemed only the other day that Sir George had spoken
most contemptuously about Raymond Copley. A few months before and he would have
laughed to scorn any suggestion on Copley's part to become one of the
family.</p>
<p>"We need not envy them, my dear," Sir George had said over and over again.
"After all, money is not everything. Of course, one has to be agreeable to
these people in the hunting-field and when one meets them at neighbouring
houses, but, thank goodness, we need not go farther than that. You won't have
much when I die, but so long as you marry the right sort of man I shall be
quite content with your choice. I can trust you, I know."</p>
<p>These recollections crowded into May's mind as she stood face to face with
her father. It struck her almost with painful force that she was making his
acquaintance for the first time. This was another Sir George Haredale, of whom
she had not the slightest knowledge. He looked hard and sullen, and met her eye
with difficulty. May hoped he would have the grace to be ashamed of himself,
that this was an outburst for which he would apologize presently.</p>
<p>"Do you really know what you are saying?" she murmured. "I hope I have not
mistaken you, father."</p>
<p>"You have not mistaken me at all," Sir George said sullenly.</p>
<p>"Then I am to understand that it is your wish that I should become the wife
of Mr. Raymond Copley?"</p>
<p>"I thought I had made it quite plain."</p>
<p>"You are so set upon this match that unless I marry this man I am no longer
to consider Haredale Park as my home."</p>
<p>Sir George nodded. He had not the courage to put it as plainly as that.</p>
<p>"I will try to be calm," May went on. "But this has been a terrible blow to
me. Even now I can hardly believe my ears. Do you mean to say that if I refuse
Mr. Copley I am to be turned out of house and home?"</p>
<p>"Don't be dramatic," Sir George interrupted.</p>
<p>"I didn't know that I was. I only want to have a clear understanding. Oh,
the thing is monstrous. You cannot realize what you are saying. If you have no
sort of feeling for yourself or me, just try to imagine what our friends will
say. We know many people who would decline to be on visiting terms with Mr.
Copley. There are lots of houses where he could not go. Even if I were fond of
the man and could meet your wishes, it would be a long time before certain of
our neighbours forgave me. What will you say when you meet them racing, or
hunting, or shooting? Do you suppose this thing can be kept quiet? Do you
suppose everybody won't know why I left home? Do you believe for a moment that
common gossip will not say that you turned your daughter out because she
refused to marry a man whom you declined to call upon for months after he came
here? I know such things happen in the case of boys, but I never yet heard of a
father in your position who sent his daughter away because she refused to sell
herself to a person whom she both disliked and despised."</p>
<p>Sir George listened uncomfortably. He was violating all his best feelings.
He knew what a sorry figure he must be cutting in the eyes of his daughter.
Moreover, every word she said was true. This thing would get out. It would be a
dainty morsel in the mouths of all the gossips, and, though he could rely upon
May to be silent, other tongues would not be bridled. But he comforted himself
with the assurance that things would never go as far as that, for when May saw
that he was in earnest she would yield. There might be tears and reproaches,
but in the end she would bow to his wishes, and though Copley was not popular,
yet he would be accepted in time on the strength of being Sir George Haredale's
son-in-law.</p>
<p>"There are reasons why this must be," he said. "I am under obligations to
Copley, under great obligations. Besides, he is paying you the greatest
compliment in his power. There are many girls&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, what have the majority of girls to do with me? I am not like them. I
have not been trained in the same school. I know lots of my friends regard
matrimony as a matter of business. They are too idle and selfish to think of
anything but themselves. They would deem it a fine thing to have the spending
of Mr. Copley's money. But I detest the man too much for that. He is not a
gentleman, his manners are not good, and I am sure he is neither honest nor
straightforward. I would do anything in my power to help you, but if it comes
to this, that Haredale Park can only be preserved to us by this hateful
marriage, then I decline. It is too great a sacrifice to ask of your daughter.
Oh, how can you even make the suggestion?"</p>
<p>"You will think better of it," Sir George said.</p>
<p>"Never! I have said the last word. I will not allude to it again, and,
unless you take back what you have said, I will accept you at your word and go
out into the world and earn my own living. Don't mention it again."</p>
<p>Sir George looked uneasily at his daughter. Her austere sternness disturbed
him. He said that Copley was coming over later in the evening to hear what May
had to say on the matter.</p>
<p>"Very well," she answered, "I am rather glad of that. I shall be able to
settle this thing for ever."</p>
<p>She turned and swept from the room. She was glad she had kept the tears out
of her eyes. She was glad Sir George little knew how terribly he had wounded
her. For the rest of the day May went about the house as though nothing had
happened. She had a smile and a pleasant word for her visitor, so that even Sir
George took heart of grace and deluded himself with the idea that his firmness
had not been misplaced. It was only when Copley came that he found out how
mistaken he was. Copley had no difficulty in getting May to himself, for Alice
Carden was deeply engrossed in a book, and Sir George was sitting over his
cigar in the library. At the very first hint of the reason for his visit May
turned to him.</p>
<p>"I think I know what you are going to say," she observed. "I shall be glad
to have this matter finally settled. Oh, no, I don't mean what you do at all.
Will you be good enough to come to the library with me, because I should like
my father to hear what passes between us? I won't detain you more than a few
minutes, and it is the best way."</p>
<p>The self-satisfied smile died from Copley's lips. He had not expected a
reception like this, and it surprised him, too, to see this uncompromising
dignity in May's manner. Perhaps she had never been more alluring or more
attractive in his eyes than she was at that moment, and he knew, too, without
any words from her, that he was on the eve of defeat.</p>
<p>"Very well," he said, "though I don't see why we shouldn't settle it between
us. It is our affair."</p>
<p>May made no reply. She walked into the library, followed by Copley. Sir
George turned eagerly as they entered.</p>
<p>"Ah, well?" he said with an uneasy attempt at playfulness. "I see you have
come to an understanding."</p>
<p>"I trust so," May said quietly, "though I don't think it is the
understanding you anticipate. This is a very hateful position for me, and I
would give a good deal to be out of it. But it would be cowardly if I tried to
shirk my duty. Mr. Copley has already asked me to be his wife, and I refused
him. I do not wish to give him any pain, but I had to put the matter plainly
because he is a persistent man and not inclined to take 'No' for an answer. I
understand he has come here to-night to renew his offer. Now, Mr. Copley, I
have to tell you before my father that what you ask is impossible. I am
old-fashioned enough to prefer happiness to money, and I could not marry a man
whom I did not love. I have never liked you, I never could like you, in fact, I
hope you won't think me rude when I say that I dislike you exceedingly.
Besides, there is something unmanly and cowardly in pursuing a defenceless girl
in this way. If you have one spark of proper feeling you will never allude to
this topic again. I don't want to appeal to your pride. I think I have said
enough."</p>
<p>Copley said nothing at the moment. He was struggling to obtain the mastery
of himself. His face flushed angrily. There was a nasty glitter in his
eyes.</p>
<p>"Does she understand?" he asked.</p>
<p>"It is not my fault if she doesn't," Sir George muttered.</p>
<p>"It is because I do understand," May said, "that I am all the more
determined in my refusal."</p>
<h2><a id="chap32" name="chap32">XXXII. AN EASY FALL</a></h2>
<p class="first">"One moment," Copley put in. "If Sir George has explained
matters, then, perhaps I can speak freely. Your father is indebted to
me&mdash;I will not say anything about the amount, for that would all be wiped
out and we could start on a much better footing if you would only take another
view of the case. If you persist&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You can take that for granted," May said.</p>
<p>"Would you like to think it over?" Copley suggested.</p>
<p>"Oh, I have thought it over. I have had all day to think it over. I see you
mean to force me to speak more plainly still. You have a hold over my father.
He is deeply in your debt. You have lent him a large sum of money, not out of
any feeling of friendship or generosity, but simply because you thought you
could force me to marry you. Did any one ever hear of such a situation except
on the stage? I know that if I do not change my mind you will visit your
displeasure upon my father, you will make it impossible for us to remain at
Haredale Park any longer. It seems a strange thing that a man should be so lost
to all sense of decency as to use weapons like these to compel a girl to marry
him. But it hasn't stopped there. My father has told me quite plainly, even
brutally, that unless I make this sacrifice I am no longer to consider myself
as his daughter. I must go out as if I were a mere underling to earn my own
living. Very well; I am ready to do so. No, I don't want words from either of
you. My mind is made up, and there is no more to be said."</p>
<p>May turned away, and left the library with her head held high and a bright
colour burning her cheeks. She was very near to tears, but was grateful for the
pride which had carried her through this trying interview without the semblance
of a breakdown. When they were alone Sir George turned to his companion.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't have believed it," he said apologetically. "I never expected
that May would be so disobedient. But you must make allowance for her. I
daresay in time&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Never," Copley said emphatically. "She means every word she says. If you
had half the pluck and grit she has you would never have found yourself in your
present position. We have made a mistake, Haredale; we have gone the wrong way
to work. I don't blame you any more than myself, but you may depend upon it
that your daughter will never be my wife. She will keep her word; she will go
out into the world, if necessary, to earn her own living, and I shouldn't
wonder if she made a very good one. I must put up with my disappointment, I
suppose. I would give half I possess to be able to say that your daughter was
my wife. But there must be none of these harsh measures, Haredale. Just think
what people would say! We should both be boycotted. The thing would get into
the papers and your life wouldn't be worth living. We must find some other way
out. Now let us change the subject."</p>
<p>Sir George was perfectly willing. Despite his selfish obstinacy the
interview had been a trial to him, and he was exceedingly glad to get it
over.</p>
<p>"What else have you in your mind?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, business, of course. About the Blenheim colt? I am taking it for
granted that you will scratch him. I don't see very well how you can back out.
I have made the arrangements with Absalom &amp; Co., and as they have withdrawn
their action they will expect you to do your part. Now what do you say to
letting the colt have a run in the Champion Stakes next week at Mirst Park? I
thought it would be a very good way of getting out. To begin with, the public
will be glad to see whether or not their fears are justified, and if the horse
cuts up badly, why, then, you can scratch him at once. It would appear
absolutely fair and above board; in fact, it will be. Or, if you like, you can
let it be understood that the horse is not quite fit and that you still have
hopes of getting him in fettle for the Derby. Either seems a good scheme."</p>
<p>"I see," Sir George said thoughtfully. "Yes, on the whole, that isn't a bad
idea of yours. I shall be glad to get it over, too. I hadn't the slightest
intention of sending the colt to Mirst Park, but Raffle reports that he is much
fitter to-day, so that there is no reason why I should not adopt your
suggestion. There is the chance that people will blame me for taking the risk,
but, at the outside, that will be the worst of it. I will talk it over with
Raffle in the morning, and let you know definitely."</p>
<p>Shortly after breakfast next morning Mallow came into the library to hear
what his employer had to say. The trainer would hardly believe his ears when
Sir George unfolded his plan. He had a score of practical objections to make,
but Haredale put them all impatiently aside.</p>
<p>"Does the colt belong to you or to me?" he asked. "I have the very best of
reasons for what I am going to do. It has always been my policy to take the
public into my confidence. I want them to see at Mirst Park exactly what the
horse can do. If they like to go on backing him after that it will be their own
look-out."</p>
<p>"But that isn't the point, Sir George," Mallow insisted. "The colt is coming
on splendidly again. It would be madness to extend him just now, and if he
breaks down badly, don't blame me. I'll do my best between now and the day of
the race, not because I want to, but because you are my employer and I must
obey orders."</p>
<p>Mallow refused to say more. He closed his mouth obstinately and went back to
the stables in a peculiar frame of mind. He had had twenty years of turf
experience. There was no cunning wile or deep-laid plot that was not familiar
to him and he was wondering what dodge Sir George was up to. Hitherto he had
found Sir George Haredale the soul of honour and integrity, but it was one of
Mallow's theories that every man had his limits. Besides, no one knew better
how critical Sir George's financial affairs were. Of late, too, Sir George had
been hand in glove with Raymond Copley, and Mallow hated Copley from the bottom
of his heart. In his own phraseology, Copley was a wrong 'un.</p>
<p>Raffle was past all words when, in the fullness of his heart. Mallow
confided in him. Raffle was a keen judge of such matters. He sought an
opportunity later in the afternoon of seeing Fielden and telling him what had
happened.</p>
<p>"Is Sir George mad?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>"I don't think so, sir," Raffle replied. "I don't like it at all. Depend
upon it, Sir George has got into a mess over his money matters and has thought
out some scheme for putting himself right. Call me a fool if that there Copley
isn't at the bottom of the whole thing. He and Sir George have been as thick as
thieves lately. They say you can't touch pitch without being defiled. And since
those two have been so friendly, Sir George is quite another man. However,
unless you like to interfere, I must act upon instructions. I am bound to do as
I am told."</p>
<p>"How could I interfere?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>"Well, sir, the colt rightfully belongs to you. He is as much yours as the
coat on your back. I can't see why you should stand quietly by and watch the
ruin of one of the finest horses that ever trod the turf."</p>
<p>"I had forgotten that," Fielden said. "Perhaps, later, I may have something
to say, but for the present that must be our secret, Joe. Mallow must carry out
his instructions. By the way, what are they?"</p>
<p>Something like a grin crossed Raffle's face.</p>
<p>"Oh, we've got to run him, sir," he said. "We've got to run him and do our
best. That there is the faintest chance of his winning Sir George does not
believe for a moment. Still, if you refuse to take a hand, I must do as I am
told, that's all. Perhaps you will be at Mirst Park yourself on the first
day."</p>
<p>"Of course. I am taking one or two of our crocks there. But I must be off,
Joe."</p>
<p>The conversation haunted Fielden. It was with him night and day till the
first day of the Mirst Park meeting arrived. He had seen little or nothing of
Phillips for some time, but that morning he had received a telegram asking him
to meet Phillips in London early in the afternoon. He gathered from the message
that Phillips had something important to say and so he decided to go to town.
It would be easy to get back in time to see the end of the afternoon's sport.
None of the Haredale Park party was over. Nor had Copley put in an appearance,
and Fielden had his time almost to himself. He ran against Raffle in the
paddock half an hour or so before the race for the Champion Stakes. There was a
queer grin on the old man's face as he suggested that Fielden should go and
have a look at the horse. They found the Blenheim colt in his stable looking in
much better condition than Fielden had expected.</p>
<p>"He looks splendid," he said.</p>
<p>"Ah, he is a bonny colt," Raffle exclaimed with a look of affection in his
eyes. "I never saw a better-tempered horse or a more genuine trier. He'll go
every inch of the way, and I shouldn't be surprised if&mdash;but we won't talk
about that."</p>
<p>Raffle refused to say more. Moreover, he had the colt to look to, for the
race was close at hand; so Fielden made his way into the stand, where he could
command a good view. Not that he had any interest in the race. It was a
foregone conclusion that the Blenheim colt would be beaten and in only one or
two instances did he carry any public money. A moment or two later Raffle took
up a position by Fielden's side.</p>
<p>"The colt moves well," said Fielden, looking through his glasses, "and I
don't see much signs of staleness, either. Upon my word, if I had any money to
spare I'd back him for a trifle myself."</p>
<p>"You might do worse," Raffle chuckled.</p>
<h2><a id="chap33" name="chap33">XXXIII. THE FIVE BASKETS</a></h2>
<p class="first">There was the usual roar from the ring which began to die down
as the horses were seen fidgeting at the post. Then a murmur arose from the
spectators, and the dancing kaleidoscope of colours broke into a thin stream as
the field got away to a capital start. They came along all in a cluster round
the bend of the course till, presently, there was a hoarse shout from the
onlookers and the name of the Blenheim colt was on every lip. The horse hung
for a moment or two coming up the straight, then seemed to recover himself and,
moving along with a beautifully free and easy stride, caught the leaders a
dozen lengths from home and slipped past the post a winner by a short head.</p>
<p>"What did I tell you?" Raffle chuckled. "Well, they can't blame me. I was
told by Sir George to do the best I could with the horse and I carried out my
instructions to the letter. No, sir, I didn't back him myself. I wasn't quite
sure. Besides, Sir George wouldn't have liked it. Between you and me, sir, I
don't think he'll be altogether pleased."</p>
<p>Fielden asked no questions. Whatever suspicions Raffle had he kept to
himself. Fielden glanced at his watch and saw he would just have time to catch
a train to town and join Phillips at the rendezvous in Covent Garden. He
hurried away from the course and caught his train by sheer good luck.</p>
<p>He wasn't at all easy in his mind. He was inclined to agree with Raffle that
there was more than met the eye in this affair and that Sir George had little
consideration for the public when he decided to run the colt at Mirst Park. On
the face of it, it was a mad thing to do and the fact that the horse had won
rendered Sir George's policy all the more inexplicable. There was something
sinister, too, in the close friendship which had sprung up between Haredale and
Copley. That Copley was an unscrupulous blackguard Fielden knew very well.
Possibly this knowledge was not shared by Sir George, but there was no getting
over the fact that Haredale's money matters were in a critical state. Better
men than Sir George had yielded to temptation.</p>
<p>Fielden was still debating the matter when he reached town. He turned up at
the hotel in Covent Garden where Phillips was awaiting him, it wanting then
just ten minutes to three. Phillips was relieved when Fielden came in.</p>
<p>"I thought you were going to fail me," he said. "I began to think that you
had missed your train."</p>
<p>"I very nearly lost it," Fielden laughed. "But why do you want me?"</p>
<p>"We shall see that in good time, sir," Phillips said. "In about ten minutes
from now we shall begin operations. There is just time to smoke a cigarette
before we start. What is the best news from Mirst Park? I haven't seen a paper
yet. Was the Blenheim colt beaten very disgracefully?"</p>
<p>"He wasn't beaten at all," Fielden said. "In fact, he won with considerable
ease. There was very little trace of staleness about him. But it is early to
talk about that. We must wait and see what old Raffle says to-morrow. I should
not be surprised if the colt has done himself some serious injury to-day."</p>
<p>Phillips burst into a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>"What a joke!" he cried. "And what a sell it will be for Sir George! Oh, I
know a thing or two, Mr. Fielden. I haven't been moving about with my eyes shut
lately. It is very good of your old friend to pull out his horse in public, for
the benefit of backers generally, but the man who will be most surprised and
most disappointed at the result of to-day's race will be Sir George himself. If
there is another man madder than Sir George it will be that scoundrel
Copley."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>"Never mind, sir. The least said soonest mended. But if I had ten thousand
pounds I'd cheerfully back my opinion to the last penny that Sir George never
hoped for and never expected a victory for the colt. I'll explain all in very
good time. Now the sooner we are off the better. We are going to meet a
gentleman named Chaffey whom I expect to see in a few minutes not very far from
the Post Club on the other side of the street. You remember telling me how
Chaffey turned up at Seton Manor, and what he said when he was drunk. I am glad
you overheard that, because it solved a point that has been puzzling me for
some time. I couldn't for the life of me make out how it was that Jolly &amp;
Co. managed to signal the result of the three o'clock race at Mirst Park into
the smoking-room of the Post Club. I doubt if I ever should have found out had
not Chaffey gone down to Seton Manor and hinted that if he couldn't get what he
wanted somebody else might have his job of playing with the fruit baskets in
Covent Garden. I saw at once that this was connected with the swindle, but for
the life of me I couldn't place it. After thinking over it for the best part of
a week, I took a stroll through Covent Garden market and finally stood in front
of the Post Club trying to piece the puzzle together in my mind. There were a
good many men about loading and unloading baskets, and I saw that most of them
carried them on their heads. Why, some of these porters can carry as many as
eight or nine bushel baskets on their heads. While I stood watching them an
idea flashed into my mind. Look at this copy of to-day's <i>Sportsman</i>. Turn
to the probable starters in the three o'clock race, and you will see for
yourself that there is a number by the side of every horse. Now most racing men
carry a <i>Sportsman</i>. There would be nothing suspicious in a backer pulling
the <i>Sportsman</i> out of his pocket and consulting it at any moment. He
might do it in a railway carriage, or on the course, or in a smoking-room, and
it wouldn't attract any attention. Unless I am greatly mistaken, I have found
the clue to the means by which Copley &amp; Co.'s confederate has the result of
a race at Mirst Park conveyed to him into the smoking-room of the Post Club
practically before the horses are past the post. Then, of course, he can make
what bets he likes. He is perfectly safe, because he can't lose. But, come
along, it is past three and I don't want to lose this chance of verifying my
conclusions. Only we must be careful. We must not rouse Chaffey's suspicions.
He must not know that we are even watching him. Close to the Post Club there is
a shop where we can procure some cigars and cigarettes and keep our eye upon
what is going on. Are you ready?"</p>
<p>Fielden was ready and willing, for his curiosity was aflame. When he and his
companion reached Covent Garden, they turned into a cigar shop in the same
block of buildings in which the Post Club was situated. A good many customers
had to be attended to, so that it was excusable to stand inside the door way
and watch what was taking place on the other side of the road.</p>
<p>The market was practically empty. Business had been finished for the day,
and there were only two or three casual porters loafing about waiting on the
off-chance for an hour's work. One of them standing by a pile of baskets with
hands plunged deeply in his pockets and a pipe in his mouth was Chaffey.</p>
<p>"No mistake about him?" Phillips asked.</p>
<p>"That's the man," Fielden whispered. "I could swear to that expression of
his anywhere. But what is he doing there? He doesn't seem to be particularly
busy."</p>
<p>"He is getting well paid for his job, anyway," Phillips chuckled. "As it is
not likely to last long he'll be gone in a few moments. Have you the right time
about you? What do you make it? Five minutes past three by post office time?
The result ought to be here at any moment. Ah, I thought so. Just keep your eye
closely upon Chaffey."</p>
<p>In his excitement Phillips bent over and grasped his companion's arm.
Fielden saw Chaffey suddenly pull himself up and moisten his hands. He touched
his ragged cap as if in response to a distant call, then he proceeded to fling
five baskets one on the top of the other and balance them on his head. With
this pyramid thus arranged he walked slowly across the market and disappeared
down one of the corridors, where he was lost to sight.</p>
<p>"What on earth does it mean?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's the signal," Phillips explained. "The result has just come into
the office of Jolly &amp; Co. on the private telephone wire from The Nook at
Mirst Park. The supposed Mr. Jolly stands near the window with the telephone
receiver to his ear ready to flash the signal across the street. Now you
understand why the flex of the telephone is so long. Before the horse is past
the post the man on the top of the house at Mirst Park sends the number, and
Jolly &amp; Co. signal it to Chaffey. Then Chaffey simply puts five or other
number of baskets on his head, and the confederate in the Post Club has the
result. Mind you, this could be done within five seconds of the race being
settled. Now take this <i>Sportsman</i> and I'll eat my hat if the winner of
the three o'clock race at Mirst Park isn't number five on the programme."</p>
<p>When the result was published Phillips proved to be correct.</p>
<h2><a id="chap34" name="chap34">XXXIV. NO. 5</a></h2>
<p class="first">"That's it," Phillips exclaimed. "I think we've got it right
at last. We know by the evening paper that Dandy won the Longhill Handicap,
which was the three o'clock race at Mirst Park to-day. We also know that Dandy
is No. 5 on the <i>Sportsman</i> list, all of which goes to prove our case. It
is a smart bit of business, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Exceedingly smart," Fielden said, "and, to some extent, risky. Whoever
sends the message from Mirst Park is certainly a very good judge of racing.
That telephone signal must have been started before the horse was past the
post."</p>
<p>"Oh, I don't know," Phillips argued. "In a very tight race they would have
to wait to see what the judge had to say. But I am sure that either of us could
spot the winner in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred within fifty lengths of
the post. Therefore, the result would be known in London and signalled into the
Post Club practically at the same instant that the race was over. I think we
shall know how to deal with Mr. Copley now."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>"That depends upon circumstances. I don't mind telling you, when I first
came home and found Copley in an apparently good position, I intended to make
money out of him. I didn't feel so keen upon revenge as I used to feel. It
would have been no great satisfaction to me to get him ten years on the
Breakwater, and, besides, I should have had to go out to the Cape and waste
several months there. That is why I decided to hit him through his pocket. But
I had to be careful, because I had a dangerous man to deal with and I didn't
relish the idea of a prosecution for blackmail. That is one of the reasons why
I went into this business. When I speak, I shall lay Copley by the heels
without taking any trouble and probably without appearing in the matter. I
shall have the satisfaction of sending him to gaol, and I shan't have to go out
of the country at all."</p>
<p>"You can't make anything out of this," Fielden reminded him.</p>
<p>"Of course not. If I were to go to Copley to-day and tell him what I had
discovered he would give me a few thousand pounds to keep my mouth shut and,
sooner or later, when the dodge is found out, as it must be, I should figure in
the dock with the others. It is too dangerous a game. Still, when I come to
think of it, sir, you are somewhat in my debt."</p>
<p>"Perhaps I am," Fielden admitted. "But I don't see what special favour you
have done me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"By getting rid of Raymond Copley," Phillips smiled. "I couldn't have served
you better. We shall have him out of the way anyhow. Later, when you find
yourself in a good position again, I will ask you to give me a responsible post
in your stables. Oh, it will all come right, sir. You ought to win a big stake
over the Derby, if you play your cards right, and the Blenheim colt will be
worth a small fortune."</p>
<p>"What have I to do with the horse?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>"I know all about that, sir," Phillips said cheerfully. "Never mind where I
had my information. I am half a gipsy and my mother's tribe pick up news from
all sorts of unlikely quarters. A lad who used to be in your stables told me
the story. Nobody else would have believed him but me. I can give you chapter
and verse if you like, but that would only be wasting time, and I can guess
what Copley's game is, too. See if I don't prove to be a true prophet. The
Blenheim colt will be sure to show signs of to-day's race; indeed, he is a
marvel if he does any good during the rest of his career as a three year-old.
But, then, the horse is a marvel. Still, very few of us know that, and we shall
be able to back him for the Derby at our own price within the next few days. I
will stick on the horse every farthing I can rake together. If I could only get
a couple of thousand pounds I could make a fortune. And you ought to make a
fortune, too. You told me that you could find that sum, if necessary, and
seeing that you have it in your power to prevent the Blenheim colt from being
scratched you will be flying in the face of Providence if you turn your back on
a chance like this."</p>
<p>Fielden looked at his companion in some perplexity. He was astonished to
find that Phillips knew so much. Whence did the man derive his information? But
there never was a gipsy yet who was not fond of a horse. The various clans roam
all over the country, and very little that is going on escapes their sharp
black eyes and there is, besides, a sort of freemasonry amongst them. But it
mattered little whence Phillips' information came, for he had certainly got it.
He was correct in every detail, too, and for the first time Fielden began to
see his way. He could lay his hands upon a couple of thousand pounds, and
before the week was out he knew that the Blenheim colt would be at any price in
the market that a backer needed. Two thousand pounds in itself was not much to
lose. It would leave him only a little worse off than he was at present. On the
other hand, it might bring him in enough to start life again as a rich man. He
was thinking of May Haredale and all the brilliant possibilities in that
quarter. He could stop this vile conspiracy. It was for him to say what the
future of the Blenheim colt was, and he could do this without arousing any
gossip or giving the public any chance for spicy scandal. When the right moment
came he could go to Sir George and inform him that he had no control whatever
over the colt. Sir George might bluster and Copley might threaten, but their
threats would be in vain. In the long run Sir George would benefit and May
would be free from the persecutions of a scoundrel and Fielden would be in a
position to offer her a luxurious home. He had learnt his lesson, too. He was
no longer the careless and extravagant youth who had left England more or less
under a cloud.</p>
<p>He was aroused from his reverie by questions from Phillips.</p>
<p>"Really, I beg pardon," he said, "but, for the moment, I was thinking about
something else."</p>
<p>"Oh, I understand that," Phillips said with a dry smile. "But we haven't
finished. Our case is not complete. We must know whether there is any big
wagering on the three o'clock race this afternoon in the Post Club. To get my
facts I have brought Major Carden over here on purpose. I have paid his
expenses to and from Germany, and I understand he wishes to return to-night, if
possible. Let's go on to our hotel and wait for him. But I must tell you that
Carden knows nothing. He thinks I have some deep scheme on for making money and
so long as I pay him for his information he is satisfied. You had better leave
all questions to me."</p>
<p>Fielden was willing enough to do so. To some degree he was not pleased to be
mixed up in this business, though it gave him a hold over Copley. They had
hardly reached their hotel before the Major came in. He made no objection to
Phillips' offer of refreshment. They talked for a few minutes on indifferent
topics and then Phillips went to the point.</p>
<p>"I suppose you've got my cheque," he said, "or you would not have been here
to-day. I hope it wasn't inconvenient."</p>
<p>"It was devilish inconvenient," the Major said in his florid way. "But as
you are willing to pay I don't mind. Now I am ready to give you all the
information you need. Please don't be long because I have a train to catch
before five."</p>
<p>"Then we needn't waste more time," Phillips said. "I suppose you were in the
Post Club all the afternoon."</p>
<p>"My dear sir, I lunched there and I've only just come away. I left a lot of
people there. Rickerby was there, with three or four more of the gilded
plungers, including Selwyn. As to the first and second race&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, hang the first and second race," Phillips cried impatiently. "It is the
three o'clock race at Mirst Park that I am interested in. Was there any heavy
wagering going on, and can you tell me who was betting? That's all I want to
know."</p>
<p>The Major went into detail. There had been a certain amount of business over
the three o'clock race, but sundry heavy wagers had been deferred almost to the
last moment. A large amount of chaff had gone on between one particular plunger
and Selwyn and his satellites over a horse called the Dandy. Dandy had been a
rank outsider and had only cropped up in the betting at the eleventh hour, so
to speak. A quarter of an hour before the race there had been no takers. Then
the argument grew more heated and finally Selwyn had laid several wagers
against Dandy at a thousand to thirty. All this had taken place, so far as the
Major could guess, whilst the race was in progress. There was something like
consternation amongst the bookmakers when the news came that Dandy had won the
Longhill Handicap by three lengths. Altogether it had been a dramatic
afternoon.</p>
<p>"And that's about all I can tell you," the Major concluded. "If you want me
again, give me more notice, please. I really must be going."</p>
<p>He took up his hat and swaggered from the room, leaving Phillips apparently
very well pleased.</p>
<p>"Our case is complete," he said. "The rest is in your hands."</p>
<h2><a id="chap35" name="chap35">XXXV. A POISONOUS ATMOSPHERE</a></h2>
<p class="first">It is impossible for a man to change the habits of a lifetime,
especially when he has reached the age to which Sir George Haredale had
attained. He tried hard to justify himself in his present embroilment. He
juggled with his conscience, but the ways of the transgressor are hard, and the
master of Haredale Park was having anything but a good time. He knew that he
was doing wrong, that he was about to commit something in the shape of a crime.
When a man has pledged himself to this kind of thing, it is marvellous how
circumstances combine to help him.</p>
<p>On the face of it things were not going well. The victory of the Blenheim
colt in the Champion Stakes was a blow to him. He had expected the colt to
lose, thereby giving him occasion to scratch it. If this had turned out as he
had expected, he would have been the object of popular sympathy and his
reputation as a sportsman and an honourable man would have been enhanced. But
to his surprise and vexation, the colt had proved his sterling worth and within
the last few hours the public had established him more firmly than ever in the
betting. There was always the chance, of course, that the race would leave its
mark on the colt and that some ill effects might supervene, in which case the
original programme could be carried out without exciting the suspicions of the
many-headed.</p>
<p>This was precisely what did happen. Three days later Mallow came into his
employer's study with a long face and the information that the colt's lack of
condition was rather more manifest than before. For once in a way Mallow was
not polite and forgot the respect due to his master.</p>
<p>"It's just as I told you, Sir George," he exclaimed. "The colt's been
ruined. I don't say it isn't possible to get him fit in time for the Derby,
because he's a wonder. But if you had tried to ruin the horse you couldn't have
gone about it in a better way. I can almost cry when I think of it."</p>
<p>"You are forgetting yourself, Mallow," Sir George said.</p>
<p>"Oh, maybe I am, sir, maybe I am. I have been dealing with fools and knaves
all my lifetime, and I ought to be accustomed to them by now. I feel as if I
had been a party to cutting that colt's throat. You don't deserve to have a
horse like that in your stable; you don't deserve to win another race as long
as you live."</p>
<p>Sir George was vastly indignant. He wanted to know if Mallow realized whom
he was talking to. But Mallow was in no mood for politeness and told his
employer a few home truths. He sketched graphically what the better-class
sportsmen would say when they realized what had happened. It was useless to be
angry, all the more so because he knew that every word Mallow spoke was true.
On the spur of the moment he had intended to give Mallow instructions to have
the horse struck out of all his three-year engagements, but looking his irate
servant in the face he lacked the pluck to do so. So he proceeded to
compromise.</p>
<p>"At the worst," he said with some dignity, "it was only an error in
judgment. If you can get the colt fit again before the Derby the public will
have no grievance against me. They will win their money and that's all they
care about."</p>
<p>Mallow appeared to be somewhat mollified.</p>
<p>"Then things are to go on as they are, Sir George?" he asked. "There has
been a lot of mischief done, but it is not yet too late. But it is no use
crying over spilt milk."</p>
<p>This was going rather too far and too fast. Sir George's fears were aroused
again.</p>
<p>"Your instructions are not quite indefinite," he corrected. "We will let the
matter stand over for a week. At the end of that time we will see the colt's
condition. If there is no material change for the better, then I must scratch
him."</p>
<p>With this perforce Mallow had to remain content and went out muttering to
himself. He wanted to know what Sir George was driving at and what this new
policy meant. The trainer had a shrewd idea, though he hardly dared to whisper
it even to himself. Still, a week was a week, and much might be done in that
time. Besides, if necessary, he knew Raffle had a great card to play. For some
reason or other Sir George wanted the colt scratched and Mallow had no
difficulty in laying this somewhat shady diplomacy on the shoulders of Raymond
Copley.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the week drifted on and things remained in much the same position
at Haredale Park. Sir George had said nothing more to his daughter, neither had
she alluded to the detestable topic. But she was ready to take a step which
would have considerably alarmed her father had he known of it. Copley was away
on business. He came back on Saturday and made his way across to Haredale Park
after dinner. In the drawing-room he was coldly informed that Sir George was in
the library. He appeared to take this curt dismissal in good part and went off
in search of Sir George whom he found sitting moodily over the fire.</p>
<p>"Where have you been lately?" the Baronet asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, my dear sir," Copley explained, "you forget that I have my business to
look after. I have been exceedingly busy. When things take a turn for the
better that is the time to follow your fortune closely. During the last few
days I have been making money with both hands."</p>
<p>It appeared to be no idle boast, for Copley was looking less gloomy than
usual. Fortune was smiling upon him again. He and his confederates had had a
rare haul over the Longhill Handicap. They were in funds, and unless things
went very wrong indeed by the time the Derby was over they would be all rich
men. But Sir George guessed nothing of this. He was only sorry to think that
May should be so obstinate in refusing to take her share in the spending of
these phenomenal riches.</p>
<p>"I am exceedingly glad to hear it," he said.</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you very much. You see, fortune cuts all round. What's good for
me is good for you. In the first place, you can make your mind easy about that
affair of Absalom &amp; Co., because they won't trouble you any more. After the
Derby we need not worry ourselves as to money matters. That brings me to my
reason for coming here this evening. I understand that the colt has broken down
permanently. From what I see in the papers there is not the remotest chance of
his winning a race as a three-year old."</p>
<p>"It looks like it," Sir George answered. "At the same time, Mallow doesn't
share my opinion. He is very obstinate."</p>
<p>"Oh, what the devil does it matter what he says or thinks?" Copley said
impatiently. "He is only a servant. Surely you can do what you like with your
own. Besides, in this matter the opinion of the whole racing world will sustain
you. At the worst people can only say that you have made an error in judgment.
The Press recognizes that you have acted like a good fellow and a sportsman in
running this risk simply with the object of taking the public into your
confidence. They don't know, of course, that you don't want the horse to win,
nor what a surprise the Mirst Park victory was to you. And on the top of that
they tumble over one another to back the colt, and if he doesn't start at all
they are to blame. Still, it has been a good thing for me. I have laid against
your animal thick and thin and after the Derby is over I shan't need to do any
more work."</p>
<p>Sir George made no reply. He sat gazing dubiously into the fire. Looking
back at the course of events, he could hardly see how he had got himself into
this mess. He ought to have refused to listen to Copley, and should have
supported the opinion of such a sound judge as Raffle. Besides, he had never
won a Derby in his racing career, and it seemed to him that he was wasting a
splendid chance. But it was too late to repent, too late to draw back, and all
Sir George could hope was that no one would ever have an inkling of his shame.
He did not know, neither did Copley, that May was standing in the doorway. She
had come in for something she required. Her evening shoes had made no sound on
the thick carpets, and she had heard every word that was said. Not that she
intended to play the eavesdropper. But one remark of Copley's had fascinated
her and she stood as if rooted to the spot.</p>
<p>She knew her ears did not deceive her. She had been brought up all her life
in an atmosphere of racing. She knew almost as much about it as Raffle himself.
The thing was plain and a wave of shame and humiliation rushed over the girl as
she stood there drinking in every word.</p>
<p>She could not blind herself to the truth. She could not get away from the
fact that her father was a conscious participant in a disgraceful action. It
mattered little that her father was in Copley's hands, or that Copley had
suggested the whole thing. The shock was none the less painful. It seemed
incredible that a man in Sir George's position should stoop so low as this.
These plots had happened before and no one had spoken of them with greater
contempt than had Sir George. Now was he self-confessed as a principal in one
of the shadiest of them all.</p>
<p>May stole away. For a moment she had been on the point of an outburst. But
perhaps it would be better to wait and speak to her father quietly later, to
try to find some means of averting this dreadful dishonour.</p>
<p>"I cannot stay here," she murmured. "The atmosphere poisons me. I must get
away, I must get away."</p>
<h2><a id="chap36" name="chap36">XXXVI. FIELDEN INTERVENES</a></h2>
<p class="first">May went quietly back to the drawing-room. There was nothing
in her face to indicate what she was suffering. For a time she sat gazing into
the fire, watching Alice Carden who sat opposite her engrossed in a book. At
the end of half an hour May had made up her mind what to do, and when Alice
laid her volume aside, she began to speak.</p>
<p>"How long is your father likely to be away?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, for two months, I suppose," Alice said. "But I may find him at home
when I go back next week."</p>
<p>"I hope not," May answered, "because I have a plan to suggest to you. I
wonder if you would mind my coming with you? I suppose you could get me a
bedroom in your house. I should like to pay for myself. Could it be managed, do
you think?"</p>
<p>"It would be delightful," Alice cried. "But why do you want to leave this
beautiful house? What will Sir George say when he hears of it?"</p>
<p>"He mustn't hear it," May whispered. "We have always been very good friends,
Alice, and you can help me now if you will. I am going to confide in you and
you must not whisper a word of it to a soul. So long as your father is away I
shall be safe with you, and as he may not be back for some weeks I will have
time to turn round. I must go away, I cannot stay here any longer. Something
has happened which compels me to get my own living."</p>
<p>"Oh, impossible!" Alice cried.</p>
<p>"My dear, don't you know that it is the unexpected that happens? Well, in my
case, it has. If anybody had told me this a couple of months ago I should have
laughed the idea to scorn. It would have been incredible that my father should
threaten to turn me out of the house. Hitherto we have been the best of
friends, and I have regarded him as one of the most upright and most honourable
of men. I have always prided myself upon the fact that nothing could rob us of
our good name; but I was mistaken, Alice. Actually this place does not belong
to us at all. My father is a mere lodger, dependent upon the good will of Mr.
Raymond Copley, who can turn us out at any moment. Moreover, he has compelled
my father to do a thing that I blush to mention. Do you know why Mr. Copley has
brought all this about?"</p>
<p>"I think I can guess," Alice said. "He is anxious to marry you. Am I not
right?"</p>
<p>"You have guessed it," May exclaimed. "You have saved me the humiliation of
telling you that. Mr. Copley can't say he has bought me. But he has bought my
father, and it comes to this, that unless I consent to be Raymond Copley's wife
I am to consider this my home no longer. These were my father's very words. I
suppose he chose them because they sounded best. But it is as if he had told me
to go. I couldn't marry that man; nothing would induce me to do so. There is
worse behind&mdash;there is a conspiracy on foot which I overheard in the
library just now. You must not ask me to tell you what it is. My tongue would
refuse to tell it. Well, it is the last straw. I couldn't be more miserable
than I have been the last week or so. I cannot stay any longer. I have little
or no money, but I have my mother's jewels which ought to fetch at least a
thousand pounds. I propose to go to London and look about for something to do.
I want to come to you because we are such friends, and because I know you will
sympathize with me. We can live very cheaply together and I will pay you for
all I have, and before your father returns I shall probably have found work.
You won't refuse, will you?"</p>
<p>"How can you think such a thing?" Alice said reproachfully. "There is
nothing I would not do for you, and I know we shall be perfectly happy
together. It would be worse than death to marry a man like Mr. Copley. I don't
know why it is, but from the very first moment I saw him I hated him. I think
he has such a cruel face. His mouth is so hard and his eyes are dreadful. But
when do you want to go? When will you be ready to start?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you say you must be back in town on Tuesday? Didn't you say
something about your pupils? Well, suppose you go up on that day and I follow
you on Wednesday. It would arouse suspicion for us both to go at the same time,
and indeed I would ask you to stay longer only I can't breathe here. Knowing
what I do, it is hateful to have to sit down to the same table with my father.
I daresay I shall come to forgive him in time, but for the present it is beyond
my strength. Mr. Copley is always about the house. Do try to make it Tuesday if
you can. It seems so horrid of me&mdash;"</p>
<p>Alice rose from her seat and kissed the speaker affectionately.</p>
<p>"I won't hear another word," she said. "It is not in the least horrid of
you. I will gladly do all I can to help you."</p>
<p>Tuesday came at length and Alice Carden went away, leaving May to her own
melancholy thoughts. She had not seen Harry Fielden for a few days and was
thankful he had not been near her. It would be hard parting from him. It would
be difficult to say good-bye without betraying herself or giving him some
inkling of what had happened. After lunch on Wednesday she stole out of the
house and walked to the station. She had sent on her luggage by Alice Carden
the day before, so that when she left for London it might seem that she was
only going for a casual visit. She would not mind the new life, so she thought,
and she hardened her heart as she looked out of the carriage window. But, all
the same, she was glad to find herself alone, for the tears would come and the
old familiar landscape grew dim and blurred.</p>
<p>What would they say, she wondered, when they knew. What would Harry Fielden
think? But, at that very moment, Harry Fielden had something else to occupy his
attention. He was walking across the Downs towards Haredale Park with Raffle,
and the latter was speaking his mind very freely.</p>
<p>"I won't be quiet, sir, and I won't keep my mouth shut," he said. "I tell
you, Mr. Harry, it is a foul conspiracy and there are no two ways about it. Sir
George gave Mallow a week to try to pull the colt round, and he says, says he,
'Mallow, if he's no better by that time, he's to be scratched.' Those were the
instructions and Sir George confirmed them this morning. Now I am not going to
say that the colt is much better, but I am prepared to pledge my reputation,
and it is worth something, that I'll get him fit in a month. The whole thing
has been arranged between Sir George and that man Copley, so that the horse can
be scratched for the Derby. The public are to believe that Sir George has been
unfortunate, but has played the game like a gentleman and a sportsman. Well,
you may have what opinion you like, but I know better. Mind you, if I didn't
know what I know I should have to put up with it and hold my tongue, because I
am only a servant and no one can blame me for obeying my orders. But I have
been making inquiries, and I find that Copley and his gang have been laying
thick and thin against the colt for the past week. Do you mean to tell me they
could know the colt would be scratched if they hadn't got Sir George in their
power?"</p>
<p>"What do you want me to do?" Fielden asked.</p>
<p>A bitter smile crossed the old man's face.</p>
<p>"I shouldn't have thought you'd ask what you were to do, sir," he said. "But
I'm not going to stand it. I'm not going to sit down quietly and see this game
going on. I daresay you think it will be bad for Miss May if this thing comes
out. But bless you! if you go the right way to work nothing will leak out. The
colt mustn't be scratched. You leave him where he is and he's certain to win
the Derby. You are the very man to step in and stop the game. Let Sir George
know what your power is. Let Copley see that he's got a gentleman to deal with.
It will ruin Copley and his mob, but that doesn't matter. They are a fine set
of thieves, if you ask me, sir, and I shouldn't mind telling Copley so. Now I
would like to hear your opinion."</p>
<p>Fielden had no particular opinion to offer. At the same time, he had
information in his possession which would have astonished Raffle if he could
only have seen into the mind of his old master. Pressing as the matter was, it
was not possible to act on the spur of the moment, and Fielden contented
himself by saying he would think over the matter.</p>
<p>"But you can't do it, sir," Raffle protested. "There's no time to waste like
that. The colt has to be scratched and maybe a telegram's already gone to
London to that effect. The mischief may be done."</p>
<p>"By Jove, I hadn't thought of that," Fielden exclaimed. "All right, Joe, it
will be a most unpleasant piece of business, but I see now that it must not be
put off any longer. I'll go straight over to Haredale Park and see Sir George
at once."</p>
<p>Sir George was in his library. He had given instructions to the butler to
deny him to every one. In fact, he was seated by the library fire reading a
letter which May had left for him. She had not minced matters. She had gone
away for reasons well known to him, she said, and her address mattered nothing
to anybody. Sir George was looking particularly old and grey and troubled as
Fielden thrust his way past the butler and entered the library. Sir George's
manner was not encouraging, and he curtly demanded to know the meaning of this
intrusion.</p>
<p>"I am sorry," Fielden said, "but my business would not wait. Am I to
understand that you have struck the Blenheim colt out of the Derby? Is it
done?"</p>
<p>"It's not done yet," Sir George said indignantly, "but it will be done this
afternoon. Perhaps you have some objection to make. Perhaps you would like to
forbid it?"</p>
<p>"I do and must," Fielden said quietly. "The horse does not belong to you at
all. He happens to be mine."</p>
<h2><a id="chap37" name="chap37">XXXVII. BETWEEN TWO FIRES</a></h2>
<p class="first">Sir George Haredale pulled himself together.</p>
<p>"You will excuse me," he said, "but I don't follow you. I have had much
trouble and worry lately and I am not myself this morning. Did you say that the
Blenheim colt belonged to you? If this is a joke I cannot say I admire it."</p>
<p>"I assure you I was never more serious in my life, Sir George," Fielden
protested. "I know what I say sounds extraordinary. The Blenheim colt belongs
to me; it was never yours at all; in fact, it is not even entered in this
year's Derby in your name. I have been making inquiries, and this is a literal
fact. I have derived my information from headquarters. The conditions, monetary
and otherwise, have been complied with&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't doubt it for a moment," Sir George exclaimed. "But what has all
this to do with me? When you went abroad I bought every animal you
possessed."</p>
<p>"I don't think so, Sir George. One or two were kept back; Raffle did so on
his own responsibility. My solicitors have the papers and receipts, so that it
is possible to earmark your exact purchases. I may tell you, however, that
until I came here, I had no notion of this singular business. It appears that I
forgot to advise my bankers before I left England and that, even up to the
present moment, they are meeting my racing obligations out of the surplus
moneys paid into my account. Now according to what Raffle says, <i>your</i>
colt, I mean your entry for this year's Derby, was disposed of long ago. My
colt Raffle kept for sentimental reasons and, for the last two years, he has
been trained with your horses. Raffle has always declared that some day he
would do something great with one of the Blenheim blood. When he found out how
good a thing he had he was almost frightened. He was on the point of confessing
to you several times, but when he heard that I was dead he decided to let
matters slide. Raffle has a vein of sentiment in his nature and, I suppose, the
romance of the thing appealed to him. Besides, he knew that you were a friend
of mine and that May was more than a friend. He is very fond of your daughter,
in which he shows his good taste. So the foolish old man resolved to keep the
secret to himself. He had transferred his allegiance to you and yours and had
set his heart upon restoring your family fortunes; in reality he was giving May
a comfortable and settled future. He didn't want the money for himself. He was
satisfied to feel that he was repaying the kindness he had had at your hands.
From a lofty moral point of view the thing may be open to censure, but what I
am able to prove I say through my lawyers, through my bankers, through Raffle
himself, and through other witnesses whom we can produce. Of course I am in
your debt for training expenses, but that, at the moment, is beside the point.
The point is that the Blenheim colt which, bar accidents, is certain to win
this year's Derby, as you are perfectly well aware&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I am not so sure of that," Sir George interrupted. "If I am to believe what
Raffle says&mdash;"</p>
<p>"We will come to that," Fielden went on. "I think otherwise. The horse has
been knocked about in the betting a good deal lately and I am told that he has
gone to an outside price again. I have managed to scrape together about two
thousand pounds, every penny of which I have put upon the colt. I had made up
my mind never to make another bet, but this opportunity is too good to be lost.
If this horse wins the Derby, then I shall be a rich man again. If that good
fortune is in store for me, it will be the last bet I shall ever make. And now,
you understand why, apart from the morality of the thing, I object to the horse
being scratched. In fact, you are not in a position to do so."</p>
<p>Sir George rubbed his head bewilderingly.</p>
<p>"Please say it all over again," he asked. "I know you mean everything you
say, I know you are not joking with me, but I can't understand it."</p>
<p>Fielden went over his points once more slowly and carefully, and then, at
last, Sir George began to see. He did not fail to grasp his own position,
either. He knew the peril in which he stood, unless he could persuade Fielden
to fall in with his plans. But Fielden had told him he had backed the colt for
all he was worth, and he was not likely to ruin himself merely to save an old
man from the result of his folly. Besides, this would entail a shameful
confession, for Sir George was not aware that Fielden had an intelligent view
of the situation.</p>
<p>"This is very awkward," he remarked.</p>
<p>"I don't see why it should be," Fielden said coolly. "You can make a
fortune, too. You have backed the horse heavily, and nothing in the race has
any chance of beating him. I must consider myself. I have learnt the folly of
sacrificing myself to my friends. In this affair I have some one to think about
besides myself. May&mdash;"</p>
<p>"May! What has she to do with it?"</p>
<p>Fielden hesitated. He hated to give anybody pain, but the time had come to
speak plainly.</p>
<p>"She has a great deal to do with it," he said. "Whatever disgrace falls upon
you cannot affect her good name. But, at the same time, I strongly object to
any one being able to say that my future wife's father had been warned off the
turf for malpractices."</p>
<p>"Malpractices!" Sir George cried. "My dear Fielden, you are forgetting
yourself. Explain, please."</p>
<p>"I had much rather not," Fielden said. "But since you force me to speak, I
must go on. I happen to know a good deal about Mr. Raymond Copley. I know you
are deeply in his debt. I know that he helped you, because he hoped thereby to
compel you to coerce May into a marriage with him. I am given to understand
that you have done your best. I beg of you, Sir George, not to interrupt me.
You have challenged me and I have a right to state my case. Copley is a
scoundrel. I knew something about him in South Africa, though we never met. But
he was in constant contact with a sort of partner of mine named Aaron Phillips.
Phillips and I contrived to get an option on a diamond mine and, but for
unforeseen circumstances, we should have made a fortune out of it. But the
locality was kept a secret. The only man who knew where it was died and we had
nothing but some plans to go on. Copley and Foster heard of this and resolved
to get hold of those plans. The plans have vanished and probably will never be
seen again. Then these two ruffians tried to murder Phillips. Indirectly they
nearly murdered me. Phillips came back to England and sought me out. If he
thought it worth while he could put the police on the track of Copley and
Foster and they would be certain of penal servitude. But Phillips has other
views. He has been following up these two men like a sleuth-hound and you may
take my word for it that within a few days both Copley and Foster will be
arrested in connection with one of the biggest turf frauds of recent years. Oh,
I know what I am talking about."</p>
<p>"Bless me!" Sir George cried, "is this true?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. I know about the whole thing. I know how the scheme has been
worked and could put my hand upon the confederates at the present moment. But
you will see for yourself before the week is out. You must not say a word of
this to a living soul, and if you meet Copley during the next day or two I will
ask you to behave towards him as if he were still a friend. Now you see the
kind of man who has you in his toils. Simply because Copley has a powerful hold
on you, you have promised to draw the pen through the name of the Blenheim
colt. I won't unduly blame you, Sir George; no man knows how weak he is till he
is face to face with a great trouble and a great temptation. Was not that the
situation? Copley is in a position to turn you out of Haredale Park. He offers
to cancel the debt if you will scratch the colt. At that moment the colt falls
providentially lame. You can oblige him without a soul being any the wiser, and
even gain popular applause over it, and make a fortune out of it by working it
the right way."</p>
<p>"Not a penny," Sir George said emphatically.</p>
<p>"Well, I am glad to hear you say that. At the same time, I can't forget what
you were willing to do. At any rate, I am preventing you from something in the
nature of a crime. You can't interfere with my property, but you can refuse to
carry out what Copley desires and defy him to do his worst. You are safe from
him, and in future your daughter will have no occasion to be ashamed of
you."</p>
<h2><a id="chap38" name="chap38">XXXVIII. LOOSENING THE GRIP</a></h2>
<p class="first">Fielden's last thrust went home. Sir George fairly winced and
the red of shame flushed his face. Never in the course of his life had anybody
ever spoken to him like this before. And never did he feel less able to resist
the reproach.</p>
<p>"You are going too far," was all he could say.</p>
<p>"Indeed, I have no wish to," Fielden exclaimed. "I only want to save you
from this crowning folly, and you need not be afraid of Copley. He is powerless
to do you any mischief. Of course, you will still owe the money to somebody,
but ere the law can make up its mind who is your creditor, if we have any luck
at Epsom, you will be independent of all your creditors. Nobody need know of
this. You may rest assured that not a word of it will ever pass my lips, and
not even May shall be told."</p>
<p>"I am afraid she knows already," Sir George rejoined. "It is useless, my
dear boy, for me to combat your statements farther. I thought I was an honest
English gentleman, and now I find that at a turn of the screw I am only a
pitiful scoundrel. I fear that May has found out all about it. I was anxious
she should marry Copley, for salvation seemed to lie that way, and I was under
great obligations to the man. I was so annoyed with May that I said more than I
should have done; indeed, I lost my temper and, in the heat of the moment, told
her that if she did not obey me in this matter she was no longer a daughter of
mine. Of course, I did not mean it."</p>
<p>Fielden walked to the window and back before he ventured on a reply. Hot
words hovered on his lips and anger filled his heart, but he tried to speak
calmly.</p>
<p>"That, to say the least of it, was indiscreet," he said. "If I know May, and
I think I do, she is the last girl in the world to put up with treatment like
that."</p>
<p>"She didn't put up with it," Sir George confessed miserably. "She has gone,
taking with her nothing but her mother's jewels which she intends to turn into
money. In her letter to me she refuses to say where she is. She says she is
going to get her own living and will never come back to Haredale. She must know
what took place between Copley and me last night, for she alludes to something
she overheard in the library. I wonder if you can help me?"</p>
<p>Fielden groaned aloud. He had not expected a bitter disappointment like
this. He was anxious to avoid scandal. Of course, the public would have to hear
the strange story which, like a romance, clothed the Blenheim colt. But there
was nothing in that to be ashamed of, nothing which would reflect on the honour
either of Sir George or himself. Nor would the vast army of race-goers suffer.
But the disappearance of May had altered all that. People would ask questions
and neighbours were sure to talk. For the moment it seemed as if Fielden's
efforts had been wasted, then an inspiration shot into his mind and he took
comfort from it.</p>
<p>"I think I know where to find her," he said. "But it may take me a few days
and, meanwhile, you had better let it be known that May has gone away on a
visit. We will assume that she is staying with Miss Carden for the present. I
need not detain you longer. You will know what to do when Copley turns up to
ascertain why the Blenheim colt has not been scratched. For obvious reasons we
won't make the discovery public just yet; in fact, I see no reason why it
should be made public at all. We can trust May, and I am sure we can trust
Raffle, though you will have to tell Copley the truth. Still, as he will be in
other hands before long, nothing he can say or do will matter much. I am going
up to London and shall be greatly surprised if, when I come back, I don't bring
you news of May."</p>
<p>Fielden took his departure, leaving Sir George to his own troubled thoughts.
He was properly ashamed of himself. He knew what a humiliating figure he had
cut. He knew how two people, whose opinions he valued highly, despised him.
Yet, in spite of everything, himself included, he was glad to know that he
would be compelled to keep faith with the public. He was glad to know that
within a few days Copley would have no further power to harm him. He had known
all along, juggle with his conscience as he might, that old Raffle had been
perfectly correct in regard to the colt. Notwithstanding the folly of that
appearance at Mirst Park, the colt was not so lame as he had made out and in a
week or two would be all right again. At the present moment if he risked a
thousand or two, there was almost absolute certainty he would get it back
fifty-fold at the great Epsom meeting. As Sir George pondered the situation,
his mind was equally divided between shame and exultation. He did not fail to
see his conduct in its proper light, nor did he fail to see an honourable way
out, with credit to himself and a good many thousands in his pocket. He sat
thinking until it was time for his solitary dinner. He had proved everything to
his satisfaction before he returned to the library for a cigar. He would have
given anything to have had May back again, for once she was under his roof, the
way looked perfectly clear. He was still weighing the pros and cons when Copley
strode angrily into the library.</p>
<p>He had entered unannounced and looked at Sir George with the light of battle
in his eye. He stood an imposing, bullying figure. But the master of the house
was not afraid.</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this?" Copley demanded. "I hope you are not trying
to shirk your obligations, because if you do, by gad, I shall have to teach you
a lesson."</p>
<p>"You mean about the colt?" Sir George asked.</p>
<p>"What else could I mean? You promised he should be scratched this afternoon.
It hadn't been done when I left London at six o'clock. Why?"</p>
<p>"Sit down and have a cigar," Sir George said, "and I'll explain to you. But
don't adopt that tone to me, because I don't like it. I am not accustomed to
it."</p>
<p>Copley burst into an offensive laugh.</p>
<p>"Oh, aren't you?" he said. "We'll precious soon see about that. No, I don't
want a cigar or anything to drink. I'll go home again and perhaps I can find
another way&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I don't think it will make much difference," Sir George said mildly. "I
didn't scratch the colt for the simple reason that I find I haven't the
power."</p>
<p>"Haven't the power? What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"I assure you I am speaking the truth. I wasn't in the least aware of it
myself till this afternoon. It is quite a story in its way. Now do, please, sit
down and listen. The man you know as Field is the son of an old friend of mine
named Fielden, who at one time owned a considerable amount of property
hereabouts. You may have heard some of the neighbours speak of him. The son
preferred not to be known by his proper name, and that is why I introduced him
to you as Field. Now Field, or Fielden, whichever you like to call him, is
really the owner of the Blenheim colt. If you will be quiet I will tell you all
about it. By the way, Fielden knows a good deal about you and also about your
friend Foster. He ran against you in South Africa where he was in partnership
with a man called Aaron Phillips. I don't know Mr. Phillips myself, but he
tells a story which interested me very much. I have just had it from Mr.
Fielden's lips. But sit down."</p>
<p>Copley sat down suddenly. His bullying air fell away from him like a
garment. He seemed to have some difficulty in getting a light to his cigar. Sir
George could almost have smiled as he saw the change in his one-time friend.
There was a look of anxiety, almost of anxious misery, in Copley's eyes as he
wriggled about in his chair whilst Sir George told his tale.</p>
<p>"There you have it in a nutshell," the latter concluded. "That is the whole
romance for you to deal with as you like. It doesn't matter a bit whether I
want to serve you or not, you can see for yourself the position I am in and how
powerless I am to prevent the Blenheim colt from running in this year's Derby.
Mr. Fielden would not consent, even if he hadn't backed the colt to his last
penny. You may depend upon it that if the horse starts he is bound to win, for
in this year's moderate lot there is nothing to beat him. This upsets all your
plans, but you will find that everything I say is correct. You have still time
to get out."</p>
<p>"How can I?" Copley asked. "Why, I have laid against the colt till I am
tired of it, and if he runs he'll win. But it is no use my sitting here wasting
time. I must go back at once and talk this thing over with Foster. I never
heard such an extraordinary story in my life. I thought I was up to most of the
moves, but a prophet couldn't have foreseen this. One thing is very certain, as
matters have turned out I shall want every penny I can scrape together the next
few days and I shall look to you to repay what you owe me. Of course, I don't
want to be unpleasant, but necessity knows no law."</p>
<p>Sir George waved his cigar gracefully. He felt he could promise with an easy
mind.</p>
<p>"Don't let that trouble you," he said. "I think I shall be able to manage.
Circumstances alter cases. Must you really go?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap39" name="chap39">XXXIX. A DRAMATIC EXIT</a></h2>
<p class="first">May had taken her fortune in her own hands. She had, as she
thought, shaken the dust of Haredale Park from her feet for ever. There was no
reason, she thought, why she should not make her own way in the world. Her
trinkets were more valuable than she had expected. She had disposed of one for
a hundred pounds, and had no anxiety as to the immediate future. But she was
miserable enough. Lodgings seemed to cramp and confine her. She missed the pure
air of the Downs, and longed once more to feel the exhilarating stride of a
good horse under her. At the end of three days she would have given her pride
and all her possessions to be back at Haredale. Already she was trying to think
of some excuse for returning home.</p>
<p>She did not know how near her wishes were to being gratified. She was not
aware that Fielden was looking for her all over London. He had jumped to the
correct conclusion that he would find her near to Alice Carden, but the trouble
was to obtain Miss Carden's address. It was not till the Saturday morning that
he ran against Phillips, who fortunately knew where Carden lived.</p>
<p>"You won't find him at home," he said.</p>
<p>"I don't want him," Fielden smiled. "Thank you very much. I'll see you later
in the day, perhaps."</p>
<p>"I'm busy," Phillips said darkly. "I've a good many things to do this
morning. I've to interview Selwyn and other big plungers. After that, I have an
appointment with one of the leading men of Scotland Yard, which will take us
down to Mirst Park with a view to going over a certain house we wot of."</p>
<p>Phillips bustled away and Fielden lost no time in seeking out the modest
residence of Major Carden. He was disappointed to hear that Miss Carden was
out, but it was gratifying to be told that Miss Carden's friend was in the
house. Without waiting for further information, Fielden walked upstairs into
the room where May was seated. She had pulled a chair up dejectedly in front of
the fire and started at the sound of Fielden's voice. There were tears in her
eyes.</p>
<p>"So you have found me out."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, I have run you to earth," Fielden smiled. "I have been looking for
you for three days. I had some difficulty in getting the Major's address, but
felt quite sure that when I had that you would not be far off. Like me, May,
you have not many friends. And now, don't you think you have been foolish?"</p>
<p>May smiled through her tears.</p>
<p>"But what else could I do?" she asked. "Oh, my dear boy, if you knew
everything you would not blame me."</p>
<p>"I think I do know everything," Fielden said gravely. "At any rate, I know
why you left home. I had a long interview with your father, and&mdash;well, I
won't blame him. None of us know what we would do in a temptation like that.
That scoundrel Copley had him entirely in his power. Now, tell me, do you know
anything of the great conspiracy? Were you in the library the night before you
left home, and did you hear Sir George and Copley&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I heard everything," May exclaimed. "I must tell you, Harry; I must tell
somebody. I never felt so ashamed and humiliated in my life. It was bad enough
to be turned out of the house because I refused to marry that man, but when I
found that my father had entered into a plot with Mr. Copley to do a
disgraceful thing, I felt I could not stay at home any longer. I suppose the
mischief is done and the Blenheim colt has been struck out of the Derby. But
though the public will never know how they have been swindled, I shall always
feel that my father&mdash;"</p>
<p>The girl broke down.</p>
<p>"You need not worry about that," Fielden said. "I quite understand what your
feelings are. But what you so greatly dread will never happen. Disgrace will be
spared you and yours, because your father has not the power to interfere with
the colt. Possibly before the day is out Copley will be as helpless as a child.
You look surprised and I don't wonder. I am going to tell you something in the
nature of a romance. To begin with, the Blenheim colt belongs to me."</p>
<p>May was too surprised to speak. She sat on the arm of Fielden's chair. She
did not seem to notice that his arm was around her, and that her head was very
near his shoulder. She did not seem to care about anything now that Fielden was
with her, and there was a link between the past and the present. It was a
fascinating story which Fielden had to tell, much more remarkable than anything
May had ever read of between the covers of a sporting novel. When the recital
was finished she wiped the tears from her eyes, and a happy smile broke over
her face. On the spur of the moment she bent down and kissed her companion.</p>
<p>"Did any one ever hear the like of it?" she exclaimed. "It seems almost too
good to be true. It is more like a fairy story than literal fact. But I am glad
for your sake, for my sake, and for my father's sake. For he is my father, and
it is possible that in his position I might have acted in a like heedless and
foolish way. It would have been a terrible blow for him to leave Haredale Park.
It is only since I have been in lodgings that I have come to realize what it
means to have no home, what it was to turn out of such a dear old place as
Haredale. But, Harry, we don't appear to be out of the wood yet. It will be a
bitter disappointment to Mr. Copley and his colleague to be deprived of their
chance of swindling the public. I am sure Mr. Copley will be none the less
vindictive against my father, because this was no fault of his. I am afraid we
shall have to leave Haredale in any case."</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Fielden said. "Before long Copley will be powerless. We
shall be able to hang on till Derby Day; then the gallant colt will win
fortunes for all of us, and I shall be a rich man again. I shall be able to
restore the old house and buy back the land, and then I shall have a home fit
to ask my wife to. After that we shall be happy, only there won't be any more
betting and gambling, because I have learnt my lesson, and it will be all the
more effectual and lasting because it has been bitter. Meanwhile nobody knows
anything about your trouble with your father except myself and, I presume, Miss
Carden. You are supposed to be on a visit to London for a few days. It is lucky
you have no maid to make mischief. I must return to Haredale this evening. Let
me tell your father that I have explained everything to you, that you are
coming back on Monday or Tuesday, and that Miss Carden will accompany you. I
know Sir George will be glad to see you. He told me he could not understand how
he spoke to you as he did. And, you see, as there is no one to follow your
father, as the title will die out with him, Haredale Park will be your own some
day. I know you love the place."</p>
<p>"I couldn't tell you how much," May said unsteadily. "It is only during the
last few days that I have realized the depth of my affection. I will come back.
You may tell father I said so. I will return on Monday as early as possible and
I hope you will be there to meet me. I thought I was going to be brave and
strong and earn my own living; I thought that wanted no more than the pluck one
has to exhibit in the hunting-field. But it is quite different. It must be a
matter of custom and surroundings. It is all very well to run up to London to
spend a few days with friends, but when you are alone, as I have been, the very
size of the place frightens one. You don't know how glad I shall be to be home
again. Why, twenty-four hours after I came here I began to cast about for
reasons and excuses for going back."</p>
<p>An hour later Fielden left, at peace with all mankind and inclined to take a
roseate view of the future. Everything depended on the Blenheim colt. The path
was clear and those chiefly concerned were going to have a straight run for
their money. The poisonous influence of Copley would be removed. There would be
peace and happiness at Haredale Park once more and, above all, May was coming
home.</p>
<p>Fielden flung himself down in the corner of his carriage and proceeded to
open a late edition of an evening paper. He read the racing news of interest,
then turned to the news items on the fifth page. Two headlines caught his
attention at once and held him fascinated. They were sensational enough even to
the ordinary person, but to Fielden they were pregnant with meaning.</p>
<p>"ALLEGED GREAT TURF FRAUDS.</p>
<p>"ARREST OF MR. COPLEY AND MR. FOSTER.</p>
<p>"Late this afternoon, the well-known financier, Mr. Raymond Copley, and his
private secretary, Mr. Foster, were arrested in London on a warrant in
connection with some alleged turf frauds which took place recently at the Post
Club. We understand that the warrant was granted at the instance of Mr.
Selwyn."</p>
<h2><a id="chap40" name="chap40">XL. CAUGHT!</a></h2>
<p class="first">Raymond Copley went away from Haredale Park with every ounce
of fight knocked out of him. Never for a moment had he anticipated a
development like this. He had gone there in his most truculent mood. Everything
seemed to be prospering with him. He had only to hold out his hand and all
would drop into it. He had no fear Sir George would defy him. Rather had he
taken a journey across the fields in order to manifest his power.</p>
<p>There had been no actual necessity for Sir George to put his colt out of the
betting yet; indeed, it would have been diplomatic to wait for another
fortnight. But Sir George must be shown that he could not do as he liked. He
must understand the force he had to deal with in Copley.</p>
<p>Now it had all vanished like a dream. The thing appeared incredible to
Copley as he walked homewards. He could not realize it. He was not disposed to
regard Sir George's story as a deliberate lie, for it bore the impress of
truth. The only way to settle the thing once and for all was to ask for
absolute proof. But, if this were done, Harry Fielden would protest and, if he
did so, the public would learn what was going on. Taking it altogether, the
risk was too great.</p>
<p>He would have to find some other way out of his difficulties. He had laid
against the Blenheim colt thick and thin. He had literally piled the money
against it with the comfortable assurance that it would never run at all, and
that he was about to net a huge fortune without a pennyworth of risk. That
prospect had vanished at a blow. If he stayed in England he would have to pay
these debts, or the turf would know him no more. And if posted at Tattersall's,
his career was at an end. There would be no more chance of making money in that
way. He would have to start an entirely new plan if he meant to keep up his
r&ocirc;le of millionaire. But millionaires do not repudiate their racing
debts, and Copley could see nothing but ruin wherever he looked.</p>
<p>There was worse behind, too. It was disturbing to know that in some
mysterious manner Aaron Phillips was mixed up in this business. But he had made
no sign. He had not come near Copley, nor had he attempted to extort money from
him. Yet he was actually a sort of partner with Harry Fielden, who had taken
service with Copley under the name of Field. The more Copley thought over the
matter the less he liked it. He had known Fielden by name, although they had
never met. He realized for the first time that he had a deadly enemy under his
own roof, so to speak. How much did these two know?</p>
<p>Well, it wouldn't be difficult to discover. He would send for Fielden
directly he got back to Seton Manor and pump him judiciously. Foster awaited
him with the air of a man who finds the world a good place to live in. He
looked uneasy, however, as he noted the expression of his employer's face.</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Matter enough," Copley growled. "It's all over, my friend. You can say
good-bye to your dreams of fortune. If we can get away with a whole skin we
shall be lucky. As far as I can make out, we have made ourselves liable for
thirty or forty thousand pounds, and have nothing to pay it with."</p>
<p>"Well, that's all right," Foster said.</p>
<p>"Oh, is it? I suppose you will admit that if the Blenheim colt turns out fit
and well for the Derby there is nothing to beat him."</p>
<p>"If he does turn out. But he won't."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, he will. But I'll tell you the story and if you can show me some
way out you are a cleverer man than I take you for."</p>
<p>Foster listened with deepest interest. He looked just as anxious and haggard
as Copley by the time the story was finished. For a long time he sat gnawing
his fingers.</p>
<p>"It's a facer," he said presently. "That horse will run, and he'll win, too,
unless we can find some means of preventing him from starting. We <i>must</i>
find some means."</p>
<p>Copley threw up his hand impatiently.</p>
<p>"What's the good of talking that rot?" he said. "The age for getting at
horses is past. That was done with years ago. Even the sporting writer wouldn't
dare to use a situation like this. You must think of something better than
that. If the worst comes to the worst we've got a few weeks to turn round
between now and Derby day. Sir George owes me forty thousand pounds, which I
must get without delay. It is no use thinking anything more about May Haredale.
With that money we may be able to cover our loss or hedge and bring it down to
a trifle. We shall have to be contented with what we make over the Mirst Park
meeting. So long as Rickerby and that set are not suspicious&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I begin to fear they are," Foster interrupted. "As you know, we ought to
have had a big cheque last week, but it hasn't come, though I wrote a sharp
letter about it again the day before yesterday. I don't know whether Rickerby
suspects, or whether he will refuse to pay, but in the face of what you have
learnt the non-receipt of that cheque is alarming. Nor do I like what you say
about Phillips and this chap Fielden. Phillips is a dangerous man and owes us a
grudge. Let's have Fielden in. We may be able to bully something out of
him."</p>
<p>Copley jumped at the idea. He rang the bell and sent for Fielden, who
appeared presently cool and collected, and ready to answer any questions.</p>
<p>"Look here," Copley said in his most overbearing manner, "I've been hearing
things about you. I am told your name is not Field at all, but Fielden. Is that
so?"</p>
<p>"That is quite correct," Harry said calmly.</p>
<p>"Then, what the devil do you mean by coming into my service under false
pretences? No honest man&mdash;"</p>
<p>"I'll thank you not to take that tone with me," Fielden said. "We don't want
to discuss the question of honesty. It is a subject on which you are not an
authority. But I see you have found out everything and I may as well be candid.
I entered your service because I had nothing to do. I assumed the name of
Field, because I found nobody recognized me and I didn't want any of my old
friends to know what I was doing. I suppose I am correct in assuming that Sir
George Haredale has told you everything. Probably he has informed you that my
partner in South Africa was Aaron Phillips. I need not ask if you know Aaron
Phillips, because that would be superfluous. I never met either of you till I
returned to England, but I know about you. Phillips knows more. I am also aware
of the conspiracy for preventing the Blenheim colt from running in the Derby,
but that scheme is frustrated. Have you any more to say?"</p>
<p>"This is a nice way to speak to an employer," Copley protested.</p>
<p>"It would be if I were still in your employ," Fielden retorted. "But I no
longer consider myself your servant. There is no occasion for me to remain with
you. Perhaps the next time we meet&mdash;but never mind about that."</p>
<p>Fielden turned curtly on his heel and left the room. The other two exchanged
significant glances.</p>
<p>"Pretty cool," Foster muttered.</p>
<p>"Yes, and pretty sure of his ground, too," Copley replied. "I don't like it,
Foster, I don't like it a bit. I have a feeling that those fellows know
everything. It frightens me to think that Phillips has been lying low for so
long. You may depend upon it he is up to some mischief. And now that you tell
me you have not received Rickerby's cheque I feel all the more certain of it.
Don't you think it would be as well to go over to The Nook and remove that
telephone? It always struck me as a dangerous thing to leave it on the roof.
You never know what inquisitive people there may be about. If anybody
acquainted with racing only saw it they would be sure to make inquiries. We had
better take the car and run over before it is dark. What do you say?"</p>
<p>Foster had no objection; in fact, he rather liked the idea. Half an hour
later the car was crossing the country and before dusk the two reached their
destination. They were later than they had expected in consequence of a
breakdown on the road, but they seemed to be in time, for the house was quiet
and deserted and, so far as they could see, nobody had been meddling with the
telephone. Foster drew down the blinds and lit the gas. It had not occurred to
him to lock the front door. There was no occasion for hurry and, after
procuring a chest of tools, he started on his work, which presented few
difficulties.</p>
<p>Then the door opened and two men walked deliberately into the hall. Copley
turned upon them with a snarl.</p>
<h2><a id="chap41" name="chap41">XLI. HOME AGAIN</a></h2>
<p class="first">"What do you mean by this?" Copley demanded.</p>
<p>The intruders were not in the least abashed. On the contrary, they had every
evidence of being very sure of their ground. The foremost touched Copley on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>"Mr. Raymond Copley, I believe?" he said politely.</p>
<p>"It would be foolish to deny it," Copley sneered.</p>
<p>"Very good, sir," the stranger went on. "And this other gentleman is Mr.
Foster?"</p>
<p>Foster nodded uneasily. He held the screwdriver he was using and waited for
developments with white face and quivering lips.</p>
<p>"That being so, gentlemen," the stranger said, "I may as well introduce
myself. I am Inspector Andrews of Scotland Yard and this is my assistant. We
have a warrant for the arrest of both of you on the charge of obtaining a large
sum of money by means of a trick from Mr. Selwyn and others in connection with
race meetings at Mirst Park. The warrant was obtained on the information of Mr.
Selwyn, and you will please consider yourselves my prisoners. Anything you say,
of course, will be given in evidence against you."</p>
<p>Copley cursed himself under his breath. What a fool he had been to come
here! The matter would have been bad enough if he had been arrested at Seton
Manor, but to be taken here, to be identified in this fashion at The Nook was
fatal. There was nothing for it in the circumstances but to try to bluster.</p>
<p>"This is an outrage," he exclaimed. "It is a mere tale to extort money from
a man in my position. You haven't a scrap of evidence to justify a proceeding
like this."</p>
<p>"That remains to be proved, sir," the Inspector said quietly. "I may say
that your accomplice, Captain Eversleigh, is already in custody and is
volunteering all the information we require. We have also arrested the man
Chaffey in the neighbourhood of Covent Garden. More than that, we have
interviewed the National Telephone authorities, and they have not been
reticent, either. Besides that, we can produce the agent who let this house and
who has already identified you. Also, we have taken possession of the office of
Jolly &amp; Co., and your accomplice there is in our hands also. I don't think
we have left anything undone. We motored to Seton Manor, but you had left just
before we arrived. We kept you under observation till now. Come, Mr. Copley,
nothing will be gained by taking this attitude. I am telling you this in
fairness to yourself so that you may know what you have to answer."</p>
<p>Copley was done and submitted quietly to have the handcuffs put upon his
wrists. Foster seemed equally subdued. He advanced towards the Inspector's
assistant, then suddenly lunged forward, brushed him aside, and darted through
the door into the open air. Instantly he was lost in the thick bushes.
Inspector Andrews shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>"You are to blame for that," he said. "No, it is no use following him just
now. We must pick him up later. Mr. Copley, if you are quite ready we'll get
back to London."</p>
<p>An hour later Copley was safely housed. By seven o'clock his name was
ringing from one end of London to the other. At first the published details
were meagre, but the extra specials contained fuller tidings. They had managed
to ferret out some racing particulars and to interview Rickerby, who was not in
the least reticent. By ten o'clock Copley's arrest formed the one topic of
conversation in the clubs. His name appeared largely on every poster and the
South African millionaire found himself notorious.</p>
<p>The news even reached the ears of May Haredale and her friend Alice. They
had been treating themselves to the theatre in honour of recent events and
paused on their way home to buy a paper. There was plenty to discuss as they
partook of their frugal supper and they sat till late with the paper between
them.</p>
<p>"You have had a lucky escape," Alice said.</p>
<p>"My father has," May replied. "I would never have married that man. I would
have starved first. I never liked him and always felt there was something wrong
about him. He won't trouble us any more and I only hope this terrible business
won't upset my father."</p>
<p>"Don't let us talk any more about it," Alice said. "Let us think about
nothing else but your going home again. I don't know how I shall manage to stay
in London after this. My fortnight at Haredale Park spoilt me."</p>
<p>It is not necessary to say much about May's homecoming. Sir George met his
daughter in the hall. He waited to say a few words to Alice Carden and then led
May into the library.</p>
<p>"I hope you won't blame me, my child," he said. "I can say no more than that
I am exceedingly sorry for what happened. It was only after you had gone that I
realized what a brute I had been. I must have been mad. But I thought I was
going to be turned out of the old home, and to marry Copley&mdash;pardon me for
alluding to it&mdash;seemed such an easy way out of my difficulty. I know now
that women don't regard these things from the same standpoint as men do and, of
course, I believed Copley was in a strong position. I regarded him as honest
and straightforward, otherwise&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You could not have done that," May protested. "How could you? When you were
ready to fall in with his&mdash;but I won't say anything about that. All that
is past and done with for ever. As Harry Fielden said, no man knows how weak he
is till he is face to face with a great temptation. It is enough that you
sincerely regret what has happened. As for me, I am only too glad to return
home on any terms."</p>
<p>"You overwhelm me," Sir George murmured.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't feel like that, I implore you. But, tell me, what difference will
this make to you? I have heard about the strange story of the colt and how
Harry Fielden stepped in to prevent disgrace to our house. But that does not
alter the fact that you owe Mr. Copley a large sum of money. I suppose it will
have to be paid whether he is convicted or not."</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly," Sir George answered. "But my lawyer says it will be some time
before I am called upon to pay the money. I had a long interview with him this
morning. Everybody knows now that Raymond Copley is no millionaire and that he
is an unscrupulous adventurer who passed himself off as a wealthy man in order
to carry out his swindles. From a telegram I have just received a good many
fresh details came out this morning when Copley was brought up at Bow Street.
The magistrate has refused to allow bail, but it will be two or three months
before Copley is convicted, and during the interval some of his creditors are
sure to make him bankrupt. They will be anxious to rescue some of the plunder
and there are probably several thousand pounds in the bank besides all the
stuff at Seton Manor and other places. It will take time to investigate these
things, and possibly the summer will be over before the Bankruptcy officials
ask me to pay this money to Copley's estate. Long before that the Blenheim colt
will have won the Derby."</p>
<p>May could not repress a smile.</p>
<p>"You are always sanguine," she said. "In fact, if you hadn't been so
sanguine, you would not be in your present position. I suppose nobody knows of
our trouble."</p>
<p>"Only Harry Fielden," Sir George said thankfully. "I suppose, we shall have
to regard him as one of the family, though what he is going to live on and how
he is going to keep you, goodness knows. I've got nothing."</p>
<p>A smile crossed May's face.</p>
<p>"We are all going to make fortunes out of the colt," she said. "If you are
so sanguine, you must not grudge a little bit of a similar spirit to us. I know
that Harry has backed the colt for all he is worth. It is very dreadful and
wrong and extravagant, but Harry tells me that this will be the last time. How
singular that the fortunes of two families should depend upon a horse! Only
think, too, that, but for the merest accident, the Blenheim colt would not be
in the Derby at all. That makes me think our good fortune is to continue. I
don't think Fate would play us a low-down trick. It is impossible that the colt
has been saved only to speed us to ruin at the last. But I don't like to think
about it. I shall be in a fever of anxiety from now till May. But I'll try to
be calm. I must realize that this is my last bet."</p>
<p>Sir George was content to let it go at that. He was glad to have his
daughter back, glad to think that things were no worse. Fate, too, had been
kind to him, for he had preserved his name and reputation. He had lost nothing;
indeed, he stood to be in a better position than he had ever yet occupied. For
the first time for months he was looking forward to his dinner with gusto.</p>
<h2><a id="chap42" name="chap42">XLII. FIRST PAST THE POST</a></h2>
<p class="first">Things turned out much as Sir George's lawyer had predicted.
After several adjourned hearings Copley was committed for trial, together with
his associates, and Aaron Phillips had the satisfaction of giving the most
damning evidence against the accused. Of Foster nothing whatever had been heard
and it was assumed he had got safely out of the country. Copley's trial was set
down to take place in June and in the meantime some of his creditors had made
him a bankrupt. The bubble was pricked. Copley had nothing to gain by keeping
up the pretence of being a man of integrity and substance. He stood out now
unabashed and unashamed, and refused to give any information about his business
affairs. Perhaps he was looking forward to the time, some years hence, when on
his release from gaol he could blackmail Sir George Haredale.</p>
<p>But Sir George had already taken steps to obviate that. He had learnt his
lesson and was not likely to put himself in Copley's power again. A proper
statement of the relationship between Copley and himself had been rendered by
Sir George's lawyer and ample time had been given by the Bankruptcy officials
to pay the debt. Therefore Sir George could look forward with easy mind to the
momentous event at Epsom.</p>
<p>Everything went smoothly and Raffle pronounced the colt as fit to run for a
kingdom. The horse was established in the betting once more and at that moment
there were few more popular men in England than Sir George Haredale. He was
anxious, of course, for so much depended upon what was to take place between
now and next Wednesday, and Harry Fielden was not very far from the spot;
indeed, his feelings were like those of Sir George. His whole fortune, too,
depended upon the running of the colt. About the only member of the party who
was not unduly anxious was Raffle himself. He went about his business with a
knowing smile and refused to discuss even the possibility of defeat.</p>
<p>"Bless you, sir," he said to Fielden two days before the race, "I can't see
what you've got to fret about. The race is in our pockets. It wouldn't do to
disappoint the people now, for Epsom is Epsom. But that colt will just win from
the start. There ain't going to be any risks, because so much depends upon it.
What a story it would make, Mr. Harry, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>Fielden nodded. They were standing in the Blenheim colt's stall admiring the
noble animal, which looked fit to race for his own life. There was no sign of
staleness about him. He was apparently trained to the last ounce and, as Raffle
said, his temper was perfect.</p>
<p>"He won't mind the crowd and the horses," he said, laying his hand upon the
colt's glossy neck. "I never saw such a tractable animal. It is a proud day for
me to live to see the Blenheim blood doing a big thing like this. I always
believed in it, sir, though we had a good many failures. I wonder what the
public would say if they knew everything."</p>
<p>"They are not in the least likely to do that," Fielden laughed. "I think we
were wise to keep the whole thing to ourselves. It is just as well, too, to let
the colt run as Sir George's property. At any rate, there's no harm done and we
haven't broken any rules. Besides, it is all in the family. What are your plans
for to-morrow, Raffle? If you don't mind, I will go to Epsom with you. Sir
George and Miss Haredale can follow on Wednesday morning. I don't want to lose
sight of the colt if I can help it. I wish Wednesday was over."</p>
<p>Raffle highly approved the suggestion, so, on the morrow, they went off to
Epsom with the colt. They literally slept with it all Tuesday night. The
fateful Wednesday dawned without a cloud in the sky and by noon the Downs were
crowded with people. For the most part they meant to have a holiday, seeing
that they were on the favourite to a man and that the chance of the favourite
losing was as remote as a racing possibility could be. Shortly after two
o'clock Fielden left the paddock and went to join Sir George and May and Miss
Carden.</p>
<p>"I hope all is well," May whispered.</p>
<p>"It couldn't be better," Fielden said. "Another hour and you will be out of
your misery. The colt looks as fine as a star. We are having him saddled at the
top end of the course so that he won't be actually seen till he is ready for
the start. It will be a popular victory, May."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," May said nervously. "I suppose it will. I don't know when I felt
so anxious. I was looking forward to enjoying this race, but I don't think I
shall. I envy you, Harry. How can you keep so cool?"</p>
<p>Fielden smiled. In fact, he was anything but cool. He looked confident but,
at the same time, he was conscious of a dryness in his throat and of the
quicker beating of his heart as he weighed the possibilities which the next
hour held for him and the party from Haredale Park. At that moment he possessed
practically nothing. If by any untoward fate the horse lost he would be as poor
as he was before, and his marriage with May would be indefinitely postponed. In
case of this disaster Sir George would have to sell everything to pay his
mortgages and the money he owed to Copley's estate. He would have to spend the
rest of his days in humble lodgings. There would be an end to the glories of
Haredale.</p>
<p>But if the horse won! So much depended upon those four feet, upon those
wonderful staying powers of which Raffle had so frequently boasted. Hitherto
there had always been a weak spot in the Blenheim blood and it might crop up at
the very moment when so much depended upon bone and muscle and sinew.</p>
<p>And if everything did go well, why, then, Sir George Haredale would be a
rich man again. Fielden would have more than he ever possessed before and the
tarnished glory of the family would be restored. As he stood, quiet and
reserved, he did not look like a man to whom the next half-hour meant so much.
But he thought that half-hour would never be over.</p>
<p>The minutes wore on nevertheless. The roar and fret and murmur of the crowd
at last died down and the long winding ribbon of turf between the masses of
people began to manifest itself. The gay kaleidoscope of colour gradually
drifted into a ragged line at the post. Then a hoarse roar broke out again.</p>
<p>"They're off!" May whispered, clutching Fielden frantically by the arm. "You
must tell me how the race is going. Positively, I haven't the courage to
look."</p>
<p>Fielden did not hear a word she said. He had no consciousness of those tense
nervous fingers on his arm. He stood like a statue with his racing glasses
glued to his eyes. He watched the streaming glow of colours rigidly, until,
presently, it seemed to him that one horse came floating easily and gracefully
apart from the rest and then his heart began to sing within him. They came in
much the same order round Tattenham Corner. Then the roar intensified till
everything seemed to shake and rock, and Fielden trembled and could not see
through his glasses. When he finally adjusted them to his satisfaction, he was
conscious of a still deeper shout of gratification from the multitude. Then, as
if in response to the ringing cheers, the Blenheim colt drew almost
imperceptibly away from the ruck of horses and passed the winning-post a good
half length ahead. The Derby was ancient history now. The Blenheim colt had won
this classic race and a score or two of old friends were gathering round Sir
George to shake him by the hand. The victory was all the more popular because
ninety-nine out of every hundred spectators had backed the winner.</p>
<p>Fielden closed his glasses with a snap. He was conscious now that May was
clinging to his arm and that she was swaying backwards and forwards ominously.
It was only for a few moments, however, and then a slight smile trembled on her
lips.</p>
<p>"Take me away from here for a while," she whispered. "Let us take a walk on
the course. Do you know, I feel as if I could enjoy a turn on a roundabout. I
could even shy for cocoanuts. And only two or three minutes ago I felt as if I
were going to faint. I never saw a yard of the race. If I had looked up I
should have collapsed. I guessed how things were going only by the cheers of
the crowd. I knew by that exultant roar that the colt was winning. But I don't
want to go through it again, Harry, I have had enough. Now that we have all
made fortunes, it will be so good to be at home again and feel that everything
there actually belongs to us. Some of my father's old friends want us to dine
in London. But I would far rather go home. You must back me up."</p>
<p>But Sir George wanted no particular backing. Tried sportsman as he was, the
strain had told upon him and he was glad, so he said, to find himself once more
in a comfortable corner of a railway carriage on his way to Haredale. It was a
lovely evening, too, and the face of the old house was bathed in sunshine.</p>
<p>"It is smiling a welcome to us," May said. "To think that it is absolutely
our own! I hope we have done with gambling for ever."</p>
<p>"I have finished with it for good," replied Harry. "I have won a fortune and
a wife on the same day, and that is more luck than most men gain on the course.
If you are happy, darling, what more do I need?"</p>
