<h2>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h2>
<p>In searching for the wreck of the Australian steamer Elingamite, which was
lost on the "Three Kings"&mdash;afterwards found to have been incorrectly
charted&mdash;a diver employed by Lloyd's agent, who was endeavouring to
recover the specie sunk in the vessel, came upon the wreck of an unknown
steamer that had evidently struck the same rocks many years earlier and had
disappeared. The diver reported to the puzzled salvage expert that he had
located the Elingamite, and in confirmation of his claim he produced rusty
tools brought up out of the sunken steamer. After further diving operations a
second steamer was found on the ocean floor, and proved to be the Elingamite.
But the identity of the steamer which had been wrecked long years previously on
the same rocks was never established. That strangely dramatic discovery, which
was recounted by Lloyd's agent to the author suggested the main idea of this
story.</p>
<hr align="center" width="25%">
<h2>CHAPTER I. A RUDE AWAKENING</h2>
<p>"A bad business, my boy; a very bad business. I cannot tell you how sorry I
am for you."</p>
<p>The old colonel stroked his white moustache and stared abstractedly at the
matting. The clock on the mantelpiece of the colonel's working room in the
bungalow ticked on, and the young man with the blue eyes, brown curly hair, and
soldierly figure said never a word. His face was very grey, and there was a
whole world of suffering in his eyes.</p>
<p>"When you were attached to the regiment for training, just a year ago,
McLean," continued the old colonel, "I looked up your Australian record, and I
was proud of you. Your dead father was one of my oldest friends, and I rejoiced
for his sake in your successful career. Colonel Blakeway, your commanding
officer, was at Sandhurst with me many years ago, and when he wrote to me
suggesting your name as that of an Australian subaltern to be attached to the
regiment for training, I immediately assented. I felt sure that it would have
pleased your dead father if he could have known that his son was serving the
Queen under myself."</p>
<p>Something like a dry sob escaped from the soldierly young officer, but he
quickly mastered himself.</p>
<p>"I am deeply grateful to you, sir," he said; "and I can assure you that the
stain which has fallen upon my father's name is what grieves me most in the
whole of this miserable business."</p>
<p>Colonel Elmslie, of the Forty-first Pathans, in cantonments at Tilgit, rose
from his chair and paced slowly up and down the room in manifest agitation.</p>
<p>"My boy," he said, "a wise man never criticises the conduct of another man's
wife, and if you were a stranger to me I should doubtless take the safe and
easy course of declining to intervene in this matter at all, but my long
friendship with your dead father and my pride and interest in your own career
make it impossible for me to look on with unconcern when that career is being
ruined by a woman who is&mdash;forgive me if I wound you&mdash;unworthy to be
your wife."</p>
<p>The young officer straightened himself into rigidity, as though to bear a
physical blow.</p>
<p>"And I have only been married for two months," he whispered with dry
lips.</p>
<p>"My boy," said the old colonel in a tone of deep sympathy, as he stopped his
pacing up and down the room and placed his right hand on the young officer's
shoulder, "there is nothing to be gained, believe me, by shirking trouble.
Better far to face the situation like a soldier. The woman who fascinated you
when you first met her on the mailboat between Colombo and Bombay, whom you
married two months ago in a frenzy of boyish passion, and who was detected last
night in a flagrant piece of cheating at cards in Major Mortimer's bungalow, is
not unknown in India. My wife met her some years ago at Simla. Mrs. Harrington,
as she then was, possessed a sinister reputation, and when poor Tom Harrington
died she disappeared, and was not seen again until you brought her up here two
months ago as your wife, having married her while you were on temporary leave.
No one here except my wife had ever met her, or could identify her with Mrs.
Harrington. We resolved to accept her for your sake, hoping that her early
reputation was undeserved, and that she would make you happy. Nobody could be
more grieved than I am that you married in haste without letting even me, your
father's old friend, know of your intention. For I might have saved you from an
irreparable mistake and the regiment from a most unpleasant scandal."</p>
<p>The young officer turned deadly white. "What course do you wish me to adopt,
sir," he said, "in the interests of the regiment?"</p>
<p>"I do not wish to put it on that ground, McLean," said Colonel Elmslie, not
unkindly. "But I think that in your own interests it would be better for you to
leave Tilgit as soon as possible, and to take your wife away from India.
Fortunately, the period of twelve months for which you were attached to us has
almost expired. In the report which it will be my duty to furnish to the
military authorities in Australia upon your work here I shall make no reference
whatever to your domestic affairs, which do not concern me officially. And you
may rest assured that I shall express the very highest possible opinion of your
soldierly qualities, unremitting diligence in all the duties of your
profession, and splendid gifts of leadership. I wish, my boy, that our parting
could be a happier one, but you are young, and you will outlive, I trust, all
the painful consequences of a mistake into which you were led by youthful
passion and ignorance of the world."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Colonel, for your kindly advice," said the young officer in a
broken voice. He wrung the proffered hand in silence, and, half-dazed by the
shame and misery of it all, groped his way to the door.</p>
<p>When the colonel was having tiffin with his wife a few minutes later, Mrs.
Elmslie, who had already heard the whole sordid story of the scandal from her
most intimate friend, Mrs. Mortimer, could not help referring to it. Her
worldly old heart had in it a streak of motherliness which was touched by the
terrible distress of the young Australian officer.</p>
<p>"Fred," she said to the colonel, "can nothing be done to save that young
fellow from this appalling disgrace? His only crime has been that he loved that
wretched woman with callow infatuation, and married her without knowing
anything whatever about her. Surely something might be done to save him from
having his whole life ruined by the idiocy that made him blunder into marriage
with a woman ten years older than himself who is nothing more than a common
swindler."</p>
<p>"I put it to him as gently as I could, my dear," said the practical old
colonel with his mouth full of curry. "But the whole thing was so flagrant.
Mortimer actually saw her drop her handkerchief and pick up the ace of diamonds
with it&mdash;like any common card-sharper. She was caught with the ace in her
hand, and the discard&mdash;a small club&mdash;on the floor at her feet. How
can a thing like that be hushed up? The only thing for them both to do is to
disappear as soon as possible."</p>
<p>"But surely the story won't be allowed to leak out, Fred. It would be too
awful for the poor fellow if it did."</p>
<p>"I can only say that I have done everything possible to stop it, my dear.
There were only seven people in the room altogether when the thing happened.
Mortimer and Stanhope were standing out, and the five who were playing were
Mrs. Mortimer, Mrs. Burlington, Carvill, Sykes-Huntington, and Mrs. McLean.
There were four men and two women besides the culprit. I have seen them all,
and each individual gave me a sacred promise that the matter would be kept an
inviolable secret."</p>
<p>"That was a capital idea of yours, Fred," said Mrs. Elmslie.</p>
<p>"But I find that one of them has already told you," retorted the colonel
grimly.</p>
<p>"Well, surely that is no harm," said Mrs. Elmslie pleasantly. "I hope I can
be trusted to keep a secret. It's a pity that Mrs. Burlington was there,
though, because she is sure to tell Mrs. Abbott, and Harry Abbott is certain to
mention it to his particular pal Harford-Clinton at the club, and it will be
all round Tilgit before the gymkhana on Thursday."</p>
<p>Colonel Elmslie groaned. "Well, at any rate I have done my best to save poor
young McLean from the wolves," he said; and then, as he poured another peg into
the tall glass, he added: "There's a mistake in the system somewhere. It's all
very well to train up a boy in all the military virtues from childhood, and
expect him to grow into a combination of Napoleon and St. Anthony; but when the
woman comes along, what happens to the regulations? As long as there are
petticoats in the world, my dear, there will be trouble."</p>
<p>"Don't be coarse, Fred," said Mrs. Elmslie with an indulgent smile.</p>
<p>"That's not coarseness," returned the colonel; "it's common sense. Look at
the case of this unfortunate young McLean. They put him through the
mill&mdash;junior cadets, senior cadets, drill, manoeuvres, and all the rest of
it, so rigorously that he had no time to think of anything but his drill-book.
Consequently, the first woman who snapped her eyes at him bagged him. And it
was bad luck for him that she happened to be a woman who had fallen so low as
to be mixed up with card-sharpers working the mailboats between Aden and
Bombay."</p>
<p>"It's rather sad though, all the same, isn't it, Fred?" said Mrs. Elmslie,
whose little golden vein of genuine feeling was hidden in the conglomerate of
worldliness, conventionality, and self-interest that made up the greater part
of her nature. "However, the young man will no doubt go back to his home in
Australia at once, and I hear that the divorce laws over there are extremely
liberal. It's to be hoped that it will not take him long to get rid of his
incubus."</p>
<p>"Hum!" said the colonel. "Not a cheerful description of a bride of two
months, is it, my dear? Hullo! why, bless my soul, I have to be at the
polo-ground at two."</p>
<p>And away he clanked.</p>
<p>But for Hector McLean the daily routine of pleasure and duty at Tilgit was
at an end.</p>
<p>As he rode slowly away to his own bungalow on the outskirts of the station,
he revolved in his mind the maddening realities of his position. And no matter
from what point he started, he reached always the same wretched termination.
His brief married life, it was clear, had ended in a cul de sac. The most
painful scene of all had yet to be lived through. It was necessary for him to
tell his wife, who had deceived him and disgraced him, that they must leave
India.</p>
<p>And what of his career&mdash;the career for which he had worked so
steadfastly since he first joined the junior cadets in his schooldays in
distant Australia? Was his life as a soldier to be wrecked as well as his life
as a private citizen? Were the confident predictions of the instructional
officers who had prophesied a brilliant future for him to be falsified? Was he
to pass into the ignominious list of those who had failed to come up to the
standard of character demanded by the military authorities from all those who
sought to serve their country as officers? To a man of merely average character
and application the blow would have been a severe one. To such a man as Hector
McLean, whose whole faculties had been concentrated upon the attainment of
success in his military career until he met Mildred Harrington, the shock was
well-nigh paralysing.</p>
<p>He rode slowly along the dusty track, entirely oblivious of outer
surroundings, and when his charger stopped in front of the gate of his
compound, McLean dismounted mechanically, handed the bridle to the waiting
sais, and strode up to the verandah, where a tall dark-haired woman, seated in
a low chair, was feverishly turning over the leaves of a three-months-old
illustrated paper. The deathly pallor of her skin and the dark rings round her
eyes told of a troubled night.</p>
<p>"Well," said the woman, looking up defiantly; "what did the old fool want to
see you about?"</p>
<p>"There should be no need for you to ask why the colonel sent for me,"
replied her husband quietly. "He knows everything that occurred last night. He
has promised to keep the&mdash;the&mdash;disgraceful incident a secret in order
to save the regiment from scandal."</p>
<p>"What rubbish you are talking!" broke in the woman angrily. "It was a mere
accident. Dozens of people do the same thing every night of the week, and
because it is not noticed nobody cares a rap." She was talking very fast, and
Hector McLean eyed her gravely.</p>
<p>"Surely, Mildred, you are not thinking of what you are saying," said McLean
sternly. His wife seemed to be bereft temporarily of a moral sense. "Are you
incapable of seeing that cheating at cards is a particularly despicable form of
theft?"</p>
<p>Then the woman flared up. Half hysterical after the long torturing sleepless
night, she rose from the chair and faced her husband furiously. "Oh, you make
me sick, sick, sick, with your miserable goody-goody twaddle!" she cried. "Two
months ago you told me that you loved me and could not live without me. To-day
you tell me that I am a thief. You came into my life and dragged me away from
the friends who admired me and made much of me, to bring me up to this hole,
where all the old cats avoid me as if I had the plague. And because I happened
to make a little mistake over a miserable game of cards you turn from me like
the rest of them. What do they want to do with me now&mdash;to send me to
prison or only to Coventry? I insist upon knowing. I demand to be told at once.
Life isn't so amusing up in this God-forsaken place that it won't be a blessed
relief to get back to civilisation, and the sooner the better, as far as I am
concerned."</p>
<p>Hector McLean stood appalled at the unreasoning and hysterical outburst. "As
soon as you can control yourself," he said firmly, "I will tell you what has to
be done."</p>
<p>"For goodness' sake, go on," said the woman, stamping her foot. "Even a
prisoner has a right to know the sentence of the court without being kept in
suspense longer than necessary. And after all you are my husband, don't forget
that. The law will compel you to support me, even if you have forgotten your
vows of eternal love after two months&mdash;only two months!"</p>
<p>She gave a slight shudder and turned her gaze outwards across the dusty
road, and the banyans and the club compound to the towering mountain peaks that
almost enclosed the lonely station, producing the effect of a gigantic prison
for the little handful of white men and white women encamped there.</p>
<p>"Sit down in that chair, Mildred, and listen to me," said McLean in his
resolute, low-pitched voice, "for there is something which must be said by me
to you, here and now."</p>
<p>The woman sat down on the edge of the chair, leaning forward, with her face
resting on her hands and her elbows on her knees. In her eyes was a look of
tense and painful expectancy. She felt the strength of the man's will at last.
It held her in silence, as though she were spent and exhausted after the rush
of babbling words a moment earlier.</p>
<p>"Listen to me, Mildred," said the young man in his steady even voice. "It is
necessary for us both to leave Tilgit at once. We must go away from here; we
must get out of India."</p>
<p>"Rubbish!" said the woman angrily. "You can't go. You have your career to
think about."</p>
<p>"My career is over so far as India is concerned," said McLean, with a trace
of bitterness in his tone. "Possibly it is over altogether. Well, it can't be
helped now. But you are my wife, and I intend to stand by you. If we cannot
live here we can live in another country."</p>
<p>"I don't want to go to any other country," said the woman wearily. "I am
sick to death of travelling. I want to stay in one place and have what I have
never had yet&mdash;a home."</p>
<p>"I can give you a home, Mildred, in my own country&mdash;in Australia, where
I was born, where all my friends are, and where I had hoped to do some useful
work before I die. Soldiering is a man's game, after all. I suppose that is why
I chose it. You will come back with me to Australia, and together we will live
down this terrible thing. There now, you mustn't cry, Milly. It will all come
right in the end."</p>
<p>"Oh don't, Hector! Don't speak kindly to me! It's more than I can bear." The
woman's body was shaken with sobs; she threw herself into the chair and buried
her face in her hands.</p>
<p>Hector McLean was down on his knees beside her at once, comforting her. "A
man must stick to his wife, Milly, even if she does make a mistake," he said.
"We will forget all this when you come with me to Caringal. You know that my
mother died when I was a child, and my father soon followed her. I shall be all
alone with you at Caringal, and I shall always be able to get a military job of
some sort, I suppose."</p>
<p>The unhappy woman was weeping unrestrainedly now. "Oh, I know I'm a bad lot,
Hector, a rotten bad lot; but when you came into my life I meant to turn over a
new leaf. Indeed I did. But now it is all over. I cannot imagine what made me
cheat last night. The idea came into my head quite suddenly that it would be so
easy to bring off that stale old trick. Almost before I realised what I was
doing, it was done. And then came the exposure."</p>
<p>Mildred McLean had never looked less attractive. Her eyes were red, her
cheeks were haggard, and her lips were quivering. Though really only
thirty-two, she looked fully forty. But her boyish husband experienced a sharp
revulsion of feeling as his eyes dwelt on her face. Here was a woman surely who
was a strange contradiction&mdash;a woman capable of thoughtless, careless
evil-doing, but also of true greatness, of heroic self-sacrifice. The sense of
shame and outraged justice ebbed from his heart and a wave of love and pity
rushed in. True, she had done a base act. But was she wholly base? His heart
said no.</p>
<p>"Come inside now, dear, for I have many things to do," he said, stroking her
hand, but when he tried to raise her up he saw that she had fainted.</p>
<p>Muhammad Bahksh, the "khansama," was wise in the ways of mem-sahibs. He
brought burnt feathers and brandy in a wine-glass. And then he helped Hector
McLean to carry his bride of two months into the bungalow, where Shaibalini,
Mrs. McLean's ayah, was waiting. McLean laid his wife on her bed, and she
opened her eyes and smiled wanly at him. "I often feel like that now, dear,"
she said, "but I shall be all right in a minute."</p>
<p>But Muhammad Bahksh, as he listened to a few hastily muttered sentences that
Shaibalini the ayah poured into his ear, looked preternaturally wise.</p>
<p>"The eyes of the sahib are blind," he replied, "because of his want of
knowledge. But we know what we know."</p>
<p>Next morning Colonel Elmslie received information that the Zakka Khels were
hiding their wives and families in caves in the hills&mdash;the usual
preliminary to an extended raid. The tribesmen had been exhibiting more than
usual unrest, and at least a dozen rifles belonging to the Forty-first Pathans
had disappeared.</p>
<p>"It's just the job for McLean before he goes," muttered the colonel
thoughtfully; "and besides, it will take his thoughts off his own
troubles."</p>
<p>So McLean cantered away at the head of fifty native troopers, each of whom
had the light of battle in his eyes and rations for three days in his
saddle-bags.</p>
<p>It was in the days before the gun-runners of the Persian Gulf had
distributed arms to all the potential enemies of Great Britain in the
tribesmen's country. Stolen rifles at that time fetched high prices among the
hillmen.</p>
<p>When the young Australian returned to Tilgit with his troop on the fourth
day, with ten of the missing rifles and a bullet-hole through his helmet, he
found his wife gone.</p>
<p>Muhammad Bahksh explained that the mem-sahib had gone out for a ride
immediately after his departure. She had not yet returned. However, she had
left a chit on the dressing-table.</p>
<p>This was the chit:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"MY DEAREST HUSBAND,&mdash;Do not be angry with me for going away.
You made me happier than I ever thought I could be in my whole life, but it is
all over now. By one mad act I threw away all the happiness that you gave me,
and now I must leave you. If I were to remain with you your career would be
ruined. I have seen too much of the world to believe that the possession of an
impossible wife is no bar to advancement. You would be dragged down by your
unfortunate marriage. But if I am not with you the way will be open to you. I
shall watch your career from far away. I shall follow each promotion through
the newspapers, and be proud of your success. But you must never see me again.
I thank you, dear, from my heart for all that you have given me&mdash;your
love, your name, and your protection. It is for your sake that I give up
everything. I cannot accept the sacrifice that you have offered me. After all,
a man's work is a man's life. If nobody in Australia knows that you married me
your career will be a brilliant one. If you are hampered with me you will never
rise at all. And so I cannot hesitate. Do not worry about me. Do not follow me.
Try to forget me. I have the fifty pounds you gave me on my birthday, and out
of India I can get work as a governess or a companion. Remember that I shall
always watch your career with loving pride, and that I shall always think of
you with tears of gratitude for the honest boyish love that you, gave me. And
now goodbye. I'm sure you have not forgotten the song I sang on the first night
that I met you&mdash;'I love you so, dear, that I only can leave you' I little
thought that it would so soon come true.<br>
<br>
"Your unhappy<br>
"MILDRED."</blockquote>
<p>Hector McLean read the letter through and passed his hand in bewilderment
across his forehead.</p>
<p>Then he summoned Muhammad Bahksh.</p>
<p>"The mem-sahib has gone down to Bombay to wait for me," he said slowly to
the khansama. "Lay my kit out ready for packing. We are going back to Australia
together."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II. THE ADOPTION</h2>
<p>"Well, this is a delightful surprise, Grace, dear [hugs], for I thought you
were hundreds of miles away, looking out on a vast expanse of sheep [more hugs]
and utterly forgetful of civilisation. Come up to my room at once, and powder
your nose and tell me all about it&mdash;how long you are going to stay, and
what you intend to do to amuse yourself."</p>
<p>Laura Martin, the capable and by no means bad-looking proprietress of the
fashionable St. Kilda boarding-house known as 'The Cedars,' waited until the
cabman had deposited Mrs. Hesseltine's portmanteau in the hall and taken his
departure. Then she placed her hand lightly on Grace Hesseltine's waist and
convoyed her upstairs to a large, lofty room, with a balcony overlooking the
bay.</p>
<p>Sitting on the edge of the bed while Mrs Hesseltine removed her hat and her
travelling cloak and powdered her nose at the dressing-table, Laura Martin, who
had been one of the big girls at the Presbyterian Ladies' College when Grace
first attended that august seat of feminine culture, poured out innumerable
questions.</p>
<p>"How is Simon?"</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine admitted that Simon was getting old and shaky. His temper
did not improve with age, but there was no real vice about him and he never
went off his feed. "He just roams about the paddocks," she added, "and when I
go out on the verandah with a drink for him, he comes up to me at once."</p>
<p>It appeared presently that Simon was not a horse but a husband. Grace had
married him soon after she left school, when she was eighteen and he was
fifty-seven; now she was twenty-three and he was sixty-two. Latterly, she had
begun to doubt, with a persistence that increased daily, whether it was worth
while to be the mistress of Mindaroona if one had to have Simon as well.</p>
<p>"You used to get on with him all right," said Laura Martin, with a vague
feeling that her friend was not being quite frank with her. "He's not any worse
than he has always been, is he?" she asked sympathetically.</p>
<p>"Not a bit, dear," said Mrs. Hesseltine disconsolately, eyeing the
reflection of her pretty face in the mirror with as much interest as if she had
never seen it before.</p>
<p>"Well, then, you must buck up, old girl," retorted Laura Martin genially.
Most of her paying guests were men, and her conversation was apt to show
distinct traces of the fact. "Buck up, and have a good time while you can.
You'll be a long time dead, remember."</p>
<p>"It's all very well for you, Laura," replied Mrs. Hesseltine with a distinct
quiver at the corner of her mouth. "You have regular occupation here, with your
business to run, and constant bustle and variety. When your husband died and
you started this boarding-house you were as mournful, morbid, and moping a
widow as I ever saw, and just look at yourself now&mdash;buxom, jolly, always
laughing, and much better looking than you ever were before. It's having
regular work to occupy your mind with, I suppose, and lots of men always around
you, too."</p>
<p>"You shocking young woman! You'll be calling me a female Mormon next."</p>
<p>"Well, just think how different it is with me. Nobody to talk to but Simon
and the maids. Nothing to see but sheep. Nothing to think about but&mdash;oh, I
can't stand it any longer&mdash;I can't, I can't!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Grace Hesseltine, of Mindaroona, N.S.W., mopped her pretty eyes openly
with her handkerchief, and in an instant Laura Martin was beside her, and had
slipped a sustaining arm round her waist. "You mustn't talk like that, dear,"
she said. "Tell me all about it. Two heads are better than one, you know."</p>
<p>"But you wouldn't understand, dear," said Grace. "You're so different from
me, and you would only think me a fool."</p>
<p>"No, indeed," said Laura. "I think I can guess what it is, Grace," she went
on as she smoothed the soft hair of the younger woman almost maternally. "Tell
me, dear, tell me!"</p>
<p>"I want a child," said Mrs. Hesseltine, with a despairing note in her voice.
"I want a little baby to kiss and love and talk to. I cannot go on living at
Mindaroona any longer without one. I am terrified that I shall kill myself some
day, Laura, out of sheer misery and loneliness."</p>
<p>"Hush, dear, hush!" said Laura. "Now, I'm just going to make you stay here
with me for at least a month, and we'll soon brighten you up and give you such
a good time that you'll quite forget how lonely you have been at Mindaroona. By
the way, what are you going to put on for dinner?&mdash;we dine at half-past
six."</p>
<p>"Oh, anything will do," said Mrs. Hesseltine, still mopping her eyes. "My
old black crepe de chine, I suppose."</p>
<p>But Laura Martin was already down on her knees on the floor investigating
Mrs. Hesseltine's Saratoga. She had a profound belief in the consoling
properties of dress. "No, indeed," she said, "you've got to look your best
while you're with me. You must wear this lovely white lace over gold
tissue."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine faintly deprecated the white lace over gold tissue, but her
objections quickly waned, and soon she temporarily forgot all her unhappiness
in an animated discussion with Laura as to which would go best with the gown, a
gold band round her hair or the artistic, but rather severe, Greek knot.</p>
<p>Both finally voted for simplicity and the Greek knot.</p>
<p>Laura left the field victorious, and there was an enigmatic smile on her
lips as she met Nelly, the housemaid, in the passage.</p>
<p>"How is Mrs. Robertson getting on in number four, Nelly?" she inquired.</p>
<p>"She's doing very nicely, madam," replied the well-trained maid, with a
smile, "and the twins are such splendid, healthy little chaps. One of them has
been bawling a good bit this afternoon&mdash;he seems to have a terrible
temper&mdash;but the other is as good as gold. Nurse has got them both out on
the back verandah now, if you'd like to see them."</p>
<p>But Laura Martin postponed the interview. A wild idea had come into her
head, and she wanted to think it out quietly.</p>
<p>The big dining-room at 'The Cedars' was provided with numerous separate
tables for the paying guests, and when Mrs. Hesseltine sailed in, rather late,
in the wonderful white lace over gold tissue, with her hair done in a Greek
knot, she created a mild sensation. Young gentlemen turned their heads and
followed her progress with undisguised admiration as she made her way to Mrs.
Martin's private table at the far end of the room.</p>
<p>There was much nudging and whispering. A subdued chorus of "Who is she?"
went round, and several very plain but expensively dressed ladies looked down
their noses and began to talk eagerly to each other about nothing at all. An
experienced mind-reader could see by their backs that they were thinking it was
a great pity that the young men did not show better taste than to stare at that
very conspicuous-looking friend of the proprietress.</p>
<p>Laura congratulated Grace on her improved looks. "My dear," she said, "your
frock is perfectly lovely, and the Greek knot is just sweet."</p>
<p>And Grace Hesseltine purred with pleasure. It was much more agreeable,
certainly, to dine at this well-ordered establishment, where the paying guests
were decidedly presentable and the menu was beyond reproach, than to sit down
to a lonely meal with Simon Hesseltine, Esq., of Mindaroona, whose conversation
consisted of grumbling at the demands of the Shearers' Union and inveighing
against the Government as a gang of robbers.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Grace," said Laura, sipping her claret, "do you ever see anything
of the Lintons at Yarralla now? They stayed with me when they came down last
year for the Melbourne Cup, just after they were married. He seemed a good sort
and she was a very pretty little thing. They are not far from you, are
they?"</p>
<p>"Only five miles," said Grace; "I used to drive over fairly often during the
winter, to sit and sew with her, although I was horribly envious of her."</p>
<p>"Why on earth should you be envious of her?"</p>
<p>"Oh, didn't you know? The stork called at Yarralla about a month ago. Such a
dear little girl baby! That was what finally unsettled me, and made me so
restless that I simply had to get away from Mindaroona. So I came down to see
you."</p>
<p>The older woman's eyes grew wistful for a moment, but she resolutely shook
off the weakness. "That's right, dear. I'll see that you have a good time here,
and when you go back you'll be a different woman."</p>
<p>"I wonder," said Mrs. Hesseltine. "Do you know, Laura," she continued after
a short pause, "I heard a baby crying somewhere upstairs this afternoon, and it
brought back all the old pain. I didn't know you accepted people with babies as
guests. The poor little things are quite barred at most places nowadays, aren't
they?"</p>
<p>Laura Martin sat back in her chair and shot a curious glance at her visitor.
"Well," she said, "I wasn't going to tell you about it, but now I suppose I
must. My dear, I haven't merely got one baby in this well-regulated
establishment&mdash;I have two."</p>
<p>"Twins?" ejaculated Mrs. Hesseltine.</p>
<p>"Yes, twin boys," replied Mrs. Martin, "and beautiful babies too, as like
each other as two new bright shillings. The mother is a Mrs. Robertson&mdash;an
Englishwoman, I fancy&mdash;who came here a couple of months ago, and I really
hadn't the heart to tell her that I couldn't take her in when she told me her
story."</p>
<p>"I'm so glad!" said little Mrs. Hesseltine simply.</p>
<p>"To tell you the truth, I was a little bit suspicious about her at first,"
continued Mrs. Martin, "but I could see that she was a lady, and I was so much
impressed by her that at last I let her have the big double room on the second
floor. And that's where the twins were born, five weeks ago."</p>
<p>"Oh," ejaculated little Mrs. Hesseltine, "I simply must see them!"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Robertson told me," continued Laura Martin, "that her husband was an
officer in some regiment stationed on the Indian frontier&mdash;I've really
forgotten the outlandish name of the place. Poor thing! she had only been
married a couple of months when he was killed in that wretched little
expedition against the wild tribes near the Afghan border. You remember there
was a lot about it in the newspapers at the time. Of course, his death was a
fearful shock to her, and she left India at once. She told me quite frankly
that she was very badly off, and that she came to Australia because she thought
she could live more cheaply here than in England. Then the twins arrived, and
there she is. Goodness knows what she will do now. She has paid up all right so
far, but I know she is awfully hard up, poor thing, and I'm quite certain she
can't afford to stay here much longer. I was just wondering&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"What?" said Mrs. Hesseltine, leaning forward in her chair with her eyes
shining.</p>
<p>"I was just wondering where she will go when she leaves 'The Cedars,'"
replied Laura Martin, looking at her visitor irresolutely. "It will be so
awkward for her, won't it?"</p>
<p>"Do you think&mdash;&mdash;" began Mrs. Hesseltine tentatively.</p>
<p>"No, I don't&mdash;&mdash;" snapped Mrs. Martin. "I'm quite certain she
wouldn't."</p>
<p>"But I didn't say anything," retorted Grace Hesseltine, opening her eyes
wide.</p>
<p>"No. But I know what you were going to say," put in her friend Laura, "and
I'm quite certain you oughtn't to tempt her."</p>
<p>"I have more money than I know what to do with," said Mrs. Hesseltine
obstinately.</p>
<p>"And no children," said Laura, looking her friend straight in the face.</p>
<p>"Well, she has more children than she knows what to do with, and no money,"
muttered Mrs. Hesseltine rebelliously. "I don't see why it shouldn't be
managed."</p>
<p>"I won't have anything at all to do with it," said Laura Martin. "I'm not
going to encourage you in such a mad idea. What do you think Simon would
say?"</p>
<p>"I don't care two straws what Simon would say," retorted Mrs. Hesseltine,
"and he knows it. Besides, I think he ought to be delighted if I could find a
little happiness that way."</p>
<p>"Very well, dear," said Laura nervously, "we'll talk it over afterwards."
She knew from experience that paying guests have very long ears. One of the
plainest and most expensively dressed of the ladies at the table behind them
was obviously putting a terrible strain upon her aural nerves.</p>
<p>As the elegantly gowned little lady from Mindaroona sailed down the long
room towards the door accompanied by the stately proprietress, Mr. Sharp, a
rising young solicitor, nudged his friend Mr. Call, one of the best known
members of the Stock Exchange Club. "Did you watch their faces?" said the
astute legal gentleman. "I gather that the little one has just proposed to
Laura that they should blow up Parliament House. And Laura would rather like to
undertake the job, if she wasn't so scared."</p>
<p>However, the dark plot took definite shape as Grace Hesseltine and her
trusted school-friend of early days sipped their coffee in Mrs. Martin's dainty
sitting-room.</p>
<p>"Do ask the nurse to bring them in here and let us look at them," said Mrs.
Hesseltine, clasping her hands together in excited anticipation.</p>
<p>Laura Martin held out for fully five minutes, but Grace refused to be
pacified with promises, and at last, in response to a smiling request from Mrs.
Martin, the white-clad nurse undertook to ask Mrs. Robertson if she might show
the babies to Mrs. Martin's friend.</p>
<p>"Ask Mrs. Robertson to come too," said Grace Hesseltine.</p>
<p>And so it came about that the tall pale dark-eyed woman left her room on the
second floor, attended by the white-aproned nurse with a twin on each arm, and
entered Mrs. Martin's cosy little sitting-room, to find the proprietress
chatting with a pretty little fluffy-haired woman who was beautifully dressed
and evidently knew it.</p>
<p>Laura introduced the pair in an easy, graceful sentence or two.</p>
<p>"Really, Mrs. Robertson, I'm a perfect fool about babies," prattled the
little lady from Mindaroona, "and I am just dying to see yours. What a pair of
darlings!" She cooed over the twins, who were still in the nurse's arms. The
hair of one was a little darker and more curly than that of the other. But with
the exception of that small distinction the babies were facsimiles.</p>
<p>"The dark one is Humphry," said Mrs. Robertson, with a rather wan smile,
"and the fair one is Harold. But Harold is sure to get darker as he grows
older, and there are gleams of gold in Humphry's hair that make me wonder
whether he is not going to be as fair as his brother eventually. Do take one of
them in your arms, if you would like to, Mrs. Hesseltine."</p>
<p>"Oh, might I really?" chirped Grace delightedly. "I'll be ever so careful."
She scrutinised the infants closely. Humphry regarded her with a solemn stare
that plainly portended distrust, if not disapproval. Harold gurgled and
actually smiled.</p>
<p>After a moment's hesitation Mrs. Hesseltine selected Harold, and the nurse,
by one of those movements which to the unskilful resemble legerdemain deftly
transferred the infant in its absurdly long petticoats to the eager arms of the
baby-worshipper.</p>
<p>Mrs. Robertson dropped much of her chilly reserve and became almost
communicative in the pleasant companionship of Grace and Laura. The twins were
a common bond of interest, and taking Humphry from the nurse, Mrs. Robertson
sat down with him opposite Simon Hesseltine's pretty wife, who crooned
contentedly over her borrowed infant.</p>
<p>When the nurse announced that it was bottle time and proceeded to remove
Humphry from his mother's arms, the infant signified its disapprobation by
bellowing loudly. But Harold accepted every change of guardianship quite
calmly.</p>
<p>"It's quite wonderful how different those two babies are in temperament
already," said Mrs. Robertson. "I sometimes fancy that Humphry is more like me
and that Harold is more like his dead father."</p>
<p>When the tall dark-haired woman had said good-night and had followed the
twins to their improvised nursery, Mrs. Hesseltine laid her hand upon her
friend's arm with an air of quiet determination. "I simply must have him,
Laura," she said, "and you have got to arrange it. You can tell Mrs. Robertson
all about Mindaroona. Simon settled it on me at my marriage and I shall leave
everything to the boy. If she lets me adopt him he will have a much better
chance in life than if she keeps him herself, and the cheque that I shall hand
her as a guarantee of my good faith will enable her to maintain herself and the
other boy in reasonable comfort until she either marries again or can establish
herself in some business that will be a living for her."</p>
<p>With many misgivings Laura Martin opened up the delicate negotiations on the
following morning. And it happened that she found the mother of the twins in a
very desponding mood. Mrs. Robertson was down to her last ten pounds and had
not the faintest notion where the next money was to come from.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hesseltine is prepared to give you a cheque for L500," said Laura
Martin, "as security for the due fulfilment of her promise to bring up the
child in every respect as if he were her own son, the sole condition being that
you give this written undertaking to make no further claim to the boy. She will
cause him to be educated in a manner suitable to his position, and every
provision will be made for his welfare, financially and otherwise."</p>
<p>The tall dark-haired woman bowed her head upon her hands. When she raised it
again her face was the colour of marble. "Give me the paper," she said, "and I
will sign it."</p>
<p>Thus it came about that Mrs. Hesseltine, accompanied by another
white-aproned nurse carrying a particularly even-tempered baby, went on board
the R.M.S. Merkara at Port Melbourne, bound for Sydney, while Mrs. Robertson,
with the remaining twin in her lap at 'The Cedars,' abandoned herself to
unrestrained weeping.</p>
<p>But presently the tall dark-haired lady dried her eyes, for she had taken
her resolution.</p>
<p>Going to her cabin trunk in the corner of the room, she opened it and took
out a small silver box of Indian workmanship, so beautifully made that when it
was closed it was difficult to see where the lid and the sides met. The casket
appeared to be absolutely air-tight and water-tight.</p>
<p>Unlocking the box with a small silver key, she took out a ring with a little
green stone surrounded by brilliants, a heavy gold bangle with an inscription
on the inside, and three papers. One was a marriage certificate, the others
were separate certificates of the birth of twin sons, Humphry and Harold, whose
parents were set down in the documents as Hector McLean and Mildred McLean,
formerly of Tilgit, in the North-west Provinces of British India.</p>
<p>The dark-haired lady replaced the precious documents in the silver box and
also the ring and bracelet. Then she laid upon the top of the certificates a
cheque for L500, signed 'Grace Hesseltine' and payable to bearer. Having done
this, she locked the silver casket and put it back in her cabin trunk.</p>
<p>"She shall have her cheque back," said the dark-haired lady through her
teeth, "and I will have my child again, agreement or no agreement."</p>
<p>Telling Laura Martin that she was compelled to go away for a few days on
business and leaving the infant Humphry with his nurse in the care of the
proprietress, the lady who was known as Mrs. Robertson, with her last ten
pounds in her purse and her cabin trunk packed with a few necessaries for
travelling, called a cab and left 'The Cedars.'</p>
<p>The days went by and the weeks passed. But the woman who was known as Mrs.
Robertson returned no more, and all Mrs. Martin's advertisements and inquiries
were fruitless.</p>
<p>The mother of the twin babies had vanished as completely as though the solid
earth had opened under her feet and then closed over her again.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III. TWENTY YEARS AFTER</h2>
<p>Nobody either at headquarters or anywhere else could say definitely why
Major McLean resigned from the military forces of the Commonwealth and buried
himself on his own little station-property near Blackfish Bay.</p>
<p>On his return from India he had accepted the adjutancy of a mounted infantry
regiment. Then on the outbreak of the South African War he had volunteered for
active service. He fought bravely throughout the war, and returned with a
slight wound and the D.S.O. Soon after his return he sent in his papers and
retired to his station, Caringal, a few miles from Blackfish Bay, on the New
South Wales coast.</p>
<p>One boundary fence of Caringal ran down to Yarralla, where Mrs. Linton, a
widow, lived with her charming daughter Leonie, and another of the major's
boundaries just touched Mindaroona, where Mrs. Hesseltine and her son Harold
were very companionable neighbours.</p>
<p>It was a delightful spring morning, and the major's forty-third birthday, as
he walked across the Mindaroona paddocks to make an early call on Mrs.
Hesseltine.</p>
<p>Grace Hesseltine, plumper than of yore but still decidedly attractive, and
like all very fair women carrying her years lightly, sat on the verandah of the
substantial homestead sewing.</p>
<p>"How early you are this morning, Major," she said with a bright smile as she
advanced with outstretched hand. "I suppose you are looking for Harold
again."</p>
<p>"Of course I am," replied the major with a frank grin. Since old Simon
Hesseltine had departed ten years before for a region where the Shearers' Union
could trouble him no more, the major had been a very constant visitor at
Mindaroona.</p>
<p>"The boy has gone out for a ride with Leonie Linton," said the attractive
widow, resuming her sewing and motioning to her visitor to take the vacant
chair beside her. "But they'll be back for lunch. What's the programme for
to-day?"</p>
<p>"Well, to tell you the truth," said the major apologetically, "I was going
to suggest a little holiday trip. I want to take a run down to the ironworks at
Shaleville to see how they are getting on with the new plant there. It occurred
to me that you might all like to come with me."</p>
<p>"Oh, how jolly!" said Mrs. Hesseltine delightedly. "We'll take the big car
and have afternoon tea out of doors. It will be a regular picnic. You'll stay
to lunch here, of course?"</p>
<p>"Thanks awfully," said the major, lighting a cigarette and puffing at it
contentedly. The companionship of the gracious woman beside him was very
pleasant, and he took a genuine interest in her handsome son, who intended to
devote himself to a military career. The major often said to himself that if he
had ever had a son he would have wished that son to be just like Harold
Hesseltine.</p>
<p>"Here they come," exclaimed Mrs. Hesseltine suddenly, pointing out across
the big home paddock, "and racing again, of course."</p>
<p>The major looked and saw two little clouds of dust travelling fast side by
side. Presently two figures on horseback emerged and the drumming of hoofs came
faintly to the ears of the watchers. Side by side the riders swept along at top
speed, and as they pulled up their mounts, laughing and excited, just outside
the white paling fence, the major loudly called, "Dead heat!"</p>
<p>Dismounting quickly, Harold helped Leonie to alight, and together the
good-looking pair came towards the verandah, as Mike, the rouseabout, led away
the steaming horses.</p>
<p>"Miss Linton beat me home by a neck, sir," said Harold, saluting the major,
"but there was really nothing between us."</p>
<p>"Wasn't there though?" said Mrs. Hesseltine, with a significant glance at
the major. "Well, I'm surprised to hear it."</p>
<p>The flush that flew to Leonie's cheeks was wonderfully becoming. In the
excitement of the gallop her fair hair had escaped from under her hat and was
flowing over her shoulders. Her eyes were fairly aglow with light. "I believe
he pulled the black horse and let me win, Mrs. Hesseltine," she exclaimed;
"wasn't it mean of him?"</p>
<p>"Ah, my dear," said the widow, letting her eyes rest affectionately on the
tall young fellow beside her, "in Harold's eyes a woman must always be first."
And then she whispered to the major, "If the occasion ever arose he would give
up everything for a woman. I am sure of that. And I believe you would do the
same yourself, major."</p>
<p>But the major did not answer. He was thinking of a certain day twenty years
before in India, when he made up his mind to give up everything&mdash;his
position, his career, his life's work&mdash;for a woman, and when she had saved
him from the necessity by freeing him voluntarily from the encumbrance of
herself. He had never seen her since. Every effort to trace her had failed. He
did not even know whether she still lived or not, and the uncertainty had
clouded his whole life.</p>
<p>The voice of the frank young fellow, whose face so curiously called up vague
fleeting recollections of those dim past days, broke in upon the major's
reverie. "What are we going to do to-day, sir?" he asked; "I feel fit for
anything."</p>
<p>The major explained his idea of a visit to the ironworks at Shaleville. He
would be delighted if Mrs. Hesseltine, Miss Linton, and Harold would accompany
him.</p>
<p>The suggestion was received with warm applause, and after lunch the four
started off in the big motor-car for Shaleville, the prosperous little town
that had sprung up around the great ironworks that had been built over a
coal-mine by a long-sighted capitalist of a past generation.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine and Leonie Linton picked up their skirts and trod daintily
as they walked down the main street, and turning in at last through a gate in
the high paling fence, entered the area covered by the ironworks. The major
walked in front to pilot them and Harold brought up the rear.</p>
<p>The day had turned bitterly cold and there was a feeling of snow in the air,
for Shaleville, with its encircling rampart of hills, was nearly 4,000 feet
above sea-level.</p>
<p>As the four visitors entered the gate a young workman passed them carrying a
bar of iron on his shoulder. He wore a rough brown jersey, moleskin trousers,
and heavy boots. His face was so thickly grimed with coaldust that his features
were quite indistinguishable. He took in the whole party with one swift glance,
and then hurried on in front of them and vanished into the works.</p>
<p>"That's a smart young fellow," said the major to Mr. Blunt, the grizzled old
foreman who had been deputed to show the party round. "Born and bred to the
work, I suppose."</p>
<p>The old foreman was very deaf, but after the major had shouted the remark in
his ear three or four times he began to understand.</p>
<p>"No," said Mr. Blunt; "we get a lot of the lads locally, but as a matter of
fact that young chap's a stranger. Comes from t'other side of the Murray, I
fancy. He came here looking for a job only last week, an' I put him on at the
fishplates&mdash;punching holes in 'em, y' know. We'll get down there presently
and see 'im at work. These 'ere are the puddling furnaces."</p>
<p>As the visitors stepped into the first huge open shed further conversation
became impossible, owing to the roar of the furnaces and the banging of the big
steam-hammers.</p>
<p>Leonie clutched Harold's sleeve nervously as the guide halted in front of
one of the furnaces where a grimy and perspiring toiler stood puddling the
molten metal with a long iron bar.</p>
<p>"Ye needn't be afraid, missy," remarked the guide encouragingly. "It's for
all the world like making butter. 'E jest goes ahead churnin' with that there
iron bar, and presently the iron forms itself inter a big lump, wot we calls a
puddled ball, an' that's the butter. You'll see it come out in a minute."</p>
<p>As he spoke the operator threw the door of the furnace fully open and hooked
out a huge glowing cannon ball from the blinding sea of liquid iron. It dropped
upon a small trolley and was quickly wheeled by an impish urchin to where a
grimy giant clad in armour and with his face protected by a visor stood in
front of the steam-hammer. The giant transferred the lump to his anvil and
banged and squeezed it with his mighty hammer, while large flakes of fire fell
all round him and the molten fiery juice of its impurities dripped from the
puddled ball.</p>
<p>"Isn't it terrifying," said Leonie, gripping Harold by the arm and getting a
reassuring squeeze of the hand from her protector. "I shouldn't like to think
that any one I was fond of had to work in this weird place."</p>
<p>"It's man's work though, isn't it, Leonie?" said Harold, through the roar of
the furnaces and the dull thud, thud of the falling hammer. "I can't help
admiring a fellow who takes on work like this. It's a bit different from
selling ribbons behind a counter, anyhow."</p>
<p>But the foreman was moving on, and they had to follow him, picking their way
carefully among the glowing fragments that lay about the ground in every
direction.</p>
<p>They saw the puddled ball much reduced in size by the loss of the impurities
that had been banged out of it. It was placed in the rolling mill&mdash;a
series of gigantic mangles differently shaped and grooved, which worked in the
centre of a long iron roadway furnished with rapidly revolving rollers.</p>
<p>"Ye see," roared the grizzled guide through the deafening din of the mills,
"we puts her in like this,"&mdash;he pointed to the red-hot flattened mass of
the long-suffering puddled ball, which was just entering upon a further stage
of treatment&mdash;"and she comes out like that."</p>
<p>The red-hot mass was placed on the iron roadway, where it was speedily
caught by the revolving rollers and hurried forward to the ordeal of the
monstrous mangle. And as the visitors gazed they saw it transformed under their
eyes into a long thin red-hot snake, which shot out from under the mangle and
sped along the iron roadway on the other side, to be cut and cooled in due
course into convenient lengths of wrought bar-iron.</p>
<p>"Oh, what an appalling squeeze!" laughed Mrs. Hesseltine, throwing an arch
look at the major. "It positively makes one feel a pang of pity for one's
poker, to think that it must have gone through the same ordeal."</p>
<p>"At least, if it wasn't the same ordeal it was another as like it as two
p's," retorted the major quizzically, "since that's the happy little letter you
are so fond of."</p>
<p>And then he possessed himself of the lady's arm under the pretext of
preventing her from slipping into the fatal embraces of the rolling mill. Mrs.
Hesseltine did not withdraw her arm. The major was certainly a very satisfying
person to be with.</p>
<p>And she caught herself wondering why he did not possess himself of her arm
more often, and why, since he obviously admired her, he so seldom allowed
himself to overpass the rigid bounds of ordinary acquaintanceship. This was a
thought that had often troubled the charming chatelaine of Mindaroona. And it
persisted in obtruding itself even in the midst of this noisy din of whirring,
clanking, screeching machinery. Why did the major stop short just when her
instinct told her that he felt most drawn towards her? He was the most
perplexing middle-aged bachelor she had ever met. Most of them wanted to make
love to her on sight. And then the widow began to be conscious of a vague
apprehension&mdash;she could hardly analyse it&mdash;concerning the major's
early life, which he hardly ever talked about.</p>
<p>All this flashed through her brain as she walked along beside the major,
paying no attention whatever to the old foreman in front of them, even when he
expatiated on the many merits of the new steel-furnace and pointed out the big
ingots of steel that were being reheated and then passed through the
rolling-mills, to emerge in the form of red-hot girders, channeling, fishplates
and various other kinds of useful hardware that were being sawn into convenient
lengths by a methodical buzz-saw, which screeched without intermission over its
task.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine found metal more attractive in her own thoughts&mdash;which
were mainly about the major&mdash;than in the "stupid old iron-works," which
were merely useful as a back-ground.</p>
<p>Suddenly, just as they paused in front of the punching-machine, which was
boring holes in red-hot fishplates under the supervision of the extremely
grimy-faced young workman who had passed them near the entrance, Mrs.
Hesseltine found herself confronted by a paralysing though unspoken question.
It was this: Was there any reason&mdash;anything in the major's past
life&mdash;which prevented him from proposing to her? That he was a bachelor
she had always supposed. But after all, what solid justification had she for
such a supposition?</p>
<p>As the question flashed through Mrs. Hesseltine's brain, she looked up, and
found herself staring straight into the eyes of the young workman, who,
according to the foreman, had only recently come to Shaleville from "t'other
side of the Murray."</p>
<p>The young workman's gaze was positively disquieting. There seemed to be
almost a hint of menace in it. And his face was quite preposterously grimy. It
almost looked as though he had blackened it with coaldust on purpose. None of
the other workmen were nearly so dirty.</p>
<p>"Oh!" said Mrs. Hesseltine, nervously clutching the major's arm. "That young
fellow gave me quite a start."</p>
<p>"There's nothing wrong about him that I can see," whispered the major
reassuringly. "A very decent young fellow, I'm sure. Just watch him at his work
for a minute."</p>
<p>The party of visitors paused in front of the punching-machine and watched
the young workman, who had a boy to assist him. Armed with a big pair of
pincers, the man seized a red-hot fishplate, swung it into place, and then
pulled a lever which brought down a row of punches that went through the iron
as though it was cheese, and dropped the punched out cores on the ground
beneath. The boy, who also wielded a pair of pincers, grasped the finished
article and stacked it with the others. And so the work proceeded with
monotonous iteration, varied only by the occasional jamming of a fishplate in
the punching-machine and the consequent necessity of pulling it out again with
the pincers and reinserting it straight.</p>
<p>"Really I must get out into the open air," said the widow abruptly. "The
heat and the noise in here have made me feel quite faint." She passed her hand
across her forehead with a gesture of weariness that did not escape the notice
of the alert major, and he hurried her forward at once.</p>
<p>Leonie ran up to see what was the matter, and taking Mrs. Hesseltine's
disengaged arm, helped the major to support her until they emerged from the
machinery-shed and stood once more in the open air.</p>
<p>But if the mistress of Mindaroona had looked back she would have seen a very
peculiar little incident. She would have seen the preternaturally grimy-faced
young workman at the punching-machine desist from his work for a moment to run
after Harold, tap him on the back, and thrust a piece of paper into his hand.
Then she would have seen the young workman place his finger on his lip with an
imperative appeal for silence, and go back to the punching-machine, where an
open-mouthed urchin stood gaping at him with a red-hot fishplate in his
pincers.</p>
<p>Harold opened the note and read it with a puzzled brow. When he had finished
it he crushed it up in his hand, thrust it into his pocket, and ran after the
major, Mrs. Hesseltine, and Leonie.</p>
<p>He found them discussing some point of evident importance with Mr. Blunt,
the foreman.</p>
<p>"Askin' your pardon, sir," Mr. Blunt was saying to the major, "but your good
lady hasn't seen the galvanising bath yet. It's one of the most interesting
things we do 'ere an' I'm sure she orter see it before she goes."</p>
<p>"I wish the man wouldn't persist in calling me your good lady, Major," said
the widow testily, "and I wouldn't go to see his old galvanising bath for a
hundred pounds. I wish he'd go and drown himself in it. I want to get out of
this and go home. Can't you explain that I'm feeling ill?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hesseltine is not very well to-day," shouted the major desperately,
"and she would like to postpone the rest of the inspection until some other
day."</p>
<p>Mr. Blunt nodded as though he understood, but it was all a bluff. "Ye see,
mum," he continued, demonstrating with lifted forefinger in front of the
exasperated widow, "we puts the ingots of spelter&mdash;that's lead, tin, and
such-like&mdash;with a little sal ammoniac inter the galvanising bath. Then we
puts in a steel sheet, plain or corrugated, an' out she comes with a beautiful
mottled sheen, like wot you 'ave seen, no doubt, on your own station. They
calls it galvanised iron, mum&mdash;but that's a mistake, if you'll excuse me
for saying so. There ain't a square yard of galvanised iron in the country.
It's all galvanised steel now, an' very useful too fer making churches,
coalsheds, buggy-houses, or any little thing like that about the place."</p>
<p>"For goodness' sake, make him stop, Major." The handsome widow was almost
crying by this time.</p>
<p>"If you wouldn't mind showing us the way to the gate, Mr. Blunt," said the
major, "we would be extremely obliged to you. We really must be going now."</p>
<p>Mr. Blunt wagged his head comprehendingly and led the way through more
machinery. "Would you mind askin' your good lady not to step in that 'ole?" he
murmured confidentially, after they had walked about a quarter of a mile; "it's
full of 'ot slag. That's the black skin on the top. Very deceptive, that 'ot
slag. It come out of the pot that they filled when they tapped the
steel-furnace. They drawed off the steel, ye see, into them moulds, and this
'ere slag was left be'ind."</p>
<p>The molten stone bubbled up yellow and fiery through the cracks in the black
skin that covered it, and Mrs. Hesseltine trod carefully among the red-hot
pitfalls that beset her path. She was desperately tired, her head was aching,
and the recollection of the face of the grimy young workman at the
punching-machine troubled her seriously.</p>
<p>When Mr. Blunt solemnly produced a pair of blue spectacles and bade her put
them on in order that she might gaze unharmed into the dazzling interior of the
steel-furnace, Mrs. Hesseltine flatly refused. Indeed, she went on strike.
"I-I-I thought you were ta-ta-taking me to the ga-ga-gate," she sobbed to the
major; "and I'm simply dying for a cuh-hup-hup of tea."</p>
<p>So the party retreated in good order towards the main gate, and the major
covered the retreat and fought a rearguard action with Mr. Blunt, who displayed
prodigious valour in dodging about among pools of burning slag, in his desire
to cut off the retirement and compel the visitors to do their duty without
shirking.</p>
<p>"My dear, it's very interesting," said Mrs. Hesseltine to Leonie as she
dabbed her pretty little nose with something concealed in her lace-edged
handkerchief, "but nothing would induce me to go into the place again. Why,
it's positively terrifying."</p>
<p>"Yes, but it's beautiful too," said Leonie thoughtfully, with a backward
glance towards the dark stalwart figures suddenly bathed in glowing light as a
furnace-door was opened, and the cascade of fire that played round the man in
armour as he stood before his hammer. "It's the beauty of power and effort and
peril&mdash;something that we women can see from afar but never take part
in."</p>
<p>"My dear Leonie, you're getting quite poetical," said Mrs. Hesseltine. "It's
most reassuring. I was beginning to think that you had very little sentiment in
your nature. Come along, Harold; we'll be very late getting home as it is."</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I'm afraid I'll not be able to go back with you, mother," said
Harold hesitatingly. "I have to see a man here, a little later, on particular
business."</p>
<p>"Oh, nonsense, my dear boy! What business can you possibly have in the
township? Don't be so absurd."</p>
<p>"Really, mother, I must ask you to excuse me just this once. I'll borrow the
superintendent's car and get one of the men to drive me home later on in the
evening."</p>
<p>"What rubbish, Harold!" said Mrs. Hesseltine testily. "There can be no
possible reason why you cannot come home with us now."</p>
<p>Harold fidgeted and reddened, but he remained obstinate. "I'm very sorry,
mother," he said finally, "but I really cannot go back with you now."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine looked sharply at the young fellow and then at the
major.</p>
<p>Leonie looked at Harold too. Clearly she was puzzled, but she could no more
interpret the boy's refusal to go back to Mindaroona than she could interpret
the frowns of Mrs. Hesseltine or the obvious dissatisfaction of the major. All
the frank enjoyment of the outing was over, and a vague feeling of mutual
distrust descended like a chilly mist upon the party.</p>
<p>Afternoon tea was achieved amid brief banalities, and it was a relief to all
when the big motor-car drew up at the side of the main street and took in Mrs.
Hesseltine, Leonie, and the major.</p>
<p>"I shall expect you home to-night, Harold," said Mrs. Hesseltine frostily,
just before the car drove away; "and please remember that I shall be sitting up
for you. You'll be able to borrow the manager's car for the run out.
Goodbye."</p>
<p>Leonie gave Harold a chilly nod, and the car sprang forward, leaving Harold
standing at the side of the street waving his embarrassed adieux.</p>
<p>The major was gloomy and depressed during the journey home. He found his
thoughts recurring first to Harold and then to the woman whom he had married
twenty years before, and who had vanished so utterly from his ken. When would
that horrible uncertainty be cleared up? His liberty of action was completely
fettered by his anxiety.</p>
<p>He fell to wondering whether an important step that he had recently taken
would clear up the mystery.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV. TRACKING THE TRACKER</h2>
<p>As Harold turned with mingled feelings of irritation and perplexity to make
his way to the Miners' Rest Hotel, he cannoned against an unobtrusively dressed
individual who was as deeply wrapped in thought as himself. The stranger's
shabby suit suggested the city rather than the Bush, and a hard felt hat that
had once been black, but was now green and also greasy at the brim, branded him
conclusively as urban and not rural.</p>
<p>"Why the blazes don't you look where you're goin'?" snarled the stranger,
who had been pushed off the footpath into the roadway by the impact. Then he
glanced up and caught sight of Harold's face. His mouth and eyes opened
involuntarily and he stood still, staring at the young fellow with speechless
amazement.</p>
<p>"What the devil are you glaring at?" exclaimed Harold, and then he passed on
down the street, idly wondering why people who were obviously dotty were
allowed to wander about Shaleville at will.</p>
<p>But the stranger kept his eyes fixed on the retreating figure, and presently
began to follow Harold.</p>
<p>The shabby individual, still following the young man in front of him, drew
from an inner pocket a greasy black notebook stuffed with papers that were
confined in place by an elastic band. Among the papers were several cards with
the printed inscription, "T. Finegan," and in the right hand lower corner,
"Representing Mr. Con Bounce, Private Inquiry Agent, Melbourne."</p>
<p>Searching through the pocket in the cover of the notebook, Mr. Finegan drew
out a printed slip with a rude photographic reproduction heading the
letterpress.</p>
<p>"It's 'im, sure enough," remarked Mr. Finegan, "an' actin' the toff in style
too. Wot a bit er luck! There's fifty of the best hangin' to this as soon as I
give the office." He spread out the printed slip and read it once more.</p>
<p>"Humphry Robertson, commonly known as Humphry Martin. Height 5 ft. 11 in.
Age 20. Weight about 11 st. 10 Ib. Brown eyes, brown curly hair, clear
complexion, straight nose, full lips, slight moustache; was last seen wearing
blue serge suit and straw hat. Ledger-keeper in Metropolitan Deposit and
Mortgage Bank. Wanted for embezzlement. Fifty pounds reward for information
leading to arrest and conviction."</p>
<p>"My luck's in all right," continued Finegan. "Good job I happened to see
this before I came along on the major's wildgoose chase. I'm on for a double
event now, an' if I don't find the missing lady I reckon I'll bag the bank
clerk. Won't the D's up at Russell Street chew when Tim Finegan puts in fer the
two ponies?" He cackled hideously.</p>
<p>Finegan replaced the paper in his notebook and stowed the book in his inner
pocket. "I'll have a drop of schnapps on the strength of it," he murmured.
"Fifty thick 'uns, and as easy as kiss yer 'and."</p>
<p>As he turned the next corner, still keeping Harold in view, he almost ran
into Sergeant Box.</p>
<p>"Hi, sergeant," he said, "d'ye 'appen to know who that young feller is just
ahead of us?"</p>
<p>The sergeant looked down from his superior height on the questioner. "He's a
better man than you're ever likely to be," he answered. "That's young Mr.
Harold Hesseltine, of Mindaroona."</p>
<p>"Rats!" retorted Finegan angrily. "He's a crook, that's wot 'e is. I knew
'im direckly I laid an eye on 'im."</p>
<p>"You'd better go home an' have a sleep," remarked the constable pityingly.
"P'raps you'll be better to-morrow."</p>
<p>But Mr. Finegan was already in full chase. He was determined not to lose
sight of his quarry, and with a sensation of relief he saw Harold turn into the
'Miners' Rest' and sit down in the dingy parlour.</p>
<p>After imbibing his schnapps at the bar, he too sat down in the corner, and
lit his pipe to assist his reflections on the extraordinary development that
had just occurred.</p>
<p>He told himself with a sense of solid satisfaction that the major was a
"good mug." He had been paying the private inquiry agent liberal expenses for
the last three months and three pounds a week salary to find out what happened
to a woman who vanished twenty years before. The major had traced her himself
from India to Melbourne, where she had landed from a P. and O. mailboat, but at
that point every indication of her movements disappeared. After turning the
matter over in his mind incessantly for twenty years, the major had called upon
Mr. Con Bounce and explained his requirements. Mr. Bounce was interested and
sympathetic, for the major was evidently a man of means, and he readily agreed
to an arrangement that 'our Mr. Finegan' should devote his entire attention to
the investigation, and that the major should pay a salary of five pounds a week
and reasonable expenses to the investigator, who should furnish progress
reports of his discoveries. Mr. Bounce's share of the work was to take two
pounds a week from Finegan and half the money paid for expenses. As he justly
remarked, what was the good of having a business if you made nothing out of it?
Then he was able to devote all his own attention to the branch of private
inquiry that he had perfected, namely, shepherding broken-down remittance men,
and lending them small sums of money for necessary drinks on the security of
their reversionary interests in comfortable little properties in the English
counties.</p>
<p>Finegan ruminated on the injustice of Fate, which had made him a jackal for
Con Bounce instead of the proprietor of that astute individual's valuable
business. And then he remarked to himself, "Don't suppose the major'll stand it
much longer. And anyhow the fifty thick 'uns will come in handy."</p>
<p>He peeped furtively across the parlour to where Harold sat idly glancing at
the Shaleville Intelligencer and looking every two minutes at the clock.</p>
<p>"Good job the major sent for me after all," reflected Mr. Finegan. "It's
given me the chance of seeing his nibs over there. I recognised 'im the minute
I set eyes on him. He aint altered a bit either since I last saw him when he
was living at that swell boarding-house in St. Kilda. My luck's in to-day all
right."</p>
<p>And then in a burst of generosity he addressed the young fellow whom he
proposed shortly to sell to the police for fifty pounds. "Will you join me in a
drink, mate? I'm just goin' to 'ave one."</p>
<p>Harold surveyed his interlocutor slowly from foot to head and then from head
to foot again. "No, thanks," he said, and resumed his study of the Shaleville
Intelligencer.</p>
<p>"My oath, you're mighty proud, young feller," said Finegan, stung to sudden
irritation. "Fer two pins I'd&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>
<p>But the sentence was never finished, for a stalwart young ironworker, black
as a coal and obviously dangerous, opened the door just behind Mr. Finegan and
with his powerful shoulder administered a bump to the babbler that sent him
staggering halfway across the floor. "Get out of this," remarked the new-comer
curtly. "I want to talk to this gentleman."</p>
<p>Mr. Finegan slunk outside muttering to himself, and the young ironworker
slammed the door and locked it.</p>
<p>He remained silent for a few seconds, and then suddenly opening the door,
found Finegan on his knees outside listening at the keyhole. As Finegan
scrambled to his feet and began to run, a vigorous kick, planted exactly in the
right place, sent him flying down the passage and into the street, holding the
part affected with both his hands and yelling incoherent menaces.</p>
<p>But the newcomer paid no attention whatever to the parting guest whom he had
sped so unceremoniously. "I know that rat," he remarked to Harold, whose face
he examined intently. "I have seen him in Melbourne and I fancy that it would
be very unhealthy for me if he were to recognise me. Tim Finegan would sell his
own mother for a plug of tobacco."</p>
<p>"Never mind that loafer," said Harold, whose heart was beating strangely.
"What did you mean by the note you gave me this afternoon? My mother was quite
upset when I wouldn't go home with her. Good God, man, don't look at me like
that!"</p>
<p>Humphry stared at Harold in amazement. "Haven't you been told either?" he
questioned blankly. And then he muttered under his breath, "The same way that
they treated me&mdash;the same way exactly."</p>
<p>"Told what?" asked Harold, with a cold foreboding that the anchors of his
life were being dragged from their safe holding-ground and that he was
drifting, drifting, he knew not whence or whither.</p>
<p>Humphry stepped forward facing Harold, and placing one hand on each of
Harold's shoulders, stared the young man straight in the eyes. Humphrey's face
was thickly grimed with coaldust still, but his features were strangely,
marvellously familiar to Harold.</p>
<p>The young man who had never had the faintest reason to doubt that he was
Simon Hesseltine's son found himself scrutinising&mdash;his own face.</p>
<p>He turned sick and cold with the shock of the discovery. "What&mdash;what
does it all mean?" he asked, groping blindly for a chair, and sinking back into
it just in time to escape falling on the floor.</p>
<p>"It means that the lady who was with you this afternoon is not your mother,"
said Humphry huskily, "and that her husband, who died when you were five years
old and whom you probably remember quite well, was not your father."</p>
<p>Harold turned faint. His little world was falling about his ears.</p>
<p>"It also means," continued Humphry, "that the woman who brought me up from
childhood was not my mother, and that her dead husband was not my father. She
admitted it to me last week just before I left Melbourne for ever. She said
that she was going to tell me on my twenty-first birthday, but that my disgrace
compelled her to make the disclosure earlier."</p>
<p>"What disgrace?" asked Harold.</p>
<p>"I've gone a mucker, that's all," replied Humphry curtly. "I'll tell you
about it some day, because&mdash;because you are my brother."</p>
<p>Harold started to his feet and held out his hand at the sudden call of
kinship. "I knew it," he cried. "I felt it in my bones." He clasped the
extended hand of the young coal-begrimed worker and wrung it warmly. "And
whatever you have done," he added with fervour, "I am quite sure that it was
nothing disgraceful. But would you mind telling me who I am, if I am not Harold
Hesseltine, and who you are yourself?"</p>
<p>"I must answer the second question first," said the young fellow, sitting
down opposite Harold and resting an elbow on the table. "Mrs. Martin, who
brought me up from childhood and who has always been more than kind to me, told
me last week, when the police were knocking at the door to arrest me for
embezzlement, that my mother had left me in her charge twenty years ago and had
then disappeared. She called herself Mrs. Robertson, but Mrs. Martin believed
it was not her real name. She left the house one afternoon, with nothing but a
small handbag, saying that she would be back in a week, and from that day to
this she has never been seen again. Mrs. Martin, who was a childless widow,
took care of me and brought me up."</p>
<p>"But who am I?" said Harold with a quivering lip. "Was I deserted too?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Martin had a great friend named Mrs. Hesseltine," continued Humphry in
a hard dry voice, "and Mrs. Hesseltine had no children of her own. The
childless woman asked our mother to hand over one of her twin baby boys,
promising to adopt him. Mrs. Hesseltine offered our mother money&mdash;a large
sum of money. Our mother was very poor. She was faced with starvation. She took
the childless woman's cheque and she handed to her in exchange&mdash;you. Next
day she vanished from the face of the earth, and every effort to find her has
been fruitless. But the childless woman's cheque has never been presented at
the bank. Mrs. Martin says that our mother is dead, but how she died, or where,
or who she was, are questions that I am not able to answer. But I shall be able
to answer them some day. All that I know is that my name is Humphry Robertson
for the present, and that your name is Harold Robertson. When I find how and
where our mother died I shall find what was her real name and why&mdash;and why
she&mdash;left me. I know in my heart that she meant to go back to me and I
want to find the proof." He leaned his arms upon the table and covered his face
in silence.</p>
<p>After a few seconds had elapsed Harold spoke again. "I wonder what our
mother's face was like," he whispered.</p>
<p>Humphry put his hand inside his pocket and drew out an old photograph in a
new folding pocket-case of brown leather. He opened the case and spread it flat
on the table.</p>
<p>"That is our mother," he said. "Mrs. Martin gave me the photograph, which
was left behind on the mantelpiece when our mother went away."</p>
<p>The two young men pored over the face in the photograph&mdash;a beautiful
face, but over-spread by an abiding sadness. It was the face of a woman who had
loved and suffered. But it was essentially a strong face, the face of a woman
capable of great deeds, whether of good or evil&mdash;perhaps of both. In their
features the two young men who sat in the dingy bar parlour marvellously
resembled the face of the photograph. But the characteristic expression of
force either for good or evil in the pictured face was reproduced by only one
of them. It was Humphry who was indeed his mother's son.</p>
<p>"You haven't told me yet why you left Melbourne and came to Shaleville,"
said Harold.</p>
<p>"I must go back a bit first," said Humphry, "or you wouldn't understand.
Mrs. Martin was very kind to me. I believe she really loved me. She sent me to
a good school and I got on very well. I was in the football team and in the
cricket eleven. I did well at my books. Then my mother, as I always thought she
was, persuaded me to take a billet in a bank. She knew the manager and I was to
get eighty pounds a year. She spoke of it as if it was a wonderful chance. And
I was fool enough to take the post. I was there only three months when a
warrant was issued for my arrest on a charge of embezzlement. I didn't take the
money. Another young fellow took it and lost it at the races. He had not long
been married. He got into difficulties and tried to recover himself on the
Caulfield Cup. He failed, and he told me that it would break his wife's heart
if he was arrested for the theft. I had no wife. I disappeared from the bank,
and when the money was missed they jumped to the conclusion that it was I who
had taken it. I guessed they would. I escaped when the police were close at my
heels, and just before I cleared out Mrs. Martin told me the true story of my
birth. I rode my bicycle to Albury, left the machine in the cloak-room, came on
to Sydney by rail, and walked from Sydney to Shaleville. I got here a fortnight
ago."</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" said Harold in a whisper.</p>
<p>"But, strangely enough," continued Humphry, "a new complication has arisen
since I saw you this afternoon at the works. You are so exactly like what I was
before I amassed all this dirt that Finegan has identified you as the missing
bank clerk, and intends to sell you to the traps. I could see it in his eye
when I came into this room, and it's just what I should expect of him. But
there is one reason why I cannot allow Finegan to take me."</p>
<p>"And that is?"</p>
<p>"Because I have to clear up the mystery of our mother's disappearance. I
intend to find her, Harold, alive or dead."</p>
<p>There was a sombre glow in the eyes of the young man as he stared at his
new-found brother, and muttered under his breath again, "Alive or dead."</p>
<p>"By Heaven, I'm with you!" said Harold, who was white and shaken. And then
he leaned his head on his hands and said in one great sob, "My mother!"</p>
<p>"I have a feeling in my bones," said Humphry, "that I am on the right track
at last and that she is not so very far away now. I shall find her in the end,
if Finegan does not sell me to the police and have me sent back to Victoria.
After to-night I shall leave the works and take to the Bush again, and perhaps
you can help me there."</p>
<p>Harold stood up and clasped his brother's hand. "You can trust me," he said.
"And as for Finegan, I fancy he'll find some difficulty in identifying me with
the missing bank clerk, but the trouble is that in the course of his rotten
inquiries he'll probably bump up against you."</p>
<p>"I wish to goodness he'd break his neck!" said Humphry savagely. "If he is
over here foxing after me he may interfere with the great work to which I have
devoted myself. But it will be the worse for him if he crosses my path in
earnest." A fierce light glowed in the man's eyes, and he brought his clenched
fist down on the table with a bang that portended trouble for Finegan if he
ever fell into his hands.</p>
<p>Harold gave a slight shudder. There were moments when this new-found brother
radiated an impression of terrific force held in very doubtful control. He had
a feeling that Humphry would stop at nothing in carrying out the fixed purpose
of his heart.</p>
<p>"Now, Harold, we understand each other, don't we?" said Humphry. "I'm here
to find the traces of our vanished mother. I'm convinced in my own mind that
Mindaroona was connected in some way with the secret of her disappearance. You
had been taken there, remember. Mrs. Hesseltine gave a cheque for L500 to our
mother as a guarantee of her good faith, and that cheque has never been
presented. I have lain awake night after night trying to think out the
maddening puzzle, and the only supposition that I can frame to meet all the
facts is that our mother was on her way to Mindaroona to recapture you from
Mrs. Hesseltine when she met with her fate. Either that or
else&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Or else what?" ejaculated Harold, whose heart was thumping like a
trip-hammer.</p>
<p>"Or else this Mrs. Hesseltine knows something about the mystery," said
Humphry slowly. "Suppose that our mother arrived at Mindaroona. Suppose that
she demanded the return of her baby. Suppose that the demand was refused, and
that she was confronted with her written agreement to give the child up
altogether. Suppose that a scene ensued between the mother robbed of her son
and the childless wife who had obtained that son by playing upon the despair of
a woman faced with starvation. I cannot carry my supposition further. All that
I know is that our mother vanished from sight from the day that she left 'The
Cedars.' And I ask myself in perplexity, 'What does Mrs. Hesseltine know about
it?' Is she in any way responsible for that disappearance?"</p>
<p>"Good God! Humphry, what do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I cannot say more. I hardly know what I mean. But I have come to Shaleville
to find out, because it is in easy reach of Mindaroona and because I want to
watch this woman who&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Who has adopted me as her son," said Harold bitterly, "and who has given me
her love. Oh! Humphry, can't you see how horrible your suspicions are? Until
this dreadful mystery is cleared up I can never be happy again."</p>
<p>Humphry was silent for a few moments.</p>
<p>"I cannot help it," he said at last; "but no matter where the search leads
me, nor what actions it forces upon me, nor what discoveries I may make in
prosecuting it, I intend to go through with it&mdash;yes, even if it is to cost
me my life&mdash;and God help the man who stands in my way. Now I must go.
Goodbye, Harold. Go back to Mindaroona, but say nothing of me. I will see you
again, and perhaps soon."</p>
<p>"Where are you going to now?"</p>
<p>"I am due at the blast furnace to go on shift at 8 o'clock. We are to tap
her at nine, and I cannot be absent. I have a feeling that great things are
impending to-night."</p>
<p>Harold shook his brother's hand silently, and left the 'Miners' Rest' to
drive back across the ranges to Mindaroona near the sea. Snow was falling on
the mountains. He felt chilled to the heart.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V. ON THE TOP OF THE BLAST FURNACE</h2>
<p>Tim Finegan had not wasted time after his abrupt departure from the 'Miners'
Rest.' Peering through the keyhole before his disconcerting detection by
Humphry, he had discovered the extraordinary resemblance between the young
workman and the young squatter from Mindaroona. "It's a rum go," muttered
Finegan. "They're the dead spit of each other."</p>
<p>And then he saw the solution of the puzzle in a flash. "The ironworker's my
man," he ejaculated with conviction, "not the young toff from the station.
There's more in this than wot appears at present, but anyhow the ironworker's
the bloke wot's wanted for the embezzlement. If I don't get him to-night he'll
do the disappearing trick for certain, for I'm sure he recognised me."</p>
<p>Mr. Finegan then proceeded to make inquiries. He soon ascertained that
Humphry Robertson, who had changed his name to Scott for reasons best known to
himself, was due at the blast furnace at 8 o'clock that evening, having been
placed on the shift as an emergency man in consequence of an accident to one of
the regular hands. Finegan decided to lie in wait at the blast furnace himself
and grab his man there. The reward of 'fifty thick uns' was not to be lightly
thrown away, and Finegan's experience told him that the average criminal
usually 'turned it up' when tackled by his natural enemy. He did not look
forward to the job certainly, but he had thought out a plan for taking his
quarry unawares, and he intended to hand him over to Sergeant Box for safe
keeping. It was a bit irregular, of course, but Mr. Finegan was not in the
habit of shirking irregularities in the course of business, and the scruples
would have to be heavy indeed to weigh down fifty thick uns.</p>
<p>A mile away from the township rose the great blast furnace, which was kept
going day and night through weekdays Sundays, and holidays, month after month
and year after year, smelting the crude ore into pig-iron, to be worked up by
other processes into the articles that civilisation inexorably demands. Mr.
Finegan turned up his coat-collar round his ears and accompanied Bill Blunt,
the foreman, whose favour he had judiciously cultivated through the medium of
beer.</p>
<p>"Goin' ter 'ave a fall er snow, I judge," remarked Mr. Blunt, gazing
abstractedly at the feathery flakes that were falling all round them. "It
gen'ally do snow a bit in July in Shaleville. Ever bin 'ere before?"</p>
<p>Finegan's teeth were chattering. He had never seen snow before. He wished
himself back in the cosy corner of his favourite Swanston Street pub in
Melbourne. The snow struck him as monstrous, unheard-of, un-Australian. He was
quite unaware that it was a familiar sight to every dweller in the mountains.
He admitted that he had never been in Shaleville before.</p>
<p>Bill Blunt grunted and piloted the way through sundry mounds of slag, and
past an enormous dam full of water, to the blast furnace.</p>
<p>As they approached it the blackness of the sky was illumined at intervals by
a sheet of fire that spirted up a hundred feet or more from the top of the
furnace and then disappeared entirely, as though a volcano were suddenly put
out by an enormous extinguisher.</p>
<p>Presently a broad glare was thrown upon the dark curtain of the night close
to the level of the ground. Finegan began to wish that he hadn't come. There
was something uncanny about it all. "What's that?" he shouted into Ben Blunt's
most serviceable ear.</p>
<p>"They're drorin' off the slag," explained the veteran, pointing to a
brilliant golden rivulet that came into view as they turned the last corner.
The rivulet ran through a channel in a vast sloping bed of sand. The channel
made a sharp right-handed turn and emptied the glowing stream into a huge tank
mounted on a railway truck. A locomotive was coupled to the truck and the
driver and fireman were nonchalantly preparing for their journey to the slag
heap a mile away. This lake of liquid fire was to be hauled to the
dumping-ground. Then the truck would be tipped up and the contents shot out
upon the flanks of the ever-rising mountain of slag.</p>
<p>"What would happen if the engine left the rails or ran into anything on the
way?" yelled Finegan into Blunt's best ear.</p>
<p>"The tankful of molten stuff would be emptied on top of the loco," said Mr.
Blunt, stamping his feet to keep himself warm, "and that would be the end of
the driver and fireman. Parson 'ud have to read the funeral service over the
slag heap, I reckon. You can't come in 'ere, mister, without takin' a bit er
resk, ye know."</p>
<p>Finegan began more than ever to wish that he had not come. These men who
strode about in rough jerseys and trousers, paddling with great shovels and
bars of iron in the seething molten mass to break up the heavy crust that
gathered even while it ran, pursued their tasks with stolid unimaginative
sang-froid. But the sight of this river of molten stone, flowing out apparently
interminably, and the continuous roar of the blast as it entered the furnace,
shook the nerve of the private inquiry agent.</p>
<p>He shrank from the task of grappling with the muscular young ironworker in
such alarming surroundings. Nothing but the thought of the 'fifty thick uns'
sustained him and gave him heart to accompany Bill Blunt to the platform on the
top of the blast furnace where he was to see the young fellow who called
himself Scott and formally hand him over to Sergeant Box, who had arranged to
be in attendance.</p>
<p>Finegan was convinced that to postpone the arrest would be to lose the
prisoner altogether. He felt certain that Robertson, alias Scott, had
recognised him, had suspected his intention, and would take to the Bush next
day, in which case the fifty pounds reward would fall into other and less
deserving hands. But the man had been notified to be on the 8 o'clock shift at
the blast furnace that night and had said, according to Bill Blunt, that he
would be there.</p>
<p>"I 'spose he's a partickler friend of yours, this young chap Scott,"
volunteered Mr. Blunt as he led the way past the engine-house and into an
enormous lift-shaft at the rear of the furnace. "Ye seem mighty set on seein'
'im ter-night."</p>
<p>"'Im and me both comes from Melbourne," said Finegan glibly. "We're well
acquainted over there, an' bein' in the neighbourhood, I specially want ter see
'im."</p>
<p>"'Ullo, sergeant," ejaculated Mr. Blunt with unfeigned surprise, "wot might
you be doin' here?"</p>
<p>"Just come to admire the view, Bill," returned the sergeant, and then he
added in an undertone to Finegan, "Remember, 'tis you that's taking the
responsibility. Of course, if you identify this young chap as the man that's
wanted for the embezzlement and you give him in charge, I'll take him right
enough. But it'll be at your risk."</p>
<p>Bill Blunt and Finegan, accompanied by Sergeant Box, entered the great open
elevator by which the ore, fluxes, and fuel were carried up to the top of the
furnace. Snow was falling heavily by this time, and the hand-trucks full of
ore, coke, and limestone were whitened with it as the workmen wheeled them in
upon the iron floor of the elevator along with the three passengers. A signal
bell rang somewhere, and Finegan held his breath as the elevator moved up with
its heavy burden through pitchy darkness to the accompaniment of weird sounds
of creaking and clanking.</p>
<p>The roar of the hot-air blast as it rushed into the 'tuyeres' of the furnace
beat upon his ears, and he could not even see the outline of his
companions.</p>
<p>At last they reached the top and stepped out upon a broad iron platform more
than one hundred feet above the ground. Far below them, dimly seen by the light
of a few scattered electric lamps, men were putting the final touches to the
rows upon rows of moulds in the broad sloping sand-bed destined to receive the
molten metal. These were the 'pigs' and the broader transverse channels from
which they were fed were the 'sows.' The workers below were armed with shovels
and iron bars.</p>
<p>Finegan looked anxiously over. "Our man isn't there," he said to Sergeant
Box. "I have information that he is to be on duty up here at 9 o'clock. You'd
better stand back in the shadow until I call you, and then, as soon as I find
that it's 'im all right and no risk of a mistake, you just grab 'im and slip
the irons on 'im. He's a tough-lookin' customer and we don't want no fightin'
up here."</p>
<p>Sergeant Box stepped back into the shadow fingering his handcuffs and
Finegan walked forward nervously with Bill Blunt towards the front part of the
platform, where a thin sheet of iron formed a screen dividing the main platform
from the shallow saucer-shaped top of the furnace, in the centre of which was a
big black cone operated by a lever, which was worked by a man behind the iron
screen.</p>
<p>The saucer-shaped top of the furnace was replenished from time to time by
men who emptied into it big wheelbarrowfuls of ore, limestone, and coke that
had been brought up by the elevator. This was a continuous process, and at
intervals the man behind the screen worked his lever, which lowered the cone
and allowed the collected material to slide down into the furnace in such a way
that by striking against the cone it was evenly distributed all round.</p>
<p>Every time that the cone was lowered, making an orifice in the top of the
furnace, a great sheet of ruddy flame shot up to a terrific height,
illuminating the surrounding scene, throwing up the detail of every chimney and
building and silhouetting the faces of the workmen with extraordinary
distinctness.</p>
<p>Bill Blunt went forward and relieved the man who was in charge of the lever
operating the cone. The night had set in bitterly cold and the snow was already
lying an inch thick on the iron platform.</p>
<p>"Wish to blazes he'd 'urry up!" muttered Finegan, looking down to the ground
to see if he could distinguish the figure of the man who called himself Scott,
but who was really Humphry Robertson according to Mr. Finegan's firm
conviction. "This 'orrible place gives me the fair 'ump."</p>
<p>He walked forward and watched the men methodically depositing their
barrow-loads of material in the saucer-shaped top of the furnace, made of sheet
steel lined with fire-brick. The great circular saucer with the cone in place
in the middle was nearly full. Finegan looked at his watch. It was five minutes
to nine.</p>
<p>"You're sure that the young chap Scott will be up here at nine?" he shouted
anxiously to Bill Blunt.</p>
<p>"Dunno about that," replied Mr. Blunt, scratching his head. "Shouldn't
wonder if Morton wants him down below while they're tapping, but he'll be up
here d'reckly arter, anyhow."</p>
<p>Finegan's jaw dropped. He wanted to get the business over and he had an
intense desire to get away from this terrifying furnace that vomited forth
rivers of molten rock and metal at the bidding of these cool, unperturbed,
blackavised toilers who controlled it.</p>
<p>"There's your man!" ejaculated Bill Blunt, pointing to a worker far below
who was poling along the coagulations of the molten slag in the stream that ran
through its channel in the sand to the tank on the truck attached to the
locomotive in the siding.</p>
<p>Finegan looked down, and by the brilliant glare from the molten slag he saw
the face of the young fellow whom he had met that afternoon at the Miners'
Rest. Humphry had had a wash since then, and his features were now perfectly
distinguishable.</p>
<p>The private inquiry agent took his note-book from his pocket and extracted
the newspaper cutting and the printed portrait of the wanted man. He compared
the portrait with the face that he saw below him&mdash;every line and contour
revealed by the dazzling light from the molten stream. There could no longer be
the faintest doubt in his mind that Scott was indeed Humphry Robertson. He
replaced the note-book in his pocket and fastened his eyes on the worker far
below, who was unconscious of the scrutiny.</p>
<p>"Any danger to the men while they're drorin' off the metal?" he inquired
carelessly of Bill Blunt. He would not let himself think of the painful
possibility that the wanted man might be killed by an accident before he,
Finegan, could draw the reward for putting him away.</p>
<p>"Well, not exackly wot you might call danger," remarked Bill Blunt
oracularly, "but of course there's always a bit of a resk."</p>
<p>Finegan was not in the mood for drawing such fine distinctions. He demanded
explicitness. "Wot could 'appen to 'em, anyway?" he inquired nervously.</p>
<p>"Well," shouted Mr. Blunt, for the roar of the blast that whirled through
the tuyeres made conversation a trifle difficult, "in the first place the
'sows' 'ave a way of bilin' over occasionally an' squirtin' 'arf a
'undredweight or so of molten metal over anybody wots 'andy; or then, again,
there might be a blow-out when they're drorin off the stuff from the furnace.
But old 'ard, they're goin' to tap 'er now."</p>
<p>Finegan went back chafing with nervous anxiety. He fervently hoped that the
sows would not boil over upon Scott, alias Robertson, and that there would be
no blow-out to do him damage until the fifty pounds was handed over for
delivering the prisoner safe and sound into the custody of the law.</p>
<p>Down below half a dozen men, including Humphry Robertson, made ready to tap
the bath in which the molten metal collected at the bottom of the furnace.
There would be thirty or forty tons of the stuff to come out.</p>
<p>They took a long iron bar with a sharp point to it and attacked the plug of
fireclay in the side of the furnace with it, using the bar as a battering ram.
Thud, thud, thump, went the bar, and the fireclay, baked as hard as porcelain,
gave forth a hollow ringing sound.</p>
<p>All at once the point of the bar went through and a jet of bright golden
liquid leaped out in a perfect arch and fell into the channel cut in the sand
to receive it. The men started back into safety and the stream rushed along
down the main channel, filling all the subsidiary channels, the 'sows' and
'pigs,' that spread out in the pattern of a huge gridiron upon the big
sand-bed.</p>
<p>Finegan walked up and down in a frenzy of agitation on the high platform on
top of the furnace. He heartily wished that this dangerous business was over.
He had no eye for the picturesqueness of the scene, and yet its weird beauty
might well have riveted the attention of any one less absorbed in his own plots
than the private inquiry agent.</p>
<p>As he stepped back to the rear of the platform Bill Blunt pulled over the
lever that operated the cone which closed the opening in the top of the
furnace. A great column of flame shot up into the night, blown to this side and
that by the force of the rising wind. The flame was parti-coloured, owing to
the gases liberated from the melting ore, and it soared aloft in mighty
standards that changed from green to rose-pink and then to gold and purple
against the dark back-ground of the sky.</p>
<p>All around the floating banners of fire fell the snowflakes, white and
silent, encircling the many-coloured sheets of flame.</p>
<p>Rising flames and falling snow. It was the sight that the French soldiers
saw at Moscow&mdash;the sight that portended their destruction.</p>
<p>It lasted for a minute or two, and then Bill Blunt raised the cone again and
closed the furnace, for the saucer-shaped cover was empty. The ore, coke, and
limestone had all slid slowly down to the central opening and been evenly
distributed by impact with the sides of the cone into the heart of the seething
sea of fire beneath.</p>
<p>Finegan trembled and it was not with the cold. He moved back a few yards
further away from the receptacle for the ore and fuel. His mottled complexion
had become a dirty green. "Wish I was outer this 'ell of a place and 'ome in
Footscray," he muttered.</p>
<p>He had no eyes for the strangely impressive scene&mdash;the distant fire of
the puddling furnace on one side and the red glare from the replenished
slag-mountain on the other, the tall black chimneys spouting flame, and down on
the great sloping sand-bed immediately below him the delicate tracery of the
golden molten iron patterned in the sand moulds, like a great piece of
jewellery made by the cunning hand of a giant artificer.</p>
<p>Red glare of fire, inky blackness of the tall chimneys, and over all and
through all, lit up by the many-coloured flames, the white unsullied beauty of
the falling snow!</p>
<p>"Blast this 'ole of a place," muttered Mr. Finegan hoarsely; "wish I 'adn't
'ave come."</p>
<p>He heard a creaking, clanking noise through the roar of the hot air in the
tuyeres, and the elevator stopped almost beside him. Out of it came a loaded
barrowful of ore, which was wheeled forward by a sturdy young fellow, so intent
on his work that he noticed neither the stranger who stood near with the collar
of his heavy overcoat turned up round his ears nor the constable in helmet and
water-proofs who stood back in the shadow.</p>
<p>Finegan made a rapid gesture to Sergeant Box, motioning to him not to show
himself, and then he followed Humphry Robertson forward to the receptacle for
the ore and fuel immediately above the furnace.</p>
<p>The young fellow tilted his barrowful of ore into the saucer-shaped
receptacle. The reservoir was full.</p>
<p>Bill Blunt looked out from behind his screen, saw that the mingled mass of
ore, fuel, and flux was up to the level of the platform, and reached for the
lever operating the cone.</p>
<p>It was precisely at that moment that Finegan, who had screwed his courage to
the sticking-point, stepped forward and laid his hand on the young workman's
shoulder. "Humphry Robertson," he said, "you're wanted for embezzlement.
Sergeant Box is here and you had better come quietly."</p>
<p>The young man turned round quickly. He was half dazed for a moment. He took
a step forward, which had the effect of placing Finegan between him and the
ore-holder.</p>
<p>Next instant he caught sight of Finegan's face and recognised him.</p>
<p>"You cur!" he said. And with the words he shot out a lightning-like blow
that caught the hapless private inquiry agent flush on the mouth.</p>
<p>Finegan reeled, tottered, lost his balance, stepped backward, and fell over
into the saucer-shaped ore-holder above the furnace.</p>
<p>The whole incident had passed in a few seconds, and it was unseen by Bill
Blunt on the other side of his iron screen. Furthermore, Mr. Blunt, being
woefully deaf, did not hear the piercing scream of Finegan as the central cone
began to descend, and the flame from the furnace leaped up with the roar of a
liberated demon&mdash;not thirty feet distant from him.</p>
<p>The ore, coke, and limestone began to slide slowly down towards the central
opening which appeared when the cone was lowered.</p>
<p>Finegan began to slide down also. He scrabbled furiously to regain the edge
of the reservoir. In the furnace below the cone was a raging white-hot sea of
molten rock and metal.</p>
<p>The lumps of coke and stone slipped away under his frantic feet and clawing
hands; he was being carried quickly to the opening.</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt himself clutched by the collar.</p>
<p>Humphry Robertson had leaped into the ore-holder after him, and was striving
to drag him up to safety. But still the stuff slipped away under them down the
inclined surface towards the opening into the furnace, from which a sheet of
parti-coloured fire was leaping a hundred feet into the air.</p>
<p>The screams of the despairing Finegan were unheard above the roar of the
flame, and Bill Blunt, with his hand still on the lever, knew nothing of the
awful predicament of the two men in the ore-holder. He might have raised the
cone and saved them if he had known.</p>
<p>Humphry Robertson fought hard for two lives down in that terrible
death-trap. He was young and powerful, and as lithe as a cat. Unhampered by
Finegan he could have scrambled out himself, yet his hand gripped tight on the
man's collar, and for a few seconds he held his position against the sliding
mass of material. He realised that a few seconds more must end the struggle
unless help came.</p>
<p>Suddenly he felt something hard thrust under his left arm. He looked up and
saw Sergeant Box on the edge of the platform holding out a long, stout iron
bar. Humphry supported his weight upon it, still clutching Finegan by the
collar. The heat from the escaping pillar of fire was intolerable. The glare
was blinding. The inert deadweight of the burden that Humphry grasped showed
him that Finegan was unconscious.</p>
<p>A bell clanged furiously somewhere.</p>
<p>The blast was shut off and the leaping pillar of flame descended into the
furnace again.</p>
<p>Then at last Mr. Blunt discovered that something was wrong and raised the
cone. The mass of ore and fuel ceased to slip away under the feet of the two
men.</p>
<p>Humphry Robertson, still supported by the welcome iron bar, gradually
levered himself up towards the edge of the platform, dragging Finegan after him
by the collar. In another couple of seconds Sergeant Box grasped Humphry's arm
and hauled him out of the ore-holder, still clasping Finegan tightly by the
coat-collar.</p>
<p>"By God, you're a man!" said Sergeant Box, and he slapped the young workman
on the shoulder with his leg-of-mutton fist.</p>
<p>Together they lifted the unconscious form of Finegan and carried him into a
little cubby-house on the roof where the men were accustomed to make their tea
and eat their suppers. They laid him on a narrow bench and Sergeant Box dashed
cold water in his face. Finegan came to his senses and stared wildly round him.
Then he burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Reckon he's had the shock of his life," said Sergeant Box. "It's a good job
I was watching you, my lad, or you and he would be pig iron by now. I was only
just in time with that iron bar."</p>
<p>Humphry looked straight into the sergeant's face. "Well, are you going to
take me now?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Not me," said the sergeant. "I know nothing about you, except that you are
a brave man."</p>
<p>He took hold of Finegan by the arm and shook him. The smoky oil lamp threw
dancing shadows on the wall of the cubby-house.</p>
<p>"See here, Finegan," said the sergeant, "do you wish to identify this young
fellow as a man who's wanted by the police in Victoria?"</p>
<p>Finegan shook his head feebly, "I reckon&mdash;I must
'ave&mdash;made&mdash;a mistake," he muttered under his breath.</p>
<p>So Sergeant Box went home empty-handed after all, and it was a terribly
shaken private inquiry agent who crawled back to his bed in Shaleville, leaving
Humphry Robertson at work among the fires and the falling snow, rejoicing that
he was still free to carry on the great quest.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI. THE MAJOR ON THE TRAIL</h2>
<p>Mrs. Linton was one of those charming middle-aged ladies who always like to
have plenty of young people round them, and accordingly, when Leonie rested her
fresh young face against her mother's cheek with a whispered petition that she
might invite her great friend Marion Bingham up to Yarralla for a visit, Mrs.
Linton promptly said that it was a delightful idea.</p>
<p>"Go and write to her at once, dear," said Mrs. Linton. "It is extraordinary
how I miss that girl whenever she leaves us. There is something so genuine and
trustworthy about her, and I'm sure she will do you good. You have not been
looking quite yourself, dear, lately, and I am just beginning to feel a little
worried about you."</p>
<p>And indeed Leonie was not nearly as bright as she used to be. She had never
been quite the same since that trip to Shaleville, and Mrs. Linton, who was an
observant mother, made up her mind that the young lovers had had some
misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter was that Harold was quite changed after the visit to
the iron-works. Instead of the gay lighthearted boy that she used to know,
Leonie found herself trying to talk to a moody introspective youth, who
appeared to have on his mind some gloomy secret which he resolutely refused to
share with her.</p>
<p>Moreover, he avoided even his mother as far as possible and Mrs. Hesseltine
seemed to be almost frightened by his manner towards her. He wore the air of a
mute questioner of Fate&mdash;and her. She bitterly regretted that she had
never told him the true story of his parentage. But it seemed too late now. An
atmosphere of suspicion and uneasiness settled down over Mindaroona, a cloud of
coolness and perplexity gathered between Mindaroona and the Lintons' place,
Yarralla, while even the major, alone with his old housekeeper at Caringal,
felt himself separated from his neighbours by a mist of vague
misunderstanding.</p>
<p>The major's perplexity increased when he traced the whole trouble back to
that visit to Shaleville and the meeting with that mysterious young workman
whose presence had so strangely disquieted Mrs. Hesseltine.</p>
<p>The following week brought several new visitors to the district.</p>
<p>Marion Bingham came up from Sydney to stay with Leonie and Mrs. Linton at
Yarralla, bringing with her a pleasant whiff of metropolitan life and also a
quiet sense of restfulness and power. Intellect and feeling were perfectly
balanced in Marion, and brain and sympathy with her worked hand in hand.</p>
<p>"I don't know how it is, my dear," said Mrs. Linton, clasping Marion's hand
on the evening of her arrival, "but you always make me feel that life's little
worries cannot exist in your presence. They become simply impertinent
intruders."</p>
<p>On the same evening, by coach from Shaleville, arrived Mr. Tim Finegan,
bound for Caringal in response to an imperative summons from Major McLean. The
major expressed a strong desire to know the result of Mr. Finegan's prolonged
and highly-paid inquiries upon the subject of the disappearance of 'Mrs.
Harrington' whom he had traced to Melbourne from India, but who had vanished
utterly just twenty years earlier. Was she alive or dead? The uncertainty was
making the major old and irritable before his time. He had loved his wife very
truly, but the tragedy of their brief married life lay far in the past, and
nothing remained to remind him of it except his thoughts.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine had attracted him strongly, and he was painfully conscious
of the perplexing and ambiguous attitude that he had been obliged to adopt
towards her. If only Finegan could clear up the mystery of his wife's
disappearance the perplexity would vanish at once and the situation might soon
be regularised.</p>
<p>The major smiled contentedly and blew rings with his cigar smoke as he lay
on his verandah in a long deck-chair, thinking of how he would regularise the
situation. Meantime, what the deuce was keeping Finegan?</p>
<p>As the major reclined in his chair, still thinking of Mrs. Hesseltine's blue
eyes and charming figure, the buggy that he had sent to meet the coach drew up
at the fence and Finegan got out, obviously nervous and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>His verbal report to the major on the verandah was long-winded and
discursive. The major listened with increasing signs of impatience.</p>
<p>"But hang it all, Finegan," said the major at last, "you have found out
nothing. You haven't even discovered where Mrs. Harrington lived while she was
in Melbourne. I don't want to hear all that stuff about the cabman and the
baggage agent and the hall-porter at the Grand Hotel. Accepting your version,
it simply amounts to this&mdash;that a lady who may or may not have been Mrs.
Harrington, but who called herself Mrs. Robertson and whose baggage was
labelled with that name, joined the Merovia at Colombo and travelled by that
boat to Melbourne, where she disembarked, drove in a cab to the Grand Hotel,
had two trunks and a dressing-case delivered to her there by the regular
baggage agents, and left with her trunks two days later in a cab. Now, where
did she drive to? When you have found that out we shall be one stage nearer to
the goal of discovering what became of her eventually."</p>
<p>"Nice game to try and find out where a lady drove to from the Grand Hotel
twenty years ago, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"Find the cabman."</p>
<p>"Can't do it, major. Most of the old ones have left the job on account of
them taxicabs. Besides, what cabman could remember where he drove a particular
fare twenty years ago?"</p>
<p>Mr. Finegan was suspicious of the major. He disliked this vigorous method of
pushing inquiries. It might conceivably produce definite results. And definite
results meant that a lucrative job might be brought to an end. Amateurs, in Mr.
Finegan's opinion, had no right to interfere when they engaged a professional
investigator. Their business was to receive reports and pay up and look
pleasant. But this major displayed a most unpleasant disregard for proper
conventions.</p>
<p>"Now, look here, Finegan," said the major abruptly, "I'm not at all
satisfied with the progress of your investigations and I intend to take a hand
myself. I'm going to advertise in all the Melbourne daily papers for the
information that I want."</p>
<p>Mr. Finegan's jaw dropped.</p>
<p>"This is what I intend to say," continued the major, who had hastily
pencilled a few lines on the back of an envelope. "To boarding-house keepers
and others. Fifty pounds reward. Any person who provided a Mrs. Robertson from
India with board and lodging in Melbourne or suburbs in the year 188- will
oblige by communicating with Messrs. Sharp and Stringer, Solicitors, Collins
Street. All communications strictly confidential."</p>
<p>Mr. Finegan groaned. He could have kept the inquiry going for six months at
least if he had been let alone. And now here was this bull-headed client taking
the whole thing out of his hands with a horrible practicality that threatened
to produce definite results forthwith.</p>
<p>"I'll have that inserted in the newpapers at once, Finegan," continued the
major, "and we'll see what will happen. Go round now and Mrs. Burke will give
you something to eat. You may as well stay here for a few days until I see what
turns up in answer to the advertisement. I'll make you bookkeeper at the store
to stop people from talking."</p>
<p>The major inserted his advertisement in the Melbourne dailies and also in
the weeklies, and several people received sharp shocks when their eyes fell on
it.</p>
<p>Laura Martin in Melbourne turned white when she saw the advertisement. Fifty
pounds would be acceptable enough, of course, but how did she know what use the
solicitors intended to make of the information when they got it? She had a
wholesome dread of the law courts, having once been a witness in a case between
a dressmaker and a lady customer who refused to accept an ill-fitting garment.
The badgering that Mrs. Martin got from the dressmaker's counsel on that
occasion made an abiding impression upon her. There was nothing that she would
not cheerfully endure rather than be cross-examined again by any legal
practitioner.</p>
<p>Moreover, Mrs. Martin was very uneasy in her own mind over her share in the
double adoption of Mrs. Robertson's twin babies. It was possible that the
adoption of the first baby by Mrs. Hesseltine had some connection with Mrs.
Robertson's mysterious disappearance, and as for the second baby, Humphry, whom
she had brought up herself, it was very undesirable that the circumstances
under which he vanished from Melbourne should be investigated by any
solicitors.</p>
<p>On the whole, Mrs. Martin decided to hold her tongue and do without the
fifty pounds reward.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine, too, experienced a severe twinge of conscience when her eye
fell on the advertisement, as she was turning over the pages of her weekly
paper. Why on earth should a firm of Melbourne solicitors be hunting up Mrs.
Robertson, the lady who had so mysteriously vanished after handing over one of
her twin babies for adoption by the mistress of Mindaroona? It must be the same
lady. It was most unlikely that there could be two Mrs. Robertsons from India
staying in a Melbourne boarding-house twenty years ago. Probably some relative
of Mrs. Robertson had instructed the solicitors to get the information, and in
that case they would of course discover that Mrs. Robertson had given birth to
twin sons before she disappeared.</p>
<p>What position would Mrs. Hesseltine occupy in that case with regard to
Harold? Could the relatives take Harold away from her in spite of the agreement
signed by the mother? And how could she herself face Harold if he learnt from
strangers that he was not her son? Moreover, what would the major say about it?
She had thought that she was practising a piece of innocent and harmless
duplicity in bringing up Harold as her own son, for Simon Hesseltine had grimly
accepted the situation right up to his death, and Mrs. Martin, who was the only
other person who knew the true facts, had the best reasons for keeping
silence.</p>
<p>Grace Hesseltine fell to wondering who was the unknown relative of Mrs.
Robertson, and what was his object&mdash;she felt sure it was a man&mdash;in
attempting to disinter the past. Already she began to hate and fear the unknown
investigator.</p>
<p>There was one other person at Mindaroona who saw the advertisement and read
it with positive dismay. This was Harold, who up to the Shaleville visit had
supposed himself to be Harold Hesseltine, and who had ever since carried about
with him the burden of a secret which made it difficult for him to accept his
adopted mother's affection without revealing his knowledge of her
duplicity.</p>
<p>When Harold read the advertisement he turned faint and sick with sudden
apprehensions. Who could the stranger be who was endeavouring to trace the
movements of 'Mrs. Robertson from India' in Melbourne twenty years earlier?</p>
<p>He left the house quickly and jumped on his own special hack that was tied
up to the fence outside. "Tell my mother I won't be back till late, Mick," he
called to the rouseabout, and, touching old Hailstorm with the spur, dashed
away on a ten-mile ride to the station boundary.</p>
<p>He had plenty of time to think as he cantered over the springy turf, while
old Hailstorm reefed and snatched at the bit in the pure joy of life and
movement.</p>
<p>"My adoptive mother must never find out who the new boundary-rider is," he
muttered to himself, "or there'll be the deuce to pay." And then he lost
himself in thought.</p>
<p>Surely it was impossible, incredible that the woman who had been as a mother
to him from his infancy could have any secret knowledge of his real
mother&mdash;or could be even remotely connected with her disappearance. He
felt himself growing cold all over at the bare thought of it.</p>
<p>Yet Humphry, his brother, was full of dark suspicions, and had come to
Mindaroona to watch.</p>
<p>Old Hailstorm threw the distance lightly behind him that morning, and
presently the boundary fence dividing Mindaroona from the Linton's place,
Yarralla, came into view. It was a well-known track for the grey, because it
led to a favourite meeting-place of Harold and Leonie, just over the crest of
the hill, from the summit of which they could see the sea in the distance and
the long trails of smoke from the passing steamers.</p>
<p>The boundary-rider's hut stood under a clump of blue gums in the corner of
the Mindaroona paddock, and a man in shirtsleeves, breeches, rough leggings,
and spurs was straining a new top wire in the dividing fence with a
wire-strainer.</p>
<p>"Hullo," said Harold, "you're acting the part all right, I see. Come and sit
down on this log, for I've something important to tell you." He tied old
Hailstorm to the fence, and, sitting on the log, pulled a newspaper out of his
pocket and showed Humphry the startling advertisement that he had seen in
it.</p>
<p>Humphry read the advertisement through carefully. "Somebody else is on the
search too!" he ejaculated. "Wonder who it can be."</p>
<p>"I've been trying to guess," said Harold, "and I'll admit I'm beaten. It
can't be either of our adoptive mothers, and they're the only people so far as
we know who had any interest in&mdash;our mother."</p>
<p>"Well, it seems to me," said Humphry, scrutinising the advertisement again,
"that the advertiser who is behind Sharp and Stringer is hardly likely to get
any response to his request, or perhaps I should say to her request, for it may
be a woman. Mrs. Martin will hold her tongue on my account, and Mrs. Hesseltine
is hardly likely to assist in uncovering a mystery in which she is evidently
involved herself."</p>
<p>Harold drew figures in the dust with the point of his riding-switch. "I hope
that you'll be able to find some clue soon, old man," he said, laying his hand
affectionately on Humphry's shoulder. "Every day that you are here increases
the risk that my moth&mdash;that Mrs. Hesseltine may find you out, and also
that Finegan's discovery of you may bring the police out to take you back to
Victoria in spite of your innocence. I shall never be able to rest now until
this dreadful mystery is cleared up. I feel that I have not the right to look
Leonie in the face and offer her my love, for I am not Harold Hesseltine of
Mindaroona, but nameless, a nobody's child, the son of a mother who gave me up
and of a father who never saw me. Oh, it is terrible, terrible!"</p>
<p>Humphry, too, was deeply moved. He stood up and cast his eyes round the
magnificent well-grassed Mindaroona paddocks with something like despair. And
then his gaze fell on the blue Pacific in the distance and on the smoke of a
passing steamer far out on the horizon. "It's a big search," he answered, "but
I'm bound to go through with it. If Mrs. Hesseltine can't throw any light on
the riddle we must try another way. But I have a feeling that somewhere within
range of my eyes even here I shall find the traces that I am looking for."
Again his gaze travelled all round the horizon, searching the rolling country
to north and west and south&mdash;and to east the blue segment of the ocean,
above which the last trail of smoke from a disappearing steamer still
lingered.</p>
<p>"What are you going to do about&mdash;Mrs. Hesseltine?" asked Harold,
boggling at the unfamiliar style of speaking about the woman who had taught him
to regard her as his mother.</p>
<p>"That'll be your job," said Humphry with determination. "I cannot go near
her. But you must see her and speak to her this very day. You must find out
what she knows about our real mother. If she knows anything at all, I'll find a
way to make her speak&mdash;you may trust me for that." Humphry's dark eyes
sparkled. It was plain that he would consider neither man nor woman in the
prosecution of the great quest.</p>
<p>But when Harold mounted old Hailstorm for the return journey his heart was
as heavy as lead. He dreaded the coming interview with the woman who had played
upon him this enormous and unheard-of trick, who had pretended to him that he
was the son of her body when in fact he was the son of an unknown, strange
woman who had drifted mysteriously into Australia, and had drifted as
mysteriously away from it again. Why had the mistress of Mindaroona done this
thing? She might be able to tell him something more of the mother who had given
him up and of the father who was said to have died so long ago in a far
country. But would she?</p>
<p>"Coo-ee," a fresh young voice sounded across the paddock, and, looking up,
Harold saw Leonie and Marion Bingham cantering across the turf towards the
boundary fence.</p>
<p>"Quick! Into the hut, Humphry!" he shouted, and Humphry disappeared just as
the two girls reached the slip panel.</p>
<p>"Who is it you were talking to, Harold?" called Leonie, reining up at the
other side of the fence.</p>
<p>"Only the new boundary-rider," replied Harold, and then, dismounting, he put
down the slip panel and let the girls come through. "Come along, Leonie. Come
along, Miss Bingham. I'll give you a race." And away he went at a smart gallop,
eager to draw off the girls from the dangerous locality of the new
boundary-rider's hut.</p>
<p>Leonie and Marion followed him, but not before Humphry, peering through the
little square window of the hut, had seen them, recognising Leonie again in a
moment and wondering who her companion could be&mdash;that beautiful, graceful
girl who turned her head to scan the hut as she rode away, swaying to the long
gallop of her horse like a reed that moves in a summer wind.</p>
<p>She had passed him by without seeing him. But he had seen her. And he made
up his mind at once to see her again.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII. THE ARRIVAL OF GULAB SINGH</h2>
<p>The longer Finegan thought over the extra-ordinary resemblance between the
young iron-worker at Shaleville, whom he positively identified as Humphry
Robertson, and the young squatter of Mindaroona, who was well known to
everybody in the neighbourhood as Mr. Harold Hesseltine, the more convinced he
became that here was a secret which it would pay him to unravel.</p>
<p>After that terrible experience on the top of the blast furnace Finegan could
not bring himself to denounce Humphry as the man who was wanted for the bank
embezzlement in Victoria. Besides, he argued, there was surely a mistake
somewhere. It was impossible that a thief would leap into the anteroom of hell
to save the man who was about to arrest him.</p>
<p>But there was clearly some close connection between Harold Hesseltine and
Humphry Robertson, alias Scott. Tim Finegan felt himself trembling on the verge
of a great discovery. He had ascertained that Humphry left the ironworks on the
morning after the terrible experience in the ore-holder and had not since been
seen by any one in Shaleville. But Harold Hesseltine was at Mindaroona.</p>
<p>Finegan decided to ride over from Caringal to Mindaroona. The major had gone
out and nobody was about. It was a good opportunity to call round and have a
chat with Mrs. Hesseltine's new cook. He had already made the acquaintance of
Jeanie McPherson, and it would probably be easy to find out all that she knew
about the young man whom he had seen with his own eyes deep in consultation
with the ex-bank clerk from Melbourne who had endeavoured so unsuccessfully to
sink his identity by securing a job in the great iron-works.</p>
<p>The major's new bookkeeper had some trouble in catching a mount, but after a
good deal of running about he succeeded in cornering a quiet old brown
stock-horse and getting the saddle and bridle on him.</p>
<p>Cantering along the gently rising track to Mindaroona, wrapped in
speculations as to the fate of the missing woman whose disappearance he was
supposed to be investigating, he found his thoughts returning steadily to the
puzzling similarity and secret connection between the young ironworker and the
son and heir of Mindaroona.</p>
<p>But the whole thing was a tangle that was quite beyond his power to
unravel.</p>
<p>He looked along the track that stretched away ahead of him and became aware
of a curious figure toiling along on foot.</p>
<p>The old brown stock-horse, with his 'two-pence three-halfpence' canter,
quickly over-hauled the pedestrian, and Finegan passed him without deigning a
second glance, merely wondering to himself how the dickens so many Afghan
hawkers managed to get into the country in spite of the Immigration Restriction
Act.</p>
<p>The Afghan hawker sat on a stump to rest for a few minutes. As a matter of
fact he was no more an Afghan than he was an Assyrian; though nine out of ten
of his customers described him as being either one or the other, forgetting
that the true Afghan is too good a soldier to be a successful pedlar and that
the Assyrian Empire was finally blotted out about two thousand five hundred
years ago.</p>
<p>This particular dark-skinned individual, who spat on the ground as Tim
Finegan cantered past, throwing the dust into his face, happened to be a native
of British India. What the temptation was that induced him to leave his native
country, and by what mysterious devices he succeeded in making his way to
Australia, are matters that rested between himself and the deities of his
heathen mythology.</p>
<p>In all probability he followed out some course of action similar to that
which is so successfully adopted by the ever-increasing horde of dark-skinned
Asiatics who pop up in the remotest regions of the Bush with enigmatical grins
upon their visages and well-filled packs of cheap jewellery and feminine finery
on their backs. No one knows whence they come or whither they go. The important
fact is that they are there and that most of them are quite ready to bully and
frighten white womenfolk if the men are away from the hut when the 'Assyrian'
happens to come down like a wolf on the fold.</p>
<p>Gulab Singh&mdash;for that was his name according to the exemption
certificate which procured him admission to the Commonwealth&mdash;on the
ground that he was a former resident of Australia returning after a visit to
his native country&mdash;picked up his pack once more and plodded on, heading
for Mindaroona, where he hoped to dispose of a good portion of his stock. He
had a special side-line in fortune-telling, which he found a particularly
remunerative art in the Bush, especially among the womenkind. He trudged along
hopefully in the wake of the dust-surrounded horseman.</p>
<p>When Tim Finegan reached the fence at the back of the homestead he
dismounted and hung his bridle over a post, whistling hopefully, and quite
regardless of the scowl on the face of Ah Tong, Mrs. Hesseltine's valued and
highly paid horticulturist, who was watering his asparagus bed in the adjoining
vegetable garden.</p>
<p>"Good-day to you, Jeanie," said Tim Finegan politely as he opened the gate
and walked into the enclosure; "sure 'tis beautiful dryin' weather to-day." He
looked with respectful admiration at the well-covered clothes-lines upon which
Jeanie McPherson, Mrs. Hesseltine's new treasure, not long from Peebles per
favour of the Immigration Bureau, was performing the last joyous rites of
washing-day.</p>
<p>Jeanie McPherson paused in the act of pinning an article of feminine
underwear of generous dimensions on the clothes-line, and hurriedly removing
two wooden clothes-pegs from between her glistening little white teeth, turned
her blushing face towards the new-comer.</p>
<p>"Hech, Mester Finegan, how ye frichtened me!" said the maiden; "but come
richt in tae the hoose and hae a crack."</p>
<p>"You wantee catch welly ni lettucee, Jee Nee?" called Ah Tong, popping his
forbidding countenance over the light paling fence that separated the vegetable
garden from the kitchen premises, and brandishing the material for a succulent
salad most invitingly. Ah Tong displayed an ingratiating smile that might be
called seraphic, if seraphs wore pigtails and showed long yellow pointed teeth
when they smiled.</p>
<p>"Nae, nae," cried pretty Jeanie with a deprecatory wave of her plump little
hands, "I'm no wantin' onything at a' the noo." She ran to Tim Finegan as if
for protection, and seemed to be quite relieved in her mind when she found
herself beside him. "I'm sae frichtened o' the gairdiner," she explained in a
stage whisper; "I dinna ken what I'm tryin to dae when he speirs aboot me
vegetables."</p>
<p>Tim Finegan was always ready to console a poor girl in distress. He took one
of Jeanie's shapely hands in his own and stroked the back of it with broad
human sympathy. "Don't cry, my dear," he said kindly; "I'll take care that the
blooming Chow keeps on his own side of the fence."</p>
<p>"Aim nae greetin'," sniffed Jeanie, as bravely as she could, "but a never
saw a theng like that i' Peebles, an' I'm fair scairt, I'm tellin' ye, when it
glowers at me."</p>
<p>The grinning mask of Ah Tong above the paling fence was distorted with rage
when Finegan continued to stroke the hand that was imprisoned in his own, and
even to add other little endearments which his experience suggested as proper
to the situation, such as putting his arm around the jimp waist and chucking
the agitated lassie under her dimpled chin.</p>
<p>Ah Tong disappeared, but jealous wrath was plainly stamped upon his ugly
face, and he muttered incoherently to himself as he flung the rejected lettuce
on the path and danced on it. "Me give 'im whaffor bimeby," he gabbled darkly,
while Finegan improved the occasion in the romantic neighbourhood of the
well-laden clothes-line.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Jeanie," pursued Tim Finegan encouragingly, "what sort of a young
fellow is Mr. Harold, and how does he get on with his mother? That young chap
has quite taken my fancy."</p>
<p>"Weel now, Mester Finegan, I'm thenkin' that somethin' is wrang wi' Mester
Harold an' his young leddy ower by Yarralla. It gars me greet to see them the
noo sae far apairt, an' weel I ken that somethin's come between the laddie an'
the lassie."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said Finegan; "since when?"</p>
<p>"Sence Mester Harold stayed out i' Shaleville for hauf the nicht," said
Jeanie in a whisper, her large blue eyes agoggle with puzzled disapproval. "Do
ye think, Mester Finegan, that he found some ither lassie i' Shaleville?"</p>
<p>"Not he," said Finegan confidently.</p>
<p>"Weel noo, I'm tellin' ye," continued Jeanie, "his mither's hairdly spoken
tae him sence that nicht, an' Miss Leonie seems to keep oot o' his way, an' the
major when he comes to see the mistress will be settin' glowerin' at his ain
toes for minutes thegither sayin' naething at a', an' the mistress looks aften
eneuch like as if she'd been speirin' for ghaisties, an' I'm no that
comfortable that I thocht to be in Mindaroona."</p>
<p>Jeanie was on the verge of tears, and Tim Finegan, while consoling her to
the best of his ability, reflected that certainly there was something wrong at
Mindaroona.</p>
<p>Was it possible that the trouble could be connected with the disappearance
of the woman who had vanished twenty years ago. That disappearance he knew was
in part, at any rate, the cause of the major's preoccupation, but then the
major had told him definitely that he had not confided the subject of the
search to anybody. It was almost inconceivable that Mrs. Hesseltine, or Harold,
or Leonie Linton could know anything about it.</p>
<p>Finegan had his own idea about the major's reason for investigating the
disappearance of Mrs. Harrington. "Been making love to her in India, of
course," he said to himself sagely, "an' afraid she'll turn up again an' queer
his pitch with the widow." Well, as long as the major paid him he was quite
willing to continue the search. At the same time he felt that the atmosphere of
suspicion at Mindaroona, the rift between Harold on the one hand and his mother
and fiancee on the other, and the sudden appearance at Shaleville of Humphry
Robertson, the ex-bank clerk from Melbourne, who was as like Harold as one new
shilling is like another, were irritating and perplexing factors in the main
problem. If he could only find out what the connection was between Humphry
Robertson and Harold Hesseltine, and what scheme they were jointly pursuing, he
felt that it would be a distinct step in advance.</p>
<p>"See here, Jeanie, my girl," said Tim Finegan suddenly, "have you ever heard
since you came here that Mr. Harold had a brother?"</p>
<p>"A brither!" ejaculated Jeanie, in surprise. "Nae, nae, the laddie has nae
brither at a'. There's just himsel'."</p>
<p>"How long has old Simon Hesseltine, his father, been dead?"</p>
<p>"A dinna richtly ken, but lang Tammas the stockman telt me that the auld man
never cud bear to look at the bairn frae the day he first set his een on him.
An' Mistress Hesseltine never had but the ane. Gude maircy, what is that?"</p>
<p>It was Gulab Singh, who had just arrived and was looking over the gate. With
the calm assurance of his profession, he slipped back the bolt and entered with
his pack, solemn-visaged, imperturbable, business-like.</p>
<p>"Missy want to buy anything to-day?" he remarked in astonishingly good
English. "Very good ribbon, very good handkerchief, or some nice pearl
earrings?"</p>
<p>But Jeanie sprang back in alarm from the fluent stranger. His dusky beauty
did not appeal to her. Her trained eye saw at once that his turban called
loudly for the washtub, and she also remarked that he wore his nails a good
deal longer than was considered fashionable in Peebles.</p>
<p>"Dinna pit oot the fairings here," she cried, "but ye can bide a wee whiles
I'm tellin' the mistress. Maybe she'll ca' for ye on the front verandah."</p>
<p>She was off like an arrow, and Finegan inly cursed the intruder, who had
broken in upon a line of investigation that was not only agreeable but likely
to produce results.</p>
<p>"Hello, King Billy," began Finegan glibly, "how long you bin hump Matilda in
this pfeller country, eh?"</p>
<p>"I spik the English quite well," remarked the Indian person calmly. "I
learned it first in Government school at Lahore. If you will so kindly make the
conversation in English, I am very pleased to give you the informations."</p>
<p>"Gee-long!" exclaimed Finegan, surprised out of himself; "I suppose you'll
be standing for Parliament next?"</p>
<p>"It is possible," observed Gulab Singh calmly. "At Government school of
Lahore I perused the works of John Stuart Mill, Macaulay, Tennyson, Ruskin, and
Matthew Arnold. I am supporter of principles of political liberty. I received
much education at Lahore. I know the doctrines of free trade, also of
protection. I consider that cumbrous and antiquated system of land tenure in
India's great obstacle to development of country. All these matters I learnt,
but found avenues of using knowledge much, oh! very much restricted, wherefore
I became butler to officer sahib at rupees 10 per mensem. Subsequently I came
to this country. Now I am business man. Oh yes, very good business man. Can I
sell you something to-day, a pipe or very fine jewelled pin?"</p>
<p>"My oath, you're the one!" said Finegan. "By the way, haven't you got any
land yet?"</p>
<p>"Not yet, but soon yes. I am applicant at ballot for many eligible blocks.
Presently I shall secure one of those blocks. Many of my countrymen have them
already in this State. In meanwhile I sell goods on commission&mdash;very good
commission&mdash;and I also tell past and future events. Shall I tell you past
and future events?"</p>
<p>"You might tell me a bit of your own past. Whose exemption certificate did
you beg, borrow, or steal in India, eh? And how did you manage to bluff the
Customs officer? Do you know that as a prohibited immigrant you're liable under
the Act of 1901 to six months' imprisonment and then deportation?" Gulab Singh
waved a deprecating palm. "You do not remember that I am educated. I know free
trade and protection. I also know politics. Your Government will not send me to
prison for six months because it would make much trouble. Questions would be
asked in British Parliament, also in National Congress. How can a British
subject be imprisoned for crime of being in a British dominion? Your law says
that you can imprison me for six months, but if you do it bombs will be thrown
in Dacca and there will be riots in Lahore. Already there is much trouble owing
to treatment of my countrymen in the Transvaal. Your Government must not make
more trouble here. The position is delicate. You see, I am educated. I study
politics. Perhaps I shall be a member of the first Indian Parliament. Who
knows? Meanwhile, here comes the female servant of the house. I am perhaps
requested to display my merchandise. It is well."</p>
<p>"Mester Finegan, Mester Finegan!" cried Jeanie McPherson, waving shapely
arms from afar, "wull ye please to stop yer havering and send the black mon
roun' the hoose to the front verandy? The mistress an' the major wad be glad
tae speak wi' him."</p>
<p>"Hold on a minute," said Finegan, who had been regarding the gifted stranger
with ill-dissembled amazement. "What was the name of the place in India that
you said you came from?"</p>
<p>"Tilgit," said Gulab Singh calmly, as he walked off with his pack towards
the front verandah of the homestead.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII. YELLOW AGAINST BLACK</h2>
<p>As Gulab Singh with his pack on his back turned the angle of the house and
opened up the verandah upon which Major McLean and Mrs. Hesseltine were
reclining in long cane chairs placed side by side, he gave a start of
astonishment. Then, composing his features again into their customary Oriental
impassivity, he proceeded to open his pack.</p>
<p>His goods were of excellent quality. Scent, ribbons, gloves, handkerchiefs,
silk stockings, shoes, a few lace blouses, pipes, ties, braces, socks, and
imitation Panama hats. Mrs. Hesseltine bought a few articles and so did the
major.</p>
<p>Gulab Singh salaamed.</p>
<p>"Some of these fellows are great practitioners of the occult," whispered the
major to Mrs. Hesseltine. "I have seen them do some extraordinary things in
India. Suppose we ask him if he knows anything of the craft of yogi."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine assented, although she felt strangely nervous of the Indian
with his dirty turban and his long nails.</p>
<p>"I say, what's your name and what part of India do you come from?" inquired
the major, lighting another cigarette.</p>
<p>"I am Gulab Singh, sahib," replied the hawker, "from the Punjaub. I spik the
English very well. I am educated at Government school of Lahore. I have perused
the works of Mill, Ruskin, Tennyson, and Macaulay."</p>
<p>"The deuce you have! Do any yogi tricks?"</p>
<p>"I do not make tricks, sahib," said Gulab Singh, drawing himself up with
dignity, "but by meditation and fasting I have power to reveal past and unfold
future."</p>
<p>"By Jove! you're just the man I'm looking for," said the major, half in jest
and half in earnest. "Put down your pack and let us see what you can do. You
shan't lose by it, I promise you. Let's have a bit of the past&mdash;my past,
of course&mdash;for a start."</p>
<p>Gulab Singh salaamed once more. "Your honour shall be obeyed," he said very
solemnly.</p>
<p>The Indian left his pack on the edge of the verandah and stalked across the
lawn to a patch of young gum saplings near the gate. He pulled a handful of the
leaves; then he bent down and picked up a small quantity of stiff, clayey soil
from Mrs. Hesseltine's rose-border.</p>
<p>Returning to the verandah, he squatted on his haunches in front of the
major, moistened the clay with saliva, and stuck it upon a gum leaf, which he
placed in the palm of his left hand. He rubbed the clay until the surface was
smooth and shining. Then, muttering some incomprehensible jargon of words, he
stared steadfastly into the polished clay.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine sat up in her chair nervously expectant. She could not take
her eyes off that squatting sinister figure for an instant.</p>
<p>"Well, Gulab Singh," said the major with a forced laugh, "what can you see
there?"</p>
<p>"I see nothing yet," said Gulab Singh. He polished the clay surface with his
long black forefinger. There was an anxious pause. Again he murmured his
mysterious jargon.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid you're a bit of a humbug," said the major lightly, but to Mrs.
Hesseltine's ear there seemed to be a note of relief in his voice.</p>
<p>"The mirror is clouding over," said Gulab Singh in his low, monotonous
voice. "Now it clears again. I see&mdash;a woman."</p>
<p>The major positively jumped and Mrs. Hesseltine looked at him in a scared
kind of way. The tension was becoming quite painful.</p>
<p>"The woman is lying on a long chair on the verandah of a bungalow. There are
mountains all around. They are high mountains with snow on them. The woman is
very pale. Her eyes and hair are dark. She looks as though she had been
weeping."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!" said the major excitedly. "Go on, man, go on."</p>
<p>"I see an officer in uniform riding up to the gate. He dismounts. He
approaches the bungalow. He speaks to the woman."</p>
<p>"What is he like, man, what is he like?"</p>
<p>"I&mdash;I cannot see his face, it is turned away. Ah, now he turns it
towards me."</p>
<p>"Well, well, can you recognise the features? Who is it?"</p>
<p>"Sahib, it is you."</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine stifled a scream and sat up on her chair, wide-eyed, staring
at the Indian. The major's face was pale under its tan. This was certainly
interesting.</p>
<p>"The sahib and the mem-sahib seem to be quarrelling," continued the Indian
in his monotonous, passionless voice. "Now he comforts her and kisses her. She
puts her hand to her breast, she sways to and fro, she faints. There is a plain
gold ring on the third finger of her left hand."</p>
<p>The major looked with amazement at the preposterous figure squatting before
him on the verandah.</p>
<p>"I see a child's face," said the Indian. "It is a shadowy face. It is
looking over the shoulder of the fainting mem-sahib. I see it more plainly.
Sahib, where is your son?"</p>
<p>"Here, I've had enough of this," said the major, whose face was pale and
ghastly. "I have no son. I have never had a son. Get out of this, you offspring
of Shaitan, and take your devil-tricks somewhere else."</p>
<p>He threw a couple of sovereigns into the extended palm, and went abruptly
into the house to get a brandy and soda, for his tongue was sticking to the
roof of his mouth.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine lay back in her long chair with closed eyes. The strangest
thoughts were whirling through her brain. The major had been married when he
was in India and had kept it a secret from her and from everybody else who knew
him in Australia. This fakir said that the major's wife had had a son. Who was
the wife and where was the son? Mrs. Hesseltine simply dared not allow herself
to think any longer. She opened her eyes again and looked around. The Indian
was just walking away with his pack.</p>
<p>And as he disappeared round the corner the garden gate opened and Harold
entered. How changed that once lighthearted boy had become! She felt an
unspoken accusation in his stare.</p>
<p>"I've brought Leonie and Marion home to tea, mother," said Harold quietly,
and as he spoke the two girls, still in their riding-habits, came up and kissed
Mrs. Hesseltine affectionately.</p>
<p>"We've had such a lovely ride," chattered Leonie, "haven't we, Marion? And
Harold was really quite gay and like his old self, weren't you, Harold? We went
through the home paddocks and across the creek and then over the Black Mountain
to the boundary-rider's hut, and back by the old track to the dam, and so home.
But we didn't see the new boundary-rider. I believe the poor man was shy. He
disappeared into his hut like a lizard into a hole in a rock when he saw us
coming. Didn't he, Marion?"</p>
<p>But Harold changed the subject and switched the conversation on to a new
track with a jolt. "Rum-looking chap, that old Hindoo hawker," he remarked
abruptly. "I hope he won't fall foul of Ah Tong. The gardener is getting more
pernicketty every day, mother. You'll really have to get rid of him. He has got
to talking to himself now."</p>
<p>"He gives us better cauliflowers than ever grew at Mindaroona before, dear,"
said Mrs. Hesseltine, "and as long as he does that he can talk to himself as
much as he likes, if it amuses him."</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you know what's the matter with the poor fellow?" put in Leonie.
"He's head over ears in love with that pretty Scotch lassie in the kitchen, but
hard-hearted Jeanie won't have anything at all to do with him. She confided to
me one day last week that he asked her to 'mally' him, and I gathered that her
'hoots' and 'toots' anent the proposal were anything but complimentary to
him."</p>
<p>"Probably he's jealous," said Marion reflectively. "There's nothing makes an
ordinary man so bad-tempered as jealousy&mdash;unless it's drink. And I suppose
a Chinese feels the same way about it."</p>
<p>"But he hasn't anybody to be jealous of," said Mrs. Hesseltine with a smile.
"Poor Jeanie hasn't seen an admirer since she has been here, unless it's that
mysterious man Finegan who has been staying up at Caringal, pretending to be
the major's new bookkeeper."</p>
<p>"It's to be hoped Ah Tong won't get it into his head that he is being cut
out by the gentleman from Ind&mdash;"</p>
<p>But the sentence was never finished. The three ladies on the verandah sprang
to their feet as a long, unearthly, blood-chilling screech rose upon the air
somewhere at the back of the homestead. They looked at each other
open-eyed.</p>
<p>"Please stay here, mother," said Harold curtly, "and you too, Leonie and
Marion. I'll go round and find out what's the matter. It sounded like Jeanie
McPherson." He snatched up his heavy hunting-crop and rushed off to the back of
the house, skirting the paling fence that divided the drying yard from the
vegetable garden.</p>
<p>Harold was just in time to see Ah Tong scrambling over the six-foot paling
fence with blood in his eye and a long-handled garden hoe in his hand. As the
Chinaman was preparing to drop from the top of the fence, he caught his foot in
the handle of the hoe and fell headlong into Jeanie's rubbish-bin, a large
galvanised-iron receptacle full of potato peelings, eggshells, tea-leaves, and
kitchen fat.</p>
<p>Harold could see at once that Gulab Singh was the objective of the attack.
Finegan had ridden back to Caringal while the hawker was at the front of the
house, and when Gulab Singh, chuckling quietly to himself, reappeared in the
yard, he had a capital opportunity to make himself pleasant to the
apple-cheeked damsel frae Peebles. Ah Tong, peering over the fence, had
witnessed the colloquy. Here was a tragedy of jealousy in the true Elizabethan
manner. The Chinaman was stung to madness by seeing Jeanie with her Othello,
and it was the menace of his murderous demonstrations with the hoe that evoked
that eldritch screech from Jeanie when she saw him actually scrambling over the
fence.</p>
<p>As Harold ran forward with his hunting-crop raised, Ah Tong picked himself
out of the rubbish bin and came on to the attack, a horrid spectacle.</p>
<p>"Get back, get back, you lunatic!" yelled Harold, making a wild swipe at the
Chinaman with his hunting-crop.</p>
<p>Ah Tong darted back out of reach, and whirling the long-handled hoe with
both hands, dealt the luckless youth a terrific crack on the head at long range
and felled him to the ground.</p>
<p>Jeanie had fled to the furthest part of the yard, where she wedged herself
into the corner, emitting short shrill shrieks in swift succession, but Gulab
Singh stood his ground firmly with his back to one of the stout posts
supporting the clothes-line in the middle of the yard. With all his shiftiness
he came of a fighting race, and, moreover, he was not caught unprepared. From
some mysterious recess of his frowsy garments he produced a long,
wicked-looking knife, and as he gripped the horn handle with determination it
was plain that the Chinaman would not have it all his own way.</p>
<p>Ah Tong, spurred to frenzy by his easy victory over Harold, surrendered
himself to the fierce joy of running amok.</p>
<p>Uttering a tremendous yell, he rushed at the Indian, wielding the hoe in
both hands, and whirling it round his head, let fly a terrific blow which would
have smashed Gulab Singh's skull like an eggshell if it had taken effect.</p>
<p>But Gulab Singh ducked in the nick of time, and the Chinaman, missing his
mark, overbalanced himself and staggered for a few yards as though about to
fall. Before he could recover his stability the Indian was at him, and a slash
of the long knife ripped open the Chinaman's sleeve and drew blood from a
glancing cut.</p>
<p>Dropping the hoe, Ah Tong made a grab for the knife, which slipped from the
Indian's grasp and fell to the ground. Seeing that his opponent was weaponless,
the Chinaman wreathed his long gorilla-like arms around Gulab Singh and strove
to throw him, but the Indian, though inferior in height and weight, was an
accomplished wrestler and Ah Tong was speedily in difficulties. As they came to
the ground the Chinaman was underneath, and the crash with which his head hit
the stones would have taken all the fight out of most people.</p>
<p>But Ah Tong was sustained by the strength of temporary insanity. He gripped
his opponent by the throat, and round and round they rolled together, grunting,
squeaking, and hissing as each sought to choke the life out of the other, or,
as an alternative, to get possession of the long-bladed knife that still lay
where it had been dropped.</p>
<p>The Chinaman was a distressful sight. He was covered with blood and
tea-leaves and kitchen fat from the rubbish bin. His clothes were torn to
shreds, and Gulab Singh had secured a good hold of his pigtail with one hand
and of his throat with the other, so that he could vary his method of attack by
alternately throttling his antagonist and banging his head on the ground.</p>
<p>But Ah Tong was still able to squeeze the Indian so hard in his iron grip
that Gulab Singh could feel his ribs cracking, and it was difficult to say how
the issue would have gone if the men had been left to fight it out without
interference.</p>
<p>A diversion was soon at hand, however, for Jeanie began to scream with
renewed vigour as the black man and the yellow man, locked in deadly mutual
grips, began to roll nearer and nearer to the corner where she had taken
refuge.</p>
<p>Mindaroona homestead was solidly built of stone, and the major was in the
front of the house, but the voice of the Scotch lassie raised in frantic appeal
for assistance reached him, and, leaping through the open French window, he
made his way to the scene of action.</p>
<p>One glance at the maddened antagonists, who were rolling round and round,
scratching, kicking, biting, squeezing, butting, punching, and throttling each
other, covered in blood, and mud, and tea-leaves, and kitchen fat, was enough
to show the major that it was a case for drastic treatment, and that at the
same time a third party interfering would stand a good chance of being
murdered.</p>
<p>Compared with the contest between the Indian native and the Chinese, an
ordinary dog-fight would have been a mere unexciting tiff.</p>
<p>As they rolled and scuffled on the ground under the clothes-line, Ah Tong
had grabbed at a waving streamer of finely laundered linen with disastrous
results. In its fall it brought down other items of the weekly wash, and when
the major arrived on the scene the grimy combatants were impeded in their
efforts to assassinate each other by being tangled up with delicate
habiliments, frilled, billowy, and lacy, of every size and shape.</p>
<p>Jeanie McPherson in her corner wrung her hands despairingly over the ruined
garments, ravished from their protecting clothes-line and dragged in the
mire.</p>
<p>The major was not lacking in physical courage, but he was faddy on the
subject of physical cleanliness, and he shrank from personal contact with two
animated rubbish-bins. However, he was also a man of resource, quick to devise
a plan and prompt to execute it.</p>
<p>Running to the tool-house, he dragged out a length of stout garden hose, and
hastily screwed the brass-fitted end of it to the standard at the side of the
yard. Minderoona was noted for its splendid water supply.</p>
<p>Grasping the business end of the hose, which terminated in a long brass
nozzle, the major called to Jeanie to turn on the tap. There was an excellent
pressure, as it happened, and the powerful jet of water that leaped from the
nozzle as the major carefully aimed it took all the fight out of Ah Tong and
loosened the tenacious grip of Gulab Singh effectively.</p>
<p>No human beings could withstand such a deluge, and the half-drowned
combatants staggered to their feet, seeking escape at all costs. The major kept
the hose on Ah Tong until the dripping Chinaman fairly ran from the yard and
disappeared into the adjoining paddock. And that was the last of Ah Tong that
Mindaroona ever saw.</p>
<p>Then the major turned his attention to Gulab Singh, who seemed to be in a
bad way, and also to Harold Hesseltine, who was sitting up on the ground
holding his head in both hands. Harold was a bit dazed, and there was a lump as
big as an egg on the side of his head, but the major gave a sigh of relief when
he saw that the boy was not seriously injured.</p>
<p>Presently, as the major bent over the Indian, gazing intently into his face,
Gulab Singh opened his eyes. The douching that he had got from the garden hose
had washed off all the dust with which his face was encrusted and his features
obscured when he first arrived. It had also washed off the blood from the late
encounter.</p>
<p>He looked up at the major and his lips curled in a faint grin. "It is a pity
that you came, sahib, a great pity. I would have killed that pig-tailed child
of Shaitan with my two hands."</p>
<p>But the major was staring at the hawker with incredulity and amazement
stamped on every feature. "I know your face," he said at last; "your name is
not Gulab Singh. You are the man who was my servant at Tilgit. You are Muhammad
Bahksh."</p>
<p>And then the significance of the incident struck him, and his brain
reeled.</p>
<p>So this was the explanation of the amazing bit of jugglery that had been
worked off on him by the Indian. Muhammad Bahksh had recognised him at once,
and had drawn upon memory, not upon second-sight, for that astonishing
description of the scene on the verandah of the bungalow in Tilgit. He had
remembered the major's wife perfectly. But why, then, had he talked about the
major's son?</p>
<p>The major lifted the man up and placed him in a sitting posture with his
back against the heavy square post supporting the clothes-lines. Placing both
hands upon the Indian's shoulders, he stared him straight between the eyes.</p>
<p>"Now, Muhammad Bahksh," he said, "tell me the truth. What did you mean when
you asked me about my son?"</p>
<p>"Sahib," said the man, drawing his breath with difficulty, "it is true that
I am Muhammad Bahksh. Yet, having bought from Gulab Singh the paper which
allowed the possessor to pass freely into this country, I became Gulab Singh.
It is nothing. What matters one name or another?"</p>
<p>"But why did you speak a little while ago about my son?" persisted the
major; "for I have no son, nor have I seen my wife since I returned from
fighting against the Zakka Khels."</p>
<p>"Sahib," muttered the Indian, "a blind mule sees nothing, but one that hath
two good eyes can see the grass growing. Were you not married to the mem-sahib
for nearly three months before she went away?"</p>
<p>The major nodded excitedly.</p>
<p>"And do you not remember the day when she fainted on the verandah of the
bungalow?"</p>
<p>Again the major motioned assent.</p>
<p>"Sahib, the ayah Shaibalini told me then that the mem-sahib would be the
mother of a child. For the mem-sahib had told her. And that is why I asked you
just now, saying, 'Where is your son?' for assuredly it is a son, and he still
lives."</p>
<p>The major started up abruptly. "Come along into the house, Harold," he
called to the young fellow, who was ruefully feeling the bump on his head,
while Jeanie hovered round him, tearfully murmuring incomprehensible regrets.
"Come into the house and get your head bathed."</p>
<p>He threw a glance at the Indian before he left. "I'll be back to speak
further with you, Muhammad Bahksh, on this matter," he called to the
adventurous hawker. "There are things that I have yet to learn concerning
you."</p>
<p>But as soon as the major had entered the house Muhammad Bahksh, alias Gulab
Singh, rose to his feet and picked up his pack. He had no desire to be
questioned further concerning the transaction with Gulab Singh. It seemed to
the student of Mill and Macaulay quite possible that the troopers whom he
occasionally met in the Bush might subject him to humiliating restraints on his
personal liberty if they ascertained from the major that he was Muhammad Bahksh
and not Gulab Singh at all.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the Indian drifted out from Mindaroona as he had drifted in,
and when the major returned after bathing Harold's head there was no sign of
the wanderer who had conveyed to him the startling intelligence that he was a
father.</p>
<p>He the father of a child! It was quite likely, although he had never thought
of it before. Here, then, was a link with the past which made it impossible for
him to cut those old days in India out of his life as he thought he could have
done.</p>
<p>If the Indian was right and a son had been born to him, that son would be
twenty years of age. The major felt a strange thrill in his heart.</p>
<p>He had a twofold reason now for tracing the movements of his wife, and he
determined to apply himself to the task with redoubled energy.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX. A CLUE AND A KANGAROO HUNT</h2>
<p>Old Simon Hesseltine had one good point, at any rate, for which he deserved
to be kept in remembrance. He bred some good horses.</p>
<p>The Mindaroona brand was well known on every show-ground within a hundred
miles of the station, and Wallaroo, the big, strapping chestnut that Humphry
mounted a couple of mornings after his arrival, had more than once gained a
place in the heavyweight hunters' competitions.</p>
<p>He was a big-boned horse, decidedly on the plain side, with a head like a
portmanteau, and he stood nearly seventeen hands high, but in spite of his
looks he could both jump and gallop, and he could stay for a week.</p>
<p>"Shure ye can ride him to hell an' back in the wan day," said Mike, the
rouseabout, as he handed the horse over to Harold on the previous morning, "an'
he'll niver lay a toe on anny fince all the way." So Harold handed him over to
Humphry, and Humphry climbed into the saddle, purposing to ride out to the
Black Mountain and interview Angus McPhee, the old shepherd who was with Simon
Hesseltine before his marriage, and would doubtless remember Mrs. Hesseltine's
return from Melbourne with the unexpected infant.</p>
<p>It would be strange, indeed, if Angus McPhee could not say definitely
whether or not a strange lady had arrived from Melbourne soon after Mrs.
Hesseltine's eventful holiday of twenty years earlier, and, if she did arrive
then, how long she stayed and where she went on her departure.</p>
<p>Humphry felt certain that with the information to be derived from the old
shepherd he would be able to clear up the first point about which he was in
doubt, namely, whether his mother ever saw Mrs. Hesseltine again after Mrs.
Hesseltine left 'The Cedars' at St. Kilda. He had not told Harold of his
intention to sound the old shepherd, because Harold was plainly disinclined to
take any step likely to suggest that his adoptive mother had any sinister
knowledge of his real mother's disappearance. Harold plainly shrank from facing
the possibilities. He was not made of the same stern stuff as Humphry, much as
he resembled him physically.</p>
<p>Humphry touched Wallaroo with the spur and the chestnut bounded forward,
fighting for his head. When the old horse saw the fence at the end of the
paddock he distinctly pricked his ears and gathered himself together. He sailed
over it without a rap and Humphry surrendered himself to the pure joy of the
rapid motion. For such a big, ungainly-looking horse Wallaroo had a wonderfully
smooth canter, and the turf was green and springy after the winter rains.</p>
<p>With a good horse under him and the open country before him, no rider can
carry black Care behind him for very long in Australia, in spite of the ancient
poet, and Humphry speedily shook off all traces of gloom.</p>
<p>Wallaroo was a great natural jumper and he had also had plenty of practice.
Moreover, he had always been ridden by a straight-goer, and consequently he did
not know what it was to refuse. Humphry took a line as the crow flies from the
boundary fence of Mindaroona, through the intervening Yarralla paddocks, back
again into Mindaroona, and then across the creek into the scrub country
fringing the Black Mountain.</p>
<p>Nothing stopped the chestnut. No fence was too stiff and no take-off too
tricky for him, and when he got to the creek, which was forty feet across, with
steep clay banks on both sides, he slid dexterously down the descent with his
hind legs well under him and climbed the other side with a succession of bounds
that made Humphry's teeth rattle.</p>
<p>Humphry had received explicit directions from Harold, and he soon made out
the shepherd's hut. He also made out the shepherd himself sitting on a log,
with a wall-eyed collie, which was watching the billy on the fire, and was
quite ready to notify Mr. McPhee the moment that the water began to boil.</p>
<p>McPhee was over seventy and his sight was not too good, but the collie
recognised an old acquaintance in Wallaroo and gave a couple of short, sharp
barks, waving her tail in polite salutation. However, when Humphry threw his
leg over the saddle and slid to the ground she growled, sniffing
suspiciously.</p>
<p>"Wha's wrang wi' ye, Jess, ye auld fule?" said Angus McPhee, pausing for a
moment in the operation of cutting up a pipeful. "A' never knew ye tae growl at
Mesther Harold until the noo."</p>
<p>So that was it. The old man naturally took him for his brother. Well,
perhaps it was just as well not to undeceive him.</p>
<p>"I just rode across, McPhee," said Humphry, "to tell you to leave a couple
of killing sheep for the new boundary-rider."</p>
<p>"Oo aye, Mesther Harold."</p>
<p>"Foxes pretty bad lately?</p>
<p>"Oo aye, oo."</p>
<p>"How are the rabbits?"</p>
<p>"Fine."</p>
<p>Clearly this line of inquiry was not likely to lead to much. It might be
advisable to alter the plan of attack.</p>
<p>"Will you have a drink, McPhee?"</p>
<p>"Drink o' what?"</p>
<p>"A drink of whisky. I've got my flask with me."</p>
<p>"Whaur is it?"</p>
<p>Humphry produced the flask and Angus McPhee's granite visage slowly assumed
a human expression. But in all the years that he had known Harold Hesseltine he
had never seen him produce whisky before. It was a strange and stirring event
in the life of the shepherd. It was a new experience.</p>
<p>McPhee applied the flask to his lips and filled his mouth, which contained
about half a tumblerful, with the neat spirit. He swallowed it slowly and then,
reaching for his pannikin, drank about two teaspoonfuls of water.</p>
<p>"Ma respects tae ye, Mesther Harold," said the old man, whose tongue had
been thawed from its frozen stiffness by the liquor. "I'm richt gled tae see
ye. Gang oot o' this, ye auld fule, Jess, and don't be smellin' Mesther
Harold's legs. I dinna ken what ye are thenkin' aboot."</p>
<p>At that point two big kangaroo-dogs, a brindled and a black, emerged from
the bush, and the collie, with a final sniff of distrust at Humphry, went off
to join them, remarking with eye, ear, mouth, and tail, as plainly as a dog
could, that the visitor was not the person that he appeared to be, and that
Angus McPhee was a dunderheaded old fool who could not see what was as plain as
the nose on his face.</p>
<p>"Have another drink, McPhee?"</p>
<p>Again the solemn ritual was gone through, and Mr. McPhee's tongue received a
second and even more generous dose of the useful lubricant.</p>
<p>"By the way, can you remember, McPhee, the time when you first saw
Har&mdash;when you first saw me?"</p>
<p>"Oo aye, Mesther Harold. A mind weel when yer mither brocht ye hame wi' her
frae Melbourne, whaur ye were born."</p>
<p>Ah! So Simon Hesseltine had told nobody, and not a soul on the station
guessed what only he and his wife knew that the infant who was brought from
Melbourne was no child of theirs but a stranger's baby. This was something, at
any rate. If Angus McPhee, who knew most of Simon Hesseltine's secrets, had
never learnt this one, it was certain that nobody else in the neighbourhood
would be aware of it.</p>
<p>Humphry found himself marvelling at the secretiveness of Mrs. Hesseltine.
After bluffing the whole neighbourhood into the belief that the baby was her
own, she had never had the moral courage to acknowledge the deception when the
child grew up. Her husband had died without disclosing the fact, and Mrs.
Martin, far away at St. Kilda, was the only other person who knew that Mrs.
Hesseltine's heir was not her son.</p>
<p>"Look here, McPhee, do you remember any lady coming to Mindaroona to
see&mdash;my mother&mdash;soon after she brought&mdash;me&mdash;back with her
from Melbourne?"</p>
<p>"Oo aye. There was a plenty leddies comin' to Mindaroona lang syne."</p>
<p>"Can you remember any of them?"</p>
<p>"Aye, aye. I mind them weel. Weel-looking leddies eneuch, but not like auld
Simon's wife&mdash;nae, nae. She was the bonniest o' them a."</p>
<p>"Would you know any of them if you saw them again?"</p>
<p>"Wad I ken the leddies I saw lang syne? Oo aye."</p>
<p>"Have you ever seen this lady before?" Humphry took the photograph of his
mother from his inner breast-pocket and placed it before the astonished old
shepherd.</p>
<p>Mr. Angus McPhee took the photograph into his own hands, and it would be
understating the fact to say that he examined it carefully. He looked at it
first with one eye closed and then with the other. He scrutinised it at
arm's-length, and he peered into it at three inches from his face. He
criticised it right side up and upside down. He even turned it over and
examined the photographer's name on the back.</p>
<p>Humphry watched him with painful intentness. "Well, McPhee, have you ever
seen that lady or not?"</p>
<p>"A winna gae sae far as tae say that A hae seen the bonnie leddy&mdash;an' A
canna say for a fact that A hae not seen her," remarked Mr. McPhee cautiously.
"Its verra posseeble, ye ken, that A hae seen her, an then again it's mair than
likely that A hae not. But A can say this much&mdash;that A dinna remember to
hae seen the leddy at Mindaroona, and sence she is such a bonnie leddy hersel'
A thenk A shud hae remembered her. At ony rate it's mair than posseeble."</p>
<p>Humphry stamped his heel into the ground with chagrin. Was it for this that
he had come so far? The evidence, however&mdash;if it could be called
evidence&mdash;was negative as far as it went. Old McPhee did not remember to
have seen the lady, and it was hardly likely that he would have forgotten her
if he had seen her. It would be unsafe to take it for granted that Mrs.
Robertson, as she had called herself, never arrived at Mindaroona, but if she
did arrive there she must have come secretly and left hurriedly. She might
easily have arrived without Angus McPhee being made aware of the fact, and as
for her departure&mdash;Humphry would not allow himself to formulate his
suspicions except so far as to suggest that it might have been very much to the
interest of some third party that Mrs. Robertson's departure from Mindaroona
should be unseen by any person.</p>
<p>"Wull ye tak the dogs wi' ye same as usual, goin' back, Mesther Harold?
Likely ye'll see a kangaroo or two when ye're ridin' through the Bush."</p>
<p>The old man's voice broke in upon Humphry's ruminations and caused him to
look up. He was not much in the mood for kangarooing, but it was necessary to
keep up the deception.</p>
<p>If Harold usually took the dogs, he would take them too.</p>
<p>"All right, McPhee; better whistle them up."</p>
<p>The shepherd gave a long whistle and the two big kangaroo-dogs, with the
collie close in their wake, came tearing out of a patch of timber and raced up
to McPhee.</p>
<p>"The wind is easterly to-day, isn't it, McPhee?" said Humphry, letting his
gaze go eastwards to the blue glitter of the ocean where the smoke from a
couple of coasters could be seen far out on the horizon.</p>
<p>"Ay, ay," said the shepherd. "Ye can see the waves breakin' abune the Walrus
Rock frae the top o' the hill. Yer auld father wad say tae me mony a time,
'Angus,' he wad say, 'the Government shud pit a bit licht-hoose on the cliff or
there'll be a wrack oot there some black nicht, for the Walrus Rock is terrible
dangerous in an easterly gale.'"</p>
<p>"Is it?"</p>
<p>"Ay indeed! It's richt across the mouth o' Blackfish Bay, ye ken. When I cam
here lang syne Blackfish Bay was the port for Mindaroona an' had a wee bit
jetty of its ain. Ye can see wha's left of it at low tide still. But there was
ony a puir trade for the boats, an' they gied up callin' and the jetty sune
fell tae pieces."</p>
<p>The old man maundered on, but Humphry's thoughts were far away.</p>
<p>"We'll hae the equeenoctial gales next month, forbye," continued McPhee,
"an' when they comes they amaist blaws ma wee bit hoose inside oot. But ye'll
be gangin' yer ways the noo, an' Tinker an' Sailor 'll gae wi' ye, for I seen
scrub wallaby dune by the creek a week syne an' mayhap ye'll pit up a 'roo as
well."</p>
<p>Humphry swung himself into the big stock-saddle with its great knee-pads,
and Wallaroo moved off at a walk, followed by Sailor and Tinker, the brindled
and black kangaroo-dogs. As the rider gathered up the bridle the horse broke
into his long easy canter across the open ground, but Humphry pulled him into a
walk again as they entered the belt of light timber on the lower slope of Black
Mountain.</p>
<p>Sailor and Tinker were cruising in front. Half greyhound and half deerhound,
they were the true breed for kangarooing, and, hunting altogether by sight and
not by scent, they developed extraordinary keenness of vision as well as speed
and activity in closely timbered country.</p>
<p>Humphry was sitting loosely in the saddle brooding, with the habit which had
become a second nature with him, upon the chances of ever finding out what had
happened to his mother and who his father was, when the big chestnut gave a
bound that shifted the rider on to his neck and started forward at breakneck
speed through the timber.</p>
<p>As Humphry clambered back into the saddle he realised that the horse had
jumped a huge log and with his ears cocked was galloping in the wake of two
flying forms, one brindled and one black, nearly a hundred yards in front.
Humphry could not see the quarry, but he guessed that Sailor and Tinker had
sighted a 'roo, and judging by the pace that they were making, they would soon
be on top of him.</p>
<p>Clenching his teeth and taking a good grip with his knees, Humphry gave old
Wallaroo his head, and that experienced animal took full charge of the
hunt.</p>
<p>Away in front the black and brindled dogs seemed at times to be flying, as
they leaped fallen trees and rose over patches of light scrub fully six feet
high.</p>
<p>The big chestnut was wonderfully active, dodging the timber without any
apparent lessening of pace, turning and twisting like a hare, and judging his
distances marvellously. Now and then he would buck over a log that the rider
did not even see and squeeze between two trees where it seemed hopeless to make
a passage.</p>
<p>Once Humphry ducked just in time to escape a branch that would certainly
have split his skull if it had collided with it, and several times the big
knee-pads saved his legs from blows that would have crippled him.</p>
<p>After a mile of this desperate stern-chasing in the timber the hunt emerged
into open country, and at last Humphry saw the great grey shape of a regular
'old man' 'roo just in front of the dogs. They had skilfully headed the
creature away from cover and now had it at their mercy in an open paddock.</p>
<p>Wallaroo was going great guns and pulling like a steam-engine. Humphry had
forgotten all his troubles, and was thoroughly absorbed in the primitive
excitement of the hunt.</p>
<p>A big post-and-rail fence bounded the paddock next to the thick timber, and
Humphry saw the 'roo fly it only a few yards in front of the dogs. But the
creature was almost done. It had travelled over two miles at a fast pace, and
it evidently realised that it must be overhauled in a few strides more.
Suddenly it halted, with its back against a solitary ring-barked gum, and sat
up to make its last fight.</p>
<p>Tinker, the black dog, attacking in front, made a leap for the throat, but
missed his grip, and fell back howling with a long red wound from the murderous
hind foot that ripped him from neck to flank.</p>
<p>But the brindled dog was an older hand at the game. He hurled himself at the
kangaroo, taking the creature sideways, and toppled him over. Next instant he
had him by the throat, and the silver-grey vest was stained with scarlet.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that the big chestnut approached the four-railer,
going like a railway train, but neither horse nor man saw the top wire
stretched a foot above the highest rail.</p>
<p>Both the kangaroo and the dogs had jumped it clean.</p>
<p>Humphry gave the chestnut his head and took a good grip with his knees. The
horse was going at racing pace.</p>
<p>Ping!</p>
<p>That was the last sound that Humphry heard as the chestnut turned over.</p>
<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>How pleasant it was to be paddling with his little bucket and spade on the
St. Kilda beach near Hegarty's baths. He would certainly take that big
jelly-fish home in his bucket and show it to mother.</p>
<p>There! He was glad to be in knicker-bockers at last, instead of being
dressed like a little girl, and Tommy Parsons next door was a jolly nice
friend. His games of pirates, bushrangers, and Indians were just the thing. If
he could only have a sword and a pistol! He would ask mother to get them for
him next time she went into Collins Street by the old bus that went along the
dusty St. Kilda road.</p>
<p>Speech-day at the Melbourne Grammar School. And he had got two prizes. But,
better still, he had got into the second for his bowling and had made
twenty-three against Wesley second, besides getting five wickets for
thirty-two. Wouldn't mother be pleased about his prizes!</p>
<p>But where was his mother? He had lost her. He was looking for her
everywhere. How could a person have two mothers? And why was that policeman
asking for him at the door?</p>
<p>Something wrong at the bank. Why did his mother think it best for him to go
away? He had done nothing wrong. What! She wasn't his mother at all. She had
only adopted him. His real mother had disappeared, and nobody knew what had
happened to her. Well, he would find her somehow.</p>
<p>Surely she could not be there, on top of the blast furnace, where it was
snowing. How terrifying those coloured flames were as they leaped up flickering
and twisting into the black night. And how strange the falling snowflakes
looked when the light fell on them.</p>
<p>Snowflakes falling, falling, falling. Red flames rising, rising, rising.</p>
<p>Ha! He must get out of this terrible place. He was sliding, sliding, sliding
into a sea of fire. But he must never let go his grip of that man's
collar&mdash;never, even if his companion dragged him down into the molten
hell.</p>
<p>God! The very ground that he lay on was sinking&mdash;into the furnace. The
pillar of fire already scorched his hair&mdash;and blinded him. He could see no
more. But still he must grip the collar of the inanimate thing beside him.</p>
<p>Was that his guardian angel&mdash;that mysterious figure&mdash;gigantic,
cloaked, and helmeted? No. It was Sergeant Box, and they were saved! Life
opened before him again&mdash;life and time instead of death and eternity. Life
to continue the search and time to find the woman whom he sought.</p>
<p>Where should he seek her first? On the lands of that other woman who had
taken away her son. He would carry the pursuit to the very ends of the
earth.</p>
<p>How well the chestnut galloped! How actively he turned and twisted and how
brilliantly he jumped! Only one more fence.</p>
<p>Ping!</p>
<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>"Are you better now?"</p>
<p>Humphry opened his eyes and found himself looking into the pale and serious
face of a girl whom he had seen only once before in his life, and that was when
she rode past the boundary-rider's hut with Leonie Linton and Harold a few days
earlier. But though he had seen her only once, her likeness had printed itself
on his memory as ineffaceably as the picture that is printed on a photographic
plate by one brief instant's exposure to the sunlight.</p>
<p>"What has happened?" whispered Humphry, gazing up at clear grey eyes that
looked down at him from under a coronet of golden-brown hair.</p>
<p>"Hush," said the girl. "You have had a fall. I was riding past and I found
you lying on the ground. You will soon be all right. You were only
stunned."</p>
<p>Humphry's head was lying in the girl's lap. She was sitting on the ground in
her riding-habit, and there was a grey pony cropping the grass beside old
Wallaroo, who was little the worse for his tumble. He had turned a
half-somersault, falling on his back, as the condition of the big stock-saddle
showed. The cross-tree in front was completely crushed, both knee-pads were
broken, and the leather seat was split right across.</p>
<p>"You had a narrow escape," said the girl. "I was afraid at first that you
were dead. However, I felt your heart and found that it was beating, so I went
to the creek, soaked my handkerchief with water, and gave you a good douche.
You soon came round."</p>
<p>"Thank you ever so much," said Humphry. "You probably saved my life. I saw
you yesterday with Miss Linton, and now won't you tell me who you are?"</p>
<p>The girl gave a start and looked hard at Humphry. "My name is Marion
Bingham," she said, "and I am staying at Yarralla, on a visit with the Lintons.
When I saw you at first, stretched out on the ground, I thought you were Harold
Hesseltine; but now, looking at you closely, I can see that I was mistaken. But
the likeness is truly extraordinary."</p>
<p>The girl was puzzled and excited, and as she looked at the darkly handsome
face and curling hair of the man who sat beside her, a sudden wave of emotion
sent a rich flush of colour to cheek and neck.</p>
<p>"Won't you tell me who you are?" she said.</p>
<p>And Humphry answered simply, "I am the new boundary-rider."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X. THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF MARION</h2>
<p>The law of gravitation which Newton discovered is still seriously
misunderstood, even by many people who consider themselves well educated. They
are aware that they cannot throw a stone at a dog without bringing into
operation the great principle that the brain of Newton discerned as holding the
universe together, but they fail to understand that when two bodies of opposite
sexes, but of similar tastes and likings, approach each other's orbits they are
predestined to gravitate towards each other&mdash;unless some other body
exercises a stronger counter-attraction upon either of them&mdash;just as
surely as two and two make four.</p>
<p>It was in accordance with this general principle that the major continued to
haunt the front verandah of the Mindaroona homestead, where Mrs. Hesseltine
spent much of her time and a portion of her superabundant energy in doing quite
unnecessary fancy work.</p>
<p>It was also in obedience to this great law that Finegan, who figured
officially as assistant bookkeeper at Caringal, drifted across with increasing
frequency to Mindaroona, where Jeanie McPherson still presided over the weekly
wash.</p>
<p>The same harmonious law of nature caused Harold and Leonie to ride together
on spring mornings through the wide paddocks, so that Harold could forget for a
time the secret mystery of his birth and Leonie could banish from her mind the
uneasiness which had been created by her lover's evident preoccupation.</p>
<p>And finally the splendid generalisation of the philosopher explained with
scientific accuracy the frequent morning rides which Marion Bingham took in the
direction of the new boundary-rider's hut.</p>
<p>Pomologists may note as a singular coincidence that the apple has played an
astonishingly important part in influencing human destiny.</p>
<p>It was through looking at an apple that Eve deprived humanity of the joys of
a perpetual horticultural existence.</p>
<p>It was also through looking at an apple that Newton discovered the law which
holds the planets in their places&mdash;and which caused this conjunction of
different pairs of people at Mindaroona, Yarralla, and Caringal.</p>
<p>While Leonie was out riding with Harold, Marion was thrown a great deal upon
her own resources, for Mrs. Linton seldom went far from the house, and found
sufficient exercise in talking. She was a shrewd matron, and very observant, in
spite of her chronic ill-health.</p>
<p>"My dear Marion," she said, in answer to some commiserating observations,
"while Nature has given me a wretchedly weak back she has developed my tongue
in compensation. As you have only lately left Madame Nichette's, I suppose you
haven't yet forgotten Cuvier's law of correlation. When the horse lost his toes
he acquired additional molars, you know. And the huge development of the lower
jaw of the ape has been replaced in man by an enlargement of the brain-case.
That's how it is, no doubt, that my organs of speech have become so vigorous.
It was at the expense of my poor back. Now run along, dear, and try to amuse
yourself till lunch-time."</p>
<p>So Marion went off for a solitary ride, and quite unconsciously, no doubt,
took the track towards the boundary fence between Yarralla and Mindaroona. In
the angle on the Mindaroona side was the boundary-rider's hut.</p>
<p>Humphry was sitting on a stump near his hut mending the stock-saddle that
came to grief when the chestnut turned over. When he saw the girl on the grey
pony, he let down the slip panel quickly, and welcomed his visitor with a
bright smile.</p>
<p>"I hope you won't think me an intruder," said the girl, "but I have come to
see how you are after that terrible crumpler near the creek."</p>
<p>She looked him straight in the eyes with her clear level gaze, and he
experienced a new thrill of satisfaction as he realised the strength and
sincerity of the girl's nature. Here were no wiles and subterfuges of
sophisticated femininity. Fearless, straight-forward, and direct, Marion
Bingham stood before him like a young Diana.</p>
<p>"Thank you ever so much for coming, Miss Bingham. I'm feeling splendid.
Won't you get off the pony for a few minutes?"</p>
<p>The girl slipped easily from the saddle, hung the bridle over a fence-post,
and sat down on the log. "Please don't think me rude," she said, "but you
haven't even told me your name yet. Won't you tell it to me?"</p>
<p>"I am called Humphry Robertson," said the young man.</p>
<p>The girl was plainly puzzled. "But surely you must be related to Mr. Harold
Hesseltine," said Marion, with those clear grey eyes searching his own with a
serene confidence that made equivocation on his part impossible.</p>
<p>"It's a strange story, Miss Bingham, but you have done so much for me
already that I feel I ought to tell you. If it hadn't been for your kindly aid
I should probably have had a bad time out there by the creek."</p>
<p>Marion Bingham laid her hand lightly on the boundary-rider's arm. "Mr.
Robertson," she said, "please don't think that I want to pry into your private
affairs. I have no such desire, I assure you. But my dearest girl-friend, Miss
Linton, is engaged to Harold Hesseltine, and you are so astonishingly like him
that you might easily be&mdash;what shall I say?&mdash;his twin brother."</p>
<p>And then he told her.</p>
<p>Marion listened with wide-eyed interest to the bare recital of unvarnished
facts. "Please believe that I am truly sorry for you, Mr. Robertson," she said,
"but I feel certain that your search will be successful. Something in your face
tells me that you will go on until you find her. Of course, I knew at once that
you were not an ordinary boundary-rider." And then she added, with naive and
charming seriousness, "I am very glad indeed that I have met you. I should like
you to understand how deeply I sympathise with you."</p>
<p>"Miss Bingham," said Humphry quietly, "you don't know how much you have done
for me by giving me your friendship. I am sure it is not necessary to ask you
to keep silence about all that I have told you, so I will merely say that if my
identity and my presence here were guessed it would spoil everything. If Mrs.
Hesseltine or Major McLean, or even Miss Linton, were to see me, it would be
fatal to the success of the inquiries which I am trying to make here among the
old servants of Mr. Hesseltine concerning the events that followed Mrs.
Hesseltine's return from Melbourne with that baby who was my brother
Harold."</p>
<p>"But how have you escaped being discovered already?" asked Marion
wonderingly.</p>
<p>"Every one who sees me takes me for Harold," said Humphry, "but I dare not
risk a meeting with Mrs. Hesseltine or the major. Either of them would be sure
to detect the difference between us. So I will ask you not to say anything to
anybody about me, not even to Miss Linton, until I have found my
mother&mdash;alive or dead."</p>
<p>Marion Bingham held out her hand with a sudden impulse. "You have my
promise," she said, "as well as my sympathy."</p>
<p>Humphry took the offered hand and pressed it in silence.</p>
<p>"And you must let me ride over and see you quite often," said Marion, "for
you have made me almost as anxious as you are yourself to penetrate the
mystery. I am anxious for Harold's sake&mdash;and for Leonie's, as well as for
yours. And now, goodbye."</p>
<p>She mounted the grey pony and cantered off towards Yarralla, while Humphry
watched her with his hand shading his eyes from the midday glare.</p>
<p>But as Marion cantered away from the hut she carried in her heart a new
feeling of interest for the man who had trusted her with his strange secret.
She realised that she now had the grave responsibility of guarding Humphry's
confidence and keeping it even from the knowledge of Leonie, with whom she had
hitherto shared her inmost thoughts.</p>
<p>With her high ideals of life and her steadfast resolution to seek her own
happiness by achieving happiness for others, Marion's feeling for pretty
pleasure-loving, easily influenced Leonie was almost maternal. She wished above
all things to see Leonie really happy. Thus she had encouraged Leonie to talk
freely to her about Harold, and had listened with indulgent interest to all the
details of Harold's wooing. Leonie had told her about her lover's preoccupation
and strange silences ever since that afternoon in the ironworks at
Shaleville.</p>
<p>And Leonie was evidently seriously put out about it.</p>
<p>"Of course, you can't understand how I feel about it, Marion," Leonie had
said, "because you are so strong and self-contained. And you have never been in
love yourself."</p>
<p>Was that careless remark still true? Marion asked herself. There was a new
light in her eyes as she cantered back to Yarralla. But she felt genuinely
grieved that she was pledged to say nothing to Leonie about the boundary-rider
who was Harold's brother. Concerning this new and splendid thing that had come
into her life she was bound to maintain strict silence.</p>
<p>It was the first time during her long friendship with Leonie that she had
kept a single secret from her.</p>
<p>A mile from the homestead Marion met Harold and Leonie riding side by
side.</p>
<p>Leonie called to her affectionately: "Come along, Marion, we have been
looking for you everywhere," and as Marion rode up she whispered to her,
"Harold is so silent and moody, dear, that I'm thankful you've come. I cannot
think what has come over him. He's not a bit loving to-day, and I simply must
be loved. I can't live without it. Why, I lost him this morning for more than
half an hour, and goodness knows where he got to. He doesn't seem to know
himself."</p>
<p>Marion gave her an affectionate smile. "You needn't be a bit alarmed, dear,"
she said. "Nobody could leave off loving you, if they tried. Could they,
Harold?"</p>
<p>"Of course not," said Harold, emerging for a moment from introspective
gloom. "And certainly I am not going to try, Leonie, so you needn't expect it."
His face wore a sunny smile again, even if it was an evanescent one.</p>
<p>"Why, you dear old thing, you'll make me positively jealous," said Leonie,
pulling her cob alongside Marion's grey pony. "Directly you join us Harold
forgets his secret sorrows&mdash;I'm sure he must have some secret sorrows, by
the way that he behaves&mdash;and gets quite bright again." The gay little
butterfly flitted on and on&mdash;fluttering her wings over hidden fires. Life
had dealt very kindly with Leonie until lately, when some mysterious shadow had
come between her and her lover.</p>
<p>She joked about it. She rallied him upon his moodiness and preoccupation,
but the thought of it came back to her like a grisly visitant in the night
watches. What was the cause of Harold's changed manner? She felt in her soul
that he was not giving her his confidence, and the depths beneath her
superficial gaiety were troubled.</p>
<p>The same night, when the two girls were preparing for bed in the big double
bedroom which they shared at Yarralla, Leonie became inquisitive.</p>
<p>"Where did you ride to this morning, dear?"</p>
<p>The question came like a shot out of a gun, and Marion, startled out of her
day-dreaming, could only stammer: "Just across the paddocks to the boundary
fence."</p>
<p>The big double bedroom at Yarralla contained two beds, each hung with snowy
mosquito curtains. It also contained two dressing-tables and one large double
wardrobe with looking-glass doors. It is necessary that the position of these
various articles of furniture should be stated in order that it may be
understood how it was that Leonie Linton found out that Marion Bingham, whom
she had always regarded as the soul of honour, and to whom she had given all
her confidence, was deceiving her.</p>
<p>At the end of the left-hand wall, then, as one entered the room was the
door, and against the centre of the same wall was placed Marion's
dressing-table.</p>
<p>Leonie's dressing-table stood across the angle formed by the right-hand wall
and the lower end-wall. The centre of the upper end-wall was occupied by the
large wardrobe with looking-glass doors.</p>
<p>The effect of this quite fortuitous arrangement was that when the right-hand
door of the wardrobe was left a few inches open a person sitting in front of
Leonie's dressing-table could see a person sitting in front of Marion's
dressing-table reflected in profile in the slightly opened looking-glass door
of the wardrobe, although the two persons were at the time sitting almost back
to back.</p>
<p>This was the position when Leonie, in night-gown and dainty be-ribboned
wrapper, sat in front of her own dressing-table doing her hair preparatory to
retiring for the night, while Marion in a very similar costume was performing
identical rites in front of the other dressing-table.</p>
<p>"I hope you are not being awfully bored by being left by yourself so much,
you poor old dear," resumed Leonie, brushing out her beautiful mane of
gold-shot hair with a sideways sweep of the elaborate silver-backed brush and a
dexterous flick to disengage the ends as she finished each stroke.</p>
<p>"Not a bit," cheerfully said Marion, who was going through the same graceful
process at her side of the room.</p>
<p>"Because I wanted to say such a lot of things to Harold," continued the
daughter of the house sentimentally, "and yet when we were alone together he
was so silent and reserved that I could hardly find anything to say at all.
Isn't it strange?"</p>
<p>Marion expressed the opinion with her lips that it was rather strange, but
in her heart she admitted to herself that the secret which Harold shared with
Humphry concerning their parentage was quite sufficient to make anybody
absent-minded.</p>
<p>"How did the pony carry you, dear?" went on Leonie, who was in a decidedly
talkative mood and always enjoyed this half-hour of chatter over the events of
the day with her particular chum.</p>
<p>"Splendidly!" said Marion with enthusiasm. "He's a perfect little hack, and
I like him because it's so easy to get on him again, you know, after one has
dismounted."</p>
<p>"Oh, so you got off him to-day while you were out, did you, dear?" Leonie
finished the brushing process and began methodically to plait her lovely hair
into two long pigtails.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Marion rather abruptly, "I did."</p>
<p>"What for?" inquired Leonie; "there were no gates to open, were there?"</p>
<p>"No, there were not," said Marion. "I wanted to talk to somebody. By the
way, have you seen the major lately? That strange creature Finegan told me that
the major was dreadfully upset by that Indian hawker who told him his
fortune."</p>
<p>Leonie finished one pigtail and began the other without speaking. This
violent changing of the subject was unlike Marion. Surely there was no need to
make a mystery about her morning ride. "You didn't tell me that you met anybody
when you were out," she said with just a tinge of reproachfulness in her
voice.</p>
<p>"Didn't I?"</p>
<p>"No, you didn't. Who was it?"</p>
<p>"Oh, nobody of any consequence. Let's ride across to the Black Mountain in
the morning, Leonie, and boil a billy at the shepherd's hut. There's a lovely
view of the sea from the top of the hill."</p>
<p>"Marion, I do believe you're keeping something back from me. You seem quite
different to-night."</p>
<p>"Do I, dear?" Marion was busy with her own pigtail now, but her hands were
shaking so that she could hardly make the three-ply plait. She managed,
however, to finish the plait, and it was the second one. With a quick twist or
two she tied up the end of it and both pigtails hung down completed.</p>
<p>Marion pushed back her chair, stood up, and taking her skirt from the foot
of her bed, opened the right-hand looking-glass door of the wardrobe and hung
the skirt on a hook inside.</p>
<p>Then she closed the door.</p>
<p>But she did not close it carefully and it swung open again, just a
little&mdash;only about three inches, in fact. Still, like Mercutio's wound, it
would do.</p>
<p>When Marion sat down again in front of her dressing-table to finish doing
her hair, the looking-glass door of the wardrobe stood slightly open, bringing
the plane of the mirror into an angle where it caught the reflection of the
unconscious sitter and projected it upon the reflection of the wardrobe-door
seen in Leonie's dressing-table mirror.</p>
<p>Leonie, as she coiled her own plaits over her head and tied them in a knot
at the back, could see in her own mirror the girl who sat back to back with her
performing exactly the same pretty toilet manoeuvre. Marion's face showed out
with lifelike distinctness.</p>
<p>"Marion dear, you haven't told me yet who it was that you met this
morning."</p>
<p>Marion laughed a little awkwardly. "You shouldn't be so inquisitive,
Leonie," she said; "it's very bad for you."</p>
<p>Leonie elevated her pretty nose ever so little. "Really, Marion," she said,
with just a suspicion of coolness in her voice, "one might think from all this
mystery that you were in love with him."</p>
<p>That was the shot that did the mischief.</p>
<p>A rich deep flush of colour rose in Marion's pale cheek and covered her
face, spreading downwards over the snowy neck and upwards to where the soft
brown hair came to meet the broad and well-shaped forehead.</p>
<p>And Leonie, gazing petrified into her looking-glass, saw the signal hoisted
which showed her that firing at random she had scored a bull's-eye.</p>
<p>"Marion!" The word escaped from her lips almost without her knowledge, as
she turned, crossed the room in a few swift steps, and stared into her friend's
face.</p>
<p>The flush died down as quickly as it came and left Marion paler than
before.</p>
<p>"And you never told me, Marion. You, who have had no secrets from me until
now. What does it mean?"</p>
<p>"You must not ask me, Leonie, for I cannot tell you," said Marion, mistress
of herself again with a mighty effort.</p>
<p>"Not tell me!" said Leonie, in amazement; "won't you tell me what his name
is?"</p>
<p>And Marion, looking at her straight in the eyes with that direct unfaltering
gaze of hers, made answer: "No."</p>
<p>"Oh, very well," said Leonie shortly; "good-night." And without another word
she lifted the mosquito curtains, crept into her bed, and turned her face to
the wall.</p>
<p>"Good-night, Leonie," said Marion quietly. "I'm very sorry that you are
offended, but it's really not my fault."</p>
<p>She put out the lights one by one and crept into her own bed&mdash;but not
to sleep. The incidents of the day had been too exciting, and she had much to
think about.</p>
<p>As for Leonie, that unhappy damsel was even more wakeful than Marion.</p>
<p>One question hammered ceaselessly in her brain.</p>
<p>Where was Harold during the time that he was absent from her on their
morning ride?</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI. A FANCIED TREASON</h2>
<p>Next morning Leonie felt calmer and a little ashamed of her outburst of
temper. It was simply inconceivable that her dark suspicion of the previous
evening could have any foundation. She was engaged to marry Harold, and Marion
was her closest friend. How, then, could there be anything between Marion and
Harold?</p>
<p>No reference was made by either of the girls to the episode of the night
before, and Leonie was determinedly cheerful and cordial. The serene and
fearless frankness of Marion, conscious that she had been guilty of no
treachery to her friend, and quite at a loss to account for Leonie's display of
anger, was unchanged.</p>
<p>Breakfast passed off quite satisfactorily, Mrs. Linton doing most of the
talking, and then the three ladies separated, the elder lady betaking herself
to the morning-room to meet Mr. Grist, the station manager, and hear his report
of the lambing, while the two younger ones busied themselves about the
house.</p>
<p>Leonie was quite amiable again, but still at the bottom of her mind lay the
unsolved puzzle, like an ugly snag fallen into a clear pool. She could not help
wondering why Marion refused to tell her who it was that she met during her
solitary morning ride.</p>
<p>She was looking out of the drawing-room window across the well-grassed
Yarralla paddocks towards the rounded hump of Black Mountain in the distance,
when her ear caught the soft rhythm of cantering hoofs, and, turning her head,
she saw Harold riding his favourite hack, old Hailstorm.</p>
<p>Leonie's face brightened. She waved her handkerchief from the window. Soon
she would be able to see through the mystery. Harold would clear up all her
doubts.</p>
<p>But unhappily Harold did not see the fluttering handkerchief. He made no
answering signal. He rode right up to the gate, slipped off his horse&mdash;and
shook hands with Marion, who had gone out to meet him.</p>
<p>Leonie felt as though an invisible hand had clutched her by the throat.
Furious with rage, she saw Marion talking rapidly and earnestly to Harold. She
saw her place her hand on Harold's arm and walk away with him down the garden,
while Harold listened to her eagerly, and at intervals looked round nervously
to see if any one was watching them.</p>
<p>What could those two be talking about? What secret were they keeping from
her?</p>
<p>Leonie was tormented by jealousy. She picked up a book and tried to read,
but her vagrant thoughts refused to be controlled, and she could not
concentrate her attention on the pages. She could not even sit still in the
chair, but kept feverishly running to the window to see whether her dearest
girl-friend and her affianced lover had yet returned from their conference.</p>
<p>After at least a quarter of an hour of waiting she saw them come back into
view. Marion held out her hand at the gate. Harold grasped it and held it for
several seconds. He seemed to be deeply moved as he listened to what Marion was
saying. At last he lifted Hailstorm's bridle off the hook in the gate-post, and
mounted and rode away.</p>
<p>Not a word for Leonie!</p>
<p>He had ridden over to Yarralla; Marion had intercepted him, and then he had
ridden away. Was there any possible explanation of that conduct&mdash;except
the obvious one?</p>
<p>Leonie sat down and tried to collect her thoughts, but she was like a person
stunned by a sudden blow. Gradually her single impulse reasserted itself. She
would go and find Marion. She would speak to her calmly but firmly&mdash;oh
yes, very calmly. There must be some simple explanation of all that she had
seen, and Marion, of course, would give it to her.</p>
<p>Stirred to the unknown deeps that lie beneath even the shallowest feminine
soul when the primeval mating instinct is insulted and outraged, Leonie ran out
of the house to look for Marion.</p>
<p>But Marion was not there, and the grey pony's stall was empty in the
stable.</p>
<p>Larry, the rouseabout, who was smoking a short clay pipe while he washed a
buggy, was able to supply some useful information, though it took him some time
to do it.</p>
<p>"Arrah, Miss Leonie, shure 'tis only a few minnits agone since Miss Marion
she come up to me in a therrible hurry, and she sez, 'Larry,' sez she, 'I want
ye to saddle the powny for me at wanst,' sez she, ''cause 'tis a matther uv
importhance,' sez she, 'an' I can't be waitin',' sez she."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. Go on, go on!"</p>
<p>"An' I sez to her, 'Miss Marion,' sez I, 'shure 'tis yerself is the rale
lady,' sez I, 'an' let alone put the saddle on the powny for ye,' sez I, 'shure
I'd walk to the great cross uv Croagh Patrick on me knees an' back for ye,' sez
I, 'if ye axed me,' sez I, and wid that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>
<p>"Stop, stop, Larry, for Heaven's sake! Tell me where she went."</p>
<p>"An' wid that I put the ould saddle on the powny, Miss Leonie, because the
new wan'll be givin' him a sore back be rason uv Miss Marion settin' too much
over on the near side, an' I buckled them girts as tight as I cud, Miss Leonie,
bekase that grey powny is as cunnin' as the divil, savin' yer presince, miss,
an' he do be blowin' himsilf out whin I puts the girts round him, so as it's
harrd wurruk to fix him at all, at all. So I just buckles thim girts as tight
as I can, miss, and then in a minnit or two, whin he ain't thinkin' about it, I
buckles thim a bit tighter."</p>
<p>"Well, well! which way did she go?"</p>
<p>"Shure I lifted her into the saddle, miss, an' she put her fut in the palm
uv me hand an' wint up as aisy as a burrd, God bless her! and then she sez to
me, 'Larry,' sez she&mdash;&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Larry, you'll drive me mad! Which track did she take?" Leonie stamped her
pretty foot, and the flood of Larry's loquacity was stayed.</p>
<p>"She tuk the thrack to Mindaroona, miss," said Larry, a trifle sulkily. He
enjoyed hearing himself talk, and disliked to be rudely interrupted. "She axed
me how fur it is to the boundary-rider's hut, an' I tould her 'twas a matther
uv five miles."</p>
<p>Leonie was already leading out her own horse, Tim, who stood in his stall
already saddled. Larry held his horny palm for her foot, and she dropped into
the saddle with practised ease.</p>
<p>"The saints presarve us!" ejaculated Larry as he looked with eyes shaded by
levelled palm at a light cloud of dust travelling swiftly along the track to
Mindaroona. "If Tim puts his fut in a crab-hole goin' at that pace, shure he'll
t'row Miss Leonie from here inter Queensland."</p>
<p>But Tim knew enough to keep out of crab-holes, and with a light weight in
the saddle he thoroughly enjoyed a fast gallop.</p>
<p>As Leonie topped the last rise and came in sight of the dividing fence
between Yarralla and Mindaroona she saw the grey pony tied up to the fence near
the boundary-rider's hut on the Mindaroona side. But there was no sign of
Marion.</p>
<p>She pulled Tim into a trot, and making a wide turn, steered for a slip panel
half a mile away from the hut. Passing into the Mindaroona paddock, she rode up
the gently rising slope in a half circle that brought her to within a hundred
yards of the back of the boundary-rider's home. There she slipped down from her
saddle and tied Tim to a tree.</p>
<p>Gathering up her riding-skirt, she walked quickly and resolutely towards the
hut. There were no signs of any human occupants, but the grey pony tied to a
fence-post was conclusive proof that Marion was not far away.</p>
<p>Leonie clenched her teeth. So frank, fearless Marion, with her high ideals
of life, her desire to find happiness by helping others to be happy, and her
disinterested devotion to her school friend of earlier days, was in that
hut.</p>
<p>Presumably she was not alone there. Leonie's breathing quickened and her
heart beat faster as her thoughts framed the unspoken question: "Who was in the
boundary-rider's hut with Marion?"</p>
<p>With all her lighthearted gaiety that merged at times into sheer frivolity,
Leonie was an honourable girl to whom eavesdropping in her normal mood was as
repugnant as any other kind of treachery. If any one had told her twenty-four
hours earlier that she would act the part of a spy, and especially of a spy
upon the actions of Marion, she would have repelled the statement with bitter
indignation.</p>
<p>Yet here she was&mdash;creeping through the light scrub that stood behind
the boundary-rider's hut, with one idea in her head and only one, namely, to
see with her own eyes who it was that her frank and open-hearted friend, who
had never before had any secrets from her, went to meet in this surreptitious
way.</p>
<p>A woman deceived in her love is a woman transformed. The girl who made her
way noiselessly and bending low through the young saplings and the patches of
lantana was not the real Leonie, joyous, gay, and happy, but a frenzied
'double' with close-pressed lips and staring eyes, intent only on unmasking a
deceiver.</p>
<p>She was certain that she would find Marion in the hut, but she hardly dared
to think who was Marion's companion&mdash;if she had one.</p>
<p>Coming within the last twenty yards of the hut, Leonie dropped on her hands
and knees and crawled through the long grass lest the occupants of the hut,
whoever they were, should see her through the little square window cut in the
centre of the wall.</p>
<p>Then she heard voices, and held her breath to listen. She was quite close up
to the wall now. It was Marion who was speaking.</p>
<p>"Leonie must not know," said the voice of Marion inside the hut, "it would
be such a terrible shock to her to find that the man she loves is not what he
seems to be."</p>
<p>And then another voice, a man's voice with a strangely familiar intonation,
said: "Poor little Leonie! I can't help feeling sorry for her. We must keep it
from her at all costs, not only for her sake, but for ours."</p>
<p>The girl listening outside amid the long grass and the undergrowth caught at
her heart with a sudden spasm of pain. She had never imagined that such
treachery as this could exist on earth.</p>
<p>"She seemed to suspect something last night," said the voice of Marion
again. "She asked me who it was that I had met in the morning when I was out
riding."</p>
<p>"And what did you tell her?" said the man's voice anxiously.</p>
<p>"I refused to tell her anything at all," said Marion's voice, "because I
would not tell her an untruth and I could not tell her that it was you."</p>
<p>Leonie crawled a few paces nearer to the hut through the brushwood and the
tall stems of grass. She behaved like a person who is hypnotised. She advanced
as though under the compulsion of some hidden and mysterious force.</p>
<p>With restless gaze she hastily examined the end wall of the hut, and soon
she found what she was looking for&mdash;a knot-hole in the timber. It was a
couple of feet above the level of the ground and commanded the whole interior
of the little structure.</p>
<p>Placing her right eye to the knot-hole, Leonie, who was still on her hands
and knees, peeped into the hut.</p>
<p>A rough bunk covered with a blue blanket, two wooden chairs and a small
table, a few pictures of racehorses cut from illustrated papers and pasted on
the wall&mdash;that was all there was in the way of furniture and
decoration.</p>
<p>A man and a woman were sitting on the two chairs close to each other. The
woman was Marion, but the watcher outside could not see the man's face. It was
turned away from her. She saw that he was dressed in coat and trousers of rough
tweed, and that he wore leggings and spurs.</p>
<p>The man was holding Marion's hand in his, and as she noted his slim figure a
horrible conviction grew in the mind of the eavesdropper.</p>
<p>"You are right," he said, "Leonie must never know."</p>
<p>As he uttered the words he turned half way round in the chair and Leonie saw
his features&mdash;the features of Harold, the man to whom she was
betrothed!</p>
<p>She neither screamed nor sobbed. No cry of pain escaped her, but her face
was deathly white as she staggered back to the tree where she had left her
horse. Leading Tim to a stump, she mounted him like a woman in a dream, and Tim
carried her safely home.</p>
<p>But when Marion returned she was met by Larry, the rouseabout, with serious
news. "She wint out on Tim here to find ye, miss, an' be this an' be that whin
she come home agin an hour agone she looked for all the wurruld like a shtone
image, an' the eyes uv her shtarin' shtraight t'roo me, as if I wuz a bit uv
windy-glass, an' the tongue uv her sayin' divil a wurrud. But she slid down off
the harrse an' she wint inter the house like as if she wuz walkin' in her
shlape. The saints presarve us, miss! fwat did ye be doin' to poor Miss Leonie
at all at all?"</p>
<p>But Marion did not wait to explain. A chill premonition swept over her, for
with lightning-like intuition she conjectured what had happened. Leonie by some
means or other had seen her in the hut with Humphry, and had mistaken him for
Harold.</p>
<p>Marion flew to the house and met Mrs. Linton in the doorway. The elder lady
was shaken for once out of her self-possession. She clutched Marion fiercely by
the arm. "What have you been doing to my child?" she said. And then both women
paused and looked at each other with horror-stricken eyes, for a dreadful
moaning came to them from the drawing-room, where stretched on the sofa lay
poor Leonie 'a-babbling o' green fields.</p>
<p>The doctor who came out from Shaleville the same afternoon shook his head
ominously. "It's brain," he said; "the poor child must have had a shock of some
kind."</p>
<p>So Marion was installed as nurse and the horror of a great fear came down
upon Yarralla.</p>
<p>But Humphry when he heard of it took a hopeful view. "It all hangs together
as part of the same trouble," he said to Harold, who had ridden out to him for
comfort in his grief and fear. "It seems as though the unquiet spirit of our
mother is still at work. When I find her, as surely I shall, then every
perplexity will be cleared up and you will get your Leonie back safe and sound
again."</p>
<p>Harold shook his head sorrowfully. It was a forlorn hope.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII. THE WRECK AT BLACKFISH BAY</h2>
<p>"Oh, stop yer haverin', mon, for A hae ma claes to pit oot on the line an'
the win's blowin' them down as fast as A can pit them oot."</p>
<p>Jeanie McPherson was wrestling heroically with her wash, and it in no way
assisted her to have the society of Tim Finegan during the process, especially
as Finegan persisted in putting his arm round her waist at the precise moment
when she was unable to protect herself.</p>
<p>When a sonsie lassie is holding down a wire clothes-line with one hand and
affixing a newly washed undergarment to it by means of wooden pegs with the
other, and when, moreover, she is obliged to stand on tiptoe in order to reach
the line, how can she prevent an active and enterprising fellow from snatching
a hurried embrace?</p>
<p>Jeanie found it impossible. But she could at least make reprisals, as
Finegan found when he received a ringing box on the ear from the exasperated
damsel.</p>
<p>"Hae done wi' yer fulin'," snapped Jeanie; "canna ye see that the win's
rising an' a' the claes will be ower the fence if A canna get them pinned doun
richt sune."</p>
<p>And indeed the drying-ground was already whitened as though with newly
fallen snow. Garments of divers shapes were whirled about by the advance gusts
of the coming storm, and Jeanie in hot pursuit darted hither and thither after
them, intent on anchoring them securely before worse things happened.</p>
<p>Finegan lent a hand, and his assistance, though awkward, was timely, so that
Jeanie surveyed the situation with the satisfaction of a skipper who sees, when
the barometer is tumbling fast and the gale to windward is rapidly approaching,
that his royals and t'gallants'ls are down and his upper tops'ls
double-reefed.</p>
<p>It took more than an insincere box on the ears to stop Finegan when he was
on a combined mission of courtship and investigation.</p>
<p>He proceeded with his cross-examination pertinaciously.</p>
<p>"How has Mr. Harold been spending his time lately, Jeanie?"</p>
<p>"A dinna ken, A'm sure," replied the damsel; "but the puir laddie's amaist
daft wi' the trouble up at Yarralla. I heard the mestress tellin' the major
that puir Miss Leonie raves awfu' aboot Mesther Harold. She lees there a' day
lang movin' her han's restless-like on the counterpin an' sayin' naethin' but
'He's broke ma hairt! He's broke ma hairt!'"</p>
<p>Poor Jeanie was quite affected, and she dashed a tear or two hastily from
her eyes.</p>
<p>Finegan was interested in Leonie's illness merely as a side issue. It was
evidently connected in some way with the association between Harold and
Humphry, but the inquiry agent sheered off instinctively to more solid
ground.</p>
<p>"Do you know what Mr. Harold has been doing, Jeanie? Where has he been and
who has he seen?"</p>
<p>"Angus McPhee was in last nicht," said Jeanie with an air of mystery. "Him
and me is frae the same toun, ye ken."</p>
<p>"Well, what did he tell you?"</p>
<p>"A daurna say."</p>
<p>"Oh, come along now, Jeanie! I really want to know."</p>
<p>"Weel, tak yer airm frae roun' ma waist first. There, that's better noo.
Weel, Angus McPhee tellt me that Mesther Harold rode ower the Black Mountain to
see him last Thursday."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>"An' stayed there haverin' wi' him for best pairt of an oor."</p>
<p>"Um. What did he want to know?"</p>
<p>"Mesther McPhee tellt me that Mesther Harold showed him a photygraf."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. Who was it?"</p>
<p>"'Twas a photygraf of a wumman."</p>
<p>"What sort of a woman, Jeanie? What did she look like?" Finegan felt that he
was on a trail of some sort. He, too, was looking for traces of a woman.</p>
<p>"Angus tellt me 'twas a verra bonnie leddy. Mesther Harold was speirin'
aboot the leddy. He asked Angus did he remember ever seein' her at
Mindaroona."</p>
<p>Here was mystification, indeed, for Finegan.</p>
<p>The lady that Harold was looking for could hardly be the lady that the major
was looking for surely. Who was Harold's lady, anyhow, and why should he expect
that McPhee might remember her? Finegan realised that these were questions that
must be answered.</p>
<p>"Well, Jeanie lass, I'll not keep you from your work any longer this
morning. I must be going back to the store now." Finegan reached for his
hat.</p>
<p>"Gude-bye, Mesther Finegan," said Jeanie, and then she added coyly as an
afterthought: "A didna mean tae hurt ye wi' that bit slap i' the lug."</p>
<p>So she got another embrace and there was no slap after it. "Ye can come
again if ye like the morn's morn," said Jeanie, as Finegan climbed up on the
quiet old stock-horse that had carried him across to Mindaroona from
Caringal.</p>
<p>Finegan set off at a sober jog towards the Black Mountain, purposing to
interview McPhee about that photograph. The wind that had played with Jeanie's
washing had freshened fast and was now blowing hard from the south. Finegan had
a very disagreeable ride to Angus McPhee's camp and he was glad when it was
over.</p>
<p>The old Scotchman was at first very suspicious and disinclined to talk to
the new bookkeeper from Caringal, but under the mollifying influence of a large
plug of tobacco that Finegan presented him with he gradually found his tongue
and described in his own picturesque Doric the visit that he had received from
'Mesther Harold.'</p>
<p>Mr. McPhee, who was great on detail and never forgot anything, even
mentioned the curious fact that Jess, the collie, who had known Harold since
she was a pup, sniffed and growled at him, and persisted in regarding him as a
stranger.</p>
<p>Finegan pricked up his ears at once. Was it possible that it was not Harold
who visited the old man and asked about the photograph but Harold's double, the
young ironworker, who had been conferring with Harold at the 'Miners' Rest,'
and who disappeared after that fearful experience on the top of the blast
furnace? There seemed to be no end to the terrible tangle of possibilities, but
as he sat on the log outside McPhee's hut talking to the old shepherd, Finegan
realised in a flash one of the possibilities, if not even one of the
probabilities.</p>
<p>Harold Hesseltine and Humphry Robertson, alias Scott, who were as like each
other as two new pennies, were working together in order to find traces of a
certain woman. One of them&mdash;he did not know which&mdash;had gone to Angus
McPhee for information and had questioned him about events dating twenty years
back and about an unknown woman's movements at that distant date. Major McLean
was also seeking for information about a woman's movements twenty years ago.
The major's advertisements in the Melbourne papers had produced no result, a
fact which indicated to Mr. Finegan that the persons who could give the
information must have some strong reason for withholding it. Why should they
withhold it&mdash;and thereby lose the reward of fifty pounds&mdash;unless they
feared to get into trouble by giving it? It seemed probable, therefore, that
the missing woman had at least committed some irregularity and that the person
at whose house she stayed in Melbourne was mixed up in it.</p>
<p>Finegan's brain was not particularly acute naturally, but it had had plenty
of practice in dealing with the motives of people who disappeared from their
accustomed haunts. He followed the trail fairly closely for some distance, but
finally fell into the common mistake of forming a theory and trying to make the
facts fit it, instead of ascertaining enough facts first to substitute
deduction for hypothesis.</p>
<p>It seemed to the private inquiry agent that the missing woman had obtained
money from some person by false pretences and that the boarding-house
keeper&mdash;a woman, of course&mdash;had instigated the plan and shared in the
plunder. Hence the disappearance of the principal and the profound silence of
the accessory.</p>
<p>Finegan resolved to place his theory before the major and suggest a trip for
himself to Melbourne in order to hunt up that accessory. He was convinced that
he would be able to find her.</p>
<p>All this passed through his brain as he sat on the log, when a sharp cry
from McPhee made him look up. Whew! it was blowing a hard gale now and the sea
was obscured by frequent squalls.</p>
<p>"Man, man, look at yon steamer!" shouted McPhee through the whistle of the
gale, and facing round to the sea, Finegan made out through the flying drift a
large steamer perilously close inshore.</p>
<p>She was quite out of control and was fast coming in, broadside on, straight
towards the Walrus Rock. At times, lifted high on a big sea, she rolled until
she showed half her keel, and then, diving into a hollow, seemed as though she
could never come up again.</p>
<p>"She's lost her propeller," shouted Finegan to old McPhee. "She'll be on the
rocks in half-an-hour. You had better go down to the beach, McPhee, and see if
you can do anything, while I ride back and stir up the men at Mindaroona,
Caringal, and Yarralla."</p>
<p>The news that a large steamer was in difficulties and likely to go ashore
spread through the district incredibly quickly, and Finegan, when halfway back
to Caringal, met the major with a buggy full of blankets and medical comforts
on his way to the beach.</p>
<p>"Come along, Finegan," shouted the major "no time to lose," and the buggy
was off again at a hand gallop, as Finegan turned the old stock-horse round and
joined in the race.</p>
<p>It was a wild helter-skelter, typically Australian in character, the
stampede of a whole district that may be seen commonly after a country
race-meeting and less frequently at a shipwreck.</p>
<p>Every man, woman, and child who could climb on a horse or squeeze into a
buggy was flying along the wide stock road as if his or her arrival first upon
the scene was essential to the safety of every soul on board the vessel.</p>
<p>Finegan took a good pull at the old stock-horse, but with very little
effect, for the excitement of the chase had come over the veteran and he was
going much faster than the rider liked. The stock-horse tore at the bit and
went even faster as Larry, the rouseabout, with a wild "Hurroo!" went past on
poor Leonie's favourite hack, Tim, flinging lumps of mud from the horse's
flying heels in the face of the luckless inquiry agent.</p>
<p>Every bush hand from the three stations had joined in the rush, and every
cocky from the surrounding district. They bumped, jostled, challenged each
other, and raced towards the sea, while the gale that swept inland from the
coast was laden with spindrift, discordant yells, and clods of earth thrown
back by the galloping hoofs, so that those at the rear of the procession had
anything but an enjoyable time. A white-haired bush parson in his sulky kept
close beside Finegan, evidently determined that if his services were required
they should be available, and the local medical man whizzed past them on his
motor-cycle, conjecturing with plenty of reason that it would be strange if he
could not find a few patients before the day was over.</p>
<p>And then Finegan became aware of a big horse overhauling him fast on the
near side and going with a long easy stride that the old stock-horse, with his
short stiff, proppy action, could not hope to keep pace with. It was Wallaroo,
the chestnut, and to his amazement Finegan saw that the rider was none other
than Humphry Robertson, the missing double of Harold Hesseltine. Finegan knew
by the rider's rough bush clothes that he was not the immaculate young heir of
Mindaroona.</p>
<p>Here was a discovery. But the inquiry agent at once resolved to keep it to
himself. Whoever Robertson might be, at least he had saved Finegan's life at
the imminent peril of his own. Finegan experienced the same creepy chill down
his spine that always returned when he thought of that night above the blast
furnace. In common decency he could not give Humphry Robertson away to the
major, who would certainly insist on probing his mysterious connection with
Harold and his extraordinary resemblance to that young man to the bottom.</p>
<p>The major reached the beach in front of Finegan, and just as he got there a
cry of dismay went up from the spectators gathered on the edge of the little
bay.</p>
<p>The big steamer heaved up her side on a huge roller and came down with a
crash on the Walrus Rock, over which the broken water was foaming.</p>
<p>The major pulled out a pocket telescope and examined her closely. "I can
just make out the name on her bows," he said to the medical motor-cyclist, who
stood beside him. "She's the Goorabinda, of the White Anchor Line, with
passengers and cargo for Queensland ports."</p>
<p>Major McLean rested his telescope on the doctor's shoulder and made a
prolonged examination of the wreck. Walrus Rock was a little more than two
miles from the reefs at the southern end of the bay, and a good three miles
from the sandy beach where the crowd of spectators had gathered, this being the
only spot where the boats could effect a landing.</p>
<p>"She's lying over at a fearful angle to the port side," reported the major,
"and the seas are breaking right over her waist, but she has gone head on to
the reef, and if she doesn't slip off and sink in deep water they ought to be
able to get the boats out."</p>
<p>The people on the sandy beach could see with the naked eye the clouds of
white foam and spray that dashed mast-high over the doomed ship. At times
nothing was visible but the funnel and the two masts as an unusually big sea
swept over her.</p>
<p>"Hullo! they're trying to get the life-boats out on the port side!"
exclaimed the major. "She has such a list to port that it is impossible to
launch the starboard boats. Not many people on board apparently."</p>
<p>Minutes elapsed&mdash;minutes full of extreme tension for the onlookers, who
were powerless to give any assistance. But all at once a cheer rang out,
telling of relief from the pentup anxiety. The crowd had seen a boat
successfully launched.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's all right," said the major excitedly, with his eye glued to the
telescope; "they're pulling away from the ship. I can see another boat being
launched on the port side near the stern, where the ship makes a lee-side for
it. There it goes into the water. By George, nearly over that time! Now then,
the question is whether the two boats can live through such a heavy sea to
reach the shore."</p>
<p>The progress of the boats to the shore was painfully slow, but the people on
the beach occupied the time under the major's direction in building several
large fires of brushwood and driftwood for the benefit of the ship-wrecked
unfortunates.</p>
<p>The major was so busy in superintending this operation that though he had,
as he thought, seen Harold Hesseltine among the crowd he had no time to go and
speak to him. And Humphry, on his side, was careful to keep away from the major
as far as possible.</p>
<p>At last the deeply laden boats drew near to the shore, and as a heavy surf
was rolling in, it needed careful handling to avoid a catastrophe even at the
eleventh hour. But the mate, who was in charge of the first boat, knew his job,
and so did the men at the oars. "Now, lads, give way!" shouted the mate, and as
the men bent to their work the boat shot forward fairly on the crest of a
gigantic roller that carried her forward with the speed of a railway train and
ran her along until the bow touched the sand. Before the backwash could get
hold of her a dozen of the stalwart fellows on the beach, including Humphry,
had rushed into the water and dragged the boat well up into security.</p>
<p>Drenched and chilled, but happy to have escaped with their lives, the
passengers, among whom were several women, and the sailors and firemen, who
were exhausted with rowing, joined the onlookers on the beach in watching with
breathless anxiety the landing of the captain's boat. The second boat was not
so fortunate as the first, for she capsized in the surf, and though all the
occupants were brought safe to shore by willing hands, they reached the beach
at last in a half drowned condition.</p>
<p>Humphry had been through the surf half a dozen times on missions of rescue,
and he was glad to creep to a place near one of the big fires round which all
the shipwrecked people were gathered. Medical comforts from the major's buggy
went round in tin pannikins, and presently one of the women passengers started
a hymn, and the whole assemblage was soon engaged in singing with a lusty
fervour that would have shamed many a congregation comfortably housed in
church.</p>
<p>A careful investigation by Captain Black showed that not a single soul had
been lost, although there was no hope of saving the vessel.</p>
<p>Captain Black was a grizzled old sea-dog who had been in command of the
Goorabinda for nearly a score of years and had never had an accident before. He
was heartbroken at the loss of his ship, and Humphry could get very little out
of him.</p>
<p>"I've got to stand by the ship whatever happens," said Captain Black, but he
would vouchsafe no reason, and Humphry was left under the impression that the
captain's resolution was due to nothing more than the dogged determination of
an old salt not to desert his shipwrecked vessel as long as she was still above
water.</p>
<p>"D&mdash;d death-trap, that's what the Walrus Rock is," muttered Captain
Black in Humphry's ear. "In an easterly gale there's a set of the tide into
this bay that'll pull a ship miles out of her course even if nothing goes wrong
with her engines. The old Goorabinda broke her tail-shaft just off Stingray
Point, and I knew it was a case with us from the first. But it's a marvel to me
that ships haven't been lost here before now. Next to King Island and the Three
Kings off the New Zealand coast, it's the worst place I know of in these
seas."</p>
<p>"Any chance of getting the Goorabinda off, captain?" asked Humphry.</p>
<p>"'Fraid not, young fellow; but I must borrow a buggy and get some one to
drive me to the nearest telegraph office now. I expect you'll see a couple of
tugs with Lloyd's agent aboard one of 'em round here by the morning."</p>
<p>Captain Black shut his lips tight and became uncommunicative as an oyster.
Apparently he thought that he had said too much already.</p>
<p>Humphry strolled round the different fires and listened to the speculations
of the shipwrecked sailors and passengers, most of whom had decided to camp
there for the night with the available provisions and wait for the
representatives of the steamship company to arrange to send them on to their
various destinations.</p>
<p>"The captain seems very anxious to stay by the vessel," Humphry ventured to
a loquacious fireman, who was flourishing a tin pannikin in which, alas! no
more medical comforts remained.</p>
<p>"Sh'd think 'e would too," observed the fireman thickly, and then he gave a
portentous wink designed to convey the most significant information. "There's
specie aboard the old Goorabinda. Twenty thousand sovereigns consigned to one
of the Brisbane banks. That's worth lookin' after, aint it? You'll see the
bloomin' underwriters here by breakfast-time."</p>
<p>By this time it was nearly dark, the hymn-singing had ceased, and many of
the passengers had wrapped themselves in the blankets that the major had
brought down, and were trying to sleep beside the regularly replenished fires.
Harold looked out towards the Walrus Rock, but his eyes could not pierce the
darkness. He was vaguely conscious of a feeling that the Walrus Rock exercised
some subtle influence over him. He found himself turning his gaze seaward again
and again, but in vain.</p>
<p>The moon rose at ten o'clock, and at mid-night was riding high in the sky,
making a broad pathway of light along the tumbling water. Humphry woke from a
doze, and again unconsciously his gaze turned seaward towards the reef.</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes incredulously and looked again. Yes, he could see the
white water breaking over the Walrus Rock, but where was the Goorabinda?</p>
<p>Every vestige of the steamer had disappeared.</p>
<p>Humphry shook the fireman until he awoke him. "Look! look!" he said,
pointing out across the moonlit path to where the breakers foamed over the
hidden reef.</p>
<p>The fireman looked and gave a gasp. "My oath!" he said, "she's gone orl
right! Slipped off backwards and sunk in deep water. There's thirty fathoms
just outside the reef. Nice job the underwriters 'll have even to find her
now."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII. DIVING FOR GOLD</h2>
<p>The salving of the specie on board the Goorabinda was a job that presented
many difficulties and promised to be long and tedious. The passengers had all
been sent on to their destinations, and the major, Finegan and Humphry were all
back at their respective occupations for several weeks before the syndicate
that undertook the task by arrangement with the underwriters sent their man up
to the scene.</p>
<p>Humphry was still lying low and had managed to avoid meeting Major McLean
altogether. He remained far away at the boundary-rider's hut, and thither rode
Marion Bingham on the grey pony whenever Harold relieved her by staying with
Leonie.</p>
<p>Poor Leonie had battled through a terrible attack of brain fever, but her
large eyes had still a frightened, uneasy look in them, and her wandering gaze
showed plainly enough that she had not completely recovered from the shock.</p>
<p>"But you have no brother, Harold," she repeated again and again when Harold,
on his knees beside her couch, explained to her for the hundredth time that it
was his brother and not himself that she had seen with Marion in the hut.
Still, Harold's explanation was the beginning of her partial recovery, and the
doctor expressed the most confident opinion that with care and attention she
would eventually be completely restored to health. Leonie never mentioned the
subject of Harold's brother to her mother, and Mrs. Linton was so thankful to
see her daughter getting better that she ceased to speculate upon the cause of
her illness, being content to believe that it was due to a fear that Harold had
grown cold to her and had transferred his affections elsewhere&mdash;an
apprehension completely disproved by the young fellow's devotion.</p>
<p>A certain awkwardness and restraint had crept into the relations between the
major and Mrs. Hesseltine, each of whom was oppressed by the consciousness of a
weighty secret belonging to the distant past. The major went less frequently to
Mindaroona and spent less of his leisure time on Mrs. Hesseltine's verandah,
because the conviction had taken hold of him that he had no right to cultivate
the charming widow so attentively when for all he knew he might have a wife
still living. Furthermore, he had never quite got over the shock of Muhammad
Bahksh's disclosure. It was more than probable, it was almost certain, in view
of Shaibalini's revelation to Muhammad and the Pathan's astonishing information
conveyed after his struggle with Ah Tong, that the major had a child alive
somewhere&mdash;possibly a son. If he had a son that son would be now about
twenty years of age.</p>
<p>But the major found himself in a quandary. He dared not tell Finegan that he
had been married twenty years ago and had reason to believe that he had a child
alive, because Finegan was not to be trusted. He was just as likely as not to
let out the fact, and if he did so, the major felt that he would not be able to
remain at Caringal. What would Mrs. Hesseltine think of him if she found out
that he had concealed the fact that he was married, and a father, all those
years?</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine, for her part, used to lie awake at night bitterly
regretting that she had never told Harold the real story of his birth, but had
allowed him and all her neighbours to suppose that he was her own son. She
would have to tell him some time. Of that she was certain. And she shrank from
the ordeal, postponing it as long as possible, with a dreadful knowledge that
the truth must be told some day, and that the longer it was concealed the less
excuse there would be for her conduct.</p>
<p>And then she shuddered. People were so unkind, especially one's friends.
Uncharitable persons would be sure to put the worst possible construction upon
her action. And even at the best, how could she ever look the major in the face
again if he knew that Harold was merely a waif whose father was killed by a
tribesman's bullet in the No Man's Land between the north-west frontier and the
Durand Line before the baby was born, and whose mother had never been seen from
the day that she left 'The Cedars' at St. Kilda twenty years previously.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Hesseltine remained obstinately silent, though she saw a reproachful
look in Harold's eyes whenever she was with him, which was not often now. She
realised with a shudder of apprehension that the boy deliberately avoided her.
But, after all, what wrong had she done? It was not a crime for a childless
wife to adopt a baby with her husband's knowledge, although not with his
consent. Why should she fear the opinions of her neighbours?</p>
<p>And so the widow persisted in her procrastination, but her temper began to
suffer, and more than once when Finegan came round to exchange a little
agreeable badinage with Jeanie McPherson, he found that young damsel on the
verge of tears.</p>
<p>"A canna thenk what's come ower the mestress," sighed Jeanie; "she fair
snaps ma heid aff when A speaks tae her an' glowers at me as if A was speakin'
Rooshian." So of course Finegan had to console poor Jeanie in the usual
way.</p>
<p>Matters on the three stations stood in that way when Captain Baynton, who
was Lloyd's agent, arrived in Blackfish Bay on board a small salvage steamer
and set about his preparations for salving the specie.</p>
<p>Marion Bingham told Humphry about it when she rode over to see him at the
hut, and Humphry at once grew interested.</p>
<p>"I don't know how it is, Marion," he said, "but that Walrus Rock is hardly
ever out of my thoughts." And then she saw that the gleam of determination in
his eyes was undimmed, and she sighed softly. The search seemed so hopeless and
the disappointment of Humphry so certain, that his unswerving belief in his
ultimate success was quite pathetic.</p>
<p>"I wish you could give it up, dear," she said, taking his hand in hers, "and
let the dead past bury its dead."</p>
<p>"Ah, Marion," he answered quickly, "you must not tempt me to give up the
search. If I have little else to offer you, I must at least be able to offer
you a name&mdash;that is my own. Even the poorest has a right to his own name.
But as for me, I am in ignorance of mine. I must know my father's name, Marion,
before my life is my own to share with any woman." He buried his face in his
hands for a moment, but looked up and smiled when Marion stroked his hair and
comforted him.</p>
<p>"I know that I shall some day find out where and how my mother died," he
said, "and then everything will be made plain. And I feel that it will be soon.
But I sadly need money to carry on the search."</p>
<p>That same afternoon Humphry saddled old Wallaroo and rode down to the little
bay where the salvage steamer Grappler was lying at anchor on the lee side of
the Walrus Rock. Riding along the beach towards the southern end of the bay, he
saw a boat drawn up on the sand and an alert, authoritative man in a thick
pilot suit walking briskly towards him, followed by a couple of sailors.</p>
<p>"I say," called the stranger when he had come closer, "I wish you would tell
me where the nearest telegraph office is in this God-forsaken place, and how
the deuce I can get to it."</p>
<p>Humphry jumped off his horse and gave the stranger the information that he
sought. He would have to go to Caringal, eight miles away, and there he would
be able to communicate by telephone with Shaleville, where there was a
telegraph office that would forward his message.</p>
<p>The stranger thanked him cordially. "My name is Baynton," he said, "and I am
in charge of the salvage operations for the recovery of specie lost in the
Goorabinda. My diver, I'm sorry to say, has got seriously ill through staying
down too long, and none of the deck hands have had any diving experience.
Consequently I have to wire to Sydney for another diver."</p>
<p>"I wish you would give me the chance, sir," said Harold under a sudden
impulse. "I'm sure I could manage all right in the diving dress." Here was a
chance to earn the money that he wanted so badly.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, my lad; quite impossible. I must have an experienced man. Now,
the question is how am I to get to this place&mdash;Caringal, isn't that the
name?&mdash;where I can get into communication with the telegraph office. I
hardly fancy the notion of an eight miles' tramp."</p>
<p>"You can have my horse, if you like," said Humphry.</p>
<p>Captain Baynton's eyes sparkled. "That's very good of you," he said. "I
should like the loan of him immensely. It will mean that I can get back here
to-night."</p>
<p>So the captain climbed into the saddle, and Humphry saw at a glance that he
was no novice on horseback. Having received explicit directions as to the track
to Caringal, he went off in great good-humour, leaving Humphry to await his
return and to put in the time by learning as much as possible about the salvage
operations from the two deck hands. They shared their bread and beef with him,
and having filled their pipes with Humphry's tobacco, became quite
communicative.</p>
<p>They both agreed that Captain Baynton was a good man, and that he knew his
business. But old Mullens, the skipper of the Grappler, was a fair terror.
Baynton had not been able to locate the wreck yet. It must have slipped off the
rock and then drifted a little distance before it sank. Hingston, the diver,
had stayed down so long that the captain had to administer digitalis and
strychnine to bring him round. He wanted to go down again, but the captain
wouldn't let him. So there they were. They, the deck hands, were blowed if
either of them would go down in the diving-dress. If Humphry could have seen
Hingston's face, all blue and deathly when the helmet was taken off, he
wouldn't have been so anxious to volunteer for the job.</p>
<p>The hours of waiting passed slowly, but Thompson and Ball, the deck hands,
as they lay on the beach smoking, entertained Humphry with strange stories of
salvaging at many wrecks along the Australian coast, and of the various
fatalities that they had witnessed when the diver's air-pipe got fouled, or
sharks attacked him, or an unduly long stay below under the severe pressure
caused him to collapse from diver's paralysis.</p>
<p>"It aint the job it's cracked up to be," remarked Thompson, the elder man,
with conviction; and Ball, who deferred to him in all things, corroborated with
an emphatic "No; that it aint neither."</p>
<p>At last Humphry's ear caught the sound of distant cantering hoofs and
recognised the stride of old Wallaroo. It was nearly 9 o'clock at night; and
when the captain at last dismounted Humphry saw that the horse was in a
terrible lather and the captain in a furious temper. He must have galloped
pretty well the whole way back from Caringal.</p>
<p>"Never had such cursed luck in my life," said Captain Baynton to Humphry.
"Can't get a diver anywhere. Every available man seems to be on a job, and my
people in Sydney wire that they're afraid I won't be able to get one for at
least a week. But this spell of calm weather won't hold for a week, and
directly the sea gets up I'll have to leave off working. Impossible to take the
steamer near the Walrus Rock in bad weather."</p>
<p>"I wish you would give me a trial, Captain Baynton. I'm young and in perfect
physical health. I feel sure that I could go down with perfect safety." Humphry
made the request with eager sincerity, but Captain Baynton only frowned.</p>
<p>"I could hardly take the responsibility," he answered. "A man needs to be
thoroughly fit in heart, lungs, and head if he is to wear the diver's dress
without risk to his life." But he looked at Humphry with a shrewd critical and
approving glance, all the same.</p>
<p>"I've done plenty of hard work," said Humphrey, "and I'm as hard as nails,
captain."</p>
<p>Captain Baynton looked out to seaward, where the Grappler was riding to her
anchor quietly. The sea was perfectly calm. It was ideal weather for salvage
operations, and there was L20,000 in gold&mdash;of which Captain Baynton was to
get a generous percentage on all that he recovered&mdash;lying somewhere on the
bottom of the bay, if he could only find it. He might as well offer this young
fellow five per cent. of the specie that he could recover. A skilled man would
expect three times as much.</p>
<p>"Turn up here to-morrow morning at 8 o'clock," said Captain Baynton with
sudden determination, "and if the conditions are favourable I'll chance
it."</p>
<p>So Humphry mounted Wallaroo again, and rode slowly back to Mindaroona
through the night, thinking first of Marion's face, then of the resultless
search for his long-vanished mother, and lastly of the dangerous enterprise on
the morrow to which he had committed himself.</p>
<p>A cold shiver came over him. Was it all to be ended soon&mdash;the joy of
his new-born love, the unswerving ardour of the search, the fiery ambition to
take his rightful place and his rightful name in the world at last? Was it all
to finish&mdash;next day perhaps&mdash;in the short, sharp agony of suffocation
down there on the sea-floor, twenty fathoms deep amid the rusting wreckage of
the Goorabinda and the spilled gold coins that he had volunteered to seek?</p>
<p>But he was not the man to let such thoughts as these turn him from his
purpose. He resolutely banished all gloomy forebodings, and busied himself in
laying his plans.</p>
<p>Accordingly, when he reached the boundary-rider's hut he took the saddle and
bridle off Wallaroo and turned him out into the horse-paddock. Then he lay down
on his bunk for a few hours' sleep, since it was absolutely necessary that he
should be fresh in the morning.</p>
<p>Rising at 4 o'clock, he wrote a brief note in pencil for Marion, telling her
that he had gone down to the wreck and might not be back for a day or two. He
put the note in an envelope, addressed it, and left it on the table, so that
Marion should see it when she called at the hut.</p>
<p>After a hurried and frugal meal he set out to walk to the sea, oppressed by
the strangest anticipations; and with his brain excited by the thought of the
forthcoming ordeal, he almost fancied that he could see his mother's spirit
leading him on and pointing the way towards the desolate little bay, on the
waters of which the salvage steamer Grappler was peacefully riding.</p>
<p>Just as he got down on the beach he saw a boat putting off from the
Grappler. It had evidently been sent to meet him, and before long his two
friends of the previous day, Thompson and Ball, rowed in to a sandy patch.</p>
<p>"Jump in, Robertson," called Thompson; "the skipper is just crazy to get to
work. He swears that there's a southerly on the way, and it'll probably be here
before night, and then we may have to knock off for a week or two."</p>
<p>Humphry jumped into the boat, and when he reached the Grappler saw Captain
Baynton walking up and down the deck impatiently and frequently levelling his
telescope nervously seaward.</p>
<p>"Hurry up, Robertson!" he sang out; "this flat calm won't last for ever. We
must locate the wreck, at any rate, to-day and buoy it. I've been fiddling
about here for several days already without getting any further forward, and
it's an expensive amusement, as you may guess."</p>
<p>Humphry climbed the rope ladder and stepped down on to the deck of the
Grappler, which was crowded with a litter of salvage gear that was quickly
being put together under Captain Baynton's orders.</p>
<p>"I sent Hingston home last night, after you had gone," said Baynton. "He
went away in a cocky's cart that I borrowed. Not a bit of use keeping him any
longer. It would have been murder to send him down in the diving-dress again.
His heart had given out."</p>
<p>Then Captain Baynton showed Humphry the gear and carefully explained every
part to him. There was the big three-cylinder air-pump enclosed in its teak
chest and fitted with two flywheels and handles, to be worked by two men all
the time that the diver was under water. There were the lengths of new
air-pipe; the helmet, consisting of two principal parts, the headpiece and the
breastplate, fitting closely together; and the diving-dress of solid sheet
india-rubber covered with double twill and fitted with vulcanised india-rubber
cuffs and collar. Then there were the heavy lead-soled boots.</p>
<p>"If you have quite made up your mind to take on the job I'm prepared to
employ you," said the captain in his businesslike tones, "and as this calm
weather isn't likely to last after to-day, I'd like to begin at once. What do
you say to five per cent, of all that you bring up?"</p>
<p>Humphry's eyes glistened as he assented.</p>
<p>So they set to work to prepare him for his descent. When he had stripped to
the skin they dressed him in thick woollen stockings, drawers, and guernsey.
Then they put on him the heavy india-rubber diving-dress and over it a canvas
overall with big pockets for holding the treasure-trove.</p>
<p>Captain Baynton explained to him the arrangement of the valves in the helmet
and how to regulate his air-supply in such a way that the air in the dress
would float him up to the surface if he wished. He also showed him the electric
breast-lamp, which worked on a ball and socket joint, enabling the diver to
turn the light in any direction he might desire.</p>
<p>"Now you're quite sure you understand everything, Robertson," said the
captain. "Of course, there isn't the slightest danger if you do exactly as I
have told you, and in particular if you don't stay down longer than twenty
minutes."</p>
<p>"All right, captain."</p>
<p>"What I want you to do first is simply to locate the wreck. Hingston has
looked for her already on the east and south sides of the reef without success,
so I'm going to send you down on the west side. We'll put you down about five
hundred yards out from the reef first and gradually work inwards."</p>
<p>"I'll find her, never fear."</p>
<p>"Of course, as soon as you find her you'll signal to us and come up, and
when I know exactly how she's lying and the condition that she is in I can make
a plan for getting at the specie. It will be a tough job, for it's right down
under two decks in a specially constructed chamber, but I have no doubt at all
of our success if you can only find the vessel. It's astonishing how hard it is
to find them sometimes when they slip off a reef and go down in deep water.
Now, are you ready for the helmet?"</p>
<p>"Quite ready, captain."</p>
<p>So they placed the heavy tinned-copper helmet over his head, and even
Humphry's resolute heart beat faster as the segmental screw neck-ring went home
with a quarter-turn into the neck-ring of the breastplate, making a watertight
joint. The union at the end of the air-pipe was screwed into the valve at the
back of the helmet, and Humphry heard a faint singing in his ears as the
air-pressure inside the helmet made itself felt.</p>
<p>With the strong life-line fastened about his waist, he stood at the top of
the ladder while the Grappler steamed out a few hundred yards to the spot
selected by Captain Baynton for his first attempt.</p>
<p>Baynton patted him on the shoulder encouragingly, and Humphry slowly
descended the iron ladder backwards.</p>
<p>The water came up to his knees, up to his waist, up to his neck. One last
glance round at the sunlight and the upper air and the black plates of the
Grappler, then the sea closed over his head.</p>
<p>He stepped off the lowest rung of the ladder and swung by the life-line in
mid-water. The water was green and clear. He could see the keel of the salvage
steamer. Then that, too, vanished, and Humphry went down, down, down, while the
blood sang in his ears and his head seemed to be bursting.</p>
<p>Oh, this was too horrible! A sudden panic swept through him. He must get
back to the surface again at all costs.</p>
<p>But the finely-tempered soul speedily reasserted itself and panic was
banished by a supreme effort of the will. Downward, interminably downward he
sank, and as he slightly opened the outlet valve to regulate the air-pressure a
strong jet of air-bubbles escaped and floated up to the surface, whitening the
green water above his head.</p>
<p>His heart was thumping hard, more from excitement than from the physical
stress of the air-pressure, though that began to distress him, too, when he was
40 feet below the surface. At that distance every square inch of the surface of
his body was supporting a pressure of 17 Ib.</p>
<p>At 50 feet it was 22 lb.; at 60 feet it was 26 lb.; at 70 feet it was 30
lb.; at 80 feet it was 35 lb.; at 90 feet it was 39 lb. Could he stand any more
of it?</p>
<p>And then he felt the sea-floor under his feet, a rocky shelf trending down
to a sandy plain.</p>
<p>As his eyes became accustomed to the dim light of the subaqueous region he
could make out the outlines of the rocks and the tall moving masses of marine
vegetation that sprang from the interstices. Ah! What was that? The sunken
steamer at last!</p>
<p>There she lay with her stern on the shelf of rock and her bow on the sandy
plain. Most of the keel had been ground away already by the attrition of the
rocks. The steamer was resting on her side, and she had partly opened out, so
that she lay like a great half-opened book inviting perusal.</p>
<p>Humphry determined to read the book. Turning on his electric breast-lamp, he
threw the powerful beam upon the stern of the steamer. The stern-post was
broken away, but there was the solid iron four-bladed propeller.</p>
<p>Humphry bent down and felt it over with his hand. It was iron without doubt
and solid&mdash;all in one piece.</p>
<p>Slowly he made his way along the port side of the wreck, and climbed upon
the deck, which was inclined at a steep angle towards the sea-bottom. The deck
was all broken away, but picking his course dexterously, Humphry could see into
the engine-room. The engines were heaps of rusty scrap iron.</p>
<p>But the engine-room dial still stood in its place confronting the peering
investigator. And the indicator pointed to "Full-speed astern," evidently the
last order that had been given from the bridge after the vessel struck.</p>
<p>It was eerie and terrifying down there in the depths of the sea, with the
captain's last words still sounding as it were in the ears of the prying
interloper.</p>
<p>Humphry began to retrace his steps. But before he left the ship he picked up
a heavy spanner and a small rusty axe that were lying on the deck near the door
of the engine-room and placed them in the great pocket of the canvas overall
that he wore outside the diving dress.</p>
<p>Climbing down carefully over the side of the sunken steamer, he retraced his
steps along the sandy patch and mounted the ledge of rock. Then he gave two
sharp tugs at the signal-line the signal that he wanted to ascend.</p>
<p>By keeping plenty of air in the diving-dress he lightened the pull on the
life-line, but took care to ascend slowly, so as not to bring about too sudden
a transition of the pressure. In forty seconds from the moment that he started,
the great polished helmet emerged above the water, and climbing the iron
ladder, Humphry was safe in the hands of the salvage men once more.</p>
<p>As he sat in a chair on the deck they unscrewed the helmet, and once more he
breathed the delicious invigorating breeze from the open sea.</p>
<p>Captain Baynton looked at him incredulously. "You don't mean to say that
you've found her already!" he ejaculated.</p>
<p>But Humphry just nodded his head. "You've guessed it right this time,
captain," he answered, "and when I get out of these things I'll tell you all
about it."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV. A SUBMARINE MYSTERY</h2>
<p>Captain Baynton's face wore a puzzled expression as he sat in the cabin
opposite to Humphry with a number of drawings and plans of the Goorabinda on
the table in front of him.</p>
<p>"In the first place, Robertson," he said, "I confess that I am surprised at
the position of the wreck in the spot where you have marked it on the chart. I
expected to find her much closer in to the reef."</p>
<p>"At any rate, I'm perfectly certain that I cannot be mistaken," said
Humphry. "She was lying on her port side with her stern high up on a ledge of
rock."</p>
<p>The captain looked at him sharply. "Was the rudder turned to port or
starboard?" he asked.</p>
<p>"The stern-post was all broken away and the rudder with it," replied
Humphry, "but I saw the propeller&mdash;a solid iron propeller with four
blades, all made in one piece."</p>
<p>"You're quite sure that it was a solid iron four-bladed propeller," said the
captain slowly&mdash;"quite clear about that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, quite," said Humphry confidently. "I not only saw it, but I felt it all
over with my hand."</p>
<p>Captain Baynton smiled grimly. "Very well, my lad, go on. What did you see
next?"</p>
<p>So Humphry gave him an exact description of the state of the sunken vessel,
and recounted the details of his inspection. "She was half opened out," he
said, "and when I climbed on board I had a look into the engine-room."</p>
<p>"And what did you see there?" asked the captain in tones of dry sarcasm.</p>
<p>"I saw the engines all reduced to rusty scrap," replied Humphry, resolutely
looking the obviously unbelieving captain straight in the eyes, "and I saw the
engine-room dial still standing with the indicator pointing to 'Full-speed
astern.'"</p>
<p>Captain Baynton slapped himself on the thigh exultingly. "Oh, you did, did
you, my lad?" he positively shouted at him. "Well, all I can say is that your
evidence is of no value to me. Just wait a minute and I'll call Captain
Mullens."</p>
<p>Captain Mullens, the master of the Grappler, a burly slow-moving seaman,
responded to the urgent summons of Captain Baynton and cast a fishy eye of cold
suspicion on Humphry. He had distrusted the landsman from the first.</p>
<p>"Look here, Captain Mullens," began Baynton, "you were on the Goorabinda for
over a year as second, weren't you?"</p>
<p>The captain nodded.</p>
<p>"What sort of a propeller had she?"</p>
<p>"A bronze-manganese propeller with each plate bolted on separately," said
Mullens in his sepulchral bass.</p>
<p>Humphry turned red and then white. Why did these men want to make him out a
liar?</p>
<p>Captain Baynton eyed the young fellow sternly and then began again:</p>
<p>"You attended the investigation by the court of marine inquiry into the
circumstances attending the loss of the Goorabinda, didn't you, Captain
Mullens?"</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>"What was Captain Black's evidence as to the last order that he gave from
the bridge to the engine-room?"</p>
<p>"He gave no order after the tail-shaft broke. The engines were stopped and
they never moved again. Before the tail-shaft broke the ship was going
full-speed ahead. She never went full-speed astern at all on the day of the
wreck."</p>
<p>"Then what should you say, Mullens, if this young fellow says that he went
into the engine-room of the wreck where she lies in 15 fathoms of water and saw
the engine-room dial with the indicator pointing to 'Full-speed astern'?"</p>
<p>"I should say that he was a d&mdash;d liar," replied Captain Mullens,
regarding Humphry with a hostile stare.</p>
<p>Humphry sprang to his feet furiously. "What object could I have in telling
you falsehoods?" he demanded in a white heat of indignation.</p>
<p>"Can't say, I'm sure, my lad," said Baynton dryly. "It's as big a puzzle to
me as it is to you. But it's as clear as the nose on my face that you're a
lovely romancer, and that you have no more been on board the wreck than I
have."</p>
<p>Humphry said not a word for several seconds, and the two captains stared
coldly at him.</p>
<p>The canvas overall that Humphrey had worn over the diving-dress was still in
the corner of the cabin where he had thrown it. He walked across the cabin,
took it up, and felt in the great deep pocket in the front.</p>
<p>"If I have not been on board the wreck, where do you think I got these?" he
demanded with blazing eyes as he flung on the table the heavy iron spanner and
the small rusty axe that he had brought up with him from the depths.</p>
<p>Captain Mullens surveyed the implements stonily. "Can't say, I'm sure," he
remarked "unless ye took 'em down with ye." And with that Parthian shot he left
the cabin.</p>
<p>But Baynton was plainly confounded by the production of these concrete
proofs of the existence of the wreck in the place where Humphry declared that
he had found it. "Look here, young fellow," he said with an altered manner,
"I'm afraid I have done you an injustice. You have evidently mistaken a
bronze-manganese propeller with the blades bolted on separately for a solid
iron one. And you have misread the engine-room dial, which is quite an
excusable error. But I am thoroughly convinced of your honesty now, and I know
that you have found the wreck in the position that you have described.
Consequently, I am going to ask you to go down again this afternoon and see if
you can find the specie-room. Here it is, marked on this plan."</p>
<p>He drew a large tracing over to him and pointed out the exact situation of
the specie-room, which was built on to the bulkheads next to the purser's cabin
on the port side.</p>
<p>Humphry accepted the 'amende' with a good grace, but he could not forgive
Captain Mullens, and he stipulated that that outspoken mariner should not be
invited to take any part whatever in the forthcoming operations.</p>
<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>It was just about the time when Humphry had consented to go down again in
the diving-dress that Marion Bingham rode up to the boundary-rider's hut and
found it empty. But as soon as she peeped in she saw Humphry's note on the
table. Why had Humphry gone down to the scene of the wreck? To earn money, of
course, at the risk of his life, in order to continue his search in Melbourne
for the missing woman, since he had failed to find any trace of her at
Mindaroona. Marion instantly determined to ride down to Blackfish Bay herself
and watch the operations.</p>
<p>As she cantered past the Caringal homestead she met the major, who was
jogging along to pay a call on Mrs. Hesseltine. They rode along together side
by side, and Marion mentioned that she was going down to Blackfish Bay to watch
the salvaging. When the major turned in at the Mindaroona gate, Marion went on
alone.</p>
<p>The major had a delightful proposition to make to Mrs. Hesseltine when he
met her on the verandah. Would she get out the motor-car and let him drive her
to Blackfish Bay? They might call for Leonie Linton at Yarralla and also pick
up Harold. The trip would do the girl good, and it would be an enjoyable and
interesting experience for all to see how Captain Baynton was getting on in the
work of salvaging the specie in the sunken Goorabinda.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine was delighted with the suggestion. She hardly cared to admit
to herself how much she had missed the major of late, and how much she enjoyed
being with him. The incubus of the secret of Harold's birth weighed heavily on
her, and she felt sure that the boy himself had in some mysterious way got an
inkling of the truth. But she eagerly grasped at the major's invitation, first
because of the pleasure that it gave her to sit beside him and watch the
unspoken admiration in his eyes, and secondly because it diverted her thoughts
from the ceaseless contemplation of her own past actions.</p>
<p>If only the strange disappearance of the boys' real mother could be cleared
up the path to a frank explanation of everything would be open. But there was
something painful and sinister in the abruptness with which that poor Mrs.
Robertson had vanished immediately after consenting to give up one of her twin
sons. And then Mrs. Hesseltine remembered with an additional qualm that her
cheque for L500, drawn twenty years before and payable to Mrs. Robertson, had
never been presented at her bank for payment. These memories were dreadfully
depressing.</p>
<p>"What an awfully jolly idea of yours, major!" said the lady with one of her
most bewitching smiles. "Let's start at once."</p>
<p>So the big motor-car was brought out once more, and the major in the driving
seat, with Grace Hesseltine beside him, started off for Yarralla to pick up
Leonie and also Harold, who they were quite sure would be there.</p>
<p>Leonie, still wan and large-eyed, was pleased with the prospect of the
outing but disconsolate because Harold could not be found. He was not at his
usual post that morning. So, leaving a message for him to follow on horseback
as soon as he arrived, the major and the two ladies went off in the motor-car,
heading for Blackfish Bay.</p>
<p>"That chap Baynton is a very good sort," remarked the major to Mrs.
Hesseltine as the car bumped along the rough bush track that led into the main
road to the bay. "He was up at Caringal a couple of days ago asking for the use
of my telephone connecting with the telegraph office at Shaleville, and I found
him a capital fellow&mdash;a very shrewd business man, I should think, as well
as a good sailor. He gave me a cordial invitation to go on board the Grappler
any time I liked and watch the salvage operations. So I thought I might as well
take him at his word."</p>
<p>Soon after the car reached the beach the Grappler's working-boat put off and
picked up the party of visitors. Captain Baynton, looking through his
telescope, had recognised the owner of Caringal and remembered the invitation
that he had given him.</p>
<p>Marion Bingham, tying her pony to the fence, joined the major's party, and
the working-boat took them out to the salvage steamer.</p>
<p>Thompson and Ball, the two deck hands, who were at the oars, were full of
information, or rather, to be quite accurate, Thompson, the elder, had all the
information and Ball, his admiring junior, supplied the corroboration.</p>
<p>But Marion Bingham trembled as she listened to them. What dreadful mischance
was this that brought the three persons who were unaware of Humphry's existence
to the very place where they would inevitably see him and would just as
inevitably see that he was Harold's brother?</p>
<p>"This 'ere young chap Robertson has got plenty er pluck," began Thompson,
who was rowing the stroke oar and was in easy conversational range of the party
in the stern. "'E comes from somewheres about 'ere too. Ain't wot you might
call a perfessional diver at all. Only an amachoor. The cap'n picked 'im up
quite accidental like. But 'e found the wreck first pop&mdash;didn't 'e,
Ball?"</p>
<p>"'E did sure," corroborated the bow oar.</p>
<p>"Ole Mullens&mdash;that's the skipper of the Grappler, ladies&mdash;'as got
the fair nark with Robertson. Sez 'e don't believe the young chap has found the
wreck at all. Swears it's impossible don't 'e, Ball?"</p>
<p>"'E do," from the bow.</p>
<p>"But Captain Baynton thinks it's orl right, though the wreck aint ezackly
where he expected to find her not accordin' to wot the skipper of the
Goorabinda said at the inquiry. Anyhow, he expects to get some of the gold up
this afternoon, so you may see the most interestin' part of the job, ladies.
That's so, aint it, Ball?"</p>
<p>"Right you are," echoed the bow oar, and then, having occasion to look round
over his shoulder to see that the boat was keeping her course, he gave vent to
an excited exclamation. "There 'e goes!" said Ball. "'E's going down now!"</p>
<p>The boat was still nearly a quarter of a mile distant from the Grappler, but
its occupants could plainly make out the diver in his monstrous helmet and
heavy india-rubber dress slowly descending the iron ladder over the side of the
salvage steamer.</p>
<p>Marion Bingham gave a frightened little gasp as the polished helmet
disappeared beneath the surface of the water. The man that she loved had taken
his life in his hand and gone down into those gloomy depths.</p>
<p>"'E ought to be up again in twenty minutes or 'arf an hour at the most,"
said Thompson, "an' with 'is pockets full of suvverins."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV. THE SEA GIVES UP ITS SECRET</h2>
<p>Captain Baynton gave the major and his friends a hearty welcome on board the
Grappler, and proceeded to explain to them the art and mystery of salvage work.
"My diver just now," he said, "is an inexperienced hand, a scratch man that I
picked up casually, but he has the perfect health and the sound physique that
are absolutely necessary for a diver, and I am glad to say that he located the
wreck during his first descent."</p>
<p>They watched the two men turning the handles of the air-pump and the third
man who stood beside them attending to the signal-line. But Marion Bingham, as
she followed with her eyes the white line of the air-pipe where it descended
through the water until it was lost to sight, sent her thoughts down with it to
the diver groping in the dim underworld. And her heart throbbed and her pulses
thrilled as she thought of the courage and indomitable will of the man she
loved.</p>
<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>That terrible bursting sensation in the head was not quite so bad during the
second descent and the singing in the ears was less violent.</p>
<p>As soon as Humphry's feet touched the sea floor he made his way straight to
the sunken ship, and fastened the end of the light line that he carried to one
of the deck stanchions. This was the plumper-line, the other end of which was
made fast on board the Grappler. A square iron box called a traveller ran on
the plumper-line and served to carry up any small articles that the diver might
find in the wreck and desire to send up to the surface.</p>
<p>Humphry clambered down again from the deck of the sunken ship and walked all
round her, looking for the best way of getting at the alley-way on the port
side where the plan of the Goorabinda showed that the specie-room was
situated.</p>
<p>He had studied the plan carefully in the cabin of the Grappler. He felt
certain that he knew it by heart. Yet it did not seem to coincide with the
structural arrangements of the sunken steamer. Was it possible that Captain
Baynton had been supplied with a wrong plan?</p>
<p>A strange giddiness was coming over the diver. His heart was thumping much
harder now than on his first attempt and he was at a loss to account for it.
Still, he would stick to his task and not signal to be drawn up until he had
found the boxes of gold coins.</p>
<p>As the sunken steamer lay over on her side and the greater part of the keel
had been ground away by the perpetual attrition under the influence of the
tides and currents, Humphry found that the line of cabin port-holes on the port
side was exactly the height of his head as he stood on the sand outside.</p>
<p>Small fish&mdash;yellow-tail, bream, and the blackfish after which the bay
was named&mdash;were swimming in and out of the open port-holes.</p>
<p>The diver approached one of the port-holes. He would look in and see if he
could find any clue. It might possibly be the purser's cabin which adjoined the
specie-room.</p>
<p>So the great polished copper head with its one huge glaring eye peered
through the rusty port-hole&mdash;and saw nothing but blackness. Whatever the
cabin contained could only be discovered by entering it from the port alley-way
of the sunken steamer.</p>
<p>Humphry climbed on board again.</p>
<p>It was necessary to walk with the greatest care, for the deck was broken
down in many places and the diver feared that if he fell through the planking
the air-pipe might get fouled, with disastrous results.</p>
<p>Strange how rusted and ruined the sunken steamer was already. Humphry made
his way cautiously down the broken remnant of the main companion and found
himself in the port alley-way.</p>
<p>He entered the first cabin and turned on his electric breast-lamp. Nothing
there but the iron framework of two empty bunks. Everything else apparently had
melted away.</p>
<p>Leaving the first cabin, he entered the next one. It was a good deal larger,
and by the beams of the lamp on his breast Humphry could make out the iron
frames of four bunks arranged two on each side and one above the other.
Everything that was not made of metal had entirely disintegrated. As the beams
of the electric lamp penetrated the dim water, scores of small fish scurried
away through the open port-hole, terrified by this intruding monster.</p>
<p>Ha! what was that? A dark object of about one foot square lying on the frame
of one of the lower bunks. Humphry picked it up. It was black and solid,
evidently made of some metal, and a small key was attached to the handle by a
metal chain. He would take it away with him, and Captain Baynton could examine
it at his leisure on board the Grappler.</p>
<p>There was something else, too, lying on the bunk. Something hard and round
and white. Humphry picked it up and examined it by the light of his electric
lamp.</p>
<p>A wave of terror surged through the diver's heart.</p>
<p>How came this ghastly relic of the dead on board the Goorabinda, which had
been under water scarcely a month? He seized the metal box and made his way
panic-stricken out of the cabin.</p>
<p>Scrambling up the broken companion, he found himself once more on the deck
of the sunken wreck. He placed the metal box in the traveller of the
plumper-line and pulled the signal-line once.</p>
<p>The traveller containing the metal box rose through the water, passed above
his head, and vanished towards the surface.</p>
<p>Again that terrifying giddiness came over him, and his heart beat with a
rapid rat-tat-tat that made him sick and faint. With difficulty he clambered
down from the deck of the sunken vessel and stood on the sandy sea floor, where
strange sea growths flourished in rank profusion.</p>
<p>Oh, that awful feeling of oppression, that terrible weight that was crushing
him down, down, down! He sank, huddling, on the sandy ocean-bed.</p>
<p>And then came darkness.</p>
<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>"He ought to be coming up now," said Captain Baynton anxiously, as he stood
watch in hand beside the air-pump on the deck of the Grappler. "He's been down
thirty-five minutes."</p>
<p>Marion Bingham's face went white. "You don't think there's any danger, do
you, Captain Baynton?" she asked.</p>
<p>"I hope not, my dear young lady," said the salvage expert, "but one never
knows exactly where one is with novices at this game. I told him not to stay
down longer than twenty minutes, but he may have found the specie-room, and he
is possibly taking a risk in order to get out the gold."</p>
<p>"A plucky chap, eh, captain?" queried Major McLean.</p>
<p>"One of the bravest men I've ever met," said Baynton briefly.</p>
<p>"How deep did he go this morning?" asked the major.</p>
<p>"Just 90 feet," said Baynton. "It's a very fair depth for a novice. At 90
feet there's a pressure of 39 Ibs. to every square inch of the diver's body,
but he ought to be able to stand that much without harm. It's when you go over
90 feet that the risk begins, as a rule."</p>
<p>It was at this point of the discussion that Mullens, the skipper of the
Grappler, joined the little group near the steamer's rail. "He's more than 90
feet down now," he remarked sourly. Baynton had seriously offended him by
accepting the absurd statements of the diver in the forenoon, and he was not
sorry of a chance to even with the expert.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about, Mullens?" demanded Baynton. "I tell you the
depth he went down this morning was 90 feet."</p>
<p>"Well, all I can say is that the depth he is down now is 101 feet," said
Mullens grimly. "You can see it for yourself on the gauge."</p>
<p>Baynton stepped back quickly, and looked at the two gauges on the front of
the air-pump.</p>
<p>The indicator of one pointed just past the number '100,' and the indicator
of the other pointed to the number '43 1/2.'</p>
<p>"Aint you satisfied?" drawled Mullens. "Looks to me that the man's 101 feet
down, and that he's bearing a pressure of 43 1/2 lb. to the square inch."</p>
<p>Baynton's face went a shade paler under the tan. "My God!" he muttered, "I
forgot that there's eleven feet rise and fall of tide in this bay, and it's
high-water now."</p>
<p>He ran to the signal-line and gave it a couple of sharp tugs. There was no
response from below.</p>
<p>"Up with him, lads!" he shouted. "Stand back, please, ladies. Now then,
steady; not too fast. The slower he comes the better his chance will be."</p>
<p>They hauled away on the life-line, but very slowly and carefully, so as to
minimise the effect of the transition from the areas of greater pressure to the
areas of less pressure.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine and Leonie began to cry, but Marion stood white-faced but
dry-eyed beside the men who were turning the handles of the air-pump.</p>
<p>As the luckless diver was hauled up, those on board the Grappler saw at once
that he was unconscious&mdash;if not already dead. His head had fallen forward,
and his body lay like a log in the loop of the life-line.</p>
<p>"Bear a hand there, lads!" sang out Captain Baynton; "look lively now, and
get him on board quick."</p>
<p>Two sailors grasped the inanimate figure, one on each side, and fairly
lifted the dead weight up the iron ladder.</p>
<p>Locking their arms, they supported the unconscious man in an upright
position on the deck while Captain Baynton hastily unscrewed the helmet.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hesseltine and Leonie were sobbing. "Oh, I do hope the poor man isn't
dead!" the widow kept aimlessly repeating, but Leonie said nothing. She only
passed her hand across her forehead wearily.</p>
<p>Marion alone preserved her self-control perfectly. "I should like to help
you if I may, Captain Baynton," she said quietly, though her face was white and
her eyes seemed to be twice their usual size.</p>
<p>Major McLean stood beside the girl, admiring her pluck and presence of mind.
In his hand he held the metal box that had come up in the traveller on the
plumper-line from the wreck. In the excitement of getting the stricken diver on
board, nobody had had time to examine the treasure-trove from the sunken
ship.</p>
<p>It took a few seconds to unscrew the helmet from the breast-plate, and all
the bystanders stood round with their eyes fixed on that inanimate form in its
grotesque dress, supported in the arms of the two sailors.</p>
<p>At last Captain Baynton lifted the head-piece off the helmet, and as he did
so, disclosing the blue and livid features of the diver, a wild scream came
from Mrs. Hesseltine.</p>
<p>"My God!" she cried. "It's Harold!" She covered her face with her hands and
turned away, unable to face the piteous sight.</p>
<p>"What devil's trick is this?" exclaimed the major in amazement to Captain
Baynton. "How came you to allow Mrs. Hesseltine's son to go down in the
diving-dress?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Hesseltine's son!" repeated the astounded salvage expert. "This isn't
Mrs. Hesseltine's son. It's a young fellow named Robertson, who offered his
services to me. I'll trouble you to stand aside now, sir, and let me get to
work, or you'll be responsible for the man's death. Indeed, he may be dead
already."</p>
<p>As he was taking Humphry out of the diving-dress and laying him down on the
deck, there came a hail from the water, and looking out over the rail the major
saw the 'double' of the diver seated in the stern of the steamer's
working-boat, which had been taken back by Thompson and Ball to bring him
off.</p>
<p>"Is that you, Harold?" sang out the major, who trembled with a strange vague
premonition.</p>
<p>"Of course it is!" cried Harold cheerily. "You don't suppose it is my ghost,
do you, major?" He climbed up the iron ladder and stood aghast at the scene on
the deck.</p>
<p>Captain Baynton in his shirt-sleeves was down on his hands and knees working
at the unconscious form of Humphry. "Diver's paralysis," he said curtly, and
went on moving the arms of the recumbent man up and down. "I've given him a
dose of digitalis and strychnine. There is hope yet."</p>
<p>And then Harold caught sight of Mrs. Hesseltine and Leonie. The widow gave a
cry of relief when she saw him, and Leonie fell on his neck in a paroxysm of
weeping. "Harold, Harold! what does it all mean?" she asked hysterically.</p>
<p>"That is my brother Humphry," said Harold in a whisper. "Don't you remember,
Leonie? You saw him in the boundary-rider's hut with Marion. I told you that it
was not I whom you saw. But I did not know that he was down on the Grappler
diving for the wreck of the Goorabinda."</p>
<p>A sharp ejaculation from the major drew the eyes of all to him. He was
staring petrified at the tarnished metal box sent up by Humphry from the wreck.
He had opened it. Harold went over and stood by the major's side and looked
into the silver box of Indian workmanship that sent such a flood of
recollections surging through the major's heart.</p>
<p>What did they see in the box?</p>
<p>A ring with a little green stone surrounded by brilliants, a heavy gold
bangle with an inscription on the inside, and several papers.</p>
<p>The major gazed at these strange sea-treasures with dazed eyes. He unfolded
the papers. The first was a marriage certificate&mdash;his own marriage
certificate, recording his wedding at Bombay with Mildred Harrington, widow,
aged 32.</p>
<p>There were two other papers&mdash;birth certificates issued by the registrar
of births, deaths, and marriages, Grey Street, St. Kilda, Victoria, recording
the births of Humphry and Harold McLean, twin sons of Hector and Mildred
McLean, formerly of Tilgit, in the North-west Province of British India.</p>
<p>The major was like a man in a dream. He could not grasp what had happened.
But he groped blindly for Harold's hand and clasped it. "My son," he said, "my
son!"</p>
<p>And then in an instant he was on his knees on the deck, helping in the
terribly anxious work of resuscitation. To find a son and to lose one in the
same moment would be a stroke beyond human endurance.</p>
<p>Marion was helping too, and little by little the blue colour faded from
Humphry's face, and the faint irregular pulsation of the heart grew stronger
and steadier. At last he opened his eyes and they rested on Marion.</p>
<p>"Darling," he whispered, "you have called me back from the great deeps."</p>
<p>Not till then did Marion bow her head, and a warm tear fell upon Humphry's
hand.</p>
<p>They lifted him up tenderly and laid him in the cabin, while Captain
Baynton, still mystified, looked from the major to Harold and then to Humphry
in dumb wonder.</p>
<p>He was still wrestling with the puzzle when Captain Mullens came along the
deck holding in his hand the small axe that Humphry had brought up from his
first descent to the wreck.</p>
<p>"It wasn't the Goorabinda that he found," said Mullens in an awe-stricken
voice. "It was the wreck of another steamer&mdash;a steamer that must have
struck the Walrus Rock one stormy night just twenty years ago and gone down
with every soul on board, leaving no single trace of the disaster. Look
here."</p>
<p>He displayed the rusty iron axe-head. It was such a tool as ship's
carpenters use, and faintly showing through the rust was a name just
legible&mdash;ss. Seamew.</p>
<p>"D'ye recollect the Seamew, Captain Baynton?" said Mullens.</p>
<p>"I do," answered the salvage expert. "She was a steamer that traded from
Sydney up the coast. She left Sydney one night in October, the year of the
Teviot gale, and was never seen again. Looks as if she was coming in to the old
jetty at this bay, and old Barnes must have piled her up on the Walrus Rock. I
remember the night well. The people on board her couldn't have had a chance.
Poor old Barnes! It was to have been his last voyage&mdash;and so it was. We
often wondered how the old Seamew was lost, and to think that this young chap
blundered on to her by accident after all these years!"</p>
<p>"Perhaps it wasn't altogether an accident," said Marion Bingham softly.</p>
<p>In the cabin a few minutes later Mrs. Hesseltine made full confession.</p>
<p>The major had found her cheque in the dead woman's silver casket, and the
truth was at last made plain. Weeping, the widow told the major the story of
the birth of Humphry and Harold at 'The Cedars' in St. Kilda, and how she
persuaded the dead woman to hand over one of the babies to her to ease the
loneliness and misery of her childless life. "Surely it was not wrong of me,
was it, Hector?" she murmured amid her tears. "And I have brought up your son
as if he was my own. Will you forgive me?"</p>
<p>Of course he would.</p>
<p>Harold, with Leonie beside him, forgave her too, and so did Humphry as he
lay on the bunk in the little cabin of the Grappler, holding Marion's hand in
his. He had proved at last that the dead woman was journeying to claim her own
child again when she met her death.</p>
<p>And as the little steamer rocked gently over the sunken wreck that was the
dead woman's grave, all the fears and misunderstandings of the past seemed to
fade away. Humphry and Harold had found not only their mother but also their
father, and the major was happy in his sons.</p>
<p>It was the end of the long quest.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI. THE DIVER'S TREASURE</h2>
<p>When Captain Baynton had recovered from the staggering surprise of finding
the long-lost Seamew while he was looking for the Goorabinda, he renewed his
search for the more recently lost vessel with redoubled energy. The two divers
who came from Sydney to Blackfish Bay were thoroughly experienced men, and they
could go down with safety to twice the depth that had been reached by
Humphry.</p>
<p>It was lucky for the salvage people that the weather held fair for several
days, and before the first southerly came along the real Goorabinda was located
in a hundred and fifty feet of water on the east side of Walrus Rock and close
in.</p>
<p>When the divers broke their way into the specie-room and crawled in through
the narrow aperture between the lower-deck, which had collapsed, and the
vessel's side, they found that the sea-worms had already riddled the wooden
boxes in which the coin was packed, and the sovereigns and half-sovereigns were
lying on the bare plates.</p>
<p>The divers brought up specie to the value of nearly L18,000. The rest of the
coin had slipped through a hole in the Goorabinda's plates and had dropped to a
depth at which it was impossible to recover it. And there it lay like the gold
that inspired the poet Hamilton to write that wonderful sonnet of which the
last six lines run thus:</p>
<blockquote>"So lie the wasted years, the long-lost hopes,<br>
Beneath the now hushed surface of myself.<br>
In lonelier depths than where the diver gropes<br>
They lie deep, deep. Yet I at times behold<br>
In doubtful glimpses, on some reefy shelf,<br>
The gleam of irrecoverable gold."</blockquote>
<hr align="center" width="25%">
<p>It was through Finegan that Humphry heard that he had no longer anything to
fear from the authorities of the bank in Melbourne, for the real thief had been
'fitted.' A special audit of the books revealed the delinquent, and though
Humphry's sudden flight had diverted suspicion from the culprit for a time, it
could not save him from the consequences of his guilt. The embezzler was sent
up for trial and in due course convicted.</p>
<p>Finegan, for his part, had no desire to return to his previous occupation of
jackal for Mr. Con Bounce, of Bourke Street, whose dusty waiting-room, crowded
with remittance men and bibulous heirs to extensive estates in the old country,
saw the redoubtable Tim no more.</p>
<p>"The major an' Mrs. Hesseltine are to be married just before Christmas,
Jeanie," remarked Mr. Finegan reflectively, as he sat with his arm round that
young person's waist in the kitchen at Mindaroona, "an' I'm thinking that when
Caringal and Mindaroona are joined my boss and yours will be looking out for a
married couple to live on the property and make themselves generally
useful."</p>
<p>"Weel, Tim?"</p>
<p>"The major asked me this morning," continued Finegan, "if I knew where he
could get a trustworthy married couple. I told him I did not."</p>
<p>"Oh, what an awfu' lee, Tim!" said Jeanie reproachfully, shaking her finger
at her unperturbed admirer. "Gang off tae him at yince an' tell him ye ken a
couple that's gaun to be merried as sune as himself, and they'll dae the wark
for him better than any ither bodies. Don't stop haverin' here, but gang the
noo."</p>
<p>And she fairly drove him from the kitchen to apply for the billet as one
half, though not the most important one, of the required married couple.</p>
<p>It was marvellous to see how fast the brightness came back to Leonie's eyes,
the rosy hue of health to her cheeks, and the springy grace of youth and
happiness to her walk as soon as the mystery in the boundary-rider's hut was
cleared up.</p>
<p>"I can't think how I was so blind as not to see the difference, Harold," she
whispered confidentially to him not long before Christmas; "why, his hair is
ever so much darker than yours&mdash;and he's not half so nice-looking, though
of course I intend to like him ever so much as a brother."</p>
<p>Humphry and Marion were not a demonstrative pair of lovers. Nobody saw them
wandering together in unabashed abandonment to the happiness of being engaged,
like Harold and Leonie. But their love, perhaps, was all the deeper and
stronger.</p>
<p>"I never guessed, dear," said Humphry, "that when the search was finished I
should find a treasure for myself. And look at this little book of Rossetti's
poems that I found in my father's writing-room only yesterday. My mother's name
is on the title-page, and father says that Rossetti was one of her favourite
poets. Isn't it strange that when I took up the book it opened at this page,
and the first verse that my eyes fell upon was this?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>"I looked and saw your love<br>
In the shadow of your heart,<br>
As a diver sees the pearl<br>
In the shadow of the sea;<br>
And I murmured, not above<br>
My breath but all apart:<br>
Ah, you can love, sweet girl!<br>
And is your love for me?"</blockquote>
<p>"Yes, indeed it is strange, dear," said Marion; "but, after all, it is only
the last of a series of what some people might call the accidents that have
brought you and me together. For myself, I find it hard to believe that we have
found each other simply through a freak of fate. Don't you?"</p>

<b>NEWSPAPER REVIEWS OF "DESIGNING FATE."</b></p>
<p>The West Australian, Perth, W.A.<br>
Saturday 21 September, 1912.</p>
<p>LITERATURE. AN AUSTRALIAN NOVEL. "Designing Fate," by John Sandes (Hodder
and Stoughton, London and New York). The well-known Australian journalist whose
previous efforts in the field of fiction was for the adaptation of love-making
to the aeroplane, has not achieved a distinctive success in "Designing Fate;"
but he has written a readable story. The plot is somewhat feeble, and its
culmination far-fetched, but there is some bright descriptive writing and a
narrative that sustains the readers interest. The tale tells of the fortunes of
twin brothers, whose mother had, under stringent financial pressure, sold one
of her infants to the childless young wife of an elderly squatter, left the
other in the care of a fashionable boarding-house keeper in Melbourne and
disappeared. One boy, Harold, was brought up as the son of the old squatter,
the other, Humphrey, as the nephew of the boarding-house keeper, neither
knowing his true name or history. But the mother, who had disappeared, had
never presented the L500 cheque which she received for Harold, and Major
McLean, the husband from whom she had run away, had sought in vain to find
traces of her. Ultimately the twin brothers meet. Harold as a young squatter,
Humphrey a surface hand is an iron smelting establishment. Humphrey is "wanted"
by the Melbourne police on a charge (false, of course), of embezzlement as a
bank clerk; he has learned the truth, or something of the truth, about his
parentage, and is bent on finding out what has become of his missing mother. He
and Harold exchange confidences, and the latter engages him as boundary rider;
but a steamer is wrecked on the coast near the run, and Humphrey volunteers to
ask as amateur diver to locate the wreck in deep water. He discovers, not the
steamer for which he is searching, but a 20 year old wreck, and brings to the
surface the jewel box of his dead mother, containing all the clues and
documents necessary to establish identities. The missing mother, it appears,
had left Melbourne for Sydney to recover the baby she had sold, and her steamer
had foundered with all hands. This is where the title of the book "Designing
Fate" is meant to apply. The diving scenes are written up with much
conscientious attention to accuracy in detail, and the author in a brief
preface sets out that he did not invent the incident of a diver looking for one
wreck and discovering another. Such an incident actually occurred during the
search for the Elingamite wreck off the Three Kings of Sydney Coast a few years
ago. The best chapter of the book is that in which smelting operations are
carried on at the Lithgow ironworks.</p>

<p>AN AUSTRALIAN NOVEL.</p>
<p>The latest contribution to the gallery of Australian fiction is a story
called "Designing Fate," by Mr John Sandes. The opening scenes are laid in
India, but the venue soon changes to this country, where the twin sons of a
father who is not aware of their existence meet and work out their respective
destinies, until the secret of their birth is finally solved. There are three
love affairs, which come to a successful issue and there are excellent pictures
of various aspects of Australian life, including a graphic account of a steel
mill in working and a shipwreck. Among various well-drawn characters that play
their part is a delightful gentleman, Muhammed Bahkah, alias Gulab Singh, whose
appearances are all too brief: and the final denouement comes about by means of
a situation which might seem incredible but for the fact that the author gives
chapter and verse for it. Altogether it is an admirable story, although we take
exception to the statement on the cover that it is Mr Sandes's first novel.</p>
