    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Four men were at work in the carpenter's shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two large windows facing south let the sunlight in upon the
      benches and the shavings littering the floor. In a corner
      four coats hung upon pegs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The windows of the shop looked out upon the yard of Messrs.
      Samson &amp; Hoad, Builders, of Kingham, and this yard was
      full of building material: yellow bricks, red bricks,
      flettons, tiles, drain-pipes, sand, ballast. An old blue
      door, taken from some dismantled house, stood leaning
      against a black tarred fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The names of the four men were Tower, Smith, Woodward, and
      Scudder. Tower and Smith were busy at the benches.
      Woodward, a sallow man, baldish and with a sneering nose,
      was honing a chisel. Young Scudder, the shop's lout, had
      got hold of a broom and was preparing to sweep up the
      shavings. Both he and Woodward, while ostensibly at work,
      were waiting for the hooter of Royal's Carriage Works to
      set them free.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a Saturday in May, and above the tarred fence
      enclosing the yard a lilac showed its purple spikes. Tower,
      the foreman, would pause in the cutting of his mortise
      holes and look at the lilac bush. At sixty-five he liked to
      look at such things with some of the gentleness of a man
      who realized that life did not last for ever. Keir Smith,
      with his dark head bent over a piece of oak, might glance
      occasionally at the lilac bush, but his gaze was different.
      It was swift and cursory like that of a man lifting his
      head momentarily to look at a flame, something that was
      both near and far, like a sunset beyond a factory chimney.
      His work absorbed him. For the moment his consciousness was
      constrained to follow the grain of the oak, and the purple
      flame of the flower belonged to tomorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The facetious lad with the broom, finding himself close to
      the man who was sharpening the chisel, nudged him and then
      levelled the broom handle at the worker in oak. Their
      glances were pointed at the other man's figure, with its
      rather rounded shoulders and thin neck. It was an unusual
      figure both in its concentration and in its colour. It wore
      grey flannel trousers and a blue pull-over with a pattern
      of yellow zigzags. Its hair had a black intensity. The
      glances of the broom-squire and the chisel-sharpener met
      and mingled in a little sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad winked. He resumed his sweeping, pushing the broom
      under the oak-worker's bench. It played challengingly round
      Keir Smith's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't mind me, old lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, since no notice was taken of the playful
      provocation, he clipped Keir's ankle with the head of the
      broom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir turned his head sharply. He smiled, but the smile was
      willed, and at the back of his eyes other scorns were
      concealed. He knew that it was easier to shrug off the
      provocation than to challenge it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doing the job thoroughly--aren't you, Scudder?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved to one side so that the broom's progress should
      not be impeded, but he had been guilty of irony, and the
      delicate flavour of the product may not mingle with the
      smell of sawdust. The head of the broom was proposing to
      try a second flick at Keir's ankles, but at that moment
      Royal's hooter blew. The broom was pitched into a corner.
      The man with the chisel tossed it up, caught it deftly by
      the handle, and began to whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to the corner of the shop where their coats and
      hats hung. Keir was at work again on his oak door, and old
      Tower was looking at the lilac bush, but he had not put
      down his tools. Hooter or no hooter, he would finish
      cutting that mortise, but old Tower was grey-headed and
      beyond redemption. He did not matter. Keir did matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed down the shop, he of the broom addressed the
      worker in oak. He too could be ironical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you heard the--hooter--Mr.--Smith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Keir had heard it, but being of a different fibre from
      those others, he did not regard it as the voice of his god.
      If he dreamed dreams--and he did dream them--they were not
      the negation of all ardour and all effort. If he had
      visions of some magic beanstalk up which he would clamber,
      he had cause to know that there were other men who would
      rush to catch him by the legs and pull him down. He did not
      turn his head to answer the broomster, and had he listened
      to the two voices in the doorway, he might have heard the
      sallow fellow with the sneering nose refer to him as a
      sulky swine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tower had laid down his chisel and mallet and was
      wiping his hands on the swell of his apron. It was a
      characteristic gesture. Old Tower's hands were always
      clean. He turned to look at Keir, and his look at him was
      kindly. He could have said: "You're not on the jump for the
      whistle. You haven't got a girl or a garden waiting for
      you." But, being wise in his generation, he understood the
      unusualness of Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "I'm going to stick a row of peas," and with a
      last glance at the lilac bush he took off his apron and
      hung it up, then put on his coat and his old grey felt hat,
      and somehow the brim of it fitted his round, mild face like
      a halo.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir straightened his back and smiled at Mr. Tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That doesn't go on the time-sheet, Tom."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Tom let out a faint belch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life isn't all time-sheet, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir knew that as well as old Tom did.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the shop to himself, he went and extracted a small
      parcel of sandwiches from his coat pocket, and, sitting on
      one of the benches, he made his meal and looked at the
      lilac bush flagging him over the top of the black fence.
      Tomorrow--Sunday--would be his lilac time, and he sat and
      thought of the downs above the Shere valley with the
      whitethorns in flower, and the windings of the Pilgrims'
      Way. He would be out on his bicycle at nine o'clock with a
      haversack on the handlebars, and in it a book and the day's
      rations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone had come to the door of the shop and was watching
      him, an old man with the head of a Roman, Mr. Samson of
      Samson &amp; Hoad. His hair, like a brilliant white cap,
      made his high colour seem all the more vivid. He looked at
      Keir as though the young man's figure was as provocative as
      his name, for an unusual father somehow glorying in the
      undistinguished name of Smith had christened the boy Keir
      Hardie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson gazed and reflected. The original Smith had been
      a bit of a character, one of those intense and fervidly
      swarthy men who must preach, and wear with their oratory
      either a red tie or a white one. The original Smith had
      preferred the red. He had been a firebrand, spluttering
      with windy woe. But the boy was different. With that ruff
      of very black hair and the smoulder of his eyes he too
      should have worn a red tie and the aggressive glow of a
      Glaswegian. But Keir--Keir's urge was somehow separative
      and personal. It set out and climbed the hills instead of
      mounting the soap-box. Its ambition was not to count heads,
      but to transcend them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson had very bright, dark eyes and an air of jocund
      vigour. There was very little that he missed, nor had he
      missed his opportunities. He knew that old Tower would soon
      be on the shelf, and that as a foreman old Tom was too mild
      and easy. Inevitably, Keir was the man for the job, but
      Keir would never be popular. He set too hot a pace. He was
      unusual, and the world distrusts the unusual, for it casts
      a shadow over the plains.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson walked into the shop. Kingham knew him without a
      hat in all weather and in all places, and said that old
      Samson was foolishly proud of his white hair and boyish
      skin, and that the old rascal still had an eye for the
      women. It was possible, for his handsome head and jocund
      eyes were very noticeable, even in a crowd. But if Mr.
      Samson had looks, Keir had manners. He got off the bench
      and stood, not like an employee on parade, but because
      there was that in him which respected the older man. Mr.
      Samson noticed the act. He knew that most men would have
      remained perched and munching, not necessarily to show
      their independence, but because they were made that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded at Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Taking it out of me in overtime, what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was their joke, like some facetious reference to the
      English weather, but if Keir took time and a quarter or
      time and a half out of Samson &amp; Hoad, he was worth it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get on with your lunch, lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson crossed to the bench by the window and, putting
      out two large hands, lifted down the door that Keir had
      left leaning against the wall. He held it to the light and
      looked at the fine texture of the wood. Being English, he
      loved the stark simplicity of oak. Walnut was all very
      well, but too mottled and tricky. As for mahogany, Mr.
      Samson loathed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid the door on the bench and ran the tips of his
      fingers over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She won't shrink, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been in store five years. That's one of the things you
      can't hurry even in these cut-and-come-quick days."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir stood looking at his work, and his dark face seemed to
      catch the diffused sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the last but one of the six. They're up to the
      Darvels standard. Couldn't put cheap stuff in a house like
      that. Mr. Lugard understands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson raised his white eyebrows, and for the moment
      his expression was whimsical. Mr. Lugard was a difficult
      man to please, and Mr. Samson had assured him that he had
      one craftsman in his shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you haven't let me down, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir looked thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lugard knows what he wants. Well, that's all right.
      It's--beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson, out again in the sunlight, wondered not so much
      at those words as at their implication. Keir's father would
      have grown furious over a thing of beauty produced for the
      benefit of the idle rich, but Keir did not react in the
      same way. He saw further than his father. Possibly he
      understood that beauty is an abstraction and not to be
      contained in wranglings upon surplus value. Because a thing
      was beautiful and belonged to some other man Keir did not
      want to smash it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Idle rich? What rot!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, being an orphan, lodged with Mrs. Marter of Mulberry
      Row, and Mrs. Marter was sixty and a widow. She was a round
      and comfortable woman whose figure was divided into two
      bulges by her apron strings, and she was a great talker,
      but she fed Keir well and charged him only twenty-five
      shillings a week for his board and lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally she gave him good advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never you have anything to do with the skinny sort, or a
      woman with a beady black eye, or a girl as gets chilblains
      and a red nose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of her advice was superfluous, for Keir seemed proof
      against petticoats or shy of them, though his finances
      might have justified little adventures. He was paid one and
      fivepence an hour, and with overtime he could make his four
      pounds a week. His National Health and Unemployment
      Insurance payments totalled one and fourpence a week. He
      did not drink and his cigarette bill was negligible.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a worker young Keir was a warm man. He was putting by
      two pounds a week, and his spare cash went mostly on books.
      He picked them up second-hand at a shabby old shop in
      Church Lane or indulged himself in one of a series on
      economics and industrialism. He held certificates from the
      secondary school for building construction and drawing and
      the trade course. His bed-sitting-room was full of books.
      He had made himself a bookcase with glass doors, and Mrs.
      Marter, when she was doing his room, would shake her head
      at all this literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Keir was such a serious young man, and though no lodger
      could have given Mrs. Marter less trouble, she would have
      preferred a youngster who was less worthy, less silently
      intense. Mrs. Marter "my deared" everything and everybody,
      and she even managed to "my dear" her lodger, but without
      that satisfying sense of motherliness that swelled in her
      like a loaf in an oven. Mrs. Marter believed that boys
      should be boys, and young men--just a little hearty, and it
      wasn't as though Keir hadn't looks and a sense of colour.
      He owned a pair of brown plus-fours and a tight blue
      pull-over which he put on when he went cycling on Sundays.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that particular Saturday in May, Keir returned to
      Mulberry Row at five o'clock. Mrs. Marter had his tea ready
      and was waiting to go out for her Saturday shopping. He
      hung up his hat in the narrow passage and went into the
      scullery to wash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Marter was filling the tea-pot. She proposed to allow
      herself a ninepenny seat in the Kingham Picture House. Keir
      never went to the pictures. She heard him busy at the
      roller towel, and his voice came to her from the scullery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I shall be out tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, that wasn't unusual, but why didn't he take a girl
      with him? There was young Ida Thomas at No. 5, a nice girl
      if ever there was one, and quite ready to be interested in
      Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wanting sandwiches, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just some bread and cheese, and a slice of cake."
    </p>
    <p>
      The usual celibate meal! Keir was no more interested in
      food than he was in girls. He seemed to browse upon books.
      Well, some day perhaps he would get it badly and with the
      wrong sort of girl. Mrs. Marter was inclined to regard him
      as dreadfully innocent. And she did enjoy cooking a good
      Sunday dinner and eating it and going to sleep afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have a little bit of ham, my dear. I can get you a couple
      of slices at the International."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir did not react to the crude colour of ham. He said
      that bread and cheese would do, but Mrs. Marter might buy
      him two apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Keir sat down to his tea, and Mrs. Marter put on her
      best hat and collected a string-bag and went out to shop.
      Apples--indeed! Well, there ought to be an Eve in the
      picture. She supposed that Keir would go and fiddle with
      his bicycle, which he kept in a little shed in the garden;
      and then disappear upstairs and pick up some book; and that
      was exactly what he did do.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had an old basket chair in his bed-sitting-room. He
      pushed it close to the open window and sat down with the
      poems of Keats. He had discovered Keats only two months
      ago. "Windows opening upon foam!" And his particular window
      opened upon Mrs. Marter's one apple tree, an old Blenheim
      Orange. It was in full flower, and the flowers were full of
      bees.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Marter could say of him: "If it rains or it snows,
      he'll be off on that bike of his. And what do you think he
      takes with him? A flapper? Oh, no. A book. I see'd the
      title of the last one. 'A Text-book of Gee-ology.' Yes, you
      can believe me or not--but that's what it was. Gee-ology.
      Somethin' to do with how the earth came to be made. It
      doesn't seem quite natural--somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      On that Sunday in May, Keir got his bicycle out of the shed
      before nine and, wheeling it into the passage at the back
      of Mulberry Row, fastened a haversack and a mackintosh to
      the handlebars. The cold snap of early May had passed, and
      in the garden next to Mrs. Marter's a bed of blood-red
      wallflowers scented the air. At a bedroom window of No. 5 a
      girl was powdering her nose, and if she was aware of Keir's
      blue pull-over and hatless head, his senses were not
      responsive. She watched him wheel his bicycle along the
      passage, and when he had disappeared she gave a little toss
      of the head and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir liked to leave Kingham early, before the world upon
      wheels could drive him into the gutter. Usually he took the
      Esher, Cobham, Ripley, Guildford road, and turning off
      towards West Clandon, he would walk his machine up the long
      hill to Newlands Corner and the Albury Downs. This rolling
      country of chalk and of sand lying between the
      Leatherhead-Guildford road on the north and Ewhurst on the
      south had an eternal fascination for him. He loved its
      great grassy slopes, its yews and beeches, the high dark
      pinewoods, the deep and mysterious valleys. He knew it in
      spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In one of his
      note-books he had drawn a rough contour map of its
      geological formation, and from the Thames towards the sea
      the rhythm ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      Alluvium. London Clay Downs Gault. Greensand, Weald. South
      Downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tertiaries Chalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bagshot Sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the top of the hill Keir took to the turf, for the world
      on wheels had overtaken him, and in those days Newlands
      Corner was an abomination. The crowd had not been coerced
      into cleanliness by the courage of a certain great
      gentleman now dead. Keir wheeled his bicycle along the
      broad, grassy way that led eastwards just below the brow of
      the chalk ridge. The beech trees were coming into leaf, and
      the old yews looked very black against the marvel of all
      this greenness. The thorns were in flower, and in the more
      secret places the bluebells had been left to bloom. Keir
      fled from the crowd and its cars and motor-bikes. He wanted
      to be alone, and this passion for separativeness was to
      make life poignant for him, for in the world of today only
      the fortunate few can afford to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he knew all this piece of country like the pages of a
      book, how to avoid the beaten track and to gain places to
      which cars and motor-bikes did not penetrate. He had one
      particular haunt close to a group of beech trees, and
      leaving the grass, he pushed through a thicket towards the
      place, but on this Sunday in May someone had forestalled
      him. A party of young men and women had spread itself on
      the grass between the beech trees and a group of old
      thorns. The young women were unpacking baskets, and one of
      the young men kneeling on the turf was opening bottles of
      beer. It was a happy and a noisy party, and Keir paused
      with his bicycle under the lee of a big yew.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do we do with the bottles, Bert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buzz 'em away, old lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Keir watched three black bottles go hurtling one after
      another into the heart of an old thorn tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      He withdrew. In those early days his separative self was
      moved too easily to scorn. He was too conscious of the
      crowd's crudities and not sufficiently wise as to its
      kindness. He did not realize that the world was full of
      childishness, that it did not think or understand, and that
      his own sensitiveness might possess the superciliousness of
      the prig. He went elsewhere, pushing his bike along the
      hillside until he came to another of his sanctuaries. It
      was a little green recess on the sunny side of the woods
      shut in by thorn trees, an elder, and two hazels. It was
      wholly and serenely his. He unfastened his belongings from
      the bicycle, and pushing the machine into the undergrowth,
      he spread his mackintosh and lay down.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that green nook the turf was stippled with flowers, blue
      bugle, a tiny wild forget-me-not, dog-violets. He could
      smell the mayflower. The hillside fell away steeply to a
      barrier of old yews, and beyond and below them the deep
      valley was full of sunlight. On the farther slope spread a
      wood of wonderful and varied greenness, fields, oaks and
      elms, and the grassy spaces and the domed trees of a park.
      Beyond it rose a wooded ridge, and beyond it yet another
      ridge serrate with dark pines against the sky-line. The
      hills were blue and black and green and grey, for the day
      was a day of moods and of cloud masses that drifted. Away
      to the west he could see the silver smoke haze over
      Guildford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir left his book unread and lay and looked and dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dreams of a young man with a smoulder of ambition in
      his eyes, and a head of hair that was somehow turbulent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of the crowd--not he! A wage slave doomed to a silly
      sameness by the very fools who preached the solidity of
      that sameness? He belonged to no union. Blind idiots,
      complaining that all opportunity was denied to the worker,
      and by their very regulations making opportunity more and
      more impossible! A stultifying tyranny. The expert and the
      fool shackled together.
    </p>
    <p>
      His dreams mingled the ideal and the material, for he saw
      what his father had not seen, that the ideal is founded on
      the material. Bricks and mortar--yes, creation upon
      creation, not a peevish pulling down, but a passionate
      building up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people who threw beer bottles at beauty!
    </p>
    <p>
      Work? He was going to work like the devil. He was not going
      to stay for ever in a carpenter's shop with men who
      skrimshanked and shilly-shallied and thought it clever to
      cheat. Wasn't it true that the average man loathed work? He
      was a lazy creature wriggling on the horns of necessity and
      always accusing those horns of exploiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was going to save money. He was going to do what old
      Samson had done, though he might do it rather differently.
      A business of his own? Oh, perhaps. Or the firm might
      gather yet another S and become in due season, Samson, Hoad
      &amp; Smith.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He did not see the girl coming along the path; nor did she
      see him. It was her dog, a wire-haired terrier, who
      discovered Keir, and the dog protested. Maybe he felt
      himself responsible, as dogs do.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter, come here."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Peter still growled and objected to the fortuitous
      male.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peter, you silly ass."
    </p>
    <p>
      She appeared before him suddenly, a creature of beautiful
      fairness, slim and self-sure in her short brown skirt and
      knitted coat of apple-green. Her skin had the perfect
      texture of her golden youth, and her hair was like honey.
      She apologized to Keir. She bent down and took the dog by
      the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry. Peter's so self-important."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had been lying prone with a book under his chin. He
      sat up. He was aware of her blue eyes appraising him and
      his clothes. His clothes were passable, and though his hair
      might be a little tumultuous, the cult was prevalent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite all right. I must have startled him."
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice betrayed him to her. Being what she was, she knew
      at once that he did not belong to her world, and though her
      world was far less distant than it had been, he became for
      her at once one of the casual crowd. Keir was just a young
      man with an untidy head and a bicycle, and an environment
      that was not hers. Less than half a century ago at
      Cambridge her father and his fellows had cheerfully spoken
      of all shopmen as cads. Cads on casters.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, Peter. Sorry he was rude to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cold and casual courtesy had other implications. She
      had slipped a leash through the dog's collar, and she swept
      him off, passing away along the grass path to disappear
      beyond one of the green and white may trees. And Keir sat
      there with a little, wincing smile upon his face. To her he
      had been a stranger, but more than a mere stranger, and her
      dog had growled at him.

    <p>
      Now, it happened in June that a patch of tiles came adrift
      on Mr. Lugard's house of Darvels and betrayed to Mr.
      Samson's bricklayer and tiler the rottenness of things
      within. Parsons, the bricklayer, and his mate had put their
      ladders up, but when Parsons examined the scar on the
      Darvels roof, the battening crumbled in his hand. Parsons
      was a red-haired man whose language was apt to be as
      colourful as his hair. He put a big hand into the hole, got
      hold of something, and gave it a twist, and part of a
      rafter came away in his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I'm blowed!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The piece of timber was peppered and tunnelled with worm
      holes. Portions of it looked like yellow parchment, and
      when Parsons tapped it on the ladder, fragments broke away
      and powder flew. Parsons tossed the thing down to his mate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at that, Bill. ---- worm."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hands again into the cavity, groped, and,
      finding more rotten timber, tore it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh, she's eaten to bits."
    </p>
    <p>
      The business was too serious for patching. Mr. Samson was
      sent for, and when Mr. Samson had been up the ladder and
      had investigated, he knew that Mr. Lugard would have to
      find much money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the big worm, Jim. Old Scotch fir, and not squared up
      properly. Here's a bit with the bark on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard was at home, and he and Mr. Samson and the
      bricklayer ascended to the attics. The roof of the
      particular wing was sealed in with lath and plaster, but
      there was a wooden panel in one attic that gave access to
      the eaves. Mr. Samson, bent double and carrying a torch,
      went in to explore. He came out looking rather dusty and
      with cobwebs adhering to his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Absolutely eaten to pieces, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard looked glum.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means a new roof. Good Lord! Wait a bit, I happen to
      know that this wing was re-roofed forty years or so ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson showed him a piece of timber.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps it was, sir. And I guess I know who did it. Oh,
      yes, they're with the worms too--now. Look at that. Green
      Scotch fir with the bark on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard examined the crumbling yellow fragment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The damned scoundrels!"
    </p>
    <p>
      So it became evident that the roof of that particular wing
      would have to be stripped. The job would take at least a
      month even if Mr. Samson put every available man on to it.
      The old tiles would have to be taken down carefully and
      stacked. Luckily the trouble was confined to this one wing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a most infernal nuisance, Samson. What will it cost
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Roughly--three hundred pounds, sir. I'll measure up and
      get out an estimate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had better clear out. Dust and noise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you wouldn't like it much, sir. But it's the right
      time for the job. You were lucky not to have the roof in on
      you last time it snowed."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Mr. Lugard and his wife packed themselves into two cars
      and drove off to Scotland. They left the maids in the
      house, and the firm of Samson &amp; Hoad took possession of
      Darvels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darvels was Queen Anne. It stood about a mile from Kingham
      Bridge, and its garden was protected by the river and an
      old red brick hipped wall. The house itself had the
      beautiful proportions of its period and reminded Keir of
      some of the old houses that he had seen in the Close of
      Salisbury during one of his bicycling holidays. The garden
      was famous for its trees, especially two very old cedars, a
      tulip tree, and a catalpa, and Mr. Lugard, being a man of
      understanding, had swept away certain Victorian adornments
      that had spoilt the completeness of the place, and had
      restored all the sweeping turf and the stately
      separativeness of the trees. The garden of Darvels was an
      eighteenth-century garden, save that Mr. Lugard and his
      wife allowed themselves masses of colour. As at Hampton,
      the red brick walls were covered with every sort of
      creeper, and the walls themselves seemed to rise from the
      flowery foam of the great borders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir understood that Mr. Lugard resented being exiled from
      this garden just when it was coming into summer flower. Mr.
      Samson had put all his carpenters on the job, the two
      outdoor men and the four who worked in the shop. Old Tower
      was in charge, but he was growing too old for roof work,
      and much of the laying out and supervising fell to Keir.
      Moreover, the restoration had been complicated by the
      discovery that the joists of the attic floors were badly
      worm-eaten and that the floors and ceilings of the rooms
      below would have to be replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, up in the roof, had the Darvels garden spread below
      him, and the garden had a life of its own, Mr. Lugard's two
      gardeners, and especially the elder man, regarded the
      activities of Messrs. Samson &amp; Hoad with no friendly
      eyes. The house had a broad, paved walk surrounding it, and
      on the west--under the library windows--a bed of polyantha
      roses was coming into flower. Mr. Samson's men had
      instructions to shoot all the rotten old timber into the
      yard at the back of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had young Scudder working with him up above, he of the
      irresponsible blue eyes and the playful broom, and on the
      second morning Mr. Sydney Scudder allowed a length of
      rotten rafter to crash on the bed of dwarf roses. Cant, the
      head gardener, was mowing grass. He saw the thing crash,
      and there was trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood below, a broad, brown, angry man, and shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hi, you blasted fools up there!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Scudder leaned over the wall and cheeked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Allo, Whiskers, what's wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who dropped that bit of timber on my roses?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Scudder grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did. It just slipped out of my hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cant was not accepting sauce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You--young fool! Hi, Mr. Foreman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Tower happened to be away in the timber store, and the
      business fell to Keir. He walked across the ends of the old
      joists and looked down at Mr. Cant and the smashed roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in complete agreement with Mr. Cant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry. Shouldn't have happened. It won't happen again."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned on Scudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What did you do a damned silly thing like that for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Scudder flared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what the ---- is it to do with you? You ain't the ----
      boss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm in charge when Tom's away."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you're not coming it over me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing we put it to the boss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you ---- sneak."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had a temper, and Scudder's red face was a rag to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here--you cut that out, or I'll have you stood off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Scudder did cut it out, but sullenly so, and there
      was to be another clash between him and Keir, but that was
      not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Darvels garden had something else to display to the men
      working on the roof. Each morning a girl would come out and
      play with Mr. Lugard's dog--an Aberdeen--on one of the
      lawns. Apparently, she had been made responsible for the
      dog and his recreation, and she would throw a ball for him
      and run races. She was the under-housemaid, one Sybil
      Kelsey, a slim, dark creature with long legs and very white
      skin. Her movements suggested the fluttering of a bird, a
      certain happy breathlessness, and it seemed to Keir that
      she played with the dog without any thought of showing off.
      He noticed that she looked but rarely at the men up above.
      She seemed shy of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a graceful thing and her almost childish movements
      intrigued him. He found himself waiting for her to appear,
      and watching her when she came. She was so light on her
      feet, so irresponsible without being hoydenish. Sometimes
      the ball would vanish under the spreading branches of one
      of the cedars, and she and the dog would dive for it
      together. Sometimes she retrieved it; sometimes the dog was
      too quick for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was she always in movement. She had her moments of
      stillness, of absorbed staring. He gathered that she loved
      flowers. He would see her go to one of the borders and
      stand there and look. Sometimes she touched, or put her
      face down to smell. Her touch had the deliberate tenderness
      of a caress.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard one of the other maids come out and call to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sybil--Syb, cocoa's on."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sybil remained with him. He repressed the Syb and the
      cocoa.
    </p>

      Later Keir discovered that young Scudder was always
      sneaking down the ladder and hanging outside the kitchen
      windows. He had further glimpses of young Scudder half in
      and half out of a ground-floor window, and of young Scudder
      being repulsed by a short-tempered and elderly cook. The
      young man reappeared on the roof, smoking a cigarette and
      looking sly. Keir heard him telling one of the other men
      that the old cook was jealous because he had been
      palavering with the girl. Yes, she was a bit of all right,
      and pretending to be shy, but he--Sydney--knew something
      about girls. They didn't stay shy long when you got 'em
      alone in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Darvels gardeners finished work at five, and since
      overtime was being worked on the new roof, some of Mr.
      Samson's men were left on the premises after the gardeners
      had left. A couple of tarpaulins had to be spread each
      night in case of rain, and Mr. Samson would come along
      himself to see that the thing was done, for however clear
      the sky might be, he was taking no risks with Darvels and
      the English weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Scudder, normally shy of overtime, was displaying a
      peculiar enthusiasm in the matter of late hours. He had
      discovered that Sybil Kelsey sometimes appeared in the
      garden after tea to pick flowers, for Mr. Cant was an
      autocrat and would allow none of the women to touch his
      beloved borders. Keir was not blind to the lout's loafing,
      and in a measure he felt responsible for it, for Mr. Samson
      had given Keir orders to see everybody off the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on a Thursday, and the men had left and Keir was
      putting in a last ten minutes sharpening a saw. He had the
      saw clasped in the vice of the carpenter's bench that stood
      on the terrace, and as he drew the file over the saw's
      teeth he was aware of Sybil Kelsey crossing the grass. She
      did not look in his direction. She disappeared beyond the
      yew hedge of the rose garden that lay beyond the cedars,
      and Keir, with a curious little smile, filed away at the
      saw's teeth. A pair of blackbirds were feeding their
      youngsters on the lawn, and it occurred to Keir that a cock
      blackbird--considered as an artist--might resent the
      metallic squawkings of a file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he heard a scream. It came from beyond the yew
      hedge, and Keir's back straightened. He stood and listened,
      and then he saw Sybil Kelsey come running from behind the
      yew hedge. She had two or three roses in one hand and she
      seemed to clutch them. The tumult of her panic was no
      rehearsed provocation; she was in flight like a frightened
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir threw the file down on the bench and went quickly
      across to intercept her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's frightened you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was breathless. Her very dark eyes had a kind of
      blindness. She seemed to hover for a moment in front of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, let me go, please."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right. What's frightened you, kid? Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed the trembling of her long, sensitive lips.
      Almost she stammered and was incoherent. A man had sprung
      out at her. He had been hiding in a recess in the yew hedge
      where the stone seat stood. Yes, one of the workmen, the
      young one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run along, kid. I'll settle that."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other side of the yew hedge he found young Scudder
      looking sheepish and lighting a cigarette, and young
      Scudder glared at Keir with eyes that were like the eyes of
      an angry dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo. What are you butting in for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "---- sneak."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Keir's one and only fight before his marriage, and
      Keir could box. There were no preliminaries. They fell on
      each other like a couple of dogs. Young Scudder was two
      stone heavier than Keir, a husky young lout, but he was not
      so quick on his feet or so coldly furious. Keir got a
      bloody mouth, but he knocked out young Scudder in the first
      half minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now--you clear. I'll have you put off this job tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lout hadn't the guts for a second assault. He could be
      noisy and truculent till someone licked him. And Keir, with
      a splodge of blood on his chin, and a face that was still
      dead white, shepherded Scudder across the lawn and round to
      the back of the house and saw him out by the door of the
      little courtyard into the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was then that he discovered three women in the kitchen
      doorway, the cook, the housemaid, and Sybil. The cook had
      her arm round Sybil. And Keir was annoyed. He was aware of
      his bleeding lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right. I've--settled him. Sorry it happened."
    </p>
    <p>
      All three of them appeared interested in Keir's bleeding
      lip. The cook wanted to bathe it for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Young blackguard--You ought to have that seen to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir shrugged off this sympathy. Young Scudder had a worse
      lip, and an eye that would close before nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing to fuss about. Thanks all the same."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of Sybil Kelsey still holding those roses and
      looking at him with large eyes from the half shadow of the
      doorway. She seemed to have shrunk back behind the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she smiled at him, and her face had for him a
      swift fragrance. Her lips trembled, but no word passed from
      her to Keir.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      That was the beginning of it, Keir's first straggling on
      the line of march, his surrender to a situation that could
      not be sustained by mere enlightened selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was an orphan like himself, and her childhood had not
      been of the happiest. She was a sensitive and a lovable
      thing, quick in her colour and her movements and quite
      unable to resist the appeal of a dog or a flower. She had
      moments of utter absent-mindedness and was always getting
      into trouble with the domestic world of Darvels because of
      it. She would go off into dreams and leave dusters about
      and suddenly forget such things as early morning tea and
      the proper place for a chair or an ornament. She had broken
      one of Mr. Lugard's <i>famille rose</i> bowls, and had wept
      over it and had pleaded to be allowed to pay for the
      damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one ever succeeded in being seriously angry with Sybil.
      The quality of her gaze was so transparent, her emotional
      quality so generous. Animals were devoted to her. Mr.
      Lugard, reflecting upon the girl's forgetfulness and
      omissions, forgave her for them and was wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite responsible? Oh, yes, she is--when things
      matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mrs. Lugard herself was a sensitive, and a
      semi-invalid, and when she was in pain she was glad to have
      Sybil to do things for her. The girl could be kind and
      gentle and full of understanding. She never came noisily
      into a room or stayed too long in it. She was at her best
      when you were feeling sorry for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For two creatures who belonged to the mundane workaday
      world, their coming together was gradual and almost secret.
      Keir remained late each evening, and for two evenings he
      saw nothing of Sybil. She was like a timid bird hiding in a
      hedgerow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the cook who suggested that Mr. Smith might not
      quarrel with a cup of tea. The cook was beyond adventure,
      and the housemaid had a friend of her own, so obviously the
      adventure was Sybil's.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and ask him, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No--I couldn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be silly. He won't eat you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil went. She found Keir at work with mallet and chisel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cook wonders whether you would like a cup of tea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir looked at the girl's short-sighted brown eyes. What
      the devil had she to be afraid of? But almost his shyness
      equalled hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very kind of her. Yes--I should, if I can have it here."
    </p>
    <p>
      She disappeared and returned with a large blue and white
      breakfast cup, and in the saucer a slice of plum cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I put it on the bench?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I've slopped some into the saucer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand was shaking, and her trembling had a strange
      effect on Keir. Perhaps he fell in love with that which
      trembled in her and with the gentle poignancy of her mouth
      and eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No harm done."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--the cake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't be any the worse. How's the dog?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For she was on the edge of flight and he did not want her
      to go. She had become part of the Darvels garden, and more
      than that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Mac. He hasn't been very well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bad luck. You're fond of dogs, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, very."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same here. But I haven't got one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I live in lodgings. And I don't get much time to
      give to a dog. Wouldn't be fair, would it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He found an odd piece of clean floor-board and, putting the
      cake on it, used it as a plate. And she remarked on her
      lack of foresight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How silly! I ought to have brought you a plate. I've got
      such a head."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with sudden intentness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you?--Well--I don't see anything to quarrel with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But she understood him. She coloured up. She became
      confused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll just wait and take the cup back. You know--I've--I've
      not thanked you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About the other evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking at his lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--that! You needn't worry. The young blighter isn't
      coming here again."
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned against the bench, and the fingers of her right
      hand played with some chips that littered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must be stronger--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Than I look!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His smile had a tinge of irony, and she winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no--I didn't mean that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can box a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You--were--angry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I look it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had finished the tea, and he put the cup down on the
      bench. He saw her hand move towards it, and his inspiration
      came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, you are shy of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almost as shy of me--as I am of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      That seemed to surprise her. Also, it seemed to please her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't that funny? Why--are you shy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't quite say.--Well, I had better get on with the
      job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he noticed that same trembling of her hand as she
      picked up the cup.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in a week she had ceased to tremble, or she trembled
      differently. Her tremor was towards him--not away. Each
      evening she brought him out a cup and a plate. She perched,
      and sat on the bench, and she let him come quite near her.
      The cook and the housemaid--good creatures--spying from an
      upper window--saw that the affair was going admirably.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook was just a little troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think he's the chap for her? Seems to me she wants
      one of the big--easy sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      The housemaid had social ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's quite the gent. She wouldn't mix well with the rough
      kind. Besides, you couldn't be unkind to the kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. The thin, dark, busy chaps grow irritable.
      And he's got a temper."
    </p>
    <p>
      The housemaid asserted that she wouldn't look twice at a
      man who hadn't some of the hot stuff in him. And that was
      that.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      On the last Sunday before the Lugard family returned, Keir
      asked Sybil to spend it with him. She possessed a bicycle,
      and he suggested that they should start very early and camp
      out for the day on the hills above Shere. Had she seen the
      Silent Pool? No. And could she ride forty miles a day with
      a long rest between the outward and the homeward journeys?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes--but I ought to ask cook."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's in charge. And it's her Sunday. She might change
      with me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook said that she would like to have a few words with
      Keir, and she had them and was satisfied. She was ready to
      give up the day to Sybil, and on the morning of that
      particular Sunday Sybil woke at five and ran to her window,
      for she had been terribly afraid of the day turning out
      badly, but she saw the Darvels garden lying still and
      secret in the haze of a perfect dawn. Her brown eyes were
      tender. Her impulse towards loving and being loved was like
      wind upon water, an innocent yet passionate urge. She was
      more consciously in love with Keir than he was with her,
      but the day was to prove Keir human.
    </p>
    <p>
      They started soon after eight. Keir had gone shopping the
      night before, and had a special picnic basket on the
      luggage-carrier, and much of its contents owed nothing to
      Mrs. Marter. Both of them took mackintoshes, Sybil's a blue
      one. She was wearing a light blue frock and a little black
      hat. Keir rode on the off side between her and any passing
      traffic, and by ten o'clock they had dismounted and were
      climbing the long hill to Newlands Corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir wheeled both machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tired?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she wasn't tired, but the day was a day of summer heat,
      and Sybil found a blue handkerchief and arranged it under
      her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sun's so hot on my neck."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed over it. She had a pretty neck, creamy and
      soft, and she had let her hair grow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll find plenty of shade up there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their mutual urge was to get away from the crowd, and when
      they came to the grassy spaces and the shadowy woods and
      thickets of the downs, they seemed to draw more close to
      each other. Sybil took charge of her own machine. They
      found themselves holding hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face grew dreamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, isn't it lovely, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with the eyes of a lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's just made for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a little laugh, and her cheek seemed to approach
      his shoulder. She was not afraid of him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's find a wild place all to ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a kind of happy wildness in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found their sanctuary, a grassy hollow close to some
      beech trees and sheltered by thorns, and they parked their
      bicycles against a tree and unpacked. The day was still
      young, so they spread their mackintoshes on the turf and
      sat down close together, and suddenly Keir was shy. He had
      become acutely conscious of the exquisite strangeness of
      this girl, of her slim hands and dark eyes and poignant
      mouth and of that fragrant, creamy skin. He was in love
      with her, and all of her was wonderful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "What small hands you've got, kid!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hid them for a moment under her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They get so rough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nonsense. Let's see."
    </p>
    <p>
      She allowed him to take one of her hands and to reassure
      her. She had spent half an hour manicuring her hands the
      night before.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like pink shells, your nails."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked confused and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For there was a gentle seductiveness about Sybil, and all
      through the sunlight and the shadow and the sleepy heat of
      that summer day her youth and its wonder grew upon Keir.
      They ate their lunch, and there were cherries and jam
      tarts. The lemonade was rather rebellious, and it made them
      laugh. Sybil confessed that she felt sleepy, and actually
      she fell asleep with Keir's jacket rolled up under her
      head. He sat and dreamed and watched her, and felt the
      desire of her stirring in his blood. How very innocent she
      looked! The soft shadows of those long, dark lashes!
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she was awake. She sat up with an air of
      confusion and shook her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you been asleep too?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been watching her, and she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later they left their bicycles hidden in a thicket and went
      down that steep yew-shaded tunnel to the Silent Pool. The
      water had a tinge of blue in it, and fish were swimming.
      The sunlight hung in the tree-tops, but there were too many
      people here, and the pool had lost its silence. They
      clambered along the little steep paths where the wild box
      trees were fragrant in the summer heat. They looked at the
      water and the fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they could not hold hands here or let their bodies
      touch, for their mutual sensitiveness was confused by the
      crowd. Children were chasing each other and shouting. Two
      small boys were searching for stones to throw at the fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at that big un, Bert."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Slosh him."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden almost irritable fierceness in Keir's
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why can't people teach their damned kids--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked poignant. Quickly compassionate and suddenly
      courageous, she went and spoke to the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't throw stones at the fish."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boys scorned her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you take no notice of her, Bert. She can't do
      nothing to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir rescued her from the impasse, slipping a hand under
      her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's get away, Sybil. I might feel like chucking one of
      those kids into the water."
    </p>
    <p>
      They wandered away, returning to the steep hillside and the
      shadows of the yews, and the wilderness was theirs once
      more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had brought a thermos with him and a couple of cups,
      and they spread themselves again in that green nook among
      the thorn trees. They could hear the Sunday traffic passing
      in the valley along the Guildford-Dorking road, but on this
      wooded bluff they felt themselves far from the world. Now
      and again they heard the voices and the laughter of people
      passing along the Pilgrims' Way, but no other lovers
      disturbed them. Keir found a packet of cigarettes and
      offered Sybil one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never smoked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded at him. It was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I shouldn't begin now. Believe you feel sleepy
      again, kid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, just dreamy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rolled up his coat and put it under her head, and as he
      did so, he realized that he had not kissed her yet. He
      wanted to kiss her, but he was afraid, most strangely
      afraid of the mystery of her beauty. Keir had read his war
      books, and he knew that in them sex could not be accused of
      a sensitive diffidence. In them love did not look and
      marvel and hold back, but sprang like an animal upon its
      prey. Yet his feeling towards Sybil was tinged with
      compassion, a tenderness that was ever present when beauty
      moved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat staring at the greenness of one of the thorn trees,
      his arms clasping his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do look serious, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were half-closed. The soft, virginal curves of her
      breasts showed as she lay. One black leg was crossed over
      the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--am--serious, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put out a hand, palm upwards, and suddenly he turned
      and, bending, put his lips into the hollow of that hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her other hand touched his head. Her face was a blur of
      soft desire. She was far less complex than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knelt and looked at her, and she smiled at him, and her
      arms seemed to open.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      They lay close, face to face, and body to body. He felt the
      soft pressure of her breasts. She clung to him exquisitely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--"
    </p>
    <p>

      The Borough of Kingham was becoming suburban, though there
      were a few green fields left between it and the flux of
      London. It had the river flung across its loins like a
      silver girdle of chastity, and the turf and the bracken and
      the trees of Richmond were still near and green and
      inviolate. Westwards there were other notable and stately
      spaces, relics of regal days, refusing to be swallowed up
      by new little cardboard suburbs. Kingham had a market of
      its own, and an Assize Court, and a High Street that was
      crowded with people whose need was cheapness. It had a
      Woolworth's Store, and obsolete trams, and incessant
      traffic, and two very considerable picture-houses, one of
      which had christened itself "The Elite." Kingham could
      provide you with anything from a Morris Cowley to a penny
      packet of nasturtium seed, but in the matter of houses it
      was a little cramped.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the new houses, they had sprung up on one or two
      estates, and they had cost anything from eight hundred to
      two thousand pounds to build. They were sold or let to city
      workers or local tradesmen or elderly people who had
      retired. These new estates represented a middle-class
      community. Certainly the Borough of Kingham had a
      housing-scheme of its own, cottages that let at from twelve
      to eighteen shillings a week with the rates included, but
      the prospective tenants formed a long waiting list. There
      would be as many as ten applicants for each new cottage,
      and preference was given to people with children.
    </p>
    <p>
      This problem of a house was both tantalizing and
      unexpected. Keir had helped to erect quite a number of
      houses, but he had not proposed to inhabit one. He had
      regarded marriage as a state that might be contemplated in
      the far future when his position in the social scheme
      should be more what he intended it to be. Marriage might be
      a spur, but more often it was a rope round a man's legs.
      His urge had been to save money, to get his hands on the
      rungs and climb.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the sacrament of marriage was being forced upon him by
      the gentle seductiveness of Sybil and by the enthusiasms
      and the ardour of Sybil. She was a creature to whom it was
      not easy to refuse things, and a creature whom Keir would
      have found it impossible to betray. He was very much in
      love with her, or as much in love as a self-centred young
      man could be. Her dark-eyed, poignant eagerness enveloped
      him. The locks of the young Samson were to lose some of
      their sanctity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil wanted a house and she wanted children. Keir was to
      be astonished by the eagerness with which she desired a
      child, and he was not attracted by children. Moreover, she
      assumed that he desired a house and children as ardently as
      she did. She saw him as a dear fellow conspirator.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, won't it be lovely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was such a warm-blooded and pretty creature that he was
      seduced by her domestic enthusiasms even as he had been
      persuaded by her poignant mouth and clinging hands. The
      workshop was growing facetious at his expense, though lout
      Scudder had been extruded from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bought a pram yet, Smithie?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was not one of those who could be easily facetious. He
      did not encourage confidences; he was apt to resent them,
      and his young, dark reticence was misunderstood. There were
      times when other men spoke of him as a sidey young swine.
      Keir had a lot to learn. A girl and a pram would teach him
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lugard was being kind to Sybil. She allowed her two
      evenings off a week, and Keir would put on his Sunday
      clothes and go house-hunting with his future wife. They
      explored every corner of Kingham, but every niche in the
      borough appeared to be occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir suggested lodgings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We might manage for a year and put our names down for one
      of the borough houses."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil looked poignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Keir, not lodgings. I don't mind how tiny the place
      is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't we get a cottage built? Mr. Samson might help
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had to repress that suggestion. You might be a good
      employee, but Mr. Samson was not to be antagonized by being
      pushed into too much altruism. Mr. Samson was not the man
      who believed in lifting young people over gates. Let them
      climb their own gate. Nor did Keir want to sink his savings
      in a house and be beholden to some building society at the
      rate of six per cent on borrowed money.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "There's the furniture. That will be as much as I
      can manage for the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was twenty-three and she had been in service for five
      years, but she had not saved a sixpence, and if she had she
      would not have been Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Samson himself who directed Keir to Paragon
      Place. One of his bricklayers, Tom Santer, had occupied No.
      3 Paragon Place, and after twenty years of thrift had
      bought a cottage of his own. Keir might be able to snaffle
      No. 3. Keir gave up half of one dinner-hour in order to go
      and survey Paragon Place, and when he had seen it he
      loathed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paragon Place belonged to Victorian Kingham. It was a
      strand in a spider's web of obscure and ugly little
      streets. It was built of yellow brick, and every cottage
      had the same flat, bilious face, the same two windows at
      the front and back. Each door was artificially grained and
      had a top-light of cheap blue and yellow stained glass. A
      brick wall, with cast-iron railings perched on it, ran the
      whole length of the row. There were iron gates and minute
      front gardens.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the place had a kind of tired squalor. It suggested
      casual labour and casual ladies in caps, and when Keir
      found a passage and explored the hinterland of Paragon
      Place he discovered just what he had expected, little back
      gardens decorated with every sort of improvisation in the
      way of wireless poles and sheds, fences that were made up
      of old egg-boxes and bedstead frames, iron advertisement
      plates, and discarded galvanized sheeting. There were
      clothes lines, and tin baths hanging up on nails. At the
      back of No. 4 a fat woman was banging a frowsy doormat
      against a wall. Some of the gardens possessed flowers,
      dahlias and autumn asters, or perhaps a row of runner
      beans, but the general atmosphere was squalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paragon Place symbolized all those mean makeshifts from
      which Keir was passionately determined to escape. It was
      not that Paragon Place was impossible merely because of its
      ugliness; it was impossible to Keir because it had been
      built by a man without vision, for people who had not been
      taught to see. Keir was under no illusions as to the kind
      of neighbours he might expect to have in Paragon Place.
      Thirty years ago it had been inhabited by better-class
      working people, but now it was a corner to which the casual
      and the careless tended to drift.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not see himself and Sybil in No. 3 next to the
      frowsy woman with the doormat, but he did tell Sybil that
      there was a house available.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the place for you, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sybil asked him to take her to see Paragon Place, and
      she was far less conscious of its ugliness than he was. The
      tenant of No. 3 allowed them to go over the house. It had a
      front parlour and a kitchen and three small bedrooms, and
      it had been kept in good condition by Santer and his wife.
      They were decent, quiet, and rather old-fashioned people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil's enthusiasm was already active in the house. Her
      short-sighted eyes were less restive than Keir's and were
      not so aware of the nearness of all those neighbours. The
      Santer's back garden was one of the few flowery and
      self-respecting plots in the place, and Sybil thought the
      view from the kitchen window quite pretty. Both the Santers
      were slightly deaf and, having lived for twenty years or so
      in Paragon Place, were inclined to be lenient towards
      noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Santer gave them tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shouldn't be moving, my dear, but Tom does want a bit
      more garden. We've got a bit more ground at the new place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was reticent and guarded. He could not very well tell
      these good people just what he thought of the place they
      had lived in all these years. They were used to it. They
      belonged to a previous generation. But when he closed the
      iron gate he was aware of Sybil looking quite possessively
      at No. 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not such a bad little place, Keir. I don't see why it
      shouldn't do to begin with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, of course--it's not like one of the new cottages,
      but it would be--ours, wouldn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Ours! Yes, that was the magic word, but in those early days
      Keir was not fully wise to the child behind the brown eyes
      of Sybil. Life to her was a kind of playground, and perhaps
      all the toys in her particular playbox would appear
      wonderful. She had not the urge that obsessed him, or her
      urges were different. She was quite uncritical. She would
      stand in front of a shop-window and think the furniture was
      lovely, furniture that Keir suspected of being trash.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't say I like the neighbourhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But where else can we go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had him there; not triumphantly so, but with a kind of
      seductive, intimate innocence. Certainly she was not a
      snob, and assuredly she was easy to please. And perhaps her
      vivid eagerness cast a glamour over the place for Keir. In
      one of those little rooms he and Sybil would sleep
      together. Those other poignant intimacies would be made
      possible. He wanted Sybil, and he knew that she wanted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's going to be your house, kid. Call it the
      halfway house, if you like. I've got other ideas for the
      future."
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed his arm. Of course he had, and so had she, but
      perhaps--like many a girl before her--she was moved by the
      lore of Eve--to make sure of her man.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      When Keir began to explore the financial aspect of the
      adventure he realized that the cheapness of Paragon Place
      was in its favour. No. 3 was rented at 10/6 a week, with
      the rates included, and he supposed that it would be
      sufficient for them to furnish the kitchen and parlour and
      one bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spent an evening in his bed-sitting-room working out a
      budget, though its details were somewhat theoretical. He
      had had very little experience of domestic ways and means.
    </p>
    <p>
      His weekly budget ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      Rent and rates 10/6
    </p>
    <p>
      Clothing. Self 2/6
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil 3/6
    </p>
    <p>
      Insurances 1/4
    </p>
    <p>
      Housekeeping--at 15-each 1£ 10/0
    </p>
    <p>
      Gas 1/6
    </p>
    <p>
      Coal 1 cwt. 2/0
    </p>
    <p>
      Holidays 1/6
    </p>
    <p>
      Tobacco 1/0
    </p>
    <p>
      Sundries 2/6
    </p>
    <p>
      2£ 16/4
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There were many omissions in this budget, but he was not
      aware of them at the time. He had allowed nothing for soap
      and cleaning materials, for repairs to shoes and boots, for
      matches and firewood, for the possible advent of children.
      He had estimated the housekeeping costs at fifteen
      shillings a head without considering the multifarious
      details, or the muddle Sybil would make of them to begin
      with. His earnings totalled some four pounds a week, and he
      could place his savings at a pound a week. Certainly, he
      would have to spend less on books, but in Sybil he would
      have a book more enthralling than a whole circulating
      library.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not that Keir was mean. He was adding to his
      responsibilities, but he had not renounced his ambition,
      that urge towards separativeness and independence. He had
      his vision. He saw no reason why he should not become a
      member of the firm or the master of a business of his own.
      He was not a union man. He knew that if he saved money and
      gained in experience and grip, he might make himself
      somehow inevitable. Mr. Samson had no children, and Mr.
      Hoad--Sneak Hoad, as the men called him--had one small
      daughter, and the firm was prosperous, and since it
      employed no union labour, it was not obstructed by having
      to haggle with local trade secretaries. Certainly, there
      had been attempts to rope the men in, but old Samson was
      still John Bull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actually, Keir did sound Mr. Samson on the subject. He said
      that he was saving money, and that he was ready to serve
      his term and gather experience--but would there be any
      chance--? Old Samson eyed him with quizzical gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Want to be one of the exploiters, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not afraid of responsibility, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that's it--that's the whole thing in a nutshell. A
      man's got to make himself fit to give orders. Most men only
      make themselves fit to take them. Well, yes--I've got it in
      mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's dark eyes smouldered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means a lot to me, sir. I'd make it my business not
      to let the firm down. I shall have seen the inside of
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson smiled down his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Getting married, aren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. But I don't think that will make any difference."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not--Keir. A working man's--job--is so much tied
      up with his wife. More so--these days--I think--. Is
      she--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's been in service. She's keen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a shop girl. Well, that's all to the good. She ought
      to know how to manage.--Just one thing, Keir. Don't think
      I'm meddling--but if a chap's going to rise--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Keir kindly, and Keir understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "She's one of the gentle sort, and
      quick--sensitive--you know. She'd like things nice--but I
      think she'd always be ready to work for them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson said: "Well, that's the stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir arranged to take over No. 3 Paragon Place from the
      Santers, who were moving into the new cottage on the 1st of
      October, and Sybil and Keir fixed their wedding for the
      first Saturday in October. It was to be a very quiet and
      inexpensive affair at St. John's Church, Kingham. An uncle
      of Sybil's who was door-porter at one of the big London
      stores had promised to come down and give her away. Keir
      had trouble in finding a best man, but he persuaded one of
      Mr. Samson's painters to act for him. He would have been
      quite satisfied if the ceremony had been performed at a
      register office, but Sybil wanted to be married in a
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile there was the furniture to be bought. The
      honeymoon was to be limited to a long week-end at Hastings,
      and Sybil and Keir had decided that No. 3 should be
      furnished and ready to receive them on their return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was full of ideas on furnishing--or, rather, she had
      absorbed her ideas from the windows of Messrs. Bond &amp;
      Beaverbrook, Kingham's universal providers. She dreamed in
      suites. She wanted mahogany for the parlour, yes, and a
      Chesterfield sofa, and painted wood for one bedroom.
      Messrs. Bond &amp; Beaverbrook stocked a series of
      standardized suites at standardized prices, though they
      labelled them with various names--"The Hampton," "The
      Richmond," "The Twickenham." Sybil led Keir to the
      slaughter. Her enthusiasm was a little flushed and
      self-important.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--we could do it on the installment system. Isn't
      'The Richmond' just sweet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had visualized their operations as a careful selection
      of specimens purchased at various less impressive shops.
      Bargains? Well, not exactly that, perhaps. He had supposed
      that some of the necessities could be purchased
      second-hand. A bedstead might be just as good a bedstead
      even though somebody else had slept on it, and an hour or
      two's work with a brush and a pot of enamel would put the
      thing right. But Sybil's naïve enthusiasm for the new home
      was--like her person--innocently seductive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, cash down, kid. No installment business. Besides--we
      should get a discount for cash."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had an arm linked in his, and she held him to the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does seem a lot of money, Keir, doesn't it? But, after
      all, it's common sense to buy good things. They'll last us
      a lifetime."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we've got to think of having a better cottage. Oh--I
      do want you to have a glass-fronted bookcase for your
      books."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can do with something simple. I can make it myself, if
      it comes to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She squeezed his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you could, Keir. Aren't you clever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The furnishing of No. 3 Paragon Place cost Keir some ninety
      pounds. Sybil had her "Richmond" suite for the bedroom, at
      the price of £12.13.6. The parlour, with a Chesterfield
      sofa, and two easy chairs at two guineas each, proved more
      expensive than the bedroom. The kitchen furniture was of
      white wood and included a cupboarded dresser at £2.11.6, a
      table, three Windsor chairs, and an additional cupboard.
      But, as in public finance, it was the supplementary
      estimates that upset the balance of Keir's budget. It had
      never occurred to him that a small house could develop such
      a capacity for assimilating inorganic matter. There were
      carpets, linoleum, curtains, yards and yards of cretonne;
      linen, some of it in threes, some of it in sixes; bedroom
      crockery, fenders, kitchen utensils. The kitchen was an
      absolute ogre in its appetite; there were articles that
      Keir had never seen before and did not know the use of.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the dickens is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A whisk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was the china and the cutlery and the silver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must have a clock, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What for? Won't our watches do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everybody has a clock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the kitchen. All right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We ought to have one in the--the drawing-room, too,
      really."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That can wait a bit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. Let me look at my list again. Mats, a doormat,
      two doormats. Let's see--we have done the blankets, haven't
      we?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blessed if I can remember. Anyway, we shall want them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a small mangle or wringer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was getting tired. He had said yes to so many things
      with a sense of their inevitableness, but when Sybil was
      tempted by the serpent to covet a mahogany gramophone
      cabinet, Keir stood firm. In his case the serpent had taken
      the shape of a most persuasive and talkative young salesman
      whose motto was: "You find the girl, sir; we find
      everything else." Almost Keir came to hate that young man
      with his facile smile and his infernal catalogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think that's about our limit, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, and sensing a vague restiveness in her Adam, Sybil
      refrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You--have--been good to me, Keir. Won't it be lovely
      arranging all the things? Our things."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was such a happy, seductive creature.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had been saving money for the last five years, and
      when he had to cash a wad of Savings Certificates to pay
      for the furnished felicities of the new home, he understood
      that it would take him at least two years to make the
      damage good. But he was not in a mood to regret it. After
      all, the act was very much to his credit. He had been able
      to walk into Messrs. Bond &amp; Beaverbrook's and behave
      like a man of property. He had laid the foundations of a
      home, both sentimentally and in reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was very much in love with Sybil, and Sybil was very
      much in love with him. Her enthusiasms could be personal.
      She thought Keir a rather wonderful person, and she showed
      it, and no man quarrels with a plumed hat when it is placed
      on his head by such eager hands. Keir felt pleasantly
      self-important, and Sybil was so sure that she could make
      life pleasant for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was impulsive and affectionate. She told him that cook
      was giving her lessons in the Darvels kitchen, and that she
      was making famous progress, though her first cake had had
      to be smuggled into the Darvels dustbin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do want you to be comfortable, Keir. I'm going to be so
      busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      His vision of her active in No. 3 Paragon Place was a happy
      one. Every evening he would come home to Sybil. He saw
      himself sitting in one of those two-guinea chairs, smoking
      a pipe and reading, while Sybil sewed. He supposed that all
      women sewed. And they would have their bicycles, and on
      Sundays they could set out together on those pleasant
      pilgrimages into the country, and it seemed to him that
      every Sunday would be like that wonderful Sunday on the
      hills above Shere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the old Santers had decided to vacate No. 3 and
      to move into their new cottage at an earlier date, and
      Sybil discovered that she would like the little parlour and
      the best bedroom repapered. Keir interviewed his new
      landlord, a retired ironmonger, who had found to his cost
      that cottage property could be more bother than it was
      worth. He owned six of the cottages in Paragon Place and
      was always trying to sell them. He was curt with Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What! New wallpaper! I did the cottage up inside three
      years ago, and it's in good order."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir said that his wife wanted new paper, and that if the
      landlord would provide the paper, he would get the hanging
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Expect me to waste money, do you, just because a young
      woman's got ideas? Nothing doing. I don't get three per
      cent on those damned cottages."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Keir agreeing with Sybil that the wallpaper previously
      selected by the old Santers was utterly hideous, bought new
      paper himself from Samson &amp; Hoad and paid one of Mr.
      Samson's painters and paperhangers to hang the paper for
      him. He decided to do the painting himself on Saturday
      afternoon. Sybil had been allowed to choose the paper, and
      she had selected a flower pattern that was rather highly
      coloured. Keir would have preferred a plain buff or pale
      lemon lining paper, but he allowed Sybil her <i>couleur de
      rose.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Going round one Saturday afternoon to Paragon Place, two
      days after the Santers had moved out, and carrying a
      four-pound pot of cream paint and an old attaché case that
      contained brushes, an apron, a putty-knife, sandpaper, and
      other accessories, a coincidence introduced him to one of
      his next-door neighbours. Happening to look out of the
      kitchen window, he saw a man in what was now
      his--Keir's--back garden. The man had a spade and was
      digging up something. Keir watched him for a moment. The
      man was removing one of the rhubarb stools that the Santers
      had left in a corner near an old shed at the end of the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir opened the back door and challenged the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo--what's the idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man swung round rather like some large beast, and to
      Keir his appearance suggested a rogue elephant. Even his
      trousered legs were like the legs of an elephant. He had
      little, evil eyes, a vastness of shoulder and of belly, a
      nose that was both long and flattened and red at the tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stared at Keir. He was one Mr. William Block, a
      casual labourer, and very casual at that, and the husband
      of the frowsy lady whom Keir had seen banging a mat against
      the wall. He appeared quite unabashed by Keir's challenge.
      In fact he met it with a suggestion of truculence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Takin' somethin' what's mine--that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir walked down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's that? I've taken on this place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Quite deliberately the man resumed his disinterring of the
      rhubarb root.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Tom gave it t'me."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lie, but Keir could not nail it as such. Mr. Block
      got hold of the stool by the stalks, lifted it, dropped it
      over the fence, wiped a hand on the seat of his trousers,
      and spat. Then he looked at Keir in a particular sort of
      way. The other tenants of Paragon Place were wise as to
      that look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any complaints?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir flushed slightly. He was beginning to feel more than
      unfriendly to this great sodden, swaggering hulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you'll keep out of here in the future."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man showed him an assortment of very rotten teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bit cocky, aren't you? You keep yer sauce to yerself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung one large leg over the improvisation that was a
      fence. It was his fence, and he said so. The second leg
      followed the first, but he had left his spade behind. He
      told Keir to remedy the omission.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chuck it over, Mr. Little-un."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir chucked it over and went back to No. 3.
    </p>

    <p>
      A sociologist might have found much to interest him in
      Paragon Place, and Keir, who had to live in Paragon Place
      without studying it impartially and objectively, was open
      to prejudice, but since all active living is prejudiced,
      Keir's fundamental fastidiousness reacted to reality. He
      was to suffer in Paragon Place because of his fellow human
      beings. They disliked the smoulder and the separateness of
      him, and he could not help being what he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sweep named Moore lived at No. 1, and the name was
      apposite, for Mr. Moore was perennially black, but when he
      washed and appeared in his back garden, he was very much
      white. In fact Keir and Mr. Moore were never in conflict.
      Contact with soot appeared to have made the man more
      sensitive to other cleanliness. He had a decent little
      round robin of a wife, and no children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jervis, a jobbing gardener, inhabited No. 2, a man who put
      on a sly civility when he went out to work, and took it off
      again directly he reached home.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 4 was Block, William and Bertha, with two tow-haired
      boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      A municipal dustman occupied No. 5, a lorry-driver No. 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 7, significantly seven, was the hot-spot of Paragon
      Place. Here lived a Mrs. Job and her two daughters,
      strapping young wenches who sometimes worked in a laundry
      and were also public property as ladies of the town. No. 7
      was referred to by the local wits as "Job Lot."
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 8 was inhabited by a painter, one Phelps, who had at
      one time worked for Messrs. Samson &amp; Hoad, until his
      political proclivities had made him a sore spot in the
      firm's affairs. Phelps was a communist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The remaining cottages, numbered nine to twenty-five,
      housed no fewer than five workers who were on the dole.
      Keir never came into active contact with any of their
      occupants, but he was known to them and to Mr. Phelps as a
      blackleg.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paragon Place began to become seriously interested in Keir
      and Sybil when a green van arrived from Messrs. Bond &amp;
      Beaverbrook's with the young people's furniture. Sybil had
      been given a free day, and Keir had knocked off work at one
      o'clock, for this was a very great occasion. They were to
      be married on the Saturday, and they wanted to put No. 3
      in, order so that it should be ready for them after a four
      days' honeymoon. The neighbours were provoked by the
      appearance of the green van. Mrs. Jervis's little black
      head could be seen at her parlour window. Mrs. Block was
      more bovine and less in ambush. She came and stood at her
      front door and watched the operations and was inclined to
      be friendly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded her frowsy head at Sybil, who was flushed and
      excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All new."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was all very new.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got a pee-anno, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be kep' busy paying th' installments."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil, anxiously watching the men inserting a new oak
      wardrobe through the front entrance, remarked rather
      casually to Mrs. Block that all the furniture was paid for,
      and Mrs. Block misunderstood the casualness of Sybil.
      Stuck-up young bit of goods. And all this swanky new
      furniture! Mrs. Block's sandy head was apt to be irritable.
      She scratched it and went to the back of No. 4 to exchange
      confidences with the lady of No. 5.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seen all the new furniture coming in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 5 had not. She was a tired little woman who had borne
      many children, and she lived in awe of Mrs. Block.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reg'lar fancy show. Quite--the lidy. Sort that says: 'Mind
      the paint, please.' They're a couple."
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 5 blinked faded eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I dare say they feel as fresh as paint. Let 'em
      wait till they have a few kids kicking the chair legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Block laughed. She had a very loud laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if you ask me--I'm not so pleased to 'ave them for
      neighbours. And what did they want to come 'ere for? A
      van-load of swanky new furniture. So refained!"
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 5 supposed that it was not easy for a young couple to
      find a vacant cottage in Kingham, and Mrs. Block was still
      scratching her head. She said: "Mrs. Santer was a decent
      body. You could borrow 'alf a loaf from 'er--at a pinch.
      Give me folk you can be neighbourly with."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir and Sybil were two innocents, so whole-heartedly
      absorbed in the business of dressing the new home that it
      occurred to neither of them that their affairs could be of
      any serious significance to the people next door. They were
      not conscious of having neighbours. Keir had been laying
      carpets in the parlour and the front bedroom so that the
      furniture could be carried in and placed just where Sybil
      wanted it. She fluttered about, directing operations and
      getting in the way, but the two men from Messrs. Bond &amp;
      Beaverbrook's were as fatherly as the firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we put the bed up for you, miss?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil blushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shan't want it till next week, you know. We are to be
      married on Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      The men thought Keir a lucky fellow, going to bed with a
      pretty thing like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Best of luck, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was calling down the stairs to Keir, who was carrying
      a roll of linoleum into the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, the gentlemen have offered to put up the bed. Shall
      they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes. I want to get this linoleum down before the
      kitchen things come in."
    </p>
    <p>
      By five o'clock the men were bundling the wrappings back
      into the van, and Keir and Sybil were alone together in No.
      3.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said one of the men, with a knowing look at his mate:
      "Well, if I was that chap--I'd christen that bed--straight
      off," and he closed the green doors of the van with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil had brought a small suitcase with her to No. 3, and
      the suitcase contained a thermos, some sandwiches, and two
      slices of Darvels cake. She was the happy mistress of the
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's have tea in the parlour, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      She collected some of the new china, and sitting on the
      Chesterfield sofa, they christened the parlour of No. 3. It
      was very full of the new furniture, so full that there was
      very little room to move. In fact, one of the two-guinea
      armchairs had had to be exiled temporarily to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sybil was full of enthusiasm and ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We can have it in the bedroom, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The congestion's' pretty serious up there. It's a good
      thing you're not stout, kid, or you'd get caught between
      the bed and the dressing-table."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil refilled his cup from the thermos.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But isn't it lovely, Keir? And it's all ours."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Three golden days in October. They could not have been more
      fortunate in the weather or in their lodgings, and when
      Keir slipped out of bed on that Sunday morning and pulled
      up the blind, he found that the sea was visible, a pearly,
      flickering sea. A friend of his at Kingham who had
      recommended him these lodgings had assured him that the
      landlady was not a liar. Keir stood there for a moment with
      an untidy head of hair, and his eyes at gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fine day, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of Sybil stirring in the bed, and both
      sound and movement were seductive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the time, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch on the dressing-table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just after seven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We needn't get up yet. Come back, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of her smiling at him, and of her hand turning
      the bed-clothes back. The whiteness of it seemed to open
      like the petals of a flower. He lowered the blind and
      slipped into the bed. Her warm, soft body pressed itself
      against his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll be tired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, I shan't. Besides, does it matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      When the little struggle was over, they fell asleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      They spent the morning wandering along the sea-front and
      sitting on the beach. It was an idle, happy, desultory day,
      with the sea in an innocent mood, and Keir picked up flat
      pebbles and played at ducks and drakes. He made one stone
      leap seven times on the surface of that calm sea, but when
      Sybil tried her hand at the game, her stones plunged and
      sank.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They won't skidder for me, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with the benevolence of the young male.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not your job."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was happily obsessed by the youth and the sex and the
      silk of her. She was still so fresh and strange to him; she
      had both roused and assuaged the sweet anguish of sex. The
      illusion of her strangeness lasted for him through those
      three October days, and remembering them in later years, he
      would wonder at the thing called love. It was like a plant
      from which the beautiful petals suddenly fell, but if you
      had patience and pity, it would put forth other flowers
      that were less vivid, but more deeply scented and enduring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, can't loaf all day."
    </p>
    <p>
      He dragged her up, feeling himself very much man and her
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where are we going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To see the old town."
    </p>
    <p>
      They discovered that part of Hastings that still fished and
      smelt of tar and spread nets on the shingle and hung its
      tackle in queer black wooden towers. They explored the old
      town, and Keir was interested in the timber-work of some of
      the old houses. They climbed up to High Wickham and
      wandered over the grassy slopes and sat down close to the
      cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funny to think that France is over there."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat with an arm round her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps we'll travel some day, kid. I don't see life as
      all Kingham. How do you say: 'I love you' in French?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil didn't know, so he kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Monday they took seats in a motor-coach and drove to
      Winchelsea and Rye, returning by the upland road past Brede
      Broad Oak. Sussex was deeply green and preparing for the
      golden festival of her oaks. They had glimpses of the blue
      sea, and Keir sat with his arm round his young wife. It was
      the end of the season, and they had the back seat of the
      coach to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "I shall remember all this, Syb. It's been
      wonderful, hasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She snuggled up against him, and her face had a dreamy,
      tender tranquillity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wonderful, Keir; I'm so happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same here."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      On their first Saturday in No. 3 Paragon Place Keir knocked
      off work at one, for No. 3 and Sybil needed him. There was
      a new plate-rack to be fixed in the scullery. Also, the
      little shed at the end of the garden, taken over at a price
      from old Santer, was to hold their bicycles, but it had a
      leaky roof, and Keir had bought six yards of rubberoid to
      re-cover the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      October was still giving the world a little summer, and
      when Keir went out with the roll of rubberoid, a hammer,
      and a packet of galvanized nails, he was not the only Adam
      in that multiple paradise. Mr. Moore was out with a white
      face and busy with a fork, lifting the last two rows of a
      potato crop. At No. 6 the lorry-driver was erecting a
      minute hutch sufficiently large to house a motor-bike.
    </p>
    <p>
      The garden of No. 4 was empty, and Keir, placing the roll
      of rubberoid on the roof, went back for a kitchen chair to
      be used as a stepping-block. He climbed up on the roof of
      the shed and became busy, and since his back was turned
      towards the cottages, he did not see the two Block children
      come out into the next garden. Their ages were ten and
      eight, their names Sydney and Harold. Both of them had tow
      hair and little, hard, red faces, blue eyes, and depressed
      noses.
    </p>
    <p>
      How it was that these children divined the fact that in
      Keir they had a victim might be put forward as a problem in
      elementary psychology. As children they were elementals.
      Any cat that ventured within a stone's throw of them had
      cause to regret it, but if any local cat sighted the two
      boys, it--if it had been educated--vanished over the
      nearest fence or disappeared into its own back door.
    </p>
    <p>
      These children had Keir marked. He was a new animal in the
      way of a neighbour, and, as such, fair game. Moreover, the
      Block boys enjoyed a certain immunity by reason of their
      father, with whom milder men had found it unadvisable to
      quarrel. The elder of the two, picking up a stone, took aim
      and hit the closed door of the shed just below Keir's right
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, turning sharply, discovered the two urchins, who,
      with eyes like blue pebbles, stood to brazen the act out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo--which of you two threw that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the kind of situation which the Block children
      loved to create.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Threw what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder of the two had modelled himself upon his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you speaking to? I never threw no stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir looked at the younger brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I never threw no stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of you did."
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder boy took up the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Ere, mister, you keep your 'air on. You never saw either
      on us throw a stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call us liars. You be careful or I'll fetch my dad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went on with his work. He was sufficiently sensitive
      to size up a ridiculous situation and to know that such
      situations are best dealt with by a show of indifference.
      He ignored the Block children, but for some ten minutes
      they remained in the back garden, watching Keir at work and
      making comments. Their remarks were personal and candid.
      They giggled. Their inspiration was to stir up the man
      creature until he lost his temper and made some unadvised
      and tumultuous attack. Then, of course, they would bolt
      incontinently for the Block back door, shouting loudly for
      their parents.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Watch 'im 'it 'is finger, 'arold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gosh, if 'e ain't got a 'ole in the seat of 'is trousers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mister, y'shirt's showin'."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir continued to ignore them, until Mrs. Block, suddenly
      appearing with a grievance against life in general and a
      husband who hadn't brought the weekly money home, found
      herself articulate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Syd--. 'arold. Come in at once. Leave--the
      gen'leman--alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Block children went. They were wise as to this other
      situation. Dad had not come home, which meant Dad had gone
      on the booze, and at such times their mother could become a
      frowsy-headed fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir completed the re-roofing of the shed, and as his
      hammer drove home the nails, he found himself supposing
      that the garden of No. 3 was not a place in which he would
      ever take his pleasure. It was too elementally situated. It
      was not a piece of God's earth upon which you could
      cultivate peace, potatoes, and philosophy. It was too
      public, too much like a pen with other cattle-pens crowded
      up against it. Raw, sour earth, and little cruel faces
      growing up out of the black soil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil, who had been busy altering the curtains in the front
      bedroom, and hanging some pictures in the parlour, knew
      nothing of Keir's adventure with the Block children, but at
      tea he appeared to have something on his mind. He sat and
      stared at the loaf of bread, but not as though he saw it as
      bread. His face made Sybil think of someone looking out of
      a dark window, and in the future she was to come to know
      this look so well and to fear it, while finding in her fear
      a strange and elemental pity. The perplexities and secret
      grievings that were to trouble her love for this intense
      and smouldering creature who was her husband were to grow
      at last into an understanding of him, but that was not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Got a headache, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He came out of his dark mood to speak to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I was just thinking that the back garden is not going
      to be much use to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No decent fences."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a little puzzled. She was not wise as yet to the
      passionate separatist in Keir, nor did she understand his
      sensitiveness to people, and especially to ugly people. She
      was much more a social creature than he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--you won't have much time, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to grow flowers. I'll be gardener. I wonder if we
      could get a few wallflowers to put in. Yes, and some
      forget-me-nots and red daisies."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir said that at Kingham market all sorts of plants could
      be bought quite cheaply. The front garden certainly needed
      dressing, but as it was no larger than a good-sized
      tablecloth, it could be dealt with at no great expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll raise all my own plants next year, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not damp her enthusiasm, but he did say that when
      they moved into a better cottage, the garden of that
      cottage should have proper defence against too much
      neighbourliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was their first Saturday night in No. 3 Paragon Place,
      and Paragon Place was to impress upon them other
      exhibitions of neighbourliness. The cottages had been built
      for cheapness, and the dividing walls were only one brick
      thick. Mr. Jervis next door was a wireless enthusiast, and
      on Saturday nights he allowed himself a special occasion
      with the apparatus at full blast. The Santers had both been
      slightly deaf, and the bellowings and crashings had not
      worried them. Sybil had lit a fire in the sitting-room, and
      Keir had got out a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jervis had put himself in touch with some prize brass
      band, and his speaker was of the loudest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, irritated, tried to appear whimsical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say, that fellow next door--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is rather noisy, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One might be living next door to a steam roundabout."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was reading the domestic notes in a popular weekly
      paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I believe he only turns it on like that on Saturdays.
      He can't afford it every night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank God," said Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      At ten o'clock Mr. Jervis switched off, and No. 3 enjoyed a
      transient and fallacious peace. Keir and Sybil had locked
      up and were going to bed when Mr. Block came home after a
      festive evening and began by kicking his own front door.
      His remarks were very audible to Sybil and Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Op'n th' ---- door--you ol' bitch. Op'n the ---- door."
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently there were parleyings between the lady and her
      husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll stay outside till you're sober, you drunken swine."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as much a creature of violence as her mate and
      almost as strong as he was, and when he kicked the door in,
      she did not wait upon compassion, but attacked. The row
      could be heard through the flimsy wall, bangings and
      cursings, and the squeals of the two small boys. It was a
      savage and a dishevelled show, and Keir, with a face of
      dark disgust, stood unbuttoning his braces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice lot of animals next door."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, oughtn't we to do something? It sounds as though
      somebody was being murdered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I shouldn't grieve if there were. People like
      that--better dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't turn out the light Keir, till that noise has
      stopped."
    </p>
    <p>
      In bed she lay and clung to him; she was trembling; but
      presently the savagery next door wore itself out. The lady
      had clubbed her mate with a rolling-pin, and then thrown a
      bucket of water over him, and presently Paragon Place
      slept.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's mistrust of Paragon Place was quickly justified, but
      when he came to analyse Paragon Place and its organic life,
      he found himself confronted with a curious anomaly. There
      were in Kingham many other terraces of working-class
      cottages which, while appearing to resemble Paragon Place,
      did not produce its particular atmosphere. Nor could the
      differences be just a question of coincidence. A silly
      brute like Block was not a coincidence; he was a universal,
      a type, just as much a type as Keir himself, or Mr. Samson,
      or Mr. Lugard, who loved beauty. Each little house and each
      little street might assume an appearance of likeness, but
      in each house there were fundamental contrasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir would say to himself that the standardization of
      modern life tricked one into assuming that the heads under
      the hats were as like as the hats. But were they? Obviously
      not. Society had graded itself. The reformers would have it
      that inequalities had arisen because the masterful and the
      selfish had made footstools of their less aggressive
      brethren. But was it so, or was it always so? To declare
      that Paragon Place was solely the product of the capitalist
      system was rather like accusing biology of being
      responsible for the unlikeness of the ape and the ass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more Keir thought about the problem, the more convinced
      he was that life was a study in differences instead of an
      assumption of sameness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "From each according to his powers, to each according to
      his needs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remove the exploiter, and society will perfect itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Educate--educate."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir did not believe in these sanguine solutions. It seemed
      to him that when the crowd man accused society of
      exploiting him, he was inventing a cock-shy. The crowd was
      exploited by its own limitations. It was being taught to
      deny these limitations and to howl down anyone who
      suggested that social values differed, the social values of
      the expert and the fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, patiently and poignantly, in another community he
      was to watch life grading itself, man becoming the artist,
      man remaining a creature just capable of hammering in
      nails; but in Paragon Place he could contrast Sybil with
      the frowsy virago who lived next door. Nor did he see
      himself as the loving comrade of a silly brute like Block.
      Even Darvels had its significance, a beautiful personality,
      a little aloof and secret. He suspected that--relatively to
      Darvels--society would always possess a Paragon Place. It
      was waste of time to argue about it; the thing was to get
      busy as an individual and escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir left the garden to Sybil, for she had much more time
      to deal with it than he had, nor did she appear to excite
      those little sadists next door. Their mother came out to
      gossip with Sybil. She was interested in Sybil as a
      neighbour from whom it might be possible to borrow things,
      for Mrs. Block was Paragon Place's most blatant borrower,
      and she had exhausted its possibilities. Her neighbours
      were shy of Mrs. Block's sudden shortages.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to get your man to do that digging."
    </p>
    <p>
      For Sybil was busy with a spade, and enjoying it, and since
      Keir was working overtime, why shouldn't she dig?
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not the job for a slip of a girl like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      To have Mrs. Block hanging over that disreputable fence and
      exuding sophisticated sympathy was worrying to Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Smith is so busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Smith indeed! Mrs. Block referred to her husband as
      Bill, save on those special occasions when she was upon her
      dignity with the rent-collector or the milkman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, if I was yer 'usband, I wouldn't like to see yer
      slavin' like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil turned on Mrs. Block a sudden, innocent smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I like it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Peculiar people, these Smiths! No doubt the fellow was
      mean, one of those nasty little chaps who were always
      sweating on a job and who kept a P.O. savings book. But
      Mrs. Block proceeded to exploit Sybil and borrowed on
      various occasions loaves of bread, oddments of butter, and
      half-pints of milk, nor was any restitution made. Mrs.
      Block blamed her memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my poor 'ead! Yes, you shall 'ave that loaf back
      tomorrow," but Mrs. Block's tomorrow never came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Moore, who was a clean, decent, quiet little body,
      warned Sybil against the lady of No. 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you lend that woman anything, my dear; she's a
      sponge."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even the impulsive and generous Sybil became recalcitrant
      when Mrs. Block borrowed her frying-pan and forgot to
      return it. Sybil had to go to the door of No. 4 and claim
      the article. Mrs. Block produced the frying-pan and once
      more blamed her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been so worried. Mr. B.'s bin stood off."
    </p>
    <p>
      But when Sybil took the frying-pan back with her, she found
      it in such a state of filthiness that she had to spend half
      an hour cleaning it with soda and hot water. Keir came in
      and surprised her at the sink, nor had all the grease been
      dealt with.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the trouble, kid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I lent it to the woman next door. I had to fetch it,
      and it was filthy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had had his suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Been cadging from you, have they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. But I'm not going to lend her anything again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir wondered if Sybil was afraid of Mrs. Block. Yes, it
      was more than possible. Sybil's timidity could be
      exploited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can put it down to me, kid. Tell her I found out and
      made a row."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil might be sensitive, but she had more moral courage
      than Keir suspected. She was not going to have Mrs. Block
      telling all Paragon Place that Keir was both mean and
      masterful.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in the main, and perhaps inevitably so, the Smiths were
      not popular in Paragon Place. Keir was working overtime all
      through the winter, for Samson &amp; Hoad had secured
      several good contracts, including the fitting up of a large
      new shop. Keir would come in for his tea at half past five
      and then go back to work, and there were evenings when he
      worked till ten. The majority of Keir's neighbours
      disapproved of such strenuous industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Block said of Keir: "The ---- young ---- will kill
      'imself, and a good job too."
    </p>
    <p>
      Phelps, the communist, had bitter things to say of Keir. He
      was a blackleg, a greedy swine who guzzled on other
      fellows' jobs, a ---- ---- to old Samson. It was chaps like
      Keir who kept the capitalist system on its legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir and Sybil, two young things newly mated and still very
      full of each other and their affairs, kept very much to
      themselves. No. 3 was blockaded by Nos. <i>2</i> and 4 and
      not feeling neighbourly to either household, particularly
      on Saturday nights. Mrs. Block, denied further borrowings
      and treated by Sybil with a timid hauteur, was on her
      dignity, referring to Keir and Sybil as "Lord and Lady
      Smiff."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But as the winter progressed, Keir began to experience the
      little moods of matrimony and to gather worries of his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was seeing very little of her husband. Even Saturdays
      were working days, and Sunday was the only day that was
      wholly theirs together. Keir would come home tired. He had
      what Sybil had begun to know as his working face, and often
      he would bring that face home with him and sit with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was an affectionate and sweet-tempered creature, but
      she did ask of life that it should amuse her sometimes. For
      the first two months of their marriage she was happily
      absorbed in the new life of No. 3, but when she had all her
      curtains up and the furniture in order and had planted the
      little front garden and a strip of the back garden, she
      found herself wedded to routine. After one or two disasters
      she had made herself a fairly efficient cook, and when some
      of the polish had worn off the new adventure, she found
      that her domestic duties did not fill her day.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were very long days. Keir disappeared on his bicycle
      at a quarter to eight, and he took his lunch with him. She
      did not see him again until half past five, and overtime
      took him away from her at half past six. He might return at
      half past eight or nine, tired and in no mood to play with
      a creature who was little more than a grown-up child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke to him a little hesitatingly about his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never seem to get any time off, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down with a book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we're lucky, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think you do too much. I don't see much of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did put the book away and talk to her. He explained to
      her his theory of life from an ambitious working man's
      point of view. He said that if you were keen to climb the
      ladder, you had to be pretty quick on the rungs, but that
      when you arrived at the top of the ladder, life might be
      easier.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to get you out of this back alley."
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Keir, but I wish you didn't have to work quite so
      hard. Supposing--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, and his eyes watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing--what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You got ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      He scoffed at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm one of the wiry sort, kid. Work never killed anybody.
      It's the loafers who rot. Finding the days a bit long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she confessed that she was. She was a sociable
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go out for walks, don't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you go and see the women at Darvels?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't we keep a dog? You could take the dog out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she could do that. But Keir seemed to forget about the
      dog, and it did not occur to him that she might like him to
      take her to the "pictures" once a week. Paragon Place went
      to the pictures even when it was on the dole. Certainly,
      she had her shopping to do, but her shopping was as
      domestic as her routine, and she had nothing supremely
      exciting to buy. The house was dressed, and so was she as a
      staid little housewife. But is any woman satisfied with
      sameness, especially in the matter of clothes? Sybil would
      find herself in Kingham High Street, and looking at hats
      and frocks and jumpers and all the cheap prettiness of
      those exciting windows. They were like a garden to her, and
      her own garden was not in flower. She had a passion for
      colour, and a woman's tenderness for flowery things. She
      may have desired them as a child desires to rush in among
      bluebells and pick, but she was a good child, a sensitive
      child, and she was finding the finances of No. 3 a
      perpetual problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one Saturday afternoon she fell, and so innocently. She
      came home feeling flushed and guilty and excited with a
      brown paper parcel, and in it a pretty, cheap, cretonne
      frock. It had cost her seven and sixpence, and she had paid
      for it out of the housekeeping money. Incidentally, the
      settlement of the grocer's bill had had to be postponed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She put on the frock and looked at herself in her mirror.
      What would Keir think of it? And wouldn't she have to
      confess to Keir? And suddenly she was frightened, for
      hadn't Keir said: "We shan't have to spend much on clothes,
      Syb, for a year. We started as fresh as the house." She
      took off the frock and hid it away in her wardrobe. She
      felt guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which--of course, was absurd, and a condemnation of Keir's
      blindness, in that he was traversing the present with his
      attention fixed upon a hypothetical future. There were
      plenty of other men who would be ready to take his wife
      from him, or at least to enjoy her at the price of a few
      frocks. Other men turned to look at Sybil in the streets,
      and sometimes she was followed. Moreover, even her friends
      at Darvels--the cook and the parlour-maid--would have
      sympathized with and admonished Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, worried about a seven-and-sixpenny frock, and your
      chap working overtime! You're being a bit too easy with
      him, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Sybil was worried about that frock, for the
      extravagance hastened the development of a financial
      crisis. Keir handed over thirty shillings a week for the
      housekeeping, and also the three and sixpence which was
      Sybil's personal allowance, but as a manager Sybil was
      something of a dear muddler, and to balance her accounts
      she had had to throw her three and sixpence into the
      domestic scales. For a while the sacrifice had retrieved
      the situation, but in January Sybil found herself seriously
      in debt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deficit amounted to less than three pounds, but, being
      Sybil, she accused herself of being responsible. She had
      allowed Christmas to persuade her to very natural
      generosities, a new pipe for Keir, crackers, fruit, holly
      and mistletoe, and a very small turkey. Keir had given her
      a winter coat with a fur collar and cuffs, and she had felt
      both delighted and distressed over that coat. It was an
      accusation. And they had eaten turkey in various disguises
      for four days.
    </p>
    <p>
      It somehow did not occur to Sybil that she should have
      confessed to Keir that she could not manage on thirty
      shillings a week. It was a confession of failure. Nine
      girls out of ten would have seized the situation by the
      horns and assumed the offensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to let me have another five shillings.
      What--I'm wasting money? Well, I like that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was this Sybil's only trouble. A far more dear and
      serious situation was developing, and Keir was curiously
      blind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inevitably, one or two of the tradesmen began to suggest
      that she should settle these outstanding accounts, and
      Sybil became frightened. What if Keir found out that she
      was in debt and did not find it out from her? And so she
      told him the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, I'm so sorry. I haven't been able to manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not tell him that she had been eating bread and
      butter for her lunch for three weeks. Had she told him that
      at once and confessed to the other secret, Keir might not
      have behaved like the rather severe young husband. He was
      taking off his boots in front of the parlour fire, and it
      was a very small fire, just as Sybil's offence was a very
      small one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter, kid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I find I can't manage on thirty shillings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not in debt, are you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Nearly three pounds. I'm so sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir happened to be very tired, and there had been a silly
      squabble in the workshop to irritate him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three pounds on the wrong side?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw that he was annoyed, and instead of being easy with
      her he behaved rather like the severe Victorian husband. He
      told her to get out her books and demonstrate to him just
      where and how she had failed to make ends meet. He was
      coldly practical. He did not light a pipe and make her join
      him in front of the fire. He went and sat at the table and
      proceeded to hold an audit. He began to go into details.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Butter. A pound of butter--twice--here--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking rather pale and poignant, she tried to explain that
      she used a lot of butter in her cooking, and she had butter
      for lunch. She did not accuse Keir of being fond of butter,
      which he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And tea. A pound of tea at two and eight. That seems--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she was in tears. She let herself go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--I've only had bread and butter--for my lunch--And I've
      spent all my dress-money on the housekeeping. I know
      I'm--I'm rather new to it, but I do think it's unkind of
      you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and looked at her in shocked silence. Tears! And he
      was only trying to help her, to point this out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Syb--all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      But to her his face still appeared severe and accusing, and
      abruptly she pushed back her chair and fled. She rushed up
      the stairs, still sobbing, leaving Keir to confront this
      emotional crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he was shocked, he had the sensitiveness to be shocked
      at himself. Could he claim to a complete authority on
      housekeeping? And she had been spending her own money, and
      starving herself in the middle of the day! Probably that
      damned woman next door had been sponging.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rushed upstairs after her. He found the room in
      darkness. She was lying on the bed, weeping, as though the
      little heart of No. 3 was broken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knelt down by the bed. He was very much moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't, kid, don't. I didn't mean to be nasty. I know much
      less about the job than you do."
    </p>
    <p>
      He got his arms round her and drew her to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not a mean devil. Perhaps I've been a bit too keen on
      saving. It's all right. I'll give you a bit more."
    </p>
    <p>
      She clung to him. She put her wet face against his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Keir--there's something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? Tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'm going to have a baby. Things have stopped--and
      I'm feeling so sick in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shocked--but chiefly because he somehow hadn't
      noticed--Serious? Yes, this was serious. The shadow of his
      share in life seemed to deepen, and with it his compassion
      for this creature who clung to him and who was so easily
      hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to have told me, kid. Or--I ought to have
      guessed. Good Lord, one can be damned selfish in trying to
      be too careful. Kiss me, Syb. I'm sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held off for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry--because--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, not that.--Because--I've hurt you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Keir."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir insisted upon Sybil's going to see a doctor, and not
      as a mere panel patient. In fact he took her himself to be
      examined by the physician who attended at Darvels, and it
      appeared that Sybil was three months pregnant. She was a
      healthy young woman with a normal pelvis, and the doctor
      reassured Keir, while warning him that he himself had
      ceased to attend maternity cases. He left the midwifery to
      his two junior partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir understood. The doctor who attended the Lugards was a
      man of five-and-fifty who would sacrifice his sleep only
      for exceptional cases, and Sybil's was not an exceptional
      case; so Sybil was transferred to one of the junior
      partners.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Richards will look after you just as well as I
      should," which was true, and when Keir had seen Dr.
      Richards, he gathered that Sybil would be in good hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's financial responsibilities enlarged themselves. No
      longer was it a question of considering a pound of tea or
      half a pound of butter. A new life had to be prepared for,
      and as yet the State does not provide free baby-linen and
      bassinets! Sybil was to be her own seamstress in the matter
      of the little creature's wardrobe, but when she and Keir
      came to investigate the problem, they were shocked at the
      amount of money they would have to spend. What with one
      thing and another, the trousseau of the hypothetical small
      Smith would cost them nearly twenty pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It does seem an awful lot, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was being very gentle with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No use doing the thing by halves, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--if it happens again, it won't be quite so
      expensive."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir did not say that it was essential that such a luxury
      should be curtailed, but he was thinking of it. Too many
      children could be a curse to a crowded community, whose
      urge was to escape from the crowd. One child would be
      sufficient, or at all events for the time being. These
      domestic etceteras would keep him marking time on the
      ladder.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not present his views to Sybil, for he was
      realizing the limitations of Sybil. She might be a lovable
      creature, but she was no pioneer or social climber. He had
      begun to see his wife as a dear and rather unpractical
      person, or so confusedly practical that she might involve
      herself and him in a little world of social compromises.
      She was more content with elementary things than he was.
      Her short-sighted brown eyes did not look very far ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      His urge was to work more furiously, but so far as work was
      concerned, Keir was fully exploiting his present
      possibilities. Also, Sybil and the moods of the young
      mother were in conflict with too much overtime, and Keir
      gave up working late. Sybil disliked being alone. She was
      ready to be considered and caressed. She had moments when
      she was afraid of the ordeal ahead of her, and she liked to
      have Keir there by the fire while she sewed at those baby
      garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared away the tea-things and washed up for her, and
      sometimes he would sit on the hearth-rug at her feet and
      she would pass her fingers through his insurgent hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which do you want, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had no prejudice in favour of either sex. If he asked
      anything of fate, it was that Sybil should come safely
      through the crisis, though both of them were pretending
      that the bearing of a child was hardly more alarming than
      getting married.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I suppose I ought to want a girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's imagine it's a girl. We ought each to choose a name.
      You think of one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was staring at the fire, and a name seemed to rise
      like a flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joanna."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joanna! What an unusual name, Keir! Where did you get it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that the name had been that of a heroine in a
      book that had impressed him considerably.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of a book, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose we should shorten it to Jo. My name's much more
      simple. Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      He repeated the names--"Mary Joanna Smith," and the rhythm
      of them pleased him. It was good English.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where did you get your name, Syb?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, silly boy, it's my other name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. But I always think of you as Sybil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet if she was Sybil, she was so much else, and the secret
      self of Keir was following the implications of this present
      and this future. Inevitably he saw himself with far less
      freedom than a year ago, and if he regretted it, he did so
      with compassionate resignation. Yes, this was life, a far
      more complex affair than the filling in of a time-sheet.
      The path would be a little more circuitous and full of
      hazards, the old, well-worn path of the multitude, trodden
      by generations of men and of women. You could not take a
      comrade and then quarrel with her because your effort was
      for two or three instead of one. Your courage and your
      power might be enlarged by the duality if you were rightly
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, he had the courage to confront this increasing
      complexity. That which he had dreamed of was a little
      farther off. He might have to tramp ten miles instead of
      five. His savings would be less; he would be more involved
      in the present while still pressing steadily towards the
      future. He was not afraid. As yet life had not infected him
      with its dreadful and elemental fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Working at his bench in the carpenter's shop, with old
      Tower beside him, he would look through the window at the
      yard with its building material and high black fence. The
      lilac bush had shed its leaves, but the ghosts of its
      flower spikes were visible. Less than a year ago--spring
      and the lilac blossom and the solitude of his dreams upon
      the downs! Now a builder's yard and bricks and drain-pipes
      and the limitations of that little hutch in Paragon Place.
      Sometimes he had a feeling that the exquisite virtue of
      youth had gone from him. The flower of the lilac had
      fallen. He was just a little fellow working in a shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would glance at Thomas Tower and reflect upon the old
      man's gentle absorption in his work. It was a kind of
      ritual, patient and predestined, and for old Tower that
      lilac might flower once or twice or thrice. But in his
      youth had this docile and rather inarticulate craftsman
      felt--as he--Keir--felt? Had Tower conceived some dream
      edifice of his own and lived to find it--Babel?
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, when the yard was growing dim, Keir asked
      his neighbour at the bench a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long have you been in this shop, Tom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Tower's large, mild face was turned to the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long? Oh, a matter of thirty years. We'd better have
      the lights on. My eyes aren't what they were."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirty years at the same bench in the same shop!
    </p>

      In winter Paragon Place was less communal than in summer,
      for most of the gardens were dirty brown blankets tucked up
      under the grey sky, and citizens did not linger at their
      doors. Debates and arguments removed themselves to the bar
      of the "George," a somewhat slovenly pub in Richmond Road
      where the sociable members of both sexes warmed themselves
      both within and without.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be said that the population of Paragon Place could
      be divided into those who pubbed and those who did not, the
      abstainers being in a serious minority and regarded as
      socially smug. Paragon Place had its own hatred of
      highbrows, for the paunch of the low-brow and the pate of
      the high-brow do not mingle over the pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Keir was not cut off completely from members of the
      other clique. He met some of them during his comings and
      goings, and the cheery salutation was not passed to him:
      "Hallo, Bob"--or "Morning, Jim." He was under suspicion; he
      never stood a chap a drink or became sociably and
      reassuringly silly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming home late one February evening, he met under the
      street lamp at the end of the road the two Job girls, very
      much dressed up and with somewhere to go. They were in
      spirits, two mischievous young wenches out upon adventure,
      and when they and Keir met by the street lamp, he stepped
      off the pavement to let them pass. He did not look at them,
      and to the Misses Job he was both dull dog and little
      Pharisee. There was no "Hallo, Gertie!" about Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      They broke into giggles at the confrontation and at his
      abrupt divergence. The occasion had its humour. The elder
      of the two girls seized her inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, darling."
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed on with sudden laughter, and Keir, suddenly hot
      about the ears, stepped back on to the pavement. Damned
      young--! They were still laughing, and a valediction was
      cast back to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wifie's waiting, dear. Get busy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he was not <i>persona grata</i> to Paragon Place, and
      he was misliking Paragon Place more and more. Like sex, it
      involved you and submerged you, and it was the sweet
      seductiveness of sex that had hurried him into this back
      street. It would have been so much better if he and Sybil
      had waited for a year. Meanwhile his urge to escape from
      certain environments crystallized upon the little, sordid
      thread that was Paragon Place. It was like some sinister
      and suggestive fate, slowly spreading its shadow over the
      world of his endeavour, darkening it, obscuring it. Almost
      Paragon Place propounded to him the old metaphysical
      problem of "Free Will and Fatalism."
    </p>
    <p>
      On yet another night, when the street lamps were blurred by
      fog, Keir came suddenly upon two shapes blocking the little
      iron gateway of No. 3, Mr. Block and Mr. Phelps, both in
      drink and on the dole. Mr. Block had mistaken the gateway
      of No. 3 for that of No. 4, and the coming of Keir added to
      the complication, for Mr. Block remained in the gateway,
      but he was not so drunk that he did not recognize his
      neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What d'yer want 'ere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir explained curtly that he wanted to reach his own door,
      and Mr. Block was suddenly and grossly amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't know his own gate, Syd! The little blighter's
      boozed."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a huge joke, and Mr. Block enjoyed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go in there, Mr. Smiff, and see what my old woman
      gives yer. She won't hang round your neck, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, who was tired and irritable, did not deign to argue
      the point. He slipped over the iron rail on the top of the
      wall, putting a foot on one of Sybil's wallflowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "Start at the end and count and you'll find
      yourself one short of four."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached the door, but Phelps, the communist, who was
      less and differently drunk from his comrade, became
      suddenly eloquent. He had the gift of language, especially
      when in liquor. His bitterness would blaze into furious,
      cold invective.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here, 'alf a mo. I've got something to say to you, Mr.
      Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the gangway of No. 4 and, leaning over the
      dividing fence, pointed a long first finger at Keir as
      though menacing him with a pistol.
    </p>
    <p>
      "---- little blackleg.--Overtime, overtime, ---- old
      Samson's ----, with other fellahs starving. Yes, you ----
      little skunk. I'd have you shot and shoved underground.
      Yes, you think you're going to be an employer, a ---- boss,
      climbing on the backs of your betters. Overtime, overtime!
      What you want is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, astonished by the other man's fury, stood there
      holding the handle of his front door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seem a bit excited, Phelps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, don't you give me any of your lip or I'll come
      over the fence at you. If I had my way, I'd have every man
      out of that ---- business. A lot of blacklegs, that's what
      you are, and we know it, and we're not going to forget it.
      You wait till the next general strike comes along, and
      we'll show you something."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir opened the door of No. 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right--then. How to get everybody down in the
      gutter, I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He went in, closing the door. He locked it, and in the
      passage he found Sybil frightened and trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was white and scornful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only two of our nice neighbours--rather drunk and seeing
      red. Nothing to worry about. Just Paragon Place."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In April Sybil's small garden came into flower, wallflowers
      and forget-me-nots and a few early tulips, and since she
      was growing big with child, she was obliged to content
      herself with looking at her flowers. She had a passion for
      being out of doors, and Keir bought her a two-and-six-penny
      deck-chair for use in the garden. There was no room for the
      chair in the minute patch in front of No. 3, and when Sybil
      sat out at the back, she was at the mercy of her
      neighbours. Paragon Place had no privacy. Mrs. Block would
      appear and force her familiarities upon Sybil, and since
      Sybil had refused her the loan of domestic articles, Mrs.
      Block retaliated by compelling Sybil to lend her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Block described vividly and in detail her two
      child-births and sundry miscarriages, and the "labours" of
      various friends. She referred to all the terrible things
      that might happen, and which she had known to happen. There
      was Gertie Parsons, who had lived at No. 7, and whose first
      pregnancy had been a horrible affair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They 'ad to put the instruments in her. She was torn to
      bits, she was, and the child was born dead. Its 'ead was
      all--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil fled into the house, and when Keir came home, he
      found her in tears. What was it? She confessed that the
      woman next door had been telling her things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was furious, and his fury translated itself into
      eighteen feet of deal fencing erected on the Block side in
      the form of a recess so that the lady should be excluded.
      He had managed to pick up some old posts and rails cheaply
      from a dump in the Samson &amp; Hoad yard, for the
      fence--like their sojourn in No. 3--was not planned for
      permanence. This piece of fencing shut out Mrs. Block, but
      it was an added affront to the occupants of No. 4. The
      Block children hammered upon it; their mother said things
      over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Jervis at No. 2 was less obvious than Mrs. B., and
      being upon her dignity, she had persuaded Mr. Jervis to
      erect a panel of trellis between No. 3 and No. 2. It was
      possible to look through the trellis, but Mrs. Jervis had
      become blind of eye towards No. 3. Her husband was to plant
      runner beans at the foot of this screen, and in the summer
      Mrs. Jervis would find herself almost as select as the
      Smiths.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, appreciating Sybil's loneliness and their isolation,
      was worried by it. He had to leave her so much alone, and
      Sybil was showing signs of becoming emotional and
      introspective. She had too much time to think about her
      ordeal, poor kid. He made a point now of coming back in the
      middle of the day to dinner, and one morning he met Mrs.
      Moore of No. 1 coming out of his gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a little, bright brown bird of a woman, sensible
      and kind, and she told Keir that she had been helping his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just dropped in. She gets upset so easily about things."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir thanked her. He was glad of those friendly brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd be glad for you to drop in any time, Mrs. Moore. I
      don't like leaving the kid so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Moore had her own views upon Keir as a husband. He was
      rather too serious and strenuous a young man, but he would
      learn, and Mrs. Moore knew how much husbands had to learn,
      but if a chap was kind and kept off the drink, all things
      were possible. She could refer to her own husband as a man
      of few words, but one of the best.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come in each day, Mr. Smith. I suppose you've
      arranged for the nurse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had, but a nurse is not as valuable as a friendly
      neighbour when a baby comes into the world, and the home is
      disorganized.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll give her a hand when the baby comes. She's a sweet
      thing, Mr. Smith, and I think you're lucky."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir agreed with her, and he was to become more and more
      glad of Mrs. Moore. She could be kind and practical without
      fussing; she had a soothing and a happy effect upon Sybil.
      Moreover, she was quietly but decisively anti-Block and not
      afraid of saying so. Like many small women she was a
      creature of great courage, and she had fought her battle
      with Mrs. B. and won it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "I'd be a socialist, Mr. Smith, if I thought the
      socialists could get rid of people like that, but I can't
      say I see how they can. It's in the blood. Look at their
      children. Block goes on being Block. That's what I say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the back garden of No. 3 was asking to be
      cultivated, and since Sybil could not give herself to it,
      the challenge was Keir's. She persuaded him to it, not
      foreseeing a certain incident that was to make that garden
      Eden after the Fall. She wanted Keir to grow potatoes and
      lettuces and peas and greens and to sow some annuals to
      make a summer show outside the kitchen window. If time was
      precious, she would be satisfied with dwarf nasturtiums,
      but she did ask for the faces of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir agreed. He began to give up his Saturday afternoons to
      the garden, in spite of the possible proximity of William
      Block and the Block small boys. He would go out with spade
      and hoe and rake as though the disreputable fence was five
      miles high or the next garden a rolling wilderness. Keir
      put in two rows of peas and six rows of early potatoes and
      pricked out a hundred or so lettuce seedlings presented to
      him by Mr. Moore. He had decided that Sybil should have her
      flowers, and he spent ten shillings on plants at Kingham
      market, French marigolds, snap-dragons, asters, and
      ten-week stocks. The strip of ground fronting the kitchen
      window promised to be gay, but one night the Smith garden
      was raided and half the plants were torn up and thrown over
      into the Jervises' garden next door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir suspected the Block children. There were footmarks in
      the soil that had not been planted there by the boots of
      adults, but he could not prove his suspicions. The damage
      had been done after he and Sybil had gone to bed in the
      front bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he mentioned the matter over the fence. He assumed that
      the Block children had been responsible for the outrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll trouble you to keep your kids out of my garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      The challenge was caught up and tossed back. Keir was
      accused of making unsubstantiated allegations against those
      innocents. He was told to mind his own business. He did
      mind it, while becoming increasingly aware of the active
      and jubilant hostility next door. Strange objects appeared
      in Sybil's secret enclosure, discarded tins, and a paper
      parcel full of fishy remnants, an old bicycle tire. No. 4
      was out for provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The climax arrived one Saturday afternoon. Sybil did not
      witness the gathering of the storm. The boys invaded Keir's
      garden, were chased, and the elder of the two received a
      box on the ear as he was scrambling over the ragged fence.
      He went in roaring to his parents, and the Block world
      erupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil had just made tea and had gone to the kitchen window
      to call her husband. She stood there with a kind of
      stillness of shocked horror. She saw Keir prone among the
      young potatoes with that hulk of a man on top of him. Mr.
      Block was rubbing Keir's face in the soil, while the two
      children hung over the fence and exulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil's impulse was to rush out and rescue Keir from that
      final humiliation, but something seemed to give way in her.
      Her eyes were dark and blind. She groped for a chair and
      sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly she was aware of Keir in the doorway. His face
      was filthy. It had blood on it, and more than blood, a kind
      of soiled shame. His eyes avoided hers. He seemed to know
      that she had seen him squashed and vanquished by the
      strength of the silly brute next door.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard him hurry up the stairs. He was going to try and
      wash away that shame, but some shames are ineffaceable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to rush up after him and take his soiled pride
      in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir--oh, Keir, don't look like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      But an elemental pang smote her. Her own crisis was at
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Joanna was born at about five o'clock the following
      morning, a premature child, but viable, and Keir, who had
      been walking up and down Paragon Place and watching the
      dawn come up over those slated roofs, heard for the first
      time the voice of his small daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood at the gate, a bare-headed and somewhat
      dishevelled young man with a bruised lip and an eye that
      was swollen. Almost he had forgotten the affair of the
      potato patch. The night had held other emotions. He
      remembered going round for Mrs. Moore, a Mrs. Moore who, in
      a moment of understanding, had refused to see the
      wounds--both physical and spiritual--upon his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had had cause to bless that quiet, capable little woman
      who had taken charge and brought with her a sense of sweet
      sanity into the outraged heart of No. 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better go for the nurse and the doctor, yes, at
      once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Moore had got Sybil to bed, and Keir had rushed off on
      his bicycle. There had been a bright full moon. He had
      spent half the night with that moon, for, with all those
      other people in his small house, he had felt himself a
      superfluous creature and most strangely and restlessly
      alone. He had tried sitting in the parlour, only to hear in
      the room above a kind of moaning and the voices of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Moore had come below and spoken to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nurse says everything's all right. You'd better go round
      and smoke a pipe with my man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had sat for an hour with Mr. Moore, a white Mr. Moore
      who in some strange way had ceased to be a stranger. They
      had said things to each other, simple and obvious things
      that seemed to grow out of the soil of their common
      humanity. And Keir had wondered at life and at some of his
      own crude impressions and prejudices. The soul of a sweep!
      Mr. Moore had made him a cup of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      But principally Keir appeared to have spent the night
      walking up and down Paragon Place, while the moonlight
      played upon the slated roofs. He had come to other
      conclusions with regard to Paragon Place. It had held one
      particular window for him, and he had both avoided and
      sought that window. It had been the only lighted window in
      the row, and occasionally a shadow had shown upon the
      blind. Life had become both poignant and shadowy. A sudden
      cry of pain!
    </p>
    <p>
      When would it be over?
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not been very conscious of the passing hours, for
      time had been measured by that prodigy of nature. It had
      both exasperated and touched him, and the exasperation had
      been a part of the pain. Why should Sybil have to suffer?
      Why had he no bed to go to? But how absurd! The crisis had
      caught him in a moment of raw humiliation. He had gone up
      and down, up and down, avoiding that window and yet being
      drawn to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, just after the dawn, the small voice of the
      child, an infantile protest against the newness of things
      and the process of being born! A thin, strange puling, and
      suddenly he had felt infinitely grateful and reassured. He
      had gone in with a kind of surreptitious haste, crept up
      the stairs, and knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been opened three inches. He had seen the face of
      the nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it all right?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had closed the door on him, and he had gone silently
      down the stairs and out into the little front garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, thank God, that was over! He went in to find Mrs.
      Moore busy in the kitchen, and realizing that she must have
      been up all night, he wondered at her good nature. Why
      should she bother about a couple of young people who a few
      weeks ago had been strangers? What did Mrs. Moore get out
      of it? Did she expect to get anything out of it? For,
      though Keir had read many books, he was very ignorant of
      life's elementals. He had views upon sociology, and, like
      many of his more learned betters with a passion for theory,
      he might despise the crowd, while remaining blind to the
      crowd's sanity. Having dissected society, he might sit
      perched on a stool, perplexed by his own cleverness and
      still in search for the strange force or substance that
      holds society together. What was the mysterious matrix?
      Just humanity's simple good nature, an urge towards
      kindness? That seemed too simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Moore was filling a kettle. She looked tired, but
      contentedly so, and her voice was gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, feeling proud, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was not feeling anything of the kind. He was hungry,
      and he wanted to shave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm jolly glad it's over. Did she have a very bad time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "More or less. The first, you know. But she's got more
      pluck than you'd think. I've heard some girls--well--never
      mind. I've got to go round presently and get my man his
      breakfast. You come along and have your breakfast with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went and looked at himself in the little mirror that
      hung on the wall beside the scullery door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have a shave and a brush up. I don't know why you are
      being so good to us, Mrs. Moore."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more don't I. It's just neighbourliness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir smiled at the reflection of his own rather haggard
      face. Yes, unquestionably he would have to show the world a
      black eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps there are some people one can't help being kind
      to. She's that sort--my wife, I mean."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Moore did not contradict him. She was not there to
      explore or to discuss human motives. She herself was a
      motive. She had the day's work on her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she surprised both herself and Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bless me--if it isn't Sunday morning! I was thinking it
      was Monday, with Jim having to be out at six."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir too had forgotten that it was Sunday, though the
      Sabbath's peculiar significance was confined to the fact
      that he would not have to go to work. He could stay at home
      with Sybil and the new prodigy and conceal his bruises from
      his neighbours, for the smart of that shame was reviving
      now that the night's ordeal was over. He had had his face
      rubbed in the dirt by that sodden chunk of flesh next door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you spare me a little hot water, Mrs. Moore?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, she could spare it. She was about to make Sybil and
      the nurse an early cup of tea. The nurse would be leaving
      in half an hour, and if Sybil could be persuaded to fall
      asleep after her cup of tea, the rest of the world could
      attend to its own affairs for an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll just see she's comfortable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir shaved himself in the scullery. He heard the nurse and
      Mrs. Moore come down the stairs, and he was given to
      understand that his wife and child were to be left
      undisturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She wants to see you, Mr. Smith, but I told her you'd come
      up presently. She's so sleepy, poor dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir accepted the situation. He went out into the back
      garden and walked down the path to the place where too
      sensitive a self-regard had received chastisement. He
      supposed that it was just as well that he should confront
      both the reality and his neighbours' back windows, but
      since it was Sunday, Paragon Place still slumbered. He
      stood and looked at a patch of disorder where the young
      haulms of half a dozen potato plants had suffered
      violence--even as he did. Silly, brute strength! But it had
      got him down in the dirt--He turned quickly and walked back
      to the cottage, for sudden ugly anger flared in him, and
      ugliness and anger were not good on a morning such as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had breakfast with the Moores, and Mr. Moore was jocular
      and fatherly, and Keir, who was waiting for one of them to
      remark upon his face and the fracas of the previous
      evening, was surprised and comforted by a nice reticence.
      It was as unexpected and as pleasant as Mr. Moore's white
      face, his Sunday face, and Keir felt touched. These good
      people could hold their tongues, which was more than some
      of the world's wise men have been able to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the meal he lit a pipe and went and stood by
      the Moores' kitchen window. He wanted to thank the sweep
      and his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "I would never have thought people could be so
      kind. I shan't forget it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Moore struck a match on his boot and smiled at his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's her. I don't take no credit. And besides--if there
      weren't a little neighbourliness, where would the world
      be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir took that fragment of philosophy back with him to No.
      3. No. 4 was out of bed and vocal. The two small boys with
      the hard red faces were out in their back garden, waiting
      for a possible victim. They began to hammer on the boards
      of Sybil's sanctuary. Keir stood for a moment in the
      kitchen, conscious of the white squall ready to rage within
      him, and trying to restrain it. Then he heard a voice, the
      voice of Mrs. Block.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stop that--or I'll knock your 'eads together."
    </p>
    <p>
      The hammering ceased, and Keir supposed that even Mrs.
      Block might on occasions attain to some sense of
      neighbourliness. Or did the banging on those boards annoy
      her?
    </p>
    <p>
      The storm mood passed from him. He smiled, and without
      realizing the quality of his smile and its whimsical irony,
      he went softly up the stairs and stood outside his wife's
      door.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She was awake and she had heard those careful footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, is that you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door and went in. The blind was down, and in
      the subdued light he saw Sybil's face. It had a kind of
      tranquil pallor. The large, dark eyes looked at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Keir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the door very gently. He was down on his knees
      beside the bed, conscious somehow of the tired and serene
      fragility of that face. He was deeply moved; his chin
      quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad it's over, kid.--I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes felt hot and suffused, and the face of his wife
      became blurred to him. He was aware of her putting out a
      hand and touching his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Keir--I'm so happy--Look--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten that small piece of new life, and he got
      up and, going round to the other side of the bed, bent over
      the bassinet. He saw a funny little withered face, two
      little puds of hands. The baby's eyes were closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to say something, and no words came. He stood
      hesitant and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pretty marvellous, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ours--Oh--Keir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was back again, on his knees by the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems worth while, kid, doesn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She held fast to one of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Joanna Mary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Mary Joanna. You came first."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled at him, and then a sudden shadow of intense
      seriousness spread swiftly over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir--I--I don't want her to grow up here, not near those
      other children--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood. It was perhaps the most complete refutation
      of communism that he was ever likely to hear. He bent down
      and kissed his wife's forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, Syb. We'll get out of this place--even
      if I have to build. That's a promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      The shadow passed. She lay and looked at him with eyes that
      were both tired and bright, and it seemed to Keir that his
      wife's face had a new, strange beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are good to me, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I couldn't be anything else, could I, Syb, with you
      being you?"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir did not know it then, but his wife--being
      woman--carried with her through the months that were to
      follow, an unconfessed and secret fear. Joanna Mary had
      been brought into the world prematurely by the emotional
      shock that her mother had suffered, and Sybil's dread was
      that the child might not be normal. Probably the thing was
      purely coincidental, but Joanna Mary did exhibit in later
      years a slight disharmony. She did not stammer, but was
      curiously hesitant in uttering the first two words of any
      sentence. It--was a kind of fumbling of the lips, rather
      appealing and attractive. Or, at least, her father found it
      so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the present was proving so much more persuasive
      than the future that Keir accepted the immediate adventure.
      In deciding to build a cottage of his own his inspiration
      was a miscellany. There was a little vanity in it, a
      snapping of the fingers under the nose of Paragon Place, a
      touch of swagger. The ideal home that was to be would
      contain more than emotion in its foundations. He persuaded
      himself that the investment would be reasonable and sound.
      He could put the rest of his savings into the small house
      and obtain the balance of the capital required from a
      building society. A mortgage, yes, but he would be able to
      pay off the mortgage in five or six years and then--if he
      should need capital for a venture on his own, he could
      raise it by mortgaging his house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the urge to escape from Paragon Place was as
      passionate as his pride. He might confront Paragon Place
      with an air of stiff-lipped nonchalance, but, being the
      sensitive creature that he was, he would be too much at the
      mercy of his reactions. You might despise things that were
      brutish and blatant, but when in contact with them, it was
      you who would suffer, not they.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, old dirty face!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The hard-eyed children next door were always ready to utter
      that salutation, and behind their little gloating faces
      loomed the bulk of that silly brute--their father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly the Block man symbolized for Keir the stupid
      strength of the herd, the menace of a crowd community that
      may stampede in a moment of panic and crash through the
      flimsy fences of convention. Hoofs and not intelligence may
      count in such a crisis. The ark of Noah was built to
      confound a cataclysm of nature, but to Keir the cataclysm
      to be feared was some upheaval of the crowd community. A
      few snarling creatures like Phelps leading some howling and
      hungry pack! For Keir was an individualist. Paragon Place
      had taught him that it might not be possible to love your
      neighbour; you might fear and hate him, and hate yourself
      for that fear. Paragon Place and a police force confessed
      to a dual inevitableness, and Keir was on the side of the
      police. Cheerfully would he have watched all that was Block
      in the world clubbed to extinction. The separative creature
      may have to fly or fight, and fight with a ferocity that
      disguises itself in creative cunning, and Keir had a wife
      and a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened that an estate had come into the market that
      winter. The place, known as Abbey Lands, had comprised a
      large garden, a small park, and several meadows. A
      syndicate was developing the estate and turning the park
      into a residential quarter for middle-class people, and the
      meadows were being sold off in lots for cottages and
      bungalows. Keir knew the estate. It lay on the outskirts of
      Kingham and not far from the river, a pleasant property
      rising to a slight plateau and well treed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having to go out on a job near Abbey Lands, he called at
      the estate office, a white wooden hut surrounded by posts
      and chains. He interviewed a clerk and was told that plots
      could be had at prices ranging from a hundred and twenty to
      a hundred and fifty pounds. There were certain
      restrictions. No bungalow to be erected should cost less
      than six hundred pounds, and a two-storied cottage, seven
      hundred pounds. Roads, water, gas, main drains, and
      electric light were to be arranged for by the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went to look at the land. Some of it had been pegged
      out into plots, and these plots fronted upon a lane. The
      old thorn hedges were still standing, and a particular
      corner plot attracted Keir, for on it grew a big beech
      tree, a green and stately fountain of a tree. Already two
      or three bungalows were being erected, but compared with
      Paragon Place, this new little world was sweet and
      peaceful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir walked over the plot and stood under the tree. The day
      was hot and sunny, and the shade of the tree made him think
      of a large, cool, gentle hand. He had a vision of a little
      white bungalow standing well back from the lane, with a
      grassy space and flower-beds in front of it. Certainly that
      tree would possess a large part of the garden, but how
      could you grudge space to so stately and proud a neighbour?
      A little white bungalow with a brown pantiled roof, a home
      for Keir, Sybil, and Joanna Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir said nothing to Sybil. Also, Sybil was so full of
      Joanna Mary. It was really amazing how eight or ten pounds
      of young flesh complicated the domestic symphony. No. 3
      seemed to be all Joanna Mary, towels and diapers and sudden
      tantrums and enthusiasms and the feeding of the small
      creature. Alarums and excursions at night, swift maternal
      panic in the heart of Sybil, sustained and tolerant
      resignation on the part of Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--she's been sick. I wonder if the milk--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      To Keir it appeared evident that a baby's normal state was
      one of lively incontinence at both ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sick? Well, I don't think it's much to worry about."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think we ought to have the doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go and ask Mrs. Moore."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Moore was an incredibly wise woman and quite
      indispensable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir spoke to Mr. Samson about the bungalow, and it so
      happened that Messrs. Samson &amp; Hoad had secured a
      contract to build four cottages on the Abbey Lands estate,
      nor was Mr. Samson surprised by Keir's passion to escape
      from Paragon Place. Also, Mr. Samson had good cause to know
      that when a firm had a man like Keir in its employ, he
      might be worth hundreds a year to it. Mr. Samson always
      asserted that a good man need never be out of a job in the
      south. The north appeared to be a different proposition,
      for the individual was more coerced by massed Trades
      Unionism. He wanted to keep Keir. He was interested
      personally in the career of Keir Hardie Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's it going to cost you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One hundred and fifty for the land, and six hundred for
      the bungalow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much can you put down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About two hundred, sir. I can go to a building society for
      the rest."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir and Mr. Samson were alone together in the firm's
      office, and Mr. Samson picked up a paper from the desk. His
      fresh-coloured face had a jocund slyness. Business might be
      something of a dog-fight in these crowded days, but there
      were occasions when it was pleasant to spring a surprise
      upon life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Six and a half per cent, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson played with the piece of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Keir, we have a contract to build four cottages
      on the estate at seven hundred and fifty pounds apiece. We
      shall have all our stuff and our staff out there. I'll put
      you up a bungalow at cost price."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know why you should, sir--I'm--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A matter of business--perhaps, what! One may get more out
      of a man than the return for the wages you pay him.
      Besides--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One doesn't talk like this to everybody. Keep it quiet.
      And about a mortgage. I'm what they call a warm man. I'll
      let you have a mortgage at five per cent."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir sat down rather suddenly on one of the office chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's extraordinarily good of you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? I'm not losing money on it. Or put it another way, my
      lad, I'm backing my fancy. One may put money on a man as
      well as on a gee-gee. Old Tom is leaving us at the end of
      the year, and you'll be our foreman carpenter. Besides, you
      remember that little conversation we had?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's hands were clasping his soft hat and spoiling the
      shape of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not likely to forget it. But I shall be saving to pay
      off the mortgage. I shan't have any capital to put into--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson looked amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Possibly--we can do without that. I might get a silly pup
      with a gold dog-collar. I might prefer a chap without the
      dog-collar. You carry on for another year or two, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir got up from his chair, still looking rather white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know what you are offering me, sir, my chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson laid a large hand on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just so. Someone gave me a chance once. I suppose they
      thought I was worth it. Go ahead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then--I can close with them for the land?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, go ahead."
    </p>

      Keir sacrificed the day's dinner-hour and, cycling over to
      Abbey Lands, found a clerk lunching on sandwiches in the
      white hut. The clerk was a phlegmatic young man, and this
      other fellow appeared a little excited and breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Plot 29 still open?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk turned to look at an estate map hanging on the
      wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plot 29?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, the one at the corner, with the beech tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk's consciousness was un-treed. He was an urban
      soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, 29's not taken up yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll take it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man looked with bored blue eyes at Keir. The
      fellow seemed in a hell of a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. But there are restrictions, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you told me all about that. I was in here two or
      three days ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you were. Get a lot of people buzzing in and out. When
      can you put the money down?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tomorrow--if necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk selected another sandwich from the tin box. It
      was a cheese sandwich.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right-o. Better give me the details and sign a form. We
      shall have to get the conveyancing put through."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Freehold--of course. No ground-rent--or anything like
      that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. The whole happy home is yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir scorched back to Paragon Place, where Sybil met him
      with a face of reproachful relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--I thought you'd had a smash. I've kept your
      dinner."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ten minutes to two, and Keir was too full of other
      food to trouble about dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me a piece of bread and cheese, Syb. I say--I shall
      have something to show you after tea. Can you get Mrs.
      Moore to take charge of Joanna?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil caught his vibrant enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, what is it, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've bought a bit of land. Yes, just the spot for us.
      Samson's going to put us up a bungalow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil's eyes seemed to catch the light. Then she rushed at
      him, put her arms round his neck, and kissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, how lovely!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Keir's predestined plot of ground had a frontage of
      fifty-feet and a depth of a hundred and fifty. He had
      brought with him half a dozen rough wooden pegs cut from
      the lid of a box, and when he and Sybil wheeled their
      bicycles through a gap in the thorn hedge and saw what to
      them was green and unvexed country, they experienced one of
      those moments of pure happiness that remain like the memory
      of some exquisite afterglow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Keir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood holding her bicycle and looking out over the
      meadows towards the trees of the Abbey Lands park, elms,
      chestnuts, and three very old cedars with the evening light
      upon them, and to Keir his wife's face was like the face of
      the woman bending over Joanna Mary, faintly smiling,
      tender, vaguely wistful. Her lashes seemed to quiver. There
      was something melting in the lines of lips and chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like it, kid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are we really going to live here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, of course there will be a lot of houses later on."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but I shan't mind them, somehow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she discovered the beech tree, and when Keir told her
      that it would be their tree, she uttered a little cry of
      delight. She was a simple creature both in her joys and in
      her sorrows, and she would give to life that which was
      lovable and lasting in herself. She put her bicycle against
      the hedge and, going to the tree, touched the smooth trunk
      with her fingers and then stood looking up into the green
      foliage. The half-light under the tree seemed to make her
      face appear paler and more mystical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it beautiful! I can put Joanna here in hot weather."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had left his bicycle beside her and taken the wooden
      pegs. His eyes were smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, then, where shall we have the house?"
    </p>
    <p>
      They paced out the plot and, standing side by side,
      discussed the sitting of the house. They agreed that it
      should be set well back from the road and with a view of
      the beech tree, and that the thorn hedge should be left as
      it was. Sybil was for having the flower garden in front of
      the house. She wanted a small lawn. Joanna could play on
      that sacred plot of grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How big will it be, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, about thirty feet by twenty, I expect. Yes, roughly
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      He began putting in his pegs, and Sybil followed him from
      corner to corner, while he described the building to her.
      He visualized a little white bungalow with a brown roof, a
      green front door, and green window frames. Yes, and brown
      chimney-pots. All the windows were to look to the front or
      to the back so that they should see as much garden as was
      possible. A home should not stare at fences, or the walls
      and roofs of other people's houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall have a real up-to-date kitchen, Syb. What I mean
      is--all the rough work can be done in the scullery, and we
      can use the kitchen as a living-room. In the scullery a gas
      cooker and a gas copper, and everything to hand. Save time
      and tissue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we have a bath, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. A 'Cook &amp; Heat' in the kitchen with a
      hot-water boiler fixed there will do us proud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I should like a good larder, Keir. Something that
      isn't like a black hole and yet keeps things fresh and
      cool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not like No. 3, kid. That's the idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning to the beech tree they sat down on the grass.
      There were still innumerable details to be discussed, the
      advantages of stained doors and skirting-boards over
      painted ones, the question of cupboards, whether they
      should choose paper or distemper, the position of the front
      gate, and of the shed for bicycles, tools, and etceteras.
      Sybil, finding herself referring to the dream house as
      "It," realized that it needed naming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What shall we call it, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it isn't born yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we christened Joanna, didn't we--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so. Any ideas?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat and gazed at the stretch of grass where the little
      white building was to stand, and her thoughts went back a
      year to that lovers' day upon the downs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's call it 'Merrow,' Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood her, and he let an arm lie across her
      shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good idea. Yes, that was a day, wasn't it? Merrow. Yes,
      we'll call it 'Merrow.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Having walked once more over the land that was to be
      theirs, they wheeled their bicycles out into the lane and
      returned to Paragon Place, and Joanna Mary. Mrs. Moore,
      when told the news, looked just a little sad. "Well, that
      will be nice for you, won't it? I'd like a little place
      like that myself." She delivered up Joanna Mary and tried
      not to feel jealous of Sybil or to say that life seemed so
      much easier for the younger generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A bungalow? No stairs? And a bath?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, not like Paragon Place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's lucky for you that your man's got such a good
      job."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Joanna Mary had been put to bed, Keir and Sybil sat
      down at the kitchen table, and Keir drew plans of the
      bungalow that was to be, but the first plan that he
      produced allowed for no bath-room. Sybil called his
      attention to the omission, and he ran his fingers through
      his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm blessed! Must squeeze it in somewhere. Let's
      see. Kitchen--living-room, parlour, two bedrooms, scullery,
      bath-room."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a hall and passage, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will have to be all passage. Getting everything in on
      the ground floor without spreading your foundations all
      over the earth--! Wait a bit--I have it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a good draughtsman, and his final plan--though it
      was only roughed in--brought the right exclamation from
      Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are clever, Keir. Could we have taps that don't need
      too much cleaning? Not brass taps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather. And I'd have liked glass handles on the doors, but
      they cost too much."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Since the building of "Merrow" was to be a somewhat secret
      affair, Mr. Samson suggested that Keir should draw out his
      own plans and do his own measuring up and estimating. It
      would be good experience for him, and Mr. Samson was
      interested to see how Keir would handle his first house. A
      man may be a certificated craftsman and yet prove incapable
      of confronting reality and of budgeting for all the
      etceteras that control profit and loss. Keir spent seven
      evenings on materials, ballast and cement, bricks, timber,
      tiles, drain-pipes, plastering, fire-grates, and fittings.
      These were calculable details, while labour and the
      time-costs of labour were more hypothetical. But Keir had
      kept his eyes wide open during his years with Messrs.
      Samson &amp; Hoad, and he had a fairly accurate knowledge
      of what the bricklayer, the plasterer, and the carpenter
      should do in a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      His estimate worked out at £470. He had gone into every
      detail, and the document that he handed to Mr. Samson was a
      complete schedule. He had borrowed various trade-lists from
      the office, and the prices that he quoted for the various
      fittings were up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson, having examined Keir's figures, found them
      substantially accurate. The estimate was for a sound and
      solid little place, honest work everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson was pleased. Keir had a head on his shoulders.
      Here was a youngster who had not been content to live
      merely amid shavings and sawdust. He had ideas and the
      technical knowledge to put those ideas into practice. An
      architect might be a very cultured gentleman, and sometimes
      incredibly fussy, but so often he was blind to the blood
      and sinew of reality. He might raise hell and heaven over a
      mantelpiece or a chimney-flue and be quite unable to tell
      you whether a particular man was slacking or when there was
      too much sand in the cement. The architect might say that
      these commonplaces did not concern him, but Mr. Samson knew
      that the business of building houses is as personal as the
      rearing of a baby. You may possess plenty of theory and yet
      misunderstand and mishandle the poor little beast's
      metabolism. Mr. Samson loathed theorists. They belonged to
      the great hierarchy of high-brow hoodlums. He classed them
      with district visitors, extension lecturers, and all
      government officials.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's quite a good bit of work, Keir. You've allowed the
      men a margin. Then--there's the weather."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson had to have his little joke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems to me the gentleman who draws out the weather
      reports don't understand plain language. When it rains,
      it's unsettled; when the sun shines, it's settled. Much
      better if they changed the words over. Settled and rainy.
      Another depression from the Atlantic. I'd like to see some
      good foul language in those weather reports."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Occasional showers, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson smiled one of his crooked, sly smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, couldn't they call it a damned deluge--on occasions?
      But--just a moment. This bungalow of yours--I regard it as
      a piece of secret diplomacy. I don't want it gossiped
      about. You take me? Besides, we shall have to put the
      figure at six hundred to satisfy the Abbey Lands people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir said: "Quite so. I like minding my own business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's plans were passed by the Borough Surveyor of Kingham
      and approved by the Abbey Lands Building Estate, but though
      Keir's world did not know of the understanding between Keir
      and Mr. Samson, it soon discovered that he was building a
      house. The Moores knew, and soon all Paragon Place had
      heard of the Smiths' adventure in bricks and mortar.
      Phelps, who was painting one of the new houses on the Abbey
      Lands estate, had nothing but bitter things to say of the
      people who were going to inhabit those houses. Private
      property, villas for the middle classes, comfortable homes
      for the swine who sold you things and sold you in the
      selling of them. The house upon which Phelps was working
      was the property of a successful ironmonger.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had bitter things to say about all tradesmen and lawyers
      and estate agents. They did not produce. They just sat on
      the stuff that the workers produced, and hatched out a
      profit. He had bitter things to say about Keir and Keir's
      bungalow. He would stroll along the lane during the
      dinner-hour and observe the growth of the Smiths' new home.
      He called it another incubating box for little profiteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mark my words. That chap Smith will soon be putting
      his tools away and getting into a black coat to live on the
      fellows who are doing the job. You can smell a capitalist a
      mile away. Dirty little shark."
    </p>
    <p>
      Paragon Place might agree with Mr. Phelps in regarding the
      Smiths as unsuitable neighbours, but it did not share Mr.
      Phelps's scorn of property. Paragon Place purchased
      sweepstake tickets or portions of tickets and dreamed
      dreams, and those dreams confounded the communist. The
      lorry-driver would confess in his expansive moments that if
      the luck ever came his way, he would buy a Rolls-Royce. Mr.
      William Block's fancy was a prosperous pub within half a
      mile of Hurst Park or Sandown. Mrs. Jervis sometimes
      dreamed of a nice villa in Surbiton, with two maids and a
      conservatory and a daily dinner that should suggest an
      eternal and glorified Sabbath, asparagus and strawberries,
      and a glass of port when you felt like it. Possibly Paragon
      Place was grossly material in its ideals, but it preferred
      the worldly substance to the product of Mr. Phelps's social
      gasometer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Mr. Moore who--upon an occasion--asked Mr. Phelps to
      explain to him how Mr. Everyman was to live like a lord on
      three hours' work a day. Would the product of such
      enlightened ease be sufficient to maintain the world in a
      state of material bliss? It didn't seem sense somehow to
      Mr. Moore. Oh, machines were to do everything, were they?
      Machines to sweep chimneys? Oh, there wouldn't be any
      chimneys. And everyone would be wafted about in beautiful
      communal motor-coaches. The English artisan would "fly" to
      China, and the Chinese coolie would be seen spending the
      week-end at Hampton Court. There would be no bossy brains,
      or was it that braininess would be the prerogative of Mr.
      Phelps?
    </p>
    <p>
      The communist would get excited in the face of opposition,
      and his language lapse into the vernacular.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you--are all blind. Can't you see that if we get rid
      of the exploiters and agree that no man's to make a--profit
      out of his neighbour--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, aren't you playing the prophet, old lad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said proff-it. Selling some silly muck that's worth
      tuppence to some boob--for sixpence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then--I'd be sweeping your chimneys for nothing, and you'd
      be painting my house--free--and when my old woman asks me
      for the weekly money, what about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't you see--that there won't be any--money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about the groceries, and my pint of beer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be communal allowances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rations?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, in a sense--yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what if the rations get short--with all of us being so
      easy-osy? I might object to sweeping chimneys; I might find
      it beneath m'dignity to sweep chimneys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'd cut off your rations."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Moore reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there doesn't seem much difference in it after all,
      but I have a sort of notion that under your scheme there'd
      be more hard biscuit than good bread."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir and Sybil, cycling over every summer evening to exult
      over the growth of "Merrow," were troubled by none of these
      disharmonies, and Joanna Mary, left in the lap of Mrs.
      Moore, chuckled and crowed and cared not a jot for the hard
      things Mr. Phelps might say of her. "I'm a little blackleg.
      I was born a little blackleg, oh--dear, oh--dear!" She was
      a healthy and a happy infant who caused her elders to
      perform innumerable useless acts. She enslaved them and
      exploited them, and Sybil was a willing slave. She talked
      elemental nonsense to Joanna Mary, and possibly the noises
      they exchanged would have attracted more attention from the
      world than the debates in the House of Commons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was all so very new to Sybil. She was enjoying her
      youth. She could be eternally surprised at life. She was
      very much surprised at the apparent smallness of "Merrow's"
      foundations when first she saw them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, haven't they made a mistake?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He assured her that they had not. Foundations always looked
      like that. Let her preserve her soul in patience until the
      walls were ten feet high.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was kind, and very little rain fell before
      "Merrow" had its roof on, a roof of soft brown pantiles.
      With the doors and windows in and the walls whitened Keir
      was able to look upon the completeness of his creation, and
      it pleased him. The little place was admirably
      proportioned, simple, and its very simplicity naïvely
      dignified. It was like a perfect frock cut by an expert,
      and yet Keir was a novice save in his inward vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson, standing under the beech tree with Keir one wet
      afternoon in September, said exactly what he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the prettiest little place I have seen round
      Kingham, and it isn't a question of cash."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was a little flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I just saw it--in my mind. How have the costs worked out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ten pounds or so under the estimate. We've had good
      weather. Well, you've got the stuff in you, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      On another day Keir had been hanging doors. He was the only
      man at work in the bungalow, and when he had locked up and
      was wheeling his bicycle out into the lane, he came upon a
      man looking at "Merrow" through a thin place in the thorn
      hedge. It was Phelps, the communist. There was a little
      snicker of a sneer on his face, and Keir, preparing to
      mount his bicycle and having ceased to be on speaking terms
      with Phelps, was conscious of that sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Phelps addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who prigged the plan of that for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir paused with a foot on the pedal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact, I prigged it out of my own head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Phelps wagged an ironical head at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's marvellous, isn't it? A bit of inspiration.
      Would you like me to find you a name for it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir gave Phelps one sharp, combative look and mounted on
      his bicycle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't trouble. I have a name for it, and it's neither red
      nor black."
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls had dried out well, and the Smiths moved into
      "Merrow" on the 15th of October, and Paragon Place was to
      see them no more, for in the middle of November the Moores
      were to transfer themselves to a new cottage. October 15th
      was a Saturday, and Mrs. Moore came to help Keir and Sybil
      in and to give some of her attention to Joanna Mary. The
      weather was perfect, golden and still, and the big beech
      tree was beginning to colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Smith furniture had had no opportunity to show itself
      to advantage in No. 3 Paragon Place, but in "Merrow" it
      looked quite rich and important. Sybil thought so. She was
      delighted with everything. She stood and looked at her
      small parlour garnished with carpet, Chesterfield sofa,
      armchairs, and bureau, and it seemed to her that her
      parlour would not have been ashamed of itself at Darvels.
      She was going to give a party next week and show off her
      new home to cook and Russell and one or two acquaintances.
      She went about touching things tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was lighting the kitchen fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll christen the bath, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was an amazing little place, and when Mrs. Moore
      had gone, Keir and Sybil went into every room and were full
      of the pride of possession. Joanna Mary was peacefully
      asleep in her cot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's taken to the house at once, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir stood and looked at his small daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems so. Funny little beggar, isn't she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir! She's just like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed, tickled his wife's neck, and went to see that
      the kitchen fire was burning as it should do. It was, and
      he called to Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like to try the taps, Syb?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran into the scullery and turned on the hot tap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's quite warm already, Keir. Isn't that splendid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till they were going to bed that Keir reacted to
      "Merrow's" most significant virtue. He stood by the window,
      unfastening his braces, and the whole of him seemed to
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Syb, what night is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was sitting on the bed, removing her stockings. She
      glanced warningly at Joanna Mary's cot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, don't you know? It's Saturday."
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught Keir smiling at her whimsically.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not the ordinary sort of Saturday. Don't you miss
      something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She did.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so quiet--so peaceful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir tossed his braces over his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, thank God! No Jervis loud-speaker; no silly brute
      coming home boozed. That's what's wrong with our world,
      Syb. We're too much on top of each other. And when the
      crowd takes a fancy to a thing, it kills it by crowding it.
      Like the bluebells on Whit Monday."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil hung her stockings over the end of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's lovely to know that you can go straight to
      sleep. Who's going to have the bath first?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You--of course. I'll do a little reading, or watch the
      kid. Don't pinch all the hot water."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course I shan't."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      When Keir had put a wire fence round his plot--he could not
      afford a boarded one--and planted a young thorn and privet
      hedge, the separativeness and singularity of "Merrow" were
      complete. Keir had insured the little house against fire,
      and he had insured his own life at so much a week, though
      at Keir's age a man is not much concerned with the problem
      of dying. Death was not even a shadow to Keir. He had yet
      to conquer Canaan.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as a man successfully immured in the little house of
      marriage, Keir began to look about him at certain
      realities. He had escaped from Paragon Place; he had a
      house and a wife and a baby and a future that appeared to
      be assured, and suddenly the domestic serenity of his small
      success was invaded by a feeling of vague restlessness. It
      was like a little, plaintive, disturbing wind blowing
      through a keyhole while he sat with Sybil in front of his
      fire. It seemed to pipe to him like the Pied Piper. "Come,
      rise, follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      His books were dusty. Yes, even in this new little house.
      He and his books had been strangers since the coming of
      Sybil and of Joanna Mary. In fact his books had been
      banished to a painted deal bookcase in the spare bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keats, Swinburne, Rupert Brooke!
    </p>
    <p>
      One November evening he went and rummaged among his books.
      Poetry. Why this urge towards poetry? He looked for his
      copy of Keats and found it jammed away between a cheap
      dictionary and a book on economics. Keats was dusty. He
      opened the book. Endymion! He stood very still, staring at
      a page as though some sweet strange voice had found him out
      in that little, empty room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard another voice, his wife's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer her at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, what are you doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled, but there was a twinge of irony in his smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looking out a book."
    </p>
    <p>
      He switched off the light and carried Keats with him into
      the sitting-room kitchen. Joanna Mary had been put to bed.
      He saw his wife sitting at the table with a pencil and a
      catalogue. It struck him that her hair was not so well
      cared for as it had been. Almost, there was a suggestion of
      an incipient stoutness about Sybil, a domestic solidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, I want to do the seeds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seeds?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's best to get one's order in early."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in a chair by the fire and he did not open his
      book, for his consciousness was confronted by Sybil and the
      social orthodoxy of Sybil. She was the enthusiast in the
      garden. He had been surprised at the way in which she had
      tackled the garden; she was much stronger than she
      appeared. But it was Sybil as a person and not merely Sybil
      as an active young organism that was making Keir look at
      her as though he had discovered unexpected possibilities in
      his wife. There was a persistence in Sybil, a kind of
      gentle obstinacy. She was no longer the seductive girl, or
      the dear neophyte at the altar. She was developing a quiet
      solidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost, as the house-mother, she showed signs of dominating
      him. "Now, father, get out the wheelbarrow." She had a
      little air of pleasant authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go through the list."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not say: "Put your silly old book away," but Keats
      remained unread, and Keir resigned himself to the seed-list
      and next year's floral display. He was aware of Sybil
      sucking a pencil and frowning slightly, as she read out a
      series of names and made ticks against them with the
      pencil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we must have larkspurs."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was very much in charge of the catalogue, and though
      Keir made no single suggestion, his muteness did not
      matter. She assumed that he was there to play a game with
      her, though the game might be of her own choosing.
      Besides--it was his garden as well as hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Virginia stock. Oh, wait a bit, we must have something to
      smell nice. Mignonette."
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she was busy adding up her score. The catalogue
      was a cheap one, but Keir's bill for flower seeds promised
      to surmount twenty shillings. Then, there would be the
      vegetable seeds; Sybil wanted peas, and peas were
      expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir waggled a foot. His inclination was to remind Sybil of
      the economies and to tell her that he was saving only a few
      shillings a week. He wasn't Croesus, but then Sybil had
      never heard of the Lydian king.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems rather a lot, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But think of all the nice fresh vegetables. We must have
      our own lettuces. The greengrocer's bill--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her intent and pretty head. After all she was
      a very good kid about clothes. She seemed more concerned
      about Joanna Mary's wardrobe than her own. Even the frock
      she was wearing was a little tashed and domesticated. He
      hadn't the heart to oppose her and her horticultural
      enthusiasms. He remembered that the Sybil of Darvels had
      dawned on him in a world of flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't it be lovely?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw her suddenly as a simple and happy creature wholly
      involved in flowers and Joanna Mary and other wholesome
      activities. Was she happier than he was? Poetry? No little
      twinges of restlessness, no divine discontent, no passion
      for gadding about. Queer! He had always been told that the
      modern girl--But what would life be like with a little
      cinema fan--? Yes, there was a curious, sweet solidity
      about Sybil. She seemed to have planted herself like the
      beech tree in the front garden. Well, according to the
      wisdom of the elect, he should consider himself lucky.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, there's one thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "More seeds."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, we really shall have to buy a lawn-mower."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lawn-mower?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Of course I could cut the little front lawn with
      shears, but it would take hours and hours. Perhaps we can
      pick up a cheap American one second-hand. And I do want a
      piece of grass for Joanna. Besides--without grass--flowers
      don't get a chance to look their best."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir might be able to make many things, but a lawn-mower
      was beyond him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll look round."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Try Tashleys. It's simply a marvellous place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tashleys was Kingham's universal junk-shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      During those winter days Keir left "Merrow" at a quarter to
      eight each morning and returned at six. It was a raw and a
      foggy winter, especially so in the Thames valley, and the
      Abbey Lands lane was full of puddles. The wheels of his
      bicycle went squelching through these puddles, and one
      January morning when the fog was a grey blanket, it
      occurred to Keir that he might expect to ride to and fro up
      this lane for the rest of his life. The prospect shocked
      him, though as a man with a house and a family he had no
      right to be shocked. He had settled down. It was one's
      social duty to settle down. And yet--? Restless devils,
      men. He supposed that it was not that man loathed work as
      work so much as the sameness of his employment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his prospects were more pleasant than those of
      thousands. He had been Messrs. Samson &amp; Hoad's foreman
      carpenter since the beginning of the year, and he had
      discovered--Yes, just what? A kind of dumb hostility in
      some of the men whose work he had to supervise. He had
      become the creature of the boss. Yes, even a little
      responsibility and authority made you unpopular. He could
      remember how the men had jeered at other supervisors, and
      thought it part of the game to fool them. Social
      discipline. He was one of those upon whom success would
      bind the burden of exercising authority in an age when the
      world was resenting the reality of the superior man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered that Mr. Samson had said to him: "Keir,
      you'll find out a good deal about human nature when you
      begin to give orders. Awkward beasts--men, and yet you'll
      do better with them by being a bit of an autocrat. You have
      got to make 'em accept you. Human nature's such a queer
      mixture, like streaky bacon, but it's good bacon on the
      whole."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to swing over to avoid a carelessly driven car. He
      gave the driver a fierce look.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident reminded him of something that Sybil had said
      last Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, there'd be room for a drive, wouldn't there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A drive?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we may have a little car some day. If Mr. Samson
      takes you into the business, we shall have to have a little
      car."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been surprised by Sybil's precocity as a prophet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, possibly. But don't gossip about--that, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You would rather I didn't?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes, one might look such a silly fool if it didn't
      come off."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir fully expected that it would come off.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was suggesting something much more serious than the
      purchase of a second-hand lawn-mower. She was saying that
      Joanna Mary ought to have a little brother, and she was
      proposing to give her one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had come home very tired. It had been one of those
      exasperating days when braces-buttons fail and your bicycle
      skids on a tramline, and the firm's passive-resisters
      indulge in ca' canny. Keir had had words with one of the
      men. "For God's sake, George, get on with it, or I'll buy
      you a manicure set."
    </p>
    <p>
      On that evening he had words with Sybil. They did not
      quarrel, but there was a poignant argument between them,
      and a little lecture by Keir on finance and birth-control,
      and Sybil, with her new air of solidity, sat and sewed on
      some garment as though she meant to sew all night.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just think a moment, Syb. We have had new furniture, a new
      house, and a baby in twelve months. That's about the limit,
      my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil sat and sewed, and to his logic she opposed the
      elemental urge of her instinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I want another baby, Keir. An only child gets spoilt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir ran a hand over his insurgent hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's out of the question--at present. I expect to be
      able to save a little, and I'm saving practically nothing.
      We can't afford it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But other people--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rot! Only the irresponsible and the social-problem class
      breed like that in these days. Good God, we're overcrowded
      as it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is the other bedroom, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me--you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, Keir. I mean--Oh, don't be so cross and rude."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sorry to have spoken to her so roughly. He went and
      stood beside her chair and watched her hands at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, kid, but don't you understand that I feel
      responsible? I don't want to be submerged. There's nothing
      between you and Joanna Mary and--the world--but my health.
      A man thinks about these things--sometimes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She let her hands rest on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Keir--but when you're in the firm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not in it yet, my dear. Yes, that might make a
      difference. You'll have to wait, Syb. I mean it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed to sit and reflect, and then she put up one of
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been very good to me, Keir. I'll wait."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wise kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      He bent down and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir found it a difficult winter. In fact it was the
      first winter that made him conscious of the weather, of its
      raw drabness, its sordid monotony. There was no beauty, no
      sting in it, no frost or snow, just a congealed and foggy
      rawness. Never before had he caught himself fussing about
      his health, or feeling worried when he got wet. He was a
      married man with a family and a new accumulation of
      responsibilities, prospective lawn-mowers, prospective
      children, interest on a mortgage, insurance contributions,
      gas bills, electric light bills. He was sure that Sybil was
      careless about the electric light. A new bulb needed in the
      living-room? Why, the previous one had survived less than
      five months. He had had to buy a pram for Joanna Mary. He
      was much more careful about turning up his coat collar when
      he cycled home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, Messrs. Samson &amp; Hoad were building a new house
      in the Abbey Lands Park for an impatient and rather wealthy
      client, a Mr. Gibson, who had engaged an architect with
      ideas. The house was to be unusual, and the architect's
      ideas upon this particular house's roof were more than
      unusual, and when Keir was shown the plan, he rumpled up
      his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It won't work, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Mr. Samson had an argument with the architect, who
      was a self-assertive theorist. When it was suggested to him
      that the roof was not practical, he became throaty and
      superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, if you and your carpenter aren't up to the
      job--The specifications are perfectly plain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir intercepted a glance from Mr. Samson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If your client wants a roof like that--we can do it--at a
      price, but if you could cut out--those valleys and gables."
    </p>
    <p>
      The architect would cut out nothing, and his client
      seconded him. Keir spent hours wrestling with the problem
      of that roof. It was a silly, ostentatious, high-brow
      affair, like the product of the new art that is in a hurry
      to create an effect without learning to draw. Keir had a
      feeling that Mr. Hoad, a rather smeary man with pince-nez
      who checked all the plans and specifications, was
      sniggering over his--Keir's dilemma. Mr. Hoad was polite,
      soft soap, to everybody, and nobody liked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This roof, Smith--rather--subtle--what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir did put the pieces of the puzzle together, though
      the timber-work would be quite unorthodox. It was a silly,
      tricky job, and it worried him for weeks and made him a
      little irritable when Joanna Mary was in a protesting mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, can't you shut the kid up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be so--touchy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, Syb. I've been worried today."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was thinking that he would like to take Mr. Gibson's
      architect and hang him by the seat of his trousers to one
      of those eccentric gables.
    </p>
    <p>
      In February, Joanna Mary stirred up a panic at "Merrow" by
      developing bronchitis. Her little chest was full of
      wheezings and bubblings, and the doctor came twice a day,
      and Sybil insisted on sitting up with Joanna. She seemed to
      regard the child's illness as a personal challenge, a
      bitter accusation, and on the third night she looked so
      tired and tragic that Keir insisted upon her going to bed.
      He said that he would sit up with Joanna, but Sybil would
      not easily be persuaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel it's my fault, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can it be your fault? Now, you go to bed, kid. You're
      just about all in."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so determined that Sybil should get some sleep that
      he stood over her while she undressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure it's no use, Keir. I shan't sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      But sleep she did, and Joanna Mary, as though she had been
      playing off a joke upon her mother, ceased to produce
      infantile wet noises and became as mild as milk. She too
      slept, and Keir, reading a book by the light of a shaded
      candle, listened to the small creature's quiet breathing;
      and wondered at it. Joanna had given them a devil of a
      fright, and now her two small fists seemed to clutch and
      possess the jest. Ultimately Keir lay down on the floor
      with a cushion under his head, and the candle burned itself
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness of a winter morning he was roused by Sybil
      putting a naked foot upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Keir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat up, feeling abashed and a little bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo--I must have dropped off. She was sleeping
      like--like--"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a scratching of a match, and by its momentary
      light he saw Sybil leaning over Joanna Mary's cot. Joanna
      Mary opened her eyes and greeted her mother with a
      toothless smile. The match flickered out, and in the
      darkness Keir groped for the electric switch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's all right, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he felt that Sybil would hold him guilty of sleeping at
      his post. Her voice reproved him in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, do turn on the light."
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Keir been told two years ago that he would be involved
      in all these domesticities, he would have been more
      doubting than a doubting Thomas. Like the ironic young
      Frenchman who was a rationalist in the matter of sex, he
      would have exclaimed on seeing a man loaded up with
      parcels: <i>"Voilà le mari!"</i> Keir was well and truly
      loaded, and if he sometimes regretted the bondage, he could
      cry to his insurgent self: "Get thee behind me, Satan."
      Yet, being the child of his generation, he understood his
      generation's challenging of the old landmarks and
      boundaries, its urge to kick down fences or leap over them.
      It was an experimental age. It smiled ironically in the
      face of tradition. Its world was the world of the moment,
      not some hypothetical heaven to be attained by climbing the
      Scala Sancta of negation. This young world asked for more
      money, more movement, more self-assertion. Life was to be a
      playing-field, not a factory.
    </p>
    <p>
      But with a wife and a child and a mortgage on your house it
      is not very easy to conduct experiments, and with such a
      boat-load of merchandise in his charge Keir understood that
      it was his business to keep in mid-stream and look out for
      notices that shouted "Danger." He could not risk his human
      cargo at the weir's edge or dare a ducking. He had become
      careful, or carefulness had been forced upon him. He knew
      the cave-man's fear of things that prowled in the night. It
      was new to him--this fear. It was like some blackmailing
      rogue who had waited for Keir to commit himself and now
      followed him about. Cycling home on those winter nights,
      and especially when the roads were befogged, he found
      himself dismounting at dangerous corners like some careful
      old gentleman. No longer did he dare the traffic with the
      confidence of some irresponsible, vainglorious boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had other moods. There were days when the Cain in
      him lusted to turn upon and slay the dutiful Abel, the dull
      good fellow who sacrificed to the conventions. In seducing
      him Sybil had somehow taught him to look at other women.
      They were part of his restlessness, coming and going in the
      dim or brilliant streets, creatures of mystery, provoking
      his sense of beauty. Strange women! And sometimes he would
      resent the finality of marriage because it symbolized a
      little world in which the adventures were so small and
      calculable. He may have suffered from the illusion which
      fools most men, that other women are different from the
      wife at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened in February that Mr. Lugard of Darvels sent to
      Mr. Samson to borrow Keir for an hour. The door of a
      Jacobean cupboard in the Darvels library needed re-hanging,
      and Mr. Lugard could be content with nothing but an expert.
      The day was gloomy and dim, and at four o'clock Keir had to
      turn on the lights in that very beautiful room. He was at
      work in the cupboard when Mr. Lugard came in to look for a
      book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard belonged to another world, a world that should
      have been Keir's world and was not. His appearance always
      suggested to Keir one of the old Norse vikings, but a
      gentle viking, whose hands handled books instead of a
      sword.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to Keir as one lover of craftsmanship speaks to
      another. He used Keir's Christian name. He ran his fingers
      over the oak.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some patina--there. You know, Keir, I can't swallow the
      new furniture."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know what you mean, sir. What I call polished
      sugar-boxes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard laughed and showed Keir his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Benvenuto Cellini. Yes, we're off to Italy for six weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's eyes rested for a moment on the book, and it
      occurred to Mr. Lugard that Keir might well have lived his
      life in Renaissance Florence with a Medici as his patron.
      Yes, Keir should have belonged to the colour and the
      passion and the pride of that Italian city. And he divined
      in Keir a little bitterness, a flame that was concealed, a
      something that was unsatisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir found himself in Kingham High Street. A drizzle had
      set in, and the roadway was so greasy and the High Street
      such a tangle of traffic that Keir dismounted and wheeled
      his bike. He could assert that the only way to transcend
      modern traffic was to be part of it in a car. Also the
      pavements were as congested as the roadway. The world
      seemed full of women and girls who had nothing to do but
      loiter and look at the shop-windows, and yet Keir
      understood that to the crowd Kingham High Street was a
      picture-show. On so dismal a night these bright windows
      were pleasant, especially to those who escaped for an hour
      from some melancholy back street. Pictures, colour, light,
      Italy! Over the way he saw a white building like a large
      lady wearing all her jewelry, red lights, and green lights,
      and orange lights, rubies, emeralds, topaz. A transparency
      blazing across the façade announced: "Serena Segovia.
      <i>The Lamp of Love."</i> Keir, pausing to contemplate all
      this seductive glare, was wise as to its significance.
      Women and girls were pouring into the place to share
      Serena's luscious love-affair and to escape for a little
      while from the gas-cooker and the sink. Well, it was
      understandable. Had he no hunger for other worlds, Italy,
      blue distances of sea and sky and mountain?
    </p>
    <p>
      Two young men paused close to him on the edge of the
      pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going in, Bert?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He who was questioned laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Serena--the world's prize tart! No, I've got something of
      my own to play with when the shops shut."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir and his bicycle moved themselves on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The familiar puddles of the Abbey Lands lane waited for his
      tires to squelch through them. He came to the little white
      gate in the thorn hedge and saw the yellow curtains of
      "Merrow's" living-room lit up from within. Too much
      electric light for which you had to pay, and not sufficient
      sunlight that was gratis. Irritably he thrust the front
      wheel of his bicycle against the gate, but the gate was
      latched and it snubbed his impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he was tired. The zest and the adventure seemed to
      have gone from life. He went and put his bicycle away in
      the small shed at the back of the bungalow. He remembered
      that the back wheel of Sybil's machine was punctured, and
      that she had asked him to mend it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he opened the back door, Joanna Mary discovered
      something in life to arouse her young indignation. She
      protested, and so did her father's tired temper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That kid always seems to be squalling. What's the matter
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was gathering Joanna Mary to her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She can't help it. Didn't you ever cry when you were a
      child?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir flung his hat into a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, probably. I don't remember. We seem born to teeth and
      trouble. Tea ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a poignant look. She had discovered that when
      Keir had a certain dark mood on him, it was better to keep
      the curtains drawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week later he was down with influenza, and Sybil was
      nursing him, and he was made to realize that his wife could
      be a very unselfish and consoling creature. She was
      responsible for all the housework and Joanna Mary and a man
      who had to have his meals carried to him. Also, he
      discovered that Sybil's sympathy was very much a thing of
      the heart. She was troubled for his sake. She would get up
      in the middle of the night and bring him hot milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Serena Segovia!
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil's eyes were compassionate and gentle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink it down, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was glad of her gentleness. He began to understand that
      there was a quality in Sybil's love that could confound the
      restlessness of the bitter streets. It lasted. It seemed to
      grow out of the ground and to put forth foliage and
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get back into bed, kid; you'll catch cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm all right, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the darkness he felt comforted by the nearness of
      Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But if Keir's passion to express that which was Keir
      transcended the little white walls of "Merrow," the small
      house was no egg-shell. Its new solidity symbolized the new
      solidity of Sybil, a young woman to whom life had become
      amazingly static because of the amazing aliveness of Joanna
      Mary. A contemporary flippancy might have accused Sybil of
      being a hopeless primitive whose sense of adventure was
      satisfied by mere domesticities. She did the same silly
      things every day in company with Joanna Mary, and she
      appeared to find in them complete satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were moments when Keir wondered at his wife. She was
      not topical. She did not seem to belong to a generation
      that had attained to the social singularities of the
      tennis-court, the motor-coach, and the picture-house. She
      was much less interested in the world's shop-window. She
      wheeled Joanna Mary out in her pram, and if she sometimes
      dusted Keir's books, she did it without regarding them as
      serious contributions to man's ascent into the
      self-conscious. Her environment and her reactions to it
      were both simple and very limited. "Merrow" did not allow
      itself the luxury of a daily paper, but Keir did buy one of
      the best of the Sunday journals, and when he had read it,
      it was pounced upon by Sybil and reduced to domestic uses.
      She wanted it for lighting the fires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the Sabbath bulk suffice her. Always she was short
      of paper, and her criticism, ignoring leaders and articles
      upon finance and the international situation, centred upon
      the inadequacy of those crumpled sheets. India was nothing
      to her, the bankruptcy of the National Insurance Fund less
      than a dream. It seemed to her absurd that with a prodigal
      and prolific press a little house such as "Merrow" should
      be short of waste-paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't get enough of it, Keir, no, not in the winter."
    </p>
    <p>
      She never read the paper as its editor presumed it should
      be read; she burned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll have to save up during the summer, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, that was all very well, but what about February,
      March, and April?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't you get me some shavings? Your workshop must be
      full of shavings."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, and twice a week Keir stuffed shavings into a sack
      and carried the kindling home on the handles of his bike.
      It became known in the shop he made off with this plunder,
      and his traditional carefulness became even more of an
      offence to his fellows. He never stood a chap a drink and
      he scraped up the shop's shavings! But Sybil was delighted.
      Canadian wood-pulp that had been digested and transformed
      into journalistic cerebrations was supplemented by the
      products of the chisel and the plane. Sybil had her boiler
      nicely heated, while India sizzled unheard. She knew
      nothing of Gandhi, or of self-determination, or of Russia's
      Five Year Plan. She needed hot water for the house and for
      Joanna Mary, and she had it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inevitably, Keir's periods of restlessness were not
      appeased by the simplicities of Sybil. He was interested in
      things of which she knew nothing. She could not and perhaps
      would not emerge from the little world that was "Merrow."
      He did not realize it, but he was talking less and less to
      Sybil, for on one of those rare occasions when he had tried
      to persuade her to be a listener, he had watched her
      short-sighted brown eyes grow inattentive. A man may like
      to show off his cleverness, and Keir was human. He was
      telling Sybil that the chalk hills from which "Merrow" had
      taken its name had once been under the sea, and Sybil
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not quite so silly as that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it's a fact. Those hills were built up by the bodies
      of millions upon millions of minute sea-creatures--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Sybil believed him she was not interested. She was
      not to be lured upon excursions into any of the ologies.
      Invariably her perceptions, momentarily distracted,
      reverted to the familiar objects of her little world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Keir--I forgot to tell you they're just coming up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That leaves me guessing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean--the broad beans."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mentally she was no companion for a young man whose
      curiosity--diverted for a year towards sex and
      marriage,--had re-emerged and with a restlessness that
      promised perils of its own. Sybil could talk about nothing
      but Joanna Mary and all the multitudinous trivialities of a
      small and semi-suburban home. If Keir tried to plunge into
      other waters, she would sit down and wait for him on the
      bank, and when--perforce--he returned from an element in
      which she could not express herself, she would join the
      interrupted ends of her conversation and happily continue
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you notice--the milk, Keir? I'm sure it's watered. I'm
      going to change and try Higson's. It says on their van that
      they keep their own cows."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir gave it up. There was something of the gentle Jersey
      cow in Sybil. Even her eyes--And he supposed that his wife
      was a creature to whom you made the simplest of noises.
      Certainly, she and Joanna Mary understood each other better
      than did Keir and his small daughter. But there were
      moments when he was conscious of an increasing loneliness.
      He knew moods of impatience, of secret resentment. Mere
      physical contact could not satisfy him. It might be as
      cloying as sugar and the scent of roses when the crave in
      you was for strong wine. Moreover, Sybil was
      sweet-tempered, and if she was aware of his deep, dark
      moods, they were no more to her than transient puddles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dear, utter idiot!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught himself using those words in secret, and he was
      shocked by them. Did she suspect? Did she ever realize that
      she bored him, and that the simple notes that were within
      her compass made him feel that he was listening to some
      child learning to play upon the piano? Always those same
      trite sweet notes, a little trivial melody, no wrath, no
      striving towards the inexpressible, no deep and crashing
      chords.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Early in April Sybil gave Keir a piece of information that
      was not news to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, they're going to build on the next plot. Isn't
      it a pity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She explained to him that while she had been at work in the
      "Merrow" garden, two men had arrived and had started to cut
      a gap in the thorn hedge separating the adjoining plot from
      the lane, and later in the day a lorry had driven in with a
      load of building material, and the two men had proceeded to
      erect a temporary shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That was one of our lorries, kid. We are putting up a
      bungalow for a woman who runs a shop in Kingham."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then you know, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I heard about it a week or two ago. We didn't buy the
      whole landscape, Syb. And, after all, this isn't Paragon
      Place."
    </p>
    <p>
      The new bungalow came into being on the adjoining plot, and
      Sybil realized that it was to be a much larger and more
      important product than "Merrow." There was no architect in
      charge of the work, for Mrs. Challis, who--under the name
      of "Fifine"--supplied Kingham with all the latest models in
      the way of hats and frocks, was a woman of very definite
      ideas and a nice sense of the value of money. She knew what
      she wanted. She was an emphatic person both physically and
      mentally. If she ran her establishment very successfully
      under a French name, she too was somewhat French in her
      composition and her capacity. She was a confection, as
      suggestive as one of those exquisite products that can be
      purchased at a Parisian shop and just as hard as the
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil, very much at work in the "Merrow" garden, while
      keeping an eye on Joanna Mary, who was asleep in her pram
      under the beech tree, had her first glimpse of Mrs. Bertha
      Challis. Sybil's hands were dirty, for she was planting out
      clarkia and godetia seedlings and puddling them in with
      water from a can. Also she was wearing a utility frock, and
      it had split under one arm, and it showed the stains of
      many hours of housework. Moreover, it happened to be one of
      those warm spring evenings when midges arrive and bite
      viciously, and in making a dab at her forehead Sybil had
      left a streak of dirt above one eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Challis was immaculate and cool. She arrived in a
      small and highly coloured car--cream and apple-green. She
      banged the door of the car and passed through the gap in
      the thorn hedge. The shape of her was a slim black spathe
      topped by a very yellow head to which was attached one of
      the little black knitted caps which happened to be
      fashionable. Her mouth was a vivid streak. In age she might
      have been anything between thirty and forty-five, but she
      had one of those thick white skins that retain a perfect
      texture. Her poise, the product of vital self-assurance and
      the seductive cynicism of the successful saleswoman, linked
      Shaftesbury Avenue to Ascot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Challis had brought her little yellow bag with her,
      and in it her cigarette-case, but she had forgotten her
      matches. The lapse was exceptional. With the cigarette
      stuck in her red mouth she explored the interior of the
      yellow bag. One of the damned girls must have been at her
      bag! She snapped the catch of the bag, glanced sharply in
      the direction of the intervening fence, and discovered
      Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil had been observing her, and the concentrated stare of
      Sybil's brown eyes may have caused Mrs. Challis to react to
      that almost childish scrutiny. But she wanted a match, and
      this rather untidy young person might provide one.
    </p>
    <p>
      She approached the fence, picking her way between a stack
      of bricks and a squdge of mortar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse me, could you let me have a match?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Being what she was, the daughter of a suburban tradesman
      with business in her blood, and modernity and modes part of
      her texture, she saw Sybil both as a prospective neighbour
      and an untidy and over-domesticated creature. Yes, that
      pram! God bless our happy home! And the girl's frock had
      once been a cheap reach-me-down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil, reacting in her own fashion both to the request and
      to the refined flippancy of "Madame," put down her basket
      of seedlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went for a box of matches, but not with any feeling of
      friendliness, for to the Sybils of this world Mrs. Challis
      was somehow a fiery cross. Her eyes were the eyes of the
      huntress.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excuse my hands being so dirty."
    </p>
    <p>
      The match-box was passed across the wire fence, and Mrs.
      Challis lit her cigarette. The state of Sybil's hands was
      no concern of hers. This neighbour was a young woman who
      gardened and produced babies, and whose hair had not been
      attended to professionally for at least a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. Just looked in to see how the men are getting on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance rested for a moment on Joanna Mary's pram. Did
      that infant grow vocal?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil, suddenly and acutely self-conscious and resenting
      it, waited for the return of the match-box. For she would
      have said that Mrs. Challis when considered objectively was
      just like some of the smart women who had lunched and tea'd
      at Darvels, but yet not quite so. The child in Sybil was
      intuitively destructive so far as Mrs. Challis's culture
      was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The match-box was returned to her by a nicely manicured
      hand with nails tinted a deep rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks--so much. You garden--I see. Marvellous!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the smudge of dirt above Sybil's eyebrow,
      nodded casually, and moved away, leaving Sybil holding the
      match-box as though Mrs. Challis's touch had contaminated
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it was no more than a clash of types, the brass pot and
      white china, and Sybil, reabsorbed in the garden and Joanna
      Mary, forgot all about Mrs. Bertha Challis. She inferred
      that there would be no neighbourliness between "Merrow" and
      the more pretentious person next door. "Fifine's"
      establishment was a luxury-shop, and a very successful one
      in spite of depressed trade and unlimited competition, for
      Mrs. Challis was not just lipstick and yellow head and
      self-assurance. She was a woman of ideas. She relished life
      and its adventure, and as a hedonist she had a philosophy
      of her own. She might be interested in men and money, but
      she was interested in other things. The war had left her a
      young widow, and she had found the post-war world and its
      business full of banditry.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not till the walls were up that Sybil realized
      Keir's involvement in the erection of the bungalow next
      door. He was to be responsible for Mrs. Challis's roof and
      floors and for more than these conventional necessities,
      for Mrs. Challis was nothing if not up to date. She read D.
      H. Lawrence and saw significance in Epstein. Her bungalow
      was to possess radiators and running water in the bedrooms,
      a refrigerator, and various labour-saving devices, but Keir
      was concerned in her craze for built-in cupboards. They
      were to be recessed wardrobes with polished walnut doors,
      and if the walnut was only veneer, it was all the more
      serious a challenge to craftsmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Challis had been frank with Mr. Samson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you people do it, or shall I have to get somebody down
      from town?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson had assured her that his foreman carpenter was
      capable of carrying out the work--at a price, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, chuck me in an additional estimate. I am
      drawing my own designs. You had better send your man along
      to see me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both Keir and Mrs. Challis discovered at that first
      interview a mutual unexpectedness, for Mrs. Challis was
      more sympathetic to men than she was to women. She might
      dress for her own sex. Her more subtle nudities were
      reserved for the male. She and Keir met in her office
      behind "Fifine's" showroom. She sat at her desk and smoked
      a cigarette and pushed a set of drawings at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the sort of thing I want. Tumble to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      While Keir was examining her sketches, she endorsed cheques
      and between the signatures examined Keir. The dark
      intelligent insurgence of him struck her as unusual. There
      was colour in Keir. He was both sharp edge and shadow, and
      most maleness was so flat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed the pieces of paper from one hand to the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Flush with the wall. You want us to use the
      recesses between the chimneys and--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This one shows the doors open. Fittings. Plenty of hanging
      space."
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "Most wardrobes and cupboards are fool products.
      Mine have got to be two feet deep. A dozen frocks have to
      hang--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mirrors? On the insides of the doors?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was quick of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two--I suppose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "I see you've sketched in a lot of things like
      pigeonholes. Much better have trays, something to slide out
      and show you at once what's there. Cost more--naturally."
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed the black end of her fountain pen against a
      full lower lip and considered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, naturally, provided the trays don't stick. I'm an
      impatient sort of person. I like things--oiled."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her and smiled, and when she returned his
      smile, something linked them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, cheap inefficiency that sticks makes one furious."
    </p>
    <p>
      She tapped her red mouth with the pen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you'll be responsible--I understand? Well, things will
      be O.K."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      In order to arrive at his day's work Keir only had to pass
      out of the gate of "Merrow," walk some ten paces along the
      lane, and turn to the left through the gap in the thorn
      hedge, and, to begin with, the simplicity of the ritual
      pleased Sybil. It was easy for Keir, and it was easy for
      the housewife. She had her man back straightway to his
      meals, and it was possible to suggest that Keir might help
      her in the garden, for June and its weeds and its
      multifarious activities were of serious moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You might put out those young lettuces for me, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did help her in the garden, but there were other
      evenings when he told her that he would have to ride into
      Kingham. He needed certain things from the shop or from the
      "stores," or he had to see and discuss points with Mr.
      Samson. She let him go. In fact she was quite happy about
      Keir so long as he was at work upon the joists and rafters
      of the new bungalow. Once or twice a week the Challis woman
      appeared in her salad and cream car and observed how
      matters were progressing, but to Sybil she was no Serena
      Segovia, no modish Circe with a cigarette. For to Sybil
      Mrs. Challis belonged to another world. It was as though
      she stepped out of <i>Vogue</i> or <i>Britannia &amp;</i>
      <i>Eve,</i> and though Sybil may sometimes have dipped into
      these journals during her Darvels days, they were to her
      almost as fabulous as Paris and Dinard and Cannes. She
      could not imagine Keir becoming translated into that sort
      of language.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when the brown tiled roof went on next door, and the
      place became hooded and concealed, a little cloud-shadow
      seemed to arrive and remain above the building. At least,
      that was its effect upon Sybil. That which had been visible
      became shut up in a cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plasterers had been in, and for some days Keir's daily
      work had taken him either to the shop or to other
      contracts, but when the ceilings and wall surfaces were
      complete, he returned to the house of Mrs. Challis. He let
      it be known that he would be working overtime on the job,
      but that it was no great hardship when nothing but a wire
      fence divided him from his labour and his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and Sybil had never discussed Mrs. Challis, but on this
      particular evening Sybil let fall a remark.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She looks a funny sort of woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's face expressed a kind of wooden obscurity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funny! How do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--just funny. What I'd call an amateur lady, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went into the spare bedroom and squatted down in front
      of the bookcase to look for a particular book, and Sybil's
      voice followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There must be money in hats."
    </p>
    <p>
      His reply was that it depended upon the hats and how you
      sold them. He came back with his book and appeared rather
      ostentatiously interested in it. He was going out into the
      garden to read for half an hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was folding up the supper cloth. She said: "I
      shouldn't care to be that woman's maid. She's got one of
      those nasty mouths.--Why's she in such a hurry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Challis wants to get into the house, that's all. I
      suppose it's natural. I can remember you cycling over here
      every evening and feeling the walls."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil held the cloth for a moment against her bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, yes, I did, but that was different."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's overtime continued, and on those summer evenings he
      would be the only man at work in the new bungalow, fixing
      skirting-boards and hanging doors. Those special cupboards
      of Mrs. Challis's were being roughed out in the shop and
      sent on to Keir to assemble and fit. The firm had been put
      to some trouble in procuring walnut veneer, and the first
      consignment had proved unsatisfactory. It would appear from
      the frequency of her visits that Mrs. Challis was growing
      impatient, but Keir was not finding her impatient. She came
      to the bungalow nearly every evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had begun to listen for the sound of her car. Not that
      he broke off work when he heard it. In fact he might appear
      more intensely absorbed, bending over the bench that had
      been installed in one of the rooms. And yet--inwardly--he
      would be acutely conscious of an approach, a nearness, a
      sudden presence, the drift of a perfume. In their mutual
      interplay they had reached a stage where the obvious
      salutation had become superfluous. She was not there--and
      she was there. That sheath-like figure of hers might have
      slipped in on a beam of light.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this evening she paused in the doorway. She saw Keir's
      head in a streak of sunlight. He was bending over the bench
      under a window, and the window looked towards the sunset.
      He appeared to be unaware of her presence, but she was wise
      as to his awareness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lend me a foot-rule, will you? I've come to measure for
      curtains."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed her a boxwood rule. He seemed to look up at her
      from under dark eyebrows. Her blue eyes were more level and
      direct.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks. It's a little quiet at the shop, and I'm turning
      one of the girls on to making frillies for the windows."
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood his dark aloofness. It both interested and
      provoked her. She divined the smoulder in him. The sex of
      her was like a lamp which she flashed on him in the soft
      gloom of their apartness. A carpenter, a working man! But
      what was she but a working woman dressed to the part. The
      lure was so various, and he had beautifully shaped ears,
      clever hands, and a sensitive skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ought to have a box or something."
    </p>
    <p>
      He found a step-ladder and placed it by the window. She
      climbed two steps, and her body shut off the light from
      him. Its blackness took to itself a golden aura.
    </p>
    <p>
      She measured the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Five foot six. Jot it down for me, will you? Yes, on any
      odd piece of wood."
    </p>
    <p>
      She climbed to the top of the steps and sat there, and her
      downward glance was both intimate and amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was your father, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His head rose to her and the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A clerk in a coal-merchant's office."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine was a butcher. Our friend D. H. had a miner for his
      dad. Have you read that book I lent you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any reactions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His hands rested on the bench. He looked out and past her
      through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, one of surprise that a book like that--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Should be read in Kingham High Street and by a woman who
      looks like a mannequin?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, one's uniform, one's pose! But we people who have
      to scuffle out a career throw off a damned lot of humbug. A
      fellow like D. H. may be fanatically candid, but I don't
      follow him everywhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up at her obliquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where and where not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, socialist slop. When you have to run a show with
      half a dozen young wenches in it--you learn a few things
      about life. What about my mouth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her mouth and seemed to flinch like Adam in
      the presence of the forbidden fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could say things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite. If some of those slopmongers--the social
      idealists--would say to the public--what I say to my
      girls--! You know, D. H. is lovely on paper, but I'm sure
      he would have made a devil of a mess of running a Lyons
      tea-shop. There are two kinds of realists, my dear, the
      theoretical and the practical."
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned sideways against the bench. He seemed shy of
      observing her directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to look after men. Yes, human nature gets your
      theory and blows it like froth off a pint of beer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you drink beer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever been to Sicily?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I went there last year for a fortnight. Saved up for it.
      Yes, saw old D. H.'s villa. You'll go there--some day."
    </p>
    <p>
      The little white box that was "Merrow" could not be seen
      from that particular window, but from the set of Keir's
      head she divined the direction of his inward glance. He go
      to Sicily with a wife and Joanna Mary? Moreover, he was not
      crying for Sicily at that moment. Sex sat upon a
      step-ladder against a Homeric sky, and the apples of the
      Hesperides gleamed under that very new ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came down the steps and became interested in the work
      he had been setting out on the bench. She stood very close
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that? One of my cupboard doors?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She ran a finger over the walnut.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almost as smooth--as--skin."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      The affair of Mrs. Challis provided Keir with what the lady
      herself would have described as unexpected reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It made him feel furtive, and in feeling furtive he was
      angry with himself and with Bertha Challis, but he was not
      angry with Sybil. He found himself slinking back to
      "Merrow" and putting on an air of extreme cheerfulness as
      he entered the little white gate. He was more openly
      affectionate to Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet anguish of sex unsatisfied! He would fool himself
      with the assurance that he had found a woman with a mind
      and a personality, a woman who understood him, a woman to
      whom he could talk. Poor Sybil hadn't an idea in her head.
      She was like the little white pot that was kept filled with
      jam, plum and apple or raspberry, and was there ready for
      the domestic spoon. She suspected nothing, divined nothing;
      at least--he supposed so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you will soon have finished next door, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Finished--when the perfumed person of Mrs. Challis was
      still a flower that had not been plucked! He did not know
      that his carefully cheerful face betrayed a little secret
      smile, and that Sybil, collecting articles on a tray with
      eyes that seemed downcast and unsuspecting, knew and was
      afraid. For that was part of the strangeness of Sybil; she
      both knew and carried that knowledge within her like an
      unborn child. She did not cry out or accuse. There was a
      stillness about her. It seemed so incredible that Keir--
    </p>
    <p>
      She had seen--But what had she seen?
    </p>
    <p>
      The thing had shocked her. She wanted to close a door
      gently and slip silently away to sit beside Joanna Mary and
      wonder--Yes, that world-wise cook at Darvels had assured
      her that all men were fools. But Keir--! Something in her
      crouched like a hare, with brown eyes big and frightened.
      Perhaps she had a feeling that the thing would not happen
      because she refused to believe that it could happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was so difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood that there were deeps in Keir that reminded
      her of a well in a cottage garden she had known as a child.
      You lifted the timber trap-door and saw a mysterious circle
      of gloom, moist bricks, perhaps slimy things. She had been
      fascinated and frightened by that well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes she felt a sudden rage against Mrs. Challis. She
      would pick up Joanna Mary and walk up and down, up and
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      That other woman ruffling her husband's hair!
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The bungalow next door had its gates in place, and on one
      of them was painted "My Cot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Challis should have been above and beyond such a
      convention, but when her dear "D. H." was subtracted from
      the lady, she was as much like a yellow cat as her less
      curious contemporaries. She had over-emphasized a topical
      flippancy. She could smoke her cigarette in a long black
      holder and confound the natural with the decadent. She
      covered her primitiveness with so much paint that when the
      paint was removed, your romanticist would be confounded by
      the rawness of the substructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her furniture had arrived. It too was topical, flippant,
      and flimsy. She was the sort of woman who would be
      satisfied with a car, an ash-tray, and a divan-bed. Keir,
      as the interesting and intense young ouvrier, had been
      extruded. All the walnut doors were hung--and he still
      supposed--
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no yesterday in the Challis calendar. She was
      poised on the present with her toes touching tomorrow. She
      was consumed by the insensate restlessness of a period.
      What you did yesterday was dead. When you had experienced a
      particular thing or person, you reached out a hand to the
      next dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was not made for a Juan. He was too difficult, too
      intense. He had not the easy smirk that said: "Well, that's
      that, old thing. Thanks awfully. It's been simply
      marvellous. Cheeri-o." He both wanted to be the complete
      and passionate fool, and yet was full of dark qualms and
      hesitations. He both seized and let go and in the midst of
      a climax stood shaking. Like a very sensitive man who had
      received no education from sisters, he somehow imagined
      that there was a sacred something in woman, but he
      misconstrued his Bertha Challis. She wanted to play, she
      wanted to suck this particular orange, but she believed
      that for all sucked oranges there should be dustbins.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, beloved!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had ventured on some such language, and she had looked
      at him out of half-shut eyes and grimaced as though that
      sort of sweet stuff could be sour. No, certainly it wasn't
      modern and promiscuous and sufficiently casual. Well,
      really! Homespun! Yes, rather like his shirts, which that
      dowdy little person next door washed once a week and hung
      up on a line. A particular man might be intense and
      interesting and a novelty for the period of a month or so,
      but when he was apt to be as serious as his shirts--
    </p>
    <p>
      She had satisfied herself with Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he, trembling disillusioned, somehow ashamed, and yet
      feeling a little vainglorious and triumphant, went away to
      brood over the experience. She had giggled, yes--actually
      giggled. He had been a little clumsy and apologetic, both
      passionate and diffident. He had imagined--Well, what?--A
      kind of submergence in rhapsody, two sun-warmed bunches of
      grapes in contact, utter self-forgetfulness in the sacred
      and exquisite rite. And she had said: "Wait a
      bit--you're--" There had been a twinge of annoyance on her
      face. And somehow he had a feeling that he had bungled the
      business, and not for a moment had he been able to forget
      himself in it. He had a suspicion that he had failed to
      satisfy her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had laughed, and managed the inevitable anticlimax with
      capable casualness, but behind her laughter he had fancied
      that there was a touch of sulkiness, of balked
      dissatisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a wet evening, and he was glad of the rain, for it
      covered his retreat. He picked his bicycle out of the back
      of Mrs. Challis's hedge and wheeled it out of her gate and
      in at the gate of "Merrow." He felt most horribly furtive
      during the next sixty seconds. Supposing Sybil--? But he
      found her in the living-room with a pile of black currants
      on a sheet of newspaper spread upon the table, preparing
      the fruit for jam, and dropping it into a white china bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes and looked at him, and her eyes were as
      dark as the fruit. Her fingers were stained with its
      juices, and suddenly he was ashamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Syb, I'm late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her glance was steady and a little strange. It did not
      accuse. It had for him the quality of innocence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wet, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing to speak of."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her and knew it to be a Judas kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, jam! I'll give you a hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and shredded the fruit with her, and once or
      twice their hands touched over the pile of currants. And
      she was silent. She looked at him occasionally in that
      mute, strange way as though his shrouded face was a wound,
      and hers the pain. Did she suspect? And, feeling furtive in
      her presence, he loathed himself. That affair should cease.
      It was abominable, treacherous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet next day and during the days that followed he was made
      to realize how subtly such a sex infection permeates the
      blood. His own imagination importuned him like a procuress.
      It even played upon his vanity. He was obsessed by a sense
      of failure, by the incompleteness of that previous
      occasion, by a sense of boyish bungling. He had been too
      shy, too much in a hurry. He had not behaved as the
      triumphantly passionate and consoling male. He--Yes, he
      must attain finality and, having attained it, retrieve
      himself and safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would say: "This can't go on, Bert, you know. It's just
      our fate. I've got to think of my kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was full of cowardice and confusion, consumed by a
      miserable restlessness that exhausted him like a fever. He
      could not concentrate upon his work, for his essential self
      seemed to be slipping away round some secret corner. And
      then in a moment of clumsy abstraction he cut himself badly
      with a chisel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood spurted, and suddenly and instantly he was
      thinking of Sybil. He wanted to run to Sybil, the
      inevitable and assuaging Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone knotted a handkerchief round his arm, and the red
      spurt at the wrist ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a job for the doctor, my lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening Sybil was very gentle to him. She carried two
      chairs out to the shade of the beech tree. She sat by him
      and sewed. Joanna Mary had been put to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it hurt much, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was remembering her shocked face when he had appeared
      with that bandaged arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just smarts a bit, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't go to work for a day or two. A cut like that's
      serious."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The salving of their mutual sanity was Sybil's.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could have said to him: "My dear, if only you knew that
      I know all that there is to be known about loving. And if I
      could tell you all that I know about--her, what you have
      not seen--"
    </p>
    <p>
      But she did not tell him. She did not blurt out her
      knowledge. There was that in her which flinched with an
      intuitive, childish sensitiveness from a trust torn to
      tatters. She lay awake beside him at night wondering. Her
      hands went on touching the intimate simple objects of the
      home as though in them she experienced security,
      reassurance. She tied up her flowers, washed and fed Joanna
      Mary, and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In her simple wisdom she waited for Keir to find out who
      was the fool. If it was to be discovered, it was better
      that he should discover it for himself. Had she been more
      of the egoist and less the mother of Joanna Mary, she might
      have blazed at him. All this shame and humiliation, this
      secret fear!
    </p>
    <p>
      She said to herself: "I suppose a man's not quite himself
      when a woman like that gets hold of him. But he'll find
      out. I hate her for the way she's hurting him."
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening she heard the front door of "Merrow" open. Keir
      had been working late. It was a sultry night, and a heavy
      cloud canopy had brought down a deep and premature dusk.
      Sybil had been in to look at Joanna Mary, who was restless
      with the heat. She came out into the dark passage as Keir
      closed the door. The switch of the electric light was close
      to her hand, and she turned it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw her husband's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her instant impulse was to bring back the darkness. She did
      so. They stood within six feet of each other in that narrow
      passage, and the darkness seemed to join them together.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your supper's ready, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want any supper, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so hot in the house. Jo has been a little fretful.
      There must be thunder about."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was aware of a movement at the other end of the
      passage. Keir had reopened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--I think so. It's been working up all day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go and sit outside, Keir, under the tree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right-o."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I left the chairs there."
    </p>
    <p>
      In crossing the grass Keir stumbled over some object lying
      in the darkness, a small wooden box half full of weeds that
      Sybil had left there, but there was no responsive flare of
      impatience or of anger. He emitted a little sound that was
      like a sigh. His suddenly deflated self was unresisting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, Keir. How silly of me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no need for her to feel sorry, and he said so. He
      was aware of the cool, dark mass of the tree. He waited for
      her to sit down in one of the deck-chairs. He stood a
      moment, feeling inarticulate and awkward. Then he too sat
      down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems cooler here, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much cooler."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt her hand touching his knee. It was tentative and
      timid, and suddenly he was on the edge of things. He got
      hold of her hand in the darkness. He was aware of her
      fingers contracting on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Syb--I've--I've been such a ---- fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Don't ask me about it. I'm--I'm--sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little sound from his wife. He sat up in the
      chair and realized that she was weeping, but her hand held
      fast to his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Keir--I knew you'd find out.--I knew somehow it
      wouldn't really--happen--that you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat turned to her in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Syb, do you mean--you knew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good God!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He let her hand drop and, getting up, walked a little way
      off in the darkness. He felt both hot and icy. What could
      he say to her? What was there to say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Her voice came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, come here. I'm--I'm not--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned abruptly. He seemed to crumple at her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Syb--I'm sorry. I must have been mad--somehow. But it
      won't happen again. I'm--sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held his head in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It did hurt me--Keir. Yes. But then--I had a feeling--Oh,
      my dear--there's no one who loves you as I do. I know I'm
      not clever. I'm such an idiot in some ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her two hands against his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not. You're nothing of the kind. You're clean and
      sweet. Oh, my God, what a damned fool--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tears had ceased. She gave a little exquisite shudder
      and caught her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, come and sit here. Let's hold hands. Oh, did you see
      the lightning?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He slipped into the chair; he edged it close to hers. He
      was in love with her differently, but supremely, and
      between them the sacrament of compassion had been
      consummated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Syb, you don't hate me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's so strange. Hallo--thunder. It's going to pour in a
      minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      She snuggled up against him, her cheek against his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing matters, does it? I was--so miserable, but now--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Syb, you've got something in you that I haven't--or
      hadn't. But it has come. Hallo--that was a big flash! I
      say, dear, what about Jo? She'll--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife started up, and his figure rose with hers as
      though their twoness had become inexorably one.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, Jo! Come."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went in together to watch over Joanna Mary.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson called Keir into the office. Mr. Hoad was there,
      sitting at his desk and jotting down figures on a
      writing-pad. He looked at Keir through the upper halves of
      his pince-nez lenses and smiled, and Keir had never liked
      Mr. Hoad's smile. It suggested a snake poised on the tip of
      its tail, with its body arranged in slimy spirals. Mr. Hoad
      was one of those men who wear a neat grey felt hat with a
      black band set with precision upon his head, as though he
      had it adjusted with a spirit-level. There was nothing
      cocked or gaillard about Hoad. He carried an umbrella
      whenever an umbrella was likely to be necessary. He did not
      stride. He took short, prim steps with legs that were
      encased in rather meagre grey trousers that looked like a
      couple of zinc tubes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir understood that Hoad was a useful supplement to
      Samson. He was a sedulous sitter, a hunter of halfpennies,
      a born bureaucrat, a preparer of estimates and contracts, a
      checker of accounts. While Mr. Samson went out sailing in
      search of business, Mr. Hoad stayed at home in the office
      and presided over the pay-sheets and accounts. He was the
      firm's costing-department, its ready reckoner. He knew to a
      farthing how much a glass door-knob differed from a brass
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson said: "Shut the door, Keir. I've just been
      talking to Mr. Hoad about that idea of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad sat, but Mr. Samson walked up and down as though
      he liked to traverse his subject actively. He would talk
      while going up and down a ladder. He liked to feel life
      moving under him. He was ruddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fact is, I'm not so young as I was, Keir. I'm not so quick
      on my legs or so early up in the morning. Young
      blood--what!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad was smirking over his figures. His thin, suave
      lips were pressed together. He wanted to say in his own
      particular manner: "Precisely--so. But why--why a fellow
      with no capital, and a rather uppish young fellow?" But
      there was a clause in the partnership agreement between
      himself and Mr. Samson that gave Mr. Samson the prerogative
      of behaving like John Bull, and Hoad had always eluded Mr.
      Samson's frontal attacks. Damned old autocrat!
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "A question of getting business--and supervising
      it. I suppose Mr. Smith understands--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir intercepted Mr. Hoad's upward and oblique glance. He
      too understood that Hoad was not Samson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get work and see that it's done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson's ruddy face caught the light from the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it, absolutely. I want a chap with the stuff in him
      and the knowledge. Some mawk of a mutt who'd have every
      man's tongue in his cheek! No, thank you. I want bricks and
      mortar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad nodded and produced a platitude. He kept a number
      of tame platitudes like white mice in a cage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The early bird, sir. Attention to business is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson ignored him. He had never liked Hoad, but the
      fellow was supremely useful, though he suggested the smell
      of mice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Keir--I suggest next January 1st.--You'll come
      in--of course--without bringing any capital into the firm,
      but I count on your bringing in something more important
      than pounds, shillings, and pence. Guts and the knowledge
      of how to look after men. That takes some doing. I'm not
      sure that it's not nine-tenths of the business in these
      days."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad pencilled in a very round O.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The human cipher, Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir was looking towards Mr. Samson. He said: "There's
      nothing to be said, sir, except that I shall be all in on
      the job. I don't think I'm the sort of man to chuck a
      chance away. I'm--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson nodded at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. No need for soft soap. I want a man who will
      deliver the goods. I think you will. Let's go out and have
      a drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson, being John Bull, liked to raise a tankard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Coming, Hoad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad excused himself. He had his figures to finish, and
      he was not the shape of a tankard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have to get this estimate out."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson put out an arm across Keir's shoulder and swept
      him out of the office. There was something in Keir that
      warmed him. Hoad was such a stick of celery, bleached and
      crisp no doubt, but like a cold fish supper on a Sunday in
      December.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, lad, another S to the firm."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave Keir a jocund grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't make my business grow on tap-water. Yes, but I'm
      not saying that a cold-storage fellow isn't useful. Well,
      that's that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, opening the white gate of "Merrow," and wheeling his
      bicycle in between post and gate, surprised his very small
      daughter on the grass. Joanna Mary, emerging from the
      crawling stage, was beginning to stagger on two very fat
      legs. She was supremely solemn over it, and when she
      subsided rather abruptly, which was often, she said "Goo!"
      an exclamation that possessed a philological universality
      and yet was acutely personal. Keir paused at the gate to
      watch those two serious brown legs amble away from him
      towards the beech tree. Joanna had not seen her father, and
      Keir continued to watch her for a few seconds. He had yet
      to learn that a man's attitudes to life are as various as
      his moods. They may be flippant or ironic, serious or
      sentimental. But this product of the eggs and the sperm,
      this brown-legged young entity, his and yet not his--! He
      had not willed Joanna Mary; she had just happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Joanna Mary fell forward upon her tummy, and Sybil
      dashed out from the beech tree, solicitous and sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jo--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Joanna was neither hurt nor discouraged. She clutched
      her mother's frock and helped herself up. She stared hard
      at the grass as though accusing it of rising up and hitting
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir wheeled his bicycle over to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo. She's getting her sea-legs."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his bicycle against the trunk of the tree and,
      squatting down, held out his hands to Joanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come on, young woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna tried a spurt, toppled, and was caught by her
      father. He tossed her up, and she chuckled. He was feeling
      rather full of himself both as man and as father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "News, Syb. Give you three guesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      She guessed it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Samson has asked you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're too quick. I'm to come in on January 1st."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was overjoyed and proud of his success, and Keir had
      yet to learn how very few people are pleased when life
      hands you a laurel wreath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I get a sixth to begin with."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only a sixth!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's pretty generous, my dear. It comes out of the
      old man's share. What do you think the profits were last
      year?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I couldn't say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just over three thousand. That means five hundred for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, we'll be quite rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rather thought so too, and when Joanna had gone to bed,
      and Sybil was washing up the supper things, he walked up
      and down his small grass plot. It was very much an estate,
      and so far as Keir's mood was concerned, it might have
      extended nearly as far as the mountains of the moon.
      Samson, Hoad &amp; Smith! Five hundred a year! His vision
      enlarged itself. It took to itself spacious vistas as he
      patrolled his small garden. He found himself standing
      beside Sybil's row of runner beans. Jack and the Beanstalk!
    </p>
    <p>
      A gramophone struck up next door. He heard Mrs. Challis's
      brassy and cultured voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little drinks--outside, I think."
    </p>
    <p>
      The facetious voice of an oncoming male replied to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, inside, down the pink tube, dear lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was laughter, and Keir, head in air, wondered at such
      wit. Also, he wondered at the illusion of sex. It had
      whipped him to anguish over that woman, and now she was no
      more to him than a highly coloured cushion stuffed with
      flock.

    </p>
    <p>
      Already Sybil was beginning to think of the things that
      could be purchased when Keir became a member of the firm,
      for Sybil--through Keir--was proposing to reconsider her
      social importance. She was not a snob, but she could
      appreciate the value of an enlarged income, and the virtues
      of authority. It presaged more comfort, more security, and
      a new sense of power in the presence of the world's
      shop-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can buy that--if I want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the "can" that was so supremely satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Keir would be able to furnish the spare bedroom. In
      fact, "Merrow" opened its small mouth and offered many
      suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would like a carpet in the passage, please, instead of
      linoleum, and a really nice tea-service. Yes--I'd love a
      rose-bowl in the middle of the table. Yes, and it would be
      awfully jolly if I had a crazy-paving path leading up to my
      front door. Then, there's my kitchen. There are lots of
      things I could do with in the kitchen. You might even buy
      me a refrigerator."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil reproved the small house for making so luxurious a
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's much too expensive. I know the larder does let us
      down sometimes in hot weather, but a refrigerator!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's needs were not to be neglected. He spent so little
      on himself. His wardrobe was very limited, and his stock of
      underclothing was--to say the least--patchy, and instead of
      cheap cotton pyjamas--Then--his bicycle: it was growing
      distinctly decrepit, and a member of the firm of Samson,
      Hoad &amp; Smith could not trundle to Kingham on a rusty
      old machine. Probably in the course of a year or two they
      would be the owners of a small car. Both Keir's new dignity
      and his responsibilities would necessitate a car. He would
      be supervising the firm's various jobs and visiting
      clients--yes, almost like a doctor--and obviously he would
      have to dress to the part. Mr. Keir Smith could not
      represent the firm in a pull-over, shabby grey flannel
      trousers, and a stained soft felt hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some instalments were still owing on Joanna Mary's
      perambulator, and with those payments wiped off, the pram
      would become the property of the Smith family. It would be
      available for subsequent Smiths, and especially so for the
      small son,--Sybil's dream child. Her passion to produce
      another baby, repressed for the moment, now reasserted
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do want a boy, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plenty of time yet, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it will be good for Jo. And if we are going to be
      quite well off--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had to explain to her that the position of a junior
      and unmoneyed partner in a firm was not as simple as it
      seemed. Normally, he might have to wait twelve months
      before his share of the year's trading expressed itself in
      ready cash. He had propounded his problem to Mr. Samson,
      and Mr. Samson had understood it. In his early days he had
      had to solve many such problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Keir. Suppose we arrange for you to draw five
      pounds a week from the firm for the first twelve months? At
      the end of the year you'll draw the balance. Can you manage
      on that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Keir could manage, but he had to explain to Sybil
      that for the next fifteen months or so their income would
      continue to be much as it was. Moreover, when his income as
      a partner became available, its first charge would be the
      repayment of the mortgage on "Merrow." He hoped to wipe off
      the debt in three years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was disappointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can't you leave it a little longer, Keir? It isn't as
      if we were middle-aged. And your prospects--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "I don't like owing money. If anything happened to
      me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was gently sceptical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, anyone would think--! Look at the Browns in that new
      cottage down the lane. They've got three, and he's only a
      clerk in the Council offices."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Brown's affair, not mine. You never get anywhere,
      kid, unless you look ahead. We'll wait till the partnership
      deed is signed and sealed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that a promise, Keir? You see, a second child never
      costs as much as the first."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, well--one's bought things, and one knows more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that may be so to begin with, but kids grow up. And
      if I had a boy, I should want to give him the best chance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you'll be able to, won't you? Some day you will have
      half the business. I don't want to think of Mr. Samson
      going--but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her calm forecasting of the future surprised him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not on the cards yet, thank God. And one isn't
      quite so damned selfish. Besides, I don't know that I shall
      throw up my hat when I'm left alone with Hoad.
      He's--slimy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil defended herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't mean, Keir, that I--I was just thinking of what
      we might expect. One has to think of these things, hasn't
      one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "When you are building a house, Syb, you have to
      get the foundations inspected and passed. Sound sense,
      too."
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Sybil mere ballast and cement might appear as dull
      and obvious substances. Necessary, oh, certainly, but
      wasn't it permissible for one to be a little fanciful? You
      did not buy seeds to keep them shut up in a cardboard box.
      You planted them as prospective flowers.

    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them were young and ardent, and life was full of
      very desirable things and of exciting situations that
      waited to be possessed or experienced. Keir might be
      cautious with the caution of a man who wished to make sure
      that the ground was freehold and properly titled before
      building a house on it, but he was more than a precise and
      careful little fellow. His ambition was held on leash. When
      the chance was actually his, sealed and signed, he would be
      furiously ready to justify it. He would prove to Samson and
      he would prove to Hoad, and especially to Hoad, that he was
      the man of destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had ideas, but he did not blurt them out in public. He
      understood that Mr. Samson had had ideas, and that though
      those ideas might be a little out of date, they had served
      Mr. Samson's generation. He had no intention of appearing
      before Mr. Samson as the insurgent and patronizing prig.
      "Yes, that was all right in your day, but people are
      different and houses are different." Mr. Samson was still
      very limber on his feet and would cut across and through
      the traffic of Kingham High Street like a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the firm's imagination needed quickening, the change
      would have to be gradual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had imagination. He saw the new world still hungry for
      houses, and in spite of much sententious prosing about the
      new world's standardization he had a feeling that the new
      world craved contrasts. Being so crowded, its urge was to
      elbow its way out into some little corner of difference,
      were that corner ever so small. It might rush out into the
      country rather like cattle who had been stalled all through
      the winter, and it might disfigure the country in its
      desire to possess it. It did not mean to disfigure it. It
      was not yet sufficiently wise as to the aloofness and the
      otherness of beauty. It might be under the impression that
      it could descend upon beauty and possess it as it descended
      upon Brooklands or Hendon, but Keir did believe that the
      urge towards beauty was there. Bluebells and sweet turf had
      to be martyred in order that lovely and silent things might
      yet teach modern man that life is not all waste-paper and
      tar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking about him at Kingham, he saw the rows of dreadful
      yellow brick cottages built by the late Victorians, and the
      "retained" red brick villas of the Edwardians. Little
      gables, little turrets, pretentious bow windows, much white
      paint! Certainly some of the new-age building had the
      flatness and the flimsiness of cardboard, but, on the other
      hand, much of it was individual and imaginative. There were
      one or two houses in the Abbey Lands estate that caused
      Keir qualms of delight. He believed that imagination could
      express itself in a cottage as satisfyingly as in a villa.
      It was a question of proportion, of beauty of line, of the
      right texture and colour in your materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      People--or some of them--wanted individual houses. The
      builder's business was to put up a little house or cottage
      that made people stand and stare and become creatures of
      desire. A house should be like a comely face, instantly
      alluring and attractive. And if possible, it should not be
      crowded up with other faces like a photo of the local
      "Bowling Club" or of the "Kingham Amateur Dramatic
      Association."
    </p>
    <p>
      During the early part of the winter he spent many of his
      evenings in experimenting in cottage and house designs. He
      bought a box of chalks and coloured his rough sketches,
      using blurred browns and soft greens and creams. He showed
      some of these sketches to Mr. Samson, but he did not
      produce them to Mr. Hoad. Hoad was all for utility and the
      obvious, and quick returns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson, having colour in himself, could appreciate
      colour objectively, but he retained the impression that
      beauty cost more money.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Prices are cut pretty close, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir knew that, but he was convinced that beauty need cost
      no more or very little more than ugliness. You threw in the
      imagination and the taste and mixed them with the
      materials. Besides, he believed that there were people who
      would be ready to pay a few pounds more for a house that
      was a little unlike the house next door.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you ever noticed the names people give their
      cottages--yes, even the ones in a row?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson had noticed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Rosary--'Skiddaw'--'Two Oaks.' That sort of thing,
      Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, isn't that--significant? The houses may be as like
      as two petrol tins, but the people want to be different."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or snobbish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think there is more in it than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Samson nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, there may be something in it. Private information,
      my lad,--but I hear there's some land coming on the market.
      I have one or two friends who are interested. We might
      develop a small estate of our own. I'm not dead yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir put his plans away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say not, sir. I hope there will be a good many
      years more of your liveness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'm feeling that way myself, Keir," and he chuckled.

    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was beginning to think about her Christmas shopping,
      for the seasons of the year and their festivals were of
      serious and happy account to her, and "Merrow" had to eat
      hot cross buns on Good Friday, and surprise Joanna Mary
      with an Easter egg. Sybil bought holly; it was brilliantly
      berried that year; and the electric globe in the
      sitting-room had a sprig of mistletoe attached to it.
      Already Sybil was attempting to initiate Joanna into the
      mysteries of Christmas; she proposed that Joanna should
      hang out a very small sock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do believe that children should be a little fanciful,
      Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fairies--and all that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. You can't prove to me that there aren't
      fairies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to disprove your fairies, kid. So far as I'm
      concerned, Mr. Samson's just like Father Christmas."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So he is, all white and red. He's a dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened upon Christmas Eve. Keir and a couple of
      carpenters were working late in the shop, finishing off a
      pair of gates for a house on Kingham Hill. Keir had
      promised to be back at "Merrow" at six to take Sybil out
      shopping. Her Christmas present had yet to be bought, and
      the shops were keeping open late.
    </p>
    <p>
      He and one of the other men were turning out a couple of
      gates on the big bench in the middle of the shop when the
      door opened and a head appeared. It belonged to the firm's
      lorry-driver, who had brought his lorry back into the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heard the news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. What's that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The boss has been killed. Run over by a bus in the High
      Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir experienced one of those moments of mental numbness.
      He stood leaning against the bench and staring at that face
      in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lorry-driver was very full of the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I came along with my old bus just after it happened. You
      know how the old man always fancied himself on being fly on
      his feet. He cut round a tram and the bus caught him. A
      wheel went over his head."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir felt sick. He had a sudden vivid glimpse of that
      jocund white head and ruddy face. Just pulp! He heard the
      lorry-driver revelling in detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reg'lar ---- squelch."
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly Keir blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut up. Haven't you any decent feeling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What the ---- the matter with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir gave a toss of the head as though shaking some horror
      of blood out of his eyes. He turned and went to the corner
      of the shed where his coat was hanging, and put it on. He
      was aware of the silence, conscious of being watched by
      those other men. He was trembling. The nausea of the thing
      was still on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lorry-driver stood with slouched shoulders, his hands
      stuffed into his overcoat pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They took him to the borough mortuary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir moved towards the door, and as he did so, the
      lorry-driver ceased to be the newsmonger and became man. He
      stepped in front of Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shouldn't if I were you, mate. He ain't exactly--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir looked the man straight in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all right, Jack. I know what I'm doing."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked round the man and out into the dark yard where
      the black bulk of the lorry showed against the lighted
      office window. Hoad would be in there. Had Hoad heard? And
      suddenly to Keir the damp and muggy night was Hoad. A
      greasy road, tramlines, the wheels of a bus, Hoad's little
      smeary smile; God, was one so filthily personal as all
      that! His right hand made a queer movement as of pushing
      something away. He found his bike under the iron-roofed
      shelter by the gate, and he wheeled it out, but he did not
      attempt to mount it. He walked along the edge of the
      pavement, pushing the machine along the gutter. He became
      aware of a glare of light and of movement, Kingham High
      Street on Christmas Eve. Glare, movement, colour, women,
      hordes of women. Kingham High Street was one huge
      shop-window. It was packed with traffic. Turkeys in a
      fishmonger's shop, rows and rows of dead turkeys. An old
      fellow dressed as Father Christmas was carrying a Christmas
      tree along the pavement and advertising somebody's Yuletide
      Bazaar. Women and girls and children. A small group of
      dirty and excited children charged past him, and one of
      them bumped against his leg. Somewhere here old Ruddy Face
      had had his white head--Good God! Just an incidental mess,
      with Kingham High Street full of its glare and its crowded
      preoccupations. A paragraph in the papers. Tragic death of
      a well-known Kingham resident.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tragic death--indeed!
    </p>
    <p>
      For, suddenly, the tragedy of the thing as it affected him,
      Keir Hardie Smith, became overwhelmingly obvious. In seven
      days' time that partnership deed would have been signed.
      Samson, Hoad &amp; Smith. And Hoad was now the god upon
      whose knees--
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you swine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      For the moment the reaction of his rage was self-accusing.
      Was everything in this world--self? And this damned street
      with its glare and its noise and its crowds? People
      jostling each other to get on trams and buses, people
      herding in front of shop-windows! Red meat in the butchers'
      shops, a white head pulped and bloody!
    </p>
    <p>
      He slung his bicycle round a curve of the pavement and
      escaped into a side street. He remembered that he had
      promised Sybil that he would be home at six to take her
      shopping. Sybil's Christmas present! He took to the gutter
      and walked along it with his head down, wheeling his
      machine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked all the way to the Abbey Lands estate, and when
      he reached the white gate of "Merrow," he saw that
      "Merrow's" front door was open. He was late, and Sybil had
      Joanna Mary and the pram ready in the passage and was
      waiting for him, for Joanna Mary could not be left at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was feeling calmer after that solitary walk. It had even
      occurred to him that Mr. Hoad was a somewhat helpless
      person out of the office, and that as a supervisor of work
      and of men he--Keir--might be as necessary to Hoad as Hoad
      was to him. Why should he spoil Sybil's Christmas? He need
      not tell her. He decided not to tell her until after
      Christmas. Yes, and she should have her present.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wheeled his bicycle up the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, Syb. I was kept in the shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      In his own ears his voice sounded cheerfully casual.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shan't be a minute."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his bicycle away in the shed and, returning to the
      front door, found Sybil bending over Joanna Mary and the
      pram, and Keir was penetrated by a pang of sudden
      compassion. These two simple creatures, the woman and the
      child, were dependent upon him. He was aware of his wife's
      slightly flushed and excited face. It was one of her happy
      and care-free occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All ready, Keir. I'm going to leave Jo with the Browns for
      an hour or so. Mrs. Brown said I might."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir bent down and gently tweaked his daughter's nose.
      "Who's Father Christmas? Just you tell me that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna chuckled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Da-da."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a truly wonderful child.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Joanna Mary and pram were being inserted into the
      Browns' narrow hall, Sybil happened to glance at her
      husband's face. She surprised Keir at a moment when he was
      not conscious of being looked at, and Keir's face was the
      face of a man who was very tired. It was curiously shadowy
      and lined, and Sybil's festive occasion was clouded by a
      transient shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were out in the dark lane and walking towards the
      lights of Kingham. She had slipped a hand under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tired, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He rallied himself. Had his cheerfulness appeared too much
      like painted canvas?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a bit. Had a long day. Do me good to have a little
      beano."
    </p>
    <p>
      In Kingham High Street he shepherded Sybil towards a
      particular window. He happened to be wise as to the desire
      in the heart of his wife. Besides, she did need that winter
      coat. The one she was wearing was cheap and rather shabby.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coat he bought her had a fur collar and cuffs, and
      though the fur was cony, it reproduced the mode of the
      moment. He stood and watched Sybil put the coat on and look
      at herself in a mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, it's lovely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It suits you, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      The fur at her throat made her face look douce and
      desirable. She was woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I'll wear the coat. Could you have the old one
      sent home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil's eyes seemed to fill with secret and surprised
      laughter. The saleswoman had called her "madam." But then
      her husband was--to all intents and purposes--a partner in
      the firm of Samson, Hoad &amp; Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the street she hugged Keir's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are good to me. It's a lovely coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Twenty yards down the street they came upon a news-vendor
      selling a late edition of a local paper. The man carried a
      placard, and on it was printed: "Local tragedy. Well-known
      Kingham resident killed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went suddenly white in the presence of that
      news-sheet. He was aware of Sybil asking him a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder who it is, Keir. Do you know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lied to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Buy a paper."
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew her past the placard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need to bother about that rag on a night like this."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir spent Christmas wondering whether his life's
      opportunity had died with Mr. Samson, and in waiting for
      some gesture from Mr. Hoad. Surely, the surviving partner
      would communicate with the potential partner at such a
      crisis in the firm's career? But when the silence
      continued, Keir began to question it. What was its
      significance? Did it mean that all was well?
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt both restless and inert. There was a pride in him
      that refused to approach Mr. Hoad either emotionally or
      with a view to appraising the situation. Hoad was not the
      kind of a person to whom you betrayed emotion; he was
      rather like a batrachian sitting in some dim, dark world of
      his own and waiting for a fly to settle. He would dart out
      a tongue and suck in the fly or a figure. He was not a man
      whom you approached soulfully when your spirit was in
      travail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir felt paralysed and yet painfully sensitive to the
      things and the people about him. The familiar face of his
      world had become strange. Even "Merrow" seemed suspicious
      and unfriendly, a little house that mistrusted its
      foundations. It asked him awkward questions. "What about
      me? What about my mortgage? Half a year's interest is due
      on December 31st. Oh, you have the money put by. But what
      will Mr. Samson's executors want to do about me?" Why
      couldn't the wretched little house enjoy its Christmas and
      leave law and finance till tomorrow?
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, Sybil was so full of her Christmas, her
      mistletoe, and her holly. They dined in state at one
      o'clock, almost as a partner in the firm of Samson &amp;
      Hoad might be expected to dine. Joanna Mary occupied her
      high chair, into which she could be bolted with a wooden
      rail. They ate roast beef and Christmas pudding. There were
      oranges, almonds and raisins, and crackers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna had to pull crackers with Daddy, her mother
      assisting. She blinked when the thing went bang, and then
      gurgled with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil crowned Joanna Mary with a purple cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Da-da, da-da."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She wants you to have a cap, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all put on caps, and Keir's was a fool's cap. <i>Absit
      omen!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil hunted for mottoes. It was part of the ritual and she
      loved it. She passed one to Keir. He read it, but to
      himself:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Your eyes are like the twinkling stars,<br>
      My love lies bleeding behind bars."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A voice in him exclaimed: "What--balderdash!" He was trying
      not to feel that the little domestic festival was a
      pathetic farce. He pulled another cracker with Joanna Mary
      and extracted the motto and read it as though it might
      contain words of esoteric meaning:
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "The rose is red, the sky is blue, I'm feeling sad because
      of you."
    </blockquote>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He crumpled up the slip of paper and flicked it into the
      fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Christmas dinner remained with him oppressively,
      suspended within him like his thoughts. He went out
      dutifully for a walk with Sybil and Joanna Mary and
      Joanna's pram. They walked to the river and along the
      towing-path, and everything looked grey to Keir. He was
      moody without meaning to be moody. Should he go and see
      Hoad and get it over? It was no use telling his wife about
      the tragedy until he knew how it was going to affect them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not go to see Mr. Hoad, but he became filled with a
      sudden tenderness towards Sybil. Mere self-pity translated
      itself into compassion. He was responsible for these two
      creatures, and Sybil was still so flushed with her
      Christmas. She took simple things to heart. He helped her
      to put Joanna Mary to bed, and afterwards they sat together
      in front of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's been a lovely day, Keir, hasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She wanted to have her hand held, and he held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wasn't she funny with the crackers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, she blinked a bit, didn't she?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you notice my new coat?"
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact he had not noticed it, though he had
      been the donor, but he lied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just suits you, that fur collar."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil rather thought so, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not know what to do with himself next day, for his
      suspense was like a meal that had refused to be digested.
      At eleven o'clock he got out his bicycle and rode to Samson
      &amp; Hoad's. It was possible that Hoad had reacted to the
      stress of circumstances and was putting Boxing Day to other
      uses. He might be in the office, but Keir found the yard
      gates shut and locked. A closed crisis still confronted
      him, and he remounted his bicycle and rode home.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, after Joanna Mary had been put to bed, he
      told Sybil of Mr. Samson's death. At the moment she was
      rummaging in a drawer for some wool with which to darn a
      pair of his socks, and suddenly comprehending the
      bitterness of the mischance, she stood looking ruthfully at
      her husband. He was sitting in front of the fire and
      leaning towards it with a significant stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, was it the news on the placard?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then--you knew?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it wasn't exactly the sort of Christmas present--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      She made a quick movement towards him and sat down on the
      arm of his chair. She seemed to understand that he did not
      want to be touched. He was feeling brittle and restive. Her
      face had an extraordinary gentleness. She just let her hand
      rest upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, you ought to have told me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was the use of spoiling--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, oh, Keir, your troubles are mine, aren't they? I
      shouldn't have let you buy that coat."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's all right, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor Mr. Samson. He was such a kind man. So different
      from--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, rather different from the other fellow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen Mr. Hoad yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I wasn't going to rush at the fellow and let him see
      that it mattered too much."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Keir, he'll want you all the more now, won't he? He
      won't be able to supervise all the outside work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may want me, kid, but he's the sort of man who'll just
      try to use me. I shall find that out tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A young clerk who had been engaged by the firm less than a
      month ago put his head into the carpenter's shop and
      addressed Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Smith, the gov'nor wants you in the office."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir left the bench, took off his apron, and put on his
      coat. If the crisis was upon him, he would go to it,
      properly dressed, though young Collar &amp; Cuffs had not
      presented him with any prefix. He crossed the yard, where
      men were loading bricks into a lorry and, entering the
      office, found Mr. Hoad at his desk. There was an official
      sombreness about Mr. Hoad. He had put on a black tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in. Shut the door, Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not ask Keir to sit down. It was his intention to
      define and circumscribe the situation. His pince-nez seemed
      to have slipped slightly down his nose, and his glance was
      upward and oblique.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Terrible business this. Shocking. A sign of the times. Mr.
      Samson, if I may say so, was the kind of man--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir stood still, and Mr. Hoad's fingers fidgeted about the
      desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a most serious blow to the business."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and Keir felt that Mr. Hoad was waiting
      for him like a black cat, while he was waiting for Mr.
      Hoad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can quite understand that. Mr. Samson was the business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad's eyes blinked. He did not appreciate the tone of
      the remark, but it gave him his opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Precisely. I thought it only fair, Smith, to let you know
      at once that under the circumstances I do not feel
      justified in assuming--any of the commitments that our
      revered chief--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was conscious of a flash of inward scorn. Revered
      chief indeed! Why couldn't the slimy fellow say exactly
      what was in his mind, instead of sitting there like a black
      cat denying the other creature a dish of cream?
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was abrupt. Hoad should not know how hope trembled in
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--about the partnership?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad's smile was surreptitious and cajoling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. Under the circumstances and placed as I am--I may
      find myself short of capital. Mr. Samson's executors may
      wish to realize his interest. My
      responsibilities--heavy--rather problematical. Of course,
      it must be plain to you that had you been in a position to
      introduce--"
    </p>
    <p>
      To Keir, Mr. Hoad's voice was like a melancholy and
      disturbing little draught blowing under a door. He
      understood, oh, yes, he understood. Mr. Hoad had him. He
      could produce no capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you wouldn't get any money with me," and he could
      have added, "but you might get something more with me," but
      he didn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad waved deprecating hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't put it quite so crudely as that. I want you to
      recognize my difficulties. I am responsible for the
      business--now. I may have to go to the bank for a loan. You
      see, I am being quite frank with you. I'm sorry, but any
      idea of a partnership must be postponed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Postponement was an admirable word. Keir moistened his lips
      and swallowed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Postponed. I see. Then, you may reconsider the
      idea--later?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Hoad's smile oozed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly. It will depend--of course--on the firm's
      position financially. If, in a year or two--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was very sure that he was being fobbed off with a
      shadowy supposition, but even the shadow was precious to
      him. And he was helpless, so damnably helpless. The black
      cat possessed both the milk and the saucer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Meanwhile, you wish me--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad's little mean face expressed relief. It became
      almost bright and cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, of course, Keir, of course. I want you to carry on as
      foreman. I shall want you to overlook some of the outside
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. The same pay?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just at present I must ask you to meet me--in that way. I
      shall have an anxious year or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Inwardly he felt bitter, but the man in him would not
      flinch before Hoad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, I'll do my best for the firm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sure you will, Keir. I have every confidence in you.
      Of course--all this is between ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the nature of things he had often addressed Mr. Samson
      as "sir," but it would never occur to him to accord the
      "sir" to Hoad, and the little slimy snob in Hoad was half
      expecting it. He was ready to appreciate the tribute,
      especially from the lips of Keir. It might help to appease
      his dislike of Keir and of what he would have described as
      the shock-headed cockiness of Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all, Smith, I think. We have to attend to
      business--in spite of this most shocking--event. I should
      like you to go along and see how they are getting on at
      that new house in River Lane. Yes, at once, please. I have
      so much to occupy me here for the moment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went, and felt himself walking towards some inevitable
      edge, and on the faces of the other men he discovered that
      morning suggestions of ironic curiosity. They knew; they
      were somehow wise as to the secrets of the firm's official
      life. Mr. Keir Hardie Smith had had his conceit chastened,
      and they were pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Work had piled up during the Christmas holiday, and as was
      often the case human nature was apt to be slack after two
      or three days of relaxation. Keir, as supervisor for the
      day, had several jobs to overlook in different parts of
      Kingham, and one particular piece of work caused him to use
      strong language.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a nice bit of botching. Knock off and get back to
      the shop. I'll come and do the job myself tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the day he was both late and tired, for
      frustration may have a negative effect upon a man. Trifles
      had irritated him, trifles that normally would have been
      shed like shavings from a plane. He had a second interview
      with Mr. Hoad, but it dealt solely with the day's work,
      progress, material that was needed. It was half past six
      when he mounted his bicycle and rode home to "Merrow." The
      evening was dim and stagnant, and he was conscious of the
      slackness of the muggy December night. There were no stars,
      no glitter, no keen edge to things. To Keir all was blurred
      and moist and melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dismounted at the little white gate. He stood there a
      moment holding his bicycle by the handles. He could see a
      vertical streak of light between the curtains of the
      living-room, and he was moved to sudden emotion. His throat
      contracted; his bowels yearned. He was just man poignantly
      conscious of those simple realities that are like the bread
      and wine of a sacrament. If he uttered no words to himself,
      it was because these human essentials had existed before
      words. Wife, child, home. It was as though he had
      rediscovered them, or had discovered them as emotional
      symbols for the first time in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mystic human trinity in unity! Almost he could understand
      the feeling of woman for that which is flesh of her flesh.
      The little, hard, circumscribed ego that was Keir seemed to
      melt and to encompass those other two in a living flux of
      love and compassion. The three of them were one, and as he
      walked up the path towards that slit of light, he saw it as
      a rift in his own loneliness. He had been cast down and
      disappointed, but behind those curtains light and warmth
      and comradeship waited for him. He was glad of Sybil. He
      found himself yearning towards his mate. She was both poor
      Sybil and a creature of infinite wealth and potency. He
      wanted to be with her, near her, to feel consoled and
      strengthened by the gentle reality of Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his bicycle away in the small shed and went in. His
      voice had a poignant cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sorry, I'm afraid I'm late."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of his wife standing by the table and looking
      across at him. She seemed to flinch just for one moment,
      and then with a peculiar wise radiance she came and kissed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tea's ready, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pressure of his lips on hers revealed to her many
      things, that hope had been dashed and that with it he had
      become more hers. He kissed her as the sharer in all that
      was his, and her heart felt big.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're tired, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a bit. Had a long day."
    </p>
    <p>
      His arm remained round her as though he realized the dear
      reality of her, his need of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, never mind. It will come again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've guessed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew--directly you looked at me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's rather wonderful of you, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it? Not when things matter. Don't you understand that?
      There's a kind of quickness in one.--The kettle's boiling."
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved away from him to the fireplace. His eyes followed
      her, and then he sat down at the table that was laid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jo in bed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as well. Yes, I've had one straight in the face, Syb,
      but there are compensations. If it hurt a bit--there are
      other things. Rather funny to miss your chance just by
      seven days."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was filling the tea-pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So Mr. Hoad--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just Hoad. I had more than a feeling that he would
      keep me out. Of course, there are things to be said on his
      side. The chap hasn't the stuff in him the old boy had.
      He's frightened and careful and slippery."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized the loaf and cut it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He wants me to carry on--of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil sat down behind her tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he'll find out, Keir. He'll find out that he can't get
      on without you, especially now that he's alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir gave a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps, perhaps not. I have an idea that he's the sort of
      man who will use me, but keep me off the ladder. Well,
      anyway, kid, I've got a good balance on the credit side,
      yes--you."
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Samson's estate devolved upon two sisters, and the
      greater part of it was immobilized in the firm of Samson
      &amp; Hoad. The capital value of the business interest
      might be regarded as influenced by goodwill, and Mr. Hoad
      came to an arrangement with Mr. Samson's executors.
      Meanwhile, the executors, faced with death duty and looking
      round for ready cash, decided to realize certain of Mr.
      Samson's investments and to call in his mortgages, Keir's
      among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir interviewed one of these gentlemen and put his case
      before him. If they pressed him for the money, they would
      have to take "Merrow" and dehouse him. Keir was very much
      worried. The executor was sympathetic. He was sorry, but to
      clear the estate they needed cash. He advised Keir to
      arrange for the transference of the mortgage. In all
      probability one of the many building societies would do his
      business for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir interviewed a local agent who acted for "The Rainbow
      Building Society." It was a big concern and advertised
      itself extensively by putting to the public the question
      "Why Pay Rent?" The society accepted "Merrow," and the
      transfer and repayment to Mr. Samson's executors were
      arranged; but Keir found that he would have to pay the
      building society six and a half per cent, thirty-two pounds
      ten a year, and to Keir a five-pound note was more than
      petty cash.
    </p>
    <p>
      But base metal tempered the other metal in him. If he was
      to act as the official supervisor of Mr. Hoad's contracts,
      he would miss no chance of performing the work efficiently.
      He continued to hope that the gentleman with the pince-nez
      would be brought to appreciate the commercial value of Keir
      Hardie Smith. He made allowances for Hoad. The man had the
      whole business on his shoulders. He had to account to Mr.
      Samson's executors. If he proposed to possess the business,
      he would have to accumulate the capital needed to buy out
      Mr. Samson's sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Keir put it to Sybil: "The thing is to realize that the
      other fellow has his worries, just as you have. I'm going
      to wire in and show him that I'm up to the job. One can't
      do more than that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir did his work thoroughly and with an efficiency and
      vigilance that a go-easy world might have described as
      ruthless. He did it honestly in the sense that he strove to
      make sure that the men he supervised gave an honest return
      for the wages they received. His world did not describe him
      as ruthless. It referred to him in private as a ---- little
      boss, or Hoad's spy, or as a ---- ----. It did not like the
      way in which Keir turned up at eight o'clock and marred the
      peace of that getting-ready-to-begin period, the casual
      gossip, the early pipe. He was here, there, everywhere. You
      never knew when to expect him. He appeared to cultivate the
      art of the unexpected. A bricklayer's labourer was heard to
      remark that: "The chap buzzes round you like a ----
      mosquito."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one to warn Keir that he was in conflict with
      the plain man's natural inertia, or that he was challenging
      a mass prejudice. He should have been wise as to it, and
      possibly he was wise, but that which was Keir was Keir. He
      could be intense, the inevitable individualist, perhaps too
      much the egoist. He had the essential fire; he was a little
      Prometheus, whom the great god Demos would wish to see
      chained to the rock. He was quicker in thought and movement
      than the average man. He set too hot a pace.
    </p>
    <p>
      That a sulky atmosphere surrounded him was evident, but
      Keir was rather too ready to regard it as mere winter fog.
      The fellows would get used to him and to his authority, and
      they would be obliged to accept his keenness. Had not Mr.
      Samson warned him that when success comes to a man and
      compels him to exercise a little authority over men who
      regarded him as an equal, he is apt to be grossly
      unpopular? But there were easy virtues that he lacked. He
      was too serious and aloof in the presence of his little
      world's resentment, carrying himself too much like the
      proverbial schoolmaster. Old Samson had been more of a
      sea-captain, vigorous in voice and language, but full of
      Bills and Freds and a kind of jocund heartiness that had
      made him appear as a man among men. Keir was too damned
      superior.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning he found a Mr. Sparks in the yard talking to a
      couple of men who had come in with a lorry. Mr. Sparks was
      a person who had not been seen about the premises in the
      days of Mr. Samson. He was a trades-union official, a
      fellow with light blue eyes, a little black moustache, and
      a prominent and shiny chin. He commanded language,
      especially so on a platform. He could be suave and he could
      be truculent. When in conversation with an employer of
      labour, he would stand with his hands in his trousers
      pockets, his head thrown back, his face exuding a shimmer
      of self-confident cleverness. "Yes, I'm up to all your
      tricks."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Keir passed by, he nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, Mr. Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      The salutation was ironical, and Keir understood its
      significance. He paused in the doorway of the carpenter's
      shop and turned to look back. He saw Mr. Teddy Sparks
      walking in the direction of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half an hour later Keir and Mr. Sparks met again in the
      yard. Keir had been attending to the loading of a lorry and
      making sure that certain material had been included in the
      load, when Mr. Sparks emerged from the office. The lorry
      had cleared the gates, and Keir and the official had the
      yard to themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sparks was in a blithe mood, and feeling facetious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Napoleon!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His polished and prominent chin and light blue eyes
      prompted Keir to throw back the challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, what about you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The other man laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one of my household gods. Do you keep a bust of the
      Emperor on your mantelpiece? My job, old lad, is to see
      that such busts are busted."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's irony was ocular rather than vocal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sparks walked past him, turned, and showed his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you want the straight tip from me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't bet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're smart, aren't you! But you're too dashed smart
      on the wrong side of the fence. It's a pity. You and I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He became abruptly confidential and ingratiating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, old lad, you ought to be one of us. I know a
      thing or two. I know a thing or two about this firm."
    </p>
    <p>
      He inclined his head towards the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where do you think you belong? To the boss in there, or to
      the chaps who do the job? Where's your loyalty lie? I could
      tell you a thing or two."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir looked at Mr. Sparks's chin as though it fascinated
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing I said that I belong to myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sparks gave a toss of the head, a trick that he found
      dramatic and useful when addressing an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've said it. Absolutely! Good old Manchester school.
      Every man for himself, and devil take the hindmost. If
      that's your creed--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, Sparks, my job is to see that men do the job.
      Your business is to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so quick, old lad. My business is to see that every
      chap has a job, and that he's not jobbed over or off it.
      That's just the difference. You're not thinking of the men;
      you're thinking of yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir could not deny himself the obvious retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you? Completely disinterested, always and everywhere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sparks gave another toss of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can cut that out. I'm class-conscious--anyway. I don't
      rat on my own people. Well, you wait and see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir let the incident pass. A man like Sparks had his own
      particular preoccupations; he was obliged to light a fire
      under the pot and make it boil occasionally. And if the men
      were somewhat sulky, Mr. Hoad was suave. He was very polite
      to Keir during those first six months, and his suavity even
      tempered Keir's severity. Keir had been watching two or
      three men until he had convinced himself either of their
      incapacity or of their dishonesty in the matter of output,
      and when he had made up his mind about them, he spoke to
      Hoad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are one or two chaps who ought to be stood off.
      Slow-motion artists. I have been watching them for weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't like sacking men, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I quite understand, but it's part of my business to keep
      you wise."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad equivocated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I appreciate that. Why not give them a broad hint? I don't
      want any bad feeling in the business."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Keir was going out of the office, his employer called
      him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, just a moment. You set a pretty high standard. I'm
      not quarrelling with that, but one has to remember in these
      days that labour is always looking for trouble. I'm rather
      a believer--in conciliation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir understood. Hoad was not Samson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. But if a man's bluffing and he thinks you are
      afraid to call his bluff, I don't believe--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad fidgeted in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes, one has to be firm of course. What I mean is,
      Keir, that, human nature being what it is, one has to
      indulge in a little winking. I quite understand that--your
      position--Yes, I appreciate your--loyalty. But a little of
      the velvet glove, Keir, the velvet glove."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir might feel a little contemptuous towards Mr. Hoad and
      regret the jocund candour of Mr. Samson, but he could and
      did accuse himself of being prejudiced in his own favour.
      His integrity and his thoroughness were not disinterested
      virtues. He knew that his very efficiency was inspired by
      an ulterior motive. He had to convince that rather
      gelatinous creature Mr. Hoad that he--Keir--was solid and
      substantial and still the potential and perhaps the
      inevitable partner. It irked him, and there were moments
      when he felt himself posing before a man whom he both
      disliked and despised.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damned sycophant."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never accused himself of truckling to old Samson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, he had some understanding of the men's attitude
      of passive resistance. They gave themselves, and all that
      they could deny their employer was a portion of themselves.
      They subscribed to that futile supposition that by limiting
      effort they enlarged the potential opportunity. If you did
      less work, there would be more work for you and for others.
      He resented their stupidity--as he saw it--even as they
      resented his strenuousness. He would have said that men
      like Sparks truckled to the indifferent man, and both
      flattered and exploited him. Sparks offered to spread a
      vast feather-bed and to invite the whole world to recline
      on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir talked more to his wife. He discovered that Sybil was
      wiser than he had imagined her to be, and the comradeship
      between them deepened and enlarged itself. He was surprised
      to find her more than ready to justify his activities.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "A lot of it's just jealousy, Keir. Most of them
      would be much rougher than you are--if they were in your
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentle solidity of Sybil could be less gentle than it
      seemed. In a crisis her instincts might dominate her
      sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All men want as much as they can get. It's natural, isn't
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet during all those months Keir was conscious of keeping
      one corner of an eye upon that narrow face and figure in
      the office. Hoad, with his pince-nez and his finicking
      fussiness, was Keir's little man of destiny. He may have
      hated his employer even as some of the men were tempted to
      hate Keir, for the secret self-regard, the inward strutting
      pride, of man is so easily offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir felt himself to be Hoad's superior, and Hoad sat in
      the seat of authority.

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, when the firm of Samson &amp; Hoad became Samson, Hoad
      &amp; Gott, Keir was utterly unprepared for the change.
      Hoad's very suavity was by its nature surreptitious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even some of the employees knew of the event before the
      rumour of it reached Keir. In fact the news came to him
      casually across the counter of a shop. He had stopped on
      his way home to buy a couple of ounces of tobacco.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear young Gott is going into your firm."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's change was lying on the counter, five pennies and a
      halfpenny, and for the moment he forgot it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that? Who told you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, gossip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, young Gott. You know Gott's in High Street."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The caterers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it. Old Gott must have done pretty well. I suppose
      he's buying his son a share in the business."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was walking out of the shop, leaving his change on the
      counter, and the tobacconist called after him: "Mr. Smith,
      your change." Keir came back with a little self-conscious
      smile and collected the coppers. He did not attempt to
      explain his absent-mindedness, but he did wonder whether
      the man behind the counter suspected that this piece of
      news had been like a blow low on the body. Almost it had
      had the same effect as such a blow. It had knocked the wind
      out of Keir and made him feel faintly sick and unsteady.
      His stomach had dropped. He was conscious of a horrid sense
      of deflation as though some strand within him had snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Gott! He had never seen the man. Till a moment ago he
      had not known of young Gott's existence. The chap's father
      had built up the leading confectionery and catering
      business in Kingham. There was a Gott's Restaurant in High
      Street. Keir could conclude that Gott senior was a man of
      means, and that Gott junior, somehow preferring bricks and
      mortar to cake, was being presented with his opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hoad had said nothing, and though Hoad was under no
      obligation, Keir felt bitter, bitter and mortified. He had
      no claim upon Hoad other than his effort to safeguard Mr.
      Hoad's business, and the fact that but for old Samson's
      death he would have been Hoad's partner. But the fellow
      might have told him, instead of letting the news reach him
      through the back door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cycled home to "Merrow," and the "Merrow" lane was now
      dressed on either side with bungalows of all shapes and
      sizes. The community had spilled over into Keir's quiet
      corner, and sometimes he wondered what would happen to all
      these clerks and rentiers if the pound note became
      waste-paper and other countries refused to supply England
      with free food. But that was hypothetical, and Keir was in
      contact with reality. He was not aware of the gentleness of
      the June evening, or of the sun-splashed trees trailing
      long shadows. There was no beauty in the day for him. The
      face of June might have been the face of a harlot, sinister
      and suborning under the light of some street lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Sybil in the garden, tying up a row of Canterbury
      bells. She was standing in the border with a length of bass
      between her lips. Joanna Mary, who had been presented with
      a minute portion of the earth's surface as a safeguard
      against haphazard and far-flung activities, was busy with a
      tin bucket and a wooden spade. She was proving herself a
      very teachable child. She understood that when her mother
      said: "Jo mustn't hurt poor flowers," her mother was
      somehow a flower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna was squatting and patting a small mound of earth
      with a spade when her father pushed his bicycle through the
      gate. She stood erect, and on her knees showed two patches
      of garden soil. She bumped up and down on her fat legs and
      waved a spade.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dada--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dropping her spade, she rushed at him, for she knew that if
      she could waylay her father at the gate, he would sit her
      on the saddle of his bicycle and, with an arm round her,
      wheel her as far as the shed. Keir might be in a black
      mood, but the edge of it did not reach as far as the face
      of his small daughter. If he had eaten sour grapes, Joanna
      Mary's very new teeth were not set on edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, where's the money for the bus ride?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna chuckled and embraced his leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got penny in purse."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, have you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her up, and Sybil, bending over the flowers,
      turned a head to smile at them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a letter for you, Keir. I left it on the
      window-sill."
    </p>
    <p>
      Having humoured Joanna Mary and put his machine away, he
      went into the house to get his letter. Joanna followed him
      and stood solemnly waiting upon his pleasure. He found the
      letter, an oblong business envelope addressed by hand with
      a penny-halfpenny stamp in the right upper corner. He
      recognized the handwriting. It was Hoad's.
    </p>
    <p>
      He opened the letter and read, and as he skimmed the words,
      he thought: "Yes, Hoad's just the sort of chap who does a
      dirty job on paper." He was conscious of harsh anger, a
      bristling, cold resentment, and Joanna Mary, staring up
      into her father's face, wondered why it looked so funny.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "MY DEAR SMITH,<br>
      <br>
      "I think it right that you should know that the
      exigencies"--what a Hoad word!--"of the business have
      obliged me to introduce a partner with capital. Mr. Edward
      Gott is joining the firm. I am sorry that circumstances
      should have compelled me to disappoint you in the matter,
      but I do opine that you will understand my position.<br>
      <br>
      "I shall be glad to see you in the office early tomorrow.
      Mr. Edward Gott has had two years' experience with a London
      firm, and he will--of course--take over some of your
      responsibilities--"
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Keir's lips were pale and retracted. He stuffed both letter
      and envelope into his jacket pocket. Exigencies--opine! He
      became aware of a small hand grasping a trouser leg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dada--I've dug--such a big hole."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was trembling. He was on the edge of one of those
      rage-storms that smite a man in moments of bitter
      mortification. He looked down at the child. She too was
      elemental, but so different from the elements of his anger.
      He had a feeling of snatching himself back from some ugly
      self-betrayal. He picked up Joanna Mary and carried her out
      to her own particular mud-patch. He inspected the hole that
      her wooden spade had dug.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George, that's a wonderful hole! You didn't do it all
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded emphatically, proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to him to wonder where the fascination lay in
      the digging of a useless hole. Some infantile urge towards
      accomplishment, display? And after all--the Pyramids were
      no more than holes dug upwards into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splendid. You'll be able to bury Rose in it"--Rose was a
      rather hectic doll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna took him seriously. She was shocked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, no bury poor Rose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna had been put to bed before Keir showed his wife Mr.
      Hoad's letter. Sybil was looking a little hot and untidy
      after an hour's work among her flowers, and at such a time
      she reminded Keir of a pretty and animated child who had
      been romping with other children. She never suggested the
      sloven. They had carried two deck-chairs into the shade of
      the beech tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you think of that, Syb?"
    </p>
    <p>
      If, as his good comrade, he expected her to share in his
      fears and hopes and worries, to acclaim his triumphs and
      drink death or disaster to his enemies, he was merely man.
      He did not know that most women are apt to improve upon the
      opportunity and to regard a man's boyish outbursts as part
      of the day's foolishness. The romance may have passed from
      all rages, both sexual and spiritual. But Keir was
      surprised by her response to that letter. She was more
      actively angry than he was and anger was rare in her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's--abominable. It's--treachery."
    </p>
    <p>
      She may have suffered mortifications and disappointments of
      her own, but in this matter she was with him body and soul.
      She trembled; she was pale; her very hair was insurgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's so--mean, after all the work you've put in. Miserable
      little worm! I'd like to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's bitterness was whimsical.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gilded youth has the cash, kid. Isn't 'Gott' German
      for god? The golden god! But he kept me in the dark until
      he had brought off the deal. I rather thought he was the
      sort of chap who would use me."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a note of pain in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, Syb. I thought things were going to be
      different for all of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Impulsively she seized his hand and held it. Hoad's letter
      was lying on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, there's nothing for you to feel ashamed of. You
      couldn't help not having the money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes and mouth grew poignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you hadn't married me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was touched to the quick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's made no difference. I shouldn't have been a Gott.
      Besides, there is a difference. You're something more, Syb.
      Oh, yes, you are. You've taken it so damned well. I suppose
      some women--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, what hurts you hurts me."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o'clock Keir went to the office, but the office
      had not yet opened, and having one or two jobs to overlook,
      he rode off on the day's round. His first call was at a
      house that was being built by the firm on Kingham Hill, and
      as he dismounted, he heard loud laughter coming from the
      shell of the new building. Putting his bicycle against the
      hedge, he passed through the temporary gate, and entering
      the house by what was to be its front door, he surprised
      the men in conclave. Two of them were smoking pipes, and it
      was obvious that the occasion was so socially significant
      that the postponement of the day's work was justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir looked at the group of men and at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      "About time to get a move on, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of receiving ironical glances. The smokers
      did not put away their pipes, and instantly he was wise as
      to the situation. The atmosphere of that brick shell was
      hostile. Rumour had spread. His authority slid upon thin
      ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not utter another word. He stood there with his
      watch in his hand, and no one addressed a remark to him.
      One of the smokers, a bricklayer, seated on a plank
      supported by two buckets, knocked out his pipe and,
      ignoring Keir, issued an invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about a little job of work, boys?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir understood. He put his watch away. The men were on the
      move, but their activities were self-ordained and were not
      inspired by his presence. He had to move out of the way to
      let them pass to their various places, and not one of them
      looked at him. The facetious fellow of the party began to
      mount a ladder, and as he did so, he tapped the toe of a
      boot against each rung.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put your money on Early Worm, Charlie."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir waited until they had distributed themselves about the
      building, and, returning to the road, mounted his bicycle.
      As he pedalled off, he heard laughter celebrating his
      retreat. Someone shouted: "What price the Sergeant Major?"
      There was more laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir rode back to the yard and, going to the office, found
      that Mr. Hoad had arrived. He had sat down a moment ago at
      his desk and was adjusting his pince-nez. A clerk was busy
      with the morning's mail, and when Hoad saw Keir's face, he
      let fall over his own face the veil of a little, shimmering
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you, Keir. Come in. Just a moment, Hobbs. I want a
      few words with Mr. Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk, with a curious glance at Keir, got up and went
      out. Mr. Hoad's hands began to fiddle with the various
      objects on his desk; not that any readjustment or
      rearranging of these articles was needed. Mr. Hoad's uneasy
      hands sought occupation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had my letter, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His air of embarrassed brightness was an offence to Keir.
      It was so like the man and so like his silly question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes--I suppose you couldn't let me know earlier."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it would have made any difference, Keir, of course I
      should have notified you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of the men knew before I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That couldn't be so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't it? I got the news yesterday from the man who
      sells me my tobacco."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The leakage wasn't from this office."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir felt that he was being inveigled into a futile
      argument upon a question of procedure that neither
      concerned him nor continued to be of any importance. Hoad
      had picked up a box of matches and was rattling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I explained in my letter--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry if you are disappointed, but you remember I
      warned you. Mr. Gott is bringing the necessary capital into
      the business. I was finding myself very cramped."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave the match-box a last shake and put it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's the situation, Keir. I can only suggest that
      you make the best of it. Mr. Edward Gott--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's quite plain to me. What interests me is--my
      position in the future. Am I to understand that I go back
      to the shop as foreman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, Keir, of course that's open to you. Your
      position will be just what it was in Mr. Samson's day. Mr.
      Gott will take on the supervising, though I expect to get
      about myself now that I shall have a partner. I hope you
      will stay with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      His glance lifted to Keir's hat and remained fixed upon it
      for a moment. Keir had come into the office wearing his
      hat, and he was still wearing it. The office was not a
      place where etiquette was elaborated, but Mr. Hoad would
      have been more pleased if Keir had removed his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I think that's all, Keir. It's for you to decide. As
      you know, this firm doesn't have to stand off its regular
      hands. Employment's steady."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir stood staring at the office desk. He smiled very
      faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. Well--I suppose you will give me a day or two to
      think it over."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad's glasses glimmered at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly. Take till the end of the week."
    </p>
    <p>
      As Keir went out, he met a young man coming towards the
      door of the office. The young man was wearing plus-fours,
      and stockings of some audacity. He was a good-looking,
      solid, self-confident youngster and obviously not the type
      that is given to introspection. He had good teeth, blue
      eyes, an easy laugh. He was the sort of man who went about
      with his hands in his pockets and took life as it came.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man nodded at Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was not in a mood to respond to the easy friendliness
      of so cheerful and serene an extrovert. He was full to the
      lips with a sense of his own frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      His response was abrupt. It made him appear sulky, when he
      was only self-absorbed. The young man smiled and went into
      the office. He was Mr. Edward Gott, the new member of the
      firm, known to his intimates as Eddie. He smiled at Mr.
      Hoad. His facile smile could include even the prim
      fussiness of the senior partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning. Afraid I'm a bit late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad had so far rationalized young Gott that he could
      address him as Edward. Mr. Gott hung up his hat. He had a
      head of hair that possessed a natural wave that many young
      women might have envied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's the chap I met going out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir Smith, our foreman carpenter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Looks a bit of a Bolshie."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cataloguing of Keir as a Bolshevik appeared to amuse
      Mr. Hoad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not quite that, Edward. A little temperamental. Yes, I
      think that is the right word."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The day was strange to Keir. It was as though some
      essential and vital process had been arrested in him, and
      his hands were the hands of a fumbler. He walked slowly
      across the yard to the door of the carpenter's shop and
      hesitated before entering it, for into that familiar
      building he would carry his feeling of frustration and of
      failure. There were other men working at the benches, and
      they would watch him hang up his coat and put on an apron
      and become once more Keir Smith the carpenter. No doubt
      they would gloat a little over the return of the prodigal,
      the fellow who had been bucking around seeing that other
      fellows did their jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to compel himself to enter that shed. His assumption
      of nonchalance was too sharp in the edge. He was conscious
      of being scrutinized for a moment by those other men. He
      went to the corner where the coats hung, and as he took off
      his coat, he was sure that the eyes of the carpenter's shop
      were levelled upon his back. He faced about sharply and
      surprised two of the men grinning at each other. The fools!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, anyhow he was top dog in this little corner of the
      world. He spoke brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are waiting for those window frames. Any of them
      ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The information such as it was, was presented to him. One
      of the men grumbled at the quality of the wood. It was
      warped, and the timber-merchant's machines were both
      sanguinary and obsolete. A firm that sent out deal planed
      as they planed it ought to be forcibly liquidated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The damned muck wastes a chap's time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir took possession of the bench that had been his. He was
      looking at the same tarred fence and the top of the lilac
      bush, but old Tower with his mild, bald head was beside him
      no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pass over some of the stuff."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was back at his bench, but both his hands and his head
      were different. Almost he felt incoordinate and clumsy, a
      botcher, because the soul of him was distraught and
      disjointed. Even the shavings that littered the floor
      irritated him. They got under his feet. And in pegging a
      tenon he split the mortise, for his movements were rough
      and harsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He swore.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who sent us this ---- pulp?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some old shake-merchants. I reckon it was growing in
      Russia this time last year."
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides, did not Keir know that the tradition of the firm
      had changed? They were cutting costs. Mr. Hoad was out for
      economy. If old Samson had been a stout sort of putlog, Mr.
      Hoad was a lath, and pretty whippy at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day dragged on. It was full of ineptitudes and of
      exasperations. Even the work came cross-grained to Keir's
      hands. His head was full of other vexations. He was going
      back to "Merrow," a "Merrow" that was mortgaged. He was
      going back to tell Sybil that he had been slapped back into
      the old pigeonhole. All their plannings together, their
      dreams, were like the chips and the sawdust under his feet.
      He was just a man at a bench, and should he decide to
      quarrel with that bench, some other man would soon occupy
      it. He had to conform to the crowd complex. There was a boy
      in him that could have wept and a little dethroned god who
      raged. He was striking a chisel handle with a mallet, and
      chips flew. Yes, and in the more up-to-date shops the
      craftsman's place was taken by the machine, machines that
      sawed and planed and grooved, even a machine that
      sandpapered the shorn product. Life itself was a mere
      mechanism. He had tried to escape from it, and he had
      failed.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But as he cycled home on that summer evening, he realized
      himself as one of the crowd. Hundreds of other workers on
      bikes were streaming through the main streets of Kingham
      and distributing themselves into lanes and side streets.
      They were the corpuscles in the great organism's blood
      stream, and necessity pumped them to their labour or to
      their homes. They just circulated, and because Keir was
      feeling a little afraid of life and its vicissitudes, he
      became conscious of the man in all those other men. He
      understood their passions and their dreads, their envies
      and their prejudices, their resentment in the presence of
      too much success. He supposed that many of them did not
      think too deeply, and it was as well, for it seemed to him
      that no system of thought could produce the material
      Elysium that would mollify the multitude. The less a man
      fretted, the more simple his demands, the less conscious he
      would be of the frustrations and the failure. Baccy and
      beer. Certain of their own intellectuals might curse their
      own crowd and accuse them of being stupid swine, but there
      may be virtue and wisdom in such stolidity. The inevitable
      limitations of the crowd community cannot be thrown down
      like fences. The circumscribing and ordering of life become
      more complex and complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bitterness of the day was chastened for him, because
      this fear of the future was upon him, and when man is
      afraid, he draws nearer to his fellows. In the Abbey Lands
      road he fell in with a neighbour, that Mr. Brown--a clerk
      in the Borough Council office, whose three children had
      provoked Sybil into quoting him as a prophet. Mr. Brown was
      a delicate and round-shouldered man who took life and his
      work with a kind of gentle seriousness. He was
      black-coated, industrious, and no rebel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown remarked upon the badness of trade. He happened
      to know that a part of Kingham was finding it difficult to
      pay its rates.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One's lucky to have a settled job. Yes, and a bit of
      garden. How are your potatoes doing this year?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir liked this other man. There was a quality of quiet
      courage in Brown, and Brown had three children. Often Keir
      had seen that worried look at the back of Brown's eyes. It
      made him think of a troubled child looking out of a window
      on a wet day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, pretty well. I'm afraid my wife's the gardener."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you're one of the lucky ones, Smith, if I may say so.
      Same here. I married a friend, not a cheap cinema fan. How
      some chaps manage these days I can't imagine."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was riding on the outside. He felt protective towards
      Brown.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, they don't. I've seen something of the inside of
      some of the new homes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose you have."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have to go into them in the way of work. Silk stockings
      and a dirty sink. Tinned salmon and the bath all slimy. If
      a girl loathes housework and can't cook--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Brown's eyes lit up. He was one of those creatures who
      found his own mate the core and creator of his world of
      sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, pretty hopeless. Tell you what--I'm jolly grateful to
      a woman who backs you up. It isn't all jam for a girl.
      Kids, yes. No joke, but it's worth it--if you've got a
      philosophy."
    </p>
    <p>
      They arrived at the gate of Brown's cottage in the lane. He
      too had a mortgage and a life insurance to keep him
      thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So long, old chap. I've got to cut the grass."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brown swung himself off his machine, and Keir smiled
      back at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Always the grass!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, always the grass. But after squatting in a chair,
      yes, it's a contrast."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir rode on. He felt that the humanity in the other fellow
      had warmed him. This other man had worries. Well, of
      course. One ought to remember such things. It was possible
      to become too self-centred and to regard oneself as the
      only fly stuck on the fly-paper. Brown was a wholesome,
      kindly chap in spite of his three kids, or because of them.
      He was fond of his wife. He had not let himself go sour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, dismounting at the gate of "Merrow," found Joanna
      Mary waiting to waylay him. She had to be lifted up and
      plumped upon the saddle of his bike. He trundled her as far
      as the shed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna pointed to the end of the garden where Sybil was
      down among the early potatoes exploring the produce of the
      first root with a fork. She was counting the tubers. They
      were not very large, but Sybil was satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--there are thirteen. Not so bad."
    </p>
    <p>
      He teased her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thirteen! Can't you find another? I don't like thirteen."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took him seriously. She thrust in the fork, and turning
      up the soil, she did discover one rather minute tuber like
      the last small pig in a litter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fourteen!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's eyes dwelt upon her in a particular way. She was a
      lovable creature, and he was lucky. Holding Joanna Mary by
      the hand, he went across and took the fork from Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll put it away for you. Here, let Jo have No. 14. How
      many little pigs went to market? What, you don't know, Jo?
      Your education's been neglected."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was provoked into posing as a philosopher. The day had
      been full of bitterness, and at the end of it there was a
      jest on his lips. He was looking at fourteen young potatoes
      in the hollow of his wife's apron. He was carrying the fork
      for her and holding Joanna Mary by the hand. What a picture
      of domestic devotion! And yet the facile sneer was absent,
      and if he could smile in the face of his fate, he was
      somehow more than a little, flippant self-analyst in
      trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his wife's eyes he divined the question that she had not
      asked. "What news?" With Joanna Mary between them he walked
      with her up the garden path. His face looked smoothed out.
      He was contriving to transcend the bitterness of the day's
      happenings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm back in the shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of her quick, comprehending glance. For an
      instant her mouth looked poignant. She was wounded for his
      sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the old bench, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The one I used to tell you about. With the black fence and
      the lilac bush to look at."
    </p>
    <p>
      The set of his head was gaillard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I felt quite fumble-fisted. It's just a bit of life. One's
      not unique, you know."
    </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, but when they came to the back door, he
      met the steadfast fondness of her eyes. She both smiled and
      yet did not smile. There was more than mere understanding
      in her eyes. The dear comrade in them cried out to him,
      applauding and proud and tender: "You're brave. You've
      taken it--as a man should. If you had been just bitter and
      hard and angry--I should have felt sad. But you're not.
      You're bigger than that. Oh, my dear, I love you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thanks, Syb. It's good to be with someone like you just
      now."
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      He chose to remain at his bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      For when he had considered his crisis, he acknowledged that
      there was no reasonable alternative. He might have marched
      out upon his dignity and applied for a job elsewhere, but
      in Kingham such opportunities were limited, and he was tied
      to Kingham by "Merrow." Possibly there were five or six
      other firms in Kingham who could employ him, but not as
      Messrs. Samson, Hoad &amp; Gott employed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for setting up in an odd-job business of his own, he
      realized that so questionable an independence was beyond
      his resources. He had obligations and no fluid capital. He
      could not afford to rent a little shop in a back street and
      hire labour and put up a board and wait. It was not in him
      to go touting round Kingham as a little man who could
      perform cheaply the repairs and redecorations of other
      little people. He had some knowledge of what that kind of
      life could offer. For three months you might be worked to
      the bone, and your profits be less than the wages of an
      employee in a well-established firm, and for the next three
      months a drought would prevail, and life be an affair of
      potatoes and bread and margarine and weak tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      He submitted and endured.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was any bitterness in him, he concealed it. He was
      once more a man among men, his little brief promise of
      authority withdrawn, his future much as theirs. Moreover,
      there was born in him during those difficult days a feeling
      of fatalism. His chance had perched and flown. It would not
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He faced the facts calmly and those other men, watching for
      signs of revolt and for the sulkiness of a conceit that had
      been chastened, were disappointed. He came and went among
      them and worked with them as though he had known no other
      world or dreamed of no other accomplishments. He was the
      Keir Smith of two years ago, but less aloof and seemingly
      more cheerful. They divined in him that which a more
      understanding observer would have described as dignity.
      Being plain fellows they confessed in the vernacular that
      Keir had guts.
    </p>
    <p>
      If life had handed him the medicine, he had drunk it down
      without a grimace, and in a little while they ceased from
      exchanging significant glances behind his back. They
      thought of him as Keir, and not as Mr. Smith. He too,
      calling them by their Christian names, was received into
      the fold of their unprovoked goodwill.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      So Keir looked out of his window and saw the black fence
      and the lilac bush, and if he bent forward over the bench
      and looked obliquely through the glass he could see the
      door of the office, and perhaps the figure of Hoad or Gott
      emerging or entering. A particular pane of glass in the
      window produced in Mr. Hoad's figure characteristic
      distortions. It made him appear even more long and meagre;
      it gave him a kink in the middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad was not gaining in popularity. His mean little
      face, his pince-nez, and his tubular legs were somehow an
      offence to the men. They called him the "Parsnip," and the
      word was almost a pictograph, for Mr. Hoad was cultivating
      parsimony, a carefulness as to costs. He was very polite to
      the men, and they loathed him for it. Had he dared, he
      would have cut wages, but, being no swashbuckler, he made a
      flank attack upon the firm's expenditure. Being too much a
      coward to initiate an assault upon the material status of
      his employees, he raided his materials. Messrs. Samson,
      Hoad &amp; Gott began to use cheap timber, poor paint,
      castings that were made abroad; and the men grumbled. Mr.
      Hoad had the soul of a swindler. He was jerry-built
      himself, and the taint would out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Old Sam wouldn't have stood for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was at one with the men. Old Samson had put his stout
      and ruddy self into his work, and the reputation of the
      firm had been built up on good concrete, and it was with a
      kind of sardonic interest that Keir observed Mr. Hoad's
      prevarications. His specifications were imposing. The best
      timber was budgeted for, but if there was no architect to
      overlook the job, Mr. Hoad economized. He was a
      breeze-block man, an importer of cheap, foreign-made doors.
      If he could put in glass of light weight, he put it in. The
      paint-shop became known as the "dope hole."
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Eddie Gott, he was cheerful, easy, go-as-you-please.
      He was neither very thorough nor very experienced. His
      fundamental interests lay elsewhere. He drove girls about
      in a highly coloured and swanky little car and could be
      seen at "The Ace of Hearts" at five o'clock in the morning
      eating bacon and eggs after a night of adventure. Yet the
      men liked him. He symbolized physical success. He was just
      what so many of them would like to be, a chap with money, a
      card, a fellow who could dress up and play hell with the
      girls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Eddie was all right. He was not the kind of man who
      would have scamped his job so far as materials were
      concerned. He would not have prostituted the paint-pot. But
      Hoad! A slimy little ----, and not so relevantly virile as
      the vulgar epithet implied. A spot of grease, a louse. And
      in some curious way Mr. Hoad's stinginess permeated the
      whole concern and began to suffuse it with unrest and
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, more sensitive than his fellows, was quick to divine
      disturbance in the atmosphere. The firm of Samson, Hoad
      &amp; Gott was still a non-union business. In the old days
      the men would have said that they knew where they were with
      old Sam. In a sense they may have preferred his downright
      solidity to the coruscations of a demagogue like Mr.
      Sparks. But Hoad was not Samson. He spread suspicion, an
      elemental mistrust, a feeling of niggardliness and fear. He
      affected the men in somewhat the same way that a windy
      officer worried the troops in the trenches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, listening to fragments of conversation, knew that the
      firm had become an unhappy ship, not only because the chief
      was showing himself to be a bad shipmaster, but because his
      crew distrusted him as a man. Also, it became known that
      the firm was losing credit and, what was more serious,
      contracts. If Mr. Hoad had shown himself a successful
      pirate, much might have been forgiven him, but as one of
      the workshop wits put it: "He's the sort of chap who ought
      to be driving a third-rate hearse. What's worse, we're the
      corpse inside of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their discontent had to sublimate itself. Mr. Samson had
      said that the British working man was the best in the
      world, but that he was apt to be an awkward beast if you
      got him sulky, and Keir, meeting Mr. Sparks outside the
      yard gates, found the fellow unexpectedly affable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Keir, how's life these days?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a whimsical invitation in the official eye, but
      Keir was cautious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might be worse."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sparks lit a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Might be much worse.--You take me? There's a bit of a
      breeze in the air."
    </p>
    <p>
      He eyed Keir obliquely, for according to rumour Keir might
      prove to be the firm's one and serious nonconformist, and
      if so, Keir would be in the minority of one. Mr. Sparks,
      like all men who are ambitious in their own particular
      calling, might and did regard Keir's conversion as a
      <i>tour de force,</i> a possible flower in the official
      buttonhole. He edged up familiarly to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Between you and me--there's a situation."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir understood him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sparks gave that characteristic flick of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, be fair. I'm just the man's man, that's all. I'm a
      sort of figurehead. We're not satisfied. Get me? When an
      employer starts messing a business about--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir watched Mr. Sparks's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't tell an employer how he is to run his business,
      can you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, can't we! We can make things a bit interesting for
      him. Now, look here, Keir, you must know what sort of stuff
      you are handling."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--I know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--that's not--O. K., is it? The men are fed up with
      the show. You think that over. You're a straight one. You
      ought to be with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And we can present each other with gold watches and
      illuminated addresses! As a matter of fact--the old boy was
      as straight as an oak post."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's smile appeared to spread to the face of the
      official. Sparks was not a bad chap, and when he was not
      pushing his program upon the public, he could betray a
      sense of humour, and in the not very far future Keir was to
      forgive the other fellow his shiny chin and little black
      moustache and his air of rather cheap infallibility. Teddie
      Sparks was human.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's right. Old Sam was so straight and stiff that
      it was no use trying to put a rope on him. Besides, what
      you say on a platform and what you think in private--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave Keir a gentle dig with his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've responsibilities to my show. And it isn't always all
      roses, I can tell you. I have to put in an advert, now and
      again. This firm's going union."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Solid?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sparks puckered up his eyes at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm living in hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was serious news for Keir. He gathered that Sparks has
      been sounding him, and that if the situation developed and
      he should prove recalcitrant, he would be a marked man. He
      could count on no protection from Hoad, for if Mr. Hoad was
      cornered and compelled to employ none but union labour, he
      would have no compunction about sacrificing an
      obstructionist. Keir would find himself extruded like a
      piece of grit from the machine. He could feel the crisis in
      the air. It looked at him out of the eyes of the men with
      whom he worked. One of them, a quiet fellow who was
      employed in the painter's shop, dropped him a hint, and
      Keir thanked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I know, Jack. Everybody is to sign the covenant. You
      chaps are watching me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you're one of us. You can take it from me that what
      I'd stand for under old Sam I won't stand for under Mr.
      Slippery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's something in it, Jack."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a damned lot in it. Look at the muck I have to
      use, stuff that won't stand the weather."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will joining the union alter the paint, Jack?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And why shouldn't it? Haven't we a right to get sulky over
      a swindle?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir could detect an uneasiness in Mr. Hoad. The fellow was
      worried and for that reason all the more suave, and Keir
      suspected Mr. Hoad of trying to sound him on the situation.
      The soul of Keir laughed. He was not deceived by the Hoad
      mincings and circumlocutions. He guessed that Hoad was
      capable of using him as a dummy, as an argument, even as a
      possible ally. He would attempt to set Smith up against
      Sparks and to parley behind the figure of a recalcitrant
      Smith. Lastly, the crisis might provide him with an excuse
      of ridding himself of a man who was too much Samson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir remained grave and aloof in the presence of the Hoad
      suavities. He was blind to suggestions. He gave no
      information and asked for none. He gathered that Mr. Eddie
      Gott was of no combative value in such a crisis. The
      younger partner would welcome an easy solution, conform,
      and run away to play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad became more pointed in his questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you noticed any--discontent among the men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir put on an air of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not having any trouble in the shop. Isn't discontent a
      social generalization?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoad gave him a spiteful look.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a very awkward spirit abroad, Keir. Most
      disturbing. I ascribe it to the loss of all religious
      feeling."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir said: "Quite so."
    </p>
    <p>
      In a week he knew exactly how he stood. Mr. Sparks had been
      able to hand Mr. Hoad an ultimatum. The firm would agree to
      employ union labour and nothing but union labour. Yes, the
      men were solid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad compromised. That is to say--he surrendered. But
      he took off his pince-nez and polished them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say that every man in the firm is taking his ticket?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sparks was wearing his autocratic manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even--Smith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I can vouch for Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoad made a little wriggling movement in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And supposing that Keir--? He's a foreman, you
      know--Between ourselves, Mr. Sparks, I rather suspect Smith
      of having worried the men. I'm all for peace. That's why I
      am ready to meet you. I don't want a disturber of the peace
      in my employment, a fellow who is bossy and tactless."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir's all right. Besides, if he signs on--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sparks loved a suggestion of truculence when he was
      sure of his opponent's flabbiness. Mr. Hoad had better not
      interfere with Keir if Keir conformed. And that was that.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the interview Mr. Sparks strolled, hands in pockets,
      into the carpenter's shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Keir, can I have a word with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir left his bench and they went together into a corner of
      the yard, and there the official explained the situation.
      He said of Hoad: "He's as artful as a wagon-load of
      monkeys. I've got a shrewd suspicion that he has a down on
      you, old man, but I have him tied up properly. If you come
      in, he'll have to let you alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      He offered Keir a cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have one. Yes, there are good employers--and bad; and the
      worst are the slippery ones. I always got on with old Sam.
      I had no change out of him, and he had no change out of
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir accepted a cigarette. He understood that he was in a
      corner between Sparks and Hoad, and of the two men he
      preferred Sparks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right. Give me till tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will. Look here, I can be a tactful bloke. I'll just
      stroll into the shop about ten. If it's yes, just nod at
      me."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The adventure of going home was becoming more and more a
      crowd affair, and between five and six o'clock Kingham
      could recall to Keir that phrase: The Solidity of Labour.
      Hundreds of men and girls streamed through the main
      streets, and this swarm of bicycles possessed the roadway.
      It held up the cars, ignored them, or balked them with
      sullen wilfulness. It might and did cast glances of
      hostility at the "autos" of the prosperous. It poured
      north, south, east, and west out of Kingham, knee to knee,
      and nose to tail. Its sources were various, for during the
      last few years the purlieus of Kingham had seen the
      erection of several factories. There were eddies and
      cross-currents, for coordination was lacking. Operatives
      who worked in the northern area rode south to their homes,
      and vice versa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had made many attempts to detach himself from this
      procession and to steer a secret course of his own and
      avoid the convoy, but circular tours round side streets
      inevitably had returned him to the multitude. He had
      conformed, and now he rode with the crowd. He wobbled in
      and out with it, was carried along by it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that evening when the choice of conforming had been
      thrust upon him, he was saying to his soul: "I want to be
      free."
    </p>
    <p>
      But what was freedom? Where was it to be found? Was not the
      very concept of freedom an illusion so far as it concerned
      this crowd of clerks and typists, mechanics, labourers,
      shopmen? There was no escape from the bench or the counter
      or the stool. Life had become a factory, producing articles
      for profit rather than for use, and man had become the
      slave of a system. Were a frenzy for freedom to stampede
      the crowd, it would find its career stayed on the edge of
      that bitter sea, starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The socialists might provide minor ameliorations, serve out
      little savouries from the communal kitchen, but they too
      were part of the crowd. Keir had talked to men whose
      socialism was their credo, and he had divined in them a
      deep uneasiness. They might utter bold words, but in their
      hearts was the fear of the cataclysm. Your lips might lisp
      altruism, but of what use were phrases when the foundations
      began to quake under your feet? Work, work and food for
      these millions. Eden, the Golden Age! But Adam was still
      Adam, and no I.L.P. could feed him on tinned altruism and
      hot air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freedom, yes, a relative freedom might be possible for the
      few, for the masterful, the fortunate, the very skilled,
      the very determined and courageous. As Keir saw it, there
      were certain members of the community who would always
      command more social value. It was inevitable. As for the
      angelic voices, he mistrusted them. Somewhere, even in a
      mock social heaven, there would always be a secret golden
      cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode homewards with the crowd. It thinned out gradually
      to a trickle. It ceased when he entered the familiar lane.
      He rode alone to the little white gate of "Merrow," and at
      this gate the haunting shapes of Hoad and Sparks seemed to
      vanish.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself kissing his wife, and as though that kiss
      was a seal and a symbol. Freedom! The contract of marriage.
      Had not the old people been wise in suffusing life with
      sacraments?
    </p>
    <p>
      Could a man ever free himself from material things? Was not
      freedom otherwise, inward, secret and spiritual? If you
      could not escape into your self, and perhaps into some
      other beloved self, what escape was there?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was becoming far more dependent upon his wife. He felt
      more at ease when he brought his problems home and laid
      them in her lap. He liked to talk things over with her, for
      in Sybil life had developed a serene solidity, a wholesome
      and workaday wisdom. The little, sensitive bud had opened
      and set its fruit. Almost, her more impatient and flippant
      sisters might have condemned her as the patient little ass
      upon whom man--the eternal egoist--laid the baggage of his
      doubts and dilemmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something to tell you, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      They carried their chairs on to the small lawn, and on the
      lawn next door Mrs. Challis and her portable wireless set
      and two men were severally vocal. A year ago the hubbub
      would have irritated Keir, but on this evening he did not
      appear to notice the Challis world.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The firm's going union."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil had brought a basket of peas with her, the last
      picking from a late sowing, and she shelled them into a
      bowl. The bowl reposed in her lap. Keir, sitting forward in
      his chair, and smoking his pipe, watched her busy hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will it make any difference to your money, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I don't think so. One just resents being tied up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her brown eyes and looked at him just as she
      looked at Joanna Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you like to be master. You're so very proud, you
      know, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her and accepted her decretal. Her first
      question had been that of the domestic economist primarily
      concerned with the fundamentals of housekeeping. She had
      become a very capable economist, and yet he believed that
      she could understand his dislike of all coercion. "Merrow"
      itself was an experiment in individualism, a protest
      against Paragon Place and too much propinquity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "It's a question of being able to call your soul
      your own. You can't when you join a caucus. You have to
      swallow all the bunk, and shout the class catch-cries.
      You've got to cheer when some loud-speaker is let loose on
      a platform and bawls out a lot of stuff that you know to be
      nonsense. This freedom! The machine has to go on working.
      We're told we mustn't do this and we mustn't do that, or
      you are given the tip to slow up the machine. Or we are
      dragged out on strike when most of us only ask to be left
      alone. It's all so damned silly."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hands shed green peas into the basin. She looked at his
      dark and rebellious head with an air of benign
      understanding. Men were such children. They became excited
      over politics and theories, just like a mob of boys playing
      football with no referee to decide on the points of the
      game. They shouted and argued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it matter very much, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Matter!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I mean--there's so much more. Or--I should say there
      was so much more. Can't one look on a trades union and all
      that as a sort of workshop? When you put on your coat and
      come home--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave a toss of the head, and a laugh that was almost
      soundless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just what I've been coming to. After all, life's
      relative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Relative?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's a word they use a good deal now. If one's
      pigeonholed as a worker, one need not be pigeonholed as a
      man. All those chaps who go to London and sit in offices,
      well--in a sense--they are just as much tied up as we are.
      We all live under the eternal autocrat--necessity."
    </p>
    <p>
      She emptied the last pea pod.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as it was in the Bible, Keir. God made Adam--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He held his pipe at arm's length and looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Jehovah! We've got our Jehovah still, my dear,
      whether we call ourselves deists, or rationalists, or
      socialists, or just--scientists. Life's all coercion--in a
      sense--though we try to cheat ourselves with phrases. We
      may learn to dodge a few bricks. We can adapt."
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Adam grow green peas--like ours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was quizzed, and he quizzed her in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you teach Eve a thing or two about cooking? I guess
      you could. One shouldn't froth too much. There's too much
      froth about most of us these days."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      In the latter half of August the Smith family went for a
      week to Ramsgate. A heat wave had made a sudden appearance,
      the temperature was eighty-five in the shade, and Joanna
      Mary was sick in the train. The third-class carriage held
      its full complement of five a side, and poor Joanna spilled
      herself over her mother's holiday cretonne frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear! Quick, a handkerchief, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir saw that Sybil was much more sorry for Joanna Mary
      than for her own frock. Even the heat and the catastrophe
      could not spoil her temper, and Keir hurried to assist as
      best he could. On the whole the carriage was sympathetic,
      though a fat and florid elderly man who was sitting beside
      Sybil edged off and covered his knees with a newspaper. A
      motherly person next to Keir reft half the newspaper from
      her husband's knees and crumpled it into an improvised
      basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little soul, it's the heat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had taken Joanna from her mother, and he and the kind
      person attended to the crisis while Sybil tried to clean
      her frock. Moreover, Joanna's front needed attention, and
      the motherly person sacrificed her own handkerchief.
      Joanna, none the worse, and feeling herself to be the
      centre of attraction, could yet apologize like a small
      gentlewoman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So sorry. It--would--come. Oh, poor mummy's frock!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Eventually the improvised basin was ejected from the
      window, and the two soiled handkerchiefs were wrapped up in
      a piece of newspaper. Sybil was assuring the motherly
      person that she would have her handkerchief washed and
      returned to her if she would give her--Sybil--her address.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's no occasion at all, my dear. You're very welcome.
      You give that frock of yours a sponge directly you get in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was flushed and grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But do give me your address."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're going to Ramsgate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So are we."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. 5 Victoria Terrace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, isn't that a coincidence! We're going to No. 3."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna, returned to her mother's lap, smiled solemnly
      across at the motherly person. She approved of the motherly
      person. She wanted to repay kindness with kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got a bucket and spade. Have you got a bucket and
      spade?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear, I haven't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll lend you mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stout lady leaned across and kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, isn't that sweet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At Ramsgate station Keir man-handled their two suitcases.
      No need to waste money on an outside porter. Joanna
      insisted on carrying her own impedimenta. The motherly
      person and her florid husband were taking a taxi. What with
      the heat and adipose tissue, a taxi was inevitable;
      besides, they had a nice little greengrocery business in
      the Essex Road, Islington. They offered the Smiths a lift.
      It was accepted for Sybil and Joanna and the suitcases, but
      Keir insisted on walking. He would not crowd them up. But
      later, when he was unpacking in the No. 3 back bedroom, and
      Sybil was sponging her frock, he confessed that there was a
      great deal of kindness in the world, and Sybil agreed with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, there is. I do hope this won't stain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna was watching her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was dirty of me, wasn't it? But it would come."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, darling, you couldn't help it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that's rather my view of life."
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 3 Victoria Terrace asserted that it possessed a view of
      the sea, and certainly by squeezing yourself against an
      upper window you could obtain an oblique view of the ocean,
      just a glistening strip of it stretched between the chimney
      stacks of Prospect Terrace and the bulk of the Palace
      Hotel. This was of no great import, for the sea was there;
      it could not escape, nor could all the children in the
      world have removed Ramsgate sands. Keir's was the delight
      of introducing Joanna Mary to the sea. The heat had upset
      Sybil. She woke with a disastrous headache and decided to
      stay in bed till lunch on two aspirins and a cup of tea,
      and Keir had to attend to the toilet and the dressing of
      Joanna. It was a gorgeous day, with a light breeze to
      temper the heat, and when Keir and Joanna arrived on the
      sea front, Joanna stood holding her father's hand and
      looking at the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where does it stop, daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Down there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, the other end. Does it go on for ever and ever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bits of it--right round the world."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must have given God a lot of trouble making it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was amused and touched. Poor God! He was muchly
      responsible. And from below came a babel of voices, like
      some multitudinous bird song, joyous and incessant. The
      sands were stippled with colour. Humanity was sunning
      itself. The sea was coming in, and hundreds of wooden
      spades were busy. Keir and Joanna found a sloping way and a
      series of steps, and when the sands were gained, Joanna
      bounced up and down on fat and exultant legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, isn't it--lovely!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry might have been her mother's.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir and the child found a claim that had not been staked
      out by other families. The bucket and spade were brought
      into action. They began with sand pies, but that was a mere
      kickshaw. Joanna grew ambitious. She wanted a castle, a
      mound with a moat round it to defy the incoming sea. Other
      children were building castles, and Keir took off his coat
      and laid it on the sand; he got busy with the spade. Joanna
      assisted, scooping up sand with the bucket. Her little face
      was solemn and flushed and moist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's coming up, daddy. Dig, dig."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir threw up a mighty mound, and presently the little
      swishing waves began to lap the glacis. Keir and Joanna
      stood on the summit like a couple of Canutes. Man's
      handiwork crumbled, and when a large section of the mound
      flopped into the water, Keir picked up Joanna and carried
      her to safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what happens when you try to stop the sea, young
      woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The sturdiness of Joanna was not convinced. She was an
      optimist; she wanted to begin all over again, but her
      father was warmer than she was, and he sat on his coat and
      lit a pipe. Joanna, squatting down beside him, took off her
      shoes and filled them with sand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got Ramsgate in my shoes, daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't find Ramsgate very comfortable when you try to
      walk in them, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Other children were paddling, and Joanna wanted to be in
      the fashion; so when Keir had finished his pipe, he took
      off his socks and shoes and rolled up his grey flannel
      trousers. Joanna had prepared herself, and, imitating her
      father, stuffed her white socks into her small shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oo--it tickles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They played games with the sea, daring Father Neptune to
      come on and scurrying back when he threatened to come on
      too thoroughly and souse Joanna's petticoats. Keir enjoyed
      himself. He had not enjoyed himself so much for a long
      time. He felt like a kid, with the problematic part of
      himself pleasantly discarded. He thought how much prettier
      Joanna's pink feet were than his rather knobbly ones. What
      a pity it was that life could not stay all pink feet!
    </p>
    <p>
      At No. 3 poor Sybil's headache continued in spite of
      aspirin and a half-darkened room, and she decided to remain
      in bed for the rest of the day. Joanna and her father went
      down again to the sea, and, since the tide was out, Joanna
      captured a very small crab. It was put in the bucket with
      some seaweed and water and carried back to No. 3 Victoria
      Terrace as Joanna's offering to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've caught you a crab, mummy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil's headache was better, and she could pretend that the
      small crustacean was the most marvellous of creatures. It
      spent the night in the bucket under the wash-hand stand,
      and next day it was returned to the sea. For Sybil was
      softhearted even towards crabs, and she explained to Joanna
      that the crab was but another Joanna, and that the crab's
      mother would be feeling anxious and distressed, and that
      the baby crab was homesick.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must be kind to crabs, Jo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna Mary agreed with her mother. The crabling had had a
      night out and had enjoyed free board and lodging with the
      Smith family. With great solemnity the bucket was carried
      at low tide to a shallow pool, and the crab returned to its
      native element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna watched it walk away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you think it will find its mother, mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was quite sure that all would be well with the crab
      world. She believed in being very sure with children. She
      had often declared to Keir that children should be taught
      to believe in things. Keir had not asked her to define and
      catalogue her "things." If Jo continued to believe in her
      mother, and perhaps in him, she would not grow up a little
      domestic cynic, and that was about as far as his faith
      could carry him.

    <p>
      It might have been said of Keir that he belonged to three
      different generations. He was his Victorian grandfather,
      his Edwardian and rebelliously rational father, and his
      neo-Georgian and contemporary self. Had he been asked to
      choose between the three, he would have elected to look
      upon the world of men with the eyes of his comfortably
      credulous grandfather. His memories of his father and of
      his father's rather snarling reasonableness were not happy
      ones, for the elder Smith's world had been founded on too
      much Huxley and political economy. And Keir's contemporary
      self was so modern in the shrug of its shoulders. His
      father had been so very sure that all religion was
      sacerdotal humbug, and somehow his iconoclasm had satisfied
      him. Keir, having no religion, would sometimes yearn for a
      God, for a revelation that would renew the martyrdom of man
      and give it passionate meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come out alone and had walked along the harbour
      wall. The sun was setting, and he paused to lean against
      the wall. The holiday crowd was promenading; fishermen were
      preparing to pack up for the night. His nostrils were full
      of the smell of the sea. He was not very conscious of all
      those other people, mothers and fathers, children, young
      men and girls to whom life was largely the adventure of
      sex. It was a noisy and a cheerful community. It did not
      stand on the edge of the unknown and challenge the
      unknowable to manifest itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir remembered his small daughter's question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where does it stop, daddy? Does it go on for ever and
      ever?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were whimsical and sad, for like a young child he
      was in a mood to ask just such questions, and there was no
      father to answer him. What was the thing called life? Had
      man been just a fortuitous emergence from green slime? And
      whence the slime? Did anything that man
      experienced--matter? Eat, drink, and get money, behave like
      a cheerful, organic creature, laugh and sneer by turns.
      Cultivate a serene, superior flippancy! Was that the
      ultimate and only posture, or did man hang on a cross and
      cry like Christ: "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken
      me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly Keir was afraid of the sea, and of the
      darkness that was spreading out of the east. A little,
      chilly wind seemed to paw him with clammy and contemptuous
      fingers. He turned towards the town and its lights. There
      was man, man and his dynamo, and his high-tension wires and
      his pubs and his noise, his shrimp teas and his cinemas.
      The human show. What could you do but submerge yourself in
      it, swim with other fish in the behaviorist aquarium?
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked back to Victoria Terrace. He walked fast, like a
      man hurrying home on a bitter and bewildering night. He
      wanted light, even electric light, and drawn curtains, and
      the faces of those other creatures who were familiar to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Sybil waiting by a window. She had just put a very
      tired Joanna Mary to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--I was feeling a little lonesome."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Were you, kid? Well, what about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go to the pictures."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went.

    <p>
      That was the last Smith holiday before the slump. As a
      matter of fact, the weather had long been gloomy in the
      north, and Lancashire had ceased to think for those soft
      and sluggish southerners, perhaps because in the old days
      cotton and cerebration had been the products of slave
      labour and of a bald-headed complacency. King Coal was
      weeping sooty tears. The steel industry had become a
      painted lath. Certainly, gramophones and wireless sets
      continued to sell, and the output of small motor-cars
      mounted and mounted, and people were found who would
      finance dirt-tracks and greyhound-racing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The depression moved south. Possibly the effects it
      produced were patchy, and a borough like Kingham was not in
      the bottom of the trough. Trade statistics made gloomy
      reading, with exports shedding millions every month. Prices
      tumbled. The experts commenced the eternal wrangle upon
      over-production and under-consumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creators of enterprise were worried, labour inclined to be
      suspicious and sullen. If Mr. Sparks was asked for his
      views, he put on his platform manner and blubbered his
      chin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a vast ramp. They're preparing an attack on wages.
      Not a penny off the pay, you chaps, or a minute on the
      day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir found Mr. Sparks's truculence frothy and unconvincing.
      Rumour had it that the firm was losing contracts. Mr. Hoad
      might send in ingenious estimates and undercut his
      competitors, but somehow the Hoad policy was not paying.
      Though prices were falling, Mr. Hoad's customers may have
      discovered the poor quality and texture of the firm's
      product. It became obvious to Keir that work was short, and
      he could watch the men spinning out their jobs and so
      assisting in the firm's undoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoad went about with an air of emaciated apprehension. You
      could imagine him sitting up like a hungry rat and trying
      to sleek out his whiskers. But adversity was driving him
      out of his rat-hole, the office. The pay-sheet and the
      output did not balance each other. The men were going slow;
      paint-brushes lingered lovingly; ladders were very much
      ladders. Mr. Hoad's head with its glimmering glasses would
      appear unexpectedly in the doorway of the carpenter's shop,
      apologetically suspicious, and one morning he caught one of
      the younger men smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put that pipe out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The voice was a new voice. It had lost all its suavity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad was greatly excited. His lower jaw quivered. He
      looked almost as white as his collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can't work and smoke. What do I pay wages for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He snarled at Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're responsible here, Smith. Get a move on, get a move
      on."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, as though his chattering rage had exhausted
      itself and given place to fear, he banged the door and
      fled. The offender had removed the pipe, but when the door
      had closed, he stuck it back in his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "---- little ape."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir said nothing, but went on with his work. He was
      becoming a sceptic in the matter of the spoken word. The
      opposing factions handed each other words like the pieces
      of a puzzle that did not fit and were not meant to fit.
      "Increase production"--"We're not going to be pushed to
      provide you with profits"--"Wages must come down"--"Smash
      the capitalist." The silly wrangle both saddened Keir and
      worried him. He began to believe that man's only education
      was necessity. Nor was he sorry for Hoad. Hoad was as much
      in need of education as were the obstructing operatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he had to cycle past the Labour Exchange in Elm
      Road. The queue was increasing, trailing along the pavement
      and spreading into little, sullen groups. Men out of work,
      men on the dole, old men and louts, decent fellows and
      social spongers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would he ever be in that queue? Hanging about at street
      corners, sneering at people in cars, suspicious,
      disgruntled, and growing perhaps cynical and callous. "----
      the ----. Tax 'em to death. What's the use of a Labour
      Government if it can't skin the swine?" Yes, bitterness,
      ugly looks, suspicion, sodden boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to watch and wait for the inevitable hand to glide
      in and pluck one of the men from the carpenter's shop. One
      Friday it appeared. He of the pipe had received his ticket
      and his <i>congé.</i> He came in looking white and savage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been stood off."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hard luck, Alf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hard luck be ----. The ---- little swine has a down on me.
      It's victimization. I'm going to see Ted Sparks. He'll put
      it across the blighter."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, suddenly, he grabbed a plane and with a sweep of
      the hand sent it crashing through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, I wish I had a Mills bomb. I'd chuck it through
      the little ---- window."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Two weeks later six other men were discharged by Messrs.
      Samson, Hoad &amp; Gott; two painters, a bricklayer and his
      labourer, a plumber's mate, and another man in the
      carpenter's shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was left with a fellow named Hobbs, one of the quiet
      sort who was a steady worker. Hobbs had a sense of humour,
      and a wife and five children, and perhaps because of them
      his sense of humour ran in harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We're two of the tame ones, Keir. We've got Whipsnade all
      to ourselves. Yes, it won't be you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hobbs was planing down the edge of a board. He had thin and
      hairy arms, and a hollow chest. He paused to clear the
      plane of a chip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you're a fixture. You cost a bit more than I do, but
      then I've got no head for shaping a big job. Seen Alf since
      he was stood off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ran into him at the 'Chequers' last night, full of beer
      and blasting-powder. He was cursing Ted Sparks. There's no
      sense in that sort of foolery."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir agreed. He was discovering that however nicely a
      trade-union organization might weave its restrictions, it
      could not compel an employer to hang suspended in a void.
      Caught in the complexities of material circumstances, Mr.
      Sparks was as helpless as the men. He had interviewed Hoad
      and protested against operatives' being discharged, and to
      satisfy him Mr. Hoad had produced figures, a
      profit-and-loss account that was incontestable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not a charity organization. The work's not there."
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn't. Psychologically the community--or that part of
      the community that provided employment--was in a negative
      mood. All expenditure was being postponed. Those who had
      bank balances were sitting on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad was both bitter and pathetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can I do? What can you do? Go on pushing and you'll
      have the whole social scheme on its back. Well, smash us.
      What good's that going to do your people? Oh, yes, I know,
      that's the idea in some quarters. Make business impossible
      for the employer and then oust him and take over. But just
      how much would there be to take over?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir saw the tragedy as Hoad saw it, but from a different
      angle. While the community was arguing and squabbling about
      an abstraction known as surplus value, the reality was
      drifting away. Everybody was so intent on squeezing a
      sponge that the limitations of a sponge appeared to be
      forgotten. Meanwhile necessity waited with a spear and a
      jar of hyssop.

      In the autumn conditions were so bad that Mr. Gott senior
      intervened, and since he had been proposing to build a
      series of six cottages for some of his employees, he
      decided that the occasion was propitious. Prices were down;
      Samson, Hoad &amp; Gott were a skeleton firm in more senses
      than one, and Mr. Gott had his land, a semi-derelict
      market-garden on the outskirts of Kingham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gott was a stout little man with a large head and a
      large face. In appearance he suggested Italy. His
      temperament was both shrewd and flamboyant, and his
      hard-headed optimism inflated its cheeks and blew upon the
      pessimistic Hoad. As for the slump in trade, he chose to
      regard it as a necessary and nasty emetic which a
      swollen-headed democracy would be compelled to swallow. A
      lot of raucous idealism and socialist rot! The community
      needed a purge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would say: "Yes, let 'em get into a thorough good mess.
      Bad trade! Well, what do you expect? Taking money from the
      guinea man and passing it to the twopenny man. There's no
      margin about the twopenny man. Yes, let's all go on strike.
      No wages for a couple of months. Everything in cold
      storage. They might begin to think a little and stop
      squinting down their silly noses. All this penal taxation,
      and squandermania on social bunk? What's the use of having
      a gramophone in the parlour if your larder contains three
      cold potatoes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gott was a good employer because goodwill is a business
      asset, but he had no illusions as to the angel in man. A
      slack sentimentalism encouraged the slacker. He preferred a
      red-capped communist to the Uriah Heeps of a saccharine
      socialism. You knew where you were with the complete
      pirate. "I want your cash. Pass it over." Yes, the Russian
      idea, the cult of the truculent young man. A corrupt and
      capable clique coercing the many. It was nothing so new,
      nothing to get excited about. If that very vain old man Mr.
      Shaw went to Russia and had his beard buttered, was one to
      regard it as part of a wonderful new dispensation? Mr. Gott
      had begun life as somebody's butler. He knew both Goodwood
      and Epsom. If society was founded upon economics, and the
      whole of finance rested upon credit, why credit mortal man
      with all sorts of immortal and transcendent qualities which
      he did not possess? It was just silly. You might get the
      sheep to follow you in imaginary Elysian fields, but what
      would happen when the mirage melted and your flock found
      itself pastured in the Sahara?
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was Mr. Gott's attitude towards industry, and it was
      the attitude of thousands of other Gotts, and though it
      placed itself on the right-hand side of the Via Media, it
      was perhaps a more practical posture than that of the
      gesturing gentlemen of the Left. He had invested "Eddie"
      and two thousand pounds in the firm of Samson, Hoad &amp;
      Gott, and when the shares fell, Mr. Gott thought it time to
      "average." The firm needed a contract to keep its men and
      its workshops in action, and Mr. Gott would possess six new
      cottages built at a very reasonable figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work began in October. Labourers were busy cutting
      foundation trenches in a soil that sustained the ghosts of
      innumerable cabbages. It was a dreary piece of ground,
      surrounded by the back gardens and yards of cottage
      property, that was not far removed from the purlieus of
      Paragon Place. It had a view of the Kingham gasworks, and
      when the wind was in a certain direction, it smelt of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's participation in the building of this row of
      cottages did not become out-of-door and active until
      December. He was kept busy in the shop working upon window
      and door frames and the skeletons of staircases, but by the
      middle of December No. 1 cottage was ready for the
      carpenters. Keir went straight from the comparative warmth
      of the shop to the raw cold and sizzling bleakness of a
      north-east wind. It was a particularly unpleasant December,
      and he had not been tempered to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up among the new timber he worked with a pull-over under
      his coat, and his collar turned up. His fingers felt as
      cold as the nails they had to handle. It was a depressing
      scene, grey sky, drab buildings, the bulk of the
      gasometers, the squdge of the derelict garden, all the
      debris that accumulates when building is in progress,
      puddles, mud, oozy heaps of clay, planks, messes of mortar.
      The rawness got at his bones. He seemed to be suspended in
      the sky for every northern draught to blow upon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were sulky and depressed. They had to stodge
      through much mud. The local wit christened the site
      "Wypers." Sometimes there would be two or three days of
      frost, and the bricklaying would be held up. To vary the
      program it rained. Keir went home with a wet jacket, which
      was hung to steam in front of the kitchen fire. He could
      not swear that it was a beautiful world, and that working
      on a roof in December symbolized the dignity and solace of
      labour. But there it was. Both Mr. Hoad and Mr. Gott were
      pushing the job. Costs had to be curtailed, and the men
      kept busy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil fed her man well. She even inculcated into Joanna
      Mary an appreciation of her father's importance as the
      mainspring of the domestic machine. Sybil did not question
      the values of marriage. She did not belong to the very
      young school that appears to regard marriage as the most
      disgusting and indecent of relationships and, while
      denouncing the fug and the sordidness of the double bed, is
      quite prepared to go to bed with any casual man who appears
      to be convincingly male.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hang up father's coat, Jo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo herself got into the way of feeling Keir's coat and
      insisting upon his shedding it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're wet, daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir would deliver up the sodden garment to Joanna, and the
      small creature would hang the coat over the back of a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sybil was worried about Keir. He came home looking
      drawn and tired, and there were times when he was
      irritable. It was as though those cottages in their sea of
      squelch filled him with nausea. Much of the timber was
      sodden and pinched the saw. Always you were working at a
      disadvantage, in the wind or the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you be on that job much longer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most of the winter, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I call it silly to build at this time of year."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir agreed as to the silliness of the business, but it was
      both business and necessity and Gott.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'd be stood off but for this job. It's the first decent
      contract the firm's had for six months."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you can't get on, can you, in the same way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a matter of fact, we do and we don't. A chap will slog
      in to get warm, but there's something in him that grows
      chilled. And old Gott's a pusher. He's round there most
      days stimulating us through Hoad."
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I might have been in the firm, strolling around in an
      overcoat watching other fellows work! Hoad's almost
      pathetic."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pathetic!" Sybil had no sympathy for Hoad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, he'd like to scream at the chaps, and he daren't. He
      just goes around nibbling at them. He's not the man for a
      tight occasion like old Sam would have been."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil found fault with Keir's waterproof. It was old, and
      it had ceased to be proof against the weather, and its
      collar was greasy and discoloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have a new waterproof, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't afford it, old girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got to afford it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil had a small hoard saved gradually from the
      housekeeping. It had been intended for emergencies and
      Christmas presents, and this was most certainly an
      emergency. She took Keir out shopping next Saturday evening
      and bought him a new mackintosh at an outfitter's in the
      High Street. Almost she treated Keir like a boy. She
      assured herself that the garment buttoned up properly round
      his throat and gave adequate protection to his knees. Some
      of the silly things had too few buttons and flapped open
      below in a wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made Keir turn round.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! It's quite a good fit on you. How about the sleeves?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just about right."
    </p>
    <p>
      She paid for the coat. It was done up in brown paper, and
      Keir carried it home.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      On the Tuesday before Christmas a snarling north-easter
      made work on the roofs of the cottages a bitter affair.
      Keir had two men with him and he brought them down and put
      them on the joists and struttings and floors of cottage No.
      1. They were more protected here, though the wind made the
      shell of brickwork cold and draughty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad turned up about ten, wearing a muffler and looking
      pinched and worried. He was annoyed when he saw no one at
      work on the roof. Old Gott had been rude to him the day
      before and had said quite plainly that Hoad could not
      manage his men. He, old Gott, had caught two of them
      smoking in the temporary shed that was used for cement and
      tools, and old Gott had exercised sarcasm. "I suppose you
      count that as skilled labour. Must be a pretty tough job
      smoking a pipe." Hoad minced through the mud, walking on
      his toes. He found Keir and the other carpenters at work
      inside cottage No. 1.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why aren't you up on the roof, Smith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was feeling cussed and in no mood to be snarled at.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've been up. The wind cuts your head off. I thought we'd
      get on better down here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoad had been dared to exercise authority, and he was
      angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Damn it, messing about where no one can see you. That roof
      has to be on by the New Year. Get on with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not safe to put the chaps up there. Your hands get so
      ---- cold that you can't hit a nail. I suggest you go up
      the ladder--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoad squealed. Nostrils and lips nibbled. The cold had
      pinched up his nose, and his glasses were perched awry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I gave you an order. That roof--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can give the order yourself, Mr. Hoad. I'll go up, but
      you can speak to the men."
    </p>
    <p>
      His attitude was aggressive. He gave Hoad a look that said:
      "Damn you, all right--I'll go. I'm up to it--but you--you
      miserable little bit of chewed string--you wouldn't stay up
      there five minutes." He took a hammer and a bag of nails
      and went aloft, leaving Hoad shivering and outraged. Hoad
      watched Keir's legs ascending the ladder. He was moved to
      shout at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. You'll be put off at the end of the week."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he did not give Keir notice, for one of the other men
      was in no better temper than Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not going up there today, gov'nor, and that's that.
      It's not safe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoad blinked at him and suddenly became suave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, perhaps you're right. You'll get on faster under
      cover. It is rather bleak today."
    </p>
    <p>
      The man spat. Bleak indeed! Why didn't the little ---- go
      up and freeze? And Mr. Hoad, with a conciliatory grin,
      called up to Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, Smith, carry on down here."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir was angry, and with an anger that was stubborn and
      recalcitrant. He remained on the roof. He would show Mr.
      Hoad that he was afraid neither of the wind nor of
      employers. He hammered nails as though he was hammering
      heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. I'm up. I'll carry on."
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained on the roof all the morning, and by one o'clock
      the north-east wind had blown the wilfulness out of him. He
      was chilled to the marrow; even his stomach felt cold. And
      suddenly he was scared. What a fool pride was this that let
      itself posture upon a roof on such a day, because a fellow
      like Hoad had spoken to him saucily! Supposing he had got
      himself badly chilled and had to lie up? As he came down
      the ladder, his hands hardly felt the rungs. His face
      looked harsh and blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cottage No. 2 the men had a fire burning in a brazier
      and were sitting around on planks. Keir joined them. One of
      the carpenters made room for him. A bricklayer's labourer
      was boiling water for tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look a bit tucked up, mate!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And no wonder. What did you go up there for, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he just got me cussed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went close to the brazier and bent over it. He felt
      that he wanted the heat of the fire in his cold belly and
      chest. His hands were numb, but hands did not matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little swine! Did you see the way he gingered it through
      the mud?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like a girl with her Saturday-nighters on. He's only
      fit for a draper's shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      The bricklayer's labourer was pouring out tea. He came to
      Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get your mug, mate. You look as though you wanted
      something hot inside you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir sat on one of the planks near the brazier and drank
      hot tea and ate the lunch Sybil had put up for him. A part
      of him was growing more and more attentive to the cold void
      in his belly. He waited for the hot tea and the food to
      warm him, but instead of warming him they aroused a kind of
      nausea. He began to shiver. He did not finish his meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the afternoon his stomach felt heavy as well as cold.
      His chilled vitals had refused to deal with the food, and
      about four o'clock he knocked off work and went home. He
      managed to reach the gate of "Merrow" before the growing
      nausea overcame him. He was helplessly and incontinently
      sick in the front garden.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir spent his Christmas in bed, and the soul of "Merrow"
      was harrowed and distraught. Sybil and Joanna Mary had
      transferred themselves to the spare room, and Joanna Mary
      spoke in whispers. Daddy was very ill, oh--terribly ill. If
      you listened outside his door, you heard a strange sound, a
      frightening sound, Keir's panting, avid breathing. He
      coughed, and between the coughs there were little groans.
      To Joanna it was a Christmas of strange terror, of hushed
      gloom, and of the comings and goings of the doctor and of a
      rather pert young woman in uniform. It seemed to Joanna
      that her mother's eyes grew as big as saucers, and Joanna's
      eyes matched her mother's. Mumsy was sitting up at night
      with daddy, and during the day her mother would lie down
      for a couple of hours on the bed in the spare room, and
      Joanna would keep very still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she surprised her mother in tears. Sybil was washing
      some crockery, and her weeping was silent. She dried cups
      and saucers and plates, and her eyes were wet. The small
      soul of Joanna was stricken. She stood and stared at her
      mother. Her chin began to quiver, and suddenly she caught
      hold of her mother's dress and pressed her forehead against
      Sybil's thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mumsy mustn't cry."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daddy's going to get well. I've asked God. So God will
      make daddy well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil dried her eyes with the first thing that came to
      hand, the glass-cloth. She bent down and kissed Joanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, daddy--must--get well."
    </p>
    <p>
      But for some days both doctor and nurse were doubtful as to
      the event, and it appeared more than probable that this
      might be Keir's last Christmas on earth. Neither the
      nursing nor the medical profession includes teleology in
      its textbook, and Joanna alone was in conjunction with God.
      Nevertheless Joanna and her transcendental friend proved
      themselves potent. Keir came safely through the crisis. He
      ceased to be smothered by his own juices. His breathing was
      stilled. For days he had been a bemused, burning
      abstraction, with a dry tongue and cracked lips, but
      half-conscious of the individual thing called Keir. Daily
      he had been aware of Sybil, and a thirst, and the spout of
      a feeding-cup, and his labouring chest and cracking head.
      Once more he was man, feeble, at the mercy of his pillows,
      but able to space out the rhythm of things and to think. He
      became aware of the radiant but haggard face of his wife.
      Strange combination! Her eyes were like tired ripe fruit
      about to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's been a near thing, kid, hasn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost she broke down, and caught herself, and put herself
      back upon the pedestal. She wanted to sleep. Her desire for
      sleep was overpowering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all right now, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes dwelt upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were here all the time, weren't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funny, you know, Syb, but one night when you were sitting
      there, you had two faces. Everything seemed double."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, and her laughter was the tingling of a tense
      wire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor's been awfully good, Keir. He says you may see
      Jo tonight."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's Jo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's been a perfect angel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, don't be silly. I just--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, old girl, what you want is ten hours' sleep. Go
      and get it. I'm all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, by the way, heard anything from Hoad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her tired face hardened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's never been near the place, Keir. He just sent a lad
      one day to ask--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir smiled strangely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Little swine!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sybil was able to tell him that several of the men had
      been to inquire, and so had young Mr. Gott. Yes, people had
      been extraordinarily kind. Mrs. Brown had offered to come
      in and do the cooking for her, or to take charge of Joanna
      Mary. The world was not a bad world, and if Mr. Samson had
      been alive, matters would have been very different.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir made a little restless movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you seen about drawing my insurance money?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No, she hadn't. The finances of "Merrow" had been left in
      abeyance. Their credit was good, and she had run up bills.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'll see about it, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you want any ready cash, I've three pounds in a tin
      behind the books. Top shelf."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I can manage, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put out a hand, a rather tremulous hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been wonderful, Syb. I'll be at work again in a
      week or two."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly a month passed before Keir returned to work.
      Meanwhile "Merrow" had to exist upon Keir's sick benefit
      and upon his savings, and at the end of this period the
      savings were <i>non est.</i> Dr. Gibson had told Sybil to
      feed her man well, and Sybil gave Keir meat twice a day and
      a glass of hot milk in the middle of the morning. The
      financial problem would right itself when Keir went back to
      work, though Keir knew from experience that in Mr. Samson's
      day the business might have been handled very differently.
      In the case of a valuable employee it had been Mr. Samson's
      custom to pay during sickness full wages for a month. He
      had said that it was worth it even from a business point of
      view. It gave the workman a sense of security, made him
      feel that he was something more than a mere "hand"; it
      inspired goodwill, and increased output.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Thursday before the Monday when he resumed work,
      Keir walked into Mr. Hoad's office. They had not met since
      the morning when Hoad had lost his temper and Keir had
      carried his up to cool on the roof. Hoad happened to be
      alone in the office. He looked over the tops of his
      pince-nez at Keir. If he had any reason for discomfort, he
      carried it with a veneer of geniality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morning, Smith. Glad to see you about again."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was exchanging no compliments with Mr. Hoad. The
      collar of his black overcoat was turned up to his chin, and
      it emphasized his pallor. He had not removed his hat. There
      was a kind of dark dignity about him, the austerity of a
      man who had been ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose the job's open?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, Smith, of course. Glad to have you back. How
      are you feeling about work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can start on Monday."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good. You had better have a week or two in the shop. There
      are some joinery jobs in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right. I'll clock in on Monday."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all that passed between them, though Keir had
      travelled to the edge of the dark waters and returned from
      them, and Mr. Hoad was supposed to be a religious man. He
      did not like Keir, and he had behaved rather ungenerously
      to Keir, which made him like Keir all the less. Keir was so
      suggestive of the Samson days and of the firm's heroic
      period, and the present was proving itself exceedingly
      prosaic. The press and the prophets were preaching economy,
      and the public were denying themselves both interior and
      exterior decorations. The world's front door would last
      another year, but the firm of Samson, Hoad &amp; Gott might
      not survive twelve more such months. It could not afford to
      be sentimental or to indulge in magnanimous gestures. "And
      after all," as Mr. Hoad reflected, "I have been considerate
      to the fellow. I have put him under cover for two or three
      weeks."
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday Keir went back to work, and though he had been
      walking five or six miles a day to get himself fit, he
      found that first day in the shop a trying business. He was
      flabby. The place was stuffy and hot. There seemed to be no
      air in it. He found himself sweating. His muscles had lost
      their tone, and after an hour's work he felt that his back
      and legs had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, the atmosphere was charged with fine dust, and
      presently he began to cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's have the door open, Fred. There's no air in here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred opened the door and looked at the back of Keir's neck.
      It was very thin, like the neck of a man who had been
      starved.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're not quite up to it yet, mate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "First day--I suppose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's it. When I came back after my operation, I felt
      like a bit of jelly. Lord--by one o'clock I was all
      swimmy."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir continued to cough, and the irritation that caused
      the cough seemed to rouse in him other fretfulness. The
      place was full of sawdust. The men had not been so thorough
      with the broom during his absence, and with sudden
      petulance he got hold of the broom and began to sweep the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't cleared up the place."
    </p>
    <p>
      His interference made matters worse. The sawdust, disturbed
      by the broom, distributed its finer particles through the
      air and aggravated Keir's cough. He had to go into the yard
      to escape from the dust. He walked up and down in this
      cleaner air, and Mr. Hoad, coming out of the office, found
      Keir taking what appeared to be a morning breather. Hoad
      did not remark upon it, but his meagre little face was not
      friendly. This might be Keir's first working day after his
      illness, but was it necessary for him to stroll about the
      yard when there was a warm shop to work in and other men
      who needed supervising?
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir returned to the shop. The dust had settled, and his
      cough did not trouble him again that morning, but in the
      afternoon he was attacked by a spasm of coughing. There
      might have been hot sand in his windpipe, and again he had
      to go out into the fresh air. He felt acutely depressed and
      worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other men exchanged comments.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's the dust."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you can't expect anything else, can you, in a shop
      like this? He'd be better out of doors."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of the week Keir came to the same conclusion.
      The dust in the shop continued to irritate his chest. To
      begin with, the cough had been a dry one, but in a few days
      expectoration was coming up into his throat. He swallowed
      the stuff. He could not spit in the shop, and by going to
      the door to spit he would make the other chaps think him
      fussy. He was worried. Already he was exercising
      concealment, not only before his fellow workmen and his
      wife; he was pretending to his secret self that the thing
      was not serious. It would pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was troubled about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're still coughing, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just a bit. The dust in the shop sets me off. I'm
      going to ask Hoad to let me be outside for a month. He can
      put me on the cottages."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not eager to ask a favor of Mr. Hoad, but knowing
      how utterly vital a working man's health is to him and to
      those dependent on him, he muzzled his pride and asked to
      be put back on the cottages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoad looked surprised and slightly suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought you would be better indoors."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's the dust. I'm quite fit to take charge again
      at the cottages."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad was searching for some ulterior motive. Worry had
      turned him into a creature of universal and furtive
      distrust. Was Keir suggesting that the firm's workshops
      were unhygienic? They were the same as they had been in Mr.
      Samson's day. Or was this the beginning of other official
      interference, a hint that would develop into a demand for a
      dust-exhausting plant? Absurd and profitless expense at a
      moment when times were so critical.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought it best to humour Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right. Get back on the cottages."
    </p>
    <p>
      He observed Keir as he went out of the office. Yes, the
      fellow looked drawn and delicate, and sickly employees were
      an embarrassment. Keir and his temperament had always
      harassed Mr. Hoad. He preferred workmen who were more
      stolid and eupeptic.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But though Keir went on out-door work, his cough remained
      with him. To begin with, he tried to smother it and to
      ignore it, or to assure himself that it was one of the
      after-effects of his illness, and that when the warm
      weather came, it would leave him. It was just a winter
      cough, and dozens of working men suffered from it. You had
      only to look at the pavements on a raw morning and notice
      those disgusting grey-green blobs of sputum.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir was afraid of his cough. He became more and more
      convinced that the trouble was not a mere affair of the
      throat or larynx, but that it was deep within him. He
      noticed that he was short of breath when riding his bicycle
      up a hill or climbing a ladder. He had no pain in his
      chest, nothing but a sense of uneasiness, as though some
      vague and malign thing had settled there and was devouring
      him. The expectoration continued, and sometimes he would go
      into the lavatory and peer down at the stuff he had spat
      into the pan. It looked like glutinous wads of dirty
      cotton-wool.
    </p>
    <p>
      At night he would be disturbed by the cough. He would try
      to fight it back so as not to disturb his wife, but the
      thing refused to be suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must go and see Dr. Gibson, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing to worry about. It will clear up all right
      when the spring comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      His appetite grew squeamish. He found himself flushing
      after meals, and there was a sense of weight under his
      ribs. He was conscious of the beating of his heart. In fact
      he was becoming abnormally conscious of himself as a body
      that was strangely and disturbingly out of health. Almost,
      he listened at the door of his physical self as though
      dreading to hear some new and frightening disharmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      His working day became oppressed by an increasing
      lassitude. He tried to whip himself up to the job, only to
      find that the old verve was not in him. He tired so
      quickly, and towards the end of the day he would be
      dragging himself about those cottages like a very old man.
      He was pursued by a dread that refused to be disregarded.
      It followed him to work in the morning; it went home to bed
      with him at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would say to himself: "It can't be right that I should
      feel like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went home exhausted. It was as much as he could do to
      put his bicycle away in the shed. He was sensitive and
      touchy about himself. He would carry into the cottage a
      face that was both haggard and falsely cheerful, and sit
      down in one of the arm-chairs and try to be playful with
      Joanna Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one evening when he surprised his wife looking at
      his reflection in the mirror over the mantelpiece. He knew
      that she was looking at him. It was as though she had a
      secret of her own or had discovered his secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter, Syb? What are you staring at?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      But a moment later he caught her looking at him in the same
      strange way, and her eyes seemed to express his own secret
      fear. He saw her flinch. His face had betrayed resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter? Anything funny about me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She went to the cupboard to take out the tea-things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't get so tired, Keir, should you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't I sit in a chair for five minutes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, dear, if you want to."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir kept up the semblance of health for a few more days,
      and then one night he woke up in a furious heat. He was
      sweating. The perspiration was soaking his pyjamas and the
      sheets, and associated with this physical distress was a
      sense of impending disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt his wife's hand touching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, you're all wet. You're soaked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I woke up like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was out of bed and at the light. She opened a drawer
      and found a clean pair of pyjamas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must change them. You'll get chilled. And, oh, Keir,
      you must go and see Dr. Gibson tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      He struggled out of the wet sleeping-suit. He had begun to
      shiver.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, kid. I will."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      It happened to be one of those rare and halcyon days in
      spring when Keir went to see his doctor. Dr. Gibson lived
      in Church Street in a Queen Anne house whose red brick was
      the colour of a softly tinted autumn leaf. On a green gate
      a brass plate bore the words: "Surgery. Hours: 9-10, 6-7."
      A bricked path led to the surgery door, and at the end of a
      path a very old plum tree was in flower. Keir could not
      help noticing this mass of white blossom, and its beauty
      and its significance caused him a sudden spasm of pain. The
      sky was very blue above the flowering branches, and
      somewhere a blackbird was singing, and the voice of the
      bird was like the voice of his own lost, passionate youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the surgery bell. A maid opened the door. She
      looked old and faded and sad, and so unlike that tree. She
      showed Keir into the waiting-room. There were five other
      people sitting silently on kitchen chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were strangers to Keir, and he had to wait for some
      forty minutes before his turn arrived. The waiting-room had
      one big window looking upon a back yard and the doors of a
      stable, and in the yard a chauffeur was washing a car. The
      man had a thick, red neck, and muscular forearms, and Keir
      sat and watched him and envied him his health and his
      strength. Two women were bending towards each other and
      talking in whispers, and though he was aware of their
      voices, he paid no attention to what they said. The walls
      of the room had been distempered a pale green, and the
      colour seemed to tint the faces of the waiting patients.
      One of the men appeared to have trouble with his breathing,
      and every now and again he would draw in a deep breath and
      let it out with a long sigh. There was infinite melancholy
      in this sound of distressful deflation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir looked at his watch. Four of the other patients had
      come and gone, and the man who sighed was with the doctor.
      Keir felt his suspense like a length of tightly coiled wire
      in his belly. He got up and walked round the room. He stood
      at the window and watched the chauffeur polishing the
      radiator of the car. The man had the stump of a cigarette
      stuck between his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breathless patient came out of the consulting-room. He
      did not look at Keir, but took his hat from a peg and went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir heard the doctor's voice, and with a curious jerk of
      the head as though the summons had startled him, he passed
      through into the inner room. Dr. Gibson was sitting at a
      desk jotting down some details in a case-book. Keir had
      closed the door and was sitting down in the patient's chair
      before the doctor turned his eyes on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What--you--Smith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hoped I had settled you, my lad. What's the trouble?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! How long have you had it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It came on when I went back to work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was aware of the doctor observing him intently. Dr.
      Gibson's eyes were pale blue and they seemed to stare, but
      their stare was intelligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's have your wrist."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's heart began to beat hard and fast while the doctor
      was feeling his pulse. He felt curiously tense and
      breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any expectoration?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's it like?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "White, woolly stuff, sir. And last night--I woke up wet
      through."
    </p>
    <p>
      The quality of the doctor's stare seemed to change. It was
      as though he divined this other man's distress and, in
      divining it, discovered pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you lost weight, Smith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know, sir. I think I'm thinner. I can't manage the
      work as I did."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Gibson pushed back his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Right. I'll have a look at you. Yes, I want you stripped
      to the waist. Put that blanket over you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir removed coat and vest, collar, tie, and shirt and
      fastened his braces round his middle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come and sit by the window. That's it. Now, breathe."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's chest rose and fell. He looked at the window, whose
      lower panes were filled with frosted glass. His eyes were
      anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any pain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Gibson began to palpate and percuss his chest, and the
      touch of the doctor's hands had a peculiar and soothing
      effect upon him. He raised his head higher. He looked
      through the unfrosted upper panes of the window and saw
      blue sky and the edge of a white cloud. His heart had
      ceased to beat so loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Gibson reached for the stethoscope on his desk. He
      listened to Keir's breathing, and his face came close to
      Keir's, and Keir's eyes remained fixed on the edge of the
      white cloud. He was conscious of a quickening of his
      suspense. The doctor kept moving the mouth of the
      instrument from one place to another, but presently his
      attention seemed to concentrate itself on a point a little
      below Keir's right collar-bone. And something in Keir began
      to tremble. He was sure that the doctor had discovered a
      whisper of doom, some crepitant confession of fate under
      that patch of skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take a deep breath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir breathed deeply, and Gibson's intent and listening
      face seemed the face of his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now cough, and draw a deep breath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was trying not to tremble, for suddenly he had felt
      cold. The examination was over, and the doctor had passed
      behind Keir's chair. He sat down at his desk, and there was
      silence while he made a note in his case-book. To Keir the
      silence was like the holding of breath under water while
      the whole of your body craved desperately for air. If there
      was anything wrong, why didn't Gibson tell him?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can dress, Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir struggled into his shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall want a specimen of your sputum. I'll give you a
      bottle to spit into."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir stood buttoning his shirt, and his fingers fumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there anything in my chest, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gibson looked him straight in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes; I'm afraid there is."
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly Keir understood. The shadow that had been
      pursuing him became a reality, a solid and menacing
      presence standing close to him in the room. He fastened his
      braces and put on his collar and tie. He felt cold, and his
      throat stiffened with a kind of anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may as well tell me the truth, doctor. I've got to
      face it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gibson answered him very gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm afraid it's phthisis, Smith. When your sputum has been
      examined and reported on, I shall--Hold up, man. Sit down.
      Put your head between your knees."
    </p>
    <p>
      For Keir's world had gone black. He clutched at the chair
      and sat down in it. He felt the doctor's hands pressing his
      head between his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, sir. Just a bit faint."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stay like that, Smith. I'll get you something to drink."
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute later Keir was sitting upright in the chair, and
      holding a medicine glass in his hand. His face was ghastly,
      but he managed to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Better now, sir. I'll take my medicine--I suppose there's
      some hope?--You see--I've got a wife and kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor took the empty glass from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know, Smith. It's an early case. There is always hope
      for an early case. Just sit there for a while, my lad.
      There's no hurry."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir managed to walk back to "Merrow." He saw the little
      white house and the big beech tree against the tranquil
      blue of the evening sky, and here too a blackbird was
      singing. A gate, a path, that familiar green door, and yet
      Keir's small world had become strangely unreal. Both his
      hands and his belly felt cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil had been waiting, and watching for him through the
      window. She would not let herself hurry or allow that the
      occasion contained any element of distress. Keir had walked
      home, and if a man could walk nearly two miles at the end
      of a day's work, nothing very serious could be the matter.
      She went to the front door, opened it, and stood to meet
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when she saw his face and particularly his eyes, her
      hope and her courage seemed to cling together for comfort.
      He smiled at her as a man smiles to cover up some deathly
      pain. Almost his eyes appealed to her like the eyes of some
      shamefully wounded creature. He was beyond mere self-pity.
      It was as though he came humbly to this comrade, conscious
      of himself as a creature of bankruptcy and disaster, the
      bread-winner who was broken. Almost he seemed to fear
      secret reproaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      She winced. She seemed to press her hands to her courage as
      she might have pressed them to her breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've been, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      How futile the question sounded! Again he smiled at her,
      that wounded, defensive smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Not very good news, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw a shocked fear possess her face. It passed, just as
      though she had put up a hand and brushed it away. Her eyes
      grew deep and tender.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She put an arm round him. They stood in the little passage,
      just inside the door, and suddenly he hid his face in her
      bosom. His hands rested on her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kid--I'm sorry. You won't be angry with me, Syb?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She trembled. She folded her arms over his head and pressed
      it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir! My dear, tell me--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke down. He spoke brokenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my chest.--You oughtn't to have married me. I'm no
      more good."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was both agonized and exalted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, my dear, don't--You mustn't--say--I married you
      because I loved you, and I'm loving you--Oh, my dear!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he began to cough, and in the thick of the
      spasm he threw his head back and to one side and thrust her
      off. His face looked all twisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keep away, Syb. Mustn't cough in your face. I've got death
      in me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood back against the wall, her shoulders pressing
      against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not afraid--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was leaning against the opposite wall, his face averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The doctor says we mustn't sleep together. It's like that,
      Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then they looked at each other across the passage and
      were silent, for there was a sound of some small mechanism
      being trundled along the garden path. Joanna Mary was the
      possessor of a toy wheelbarrow in which she collected
      stones and weeds, and Jo had been busy in the back garden.
      Sybil's eyes questioned Keir's. He nodded. He had ceased to
      cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, mother. She needn't--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna and her barrow appeared. She stood there looking in
      at her mother and father. She wished her labours to be
      appreciated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got all these stones, daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir played up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So you have. What's the idea?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That nasty hole in the path where the water gets."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going to fill it up?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's splendid."
    </p>
    <p>
      She trundled her barrow on up the path, and Keir, feeling
      that her intervention had somehow restored him to a sense
      of reality, followed her along the path and watched her
      empty her load into the pot-hole. Her sturdy legs straddled
      the occasion, and he, with a little whimsical smile, spread
      the stones with his foot and trod them in.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We could do with another load, Jo."
    </p>
    <p>
      She regarded her handiwork with stubborn solemnity. She had
      expected the load to fill up the cavity, and it hadn't.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must find more stones, daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, you'll have to."
    </p>
    <p>
      She set off for the back garden with her barrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went into the house and sat down by the fire. He could
      hear Sybil busy in the spare bedroom, and presently she
      came in with sheets and blankets and hung them to air
      before the fire. Keir drew his chair aside so that there
      was room for the bed-clothes. He felt much more calm and
      sure of himself now, and a little ashamed of the scene in
      the passage. There could be too much anguish in such
      emotion; both of them had been rent by it, and both of them
      were glad of each other's calmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil stood by one of the chairs on which she had hung the
      clothes. Her right hand lay along her cheek. Once more she
      was the solid little mother of the house confronting feral
      fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did Dr. Gibson say--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's eyes remained fixed on the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is having my sputum examined. That's the proof of the
      pudding. But I think he is pretty sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You won't be able to go to work. Of course--you mustn't go
      to work. Will they send you somewhere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sanatorium. I've got a good chance--he thinks--but
      that's not what's worrying me, Syb. You and Jo have got to
      live."
    </p>
    <p>
      She moved to his side and laid a hand gently on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just what you mustn't do, Keir, worry. We'll manage
      somehow. Other people have to manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      The window was open, and from the path between gate and
      house came the sound of Joanna's small barrow, and the
      rattle of stones as she emptied her second load on to the
      path.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The bacteriological examination of Keir's sputum proved
      positive. The bacillus of tubercle showed under the
      microscope as little rods stained red; but when Dr. Gibson
      broke the news to Keir, Keir took it calmly. He had not
      expected a reprieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat holding his hat. His eyes seemed to be looking into
      the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's to be done about it, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Gibson told him that he must go into a sanatorium, one
      of the County Council sanatoriums, and as soon as possible.
      Unfortunately the accommodation was inadequate, and there
      was always a waiting list, but he would try to get Keir
      into "Pinehill" at the earliest possible date. Meanwhile
      Keir must live in the air, sleep with his window open, take
      as much good and simple food as he could eat, and prepare
      to fight the disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your own body has to do it, Smith. It's a battle between
      your own tissues and the bug. It may sound a rotten thing
      to say, but try to keep cheerful."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir twiddled his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't I do a little light work, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've got to live. One's insurance money won't keep three
      people. Then--I have a mortgage on my house."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's pretty hard on you. Why not ask the mortgagees to
      grant you a moratorium? If they are decent people, they
      might be willing to do without their interest for a year."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a building society."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, try them. Even a society may have a conscience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long will it be before the sanatorium can take me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might be six months. I'll do all I can to get you in
      earlier."
    </p>
    <p>
      To Keir it seemed a rather hopeless business, but the
      doctor had urged upon him the essential sanity of hope. He
      must fight, and he was ready to fight, for he had others to
      fight for. He went back to "Merrow" and, looking into the
      eyes of his wife, told her the whole truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's up to us, Syb. We're both alone in the world. We have
      no one to help us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was strangely calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much money shall we have?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifteen shillings or so a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was sitting at the table and she tapped it with the
      fingers of one hand as though it was a calculating machine.
      Fifteen shillings, and food and coal, and rates and clothes
      and cleaning materials, and the interest on the mortgage!
      Her eyebrows drew closer together. She confronted her
      crisis, and not for herself alone, but for the three of
      them. Like many working women she was capable of supreme
      courage and self-negation in the presence of such a
      tragedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      She said: "I shall have to do something, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was watching her anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do something?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, work. I can get housework at seven and sixpence a
      day. Say five days a week; that's nearly forty shillings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, and carry on here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, lots of women do it. I'm strong. I've got a bike. If
      you have to stay at home, Keir, you can look after Jo."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was touched to the quick. He looked on the edge of
      breaking down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Syb--you're--well, what can I say? You're more to me
      now--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed and caught her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--I don't mind what I do. I don't really. I just
      want you to get well."
    </p>
    <p>
      A few tears showed, but they were tears of compassion and
      of courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We might let the house, but I couldn't bear it. I love
      every bit of it, Keir. A woman does, you know, when she's
      made that way. Besides, where should we go? And you've got
      the garden here, and even when you go to the sanatorium, I
      can manage."
    </p>
    <p>
      He got up and, bending, kissed the top of his wife's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a marvel, Syb. I did the best thing I ever did when
      I married you. But perhaps, my dear, it wasn't the best for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught one of his hands and held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, it was, Keir, it was--it was. I've been so
      happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew a moment of shame, for he was thinking of the
      Challis woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got a heart in you, Syb. That's better than being
      just clever. My dear, you're worth two of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, Keir, I'm not."
    </p>
    <p>
      So "Merrow" prepared itself to stand a siege, and the
      weather was kind to Keir, for this particular spring proved
      to be quite un-English in the hours of sunlight that it
      gave to the home counties. Keir had a long chair in the
      garden, and under instructions from his doctor he indulged
      in sun bathing. He had been running a temperature at night,
      but after two or three weeks' rest and fresh air his
      temperature fell, and his cough and expectoration became
      less troublesome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil mounted her bicycle and rode off to call on Mrs.
      Lugard of Darvels. The Lugards had been in Spain, but were
      back in England, and Mrs. Lugard, one of those big, fair,
      out-of-doors women who always had to have a dog near her,
      had often been kind to Sybil. She had been sorry to lose
      the girl, and when Sybil poured out her troubles and
      explained her needs, Mary Lugard was able and ready to help
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can you manage double work, and heavy work, my dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, yes, Sybil could manage it, and would Mrs. Lugard
      recommend her to her friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You want five days a week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if I can get them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I'll take you for two. I have had nothing but
      trouble since you and Parsons left me. Cook is still with
      us. I am giving a help seven and six and her food. Will
      that do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. And thank you."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no lack of employment in Kingham for such a woman
      as Sybil, and within a week Mrs. Lugard had found her work
      for the three other days. She recommended her to friends
      and explained both Sybil's courage and her need.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's a good girl and a plucky one."
    </p>
    <p>
      These ladies treated Sybil very kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna was the one person to whom the new régime seemed
      strange.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why isn't daddy going to work, mummy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daddy's not well, dear. The doctor has told him to rest.
      You must not worry daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna looked affronted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--I shan't worry daddy"--and she didn't. She was
      a child of early ripeness in the matter of understanding, a
      little creature of curious and sensitive sagacity. When
      Keir slept after lunch in a chair in the garden, she either
      held aloof or remained the little quietist. She did not
      challenge her father to play games with her. If he walked
      in the garden, she too walked like a sympathetic spirit,
      holding his hand. She even indulged in some elementary
      gardening of her own. She filled her barrow with weeds,
      though Keir had sometimes to tell her which were weeds and
      which were plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost, his job became the woman's job. He made his own bed
      and did light work about the house. When Sybil came home,
      she would find everything washed up, the kettle boiling,
      and the table laid for supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir did a good deal of reading. Mr. Lugard came to see him
      and brought him books.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever read any of the new school, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, here is a selection. I should like your views on the
      stuff--as a working man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir read a number of contemporary novels, and the
      impression he got from them was one of excessive
      dreariness. He gathered that marriage was the most indecent
      and disgusting of all relationships, that all husbands had
      fat hands and slimy voices and sinned in secret. Young
      Intelligentsia had gone back to nakedness and nature. It
      met its desire casually in the street and went off at once
      to satisfy it behind a hedge. Even the hedge might be
      considered an insult to nature, a sort of false Victorian
      figment. As for the making of money, it was a base function
      relegated to dull and foolish and obfuscated persons called
      fathers. You despised them, and your scorn allowed you to
      sponge on the old gentlemen. You analysed the universe and
      your small self with a kind of cold, facetious glee. You
      confessed everything, even the state of your toe-nails. You
      were an expert in the inspecting of latrines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard had little humorous wrinkles round his eyes. The
      new cleverness amused him. It out-butchered the butcher.
      And when he sat with Keir in Keir's garden he listened to
      what Keir had to say, and in the main he agreed with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like a lot of naughty children showing off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--I think that describes it. Universal exhibitionism,
      revolt and ruin in the nursery. These young things do take
      their breeches down, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir laughed. He was able to laugh that spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it's amusing to begin with, sir, but surely one
      gets tired of going about with the tail of one's shirt
      hanging out. Besides, there's something to be said for
      braces and buttons."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. That's what we old fusters think. A universal
      looseness parading as freedom isn't quite convincing. And
      they are so depressing, these bright young things. They
      know everything and nothing. They are so old and withered."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir said: "Isn't it just the pose of a clique? What
      strikes me about the people who write these books is that
      they know so little about the real people, people like us.
      Most of the world has work to do, and that keeps
      it--rational. We haven't time to trouble about being
      clever."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had other visitors, Mr. Sparks among them, a Mr.
      Sparks who left his platform manner outside Keir's gate,
      but who could not refrain from agitating. What were the
      doctors doing? As for the lack of accommodation in the
      sanatorium--it was a social scandal. But of course when the
      Socialist Party obtained a clear majority, it would remedy
      the omissions of the rich. It would be the privilege of
      property to pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir found Ted Sparks rather tiring. He was so profligately
      positive in spite of gluts and trade depression and the
      necessities of man's human nature. He lacked sense of
      proportion. He paraded all the stock phrases as though they
      were performing mice, and Keir, during those weeks of
      idleness, was busy feeling and thinking. He had begun to
      understand that right feeling might be more important than
      a lot of soft and pulpy cerebrating. Life was both relative
      and unexpected. It was neither a cabbage patch nor a card
      index. He was seeing life more as a flux, a trammel of
      tendencies, and not as a rigid system in which social man
      was listed and pigeonholed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad he saw not at all, though Mr. Hoad did send his
      clerk to express sympathy and to discover whether Keir
      could be regarded as a more or less permanent absentee.
      When Sybil heard of the incident, she gathered up her
      indignation and went to interview the firm's chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose, when my husband is cured his place will be open
      to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sparks had tackled Mr. Hoad on that very question, and
      Mr. Hoad was ready to promise anything for which he could
      not be immediately called to account.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, certainly, Mrs. Smith. If your husband is discharged
      from the sanatorium in good health, we shall hope to see
      him back here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The prevarication was there, ready for use if necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil carried the news back to Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've seen Mr. Hoad. He promised that your place should be
      kept open."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir smiled at her gently, for Sybil was still very
      unsophisticated in her faith in the world of Hoad.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir's chief concern was his wife. In a sense he and
      Sybil were physically sundered from each other, and
      yet--both spiritually and emotionally--they were nearer
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was up at six in the morning, and she gave him a hot
      breakfast before she went off to her work, and she came
      back tired and with the bleached look of a woman who had
      lost blood. Keir noticed that her hands were redder and
      rougher, but her sweet temper did not appear to suffer. He
      made a point of having supper ready for her. He was
      teaching himself to cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterwards, when they had washed up, he made her sit down
      and put her feet up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He read the paper to her, but too much reading and talking
      made him cough, and he was obliged to resort to the thing
      he loathed--his sputum flask. Always he felt surreptitious
      when using it. He would go out of doors or to his bedroom,
      and yet Sybil, because she loved him, saw nothing loathsome
      in that bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I met Dr. Gibson today, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Any news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He thinks you will get your notice next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them were dreading his sojourn at "Pinehill." They
      had become so very necessary to each other since Keir's
      illness, but they spoke brightly to each other of
      "Pinehill." It was a house of hope, and Sybil, with her
      sanguine nature, would not admit defeat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall be able to manage all right, Keir. Mrs. Brown is
      going to take Jo while I'm at work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be a bit lonely for you, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There will be the visiting-days. I'll bring Jo with me.
      You know--I do feel, Keir, that you are going to get quite
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her with deep and serious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want to get well. I've good reasons. Some men haven't,
      and that's a pity."

    <p>
      Keir received an official notice to report at "Pinehill."
      Meanwhile, the building society had refused to postpone the
      payment of interest on his mortgage, and Keir could not
      blame them. They might advertise themselves as dispensers
      of social service, but the financial system of such a
      concern could not be expected to adapt itself to the minor
      fluctuations of individual misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's rather rough on you, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, you're not to worry."
    </p>
    <p>
      She packed his suitcase for him, one of the suitcases that
      had gone with them on that almost mythical holiday to
      Ramsgate. She saw that his poor pyjamas were in order, and
      his shirts as they should be. She shed a few tears over
      that packing. She was taking a day off and going to
      "Pinehill," rather like a young mother taking her boy to
      school. The Lugards were lending them their car for the
      afternoon, and in the car Keir found a parcel of books with
      a little note from Mr. Lugard. "No hurry for the return of
      these, Keir. The very best of luck to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna Mary was to be left at the Browns'. They dropped her
      there from the car, and Keir got out and led his small
      daughter in by the hand. He did not kiss her good-bye, but
      bent down and held her face between his hands and looked
      long and intently at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be good to mother, Jo."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna's face puckered up, and Mrs. Brown, who had some
      understanding of the human emotions, infantile and
      otherwise, picked Joanna up and carried her inside. She let
      Joanna Mary have her howl and, sitting on the sofa with the
      child, comforted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna, wounded in her small soul, asked Mrs. Brown a
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why didn't daddy kiss me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Brown, being a mother, knew how poignant and posing
      the questions of a child can be, and that sometimes it is
      best to tell the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your daddy's not well, dear. He was afraid to kiss you
      because--it might make you not well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll come back soon, Mrs. Brown, won't he, and quite
      well?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil and Keir held hands in the car. It was high summer, a
      day of alternate sunlight and shadow, and to Keir, England
      had never looked more beautiful, and in this beauty Sybil
      shared. She sat close to her husband, her hand holding his
      with confident and consoling firmness. She might not be the
      Sybil of their earlier days, the mere bloom of her youth
      had passed; she was stouter and more solid, and her face
      was the face of a woman who worked. Her hands, too, were
      those of a working woman, and today she was wearing cotton
      gloves. But there were other beauties, an essential and
      succouring sameness, the magnanimous mood of her maturity,
      compassion, courage, a touching and wise simplicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed over heathlands and through pinewoods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it lovely, Keir? 'Pinehill' is like this, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her feeling was that no one--especially Keir--could die in
      such country, and perhaps he divined her feeling and
      answered it intuitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, I'll get well in country like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      She pressed her arm against his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so glad you married me, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt a little choking in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear--I've had the luck."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and absorbed her and her significance. What was the
      matter with marriage if marriage could be like this? What
      did those raw and rancorous young high-brows know of the
      lives of the obscure and the simple? Superior people,
      supercilious people! Chuck away all compassion and loyalty
      and self-restraint and let raw sex be let loose like a
      young wench in gaudy pyjamas! As if this other comradeship
      could not transcend sex! And yet--! Oh, yes, he had been
      one of the restless fools. He had come very near to
      throwing his most precious possession into the flesh-pot.
      What would Mrs. Challis have done with a consumptive
      husband? Packed him up in a bandbox and sent him to hell?
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt the pressure of his wife's arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, that must be it. The big red building on the hill."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a poignant note in her voice. It was as though
      the red building on the hill was a mausoleum for the
      living. She was to leave Keir there and go back alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it looks like it. All pinewoods."
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he put an arm round her and held her close.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry, Syb. I'll get well all right I've got to get
      well."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Of Keir's six months at "Pinehill" no full record need be
      rendered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was his first experience of communal life as it may be
      lived in such an institution. He was put to bed and kept
      there for a while, and his bed spent most of its days in a
      kind of sunny glasshouse like a big veranda. The doctors
      presented him with an artificial pneumothorax, which in
      common parlance means that his right lung periodically was
      deflated and made to rest. To begin with he had some
      trouble with his food, and his diet had to be adjusted, but
      at the end of the first month he was putting on weight and
      he had ceased to cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were twenty other beds in his particular department,
      and twenty other personalities to be explored and suffered.
      Keir, as a separatist, did not take too easily to life in
      public, a perpetual proximity to people from whom it was
      impossible to escape. He felt rather like a beast in a
      stall and quite unprotected from other beasts' ruminatings
      and restlessnesses, but as the days passed, he became more
      accustomed to all this publicity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He discovered the virtues of acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accepted his neighbours, old Mr. Burk with the beard,
      who sucked his teeth and persisted in reading aloud from
      the daily paper, and whose profile was that of a goat. He
      found it more easy to accept the boy on his right, who
      seemed to lie in one long blue-eyed dream, and who smiled
      vaguely whenever anyone spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He accepted the doctors and the nurses and his diet, and
      the various human noises at night. He realized that if you
      fretted life, life fretted you in return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, if he hung on a cross, all those others hung on
      crosses with him, and in a little while he discovered the
      courage of those who were crucified. It was a patient and
      sometimes a cheerful community. "Pinehill" did not
      encourage long faces. It could be very much alive in that
      anteroom which opened both ways, to the world of the living
      and the world of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the visiting-days when he looked into the eyes
      of his wife, and Joanna sat on his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do they keep you in bed, daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because I've been naughty, young woman. But next week I'm
      going to be good."
    </p>
    <p>
      His first glance at his wife would be one of anxious
      affection. How was she bearing the strain? Was she
      overworking? His grip of her hand was comradely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are things, Syb?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm managing splendidly. Do I look ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She didn't, and his eyes dwelt on her dearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a marvel. They are letting me get up next week.
      I've put on eight pounds."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked flushed and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I've brought you some more books, Keir, from Mr.
      Lugard. He let us have the car. People couldn't be kinder."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled up at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same here."
    </p>
    <p>
      His promotion from being a patient was in every sense a
      kind of resurrection. He left his bed and walked, and
      walking had never seemed more wonderful. He could potter
      out into the "Pinehill" garden and sit in the sun and read.
      But he had not quite the same desire to read. Life itself
      was a book, reopened and recovered, and his eyes saw the
      world and its beauty as though they had been re-created for
      him. The gardens of "Pinehill" were extensive and well
      kept. He liked to go into the vegetable garden, where men
      were at work, and into the orchard. The fruits of the
      earth! Work! In a little while he too would be at work, and
      labour to him seemed lovely, for in it man expressed
      himself for his own sake and the sake of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat and watched a gardener scything grass. The swish of
      the steel blade and the swing of the shoulders fascinated
      him. Here was rhythm.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the pinewoods and their stillness and their
      solace. Thousands of dark tree-trunks making a mystery.
      Bracken played like green foam. He had glimpses of the
      purpling heather, and the rose mist of the willow-herb, and
      golden ragwort.
    </p>
    <p>
      He carried his sputum flask in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foul thing remained there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not need it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made friends. He sat and strolled and talked to other
      men and women and heard of their struggles and their
      sorrows and their endurings. On the whole, human nature
      showed up very well to him. It had courage, kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      And once a fortnight he looked into the eyes of his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some day I'll make all this up to you, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--I'm just giving what I want to give. That's
      all."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For, in spite of all man's cleverness and scheming, there
      was more promise of death than of life in this house of the
      afflicted, and in looking upon the faces of those others
      who were doomed to die Keir realized how relative was man's
      control of the forces of nature. He might know so much of
      the appearances and so little of the ultimate inwardness of
      things. It was like watching a swallow skimming the surface
      of a pool, or the leaping of a fish from the deep water.
      There was no why and wherefore. Things just happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, he would have said that certain happenings gave him a
      sense of security. Sybil's fortnightly visits were like the
      phases of a friendly planet whose steadfast circuit
      persuaded man that something was sure, something was
      stable. If Sybil had worries of her own, she did not bring
      them with her to "Pinehill." Keir did not know that all the
      electric bulbs at "Merrow" had successively gone on strike
      and that new ones had had to be purchased, or that the
      kitchen kettle had sprung a leak, or that the lavatory
      cistern was always overflowing. He did not know that
      another man had been making love to his wife and making it
      so persistently that Sybil had appealed to the police, and
      a large sergeant had shadowed the swashbuckler and,
      catching him sidling in at the gate of "Merrow," had given
      the gentleman a bad scaring. Keir never did know this, nor
      that Sybil sometimes went to bed so tired that she felt
      just able to peel off her stockings. She came to "Pinehill"
      on those fortnightly Fridays wearing a coquettish hat and
      an air of "All's well with the world." And the hat was not
      the only thing that was comely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was proud of his wife, of the appearance she made, and
      of the standard she set. Often he compared her to the other
      women who visited the place, and the comparison was all to
      Sybil's credit. The day was her love parade, and it owed
      nothing to the cinema and sensationalism. It entailed a
      considerable amount of preparation. Mrs. Smith had her hair
      waved; she manicured her hands and put polish on her rather
      work-worn finger-nails, and if her presence brought with it
      a suggestion of emotional perfume, her man was pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes showed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do look nice, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For she was one of those women who understand that a
      prosaic and perfunctory dowdiness can provoke infidelity in
      the male. She could indulge in a little secret laugh at the
      woman who boasted: "I--never--powder my nose." Sybil and
      most of the world might have retorted: "So I see. What a
      pity!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could tell Keir that she had paid the interest on the
      mortgage. She had every right to be proud of the money she
      was earning and the way she was handling it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir, I'm so glad we didn't sell the house."
    </p>
    <p>
      So was he, for he had every reason to suppose that he would
      take up his life where he had left it. He might work short
      hours for the first six months. He would be a man with a
      scar in his lung, but, as Mr. Lugard had said to him: "The
      doctors tell me that lots of us have P.T. and recover
      without knowing the danger we have been in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I'm glad we didn't sell the house. You're rather fond
      of it, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I love it."
    </p>
    <p>
      During those six months at "Pinehill," Keir as a realist
      made other observations upon life. Occasionally he would
      argue with an excitable little patient whose political
      views were extreme, and who would point to "Pinehill" as an
      example of communal methods, but though superficially this
      crowd of consumptives might be regarded as a communal
      crowd, the illusion vanished when you studied individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the doctors, and one or two of the doctors were
      more beloved and more successful than their confrères.
      There were the nurses, and there was variation in
      nursing-skill and in temperament. There were the patients.
      Keir could watch the community grading itself, separating
      into little cliques and classes. When there was a concert
      or a whist drive, certain individuals appeared to take
      control. The inevitable unlikeness leaked out even in such
      an institution as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, there were the grumblers, the flabby folk, and
      also the spongers. The opportunities for offering to share
      in other people's property were limited at "Pinehill," but
      the disposition showed itself, especially after
      visiting-days. Certain individuals would cadge books and
      other minor possessions; they tried to borrow small sums of
      money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was one of those who was approached by the "Pinehill"
      spongers. His wife came to the place looking decently
      dressed, and Keir somehow had the look of a careful fellow.
      They spun tales to him, but Keir was hard-hearted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing doing. I'm just as hard up as you are."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these enterprising parasites was unmasked as the
      most ingenious and pathetic of begging-letter writers. He
      was a solitary old scoundrel with a red nose, and he wrote
      as the father of a family. His children were starving at
      home. The recipients returned these letters with inquiries
      to the superintendent, and the ingenious gentleman was put
      in the pound as a liar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winter came, and the garden and orchards were put to sleep,
      but the pinewoods remained green, and the bracken turned
      the colour of rust. Keir walked each day, sometimes alone,
      sometimes with one or two other patients who were ripening
      for discharge. There had been no recrudescence of the
      cough, and he was feeling himself to be a fit man. He had
      been put down for discharge early in December. He would be
      home for Christmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the date of his liberation drew near, he became aware of
      an increasing excitement. He was going back to life and
      work and his own little corner of the world. He was very
      tired of communalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to the doctor who had been in charge of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm grateful to you, sir, for all you have done for me. I
      suppose I shall be able to go back to work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor gave him sound advice. Keir was not yet out of
      the wood, and his return to a working life would be on
      probation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see, you are a carpenter, Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. I can get out of doors, sir, a good deal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would be better for you--if you could. It is most
      important that you should take things easy for a while.
      Feel your way. Don't go and tear yourself to pieces."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir wrote a letter to Mr. Hoad. He said that he was to be
      discharged in December, and that he hoped to be back at
      work soon after his return. Mr. Hoad replied, and his
      letter was nicely vague. He said that he was very glad to
      hear that the disease had been arrested, and the result
      reflected great credit upon "Pinehill." And Keir, full of
      the eagerness and excitement of a man reprieved, did not
      read between the lines of Mr. Hoad's letter or appreciate
      its potential prevarications.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great day arrived on December 5th. Keir was in a
      holiday mood. He shaved himself a little more carefully,
      and with a soiled handkerchief added polish to his shoes.
      He had said good-bye to everybody an hour before the Lugard
      car arrived. He was gay, almost facetious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shall have my apron on next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      A small and kindly crowd saw Sybil and Keir drive off.
      Handkerchiefs were waved, though some of the leave-takers
      looked sad. Their turn might never come.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to have an old shoe on the car, Mrs. Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd better ask my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It wouldn't be out of place," said Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never had he felt so happy. He held his wife's hand, and
      she snuggled up against him. She was as happy as he was.
      She had played her part; she was bringing her man home.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--I'm so--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her. It was the first time that he had kissed her
      for months.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No danger now, Syb. My God--I feel as though a shadow has
      gone. I was cut off."
    </p>
    <p>
      She returned his kiss with ardour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I have wanted you, Keir. Sometimes--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've cried myself to sleep. I felt so lonely."
    </p>
    <p>
      They collected Joanna Mary from the Browns', and Joanna sat
      in her father's lap and looked at him with solemn eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daddy's grown quite fat."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Keir kissed the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a nice thing to say about your father."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was December, and the beech tree had shed its leaves and
      they had blown about the garden. Sybil apologized for the
      garden. She had been too busy to tidy it up and tuck it up
      for the winter, but to Keir the little place had no
      blemishes. It was his. He did not have to share it with
      other people, and, having lived in public for six months,
      he was prejudiced in favour of personal property and gates
      that could be marked "Private."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lugards' chauffeur carried in Keir's suitcase. Had Keir
      been in a position to write "Esquire" after his name, the
      chauffeur would have expected a tip. Gentlemen had their
      uses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Glad to be back home, I expect."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You bet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil had hurried in to put a match to the fire, and when
      Keir and Joanna Mary entered that familiar room, the flames
      were climbing through the coal. Joanna bumped up and down
      on her stout legs and shook her hair at her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Brown says I've been a very good girl."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's eyes lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's right. Nothing like blowing your own trumpet."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil pushed an arm-chair forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down, father. You had better keep your overcoat on
      till the fire's warmed the room up."
    </p>
    <p>
      She hurried away to take off her things and lay the tea,
      and Joanna leaned against her father's knees and made
      conversation. She asked Keir the most unexpected of
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is a harlot, daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was taken aback. He prevaricated.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something you need not know about, young woman. But who
      taught you that word?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I heard Mrs. Brown say that the lady who lives next door,
      the lady with the yellow head, was no better than a
      harlot."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna wondered why her father looked so strangely serious.
      And then her mother came into the room with the tea-tray,
      and Joanna saw her father look at her mother, and his face
      had a curious brightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Same old tea-pot, Syb. That's splendid."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      On the Saturday morning Keir walked into Kingham. He wanted
      to see Mr. Hoad about his return to work, and to arrange
      that he should work as much as possible out of doors.
      Kingham looked much as usual in spite of a trade slump; its
      shops were preparing for Christmas. Its streets seemed more
      full of loafers, and negligible young women, and loutish
      boys whom no one was eager to employ. Keir had to pass the
      Labour Exchange. It trailed from its door a long queue of
      shabby and apathetic men, and neighbouring doorways and
      shop fronts and street corners were decorated with them.
      Keir saw Mr. William Block with his back against the wall,
      staring with sodden brutishness at nothing. This depressed
      and bitter crowd sent a little shiver through Keir's
      vitals. The workless and the worthless! There were men who
      would always be worthless, and workless men who would
      become worthless. He was glad to get away from the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      The familiar gates of Samson, Hoad &amp; Gott had been
      repainted a vivid green, for the elder Gott had suggested
      to Hoad that it was not wise to look shabby when you were
      feeling down at the heels. Keir happened upon two or three
      of the old hands in the yard, and it seemed to him that
      they looked at him askance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Smith, out of hospital?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously so, and yet in the eyes of these men Keir
      discovered unfriendliness, suspicion. It was as though they
      were prejudiced against him and yet were a little ashamed
      of this prejudice. It made them gruff and casual, and Keir
      wondered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gov'nor in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. You'll find him in the office."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir walked in without knocking. He saw Hoad sitting at his
      desk. Hoad's profile became full face, and instantly Keir
      knew that his employer was not pleased to see him. He was
      welcomed with a little embarrassed smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You--Smith! Out of hospital. Sit down. When did you come
      out?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three days ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are you feeling?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite fit."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were alone together, but Keir did not sit down. He
      stood with his back to the office window and facing the
      official desk. Obviously, Mr. Hoad was not pleased to see
      him. He kept darting little uneasy glances at Keir, glances
      that appeared to pick pieces of fluff off Keir's person and
      deposit them on the floor. He fidgeted; almost he squirmed,
      and his fussy unrest infected Keir with an equal
      uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I would drop in and see about taking on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoad blinked behind his pince-nez. He removed the glasses,
      polished them, and laid them on the desk. Possibly he did
      not wish to see Keir's face too clearly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad you have called, Smith. I was going to write to
      you. Now you are here, we had better come to an
      understanding."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir remained mute. What was the fellow at?
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, but we have had to fill up your place."
    </p>
    <p>
      So that was it. He was to be a subordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--you have another foreman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I suppose you couldn't wait. You expect me to come
      back as a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His lips closed, for he saw that Hoad's courage had twisted
      itself into an effort to say something that might be
      unpleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, Smith, but we can't take you back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't take me back?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. I may as well tell you at once--that the choice isn't
      mine--so to speak. It has been forced upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The other men don't want you in the shop."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went white, but his eyes were angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Surely--you understand that a man who has had consumption
      may be regarded by his fellow workmen--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Hoad snapped at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Believe it or not, it's a fact. I'm not in the habit of
      lying. Two or three of the men told me very plainly that
      they would down tools if you were put back. And after
      all--there is reason in it. It may sound rather hard on
      you, but look at it from the other fellow's point of view."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean--they look on me--as a sort of leper?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, in a sense--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--I'm well. I'm not coughing. I'm not infectious."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoad shrugged his narrow shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be ignorance, but it's understandable. Besides, how
      can one be sure that you have a clean bill of health? Isn't
      it natural that a man might shirk being at the same bench
      with you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's face was a tragic mask. The anger had gone from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I could have an out-door job."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible, and you know it. Business is business, Smith.
      How can an employer make distinctions and keep a chap in
      cotton-wool? Besides, there would be the same
      feeling--among the others. I know it is hard on you, Smith.
      It's your misfortune."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was almost humble, for the thing had shocked him. He
      was to be one of the workless, a figure in that queue, a
      dole-monger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What am I to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Hoad saw that he had the upper hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I would suggest that you try and get some kind of
      out-door job, gardening, or driving a car or a van."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of your lorries?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear Smith--I can't sack a man to put you in. Go and
      see the Labour Exchange people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir walked out of the office and across the yard and out
      into the street. He was not very conscious of his
      surroundings. He just walked blindly out into the unknown
      with a feeling of cold fear in his stomach. His face looked
      pinched. He was conscious of one solitary urge, to get back
      home to his wife and a fire and to share with Sybil the
      terrible reality. He felt weak and sick.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not doubt Hoad's word, and in his bitterness certain
      of the class-cries in which Mr. Sparks indulged came
      vividly to his mind: "The Solidarity of Labour"--"The Great
      Brotherhood of the Workers"--"Service not Profit." And his
      fellow-workers had been the first people to push him into
      the street, to treat him like a creature that was unclean.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Keir opened the door of "Merrow," he found his wife at
      work in the kitchen. Joanna was building a house of toy
      bricks on the floor. Keir stood a moment looking at his
      wife and child, and his face was tragic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just a moment, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went to their bedroom, and she followed him. She had
      divined some disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's happened, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shut the door--I've been sacked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sacked!-Oh, Keir--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's true. The other chaps won't work with me. They
      are afraid of me--I'm--I'm--tainted."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was trembling. And suddenly his knees seemed to give way
      under him. He sat down on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      2
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      So Keir joined the queue outside the Kingham Labour
      Exchange, and Sybil continued to go out to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a new experience to Keir, loafing in a shabby street
      with shabby men, for many of whom there was no room in the
      world. Nor did his soul belong to the crowd or surrender
      itself to the crowd's mood. He was more self-conscious than
      class-conscious, and if he belonged to any class, it was
      that of the individualist and the artist. The shoddiness
      and the ugliness of the scene repelled him. His inclination
      was to hold aloof, and if he had wounds, not to lick them
      in public. He spoke to very few of his fellow unemployed,
      and only when he was spoken to.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ran into Mr. William Block, and Mr. Block struck an
      attitude and guffawed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Morning, Mr. Smiff--fancy us seeing you here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir moved away, and again Mr. Block guffawed, and Keir
      could hear him telling his immediate neighbours that the
      little ---- over there had got it in the guts, and a damned
      good thing too. ---- little bit of swollen tripe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the men were bitter and full of sordid cynicism.
      Some of them snarled when a class-car passed. Their hands
      seemed to finger imaginary bricks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Splash the mud over us, that's all they do."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ---- swine--with money."
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the men were more bewildered than bitter. Others
      displayed an apathy that suggested resignation or patience.
      There were many decent fellows in the crowd, and mostly
      they were the silent ones. As usual, the worthless element
      was more vocal.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these quiet men said to Keir: "It's nobody's
      fault--really. It just happens. I've done a bit of thinking
      in my time. Where would we be if we did what the Reds want
      us to do? Loot the shops and smash the police and turn the
      whole show upside down. There wouldn't be any dole. In a
      month or two there wouldn't be anything but a lot of
      starving fools. If you smash the machine, and the machine
      won't work, where are you? We can't all live on boiled
      spuds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir did not remain long with the crowd. A firm at Esher
      were asking for a carpenter, and one of the clerks, who was
      a friend of the Browns, had been watching out for Keir, and
      Keir was sent to secure the job. He had decided on
      reticence. He was seen by Mr. Lamb, of Ellison &amp; Lamb,
      a youngish man who did not trouble to ask too many
      questions. Ellison &amp; Lamb were a non-union firm, and
      Keir was ready to tear up his card.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long were you in your last place?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly ten years."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why were you stood off?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had to go to hospital, and they took on another man. I'm
      quite fit now. I've had all-round experience."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's see, you said your old firm was Samson &amp; Hoad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lamb smiled. He knew Hoad by reputation and had been
      undercut by him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they're on the cheap. We'll try you for a month,
      Smith. Trade-union rates, though we're not union. We have
      one or two houses going up. Out-of-door. Is that O.K.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will suit me very well, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had to cycle five miles to his work and five miles
      back again in the evening. He took his midday meal with
      him, and the men made themselves tea. Ellison &amp; Lamb
      was a fairly happy house, a firm of some tradition, and the
      men were more of the old country type. Keir felt cheered.
      He would show the firm what sort of work he could do. He
      tore into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit was willing, but the flesh was not the flesh of
      a year ago. For nine months or so he had been loafing; he
      was out of condition, and a working day is a working day.
      He got most terribly tired. He arrived home in the evening
      in a state of exhaustion, but he was determined to hide it
      from Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I'm getting on fine. It's just a question of climbing
      back to it. One's rusted up a bit, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes he was so tired at night that two or three hours
      would pass before he could fall asleep. He and Sybil were
      sleeping together again, and he would lie very still in the
      bed so as not to disturb or to betray his wakefulness.
      Sybil was a facile sleeper. She went off quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay awake and worried. Sometimes he would feel bitter
      against his own body. Would the thing fail him just when he
      was struggling back to his opportunity? Oh, no, it was
      merely a matter of time and of patience. He had always been
      a wiry chap. The habit of work had to be recovered, his
      slack muscles tuned up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir did not realize it then, but he was confronting the
      tragic problem of the man in whom tuberculosis of the lung
      has been arrested. He had rushed back into the working
      world to compete with fit men. He was under tension. He was
      trying to keep step with men who had not to trouble about
      the pace or the length of the day's march, and if his heart
      laboured and his breath failed him, he had to surrender or
      endure. He could not fall out. A second breakdown would be
      fatal.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of six weeks his cough returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather was cold and foggy, and his rides to and fro
      were made in the raw dawn and the equally raw evening. He
      tried to persuade himself that the cough was due to the
      fog. He even lied to his wife about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too many cigarettes, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was not convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had better go and see the doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a pretence of going, but he did not go near Dr.
      Gibson's surgery. He was afraid to go there. He hung on to
      the desperate illusion that his cough was a temporary
      trouble. When the weather improved, it would disappear. He
      bought himself a bottle of cough mixture at a cash
      chemist's and dosed himself with it secretly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cough continued. His fellow workmen noticed it, and the
      drawn and worried face of the man who coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've got a regular graveyard bark, Smithie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I don't know. Too many cigarettes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The old and too familiar symptoms began to recur, malaise,
      breathlessness, expectoration, that feeling of a secret and
      devouring fever in his chest; yet, with a kind of
      passionate obstinacy, he concealed things and carried on.
      He went back to the spare bedroom, pretending that his fear
      of disturbing Sybil made him cough. He repossessed himself
      of his sputum flask and used it secretly, though he dared
      not use it while at work, for it would betray him to his
      fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mood was one of dogged fatalism. What was the use of
      surrendering, of becoming a poor sick parasite? If he was
      destined to die, he would die in harness, or fight till his
      fate overbore him. His face had a ravaged look, and
      sometimes his eyes were like the eyes of a hunted creature.
      He was afraid of his fellow-men, afraid of being driven
      from the pack out into the wilderness. He became
      suspicious. He was being watched. He was sure that the
      other men whispered behind his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's consumptive. He ought not to be working with us. He's
      infectious."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt himself living in an atmosphere of hostility. He
      exaggerated trivialities, attached a sinister significance
      to casual words.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Martyrdom of Man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Years ago he had read that book and had thought it
      fantastic and gloomy, but now it was a sort of Adam's
      Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was not deceived. She, too, bore her secret anguish,
      an increasing fear; and one morning when Keir had gone to
      work, she left Joanna with Mrs. Brown and cycled into
      Kingham and caught Dr. Gibson before the surgery had
      closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Doctor, what do you think of my husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your husband? Why, I haven't seen him. Nothing wrong, I
      hope?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Sybil understood the secret and wilful courage of Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He said he had been to see you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The cough's come back, but I know how it is. He lost his
      old job, and he doesn't want to lose the new one."
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell him to come along, yes--at once. No use
      shilly-shallying. I'm sorry, Mrs. Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kind words cut her to the quick. She got herself out of the
      surgery before her emotion made a public exhibition of
      itself. Almost she was angry with Keir. She choked back her
      urge to weep, and wheeling her bicycle into a quiet street,
      she mounted and rode slowly homewards. A grown woman on a
      bike--blubbering! How silly! She managed to suppress her
      emotion. But that very evening she would take Keir to see
      the doctor. It was inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      She expected Keir home about six o'clock, and in her
      anxiety she left the front window open so that she could
      hear the sound of the gate. Joanna was at the Browns' and
      would be collected when she and Keir returned from the
      doctor's. Tea was laid, and Sybil had her hat on. She was
      determined to persuade Keir to go with her and see Dr.
      Gibson after tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before six she heard the opening and closing of the
      gate. She went to the window. She had heard footsteps, but
      the steps had ceased, and in the silence she heard a
      strange sound, a kind of wet spasm. There was a curious
      anguish in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, is that you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was some sort of smothered reply, and stricken with
      fear, she hurried into the passage, switched on the light,
      and opened the front door. A figure appeared to be groping
      its way towards her and the light. And then she saw--Keir's
      mouth and chin were all red; his collar and coat were
      drenched with the same redness. She saw blood gushing from
      his mouth in a strange, terrifying, and uncontrollable
      flux.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--my dear--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Breathless, smothering, he managed to gasp out a few words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happened--just as I reached--gate.--Don't be
      frightened--Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow she got him in and to the bed in the spare room.
      She snatched a basin, a towel. Her own hands were all red,
      but this horror of hæmorrhage, though it appalled her,
      roused no repulsion. She held his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go to the Browns' and get Mr. Brown to fetch the
      doctor--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were imploring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not--yet--Stay--till it stops, Syb. Don't leave me."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Keir lay in bed and looked at the window. The window was
      wide open, and the green cretonne curtains kept up a gentle
      movement. He could see the grey trunk and the lower
      branches of the beech tree, and very soon all the buds of
      the great tree would be growing big and golden. He could
      hear Joanna Mary's wheelbarrow rattling up the path, and
      the sudden voice of Sybil: "Don't make a noise near the
      house, dear. Daddy may be asleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      He wanted to call to them and tell them that he was not
      sleeping and that he was not worried by the sound of the
      barrow, but he was not allowed to speak save in whispers.
      There was to be no excitement, no sudden movement, no
      talking. He could lie there and think and look at his own
      useless hands, spread palms-upward on the quilt. There was
      nothing for him to do but think, to lie there and confront
      a perfectly hopeless future.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall have to get you back into the sanatorium, Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      What was the use? As a worker and a bread-winner he was
      done for. He had tried to recover his place in the world,
      to live and labour with normal men, and he had broken down,
      yes, hopelessly so. Probably he would die, and though he
      wanted to live, he was not sure that he wanted to live as a
      poor, pottering parasite, an incubus, a man who had ceased
      to be man.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife came into the room. She stood at the foot of the
      bed and looked at him with gentle solicitude. She was
      extraordinarily gentle and patient and courageous. She was
      not one of those women who betray resentment in the face of
      such a crisis or who allow their worries to escape into
      fretful self-expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is time for your warm milk, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her wistfully. He was so very grateful to her
      because she looked at him without any suspicion of
      reproach. His own self-reproaches were sufficiently bitter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was submissive, and to Sybil his submission was
      infinitely pathetic, he--a man who had always been so
      intense and active. She had loved him for his pride, and
      now she loved him more poignantly because he was broken and
      consenting. She went and passed a hand over his pillow and
      then laid it on his forehead. She had a cool, soft hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're much better, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes--I'm better."
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought the milk in a feeding-cup and supported his
      head while he drank. His poor neck looked so thin. His
      weakness wrung her heart. She had made arrangements to go
      out to work again for three days during each week, but she
      had not told him yet. She was waiting until he was a little
      stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Drink it all, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      He emptied the cup. He was so like a sick child. She
      lowered his head to the pillows and let her hand rest for a
      moment on his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you like a book?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought him one of Mr. Lugard's books, and with a last
      careful glance round the room she left him, closing the
      door very gently. But Keir did not read his book. He was
      absurdly weak, and even the holding of a book soon tired
      him. He preferred to lie and listen to his wife's
      movements, and the coming and going of Joanna in the
      garden. He had said to Sybil: "Don't stop the kid. I like
      to hear her about."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay and meditated. What would happen to these two if he
      passed out? What would happen to them if he went on living
      for a number of years, as a sort of human derelict?
      Drifting,--drifting. Was there any other kind of work that
      he could do? If only he had been one of those fellows who
      could write books, popular books which sold well and made
      money. Robert Louis Stevenson. But that man had been a
      genius as well as a very valiant soul. He lay and thought
      and thought, his fingers grasping the edge of the quilt as
      though even that soft substance gave him a sense of
      solidity. What could he do? He was a working man, and
      without the strength of his body he could do nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of the scuffling of small feet. A pair of
      hands and a face appeared at the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jo smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm getting more stones for the path."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you? That's splendid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Stones for the path! If only he had the healthy body of his
      child? But what if she had inherited from him that delicacy
      of tissue that might make her vulnerable to the disease? He
      closed his eyes and tried to think of other things.

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was allowed to get up.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a tremor in the air, a breath of spring, and Keir
      was told that he might lie out in the garden, provided he
      kept himself well covered. He might even walk a little, and
      all this carefulness moved him to a kind of whimsical
      wonder, a twinge of self-scorn. This business of keeping
      people alive! Dr. Gibson struck him as being so egregiously
      and professionally cheerful, but then--it was part of a
      physician's job to suggest cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope to get you re-admitted next month, Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Keir was provoked into asking that inevitable question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, what is the use, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gibson could not let such pessimism pass. Like all
      professional men he had to subscribe to the particular
      professional pragmatism. In this war between cells you
      could not countenance surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mustn't talk like that, Smith. You must will yourself
      to get well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir smiled up at him. Gibson was a beefy, thick-set person
      with a fine capacity for enjoying life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking of the afterwards, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Supposing they give me another six months' treatment and
      send me out patched up--what's the use of it? I've had my
      lesson. I know now that I can't go back to the old job. I
      can't keep up with fit men, and the industrial system
      doesn't legislate for crocks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear chap--there's always an alternative."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have tried to think of something. What is there that I
      can do? Be honest, doctor. I might be capable of doing a
      few hours' light work--but a full day--no. As a wage-earner
      I'm done for."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gibson fell back on platitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, look here--sufficient unto the day is the worry
      thereof. What you have to do is to keep your tail up and
      get well. Afterwards--you can begin to explore."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir looked at his thin, white hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pity I can't write books, doctor. The diary of a
      down-and-out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, it's better than nothing. Man's an ingenious devil,
      and you've got brains. I know an old lady who helps to keep
      herself by decorating boxes and things with sealing-wax.
      She's a marvel at it. It's just an idea--that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know. Some sort of makeshift. Turning out little
      cabinets for birds' eggs, or converting cigar-boxes into
      letter-files. Or I might specialize on wireless sets."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Gibson was not very sensitive to irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Exactly. That's the idea. Things have a marvellous way of
      turning up trumps."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was going out to work on four days a week, but her
      twenty-eight to thirty shillings--added to Keir's insurance
      money--left them very little margin. More often than not
      the balance was on the wrong side, for there was the
      interest on the mortgage to be met quarterly, and the rates
      on "Merrow" were seventeen pounds a year. Moreover, Dr.
      Gibson had impressed upon her how necessary it was that
      Keir should be well and properly fed; plenty of fresh eggs
      and milk. And the family wardrobe had been falling into
      disrepair. Keir began to suspect his wife of stinting
      herself at meals, and he charged her with indulging in
      unselfish but false economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You aren't eating enough, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      She assured him that she was provided with a very good
      dinner at the houses where she worked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I get all I want, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not believe her. He guessed that she was keeping all
      the small financial worries from him, and that their budget
      could not be easy to balance. In fact, Sybil was at her
      wits' end trying to accumulate a little money to meet the
      rates, and the gas and electric light bills. She was
      scanning the house for some piece of furniture that might
      be regarded as superfluous and upon which money could be
      raised. The victim offered itself in the person of the
      Chesterfield sofa. Sybil had always been rather proud of
      that sofa, but it did crowd the room, and why cling to a
      sofa, when you had two arm-chairs to sit in?
    </p>
    <p>
      She spoke to Keir on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm thinking of getting rid of the sofa. It does crowd us
      up--rather."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was not deceived. Sybil and that sofa were somehow
      associated in his mind, and to reprieve the piece he
      suggested that Sybil should sell his bookcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you must have a bookcase for your books, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not much use to us, are they? You can get rid of most of
      the books too, if you like."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil would not hear of it. The sofa was the predestined
      victim, and Sybil interviewed a gentleman who purchased
      second-hand furniture. He came to view the sofa and offered
      her about a third of the price they had paid for the thing
      when it was new. Sybil was angry and explored the pockets
      of other purchasers; she managed to raise the price by
      three and sixpence, and the sofa departed from "Merrow." It
      was the first hostage to fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident produced a strange bitterness in Keir. Because
      he was down and out, someone else was getting a bargain at
      Sybil's expense. Yes, in all probability other pieces of
      furniture would follow the sofa into exile. He and Sybil
      had housed themselves for health, and now that he was a
      sick man and unable to earn anything, they were over-housed
      and over-rated. Common sense suggested that they should
      sell the bungalow, pay off the mortgage, and move into
      cheaper quarters.
    </p>
    <p>
      A return to Paragon Place, or some back street that was
      equally crowded and drab and noisy?
    </p>
    <p>
      No, that was beyond the bounds of his pride. But for his
      rotten body there would have been no selling of sofas. He
      began to feel bitter towards his own body. What was it but
      a wretched incubus, a crocked machine fit only for the
      scrap heap. If it was disposed of, Sybil would be free, and
      in many ways better off.
    </p>
    <p>
      She might marry again!
    </p>
    <p>

    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil came back one April evening and found no Keir. Joanna
      Mary was giving a doll a ride in the barrow, and suddenly
      Sybil felt anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Daddy's gone for a walk. He said he would go only just a
      little way."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had not been out of the garden since his hæmorrhage,
      but Dr. Gibson had given him permission to take short
      walks. Obviously, Keir was only doing what the doctor had
      said he might do, and yet Sybil was attacked by a sense of
      some impending calamity. She ran out into the lane to see
      if Keir was anywhere in sight. She walked as far as the
      Browns' villa, thinking that he might have called on the
      Browns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was half a mile away. He had gone down to the river
      and was sitting on the bank, just above the water. He
      should not have been sitting on the damp grass, but when a
      man is confronting death, such trivialities are of small
      account. There was much water coming down, but it was a
      windless day and the river ran with a swift stealth. As to
      its colour, it seemed all sorts of colours to Keir, brown
      and black and green and silver and flecked with white and
      with blue. Its surface showed streaks and eddies and little
      glassy swirls. It was so silent. It just slid past him
      between its very green banks on a soft April day.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at it and he thought: "It would be so easy. It
      would wash out everything. There would be no more hope and
      no more heartache. It would set her free."
    </p>
    <p>
      He took off his hat and layed it on the bank. He stood up
      and sat down again. It occurred to him that he ought to
      lash his feet together with his handkerchief. He took out
      his handkerchief and rolled it into a rope, and then he
      remembered that Sybil had given him six handkerchiefs as a
      Christmas present and that this was one of them. He
      unfolded it, smoothed it out, and put the thing back in his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      A reaction swept over him. What a beautiful world it was,
      and he wanted to go on living in it. He wanted to be loved.
      No, not death, but the faces and hands of his loved ones.
      He was overwhelmed with sudden loneliness. He got up and
      walked rapidly along the towing-path and up a lane that led
      away from the river. He walked so fast that he was out of
      breath, but he did not notice it. He was going home. He
      wanted to go on living and being loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he came to the gate of "Merrow," he found his wife
      waiting for him there, and suddenly he was ashamed, for it
      seemed to him that she knew how he had been tempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just had a bit of a walk, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes reproached him, for he looked exhausted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shouldn't do it, Keir. You've tired yourself out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A chap must do something."
    </p>
    <p>
      He followed her into the house. They were alone together in
      that familiar little room, and suddenly his manhood failed
      him. He sat down on the arm of one of the chairs. He broke
      down and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm no more use. I'd be better dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was shocked and alarmed. She tried to comfort him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, you mustn't say such things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But they're true."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no. When you get to the sanatorium--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the use of my going there? They just feed you up
      and send you out again. I shall never be able to work. It
      would be the same old business over again. I'm no good for
      anything; I shall never be any good."
    </p>
    <p>
      She held his head on her shoulder, and she was afraid. Her
      courage had endured for months, but she too was near
      breaking-point. She wanted help--She felt that she must do
      something. But what? Her man was drowning in the deeps of
      his despair. Yes, she must do something.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood up. An idea had come to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm going to see Mrs. Lugard, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can she do? They've been jolly good--but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil's face was set.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gentlefolk sometimes know things we don't. They hear of
      things we don't hear of, Keir. Promise me you'll stay
      here--quietly. Oh, my dear,--I'm so--so frightened.
      Promise."
    </p>
    <p>
      His courage recovered itself at her cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. Sorry, Syb. Damned snivelling kid. I'm all right now,
      I'll put Jo to bed."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him poignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go now. I'm trusting you, Keir. I'm trusting you."

      Sybil went to the back door of Darvels, and the door was
      opened to her by that supreme domestic authority--cook.
      Jane had been with the Lugards an impossible number of
      years. She was pre-war in all her characteristics and her
      prejudices, in her cap and her skirts and the dressing of
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jane, I'm in such trouble. Is--she--in?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She--was Mrs. Mary Lugard, and if the household spoke of
      her with brevity, it was not with disrespect. Mrs. Lugard
      was staying in Somerset with a sister, but He--was at home.
      Cook had just finished serving His dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come in, my dear. What is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir. He's feeling so hopeless about himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor lad--I always did tell you he was the serious sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if He would see me, Jane."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cook was sure that He would. She had sent Him in a perfect
      savoury, and he had eaten it all, and he was in the library
      with his coffee and his pipe. She would go and ask Him. And
      if Sybil felt like a cup of cocoa--
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, Jane--I couldn't. I don't feel like cocoa. Do say I am
      so sorry to worry him--at this time of the day--but that he
      may be able to give me some advice. He has travelled so
      much, and he knows so much."
    </p>
    <p>
      Cook went forth upon the adventure. She found Mr. Lugard
      well down in his chair, wearing his horn-rimmed glasses,
      and looking perhaps much wiser than he felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Jane?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mrs. Smith, sir. She's in great trouble about her husband.
      She came to see Mrs. Lugard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Husband worse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From what Sybil says, sir, he's feeling hopeless about
      himself. She's wondering if you'd see her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard put down his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, Jane. Send her in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Richard Lugard was a man of multifarious interests and
      of some experience. In his university days he had been an
      enthusiastic supporter of East End missions, travelling
      down regularly to Poplar to box and play billiards with the
      Cockney lads. Each year he had gone to camp with them, but
      with London, and especially the East End of London,
      becoming more greasy and swarthy and Mediterranean, Mr.
      Lugard had reformed himself. That is to say he had lost his
      sense of high endeavour. He had come to loathe "Uplift" and
      to associate it with priggery and the new education. He
      preferred dogs and gardens and the bucolic mind and an
      attitude to life that was rather that of Gaffer Brown when
      some bright young graduate in glasses proposed to teach the
      old fool how to suck eggs. The world was becoming so
      deucedly clever.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Lugard's interests were various. He liked to read
      about the buccaneers and that old plundering
      blackguard--Morgan. He liked adventure, whether it was in
      science of sociology, or big business, or the floating of
      some new process. He read all the serious journals, while
      remaining a man who could play absurd games with a puppy.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Sybil was shown in, he instantly rose and with an air
      of simplicity shook hands with her. He had such mellow
      manners that no one noticed that he had any manners.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sit down and tell me all about it, Sybil."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil burst into tears, and somehow she did not feel
      foolish in Mr. Lugard's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I'm so--so worried, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, tell me all about it. And there's no hurry. I'm
      sorry Mrs. Lugard isn't at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil recovered herself. Very simply she put Keir's case to
      Mr. Lugard, explaining it from Keir's point of view as well
      as from her own. She was aware of Mr. Lugard stretching out
      a hand and rummaging among the books and periodicals on the
      table beside his chair. He listened to her, and while he
      listened, he opened a particular pamphlet and kept glancing
      at it, while remaining attentive to Sybil. It was as though
      she was describing a journey while he followed it all on a
      map.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "Silly of me. I ought to have thought of it
      before. Ever heard of Papworth, Sybil?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil had not, nor had Mr. Lugard till a couple of months
      ago, but the life of the consumptive colony had so
      interested him that he had driven down to Papworth and
      explored it. He had made the acquaintance of Papworth's
      creator and had discovered in him one of those Elizabethan
      types that suggested Drake and Raleigh, a Grenville or a
      Sidney, a temperament colourful, creative, and touched with
      imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard explained Papworth and the aims and ideals of
      Papworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You see, Sybil, it is not like an ordinary sanatorium. The
      idea is that consumptives should be able to live and work
      and have their own people about them. It's not just a place
      to be ill in."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean, sir, that if Keir got well he could stay and
      live and work there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's the idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Jo and I could join him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had become flushed and excited.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's wonderful. Why didn't anybody think of it
      before? That's what's killing my man, sir, the awful
      feeling that he is no use, and that he'll never be any use.
      The awful feeling too that other men won't work with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's the tragedy; but the man who founded Papworth
      isn't a mere doctor. He had vision, understanding,
      courage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps he felt what we feel, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, probably."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would it be possible for Keir to go to Papworth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Certainly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then--there's hope, sir. Oh, you don't know what hope
      means. But of course--you do. Perhaps you would come and
      see Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll come tomorrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if--How does one manage--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go down to Papworth myself and see what can be done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil could have kissed his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know--really--why you should be so kind, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that's nothing, my dear child. Life's a dreadful sort
      of failure if it doesn't teach one to be kind."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There was hope in Keir's eyes and in his heart. There was
      new hope in him as he shaved himself and tied his best tie,
      for as a man he knew Mr. Lugard was not one of those
      flamboyant and impulsive people to whom everything that is
      new is marvellous and final. Mr. Lugard had given Sybil
      some literature on Papworth Village Settlement for Keir to
      read, and Keir had read all there was to read before
      falling asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the breakfast table he showed to his wife the face of a
      man who had ceased to despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Funny we should not have heard of it before, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--I wonder why Dr. Gibson didn't tell us about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The omission was due to ignorance, that curious
      professional ignorance which may be the product of cliquism
      and complacency. The professional god, like most other
      deities, is a jealous god and averts his eyes from all that
      may be described as heretical and falsely miraculous.
      Later, when Keir spoke to Dr. Gibson of that unique
      community, Dr. Gibson looked mildly offended.
      "Papworth--Papworth, never heard of the place." His tone
      suggested that the thing smelt of charlatany, or that the
      enterprise could be dismissed as a fad, and perhaps a
      fashionable fad. Was it orthodox? Had its creator qualified
      as a medical practitioner, or was he one of those offensive
      people who dare to walk in advance of the professional
      experts, and who capture a bishop or two, and a duchess and
      a cabinet minister, and who advertise some flagrant and
      successful hocus-pocus?
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, sitting in the April sunlight with Mr. Lugard, asked
      some of the questions that Dr. Gibson might have asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it quite all right, sir? I mean--is it run by doctors,
      responsible people?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard was gently amused. He was able to reassure Keir.
      He could understand the scepticism of a man who had plumbed
      the deeps of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are hundreds of men working at Papworth, many of
      them men who had given up all hope of ever working again. I
      have seen them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What sort of men?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men of all kinds, Keir. Schoolmasters, shop-assistants,
      labourers, ex-policemen, clerks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are workshops?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, they make furniture and leather goods and many other
      things. Just imagine, a village in which every worker has
      been a consumptive, a village in which every man can live a
      more or less normal life. He hasn't to compete with men who
      have not been handicapped by the disease."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir asked many other questions. What happened to a patient
      when he was first admitted? Sanatorium treatment. Oh, yes,
      and supposing the disease was arrested? The patient was
      allowed to work? At work--perhaps--for which he had been
      trained? Yes. He was--so to speak--on probation. His day's
      work was carefully graded. He was kept under observation
      and examined at regular intervals. And supposing he made
      good? He would be earning quite good money; he could become
      the occupant of one of the Papworth cottages. His wife and
      child could join him. He would be the possessor of a home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir said: "It seems too good to be true. It's the thing,
      sir, that a chap like me has been praying for. It
      means--hope."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he looked rather sadly at the small white building
      with the green door. He and Sybil had been so proud of
      "Merrow." It was associated with early memories of their
      marriage and with dreams of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose one ought not to get sentimental about bricks
      and mortar, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But one does, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will mean selling this place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not let it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take it that if I go to Papworth, I might be there six
      months or a year before the wife and child could join me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I believe that would be so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir looked thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I've got to go through with it. I suppose it would
      be better if Sybil stayed on here. We should have to pay
      the interest on the mortgage, but we shouldn't have to pay
      for storing the furniture. And I shall be off her hands.
      She'll have to go on working, poor kid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard had something to say upon the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think your wife is pitying herself, Keir. And that
      is rather rare in these days, and a virtue to be saluted.
      The people who face things out for themselves are almost
      unique."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what you mean, sir. Always expecting someone else
      to carry their burdens for them when the weight begins to
      chafe them just a little. State cadgers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see a good deal of other cadging, Keir. I have quite a
      number of so-called friends who--because I have no children
      and am considered to possess some spare cash,--seem to
      think that I ought to pay for their children's education. I
      don't. Well, what about Papworth? The decision is with
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course--if they will take me, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, I'll motor down tomorrow and see what I can do."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard did not tell Keir that he had been so inspired
      by the significance of Papworth that he had sent the
      institution a substantial donation. He drove down next day
      by way of Baldock and Royston. It was a morning of sudden
      rain and sudden sunlight, a blue day, wet and glittering.
      At Papworth the avenue of lime trees leading up to the old
      white house with its huge Ionic portico were purpling their
      leaf buds. Mr. Lugard was shown into the library, on the
      left of the hall where orderlies were laying the tables for
      dinner. He had sent up his card to Sir Pendrill Varrier
      Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Pendrill came down to him in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may remember me--perhaps. You allowed me to explore
      your village last month."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Pendrill remembered everybody. He was one of those men
      of action who give no appearance of hurry. If he had the
      head of a Welsh bard, he had the manners of a courtier, and
      the wisdom of a gentle autocrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are always glad to see our friends."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard explained that he had come to Papworth on
      business, if the placing of a patient could be regarded as
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A case I am interested in--a rather pathetic case."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Pendrill took Mr. Lugard upstairs to his sitting-room,
      and on the stairs he was heard to say that all such cases
      were pathetic, but that Papworth did not exaggerate their
      pathos. Moreover, Papworth was not the melancholy place
      that the over-sentimental might take it to be. It
      cultivated courage and cheerfulness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard stood a moment and looked out of Sir Pendrill's
      windows at the grass and the old trees. The place had
      atmosphere. It was English, and so quietly English.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said: "It seems to me that it was extraordinarily wise
      of you to settle in a place that was--dressed. One expected
      a sort of municipal building scheme."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Pendrill was lighting a pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We may be new--oh, very new--but--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard smiled at him. He was more and more sure that
      Sir Pendrill had the head of a poet and that his epic had
      not been written on paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Pendrill gave Mr. Lugard lunch, and having discussed
      Keir's case, they talked of other things. Mr. Lugard, who
      loathed noise, was surprised by the tranquillity of the big
      white building. It housed the settlement's hospital; there
      were scores of patients in its wards, and yet no sounds
      seemed to penetrate to the director's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are amazingly quiet here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You think so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a little whimsical glint behind the question, and
      Sir Pendrill looked towards one of the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sleep over there. When you have a community like this on
      your shoulders--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--I can understand--All the problems climb the stairs
      to this room. You mean you sleep in a tent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm not quite so primitive as that. I have a bungalow away
      there among the trees."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your retreat? Yes, I should gather that it's necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard's humanity felt at home with the large and
      tranquil humanity of this other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How did you come to start this scheme?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Pendrill smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--? Oh--it would be more correct to say that it started
      me. I saw the tragedy of these broken lives. Something
      became inevitable. It began with a shelter in a back
      garden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you had the vision."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Pendrill relit his pipe and let the challenge pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Lugard walked through the village before he left. It
      was the most amazing village in England, and he could
      imagine Keir working here and going home to one of the red
      brick cottages. He thought to himself: "We tired and
      flippant people need something like this, something that is
      so utterly worth while." He was in a happy mood. He had
      good news for Keir. Papworth would take Keir in
      immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening, after dinner, he was driven to "Merrow," and
      he broke the good news to Keir and Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You can be admitted next week."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's face looked all smoothed out. He had begun to hope.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Most patients arrive at Papworth via Cambridge, the
      settlement bus meeting them at Cambridge station, but Keir
      and Sybil and one shabby suitcase travelled to Papworth in
      the Lugard car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir found saying good-bye to Joanna and to "Merrow" a
      heart-in-the-throat affair. He was like an emigrant setting
      out for a new continent. If he survived the struggle in the
      wilds, he would have to make a home there for these other
      two. He supposed that he would never see "Merrow" again,
      for if he died at Papworth, most certainly he would not
      revisit the scenes of his youth; and if he lived at
      Papworth, he would go on living there.
    </p>
    <p>
      His face looked stark as he walked out of the gate. No, he
      was not betraying any emotion. He held Joanna firmly by the
      hand; she was to spend the day with the Browns. He did not
      look back at the small white bungalow or the beech tree. He
      spoke almost jocosely to the Lugard chauffeur, who had
      become very much a friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First-class tickets to Papworth, Fred, and no punctures."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got new tires on, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I want, old man, is a new inner tube."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna was left at the Browns', but Keir surrendered that
      emotional crisis to his wife. His eyes said: "Take her in,
      Syb; I can't bear it," and Joanna, suddenly wet and woeful,
      was carried in by her mother. Sybil returned to the car
      with a face that was asking not to be looked at too
      closely. Fred, the chauffeur, tucked them both up in the
      back seats of the limousine just as he tucked up Mr. and
      Mrs. Lugard.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat close together, holding hands. Sometimes one or
      other made a desultory remark, but mostly they were silent.
      Outer London displayed to them innumerable new building
      estates with row upon row of mass-production houses.
      Notice-boards announced to the world that it could own its
      own house for the sum of £695.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just like one of your drapery shops, Syb. One and eleven
      pence three farthings."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil wanted to know who lived or who was going to live in
      all these thousands of houses, and Keir could not tell her.
      He surveyed them with the eye of the expert.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lot of trash, most of it. I wonder what the repair bill
      will be ten years hence."
    </p>
    <p>
      His own repair bill was a gamble with death, and the green
      of the young year seemed to him strange and tantalizing.
      Open country now, though it was scarred by the new concrete
      highways. He sat and held his wife's hand and dreaded the
      moment when he would have to relinquish it. He had begun to
      realize how much he depended upon this other human
      creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed through the broad street of Baldock and came to
      the chalkland, great grassy undulations under a thin blue
      sky. There was a sadness in the landscape, and to Keir's
      mood it appeared too large and unfriendly, like the sea
      when you are feeling too much alone with yourself. This
      downland had none of the wooded richness, the secrecy, of
      the hills above Shere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather bare, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I like my world a bit more shut in. You can see too far
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      He hoped that Papworth did not live among these grey-green
      hills, and when they turned north at the Royston crossroads
      and came to gentler country, he was glad. Elm trees and
      hedges, and meadows, a wood here and there; consoling,
      closed-in country. But they were approaching Papworth, and
      he held his wife's hand a little more firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly there, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      She understood him. Her fingers closed on his.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, quite suddenly, they came to the valley where
      Papworth lies. The village begins as a few new cottages
      standing in their gardens beside the road. Trees rise up,
      old sheltering trees. There is a sudden glimpse of the
      white solidity of Papworth Hall. The valley fills with a
      feeling of humanity, houses and buildings where people live
      and work. The sun shone out. The grass was sheeted with it
      and flecked with shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's face brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did not think it was like this. I thought it would look
      like--'Pinehill'--or a bit of new suburb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's just a village, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just as though it had grown here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Which it had.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them were a little over-awed by the height and
      massiveness of the hall's Ionic portico. It was the gateway
      of Keir's new world, and he felt rather like a small boy
      being taken to school for the first time by his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose we ought to come here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred, the chauffeur, had collected considerable information
      with regard to the Papworth routine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's quite O.K. You aren't calling on the Prince of
      Wales! The hospital and the offices are in the hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rang the bell, and a nurse appeared, and, like many
      nurses, she had much to do and was a little abrupt and
      pragmatical. Was one of them a patient? Oh, the man. Was he
      expected? Yes. Well, they had better wait in the library.
      She would tell the matron that there was a patient for
      admission.
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed them into the library and disappeared.
      Cloistered together in that big room with its shelves of
      books, they felt like two rabbits shut up in a hutch.
      Papworth had a multitude of jobs to do and other matters to
      memorize, and Keir strolled up and down looking at the
      literature. Sybil sat down at the long table. There was
      silence. Both of them felt restless, creatures of suspense.
      The place was strange to them, and in a little while they
      would be separated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir went and stood at the window. It looked across the
      gravelled space to the avenue of limes. Very soon the trees
      would be in leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seems very quiet here, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--you wouldn't think--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder if we've come at the wrong time? A place like
      this has to have its time-table."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't worry, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the door opened, and to them appeared Miss Borne,
      the matron, solid, rosy, the Dea Mater of Papworth in her
      dark brown uniform. The room became different. It felt
      warmed by the human presence of this woman with her blue
      eyes and her wise and capable kindness. She sat down and so
      did they. She smiled upon them; she asked questions. She
      was instantly their friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope we haven't come at the wrong time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Borne looked at Sybil, and Sybil looked at Miss Borne.
      There was something about this solid and steadfast woman
      that made people feel that life was more secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her kindness was the kindness of a woman who was
      responsible for a multitude of daily details. She had a lap
      into which other people cast their troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been in a sanatorium before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband tried to work too soon--and too hard."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are many cases like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She observed them both with her wise blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You two would like just a moment together. Then--your
      husband--will have to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil understood. Her eyes thanked this other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few seconds they clung together alone in that big
      room. Their leave-taking was almost silent, as silent as it
      was poignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take care of yourself, Syb. I'll be all right here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, don't you worry. I'll write tomorrow. You've been a
      wonderful wife to me, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--you must--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. I'll get well. I've got to get well."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The life of Papworth began on the top floor of Papworth
      Hall. It was like a storage tank from which the inmates
      flowed gradually to the lower floors and so out to the
      chalets and yet farther to the workshops and the hostels,
      if fate was kind. Keir, as a new patient under observation,
      ascended to that upper floor. His bed was in a corner of
      the ward, but so placed that he could look out of one of
      the Georgian windows at the parklike grounds of the hall.
      This world was growing green.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great lawn spread to thickets of trees and flowering
      shrubs, and between two of these thickets a broad grass way
      led upwards. At the end of this green vista were walnut
      trees. Birds sang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ward was full. Papworth was always full.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was tired after the long drive and the stress of the
      day's emotions. He lay there with closed eyes, thinking of
      so many things. He was alone and yet not alone. He had
      exchanged a few words and a smile with his neighbours, and
      these other men let him lie in peace, for there is a quick
      sense of comradeship among the sick, a more sensitive
      comprehending of the other fellow's necessities. This new
      chap did not want to be worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ward remained very quiet. It read or worked out
      crossword puzzles, or just lay and dreamed. Occasionally it
      coughed. There were patients in it who were content to lie
      in peace and be thankful when the little flame of life was
      not blown slantwise by the draught of their disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sudden stirring in the ward, a rustling of
      papers, a sense of movement in the beds. The presence was
      there, that presence which was Papworth. It stood for a
      moment in the doorway, it was both deliberate and dramatic;
      it crossed the ward to Keir's bed. Keir was lying with his
      eyes closed, but seemed to divine the presence. He opened
      his eyes and saw a big man, with his large, pale face and
      his mane of very black hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Pendrill smiled at Keir. There was no flexion of that
      strong figure. Sir Pendrill carried himself like some
      senator leading the procession up the Sacred Way. Life had
      dignity, poise, rhythm. If he was a little unusual, it was
      the unusualness of a personality conscious of imaginative
      purpose and of power. There was a gentleness about this
      vivid person, a serenity of understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am afraid I have spoilt your sleep."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir lay and gazed. His smile was like the smile of a
      child. Something seemed to flow to him from the presence.
      It was so consoling, so calm. It had interposed between man
      and death.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wasn't asleep, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just--thinking?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, just thinking, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Pendrill's fingers rested on Keir's wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Lugard's case. Well, just get settled down. You have
      had a longish journey. We shan't worry you till tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed on to the other patients, and Keir was aware of
      the brightening of those other faces. This man with the
      massive head brought a new vitality into the ward. He was
      human; he understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How's the latest puzzle going, Macey?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a bit of a twister, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're looking better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm feeling champion, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      The presence passed out, leaving behind it in the ward a
      curious vibration in the air. Keir, still ignorant of the
      visitor's identity, turned to his left-hand neighbour, a
      Northampton shoe-operative named Briggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was that? The doctor in charge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Briggs looked tolerantly at Keir as though a newcomer had
      to be forgiven for being a consummate greenhorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That? Haven't you seen Jones before? We call him Father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir Varrier Jones? The man who made Papworth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir lay and looked at the ceiling. He heard a voice say:
      "The one and only Jones. Wish we saw him oftener."
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone replied: "Why, the Old Man's got the whole blinking
      show on his shoulders. He's P.M. and Managing Director and
      Chief Advertising Agent. If you cut him up into little
      bits, you wouldn't make him go round every day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet another voice closed the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He gives us all the time he can. He has given us all we've
      got. It makes me feel better to be near a man who's started
      a job like this."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir felt strangely calmed. His next-door neighbour had
      passed him a magazine, and he thanked Mr. Briggs and
      pretended to read it, but presently he closed his eyes. He
      wanted to think. In the darkness he seemed nearer to all
      those things that were dear to him, and in this ward he
      felt like a stranger in a strange land. His sentence would
      be a life sentence, if the doctors were able to reprieve
      him. He would live and work here--So that had been Sir
      Pendrill Varrier Jones, the man who had begun his great
      work with one patient and a hut in a back garden. The
      tragedy of the one had made him comprehend the tragedy of
      the many. A dark, lionlike head crowned with imagination
      and with pity. But what a strange thing that one man should
      set out to make money, while another gave himself to the
      remaking of men!
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir opened his eyes suddenly and turned to Mr. Briggs. Mr.
      Briggs was a lean, swarthy person with a sharp nose and one
      of those lower lips that associate itself with pithy and
      forcible language. He had his spectacles on his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What about work here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Briggs looked at Keir over the tops of his spectacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're an early worm, you are! Yes, there's plenty of work
      here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Employment for a carpenter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Briggs's lower lip protruded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say so. You wait till you see the cabinet and
      furniture shop. Reg'lar hive of industry, and all up to
      date. Then there are the fowl-houses and chalets, and what
      not. I'm going into leather."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leather?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was very ignorant, and Mr. Briggs enlightened him
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The turnover here last year was round about seventy
      thousand pounds. They make some of the best leather goods
      in the kingdom. Suitcases, attaché cases, trunks, bags.
      Yes, all started by the one and only Jones. He's a bit of a
      marvel. He's got vision, my lad, vision."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was examined next day by Dr. Stott. It was a very
      thorough examination, and Keir, feeling like a man on the
      edge of a precipice, watched the doctor's face for signs of
      hope. Would they be able to snatch him from the dark abyss
      or was it too late? Dr. Stott was sitting on the edge of
      Keir's bed and jotting down some notes on the case-sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir did not want to be a nuisance; he did not want to
      appear afraid, but that question quivered on his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has it spread, doctor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Stott looked at Keir kindly through his glasses. He had
      gone carefully into the history of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that right lung. Eat and sleep, my lad, and try not
      to worry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir smiled faintly. Was his case more desperate than he
      had feared, and was the doctor being kind to him? He asked
      no more questions. He watched Dr. Stott dealing with the
      other patients and tried to decide whether the doctor's
      manner was equally kind and brisk and impartial. Dr. Stott
      was jocular with Mr. Briggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to mark you for downstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Briggs's sallow face went quite pink.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the stuff to give me, sir. I'll soon be among the
      leather goods."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Stott laughed. He approved of such spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later Miss Borne came to Keir's bed, and Keir, looking up
      into her rosy, solid, and reassuring face, wanted to ask
      her a question. His eyes were hungry, and Miss Borne had
      lived for years with such eyes. She understood the secret
      hopes and the secret anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Matron, may I write home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What--what may I say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Borne had had many such poignant questions asked her.
      They were asked at times by men and women to whom it was
      impossible to hold out hope. But in Keir's case the problem
      was not quite so pathetic. She had spoken to Dr. Stott
      concerning him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tell your wife we are quite pleased with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then--the doctor--thinks--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are still an early case."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir seemed to draw a deep breath. His head sank back on
      the pillow. He smiled at Miss Borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, Matron."
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The morning sun poured into the ward, and all the world was
      green.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the bed next to Keir a new patient, a lad with a thin,
      flushed face, had been coughing incessantly, and his
      distress had worried Keir. He was moved both to pity and to
      impatience. This other man's suffering was so much his, a
      distraction and a reminder, a discord in the song of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coughing had ceased. It was replaced by another sound,
      a sound that made Keir look sharply at his neighbour. The
      new kid was blubbing, and though he had buried his face in
      the pillow, the sound could not be smothered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was moved. Had he not suffered that anguish of
      hopelessness when the heart of man dissolves into despair?
      He stretched out a hand, but he was not near enough to
      touch the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kid, don't take on like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      The other's shoulders shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm done for. I'll never get better."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Borne and the doctor came into the ward, and Miss
      Borne's blue eyes were quick to see that tragic, weeping
      child. She went instantly to the lad's bed. She was
      consoling, kind, firm. She sat on a chair beside him, and
      spoke to him like some mother and nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Stott had left her the occasion. She was the woman for
      it. He went to Keir's bed and with that little quiet smile
      of his looked at Keir as though he was concealing a gift
      behind his back. "Now, then, let's have another look at
      you." A fortnight had passed since Keir's admission, and he
      would have said that the life-clock within him was ticking
      more strongly. Dr. Stott looked and listened. Keir's chart
      was showing open water, and the weather was fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll mark you for downstairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's face flushed up just as Mr. Briggs's had done. He
      was suddenly more conscious of the sun and of that green
      world beyond the windows. He was a little breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad, doctor."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't get excited. Take it easy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Stott smiled and passed on, and Keir, full of his own
      secret exultation, remembered the lad in the next bed. He
      was lying quite still now and watching Miss Borne, who had
      joined the doctor. He watched her as though her solid
      wholesomeness symbolized life and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cheer up, kid. You'll be going downstairs soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad turned and smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't she a marvel! Sorry I was such a--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't you worry. We all of us go through that."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Keir, promoted downwards, which is the right kind of
      promotion at Papworth, found himself and his bed in a sunny
      ground-floor ward with the green grass at his feet, and the
      trees full of the sunlight. In the little lake at the
      bottom of the lawn two swans were busy rearing a family,
      and Father Swan patrolled the purlieus and advanced
      menacingly upon all intruders. Dr. Stott was the only
      person who could deal with him. Dr. Stott's laboratory
      stood near the lake, and Dr. Stott's comings and goings
      could not be left at the mercy of so feathered and fussy a
      father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's world had enlarged itself. No longer did it seem
      bounded by four walls. He was out in the air by day; he was
      part of the spring, of the green insurgence of the year.
      The thorns and the laburnums were in flower. Birds sang,
      and in his letters to Sybil there was an echo of this
      singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt at ease with his neighbours, and in a hospital
      neighbours are like the poor, always in evidence. On his
      right hand he had an old fellow who was known as Dad, or
      William the Silent. Dad had been a night-watchman in a
      London warehouse, sleeping by day and keeping himself
      company at night, and his tongue had rusted up. Report had
      it that he became conversational only in the company of a
      cat, the warehouse cat having been his sole companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Keir's right lay Jannis, the dark, sallow, sensitive
      Jannis, with brown eyes that looked black. His had been a
      desperate case, and even Miss Borne had felt gloomy about
      him, but Jannis had refused to die. He had a wife and child
      parked somewhere in a London suburb. He had made up his
      mind that they were to join him at Papworth, nor was his
      sanguine courage the illusion of the consumptive. He was
      doing well; he would do better.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, been deflated?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Keir had had the needle. His lung tissue had been put
      to rest. He and Jannis were much alike in temperament. They
      swapped books and ideas and opinions, and shared a kindred
      philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis told Keir his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We had been married just a year, and our kid had come when
      the trouble started. I was a clerk in an insurance office.
      I had to go to a 'san,' and my wife got a job as a waitress
      in a tea-shop. We had to sell our furniture, the precious
      furniture we had bought only a year ago. Worried? You bet I
      was, but I did quite well at the 'san.' They sent me out at
      the end of six months, and I went back feeling full of
      beans. Well--I got a facer. The company wouldn't take me
      back. Against their regulations--or something. I tell you I
      felt down and out. One of the unemployables. I got a
      half-time job as a kind of cheap tout for a firm who worked
      on the instalment system. It was the middle of winter. I
      may say that my underclothing and my boots weren't exactly
      O.K. And my meals--rather the bun and glass of milk
      business. In three months I was down again. I tell you I
      felt like going off the Embankment. A parson in town told
      me of this place, and here I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      His case was so like Keir's. Half the cases in Papworth
      were like the cases of Jannis and Smith.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your wife doing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, just carrying on. Keeping the kid and herself, and
      paying for the storing of the furniture left to us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine's doing just the same. Some women have some stuff in
      them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By George, haven't they! That's why I mean to fight for
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Jannis laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If there's somebody waiting, it makes a difference. Ask
      Father William. He's wanting to go back to the warehouse
      cat."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis explained that his wife could visit him only once in
      six weeks. Yes, the train-fare was the problem, and the
      lady who managed the tea-shop was a holy terror, spent a
      small income on beauty culture and cut wages to the bone.
      When a woman did drive a hard bargain, she drove it harder
      than a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I tell you, Smithie, I'll like to go and break up that
      tea-shop. No, Stella doesn't grouse. She makes a joke of
      the thing, but I know she lives in terror of losing the
      job. Life's such a scramble these days."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was more fortunate, for once a month the Lugard car
      was put at Sybil's service, and Joanna Mary was boarded out
      for the day with the kindly Browns. The drive was a long
      one, some hundred and fifty miles, with outer London to be
      negotiated, too long a drive for Joanna. At least, Sybil
      thought so. Joanna had a rather delicate tummy, and Sybil
      had grown nervous about the child. She dreaded lest Jo
      should have inherited her father's delicacy of tissue.
    </p>
    <p>
      When visiting-day came, Keir shaved himself very carefully
      and was quite fussy about his hair. The other men were
      gently amused. Keir might be preparing to receive his best
      girl instead of a wife. But Jannis understood. When you
      were up against things, sumptuous flappers ceased to
      interest you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil mingled breathlessness with dignity. The reunion was
      so much in public, but Jannis turned a considerate back on
      them, and Father William took cover behind a newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had no words for her, only eyes and hands. She sat and
      held his hands and gazed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, you--do--look better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I--am--better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You look fatter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I've put on eight and a half pounds. I'm behaving
      like a model case."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked searchingly at his wife. Was she doing too much?
      Would her strength and her courage stand the strain?
    </p>
    <p>
      "How are things, Syb?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I'm quite all right, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eating properly?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She produced something from her lap. Keir had noticed the
      offering, but he had not remarked on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Jo sent you these. She picked them herself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Out of the garden?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir put the flowers to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll have to have a garden here, Syb. You and Jo can't
      get on without a garden. You tell Jo that."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      There was a race between Keir and Jannis as to who should
      be the first to be promoted publicly and officially to
      trousers, and Keir won the race by a fortnight. His
      condition had been less serious than Jannis's, and, being a
      manual worker, he had more stamina than the clerk. He was
      absurdly proud of his new state. He was eager to do things,
      to be allowed to help, as all Papworth helped when it was
      able. Never had he been so pleased to be on his own feet.
      The world of nature had been a kind of tapestry hung about
      his bed, a two-dimensional world, but now it was a world of
      three dimensions. It had depth for him. It could be
      explored and penetrated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said to himself: "I'm up, yes, up," but if his tail was
      more erect, he did not parade with arrogance before Jannis
      and Father William.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll soon be shedding pyjamas, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      He said this gently to Jannis. Such things could not be
      said to William the Silent, for "Dad" was not making
      progress. In fact he was slipping back, and never again
      would the warehouse cat rub against his legs. William knew
      it; his neighbours knew it, but the illusion of life was
      not shattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir asked when he would be allowed to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm fit for something now, Matron."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was the wise autocrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wait a week or so and feel your feet. Go and play
      billiards for half an hour and see how you feel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir could not play the game, but another patient offered
      to give him a lesson, and after Keir had walked round and
      round the table for ten minutes and tried pot-shots at
      everything and nothing, his urge towards activity deserted
      him. He was so shaky that the cue was his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I'll have to sit down for a while."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in the doorway and was content to look at the
      grass and the trees while the other fellow practised
      breaks. Miss Borne had been quite right. The spirit might
      be willing, but the flesh was weak. He would have to go
      gently. And Miss Borne, happening upon him there, saw that
      he had discovered his limitations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will go and lie down after dinner, Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, Matron."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of another week, after light exercise and
      potterings about the grounds, he felt that he would soon be
      fit for work, and work would have a significance and a
      usefulness. He would be active; helping. By some people it
      was held that Papworth is an experiment in socialism. It is
      not. The more intelligent of the inmates become wise as to
      the significance of this community. It signifies service,
      that service which the socialists preach while confining
      its practice to a clique. Papworth is communal to a point,
      and utterly individual beyond that point. Individual effort
      matters. Men have to help to save themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had not yet been down into the village, where other
      men who had passed through the crisis were at work. In
      theory there was equality, or equality of opportunity,
      here, yet Papworth produced the same inevitable social
      pattern that refuses to be dyed a universal red. It was
      both a blending and a contrast of colours. Some of the
      patients who passed out into Papworth's working world
      became managers and foremen or skilled hands; others were
      content to remain mere hammerers of nails. The individual
      flowered according to his faculties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir the convalescent somehow avoided that working world.
      It lay there in the valley below him, its roofs showing
      amid the trees. It tantalized him. It was the world towards
      which the hope within him yearned, but he was so
      desperately afraid of hoping for too much and too
      prematurely. He had not forgotten that other relapse. And
      so he kept to the hill upon which the white hall stood, and
      if he wandered down the avenue of limes, he did not go
      beyond the gate. A voice within him said: "So far and no
      farther. Possess your soul in patience."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made many friends. He visited the other patients in
      their chalets. Soon he might be promoted to a chalet. He
      was looking forward to being the possessor of one of those
      little huts where he could gather his possessions round him
      and be alone sometimes with himself. He discovered many
      other men who felt about it just as he did. He noticed
      their books and photographs, simple things that satisfied
      the individual instinct and suggested the apartness of a
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a laconic, one-eyed patient put it: "A chap likes to be
      by himself sometimes. If you snore at night, no one's got a
      grievance. My little wooden hut does me proud."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was strolling one summer evening along one of the
      paths, and he paused to look at a very old oak tree that
      must have stood upon this hill before Papworth Hall had
      come into being. He was conscious of a presence. He turned
      and saw the creator of Papworth walking towards him over
      the grass. Sir Pendrill was passing from his bungalow among
      the trees to the big white building where he worked. But
      for a moment the one and only Jones was away in another
      world, and Keir found himself looking at the face of a man
      who dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had a feeling that he wished to efface himself, to
      stand aside and suffer this other man to pass without
      thrusting his own presence upon him. Sir Pendrill had much
      to carry in that big head and upon those broad shoulders.
      He was responsible for a whole community. He was Atlas
      bearing his own particular world. But Sir Pendrill saw Keir
      and came out of his abstraction to speak to him. He smiled
      at Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear you are doing well, Smith. That's splendid."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir flushed up like a sensitive boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were many things that Keir could have said to Sir
      Pendrill. He could have poured his heart out in gratitude
      to this other man, but he was shy. And all that he did say
      was: "You must have a wonderful memory, sir." Sir Pendrill
      smiled at him as though he divined something of Keir's
      feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not quite so good as it was, Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed on. But Keir stood and looked again at the oak
      tree. Who had planted it? But did it matter? Sir Pendrill
      had planted a tree here whose roots went deep into the warm
      earth of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir took his first walk in the village. He followed the
      meadow road from the Hall which brought him to the big
      building where chicken-houses, sheds, chalets, and garden
      houses were manufactured. This big building was open to the
      south, and in it scores of men were at work, assembling the
      sections. Towards the main road stood the timber-store,
      with the machine-shop next to it, so that the raw material
      was brought in, machined, and passed to the
      assembling-shed. It was all very efficient and workmanlike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's bowels yearned in him. He smelled again the smell of
      timber and of sawdust, perfumes that impregnated his whole
      working consciousness. He went in and touched some of the
      timber, the deals and battens, and it was like touching the
      hand of a friend. In the machine-shop he bent down and
      scooped up some sawdust into his palm and held the stuff to
      his nostrils. By George, how good it was, like the smell of
      the warm soil after rain to the worker upon the land! He
      slipped that little pile of white dust into his pocket so
      that most significant and reassuring perfume should remain
      with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this new and clean white wood, how lovely it was! He
      examined some of the houses and sheds that were being
      assembled. He spoke to a tall thin man who was working at a
      bench fitting a section of a building into a jig.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem pretty well organized here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it's all a system."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was this your job before you came here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked amused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I was in the City Police."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nailing timber instead of nailing narks! You look pretty
      well on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am. I have my wife and two kids in one of the cottages.
      My eldest won a scholarship at Cambridge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's pretty good. Must make a difference having your
      kids with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say so. It's like this: if you ever feel you are
      a bit finished, you can concentrate on the kids, watch 'em
      grow up and make good. I'm lucky. My kids have never been
      any trouble to me. Well, you see, my missus is one of the
      old sort. She likes being at home."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir made his way out to the main road and discovered the
      village shop. The manager of the shop was an
      ex-consumptive. Keir went in and bought a packet of
      chocolate to send to Joanna Mary. He saw a little
      tea-garden under the trees next the shop, for the use of
      the colonists and their friends. He wandered up the field
      road past the new men's hostel and the women's hostel
      towards the church, and in the meadow he sighted tennis
      courts. Even this most popular of games was provided for at
      Papworth. On the brow of the hill stood the nurses' hostel,
      Miss Borne's pet pride; and in the deep green valley
      beyond, an old farmstead spread its roofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir wandered back to the main road. There was so much more
      to be explored, the new and handsome village hall in which
      picture-shows and dances were given and in which the colony
      met as a community. Nearly opposite it was another hostel
      for men, and the furniture factory. Keir had been told that
      he might visit the factory. Patients who hoped to be able
      to work were encouraged to consider and select an
      occupation, unless, of course, a man's previous training
      marked him out for some particular job. Keir, making his
      way into the building, chanced upon Mr. Jarrett, the
      manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you want, my lad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir explained himself and his purpose. He was a trained
      craftsman. Yes, he had done cabinet work.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All right, have a look round."
    </p>
    <p>
      The factory fascinated Keir. The very latest machinery had
      been installed in the machine-room for sawing and planing
      and rebating. There was even a queer machine for
      sandpapering the wood, a machine that dealt with and
      extracted its own dust. From the machine-room the timber
      passed to the fitting-room, where a number of men were
      assembling the various articles. Beyond it lay the
      finishing-room and the show- and store-room where the
      products were exhibited, and Keir was astonished at the
      finish and the quality of the work. He examined beautiful
      walnut and mahogany specimen pieces, sideboards, bureaus,
      bookcases. His eyes lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the packing department he fell in again with Mr.
      Jarrett, and Mr. Jarrett, who had an eye for a man and for
      business, nailed Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever done any veneering?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, Keir had. It had been a hobby of his, and he had the
      hands for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have one first-class chap. He was a farm labourer
      before he came here. We could do with another."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd like to try."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, you go and get passed fit as soon as you can.
      There's good money to be made here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir wandered out again and on up the main road. He found
      himself scrutinizing the Papworth cottages set in their
      gardens on the banks above the road. Some of them were
      detached, others semi-detached, neat little red buildings
      amid trees and flowers. Someone had told him that a
      Papworth cottage could be rented for seven and six or nine
      and six a week.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood and looked at the garden of a particular cottage.
      It was full of summer flowers, snapdragons, and marigolds,
      clarkia and lavatera, phloxes and sweet peas. A young woman
      in a light blue linen dress was at work in it, and he
      thought: "It might be Sybil, and Jo with her wheelbarrow.
      Please God, I'm going to get well."

    <p>
      Sybil had trials of her own, and had she been asked to
      select the sin against the Holy Ghost, she would have
      identified it with meanness, especially that meanness that
      walks hand in hand with self-indulgence. She could cope
      with a Mr. Brown who showed signs of becoming sentimental
      and silly about her, for Mr. Brown was a sensitive creature
      and easily put out of countenance. Mrs. Lugard had
      recommended her as housemaid-help to two middle-aged
      suburban ladies with pink and brassy faces, the Misses
      Twine. The Misses Twine still saw themselves as girls. They
      were dressy, bridgy, golfy, slangy women who drove about in
      an electric blue car and spent money freely. They were the
      kind of women who talk in theatres and during concerts and
      found the world full of impatience and were full of a loud
      self-satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Lugard had said: "I don't know them very well, Sybil,
      but they are supposed to be good sorts."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Misses Twine may have gained that reputation because
      they were so good to themselves and to numbers of casual
      and vicarious men. They called their house "Westward Ho,"
      and it was always prepared with little drinks and
      cigarettes and large chairs. It was a kind of club for the
      adventitious male. The Misses Twine were known familiarly
      as Billy and Tilly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil soon discovered that the cook and the housemaid at
      Westward Ho had other views upon the subject. The cook was
      the sixth cook the Misses Twine had engaged in the space of
      two years, and she was ripe for the harvest. She was a
      rather stout and decent body who liked to stay put, if life
      would allow her to be static.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Misses Twine locked up the store-cupboard and the
      little corner cupboard in the drawing-room that contained
      numberless bottles for the preparing of cocktails. The
      kitchen was run on severely economic lines. Billy Twine
      always checked the tradesmen's books. People were so ready
      to do you.
    </p>
    <p>
      But cook did like her cup of coffee in the middle of the
      morning. She did not see why she should not have her cup of
      coffee when Alice could carry to her housemaid's pantry all
      those cocktail glasses to be washed. Gin and bitters and
      benedictine and vermouth and crème de menthe and what not!
      Cook ordered her own special coffee. She and Alice and
      Sybil sat down to cups of coffee at eleven a.m. They began
      their working day at seven a.m., and sometimes it did not
      end till eleven in the evening. The Misses Twine dined many
      men. They breakfasted at nine-thirty or later, unless, of
      course, they had to be on the first tee at Worplesdon or
      St. George's Hill at ten-thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Billy discovered the coffee. There was a row about the
      coffee. To her sister Miss Billy spoke of "those three
      females guzzling in the middle of the morning." The
      drawing-room of "Westward Ho" became full of stridencies.
      Cook had been told that she could pay for her own coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cook went up and packed her trunk. Alice followed her. They
      had the impertinence to use the Twine telephone and to ring
      up a taxi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cook, who was quite a good-tempered person, was heard to
      say: "I have had enough of these two old balls of string."
    </p>
    <p>
      They departed on the bosom of a final storm. The Misses
      Twine denied them their wages. They were leaving without
      proper notice, dishonouring their contract. No, not a
      penny! The Misses Twine were the injured parties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil, left cleaning silver in the pantry, heard those two
      distant and discordant voices uttering maledictions. The
      lower orders were impossible. They were sponging,
      peculating, insolent slackers. "It's the dole, my dear."
      But Miss Billy came in to Sybil; she cooed to Sybil. It was
      really very awkward. Miss Twine would say nothing about
      this dastardly desertion, but would Sybil assist them until
      further help could be obtained?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil explained that she was responsible for a bungalow and
      a child, and that she had other houses to go to. Miss Twine
      was sweetly persistent. Surely Sybil would consider them.
      She could abandon her other patronesses in such a crisis.
      Of course, the other people would understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil offered Miss Twine an additional day, one of her own
      days, but she could not disappoint her other ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Couldn't you come in for the week-end? We have visitors.
      It is so very awkward."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil had planned to go down to Papworth that Saturday.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm sorry, Miss Twine, but I am going to see my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Twine looked pained. Selfish, unaccommodating
      creature! Could not Sybil put off the visit for a week?
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil refused, and Miss Twine went off to send telegrams
      and to visit the local registry office. Really, life could
      be very exasperating. Eddie Black and Teddie Toogood had
      been coming down for the week-end, to play mixed foursomes
      at St. George's Hill. Oh, these women!
    </p>
    <p>
      But that was not the end of the story. Sybil gave the
      Misses Twine two days a week, and at the end of the third
      week Miss Tilly missed a green jade necklace. There was a
      tremendous pother about that necklace, and Sybil had been
      the only other person in the house. The registry office had
      been unable to provide service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy said to Tilly: "It must be Smith. I shouldn't have
      thought it of the woman."
    </p>
    <p>
      They went about with shut-up and accusing faces. It was
      obvious to Sybil that they suspected her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose she pinches things for that wretched husband of
      hers."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Billy Twine had an unpleasant laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not for husbands, my dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sybil had suffered sufficiently from the suspicious
      faces of the ladies, and then, on the very day when she was
      preparing her ultimatum, she found the necklace. It had
      slipped into the deep crevice at the back of a Chesterfield
      sofa.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil ran up to Miss Tilly's bedroom. Miss Tilly was
      resting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've found the necklace, miss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "At the back of the sofa."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Tilly was sceptical, polite, and rather abrupt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That must be a relief to you, Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil stood and stared at Miss Tilly Twine. Then she went
      downstairs, put on her things, and walked out of the house.
      The mean, suspicious beasts! She was owed fifteen shillings
      for two days' work, and she never received the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tilly said to Billy: "Well, she was lucky to get off, and
      she knows it. I suppose she grew windy about the thing. I
      had suggested having the police in."
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was that.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      But at Papworth Sybil forgot the Misses Twine, and even if
      she had not forgotten them, she would not have resurrected
      the ladies for the troubling of Keir. The Lugards and their
      car were absent in Scotland, and Sybil had had to travel by
      train. She had pawned her best electroplated spoons to
      provide her railway fare, for the loss of those fifteen
      shillings had run her short. She had left Kingham at an
      unconscionable hour in the morning, and she would return to
      Kingham about midnight. Meanwhile she sat with Keir under
      the trees in the tea-garden next the village shop, and the
      shadows flickered over her face and her blue frock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir thought her looking rather thin and tired, but he had
      good news to give her. He had been like a man floundering
      in a marsh, and gradually, in his struggle with the sucking
      slime, he had felt the ground growing firm under his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Stott overhauled me yesterday. Everything's quiet
      inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had insisted on Sybil having eggs for her tea. As a
      patient he was entitled to a little pocket-money, and he
      had saved up his pennies to pay for that tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--Keir--!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was all she could say. She clutched his hand. They
      shared a moment of exquisite emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have some jam, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've only just finished my eggs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must have some jam. It's real good stuff, strawberry."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed the dish towards her and watched her help
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, more than that. Tuck into it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's real fruit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, none of your turnip and aniline dye. You're looking a
      little on the thin side, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I'm all right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look here, we've got to talk about things, Syb. I asked
      Dr. Stott's advice. He told me that if I keep on as I am, I
      may be able to do light work in three months. There's a job
      ready for me in the furniture shop. But--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched his wife's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a life's job. I mean, Syb, that if I stay here and
      work at easy pressure and don't have to rush it with men
      who--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked him straight in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, Keir, I understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would mean--that you and Jo--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She helped herself to more jam. She knew that it pleased
      him to see her enjoying the jam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can we get a cottage here, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed to breathe more easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, in time. Then--you won't mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it's a lovely place."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have concerts and picture-shows and dances. And there's
      a tennis club, and a gardening club. The flower show is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your idea of jam, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but some women have queer ideas about the country. It
      would worry me to feel--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't worry, Keir. Don't you know that I--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know you're about the best pal a man ever had."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's God's truth. But, look here, we shall have to do
      something about 'Merrow.' Wouldn't it be easier for you in
      rooms until I have made a home here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We could store the furniture."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, and you would have a little money in hand. The place
      should fetch more than the mortgage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I think it over, Keir? Lodgings, you know--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do know. It's only that I want to save you worry and
      work."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I shan't worry so long as you are getting better. And they
      do rook you in lodgings, Keir, and there is always trouble
      about cooking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, do just what you like. I want to have a stroll and
      show you some of the cottages. There's a school here for Jo
      to go to. No, not a single kid in Papworth has developed
      consumption. They are a healthy crowd."
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife's face lit up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir showed his wife over the settlement, and though Sybil
      was impressed by the largeness of the village hall, she was
      chiefly interested in the Papworth cottages. She preferred
      those higher up the hill, standing well about the ancient
      Ermyn Street, with their gardens backing upon a meadow.
      From the garden you could look across at the white hall and
      its trees and a crowd of little chalets that had the
      appearance of a flock of chicken-houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil hung over fences and gates and admired the flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the rent, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "About seven and six and nine and six a week, rates
      included."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think what we paid at Paragon Place! And if you are able
      to work--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir knew that his wife was doing sums in her head. He
      recognized that domestic and contriving expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might earn nine or ten bob a day. You see, we are not
      allowed to do an eight-hour day. Six is the limit, and the
      idea is quite sound."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nearly three pounds a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil nodded her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could manage very well on that. We could even put a
      little money by. Holidays, you know. Do they have holidays
      at Papworth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rather. Just like anybody else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil gazed longingly at the cottages. Her desire was to
      explore the interior of one of these hypothetical homes,
      and her desire was satisfied. A woman, emerging from behind
      a row of sweet peas, came face to face with Sybil, and
      friendly glances were exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Sybil: "Please don't think us rude for looking over
      your fence like this--but your garden's a picture."
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardener was pleased. Had she not taken a prize for her
      sweet peas at last year's Papworth flower show!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lovely things, aren't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never seen better. Yes, my husband is a patient here.
      We hope to have a cottage some day. They look such nice
      cottages."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil's hint was naïve and appealing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you like to look over one?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd love to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, come inside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I--really? It is kind of you. Do come, Keir. You ought
      to see it too."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir attained to his chalet, and with it he was given a
      little light work in the garden for the sake of exercise
      and as a physical test. He weeded, and picked fruit, and
      for two months he received no pay for his work. He did not
      expect to be paid for it. He regarded it as part of his
      treatment, exercise in the open air for the benefit of the
      body and soul. He was glad of the work. His hands were in
      contact with the soil, and if he still kept that pinch of
      sawdust in his pocket, that too was elemental and good. He
      was coming to understand the spirit of Papworth, the large
      and beneficent wisdom that lifted a man up and set him on
      his feet and watched over him. "Friend, help to heal
      thyself." If Papworth set you a task, there was reason in
      its pragmatism, gentle exercise for heart and head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Keir found one or two men who grumbled, men who were so
      steeped in the modern cult of doing as little as possible
      for as much as they could get that when a wise management
      found them occupation, they resented it. They groused; they
      loafed. They were being exploited. They were doing work for
      Papworth, and Papworth was not paying them anything for it.
      Yes, they were being exploited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had an argument with one of these gentlemen in a
      corner of the walled garden where they were weeding an
      onion bed. The gentleman said that Papworth--like all
      institutions--was run by a lot of ---- toffs. Oh, yes,
      hadn't Keir seen the toffs who came down in swank cars and
      patronized the place? It was like a ---- zoo, and the
      patients were just so many animals in cages for the toffs
      to stare at. Making a chap work, using him, and not giving
      him a ---- penny for it. Fourpence a day pocket-money! The
      sanguinary ramp ought to be exposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir grew hot. He felt contempt for this awkward, stupid
      beast who was being given his chance to live, and who would
      have regarded God with suspicion if God had set him to
      gather fruit in Eden.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--why don't you clear out? There's nothing to stop you
      from going?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow took Keir literally. He said that he would see
      Jones and have it out with him. He seemed to regard Sir
      Pendrill as the eternal boss. And if he did not get any
      satisfaction out of Jones, he would write to the <i>Daily
      Wail</i> and show the place up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir let fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One doesn't expect gratitude from people, but one does ask
      for sense. You get housed and fed and doctored and a chance
      to live, and you think you're exploited. What the devil do
      you think they get out of a chap like you? What does
      society get out of a chap like you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man flared.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mind your ---- business. Who asked you--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, shut up," said Keir; "some of you fellows make me
      sick. You don't know a weed from an onion. Aren't you
      getting your chance here? Where else would you get it? Why
      should a man like Sir Pendrill trouble--? Oh, yes, just
      because he's big, and you don't understand that sort of
      thing. Some of you never will understand it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was told that he was one of the blighters who sucked
      up to the toffs. "After a soft job, are you?" But Keir had
      said his say. You might lay into an ass of this order for
      ever and ever, and he would just bray at you. Keir removed
      himself to the other end of the onion bed and worked alone
      and in peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved his little chalet. It was individual, and somehow
      his, and it was so pleasant to blow out the candle at night
      and to know you were alone. No chatter, no fool noises, for
      Keir's neighbours in the adjoining chalets loved peace as
      much as he did. Sickness and suffering soften and civilize
      man unless he is made of that poor pulp which turns sour
      and rotten. If there was any quality of fineness in a
      character, it was tempered here.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes the wind made a murmuring in the eaves of the
      little building. Doors and windows were open and let in the
      stars. Keir did quite a lot of star-gazing. The Great Bear
      and Orion were part of his new world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was resting on his bed one afternoon after tea when
      Jannis appeared. Jannis was up and allowed light exercise,
      but his face was still the colour of fine vellum. He sat
      down on the top step of Keir's chalet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had just been reading a letter from Sybil. It
      contained a singular piece of news. Messrs. Samson, Hoad
      &amp; Gott had called their creditors together.

      "You're looking pretty cheerful, K. Good news?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir raised himself on one elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose it shouldn't be, but it is. My old firm have
      gone smash."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you're bucked about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I suppose it's human nature, but the man who spoilt
      my best chance in life has gone smash with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're a good hater, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am. Hasn't one the right to hate the mean things and to
      love the good things? Don't let's humbug ourselves about
      universal love."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis stroked the back of his very black and sleek head.
      It was a characteristic gesture of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well--I don't know. I felt rather like blowing up my old
      company when they shut me out in the cold, but there are
      all the other fellows to remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, that's true, the other fellows and their wives."

      Probably Dr. Stott would have said that it is very
      necessary to study a patient's temperament as well as his
      simpler physical reactions, though in that very complex
      creature--man--the balance may be turned by a rose leaf.
      Dr. Stott was responsible for the Papworth children, and he
      liked to observe them in a state of nature, splashing in an
      open-air swimming-pool. The young animal exhibited itself
      revealingly to the expert's eye. It might be well fleshed
      and vital and active, or sensitive and shy and needing a
      delicate touch. Sensitive tissue might imply a sensitive
      spirit. Dr. Stott read his Keir both as a body and as a
      man. He saw in Keir a worker who was yearning to use his
      hands. Keir belonged to that particular type, the lean,
      intense, and somewhat separative people in whom the passion
      to do and to create is dominant. He would never be the
      cheerful loafer, the gentleman of the pub and the street
      corner, ingeniously otiose, and active only under the eye
      of the foreman or the boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am going to have you 'boarded,' Smith. I think you are
      one of the men who are better working."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will it be, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Next week. But I want to impress upon you the need for
      caution. Don't rush at your job like a dog let off the
      chain."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I've learnt wisdom, sir. I've had my lesson."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was "boarded" in the library, that same room in which
      he and Sybil had said good-bye to each other, and the
      spirit of his wife seemed with him. The examination was
      very thorough, and an hour or so later Keir heard the
      verdict. It was announced to him by Dr. Stott.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We are going to try you in the furniture shop. I had a
      talk with Mr. Jarrett about you. Two hours a day for a
      fortnight--as an experiment. If you pass that test, we'll
      make you a four-and-a-half-hour man."
    </p>
    <p>
      So once again Keir went to work. He was to retain his
      chalet until he had taken his place on the pay-roll as a
      four-and-a-half-hour man. Then he would be transferred to
      one of the sanatorium block chalets. He walked down the
      avenue of lime trees on a sunny September morning and he
      was as nervous and as excited as a lad up for his first
      examination. The adventure of living and working was once
      more his. He was a man, not a poor derelict, a human hulk
      rotting in some back street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reported to Mr. Jarrett.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo. I was expecting you, my lad. Two hours' light work.
      Right you are. I've got a job for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He led Keir to a bench and showed him the face of a drawer
      that was to be veneered with walnut. Keir could try his
      hands on that, and if he needed any help or advice, Mason
      would give it him. Mason was the shop's expert, a dark,
      quiet lad, a little god in his own craft, but not a jealous
      god.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would rather try on my own, if I may?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's the spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarrett left him to work out his own salvation and to
      settle himself in with his neighbours. The atmosphere of
      the workshop was cheerful and friendly. A new man was not
      regarded as an interloper, but as a useful member of the
      community who would assist in making Papworth and himself
      financially self-supporting. That was the crux of the whole
      problem. A community such as Papworth could not crucify
      itself on the cross of ca' canny.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was nervous. He was so afraid of bungling that first
      job. He dreaded lest his hands should have lost their
      cunning. In the old days he had had the touch for such
      work. He would have made a very capable surgeon. And this
      film of wood that had to be cut and glued to the face of
      the drawer could so easily fool a man whose hands trembled,
      and Keir's hands did tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone came and watched him, and Keir wished the fellow
      would go away. He did go away. It was Mason, the expert;
      and Mason, being a sensitive lad, saw that Keir was best
      left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir's hands trembled. This would not do! If he got this
      film of wood kinked or crooked, both he and Mr. Jarrett
      would be able to say that he had made an unholy mess of the
      job. But how absurd this panic! He could feel his heart
      beating hard and fast. He paused. He leaned against the
      bench and then went for a stroll down the shop. He watched
      a big, fair man placidly assembling an oak bedside cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man smiled at Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Christmas present for Jerry."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Keir laughed, and with his laughter the spirit of his
      fear seemed to depart like some exorcized demon. Laughter
      was good. Man was the only living creature who could laugh.
      He felt that his hands had become steady and sure. He went
      back to his bench. He smiled at that oblong panel of
      veneer. He thought of one of those cottages, and of Sybil
      and Joanna Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      His hands dealt deftly with the film of walnut. It spread
      itself and sat down and adhered to the face of the drawer
      like a young skin without wrinkles. The crisis was over.
      Keir stood and contemplated his handiwork, and the panic
      mood of half an hour ago. That a man should be afraid of a
      piece of wood! Well, had he not read of authors being
      afraid of their pens, and of eminent pianists perspiring as
      they sat down on a platform and placed their fingers on the
      keys? If you did not fear to mar the exquisite quality of
      your craft, you would never make a craftsman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarrett, walking through the shop, stopped at Keir's
      bench and examined the face of the drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's not so bad, lad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll pass it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should say so."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Jarrett was a Yorkshireman, and laconic, but Keir could
      judge by the quality of the finished articles in the
      showroom that Mr. Jarrett did not pass dud work. Keir's
      hands had made good.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      For a fortnight Keir worked two hours a day in the
      furniture shop, and at the end of the fourteen days Dr.
      Stott re-examined him. The verdict was wholly in Keir's
      favour. There was not a moist sound to be heard in his
      chest, and the disease appeared to have been arrested. He
      had put on weight, and he was eating and sleeping well.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You managed the two hours--comfortably?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll mark you up as a four-and-a-half-hour man. I'm very
      pleased with you, Smith."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was buttoning up his shirt. He had something to say to
      Dr. Stott.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm very glad, sir. Of course, you know that what makes
      all the difference here--is--that one isn't worried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, we do know that, Smith. That's part of our
      philosophy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think it is the worry that helps to kill many men, sir.
      Black fear, a horrible sense of insecurity, the feeling
      that when you have been patched up, you will be pushed out
      into the world again to sink or swim."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Most of them sink."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir nodded. He had been up to the lips in that hopeless
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which means, sir, that man does not live on a bottle of
      medicine. Mind is at the back of everything, your mind, my
      mind, Sir Pendrill's mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mind--plus something else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes--I know. Compassion."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Keir was given his bench in the cabinet shop, and became
      a four-and-a-half-hour man. Mr. Jarrett experimented with
      Keir; he assigned him some simple cabinet work, and when he
      was sure of the craftsman in Keir, he put him on to the
      more delicate and intricate work. The shop had received an
      order for a suite of dining-room furniture in walnut:
      sideboard, table, six chairs, and a bookcase bureau. Keir
      was promoted to be Mason's assistant and understudy in the
      veneering. It was a ticklish job covering a large surface
      like that of a sideboard, and sometimes the "shop" would
      pause to watch Mason and Keir handling those delicate
      sheets, but both Mason and Keir were so much part of their
      work that they were quite unconscious of being watched.
      Both of them were dark, intense, slim-built men. Sometimes
      when bending together over the work, their heads seemed to
      touch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had no eyes for the clock, but sometimes he listened
      to the clock within himself. It ticked rhythmically and
      steadily, and little by little his confidence returned.
      Papworth had given a new temper to his mainspring, and it
      showed no signs of failing. At the end of his four and a
      half hours he was a little tired, but happily so, and for
      the remainder of the day he could rest and read or walk. He
      took a daily tramp of three miles. It was autumn and the
      trees were changing colour, and in this golden world he
      found a new beauty and a new consolation. It was autumn,
      and winter was coming, but he could count upon the spring.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>
      3
    </h1>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had to vacate his chalet. He was to undergo his test
      as a six-hour man and live in one of the hostels. He moved
      into what was known as the Old Hostel, a single-storied
      building on the west of the main road. The hostel contained
      a dining-room, a billiard-room, a games-room, two- and
      one-bed cubicles, and lavatories, and to Keir was assigned
      a bed in one of the two-bed cubicles. These little rooms
      were very simply furnished. Each bed was covered with a
      blue bedspread. The hostel humorist had suggested that each
      cubicle should have a white line down the centre of the
      floor, and that no occupant should park any of his
      possessions in the other fellow's territory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir shared his cubicle with a young man named Broster, who
      worked in the trunk shop, and Broster was the colony's
      special fellow-my-lad. Though he wore grey flannel trousers
      and a pull-over, these articles had an otherness that was
      Broster. Charlie Broster had one of those honey-coloured
      heads that appear to require infinite attention, and when
      Keir was dressed and ready for breakfast, Broster was still
      buttering his locks. A cheerful and casual and noisy young
      man, he whistled like a bird in the spring or burst into
      sudden song, and his voice was not as sleek as his head. He
      would be one of the last to leave the billiard or games
      room in the evening, and most certainly he was the last to
      leave his bed in the morning. A hostel--by the nature of
      things and character of its construction--is not padded
      against noise, and Broster was a noisy young devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hallo, Smithie, shall I kiss you good night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, tucked up and trying to go to sleep, appreciated
      neither Broster's facetiousness nor his loitering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Get into bed, my lad, and have done with it."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Broster was always so very much awake, save in the
      workshop, and he wanted to lie in bed with the light on and
      read the paper. He made an extraordinary amount of noise
      crumpling and turning the pages of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the most cheerfully complacent young man, so
      thick-skinned with self-sufficiency that no hints
      penetrated. No one could criticize Broster--for to himself
      Broster was quite above criticism. On Saturday afternoons
      he would rush off to Cambridge and delight the girls. It
      was said that at Cambridge he posed as a member of the
      University, that he had purchased a second-hand cap and
      gown, and kept them at a friend's house and in them paraded
      the streets of Cambridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, Broster snored. He had suffered from adenoids as a
      child, and he snored--as he did everything else--with a
      breezy abandonment. Keir had discovered that when men are
      gathered in a close community, individual whimsies have to
      be suppressed. Tolerance and good temper became essential
      virtues. He could not heave a book at Broster because he
      snored. Broster's snoring was as inevitable as his coloured
      jersey, his buttered head, and his casual conceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bore with Broster's physical attributes for a month,
      largely because the hostel was full of such good
      fellowship, but he found it less easy to bear with
      Broster's philosophy. The fascinating of the feminine world
      may demand high finance, and Lothario valued himself at no
      mean figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Broster never had enough money. The world of Papworth did
      not reward him for his labours as he expected to be
      rewarded. Youth is so full of itself, so conscious of its
      infinite beauty and charm, that it expects society to press
      overflowing coffers upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jones must be making a pretty penny out of us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of them were lying in bed, and Keir, who wanted to go
      to sleep, was terse with his stable-companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How much do you think he makes out of you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They pay me a miserable thirty-six bob a week."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably they make a loss on it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was absurd, and Mr. Broster said so.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't you heard of surplus value, Smithie, the surplus
      labour creates and never gets? The capitalist pinches it."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a working economist Keir had delved deeper than young
      Broster, and as a practical man he had found that the
      socialist theories split upon the rock of human nature, the
      inevitable frivolities and laziness of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's your surplus, Broster?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just what I should like to know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So should I."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My argument is that a show like this ought to produce all
      the figures to the men: costs, profits--and what becomes of
      the profits."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And supposing your activities didn't show a profit?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Broster was too serenely sure of his social value.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't be silly, Smithie. Do you think my six hours a day
      aren't worth more than thirty-six bob?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir turned over and prepared for sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite possibly they're not. Switch the light off, my lad.
      The debate's closed."
    </p>
    <p>
      The paternal eyes of Papworth were not blind, and Charlie
      Broster's Saturday and Sunday pilgrimages to Cambridge were
      known to headquarters. The fatherly and responsible world
      spoke kindly but firmly to Broster by the mouth of one of
      the settlement doctors. He was warned against burning his
      torch as a fit man could burn it, but the youth in him was
      restive. They were treating him like a kid. Papworth wasn't
      a penal colony, and if a fellow could not have a bit of
      beano once a week, well--he might as well join the Church
      of England. All this moral tosh about the wisdom of
      continence! That sort of stuff was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was treated to Charlie's rhetoric. He could have told
      the lad that when a doctor gives you good advice for
      nothing, you might be the recipient of surplus value that
      was worth reflection, but he was tired of Charlie Broster.
      Youth could be so shallow and smart and heartless, the
      eternal Narcissus, and Keir, hearing from Jannis that
      he--Jannis--was moving into the New Hostel, managed to get
      himself transferred. He and the clerk set up house together
      happily in a rather superior sort of cubicle. Their moods
      and habits did not clash. They had outlived their
      crudities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir did not see the end of Charlie Broster. All that he
      heard was that poor Butter-head had suffered a relapse and
      had been returned to hospital. His own surplus value had
      become a minus quantity.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the older men who still used the vernacular spoke of
      Broster as a "Poor,--young fool." Keir did not think of the
      lad quite in that way. To him Broster was typical of youth,
      and especially so of modern youth. It resented discipline.
      It had been told so cleverly by the bright young men who
      wrote books that the superstition of self-restraint is as
      obsolete as the sacraments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Broster died during the winter. He passed away, just
      as youth's hot faith in its own cleverness passes away. The
      old fool--and the young fool! But if the old fool has
      reached sixty, his folly must be allowed some survival
      value. Keir's desire was to become one of the staid,
      sentimental industrious old fools.

    <p>
      As Keir read deeper and deeper into the pages of Papworth,
      he realized that it was not only a notable experiment in
      practical compassion, but also an essay on common sense.
      The wisdom and the vision that had made Papworth possible
      were reinforced by the plain common sense of the community.
      Men accepted that which had been self-evident for
      centuries, those human realities that a raucous and
      strutting idealism has attempted to ignore. A large and
      flabby Mrs. Slop ladling out treacle to her horde of pets,
      and brimstone to all the other children, was no goddess
      here. Her elevation of organized pilfering into a
      profession of faith may be nothing but an appeal to those
      very instincts in man which the Old Humbug pretends to
      deplore: to obtain power through preaching self-pity and a
      pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Plunder!
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir and Jannis, discussing life's realities in their
      cubicle, were agreed that life might be a rough business,
      but that men could not escape it by becoming sheep. As for
      the sheep community--you had to accept the sheep-dog and
      the shepherd. Common sense was at one with science in
      assuming that men differed. They differed in their
      hereditary outfit, in physical capacity, mental
      possibilities, and above all in character. One man might be
      of more value to the community than another. Why did one
      citizen become an expert surgeon, while his neighbour
      hacked holes in a road?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just privilege, just opportunity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis had a sense of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much of the modern cant, Keir, is just saving the faces
      of the unsuccessful. I suppose some people would say that
      we belong to the unsuccessful, but I'm damned if we do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, we seem to have held up the offensive of the T.B.
      bug. And we both have jobs that cannot be left to the
      casual and cheerful fool."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their tails were up, and an erect tail is to be encouraged
      in a community such as Papworth's not because Papworth ever
      indulged in dog-fights, but because courage and character
      and common sense are the blood and the bones and the brain
      of any community. Had not the one and only Jones set them
      the example? "To the bench, my merry men. Buckle to. Live
      and laugh and labour, and play. A community of talkers ends
      in tosh. Up, up, those who have the brains and the
      character and the skill. Let's to our benches, all of us!
      And if some show more wisdom and skill and character than
      others, let us not snarl at them. The victor is worth his
      laurel crown. The Greeks knew that more than two thousand
      years ago. They ceased to be Greeks when they forgot it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Papworth graded itself, and on the whole the common sense
      of the community accepted this grading. Papworth had a
      "Head," and it respected that head. It accepted managers
      and foremen and its skilled craftsmen. It accepted the
      common sense of capacity and the logic of the pay-sheet.
      For, as Jannis put it: "If a workshop reduces its capacity
      to the level of the least efficient worker, its standard of
      living is bound to get down among the sawdust. This isn't
      charity; it's common sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir became a six-hour-a-day man. He had ceased to be
      Mason's understudy; he was Mason's co-partner and comrade.
      By arranging their work together, by emulation and mutual
      help, they found that they could increase their output.
      Papworth benefited; so did their fellow-workers; so did
      they.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What we want here is capital, capital and yet more
      capital."
    </p>
    <p>
      Papworth hungered for capital. It lusted to expand. It
      needed capital for cottages, capital for hospital
      accommodation, capital for plant and raw material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir pinned a big C up over his bed. C stood for cottage,
      and Jannis chipped him about that C, declaring that it
      stood for covetousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which commandment was it, old lad? Thou shalt not covet
      thy neighbour's wife, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's
      car, nor his house, nor his War Loan, nor anything that is
      his. But that's not the creed of the day. Covet anything
      that the other fellow has that you haven't and tax him till
      he can't afford it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "C stands for capitalist and cottage, Jannis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall never be Rockefellers, Keir, but we can attain to
      a cottage. I hear there are another six to go up."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the waiting list?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dozen applicants--at least--and we come seventh and
      eighth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That means our waiting for another batch to be built."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There may be vacancies. But that means that some poor
      beggar has gone back to the sick-list. Get thee behind me,
      Satan! But I do wish some nice old lady would leave the
      show a whacking legacy ear-marked for the erection of
      cottage property. If people only knew--"
    </p>
    <p>
      For that was Papworth's problem, the problem which has
      energized all progressive communities that are building up
      instead of squandering, to produce its product, sell its
      product, and maintain a margin that could be used for the
      further benefit of the community. The colony had to carry
      its sick and its children, and its citizens were not men
      who could be worked at full pressure. But the quality of
      the work was admirable. It sold. The yearly turnover was
      increasing. Those who presided over the community's figures
      could say the settlement was paying its way; but for the
      expanding of hospital accommodation and the erection of
      houses for workers it still needed help from the outer
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      That help was provided. It flowed in quietly and
      generously, and yet Sir Pendrill, looking out from the
      windows of his enterprise, saw further than the roofs and
      the fields of Papworth. Papworth was like a theatre outside
      whose doors long queues waited. His urge was towards the
      creation of a theatre many times enlarged, over whose doors
      could be written: "Enter all ye who are sick and suffering
      and without hope."

    <p>
      Sybil came to Papworth on a Saturday, and a friend of
      Keir's in the "shop," hearing that Keir's wife had to
      travel to and fro from Kingham in the day, offered to put
      Sybil up for the week-end. The Theobalds had a cottage a
      hundred yards or so beyond the estate office, and Keir was
      grateful for their kindness. He would pay. Joanna Mary was
      to spend the week-end with the Browns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winter had come, and on the Saturday afternoon Keir and
      Sybil went out and walked. It was a day of frost and of
      stillness, with a clear sky and a westering sun that showed
      up the bare branches of the trees. Smoke climbed straight
      from cottage chimneys. The hedgerows had a sparkle in them,
      and the frost still lay in the shadows.
    </p>
    <p>
      A vital day. Keir was head in air. The tang of the day was
      on his lips, and health in his heels. He was walking faster
      than he knew, and his wife noticed it and was glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look at that smoke, Syb; it's quite blue."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at his alert and freshened face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it is. You can walk, Keir, now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at her with a sudden smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Going too fast for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No."
    </p>
    <p>
      They had come to a lane. It led to a wood in which the oak
      trees caught the winter sunlight. Their trunks were a
      greenish gold. There was a field-gate here and they leaned
      upon it, and suddenly Keir kissed his wife. It was a
      lover's kiss. Her dear, cold face had for him an exquisite
      softness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man wasn't made to live alone, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned against him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir, I wish I hadn't to go back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I, kid. It's just a question of waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a pity one can't move 'Merrow' here!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, if we could!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at the oak trees sheeted in the winter sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Keir--I've had an idea."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've been thinking that I might be able to get work at
      Cambridge. Jo and I could go into lodgings. I should be so
      much nearer. I could come over every week-end."
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her closer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Syb, that's a great idea. I'll ask somebody about it. We
      have visitors from Cambridge. There's Lady Isherwood,
      Professor Isherwood's wife. She's on the general
      committee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir appealed to Papworth's Dea Mater, Miss Borne, and Miss
      Borne's capacity for helping people was eminently
      practical. In her the community symbolized its supreme and
      kindly common sense. She found jobs for patients and
      sometimes paid for them out of her own pocket. A
      consumptive and bedridden girl was provided with
      drawing-lessons. A journalist handed his last articles to
      Miss Borne, who passed them to the editor of the Papworth
      magazine. Miss Borne's ambition included the building of a
      rest-house and home for retired nurses.
    </p>
    <p>
      She listened to Keir, an eager and rather apologetic Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't want to waste your time, Matron."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Borne was one of those busy but unflurried people who
      appear to have time for everything.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is it, Smith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's about my wife. She is wondering whether she could get
      work in Cambridge, so as to be nearer. Of course, we are
      hoping--in time--for a cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What kind of work?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Housework. She and the child could live in lodgings, and
      she could go out for the day. I'm able to help her now, but
      she is one of those who like work."
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Borne smiled her tight little shrewd smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How refreshing, Smith! It shouldn't be very difficult, I
      think. I'll ask some of our Cambridge friends when they
      come over to visit us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a fortnight the business was arranged. A firm of
      estate agents at Kingham found an immediate purchaser for
      "Merrow." The little place was sold at a profit, and Sybil,
      having consulted Mrs. Lugard, opened a joint account at the
      Westminster Bank. She and Keir had a credit of ninety-five
      pounds, three shillings, and fourpence. She was given a
      pass-book and a cheque-book. She arranged for the moving
      and the storing of the furniture, and on one December
      morning she said good-bye to the white bungalow and the
      beech tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shed a few tears over it, tears that Joanna Mary seemed
      to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can't they put it on wheels, mummy? I've seen awful big
      lorries as large as a house."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's somebody else's house, dear, now."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You haven't sold my wheelbarrow, mummy, have you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, dear. It's with the furniture. You'll want your
      wheelbarrow when we move into a new cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall I see daddy at Cambridge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll go over with me and see him. Of course. Oh, here's
      Mrs. Brown. She is coming to see us off at the station."
    </p>
    <p>
      One of Papworth's Cambridge friends not only had found
      Sybil four days' work a week, but had arranged lodgings for
      her in Mill Lane, in a cottage occupied by a college cook
      and his wife. Mill Lane, a tortuous little street, burrowed
      its way down to the river. Sybil's bedroom window looked
      towards the river and the "Backs," and she could see the
      tops of the great elm trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      She and Joanna Mary arrived on a Friday, and on the
      Saturday they went over to Papworth. Keir was waiting at
      the bus-halt, and Joanna, snatched by her father from the
      step, flung her arms round Keir's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, daddy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed the child almost with fierceness. He was getting
      something back from life, and to feel is to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Theobalds are giving us tea, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked through the village holding Joanna by the hand.
      He met friends and acquaintances, and some of them stopped
      and were introduced to Miss Smith. Joanna looked up at them
      with characteristic solemnity. It was an occasion, and she
      was conscious of it and of being somehow a little person of
      importance. Also, she was wearing a new hat and coat and
      shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm coming to live here soon."
    </p>
    <p>
      The various new friends smiled at her. Papworth was pleased
      to see its children.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      To Sybil, Cambridge was so very different from Kingham.
      Certainly, there were the same buses and motor-coaches and
      cars, the same crowded haste in the grey streets. Never had
      she seen so many bicycles or so many young men or so many
      solemn buildings. In her simplicity she divined a tradition
      here that still shuffled about the college courts like a
      very old man with cobwebs in his hair. Gentle cobwebs,
      gossamer, dust motes flickering in the sunlight. Sleek
      grass, old trees, the sound of bells, top-hatted porters at
      college gates, gowns, the organ-playing in King's College
      Chapel. And Woolworth's, and the International Stores, and
      the cinemas, and at night the eyes of young men searching
      the faces of the women.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna Mary settled down quite happily in Mill Lane. Mrs.
      Bland's children were out in the world, and the college
      cook's wife treated Joanna like a grandchild. Sometimes
      Joanna would walk a little way with her mother when Sybil
      went out to work, but Sybil was nervous about the traffic
      on the child's account, and she would not let Joanna come
      beyond a point where a road had to be crossed. There were
      so many bicycles, motor and foot-pedal, so many cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil was working as housemaid-help in three different
      houses, one a doctor's, the other two belonging to dons.
      The doctor lived near Corpus College, but the dons' houses
      were as widely apart as the mental make-up of their
      occupants. Professor Tinsley, a disciple of Einstein's,
      lived in a terrace house not far from the Botanical
      Gardens. Mr. Fortescue, a humanist and a classicist of the
      classicists, preferred one of the houses beyond the
      "Backs." Even though the new world regarded Tennyson as an
      obsolete and succulent platitudinarian, Mr. Fortescue still
      thought in terms of immemorial elms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil preferred the Fortescue house to work in. It was easy
      and unhurried, and rather untidy and unpunctual, and full
      of books and odd furniture and pipes and a smell of
      nicotine and literature. Sybil thought it a nice, friendly,
      good-natured house, and though its haphazard dreaminess
      gave her more work, she did not mind. Professor Tinsley's
      house was very different. It had the cold, clean efficiency
      of a laboratory. Professor Tinsley did not smoke. He was
      pale of face and eye, and he dieted himself. His wife made
      Sybil think of a pot of refrigerated cream. The lady had a
      red and polished tip to her nose, and belonged to many
      learned societies. She was an authority upon sociology and
      eugenics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Cambridge produced in Sybil a curious restlessness.
      Much of Cambridge was ugly, some of it was beautiful, and
      if Sybil could love Clare Bridge and the Great Court of
      Trinity and King's Chapel and the "Backs," she also loved
      other things. There were the shops. Her life had been very
      full of unselfish dullness, and there was in this
      university town a perfume of youth. It was as though Sybil
      was infected by this youthfulness. It was like some subtle
      essence impregnating her. She could not or did not analyse
      her restlessness. There were days when she felt as though
      something strange was going to happen. Her face had a
      flush. Something sang in her. Youth, youth!
    </p>
    <p>
      In Mill Lane she sometimes met a young man, an under-grad.
      He was tall and slim and freckled, with blue eyes that
      looked at her with a gaillard shyness. Perhaps he had books
      under his arm. Often she met him without a hat, and his
      fair hair had a waviness. Almost it was the colour of
      honey. She felt a little strange thrill when she saw this
      young man in front of her. She never looked at him as they
      passed each other, but she was very conscious of his
      nearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Sybil.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Sybil was still a comely person, and if her hands were
      somewhat roughened, her neck was cream. She was full of
      bosom, and sleek of shoulder, and her short-sighted brown
      eyes had the allure of their wildness. She might seem tame,
      but in her--as in most women--was the wish to be desired,
      and the urge to give to the desirer when the fruit has the
      ripeness of youth. The thing confused her, and, feeling so
      strangely confused, she fled past youth with sudden, inward
      colour. She was troubled. How absurd! To be put out of
      countenance by a casual boy in grey flannel trousers and
      with freckles and honey-coloured hair!
    </p>
    <p>
      She remembered that occasion when Keir--
    </p>
    <p>
      But she loved Keir and Joanna Mary, and yet there was in
      her a kind of virginal tumult, a consciousness of youth and
      of youth's poignant and eager glances.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, coming home late from the Fortescues', she met
      the lad in a dark curve of the lane. The pavement was very
      narrow. He moved off it to let her pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good evening. It seems silly, doesn't it, when we pass
      each other so often--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was frightened, alarmed by the sudden surge of sex, for
      there was something in her soft ripeness that provoked him,
      and she knew it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, of course. But one passes so many people--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was breathless. She paused for a moment, shrinking
      against the wall. He laughed softly, soundlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But one doesn't notice many of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was almost as shy as she was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name's Hammond. I'm at King's."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not tell him her name. She wanted to fly from him,
      but for the moment something held her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I say--you couldn't come out--some evening? One doesn't
      often get the chance to talk to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She blurted out her protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh--I couldn't. I have to put my small girl to bed, and
      every night I tell her a story."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fairy story?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see. But--I suppose--I didn't quite imagine--It does
      matter, does it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a slanting and poignant glance in the dusk,
      and fled. He did not follow her. He stood looking after
      her. He smiled. The provocation of her wildness remained
      with him. Perhaps--tomorrow? He strolled on, with the long,
      easy lope of youth. Tomorrow! But Sybil, in strange
      distress, was almost running to the door of that very small
      house where Joanna Mary would be waiting to be put to bed.
      She was glad of Joanna Mary. She opened the door, and from
      the half-lit interior of the house a voice came to her
      instantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that you, Mrs. Smith?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank heaven--you've come. I thought of sending for you.
      The blessed one got out into the lane--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil forgot all about youth and its turbulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She's not--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just bruised. A wretched brat of a boy on a bike knocked
      her over. I've put her to bed. But she's been crying for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil rushed upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir never heard of Joanna Mary's adventure in the lane.
      The child was not badly hurt, but Sybil was full of
      self-accusation and remorse. To Keir's wife life moved in
      mysterious ways. She believed in God, a God who appeared in
      your secret garden and called you by name. "Sybil--Sybil,
      art thou not a mother and a wife?" Her sensitive simplicity
      fell upon its knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      Henceforward she avoided Mill Lane. She walked an extra and
      virtuous mile in order to reach the Fortescue house. Only
      once did she meet young Hammond, and she found that the
      insurgence of sex had vanished. She smiled, gave him a
      casual little nod, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she wanted to be with Keir. If man was not made to live
      alone, neither was woman. She wanted that cottage, and a
      garden, and all those things that make a woman such as
      Sybil feel secure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will it be much longer, Keir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tired of Cambridge, Syb?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm tired of being alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was as innocent as most husbands who, though youth and
      its urges may have vexed them, regard the woman in the
      house as stable as a piece of furniture.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all my fault, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, dear."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, as a matter of fact--I think there is something in
      the air. Jannis heard a rumour that we have been left a
      legacy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mean--Papworth. And some of it is to go on cottages."
    </p>

      Jannis, that dark creature, had his whimsical moods, for a
      man's moods are so much Nature's. Though no longer a babe
      within his mother's body, he is still the child shut up in
      the womb of Mother Mystery, and Jannis was a black Celt.
      That is why he and Sir Pendrill, high priest and disciple,
      could see in the silver sickle of the moon a reaping-hook
      or the edge of eternity. A robin's song was not just a
      robin's song, but the whole of autumn, pungent, red of
      leaf, faintly macabre. He was a child of the planets. He
      cast horoscopes, but his own nativity he dared not explore.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast Keir's horoscope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are fortunate, my child. Struggle--suffering--and then
      a blue, serene sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had grown very fond of his room-mate, this dark,
      delicate creature whose eyes looked black. He became
      accustomed to Jannis's moments of gentle melancholy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is always some bogy, old man. When <i>homo
      sapiens</i> grows so educated that ghosts cease to
      function, man turns to and creates a bogy out of himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir understood; he understood this truth only too well. He
      had a feeling that Jannis was afraid of the darkness, and
      especially of a grey and grizzly winter dusk. He would come
      in looking pale and hunted and make straight for the hostel
      fire. In these moments of vague fear he was a sociable
      creature who hurried to warm himself with his fellow-men.
      He stretched out his hands to life's blaze. He became gay,
      tragically gay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes when they had turned out the light in their
      cubicle, they would lie and talk for a while, and out of
      the darkness Jannis's voice would philosophize.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When we have got our cottages, old man, and the flesh of
      our flesh near us, what then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are always looking too far ahead, Jannis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my fate. But there's always an edge, isn't there, an
      edge where the sunlight ends and the shadow begins?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, keep in the sunlight."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was silence between them for a moment, and then--out
      of the mouth of Jannis flowed the very words that were
      always haunting Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fear, fear of the tomorrow, that's our shadow here, old
      man. Tomorrow may be the edge of a shadow. There is no day
      for us but today."
    </p>
    <p>
      "One has to live in the present?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Utterly and absolutely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, after all, isn't that the secret of living? I look
      into the eyes of my wife today, I play with my child today.
      What is tomorrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, but man's urge has always been tomorrow. We're not
      static creatures; like everything else, we flow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If tomorrow means fear, let's cut it out."
    </p>
    <p>
      A little gentle laugh came from the other bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can't--somehow. Is it that I'm too much of a beastly
      little egoist? No, it's not what might happen to me, but
      what might happen to those others. You just go out into the
      darkness; they stay behind--with what? An empty grate? At
      the mercy of the world? That's my shadow, old man. That's
      why I clutch at today."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I suppose the war was rather like that. We missed the war,
      Jannis. The only thing is to carry on. There will always be
      fear of some sort. They give us all they can here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish they could give us God."
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The bitter cry of man crucified. "My God, my God, why hast
      Thou forsaken me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For under the edge of the shadow of death man may hide his
      head in the cloak of fatalism or look yearningly at the
      stars. Keir understood what his room-mate was feeling, for
      he too had wandered alone in the dark places. He could have
      cried with Goethe: "More light, more light!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Immortality, survival, or faith in some beneficent
      Intelligence? Was man blown out like a candle, and had he
      to fear every gust from the unknown? There might be no
      tomorrow, nothing but today, and if today failed you, was
      that the end?
    </p>
    <p>
      But to Keir during those winter months there came a kind of
      clarity of inward vision. He groped, even as the winter sun
      groped its way through the clouds, but each day the planet
      rose higher on the horizon. Hope swelled in him with the
      gradual burgeoning of the spring. Blackbirds sang again.
      The earth was growing green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Someone gave him a book of Samuel Butler's, and he devoured
      it. Chance, or cunning? Had man emerged from the slime as a
      mere jumble of fortuitous circumstances? Had he just
      happened out of nothing, to become again nothing? Had all
      the world's visionaries been mere mouthing fools?
    </p>
    <p>
      One spring day, leaning over a field-gate and looking at
      bluebells in a wood, he seemed to hear a mysterious sound
      as of bells. Perfume and vague laughter, sunlight playing
      in and out of the young green leaves. The bronze buds of
      the oaks were swelling, and suddenly this painted screen of
      the sense world seemed to become diaphanous. It was as
      though he could look through it and catch glimpses of a
      beyondness. A field-gate, a wood, flowers, both real and
      strangely unreal. What comprehended it? Consciousness? Why
      consciousness? And if consciousness had come out of the
      slime and manifested in its awareness of beauty, was there
      not an infinite significance in this consciousness? A lamp
      had been lit. Man carried it about inside him, and the
      light had become so familiar that man had ceased to
      appreciate its significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir thought: "If I see beauty--there is beauty. If I feel
      good things in me--the good exists. If I feel shame--then,
      there are things that are shameful. Realities, the
      realities of my conscious self. The gate, flowers, trees,
      the inward movements of my psyche. Realities. A dream
      within a dream in which God is apprehended."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was conscious of a curious exultation, of a sudden
      tranquillity. It was as though the painted world of the
      senses had ceased to be opaque. He had a feeling that he
      had passed through it. It was like water or some
      mysterious, vapoury atmosphere. He had transcended his
      senses.--Other dimensions! Well--why not?
    </p>
    <p>
      He told Jannis of his experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go down to that gate, old man, and look at the trees and
      the flowers. I got away there--into somewhere else."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lob's Wood?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I got caught up in the mystery of my own consciousness."
    </p>
    <p>
      That Keir the carpenter should end in mysticism was--after
      all--but the heritage of the craftsman, for in every
      passionate craftsman lurks the potential mystic. That which
      caresses the clay or moulds the marble divines the soul of
      some other creator. Jannis went down to Keir's wood, and
      though he did not see what Keir saw, he returned wondering
      and consoled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything was still, old man, and then a little wind came
      and the bluebells trembled ever so little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you hear them ringing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's a whimsy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it? Why should it be? After all, an electric light
      would seem pretty whimsical to Pharaoh. I have a new light
      inside me, Jannis. It shines beyond words. I have asked for
      a miracle, and a voice said to me down there: Isn't man
      himself a miracle? Consider your own consciousness.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The flame in Jannis was more wayward. It seemed to tremble
      on the edge of the darkness of fatalism.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, man, if one really had proof--! If one knew that
      tomorrow was a door!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why shouldn't it be? Our three-dimensional world may be
      just a box."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder what Sir Pendrill thinks about it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Keir: "A man who could conceive and create a place
      like this must have faith in something. I mean--he can't be
      the chance product of primeval slime. There's a sort of
      profound common sense in faith. That's how I have begun to
      feel about it, and I'm different for feeling about it in
      that way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's all the difference in the world. It means there's
      a significance in things."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, it means that hope goes on."
    </p>

    <p>
      It was at the Papworth flower show that Keir told Sybil the
      news. He was to become a colonized man and draw a
      craftsman's pay. They were moving with Joanna Mary through
      a world of sweet peas and dahlias, monstrous turnips and
      gigantic vegetable marrows, marrows that would have made
      more than a load for Joanna Mary's wheelbarrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall want our furniture this winter, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware of the quick lift of her head, and of the
      lighting up of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, Keir! Cottages?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was as quick as ever in her enthusiasms.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, six of them. They have started on the foundations.
      One of them is to be ours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will it be ready?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I expect we shall be able to get in some time after
      Christmas. It will depend on the weather."
    </p>
    <p>
      Papworth built its own cottages, with the help of fit men
      as bricklayers and labourers, and Keir took Sybil and Jo to
      look at the site. It lay at the top of the hill, sheltered
      by trees, and stacks of flettons and mounds of ballast
      showed that the business of building was under way. In fact
      a couple of bricklayers were at work on the very cottage
      that would be Keir's, though the wall was no higher than
      the wall of Romulus when Remus leaped over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir had an inspiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ought to lay a brick for luck, Syb."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in love with the idea, and when the matter was
      explained to the bricklayers, they tumbled to it. Sybil was
      given a brick and a trowel, and some mortar was held ready
      on a shovel.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the bricklayers gave her a demonstration, but she
      spilt half the mortar from the trowel. The second attempt
      was more successful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give it a tap, missis, for luck. Yes, with the handle of
      the trowel."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Joanna Mary insisted upon laying a brick. The
      bricklayer wanted to support and guide her hands, but
      Joanna was all for independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can do it myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The brick had to be relaid after her back was turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the late summer and autumn when the day's work was
      over, Keir and Jannis would stroll up together to watch the
      cottages growing. The Smiths and the Jannises were to
      occupy two semi-detached cottages. They would be next-door
      neighbours. As a Papworth citizen the craftsman in Keir was
      on the alert. He was interested in the quality of the
      bricks and the soundness of the timber, and in the spacing
      of joists and rafters, but some of the settlement
      carpenters were at work, and Papworth was building for
      itself. Keir knew all the tricks of the trade, and
      especially the tricks of the timber-merchant who would
      unload his warped and twisted battens and his damaged
      matchboard on the innocent and the careless.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Papworth and the presiding spirit of Papworth insisted
      upon thoroughness, and it could not suffer itself and its
      work to be let down by a pawky commercialism. It did not
      believe in the text of "Fool the other fellow if you can.
      Prepare to be found out on occasions, and keep an expert
      liar on the premises. And always remain: Your obedient
      servants." Keir knew that all the timber that was delivered
      at the work for storing was checked and inspected. It had
      to be sound stuff, for Papworth gave quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the village there were still to be seen some of the
      earlier products when Papworth and its workers were
      learning their craft. It was rather a crude product, and
      when Keir compared the beautiful pieces that were being
      turned out now with the clumsy and poorly finished articles
      of the earlier years, he understood Papworth's pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do your best, and then go one better."
    </p>
    <p>
      The soundness of such a creed comforted him. It cheered the
      craftsman in him. He had heard Jannis expatiate upon some
      of the secret triumphs of the estate office and try to
      imitate Mr. Rice's tight and humorous smile. Someone had
      ordered chicken-houses--quite a number of
      chicken-houses--from a certain firm and had been badly let
      down by them. At the time of delivery the work had not even
      been put in hand. An angry gentleman had wired to Papworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Please quote the earliest date when you can supply"--so
      and so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papworth had wired back: "Ten days."
    </p>
    <p>
      The houses had been built and delivered in ten days, and
      the angry gentleman, somewhat appeased, had passed on the
      information to the defaulting firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been badly licked by a colony of ex-soldiers and
      consumptives."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis was amused at the way Keir appointed himself amateur
      supervisor of the cottage property. He would get up on a
      step-ladder and examine the lathing of a ceiling, and go up
      into the roof and look at the joists and the tile battens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lob's Wood, old man. Found any bluebells?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir retorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's all O.K. What about your ledgers, Jannis? No blots?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Facetious fellow!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's better to be conscious of your craft--than of your
      class, old lad. That's what's wrong with a part of the old
      country. It's been so full of rabid and silly
      class-consciousness that it forgot all about its craft. I'd
      put a few of the financiers down coal-mines for a month and
      set a few miners figuring out costs. Both parties would be
      the wiser for knowing that there was something different
      and difficult in the other fellow's job."

    </p>
    <p>
      The elms were turning yellow, and on those still autumnal
      days any sudden movement of the air would bring a shower of
      gold to earth. Keir began to talk of spending Christmas in
      the new cottage, and then--because of a certain sound in
      the night and a look by day in the eyes of his friend--he
      ceased to talk about the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis's cough had returned. It was little more than a
      clearing of the throat, and to Keir it was obvious that
      Jannis was trying to conceal it and the thing's
      significance even from himself. The edge of the shadow was
      there, more definitely there, but the clerk would not admit
      it. If he cast little, fearful glances behind him, they
      were but momentary glances. He preserved an air of gaiety,
      but Keir knew that the heart of his friend was afraid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He noticed that Jannis became breathless when walking up
      the easy slope to the new cottages. He persisted in
      visiting those cottages, for tomorrow still mattered
      intensely, and he would not surrender his tomorrow. He
      talked to Keir about what he and his wife intended doing in
      the cottage and the garden. They were going to grow the
      finest sweet peas in Papworth. He meant to build a wireless
      set of his own and get Paris, and Milan, and Berlin. Yes,
      Mary Jannis was making arrangements for their furniture to
      be moved from the warehouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wasn't it a good thing we managed to save most of the
      furniture, old man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir, looking at his friend with eyes that could not be
      deceived, felt the pity and the pathos of it. Was Jannis
      just pretending, or did he know?
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Jannis knew that one of them was to be taken and the
      other left, was it necessary for him as a friend to draw
      Jannis's attention to what might be both tragic and obvious
      to his friend? At Papworth there were men who kept up the
      illusion of living to the very last, men of the temper and
      courage of Robert Louis, who, with a smother of blood upon
      them, could gasp out the words: "If this is death, it might
      be worse." Keir had a feeling that Jannis was only too
      conscious of the closing shadows, and that like a man
      chosen to lead a forlorn hope, he made himself smile in the
      face of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      How futile to blurt out the obvious: "You're coughing
      again, old man. You ought to report to the doctors."
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, coming in rather late to the cubicle after a
      game of billiards, Keir surprised his room-mate sitting up
      in bed with a thermometer in his mouth. Jannis, like a
      self-conscious boy caught smoking a cigarette, and with the
      glass tube held between his teeth, mumbled out something
      about influenza. His eyes looked pleadingly at Keir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir began to undress, as though clinical thermometers were
      of no significance. He was aware of Jannis removing the
      instrument, and holding it up to the light to discover
      where the mercury stood on the scale. There was silence.
      Jannis was wiping the thermometer with a handkerchief, and
      Keir had a feeling that his friend was frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir sat down and took off his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Haven't kept you awake, Jannis, have I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis was lying on his back, staring at the ceiling. His
      figure had a tense stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, old man. I thought I had a bit of a temperature.
      Halliday in the office has been down with flu. I expect
      I've caught it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Much of a temperature?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis lied, and Keir knew that he was lying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just over ninety-nine, that's all. I shall be all right
      tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir said: "Oughtn't you to report, old man, and lie up for
      a day or two?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis lay and stared at the ceiling as though a large
      black spider was poised up there and ready to drop on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no, it's nothing. I hate making a fuss. So long as you
      are not worrying about--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I'm not worrying."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is plenty of fresh air in here."
    </p>
    <p>
      But that night Jannis's cough was more troublesome. It
      filled the small room with a sense of distress and of
      foreboding. It kept Keir awake for a time, and he knew that
      Jannis must be awake, but neither he nor the clerk spoke to
      each other during the night. If it was his friend's wish to
      pretend that all was well with his world, Keir felt that he
      must stand by to help in supporting the crumbling pillars
      of that world.
    </p>
    <p>
      His friend's tomorrow was growing dim.

      Papworth kept Christmas, and if the settlement
      was--according to the very clever people--a colony of
      incurable sentimentalists, no one in Papworth complained.
      If Sir Pendrill willed it--and Sir Pendrill was a
      Welshman--that a prodigious Christmas tree should be
      planted and decorated in the village hall, it was done and
      done dramatically. Keir was one of those who helped to
      decorate the tree, and if some slobbering English idiot
      murmured that "The show was for the kids," Keir was happy
      to find himself on the side of the idiots.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this Christmas was to be for him unlike any other
      Christmas. It was not mere beef and beer. If it celebrated
      the birth of the carpenter who was to be crucified, the
      ever recurring martyrdom of man, it was also a new birth, a
      piece of symbolism, compassionate humanity gathered
      together and lighting Christmas candles. Keir's childhood
      had lacked the Christmas spirit. His sneering, strenuous,
      pallid father had scorned such sob-stuff, the fool with a
      white beard and a red flannel dressing-gown. Keir came to
      this Christmas rather as a wise and gentle child to whom
      the wonder of life had been restored. He was one with the
      Kings, and the Shepherds, and the Wise Men. He was tired of
      raucous demagogues preaching social plunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were visitors, Sybil and Joanna Mary and other men's
      wives and children. There were the nurses, and Miss Borne,
      and the doctors, and friends from Cambridge, and Sir
      Pendrill--who might have worn a black velvet cloak and a
      trunk hose. One of the departmental managers dressed
      himself up as Father Christmas. The Papworth musical
      society sang carols.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir held his small daughter's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ever seen a tree like that, Jo?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Joanna had not. It was an immense tree that went up to the
      roof and twinkled and glittered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sybil looked flushed and happy. She had been to see the new
      cottage, where the plaster was drying off. They were to
      occupy that cottage at the end of January.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wish I was a kid, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled at her with whimsical benevolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aren't you one?--I rather think you'll always be one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm getting quite middle-aged, Keir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Rot."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been glancing over the faces of the Christmas crowd
      for the face of Keir's friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where's Mr. Jannis?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, he ought to be here--somewhere. He's one of the
      world's kids."
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis wasn't to be seen, and yet Keir knew that the clerk
      had put on his party mood and suit for this show, a new
      blue shirt with a blue collar and tie. What had happened to
      Jannis? Keir wanted his friend to be part of his particular
      party. There might be no more Christmas shows for Jannis in
      this three-dimensional world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was circling the glittering, green spruce, holding
      Joanna by the hand, when his eyes were drawn to one of the
      oak doors at the end of the hall. He saw Jannis standing
      there looking like a ghost, some pale thing that had blown
      in for a moment out of the winter night and would return to
      the mists in the meadows. Keir was transfixed by the
      apparition of his friend. He stood still and stared at
      Jannis, feeling that Jannis was seeing something more than
      a crowd of men, women, and children. The clerk seemed to
      hang there--crucified--though his arms were not nailed to
      the limbs of a cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Jannis turned and went out, and Keir guessed the
      truth. This man who knew that he had to die could not bear
      to look upon this children's show. It was too tantalizing,
      too warm and well lit, too full of poignant associations.
      Jannis had gone out into the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir became aware of his small daughter pressing against
      his thigh. She was gazing up at his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the matter, daddy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nothing, Jo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You looked so funny."
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced again towards the door where his friend had been
      standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I saw a ghost, Jo."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ghosts! There aren't such things as ghosts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, aren't there, my dear, aren't there!"
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h1>

    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      Keir did not see Jannis again till late in the evening when
      all the visitors had gone and the candles had been quenched
      on the Christmas tree. Keir found the clerk sitting alone
      over one of the hostel fires. He had drawn his chair close
      to the curb and was leaning over the fire as though both
      the body and the soul of him felt cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was touched by the lonely figure of his friend. As he
      closed the door, Jannis half-turned and looked at him.
      There was heart-break in the clerk's eyes, a kind of
      deprecating mute anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir sat down on another chair and spread his hands to the
      fire. He felt that there was nothing that he could say to
      his friend, to the poor, chilled man-thing who was trying
      to warm himself before going out into the last darkness. He
      knew that it was not death that could be so bitter, but the
      parting of those human contacts, the dread of what might
      happen to the people who were left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jannis spoke. His lips began to tremble some seconds before
      the words came. He did not look at Keir, but gazed at the
      fire, and his voice was the voice of a man who was very
      tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have they all gone home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm glad Mary and the kid couldn't come. I don't think I
      could have gone through with it, old man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir felt himself voiceless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know you ought to report to the doctors, Jannis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's the use? I know I'm done for."
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose from his chair, spreading his arms like a man
      drawing in all the breath that his lungs could contain. To
      sleep--oh, to sleep and forget!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's go to bed, Smithie. Where's everybody?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's a whist drive on at the old hostel."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, let's go to bed, old man. I'm--I'm glad you saw your
      people. Come on."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir said nothing. He rose and, slipping a hand under
      Jannis's arm, went out with him into the corridor.
    </p>
    <p>
      They undressed in silence. Jannis was the first in bed, and
      Keir turned out the light and slipped in between the
      sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night, Jannis."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good night."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Keir did not feel like sleeping. Not a sound came from
      the other bed, yet Keir was sure that Jannis was as wakeful
      as he was. He felt the darkness to be charged with his
      friend's dry anguish. Other men came to bed. The
      neighbouring cubicles received their occupants. Cheerful
      voices sounded in the corridors, but presently all was
      still. The December night was misty and windless, and in
      Keir's bluebell wood there would not be so much as the
      crackle of a dead leaf. He lay wakeful, and troubled for
      Jannis's sake, though his own day had been full of simple,
      happy things, that brilliant tree, Joanna's flushed face,
      the tranquil eyes of his wife. And yet how near was the
      edge of the eternal shadow! He had been fortunate; he was
      healed; he could hope. But this other man!
    </p>
    <p>
      And suddenly he heard a sound coming from the neighbouring
      bed, a sound of secret, hopeless weeping. He was shocked,
      profoundly moved. This other man's anguish might have been
      his anguish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir left his bed. He knew that his overcoat was hanging on
      the cubicle door, and he groped for it and put it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jannis, old man--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The clerk's sobbing broke out like the sobbing of a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I didn't know you were awake. How damned silly of me,
      snivelling like this!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jannis, you mustn't say that. You've been so full of
      courage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was feeling for a chair. This smothering agony in the
      darkness made him tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's no use, old man. I'm done for. I've known it for some
      time, and seeing all those kids and the women--it upset me.
      I know my number's up. They'll never come here. I shan't
      want that cottage."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir found the chair. He placed it beside Jannis's bed and
      sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jannis, I know how you are feeling. Here's a hand. Hold
      on."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness his friend's hand felt for his, found it,
      and was grasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I could sleep, old man! It's such hell lying awake and
      thinking and worrying. What's to happen to them?--Where's
      my handkerchief?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir found it for him under his pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'm so sorry, old man, so sorry."
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir sat there for a long time holding his friend's hand.
      He had buttoned up his overcoat and turned up the collar,
      for the room was cold, and yet he knew that he could bear
      it for a little while. "Could ye not watch with me one
      hour?" Jannis's hand lay very still in his. There was
      silence. And presently Keir knew that his friend had fallen
      asleep. This human contact had soothed him. Keir waited for
      a while and then gently withdrew his hand. There was no
      movement, no protest. Jannis was breathing quietly, and
      Keir stood up and, slipping off his coat, went back to bed.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      The green of the leaf on an evening in May.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir was building a rustic arch for climbing roses in the
      new garden. Had he been honest with himself, he would have
      confessed that he had no great liking for rustic arches,
      but Sybil desired it, and so--a rustic arch there had to
      be. A three-inch French nail struck slantingly on the head
      flew off like a bright splinter from the larch pole and
      lost itself in the grass. Keir smiled. He supposed that he
      would have to look for that nail, for there was a shortage
      of nails, and the day was the Sabbath.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood for a moment with the hammer in his hand. He was
      very conscious of the green world, the elms, the golden
      oaks, the meadows, the thorn trees coming into blossom. At
      the other end of the garden his wife was planting out
      snapdragons. He saw her blue apron and intent brown head.
      Joanna too was busy with her barrow, occupied as in the
      "Merrow" days in collecting stones for the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keir looked over the village. He could see the white brow
      of the Hall, and the great trees about Sir Pendrill's
      rest-house, and the roofs of the workshops and the
      cottages. Life had a simplicity here, and Keir had come to
      believe in the beauty and the beneficence of simple things.
      They were like the warm sunlight on your skin, the smell of
      the soil after rain, the moon shining upon mown hay.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the cities man talked too much. He was like water
      fretting against a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Keir thought: "It is better to do things than to talk
      and read about them. The hammer in my hand is better than
      the pen of the daily scribbler. The man who made this place
      ought to be happy."
    </p>
