<h2>CHAPTER I.--A Royal Mouse.</h2>
<p>The Asturian Ambassador had been giving a garden party, and most of the
guests were still there. The great majority of those present had come to meet
the young King of Montenana. Taking it as a whole, the monarch in question had
come up to their expectations.</p>
<p>There is always a certain flavour of romance hanging like a purple mist upon
a palace, and there was an added perfume in the case of Fritz of Montenana
because he had come westward with the avowed purpose of seeking a wife. As
everybody knows, Montenana is a pocket kingdom, lying between Russia and
Turkey. For the rest, it is mountainous and picturesque, somewhat
poverty-stricken, and given over at times to the spirit of revolution.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a wise administration contrived to rule the country fairly
well and replenish the king's privy purse annually to the extent of some two
hundred and fifty thousand pounds. Seeing that his Majesty boasted an army of
twenty thousand men, and a navy of three dubious cruisers, and a brace of
obsolete gunboats, he was a fairly eligible 'parti' as things go in these hard
times. As to the rest, he was handsome in a clean-shaven, boyish way, which was
more suggestive of Oxford and Cambridge and the Outer Bar than of the romantic
possessor of a Crown and the last representative of a set of picturesque and
undeniably cut-throat ancestors. Many fair breasts had fluttered when King
Fritz's mission first became known, and most of the Chancelleries of Europe
were mildly agitated. For, after all is said and done, the State of Montenana
had its interests, and it has been a bone of contention at more than one
International Conference.</p>
<p>In accordance with the eternal fitness of things, the king had not come
alone. His watch dog was not far off in the shape of General Count Rutzstin.
Every student of history knows the name of that distinguished warrior, and the
important part he has played in the past in the story of the Balkan Peninsula.
He stood now talking to a distinguished personage, and the subject of their
conversation was the future of Montenana and its ruler.</p>
<p>"A grave responsibility, your Excellency," the count said thoughtfully. "A
most charming young man, certainly. But, of course, young men will be young
men, you know. And--er--well, it is rather dull in our capital."</p>
<p>"The prince is a great sportsman, General?" the personage murmured. "At
least, so I have heard."</p>
<p>"Oh, dear, yes. I am afraid his English education is responsible for that.
Of course, you know the boy was at Harrow. He was accompanied there by Prince
Florizel Arcana, his cousin. But, no doubt, years will bring a sense of
responsibility. Apart from that, his Majesty has been most carefully brought
up, and in many respects he is little more than a child."</p>
<p>The great personage smiled blandly.</p>
<p>"As a constitutional monarch should be," he said. "Content, no doubt to
leave everything to the wise heads of his ministers. That is as it should be,
seeing that his father--"</p>
<p>The general coughed discreetly, and the personage hastened to change the
subject of conversation, for without risk of less 'majeste' the less about the
past of King Fritz's immediate progenitor the better. The old soldier's face
was grave and stern now. His great gray moustache bristled. For, if report
speaks truly, Count Rutzstin had anything but a rosy time during the late
reign. And if the count had any ambitions of his own, he kept them entirely to
himself. He stood there erect and upright on the grass, his face half in the
shadow of the budding trees. It seemed to the personage that a greyer pallor
was creeping over the old man's features.</p>
<p>"You are not well, count," he said anxiously.</p>
<p>"The old trouble, your Excellency," the count replied. "I have never
recovered from that cut over the head I got at Sarspruit. A slight pressure on
the brain, you know. What the doctors call a compression. I only hope and
pray--"</p>
<p>What plea was in the old man's mind was never uttered, for he suddenly
collapsed on the grass and lay there a huddled heap of scarlet and gold lace,
his gray eyes turned up to the sky. There was a shudder and confusion amongst
the guests, and immediately a score of them clustered round the unconscious
figure. There were gay summer frocks amongst the mass of gray coats and
uniforms, and a lady on the edge of the crowd turned away and shivered.</p>
<p>"How dreadful," she exclaimed, "how very dreadful!"</p>
<p>"How confoundedly lucky!" the man by her side muttered.</p>
<p>She turned upon him with reproach in her gray eyes.</p>
<p>"Does your Majesty really mean that?" she asked.</p>
<p>Fritz, King of Montenana, blushed to the roots of his fair hair. It was
well, perhaps that no society paragraphist was present.</p>
<p>"You don't understand, marquise," he stammered. "Honestly, I am very fond of
old Rutzstin, but he is a regular old martinet all the same. On the whole, I
was better off when I was at school. And, really, there is very little the
matter with the old man. He gets these queer attacks every now and then, which
absolutely prostrate him for the time being. But they never last more than a
day or two. Ah, you can see for yourself that he is better already."</p>
<p>The little gaudy group separated, and Rutzstin staggered into the Embassy in
the arms of his host. The old warrior looked very pale and ghastly now in the
light of the sun. His cunning, clever face was a mass of tiny wrinkles like the
rind of a melon. Yet, there was no suggestion of anxiety on the face of his
sovereign; indeed, a close observer might have said that he appeared to be
pleased about something. One of the Embassy's secretaries came up to King Fritz
at the same moment.</p>
<p>"This is a dreadful thing, your Majesty," he murmured. "His Excellency, the
doctor, is now with the general. Will you kindly command us what to do?"</p>
<p>"Take him home and put him to bed," the King of Montenana said promptly.
"All he wants is a nurse, and some crushed ice at the back of his head. Give
him a couple of days in bed and he will be as well as ever again. That is
all."</p>
<p>The secretary turned away, and the king strolled off in the direction of one
of the little tea-tables as if the whole thing were a matter of everyday
occurrence. There was a certain look of expectation on his keen, boyish face.
He twisted his slight moustache joyously. He looked less like a king now than a
smart, well set up young Englishman turned out by a complacent and
conscientious Bond-street tailor. Seated at one of the little tables was his
alter ego sipping coffee and smoking an Egyptian cigarette. The other young man
rose and bowed profoundly as the King came up to his table.</p>
<p>Republicans and people of that kind who have no reverence for royalty would
have declared that the king so far forgot himself as to wink at his
companion.</p>
<p>"Here is a joke, Florizel," he murmured. "Old Rutzstin is knocked up. Got
one of his old attacks, as far as I can judge."</p>
<p>"A serious matter, your Majesty," Prince Florizel murmured.</p>
<p>"Oh, Majesty be hanged!" the king said. "What is the good of keeping it up
when there is no one about to hear? Don't you understand what this thing means
to us?"</p>
<p>Prince Florizel so far forgot himself as to smile.</p>
<p>"Possibly a breaking off of diplomatic relations," he observed.
"Negotiations with the Princess of Austinburg--"</p>
<p>"If you mention her again, I'll land you one in the eye," the king
exclaimed. "I don't care a rap what Rutzstin says. What is the good of an
impregnable frontier to me so long as I am tied to a wife who weighs twelve
stone and has a complexion like a decayed orange. No, my boy, when I marry I am
going to please myself."</p>
<p>"What is the good of being king if you can't pick and choose? Now let us
trot along and see that the old chap is comfortable, and then we will proceed
to enjoy ourselves. I am sick of all this bowing and scraping and being dragged
about as if I were some puppet in a show. Here am I, at the age of twenty-five,
knowing no more of life and with little or no more experience than I had when I
left school. I used to say that our Harrow experiences were the happiest in our
days, and upon my word, I believe I was right."</p>
<p>"You won't do anything rash," the prince said anxiously. "You see, with our
aged general laid up--"</p>
<p>"My dear Florizel, this is our opportunity. The old man will be incapable of
doing anything for the next two or three days, and we could not have a better
excuse for putting off all the functions that these good people have arranged
for us. Besides, look how it will add to our popularity. Picture us giving up
all the joys of life to sit by the bedside of the man who made Montenana what
it is. Think of the reams of gush in the papers, when all the while, my dear
Florizel, we shall be sipping the delights of this queen of cities. Florizel, I
am going to go it!"</p>
<p>The prince was wise in his day and generation, but he was young. Moreover,
he was not entirely averse to going it himself. But, still, the sense of
responsibility was upon him now, and the knowledge of it clouded his youthful
ingenuous features.</p>
<p>"You won't rub it in too thick?" he said anxiously.</p>
<p>"No more than royal purple," the king laughed. "Or, perhaps, a deep
vermillion. But now come along and make your excuses. As for the rest, is it
not on the knees of the gods?"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.--"A Mere Player."</h2>
<p>The physicians' account of the condition of General Rutzstin was not in the
least disturbing. The aged warrior was suffering from a compression which was
merely a matter of time. He had to be kept perfectly quiet for a day or two,
during which period it would be indiscreet to worry him with the affairs of
state. And, indeed, the count was on the happy borderland when nothing matters,
and even the dinning clash of nations comes dull and muffled to the ear. To all
this the young king listened with resignation. Besides, he had seen his beloved
chancellor in similar case many times before. That war-scarred old body was by
no means exhausted yet, and, doubtless, Count Rutzstin would live to weather
many a plot and storm yet.</p>
<p>With his mind easy and his brain full of eager expectation, his Majesty
returned to his private apartments to dine. He was dressed now even as an
ordinary gentleman should be. He had considerately dismissed his staff to their
own devices, preferring to dine alone with Prince Florizel. Even his own
pampered valet had been accorded a holiday, for the king had given a hint to
the effect that he intended to retire early after an evening spent with affairs
of the State. Altogether an exemplary monarch.</p>
<p>But the door of the cabinet was closed now, and the two were discussing
their dinner together, assisted by an ordinary hotel waiter who knew nothing of
the language which obtains in the mountains of Montenana. Therefore, the young
men could discuss their plans openly, and without the fear of voracious
halfpenny newspapers before their eyes. They had dined and wined discreetly.
Their young blood was judiciously warm with the vintage of champagne, and all
the world lay rosy fair before them. Imagination is not one of the gifts of
youth, and the pair seated there could not guess at the tremendous consequences
which sooner or later might arise as the fruit of their innocent adventures.
The night was fading now to darkness. The lights of the fair city lay at their
feet twinkling invitingly like sirens, luring them on to the land of excitement
and adventure which lay outside the rims of electric stars.</p>
<p>"Have you made up your mind?" Florizel asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I have thought it all out," the king exclaimed. "I don't think anybody
is likely to recognise us. We are going to the Oderon Theatre in the first
instance to see Nita Reinhardt. I have been reading all about her in the
papers. She is a young actress who has taken the whole city by storm. She is
playing in a piece called 'The Mummer's Throne.' They say she is absolutely
perfect and plays the queen to the life."</p>
<p>"I have read the book," Florizel said, "the book on which the play was
founded. It is the story of a simple, beautiful country girl who finds her way
to the throne. It is a charming story, and the way in which the girl's
character is developed is wonderfully done. On the whole, we might do much more
harm."</p>
<p>"We might," the king said half regretfully. "When I think of the opportunity
that Providence has put at my disposal, I marvel at my discretion. Still, we
ought to see some fun later on when we come to sup at one of the cafes. I have
locked my bedroom door and made an arrangement with one of the waiters so that
I can get in by the window. For the first time since we left Harrow, Florizel,
we are really going to enjoy ourselves. Can't you hear the city calling? Can't
you hear the voice of the siren? I can."</p>
<p>On the whole, Prince Florizel rather thought he could. They set out,
presently, on foot, and made their way in the direction of the Oderon Theatre.
In their simple evening dress of black and white they passed unnoticed. They
found themselves presently seated in the first row of the stalls just as the
curtain was drawing up on the play which had set a whole nation talking, and
which was drawing crowded houses nightly. It was a romantic play, fantastic,
and, in places, decidedly unconvincing. For it rarely happens in real life that
a daughter of the soil, however beautiful and however romantic, finds her way
till her feet rest upon the footsteps of a throne. But here was a girl, little
more than a child, whose native genius swept all those barriers away. By one of
the freaks of Fate which appear to be almost peculiar to the stage Nita
Reinhardt had had her chance quite unexpectedly. She had made the most of it
almost from the first moment when she stood dazed and trembling in the flare of
the footlights she had appealed irresistibly to her audience. In the first act
she was shown in her simple country home, an imaginative child educated beyond
her years and her station, and anxious to try a world which lay beyond the
simple hollyhocks and primroses that bounded her father's garden. Then,
gradually, the story developed till the one chance of a century came and a
throne was placed at the girl's disposal. It was at this point that the young
actress rose to the occasion and stamped herself as the one great emotional
expert of her generation. Could she carry it through? Would she be worthy of
the honour which had been thrust upon her? Wasn't it her duty to stay at home,
or was this a call from Providence to save her suffering nation? The whole
house hung on every word. The silence was tense and painful. Seated there with
his hands gripped tight on the arms of his stall, the King of Montenana watched
the play of the emotions with breathless interest. He had never seen a girl so
bewitching and beautiful. She was fair and tall and queenly enough, and she was
absolutely devoid of make-up. She seemed to grow more regal, and her mind
appeared to expand as gradually she yielded to Fate and took up what she deemed
to be the Heavenly mandate. And then Fritz of Montenana saw before him not an
actress playing a part, but a real queen who feels the mantle of responsibility
heavy upon her shoulders. The curtain came down on the third act and the whole
house rocked with applause. The place shimmered with diamonds and pearls, the
perfumed breath of the house seemed to creep into the young king's veins and
intoxicated him. He turned eagerly to his companion.</p>
<p>"I am glad we did not miss this," he exclaimed. "Did you ever see anything
like it before? And to think that I have been losing all this kind of thing
merely to please old Rutzstin! Now, isn't she a queen? With our experience of
courts, we ought to know the real article when we see it. How different she is
to the dressed-up blue-eyed dolls that one sees hanging round the royal palaces
on the look out for husbands! Florizel, I must know that girl."</p>
<p>"Better not," Prince Florizel said, fumbling feebly in the direction of
prudence. "I wouldn't if I were you. For all she looks so young and innocent on
the stage, I daresay, when she is washed she is forty and probably has a
husband and a house full of children in the background."</p>
<p>But he of Montenana laughed the idea to scorn.</p>
<p>"She is not more than twenty at the outside. You never heard a middle-aged
woman with a voice like that. And look at her eyes! Why, if she were my queen,
I should never have trouble with the revolutionary party again. I should send
my consort to make friends with them, and in future they would be my most
devoted and loyal subjects. Don't you think we might manage to get behind. If
you let the authorities know who we are, they would probably stretch a point.
But shut up now; the curtain is going up again."</p>
<p>Here was the queen upon her throne at last--regal, magnificent, and filled
with the one impulse to do the right thing to her adopted people. Here she was
surrounded by enemies and intrigues, a sovereign to her finger tips struggling
against the destiny which she knew to be inevitable. She was disillusioned now.
She knew that her consort was no more than a feeble, dissolute creature. She
knew that she was dishonoured and abandoned. And so the thing went on till the
inevitable climax came, and the tragedy which had been branded on her forehead
from the first was enacted. She had her audience in the hollow of her hand now.
She played upon their feelings and emotions as a master plays upon some
favourite instrument.</p>
<p>Fritz of Montenana sat there entranced. His eyes were focussed on the stage.
He saw his own kingdom in little pictured there. The whole stage was crowded
now. Here was a multitude of revolutionists carrying torches, and presently one
of them touched some light draperies in the wings. Like a flash the flame crept
along, and almost before the audience noticed it the stage was in a blaze. It
was all done in the twinkling of an eye. There was a wild rush on both sides of
the curtain, the fall of a piece of heavy carpentry as the stage hands tore the
scenery away, and the actress lay there prone and insensible upon the boards,
stunned by a blow from a batten. It seemed like a dream to the king afterwards.
But he was across the foot lights and on the stage. He had the lovely form and
figure in his arms. He could feel her heart beating against his own. He noted
the subtle scent of her long fair hair. It was one of those glorious
unforgotten moments possible to youth, but to middle age never. He was acting
in a play of his own now, himself taking the leading part. As he stood there
with that slender, white figure in his arms he called to the audience to keep
their seats, for the danger was over now, and the fireproof curtain came down
quickly.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes at length, those eyes of heavenly blue that seemed to
have a depth in then like lakes under summer trees. A divine blush spread over
her features. Her lips moved.</p>
<p>"How good of you," she murmured. "How brave and kind and thoughtful. I saw
you in the audience to-night. They will be proud of you when they hear of this
at home."</p>
<p>"You recognise me, then?" the king asked.</p>
<p>"O, yes, your Majesty. You are the King of Montenana."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III.--Le Roi S'Amuse.</h2>
<p>The hope of Montenana went off, clean shaven and flannelled and immaculate
to his destruction. As in duty bound. Prince Florizel made something in the way
of a protest, but the thing lacked conviction, and the king merely smiled. Was
not he released from bondage now? Was not Rutzstin still imprisoned in his
darkened room? Besides, it was perfect May weather, and all the world was sweet
and young and fair.</p>
<p>"There will be a devil of a row presently," Prince Florizel said. "Really,
old chap, you are going it, you know."</p>
<p>The king turned up his moustache complacently.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know it," he said. "My dear Florizel, this is the chance of a
lifetime. Besides, it isn't likely to last long. And she really is the dearest,
sweetest, most fascinating--"</p>
<p>Prince Florizel went off hastily. He had heard a good deal of the adjective
complimentary for the last day or two. Besides, he was young himself, and he
had his own dish of little fish to fry. So the king went off into the heart of
the sweet May morning, whistling blithely, as gallant a specimen of a young
gentleman as the heart of shy maiden would like to meet in a day's march. There
was nothing about him regal now. He was not borne down by the spirit of his
ancestors. He was merely a healthy, wholesome young man, very much in love, and
bent upon making a fool of himself without the least possible delay.</p>
<p>So it came about presently that he and Nita Reinhardt were drifting down a
silver stream under the shadow of the city walls out into the shade of the
woods where the bluebells lay like a carpet, and the air was faint with the
smell of pale primroses. It was nothing to King Fritz now that in yon frowning
tower an ancestor of his had been put to death. It was nothing to him that
another progenitor had set siege to that fair city, and carried it at the point
of the sword. He had forgotten his pedigree, his ambitions and expectations, he
had even forgotten grim old Rutzstin himself. It was impossible that he should
remember these trivial things, or recollect the sighs of hopeless princesses
whilst he was looking into the fathomless blue eyes of his companion. He did
not know and, incidentally, he did not care that certain rumours were floating
about the cheap press, and that already some enterprising journalist had
proclaimed the fact that the ruler of Montenana was missing. What did it all
matter?</p>
<p>They drifted on and on down the bosom of the shining silver stream till they
came at length to the place where they were going to lunch. It was a fairy meal
altogether, the kind of feast that Oberon and Titania might have sat down to
that time Puck stood slyly by and made fun of them. And when it did come to an
end they went back to the boat again, and floated on between the level meadows
down to Camelot, or so it seemed to King Fritz. It was enough for him that he
should lie there on those silken cushions listening to the voice of his
companion. And then he began to sketch out plans for the future, whereupon the
little actress sighed.</p>
<p>"Do you object?" the king asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Object, why should I? But it is altogether nonsense, delicious nonsense,
but nonsense all the same. Have you already forgotten your hopes and
inspirations?"</p>
<p>"I did not know that I had any," the king replied.</p>
<p>"Why, of course, you have. You would be the first of your name if you
hadn't. Think of the possibilities of life before you! You are young and brave
and clever. You are the first popular ruler that Montenana has ever had. Under
your guidance she may be a great country some day. I shall want to feel proud
of the old place. It will be a great joy to me if anything I said encouraged
you."</p>
<p>The king glanced at the sweet, grave face.</p>
<p>"What do you know of Montenana?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I was born there," Nita went on. "It is my native place. My father lived up
in the mountains beyond Rusta where he had a farm. Some time when I know you
better I will tell you the history of my life. But not just yet."</p>
<p>"Tell it me now," the king commanded. "It is not for a subject of mine to
speak to me in that fashion. And so, you are of the same country as myself.
Well, I am glad to know that. It will be a pleasant surprise for my people one
of these days."</p>
<p>"Don't they know it already?" Nita asked, with a demure smile. "But they are
a simple people, and would have but little sympathy with a life like mine. Some
day, when you are married, your wife might be amused when you tell her of this
episode. But I am talking nonsense now. I have been thinking about you, and I
see now that I had no right to come on these expeditions at all."</p>
<p>"Why not?" the king asked eagerly. "Don't you feel safe with me? Because I
happen to be born to a throne, am I to be deprived of all pleasures? Besides, I
shall never marry now unless--"</p>
<p>Discretion stood by the king's elbow for a moment. Perhaps he was conscious
that he was going just a little too far. But the scent of the spring was in his
blood now. The air was fragrant with the subtlety of the primrose.</p>
<p>"I won't marry one of those women," he declared vehemently. "Why should I be
hawked about Europe like this? Why should I have to consult Russia and Austria
and Germany before I can make my choice? And between ourselves, my dear child,
these princesses are a pretty commonplace lot. When I marry I shall please
myself, just as my great ancestor, King Boris, did. Didn't he marry a shepherd
maiden, and didn't they found Montenana between them? Besides, we want some
good healthy blood in our veins. We are getting feeble and anaemic. Oh, my
child, what a queen you would make yourself!"</p>
<p>Nita hardly appeared to be listening. But the last few words touched her and
fired her imagination. A subtle pink flush came over her cheeks, her blue eyes
appeared to be far away. And why not? she asked herself. Kings and queens are
only mortals like other people. They are swayed by the same passions and
impulses originally. They had come from the same stock as herself in the good
old days when might was right, and the sword had the last argument. Kings were
commonplace enough.</p>
<p>And she could do it; she knew that. She would have no fear of the future
before her eyes. Her little foot would be pressed firmly enough upon the
footsteps of a throne. She would tenderly guard the best interests of her
people. And why should she not be a queen? The suggestion of the romance fired
her. Her heart was beating faster now. Her breath came quickly through her
parted lips. And such a king, too! Any woman would be happy with the present
ruler of Montenana. With a sudden impulse she bent forward and brushed her hand
softly, almost caressingly over the king's crisp, brown curls. He thrilled to
the touch of those moist cool fingers. They stirred him to a sudden energy.</p>
<p>"Don't do that," he said. "At least, I mean it is dangerous. We are very
good friends, Nita."</p>
<p>"The very best of friends," Nita murmured.</p>
<p>"Very well, then. Why shouldn't we set an example? Why must I go from court
to court until I find the passable woman with whom I might manage to live?
There is something horrible about the whole business, something so cold-blooded
and commercial. And, then, all the papers will gush and scream and cackle over
King Fritz of Montenana and his love match. They will photograph me and
paragraph me, and when I part from my future queen they will swear that my eyes
are wet. So they will be with tears--of laughter."</p>
<p>Nita smiled under her long lashes.</p>
<p>"Is it as bad as all that?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Worse," the king said gloomily. "I tell you, I won't have it--I won't put
up with it! What difference does it make to the Chancellories of Europe whom I
marry? What is the good of being a king if one can't please oneself? Besides,
it is easily managed. And once I am married according to the laws of our
church, who is there who could part us?"</p>
<p>"I am afraid you are talking great nonsense," Nita smiled. "It would never
do. Besides, the queen you have in your mind is impossible, she does not
exist."</p>
<p>"She does exist," the king cried. "She is here at this moment. Ah! my
sweetheart, it is not for you to pretend you do not know what I mean. I can
read your knowledge in your eyes and the colour on your beautiful cheek.
Besides, I am no headstrong boy who does not know his own mind. I am
twenty-five. I shall have all the world before me. And what more would you
have? Let people say what they please. You should not laugh. Remember that I am
offering you all that I possess. What more could I say?"</p>
<p>"The throne," Nita faltered, "the crown?"</p>
<p>"Aye, everything," the king said passionately. "The throne, the crown, my
heart and home. Before Heaven, you were born to be a queen--the fairest and
best and sweetest that ever helped to rule over a fortunate and delighted
people. They will worship you. Ah! they have a fine eye for beauty, those dogs
of Montenana. And why should it not be, Nita? Why do you smile when you see
that I speak from the bottom of my heart? And the thing is so easy, so simple.
The world need not know until after we are married. And then, what matters what
the people say?"</p>
<p>She should have checked him. She should have reproved him. She knew that
perfectly well. But she sat there smiling and quivering with the suggestion of
tears in her deep fringed eyes. She let him clasp her hand, and carry it
passionately to his lips. She was only a girl after all to whom fortune had
come swiftly and unexpectedly. She was floating down the stream of life, and
not swimming as the more experienced do. There was something sweetly subtle to
her in the flattery of the king, in the knowledge that this brave young man who
lay at her feet controlled the destinies of a free and enlightened people. And
he loved her, too. There was no doubt of that. She needed no lessons, no
finishing hints in the art of coquetry to tell her this. She could read the
admiration in the king's eyes, she could feel it in the grip of his fingers.
And, she could be a queen, too. Had she not displayed the fact nightly to a
score of delighted audiences? In imagination she could see her way now through
all the difficulties and dangers that lay in her path till her foot was planted
firmly upon the footstool of a throne, and she had compelled a nation to love
her despite themselves.</p>
<p>"You cannot mean it," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Sweetheart, you know I do. You know that I was never more serious in my
life. And why not? You are good. You are beautiful. You are all that Heaven
allows woman to be. Before God, I could not commit blasphemy of a loveless
marriage now. I swear I would rather abdicate and leave the throne to my
cousin. What would it be to go back to Montenana without you?"</p>
<p>He was pleading wildly and passionately now, and every word he said went
straight to the girl's heart. The thing was preposterous, ridiculous, and she
knew it; and that was, perhaps, the reason why it seemed so natural and
easy.</p>
<p>"I cannot listen," she whispered. "I have no right to let you talk like
this. And, then, besides--"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.--"I Crown Thee Queen."</h2>
<p>There were voices in the woods close by--loud, clear, gay voices--that had
no suggestion of trouble or thought in them. The boat had been pulled up under
a bank all emerald with dripping ferns, and gay with starry, yellow blossoms.
It was an ideal setting to a love duct, but the king frowned despite the noisy
buoyancy of the voices in the woods. A king is not used to intrusions of this
kind, and he of Montenana resented the fact accordingly. Then a half-smile
touched the corners of his lips as he saw a pretty piquant face glancing
through an opening in the leaves, and regarding Nita and himself with
unmistakable mischief. The girl was dressed in some light, summer costume, her
great, gray eyes looked half reproachfully, half-mischievously from under the
brim of her straw hat. She did not appear to be unduly embarrassed; she made no
stammering apology for the intrusion; on the contrary, she laughed merrily.</p>
<p>"Found," she cried, "found at last! What ho! my comrades. Come and see how
our gracious queen passes her time!"</p>
<p>"Clarette," Nita cried, with confusion.</p>
<p>"Oh, the same," the vision through the trees said airily. "Why do you look
at me like that? Do you suppose that you have the exclusive right to the river
and these beautiful woods? Are you different to the rest of us because you play
the queen night by night for two hundred francs a week? Oh, I am not saying you
don't earn your money. And who may this gentleman be? Introduce me."</p>
<p>The king was fast giving way to amusement. There was something deliciously
cool and audacious in the speaker's manner. Her innocent enjoyment was
contagious. She climbed down to the edge of the water, and drew the boat into
the bank.</p>
<p>"You are one of us, I can see," she said, addressing herself to the king.
"Where are you playing at present?"</p>
<p>"I am resting," King Fritz said gravely. "Before long, I have an important
part to play at Rusta. I am trying to induce Nita to join the same
company."</p>
<p>"But who are you?" the intruder asked. "Come along and join us at tea. We
are all here."</p>
<p>"The whole crowd from the Oderon?" the king asked delightedly. "My dear
Nita. I see I am going to enjoy myself."</p>
<p>A distressed look came into Nita's blue eyes.</p>
<p>"I pray of you do nothing rash," she implored. "You don't know what our
people are. They are good natured and kind hearted to a fault, but they are
terribly indiscreet. Clarette, I am going to place myself at your mercy. I beg
you to go back to the others and say nothing whatever as to our whereabouts.
This gentleman is his Majesty the King of Montenana."</p>
<p>King Fritz waited for the listener to be properly impressed. But from that
point of view the announcement was a dismal failure. The little actress threw
back her head and laughed like a peal of silver bells. Even the king
smiled.</p>
<p>"Oh, this is delicious," she cried. "Much flattery has turned the poor
thing's head. She actually believes that she has found a king. Your Majesty, I
am pleased to make your acquaintance. All sorts and conditions of men I have
met, but the king before--never."</p>
<p>"She does not recognise me," the king said, sotto voce.</p>
<p>He threw an imploring glance at Nita over his shoulder. She bit her lips,
and was conscious of her own indiscretion. After all, it would be a stupid
thing to betray the identity of her companion. Doubtless, it would lead to all
kinds of complications. It was better far to let the thing go, and to accept
Clarette's point of view. Besides, the king was standing up in the boat now,
and had drawn it close to the bank. The spirit of adventure was upon him. There
was something in the close contact between these actors and actresses that
appealed to him. Like most people he was more or less fascinated with the
stage, and here was an opportunity to make the acquaintance of a whole crowd of
them, which was not to be neglected. He held out his hand to Nita, and helped
her from the boat. She followed him unresistingly.</p>
<p>"Don't say anything," he whispered. "Let it all pass as a joke. I wouldn't
mind so much if it wasn't for those confounded newspapers. If they get hold of
this, I shall have half my ministers coming post haste to take me back home
again. Let the joke continue."</p>
<p>"Come along," Clarette cried. "Come and have tea with the others. I will
introduce your king to the crowd. I am sure they will be delighted; as things
go he is a very presentable king indeed. And now, what is your name, your
Majesty?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Fritz," the king said gravely. "I am sure I shall be delighted and
honoured."</p>
<p>They came presently to a little valley in the heart of the woods where a
fair white tablecloth was laid upon the grass. A kettle, boiled in gipsy
fashion, bubbled merrily on a tripod, and an actress with a European reputation
was making tea. A score of men and women, chattering and laughing gaily, were
gathered round, and the king had no difficulty in recognising most of the
company which he had seen at the Oderon Theatre. One or two glanced at him
curiously, and some of the women smiled. It was only natural from his
clean-shaven face and alert air that he should be mistaken for one of the
profession. With a laughable suggestion of melodrama, Clarette raised her hand,
and introduced him to the rest of the company.</p>
<p>"Behold the missing queen," she cried. "Now we know what has become of her
for the last few days. We might have saved ourselves from picturing her bent
over the bedside of a dying friend. Deal with her gently girls, for her case is
absolutely hopeless."</p>
<p>"How so?" asked the lady with the teapot.</p>
<p>"Mad, my dear, hopelessly and entirely mad. She swears that she is born to
the purple, and that her ingenuous companion is no less a person than the King
of Montenana."</p>
<p>"He is in the city," one of the men murmured.</p>
<p>"My dear boy, he is here. Gaze upon those classic features. Look into that
regal and commanding eye. But sit down and make yourself at home. Even a king
might do worse than drink a cup of Bertha Venis's tea."</p>
<p>A fine confusion stained Nita's checks. She was trembling with apprehension
now, for it was more than humanly possible that some member of the crowd would
recognise the features of Montenana's ruler. But the whole thing passed for a
joke. The gay company fell in with Clarette's humour, and something like a
throne was hastily improvised for the king. As to himself, he was delighted
with the warmth and freedom of his reception. Nobody seemed to care who he was,
nobody asked any questions. It was all the same to them so long as he wore the
attributes of good fellowship, and was properly introduced as a member of the
clan. He had forgotten his regal position now. He threw himself heart and soul
into the pleasures of his companions. He would have been better pleased,
perhaps, if Clarette's little joke had been allowed to die a natural death. But
the whisper went round the gay chattering circle, and to his great amusement
the king found himself treated with a mock deference which he heartily
reciprocated. Clarette had snatched up a handful of flowers, and deftly woven
them into a green and yellow circlet. She came demurely over to the king where
Nita was sitting, and cast them lightly on her yellow hair.</p>
<p>"I crown thee queen," she cried. "Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you
to the Queen of Montenana. You did not know when you came out to-day how great
an honour would be conferred upon us all. May I be allowed to have the felicity
of giving his Majesty a cup of tea? I assure you it is not poisoned."</p>
<p>The king held out his hand smilingly.</p>
<p>"We are infinitely obliged to you," he said gravely. "Permit me to drink to
the health of this excellent company. I assure you that I am charmed and
delighted to make your acquaintance. Is not that so, my queen? Tell them you
agree with all I say."</p>
<p>The colour came into Nita's cheeks, red and white chased one another like
dappled shadows on a windy summer morning. The spirit of comedy was upon her.
It was her mood to respond to the king's gaiety. Yet in a measure she was
afraid. For this was getting a serious matter now. And the king of Montenana
was carrying the joke too far. Yet his voice was so clear and buoyant, and his
face so boyish that she had not the heart to repel him.</p>
<p>"Of course," she said demurely. "I will never forgive Clarette for betraying
my secret. When I am the Queen of Montenana, she shall never be a guest at my
court."</p>
<p>The others laughed merrily enough. They were in a mood when little seemed to
please them. And from his throne amidst the spring flowers King Fritz surveyed
the whole scene with unalloyed amusement. This, he told himself, was life, this
was enjoyment. How different from the stern, hard creeds and shibboleths with
which he had been fenced in up to now! What a contrast to the grim old castle
at Rusta where he had passed the best part of his existence guarded by
sentinels, and with no choice of company than old Rutsztin and his ministers
for companionship. What mattered affairs of State now? Why should he care if
Austria was fidgeting about the new frontier line and Russia was stirring up
strife on account of the Hinterland Provinces? For he was young, and the spring
day was fresh and fair, and was not the face of his companion the sweetest he
had ever seen?</p>
<p>Why not? he asked himself. And yet, why not again? It seemed to him now that
he was an actor, and that these mummers were the creatures who extracted every
drop of the honey of his life. It was a revelation to him, a new harmonious
existence which he had only read of in books, and every moment brought a fresh
surprise; the tall woman, with the dark eyes and ivory complexion, was known
far and wide as a great tragic actress. The little man, with the wrinkled face
and Trilby hat, was the very prince of comedians. King Fritz picked up the
names as they fell from lip to lip. He felt distinctly honoured that he was
appreciated in such select company. And, meanwhile, old Rutzstin was laid by
the heels beyond the power to interfere for Heaven knows how long a period.</p>
<p>And nobody asked any awkward questions, they all seemed to take the thing
for granted. There was a charming gaiety and abandon about these actors. They
tossed their quips and cranks from lip to lip, the purple silence of the woods
rang with their innocent laughter. And they were not idly curious either. They
did not seem to care who the king was, or where he came from, so long as he
attuned himself to their melody and danced to their merry air. Here was life,
then, fresh and vigorous, and full of sap as an oak in an April wind. The king
was young, too; he had the command of means to make the adventure
successful.</p>
<p>The talk for the most part was theatrical, and Fritz listened with the
keenest possible interest. With one accord the company addressed him as 'your
Majesty'; it seemed tacitly to be understood that the jest must be kept up.</p>
<p>All the same, there was something almost pathetic in the droop of Nita's
lips and the wistfulness of her smile. The thing was utterly wrong. She checked
an inclination to start up there and then and tell the truth. But the king's
enjoyment was so wholesome and heartwhole that the necessary courage failed
her. Still, it did not matter. The little romance would be ended in a day or
two, and that frivolous-minded crowd would forget that they had ever met the
handsome stranger by the margin of the silver stream. The chaplet slipped from
Nita's hair. The yellow flowers lay unheeded in her lap. Under cover of them
the king possessed himself of her hand. Her little fingers lay unresistingly in
his.</p>
<p>"Sweetheart," he murmured, "don't be unkind. This is a glimpse of paradise
to me. Ah, you little realise what a drab existence has been mine. I know you
won't spoil it."</p>
<p>"Why should I not?" Nita whispered.</p>
<p>"Because it is going to last," the king said solemnly. "Dear heart, do you
think I am going back now? Do you think that I would return to Montenana
without you? No, not for the reversion of a score of crowns. I mean to have a
real queen, not a human puppet trained from the cradle to be an automaton and a
figure head."</p>
<p>Nita sighed gently. The whole thing was wildly extravagant to the last
degree, but it held something real for her. Her lips trembled in a smile. It
seemed as if she were about to say something warm and palpitating, when a burst
of laughter from those gathered round the tea table drowned her voice.</p>
<p>"Oh, I assure you it is true," Clarette cried. "Nita told us so. Think of
the audacity of it! None of us ever conceived such a gilded lie. Behold him!
Let me introduce you to his Majesty the King of Montenana."</p>
<p>A little man in gleaming spectacles had come up and joined the group. He was
a veritable note of exclamation. With a shrewd little smile on his lips now he
ceased to play with his waxed moustache. There was something like consternation
upon his face.</p>
<p>"Good Lord!" he exclaimed. "Why, this is actually--"</p>
<p>"What is the matter?" Clarette demanded shortly. "Boys and girls, here is
Louis Benin actually lost for speech. The brilliant journalist whose mission it
is to govern Europe is actually embarrassed. Dear little man, have you never
been in the presence of Royalty before? Give him a glass of water, one of
you."</p>
<p>The spick and span journalist forced a smile to his lips. He ceased to stare
at the owner of a throne as if he had been some rare and curious animal. His
snug self-complacency was coming back to him now.</p>
<p>"There is a likeness to his Majesty." he said. "Ha, ha, that is a good joke
of Nita's. I did not know that this was one of her metiers. I hope you are
well, sir."</p>
<p>The little journalist was swaggering now. He was apparently quite at his
ease. Yet, there was a restlessness about him, and a queer glitter in his eyes
which filled Nita with uneasiness.</p>
<p>"That man has recognised you," she whispered.</p>
<p>"It is more than possible," the king said coolly. "Indeed, I wonder that
some of your companions have not already done so. I suppose they did not spot
me out of one of those confounded uniforms that I am always decked in. But why
so grave? Who is the little man, and how can he harm either of us?"</p>
<p>"He is a Journalist," Nita explained, "and a very brilliant one, too.
Everything he says is listened to; in fact, he is quite a prominent figure
here. I don't know what is passing through his mind, but assuredly he
recognised you. I should not feel so anxious if he had not kept the fact to
himself. You see, there is Bertha Venis telling him that there is an
understanding between you and me. Oh! I wish she wouldn't. I wish we had never
come here to-day."</p>
<p>There was another burst of laughter from the group round the tea table. One
or two of the girls had laid hands upon the newspaper man, and were trying to
detain him. He was desolate, he said. He was distracted to tear himself away
from such pleasant company.</p>
<p>"I only looked in for a moment," he said. "After the theatre this evening,
perhaps. Meanwhile, the slave of duty as I am, I must hurry back to the city.
Au-revoir."</p>
<p>The shining light of the fourth estate hastened back to the city. He hurried
along the boulevards in the direction of his office. People smiled and bowed,
while a man more emphatic than the rest tried to detain him. But he shook him
off and went his way.</p>
<p>"Is it so important?" the other asked. "Is there a fortune waiting at the
office of 'La Cigale' for you?"</p>
<p>"Something like it," Benin cried gaily. "Fortune? Yes; if it is served up
hot enough. And exclusive, my friend, exclusive! Come to me to supper at the
Cafe Continental after the theatre to-night, and I promise you a feast of the
gods with the wine of the widow galore. But not if you detain me,
Alphonse."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER V.--The Masque of the Comus.</h2>
<p>The sun was westering now, the shadows of the forest trees were falling long
and lank across the green turf, the violet mists were gathering in the leafy
hollows. Seated there they could see the smoke of the city beyond, and could
catch faint murmurs of the stress and hum of life there. They did not know, and
the king did not care that already rumour was getting busy with his name. He
little heeded the choice morceau of scandal which had been passed along from
lip to lip in the cafes and at the little tables along the shaded boulevards.
As yet no one knew anything. It was all the idlest gossip. But the evening
edition of 'La Cigale' would be out presently, then they would know everything.
If there was any truth in the story, 'La Cigale' would have every detail; its
pink pages would blush with the embroidery of the scandal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the king was enjoying himself. He was in no haste to be rid of
his companions. He had no feeling of resentment for their calm assumption that
there was a perfect understanding between himself and Nita Reinhardt. But as
the dusk began to fall a certain sense of responsibility enveloped the group,
and one by one they rose and turned their faces in the direction of the city.
The gravity and responsibility of life had come back to them.</p>
<p>"Where are you all going?" the king cried. "Why away so soon?"</p>
<p>Clarette made him a grave curtsey.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty seems to forget," she murmured. "You seem to disregard the
fact that we are poor players who fret and fume our hour upon the stage, and
then--well, and then get married like Nita is going to do. In other words, we
are going back to the theatre."</p>
<p>"Oh, the theatre," the king exclaimed blankly. "I had quite forgotten that.
But, stop; why should I not come with you. Why should you not smuggle me behind
the stage? And after the performance is over, there is no reason at all why you
should not all come and sup with me. As a personal favour I ask you to come
to-night and sup with the King and Queen of Montenana. I may be a poor monarch,
but I assure you I am an excellent judge of supper, and you will have no
occasion to regret your kindness. What do you say?"</p>
<p>"An inspiration, a positive inspiration!" the great little comedian cried.
"We will leave it to Bertha Venis. Gracious lady, shall we sup with his Majesty
or not?"</p>
<p>"He is a pretty boy," the leading actress murmured. "And it would be
ungracious to him not to accept an invitation offered in so friendly a spirit.
Your Majesty shall come with us, and we will partake of your meal afterwards.
Is it agreed?"</p>
<p>With one accord they all applauded. Then they drifted away together through
the woods to the little thatched hotel where a conveyance was waiting them. It
was characteristic of the king to forget all about his boat. He was only too
glad now to carry his adventure out and extract the last sip of pleasure from
the cup he had lifted to his eager lips.</p>
<p>Night had fallen over the city now. Under the deep blue of the sky beneath
the shining stars a thousand points of flame were lighted. The purple and brown
shadows lay over road and pavement. Thousands of pleasure seekers were afoot in
search of an evening's amusement. People were already dining outside the
restaurants. The air was pungent with the smell of tobacco smoke. A score or
two of newsboys drifted up and down the boulevards with placards of 'La Cigale'
in their hands. The king, with Nita seated by his side, caught the black
letters under the flare of one of the electric standards. Nita clutched his
arm.</p>
<p>"Do you see that?" she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>There it was plain enough for everybody to see who passed:--</p>
<p>"LE ROI S'AMUSE. QUEER STORY. SEE LAST EDITION."</p>
<p>"Does that refer to me?" the king asked laughingly.</p>
<p>"Is there another king in the city to night?" Nita asked. "I tell you I am
frightened. Buy one of those papers. I cannot rest till I know what they
say."</p>
<p>The King of Montenana declined to do anything of the kind. He objected
strongly to the philosophy which meets trouble half way. He was enjoying
himself now, and he wanted no fly in his ointment. By the time the Oderon
Theatre was reached he had forgotten all about the incident, and Nita was her
smiling self again.</p>
<p>Oh, it is a new life. There is no doubt about that. He saw his gay
companions figged out in silk and satin and ermine now. He saw the mimic
history of a kingdom, and how it was portrayed upon the stage. Nothing mattered
at that moment. He would have accepted the news that Montenana had dispensed
with his services with philosophic calmness. The golden moments sped along, the
jewelled seconds were like so many gay butterflies gathered round the flowers
that made up the sum total of an hour. And it was a fresh joy and pleasure,
too, to watch Nita again fretting in a glorious existence on the stage, and
playing the queen as no living consort to-day could have carried out her part.
As the king stood there the impression deepened, the feeling of love in his
heart increased; it seemed to him that life would be a drab and hollow thing
unless he had this splendid woman by his side. For he was young and
enthusiastic, and his knowledge of the world was represented by the
conventional algebraical symbol. He made a fine picture of hope and expectation
and manly beauty as he stood there waiting for his guests to change. Clarette
came flitting along the corridor, and touched him on the arm.</p>
<p>"Well, your Majesty," she cried gaily, "what do you think of it all? Isn't
Nita superb? And to think that six months ago she was practically unheard of.
You are a lucky man, my little prince, and I hope from the bottom of my heart,
that before long Nita will realise the fact that she is a lucky woman. And if
you play her false, if you deceive her--"</p>
<p>"Heaven forbid," the king cried. "Child, child, what do you think I am made
of? I am one of the most fortunate of men who ever drew the breath of life. I
am going to marry Nita, and you shall come and dance at the wedding. Does that
satisfy you?"</p>
<p>The others were coming up now. There stood a heedless merry crowd around the
stage door.</p>
<p>"And now, where shall we go to?" the king exclaimed. "I am more or less a
stranger in the city. I am going to place myself entirely in the hands of this
prince of comedians here. Take us to the best restaurant in the city, beloved
Comus, and let us have food fit for my royal rank. Let the thing be done as the
circus proprietor says, entirely regardless of expense. This is my birthday. I
have come into my fortune. Anything you like, so long as you may be the excuse
for spending the money. Now, go ahead, mon ami, and let there be no niggard
policy to-night."</p>
<p>"The Cafe Continental," a voice exclaimed.</p>
<p>The great comedian bowed and led the way. They were seated presently at a
round table in a kind of rose garden, with an open roof. A score of waiters
attended deferentially to their wishes. There was a murmur of conversation, a
crash of plates, accompanied by the popping of champagne corks. Other people
supping paused in their conversation and listened more or less enviously to the
merry group at the round table. Laughter long and continuous rippled like
water. The King of Montenana surpassed himself. He only knew this kind of thing
faintly and nebulously through the medium of cold print. It outstepped his most
sanguine expectations. Here was life fresh and uncontaminated at the fountain
head. Here was wit and beauty about him, and the queen of his heart seated by
his side. He made no protest presently when Clarette rose from her seat and
crowned him with a circle of artificial flowers. He saw that the same mad freak
had been played upon Nita, and that she was blushing deeply under her pink
coronal of roses.</p>
<p>"Are you never tired of a joke?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Not so good a one as this," Clarette said smilingly. "This is an episode to
be remembered. Comrades, I regard myself as the most fortunate of women. Do not
unduly envy me, for I have no doubt you will be amongst the fortunate ones
yourselves. And every woman worthy of the name loves a wedding."</p>
<p>"A wedding?" Bertha Venis asked. "Whose wedding?"</p>
<p>The king's head was humming now with the wit and champagne and the
exhilaration of his company. Prudence and he were strangers just now. He caught
Nita's hand in his. He looked smilingly round upon the assembled company.</p>
<p>"Mine," he cried boldly. "Mine and Nita's. And the day is not far off,
either. In her name and mine, I solemnly invite you all to be present at the
ceremony and the wedding breakfast after. Will you not join me, my sweetheart?
Won't you say a word--"</p>
<p>A sweet confusion covered the girl like a garment. Yet her eyes were filled
with tears, a certain sadness shadowed her face. She felt the sport of
circumstance now. She felt how hard it would be to fight against the stream
which was carrying her on to the edge of the chasm. Then, as the king looked
round the room he saw, to his mingled amusement and annoyance that Prince
Florizel was standing in the doorway. There was a grave and anxious look on the
young man's face, but, at the same time, a certain admiration which the hope of
Montenana did not view altogether with displeasure. It was only for a moment
that Florizel stood there. Then he advanced to the supper table. He stammered
as he spoke.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty," he exclaimed. "Really, I--"</p>
<p>A burst of laughter ran round the table. Possibly some new and subtle joke
was being played here. But, from the king's point of view, the joke was going a
little too far. He had just sufficient prudence left to see that it was far
from advisable that these gay companions of his should know the truth.</p>
<p>"Excuse me for a moment," he said. "This is an old friend of mine. He is
unfortunately in trouble, so I will not ask him to join us. I will be back
directly."</p>
<p>The two were alone a minute or two later behind a belt of palms.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you want?" the king asked.</p>
<p>"I want to know," Florizel said pointedly, "if your Majesty has seen the
last edition of 'La Cigale,' because, if you haven't, you ought to. Your story
is told there with every picturesque detail; in fact, the whole thing is so
florid that I am hoping it is a tissue of lies from one end to the other. See,
here it is:--</p>
<p>"Le roi s'amuse. The king and the actress. Secret Marriage of his Majesty of
Montenana with one of the leading ladies of the Oderon Theatre. Oh, upon my
word, it is no laughing matter. The whole city is ringing with it. It reminds
one of that dreadful business which happened to another Balkan monarch two
years ago. But it isn't true, Fritz. For God's sake, say it isn't true!"</p>
<p>"Well, not yet," the king said calmly. "But it is going to be, my dear
fellow. And now that the thing has got into the papers I cannot possibly
hesitate any longer."</p>
<p>"What is to be done?" Florizel murmured.</p>
<p>"What is to be done?" the king echoed. "My dear boy, in the circumstances,
there is only one thing to be done."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.--The Ways of Diplomacy.</h2>
<p>The white city by the silver stream was grateful for a new sensation. Its
pleasure-loving inhabitants had something to watch now. They were ever glad of
all that was fresh and bright in romance. And here was a romance sound and
sweet to their hand. It might be said that the King of Montenana had awakened
one morning to find himself famous. Naturally enough, his arrival in the white
city had been duly chronicled, and there the Press had left him. On the face of
it, he was no more than a commonplace young man, running a pocket kingdom and
seeking for a wife who would put money in his purse and give him a surer
foundation on the throne at the same time. One or two of the papers had given a
sketch of his life and his personal appearance, and there they left him.</p>
<p>But now it was entirely different. He was a handsome man in the first flush
of youth, brave and romantic and of high courage, breaking away from all the
conditions of his caste, and actually making love to a popular actress. The
same thing had happened before, but never quite under the same conditions. As a
rule, there was something distinctly vulgar and commonplace in these intrigues.
Usually the actress was past the first flush of her charm, the prince was a
middle aged roue, with a tendency to embonpoint. But he of Montenana was
decidedly handsome, decidedly untainted; in fact, just the sort of young man
calculated to make a fool of himself, and set Europe thrilling from one end to
the other with interest and expectation. And again, Nita Reinhardt was young
and beautiful. There was not one word against her reputation. She was not the
kind of girl to sell herself, even for a robe of ermine trimmed with purple.
Here was a love match, if ever there was one, and the one problem which was
discussed over dinner tables in cafes and at garden parties was whether the
King of Montenana would marry this lady or not. On the whole, the white city
gave its Royal visitor the benefit of the doubt. It was known that King Fritz
had come there with the old bulldog Rutzstin to look after him. It was
whispered that the war-scarred warrior was lying at the point of death in his
bedroom; and when the cat's away, the mice will play.</p>
<p>Thus it was that the King of Montenana found himself a popular hero, and
Nita Reinhardt was, if possible, a more central figure than ever. There were
songs sung about her in the cafes. The whole thing went with roars of applause
at the music halls, all of which was decidedly embarrassing for the Royal
lover, who found himself a centre of more attention than he cared for. At the
same time his resolution hardened. He had made up his mind to go through with
the thing now; indeed, as a gentleman, he couldn't do anything else. The ways
of diplomacy find excuses for kings in such circumstances, but the ruler of
Montenana resolutely declined to view the situation through spectacles.</p>
<p>"Your Majesty hardly appreciates the position," Prince Florizel murmured
discreetly, as the two sat together over their dinner two nights later. "Of
course, as a mere matter of amusement, I can quite understand how it is
that--"</p>
<p>The king started up furiously. His eyes were blazing now, the veins on his
forehead stood out clean and blue.</p>
<p>"This to me?" he cried. "Your Highness is forgetting himself. Another word
and I shall strike you."</p>
<p>"As your Majesty pleases," Florizel said quietly. "You may doubt many
people, but when you doubt me--"</p>
<p>"A thousand pardons, Florizel," the king cried. The engaging smile was back
upon his lips now. He laid his hands affectionately upon his companion's
shoulder. "My dear friend, I am forgetting myself. Was man ever blessed with a
more faithful comrade than you? You saved my life upon one occasion."</p>
<p>"Aye, and on one occasion you saved mine, Fritz," Florizel said half sadly.
"Believe me, I am speaking in your best interests. I implore you to draw back
before the matter has gone too far. I know that Nita Reinhardt is all that a
girl should be. I know that she would part from you without a word of reproach
if you only told her that it must be so. You might have stopped to think before
you compromised her in this fashion."</p>
<p>"But, my dear friend, I have done nothing of the sort," the king protested.
"Florizel, upon my soul, I cannot live without her. Compare her to the
pasty-faced, goggle-eyed creatures dug out of musty castles for my inspection.
Besides, I love her, and no man can say more than that. Of all the dearest,
sweetest, most fascinating creatures that ever drew the breath of life; but
there, I bore you. You are not listening."</p>
<p>"I am suffering in silence," Florizel said grimly. "Do you mean to tell me
honestly that you are going to marry this woman?"</p>
<p>"Have I not been impressing it upon you for the last two or three days? I
have made up my mind, Florizel. It shall be a secret marriage in this city
where the religion is the same as our own. It shall take place this very night.
I am sick of the persecution of these newspaper people. Why can't they leave a
man alone? And, by the way, isn't that dreamer and visionary Pierre Bentos
somewhere to be found, in these parts? I understand he had a mission here. He
is the very man for our purpose."</p>
<p>Florizel proceeded to expostulate once more, but it was all in vain. He was
behaving badly, and he knew it. A day of reckoning lay before him, but he was
little heeding that now. He would have to answer presently to the grim, gray
wolf overhead, who was fast recovering from his seizure. But Florizel put all
these reflections behind him now. It was seldom that the King of Montenana
appealed in vain to his friends, and Florizel would have gone to the death for
him cheerfully. A few minutes later he was heart and soul in the adventure
himself.</p>
<p>"I can find Bentos for you," he said. "I know where he is, and we can
arrange matters accordingly. Bentos has a kind of monastery outside the city
where he trains young men for the priesthood. The place is a fortress in its
way, which, if you knew, is in your favour."</p>
<p>The king's brows knitted and frowned again.</p>
<p>"Why?" he demanded. "What are you hinting at? Who would care to use force
where I am concerned?"</p>
<p>"Rutzstin would," Florizel said grimly, "and you know it. Can you ever
remember that old fox stopping at anything where his interests were concerned?
Have you forgotten that he has set his heart upon you marrying your cousin.
Besides, there are other people in Rusta who would obey Rutzstin's lightest
word, whilst they put off with lies and prevarications. And Schentein is here.
I saw him by chance last night."</p>
<p>The king looked grave, for this Schentein in question was the leader of a
guerilla band of irregulars, and a man as brave as he was utterly unscrupulous.
He was Rutzstin's right hand man too, and at a word from the old soldier would
have laid hands upon the Royal person without the slightest hesitation.</p>
<p>"I don't like this," he murmured. "And yet the thing sounds preposterous.
They would never care to kidnap me."</p>
<p>"Schenstein would dare anything. And don't forget that I have warned you.
You are safe enough in the day time, but the city will be hardly beneficial to
you after nightfall. It would be far better to leave matters entirely in my
hands."</p>
<p>The king sat there in a brown study. By tacit consent he appeared to leave
matters as Florizel had suggested. He sat there until the darkness fell, and
the lights of the city twinkled out one by one. His past life rose in view
before him. His determination hardened. Who were these people? And why did they
stand in his way like this? Surely, it could matter little or nothing to Europe
in general whom he married. The map of the world would not be altered because
he had allied himself to youth and beauty, instead of rank and commonplace
femininity. His face hardened as he thought of Schentein and his
satellites.</p>
<p>He rose presently and went in search of Florizel. But the latter had already
left the hotel. It seemed almost impossible that he could sit quietly down
there and wait upon events. He must be doing something, he must be moving
towards his goal. He would go down to the theatre and see Nita. He slipped a
revolver in the pocket of his overcoat, and set out upon his way. He walked
quietly along the boulevards in the direction of the 'Oderon' lost in his own
thoughts, till presently a messenger boy touched him on the shoulder. The
mannikin in uniform had a letter in his hand which appeared to be in Florizel's
handwriting. The envelope contained a few words scribbled on a visiting card,
which were curt and to the point. Directly on receipt of the letter the king
was to go to a certain address without delay, and there wait the arrival of his
friend. He nodded curtly. He crushed the paper in his hand and passed on
suspecting nothing.</p>
<p>But something like a gleam of prudence came to him presently as he found
himself in an unfamiliar part of the city. He began to ask himself questions
now. He hesitated in the deserted roadway. It was cowardly, perhaps, but he
decided to go no further.</p>
<p>He had hardly turned before three figures materialised from the shadows, and
he found his path cut off. The figures were masked, though it seemed to the
king that one of them was familiar to him. Without a word they closed upon him.
He had not passed five of the best years of his life in an English public
school for nothing. His left hand shot out swiftly, and one of the ruffians
went down crashing into the roadway. Before the other two could advance the
king had whipped out his revolver and stood with it in his hand.</p>
<p>"Stand where you are," he whispered, "if you value your lives!"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII.--"Whom God Hath Joined--"</h2>
<p>The moment's delay was distinctly in King Fritz's favour. He stood there
with his foot on the prostrate rascal's neck. He had his back to a friendly
wall now, so that his other assailants could see down the grim mouth of the
revolver barrel. A second later, and some one came hurrying up the street. The
other two men glanced at one another involuntarily and vanished. Evidently
discretion was the better part of valour in this case. The king suffered the
man at his feet to crawl away. He smiled grimly as he recognised the figure of
Florizel coming towards him.</p>
<p>"You were right and I was wrong," he said. "But it was a close call. I
recognised Schentein right enough. I shall have an account to settle with that
gentleman later on. But all these things prove to me that there is no time to
be lost. Have you seen Pierre Bentos?"</p>
<p>"I have just come back from his retreat," Florizel explained. "Oh, I found
him quite amenable to reason. He thinks--well, no matter what he thinks. He is
convinced that it is your duty to marry Nita Reinhardt, and he regards himself
as the special instrument of Providence designed to perform the ceremony. My
dear Fritz, you needn't frown like that. What does it matter so long as we have
a priest handy and complacent? Not another padre in this city would dare to do
such a thing. Now go down to the theatre, and I will wait for you outside.
Before you sleep to-night, you will have given your people a queen to rule over
them."</p>
<p>King Fritz strode along resolutely enough now. It was getting late by the
time the Oderon was reached. The last act was nearly finished. A packed
audience was watching the final tableau breathlessly. It seemed to the king
standing there as if Nita were excelling herself to-night. The curtain came
down presently amidst a perfect tornado of applause. The queen of the moment
stood before the footlights bowing to the rocking crowd, with piles of flowers
about her feet and an enormous bouquet in either hand. There were friendly
cries of badinage mixed with the cheers, and more than once the King of
Montenana heard his own name mentioned. He flushed with mingled pride and
anger--pride in the possession of this exquisite creature, anger that certain
people there coupled their names so lightly. Fritz pencilled a few words on a
card and sent it behind with one of the attendants. When Nita left the theatre
later on she was absolutely alone, as the king had suggested. She looked pale
and anxious, but her face flushed with a shy pleasure she could not conceal as
she held out her hand.</p>
<p>"You heard them?" she whispered. "You were in this theatre to-night--I could
not help seeing you."</p>
<p>"I heard them--yes, sweetheart," the king muttered. "Let us go into this
little room for a moment. There is something that I have to say to you ... I am
glad you mentioned the subject, Nita. Things cannot go on like this. For your
sake it is impossible."</p>
<p>"And for yours also," Nita said sadly.</p>
<p>"For both our sakes, then. You know what people are saying. They think it is
impossible that a king could so far forget himself as to marry a mere actress.
Ah, I hate to speak like this. But, believe me, it is necessary. But why
shouldn't a king marry an actress? They are of the same fiesta and blood, they
come from the fame common ancestry. And were I to go away and leave you now,
even if the heiress of all the ages awaited me, I should be acting like a
coward and a scoundrel. But I do not want to leave you, Nita. I shall never
leave you again. We are both actors in our way, both eternally posing before
the footlights. I want to take you by the hand in the face of all the world and
say, Here is my wife. Sweetheart, do not be cruel to me."</p>
<p>"Am I cruel?" Nita asked with a shy uplifting of her eyes. "Ah, my Fritz, if
you only knew!"</p>
<p>Her hands went out to him now. He caught them passionately and drew her to
his heart. Their lips met in a long, tender caress. And when at length Fritz
put the woman of his choice from him, he saw deep down in her eyes the signal
of victory.</p>
<p>"Come with me," he whispered, "come with me now. You can trust yourself to
Prince Florizel and me. And there is an old friend of mine on the outskirts of
the city who is waiting even now to marry us. Possibly you have heard of Father
Pierre Bentos. Well, he is awaiting our arrival. Sweetheart, you won't say no;
because, if you do, for your sake we must part now. Come with me and give me
all the happiness that man could desire. Come and help me to rule my kingdom,
so that I can say to my people that here is a daughter of the soil, here is one
of ourselves. Why do you hesitate? Why don't you answer me?"</p>
<p>"I am not hesitating," the girl said through her tears. "I am only trying to
persuade myself that I am doing so. I know in my heart of hearts that I cannot
let you go. I honestly believe that I can make you happy. But it is so selfish
of me."</p>
<p>"Selfish! In the name of Heaven, why? Surely, you realise the
responsibilities and dangers that lie before you. It is no sinecure that I am
offering. But we are wasting time. Come with me now, and to-morrow we will
drive side by side through the city, and everybody shall know that we are man
and wife."</p>
<p>Nita would have said something, but she was beyond words just then. She
could only smile unsteadily and wipe the unshed tears from her eyes. She placed
her hand in that of the king with an air of infinite trust and abandon, and he
raised it to his lips.</p>
<p>"Queen of Montenana," he whispered. "The sweetest and best who ever sat upon
the throne. Are you ready, mine?"</p>
<p>Nita drew herself up. Her smile was proud as well as tender now. She looked
like a real queen enough. She was now as Fritz had seen her on the stage of the
theatre. But there was something more real, more human and palpitating,
something intangible and full of charm to which he could give no name.</p>
<p>They passed out into the street, arm in arm, in silence, to where Prince
Florizel was awaiting them. Florizel bowed gravely. He was a perfect courtier
now. He played his part as if he had been accustomed to this kind of adventures
all his life, as if this were the usual way in which monarchs generally woo and
wed their brides. Matters seemed to slip entirely into his hands. It was he who
called a conveyance and gave the driver his directions. They came presently to
the outskirts of the city, and stopped before a stout oak door in a heavy wall.
Inside a few dim lights were burning, and there a tall, slim man awaited
them.</p>
<p>"I am glad to see you again, father," the king murmured. "I shall know how
to thank you presently for this inestimable service."</p>
<p>Something like a frown knitted the pale face of the priest. His skin was
white and drawn as if from some long illness. It was only the steady gleam of
his dark eyes which showed that occasionally the man fought for mastery with
the priest and anchorite.</p>
<p>"You ought to have come here before," he said.</p>
<p>The king caught his lip between his teeth and bit it passionately. He might
have exploded violently, only he caught the wounded look in Florizel's
eyes.</p>
<p>"Lead the way," he said. "We can talk of these matters afterwards. This is
my bride."</p>
<p>The priest's pale, hard face softened as he laid his hands gently on Nita's
head and blessed her. It seemed a strange and weird dream to the girl
afterwards. In a dull, muffled way she heard the hollow ring of her own
footsteps upon the bare pavement, she saw the little chapel with its stone-hewn
walls picked out feebly by a pair of candles burning on the altar. She could
see figures masked and cowled in the carved oak stalls. She started presently
when an unseen organ opened its silver throat, and the whole place was flooded
with some rapt melody. She was not acting now. She stood there white and pale,
trembling and frightened, and yet full of a fearful joy. In a kind of mist the
long, lean, black figure of the priest stood out; he was saying words which to
her were strange and yet oddly familiar. And presently the King of Montenana
had her shaking hand in his, a plain gold ring encircled her finger.</p>
<p>It was all over now. The irrevocable step was taken, and the unseen organ
broke out into a joyous chant which was like the tread of armed men coming back
after some glorious victory. Then the mist faded away, and the whole situation
flashed upon the young queen.</p>
<p>"Let me be the first to offer my congratulations," Father Bentos said.
"Permit me to--"</p>
<p>He paused and held up his hand for silence, for there was a sudden
thundering knocking on the chapel door and hoarse cries outside. With a dignity
all his own, at a sign from Florizel, the priest threw back the heavy doors,
and half a score of men entered. At the head of these, fully clad in uniform
with his sword at his hip, came General Rutzstin. His great grizzled head was
thrown back, his face was pale beyond the whiteness of his recent illness, a
great grim rage blazed in his eyes.</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this?" he demanded.</p>
<p>King Fritz confronted him. Here was the king stern and hard and full of
courage, a dignified picture enough now. It was only at that moment Nita
realised that here was a ruler indeed.</p>
<p>"That is precisely what I was going to ask you," the king said sternly.
"What is the meaning of this? How dare you, a subject of mine, intrude in this
insolent manner? But I am forgetting myself, general. Let me present to your
Majesty my faithful subject, General Count Rutzstin. General, your queen."</p>
<p>The general bowed to his sword hilt.</p>
<p>"I am your humble servant," he said hoarsely. "Oh, this is indeed a great
day for Montenana!"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII.--The Fierce Light or the Throne.</h2>
<p>High up above the town the fortress-palace gleamed with lights. It stood
over Rusta like a flashing tiara on the dusky hair of a queen. A great dance
was in progress at the palace, and most of Montenana's chivalry had gathered
there. The streets of the capital were quiet for the most part; there was a
powder of stars in the blue dome overhead. In the oleanders and myrtles a
drifting tangle of fireflies glistened. Away beyond the fertile plain was the
sea, and occasionally far out the flinging rays of a revolving lantern from the
lighthouse on Martyr Island. Assuredly a happy country this!</p>
<p>Inside were thousands of glistening electric globes under pink shades
clustered on the silver electroliers, strings and ropes of roses, a tangle of
fern and foliage against the polished oak of the ancient walls, the dull flash
of armour here and there. Here were pictures of dead-and-gone rulers of
Montenana, makers of history before this age of luxury commenced, and before
the stone flagged passages were littered with rare Persian rugs like tinted
rose leaves in a Persian garden.</p>
<p>Surely the queen of all this should be a happy woman! It was a year to-night
since she had come here first, blushing and palpitating with her new honours
thick upon her! The nebulous dream of the throne had become a breathing
reality! A year to-night King Fritz had stood by the side of his bride on the
terrace yonder listening to the hoarse roar of the cheers from below uprising
from beneath the smoke of the swinging torches. He had seen old Rutzstin grim
and forbidding in the background, a figure of ill omen. It had seemed nothing
then--to-night the king was not so sure ...</p>
<p>He was in the midst of his guests, upstanding, handsome, a smile upon his
face. He had learnt how to smile though his heart was heavy within him and the
shadow of the coming trouble kept him awake of nights. The atmosphere was warm
and heavy, the music made by the band concealed behind a tank of azalias
suggested love in idleness. There was a constant ebb and flow of silks and
laces and foaming garments suggestive of a sea under the summer sunshine.</p>
<p>King Fritz turned his back upon it somewhat impatiently. Would the queen
never tire of all this gilded frivolity? The last three months had been one
delirious whirl of gaiety; there had been no time to think. Was that the same
woman yonder, the woman with the tiara blazing in the wonder of her piled-up
hair, the same gentle, timid creature that he had wooed and won amongst the
primroses in the woods of Arcady? There was some proverb as to the setting up
of a beggar on horseback, and--but that was not a pleasant thought. How had it
all happened, how had they drifted apart? There had been no quarrel, no
coolness, and yet it seemed to King Fritz that he was looking at his consort as
if she were standing on a distant continent.</p>
<p>She could but see the peril coming, she did not realise for a moment that
they were both little better than prisoners in this splendid cage. Well, let it
go on--let her enjoy herself whilst there was yet time. Old Rutzstin would
strike when the hour came. There was a whisper, too, that Schenteim was in
Rusta, and that he and Rutzstin were working hand and glove together. The seeds
of disaffection had been sown in the provinces, the name of the queen had
become a byword of extravagance and folly, and--</p>
<p>Somebody was pushing a folded scrap of paper into the king's palm. He turned
to see little Clarette of the Oderon Theatre before him. There was gladness and
mocking laughter in her eyes, yet she laid a warning finger on her lips. As a
matter of fact, most of the Oderon company were here. There was a dramatic
performance to-morrow night in the castle theatre, and two thousand guests had
been bidden to the performance. The play was by the queen herself, and she had
summoned her old comrades from Asturia to take part in it.</p>
<p>What would become of all these butterflies before long? Fritz asked himself.
The blow might fall at any time, the revolution be proclaimed to-night. There
was tragedy red and stark lurking in the shadows of the city. There were those
amongst Schenteim's followers who had sworn that the queen should never leave
Montenana alive.</p>
<p>Some frothy nonsense broke from Clarette's red lips as she passed on. King
Fritz opened the scrap of paper and read the message surreptitiously.</p>
<p>"The little cabinet behind the throne room at two o'clock," it ran. "Don't
fail me."</p>
<p>The hour was near at hand. Rutzstin had vanished for the moment. Usually
those keen old eyes were not far away. The king strode aimlessly along the long
flower-decked corridor till he came to the deserted throne-room. The cabinet
behind was hung with tapestry, the windows looked sheer down to the distant
roadway. Once a hillman had climbed that precipice, and with the aid of a
dagger had changed the dynasty.</p>
<p>Fritz stood there gloomily waiting. He touched the switches and flooded the
room with light. Then the door was flung open, and the queen came in. She
hesitated just a moment, a pink flush rose to her cheeks. Heavens, how
beautiful she looked! The radiant loveliness had refined, the figure had
expanded, the eyes were more clear and lustrous. In her gleaming white she
looked every inch a queen. The golden wonder of her hair was crowned by a
flashing diadem of stones; her red lips were parted as if she had run far.</p>
<p>"I--I thought that I should find you here," she said. "Rutzstin has
gone?"</p>
<p>"I am not his keeper," Fritz said sullenly.</p>
<p>"Could he with truth say the same thing of you?" the queen retorted.</p>
<p>Fritz flushed to his eyes. How callous she had grown! She had ceased to care
for him, she had never cared for him! She had merely been dazzled by the
splendid prospect that he had held out to her. Well, let her make the most of
her time.</p>
<p>"Do you understand what you are saying?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I think so," she said. "Oh, you think that I am a fool, a little brainless
butterfly, content to flit in the sunshine and heedless of the morrow. You
think our marriage was a mistake--"</p>
<p>"It is no matter of speculation, madame--I am certain of it."</p>
<p>There was something cold and cutting in the words. The queen reeled before
them as if they had been a dagger in that dazzling white breast of hers. The
beautiful face grew pale. She half turned away, sorely wounded, then she
paused.</p>
<p>"You are cruel, cruel," she whispered. "You do not understand. I could have
left you long ago had I wished. I could have taken away with me the fortune
that lies in my jewel-cases. When I first saw the danger, I might have left you
to your fate. But I stayed because--because I loved you, Fritz. Do you think
that I am not blind to the danger? Do you suppose I do not know what is going
to happen? I stayed to share your fate--"</p>
<p>"You stayed to share my fate! You! What are you afraid of?"</p>
<p>"Afraid! I am not afraid. It is you that I am thinking of. I could die by
your side, but I don't want to live without you. And yet you are right--our
marriage has been a mistake. My beautiful dream ended before I had been here a
month. Your people refused to take me seriously. In their eyes I was a mere
scheming adventuress, or a silly doll come here to play the leading lady in a
comic opera. Their minds had been poisoned by the agents of old Rutzstin. That
man is a fanatic, he is mad. He has dreamt of allying Montenana to Bergia by
your marriage till the thing is a monomania with him. If you fall, then your
cousin Bergius comes to the throne and Rutzstin's dream is a reality. To bring
this about he would not scruple to murder both of us."</p>
<p>The king stood listening in amazement. He had guessed all this--he knew it,
and more. But that those facts should be so familiar to the woman standing
there!</p>
<p>"Who told you all this?" he asked. "I thought--"</p>
<p>"Oh, I knew exactly what you thought! Have I not eyes? Is there anything the
matter with my hearing? But I thought you didn't care. I thought that you were
given over to mere pleasures, to your dogs and hares and your guns. And in all
these unhappy months--"</p>
<p>"Unhappy! You? I give you my word of honour that I regarded you--"</p>
<p>"And we have both been mistaken! Ah, well; it is hard in an atmosphere like
this for the flower of love to thrive! And yet I did my best. I tried so hard
to show your people that their interests were mine. We seem to have drifted
into a tangle of frivolous amusements, to live for nothing else. And our
enemies are pointing the finger of scorn at us. It is all Rutzstin's doing,
every bit. And we are prisoners here at Rutzstin's good will and pleasure. When
he is ready, Schenteim will strike the blow. It will be a case of Servia over
again--perhaps."</p>
<p>"It would be cowardly to leave it dear."</p>
<p>The queen's face lighted in a tender smile. Her face glowed.</p>
<p>"Why?" she asked. "What do you gain by the martyr's crown? If we could get
away! Fritz, if you have any love still left for me--"</p>
<p>The king took a stride forward. He caught the dazzling figure in his arms,
he bent down and pressed his lips to the quivering mouth of his consort. They
could catch faintly the dreamy music in the distance, they were in a world of
their own for a moment.</p>
<p>"I could bless this chance," Fritz murmured. "Fool that I was ever to doubt
you! And I saw all this coming! I did not care because--well, because I thought
that you did not care! And now it is too late. The wolves are all about as, the
city is full of them. I believe that Rutzstin has gone off now to meet
Schenteim. I could have met them with my back to the wall. But not now, not
now! To hold you in my arms again makes a coward of me. I cannot lose the
happiness that I can read in your eyes, my sweet! Mark you, I made no
mistake--I would do it again to-morrow. The mistake was in coming here at all.
I should have renounced my throne, and you and I together ... But think! It is
too late for us to try and escape. Even Florizel has abandoned me."</p>
<p>The queen shook her dainty head till the diadem trembled like liquid
light.</p>
<p>"Never!" she cried. "Never! Some harm has happened to Florizel! He has been
spirited away. We may never know the truth. What was that?"</p>
<p>A keen breath of air blew into the room, the tapestry on the walls trembled.
The folds parted and a man stumbled and fell prostrate on the floor.</p>
<p>"For Heaven's sake lock the door," he whispered hoarsely. "I'm--I'm--"</p>
<p>He lay there in an utter state of prostration. His peasant's dress was torn
and mud-stained, the white features were smeared with blood. A cry broke from
the king.</p>
<p>"Florizel!" he exclaimed. "My dear old friend, what is the matter? Where
have you been?"</p>
<p>The prince opened his eyes and smiled faintly. After a little while he
contrived to struggle to his feet. His breath was coming less painfully
now.</p>
<p>"Give me some food," he said. "A few sandwiches and a glass of wine. I came
here by way of the cliff. I managed by a miracle to scale the height."</p>
<p>The queen turned hastily to the door. Fritz detained her a moment.</p>
<p>"Can you manage it?" he asked. "Be very cautious. If you see Rutzstin--"</p>
<p>"Rutzstin is safe for the present," Florizel said, "I know exactly where he
is to be found. So you got my message, Fritz."</p>
<p>"I got it, yes. It came from little Clarette. I was wondering how--"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes. We will come to all that presently. She is a dear little thing,
and for courage she has few equals. Give me food first for I have had nothing
since daybreak. Schenteim's people fancy that I am lying dead in the mountains.
It is no fault of theirs that I am not ... The danger is very close,
Fritz."</p>
<p>"I know it," the king said moodily. "I have known it for a long time, but,
like the fool that I am, I took no heed of it. And it's too late now."</p>
<p>"Not quite." Florizel smiled. "There is a chance for safety yet for all of
us."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.--A Plot Within a Plot.</h2>
<p>Before any further questions could be asked, the queen was back again. From
beneath the long train thrown over her arm she produced a bottle and glass
together with a plate of sandwiches. Florizel noted these with a gleaming eye.
Presently the colour came back to his cheeks; he gave a deep sigh of
satisfaction as he drained the last sip of the foaming amber in the glass.</p>
<p>"I am another man now," he said. "After all, there is not very much harm
done. Did you begin to imagine that I had deserted you, Fritz?"</p>
<p>"I--I am afraid so," the king stammered. "I was a blind fool, Florizel. It
seemed to me that I was absolutely alone in the world. I did not care what
happened. But in one sense my eyes were clear enough--I saw what was
coming."</p>
<p>"You saw the danger from Rutzstin, then?"</p>
<p>"I did. Each day he grows more insolent. He opens my correspondence. He
forbids me to go here and there. I am a prisoner in my own palace. The very
guards about the place pay more deference to my chancellor than they do to
me."</p>
<p>"The man is mad," Florizel said. "His brain has been going for a long time.
Your marriage was the crowning blow--it meant the destruction of all his
fondest dreams. He has played on your indifference. He has arranged matters so
that all Montenana looks upon you two as frivolous creatures given over to the
pursuit of pleasure. He had hopes of a peaceful revolution, but that has not
materialised. Now he is going to strike in another way. Schenteim is in Rusta
with two thousand of his hillmen. They are scattered all over the town, but
they are ready to rise at a given signal."</p>
<p>The king started; he smote his forehead despairingly.</p>
<p>"I am a murderer!" he cried. "I have murdered the sweetest and dearest woman
who ever gave her heart to a blind man. My sweetheart, I have betrayed you--I
have betrayed you to death as surely as if I had laid hands upon you. And I
could have got you away so easily a little time ago. Any excuse would have been
sufficient. And now--"</p>
<p>His voice broke and he was silent. There were tears in his eyes as he held
the queen's hand to his lips and kissed it. Her smile was brave and steady.</p>
<p>"What does it matter," she asked, "so that we are together again? Believe me
when I say that this is the happiest moment I have known since we came here
nearly a year ago. My mistake was in believing that I was born to be a queen,
in thinking that the stage was the same as life itself. But to take you
away--"</p>
<p>"But I want to go--now. If I could only--my dear Florizel, is it
possible--"</p>
<p>"I was coming to that," Florizel went on. "The sword hangs on a thread."</p>
<p>"I know it. But when is it going to fall? Can you tell me that?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I am here for the purpose. It was because they thought I knew too much
that they kidnapped me and took me into the mountains. I had a friend amongst
them, or it would have gone hard with me. But I learnt everything. The blow
falls to-morrow night at twelve. The signal is a rocket from the ramparts here.
A hundred picked men will overpower the guard, if they need overpowering, and
then the castle will be taken. Rutzstin will be here, and so will Schenteim and
a dozen of his confidants, passing as your guests. After the performance of the
play is over they will induce you to enter the anteroom by the side of the
stage, and then--my dear friends, I cannot possibly say any more!"</p>
<p>The queen was the only one who maintained the least composure.</p>
<p>"Then it will be our turn," she said calmly. "You are sure of your facts,
Florizel?"</p>
<p>"Madame, would that I were mistaken. I could only get back here in time to
warn you of the inevitable. I had to pretend to escape from the hills. I
dropped into a ravine as if a shot had been the end of me. My friend followed
and pretended to put a couple more bullets into my carcase, and went back with
the news that I was finished. How I got here, Heaven only knows. If I could do
anything, if I could lay down my life--"</p>
<p>"Dear friend, there is no need," the queen said softly. "I have seen all
this coming. My great drawback was that I did not know when. And, sooth to say,
I did not care. It seemed to me that I had lost more than life already. But I
was going to give my liege a chance. By a strange coincidence our foes have
fixed upon to-morrow night. The dramatic performance here was no mere chance,
for I have been planning my scheme for weeks. The great trouble was that I
could not see my way to getting all our enemies together in one spot. They have
been good enough to save us all that anxiety. Fritz, is the yacht ready?"</p>
<p>The king started at the inconsequence of the question.</p>
<p>"The yacht is always ready, dear," he said. "The mischief is that I am not
allowed to use it."</p>
<p>"You are quite certain that you can rely on your crew?"</p>
<p>"You need not worry about that, Nita. My captain and crew are all
English."</p>
<p>"Ah, I had forgotten that. No treachery to be found there! Now I shall leave
it to you to see that steam is up any time after midnight to-morrow. There will
be something like thirty or forty fugitives besides ourselves. These, of
course, represent the full company from the Oderon besides the supers who
represent the stage army in the play."</p>
<p>"The yacht would accommodate a hundred," the king said.</p>
<p>"Oh, there will be no necessity for that many," the queen smiled. "Fritz,
you will not regret--"</p>
<p>"Regret!" the king exclaimed. "What is there to regret? What am I but a mere
puppet, a monkey chained to the organ of my master! A pinchbeck king, with
straw sticking out of my broken boots! If you had not come into my life it
would have been all the same--I should never have sold myself to that awful
woman to gratify the ambitions of a madman! If you can show me a way to save
your life, then you will have saved my soul for me. But can you,
sweetheart?"</p>
<p>The queen smiled bravely.</p>
<p>"I can and will," she said. "I would do anything to get out of this place,
where my days have been so wretched. And Florizel will come with us."</p>
<p>"Florizel is your humble servant to command," the prince murmured. "I have
some little personal anxiety, too. When those wolves once taste blood they will
not know when to stop. They will not disdain the breaking of a butterfly. I
shall not breathe freely till I see you and Clarette safely on board the yacht
to-morrow."</p>
<p>"And you will tell us your plan, dearest?" the king asked.</p>
<p>"I think not, my lord," the queen smiled. "It is a good plot, and I am
rather proud of it. All you have to do is to go on as if you suspected nothing.
When you are summoned to the anteroom to-morrow night, go without the slightest
hesitation. I shall come just as I am from the stage. And the rest will be so
easy--so easy, my dear husband. You have not seen our play yet, you have not
troubled to come to any of the rehearsals. It is much on the same lines as the
piece you first saw me in. I am not seeking to gratify any personal ambition,
it is all part of my scheme. The performance will be a little late because it
is part of my plan that the last act shall not be finished until we are asked
to see our gaolers. And you shall see how a woman's wit shall be victorious
against all the plotting of those murderous traitors. And now, don't you think
that we have talked here long enough? I must go back to my guests. I will leave
you to decide what is to be done with Florizel. He must not be seen here."</p>
<p>It was an easy matter, however, to find a hiding-place for the prince. So
far as that was concerned, he might stay where he was, seeing that those
apartments were sacred to the king. Here was a whole suite of them, and the
matter of food presented no difficulty.</p>
<p>The music was still drifting dreamily on as the queen returned to the
ballroom. The dark sinister figure of Rutzstin loomed in one the doorways
presently. He stood there as if watching something, his eyes were hard and
sombre. He was master there, and he knew it. Only a few hours more, and all
this would be changed.</p>
<p>"You do not dance?" the queen asked gaily.</p>
<p>A sour smile lit up Rutzstin's wrinkled face ominously for a second.</p>
<p>"My dancing days are over, madame," he said. "There are some that dance even
on the edge of a volcano. They did it in the saloons at Versailles before the
Revolution. And history is a thing that is apt to repeat itself."</p>
<p>There was no misunderstanding the threat underlying this insolent speech.
Just for a moment the blood glowed in the queen's cheeks, then she smiled
again.</p>
<p>"But you will come and see me act to-morrow night?" she said.</p>
<p>"Ay, I'll come and see you do that," Rutzstin croaked. "What is it that
Shakespeare says?--'A poor player, who frets and fumes her hour upon the stage,
and then is seen no more!' Do I quote the poet correctly, madame?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly," the queen said gravely. "'And then is seen no more!' Now, I
wonder if you would be very distressed if that proved to be true. Do you think
you would count?"</p>
<p>The queen turned away without waiting a reply to her question. She did not
see the murderous gleam in the old fanatic's eye. He was blind to all beauty
now; he could see nothing but that wild scheme of his for the expansion of the
territory of Montenana; he was prepared to wade in blood to get to it. And all
the glitter and gaiety and frothy folly was so much added fuel to the blaze of
his passion. He could hear the noise and bustle in the theatre as he came out
of the king's cabinet after a private audience the following afternoon. The
curtain was up, and the queen, together with Bertha Venis and Clarette and the
rest of the company, was watching the manager drilling the stage army of
supers, who seemed by no means raw to the work. Rutzstin frowned as he saw the
Montenana uniform degraded, as he would have called it.</p>
<p>"This must not be, madame," he said harshly. "After all, this is only a
play. It is not the custom with any nation to allow the national uniform to be
dragged--"</p>
<p>"Do you presume to dictate to me?" the queen asked gently.</p>
<p>Rutzstin muttered something under his breath.</p>
<p>"They are no subjects of ours," the queen went on. "They came with the rest
of the company--they are from the Oderon Theatre."</p>
<p>"I know a soldier when I see one," Rutzstin said madly. "Those men have
carried arms before."</p>
<p>"Of course they have. My good Rutzstin, in any first-class theatre it is the
object of the management to make everything as realistic as possible. And when
I want your opinion on this or any other question, I will ask for it. You can
go."</p>
<p>The queen stood there calmly, her head erect. There was just a little colour
in her cheeks, but she betrayed no sign of the anger that moved her. Something
brutal and bitter trembled on the tip of Rutzstin's tongue for the moment; he
caught his lip between his teeth and held it with savage force. After all, it
did not matter. It was only for a few hours longer, and the struggle would be
finished, the house of cards come fluttering to the ground. Outside under the
oleander trees on the boulevard Rutzstin encountered Schenteim smoking a
cigarette. The big black-bearded mountaineer looked strangely out of place in
his frock suit and glossy hat. He carried his gloves in his hand.</p>
<p>"Well, you old wolf," he said jocularly. "Why so pleased, why so amiable?
Egad, you look like the conspirator in fifth-rate melodrama. Where are the
dagger and the bowl, comrade. Has the little queen been offending you
again?"</p>
<p>Rutzstin growled something in the back of his throat.</p>
<p>"For the last time," he said; "for the last time, Schenteim. After to-day
she shall be no more than a white wisp of flesh for the crows to pick. You are
ready?"</p>
<p>The big man laughed cheerfully as Rutzstin passed on. He glanced up at the
castle overhead blazing in the sunshine. His smile was not pleasant to see.</p>
<p>"I shall be ready, dolt," he muttered. "Oh, yes, we shall be ready! And you
think to make sure of me; Rutzstin, eh? There are two heads to fall
to-night--and there is a third. And when that has fallen our dear old Rutzstin
will be at rest, too!"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER X.--"All the World's a Stage--"</h2>
<p>A score of the queen's intimates were dining with her in the yellow parlour.
These for the most part consisted of the leading characters in the royal drama.
The king was not present--it was understood that he disapproved of this new
frivolity. The theatre was in the hands of a gang of workmen. An hour or so
later, and some fifteen hundred guests would be gathered there. A supper and
dance would follow, and these would bring to a fitting climax the gaieties of
the Rusta season. On the morrow the court would move to the summer palace on
the Danube.</p>
<p>All this was gravely recorded in the Continental Press. There were those,
smiling grimly to themselves, who knew better. The next news from Rusta would
be a tragedy thrilling Europe from one end to the other.</p>
<p>And yet Queen Nita had never been more gay and heedless. She was looking
forward with the keenest interest to the coming performance. To a certain
extent it would embody the history of her life--most of the scenes she had
written herself. She had plunged into the scheme heart and soul at the time
when life seemed to have lost its savour. She had nothing to live for--the king
was hopelessly estranged from her, or so the gossip ran.</p>
<p>She had commanded most of the old troupe of colleagues from the Oderon. They
had come east on a special express, eager and breathless for the adventure, and
to-morrow they would be gone again. Here were Bertha Venis and Clarette and all
the rest. A stream of chatter ran like a rippling brook round the table. Most
of them were already dressed for the first act of the drama. No servants were
in the room, for the players were waiting on themselves.</p>
<p>Clarette looked questionably at her royal hostess.</p>
<p>"What is the matter with you to night?" she asked. "You are dazzling. And
those blue eyes of yours are wells of happiness. Are you not afraid?"</p>
<p>The last words came in a whisper. The rest of the company were listening to
some sparkling anecdotes that Henri Navane, the leading comedy star, was
telling. Clarette's face grew a little grave as she spoke.</p>
<p>"I was never so happy in my life," the queen murmured. "Ma cherie, I have
found that which was lost. To be candid, it was never lost at all. I was like
the old woman who looked for her spectacles when they were on her forehead all
the time. But I speak a parables; you don't know what I mean."</p>
<p>Clarette's eyes grew soft and luminous.</p>
<p>"I do," she whispered. "He has come back to you again! Child, it was a
daring experiment. I always had an uneasy feeling that you would fail."</p>
<p>"And you were right, Clarette; it has failed. My dream is ended. I must have
been mad to think that I am the stuff that queens are made of. And yet I tried;
God knows I tried! But Rutzstin and the rest had poisoned the wells. Montenana
knows me only as a feather-headed mummer who cares nothing for suffering and
sorrow, and who lives only for the pleasure of the moment. They say that I had
corrupted the king. And all the while I thought that he did not care--till last
night. And all the time he has loved me! It might have been too late; it was
all resting on the weight of a feather. And just at the right moment Florizel
came. Is anything wrong, Clarette?"</p>
<p>"Nothing," Clarette said with a face aflame. "I thought that he--he--you
know what I mean. So Prince Florizel is back again. He is well?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he is well enough. Those people took him by force to the mountains. But
for a friend amongst them he would have died. He goes with us to-night."</p>
<p>Clarette nodded her fair head absently. She glanced round the table with its
glittering silver, its costly appointments, to the yellow satin panels on the
walls where pictures were.</p>
<p>"Won't it be hard to leave all this?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Hard!" the queen smiled. "What is this castle but a gorgeous prison? They
think that I am going to play the part of Marie Antoinette. But they are
mistaken. I arranged all this for tonight for my own safety's sake. At the last
moment I meant to tell the king. He is so headstrong and impetuous that I did
not dare to tell him what I had learnt. But Florizel returned last night at the
critical moment, and I had to speak. And then it was, my dear, that I put my
hand to my head and--found my spectacles. I could see my love and my happiness
through them as clear as ever. But we must not forget the danger. If anything
happens to any of you I shall never forgive myself."</p>
<p>Clarette laughed lightly as she reacted for a bon-bon.</p>
<p>"We shall come through all right." she said. "A plot so daring and yet so
simple is bound to succeed. Has Rutzstin no suspicions?"</p>
<p>"I think not. He did not like the supers to be wearing the Montenana
uniform. But he does not guess. Your bodyguard knew exactly what to do. At the
end of the big scene in the fourth act you will detach twelve of your men, and
post them by the door of the ante-room. They will stand there as if waiting for
their cue. Prolong the scene as long as you can, Clarette--don't 'die' till you
hear the shots fired. And take care that the patriots who are defending you
from your betrayers burn plenty of powder. The more noise the better. When you
give that final, defiant scream, we shall strike. Then the curtain falls and
our guests go into the banqueting hall for supper and await our coming. May
they possess a pretty gift of patience, my friend!"</p>
<p>Clarette laughed in her own lighthearted way. And yet none knew better than
herself what dangers the night was holding. It seemed impossible to believe
that the grim shadow of tragedy was brooding there. Here was all light and
sparkle and laughter, gaiety and happiness shone on every face. Yet for the
most part they knew what was coming. It was well perhaps that they were all
trained in the school that could either conceal the emotions or simulate them.
Rutzstin himself would have been beguiled.</p>
<p>The feast was over presently, a clock somewhere was proclaiming the hour of
9. Down below in the street motors and carriages were beginning to gather. The
people of Rusta were assembled--cynical, suspicious, and none too loyal. There
were jokes, too, not meant to be complimentary to the queen. Amongst the masses
of the people the followers of Schenteim mingled. They knew nothing as yet;
they were merely waiting for the signal from the castle walls somewhere about
midnight. The powder was handy and the hand with the match was not far off.</p>
<p>But there was no sign of this in the splendid theatre attached to the
castle. Already it was filled by the favoured guests; they made a brave show
there under the crystal chandeliers blazing with a thousand points of flame.
The lights shimmered upon diamonds and pearls, upon silks and satins and
orders. Nothing more brilliant had ever been seen in the ancient capital
before.</p>
<p>Leaning with his back to the wall, Rutzstin watched it all sourly. His
restless eyes gleamed under his shaggy eyebrows. All this would be charged
presently. An hour or two more and the revolution would be an accomplished
fact. Nobody would have guessed that the wiry figure in the shabby uniform was
a dangerous regicide. And yet that was what Rutzstin had come to. There was not
a drop of pity in his heart for the rulers whom he had sworn to obey. His hand
went instinctively to his sword presently as the queen came on the scene. Her
brilliant beauty, the pathetic pleading in her eyes, did not touch him at all.
In her he beheld the source of all the mischief. As a patriot it was his duty
to sweep her aside. He would have taken her by the white throat and choked the
life out of her. But not yet. That would all come presently.</p>
<p>But the audience knew nothing of these things. They were watching one of the
finest dramatic troupes in Europe in a strong and moving play. It was flavoured
with the romance of Royalty; the stage was gay with uniforms. Even the soldiers
of the guard carried themselves like real troops. No detail had been
overlooked. Rutzstin was just a little interested in spite of himself.</p>
<p>Somebody touched the old man on the shoulder. He turned to see Florizel
standing by his side. Hard as Rutzstin was, he fairly started. It was as if he
were face to face with a ghost. The grim suggestiveness was heightened by the
deadly pallor of the prince's face. But nothing could quench his gaiety, or
drive the mocking laughter from his eyes. Even now he was enjoying Rutzstin's
discomfiture.</p>
<p>"What are these frivolities to you, general?" he asked.</p>
<p>Rutzstin growled something in his beard. He was feeling just a little
uneasy. Could it be possible that his plans had miscarried, that treachery was
afoot? But if such was the case the drama would never have continued so
smoothly. At any rate, he would know all about it in a short time now. The
spectacle on the stage was fast approaching its great climax. Clarette in the
part of the heroine had disclosed herself; the troops of the deposed tyrant
were beginning to rally around her. It was merely a question now as to who
should fire the first shot.</p>
<p>Across the restless sea of silks and satins and jewels Rutzstin caught
Schenteins eye. The latter rose and strolled as if casually in the direction of
the ante-room by the side of the stage. A moment or two later and Rutzstin
followed. The thing was done in the most natural way. The king, seated in the
front row of chairs, appeared not to have eyes for anything but the stage.</p>
<p>"Five minutes more," Rutzstin whispered. "Is everything ready?"</p>
<p>"Down to the rockets on the ramparts," Schenteim mattered. "And everything
will be in our favour. There is to be a miniature battle on the stage just now,
and the noise of the rifles will drown everything that sounds like strife
yonder."</p>
<p>"Good!" Rutzstin saw with his sour smile. "Then send for him."</p>
<p>He jerked his beard in the direction of the king. Along the corridor leading
to the anteroom a file of soldiers stood. They had nothing to do with the army
of Montenana; they were the supers waiting for their cue, the army of the mimic
queen ready to rush to the assistance of their beloved mistress when the time
came. Schenteim regarded them with a critical eye.</p>
<p>"Good stuff, these," he said. "I could do with a thousand or so of them.
Here, you fellow. Go to his Majesty with General Rutzstin's profound respects,
and ask the favour of a few moments in the ante-room with him. Say that the
affair admits of no delay."</p>
<p>The lackey bowed, and departed on his errand. The king appeared to listen
with a smile. He rose leisurely from his seat; at the same moment the hour of
midnight sounded. Rutzstin and his confederates exchanged glances.</p>
<p>The time had come for their foul, premeditated murder. In the eyes of those
two fanatics there was no other way. The whole theatre was ringing with
Clarette's denunciation of her enemies. Queen Nita stood in the wings watching
with admiration. As the king passed her she joined him.</p>
<p>"Oh, I am coming," she said. "I dare not leave you now."</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.--The Real Throne.</h2>
<p>There were half a dozen men in the ante-room besides the king and queen.
They had arrived there by another door, summoned by Rutzstin. They were the
leaders of the revolutionary movement. There were men of all ages, and more
than one of them shifted his ground and looked down as King Fritz and his
consort entered. And every one of them carried arms. The rifles looked
strangely out of place with court dress and the ribands of their various
orders.</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of this, gentlemen?" the king demanded. "We had not
looked forward to receiving a deputation. Rutzstin, will you kindly
explain?"</p>
<p>"You have forced it on us," Rutzstin began. "You and that woman yonder. We
have given you the chance to prove that you were worthy of the
confidence--"</p>
<p>A shrill cry of defiance came from the stage. It rang in the roof. The
theatre echoed with the quick, snapping fire of rifles until the noise was
deafening. Again the cry from the stage cut the air exultingly, and then, as if
by magic, the ante-room was filled with armed men. They were the supers that
Schenteim had admired so much. Obviously they had mistaken their stage
directions; they had committed an error in coming here. Rutzstin sprang forward
to expostulate.</p>
<p>"Out of this at once!" he cried. "Don't you see that the king and
queen--"</p>
<p>"Hands up!" a stern voice cut him short. "Hands up, all of you! You are
prisoners."</p>
<p>A splutter of rage followed. One of the deputation, more prudent than the
rest, backed to the door by which the conspirators had entered. It was locked!
All the time the din of the mimic battles on the stage continued.</p>
<p>Schenstein was the first to recover from the surprise of it. He snatched a
rifle from the hand of the man nearest him and pointed it at the heart of the
king. He was just the fraction of a second too late. The hoarse command rang
out again, there was a sharp crackle of musketry, and the room was filled with
blinding smoke. As the gray cloud sullenly lifted, the picture in all its
hideousness was disclosed. The defenders had done their work only too well.
Schentein lay there with the blood pouring down his face, a heap of
conspirators were huddled together by the door. One or two of them stirred
faintly, but that was all. Rutzstin was the only one that remained
standing.</p>
<p>"Seize him!" the king commanded. "And see that he is safely bound."</p>
<p>The queen covered her face with her hands. It all seemed like some horrible
dream. She had never expected her plan to be so swiftly and terribly successful
as this. Bloodshed had formed no part of her programme. And yet the evil thing
had been absolutely necessary--it had been forced upon her by the treachery of
the conspirators.</p>
<p>What she wanted now was to get away from it all. If Rusta, on bended knees,
came to her to-morrow and implored her to she would refuse. And the whole thing
was so terribly grotesque. Even as she stood there, in the face of this hideous
slaughter, she could hear Clarette's clear, mocking voice and the laughter and
applause of the heedless audience. Were there any traitors amongst them, she
wondered.</p>
<p>"This is no place for you, my wife," the king said tenderly.</p>
<p>"But there is nowhere else I can go," Nita protested. "Look at me! Would not
my face betray me instantly. It is terrible, but I must remain."</p>
<p>There was no word for it after that. Clearly the glittering audience in the
theatre suspected nothing. All had been done in that moment of noise and bustle
on the stage. The curtain would come down presently, and the royal guests would
disperse to the various reception-rooms till supper was announced. They would
not expect the actors for the best part of an hour or more. And by that
time--</p>
<p>Rutzstin stood there stolid and apparently indifferent. It was only the
uneasy glitter in his eye that betrayed him.</p>
<p>"You murderous dog," the king said sternly, "we have to thank you for all
this. It is a year since you set out designedly to poison the minds of our
subjects against us. I must congratulate you upon the way in which you have
done your work. I have been held up as a pleasure-seeking fool, with the one
object of gratifying my desires at the expense of my people. My consort of a
frivolous-minded actress who cared nothing for the man she infatuated. And yet,
you Judas, she planned all this. Directly she realised that we were prisoners
in our own palace, she set her wits to work to get the best of you. And though
you are a cunning old fox, she has done it. A score of the blackest-hearted
ruffians in Montenana lie there, and lie there justly. There may be scores of
others ready to take their places, but that is a matter of indifference to us
now, seeing we are not going to remain. If you were not an old man, I would
strip your uniform from your back and flog you round the ramparts of the
castle."</p>
<p>"I have done no more than my duty," Rutzstin said doggedly.</p>
<p>The king turned away with a gesture of disgust.</p>
<p>"I am wasting time in arguing with you," he said. "Take him away and lock
him up in one of the cells. He will be found sooner or later and released by
his friends. After to-night he can plot and scheme as much as he likes. Take
him away."</p>
<p>Rutzstin was smuggled out, his eyes glaring malignantly. Then the orchestra
burst suddenly into the national anthem of Montenana. The players trooped from
the stage. With a gesture the king ordered the ante-room to be cleared.</p>
<p>"See that the doors are properly locked," he commanded. "This is no place
for women. Oh, yes, my friends, the scheme has been a brilliant means--fatally
successful. And now to carry out the rest of the programme. We will have supper
presently, but it can't be here--it will be on my yacht. See that all the
sentries are got out of the way. We leave in half an hour by the lower exit to
the town."</p>
<p>The clock was striking the hour of one, and the royal guests were still
waiting their supper. At the same moment a strange-looking procession started
from the castle gates and made its way along the main streets to the open
country. There were four carriages, the blinds of which were closely drawn, and
guarded by a file of soldiers in the uniform of Montenana. At the head of the
cavalcade the figure of Rutzstin proceeded on horseback. The makeup reflected
every credit upon the actor who played the part of the general.</p>
<p>Late as it was, the streets were full of prowling bands of hillmen,
followers of Schentein waiting for some vague signal that would mean bloodshed
and trouble later on. One of them stepped into the middle of the road and
barred the procession.</p>
<p>"What would you?" the sham Rutzstin asked hoarsely. "Don't you know who I
am, fellow? Your master is up at the castle yonder, and you will know what is
happening before long. Were not the orders of all of you to wait for the
signal?"</p>
<p>The man dropped back again, muttering something. And so the adventurers went
on their way till they had passed the outskirts of the town and the open
country was reached. A dazzling beam of tight shot up from the direction of the
harbour and vanished. A window of one of the carriages was pulled up with a
jerk, and the king looked out.</p>
<p>"That was well thought of," he said. "I mean our friend Carl Rosen's idea of
impersonating old Rutzstin. We might have had all our trouble for our pains
else."</p>
<p>"Oh, the suggestion belongs to the queen," Rosen laughed as he tore away his
disguise and tossed it carelessly into a bush. "She seems to have thought of
everything. Was that light from the yacht?"</p>
<p>"It was," the king explained. "Thank God the danger is passed now!"</p>
<p>The yacht was pulling at her moorings; the white hull of her hummed with the
roar of the engines. Presently she slipped away into the open water of the bay.
It was all dark and black enough out at sea, inland the lights of Rusta
twinkled in the distance. Out of the mirk there suddenly rose a long, trailing
string of flame, that burst presently far overhead in a shower of violet
stars.</p>
<p>"The signal!" the queen said in a thrilling whisper as she clung to the
king's arm. "They have managed to fire the rocket. This means that everything
is discovered. Though we are safe now, I tremble when I think of it all. I
would not go through the anxiety of the past two months for anything the world
could offer."</p>
<p>"You did not enjoy your throne, dearest?"</p>
<p>"Not from the time I first saw Rusta. I am beginning to discover that most
of the pleasures in life lie in their anticipation, Fritz. And, after all, what
could one expect. Mine was no more than a mummer's throne."</p>
<p>The king caught Nita to his heart and kissed her passionately.</p>
<p>"Nay, sweetheart," he whispered. "There is a throne greater than that, and
we are going to spend the golden time in sharing it together. I have lost
nothing; I have found everything. My throne and yours is in the heart of the
other, and that glorious reign begins--to-night."</p>
