      ON THE SUBJECT OF POETS

    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony of Egmont contemplated the world with disapproval.
      He had reached the conclusion that it was no place for a
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happened in the year of grace 1467, amid the opulent
      surroundings of the Burgundian Court, when and where there
      were abundant grounds for his harsh assumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      In common with his cousin, friend, and brother-in-arms,
      Charles of Burgundy, it was Anthony's bad or good
      fortune--who shall say which?--to have been born in the
      expiring days of the age of chivalry. Almost from birth he
      had been imbued with the lofty ideals of that age, and in
      early years he had taken for a pattern upon which to mould
      himself that very perfect and peerless knight, the Sieur
      Jacques de Lalaing, who was almost the last to uphold, in
      all its romantic effulgence, the chivalrous tradition. And
      Lalaing, who might have lived for deeds of high endeavour,
      had been stricken down and slain at the early age of
      thirty-three at Gaveren, in a battle whose sordid purpose
      was the imposition of a salt tax upon the oppressed
      burghers of Ghent.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a boy of ten, when newly appointed page to Philip the
      Good, Anthony had witnessed in the Feast of the Pheasant,
      the last princely endeavour to fan the cooling embers of
      chivalry into flame and to set on foot a crusade that
      should rid Christendom of the menace of the encroaching
      Turk, to whom Constantinople had lately fallen. He had seen
      that effort, sustained for a full year, languish and
      finally perish without a single knightly blow being struck,
      and there, it seemed to him, the spirit of chivalry had
      finally and utterly expired.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be sure there were still joustings to be witnessed; but
      these were no longer of more significance than tennis or
      hawking or any other of the exercises in which nobility
      sought amusement. The language of chivalry still continued
      to be employed; but the meaning of its terms had changed.
      Great orders of chivalry still existed, of which perhaps
      the greatest was the Golden Fleece, which the late Duke
      Philip had founded, and of which Anthony himself wore the
      coveted collar. But when that same collar was hung about
      the neck of the twenty days' old Charles, a blow was struck
      at the very foundations of an institution which demanded
      that knighthood should be the acquisition of personal merit
      alone, to be attained only after a long and arduous
      physical and spiritual novitiate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony, with a considerable armed following out of
      Guelders, had been one of the allies who had lately fought
      on the Burgundian side in the War of the Public Weal, a war
      undertaken on the knightly grounds of abolishing
      extortionate taxation and setting free from its intolerable
      burden the "poor oppressed people of France." Because
      deceived by this pretext, Anthony's disillusion was the
      greater when the true aims of that war of rapacity became
      apparent. Burgundy's sole interest in that rebellion of the
      French vassals against their King was the retention of
      Picardy and the cities of the Somme, which the crafty Louis
      was scheming to restore to the Crown of France, to which
      they rightly belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony had fought at Montlhéry beside his cousin Charles,
      and he accounted it an engagement reflecting little
      military and no knightly credit upon either side. At
      Charles' elbow he had been a witness of the protracted
      intrigues that followed; of the covetousness, discontent,
      and treachery among the allies. He had attended the parleys
      which at last wrung extortionate terms from the rascally
      little King of France, whom in a world of knaves he had
      been almost tempted to admire as the most perfect of his
      kind. He had revolted at the greed of the allies in the
      division of the spoils, and their complete oblivion in the
      hour of triumph of the "poor oppressed people" on whose
      behalf the war had been undertaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anon he had witnessed the Burgundian ruthlessness at Liège,
      and the drawing up of the Piteous Peace, which had brought
      that hitherto independent little state virtually within the
      vast embrace of the Burgundian Duchy. And he had observed
      the horrors and abominations of the vengeance wreaked upon
      Dinant for its resistance, so that men said of it, as of
      old men had said of Carthage, <i>Cy fust Dinant.</i> He had
      returned from that campaign retaining few indeed of those
      bright illusions which throughout youth he had been
      amassing. Instead of the imagined high-souled pageantry of
      War, he had beheld war's stark and piteous realities. The
      gallant joust he had conceived it had resolved itself into
      sordid, bestial carnage. And since then, his vision of
      other things rendered keener and truer by that one terrible
      glimpse of truth, he had viewed the Court and the great
      figures that composed it with a new perception of their
      real quality. Under a noble, glittering exterior which had
      hitherto deceived him, he now discovered mean
      faithlessness, vulgar mendacity, and sordid avarice. Yet
      despite all this, because of something within his own
      poetic spirit, he still clung to one illusion which lent a
      glamour to the world about him, until the Lady Catharine of
      Bourbon robbed him of that, and brought him abruptly to the
      conclusion we have discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contemporary chroniclers have done rather less than justice
      to this cultured, sensitive gentleman, anachronistically
      chivalrous in his Burgundian setting. Mention of him by
      those writers is so scanty as to be almost contemptuous,
      and little would be known of him at all but for the
      comparatively obscure <i>Chronique Scandaleuse</i> left by
      André de La Marche, brother of the more famous chronicler
      Olivier de La Marche, who was steward of the late Duke's
      household. Neither the latter nor the equally famous
      Comines makes any mention whatever of this Count Anthony,
      leaving us to suppose that his younger brother, the
      infamous Adolph, was the old Duke Arnold of Guelders's only
      son.
    </p>
    <p>
      Better perhaps this silence than the recklessly slanderous
      statement, penned, no doubt, out of sycophancy to Charles
      of Burgundy, with which Adrian de Budt dismisses the
      legitimate heir to the throne of Guelders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The extinction of the House of Guelders," he writes, "is
      no matter for honest men's regret. God will not long suffer
      that the welfare of a people should lie in the hands of
      princes such as the weak and vacillating Duke Arnold or his
      wicked and almost parricidal son Adolph. As for that other
      son, known in the old Duke's lifetime as Count Anthony of
      Guelders, and since then happily vanished, no man knows how
      or whither, this prince combined, with the weakness of his
      father and the rascality of his brother, a hypocrisy so
      consummate that in early life he deceived the world, and
      won the countenance and affection of even such shrewd
      judges of men as our good Duke Philip and his noble son,
      that thunderbolt of war, that mightiest Prince of the
      Occident, Duke Charles. This Lord Anthony simulated a lofty
      idealism amounting to little less than saintliness, and for
      this was accounted an ornament to that greatest and most
      coveted of all orders of chivalry, the Golden Fleece, and
      was foremost in the councils of its chapter. Because of his
      rich endowment of mind and person, but more particularly
      because he pretended to observe a chastity such as is
      prescribed for, but seldom discovered in our clergy, he
      endeared himself to Charles of Burgundy, who in these
      matters practised an austerity oddly in contrast with the
      more joyous habits of his sire. Yet it is an odd irony of
      Fate's that by the lack of the very virtue to which he made
      the greatest pretence was this false Galahad undone.
      Inconstancy in an honourable attachment and an adulterous
      adventure in Zealand were between them the causes of his
      extinction."
    </p>
    <p>
      Never was truth more untruly told.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to his having vanished, "no man knows how or whither,"
      one man at least there was who knew the full tale of it,
      and who has left that chronicle from which we may now
      reconstruct the event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Already at the time of the War of the Public Weal, Charles
      of Burgundy, who, owing to his father's failing health, had
      assumed the regency of the vast Burgundian dominions, was
      concerned with all those measures of statecraft by which a
      prince consolidates his power. His possessions extending
      over the two Burgundies, Artois and Flanders, Namur,
      Brabant, including Mechlin and Antwerp, Limbourg, Holland,
      Zealand, Hainault, and Luxembourg, rendered him the
      mightiest and wealthiest prince in Christendom--as the King
      of France had lately experienced to his bitter cost--one
      whose ducal coronet was ripe for conversion into a royal
      crown. Towards this coveted and merited kingship he already
      steered a course. With the title of King of the Romans, the
      Emperor should presently crown him to a kingdom mightier
      than any other in Europe, and to render his position
      unassailably secure, he was already buttressing it with
      desirable alliances. By marrying his sister-in-law,
      Catharine of Bourbon, to his dear friend and
      brother-in-arms, Count Anthony, he ensured himself the
      endurance of the alliance already existing between himself
      and the Duchy of Guelders, to which Anthony was heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beauty of the Lady Catharine had conspired with
      Burgundian aspirations to melt the Lord Anthony's
      austerity. It was a beauty that had melted the austerity of
      many men, and was to melt that of yet more. In the case of
      Count John of Armagnac, that beauty was hardly required to
      accomplish so much. For John of Armagnac, as all the world
      knows, was entirely without austerity of any kind.
      Greed-begotten disloyalty to his suzerain, Louis XI of
      France, had driven him into alliance with Burgundy in the
      War of the Public Weal. The alliance had subsequently
      justified his seeking the relaxations offered by the
      Burgundian Court at Brussels, and the soft eyes of the Lady
      Catharine--blue, mysteriously tranquil pools, in which a
      man might drown his soul--had been responsible for keeping
      him there when his welcome, never too cordial, was wearing
      thin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because in all that concerned a lady to whom he was
      affianced, the romantic, dreamy idealist Anthony was at
      this stage incapable of thinking evil, it became necessary
      for the Duke, himself, to draw his attention to what was
      passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Charles of Burgundy was never remarkable for any gifts
      of mincing diplomacy. The downright, uncompromising
      bluntness which he used in the transaction of private and
      public affairs was equalled only by that headlong audacity
      in the field which has made him known to posterity as
      Charles the Temerarious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought the apartments assigned to his cousin in the
      palace of Brussels one July evening, and found him to his
      exasperation, at his studies in his closet, a small chamber
      whose walls were hung with tapestries from the looms of
      Arras. He drove out the single page who was in attendance,
      and came straight to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Saint George, if I were betrothed as you are to a lady
      none too heedful of the honour, I'd at least make my
      betrothal respected. I would so, by Saint George!"
    </p>
    <p>
      On the rare occasions when he felt moved to swear, Duke
      Charles commonly elected to do so by Saint George.
      This--like the device on his banner--by way of reminding
      his audience of his English blood. Philip the Good, his
      father, took pride in being a Valois and French in every
      nerve of him. But it was one of the idiosyncrasies, almost
      one of the perversities of this son of Isabella of
      Portugal, who was of Lancastrian descent, that he must ever
      be affronting his subjects, both French and Flemish, by
      proclaiming himself a foreigner. Sometimes he insisted upon
      his English extraction. More commonly he boasted himself a
      Portuguese, which, indeed, his appearance confirmed. Short
      of stature, broad and powerful of frame, black of hair, and
      dark of eye, with a big-boned, swarthy countenance,
      prominent of nose and jaw, there was about him nothing of
      the fair and delicately built Valois. He contrasted oddly,
      too, with the heir of Guelders, who leaned back now in his
      tall chair of crimson velvet, faintly startled by his
      visitor's abruptness. Their mutual affection dispensed with
      any ceremony between them when in private.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Flemish wit of singular knowledge for his day, hearing
      them described on the score of their intimacy as Damon and
      Pythias, had retorted that they reminded him, rather, of
      Ormuzd and Ahriman, the powers of light and darkness. If
      the image is too grossly exaggerated in so far as concerns
      Duke Charles, it is not without justification in the case
      of Count Anthony. A creature of light he seemed, indeed; a
      radiant, joyous personality, with his tawny, golden hair
      which fell in a wavy mane about the nape of his shapely
      neck. Serenity sat upon his lofty brow and finely featured,
      square-chinned face; ardour glowed in his great dark eyes
      in which at times there was a hint of gold. They were the
      eyes of a visionary, of a poet, of a man of dreams rather
      than of action, of one imbued with an energy that was
      spiritual rather than physical.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his thirtieth year, and some three years younger than
      the Duke, there was still an almost stripling grace about
      his long limbs and slender frame, and this notwithstanding
      the mantle of dignity and reserve imposed by his lofty
      station and worn with incomparable ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      He smiled now in tolerant amusement of the vehemence so
      habitual to his choleric cousin. He spoke in the even,
      deliberate tones of a voice that was singularly attractive.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is it that is lacking in respect?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who? The lady herself. Who else?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling still, Count Anthony sighed. "Well, well! Shall I
      blame her for that? It is for me to make myself
      well-considered. Then, perhaps, she will come to respect
      that for which I stand to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is what I urge!" thundered the other's impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am about it now." Count Anthony took up the quill which,
      upon his cousin's advent, he had laid down, and pointed
      with it to the sheet of parchment spread before him on the
      table, a square, solid table tautly covered with crimson
      velvet which was secured along the edges by ponderous gilt
      studs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke saw a deal of writing, most of it erased. This
      prodigality of ink meant nothing to him, and he said so
      with his glance. The younger man explained himself. The
      long, delicate fingers of his left hand touched an open
      volume beside the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am assisted in my delectable labours by Messer
      Petrarch."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's he?" quoth the Lord of Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An Italian poet, lately dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A poet!" Contempt exploded in the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A greater than either of us, Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was by no means the first time that Charles suspected in
      his cousin a streak of madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A maker of songs!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His songs will be remembered when your laws are
      forgotten--great prince though you be. His name will be
      cherished when mine and even yours will have perished from
      the memory of man. His voice will still be heard in the
      world when your tongue and mine are so much scattered
      dust." Count Anthony sighed and smiled. "Who would be an
      emperor that might be a poet?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would, for one," said the Duke of Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only because you are without perception of what it means
      to be a poet. A maker of songs, you say. Do you conceive
      what vision is vouchsafed the man who can make songs, and
      what else he makes in making them, what spiritual
      discoveries he reveals to a benighted world, with what
      effulgence his songs dispel the darkness in which men
      grope? Could you make this contemptible thing, a song,
      Charles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could I?" The Duke shrugged and laughed, between derision
      and impatience. "I can make the songs that become my
      station. I made some at Montlhéry to the music of the
      cannon." His smile broadened, displaying the big white
      teeth of his prominent upper jaw. "That was music enough
      for the King of France. It brought Picardy and the cities
      of the Somme to the Crown of Burgundy. Could your poets
      have done that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more than they could have voiced the croak of the
      carrion crows that followed in your wake."
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Duke remained unruffled and secure in his contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I deal in realities, Anthony. Not in dreams."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dreams! You despise dreams and vaunt reality! Will you
      tell me what reality in all the world was not first a
      dream? Are not all things of human fashioning the fruit of
      dreams? Were they not first conceived in the mind before
      they were given visible, tangible shape? Is not this very
      world in which we move and live the product of a dream?
      Where else was it all conceived but in the mind of a
      Creator?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was scowling now. "You go too fast and too deep.
      If you are to argue the Creator into a poet, you'd best
      carry your polemics to the bishops. It need not perturb you
      if they send you to the fire for heresy, since at the stake
      you can dream of water to put out the faggots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles, I despair of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I of you. Though I may despair a little less when you
      tell me what your Italian poet has to do with Catharine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He lends my poverty a little of his wealth. I borrow from
      him. Thus: "and taking up the parchment he began to read:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cupid's right hand did open my left side ..."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he got no further; for here the Duke, now thoroughly
      out of patience, interrupted brutally.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If Cupid's right hand would but open your eyes to what is
      happening, he'ld find a better employment for your wits
      than this lovesick caterwauling. The Lady Catharine is a
      thought too generous of herself. You do not make her
      sufficiently aware of you. And you give her leisure in
      which to become excessively aware of other men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony stared at him, blankly indignant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, here's lewdness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the word, though I hesitated to employ it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I apply it to your mind, Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Apply it to Catharine's conduct. It will be more apt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony came abruptly to his feet, his head thrown
      back, the colour deepening in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In God's name, Charles, what are you saying?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I not plain enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Too plain, I think. You imply that the Lady Catharine, who
      is one day to be Duchess of Guelders and the mother of
      future dukes--" He could not complete the expression of his
      ugly thought. But the Duke completed it for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "--is very much a woman, and the subject of too much
      gossip. Wait!" He was suddenly of a harsh peremptoriness,
      and, weary of skirmishing about the subject, drove straight
      at the heart of it. "It is being said quite openly that
      Catharine was the subject of Auxonne's quarrel with
      d'Épinal; and now there are rumours of bad blood between
      d'Épinal and Armagnac."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Armagnac!" Count Anthony's voice usually so musical was as
      harsh as the Duke's. "Armagnac?" he repeated. "For what is
      that vile dog in this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke shrugged his massive shoulders. "Catharine has
      smiled upon him, I suppose. She is prodigal of her smiles.
      And Armagnac has never been known to resist the allurement
      of a woman's eyes. The fault, Anthony, is yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mine?" Anthony laughed on a note of bitterness. "My fault
      that the devil of wantonness is in your sister-in-law?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your fault that, being affianced to her, you sit here with
      your dreams and leave the reality to others. Will you still
      prefer the dream? Will you still hug the shadow, while
      others consume the substance for you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony stood tense a moment, his thumbs hooked into
      the belt of red velvet, studded with golden hearts as big
      as walnuts, that girt his crimson gown about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you will give me leave, Charles," he said, after a
      moment, "I will seek the Lady Catharine at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll do more, Anthony. I will conduct you to her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Together they came to the gallery above the great hall,
      where a troupe of Flemish players were entertaining the
      assembled court. The Count, in his eagerness of suppressed
      anger, went a step ahead of his burly cousin. The latter,
      keeping close, already began to dread the mischief he might
      have set afoot. It was characteristic of him to act on the
      impulse of his mood and to reflect afterwards upon the
      consequences. Thus was his life made up of such occasions
      as the present. He mistrusted the purposeful set of
      Anthony's tall figure and the unusual grimness that had
      come to invest that fair and gentle countenance. He wanted
      no open scandals at his Court; still less did he want
      anything in the nature of a breach between two such
      powerful princes as Anthony of Guelders and John of
      Armagnac. In any such quarrel, particularly if concerned
      with his own sister-in-law, he must of necessity intervene,
      and on whichever side he intervened that intervention must
      result in setting the other against him and thus in the
      loss of a valued ally.

      SEVERANCE

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The antics of the players on the dais at the end of the
      long hall so fully engaged the attention of the courtly
      audience that the arrival of the Duke and his cousin went
      unperceived. It went unperceived also by the Lady
      Catharine, for all that her attention was nowise bestowed
      upon the mummers. She occupied a chair by one of the
      pillars on the right almost immediately below the staircase
      by which our gentlemen had been descending, and where,
      since Count Anthony had perceived her, they now stood
      arrested midway in their descent, observing.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was of a fair and exquisite loveliness such as might
      well have served for a poet's incarnation of his ideal.
      Tendrils of her golden hair, in violation of fashion's law,
      escaped about her brow from the dark band at the base of
      the small pointed hennin with which she was coiffed. A more
      daring violation of that same law was the extent of the
      décolletage of the close-fitting bodice of her gown of
      green and gold brocade, with its excessive revelation of
      the ivory perfections of her neck and breasts. Her sleeve
      very tight in the arm, grew suddenly to such a fullness at
      the wrist that a foot and more of it hung below the fine
      jewelled hand which moved playfully, caressingly, as she
      spoke or listened, upon the black velvet sleeve of her
      companion. This was a tall, loose-limbed, youthful fellow,
      arrogant of bearing, swarthy, black-browed, and handsome in
      a sinister, unpleasant way. Leaning upon the back of her
      chair, his cropped head of black hair was bowed as he
      talked until it almost touched her own; and when she looked
      up into his face, as she did ever and anon with wanton arts
      of coyness, their eyes were scarcely a foot apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke, for all his usually imperturbable boldness,
      glanced with misgivings at his tall companion; nor were his
      misgivings lessened by the thin, baffling smile that was
      compressing Count Anthony's lips. He had intended that
      Count Anthony should observe for himself; but he had hardly
      expected that there would be quite so much to observe. The
      moment, he now considered, had been execrably ill-chosen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were these two upon the stairs the only observers. The
      dallying pair below were dividing with the players the
      attention of those more immediately about them. In their
      neighbourhood the Duchess of Orleans, Count Anthony's
      kinswoman, sat frowning, as ever and anon she looked
      sideways at the Lady Catharine, and beside the Duchess,
      frowning also, and manifestly ill-at-ease, stood the
      elegant, courtly Saint-Pol, at present in Brussels on a
      mission from King Louis. Raising his eyes, Saint-Pol
      perceived those two observing figures on the stairs, one
      tall and scarlet, the other short and black. He cleared his
      throat to attract attention and sound the alarm, and
      scowled warningly upon the amorous pair. But they were deaf
      and blind to all but each other. The lady's delicate
      fingers continued their caressing, almost wanton movement
      upon her companion's arm, whilst Armagnac, bending closer,
      and greatly daring, shifted his brown hand from the back of
      her chair and let it rest lightly upon her shoulder at a
      point where the audacious cut of her bodice left it bare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony resumed his descent of the stairs quite
      heedless of the Duke's restraining hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave this to me," his Highness was muttering, regretting
      now that he had not taken matters into his own hands from
      the outset. "Leave me to deal with Armagnac. He shall go
      home to-morrow, by Saint George!" And he repeated still
      more insistently: "Leave him to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony, turning his head to regard him, still with
      that close-lipped smile upon his fair white face, puzzled
      him by his answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what is he to me, that I should dispute him with you?
      Madame Catharine is not yet my wife, for which on my knees
      I shall render thanks to Our Lady presently." And he went
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The comedy on the dais reached its end as the comedy in the
      hall below took its beginnings. The players had given good
      entertainment, and, on the closing lines of the epilogue
      spoken by their leader, applause had greeted them. Flowers,
      comfits, and money fell in a shower about them from their
      grateful audience, and then the noisy acclamations sank
      into the din of talk as the groups in the hall broke up, to
      re-form elsewhere and break again, and the movement became
      general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer daylight was fading. Came servants with tapers,
      ushered by a chamberlain, to light the flambeaux and
      girandoles, and draw the great curtains, each a masterpiece
      of Flemish art, vividly illustrating scenes from the
      <i>Metamorphoses</i> of Ovid. Men's thoughts began to turn
      to supper, but none supposed that it was of supper that the
      Count of Armagnac whispered just then in the Lady
      Catharine's ear, invisible under the band of her headdress.
      Of whatever it may have been, it provoked the lady's
      laughter, which rose above the general hum like a peal of
      little silver bells. At least, that is how yesterday Count
      Anthony would have described it. This evening he discovered
      no music in it. He found the sound detestable, the
      frivolous tinkle of a trivial, hollow mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking up and around at that moment, she beheld him,
      quietly smiling, at her side, and, beyond him, her
      brother-in-law, a thundercloud upon his ducal brow. Her
      laughter snapped in the grip of a sudden and instinctive
      fear; a fear rather of Count Anthony's vague smile than of
      the Duke's obvious displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count inclined his bare golden head; he bent a little
      towards her from his graceful, red-swathed height.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of your charity, madam, share with us the pleasantries of
      my Lord of Armagnac. Let us laugh with you, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      M. de Saint-Pol, the Duchess of Orléans, Madame de Blaumont
      with the Duke's ten-year-old daughter, little Mary of
      Burgundy, and young d'Épinal were the more immediate
      witnesses of the scene, and their eyes, if we except the
      child's, were anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed a long and awkward pause, at the end of which the
      Lady Catharine withdrew at last her fingers from Armagnac's
      arm, and he, straightening himself stiffly, shifted his
      hand from her shoulder to the back of her chair. Whereupon
      Count Anthony cried out in a mockery of courteous chagrin:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But we discompose you. We intrude. We place a restraint
      upon you. We disturb fond attitudes. This must not be.
      Charles, why did you bring me? We are not wanted here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The unready Duke made a noise in his throat. His scowl
      deepened. An exponent ever of the direct attack, he
      understood nothing of his cousin's enveloping movement. And
      meanwhile, as he found no words, his cousin prattled on
      quite pleasantly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam Catharine is reluctant, then, to repeat the
      pleasantry which moved her laughter. The pleasantry being
      my Lord of Armagnac's we can understand her reluctance. His
      pleasantries are seldom nice."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her ladyship's lovely face, clear-cut in profile as a
      cameo, was going red and white by turns; her bosom rose and
      fell in its revealing corsage; her eyes were lowered in
      panic, and then at last, seeing her tongue-tied who usually
      was never short of pertness, the Lord of Armagnac, spurred
      by the glances of ever-increasing witnesses, swaggered to
      her rescue, to save her countenance and his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you talk at me, Lord Count?" he challenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At you?" Count Anthony's tone suggested a faint wonder.
      His dark eyes grew dreamy as they surveyed the Frenchman,
      "I spoke of you, perforce. It was unavoidable."
    </p>
    <p>
      Armagnac ignored the subtle innuendo. "You will be wise, my
      lord, to avoid it in the future."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not wise. That is not the word at all. Fastidious. You are
      not a pleasant topic, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a movement among the spectators, an audible
      drawing of breath, and some one laughed outright. It was
      young d'Épinal, maliciously glad, through the torment of
      his soul, to see another--and one who had the right to
      it--baiting the bully Armagnac. That laugh stirred the
      fuming Duke into instant action. Almost he shouldered his
      cousin aside, to take the stage and plant himself squarely
      before the foolish pair. By his very presence he checked
      the Count of Armagnac's retort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Saint George, there's been talk enough. Are we playing
      in a comedy, Anthony?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is tragedy your preference, Charles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke disregarded him. He stormed upon that lovely fool,
      his sister-in-law, who in all her life had never looked
      lovelier or more foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have leave to go, Catharine." The dismissal was harsh,
      almost contemptuous. "Away with you! To your room, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose abruptly, like a puppet whose strings he had
      rudely jerked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding the Duchess of Orleans at his elbow, he impressed
      her into service.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take the little fool hence, Mary. Go with her."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seized the Lady Catharine's arm in his powerful grip,
      swung her round and flung her into the arms of the Duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, cruelty!" cried Count Anthony. The Duke stared at him,
      his countenance almost purple. "To part them," the Count
      explained, and waved a hand from the Lord of Armagnac to
      the Lady Catharine, who was retreating now in tears. "They
      were made for each other, expressly created for mutual joy.
      Do you not agree with me, M. d'Épinal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young courtier glared at him, understanding nothing of
      this icy mockery where knighthood, as it seemed to his
      ingenuous mind, called for fiery indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it had been my honour to have been betrothed to that
      peerless lady, I--I-" He faltered, at a loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir? Well? What would you have done? Instruct me.
      You perceive my need."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not laugh."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, no! With the breath leaping in flames from your
      nostrils, like the dragon yonder in the tapestry, you'd
      hurl your gauntlet down at the intruder. Indeed, I think
      I've heard that is your knightly way, even when your
      engagement does not go the length of a betrothal. You are
      in the romantic tradition, you suppose." Count Anthony
      shook his head in deprecation. "There is neither romance
      nor reason in it, unless stags at rutting time are
      reasonable and romantic."
    </p>
    <p>
      D'Épinal stiffened. It grew clear to him that
      metaphorically Count Anthony was slapping his face for his
      own adventure with M. d'Auxonne on the Lady Catharine's
      behalf. And slapping it in such a way that open resentment
      must render him intolerably foolish. There was a force of
      truth in what Count Anthony said which stripped off all
      glamour and laid brutally naked the deed in which the young
      knight had taken a vainglorious pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood abashed, without answer, and the Count, with a
      smile and a nod, turned aside to bend over little Mary of
      Burgundy whom he found beside him. He talked and laughed
      with her now as if he had no thought for any in the world
      but this child who loved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the furious Duke had gone off, dragging with him
      almost forcibly, by the arm, the scarcely less furious
      Armagnac. He designed to get him beyond the reach of Count
      Anthony's mordant tongue before irreparable damage should
      be wrought.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Charles of Burgundy was no diplomatist, yet a certain
      rough diplomacy he used on this occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," he said, "it will be better for all concerned,
      and for the preservation of the peace and amity so vital to
      us all, that you do not postpone your intended departure
      from Brussels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Postpone?" quoth Armagnac, who had no thought of going.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have prepared, I understand, to leave to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Frenchman paused at the Burgundian's side. He stared
      long at his host, cold and haughtily. Then at last, he
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You give me leave?" he said. "It is a little--abrupt."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke spread his hands, his face grave. "In your
      interests and my own and those of others."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that insolent cousin of yours from Guelders? Does he
      remain on the field?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here is no field, my lord." The Duke curbed with
      difficulty his rising anger. "Nor have I perceived any
      insolence. There has been," he added, warming as he
      proceeded, "lack of discretion, which my cousin of Guelders
      is entitled to resent, and which I shall resent with him if
      carried further."
    </p>
    <p>
      Each stared into the eyes of the other, and the glances of
      both were hard. Armagnac was the first to bow, as perforce
      he must when reason prevailed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, when a few years later war flamed forth again between
      France and Burgundy, and Count John of Armagnac was found
      to have sold his sword to King Louis, the cause of this may
      well have been supplied on that July evening in Brussels.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wishes are my laws, Monseigneur, in this as in all
      matters."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke turned away to seek his cousin. But the Count had
      already departed. Eventually the Duke found him alone in
      his closet, leaning from the open casement and looking out
      into the turquoise sky of eventide and the mists that were
      rising above the great ducal park by which the vision to
      the north was limited.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while dreaming here that Count Anthony of Guelders
      had reached the clear conclusion that the world--his world,
      at least--was no place for a gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke came to fling a vigorous arm about his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All is most happily concluded," he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I perceive the conclusion. Not the happiness." His tone
      was wistful and a little weary. It sowed distrust in the
      ducal mind. Then Count Anthony swung half-round from his
      contemplation of the eventide. "What are we, Charles?" he
      asked. "Are we real, you and I? Do we live and breathe and
      act of our own independent wills; or are we but the
      creatures of a dream--the dream of some vast consciousness
      other than our own--in which we move, dimly aware of the
      parts we are set to play, but only in a measure as we play
      them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save us!" the Duke ejaculated, accounting himself
      confronted by stark lunacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony flung an arm outwards, towards the black mass
      of the park, the mists, and the sky above in which the
      stars were palely dawning. "All that is real! It exists and
      is at peace. But we, Charles--you and I and Armagnac and
      the Lady Catharine and this Court of yours in which all is
      greed and lechery--we are not real, for if we were and were
      masters of our wills, we would shape things otherwise.
      Could Montlhéry have been, and all that went to it, before
      and after? Could Dinant have been, and the horrors that
      were wrought there in the name of knighthood? Could any of
      this be if we were real?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it profit you to ask if that which is could be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but is it? Is it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is. You may take my word for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your word, Charles? Your word against my consciousness?
      You are deceived. Or else it is the life of courts that's
      false, unreal, rendered so by all the ceremonial in which
      we trammel it and which creeps into the soul of each
      composing it; by the illusions of power which are its
      breath; by the traditions of birth and blood which are the
      empty bubbles in which it is reflected. Yes, that may be
      it. We are all actors in this world of courts, Charles,
      players of parts allotted to us at birth according to the
      names we bear. Natural we never are. Hence our unreality.
      And because we are not natural in ourselves, when Nature
      expresses herself through us despite our panoplies and
      mummeries, she comes forth travestied and grotesque,
      stressing our unreality."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke breathed windily. "It may all be as you say. But
      I'll hope it isn't."
    </p>
    <p>
      "While you are hoping. I will ascertain, Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me know the result when you reach it," the Duke mocked
      him. "You read too much and you think too much. You are
      suffering from indigestion up here." And he tapped his
      forehead. Abruptly he changed the subject. "Armagnac
      returns to France to-morrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pity," said the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A pity? What the devil ails you to-night?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I said below, he and your sister-in-law are excellently
      suited. In your place I'd have played Providence to force a
      match between them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God give me patience! Is there no sense in you at all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, I hope so. Consider: A wife might make of Armagnac
      a man, at least outwardly fit for decent company, by
      rescuing him from the infamy of his incestuous life. Whilst
      such a husband as Armagnac would curb any wanton
      disposition in a woman. Thus these two who separately
      remain worthless might united become worthy. Is there no
      sense in that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke recoiled before him. "Is there sense," he
      thundered, "in speaking in such terms of the lady you are
      to marry?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry?" Count Anthony laughed a little. He shook his
      golden head. "That dream at least is over and dispelled.
      And it leaves no pain, mirabile dictu. But I understand. I
      was in love with love. The Lady Catharine herself was
      naught; no more than the armature upon which I modelled the
      ideal mistress of my dreams. But the armature proving
      rotten has crumpled within my little edifice, and the form
      I worshipped being lost I perceive only the clay of which
      it was fashioned." He sighed. "It is but another illusion
      lost. The last perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was roused to fury. "Do you live in a romance,
      Anthony; or in the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I live at all?" quoth the exasperating Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'ld best rouse yourself to realise it. God's death,
      man, you talk of love like--like--an Arcadian shepherd. You
      are a prince; heir to a throne. And whilst princes may love
      as they please and where they please and when they please,
      they marry for the welfare of the State." He swung away
      from his cousin, across the room and back in long,
      ponderous strides, talking the while. "Myself, I was twice
      married without ever my consent being asked. I was six
      years of age when I married Catharine of France, to cement
      the alliance between Charles the Seventh and my father, and
      I was widower at thirteen. Yet, though I was twenty when I
      entered second nuptials, do you suppose I consulted my
      tastes or personal inclinations on the subject of the
      bride?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your indifference to women is a byword, Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke imprecated inarticulately in his impatience. "What
      has that to do with it? None could say it of my father, who
      has left me to provide for some twenty of his bastards. Yet
      he married as I have married, and as I shall marry again
      presently: as the State of Burgundy requires."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I give thanks to God that I am not Duke of Burgundy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So does Burgundy," snapped the Duke. "But you'll be Duke
      of Guelders one day."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even that if I may not marry as I choose. I have
      ideals, Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have insanity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The ideals of one man are the insanities of another."
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon this the Duke disdained to argue. He struck directly
      at the heart of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Armagnac is going. Catharine shall hear two words from me
      on the score of prudence which she'll remember."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A prudent conduct to dissemble a wanton heart! Fine linen
      over a festering sore! Catherine is in soul a wanton, and I
      desire no wanton for my wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wanton!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw how they played with each other, and that in
      public. You saw his hand, his foul, lascivious paw, on her
      bare shoulder. Do you not guess the prurient itch in those
      vile fingers, soiling her very soul with their touch? And
      you saw him whisper. Did you mark his eyes when he
      whispered?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, here is jealousy--jealousy that will magnify a
      woman's hair into a rope! Bah!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But Count Anthony went on relentlessly. "Am I to marry
      that, and have perhaps other men hereafter making free with
      one who, in her wantonness and vanity and greed of
      admiration, does not know where to place the barriers of
      reserve? And this to consolidate the alliance between
      Burgundy and Guelders. Our alliance Charles is firm enough
      without that. So think of it no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think of it no more!" The Duke was flung from rage to
      rage. "You are publicly betrothed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let the lady announce that she has changed her mind. Let
      there be reasons of state why each of us should wed
      elsewhere."
    </p>
    <p>
      The veins of the Duke's brow stood out congested. For a
      moment he looked as if he would strike his cousin. Then he
      mastered himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more of this," he said coldly, peremptorily, the
      overlord admonishing his vassal. "You are angry with her at
      the moment, and incapable of calm judgment. We'll talk of
      it again tomorrow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To-morrow!" said Count Anthony in the dreamy accents of
      one who questions Fate. "To-morrow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I commend you to consider well your position between this
      and then."
    </p>
    <p>
      On that threat, for it amounted to no less, the Duke was
      gone. Count Anthony raised his voice to call after him:
      "Good night, Charles!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the slamming of the door was his only answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone, Count Anthony turned to the night again, and
      questioned the darkling heavens upon reality. It must exist
      somewhere behind this shadowy phantasmagoria of a court,
      which obscured it precisely as the mists below obscured the
      park. Let him seek this reality, and, if found, be lost in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He summoned from the anteroom his page, a sleek, well-grown
      lad of sixteen, of the noble Guelders family of Valburg,
      who was already ripe for promotion to the rank of esquire.
      He gave him certain orders concerned with the lad's return
      to Guelders on the morrow, which plunged him into dismay.
      Then he sent for the master of his household, his
      intendant, his chamberlain, his secretary, his two
      esquires, and finally the captain of his guard; and the
      summer night was far gone before the last of his business
      with them was transacted.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his casement he watched the early dawn breaking over
      the park and giving form to its dark mass; and he pursued
      his dream of that world of reality, the promised land
      towards which he was to set his feet.

      THE INDISCREET ZEALANDER
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The abrupt disappearance of Anthony of Egmont from the
      Court of Burgundy was something more than a nine days'
      wonder. It was a source of regret to many, of humiliation
      to the Lady Catharine of Bourbon, and of fury to the Duke,
      who accounted himself thereby affronted in his dignity as
      well as disappointed in his designs. Never a man to brook
      the disregard of his inflexible will, he at once sent
      messengers to the provost-marshals of the various provinces
      composing his State with orders for the arrest of the Count
      wherever found. M. de Blaumont he dispatched to old Duke
      Arnold's court at Nimeguen, whither he thought it most
      likely that Count Anthony would have gone, for the purpose
      of inducing him to return if he were there, or of informing
      his father of the event if he were not.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither M. de Blaumont nor any other of the score or so
      of messengers sent out by the Duke could come upon the
      fugitive, and at Nimeguen there was no news of him beyond
      what was contained in a letter to his father borne by the
      page Valburg on his return to Guelders. This letter added
      nothing to what was already known. It announced merely that
      Count Anthony had left Brussels on a personal quest which
      he chose to make alone and from which he could not say when
      he would return.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the castle at Nimeguen they held a family council on the
      matter: Duke Arnold, his Duchess Catharine, who was sister
      to the Duke of Cleves, and their younger son Adolph, a man
      who, apart from a similar athletic grace, was so different
      in aspect from Count Anthony that it was difficult to
      believe them brothers. Where Count Anthony, favouring his
      father, was fair and frank and gentle, his brother was
      swarthy, hawk-faced, with a cruel, sneering mouth and mean,
      close-set eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sneeringly he solved the riddle. "A quest," he says. Some
      such quest as took Lalaing to England. He has always sought
      to model himself upon Lalaing, or upon what he conceives
      Lalaing to have been. Knight-errantry will be his quest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But he has gone alone, without page or esquire," the
      father reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, knight-errantry after his own crack-brained fashion,"
      was the airy counter. "Not to break lances in a lady's
      honour. His endeavour will be done on different grounds."
      It was clear that Adolph was nowise concerned by his
      brother's disappearance. It was also clear that he did not
      admire his brother. "God help Guelders when he comes to
      rule over it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I pray it may be long before that happens," said the
      mother gently. "In the meanwhile he may come by wisdom,
      Adolph; grow more like you, my child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "May God contrive it," added the Duke in piety, and in
      affection for this younger son whom both esteemed so
      fondly. They were to discover their error, like many
      another deluded parent, later, when they had helped to
      place it beyond repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may well be that Adolph of Egmont was correct in his
      sneering surmise, and that knight-errantry after his own
      fashion engaged Count Anthony on that part of his travels
      concerning which nothing is to be discovered. He reappears
      some eight months later in the pages of his chronicler, and
      Ghent, that prosperous city of weavers, is made the scene
      of his reappearance. It is possible, indeed probable, that
      the act in which he emerges out of silence was typical of
      the matters that engaged him in those months upon which the
      records are silent. Possibly nothing would be known of this
      affair--at least nothing remarkable--but for the influence
      it was to exert upon his whole future career, through which
      I imagine that La Marche has traced it back .
    </p>
    <p>
      A young merchant from the town of Middelburg in Walcheren,
      who was in Ghent for the transaction of affairs, had
      permitted himself with more daring than wit loudly to
      animadvert in a public tavern upon the government of the
      Duke of Burgundy. This rash young man, whose name was
      Danvelt, was particularly derisive in his allusions to
      events which had occurred during the Duke's accession-visit
      to Ghent in the previous June, at the time of the Feast of
      Saint Liévain. There had been rioting on that occasion in
      connection with the unpopular tax on all merchandise coming
      into the city, known as the cueillotte; and this rioting
      had assumed such serious proportions that the Duke, who was
      inadequately escorted, had stood for a while in gravest
      peril. From this he had been extricated only by a prudent
      but inglorious--and, in the case of a man of his proud
      stomach, almost comic--submission to popular demands.
    </p>
    <p>
      After his departure, the men of Ghent, cooling from their
      riotous fever, had leisure to reflect upon what they had
      done. They considered the intractable pride and unforgiving
      nature of the prince they had affronted, and dreaded at any
      moment such a punishment as his father had inflicted upon
      them at Gaveren for their previous insubordination. It was
      an affair which they ardently desired should be forgotten,
      and as a contribution towards that end did their best,
      themselves, to forget it. They certainly did not wish to be
      reminded of it in such terms as were now used by this young
      hot-head out of Walcheren, who alluded to it derisively as
      "the joyous entry."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the constant endeavour of the purse-proud, vain, and
      self-sufficient Mynheer Danvelt to be accounted of
      consequence in the world, a man whose knowledge of the
      great was close and intimate; and he conceived, after the
      fashion of his kind, that the readiest way to his ends lay
      in the disparagement of his betters. You must make it plain
      that in some way, however undefined, you are superior to
      the man upon whom you make it appear that you look down. At
      least that is the illusion common to the Danvelts of this
      world. If in addition he imagined--for he was a stupid
      fellow--that by ridicule of the Duke of Burgundy he would
      render himself popular in Ghent, he was soon undeceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      His crude philippics were received at first in a sullen
      silence of mingled fear and resentment. This he mistook for
      deference to his opinions. Emboldened by it, he waxed more
      and more recklessly facetious until suddenly a stalwart
      weaver, sitting near him, crashed a bludgeon of reproof
      upon his humour:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Swallow your tongue, you fool, and give us peace!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Taken aback by so unexpected an interruption, Danvelt
      blinked at him, bewildered; then looked to those about him
      for sympathy and support. Instead, he was met on every side
      by forbidding glances, whilst the taverner, himself, leaned
      across the table angrily to admonish him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may hold such fool's talk up in Zealand," said the
      fellow, having guessed Danvelt's origin from his speech.
      "It's a long way from the Duke's ears. But we don't want it
      here in Ghent; least of all in my house. So out you go. Out
      of this!" And he flung an arm backwards, to indicate the
      door and the evening sunlight on the dusty street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt, very red in the face, got to his feet. If he was
      short, he was sturdy, and with natural truculence he
      combined incaution.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know what blew me into your foul kennel," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some wind from hell, belike," the taverner answered him;
      and repeated more urgently: "Begone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Without urgency, Danvelt shrugged his broad shoulders in
      contempt, and made shift to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I go. I go. No need to raise your voice."
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved on his short thick legs without any undue haste,
      carrying his head well back, a man whose mental attributes
      were to be read at a glance in his physical aspect. There
      was in his prominent, aggressive nose and massive jaw a
      vigour which his shallow brow announced would ever be
      ill-directed. Conceit and self-sufficiency were in his
      rolling gait, which the taverner was not to know habitual
      to him, but conceived to be assumed for this occasion as an
      expression of contempt. Exasperated by it, he loosed a
      vigorous kick at the Zealander behind, by way of
      accelerating his departure, and by that kick precipitated
      the trouble which was to go to mould the destiny of Count
      Anthony and of some others as far removed from Mynheer
      Danvelt and his hitherto trivial fortunes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, whatever he may have been, this young Zealander was
      not the man to receive kicks with impunity. He swung about
      infuriated by a punishment as hurtful to his dignity as to
      his flesh, and with all his strength, which was that of a
      young bull, crashed his fist into the round, shining face
      of the taverner and spread-eagled him across a table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Riot ensued. Men left their cans to avenge the taverner and
      at the same time physically express their resentment of
      this young man's person and conduct. Had that been all, the
      matter would have ended in his being flung bodily into the
      street. Unfortunately there were some who took the view
      that he had been needlessly affronted, and some who in
      secret, perhaps, had shared his opinion of the Duke of
      Burgundy. It followed that in an instant two camps were
      formed within the narrow confines of that tavern. The
      company may have numbered some thirty men, members of
      various guilds, besides a few women who shrank in terror
      against the walls, entrenching themselves behind the long
      trestle-tables. Stools and drinking-cans and fists were the
      weapons employed in the writhing clot of fighters which
      surged hither and thither with Danvelt and the taverner in
      the heart of it, and which, leaving wreckage behind it,
      finally burst into the street.

      Now it happened that this tavern, appropriately bearing the
      sign of the Magpie, was situated within a stone's throw of
      the great market place and the State House. And it happened
      further that the Burgomaster's watch was leisurely
      patrolling the square at this moment. Attracted by the
      turbulence, it came quickly to the battlefield, some
      half-dozen strong, and the men reversing their short
      halberts, and using the butts as staves, belaboured the
      heaving mass, breaking a head or two in the process. They
      might have done no more than add to the turmoil and
      confusion but that at this moment a gentleman on a big
      white horse came riding up the street attended by a mounted
      servant. The gentleman, young and fair and good to look
      upon, richly dressed and wearing the black liripipe from
      his round velvet hat swathed under his chin to make that
      headdress secure, took in the situation at a glance,
      distinguishing the men of the watch who strove shoulder to
      shoulder on the far side of these disturbers of the peace.
      Like a good citizen he accounted it his duty to lend
      assistance to the servants of the law. He spoke a word to
      his servant, and thrusting his horse forward, yet
      restraining it with great skill at the same time, he forced
      the little crowd to give way on either side of him. Into
      the gap he urged his steed, his servant following, whilst
      with the butt of his whip he smote here a head and there a
      shoulder, commanding them at the same time to desist and
      stand. It was enough. Finding themselves assailed by
      horsemen, the rioters imagined that they had to deal with
      the Burgundian provost, whose hand was a deal heavier than
      that of the native keepers of the peace. Incontinently they
      broke and fled, and in a moment all had vanished save the
      taverner and Mynheer Danvelt. Between the town watch and
      our opportune horseman stood these two, dishevelled and
      bleeding.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the spot, the taverner, whose name was Groothuse, made
      his raging, vindictive plaint. It was not enough for him to
      behold Danvelt's torn clothes and battered countenance. He
      meant to put a rope round his neck for the evening's work,
      the wreckage of his tavern, the loss of custom, and the
      physical injuries which he had himself sustained. So he
      poured out his bitter tale. This foreigner from Walcheren,
      this treacherous, rebellious Zealander--and all Zealanders,
      he asserted, were to his knowledge treacherous rogues who
      would murder their lord the Duke of Burgundy if opportunity
      offered--this ineffable treason-monger had dared to speak
      disparagingly of the Duke's Highness in the tavern which
      Groothuse conducted as became a loyal Ghenter. Because he
      had ordered him from his house--Master Groothuse said
      nothing of the kick--this rascally hind had struck him, and
      then there had been a riot in which he had suffered, as
      they could see. He wiped the blood from his nose with the
      back of his hand, and pointed to the tavern. He had
      suffered not merely in his person. His house was wrecked
      and his custom gone, as they might behold for themselves;
      and all this he had suffered because he had sought to
      defend the honour of Our Lord the Duke, whom God preserve,
      against this contemptible sedition-scatterer out of
      Zealand. He repeated some of the things that Danvelt had
      said of the Duke, as instances of how lost the fellow was
      to decency and loyalty; things which, to his scandal and
      that of the watch, appeared to move the mirth of the
      gentleman on the white horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, because the watch knew Master Groothuse for a
      respectable citizen, they accepted his account of the
      event, and this the more readily since Mynheer Danvelt made
      no attempt to contradict him. Because they knew where to
      find the taverner when they should come to need him for a
      witness, they left him for the present, and were content to
      carry off the battered young Zealander, as their prisoner,
      so that he might answer in the Burgomaster's court for this
      indecorous breach of the peace. The sergeant offered thanks
      to the gentleman on the horse for his timely help, and
      desired to know his name and place of abode in case his
      testimony should also be required by the Burgomaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am," he was answered, "Anthony Egmont, a gentleman on my
      travels, to be found here at the Toison d'Or for the next
      few days and very much at your Burgomaster's service."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke Flemish fluently and choicely, but with a French
      accent, from which the watchman assumed him to be French,
      as also from his name, which he pronounced in the French
      way. This and the suppression of the particle were
      sufficient disguise for a name which, after all, was borne
      by others besides the members of the ruling house of
      Guelders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that the affair made some noise through the
      town, and came that same night to the ears of the Sire de
      Vauclerc, who acted as the Duke's provost in Ghent.
    </p>
    <p>
      These provostships themselves were rendered necessary by
      the curious circumstances of Burgundian rule. It is to be
      remembered that no national unity existed in the states
      which had gradually come under the Duke of Burgundy's sway;
      there was not even a bond of federation to connect them.
      They acknowledged under different titles the authority of a
      common ruler, because their various lordships happened to
      be united in one person. Charles, who ruled in Burgundy as
      Duke, also filled the like office in the dukedoms of
      Brabant, Limbourg, and Luxembourg, and was in addition
      Count of Flanders, of Artois, of Hainault, of Holland, of
      Zealand, and of Namur, and Lord of Friesland and of
      Mechlin. To each of these states his accession was separate
      and distinct, and in the capital of each he exchanged
      pledges of fidelity with the representatives of the people.
      Apart, however, from that common sovereignty thus imposed
      upon them, those various states remained separate and
      distinct from one another, having no common system of
      legislation, no court exercising jurisdiction over the
      whole, no magistrate or civil officer whose warrant ran
      beyond the limits of his own province. Not even was there
      any agreement amongst them for the capture and surrender of
      escaped criminals. So that the hunted assassin or marauder
      from Brabant was safe once he had slipped over the border
      into Hainault or Flanders or Artois.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Charles of Burgundy was not the man to tolerate
      such a fruitful source of evil in his dominions, he had
      placed in each province a representative for juridical
      purposes in the person of a provost-marshal, invested with
      the fullest powers to proceed summarily against malefactors
      by sack and cord at discretion. And because the necessity
      and desirability of this was recognised by each of the
      various states concerned, there was no opposition from the
      native magistrates to a measure which might have been
      regarded as an encroachment upon their national privileges.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of the impression for ready turbulence which the
      Ghenters had made upon him at the time of his accession as
      Count of Flanders in the previous year, he had sent them a
      strong man for their provost-marshal with a stronger
      backing of Burgundian spears than were usual to a
      provostship.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man less stern than the Sire de Vauclerc might have
      perceived for himself that the Duke's interests would best
      lie served in such an affair as this by disregarding it.
      Because he lacked this vision, the Sire de Vauclerc
      conceived that, since it was against the Duke's name that
      Danvelt had offended, he, as the Duke's officer, was called
      upon to intervene and to deal with him. And because the
      unfortunate young merchant, being from Zealand, was
      regarded as a foreigner in Flanders, the magistracy of
      Ghent did not consider itself under any obligation to
      protect him, and certainly did not think it worth risking,
      on his behalf, the displeasure of a vengeful Duke who was
      already displeased with them more than enough for their
      peace of mind. They had seen at Gaveren, and more recently
      and more terribly at Liège and Dinant, the manner in which
      he commonly signified his displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      So when an officer from the Sire de Vauclerc, attended by
      ten lances, presented himself next morning at the State
      House and demanded the surrender to the Duke's
      provost-marshal of the person of Mynheer Danvelt, the
      Burgomaster made no difficulty about delivering up that
      unfortunate young man. The officer had precise orders from
      the provost, whose conception of his duty was to allow no
      occasion to escape of showing these mutinous Flemings the
      power of his ducal master, and the fate of those who were
      rash enough to beard it. Therefore, when Mynheer Danvelt
      came forth from the State House, his legs were in iron
      gyves and a wooden yoke--a sort of portable pillory--was
      placed about his neck, as was usual only in the case of the
      most desperate malefactors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus mercilessly trammelled and otherwise in most pitiful
      case, his clothes in rags, so that in places the flesh
      showed, his contused face besmeared with caked blood and
      with filth from the underground cellar in which he had
      spent the night, his straw-coloured hair unkempt and
      matted, the wretched man was paraded round the great market
      place for all to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a spectacle to excite pity, especially considering
      the fate most probably reserved for him by the
      provost-marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among those who compassionated him was that gentleman
      calling himself Anthony Egmont, who, further, accounted
      himself in some measure responsible, by the assistance
      which he had rendered in the fellow's apprehension, for his
      present miserable plight. From the balcony of his room on
      the upper floor of the Toison d'Or, our gentleman beheld
      the little procession of men-at-arms in steel headpieces
      and glittering corselets with the prisoner shambling
      painfully in their midst. It was the circular badge on each
      corselet, enclosing a Saint Andrew's cross, the Burgundian
      device, which instantly informed Count Anthony of the
      intervention here of the ducal provost, and so increased
      his concern and pity on the prisoner's behalf. With sombre
      eyes he watched the little procession as it passed out of
      sight along the busy square. Then he returned within to
      break his fast. But not the dish of succulent stewed eels
      nor the stoup of dark beer for which Ghent was famed could
      remove his thoughts from that unfortunate fellow. Pondering
      the discrepancy between the offence and its probable
      consequences, he was considering some form of intervention
      when he was waited upon by messenger from the
      provost-marshal with a command that he should attend the
      trial that morning of Master Danvelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      This might have its awkwardnesses, but it was not an
      invitation to be declined. So he presently went forth under
      that officer's escort into the spring sunshine and the
      bustling, brick-paved market place of that important city
      of a land, which, if not for natural beauty, at least for
      opulence and for achievement in the arts and crafts, was
      the rival of Italy.
    </p>
    <p>
      By way of the Cloth Hall and under the great shadow of the
      belfry, which reared its square mass three hundred feet
      above the ground, he was conducted by the mean alleys which
      had grown about Saint Pharailde into the open space before
      the Gravensteen, a massive fortress on the Scheldt defended
      by a projecting gate-house with octagonal towers above.
      Over the drawbridge, past the portcullis, guarded by a
      Burgundian sentry, and across the spacious castle-yard
      where grooms and soldiers idled, our gentleman was ushered
      into the keep and up a winding staircase of stone into a
      hall on the first floor. It was a grey and gloomy place,
      whose groined vaulting was borne on columns. It was bleak
      and scantily furnished. There was a long table under the
      tall trefoil windows at the back, with a chair of state set
      before it, on the leather back of which the Saint Andrew's
      cross was stamped in black and purple. There was a bench
      ranged against the wall near the door, and in mid-apartment
      stood a three-legged stool, at present occupied by the
      prisoner under guard of two men-at-arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wooden yoke had been removed from Danvelt's neck, but
      the gyves were still upon his legs, and he sat there,
      dull-eyed, huddled together, the incarnation of dejection.
      The bench in the background was occupied by the taverner
      Groothuse, battered of countenance and inflamed of eye, his
      wife, and a couple of his friends who were come to support
      his testimony with their own. The officer signified to
      Count Anthony that he might be seated there, too, to await
      the coming of the provost-marshal. The Count, however,
      elected to pace the stone floor to and fro, a man clearly
      without any of the awe of his surroundings by which the
      other strangers present were so imbued that, when they
      ventured to speak at all, they did so in whispers. He took
      their eye as he slowly paced there, tall and elegant in a
      pourpoint of black velvet that was edged with fur at hem
      and wrists and caught about his loins in a girdle of
      hammered gold, from which a heavy gold-hilted dagger hung
      upon his left hip behind, and a black leather scrip on his
      right hip in front. His black velvet hat was again secured
      upon his head by the long liripipe which was swathed under
      his chin. This he had retained, as if unconscious that he
      was expected to remove it. His boots were of the finest
      leather and with the exaggeratedly long, almost grotesque
      points which courtly mode prescribed. His gloves were of
      black velvet with a tiny jewel hanging from each tassel.
    </p>
    <p>
      He afforded those present an object for admiration and
      speculation until at last the provost-marshal came to
      command attention of another sort. In advance of him, an
      officer in steel and leather, with a little violet tuft of
      plumes at the back of his peaked headpiece, clanked into
      the hall by a door at the far end. He was followed by two
      pikemen, who ranged themselves on either side of that
      doorway. Next came a clerkly fellow in a rusty gown bearing
      a wallet of parchments, which he set down on the long table
      before the chair of state, and a moment later the Sire de
      Vauclerc himself emerged, a tall, stern-faced gentleman in
      black with a gold chain upon his breast and a small round
      hat upon his grizzled head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed by two pages in black and purple, one bearing his
      sword and the other his purse, he advanced without haste to
      the great chair. He remained standing a moment after he had
      reached it, his cold eye raking the thin ranks of those
      present and coming at last to rest upon the conspicuous
      figure of Count Anthony. His arched brows met in a sudden
      frown. His close-set eyes looked down his nose, and his
      voice rasped harshly in Flemish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know where you stand, sir. You have forgotten to
      uncover."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pardon," Count Anthony begged. He unwound the liripipe
      and, removing his hat, shook out his tawny mane.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Vauclerc continued to scowl upon him intrigued
      now by a resemblance to someone seen elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who are you?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A simple gentleman on my travels. Arriving yesterday in
      your city of Ghent, I chanced upon a brawl and lent my aid
      in suppressing it. Being commanded by you this morning, I
      am here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he avoided mention of his name, and, since it was
      irrelevant, the Sire de Vauclerc did not insist. He sat
      down and took up the sheet of parchment proffered him by
      the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the butt of his pike one of the men-at-arms prodded
      the dazed prisoner from his stool and almost sent him
      sprawling. He recovered himself, and with a clank of his
      irons stood hangdog before the Burgundian justiciary.
    </p>
    <p>
      His business was soon done. The Sire de Vauclerc had a
      brisk way with him, and it was at once clear that he had
      prejudged the case from the written statement he held
      before hearing the depositions. Nevertheless, Groothuse was
      invited to speak, and spared no vindictiveness in his
      recital of the prisoner's verbal offences against the Lord
      Duke of Burgundy. His bones were sore and his joints stiff
      this morning from last evening's business, and his
      condition did not make for kindliness towards the author of
      these ills.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still in full flow of accusation, which he had
      announced that his wife and good friends there would
      confirm, when the provost checked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough! No need for more unless the prisoner denies. You
      have heard, Master Danvelt, enough to hang you. How say
      you? Is it true or false?"
    </p>
    <p>
      This man, who had strutted it in Middleburg like a cock on
      a dunghill, was a poor battered fowl indeed this morning in
      the Gravensteen of Ghent. There was no vestige of a swagger
      in him now. Humbled before, the mention of hanging reduced
      him now to panic. He broke into a whimper of excuses. He
      could not remember clearly what had passed. He had drunk
      too much Rhenish, and if he had said a tenth of what he was
      accused of saying it is clear that he could not have been
      sober.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So that you do not deny?" said the steely voice of the
      Sire de Vauclerc. "No need then to trouble me with further
      witnesses."
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed to judgment, briefly and coldly. The law's delays
      played no part in the Sire de Vauclerc's discharge of his
      justiciary's office.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If my sentence upon you cannot teach you wisdom, it will
      serve at least to teach wisdom to others, making it clear
      throughout our Lord Duke's Flemish dominions as elsewhere
      that his lofty name is to be mentioned only in awe and
      honour. You would be well served were I to order your bones
      to be broken on the wheel. But the Duke of Burgundy is a
      gracious, clement overlord. Therefore you will be hanged .
      . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused there, interrupted indeed by Danvelt, who fell on
      his knees and filled the vaulted hall with his quavering
      protests and supplications of mercy, until his guards
      pulled him to his feet again and shook him into silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be hanged," the provost repeated when the
      interruption had ceased, "unless it lies in your power to
      ransom your neck."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To ransom it?" the wretched man ejaculated, and his
      stricken countenance lighted with sudden hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are from Zealand, are you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, my lord. My father is one of the wealthiest merchants
      of Middelburg." He could not suppress the rash boast which
      was never far from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are fortunate in having had an industrious father." M.
      de Vauclerc was sardonic. "Fortunate also in being a
      subject of so clement a prince as the Duke of Burgundy,
      whose name, should you be spared, you will hereafter
      honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord, I shall bless his name all the days of my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll find it cheaper than detraction. As an alternative,
      then, to the rope, you will pay a fine of a thousand
      ducats."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A thousand ducats! A thou--" Danvelt choked in horror at
      so vast a sum, vast even for the wealthiest merchant in
      Middelburg. True to his instincts, he offered half, and
      thereby moved his judge to an explosion of heat not to have
      been expected from so cold-seeming a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God! Will you chaffer here? Will you haggle with
      Justice over the price of your neck? I am reminded that you
      Flemings part as reluctantly with gold as with blood. Hence
      most of your insubordination--in defence of your money-bags
      when a just taxation is imposed. Luckily for you, whilst
      your blood is useless when shed, your gold is useless until
      you shed it. Which will you shed now? Resolve yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But ...I have not such a sum at my command. I--" He wrung
      his hands, he writhed in his distress. Finally: "Does your
      lordship give me time in which to find it, to procure it
      from Zealand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Provided you can find me a burgher of substance here in
      Ghent to be your surety."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know of none who'll be surety for so much. It is a
      prince's ransom."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a prince's character with which you made free.
      Well, well, among your burgher friends here, are there any
      two who will halve the surety, or any four who will quarter
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt hung his head and wrung his hands. "Too little is
      known of me here in Ghent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that little not to your advantage, probably. Ah, well!
      You must resign yourself to hang. You have till evening to
      make your peace with God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord! For pity's sake. I have two hundred ducats at my
      lodging. Take that in earnest of payment of the whole so
      soon as I can bring it from Middelburg."
    </p>
    <p>
      The provost shrugged his shoulders. "You weary me with your
      notions of how Justice is dispensed. The two hundred ducats
      and what else you have are forfeited when you hang. Now do
      I know your father to be what you say? And what do I care?
      Since you cannot find the sureties, the matter is at an
      end. Take him away."
    </p>
    <p>
      The pikemen's hands closed upon him and he was pulled
      backwards. He accounted himself lost when he heard another
      voice ringing melodiously through the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A moment yet, by your leave, my good Lord Provost."

      easy and self-assured, advanced until only the table was
      between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be his surety? Why? What is he to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A human being in urgent need of assistance."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Vauclerc stared hard at the speaker, and his
      thin black brows were raised. It is probable that he had
      never before met philanthropy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is your name?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall read it on the bond, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something in Count Anthony's bearing, something in the calm
      assurance of his tone, checked the provost-marshal's
      insistence. Instead he asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But are you acquainted, then, with the prisoner?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I saw him for the first time last evening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, sir, why . . . ?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "One reason, I have given you. If you must have another,
      shall we say that I gratify a whim?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A whim! God's mercy! A whim that may cost you a thousand
      ducats!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whims are commonly costly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Costly, ay. But . . . You must be a man of great wealth.."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've never ascertained its extent."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'ld better ascertain it now, by Heaven! Ascertain that
      you can pay a thousand ducats."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll judge so, I think, when you have my seal." Calmly
      the Count helped himself to a quill and dipped it in the
      ink-horn. Unbidden, as if obeying the unspoken command of
      this stranger's will, the clerk proffered him a sheet of
      parchment. Count Anthony bent down and wrote rapidly,
      signing with a flourish. He returned the parchment to the
      clerk. "Set me the wax," he commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow glanced at the document, and his countenance
      altered to such an extent that the provost-marshal, already
      sufficiently impatient, leaned sideways to read what was
      written. One glance at this order upon the Intendant of the
      Finances of the Duchy of Guelders at Nimeguen, and the Sire
      de Vauclerc understood why the stranger's appearance had
      intrigued him. He had seen him at Bruges with the Duke a
      year ago. Almost awe-stricken he looked up: then he came
      deferentially to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count was quick to interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A simple gentleman on my travels, my lord, as I have said.
      If you will accept the bond in payment, you may now set
      this man at liberty, leaving the debt transferred from him
      to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Vauclerc bowed without a shadow of hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, of course," and gave the order for the
      prisoner's release and dismissal even before Count Anthony
      had sealed the bond, with the heavy ring which he removed
      from his finger for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have been favoured," the provost admonished Master
      Danvelt, "by a most singular good fortune. Let your near
      escape serve you as a lesson for the future."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to Danvelt and to the others present a bewildering
      conclusion. Whilst all alike marvelled and speculated upon
      the identity of this gentleman who had intervened to such
      effective purpose, and upon his interest in this trader out
      of Zealand, Danvelt himself was so dazed that he scarcely
      observed the removal of the fetters from his legs, and
      Groothuse so infuriated that he forgot his awe of the
      provost-marshal, and broke into violent protestations,
      demanding to know who was to compensate him for all that he
      had suffered materially and morally.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was rebuked by M. de Vauclerc with the assurance that
      all that he pretended to have suffered was as nothing to
      what he should yet suffer if he permitted himself to forget
      the respect due to the Duke of Burgundy in the person of
      his representative. Groothuse trembled into silence and
      mortified dejection. And then, again to the general
      amazement and particularly Groothuse's own, the stranger
      raised his voice on the man's behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "After all, my Lord Provost, what this vintner claims is
      just. He should be indemnified by Mynheer Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      The spectators expected the roof to fall. The manner in
      which this stranger had intervened as surety had been
      sufficiently presumptuous. But to go the length of
      instructing the Sire de Vauclerc in the administration of
      justice was to transcend all bounds. The morning, however,
      was not yet at the end of its surprises. For the Sire de
      Vauclerc, usually so dominant, intolerant and harsh, showed
      no slightest resentment of this impertinence. He just
      laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him be indemnified by Master Danvelt, all you please.
      But I thought you were the prisoner's friend."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am the friend of justice," he was answered in a tone
      almost of rebuke; and on that Count Anthony turned to the
      vintner. "At what do you set your damage?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Groothuse gulped, recovered, and blurted abruptly: "Fifty
      ducats."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Sire de Vauclerc laughed, on a jeering note this
      time. "You lying dog! You'ld be well paid with ten."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him have twenty," said Count Anthony. "I will add the
      sum to the bond and so to Master Danvelt's debt to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this high-handed fashion he disposed, and, having done
      so, would have taken his leave, but that the provost begged
      him to remain, and this for a purpose which Count Anthony
      readily guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the hall had been cleared, and the two were alone, the
      Sire de Vauclerc addressed him with a deference which
      contained a new note of firmness. "And now, my lord, there
      is yourself. How am I to proceed without offending you? I
      have a duty to perform."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What duty is that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Orders to detain you, wherever found, and to send you to
      the Duke's highness under escort have been circulated to
      all officers throughout the provinces."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As a man of law, you know that such orders are illegal. I
      am neither subject nor vassal of the Duke of Burgundy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Within his dominions, my lord, even those who are not his
      subjects are amenable to his laws."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When they have transgressed them. I have transgressed
      none."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Vauclerc was uneasy. "I dare not, my lord, do
      other than detain you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Force will be necessary, sir," he was answered, to
      increase his discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust not, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony looked at him in silence for a long moment,
      studying the gravity of that lean, shaven countenance, and
      reading there how little the provost relished his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," he said at last. "I am lodged, as you know, at
      the Toison d'Or. You may send your officer to apprehend me
      there at noon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning his glance, the provost's cold eyes grew keen as
      dagger points.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will await his coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony laughed. "That is to ask for my parole, and I
      have already said that I will yield only to force. Regard
      for your lord the Duke must compel you to exercise it.
      Regard for me, if I deserve it, may induce you to postpone
      the step for an hour. The Duke could hardly desire you to
      be more urgent, or to use unnecessary harshness towards
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Vauclerc considered. The services of princes is
      not without perils, as he well knew, and, indeed, as the
      Count was very subtly reminding him. If he did not arrest
      Count Anthony, he would have to answer to his stern master
      for a dereliction of duty. If he did arrest him, he would
      make an enemy of him, and it could not be good to make an
      enemy of one who had been, and no doubt would be again when
      present differences were adjusted, the Duke's closest
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony, he perceived, was showing him how by the
      exercise of a little craft both horns of the dilemma might
      be avoided. He would be failing in his duty if he did as
      Count Anthony requested, yet he would fail without
      afterwards seeming to have failed. It would be easy to make
      it appear that he had used all diligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, my lord, not only have we no orders to use
      harshness with you, but we are all commanded to treat you
      with every consideration. No doubt you will have affairs to
      settle here in Ghent, and an hour is hardly too much to
      ask. My officer shall wait on you at noon, my lord. I trust
      you will be ready for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Gravely Count Anthony bowed to him. "I shall bear your
      courtesy in very kindly memory," said he; and on that they
      parted with mutual esteem and perfect understanding of what
      lay immediately ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the courtyard Count Anthony found himself awaited by
      Mynheer Danvelt. A little awe-stricken still by his late
      amazing experiences, the young man announced that he had
      stayed to thank him and do what else was required in the
      matter of the enormous sum by which he was indebted. The
      Count desired to be waited upon by the young man at the
      Toison d'Or in half an hour precisely, and passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Danvelt must have bestirred himself in his anxiety
      to obey, for within the half-hour not only did he present
      himself at the Toison d'Or, but he came almost spruce in a
      new suit of grey cloth, and a bundle of luggage was
      strapped behind him on the short tubby grey mare he rode.
      Mynheer Danvelt had had enough of Ghent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the inn yard he found the Count's servant with the
      Count's horses, and from their saddle-bags it was plain
      that the Count, too, was on the point of definite
      departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which way do you ride?" the Count asked him when, within
      doors, the burgher had made known his intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Back to Middelburg, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll go by way of Bruges, then, so that we may ride
      together and there is no need now to delay. The sooner we
      are out of Ghent, the better."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, sir, we are of one mind in that."
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the city by the Bruges Gate, and rode amain
      through those flat, low-lying lands from which the ocean is
      excluded by an embankment, compared more than a century
      earlier by the Italian Dante with that which separates the
      desert from the River of Tears. The melancholy of the
      landscape was mitigated to-day by the spring sunshine
      irradiating the dusty road between rows of tall burgeoning
      poplars planted with almost mathematical regularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode first in single file, Count Anthony ahead and
      closely followed by his servant, with the Zealander a
      little distance in the rear. But some five miles out of the
      city, when the towering belfry looked no more than a spear
      thrusting up into the sky, the Count slackened his hot pace
      and beckoned the young burgher to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt went readily enough. Not only was he a man of no
      reserves, but he was spurred here by a curiosity natural
      enough on the score of this benefactor who was obviously a
      person of some consequence. Without even waiting to be
      addressed, the burgher opened the conversation and this by
      a question, easily familiar in tone and manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you go beyond Bruges, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Count Anthony appeared to be studying the
      contusions on that bold countenance, then answered shortly:
      "As far as Flushing."
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not consider it necessary to add that from Flushing
      he hoped to cross to England in his quest of knowledge and
      reality, and in pursuit of a knight-errantry rather
      different from that which had taken Lalaing thither years
      ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Flushing?" echoed the burgher, and satisfaction was
      blent with his surprise. "So far then we shall be
      companions. That will be very pleasant."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count received the assurance with a smile. "Pleasant
      for whom?" quoth he, and by that simple question
      disconcerted the other's self-complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For me, of course," the burgher made haste to explain.
      "That is--that is, if you will suffer my company." And
      then, sensing the aloofness in this gentleman and becoming
      dimly conscious that he had perhaps used a greater
      familiarity of tone than was relished, he proceeded to
      offer some further explanation. "If I make so bold as to
      hope so, sir, it is because in Flushing it may be my good
      fortune to discharge at least some part of this heavy debt
      between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, as to that--" Count Anthony was beginning almost
      disdainfully, and there paused, remembering that to disdain
      a thousand ducats scarcely sorted with the character of
      simple gentleman which he had assumed. He changed the
      intended course of the sentence in completing it. "As to
      that, it shall be as you please."
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt, growing more at ease again, now that he had in a
      sense explained himself, became at last voluble in
      expressions of thanks for the great service this gentleman
      had rendered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I owe you my life and more, sir," was his peroration, "and
      I shall hope for the occasion to prove my gratitude."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So shall not I, sir," he was answered, and again was
      disconcerted. He found the unexpected quality of his
      companion's answers a tax on his wits. He was not
      accustomed to persons who answered unexpectedly. "Such an
      occasion," Count Anthony enlightened him, "must mean
      trouble for me, and inconvenience for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I see!" The burgher laughed. "I'ld weigh no
      inconvenience, sir. I would not, by God." His tone rang
      sincere, and the Count liked him a little better for it.
      Hitherto he had found him singularly unprepossessing, and
      had written him down as a fellow of little heart and less
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Danvelt asked the question that had been in his
      mind since first he had ridden alongside. "May I know, sir,
      the name of my protector, my saviour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name? I am called Anthony Egmont."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Egmont? Just that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Just that. Is it not enough?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. Oh, yes." The answer came precipitatedly. The
      burgher wondered almost had he given offence by his silly
      question. But he was conscious of a pang of disappointment.
      In a gentleman with such an air and of such stupendous
      gestures as that which had saved his neck that morning, he
      had expected something more sonorous, more imposing than a
      name so plain and simple and unadorned by any title. He
      spent some seconds in considering the deceptiveness of
      appearances. He had fancied--and he had been gratified by
      the fancy--that his protector was some great nobleman. And
      yet appearances there were that still continued to mystify
      him: if anything his mystification was deepened by the very
      simplicity of his companion's quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive me, sir, if--if I am indiscreet. Though I think
      you should consider the question natural enough. What led
      your worship . . . Why was it that you came to my
      rescue--to the rescue of a man unknown to you? Or is it,
      perhaps," he went on quickly, without waiting for the
      answer, imagining that he held the explanation, "is it that
      you had heard of, that you perhaps know, my father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That was it, of course. This Master Egmont must have heard
      of Frederick Danvelt, the most prosperous merchant in
      Middelburg, and in befriending the son of so wealthy a man
      would have had an eye to his own ultimate profit. The
      friendship of Frederick Danvelt was after all a very
      valuable possession, and the acquiring of it worth some
      risk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coldly his companion pricked the swelling bubble of that
      pleasant assumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," he said, "I did not know of the existence of your
      father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You didn't?" Master Danvelt was plunged once more into the
      depths of bewilderment. "Then, why? What reason had you to
      save me as you did? You had no profit to make, no object to
      serve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "None. I suppose, Master Danvelt, that in the world in
      which you have had your being, profit is the lodestar of
      men's actions, and you can conceive of no other. You would
      find it difficult to believe a man should take personal
      risks or expose himself to heavy loss on no better grounds
      than a humane desire to serve a fellow-creature in
      distress. Probably you would regard such a man as not quite
      sane."
    </p>
    <p>
      That was precisely how Master Danvelt was beginning to
      regard his companion. He thought he discerned something
      fantastic in the very way he expressed himself. Nor did
      anything that subsequently passed between them during their
      journey to Flushing serve to modify the opinion. So that,
      instead of coming to know him better as a result of
      association, Danvelt found that hourly he knew his
      companion less in a measure as this companion's expressions
      demolished one theory after another that Danvelt built up
      concerning him. So widely divergent were their habits of
      thought and their outlook upon life that it was almost as
      if they belonged to different races of beings. But that
      this Master Egmont was a person of some worldly consequence
      impressed itself more and more deeply upon Danvelt. It was
      announced in his very bearing, in his air of command, in
      the calm manner in which he imposed upon others a will
      which none ever dreamed of disputing; and whilst he used
      Danvelt with all friendliness, yet Danvelt was ever
      conscious of a certain condescension, of a gulf between
      them which not all his natural impudence could successfully
      bridge. It was a source to him at once of resentment and
      pride. One attempt which he made to know more of his
      protector was based upon a shrewd enough inference of his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is one thing, sir, I cannot understand," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was on the following day, when, having lain the night
      at Bruges, they were pushing on along the yellow dunes
      towards the estuary of the Scheldt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, you are to be envied," the Count answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Envied?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that there is one thing only you cannot understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt perceived the jest, or what he supposed to be the
      jest, and laughed. "I mean, sir, of course, one thing
      concerning yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even there you have the advantage of me. But proceed, sir.
      Expound this thing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That black-visaged provost-marshal in Ghent accepted your
      bond, just your note of hand, as a sufficient surety for
      the fine. That seems to me very strange; very significant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have this in common with you, Master Danvelt--indeed,
      perhaps I even transcend you a little in it: my father's
      name, too, is well known and honoured. The Sire de Vauclerc
      knew that my father, failing myself, would fulfil the
      obligations of the bond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A wealthy man, indeed, your father, sir. Whence is he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From Nimeguen," said the Count, who did not think it worth
      while to prevaricate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt nodded. "Ay, ay. I've heard my father say there are
      wealthy men in Guelders. But I thought you French."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have lived a deal in France." A flight of ducks went
      overhead, and afforded the Count a pretext for changing the
      conversation. "A great fowling country this, I've always
      heard. There should be good hawking in such open lands. Yet
      they tell me that Walcheren is chiefly famed for its
      decoys."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Danvelt, as light of mind as he was heavy of body,
      veered readily to the new topic. "Faith, yes," he agreed
      with his loud and ready laugh. "The decoy makes a quicker
      and fuller return than any hawking."
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or so before sunset they came to Breskens, and
      there hired a great flat-bottomed ferry in which they and
      their horses were ferried across the Scheldt.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the vessel drew alongside the quay at Flushing, Count
      Anthony was inquiring, of one of the watermen who had
      brought them over, what was the town's best inn, when
      Master Danvelt interrupted peremptorily:
    </p>
    <p>
      "No inn for us to-night, sir. We'll lie with my father's
      good friend Mynheer Claessens, who'll make you very welcome
      for my sake, and whose house you'll find a deal more
      comfortable than any inn. A wealthy man. Mynheer Claessens;
      prodigiously wealthy; a builder of ships and of all that
      goes to them; and a man of great weight in the town."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony yielded without further persuasion. The
      prospect of being received on terms of equality in a
      burgher household was not without allurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having paid the waterman, they landed, and by the Scheldt
      Gate in the massive fortifications entered the town and
      rode the short distance to Mynheer Claessen's handsome
      house by the Groote.

    <h1>
      THE UNFOLDING OF THE SCROLL
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony's first glimpse of her burnt into his brain a
      picture which was to abide there all his days, and which no
      later impression of her could overlay or dim. Whenever
      hereafter he should think of her, the mental image his
      memory evoked was always this.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood in the doorway of her father's handsome house to
      welcome these guests, apprised of their coming by the
      clatter of halting hooves in the street beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until her appearance there, Count Anthony had been taking
      stock of his surroundings: the brick-tiled courtyard about
      which this red house of goodly proportions formed a
      quadrangle, the red house itself with its steep roof and
      unusually ample windows, the shrubs symmetrically shaped
      and placed at regular intervals in tubs along three sides
      of that court; the borders of white and yellow tulips; the
      quail in their osier cage upon the wall, and the tame grey
      stork, advancing solemnly as a chamberlain or seneschal to
      meet them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she appeared, and he saw nothing else.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood a shade above the middle height, her slender body
      cased in a gown of blue, high-waisted in the courtly mode,
      the bodice laced across a white silken undergarment which
      rose in a broadening wedge from waist to neck. Her head was
      bare, the plain white wimple flung back upon her shoulders,
      and the last red rays of the setting sun lighted a golden
      aureole about the coils of her hair and touched as with an
      inward effulgence the delicately tinted, delicately
      featured face.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Count Anthony it seemed that he looked upon a picture of
      the Assumption from some cunning Italian hand, and
      afterwards he was to smile--though very gently--when he
      remembered how in prey to that momentary but overmastering
      illusion, before the holy beauty of that face, he had
      almost fallen on his knees. Instead, however, he continued
      mechanically to advance, conscious that her eyes were as
      steadily upon him as his were steadily upon her--eyes of
      clearest blue, from which a soul looked out that must be
      frank and pure and fearless.
    </p>
    <p>
      He experienced in that moment an inexplicable exaltation.
      If some verses which he wrote afterwards, and which La
      Marche has preserved, are to be accepted as truly mirroring
      his sensations, he was overcome by a sense that this was
      not a meeting, but a reunion: that his eyes had looked into
      those eyes before; that somewhere at some dim time he and
      this girl as yet unnamed to him had been indissolubly
      united, consecrated each to the other and made one in
      rapture and in anguish. It was like a memory, dim and
      elusive as a whiff of perfume borne on the breeze,
      assailing his conscious senses and in a flash escaping them
      again before he could identify its source. He was to think
      of it often hereafter, but never to recapture the
      experience, pursue it though he might.
    </p>
    <p>
      And he knew her name, he thought; knew that he knew it. Up
      through unfathomable depths of memory he felt it rising;
      but, before it reached the surface of his consciousness, it
      was shattered by another name spoken aloud in Danvelt's big
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Johanna!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A shiver of annoyance ran through him. That was not the
      name his soul had been about to yield--a name that stood he
      knew, for purity, for constancy, for courage, for loyalty,
      because so intimately associated in her person with those
      things.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it seemed she answered to this name by which his
      companion hailed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, Philip! You are soon returned!" First this expression
      of surprise, and then a question laden with womanly
      tenderness. "But what has happened to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The young burgher laughed off that inquiry as to how he
      came by bruised nose and swollen mouth and blackened eye,
      mightily at ease with her, proprietarily almost.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've had my adventures, by my faith, and might never have
      returned but for this good friend Master Egmont here."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he presented his companion, promoted now to the
      dignity of his good friend, with a certain hearty patronage
      which at another time must have made Count Anthony wince.
      At present, however, seeing nothing but this gentle lady,
      conscious of no presence but her own, he bowed very low and
      reverently over the slim white hand she frankly extended to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Danvelt completed the presentation. "This is the
      daughter of Mynheer Claessens. And here is Mynheer
      Claessens himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To greet our Philip returning from the wars," came the
      jovial voice of the jovial burgher who rolled forward to
      his daughter's side. A big man this, of a proper
      portliness, rubicund and kindly of countenance, shrewd and
      humorous of eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He embraced Danvelt as he might have embraced a son, and
      gave Master Egmont a generous and hearty welcome in words
      that were presently to be abundantly confirmed in deeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mynheer Claessens kept a good house and a good table; he
      had a nice taste in wine, of which there was a great trade
      in Walcheren; and he was well attended by devoted servants.
      Under no better auspices could Count Anthony have sought
      initiation to the domestic side of burgher life in Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper that night over the succulent ham of a boar from
      the Ardennes and a brace of ducks from Master Claessens's
      own decoy, washed down by a mellow Gascony vintage, Count
      Anthony, whose experiences in the past half-year had not
      all been pleasant, assured himself that one might live a
      great deal worse than this and have no ground for
      complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The talk, of course, was all of Philip Danvelt's travels
      and adventures, and he supplied most of it himself, readily
      responding to the spur of an occasional question. It would
      have wearied Count Anthony into somnolence but for the
      amusement he found in the note introduced into the
      narrative by the jactancy inherent in Danvelt. The young
      burgher made an Odyssey of his journey to Ghent, and
      presented the tale in such a manner that he was ever the
      heroic figure in it; and this without departing as
      outrageously from the truth as he might have done but for
      the restraining presence of Count Anthony. When finally he
      came to the part played by the Count at the Gravensteen,
      the facts constrained him to fall, however reluctantly,
      into a minor role. And the Count, for all his normal calm
      and detachment, began to grow uncomfortable under the
      wondering glances of his host and his host's daughter. This
      wonder turned to stupefaction, at least on the part of
      Claessens, when the magnitude of the fine was disclosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The merchant swore deep in his throat, and asked the
      question: "What will your father say to that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, indeed?" wondered Danvelt with sudden gravity, and
      such a change of countenance that Claessens laughed in
      good-humoured malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'd give a deal to be present when you tell him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So would not I," grumbled Danvelt. "Nor shall I; for I
      mean to tell him of it by letter to-morrow, and await his
      answer here before I start for home. Before then, too, I
      hope to pay my debt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Claessens was moved to still deeper mirth at the expense of
      his friend and rival in prosperity, the elder Danvelt. He
      sobered presently when his mind veered to speculate upon
      the amazing fact that a stranger of obvious distinction
      should have come forward as surety for so vast a sum. This,
      Claessens expressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What, sir," he asked, "was your inducement?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony laughed. "I have been asked the question
      three times already, and I shall be asked it perhaps three
      hundred before I die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the answer is?" Mynheer Claessens insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know the half-scorn in which twice already Count Anthony
      had supplied that answer, contemptuous of folk who could
      not understand the performance of a humane action for its
      own sake. But it was not the answer that he now supplied.
      Instead, holding by its stem his silver goblet, his eyes
      upon the purple mirror of its contents, he replied
      dreamily:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who shall say? Perhaps the future holds the answer to that
      question."
    </p>
    <p>
      They stared at him, and let the subject drop. But that one
      of them probed his cryptic utterance at least in thought he
      had cause to suspect next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had risen betimes from the great bed in the chamber of
      honour which had been placed at his disposal, and he had
      gone forth into the stiff formal garden, set like a terrace
      upon the dunes. Walking there he had found Mistress
      Johanna, all in grey this morning, from which demure colour
      she appeared to gather an increased demureness. Her golden
      head was cased in a wimple kept in place by a hoop of dark
      blue velvet, plain and severe across the brow. Thus she
      fronted the breeze--for the morning was fresh with a tang
      of salt in the air--when Count Anthony came upon her there
      among the tulips of which already she had half-filled a
      little basket slung upon her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are early astir, mistress," was his comment when she
      had given him good morning and made courteous inquiry
      touching his repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she stood a little in awe of him, of that indefinable
      quality blending radiance and dignity, which he wrapped
      about him like a cloak and by which he seemed apart and
      different from any man she had ever known, she betrayed no
      hint of it in her bearing. Frankly she met the gaze of his
      dark eyes, and with a composure apparently equal to his
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is our custom here in Walcheren. We are industrious
      folk. As industrious as we are peaceful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should be as pained, madam, to restrain your
      industry"--and he waved a hand towards the tulips upon
      which he had found it exercised--"as to trouble your
      peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled as she answered him: "You would not be suffered
      to do either."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I believe you. You would know how to defend your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Defend it? Who should trouble to assail it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, some reckless wanderer such as I, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you so very reckless?" She mocked him, but without
      challenge, and suddenly became grave. "Oh, to be sure you
      are. Yet hardly to the detriment of others from the
      instance we have seen."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you be sure that there was no detriment to any in what
      I did?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what you did? You saved Philip's life. To whose
      detriment could that be?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who shall say? Perhaps to Master Philip's. We do not know
      what the life I saved may hold. Perhaps to that of the wife
      he is to wed or of the children she is to bear him. Only
      the future can answer you. Always is it only the future
      that can supply the answer to the present."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," she said slowly, "is how you replied when father
      asked you what had induced you to go to the rescue of a
      stranger. What did you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more than I said. A month hence, a year hence, I may
      know why I did it, or I may die without knowing it. But
      some day, someone will know and some day someone will
      either bless or curse me for the deed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Curse you? For a deed so kindly, so disinterested as to be
      almost noble? Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That will be according to its consequences, for which the
      responsibility will be laid on me. I made myself in this
      the instrument of Destiny. Ah, mistress, it is a grave
      thing to take a life--a graver than men realise who do it
      lightly. It may be even more grave to save a life."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head a little and looked out over the dunes
      to the sparkling sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The more you explain, the less I understand," she
      complained and laughed. She was a creature of ready
      laughter, as of infinite tenderness, inclining to love all
      things, to see only good, since herself she knew nothing
      else.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Count read her as he watched and paused before
      replying.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is because I have no gift of prophecy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, sir," she cried in gentle impatience, "you will speak
      of the future when I question you on the past. I ask you
      only why--upon what prompting--you did what you did."
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he supplied what she required. "He was in sore
      plight when I beheld him. That moved my pity. I considered
      that his plight might yet be worse, and this so increased
      my pity that to allay it I went and snatched him from the
      cord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In short, you obeyed the impulse of a pitiful and noble
      nature, which is what you are reluctant to confess."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made a gesture of denial. "Ah! You think it answers you.
      But you are deceived. It supplies no more than half the
      reason. The other half lies in the womb of Destiny. I know
      that I was moved to pity. But not why I was so moved."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I have told you why already. Because your nature is
      noble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then tell me why with this noble nature of mine I chanced
      to be so opportunely at hand. Why did I ride into Ghent at
      that precise hour when they were brawling in the street by
      which I came, and so rode into the life of Master Danvelt?
      Was it, perhaps-" He broke off. Then, lowering his voice to
      such a tone of reverence as to rob his words of all
      offence, he resumed: "Was it perhaps so that I might ride
      into yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Into mine?" Frightened eyes looked into his, then quickly
      out to sea again. She caught her breath, and, observing the
      delicate profile of her half-averted face, he saw that it
      turned deathly white.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was suddenly aware that he had laid violent, bruising
      hands upon this pure, tender soul. Conscience smote him and
      amazement at himself, at the crude daring of his speech,
      worthy of some glib court gallant skilled in the paltry
      arts of dalliance. Yet he knew that the spirit prompting it
      had been of no such trivial kind; that he had spoken on an
      impulse from the depths of his being, from some prevision
      of the future, as instinctive as had been yester eve that
      uncanny glimpse into some remote and unsuspected past.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sought to amend, to modify the impression he might have
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Am I not here," he asked, "as a consequence of my act?" He
      used a Moslem phrase, odd in her ears and incomprehensible.
      "It was written that I should save Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Written? Written? How? Where was it written?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On the scroll of Destiny. What else is written we shall
      find as it unrolls. We are only at the beginning of that
      scroll."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was relieved to hear her laugh: a silvery laugh, so like
      the Lady Catharine's, and yet so different. It assured him
      that she had recovered from the perturbation he had caused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a master of vagueness, sir," she protested. "Once
      I essayed to read a book that was written as you talk. I
      understood not a word of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll swear the fault lay in the author as it now lies in
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You swear, then, what you do not believe. The only virtue
      of that is its courtesy."
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came Mynheer Claessens to join them, and bid them
      in to table, where Danvelt--his contusions changed from
      blue to yellow--waited with the impatience of the healthy
      trencherman.
    </p>
    <p>
      He announced whilst they broke their fast that he had
      written to his father and would presently be gratified by
      Mynheer Claessens's opinion on his letter. This moved a
      caustic humour in the merchant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever my opinion, there can be no doubt of your
      father's, Philip. And it is his that will be interesting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip grunted, his mouth being too full of salted herring
      for a clearer expression of his disgust at his host's
      deplorable mirth. Thus encouraged, Claessens continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      "He'll clip your wings, my lad. He'll curb your thirst for
      travel by steering you firmly into the harbour of wedlock."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart," cried Danvelt, his mouth being free at
      last. "If he'll do that I'll count the thousand ducats well
      spent." He laughed noisily, and ogled Mistress Johanna so
      bold and meaningly that Count Anthony asked himself was a
      furtherance of their union what Destiny had required of
      him?
    </p>
    <p>
      "You spendthrift," Claessens admonished him. "Waste finds
      no favour in Johanna's eyes. She'll need to school you in
      thrift."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lad assumed an air of gallantry. "She may school me in
      anything she pleases and just so soon as it is her pleasure
      to begin."
    </p>
    <p>
      Johanna offered no comment. She sat with eyes upon her
      plate, her countenance so set that nothing was to be read
      in it unless one looked closer than Count Anthony dared to
      look just then.
    </p>
    <p>
      From what he had heard, he drew the conclusion that here a
      match was already settled. These children of two wealthy
      burghers were already destined to each other, no doubt with
      the object of amassing greater wealth by a combination of
      golden forces. That was the vain purpose of all burgher
      lives. He was conscious of a little chill at his heart, and
      suddenly was marvelling at himself. He was a Prince of the
      House of Guelders, after all, and heir to its throne. Was
      it possible that, almost without suspecting it, he should
      have been conceiving hopes where a burgher's daughter was
      concerned. If it chilled him to discover her fittingly
      betrothed to one of her own class, the sooner he departed
      the better for himself and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so he spoke of his voyage to England, and desired to
      know when Mynheer Claessens could afford him passage.

      "What do you seek in England, Master Egmont?" she had asked
      him suddenly, and at her question his fingers, which had
      softly been stroking the lute-strings into sound, fell
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was on the afternoon of the following day, a day of
      wind and rain which kept them within doors. After dining,
      they had come to this bower of hers above the garden, from
      whose windows you looked out upon dunes and ramparts and
      more dunes, and then the sea, now grey and sullen and
      obscured in misty rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pleasant chamber, hung with brightly coloured
      Flemish tapestries depicting sacred subjects. Here Michael,
      the celestial knight, with flaming sword, hurled Lucifer
      and his legions down in ruin. There Gabriel, bearing a
      lily-wand, descended on a cloud to make the Annunciation,
      and yonder Raphael stood rending the fish under the
      wondering gaze of young Tobias. In these archangelic
      surroundings Count Anthony had found a lute, a pretty thing
      of mulberry and ebony and ivory, with which he had retired
      to the ample window-seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      His music reminded Mynheer Claessens that matters of
      importance demanded his presence in the counting-house, and
      sent the over-dined Danvelt into a profound slumber.
      Remained him for only audience Mistress Johanna, who came
      to occupy the other angle of the window-seat, and, herself
      but an indifferent performer, to admire his skill, which
      indeed was considerable, and to encourage him to continue
      in its exercise. From strumming little airs of Brabant and
      Picardy and his native Guelders, he was moved, perhaps by
      the sympathetic quality of his audience, to essay a little
      song which he had made. He did scarcely more than speak his
      lines to a rippling accompaniment of lute-strings.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased, and in thoughtful silence they both sat awhile.
      The only sounds were the gentle patter of the rain outside
      and the stertorous breathing of the slumbering Danvelt. The
      young burgher sprawled uncouthly in his chair, with stumpy,
      ill-shaped hands locked tight across a paunch too heavy
      already for so young a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maiden moved and sighed. Deep in her soul something had
      been quickened by that song, a new conception of life, its
      evanescence and its glory. Like one entranced, she sat
      until Count Anthony, perhaps to break the spell that was
      surcharging him, began softly to play a trivial, tripping
      dance measure. Then came her question: "What do you seek in
      England?"
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of her voice his playing ceased. He rose and
      went to set down the lute on a side table beside the bowl
      of white tulips disposed there by Johanna. Returning thence
      to the window, he stood looking out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If this weather holds," he said casually, "it will end by
      making me a burden on your hospitality."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you go to England?" she asked him again, and
      thrilled him now by the direct form of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To follow in the footsteps of Lalaing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who was he?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You never heard of Jacques de Lalaing? He was a knight, a
      very perfect, gentle knight of Duke Philip's court, whose
      lovely brief life I have had the vainglory to take as a
      pattern for my own."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on to tell her of Lalaing, of his prowess, his
      nobility, and his purity of heart. In the telling he spoke
      intimately of courts and their inhabitants, of a world
      which to her was almost fabulous, peopled by beings other
      indeed than herself and those among whom her days were
      spent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Like Lalaing," he concluded, "I go to England to make my
      endeavour, though not quite the endeavour that was his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you a knight, then?" she asked him on a note of awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost he evaded her question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Something of a knight, I hope, God helping me. But more
      troubadour than knight, and perhaps more fool than either.
      For who shall say what is wisdom?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you hope to discover that in England?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed. "Faith, no."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, do you go there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To seek reality, to break away from shams that threaten to
      enmesh me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is reality?" she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fruit upon the tree of truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that tree so difficult to discover?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked down at her. "You speak as if you knew its
      whereabouts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think I do. I was brought up in the shade of it. I have
      lived by the mercy of God in its shelter."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her so long and intently and in such
      wistfulness that at last her glance fell in sheer
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Could you lead me to it?" he wondered, but so dreamily
      that it sounded as if he were thinking aloud and asking the
      question of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It reached the waking senses of Danvelt, who croaked
      half-coherently, still slumber-laden: "Lead you to what?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question brought Count Anthony to himself in two
      senses, and the whole truth lay in his startled
      ejaculation: "God forgive me, Master Danvelt! I had
      forgotten your existence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgotten it?" spluttered the burgher, and heaved himself
      up laughing. "Continue to forget it and you'll save me a
      thousand ducats."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony, considering him as he rolled towards them
      with his swaggering gait, opined in his soul that a million
      ducats would not be too much to pay for such a privilege.
      It was a startling thought so self-revelatory that at his
      prayers that night the Count besought an abatement of the
      stormy weather to render possible his immediate going.
      Heaven, however, was deaf to the intercession. The weather
      grew worse, and for a week the gales persisted in the
      narrow seas and kept him waiting in that perilous haven.
      More than once he spoke of setting a term to what amounted
      to an abuse of hospitality and seeking quarters at the inn.
      But Mynheer Claessens sturdily opposed him. No hospitality
      of his, he asserted, could ever be abused by one who had
      served his young friend Danvelt so nobly, which again but
      served to remind the Count of the closer kinship with
      Danvelt which was commonly desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of this desire Claessens was driven in those days to speak
      to his daughter by an event that fell upon them like a bolt
      from the blue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young burgher's letter to his father had been
      dispatched, and Claessens waited to enjoy the laugh which
      the sequel should afford. But the sequel when it came may
      have provoked the laughter of the ironic gods; it provoked
      not Claessens's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elder Danvelt read that ill-scrawled missive from his
      son, of whose endowments he had never held a high opinion.
      When he had read, he stood a moment without breathing, his
      face convulsed. Then his lips began to utter a horrible
      imprecation that was never finished. He crashed full length
      upon the floor of his counting-house in a fit of apoplexy,
      and expired that same evening. Like his son, he was too
      short in the neck for such shocks as this.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the news reached Philip Danvelt in Flushing, it sent
      him off in appalled and contrite haste to Middelburg to
      perform the last duties by a father whose days he bitterly
      blamed his own conduct for having shortened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event pointed to consequences which Mynheer Claessens
      mentioned on the morrow to his daughter. He spoke gently, a
      note of regret in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now that Philip is master of his fortune, I shall be
      losing you soon, Johanna."
    </p>
    <p>
      The roses faded slowly from her cheeks. "You mean that."
      She paused. "I don't know," she said slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You don't know?" He smiled a little wistfully. "But I
      know, and Philip knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think I want to leave you, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are aware of my need of you, and that is sweet. You
      were always sweet, Johanna. No man was ever more truly
      blessed in his child." He stroked the golden head very
      tenderly. "Your mother in Heaven will be proud of you, my
      dear, as I am." He sighed. "I shall miss you when you go.
      But I should be a selfish ingrate to detain you, when your
      own interest and happiness beckon you away."
    </p>
    <p>
      There fell a long silence, at the end of which she looked
      up, and he saw that her eyes were full of trouble. "May I
      speak frankly, father?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should not know you if you spoke otherwise."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure that my happiness lies with Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not sure?" Claessens was startled. "But you are promised
      to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was no party to the promise, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor was Philip. But he's fond of you. Old Danvelt and I
      knew what was good for both of you. Your fortunes united
      will make you very rich."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is wealth the only consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The chief consideration, as you'll come to discover. And,
      for the rest, Philip's a good fellow, good-natured, kindly.
      He'll make you a good husband, never doubt it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if I do not love him, father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love! Love comes with habit, child. Take my word for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. "I must judge for myself in this; judge
      as my heart bids me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Claessens was troubled, and went as near impatience as it
      lay in his kindly, phlegmatic nature. "But what ails
      Philip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heaven forbid that I should have a fault to find with
      him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then, all's well. A solid lad. Not perhaps of the
      grace and airs of such men as Master Egmont, but of a worth
      that seldom goes with such outward virtues."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Master Egmont's virtues are not outward only," she said,
      and flushed at her tongue's too-ready betrayal of her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned as he looked at her. "God save us! The stranger
      isn't the cause of your looking coldly upon Philip? It
      isn't that--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She made haste to interrupt him. "No, no. It is only that I
      like and respect Master Egmont. Therefore I will assume
      nothing unflattering to him. That is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It seems a deal, child, considering that we know nothing
      of this man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, something, I think. We know that he is chivalrous and
      pitiful, and we know that he commands an abundance of this
      wealth of which you make a virtue. So much is shown by the
      act that linked him to Philip. We know also that he is
      courtly, gracious and accomplished. So much our senses tell
      us."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You defend him warmly, child; more warmly than you need, I
      think. In a few days, when this weather eases, he'll go his
      ways, and we are not likely ever to see him again."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him in words, but had he looked close he
      would have discovered more pain in her eyes than he had
      ever seen there.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said no more to Johanna just then on the subject of
      Philip. A wise man this Claessens, in more than the ways of
      trade. But that evening after supper, sitting alone with
      his guest, he returned to the subject of his daughter's
      coming marriage, informing the Count that from childhood
      she had been promised to Danvelt. And Count Anthony
      perceived quite clearly the merchant's object in this
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claessens knew of his guest no more than was to be read in
      his actions and externals. From these he judged him a man
      of courts, of noble blood, of a different clay from
      himself, and he had a strong and well-justified prejudice
      against unions where such disparity existed. In addition to
      this, knowledge of the world warned him that, whilst such
      men as his guest do not marry women of the burgher class,
      they rarely hesitate to become their lovers, even when they
      are men of scrupulous honour. He judged this Master Egmont
      to be something even more. There was a fundamental
      pitifulness in his nature which would withhold him from
      doing anything to another's hurt, and there was a lofty
      dignity which would keep him aloof from banal gallantries.
      Claessens knew also that his daughter's virtue was a rock.
      So that between the two he discerned no cause for anxiety;
      and yet he prayed as fervently as Count Anthony for the
      fine weather that should permit his guest's departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      These prayers were answered at last on the morrow. The
      leaden pall of the heavens broke, the sun shone clear and
      warm, and the wind died down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Claessens was able to inform his guest that the sloop which
      had been waiting to leave port would sail on the next day.
      Count Anthony thanked Heaven, and was downcast. Thereafter
      he wandered in the garden with Johanna, a sad garden, damp
      and battered by the storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will be glad," she said, "to win release at last."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the question was in itself a probing one, it was robbed
      of any such quality by being delivered without suspicion of
      archness or challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Release?" echoed Count Anthony. "I am a boor, indeed, if I
      have conveyed any sense of impatience at the sojourn here
      imposed upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! But there is your quest."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am not sure that it has not ended already; that I have
      not found here the only reality worthy a man's seeking."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was conscious of quickened heartbeats. Instinctively,
      in maidenly self-defence, she affected to misunderstand
      where there was no room for misunderstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reality is of many kinds. Here we show you but the
      somnolent, peaceful sort."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Peaceful; not somnolent. Could any show me a better?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It depends, sir, upon what you seek; upon the inclinations
      of your nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The inclinations of my nature?" There was a rising
      inflexion in his voice. Then he fetched a sigh. "Who dares
      to follow the inclinations of his nature?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Very gently, as if she read his mind, she answered him.
      "All those, I think, who have the courage and the wisdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      It startled him to be brought thus face to face with a
      truth so simple, plain, and obvious. He looked at her where
      she stood beside him, her golden head on a line with his
      shoulder, her eyes averted, the colour ebbing and flowing
      in her cheeks. For an instant he was assailed by a fierce
      desire to take that lovely head in his hands, and to inhale
      from it the essences of her being as one inhales the
      perfume of a flower. No other man of his station would be
      so nice in his handling of this burgher's daughter. Thus a
      voice within him whispered insidiously, and at once he knew
      it for the voice of the Devil, grown overbold with him in
      this moment of his very human weakness. Who harboured a
      thought defiling to the purity and candour of this maid did
      but defile himself. If this emotion which she aroused in
      him was love--the greatest, perhaps the only, reality of
      life--then let him count the world well lost for it. Let
      him offer himself here as lover and as husband, and if she
      took him let him renounce the world to which he belonged
      and the throne that ultimately awaited him, and adopt for
      his own the humbler world of which she was a part. What was
      it she had said? To follow the inclinations of one's nature
      was for those who had the courage and the wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last, having applied the test, he broke the
      silence, it was to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am a coward and a fool, Johanna."
    </p>
    <p>
      She trembled to hear him speak her name. On his lips it
      bore a sound she had never before heard in it, acquired a
      beauty unsuspected hitherto.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what?" she asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that I lack both courage and wisdom according to your
      just conception."
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew what he meant, knew that the strength to whose
      lack he alluded was the strength to climb certain barriers
      between them, barriers of blood which already she had
      sensed. If a cold shadow fell across her soul, if a daring,
      half-formed hope withered in her maiden heart, her brave
      spirit allowed no sign of it to show upon the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he sailed for England, and her world was empty:
      empty because of the going of a man of whose existence ten
      days ago she had not been conscious. For comfort she clung
      to the hope that he would come again, a hope begotten of
      his last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I leave my horses, by your father's favour. My Schimmel is
      a gentle palfrey that would bear a child in safety. Use him
      freely until I come again, and, if I do not come again,
      retain him for your own as an earnest of the gratitude I
      bear you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Gratitude?" she echoed, who desired almost anything but
      that of him. "For what are you grateful?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To you, for more than I could tell," he said. "To God, for
      having known you, Johanna."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she stood stricken dumb by that, his lips touched
      her hand for the first and last time, in all reverence, and
      he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found herself suddenly in tears, and, eluding her
      father before he should discover it, went to seek
      consolation in prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereafter she took to riding daily as she had never ridden
      before. Mounted on the big white horse, with her father's
      servant Jan following on the bay which had belonged to
      Count Anthony's groom, she made long excursions into the
      surrounding country, and talked at long length to Schimmel
      of his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fortnight later, Philip Danvelt returned from Middelburg,
      and he was not quite the same man who had last gone
      thither. His accession to a fortune far greater than he had
      suspected had wrought a change in him. The roll of his gait
      was increased; on his short neck he carried his head still
      farther back, so that his nose seemed more aggressive even
      than heretofore; he was more ponderous of speech and of
      manner. Although in black, he was dressed with a richness
      beyond a merchant's station, and he wore his finery none
      too well. His round hat with the peaked brim carried now a
      feather brooched into the side of it by a jewel of price,
      and a jewel of price gleamed upon one of his stumpy
      fingers. He would have suffered sorely for all this in
      Mynheer Claessens's esteem had not the kindly man supposed
      that this fine plumage was assumed for the fascination of
      Johanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      He craved news of Egmont, speaking of him boldly as his
      dear friend, and he desired to know if Claessens had
      supplied him at parting with any portion of the moneys due.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He asked for none," said Claessens. "He never spoke of it.
      And when at parting I broached the subject on your behalf,
      he waved it aside as of no importance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay! ay! That's like him," said Master Philip. "He treats
      money as if it were just mud."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is how he thinks of it," said Johanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He must be either fabulously wealthy or fabulously mad,"
      said Claessens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little of both," Master Philip assured them with his
      loud, fatuous laugh, suddenly checked by Johanna. "Do you
      thank God for it, Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her championing the absent pleased Master Danvelt none too
      well. For all that he was made dull by smug complacency, he
      caught in her voice a note that was hostile to himself. It
      stirred an uneasiness in him. To allay it, he opened the
      subject of marriage that night to Claessens.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's my belief," he announced ponderously, "that a man
      should settle early."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay," said Claessens drily. "You'll have had enough of
      travel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip did not consider the interruption amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I need a wife, and I've a line house up there in
      Middelburg awaiting a mistress. If you're willing, then,
      good Master Claessens ..." He spread his hands, deeming it
      unnecessary to complete the sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Master Claessens felt that he was being used with
      patronage, and was between amusement and resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's not my willingness you must ascertain; but
      Johanna's," was his answer, calculated to give pause to the
      young man. It had, however, no such effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip laughed shortly, a very self-assured master of his
      fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that!" Airily he dismissed the possibility of
      Johanna's having any but one opinion in the matter. "I'll
      speak to Johanna in the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      The affair thus comfortably dismissed, he passed to other
      things: the state of trade in Middelburg; the fortune
      inherited from his father; the opportunities for increasing
      it which his father had neglected; and the gerency of it
      which he intended. So that when at last, full of beer and
      self-sufficiency, Master Philip retired to bed, it occurred
      to Claessens that perhaps Johanna was right in her lack of
      eagerness for these nuptials planned so long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning when Philip came late to breakfast, Johanna
      was away, scouring the country on Count Anthony's big white
      palfrey. It astounded Philip that she should do it, and
      still more that her father should permit it. He said so,
      and enlarged upon his views of a woman's functions in life.
      This sort of thing might be well enough for idle wantons of
      the Court, but was hardly seemly in a sober burgher woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Receiving but indifferent sympathy from the father, Master
      Danvelt addressed the daughter in the matter later in the
      day. She listened meekly, struggling generously against the
      conviction that he was stupid, pompous, and uncouth, and
      never so ridiculous as when he regarded his own opinions as
      unalterable laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what harm do I do, Philip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was impatient that she should require the obvious to be
      constantly explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No great harm, perhaps. But it's unbecoming in a maid of
      your station."
    </p>
    <p>
      She considered that Master Egmont had not deemed it
      unbecoming, else he would not have left her the palfrey;
      and in matters of taste she must account him a sounder
      arbiter than Master Philip. At last she said slowly: "That
      is a question for my father, Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And for your husband," he snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I have one, perhaps."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For your future husband, meanwhile."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can I say what my future husband will approve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am telling you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you can speak only for yourself, Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am speaking for myself. Am I not to marry you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is very condescending, Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      Missing the irony, he was a little mollified.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I admonish you for your own good--out of my affection for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am grateful. But am I worthy?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered this, and evaded a reply that might go to her
      head. He liked a woman to be humble.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My affairs in Middelburg, now that my father has gone and
      all the burden is on my shoulders, make it difficult for me
      to come and go. We must cut short our courtship, Johanna.
      We might be married, I think, before the end of the month."
    </p>
    <p>
      She went white. She sat with hands folded in her lap, her
      downcast eyes considering them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is impossible, Philip," she quietly answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How soon, then?" he demanded, and never was lover more
      peremptory.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath before replying. "Philip, my dear,
      it should be easy for you to find in Middelburg a wife
      better suited to you than I am."
    </p>
    <p>
      This made him impatient. Humility in women is well enough.
      This, however, was pushing things too far.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I love you, Johanna!" he exclaimed in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was wondering if you did. I hoped that you did not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hoped that I did not? When you are to marry me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose now and confronted him frankly, calm, save for a
      gleam of distress in those clear eyes. "Philip, dear, I
      have a friendship for you, even affection. But it is not
      the kind of affection that should exist between husband and
      wife, if they are to be happy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? What do you know of such things?" He was aghast.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Knowledge has come to me," she said wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whence?" he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      She paused a moment before replying. "From myself, of
      course. Whence else should such knowledge come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed through his perturbation. "But all that will
      follow. It always does. Trust me, Johanna. I understand
      these things: life and the rest. I love you, Johanna," he
      said again, and now at last became a lover in earnest and
      began humbly and with some warmth to woo that which
      unopposed he would phlegmatically have appropriated.
    </p>
    <p>
      It moved her, distressed her, shook her resolve a little,
      but did not suffice to beat it down. When she had made this
      clear, he collapsed in dismayed amazement. "Then all that
      our parents planned is to come to naught!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Gently she stroked his yellow head, as he sat hunched in
      his chair. "I am sorry, Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      So pitiful was her nature and so touched was she by his
      manifest distress that, out of charity, to allay it, had he
      pressed the matter then, she might have yielded. As it was,
      she found it in her heart to wish that Master Egmont had
      never crossed her path to reveal her to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dejected Philip bore his lament to her father. Gravely
      Claessens heard him, and thought in his heart that what had
      happened was very good for Philip's soul and might yet
      shape him into such a man as Johanna should ultimately be
      content to marry.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've ruffled her, my lad. That's all," Claessens
      comforted him. "You are too downright and blunt. Women need
      to be coaxed." Philip snorted impatiently. "Oh! A good
      woman's worth coaxing. Take my word for it. I am twice your
      age. And a maid will often say no to a man at first, and be
      glad enough to say yes in the end. Johanna is not a girl to
      be constrained, nor am I the man to constrain her. But I'll
      advise her--cautiously. I desire to see you joined, and
      she'll have you in the end. But give her time, and play the
      lover; pay court to her. Could you be romantic, Philip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that?" said Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't know. 'But Johanna might school you."
    </p>
    <p>
      His dejection mitigated by such hope as he could gather
      from what her father had said, Philip went back to
      Middelburg whence came gifts for Johanna, to herald his
      return a fortnight later. He stayed two days, was discreet,
      and beyond a tender attentiveness made no advance in the
      wooing upon which he was now determined.

    <h1>
      FRIAR STEPHEN
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first days of June, Master Danvelt received from his
      prospective father-in-law, a letter in the following terms:
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <i>Dear Philip,</i><br>
      <br>
      Master Egmont has just returned from England, and is lodged
      here at the Zeelanderhof. If we looked to see him ever
      again, at least we did not look to see him so soon, and I
      must suppose the cause of this early return to be that he
      did not find England to his taste, although I perceive that
      other reasons may exist. However that may be, his presence
      affords you the opportunity you desire to discharge your
      debt to him, and I advise you to take instant advantage of
      it, in the assurance that our welcome awaits you.
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
      There was a good deal to be read between the lines of that
      letter. Claessens stressed the fact that Master Egmont's
      return so soon had not been expected, hinted that the
      reason for it was to be sought elsewhere than in the
      vaguely apparent reasons he mentioned, and almost succeeded
      in suggesting that the gentleman's presence was not
      welcome. His urging the immediate discharge of the debt
      might be suspected to be founded on the fact that once the
      debt were discharged this guest would have no pretext for
      lingering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Claessens certainly intended to convey all this and
      more to Philip; but because at once kindly and shrewd, he
      could not bring himself to use more precise expressions or
      to disclose the source of his disquietude. This had begun
      in the very moment of Master Egmont's arrival. The burgher
      and his daughter had just dined and they were still at
      table, when through the open window they heard his voice in
      the courtyard, addressing first the stork, by its name of
      Peter, and then Jan who had opened to him. At the sound of
      that voice, Johanna's breathing had stood suddenly
      arrested, her face had gone white, and her hand had fled
      instinctively to repress the tumult of her breast. Then,
      the shock being spent, the colour came flooding back to her
      cheeks; she sprang up with parted lips and a joyous sparkle
      in eyes which of late had been so sad and pensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her watchful father observed these signs. Already in
      Flanders was a proverb current which much later was thus
      rendered into French: <i>Amour qui rougit, fleurette; amour
      qui palît, drame du coeur.</i> It occurred to Claessens in
      that moment; and his heart grew heavy with anxiety for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless his welcome of the traveller was cordial.
      Master Egmont was bidden to table, and Jan and Gabriel
      ordered to supply his wants as generously as larder and
      cellar would permit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pale and a little careworn; but his dark eyes glowed
      as they met Johanna's; his lips laughed readily, and soon
      there was a return of that radiance that men remarked in
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had landed, he informed them, an hour ago, and he was
      lodged at the Zeelanderhof, in the market place. Father and
      daughter protested against this in different keys. But the
      Count was firm. Enough already had he burdened their
      hospitality. He remained, however, all day with them,
      entertaining them with descriptions of England and English
      life, which, after all, was none so different from their
      own.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Johanna came to supper in a gown of sapphire
      blue, with some simple jewels in her hair and breast, and
      seemed to her father a being transfigured. Both he and
      their guest had heard her singing whilst she attired
      herself with more than usual care, and there was in this
      singing a message for each of them. Claessens was reminded
      by it that he had not heard her voice in song since Master
      Egmont had left them six weeks before, whilst Count Anthony
      was startled to hear from her lips the little song he had
      made and sung to her last April. It thrilled him that she
      should have borne it in her memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      There chanced to be a second guest at Master Claessens
      table that night: a Franciscan brother, one of those
      itinerant friars who wandered through the land supplying
      the place to be taken in later ages by the news-sheet.
      Rarely did one of these brethren pass through Flushing
      without seeking bed and board in the hospitable house of
      Claessens and in exchange for these comforts retailing to
      the merchant and his household the current events in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-night this little brother of Saint Francis had a greater
      than usual store of gossip for them. Seated there in his
      coarse grey habit, the cowl of which was thrown back, so
      that his tonsure, freshly shaven, gleamed within its
      circlet of greying hair, his twinkling eyes beamed upon the
      little company from his benign and rubicund countenance. A
      man of fifty, perhaps, this Brother Stephen, vigorous and
      still youthful; a man who enjoyed good fare and yet knew
      how to live hard at need, thanking God for whatever came.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was last from Bruges, he told them, where the Duke had
      now established his Court; and he began by speaking of the
      great preparations there for the Duke's wedding to the
      sister of the King of England, shortly to be celebrated.
      Very subtly then, by terms in which it would have been
      difficult afterwards to have incriminated him, he created
      the impression that this was a union that bodied ill for
      the land. An alliance with England, such as this marriage
      consolidated, could not be other than an alliance against
      France, an alliance aiming at the furtherance of the Duke
      of Burgundy's insatiable ambition. This implied war, and,
      if the Duke made war with Burgundian lances, he made it
      none the less with Flemish gold. It would mean a crushing
      burden of taxation upon the Netherlands already burdened to
      excess, and this at a time when their normal trade would be
      dislocated and their normal prosperity stemmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listening to him, Count Anthony recognised him for a
      Frenchman by his accent, and suddenly asked himself was he
      one of the agents of the crafty King of France sent thus to
      sow alarm and discontent through the Duke's dominions, and
      foment among these subject people the spirit of revolt?
    </p>
    <p>
      Returning, however, to the preparations for the wedding,
      Friar Stephen told them how the looms were being driven at
      high speed in the manufacture of tapestries and other
      fabrics, how painters and artificers of every kind were
      hard at work upon decorations and embellishments that
      should be worthy of Burgundian splendour and Burgundian
      opulence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke of the bride. Rumour ran that this Englishwoman,
      favouring her royal brother, was very beautiful, and he
      told of jewellers and goldsmiths hard at work upon
      confections becomingly to deck this royal beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next he related how the vast tennis court at Bruges was
      being fashioned into a banqueting-hall, and the great
      square into a tilt yard. He spoke of mummers and minstrels
      who were pouring into the city of Bruges from every quarter
      of Europe; of the great displays that were to be made by
      the foreign trading corporations, especially the Venetians
      and the Genoese; and of the expected concourse of renowned
      knights from every quarter of Christendy, who were to
      display their prowess in the jousts to be held in honour of
      the event, foremost amongst whom, Brother Stephen knew,
      would be that famous champion Anthony of Burgundy, the
      Great Bastard.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke fluently in well-chosen words that painted vivid
      pictures, yet so craftily that when most he seemed to
      admire and laud the Duke of Burgundy, the more effectively
      did he damn him in Flemish eyes. For the ultimate
      impression he created was one of a monstrous prodigality,
      of a reckless scattering of gold exacted for these empty
      splendours from those who had earned it by the sweat of
      their brows, the skill of their hands, and the laborious
      cunning of their invention.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, because it served his purpose--which to one
      listener at least grew plainer with every word he
      uttered--he passed abruptly from Anthony of Burgundy to
      another Anthony no less famous at the Burgundian Court:
      Count Anthony of Guelders. He spoke of him with a sudden
      overclouding of his benign countenance. That, he announced,
      was a knight of a very different order from his Burgundian
      namesake; a prince of sweet and gentle ways, ever the
      friend and champion of the afflicted; scholar and poet,
      soldier and statesman; there was a man of parts, gracious
      and graceful of person, beloved of all, yet of none so
      beloved as of the Duke's highness, who, stern, grim, and
      unyielding as he was to all the world, could be melted and
      even led by Count Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what's here to sadden you?" wondered Claessens,
      alluding to the lugubrious tone in which the friar extolled
      the virtues of this prince of the House of Guelders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas!" sighed Brother Stephen. "He is gone, the one good
      influence in that prodigal court; gone no man knows
      whither; vanished in a night. He quitted the Court when it
      was at Brussels, close upon a year ago. There have been
      rumours of him, here and there, but the Duke has failed to
      trace him, and it is thought that he has gone abroad. It is
      most sad. The Duke, they say, is more morose and sullen
      than ever as a result of the affair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why did he go?" inquired Johanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, that!" The friar raised his eyes and fetched a sigh.
      "His highness would have had him marry where he did not
      love. He was formally betrothed to the Duke's
      sister-in-law, the Lady Catharine of Bourbon, a very sweet
      lady; indeed, they say the most beautiful lady at the
      Court. Yet for all her beauty my Lord Anthony would have
      none of her. He was very difficult, very exacting and
      fastidious where ladies are concerned, and, though many
      there are who were known to sigh for him, it is boldly
      asserted that he was never known to sigh for any. He is of
      an austerity such as finds no place in courts. The ribald
      make jests of it--unseemly jests--and suggest for him the
      cloister. The Duke would have forced him into this
      marriage. To avoid it and because sickened in other
      ways--as so austere a man might well be--of courtly life,
      he disappeared."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that says more for him than all your eulogies, good
      brother," Johanna commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My eulogies had not been spoken else," the friar agreed.
      "Another in his place would have married the Lady
      Catharine, and loved when and where he pleased. But Count
      Anthony has sworn, they say, to marry only where he loves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is surely the only marriage in the sight of God,"
      said Johanna. "It is love that sanctifies marriage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay; sanctification is the work of Holy Mother
      Church, my child."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can Holy Church sanctify a thing so unholy in itself as a
      loveless union?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The friar, no stronger in theology than most minorities,
      evaded the awkward question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where the Church bestows her blessing all things are
      possible!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then Claessens, well knowing what passed in his
      daughter's mind, attempted to divert the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But his flight hardly savours of high courage, such as one
      would look for in the man you have described."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony, who hitherto had sat a silent listener in
      the background and a little in shadow, laughed softly.
      Claessens turned to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You laugh, sir! Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because, good Master Claessens, you do not know Duke
      Charles of Burgundy, his indomitable will and his
      remorseless powers of persuasion, strengthened by the
      growing belief that he is divinely inspired."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak with feeling almost, Master Egmont," said the
      burgher.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh! Based on common knowledge," was the Count's disarming
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it did not disarm the friar. "Egmont!" he had echoed,
      when that name was pronounced, and had continued to stare
      at the elegant figure sitting just beyond the edge of the
      light. To one who plied his Mercury vocation, this was not
      a name to pass unquestioned. His perceptions were quickened
      by it, and almost at a glance he identified that tawny head
      and lofty brow, those glowing eyes and that sensitive
      mouth, with the descriptions he had heard of the missing
      prince of the House of Guelders. His jaw fell; his eyes
      dilated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony, realising that he was discovered, spoke
      quickly, before the friar could sufficiently recover from
      his amazement to utter a single word. He, too, could be
      subtle, as he now showed this subtle friar.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All things considered, it is little wonder that the
      disappearance of the Count has been made possible. Who that
      knew his whereabouts would ever betray him? It were even
      more wantonly cruel than, for instance, to betray certain
      indiscretions into which, speaking here in all confidence,
      you have been lured to-night."
    </p>
    <p>
      The friar's jaws came sharply together again. He understood
      perfectly. What Count Anthony was really saying to him was:
      "You keep my secret, and I'll keep yours." It was not a
      matter in which he had any choice. The thought of what
      might happen to him, if he refused this proffered bargain,
      turned him cold with apprehension. It put an end to his
      newsmongering for that night, and soon thereafter he begged
      leave to seek his bed. But the question stirring
      tumultuously in his brain was: "What does Count Anthony of
      Guelders with masked identity seek in this burgher
      household?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing his world and its wickedness, he could find but one
      answer; and it appalled him. Was it possible that, under a
      cloak of virtue, almost of saintliness, which had earned
      him the sobriquet of "Anthony the Chaste," this elegant,
      accomplished prince was a libertine and a seducer? Since
      honest love, aiming at wedlock, was inconceivable between
      this Prince of Guelders and a burgher's daughter, what else
      was to be concluded?
    </p>
    <p>
      Friar Stephen was oppressed. The habit he wore, and to
      which he was faithful in spite of certain political
      undertakings, imposed upon him here a clear duty. Yet the
      conviction that, if he now betrayed Count Anthony's
      identity, Count Anthony would inevitably betray his
      activities, and thus deliver him to the cord, set upon that
      duty an iron curb.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bethought him of the Latin tag, <i>In medio tutissimus
      ibi,</i> and sought the middle course.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jan had lighted him to his chamber, and Johanna had
      accompanied him thither, doing the honours of her father's
      house, he detained her a moment, waving Jan away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This Messire Egmont, child? Have you known him long?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Briefly she told him the extent of their acquaintance and
      whence it was sprung.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What brings him back here?" he asked, holding the candle
      so that the light fell upon her face. He saw the crimson
      flush that overspread it, and deemed his worst fears
      verified.
    </p>
    <p>
      She faltered a little in her reply. "There are certain
      moneys due to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is that all?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else do you suspect, good brother?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He set a hand upon her shoulder. His eyes were kindly,
      pitiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I bid you beware, child. Beware of him and of yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beware of him? Of him?" She smiled her scorn of the
      warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is a man of courts, of noble blood. He bears it written
      plainly upon him. He may be virtuous. I do not know. I do
      not say that he is not. God forbid that I should judge a
      man without full grounds. But there is little virtue in the
      world to which he belongs, especially in dealing with those
      of the world which is yours, my child. God and the Virgin
      Mother keep you spotless."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was crimson again, but not now in confusion, and her
      clear, frank eyes were almost hard for once. Without
      raising her voice, she gave an edge to her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such is my nightly prayer," she informed him. "Do you pray
      God and the Virgin Mother to give you purity of mind and to
      save you from the sin of thinking evil."
    </p>
    <p>
      On that she departed, leaving the good man uplifted by her
      rebuke. Clearly no harm had come to her yet. He was in
      time. But in time for what? Seeking the answer to this
      question, Brother Stephen fell asleep. He was seeking it
      still when he awakened next morning, and found it during
      the brief business of donning his Franciscan garments. He
      might be risking his neck, but he thought not, for he was
      subtle and had devised a subtlety; and in any case he was
      strengthened by the Godly assurance that he risked his neck
      in a good cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards noon of that same day, at about the same time that
      Master Claessens's letter was being delivered to Philip
      Danvelt, Brother Stephen came, dusty and famished, into the
      grey courtyard of the Gravenhof of Middelburg, the seat of
      the Ducal Governor of Zealand, and craved audience of that
      august personage.

    </h1>
    <h1>
      THE INTERRUPTION
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      A man chooses the instruments of his will according to his
      nature. Duke Charles of Burgundy, being a stern,
      uncompromising man of the sword, chose stern,
      uncompromising soldiers for his representatives and of
      these--saving perhaps the Alsatian, von Hagenbach, whose
      ruthlessness ultimately helped to encompass the Duke's
      ruin--none was more stern and uncompromising than the Sire
      Claude de Rhynsault, the Lorrainer who ruled as the Duke's
      Governor in Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      He owed the appointment to his conduct at Montlhéry, where,
      by luck or skill, he had contrived a movement with the
      lances under his command which at a critical moment of the
      day turned the fortunes of the battle in the Duke's favour.
      He had, too, an ingratiating manner with his superiors, and
      it is not to be denied that he had given proofs of
      organising ability. So the Duke had sent him to Zealand
      until such time as he should have need of him in the field
      again; and in Zealand the Sire de Rhynsault had justified
      his appointment. He had shown himself an able
      administrator; he maintained an iron grip upon the
      province, crushing the first sparks of sedition so quickly
      that no sedition was heard of in his government, and
      squeezing the taxes so promptly and abundantly out of the
      Zealanders that the Duke had come to hold him up as a
      pattern to the governors of his other provinces. For the
      rest, he was easy of access, of a certain gross superficial
      affability, and so insatiable an animal where women were
      concerned that no burgher owning a handsome wife or
      daughter could ever be entirely at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the man sought by Brother Stephen as the
      instrument for the preservation of a maiden's virtue.
      Fortunately, Rhynsault was not to know more than half of
      what was required of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The friar was ushered across a bare stone hall, where
      men-at-arms lounged in attendance, into a little
      tapestry-hung closet, lighted by a single narrow window
      above the courtyard. Here at a table, in a high carved
      Gothic chair, sat the dread Governor of Zealand, a big man,
      still young, with a red vulpine face and blue-black jowl,
      the livid streak of a scar athwart his fleshy nose.
      Disliking clerics, he scowled now upon his visitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, friar! What news is this you boast will make you
      welcome?"
    </p>
    <p>
      On a faldstool at the table's end, nursing one leg across
      the thigh of the other, sat the Governor's Fool, a wisp of
      a man with a humped back, in a parti-coloured suit of black
      and purple; each point of the chaperon carried a tiny
      silver bell and its hood was crested by a cock's comb. His
      long, pallid sallow face, was of the delicate and elfin
      kind so often seen upon such misshapen men, but out of his
      little close-set eyes, bright and glittering as a rat's,
      more evil looked upon the world than Brother Stephen had
      ever seen in human countenance. The friar shuddered as he
      met the probing stab of those beady eyes. Then he shifted
      his glance to the Governor and made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your excellency will have heard of the disappearance of
      Count Anthony of Guelders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the blood of the Pope!" croaked the Governor, "are you
      come here to ask foolish questions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Brother Stephen was not ruffled. "That is your excellency's
      way of answering in the affirmative. Count Anthony was last
      seen, as the Sire de Vauclerc reported to the Duke's
      highness, at Ghent in March last, when he went to the
      assistance of a burgher who had ventured to speak amiss of
      the Duke. He left Ghent in the company of that burgher, and
      has not since been heard of."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well? What then?" The Governor was contemptuous of all
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Duke, who has had diligent search made for the
      Count--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay, I am aware of that. I have certain orders in the
      matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "--would account himself well served by any who should send
      the Count back to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, when will you cease to tell me what I know?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A little patience, excellency. You may not know that the
      burgher whom he befriended is a merchant of this city of
      Middelburg, one Philip Danvelt, at the moment to be found
      here?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That moved the Governor. "Danvelt!" he cried. "That greasy
      moneybags?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, God be praised, I have given your excellency news at
      last! May I presume to add a word of advice?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you wanting in respect, sniveller?" The Lorrainer
      scowled at him, annoyed by his faint note of irony.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The friar was not dismayed. "It is that you question
      Danvelt as to what became of his companion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God's light! I'll question him: ay, and wring an answer
      from him if I have to put a length of whipcord round his
      temples."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even at this late date he may be able to set you on the
      track of him; and so, to your increasing honour and profit,
      you may do good service to the Duke's highness, whom God
      preserve. Have I your excellency's leave to go?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're mighty abrupt, Master Franciscan!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I would not unnecessarily waste your excellency's time now
      that I've said all that I came to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay, go your ways," the Governor dismissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Pax vobiscum,"</i> said the friar, drawing his cowl
      over his head, and turning to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Domine non sum dignus,"</i> croaked the Fool, to mock
      him, and Brother Stephen, shuddering at the sound of that
      voice as he had shuddered under the glance of the Fool's
      eye, withdrew in haste, yet knowing his work well done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a half-hour an officer from the Governor waited upon
      Master Danvelt with a summons from his excellency. Master
      Danvelt truculently announced that he was about to set out
      upon a journey, and required to know what the Governor
      desired of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His excellency will tell you," said the officer, "and the
      more pleasantly, the less you keep him waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      Resentful, and grumbling to support his importance, Danvelt
      went.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am reminded," the Governor greeted him, "that in Ghent
      last April you were in trouble for sedition-mongering."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that," said Master Philip. He excused himself without
      humility, indeed with a certain retention of his erstwhile
      truculence. "In my cups I was incautious, and uttered some
      follies, as men will in their cups. I have paid for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you've paid, have you, sirrah merchant? Now give heed
      to me or you may have to pay again. There was a gentleman
      advanced you the sum you needed for your fine. You'll
      remember that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember. Yes." He was merely sullen now.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you recall his name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course. It was Egmont. Anthony Egmont."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impudent buffoon! Is that a way for such as you to speak
      of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How else should I speak of him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How else? Don't you know who he is?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if he is anything more than Anthony Egmont. That is
      all I know of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you know where he is at present?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes: at Flushing, at the Zeelanderhof."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oho!" cried Rhynsault, and "So! So!" with a raising of
      brows and a widening of eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt was dismissed with scant courtesy and in deep
      resentment of the cavalier treatment received, also in some
      uneasiness. Returning home, he ordered horses to be
      saddled, and, accompanied by a groom, set out for Flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it happened that Count Anthony and Mistress Johanna
      were riding by the same road, returning from a little
      excursion along the dykes. Followed at a respectful
      distance by Jan and the Count's groom, François, they rode
      with the sparkling sea on their right, whence came a cool
      breeze to temper the warmth of the June sunshine, and the
      dunes on their left, with here and there the trees and
      fields of an occasional polder, like a green oasis in that
      sandy, silt-born land.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johanna in a trailing habit of green, her eyes a-sparkle,
      her cheeks delicately flushed, with golden tendrils
      escaping from the band of her horned headdress., was
      mounted upon Schimmel by the Count's insistence, whilst the
      Count himself was astride the bay that hitherto had served
      his groom. The servants followed on hackneys from Mynheer
      Claessens' stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been little talk between them, and that little
      was confined to trivial matters. Then a long silence fell,
      which Johanna made no attempt to break, happy to be so
      entirely alone with him. His own happiness was clouded by
      indecision. Silently he rode, balancing still between the
      natural inclinations which had brought him back to her so
      soon, almost despite himself, and the preoccupations of his
      class, his duty, as he conceived it, to the station into
      which he had been born. To a man less scrupulous the
      solution would have been easy. But for Count Anthony the
      only choice lay between all and nothing. Either he would
      make her his wife and face the consequences, which might
      include his being struck out of the succession to the
      throne of Guelders, or else he would depart again in
      silence, and this time never to come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the intolerable quality of the second alternative
      that drove him still undecided towards the first. Still
      undecided, he broke at last the silence, hoping to be
      drifted to a decision by the very turn their speech should
      take.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew--did you not--that I should return?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hoped it," she added softly, and only when the words
      were spoken did she realise, in alarm, their too candid
      import, and seek to explain them away. "You see, there was
      a debt to be repaid you, and there was Schimmel here to be
      restored."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Count Anthony was not to be misled. His heart had
      leaped at the full admission of that soft "I hoped it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The debt was naught, and Schimmel my gift to you. You know
      that it was for neither of these things I came."
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer. Her eyes were hidden behind veiling
      lids. Her bosom betrayed a quickened breathing that was not
      from riding. Indeed, for some time now their horses had
      fallen to a walking pace. Count Anthony leaned across and
      placed his gloved right hand on hers, where it rested on
      the peak of the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was you, Johanna, who compelled my return, shortening
      my sojourn overseas, filling me with a nostalgy that grew
      unbearable. You know it, child."
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head. "How could I have such knowledge?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? It is the kind of knowledge that is imparted without
      words, in the silent language in which soul talks to soul."
      He pointed south-westwards across the sea. "Out there I
      heard your call. From out there you heard the voice of my
      deep yearning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, no! Not that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes! Just that. But you would not heed it. You fancied
      it a voice within yourself. You did not know, you would not
      guess, that time and space do not exist for two souls that
      are in tune each with the other. And it is my faith that it
      was always so. Do you recall, Johanna, our first meeting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I recall it?" Her tone announced the impossibility of
      forgetting it. "I see you now, so clearly, in the courtyard
      of my father's house. You were all in black, with lynx fur
      at the hem and neck and wrists of your tunic, that girdle
      of hammered gold about your wrist. You looked at me--" In
      sudden shyness she broke off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did he, lover-like, implore her to continue. He shook
      his head; and, although his lips were smiling, his eyes
      were wistful. "Was that, then, really our first meeting?
      Did no memory stir in you of something remote, half-lost in
      the mists of time?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned her head to look at him between tenderness and
      mystification.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. "You'll count me mad, then, if I endeavour to
      explain. Such things are to be experienced, not related.
      That first glimpse of you--a vision, it seemed, and all my
      consciousness was gathered in my eyes, absorbed in them
      from my other senses--that first glimpse stirred such a
      memory in me. I could not track it down. A memory, it
      eluded memory; it seemed to lie outside memory; and yet it
      bore to me, I thought, the knowledge that you and I were
      one link in some eternal chain; that each of us was a part
      of the other, mates predestined by a predestination that is
      but rarely fulfilled because of other blind, blundering
      forces that go to shape our lives. If you believe me, you
      will understand now what it was that moved me to succour
      Philip Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Philip!" she echoed, suddenly awake from the dream his
      words were spinning, and suddenly chilled as if a shadow
      had fallen upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he ran on, expounding his romantic view of Fate's way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Philip Danvelt himself was naught; just a source of the
      impulse upon which I was to act, a rung of the ladder by
      which I was to climb, a sign-post planted by Fate to point
      me along the road to heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased and there was silence, for she could make him no
      answer, knew not what answer to make him. His words were
      romantically, poetically vague; but it emerged from them
      clearly that he was wooing her, and, whilst her soul
      trembled in ecstasy, it trembled too, in an indefinable
      fear, a fear aroused by the mention of Philip, the thought
      of Philip, and the sudden recollection, thrusting itself
      unbidden upon her mind, of the words with which Friar
      Sebastian had last night aroused her indignation. A point
      was reached at which the friar's warning was to be
      submitted to the test. Already her companion had said more
      than she should suffer from him unless there was something
      still to come in justification of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not for her, her instincts told her, either to
      encourage or discourage him. Hers now the passive part
      until he should fully have revealed himself and the true
      quality of this love he offered. It was not that she
      mistrusted him, or could really believe what the friar had
      hinted. But she desired that of his own free will and
      without assistance he should so express himself that no
      mistrust hereafter could be possible, or doubt admissible
      to poison the happiness towards which she looked with timid
      confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Waiting, then, she practised stern repression; nor dared to
      look at him, but kept her eyes on the red towers and
      massive ramparts of the town of Flushing which they were
      fast approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she became conscious, as did he, of rapidly
      overtaking hoofbeats behind them. A moment later came a
      hail, and then two horsemen swept alongside, and the first
      of these doffed his bonnet and revealed himself for Master
      Danvelt, never more inopportune to her than in this moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If resentment to find Johanna again transgressing what he
      considered proper in a woman of her station was at all
      responsible for the cloud upon his brow, it found at the
      moment no expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save you, Master Egmont," was his greeting,
      breathlessly delivered. "I have ridden hard to warn you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To warn me?" The Count drew rein, as did the others now,
      and they stood, the servants a little in the background,
      whilst Philip made a full announcement of his morning's
      interview with the Governor of Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony laughed when the tale was told. "Why, what
      have I to do with the Governor of Zealand?" he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you should know, sir. Whatever it may be, and lest it
      should bode you ill, my duty was to warn you at once in
      view of what lies between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laughter was dismissed from his lordship's countenance.
      "That, sir, was very worthy, very noble in you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was no less than I owed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed, a great deal more. You cannot be blind to the risk
      to yourself had your full suspicions been well founded. If,
      for instance, the apprehension of my person were intended,
      and you frustrate it by this warning and so permit me to
      escape, you cannot be in doubt that you would be called
      upon to answer, and to answer grievously."
    </p>
    <p>
      With Johanna's startled gaze upon him, Danvelt made an
      answer which suddenly transfigured him in her eyes,
      endowing him with a nobility hitherto unsuspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, I am well aware of that. But if my life should pay
      for it, it is no more than the life I owe to you. Moreover,
      it is through me and the service that you did me that you
      are tracked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My friend," said Count Anthony, "your action more than
      justifies mine in having served you." Then he smiled again.
      "For the rest, you need have no fear either for me or for
      yourself. I am no fugitive from justice. There will be
      messages for me. That is all."
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt breathed freely again. He was well pleased. He had
      worn the halo of heroism without any of its inconveniences.
      And from Johanna, too, there came a gasp of relief and a
      return of the colour which momentarily terror had driven
      from her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Together now they rode into the town, and parted in the
      market place, Count Anthony and his servant going to the
      Zeelanderhof, whilst Johanna returned home accompanied by
      Danvelt and followed by Jan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count sat his horse at the inn door, and watched them
      out of sight. As they were about to turn the corner, they
      looked back, first Johanna, then Danvelt. They waved to
      him, and he doffed his bonnet in reply, little dreaming of
      the vastly different circumstances in which next her eyes
      should discover him. Then he fetched a deep sigh, and
      walked his horse into the inn yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into that same inn yard less than an hour later, clanked a
      company of six men-at-arms, from the heads of whose lances
      fluttered purple bannerols bearing the cross of Saint
      Andrew. They were led by an officer wearing a white surcoat
      over his mail, and a little scarlet plume in his steel cap.
      Dismounting, he inquired of the landlord for a gentleman
      calling himself Anthony Egmont.
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord, relieved that the business of these
      Burgundians was not with himself, promptly conducted the
      officer above-stairs, to the room where Count Anthony sat
      alone with his perplexities.
    </p>
    <p>
      So overmastering had been his feelings for Johanna, so
      passionate his yearnings for her, that hitherto, as he now
      perceived, he had yielded to them blindly and in utter
      disregard to every consideration. Relentlessly they had
      brought him back from England no sooner was he arrived
      there, and remorselessly had they closed his senses to all
      perception of the circumstances in which both of them were
      placed. It had remained for an act of generosity on the
      part of Danvelt to check him in his reckless course and bid
      him consider whither he was heading, bring him to ponder
      certain contingencies of expediency and of honour. At the
      risk, perhaps, of his own life, Danvelt had ridden to warn
      the man who would have stolen Johanna from her
      burgher-lover. That was how the Count now regarded himself.
      If hitherto he had discounted without qualms any such
      aspect of his conduct, it was because Danvelt had appeared
      to him contemptible and beneath consideration. In this, it
      was now clear to him that he had been guilty of
      misjudgment. Then, too, it became necessary to ask himself
      to what end did he propose to snatch Johanna from another.
      Was he, a Prince of Guelders, prepared to make this
      burgher's daughter his Princess? Even if he were, would
      such a thing be permitted him? And alternatively was he
      prepared to marry her at the price of renouncing his rights
      to the throne of Guelders? Did the clear duty imposed upon
      him by his birth even permit him to do so much?
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the questions he was again balancing in his mind
      to perplex and distract him. Answers he had not found to
      any when the Governor's officer was admitted to his
      presence, unless it was a half-answer supplied by his
      romantic fatalism, that Danvelt's supervention at the very
      moment when he was about to give his love for Johanna full
      expression was in itself a sign.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tormented and despairing, torn between his love for Johanna
      and his duty to himself, and to her, and even to Danvelt,
      he almost welcomed the interruption of his distracting
      thoughts which the officer's advent afforded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By your good leave, my lord, I have orders concerning
      you." Thus the officer, his manner a careful blend of
      deference and firmness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Concerning me? They are--?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are to ride with me at once, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I ride with you? Who are you, sirrah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fritz von Diesenhofen, lieutenant to the Governor of
      Zealand, to serve you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You seem to know me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then what have I to do with your Governor of Zealand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They will tell you that at Bruges, my lord, whither you
      are to ride with me. Those are my orders. I am to deliver
      you, together with a letter from the Governor, into the
      hands of the Duke's highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You perceive, I trust, that you are being a party to an
      act of violence which may have grave consequences. I am no
      subject of the Duke of Burgundy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe not. You must argue it with others. I am a soldier,
      not a lawyer, my lord. I have my orders."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony rose. "So be it," he said. "Give me leave to
      write a letter, and I shall be at your disposal."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Diesenhofen shook his head. "Your letter must wait, my
      lord, until I have made safe delivery of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony frowned. "I am a prisoner, then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may call it that. Besides, we must set out at once if
      we are to cross the water before dusk."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus abruptly ended Count Anthony's second visit to
      Flushing. He departed with Diesenhofen and the six lances,
      his servant going with him, and, whilst his departure was
      widely observed, reported, and a source of comment in the
      town, none supposed him a prisoner, seeing him ride beside
      the officer unpinioned and sword on thigh.

    <h1>
      THE RETURN
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruges, which Diesenhofen regarded as their destination,
      was to prove no more than the first stage of a journey that
      was to continue for close upon three weeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke, who had come thither a fortnight earlier, and who
      had held there his first chapter of the Golden Fleece, had
      departed suddenly that very day to return to Brussels.
    </p>
    <p>
      When in pursuit of him they reached Brussels on the evening
      of the morrow, it was only to discover that he had done no
      more than spend some few hours in the city, and that he was
      gone on to Namur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place was full of rumours. It was being said that the
      King of France was arming for the recapture of the cities
      of the Somme, and that the Duke was taking order to resist
      this violation of the Treaty of Conflans.
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed for Count Anthony days of tedious riding, now
      south, now east, now west, in the erratic wake of the
      swiftly moving Duke. If the Count was wearied by this and
      fretted by the necessity for submission to the automaton
      who held him captive, if inwardly he rebelled against the
      unlawful compulsion of which he was the victim, he realised
      the futility of remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each night Diesenhofen locked him in an inn bedroom with a
      guard outside his door and another beneath his window; and
      each night of the first week Count Anthony wrote a letter
      to Johanna, which next morning he destroyed. Such was the
      bewildered state of his mind where she was concerned, such
      the persisting and inconclusive conflict between his love
      on the one hand and what on the other he accounted his duty
      to himself and to Danvelt, and, consequently, to her, that
      it was impossible for him to give it an expression at once
      clear and just.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end he wrote no more letters, but spent his nights
      making sonnets instead, in the Petrarchian manner, sad
      laments compounded of passion and despair, in the art of
      which he found some ease from the realities that tormented
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally he abandoned even this vehicle for the relief of
      his surcharged heart, and before the end of that tedious
      journey, in which they crossed and recrossed their tracks,
      he had reasoned himself into a condition of sorrowful
      resignation. He came to regard the intervention of the
      Governor of Zealand in his affairs as a wise dispensation
      of Providence, to rescue him and to rescue Johanna from a
      situation of hopelessness. They belonged, he and she, to
      different orders, between which any honourable alliance was
      impossible, whilst his love for her was too fine and
      spiritual and holy to admit even the contemplation of an
      alliance of any other nature. He had lived, he now told
      himself, in a dream, a poet's dream, all loveliness and
      hope unrealisable, and for a spell he had imagined that in
      his dream he had found the realities he sought. Now he was
      awake again, rudely awakened and being dragged by the heels
      back to the world and the life to which he really belonged,
      of which he was a part and in which he had his allotted
      duties to perform, the life from whose hollowness and
      apparent unreality he had sought so vainly and futilely to
      escape. As if a man ever could escape his destiny and the
      obligations which his place in life imposed upon him at
      every step from the moment of his birth!
    </p>
    <p>
      To what, he wondered, was he returning? Would they put it
      upon him that his honour demanded the fulfilment of his
      betrothal to the Lady Catharine of Bourbon? Ah, not that!
      He would not so defile the real love which had come to
      blossom in his heart, even though Fate denied fruition to
      it. Though he might never claim Johanna for his own, at
      least he would remain dedicate to her. He would live and
      die a celibate in honour of her, consecrated to the thought
      of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an uplifting resolve, and it took some of the burden
      of sorrow from his soul. The sense of sacrifice, the
      thought of vowing himself to an ideal, abstract love,
      exalted him. It was in the true romantic spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      His sorrow and his fond yearnings partly allayed by this
      resolve, he came at last upon the Duke at Saint-Quentin.
      That was on an afternoon in June, two weeks after leaving
      Flushing, and having followed a zigzag course between the
      pleasant wooded uplands of the east and the dreary flats of
      the west, which but for the dykes that shut out the sea
      would have been a morass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up through the town to the grim citadel rode Diesenhofen.
      Arrived there, he left Count Anthony in the guard room of
      the barbican, in the care of his men, whilst himself he
      went forward to seek audience of the Duke. An hour he
      waited in the spacious antechamber that was variously
      peopled by courtiers in silk and captains in steel, with
      here and there the scarlet flame of a prelate's robes, and
      where the only language heard was French. Booted and dusty
      as he had ridden in, the Lorrainer attracted some
      attention. It was assumed his business must be urgent,
      indeed, that he should come thus into the presence of his
      prince. By one or two he was questioned. But his short
      answers that he was from Zealand quenched all interest in
      him in an hour in which all eyes were turned towards
      France.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the curtained Gothic door at the room's end swung
      open, and, whilst an usher held aside the arras, forth
      stepped three men, in the tallest, oldest, and most elegant
      of whom Diesenhofen recognised the Count of Saint-Pol, that
      Constable of France, who strove to serve two masters. All
      eyes were turned upon him, and a sensitive witness must
      have been instantly aware of the general relief when it was
      observed that he was calm and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diesenhofen was still admiring him, when he was roused by
      the chamberlain's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "His Highness commands the officer from the Governor of
      Zealand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Diesenhofen found the Duke alone, leaning against the
      mullion of the tall Gothic window which stood open to the
      sunlight. He was frowning thoughtfully, and it was a long
      moment before he condescended to become conscious of the
      soldier's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," he said at last, "you are from Zealand with very
      urgent tidings. I trust they are not evil; at least not
      more evil than I am growing accustomed to."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think your Highness will account my tidings far from
      evil." He bent the knee as he proffered the Governor's
      letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing from the window to a table on which a map was
      spread beside some papers, the Duke broke the seal and
      unfolded the parchment. As he read, his gloomy countenance
      lighted. Over the edge of the sheet his dark eyes glowed
      upon the Lorrainer. "You have brought his lordship?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He waits in the guard room, Highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The guard room!" The Duke's frown and the ascending pitch
      of his voice announced his surprised displeasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stolidly Diesenhofen explained that his orders were
      explicit, that he took no risks, and that, for the rest, he
      had used the prisoner with all courtesy and consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was curtly dismissed to fetch Count Anthony, and Count
      Anthony, once alone with the Duke, restraining the embrace
      with which the Duke would have received him, expressed
      himself freely and with righteous indignation upon this
      violation of his person and the constraint imposed upon
      him. At the end of it, he demanded instant liberty to go
      his ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Liberty you shall have," said Charles of Burgundy. "But
      what are your ways?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They are my own. I am not your vassal, Charles, and you
      have sanctioned a monstrous usurpation of right by might
      where I am concerned."
    </p>
    <p>
      The haughty, tempestuous, and headstrong Duke was patient
      and meek for once. Affection for his cousin and the
      perception that this indignation was entirely justified
      combined now with his own urgent need of every tried friend
      he could command. So he set himself to use conciliatory
      arguments, which if none too sound were the best at his
      disposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are rights of alliance, Anthony, as well as rights
      of vassalage."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They include no right to subject me to duress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were so clear on that, why did you run away?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Run away! I departed your Court when I grew weary of it.
      That was all."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Without even the courtesy of craving leave of me. Are
      these the manners of a guest in Guelders?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I desired to go in peace. I desired no quarrel with you,
      Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "On what grounds did you fear a quarrel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "On those of my betrothal to the Lady Catharine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That ground of quarrel, at least, has been removed. The
      Lady Catharine is no longer available. She has consoled
      herself with your brother Adolph."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke's grin was not entirely free from malice. He knew
      that the statement and its obvious implication would give
      Count Anthony something to think about. The marriage
      between Bourbon and Egmont had been projected for the
      consolidation of the political alliance between Guelders
      and Burgundy. To give full effect to this, the proper party
      to the contract on the side of Guelders was the heir to the
      duchy. That advantage should have been taken of Anthony's
      absence to substitute his younger brother as the bridegroom
      was hardly a good omen. It seemed to fore-shadow the desire
      for a wider substitution. Count Anthony was taken aback.
      Indignation kindled in his long, fair face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was this by your contriving, Charles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The heavy countenance sneered at him. "Oh, I thank you for
      the thought!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you consented. Your consent was necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And still more urgently necessary to marry that baggage
      Catharine. Adolph happened to be finding favour in her
      eyes, and I sanctioned what they both desired before the
      jade could change her mind again, since not even my
      commands could have constrained the slighted Catharine to
      await your return or to marry you when it happened. At last
      perhaps you'll give me reason for the gentle force I've
      used with you." He lowered his voice to a grumbling note as
      he added: "I had no wish to see your brother Adolph
      extending his usurpation of your functions."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony shrugged in sheer disgust. There was little
      love between him and his family, and covetousness ever
      nauseated him. "Let him usurp what he pleases, and God give
      him joy of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke's swarthy face grew stern. He set his arms akimbo.
      "Here's frenzy! You'll let your younger brother give rein
      to unnatural ambition, and ride over you to the throne that
      should be yours?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is that the aim, then? Will nothing less content him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must I make Adolph known to you?" wondered the Duke, and
      he became sententious. "Like poets, princes are born, not
      made; born to a sacred trust from on high. Incalculable
      harm follows upon any disloyalty to that trust. How long do
      you suppose that Guelders would preserve its independence
      with Adolph on the throne?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke in the solemn, impressive manner that is born only
      of strong convictions. And perhaps no conviction was
      stronger in Charles of Burgundy--begotten of the adulatory
      phrases addressed to him from childhood--than that of the
      divine appointment and divine mission of princes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Count Anthony could answer him, he continued on
      another note. "And that is not the only reason why I thank
      God for your return. I am at the point of distraction,
      Anthony, and in need, in sorest need, of a trusty friend
      and more."
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone was unusually gentle and wistful, and his
      expression was entirely stripped of its habitual arrogance.
      Count Anthony, who loved him, was touched by his manner and
      melted from any lingering indignation. He has been
      accounted weak by the undiscerning because he was always
      weak in his resentments and ever ready to discard them. And
      now, to complete a reconciliation for which he had shown
      the need to be on his own side, Charles afforded him a
      mollifying if not quite accurate explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My fool of a Governor of Zealand acted too straitly upon
      orders I issued many months ago at the time of your
      disappearance. Bear him no ill will, Anthony. He's a
      faithful, loyal dog who obeys orders to the letter if
      without discretion, and apparently he is served by men of
      the same stamp. I blame not him, but myself, for what has
      happened to you; and I blame myself sorely. I would not
      have had you used as you have been used, and yet, by Saint
      George, I was never more glad to see any living man. Sit
      you there, my friend, while I recite my woes; and in the
      end you'll pity me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He pushed Count Anthony forcibly into a chair, and
      thereafter for an hour and more, while soldier, prince, and
      prelate cooled their heels in the antechamber, he poured
      into his cousin's sympathetic ears, the tale of his
      distractions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was angry with you last month," he began, "when I held
      in Bruges my first chapter of the Knights of the Golden
      Fleece. You were absent from your place, a thing I do not
      lightly overlook in any man. Moreover, I needed you then;
      needed you as I need you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He strode on his short, powerful legs to the window and
      back, his brows darkened by his thoughts. "Taking full
      advantage of the privileges conferred upon them by the
      rules of the order, the brethren very plainly expressed
      hostile opinions on my general conduct of affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony was startled. He knew the existence of the
      privilege in that exalted knightly brotherhood, but had
      never dreamed of its being exercised against the sacred
      person of the Duke himself, the order's natural head, the
      very fount of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They censured me with harshness, especially to the nobles,
      alleging that my rigour in punishing faults is out of all
      proportion to my measures in rewarding virtue and services.
      They taxed me with parsimony. I hoard the revenues, they
      say, instead of scattering them in emulation of the
      princely lavishness of my father."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scattering them on themselves, they meant," quoth Anthony.
      "And you? What did you answer them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could I answer? I think anger made me dumb. That and
      the remembrance that who excuses himself accuses himself.
      Could I condescend to explain myself? I submitted in
      silence to their reproaches. I needed there an independent
      advocate to whip them into shame of their own words. That
      is what you would have done had you been there. That is
      where you failed me by your absence."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Count Anthony said nothing; but regret cast a
      little shadow over his countenance. The Duke, pacing ever
      to and fro, railed on. They were not presumptuous, he
      declared, beyond the licence granted them by Duke Philip
      when their exalted order was founded; and yet they were
      presumptuous in that they pronounced upon insufficient
      knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I hoard my revenues, I do so against the fearful need
      that will soon be forced upon me, a need for which all my
      hoarding is inadequate, as will presently appear. Already
      last April in the States-General summoned for the purpose
      by the King of France, it was declared that Normandy must
      be retained by Louis. That was a fair beginning. To show me
      whither he was drifting, it was not necessary for him to
      add, as is reported to me, that the Treaty of Conflans was
      wrested from him by undue influence. He began to tear it up
      when the States-General made that declaration touching
      Normandy. I tell you, Anthony, there is no faith in that
      shifty, foxy little knave. No treaty will bind him once he
      thinks it safe to break it. I have word that he is levying
      troops and organising forces. He aims, I suppose, at the
      cities of the Somme. You see what is coming?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "War, I suppose," said Count Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "War," Charles agreed. He stood erect, his jutting chin
      held high. "I welcome it. Since he wants war, he shall have
      a bellyful from me. I was made for war, I think, and this
      time, by Saint George, he shall learn it and remember the
      lesson. It is in preparation for war that I have been
      making this progress through the frontier provinces, and be
      sure I'll prepare thoroughly by the help of God and Saint
      George."
    </p>
    <p>
      He swung away to the window again. Looking out into the
      courtyard, across which the rays of the sun were now
      aslant, he laughed grimly, and pointed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There go the Constable and de Biche. De Biche, who was
      once my father's creature, and is now the cat's-paw of King
      Louis. Saint-Pol, who, for his own profit, tried to be the
      friend of both sides and is faithful to neither, although
      to-day he holds the sword of France. They were lately with
      me, bearers of lying pacific messages from King Louis,
      messages calculated to lull my alarm, while he arms to the
      teeth against me. He wants time."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke swung from the window again, and came striding
      back to the table, his hand on the hilt of his dagger. He
      laughed grimly, showing his strong teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So do I. Therefore, I pretend to believe them. To the
      revenues with whose hoarding I am reproached by the Knights
      of the Golden Fleece, I shall add levies to be made upon
      the Netherlands; gold to be transmuted into steel. The foxy
      Louis shall admire my alchemy. In the Rhine Provinces,
      throughout the Empire, in the Cantons, in Italy, wherever
      men are to be hired, I'll hire them, and I'll put such an
      army in the field that my rascally brother-in-law of France
      shall pray to patch up the Conflans Treaty again so that he
      may shelter himself behind it. I'll give him time, so that
      I may have time, myself, for this; for this and my
      marriage. My marriage! My marriage with the Princess
      Margaret of York!" He laughed harshly, ruefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men say," quoth Count Anthony, by way of felicitation,
      "that she is very fair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To the devil with her fairness!" roared the Duke, who had
      wrought himself by now into a passion. He crashed his fist
      upon the table. "My God, Anthony, this is no wenching
      business. If she were humped like a camel and tusked like a
      boar, I still must marry her, for the sake of the alliance
      with England. To this has Louis of France reduced me.
      Through my mother, who was half-Lancastrian, a quarter of
      my blood is blood of Lancaster; and I am to mingle this
      with the blood of York! Yet this, too, must I do to make my
      dominions safe against King Louis, and to consolidate
      against him this House of Burgundy, of which I am no more
      than the life-tenant." This last he spoke in a tone almost
      of awe, the man of Destiny alluding to the burden of his
      mission. Then he flung himself down in his great chair
      before the table, and looked across it at the grave-faced
      Count Anthony, who remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You perceive my need of you, my urgent need of every
      friend in camp and council. The lances you may bring me out
      of Guelders shall be paid handsomely from these hoarded
      revenues. I'll need every man and every pike that you can
      muster. But more than those I shall need you, Anthony. You
      have the calm deliberateness I lack, and I can trust you
      where I can trust no other of these greedy self-seekers,
      who will stand by me just so long as they perceive no
      greater profit to be made elsewhere. Your judgment I trust
      implicitly. Your advice I know to be honest and sprung from
      love of me. You'll stay by me now, Anthony!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward, and flung an arm across the table, the
      powerful short-fingered hand supine and open.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appeal was not one that Count Anthony could resist.
      Guelders must stand by Burgundy to the end that Burgundy
      should stand by Guelders in her need. So much policy
      demanded. And his personal affection for Charles of
      Burgundy demanded no less. For this had he returned; for
      this been dragged from his dreams to face realities, he who
      had sought realities afar and in vain. So he assured
      himself. But there was a sense of choking in his throat and
      a mist before his eyes, and in the heart of it the fair,
      delicate face of Johanna, sweetly virginal and maddeningly
      desirable. Then the mist cleared. He fetched a sigh and
      took the proffered hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles, I am yours for your need of me."
    </p>

    <h1>
      THE KNIGHT OF THE TULIP
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony welcomed the distraction of the activities
      now thrust upon him, and sought in them an anodyne for his
      heartache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days after his interview with Charles of Burgundy, he
      descended upon his father's Court at Nimeguen, to the
      surprise of all and to the dismay of some. His brother
      Adolph was absent, with the Burgundian Court at Brussels,
      in attendance upon Madame Catharine, who was one of the
      ladies-in-waiting of the Dowager Duchess Isabella. Anthony
      was thankful for this circumstance, since he found
      opposition more than enough from the Duke his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      He submitted patiently to parental upbraidings on the score
      of his eccentricities and his reckless extravagances during
      the year of his mysterious absence. His notes of hand for
      outrageous sums had poured in upon the treasury to the
      exasperation of the parsimonious Duke, and now he came
      calmly to demand a matter of twenty thousand gold florins
      to enable him to raise, mount, equip, and maintain a body
      of eight thousand lances with which to succour the Duke of
      Burgundy in his need. If this was the only purpose for
      which he had returned home, it would have been much better
      for Guelders if he had remained permanently absent.
      Guelders, his father informed him, reared no fatted calves
      for prodigals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony did not argue with his sire. He knew the
      futility of reasoning with prejudice. Instead, he sought
      the chancellor of the duchy and arranged with him for the
      convening of the estates. He appeared before them two days
      later, and delivered an appeal which La Marche, who has
      preserved it for us, describes as a model of statesmanly
      oratory. He pointed out the dangers with which Burgundy was
      confronted, and the dangers which would confront Guelders
      if Burgundy were defeated. The maintenance of the
      independence of Guelders was the first and most sacred duty
      of her rulers, and this independence could be ensured only
      by stoutly supporting their one great ally and preserving
      him in his fullest strength to the end that in turn he
      might preserve them.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the disgust of his father, who regarded it as so much
      waste--but dared not say so, lest his words should be
      reported to the Duke of Burgundy--the money was voted
      without demur, to be refunded by a special poll-tax.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that Count Anthony set about re-establishing his
      household, which he had disbanded at the time of his
      departure from Brussels. He entrusted the details of
      raising and equipping the necessary force to the Sire
      Bertrand de la Roche, a gentleman of his confidence and a
      soldier of experience, and then with a bodyguard of his
      own, four esquires and two pages, he left Nimeguen to
      rejoin the Duke of Burgundy at Bruges, whither he had
      meanwhile returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now that he adopted, to the horror of the heralds, a
      fresh personal device: on a field gules, two tulips, or and
      argent, in saltire--whence he came shortly thereafter to be
      known, more or less ironically, as the Knight of the Tulip.
    </p>
    <p>
      His report of what he had accomplished ensured him a warm
      reception from the Duke. To mark his appreciation, Charles
      desired of him a service which was in itself an honour:
      that with the Duke's mother, the Duchess Isabella, and his
      young daughter Mary of Burgundy, with Monsieur de Rubempré
      and the Count and Countess of Charny, he should repair to
      Sluys as the Duke's representative to receive and welcome
      his bride, the Lady Margaret of York, on her arrival there
      from England. And he sought counsel of Count Anthony in
      other matters, as had been his custom of old, and
      particularly in the matter of the fresh taxes to be levied
      on the Netherlands towards the expenses of the coming war.
      Count Anthony's advice was sound. Remembering how himself
      he had prevailed in Nimeguen, he counselled the use of
      similar arguments in Zealand and Friesland. Let it be shown
      to the estates there how imperative to the maintenance of
      their privileges was the maintenance of Burgundian power
      which had ever respected and defended them, and the rest
      would follow. But the arguments must be presented by the
      Duke in person. It was the personal appeal that would lead
      to the ready opening of the burgher coffers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persuaded, Charles resolved to act upon this advice, so
      soon as his marriage and the subsequent festivities should
      have been accomplished. On the morrow, with an escort of
      twenty lances, every man in a white surcoat bearing the new
      tulip device, Count Anthony set out for Sluys as the
      representative of the Duke of Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Princess Margaret of York arrived with the state and
      splendour becoming the sister of a king; but it was as
      moonshine to sunlight compared with the state and splendour
      of the Burgundian reception awaiting her, a reception which
      was to mark the wealth and power of a Duke who in both
      could outrival any living monarch, and to dazzle the world
      in general and the watchful King of France in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fleet of sixteen vessels under the command of the Lord
      Admiral of England was employed to bring the Princess and
      her escort to the port of Sluys. She was in the immediate
      care of her royal brother, Lord Scales, and the Bishop of
      Salisbury, and attended by a troop of knights and gentlemen
      representing the flower of English nobility of the Yorkist
      faction, and some fourscore ladies of rank at whose head
      stood the Duchess of Norfolk, then reputed the most
      beautiful woman in England.
    </p>
    <p>
      To receive her on her landing and conduct her to the Castle
      of Sluys came a noble company in which Count Anthony of
      Guelders was supported by such illustrious nobles as John
      of Luxembourg and John of Nassau, the magnificence of whose
      equipages made her own look provincial and paltry. At her
      lodging in the castle she was waited upon by the Dowager
      Duchess and the Lady Mary of Burgundy, by the Count and
      Countess of Charny, and a constantly flowing train of
      nobles and dignitaries, until, finally, on the evening of
      the day after her arrival, came the Duke himself to pay his
      homage and formally to exchange vows of betrothal. That
      night from the windows of the Castle of Sluys she saw in
      the sky to the south the red glow of the huge pyramidal
      bonfires, each forty feet high, which in honour of her
      coming were lighted in Bruges.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week she remained there very nobly entertained, and
      then a train of painted and gilded barges luxuriously
      equipped, conveyed this fair, calm English Princess and her
      suite to Damme, the great fortified port of Bruges in whose
      basin floated the argosies of all nations, attracted
      thither by the great commerce which made Bruges, with her
      population of a quarter of a million souls, the rival of
      Venice and Genoa. Hither to Damme at five o'clock on the
      morning of Sunday the third of July came the Duke for the
      nuptials which were celebrated by the Bishop of Salisbury
      and the Papal Legate. After the nuptial mass, he rode back
      with his private escort to the Cour des Princes at Bruges,
      there to await the state entry of his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      She arrived some two hours later at the Gate of Holy Cross,
      the object and centre of a pageantry the like of which
      neither her eyes nor those of any of her English followers
      had ever witnessed or imagined. She came in a horse-litter
      covered with cloth of gold, the white horses that bore it
      caparisoned in cloth of gold from which little silver bells
      were hung, with roses entwined in their flowing white
      manes. Herself, she was dressed in cloth of silver, a crown
      of diamonds flashing on her fair head, above which with her
      own hands she placed the chaplet of roses that was offered
      to her by a company of nuns at the Gate of Holy Cross.
      Thence the procession moved towards the heart of that great
      city of bridges, the Grande Place and the Palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its head went the representatives of the Church, a body
      of prelates and lesser ecclesiastics, in cope and surplice
      and stole, with crucifix, reliquaries, and effulgent
      monstrances. Next came the Collace, the members of the
      Burgomaster's Council, in their official robes and chains
      of office. Followed the members of the ducal household,
      first the liveries of black and purple, then the higher
      functionaries in their scarlet pourpoints and long mantles
      of black velvet. After these came a band of trumpeters,
      next a troop of archers in gala liveries; then the heralds,
      pursuivants, and kings-at-arms in their blazoned tabards;
      and then the representatives of foreign nations, the twenty
      ambassadors and their households, and the members of each
      of the seventeen trading companies, amongst whom were,
      conspicuous for their splendour, the Venetians, the
      Florentines, and the Easterlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately ahead of the bride's litter marched a company
      of English archers of the bodyguard, whilst on foot, on
      either side of the litter, walked the thirty Knights of the
      Golden Fleece in their majestic scarlet robes.
    </p>
    <p>
      After her rode thirteen of her maids-of-honour on richly
      caparisoned, snow-white palfreys, and after these came a
      line of gilded chariots emblazoned with the arms of England
      and Burgundy, bearing the remainder of her ladies, the
      beautiful Duchess of Norfolk in the first of these; and,
      finally, to close that vast procession, an army of knights
      and gentlemen all gorgeously arrayed, the trappings of
      their horses glittering with gold and gems and fringed with
      silver bells.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, in a blaze of July sunshine and under a sky that was
      like a dome of polished steel, the Princess Margaret of
      York, now Duchess of Burgundy, rode through the streets of
      Bruges that were all strewn with flowers and boughs, hung
      with costliest tapestries from Flemish looms, with silks of
      Persia and with cloth of gold, and bridged by triumphal
      arches, from which flights of doves were released as she
      passed under them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Progress was slow, not only because of the press of people,
      but also because of the mysteries, or theatrical
      representations, with which the bride was entertained on
      the way, and for each of which a halt was called. They
      performed for her the story of Adam and Eve, the marriage
      of Cleopatra and King Alexander, Saint George's defence of
      a beautiful maiden from a dragon, and the like, to her
      obvious delight and that of her following.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well might John Paston, who was in her train, write home to
      his mother in Cheshire from Bruges on the Friday next after
      Saint Thomas:
    </p>
    <p>
      "By my trowthe I herd nevyr of so gret plente as ther is
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And as for the Dwyks coort, as of lords, and ladys &amp;
      gentylwomen, knyts, sqwyers and gentylmen I hert never of
      none lyek to it save King Artourys cort. And by my trowthe
      I have no wyt nor remembrance to wryte to you half the
      worchep that is her."
    </p>
    <p>
      That, of course, was at the end of a week of daily
      banqueting and dancing and great passages-at-arms
      accompanied by almost unimaginable pageantries which were
      held in the lists erected in the Grande Place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the bridal procession made its gorgeous, sluggish
      progress through the city, acclaimed by the thousands who
      lined the streets, crowded the windows, balconies, and even
      roofs of the buildings. The bruit of these splendours had
      attracted folk, not merely from the immediately surrounding
      country, but some, who could afford the means and leisure
      for travel, from considerable distances. Amongst these were
      Mynheer Claessens and his daughter and Philip Danvelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johanna had been dejected and pining ever since the abrupt
      departure of Anthony Egmont from Flushing. From what Philip
      had told her and what else she had been able to gather, she
      chose to conclude that for some reason beyond her knowledge
      he had been taken prisoner. It was idle for Philip and her
      father to point out that the details of his departure did
      not bear this out. He had ridden sword on thigh with the
      lances and the officer who had waited upon him at the
      Zeelanderhof, not as a captive, but as a man escorted. At
      first, she had accepted this, and had been glad to accept
      it. But as days passed and grew to weeks without any word
      from him, she returned to her earlier conviction that he
      was a prisoner. It was impossible for her to believe that
      he would neglect to communicate with her if he were free to
      do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her listlessness in those days became a matter of grave
      concern to her father. To Danvelt, who was a very frequent
      visitor now, her condition was less obvious. An intensely
      self-centred man, he was little observant of others, and
      interested in them only in so far as they ministered to his
      own needs. If he observed any change at all in Johanna, he
      would account it a change for the better, for it accorded
      with his notions of propriety that women should be
      self-effacing. He had noted in the past a certain
      presumption in Johanna, which he accounted the one flaw in
      her character: there was a disposition on her part to
      express views upon the serious concerns of life, which he
      regarded as entirely beyond a woman's province. Her
      increased demureness, into which he interpreted the outward
      signs of her sorrow and anxiety, rendered her more
      desirable in his eyes, and led him in those days to woo her
      with an insistence which would take no refusal seriously,
      regarding these refusals as the rather tiresome expressions
      of an excessive modesty which could bring itself to
      surrender only after endless onslaughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He complained of it to Master Claessens during the last
      days of June. He represented that the heavy
      responsibilities devolving upon him by his father's death
      left him little time for these almost daily excursions into
      Flushing, and that there was no reason in the world why his
      nuptials with Johanna should continue to be postponed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No reason at all," Claessens stolidly agreed with him,
      "save Johanna's inclinations. It is not a matter in which a
      maid may with propriety be hurried."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurried!" echoed Danvelt, and snorted his disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be patient, Philip." Claessens knew well the trouble in
      his daughter's mind. He put his faith in time to efface the
      memory of the handsome, courtly Egmont, who in an evil hour
      had darkened his threshold. Whatever the causes that had so
      abruptly removed him, Claessens was secretly thankful that
      he had gone. As things stood, the harm done was quite
      sufficient. "Johanna is in need of distraction. Life here
      is dull for a maid."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The occupations of a wife will afford her precisely the
      distraction that she needs," said Danvelt, pompous as an
      oracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Maybe," said Claessens, without conviction. "Meanwhile
      there is to be a brave show in Bruges for the Duke's
      nuptials. Johanna has never been to Bruges, and I have
      always promised to take her to see the Chapel of the Holy
      Blood. This might be the occasion for it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt demurred. The town would be full of strangers and
      the inns overcrowded, their charges outrageously increased.
      Since he had come into his wealth, Danvelt, who had been
      prodigal enough before, was grown thrifty to the point of
      parsimony. Johanna, when the matter was proposed to her,
      agreed with an interest so indifferent that her father felt
      a pang of disappointment. But in the end they went, and on
      the morning of the Princess Margaret's wedding they issued
      betimes from their lodging at the Orb and Sceptre, and took
      up a position near the Stadhuis, whence to view the
      procession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dazzling, incredible display aroused Johanna from her
      brooding. The colour was whipped into her cheeks and a
      certain old-time sparkle to her eye, so that her father
      fondly observing these signs felicitated himself upon the
      step he had taken. But his felicitations were premature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The body of English archers, stalwart and gay in their
      feathered hats and their red brigandines quilted and
      studded, their long bows slung beside them, had just swept
      by, and now the horse-litter of the smiling young Duchess
      was coming abreast of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eagerly Johanna craned her neck to obtain a better view of
      that sweet lady, who sat there enthroned, crowned so
      appropriately with roses above the sparkling diadem on her
      brow. And then she was conscious of a tugging at her arm.
      It was Philip, in a state of boorish excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look! Look! Yonder! The first of those!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was pointing to the stately line of scarlet-mantled
      Knights of the Golden Fleece, who walked beside the litter,
      pointing to the very head of it, to one who in that most
      honourable company held the most honourable place.
      Following the indications of his out-flung hand, she
      beheld, to her inexpressible amazement, Anthony Egmont, her
      Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bewildered, breathless, she continued to stare, to
      scrutinise. It was he beyond all doubt, just as it was
      beyond all doubt that he was arrayed in the gorgeous robes
      of the Toison d'Or, that he wore its insignia about his
      neck, and its feathered black velvet cap upon his tawny
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then she heard her father's voice asking a question of
      a portly neighbour. He, too, had seen, as his question
      informed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is that, sir, do you know: he at the head of the line
      of Knights of the Golden Fleece?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, sir?" she heard the questioning answer. "Whence are
      you? That is Count Anthony of Egmont, Prince of Guelders,
      the Duke's cousin and friend, and one of the first
      gentlemen in Christendy, prince and poet, knight and
      troubadour; there's none more admired or better loved in
      all the provinces." The fellow was garrulous and glad to
      air his knowledge. He ran on: "In the passage at-arms at
      the Tree of Gold this afternoon, when the Great Bastard
      holds the lists against all comers, if he meets his match
      at all, it will be when he meets Count Anthony."
    </p>
    <p>
      Claessens' arm was about his daughter's slim waist. She had
      sunk against him, half-swooning, and he, well knowing what
      blow had smitten her, set his teeth and prayed God to damn
      the soul of one of the first gentlemen in Christendy.

      BETROTHAL

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The visit of Claessens and his daughter to Bruges ended
      abruptly, to the infinite chagrin of Master Danvelt. What
      to the other two had been matter for consternation had been
      to him a subject for elation. No longer hereafter would he
      allude vaguely to "my friend Anthony Egmont, a gentleman of
      parts." He could say definitely and without fear of
      contradiction, "my good friend Count Anthony of Egmont, the
      Prince of Guelders." He was conscious of an increase in
      social consequence. For if you cannot be great or
      distinguished in yourself, the next best thing is to have
      the acquaintance of those who are great and distinguished.
      Thus, by reflection, you shine with a little of their
      glory. To the ignorant and undiscerning the moon is a
      self-luminous body in the heavens. Nor was the boast one
      that would strain belief. Under the late Duke Philip, the
      burghers had been so fostered, encouraged, and treated on
      equal terms that a great deal of the luxury which marked
      his own and his son's environment was due to this very
      cause. Wealthy burghers received at Court sought to magnify
      themselves by an outward display which eclipsed the lustre
      of the nobles; and the nobles in their turn, not to be
      outdone by these opulent traders, felt it incumbent upon
      the dignity of their estate to assume a still greater
      magnificence. From this competition resulted at the
      Burgundian Court those splendours which dazzled Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner, father and daughter kept their lodging, on
      the plea that the heat and glare and noise of the morning
      had been too much for Johanna, and that she needed rest.
      Nothing, however, could withhold Master Danvelt from the
      great joust of the Tree of Gold which was being held in the
      Grande Place, and from witnessing there the performance of
      his friend the Prince of Guelders. He came back in the
      evening bubbling with the relation of marvels, and
      particularly with the account of the passage at arms
      between the Bastard of Burgundy and the Knight of the
      Tulip, the device, he announced, of his friend Count
      Anthony. Nor was he discouraged by the listlessness with
      which his two companions received his tale. There were to
      be further displays upon the morrow and for a week
      thereafter, on an ever increasing scale of sumptuousness.
      And there was feasting for all. Bonfires were alight and
      the fountains in the great square were running with wines
      of Burgundy and the Rhine.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the morrow Master Claessens dismayed him with the
      announcement of their intention to return instantly to
      Flushing. The state of Johanna's health demanded it. When
      he could not dissuade them from this, Danvelt at first
      considered allowing them to depart, himself remaining.
      Finally, he sulkily consented to accompany them, and for
      the first day of the journey by barge was so resentful of
      being cheated of his expectations that he scarcely
      exchanged a word with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, however, they had transhipped at Sluys, he thawed a
      little. In a measure, as the memories of the glories of the
      Bruges wedding faded from his mind, this came to be filled
      instead by consideration of the sweetness, the delicate
      white beauty of Johanna, now enhanced by the gentle
      wistfulness in which she was wrapped. As his greenish eyes
      contemplated her, sitting on the deck of the vessel that
      bore them across the sunlit sea to Flushing, she seemed to
      him infinitely desirable, and he grew impatient and a
      little resentful of the postponements which he had suffered
      hitherto. Assuredly there must be an end to these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the source of her wistfulness and pallor no suspicion
      crossed his dullness. Of the shame searing her chaste soul
      he caught no indication. Even had he known what was passing
      in her mind, it is to be doubted if he would have
      understood. For he was gross of fibre without the capacity
      to perceive that a thought harboured may become as
      tormenting to a sensitive mind as a shameful deed
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Johanna's mind to torture her was the memory of all the
      thoughts she had entertained on the subject of Anthony, of
      the words he had spoken of which those thoughts had been
      conceived, of his unmistakable wooing of her, and of the
      shameful purpose which she was now compelled to suppose it
      to have had. She remembered so vividly the warning of Friar
      Stephen, and despised herself for her foolish, confident
      scorn of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the outset she had accounted Anthony Egmont a
      gentleman of birth; but she had not supposed him of so
      lofty a station as to preclude in those days his being a
      suitor for the hand of the daughter of so wealthy a burgher
      as her father. To discover him on the princely eminence he
      occupied was to have no illusions left. She felt herself
      unutterably shamed and insulted by a wooing that had
      brought her--poor fool--such glowing rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very reputation for chivalry, in the term's best and
      fullest sense, which he enjoyed, but made her shame the
      deeper, her contempt of him and of herself more poignant.
      She had succumbed so easily to the honeyed phrases of one
      who was not merely a libertine, but a hypocrite. Where had
      been her wits, where her feminine intuitions? They had been
      overwhelmed by her vanity and the lure of her silly senses.
      Thus Johanna in her bitter introspective self-condemnation.
      The only thing she did not perceive quite clearly was the
      motive for his abrupt departure from Flushing, forsaking
      the enterprise and amusement which she afforded him. That
      something had happened to render it necessary, however, the
      circumstances showed. And how lightly he had gone, how
      lightly abandoned his unholy quest, was more than
      established by the fact that he had never troubled to send
      so much as a word of explanation, apology, or excuse to the
      woman to whom he had been uttering words of love within an
      hour of his departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into her bitter musings broke the voice of Philip, softly
      muted. Unperceived he had crept to the side of the litter
      in which she reclined in the ship's waist, and now found a
      seat there on a coil of rope. Her father was on the quarter
      with the master of the vessel, and most of the men were
      forward. They were quite alone there in the shade of the
      bellying mizzen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Johanna!" he said softly, "you are very pensive."
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to look at him. If she considered his florid
      face and yellow hair, his eyes of greenish brown, his
      shallow brow and jutting nose and obstinate chin, all that
      she beheld in him was now honesty and kindliness. She
      remembered of him only such traits as were in his favour,
      such things as his readiness to risk his neck in warning
      Anthony Egmont because of the debt that lay between them.
      Here was no libertine, no predatory wolf, who used gifts of
      personal beauty, courtly experience, and mental endowments
      for the furtherance of vile aims; but a man of her own
      class, a solid burgher, honest, downright, and of decent
      mind and life. He might be unable to string rhymes, but
      faith could be attached to what he said; he might lack
      graces of person, but he was of a solidity upon which a
      woman could lean with confidence and trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put forth a hand and took one of her own, which she
      relinquished to him. That hand of his might be squat, and
      freckled, a short-fingered paw ending in gnawed
      finger-nails. But it was strong and honest; a hand that
      would support a woman and protect her; and Johanna in all
      her life until this hour had never needed protection, and,
      therefore, as it seemed to her, never valued the features
      that held the promise of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled gently, sadly, into his stupidly masterful
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pensive? Yes," she answered him. "There is no harm in
      thinking."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No harm; but no profit. No good ever came of it. And of
      what were you thinking?" His hand stroked hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what? Of life."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Life's to be lived, not thought about," said Master
      Philip; "to be lived happily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If possible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It must be made possible. I think I can make your life
      happy, Johanna; I know that you can make mine happy." There
      was a note of cajolery in his voice. "Why do we wait,
      Johanna? What is there now to wait for? I want you at
      Middelburg." He leaned closer. "I want you so much,
      Johanna. I may be a clumsy lout in some ways, and I've no
      experience in dalliance to lend me a lover's arts, but I
      love you, Johanna. Why will you keep me waiting?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no experience in dalliance to lend me a lover's
      arts, but I love you, Johanna."
    </p>
    <p>
      The phrase echoed and re-echoed through her mind, touching
      raw jangling chords in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been dazzled by the glitter of those arts of which
      Philip confessed the lack. It was an easy step in her
      present state to assume an enduring sincerity of purpose
      where these arts were lacking. By no apter phrase could
      Philip Danvelt have served his ends. He set, as it seemed,
      his own solid worth against the tinsel sparkle of
      meretricious romanticism. Almost she grew tender towards
      him, convicted herself of injustice and harshness in past
      opinions of him, and became dimly aware that only in
      marriage could she find definite shelter from such
      experiences as that which she had suffered. The intentions
      of him who wooed a maid might be in doubt, and by that
      doubt could a maiden be betrayed; but the intentions of him
      who wooed a wife were clear from the first word he uttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip offered her shelter, sustenance, genuine affection,
      and peaceful security. What more could any marriage offer?
      What was there in all the world to be preferred to this?
      And so, in that hour of reactions, she yielded, and thereby
      placed Philip more deeply in the debt of the Prince of
      Guelders than he already stood or than he could even guess.
      Anthony Egmont had not only saved his life, but had won
      Johanna for him as he could never have won her for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is there now to wait for, you ask," she said, on a
      note whose bitterness escaped him. "What, indeed?" And
      abruptly, she added: "I'll keep you waiting no longer,
      Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" He sucked in his breath in an amazement which was
      even greater than his satisfaction. "When, Johanna? When?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you will, Philip," she answered quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At once, then. Let us say in two weeks from now. That will
      leave time to spare for all that's needed to prepare."
    </p>
    <p>
      She felt his breath hot upon her cheek, caught the deep
      glow in his green-hazel eyes, and something within her
      shivered, and shivered again when presently he kissed her.

      THE WIFE OF PHILIP DANVELT
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      In August of that same year the Duke of Burgundy made his
      accession progress through the cities of Zealand,
      Friesland, and Holland with the twofold aim of receiving
      homage after exchanging oaths of fidelity with the
      representatives of the people, and of levying the large
      sums of money for which the impending war with France
      created the immediate need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everywhere, from Middelburg to The Hague, he lavishly
      entertained the wealthy burghers and their women-folk and
      the civic deputies who came to wait upon him. There were
      banquets and balls and mysteries to which his subjects were
      widely bidden, and he bore himself towards them as
      graciously as it lay within his stern dour nature. He may,
      too, have been a little softened by anxiety in those days.
      News followed him at every step of the measures being taken
      by King Louis, of the invasion of Normandy by the French
      troops, and of the steady amassing of forces for the
      overthrow of Burgundy. Meanwhile the Duke's own weapons
      were being steadily forged for him, and here in the North
      he was providing as quickly as possible the fuel to feed
      those forges. It is doubtful if in those days he had, apart
      from his own imperious will, any guide other than Count
      Anthony in the manner in which he conducted his affairs.
      The sum to be raised in the North, over and above the
      ordinary taxes, exceeded a half-million crowns of fifteen
      stivers, and so vast an amount was not lightly to be wrung
      from Netherland thrift. The arguments he employed to loosen
      purse-strings were those urged upon him by Count Anthony.
      Burgundy was represented as the shield and bulwark of
      Flemish liberties. The evils that might come like a blight
      out of Germany or France once that bulwark were removed
      were painted in bold colours, and thus were the Netherlands
      persuaded that if their prosperity were to be preserved, if
      the arts and commerce by which they throve were to remain
      untrammelled, the strength of Burgundy must be maintained.
      The wealthy merchants, who would be the heaviest losers by
      any dislocation of their trade, and the civic deputies, who
      had in view the welfare of the country as a whole, were
      readily convinced by such arguments amiably presented at
      banquets, and in the course of gracious receptions in which
      much honour was done to their wives and daughters. That
      among lesser folk there would be opposition to the
      assessments, and that in particular the new imposts upon
      provisions would press heavily upon poor villagers, were
      difficulties to be dealt with later when and as they arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the end of August, the progress successfully
      accomplished, the Duke now homing swiftly, made his final
      halt at Middelburg to persuade from the Zealanders the levy
      of sixteen thousand crowns which was to be Zealand's
      contribution to the total.
    </p>
    <p>
      The town was festively arrayed in preparation for his
      coming, and in accordance with the orders that had gone
      ahead of him to his faithful Governor. Triumphal arches,
      bearing the escutcheons of Burgundy and Zealand, had been
      erected in the streets. Tapestries and rich carpets decked
      the windows and balconies and the Burgomaster and his
      Council met him at the gates with a fulsomely conceived
      address of welcome. He was acclaimed as he rode through in
      light amour with his attendant troop of knights and
      gentlemen, his heralds in coats of blazonry, his bodyguard
      of crossbow-men, and his following of heavily armoured
      men-at-arms. The Sire Claude de Rhynsault had
      well-engineered the show to ensure the satisfaction of his
      ducal master.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Gravenhof the great hall, usually so bare, cold, and
      forbidding, had been made gay with cloth of gold and some
      of the richest products of the Arras looms, procured in
      haste so as to supply a fittingly splendid Burgundian
      setting. A dais had been erected at one end of the hall; it
      was carpeted in red, and under a canopy of cloth of gold
      was set a gilded chair of state for the Duke's highness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enthroned there that afternoon, attended by a dozen of his
      gentlemen, each vying with the other in magnificence, he
      accepted the homage of a great gathering assembled there by
      Rhynsault's invitation and comprising all persons of wealth
      and prominence, not merely in Middelburg itself, but
      throughout the Island of Walcheren.
    </p>
    <p>
      The civic dignitaries and many others whose wealth rendered
      them of consequence by burgher standards were with their
      wives personally presented by the stalwart Governor, who
      stood for the purpose on the first step of the dais on the
      Duke's left. On the Duke's immediate right, beside his
      chair, and leaning lightly against its tall back, stood
      Count Anthony of Guelders. He was alone there, and detached
      from the group of gaily clad nobles clustered behind and on
      the other side of the ducal throne. For all his tall vigour
      he had an air of listlessness. His long, comely countenance
      was pale and a little wistful, and there was a dreamy
      vacancy in his dark eyes as if either he did not see or did
      not heed the magnificent throng that was parading there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over a vest of cloth of gold he wore a pleated pourpoint of
      purple velvet with long sleeves, the points of which
      reached almost to his knees, and there were tiny jewels in
      the cords that laced it across his breast. His hose was of
      violet and he was shod in the long poulaines of black
      velvet, which in England were by law forbidden to any under
      the rank of an esquire. The collar of the Golden Fleece was
      the only ornament he wore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing there, tall and graceful, beside the stocky,
      seated figure of the young Duke, who was all in black, he
      took the eye, especially of the women as they came up to be
      presented. More closely observed by them even than the
      Duke, he, himself, observed none. There was before his eyes
      a vision which seldom left it in those days. Memory and
      longing limned the picture for him: A quadrangular court
      about which arose a tall red house, a grey stork advancing
      sedately to meet him; a pair of quail in an osier cage
      against the wall; a border of tulips, white and yellow, the
      tulips, argent and or, which he had taken for his device;
      and then the apparition of a Madonna clad in the blue in
      which the Italians were wont to paint her, a slim,
      gracious, golden-headed Madonna with a delicately tinted,
      delicately featured face, who bade him welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered that the bitter fight was over between the
      love, which had made him for a season forget his birth and
      blood, and the duty which he accounted owing to his
      station. He conceived that duty had won the final victory.
      He should have perceived his error in the persistence of
      this vision, now before him; in the terrible, aching
      longing it aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listless and vacant he leaned there, blind to the
      glittering throng that moved under his eyes, deaf to the
      hum of subdued voices, to the soft music being played by a
      troupe of musicians in one of the galleries, and the
      reiterated platitudes which his highness uttered as he
      extended his hand to be kissed by each kneeling burgher or
      inclined his head in acknowledgment of the curtsey of each
      burgher's lady. The old temptation to be a man even at the
      cost of ceasing to be a prince assailed him again, and with
      unusual violence. Perhaps it was provoked by his nearness
      to the ground ever hallowed in his memory by his transient
      association with her. Five miles away she was, in Flushing.
      So near, so very near. When these festivities were at an
      end, should he take horse and ride to visit her, to see her
      but once again. That was all he asked, all he craved: to
      see her once again. Strengthened by that sight of her, by
      word with her, perhaps, he would return to his duty, his
      yearnings quieted. Thus he deceived himself, not knowing or
      not choosing to admit that the sight of her would be but
      fuel to his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then with startling, appalling suddenness his prayer
      was granted; granted without any need to go five miles,
      five paces, or a single inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared and stared whilst a man might have told a
      Paternoster, not believing his eyes, imagining that he was
      the victim of a delusion thrust upon him by the oppression
      of his desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in blue, he noted; that same Madonna colour which
      she had worn when first he had beheld her, but this was of
      velvet and infinitely richer, as was all her raiment, from
      the horned headdress, whence a long veil floated behind, to
      the peaked shoes of cloth of gold that showed beneath the
      hem of her gown. She was the same and yet not quite the
      same as he had last seen her, three months ago. In the past
      her attire, like her speech and manner, had ever been such
      as would have become a noble maid in the retirement of her
      own home. Now she was arrayed like a lady of the court both
      in costliness of material and modishness of design. . . .
      Yet it was she; and the courtliness of her raiment was
      after all no more than was used by the ladies of these
      opulent burghers when they came to court, no more than was
      to be observed on many another in that considerable
      assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
      With conviction that it was really Johanna and that he was
      not dreaming, a scarlet flame swept across his face to
      leave it paler than it had been, so pale that his great,
      dark eyes seemed to glow and burn. For a moment breath
      almost failed him, his brow was moist, and all the training
      in deportment and self-command deserted him. He felt
      foolish and awkward as any clown, and knew not what to do
      or how to bear himself. And then he became suddenly
      conscious of another familiar face; a florid countenance
      with a great nose and a pair of hazel eyes. It belonged to
      Philip Danvelt; and there was the stocky burgher with head
      thrown back on the short thick neck, grinning broadly at
      him in greeting with a lift of the hand towards him, to let
      others see on what terms of familiarity he stood with this
      great gentleman who was the first among the Duke's
      intimates.
    </p>
    <p>
      That recalled Count Anthony to himself. He smiled his
      acknowledgment of that fulsome greeting, and bowed low from
      the waist to Johanna. A moment later and Rhynsault was
      presenting her to the Duke. Another moment and she passed
      on and was merged with Danvelt into the body of the crowd.
      But the Count's eyes followed her as she moved hither and
      thither in that shifting throng. Actually he had moved a
      step to go after her before he remembered that respect for
      the Duke and his duty kept him rooted where he stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until some hours later, after the great state banquet
      which endured almost interminably, and when the girandoles
      were lighted and the dance was in progress, was opportunity
      afforded him to approach her. It was during the first
      dance, when the Duke, to set the example, had led forth the
      wife of van Koeneck, the Burgomaster of Middelburg, and had
      been followed by all his courtiers and most of the burghers
      present that Count Anthony espied her seated alone near one
      of the tall mullioned windows at the hall's end. He reached
      her side a moment after courtly elegant Messire de Rubempré
      of the Duke's following. She was in the act of declining
      with excuses the courtier's invitation to the dance when
      suddenly Count Anthony surged beside him. Messire de
      Rubempré bowed low and retired without observing the
      deathly pallor overspreading the face which had attracted
      that fastidious courtier, or the tumult of that white bosom
      which he had so much admired.
    </p>
    <p>
      With lowered eyes and fingers locked about the handle of
      her fan of peacock's feathers she sat with the least
      suggestion of crouching in her attitude while Count Anthony
      leaned over her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Johanna!" he murmured, but received no answer. He read
      offence in her attitude, in her averted eyes and her
      obvious agitation. She was in the right to be offended with
      him, and her sudden discovery of his true identity would
      hardly mitigate her feelings. But all would be well once he
      explained, once he told her that this sight of her had
      scattered his last doubt, his last hesitation; that his
      dukedom might go hang unless it would accept her for its
      duchess.
    </p>
    <p>
      What lady in all the land, in all the world, he asked
      himself, could rival her for beauty, for dignity, for
      graciousness, for purity and worth? Hers was a nobility
      deeper than any nobility of birth and blood. It was a
      nobility directly bestowed upon her by her Maker, as
      sometimes happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We must talk, Johanna. I have so much to say to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      One upward glance of her eyes she vouchsafed him, to lower
      them instantly again. But not before he had read scorn and
      pain in them. Her lips smiled a little in sheer bitterness.
      Her voice came steady and cold, and her words reached him
      above the sounds of the music and the shuffle and stamp of
      the dancers' feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What can a Prince of Guelders have to say to a burgher
      woman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was almost hoarse as he answered her: "That which
      will make the burgher woman a princess or else the prince a
      burgher."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again she looked up at him, and if there was still pain in
      her eyes, and still some scorn, it was now the scorn of
      unbelief: but more than either was there sheer amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You go to odd lengths, my lord, in pursuit of your
      amusements."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amusements! God of my life! Am I amused? Look in my eyes,
      Johanna. Read my face. Do you see amusement there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She marked his pallor, the dark stains under his eyes which
      added to their feverish lustre, and something indefinable
      in their glance which allured and terrified and enveloped
      her will.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are mad," she said faintly, seeking to resist the
      spell of his gaze. "Mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have been. Mad with yearning ever since that day the
      Governor's officer carried me away from Flushing. Mad with
      doubts and distractions and balancings. But the sight of
      you has made me sane again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Governor's officer carried you away?" she echoed. It
      was all that she had heard, and it confirmed her first
      assumption. "Against your will, do you mean?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A prisoner virtually, by an excess of zeal on the part of
      the Governor here. He would not allow me to communicate
      with you, not even a letter could I send until he had made
      safe delivery of me some weeks later to the Duke. Then--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, sir? Then?" She was almost stern, and seemed oddly
      composed; no burgher housewife speaking to a prince, but
      just a woman to a man. And her heart was pounding the while
      against her corsage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I wondered if silence were not best." He hung his
      head. He spoke almost in shame. "I wondered if it were not
      best to leave things where they stood; to vanish without
      explanation. There was my cursed station, a duty to the
      Duke which demanded instant labours of me, and a duty to
      the duchy which I was born one day to rule, as was pointed
      out to me in the very hour of my deliverance from the
      Governor's men. I was torn two ways. Between my love of
      you, and all that my birth imposed upon me. I have been so
      torn ever since that day. But I am so torn no longer. The
      struggle is at an end. It never could have ended otherwise
      than this. Sooner or later I must have been as I am now: at
      your feet, Johanna, a very humble suppliant."
    </p>
    <p>
      Something within her seemed to snap. There was in all this
      a cruel irony he could not guess. Limply she sank back in
      her chair, and for an instant her head with its stiff
      headdress lolled sideways on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Johanna! You are ill!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She steadied herself, answering mechanically. "The heat. It
      stifles me."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were within two paces of a door leading to the open.
      He proffered his wrist. "It is but a step to the garden.
      The air there will revive you. Come."
    </p>
    <p>
      Obediently she set her hand upon his wrist, rose and
      permitted him to conduct her from the hall. They went
      unheeded by all but one, and this a person of little
      consequence to either of them: Kuoni von Stocken, the
      Governor's hump-backed Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      In presenting Mistress Johanna that day to the Duke, the
      Sire de Rhynsault had remarked her closely, and afterwards
      had desired his Fool to inform himself concerning her. The
      Fool, who served his master in many capacities, considered
      it a part of his task to observe the lady's deportment at
      this ball, for the sake of the inferences he might draw
      from it. Therefore he hovered near. Deeply intrigued, he
      advanced to put himself in the way of those two as they
      approached the open door. He fell back, however, without
      uttering the quip he had prepared. The lady's deep pallor,
      her faltering step, and Count Anthony's grave, preoccupied
      air, left the Fool stricken with amazement, and profoundly
      curious, staring after them as they passed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went caring little to what extent they might be
      observed: he because he did not yet realise the situation
      in which he stood; she because she realised it but too
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beside him she came out upon the long terrace, and by its
      flight of steps down into the alleys of those spacious
      gardens, now drenched in the light of the August moon,
      where cool evening breezes sighed through tall black
      poplars. Thus leaning upon the arm of this man who to her
      was the man amongst men, this prince who announced himself
      ready either to raise her to his throne or else to fling
      his throne away for love of her, she went and wondered
      could Fate have found for her a more bitter mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because she had not trusted to her instincts, she had come
      to attach faith to the warning of a friar who thought he
      knew the world because he knew its prurience. In that faith
      she had dishonoured herself and had dishonoured Anthony.
      Because of the revulsion and heartbreak that it brought
      her, she had married Philip Danvelt to provide herself with
      a shelter under his roof and name from such onslaughts upon
      her virtue as the one she so shamefully believed she had
      escaped. She had married an honest, kindly man whom she did
      not love, thereby wronging him and wronging herself. And of
      what a measure was her punishment? It lay not merely in the
      knowledge that with trust and patience she would have had
      her heart's desire, but in the realisation, which had been
      with her now for more than half the three weeks that her
      marriage had already endured, that the man she had married
      was a man whom she could never love, a man incapable of
      experiencing love or inspiring it, a man with whom life was
      to be a dull and dreary servitude bereft of all noble
      aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days it had taken her to perceive the magnitude of
      her error, to realise that she would have done infinitely
      better to have sought in a nunnery the shelter she desired
      from the world's evil, and bitterly to regret that she had
      not so sought it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Honest and kindly Danvelt might be, but only as he
      understood honesty and kindliness. He proved, upon the more
      intimate acquaintance of matrimony, gross and boorish, of
      an almost incredible stupidity, and with all the
      self-assertion and overbearing arrogance towards his
      inferiors and dependants that is stupidity's commonest
      expression. He was vain, too, and ostentatious without
      generosity, and, whilst he could deck his wife richly and
      parade her on such occasions as the present with all the
      pride of possession, he had made it plain even in these
      early days that in his own house he would be not merely
      master, but tyrant, and that in all things from the
      slightest to the weightiest his own will must prevail
      unquestioned, and no opinion must ever be set against his
      own. He desired in a wife, not a companion, but a woman to
      bear him children and maintain his house, and to discharge
      both functions precisely in the manner he should decree.
    </p>
    <p>
      She saw the dreary grey life ahead to which she stood
      committed, and alongside of it the life that might have
      been, the life that Anthony was even now offering her,
      still in blissful ignorance of the insurmountable barrier
      that already closed the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She drew a deep breath of the fragrant air of the summer
      night, and allowed it to escape again in a long sigh over
      the grave of withered hopes and forfeited opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Take me back," she said gently; "I am better now. I should
      not have come out here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, wait. There is yet so much to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, but entirely without mirth. "Neither much nor
      little, my lord. All is said. All. Words have been spoken
      that have forged bonds never to be dissolved in life. I am
      the wife of Philip Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the wife . . . the wife of Philip Danvelt? The
      wife?" he repeated the words dully, as if seeking to force
      their meaning upon his reluctant mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He clutched her arm, and instantly let it go again. For a
      long moment there was silence. Then he groaned, "O God!"
      And after another pause asked her with forced calm: "When?
      When did you become that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three weeks ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three weeks ago? Two months after I had left, believing
      that ..." He broke off, and for a spell they stood again in
      utter silence. Ahead of them at the little avenue's end a
      fountain plashed in the moonlight, the water quivering like
      molten silver in the broad stone basin. Behind them the
      tall windows glowed with golden light. Music and gay voices
      came wafted out to them. The scent of roses hung heavy
      about them on the tepid air. It was a moment of mutual
      anguish neither should ever forget.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he spoke quietly, almost coldly in a great dignity:
      "It but remains, madam, to crave your pardon for my
      presumption, for all that I unwarrantably assumed
      concerning you. And yet . . . and yet . . ." His voice
      warmed again, and as he ran on the passion mounted and
      quivered in it, stimulated by the memories he reviewed.
      "And yet that presumption was not unwarranted. I displayed
      it clearly from the very outset; almost from the hour of
      our meeting I let you behold what that meeting meant to me.
      You suffered it; you listened to words whose import could
      leave you in no doubt; you made no attempt to check the
      course of an adoration that was revealed so plainly. Why?
      Had you been my Lady Catharine, to whom I once was
      affianced, or any other lady of a court, I should have held
      the answer. But you are not as those; or, if you are, then
      is there no truth in all the world. Oh, and there were
      other signs. We said things, you and I, for which no words
      were needed. I spoke of it on that last day you rode with
      me. Do you remember?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't!" she begged him, anguish in her voice. "Of your
      pity, say no more."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was pitiless. "I must. I must understand this thing,
      or I shall never understand anything again. I told you then
      of the wordless communion of souls that are in tune, and
      how it was your call that had fetched me out of England,
      back to your side."
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered him now, and answered him by instinct in his
      own language. "You heard it then because you listened for
      it. You might have heard it again at any time from the hour
      you left me until I saw you in Bruges, walking beside the
      litter of the new Duchess, a Knight of the Golden Fleece,
      and was told you were the Prince of Guelders. From that
      moment I called to you no more because, knowing at last who
      you were, I knew that you were not for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He put his hand to his brow. "And you thought ..." He
      checked there, horror in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have guessed my thoughts," she told him sadly; "what
      else was I to think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But did you not reason? Did you not ask yourself why, if I
      were as vile as that, had I not remained in the endeavour
      to complete my--my conquest?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. I asked myself that. I forgot nothing. I found
      the answer in the assumption that something had happened to
      remove you suddenly; something beyond your power to resist,
      perhaps an awakening of conscience in one who was reputed
      of high knightly worth, devout and pure of life."
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of a little pause in which he stood silent,
      miserable, dejected, she touched his arm. "Shall we go in
      now, my lord? My husband will be wondering at my absence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your husband!" he cried. "Danvelt!" He uttered the name
      contemptuously. There was a dull, unreasoning anger in his
      soul. That ape to possess this angel out of Heaven! This
      bright, delicate, almost ethereal girl who would have
      graced a court, to be subject to that boorish dullard. He
      drew her on by the arm, and she suffered it. He possessed
      some power over her to which she would never have opposed
      resistance. There was a semi-circular seat of stone by the
      fountain. To this he led her, and under the suasion of his
      will she seated herself, whilst he sank down beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But to marry!" he protested. "To marry and so suddenly!
      That is what yet I do not understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered him too hastily. "Nor do I, my lord, whilst
      there were nunneries in which I could have the shelter I
      sought from such perils as the one which I conceived that
      you had borne for me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! So! So! It was I, then, who flung you into that . . .
      into his arms? I! And already you were repenting. Already
      you had realised that this marriage--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him. "My lord! My lord! You must not!" She
      attempted to rise. "Take me back to the hall," she implored
      him. "There is no more to say between us. Indeed, already I
      have said more than I thought or intended. I am a wedded
      wife, my lord. I beg that in honour you'll remember it."
    </p>
    <p>
      But his hand upon her arm again kept her seated. She
      interceded in vain. Anguish and passion set him above all
      inculcated lessons. He found a new philosophy to meet the
      case, and voiced it almost fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I remember it only in dishonour. For that is what it
      spells. You are a wedded wife, you say. What has he wed of
      you, this man? Has he wed your love? Has he mated with your
      soul? Is he conscious of a soul himself or aware that there
      is one in you, the greater part of each of us which is not
      to be fettered or constrained? Love, Johanna, is of the
      soul. And you do not love this man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are wrong, my lord. You have no right to say it. I
      love him. I am his wife."
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew this for the feeble protest of her sense of duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not love him, Johanna. Because you love me, and the
      love of a woman for a man, true love, is one and
      indivisible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, let me go. You must not say it!" There was real
      anguish in her voice, as there was in his, though anguish
      of another kind when he made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must not say it. I must not utter truth. Because of a
      contract into which your lips have entered, I am to play
      comedy with you and you with me, and make believe that we
      are each to each as any other man and woman. That is what
      you ask me to believe. But truth is truth, and it must
      prevail above all shams. And love is the greatest truth in
      all the world; it is the force to which all life is due,
      and with life all that is best and noblest in the lives of
      men, a force that nothing mortal can resist, a white-hot
      flame that devours all make-believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It cannot devour my marriage," she answered firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can it not? It could if it were strong enough, true
      enough, if it heeded nothing but itself, as love should."
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose at that, shaking off the spell he seemed to weave
      about her. She stood straight and tense beside him, her
      chin high. And her voice came firm and challenging.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be plain, my lord," she bade him. "You spoke of truth just
      now, and how it must prevail. Let it prevail here, and tell
      me what are you asking me to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The question stunned him. Before that demand for a
      practical expression, the hot vapours of passion were
      dispelled. Reality confronted him and asked a question
      which must be answered by reality. What was he asking her
      to do? What, indeed? It was easy to make phrases about her
      being married but not mated, about the mating of souls to
      which the mating of bodies was but the outward physical
      expression, but, meanwhile, she was fast bound by certain
      legal ties that made her Danvelt's possession, a possession
      undisputable in honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found the answer at last in his romanticism, in his
      idealism, and it had this virtue at least, that it was
      sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What am I asking? Something so vague, impalpable, and
      abstract that the world would mock me for desiring it. The
      love of that part of you which is not given in wedlock to
      Danvelt since that is all that now remains unpossessed.
      Accord me that, hold me in your thought, and I shall not
      grudge him the husk which he believes to be you. I'll go my
      ways, nor trouble you again, who have troubled you so much
      and so clumsily. But I'll go exalted, consecrate to you
      while I have life, your seal upon me, like the twin tulips
      which in honour of you I have taken for my device."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was startled and thrilled by the fall of a tear upon his
      outstretched hand. He bore it to his lips. Her answer
      followed, faltering a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That you may have, because I cannot, if I would, withhold
      it. You shall be ever in my thoughts. As I conceive that
      you would have me be, so shall I seek to mould myself.
      Night and morning you shall have place in my prayers. That
      is all I have to give you . . ." She paused a moment, then
      for the first time spoke his name ..." Anthony."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on his feet beside her, and his voice sank almost to
      a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am content. I would not have you other, for you would
      then be false to my ideal of you. Will you kiss me once,
      Johanna?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lips are in that part of me which Philip possesses,"
      she reminded him gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head in silence, and in silence at last they
      retraced their steps.

      PÉRONNE
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke of Burgundy made a sudden and hurried departure
      from the North as a result of the news that reached him of
      King Louis's movements, and the consequent need for instant
      measures. With a strong force he crossed the frontier and
      advanced to the Somme, the cities of which were providing
      the bone of contention, and he made his headquarters at
      Péronne, whence he could watch his cousin the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now whilst Louis XI would never shirk a fight when no
      alternative offered, or when the issue was beyond doubt,
      yet in the astuteness and caution of his nature there was a
      reluctance to set his fortunes on the hazard of battle if
      the odds were too closely balanced, or if his ends might be
      attained by any other means. His information now showed him
      that already the blow which he meditated had been too long
      delayed. His cousin and brother-in-law Charles, was armed
      to the teeth and backed by a force considerably greater
      than Louis had supposed it possible for him to bring into
      the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Louis reconsidered his position. Here guile might
      serve him better than force. After all, even so rash and
      choleric a man as Charles of Burgundy will yield something
      rather than place all upon the hazard of arms, will pay
      something in order to economise the waste of blood and
      treasure that war inevitably entails. The case, thought
      King Louis, was become one for compromise. Although by
      compromise he might not hope to win all that would accrue
      to him from a victorious war, yet he might win some part of
      it--yielded by the other side to avoid the same bloody
      arbitrament--and let the remainder wait until a more
      favourable opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way to this was rendered easy by the fact that,
      throughout all his preparations for action, he had
      maintained a superficially friendly correspondence with his
      "dear cousin" of Burgundy, calculated to veil the
      circumstance that it was against Burgundy that he was
      arming, and making it appear that it was the necessity to
      impose his sovereign will upon his recalcitrant feudatories
      of Normandy and Brittany which called for the mobilisation
      in which he was engaged. Charles of Burgundy on his side
      had entered into the spirit of the comedy by pretending
      that his own preparations were merely for the purpose of
      keeping his obligations with his allies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the parley desired by King Louis, he determined to be
      his own ambassador, and this despite the alarm and
      opposition which so rash-seeming a resolve spread among his
      officers. There was every ground for it. Charles of
      Burgundy, who appears to have held no man in fear when
      trial by battle was at issue, undoubtedly feared and
      mistrusted his cousin of France in an encounter of any
      other kind. King Louis was a master of arts which remained
      mysterious to the dull wits of the young Duke of Burgundy.
      To the mind of Charles, his cousin Louis appeared as a
      guileful human spider spinning webs of intrigue into which
      the strongest might blunder and find himself entangled. By
      the employment of these very arts, Louis proposed the
      meeting in such terms and with such lofty aims in view that
      it was impossible for Charles, despite all his mistrust of
      the man, to refuse his wishes. The King would come
      unarmed---that is to say, attended by no more than a guard
      of honour--into the Duke's stronghold for the parley,
      trusting to the Duke's word for his personal safety and
      leaving it to the Duke himself to supply him with a
      suitable escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his own hand, Charles wrote him a letter of safe-conduct
      wherein he swore and promised by his faith and on his
      honour that King Louis might come, sojourn, and return in
      surety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Content with this, Louis went boldly into the lion's den.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday, the 9th October, the shabby, untidy,
      mean-looking little king, with his ugly, eager face, rode
      into Péronne accompanied only by his confessor, the Bishop
      of Avranche, the Duke of Bourbon with his brothers the
      Archbishop of Lyons and the Sire de Beaujeu, half a dozen
      other nobles, and eighty archers of his Scottish Guard.
      Within a mile of the town he was met by the Duke and a
      numerous company who had ridden forth to give him welcome
      with every outward sign of submission and respect due to
      his royal station.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present is no history of the long duel between France
      and Burgundy, or even of this passage in it. But a little
      must be said to reveal the part--obscured by historians as
      irrelevant--which La Marche informs us was played by Count
      Anthony of Guelders to save the honour of the Duke of
      Burgundy when it stood in direst peril.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spinning that great web of his for the entanglement of
      Charles, and in inciting foes against him wherever he saw
      the opportunity of doing so, Louis had not lost sight of
      Liège, its grievances for what already it had suffered and
      its fears for what might yet be to come from the resented
      protection which Burgundy had imposed upon it. The King's
      agents had been very active there, representing their royal
      master as the devoted friend of the Liègeois, sharing their
      indignation at the unlawful manner in which they had been
      brought into subjection to Burgundy, and determined to
      assist them in breaking their shackles. Placing their trust
      in these royal promises the Liègeois had gone about their
      preparations for insurrection at the opportune moment when
      the Duke of Burgundy should be fully engaged elsewhere.
      They were strong, resolute, and well-led; and King Louis
      realised the great value to himself of so formidable an
      ally in the Duke's rear when he himself should be engaging
      the Duke's front; whilst they on their side perceived their
      moment to have arrived when Charles and Louis faced each
      other on the Somme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came Louis's change of plans and his decision to
      negotiate instead of fighting. He dispatched a messenger in
      haste to Liège on the eve of setting out to parley with the
      Duke. But the messenger arrived too late. The Liègeois were
      already under arms, and, on the very Sunday that Louis rode
      confidingly into the Burgundian quarters, two thousand of
      them marched on Tongres to seize the person of the
      libertine Prince-Bishop Louis de Bourbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within half-an-hour of his entering Péronne, Louis's
      confidence in his safe-conduct had been abated by
      witnessing the advent there of the Marshal of Burgundy,
      Thibault de Neufchâtel. The marshal had arrived that very
      morning with the lances raised in Burgundy for the campaign
      that was afoot. Having seen to the quartering of these, he
      made his way to the castle, accompanied by a body of nobles
      whose identity awakened in Louis's breast the very gravest
      alarm as he surveyed them from the window of his lodging
      opposite the castle gates. They were gentlemen of France,
      who had fled beyond the reach of Louis's rancour, and who
      had in this hour brought their swords to the Duke of
      Burgundy that thus they might satisfy the now mutual hatred
      and mistrust.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Antoine du Lau, the Seneschal of Guienne, whom
      the King had imprisoned in the fortress of Usson whilst an
      iron cage was building for him, in which, unable either to
      stand or lie, and deprived of every ray of light, he should
      linger out a tortured remnant of his days. Du Lau had
      escaped in time with the connivance of his keepers, who had
      paid terribly for his evasion. At Dijon he had found
      shelter and service with the Duke of Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was Poncet de la Rivière, who had been removed from
      his command in the royal army, after rendering stout
      service at Montlhéry. La Rivière had departed France on a
      pilgrimage to the Holy Land, from which he had been careful
      not to return until now, in arms and bearing on his surcoat
      the cross of Saint Andrew, the badge of Burgundian service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most ominous of all, because of the dreadful precedent it
      established against King Louis, there was Philippe de
      Bresse, with his brothers the Count of Romont and the
      Bishop of Geneva, all three Princes of Savoy. De Bresse had
      once gone as a mediator to Louis XI under the guaranty of a
      safe-conduct from the King, in despite and dishonour of
      which the King had flung him into the Castle of Loches, and
      kept him there in a rigorous and long confinement, from
      which at last he had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there were others, a round dozen of them, whom the King
      recognised as fugitives from his anger and declared enemies
      of his person.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never a man of high physical courage, the lean-shanked
      little king felt himself go cold with fear as he looked
      down upon the members of that little troop, and as they
      looked up and met his shifty glance. It never crossed his
      mind that his presence there at Péronne struck the same
      fear into them that their arrival begot in him.
      Apprehensive of some arrangement between France and
      Burgundy, they hastened to the Duke, Philippe de Bresse at
      their head, to obtain of him security for their persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing nothing of this, already regretting that he had not
      given heed to those who had stigmatised as rash and
      harebrained this visit to Péronne, the King stroked his
      long pendulous nose and sucked in his shuddering lips. It
      did not take him long to conclude that if ever he had stood
      in danger of having his throat cut it was now. No
      safe-conduct would guard him against the Count de Bresse,
      whose safe-conduct he himself had once violated, or against
      du Lau and his horror of that iron cage. And if one of
      these were to pay off that old score, how easy for the Duke
      of Burgundy to save his honour by asserting that the King
      had fallen victim to a private vengeance. There might even
      be a scapegoat. King Louis judged, as we all do, his
      neighbour by himself. And how convenient for the Duke of
      Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held a hasty conference with his confessor and with
      Beaujeu, as a result of which, for his greater safety, and
      so that the Duke might be more immediately responsible for
      it, he petitioned Charles to remove him from his present
      lodging and afford him quarters in the castle itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke acceded promptly, having first pointed out that
      the Castle of Péronne, being a fortress rather that a
      dwelling, afforded no proper housing for a king. The King,
      however, less concerned with personal comforts than with
      personal safety, removed himself at once, and within the
      grim walls of the castle may have felt less apprehensive.
      But not for long. On the morrow he had every reason to
      suppose that his last hour was at hand. For news of the
      insurrection and violent action of the Liègeois reached
      Péronne. King Louis's incitement of them was not to be
      doubted. Indeed, there was proof of it. The facts
      themselves were bad enough. But they were rendered
      infinitely worse by the gross tongue of rumour. The story
      of wholesale slaughter, brought to the Duke at Péronne by
      one who claimed to have been an eye-witness of the events,
      stated that the Prince-Bishop, the Papal Legate, Onofrio di
      Santa Croce, and Charles's Burgundian Lieutenant, the Sire
      de Humbercourt, had all been murdered. The same witness and
      others who accompanied him swore solemnly that amongst the
      leaders of the rebels they had seen certain agents of the
      King of France whom they mentioned definitely by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consternation and furious resentment spread within the
      castle and town of Péronne. The Duke in his anger swore
      that the King of France had come thither to abuse him. It
      did not help him that he could not perceive precisely how
      the King was to achieve this object. He never could
      perceive the aims of that sly, subtle monarch.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ordered the drawbridge to be taken up and the gates of
      the town to be closed, and he placed the King--who was now
      terrified by a justifiable expectation of the worst--under
      a guard of archers, whilst he deliberated upon what
      measures should be taken. These deliberations he chose to
      make alone with Count Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a small, bleak chamber of that cheerless fortress,
      Charles gave tongue at once to his fury and his fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He has come hither to betray me," he swore repeatedly,
      summarising all that he had said. "I felt it in my bones
      when he proposed the meeting. I did all that was possible
      to oppose it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony asked a question calculated to summon reason
      to the Duke's aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If his aim had been betrayal, why should he have come
      hither to place himself in your power?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If? Do you say 'If'?' Livid with passion, his strong jaws
      clenched, the Duke glared at his cousin. "What else has he
      done but betray me? You have heard the tale; you have heard
      how the wires were pulled at Liège by his agents, with the
      result that an army is on foot there, and these gentlemen
      of mine have been damnably butchered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He may have done all that, or at least be a party to it
      all. But how, being here, can he work harm against you
      now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I knew, if I could guess, I should be less uneasy. But
      there is one way to make sure of him." And the Duke drew
      the half of his dagger from its sheath, and shot it home
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony, seated on the deep stone sill of one of the
      arched windows, cross-legged and nursing his knee in his
      locked hands, gravely shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not that way, Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What better way?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony's answer was indirect. "His life and person
      are sacred in your hands. Your honour demands it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My honour? And does not my honour, my very duty, demand
      that I avenge the butchery of Bourbon of Humbercourt and
      the Papal Legate? To what end else am I justiciary in these
      dominions? This knavish king shall be paid in the same
      murderous coin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not by you, Charles. There is your safe-conduct to
      him. Remember the terms of it. You have pledged your faith
      and your honour for his surety whilst here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I foresee this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unfortunately not. But the pledge is given. No
      circumstances can relieve you of it. You dare not dishonour
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dare not! God of my life! Is there anything I do not dare?
      What man dares, I dare."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What gentleman dares," the Count corrected him. "And no
      gentleman dare be false to his pledged word. Would you have
      it said of you in the world that the Duke of Burgundy lured
      the King of France to a parley under a safe-conduct, and
      then murdered him? The deed would be remembered long after
      the provocation was forgotten, and your name would be
      execrated for all time."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way, and by opposing a calm firmness to the Duke's
      heat, he restrained Charles from any immediate measures of
      reprisal such as he might certainly have taken had he been
      left to the counsels of his rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the morrow the battle had to be fought all over
      again. Early in the morning the Duke summoned a council of
      his nobles and officers including those who had been
      subjects of the King of France, and who because of present
      rancour were come to offer their swords to Burgundy. That
      council lasted all day and well into the night, for the
      arguments were long and fierce. They might have been less
      protracted but for certain measures taken even in his
      extremity by the crafty, ever-watchful Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virtually a prisoner though he might be, yet it was sought
      to dissemble the fact by permitting certain of his
      attendants to come and go freely in the performance of
      their duties by him. Informed through these of what was
      taking place, alive to his danger, and realising that
      perhaps his very life might hang upon the deliberation of
      the council that was about to sit, he set himself to employ
      as best he could that most choice of all the weapons in his
      armoury of guile, and one whose value he had frequently
      tested: corruption. Using those same few friends as his
      ambassadors, he made lavish promises here and there until
      he had committed himself to the extent of some fifteen
      thousand crowns. If he was mean and parsimonious as a rule,
      he could also be lavish upon occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four voices prevailed in that council. First, that which
      urged that the safe-conduct protected the King and made it
      impossible to move in any way against his person. Second,
      that which urged that he be imprisoned and made to answer
      for the sedition he had stirred up in Liège and the blood
      that had been shed there as a consequence. Third, that
      which advised that he be deposed and his brother the Duke
      of Normandy invited to come and discuss the terms of peace
      with France. And lastly, the fierce, insistent voice which
      demanded blood for blood. This was the voice of those who
      had gone in personal fear of him for years, and saw no
      truce to their fears whilst he continued alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not easy to silence these last, comparatively few
      though they might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did one urge the safe-conduct which made such an act of
      violence unthinkable, there was Philippe de Bresse to
      remind them, out of the common knowledge and his own
      particular experience, that a safe-conduct formerly had not
      made an act of violence unthinkable to Louis himself. Did
      another urge clemency and the laws of humanity, there was
      du Lau on his feet to inquire when clemency or laws of
      humanity had prevailed with a king who put gentlemen to the
      slow and painful death that came of being cramped in cages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony, seated on the Duke's immediate right, had
      taken some part in the debate to defend the position that
      the safe-conduct made action against the King's person
      impossible. And when Philippe de Bresse appeared to have
      silenced that argument by putting forward the precedent in
      such cases which Louis himself had established, Count
      Anthony's was the only voice that answered him, and in
      answering him restored at least in part the position which
      de Bresse had sapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The precedent is less sound than it appears, because there
      is no true parallel between the situations. The King of
      France was dealing with a subject who, in his eyes, and in
      the eyes of the law of France, was guilty of treason and
      had therefore forfeited all consideration."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A safe-conduct is a safe-conduct," de Bresse had answered
      him violently. "You talk like a lawyer, Lord Count, and you
      quote legal codes. But for gentlemen there is a higher
      code: the code of chivalry and of honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, sir, for the reminder," said Count Anthony
      tartly. "And since you appeal to the code of honour, I
      shall answer you from that code, which is all against your
      demands. No offence committed against a man can tarnish his
      own honour, but only those offences which he, himself,
      commits against others. We are concerned here, not with the
      honour of the King of France, which may be tarnished, but
      with the honour of the Duke of Burgundy, which so far is
      clear. Do you, sir, do any of you, invite him to stain it
      by such an act as that for which any court of honour must
      brand the King of France with infamy? Must I descend to
      become a rogue so as to punish my neighbour for being one?
      In honour, sirs, as you well know, it is better to let the
      offending neighbour go unpunished, at least until such time
      as he may be punished without dishonour to ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much seems plain enough," the Duke grumbled with sour
      reluctance, and so silenced any further insistence from de
      Bresse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It comes then to this," sneered du Lau, "that we are to
      quit ourselves like gentlemen in dealing with a knave."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Each of us quits himself according to his nature," Count
      Anthony answered in his passionless voice. "It is perhaps
      fortunate for King Louis that he is a knave and that we are
      gentlemen. But it is fortunate in this instance only."
    </p>
    <p>
      At long last, when the day had given place to night, a
      resolve was reached which appeared to express the desire of
      the majority: to depose the King and send for the Duke of
      Normandy. On that resolve, the council at last dissolved,
      and the Duke summoned his secretaries to prepare the
      letters he was to send to the King's brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      News of the decision reached the King in his chamber. It
      would have dismayed any other in his place; him it almost
      elated in that it removed the worst danger he had
      apprehended, that of having his throat cut. They might
      depose him all they pleased. As long as he lived and
      recovered his liberty, they would have to reckon with him
      in the end. He had, with reason, unbounded faith in his own
      wits.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the end was not yet as the council had decreed. Whilst
      the Duke strode to and fro dictating, and his secretary's
      quill scratched and spluttered over the parchment, back
      came Count Anthony, who had departed with the others. The
      Duke flushed angrily at sight of him, sensing here a fresh
      opposition to the comparatively mild measure upon which he
      had determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles, dismiss your secretary and hear me. I have
      something to propose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is aught concerning the King of France, you are
      behind the fair. My messenger is already in the saddle and
      but awaits this letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let him await it a little longer; until you have heard me.
      What I have to say touches your honour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My honour! Death of God! Who made you guardian of my
      honour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No one made me guardian of it. But out of love for you I
      presume to be its counsellor. Dismiss your secretary.
      You'll regret it all the days of your life if you refuse to
      hear me now. For I have found a better way than yours to
      settle this score with the King."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke scowled sulkily at his cousin, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear me at least," the Count insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke waved the secretary away.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be brief," he commanded, as the door closed upon the
      departing scribe. "Time presses."
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was no haste about Count Anthony. He was as
      deliberate as he was calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "First, Charles, you cannot do this thing. Nay, hear me
      out. If you'll remember what I said to de Bresse, you'll
      spare me and yourself the tedium of repetition. Those
      arguments of honour are unanswerable. The King has your
      safe-conduct and, in the hour in which it ceases to protect
      him, in that hour you will have been pulled down to the
      King's own paltry, knavish level. Men will say of you, as
      they say already of King Louis, that your honour is a
      bubble upon which no reliance can be placed, your pledge a
      mere word as easily given as retracted. You are a great
      prince, Charles, and you are bound by the obligations of
      your lofty station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you for the sermon. But it has been preached
      already, ay, and answered."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has it been truly answered? Is it all false? Are you not a
      great prince? Is your honour tarnished or tarnishable? Is
      your word worthless?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Devil take you! You know that none of this is so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, why make it so? For that is the only lasting thing
      these letters will achieve. They may bring you a momentary
      satisfaction--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "They do not," the Duke interrupted, in exasperation. "God
      knows they do not."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony smiled almost compassionately. "Not even so
      little as that? Then why persist?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke pondered him sullenly out of weary, blood-injected
      eyes. "You hinted an alternative," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, yes. But first it would have pleased me to turn you
      from the decision taken; to make you realise its folly.
      Were I in your place--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give thanks to God that you are not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "--Were I in your place, I would make the King sup on his
      treachery, make him eat it under the eyes of all the world,
      so that whatever followed all decent men should point the
      finger of scorn at him. I would do this after first making
      terms of peace--the pretended purpose of his visit here.
      And in the present circumstances, cowed as he is by the
      fear of his deserts, you may have whatever terms you choose
      to dictate, short of the crown of France itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Saint George!" the Duke's eyes gleamed. "That had
      escaped me, as it seems to have escaped those furious
      counsellors of mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You all wandered so far down a by-path that you lost all
      memory of the highroad and the journey to be made upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke nodded. "But the other measure: to make the King
      eat his treachery, as you say? Be plain on that."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony considered him a moment in silence. Then he
      took him familiarly by the arm. "Come with me to the King,
      Charles."
    </p>
    <p>
      Angrily the Duke wrenched his arm away. "Not I, by Saint
      George! I will not meet the rogue. I cannot trust myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, you can. Though you despise the man, you
      reverence the office. That will suffice. The rest you can
      leave to me. Let me be your mouthpiece in the interview,
      and I promise you a solution, a triumphant solution, of all
      your difficulties."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! You promise? But if you do not perform?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You need be bound by nothing that I do. Repudiate me if I
      seem to fail you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke stroked his chin. "How will you go about it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Count took his arm. "Come with me to the King,
      Charles, and you shall see."
    </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly, leaden-footed, the Duke allowed himself to be
      conducted.

      CHECKMATE
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      In a small stone chamber, vaulted and cheerless, sparsely
      furnished, the hearth cold and empty and the square window
      barred like a prison's, sat the King of France, and a less
      kingly figure you will seek in vain down the galleries of
      history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis XI was then in his forty-fifth year, and looked
      older. Of middle height, he was delicate of frame, with
      spare limbs and bony hands. He was of a mean and
      commonplace ugliness of countenance, his nose
      disproportionately large and pendulous, his lips coarse and
      sensual. But the craft of the man was advertised in his
      high cheek-bones, his depth of brow, and his quick eyes,
      small and bright as a weasel's. He was dressed like a
      shopkeeper, in cheap garments untidily assumed, and his
      ill-fitting black hose hung in wrinkles about his lean
      shanks. For warmth he was wrapped in a coarse grey cloak
      such as a pilgrim might have worn. The rim of his round
      hat, which was thrust down over his brows, was adorned with
      a half-dozen little leaden images of saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was alone with his confessor, the Cardinal Balue, who
      sat apart, a majestic scarlet figure, deeply immersed in
      his breviary so as not to disturb his master at his
      devotions. For the King was praying. Seated at the plain
      brown table, on which the great silver candle-branch seemed
      almost out of place, and resting his elbow on the board,
      his Majesty of France was industriously telling his beads.
      The hiss of his fervently whispered Aves was the only sound
      in the stillness of the chamber. There was need for prayer
      and for fervency. The omens could not have been more
      terrifying. In the tower to be reached by a door from the
      adjacent chamber, where the King's bed was made, another
      King of France, Charles the Simple, had been held in
      durance and finally murdered, by another rebellious vassal,
      the Count of Vermandois. As things were falling out, it
      began to appear to the King that there was considerable
      danger that the coincidence might be completed and that
      Louis the Astute might share the fate of Charles the
      Simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knock fell upon the door. The King jumped and sucked in
      his breath. His nerves were in execrable case.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal closed his breviary on his forefinger. It was
      a volume in a rich binding of red velvet encrusted with
      precious stones. He looked across at the King with solemn
      inquiry. The King stared back at him a moment, eyes scared
      in his sallow face, then nodded, and pouched his beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Cardinal rose, and moved with slow majesty, his cloak
      of scarlet silk trailing along the ground as he crossed to
      open. He stepped out of the chamber, to return a moment
      later with the announcement that the Duke himself,
      accompanied by Count Anthony of Guelders, begged an
      audience of the King's highness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The keen, eager eyes of the King flickered at the
      announcement, and a measure of relieved surprise showed in
      his face. If Count Anthony of Guelders was in this, his
      case must be far from hopeless. Count Anthony, that mirror
      of chivalry and pattern of honour, did not deal in murder
      or baseness of any kind. He rose, as he desired the
      Cardinal to admit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      First came a groom of the chamber bearing a great gilded
      candle-branch of a dozen candles, whose golden light
      suffused the bleak room almost with a sense of warmth. When
      he had gone out again backwards and bent almost double in
      homage to the Majesty of France, the Duke entered, followed
      closely by his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count had rightly judged in saying that, whilst the
      Duke might despise the man, he would reverence the office.
      In the presence now of the King, Charles of Burgundy,
      although sullen of face, would have bent his knee in formal
      homage but that Louis, springing forward, prevented him by
      seizing his elbows and upholding him. Almost they appeared
      to embrace as they stood thus for a moment. Then the King
      spoke in his thin and now rather quavering voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair cousin, this is to honour me. And you, my Lord Count,
      I bid you welcome." He removed a hand from the Duke's
      sleeve of rich black velvet, to extend it to Count Anthony,
      who dutifully kissed it whilst he bent his knee. "You find
      me in deep distress," he ran on, "at the events which have
      come to trouble the harmony I had hoped should prevail
      between us here. It was that hope, that confident hope,
      which made me anxious to come in person to adjust our
      differences under the surety of your safe-conduct."
    </p>
    <p>
      His keen eyes were on the Duke's heavy, sullen countenance
      whilst he issued what he considered an urgently necessary
      reminder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke began to rumble an answer. "Monseigneur, but for
      that safe-conduct--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The King interrupted him, becoming suddenly very royal.
      "Will not your Highness sit? Thus we shall be more at our
      ease to talk." He waved him to a chair by the table. "And
      you. Lord Count ..." He waved again, and the Cardinal who
      stood by the third and last chair in that meanly furnished
      chamber, would have made haste to offer it to Count Anthony
      but that the latter stayed him in the act.
    </p>
    <p>
      The King, who retained his hat, resumed the chair from
      which he had risen; the Duke took another, facing the King
      beyond the board, whilst Count Anthony, a tall, vivid
      figure in a crimson houppelande that reached to his ankles,
      stood at the table's head. The Cardinal, in his scarlet
      robes, glowed and smouldered among the shadows in the
      background.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fearing imprudences from the Duke, Count Anthony made haste
      to assume the spokesmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sire, his Highness has ventured to intrude upon you in the
      hope that it may be your good pleasure to fulfil now the
      purpose of your gracious visit to Péronne."
    </p>
    <p>
      His tone and words were of the utmost deference. So much
      indeed, that they made the alert King suspicious of their
      ultimate intention. Why so smooth, he wondered, when he,
      who knew the Duke's temper, had expected roughness and
      upbraidings? The only antidote to his quick suspicions lay
      in the fact that it was Count Anthony of Guelders--whose
      ways were gentle knightly ways--who spoke now for the Duke.
      Smoothness in such a man could not be the natural cloak of
      guile.
    </p>
    <p>
      He licked his coarse lips, and his quick little eyes
      flashed from one to the other of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, this is good hearing," said he. "Excellent hearing. I
      had feared that the discussion of terms might have been
      indefinitely postponed by these unfortunate events
      which--which--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he fumbled for euphemistic expressions, the Duke cut
      in harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There was good reason for your fears, monseigneur. These
      events cry out for satisfaction."
    </p>
    <p>
      The King gulped, and his apprehensions mounted again.
      Things were not, then, to run the unnaturally smooth course
      which Count Anthony's opening words had seemed to promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These events, my lord," he ventured, "believe me, no man
      could deplore more deeply then I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke laughed. The King jumped visibly at the sound,
      which was far from pleasant, and he momentarily covered his
      mouth with a hand which seemed to be all knuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As God lives," said the Duke, still with that snarling
      laugh of his, "you have good reason to deplore them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony brought him sharply to the reminder that the
      matter had been entrusted to his hands. "By your leave,
      Charles!" His glance said more than his words, and it was
      not lost on the watchful monarch. "The King's reasons may
      not be as you suppose them." With the former gracious
      deference he turned to the King again. "You perceive, sire,
      that an obstacle exists to the calm discussion of any terms
      of peace between France and Burgundy, however deeply
      desired by both. But if I have brought the Duke here to
      consider them with you, monseigneur, it is in the very
      confident hope that, in spite of the circumstantial reports
      his Highness has received, you will, yourself, sire, be
      able to remove the obstacle."
    </p>
    <p>
      The King considered. "God and Our Lady know I have the
      will. As for the ability . . . Will your lordship tell me
      the extent of these reports? I know that it is said the
      Prince-Bishop has been murdered, and with him the
      Burgundian Lieutenant and the Papal Legate. That may be
      true. It is not at all surprising. The people of Liège have
      never shown any love for Louis of Bourbon. Also it is well
      known that they did not willingly submit to the Burgundian
      yoke which was imposed upon them. People do not always
      understand what may be ultimately for their own good, and
      the illusion which they call liberty commonly leads to
      extravagant excesses. Knowing the Duke of Burgundy engaged
      upon my frontiers, it is not surprising that they should
      have deemed the occasion opportune for the revolt they will
      have been meditating ever since they were brought into
      Burgundian subjection. I conceive and understand my
      cousin's indignation. I share it even. But for what am I in
      all this? How is it reported, how assumed, that I am
      concerned in events in distant Liège?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not assumed," the Duke rasped. "There is evidence of
      it. We know now of the activity in Liège for months past,
      of your agents. Officers of your own, soldiers of
      experience, such as Fremont de Marie, des Aubus, du Breuil,
      and Grandmaison were seen to be leading the
      insurrectionaries."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who says so?" snapped the King.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My messengers, gentlemen of my own who have ridden in from
      Liège. Shall I send for them to tell you, themselves, sire,
      what they witnessed?" The Duke half-rose as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony cut in smoothly. "But where is the need for
      that? The King himself is here, and can speak to it. His
      royal word on this or any other subject cannot be held in
      doubt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus smoothly Count Anthony opened for the King as a door
      of escape, the door of falsehood. And the King, for all his
      astuteness, never dreaming whither that door would lead
      him, bolted through it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, Lord Count," he said, with a great show of
      dignity, "for hesitating to believe that the King of France
      is a knave. I shall hope to remember it to your advantage,
      my lord, if ever it should be my good fortune to have
      occasion to do so. As for these men of mine who are
      implicated, three of them are men of mine no longer; they
      ceased to be men of mine in the course of the last
      half-year. Possibly they saw greater profit to themselves
      in entering the service of the people of Liège. As for the
      fourth, Grandmaison, he is to the best of my belief in
      Paris at this moment. So that in respect of him, at least,
      your report is inaccurate. If inaccurate in respect of him,
      why should it be accurate in respect of the others, even if
      they were men of mine, which I say again they are not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have not proved it, sire," said the Duke
      uncompromisingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monseigneur!" The King flushed angrily at the implied
      doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Charles of Burgundy went relentlessly on to make his
      point. "You have not proved that when they ceased to be men
      of yours as you say, that when they exchanged your service
      for that of the people of Liège, they did not do so with
      your approval, by your instructions and for the very
      purpose which they now have served."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles, Charles!" Count Anthony admonished him, one hand
      upheld in warning. "His Highness has indeed proved it by
      stating the contrary upon his kingly word. Or, if the
      statement as it stands is insufficient, he will, I am sure
      graciously condescend to amplify it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do," the King assented quickly. "When those men quitted
      my service, I had no knowledge of, or concern in, their
      intentions. I disavow them entirely in whatever they may
      have done in Liège."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear, Charles!" cried Count Anthony, in a tone of one
      who says, "What did I tell you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear," said the Duke with a sneer.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Count had not yet done. He meant to truss the
      knavish king inextricably in his own falsehoods.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It only remains, sire, completely to disabuse the mind of
      his Highness by informing him with your own lips of what I
      am persuaded must be true: that not by the hands of the men
      named, or by any other hands, or in any way have you had
      part or share in the insurrection at Liège and the massacre
      that has taken place there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhesitatingly the King answered with the full lie
      required: "I do so inform him. I am as innocent as he is
      himself of any part in the business at Liège. I give you my
      royal word for that, and those who say otherwise are lying
      enemies of mine who have ends of their own to serve. Is
      that enough?" His eyes darted from one to the other of
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony fetched a deep sigh. "More than enough for
      me, who could never have supposed a king's honour to have
      permitted such knavery as a breach of the treaties existing
      between France and Burgundy. But as you say, sire, you have
      enemies, and they have poured their poison into the ear of
      your cousin. Look at him, sire. Read the unbelief in his
      countenance."
    </p>
    <p>
      The King looked as he was bidden into that heavy, sneering
      face, and his soul quaked again within him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If, monseigneur, you could afford him evidence of what you
      say," the Count suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evidence? What evidence have I?" Louis got to his feet,
      and affected dignity again. "What better evidence than my
      kingly word?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What better, indeed! And yet you see, monseigneur, what a
      barrier this thing must present to any discussion of the
      terms of peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      The King saw that, and more. He saw the danger in which his
      own neck stood, which was more to him at the moment that
      the danger to the treaty. He began to fear that he had
      perjured himself in vain. And then the Count came again to
      his assistance, opening yet another door, but this time one
      through which he must pass without any eagerness: the door,
      to which the earlier lies of which he had so insidiously
      been led to avail himself had naturally brought him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It occurs to me that you said earlier, sire, that you
      share the Duke's indignation at the affair of Liège."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did say so," the King protested eagerly, "and I say so
      again. I do share his indignation, and I abhor the action
      of the Liègeois."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" Count Anthony's face lighted. His next words
      surprised both the King and the Duke, for it showed them
      both into what a trap he had manoeuvred the crafty Louis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I rejoice from my heart to hear you, monseigneur. For of
      this, at least, you will have no difficulty in giving a
      proof that will satisfy not only his Highness but all the
      world. And in proving this, you prove the rest. All doubt
      will be dispelled. Signify this indignation and abhorrence
      which you feel so deeply by joining hands with the Duke in
      punishing the insurrection. Bring up a portion of your
      forces, and with them, in alliance and in company with the
      Duke, march to the investment of Liège and lend your aid
      and your countenance in compelling the Liègeois to return
      to their allegiance to his Highness. Consent to that, sire,
      and you give the lie to all your defamers here. Further,
      you will have removed the last obstacle to the discussion
      of the peace between Burgundy and France."
    </p>
    <p>
      Livid, the King stood and looked at Count Anthony: and if
      ever hatred looked out of mortal eyes it looked then out of
      his. He was trapped, caught, tangled in his own mendacity
      beyond all possibility of extrication. He must do as was
      required of him or else brand himself a perjured liar.
      Indeed, if he refused, it would be tantamount now to
      admitting his guilt in the matter of Liège and justifying
      any course they chose to take with him, any violence they
      might offer. If he accepted, if he agreed to move upon
      Liège in alliance with Charles of Burgundy, and there
      employ his own hand in striking down those who had trusted
      to him, those whom his blandishments and promises of
      support had lured to revolt, his name would stink perhaps
      for ever in the nostrils of all decent men. Yet there was
      no choice. It was checkmate. Whether he refused or
      accepted, he was bankrupted of honour; whilst if he refused
      he forfeited his life as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head. He spoke very quietly. "Yes," he
      assented. "I will do that to prove my good faith." And he
      sank limply down into his chair again, nor observed the
      broad grin upon the Duke's face. "I will go with you most
      gladly, my dear cousin."
    </p>
    <p>
      The terms of the treaty of peace were soon agreed. The King
      was in no condition after that for any finesse. Badly
      defeated upon his own ground of craft, the strength of his
      mind was temporarily exhausted, and Burgundy obtained from
      him all the sureties she required to conclude a peace
      satisfactory to herself. To observe that treaty both
      parties bound themselves by an oath sworn at the King's
      suggestion on a piece of the True Cross which he fetched
      for the purpose from the coffer in his bedchamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until they were back in the Duke's apartments did a
      word on the matter pass between the cousins. Then the Duke
      standing before the Count, with gleaming eyes and a faint
      flush on his cheek-bones, expressed himself at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save me from poets when they apply their wits to other
      things than rhyming!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what do you complain?" wondered Count Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of nothing, Anthony. The Count of Vermandois went down to
      infamy for merely murdering Charles the Simple within these
      walls. King Louis has lost more than life this evening. His
      honour is tarnished beyond all redemption, whilst mine will
      shine with greater lustre in that against heavy temptation
      I have honoured my safe-conduct. I thank you for it. But I
      would sooner have you for my friend than for my enemy. That
      is why I say God preserve me from strife with men of
      romantic minds."
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning the bells rang in Péronne and a <i>Te Deum</i>
      was sung in thanksgiving for the peace now signed between
      France and Burgundy.
    </p>
    <p>
      And that was not yet the end. For presently came tidings
      from Liège to inform the Duke of Burgundy that the first
      messages had been grossly exaggerated. True, there was
      insurrection; true, two thousand Liègeois had marched on
      Tongres to impose their rebellious will upon the
      Prince-Bishop. But not Louis de Bourbon, or the Burgundian
      Lieutenant, or the Papal Legate had suffered any hurt
      whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles of Burgundy was aghast at the thought of how this
      news might have come too late to prevent a step that would
      have left his honour shattered for all time. It was to
      Count Anthony that he expressed his deep and abiding
      gratitude for the greatest service ever rendered him by
      living man, and he expressed it with a profuseness
      extremely unusual in so dour a prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony heard him through with a gentle smile on his
      countenance which of late had grown so wistful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wonder do you perceive even now on the edge of what a
      precipice you stood," he said. "Who were the bearers of
      that rumour of wholesale assassination? Your own people.
      Would it afterwards have been believed that any rumour had
      existed? Would not the charitable world have assumed that
      you had manufactured the rumour as a pretext to destroy a
      king who had placed himself in your power? What of your
      honour then, Charles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles gasped and shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony continued to smile, a curious, introspective
      smile from eyes that seemed blind to their immediate
      physical surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," he said quietly. "I think I have done well by you,
      Charles, and well by myself, too." He was thinking of
      Johanna, and of how she must commend the manner in which he
      had saved the honour of the Duke of Burgundy could she have
      been a witness of it; and it brought him a satisfaction and
      a sense of peace to reflect that her approval would have
      been earned. That was now the guide of all his actions.

    <h1>
      THE SEDITION IN WALCHEREN
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposition to the new taxes imposed as a war levy upon the
      Northern provinces had begun to manifest itself in
      Walcheren early in October, a bare two months after the
      Duke's departure thence at the end of his magnificent
      progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a few sporadic insurrections here and there
      which might have led to serious trouble if the Duke had
      been represented in Zealand by a man less vigorous and
      resourceful than the Sire Claude de Rhynsault. Vigilant and
      prompt, the Governor was ever at hand to stamp out the
      first sparks of revolt before they could spread and unite
      to form a dangerous conflagration. By fines, pilloryings,
      and a few hangings, Rhynsault effectively discouraged the
      rebels, who in the main belonged to the poorer class,
      against whom the increase in price of the necessities of
      life operated most oppressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      When, however, the news of the great insurrection at Liège,
      spreading like a wave over the land, reached Zealand, and
      reached it in so exaggerated a form that it was assumed the
      Duke of Burgundy was likely to be in difficulties, others,
      who hitherto had looked on in resentment at the tyranny and
      cruelty of the ducal lieutenant, turned their attention to
      measures which, if they were not to result in casting off
      the Burgundian yoke should at least achieve an easing of
      its pressure. Among these were some of the wealthier
      merchants of Middleburg, Flushing, Veere, and Arnemuiden;
      men of weight and consequence in the guilds, who could sway
      the opinions of considerable multitudes and could supply
      the means to arm them. They went to work, not in the
      clumsy, impetuous fashion of the earlier mutineers, but
      with thought and plan and secrecy, careful to complete
      their preparations before they revealed their strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The force at the command of the Governor of Zealand was,
      after all, not very considerable. Its overthrow by a
      carefully organised attack should be comparatively easy.
      And once that preliminary victory were achieved, its moral
      consequence must be a general rising throughout Zealand,
      which most probably would be followed by a rising
      throughout the Northern States, Holland, Friesland, and the
      rest in which the oppression of the new taxes had bred
      discontent. Once this were accomplished, the Burgundian
      dominion might be cast off, or else adapted to the needs
      and conveniences of the burghers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruling spirit of the conspiracy was a knight of
      Walcheren, a member of a prominent noble Zealand family
      named van Borselen, and his castle in the neighbourhood of
      Arnemuiden, where he kept some state and considerable
      force, was the meeting-place of the chief plotters.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these comings and goings of burgher traders, however
      carefully contrived, did not escape the notice of the
      vigilant Rhynsault. He posed concerning it a question to
      his Fool, Kuoni von Stocken, who was the only man who
      possessed his confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is van Borselen buying tapestries or wine or ships, do you
      suppose? Or is he engaged in bringing wool from England for
      the Flemish looms?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The crooked-backed Fool looked at his master, his beady
      eyes steady and expressionless in the yellow, evil mask of
      his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's hemp he lacks, I think," he snapped, and drew a grin
      to the Governor's florid countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, he should come to me for that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He should. But since he doesn't, I'ld go to him were I
      you. You can supply him all the hemp he needs, and perhaps
      a trifle over."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Fool's advice Rhynsault set out. A fool Kuoni might
      be, to provoke guffaws from the Burgundian lieutenant who
      employed him. But through this gross-witted Burgundian
      lieutenant he enjoyed vicariously power and many other
      things denied to his mean station and his mean, shrunken
      frame. Rhynsault might deem himself Governor of Zealand.
      The truth was that he provided no more than the body of
      that exalted functionary. That body's soul and brain and
      ruling spirit were supplied by Kuoni, who was aware of it
      and secretly exulted behind that expressionless, sickly
      face, and those eyes whose stare, seemingly fixed and
      unblinking, had the power to make men shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault commanded a hundred lances to attend him. The
      Fool cut the number down by half.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fifty will be all you'll need for the business. A hundred
      would scare him into taking up the drawbridge, and you'd
      have a siege on your hands which would land you in
      difficulties. You are on a tour of inspection, and you
      crave van Borselen's hospitality for a night. That he may
      suspect you of seeking nothing further, you will stay first
      a night at Veere with van Ertvelde, whom no man suspects of
      anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By God, that's shrewd!" Rhynsault approved him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shrewd? It's obvious," sneered the Fool, who, with a soul
      filled with contempt of all things concrete and abstract,
      despised nothing in the world so much as his master the
      Governor of Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Kuoni directed, they set out and went about the
      business. The unsuspecting van Borselen admitted them to
      his castle with the honours proper to the representative of
      the Duke of Burgundy. A goodly supper was served to a round
      dozen neighbouring gentlemen invited for the occasion, and
      they drank deep, as was the custom in the Netherlands.
      After supper van Borselen desired a song from the
      Governor's Fool, whose sallies had already helped to keep
      things lively.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll go fetch my lute," said the amiable Kuoni, and went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a long time absent, and the company was growing
      impatient, when at last he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now we shall have music," he informed the gaping company.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bore a great arch-lute so slung behind him that it
      almost entirely covered his back, and lent him, when he
      turned him round, the appearance of a monstrous beetle with
      a great brown shell walking upright upon two wispy legs,
      one purple and the other black.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was not this that set those Zealanders gaping. In
      Kuoni's wake came a round dozen Burgundian soldiers in
      their clanking armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've brought you cymbals as well as a lute," the Fool
      informed them. "Because I think it's cymbals that you
      really need. The lute-strings will follow. Or, if not
      lute-strings, strings better suited to the occasion. And
      they will supply some of you with dance music when you come
      to tread a dainty measure upon the empty air."
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Borselen, a big, fair man until now far gone in wine,
      but suddenly grown sober, fetched out a deep, growling
      oath, and swung to Rhynsault, who sat quietly smiling at
      his Fool's terrible humour. "Is this a masque, a fool's
      mummery," quothe he, "or do you mean me mischief?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Neither," Rhynsault answered him with a laugh. "We are
      here to discover what mischief has been meant by you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you so?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a flash van Borselen was upon the Lorrainer, one hand
      reaching for his throat, the other grasping a dagger and
      upraised to strike. But the Governor was a vigorous, agile
      man of his hands. He caught the Zealander's wrist as the
      blow descended and, by a wrenching twist of the arm, sent
      him sprawling, then sprang clear away before any of the
      others could leap to attack him in their host's defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Stand where you are!" he thundered at them, "or, by God,
      my men shall cut you down."
    </p>
    <p>
      Already the injunction was unnecessary. At a word from the
      quick Fool, the men-at-arms, their heavy swords naked in
      their hands, had ringed the company about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor, infuriated by the attack upon him, mouthed
      and snarled at them, his red face inflamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No need for more to prove your guilt, van Borselen. No
      need for more to warrant my hanging you out of hand. But
      first I'll have something out of you. Make him fast!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Disarmed, his hands wrenched behind him, and his wrists
      pinioned by a stirrup leather, van Borselen stood, pale and
      breathing hard, to face the Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault advanced upon him slowly, glaring his rage, and
      struck him violently in the face. "You'ld draw steel on me,
      would you, you dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are noble," said van Borselen, contempt in his blue
      eyes and curling his pale lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault struck him again. "You'll sneer in hell when I
      have done with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be nearer hell than I am," van Borselen answered
      him. "I have sixty tall fellows within these walls, and my
      gates are closed. You may kill me, but you'll never leave
      the place alive."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor's expression changed. Already the dawn of
      alarm was breaking in his eyes when a cackle of laughter
      shattered the moment's silence. It came from the Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your sixty tall fellows are bestowed, oh, quite snugly, my
      Lord of Borselen. These Burgundians make good valets. They
      undressed your fellows of their arms before they were
      expecting such attentions. I tell you this because I cannot
      bear to see a man feed his soul upon false hopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor laughed, and ordered the room to be cleared.
      The guests, all scared, and some of them with good reasons
      supplied by their consciences, were herded out to be placed
      under lock and key until next they should by required.
      Remained in the hall where the candles guttered above the
      remnants of the feast only van Borselen, the Governor, the
      Governor's Fool, and two Burgundian soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault pulled a chair to the great fire that blazed on
      the cowled hearth, and sat down. Beyond the hearth the Fool
      perched himself cross-legged upon a stool, and nursed his
      knee, eyes watchful and pallid face inscrutable.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you Zealander dog," growled the Governor, "will you
      talk, or must we constrain you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Knight of Borselen between his guards stood firm and
      dignified. The Governor's finger-prints showed red on his
      pale face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That depends upon what you wish me to say."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall hear." And Rhynsault told him briefly what he
      guessed of the treasonable traffic the Zealander had been
      conducting.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the proof?" van Borselen demanded. "The proof of all
      this, which is to justify the violence you have shown me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Proof, you fool! That is what I am here for. The proof you
      shall, yourself, supply."
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Borselen laughed. "Let me understand this thing.
      Because I keep open house in Arnemuiden, and make welcome
      here such of my trader countrymen as choose to seek my
      hospitality, you assume that I am plotting treason. And
      upon no better grounds you invade my castle, overpower my
      men, assault my person and my guests, insult me grossly,
      and threaten me with death? Is that your tale?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is," said Rhynsault.
    </p>
    <p>
      Van Borselen laughed again. "A pleasant tale for the ear of
      your Duke, I think. I hope you have prepared the answers to
      the questions he will come to ask you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the answers to the questions I am asking you that
      are your first concern."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no answers for you. If I am to be questioned, let
      me be questioned in a properly constituted court and
      according to the forms of the law."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Walcheren I am the law, and wherever I sit in judgment
      is a properly constituted court. I administer here the high
      justice and the low in the name of my master the Duke of
      Burgundy. You waste my time, man, with your quibbles. Will
      you answer my questions, or will you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not. I deny your jurisdiction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll deny it all you please, but it shall be exercised.
      Take off his boots."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What will you do?" Van Borselen was aghast, be it from
      fear or anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Put you to the question, in a homely fashion and with the
      means immediately to hand." And Rhynsault waved eloquently
      towards the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dare not, by God! I am noble, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be noble. But you'll burn as easily as a churl.
      Off with those boots of his."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall answer for this, Rhynsault, as surely as there
      is a God above us. You have no single scrap of evidence to
      justify you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Said the Fool slyly: "You were very ready and nimble with a
      dagger, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, yes! Did that look like innocence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or did conscience prompt you?" wondered the Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barefoot now, van Borselen was thrust forward by the
      Burgundians.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My first question," said the Governor, "is: Do you confess
      that you have trafficked in sedition with sundry of your
      countrymen?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Livid but resolute, van Borselen answered him. "You may
      roast me peicemeal, sir. But not a word shall you have from
      me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To it!" The Governor began, when Kuoni interposed,
      uncrossing his legs and leaning forward, his elbows on his
      bony knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps if he perceived your justification, Excellency, he
      would be less obstinate."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I care nothing for his obstinacy. I have broken the
      obstinacy of taller men."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay, but justification is justification, and if it may
      be had, it were premature to proceed without it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor looked at the Fool. The Fool returned the
      glance with that steady, unblinking stare which seemed at
      times so full of meaning. With an odd abruptness, Rhynsault
      obeyed the Fool's suggestion. He ordered the men to take
      the prisoner out and wait with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What now?" he growled when he was alone with Kuoni.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool rose. "Without folly to guide you, gossip, you'ld
      have run your head into a noose before now. That man is
      right when he says that the tale would bear an ugly sound
      in the ears of the Duke. Van Borselen is noble, after all,
      and his family is powerful. It's courting trouble to treat
      him as if he were a greasy merchant."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How else are we to reach the truth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Find first some scrap of evidence to justify you measures.
      He is doing you a service when he urges it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if there is no evidence, beyond the evidence of our
      senses."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save us from the evidence of any man's senses!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there is no other."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where have you sought it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God's death! Where am I to seek it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Kuoni raised his eyes to the ceiling, as if inviting the
      heavens beyond to be witness to the impenetrable stupidity
      of the man he served. "Why else are we here?" he asked.
      "Why did I perform what I did, and have van Borselen's men
      overpowered, if it were not so as to make the whole place
      free for our ransacking? Do you dream that men can engage
      in treason in a stronghold such as this, and never leave a
      scrap of evidence behind them? Search, gossip, search!
      Ransack the castle from rampart to dungeon, and see what
      you find. Isn't that what we came for?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hadn't thought of it," the Governor confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "True," said the Fool, "I forgot to tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The search was much more quickly fruitful than they could
      have hoped. In the Knight of Borselen's closet they found
      papers locked away in a chest, a bundle of letters, any one
      of which would have served to hang the man who had sent it
      as well as van Borselen who had received it, and some
      sheets covered with figures, which Rhynsault tossed aside
      as of no consequence, but to which the Fool devoted some
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      It proved the very simplest cypher, a cryptic writing that
      would not long have puzzled a child; the numerals stood for
      letters and stood for them in the order of the alphabet.
      The Fool, who had considerable clerkly skill, and, indeed,
      some scholarliness, sat late into the night transcribing
      them. What at last he bore to his master was a fairly
      complete account of the nature of the plot, the funds
      subscribed, the arms to be provided, the number of men to
      be counted upon in each district, and a list of the
      ringleaders with whom lay the responsibility of giving
      those men the signal when the moment came.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault rubbed his hands in satisfaction. It was very
      well. He had struck in time, and within forty-eight hours
      every one of those ringleaders would be laid by the heels.
      The conspiracy, thus deprived of guidance, might safely be
      left to perish by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've done well, Kuoni," he commended the Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is my habit," said the Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, not always." The tall Governor swung to confront him,
      and the Fool liked neither the look in his dark eyes nor
      the smile round the corners of his sensuous lips.
      "Sometimes you are clumsy because you love a jest too
      well."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's what I'm for, gossip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, ay; in season. Now this evening so that you might vent
      your cursed humour, you warned van Borselen too soon of
      what was coming to him, with the result that he all but had
      his dagger in my throat." He took up his whip as he spoke
      and loosened the thong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool's weak frame was shaken with sudden fear. His
      countenance lost its habitual impassivity. "I knew he'ld
      never take you unawares. I thought to amuse you," he cried
      in frantic assurance; then, "Jesus!" he shrieked as the
      lash hard-driven, cut him about neck and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, it amused me," Rhynsault assured him. "But had I been
      less prompt with my hands, the laugh might have been with
      Borselen. I meant to lay your bones bare for that fool's
      trick of yours. But because you've served me well since in
      other ways, I'll show you mercy, and give you no more than
      a reminder to let your jests be less dangerous to me in
      future."
    </p>
    <p>
      The reminder took the shape of three more lashes, the last
      of which coiled about the Fool's white face, and broke the
      skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So!" The Governor flung aside his whip. "That will suffice
      to-night. Away with you, you whimpering cur."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool hobbled out without another word. He was
      accustomed to be thus punished for his shortcomings. He
      sought his bed, and pain and rage kept him awake until it
      was time to rise again. Yet next morning, when he came to
      break his fast at the Governor's table, he had resumed his
      impassivity, and save for the angry crimson weal that
      marked the track of his master's whip across his pallid
      face, save for the dark stains under his eyes which this
      morning were deeper and darker than usual, there was no
      sign about him or in his bearing or manner to suggest what
      he had undergone. And his evil, malicious wit flowed
      freely, especially later in the morning when the Burgundian
      lieutenant sat in judgment upon the Knight of Borselen and
      four others of those who had supped with them last night
      who were implicated by the letters found.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no defence, only an appeal from Borselen that he
      should be sent for trial to the Duke by virtue of his
      knightly rank. That appeal the Governor disregarded. His
      secretaries, of whom two accompanied him, drew up the
      indictments and attached to them the justificative
      documents, to be forwarded to the Duke. The Knight of
      Borselen and his four convicted companions in treason were
      hanged that same afternoon on a gallows in the market place
      of Arnemuiden. Not even Borselen's request for decapitation
      in deference to his rank would the Governor grant him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The business done, Rhynsault and his lances rode on to
      Veere, as the first stage of a progress which had for its
      object to deal summarily with those whose treason was
      revealed by the papers found in Borselen's castle. On the
      Fool's advice, he proceeded in such a manner that none knew
      the source of his information until he was put upon his
      trial. Thus those still to be arraigned had no warning save
      such as their consciences might give them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some, heeding that warning, made their escape in time. But
      the majority clung to their counting-houses and to the hope
      that they had not been incriminated until they found
      themselves in the hands of Burgundian justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fortnight before the Governor came back to
      Middelburg, a little wearied by his labours, and leaving in
      his wake a trail of laden gallows to show the way he had
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Middelburg itself half a score of prominent citizens,
      who suspected nothing, were ripe for judgment. The
      Governor's secretaries had carefully docketed the letters
      and prepared a list of their writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of that list stood the name of Danvelt, and
      with Master Philip Danvelt, on the morning after his
      return, the Burgundian lieutenant started his Middelburg
      campaign for the extirpation of treason.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>

    <h1>
      DANVELT'S ARREST
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip Danvelt's father had been a man of some taste and of
      cultured ideals, at least in physical matters. He had built
      himself a handsome gabled house on the Lange Delft, not far
      from Middelburg's imposing abbey, set in a fair garden and
      furnished with a sumptuousness, much of which had been
      supplied by Italy and the Levant, such as few noblemen in
      those parts could have matched.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall of this house sat Philip and his wife at dinner
      on that October morning that was big with fate for them.
      The two wings of a double door of stout oak, strengthened
      with bands of iron and iron studs, and arched in the Gothic
      manner, opened directly upon the garden. These doors were
      closed, and a bright fire was blazing on the hearth; but
      one of the lattices of the long leaded window stood open to
      admit a little of the pale sunshine, which had broken at
      last through the rain-clouds, whence a deluge had been
      descending for days upon the town. To the audible dripping
      from eaves and branches was presently added another sound
      to reach them through that open lattice: the distant
      rhythmic tramp of marching men.
    </p>
    <p>
      They paid no heed to it. Philip was in haste to dine. He
      had word of a cargo of wool which had arrived that morning
      from England, and he was impatient to be off to Flushing,
      himself to see it safely landed and to inspect it. His
      thoughts upon this, he ate and drank in silence, as indeed
      was his habit, and not only at table. Sluggish-minded, he
      was uncommunicative because he had nothing to communicate.
      The business of buying and selling made up for him the
      whole of life. The responsibilities of affairs which had
      devolved upon him on the death of his father and the taking
      of a wife had sobered him of much of the loud jactancy
      under which earlier he had cloaked his natural dullness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johanna, too, had grown silent lately; wistfully,
      introspectively silent. She was pale; the roses had almost
      entirely faded from her cheeks, and there was a dimming of
      the erstwhile sparkle of her clear blue eyes. If the change
      gave her the appearance of an age greater than the three
      and twenty years she now counted, yet by etherealising her
      beauty it served to heighten it. The graciousness which had
      ever marked her, deriving as much from graces of the spirit
      as of the body, was oddly increased by the gentle
      melancholy which lately had come to settle on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      To find in one sorrow the only counter-action of another is
      to subject a human soul to an excessive burden. From the
      emptiness left in her life by the consciousness of how it
      might have been filled and fulfilled, she was temporarily
      rescued by her sorrow in the grave illness and death of her
      father, an event which had followed a fortnight after the
      Count's departure from Middelburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attachment between father and daughter had been
      unusually close. An understanding man, of ready kindliness
      and broad outlook and a certain persistent youthfulness of
      nature which kept him in sympathy with the young, Claessens
      had been not only father and mother to her, but also a
      dearly loved brother and close friend. If he had lived
      well, yet he had husbanded the resources amassed by his
      shrewd industry, and his death left her a wealthy woman. If
      this accession of wealth secretly rejoiced her husband, who
      saw in the amassing of riches the aim and object of
      existence, as is natural to men of his outlook and
      environment, to her it seemed a mockery, an accentuation of
      her fundamental poverty in those things which glorify our
      earthly life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was her soul's emptiness and hunger the sole cause of
      her repining. A woman devoutly reared and devout and pure
      by nature could not harbour such longings and regrets
      without being lashed also by her conscience. She was the
      wife of Philip Danvelt, and whilst in the worldly sense she
      was guilty of no shadow of infidelity, yet in the spiritual
      sense--which in such finely balanced natures counts for as
      much or more--she knew that her thoughts were a continuous
      infidelity. She spoke of them to her confessor, did penance
      for them, and prayed nightly for strength to drive them
      out, whilst at the same time praying--as she had promised
      to pray--for him who was the object of them. Something of
      herself she had given to Count Anthony that night in the
      garden of the Gravenhof. Nothing that man's laws could
      count against her. Yet something that it was no longer hers
      to bestow, since all of her had been bestowed in marriage
      upon her husband. And however much she might realise it and
      be tormented by this realisation, yet she was powerless to
      retract the gift, powerless to withdraw her thoughts from
      the romantic prince who had incarnated her ideals and
      captured her devotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made what amends she could in an increased diligence
      where the carnal needs of her very carnal husband were
      concerned. She saw to it that he was well cared-for;
      submitted meekly to his unreasonable impatiences; returned
      never an answer to grumblings, reproaches, and complaints
      over trivial matters which came with exasperating readiness
      from his natural boorishness. She abandoned all pursuits
      which in his narrow view were not proper to a woman of her
      station, and which he grossly classified as suitable only
      to bawds of the Court. She gave away or sold her hawks, to
      the training of which she had devoted such time and skill,
      and her horses, unless ridden by Philip himself or by the
      servants, were not ridden at all, and rarely used even to
      bear her in a litter. A gift of painting which she had, she
      neglected because Philip accounted it a trivial and
      unworthy and almost wanton occupation. In short, so as to
      compromise with her conscience, she modelled herself into
      such a woman as Philip desired his wife to be, and hoped
      that by doing so she might one day reach the peace that is
      said to lie in duty accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were waited upon now by her old servant Jan, who had
      come to her when Claessens died, and a youth named Peter,
      who had been for some time of Philip's household.
      Nevertheless, her eyes were watchful ever for her husband's
      slightest need. And Philip, accepting all as a proper
      tribute to the master of the house, lacked even the grace
      to perceive in it a cause for self-congratulation. The
      memory of his mother, a termagant whose character he had
      largely inherited, might have served to inform him that all
      wives were not as Johanna, docile, submissive, and
      solicitous--to say nothing of being well-dowered--and might
      have brought him to consider himself unusually blessed and
      fortunate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had you mentioned it to him, he would have answered you:
      "Give me a wife who lacks those qualities and observe in
      how short a time under my tutelage she will acquire them."
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Johanna, because she never provoked unkindliness, and
      by her docility turned unkindliness aside when it was
      offered unprovoked, accounted him kindly, knew him for
      honest and straightforward, and held him in some esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching him now as he gobbled greedily, "You eat too
      quickly, Philip," she ventured in her solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cleared the platter and reached for his cup of Rhenish
      before he answered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have affairs awaiting me." His tone was gruff. "It's not
      for me to sit idle all day like a housewife." He tossed off
      the Rhenish, and swung to Jan. "Is my horse saddled?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Waiting for you, master, with Gottfried, who is ready to
      ride with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then . . ." He broke off to listen. "What's that? They
      come this way."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tramp of marching feet was close at hand; the clank of
      steel was audible above it, and the beat of the hooves of
      an ambling horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan stepped to the window, and thrust his head from the
      open casement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the dripping garden, now heavy with dead and sodden
      leaves, ran a roadway, and beyond this, fenced off by a
      single rail, gleamed the yellow waters of a canal. The pale
      sunlight flashed on the steel caps and pike-heads of a
      company of a dozen men-at-arms swinging briskly along, and
      already abreast with the gate, which was standing open.
      After them came a big man on a big horse and beside him
      trotted a little elfin figure all in yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's his excellency the Governor," Jan announced from the
      window.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah! Devil take him!" growled Master Danvelt, and heaved
      himself up on his short thick legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jan's next words gave the merchant pause. "They are
      coming here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The company was already in the short garden, and on the
      heels of Jan's announcement came the heavy blow of a
      pike-butt on the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jan, his face startled, remained standing with his back to
      the window, which was set in an embrasure, looking at his
      master, who returned the glance with one of blank, uneasy
      wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pike-butt rang again upon the door. Jan moved to open,
      when Danvelt's upheld hand restrained him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait. Whatever the Governor seeks here, there is no need
      for you to meet him, Johanna."
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt might have, as indeed he had, the utmost trust in
      Johanna's prudence and modesty; but he was also aware, as
      was all the world, of Rhynsault's ways, and he would take
      no risk, however remote, that might lie for him in
      Johanna's beauty. "Leave us," he bade her shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At once, Philip." But she delayed a moment to gather up
      some slight effects, and, in her obedient haste to the door
      which Peter opened for her, dropped some of them and
      stooped to recover them. That trivial accident may have
      been accountable for much that followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not in Rhynsault's ways to be patient in his
      dealings with a burgher.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard through the open window the sharp bark of an
      order, unintelligible to them. A moment later the door was
      smitten by a blow that broke the lock and flung open one of
      the heavy wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four men, laying their pikes together, and using them as a
      battering-ram, had hurled themselves against it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johanna, stricken and startled by the crash, swung round
      where she stood to ascertain its cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up the steps came the Sire Claude de Rhynsault, booted and
      spurred, wrapped in an ample red cloak against the chill
      damp October air, his head in a black velvet cap the
      liripipe of which was swathed like a muffler about his
      neck. After him, bird-like on his thin legs, hopped the
      Fool; the bells of his yellow chaperon tinkled as he moved;
      the great arch-lute was slung behind him. After the Fool
      came a couple of clerkly fellows in plain grey
      houppelandes, and after these two men-at-arms with
      broad-bladed halberts, the badge of Burgundy on their
      soiled white surcoats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip Danvelt scowled as he stared. Easy in his conscience
      so far as politics were concerned, his natural arrogance
      asserted itself in the face of the wantonly insulting
      violence of this entrance. He put back his head on its
      short bull-neck, and looked along his great nose at the
      Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      "On my life," he said, "this is a novel way of knocking at
      a man's door! What manners be these?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor, just within the threshold, looked down from
      his fine height upon Danvelt with the cold contempt of the
      professional soldier for the burgher. He was in his way,
      and despite his scar, rather a handsome man, this
      Burgundian lieutenant. His florid, shaven countenance was
      well and strongly featured; his black hair was glossy, his
      eyes bright and keen, and the teeth, displayed now in the
      smile that drew back his full red lips, were white and
      sound. He looked what he was, a healthy, vigorous animal,
      essentially male and essentially carnal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When next Burgundy knocks at your door, be more prompt to
      open," he said shortly, and came forward, the least touch
      of swagger in his movements. "You, I suppose are, Philip
      Danvelt?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am, and I wait to learn why you break in upon me in this
      manner." He was foolishly pompous considering his station
      and that of the man he addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whilst I wait for the respect which is due to the
      representative of your Duke."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In your manners, sir, you are more representative of a
      house-breaker. Regard me that door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Tush, fool! You shall have something else to consider
      presently. You'll think less then of the damage to your
      door."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps you'll think more of it, sir, when I call on you
      to pay for a new lock."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault was growing weary of this pertness. He lifted up
      his voice. "By the Blood! Will you chop wit with me? Crow a
      little less loudly, my burgher cockerel, before we slit
      your comb. I like neither your looks nor your ways."
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarlet with anger at being thus browbeaten in his own
      house, Danvelt still answered boldly. "My ways, whether you
      like them or not, are those that become an honest man, and
      a loyal citizen who can pay what he owes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault laughed. "If you can make good that boast, I'll
      buy you a new lock." Then he spoke over his shoulder to the
      two clerks who had followed him into the room, whilst his
      halberdiers kept the threshold. "Set me a chair here. That
      one."
    </p>
    <p>
      As he turned, he caught sight for the first time of
      Johanna, who had shrunk back and was half concealed by a
      tall clothes press. She was staring in fascinated horror at
      the misshapen Fool, whose eyes, beady and expressionless as
      a snake's, were unblinkingly observing her from out of his
      long pallid face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perceiving her, Rhynsault asked himself where he had last
      seen her, presently to remember the interest she had
      aroused in him at the Gravenhof and the intention then
      entertained of seeking her closer acquaintance. The
      preoccupations of his office after the Duke's visit had
      eclipsed the intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      He unwound the liripipe from about his neck and bared his
      head. He might be a despot to the burghers, but he would
      never be other than a gallant to their women. And this
      woman, as he had already earlier observed, was of a
      singular and very delicate beauty, from the crown of her
      golden head, which was uncovered, the hair braided, to the
      tips of the peaked shoes protruding from her gown of
      dove-coloured velvet. He observed, too, the pride and
      dignity with which she carried that head upon the slender
      white pillar of her neck. She compelled homage, and
      Rhynsault afforded it. He bowed his sleek black head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I implore your pardon, mistress. I had not before observed
      you. My intrusion here is in the course of the duties of my
      office. But it would have been less rude had I suspected
      your presence."
    </p>
    <p>
      If his entrance and subsequent conduct had startled her,
      yet she retained her calm and her dignity. Steadily she met
      his glance, refusing to perceive the manifest admiration it
      held.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you, sir, for the apology. Your business will be
      with my husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool in the background uttered a laugh that did not
      move a muscle of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do well to remind him. He has a way of forgetting
      trifles for essentials."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quiet, Fool!" Rhynsault admonished him, and with a "By
      your leave good mistress," he sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her husband turned to her. "You will have household matters
      to engage you, Johanna." And then, like the pompous fool he
      was, permitted himself a sneer at Rhynsault. "His
      excellency, no doubt, will give you leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor took the words literally and ignored the sneer
      in them. "Nay, nay. Sit, mistress, sit. We should be loath
      to lose your company."
    </p>
    <p>
      Tense and straight, Johanna looked him between the eyes.
      "Is this an invitation, Excellency; or a command?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what odds which?" said the Governor, although a
      little out of countenance under the steadiness of her
      regard, the hardness of her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I desire to know so that I may answer you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Assume it which you please, and answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I will answer both. If it is an invitation, I decline
      it. If a command, I must ask your authority."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor sucked in his breath, and awkwardly laughed a
      little. A man he would have browbeaten. But the dignity of
      this lady daunted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My authority?" he echoed. "Am I not the representative of
      your lord the Duke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may represent him to his satisfaction in many things;
      but you will never represent him in constraining a woman
      against her inclinations." She dropped him a half-curtsey.
      "You will give me leave, Excellency," and she moved to the
      door. On the threshold she paused. "You will send me word,
      Philip, when his Excellency has gone." And on that went
      out, to the wonder and admiration of all, including her
      husband, who hardly recognised in that cold firmness the
      spirit of his softly docile housewife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor noisily cleared his throat. "It seems the
      Duke's warrant doesn't run with any of you," he grumbled,
      to save his face. "Well, well, let's come to business,
      Master Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "With all my heart," said the merchant, his weariness of
      manner a studied insolence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may be less hearty over it by and by. What was it you
      boasted yourself when I came in? Loyal and honest, was it
      not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did I boast myself that? I am entitled to do so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were honest you would tell me that you're a liar
      when you call yourself loyal. Whether you tell me so or
      not, I know it, which is why I am here, why I enter without
      ceremony."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you say I am not loyal?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You heard me, surely."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In what have I failed in loyalty? I have taken no part in
      politics. I know the Duke's rule to be just, and in my
      heart I believe it to be the best for the Netherlands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Since when have you held these worthy opinions?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All my life."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault looked at him frowning. "God give me patience to
      sit here while you stand before my face and offend me with
      such paltry lies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Excellency! Your office gives you no right to insult me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Insult you, fool?" The Governor sank back in his chair,
      his glance baleful. He lowered his tone. "I insult you, do
      I? Carry your mind back to a certain escapade of yours last
      March in Bruges, when you were laid by the heels and would
      certainly have been hanged if a noble but ill-advised
      gentleman, taking pity on your plight, had not stood surety
      for you in a thousand ducats. What was it brought you into
      the clutches of the ducal lieutenant there? Was it this
      fine loyalty to the Duke of Burgundy which you now say has
      inspired you throughout your life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Danvelt had grown pale, and his arrogance fled out
      of him as fear entered in. Was he in these troubled days of
      seditious movements to be brought to account for that old
      and now forgotten affair? His body drooped with his spirit.
      He spoke in a tone so different that his voice seemed that
      of another man.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, but that, my lord! A folly committed in the heat of
      wine, in--"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor interrupted him. "<i>In vino Veritas . . .</i>
      You know the adage. If not, my Fool will translate it for
      you. So tell me no more that I insult you when I call you
      by the names that become you. Your last disloyalty cost you
      a thousand ducats, and would have cost you your life but
      for the intervention on your behalf of a potent gentleman
      who occasionally disturbs the proper course of events for
      the satisfaction of his own romantic notions. To any but a
      thick-headed Flemish fool that would have been a sufficient
      warning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I needed no warning," Danvelt protested. "I was not
      disposed to treason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why have you embarked upon it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Embarked upon it? I?" Danvelt was really aghast. "I take
      oath before--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't perjure yourself in vain, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mute in his consternation, Danvelt stared blankly at the
      Governor. He felt physically sick; the sweat stood in beads
      upon his brow. At last, steadying himself upon a conscience
      that was untroubled in these matters, he came to the
      conclusion that here he was the victim of some error which
      he could dispel the moment it were disclosed to him. In
      that assurance he commanded himself, and cast off his
      momentary palsy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you would tell me, Excellency, precisely of what I am
      suspected, and upon what grounds--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, you shall be told. You shall be told. Not of what you
      are suspected, but of what there is clear proof against
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt actually smiled. "That I know too well that there
      is not, for I have never been a party to any treason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Have you not? Ha! Have you ever heard of one Thomas Tegel
      of the town of Veere?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not until you hanged him a week ago, and then all Zealand
      heard of him."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool, who sat at the table, in the place that Johanna
      had vacated, his elbows on the board, his chin in his
      cupped palms, here interrupted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hanging will often make a man famous that might otherwise
      have died unknown. There's hope for you, Master Danvelt.
      The hope of fame." He sighed noisily, and gave his
      attention to a dish of comfits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault pursued his questioning. "And you had never heard
      of this Tegel until then?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never to my knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor's bold dark eyes considered him intently. "By
      the Blood! You're a glib liar." He turned to one of the
      secretaries, who was already fumbling in a leathern wallet.
      "Give me that letter marked Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      He received and folded it so that only the signature was
      visible. "Come here," he bade Danvelt, and, when the
      merchant had obeyed, he thrust the paper under his nose.
      "What name do you read there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "P. Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your own name, eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes! It is my name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So! You confess it, then!" Rhynsault rose, handing back
      the letter to his secretary. "It is wise of you to spare us
      further trouble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confess it?" cried Danvelt between fear and fury. "Confess
      what? What have I confessed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, that you wrote that letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay now, nay!" Danvelt protested. His mind was reeling.
      "You go too fast. I did not so much as see a letter. All
      that you showed me was a name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your name. Your name appended to a letter written to this
      convicted traitor Tegel, in which you promise him supplies
      of arms and money to forward the enterprise in hand. A
      hanging matter. Master Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "For the writer, perhaps, but I am not he."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault showed signs of exasperation. "Does it not bear
      your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My name, yes. But not my signature."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what's the difference? Is this a riddle, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Danvelt, exasperated also on his side, answered
      almost contemptuously: "A riddle that your Fool--that any
      fool--can read for you at a glance."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kuoni raised his head from the dish of comfits. "Sir, I
      read fate; not riddles. I could read yours at this moment
      with tolerable certainty."
    </p>
    <p>
      Meeting his eyes, Danvelt shivered. He turned again to the
      Governor, and again changed his tone. "I mean, Excellency,
      that I never wrote that or any other treasonable letter.
      The signature is not mine, as my signature will show. The
      name even . . . it is but P. Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And what should P stand for but Philip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It might stand for Peter or Paul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or even," the Fool put in, "for Priscilla, Petronilla, or
      Penelope; or yet for pope, for pimp or prude; or again, for
      prudent, pernicious, pestilent, or philosophical. But when
      all is considered, I think it really stands for patibulary.
      Indeed, patibulary is pre-eminently prognostic of the fate
      of this Danvelt. Unless--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quiet, Fool!" The Governor snapped at him. Then he waved
      his pikemen forward. "Make him fast."
    </p>
    <p>
      Distraught, the merchant sprang forward, his hands out-held
      in supplication.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, sir, hear me out before offering me a violence the
      Duke could never sanction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They all say that," the Governor sneered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This charge is absurd and empty," Danvelt pursued. "I take
      God and Our Lady to witness that I have never engaged in
      any treason, never so much as harboured any thought of
      treason. I never wrote that letter, whatever it contains. I
      swear, I never wrote it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You repeat yourself, and reiteration is proof of nothing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A dull, redundant dog," said the Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But to assume so much upon so little evidence!" Danvelt
      protested. "I am not the only Danvelt in Walcheren;
      possibly not the only Philip Danvelt. You cannot arrest me
      on so slight an assumption."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault looked down his nose at him and smiled. "And your
      antecedents? Do they count for nothing? Your little exploit
      in Bruges?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But it is so easy to prove that this letter is not mine,
      that the writing is not mine. A score of worthy men here in
      Middelburg can testify to that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "They shall be called to do so. Oh, you shall have a fair
      trial, never fear. And if you're as innocent as you
      protest, you may dispel your alarm. Meanwhile, I cannot
      leave you at large. Fetch him along." And, turning on his
      heel, the Governor strode out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pikemen ranged alongside of the merchant, who gathered
      courage from the Governor's last words. He turned to Jan
      who had been a stricken witness of these proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jan, you will tell your mistress of this. Bid her not to
      be uneasy. Reassure her, Jan. You see that it is a mistake.
      I shall be enlarged again in a day or two when the matter
      is sifted."
    </p>
    <p>
      They marched him out.
    </p>

    <h1>
      THE FOOL'S PHILOSOPHY
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The Burgundian lieutenant sat over the remains of a
      generous supper, savouring with his Fool a jug of Rhenish
      that had been mulled and spiced. They occupied a cosy
      chamber adjacent to the great draughty hall of the
      Gravenhof. It was hung with Flemish tapestries, and lighted
      by a lamp suspended from the groined ceiling. A heaped-up
      fire of logs blazed and spluttered in the cavernous
      fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool was busy on a song that should express the whole
      of his philosophy of life. In these amiable labours he was
      disturbed by his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I think," said the Governor, "that we have now rounded up
      all the game."
    </p>
    <p>
      This in allusion to the five arrests he had that day
      effected in Middelburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I think," he added a moment later, "that when these
      Middelburg traitors have been hanged there will be an end
      of plots against the government of the Duke's highness and
      we shall be able to take our ease."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Amen!" said the Fool. "Our ease is what we desire above
      all else, whether the burghers hang or not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, they will hang," the Governor assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "All the five of them?" The tone implied a doubt.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? Whom would you except?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Myself, none; for I cannot imagine that any of them will
      be missed. But there's the evidence. It may give four of
      them to the hangman. I've a doubt of the fifth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean Danvelt? There's his letter."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He swears he can prove it isn't his. If he can, he goes
      back to his beautiful wife. Poor soul! I hope for her sake
      that he can't."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor was considering. "He demands that I send a
      courier to his friend, Count Anthony of Guelders. His
      friend, mark you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool laughed. His laughter had the peculiarity of being
      either seen or heard; but never both at the same time. In
      this instance the grimace of laughter was on his face, but
      no sound of it came forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, that can't be done at present. The Count is with the
      army before Liège, and will have enough to engage him. He
      would resent any such message even on behalf of his friend
      Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor looked at him. "What do you conceive to be the
      link between so oddly assorted a pair?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool thought that he knew, and said what he thought he
      knew. But he said nothing of how he came by the knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The burgher has a comely--an exceptionally comely wife.
      Unless it be that, I can't think what it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You foulness! Is that a thing to say of the austere and
      chaste Count Anthony?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take no man's reputation on trust," said the Fool.
      "Reputations are notoriously fallacious. How can they be
      otherwise? To himself a man is what he thinks he is; to
      others what he appears to be. The real man is known to his
      Maker alone. Count Anthony is a poet. But then he is also a
      man. Count Anthony the poet may impose his ideals upon
      Count Anthony the man. But Count Anthony the man may not
      always accept them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In this case," said the Governor, "the association of
      these two is older by some months than Danvelt's marriage.
      It was in March of last year that Count Anthony rescued
      this man from the consequences of his seditious utterances
      in Bruges."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That would be Count Anthony the poet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what inducement had he?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fact that he's a poet. It conduces to eccentricity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I had supposed. But Danvelt suggests a friendship, a
      bond between himself and the Count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The bond has been formed subsequently and is compounded of
      indebtedness and vainglory on the part of the burgher. He
      magnifies himself by boasting of a friendship which appears
      justified by one eccentric act on the part of Count
      Anthony. Pay no heed to that, gossip. Besides, why should
      you? Either Danvelt has been playing at treason, or he
      hasn't. If he has, you hang him; if he hasn't, you don't.
      His relations with Count Anthony, even though they were
      brothers, do not affect the issue."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're right," said the Governor, and added: "He hangs
      then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're set on it. Perhaps you're wise, gossip. Hanging is
      a good example to others. In this case the evidence, as it
      stands, will allow you to indulge your fancy either way.
      You may account it sufficient or insufficient, as you
      please, and none could question your judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who should want to question it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who, indeed, gossip? Enviable man."
    </p>
    <p>
      But they reckoned in their cold-blooded fashion without
      Mistress Johanna, whose arrival at the Gravenhof a servant
      came presently to announce.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At this hour?" The Governor scowled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should you hesitate?" quoth the Fool. "The lady is
      worth looking at, at any hour, on any pretext. I have
      rarely seen so many graces assembled in one woman. Besides,
      she may help you to a decision about her husband's fate.
      With that off your mind, you'll sleep more peacefully."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean in the matter of the evidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else should I mean, gossip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault considered, and ordered her to be admitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came, demurely dignified, a long black riding-cloak
      over her dove-grey velvet, her head crowned by a tall
      hennin, from which floated a long wispy veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor rose to receive her. The Fool, affecting to
      ignore her, took up his quill again, bent over his
      parchment, and thus, in a sense, effaced himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not my custom to receive suitors at so late an hour,
      madam," was Rhynsault's greeting, delivered, however,
      without gruffness. The Fool was right. She was singularly
      lovely. Even lovelier as he beheld her now in the amber
      light of his lamp than she had earlier appeared to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware of it, my lord, and grateful for the
      concession."
    </p>
    <p>
      He admired her pride of bearing, the self-command which
      enabled her almost completely to dissemble an inevitable
      anxiety. He proffered a chair, which she accepted
      gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A cup of Rhenish?" he invited, adding, as if in
      justification of this informal hospitality: "The air is
      chill."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had to brave it, my lord, in the hope of sparing my
      husband a night in gaol. No wine, my lord. I would have
      come earlier, but that I was some time assembling these
      documents. They should dispel all cause that you may think
      you have for keeping my husband a prisoner." She proffered
      him a little roll of parchments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still standing, he took them, frowning thoughtfully. "What
      are these?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Letters written by my husband. When my servant told me
      what had occurred, on what grounds he had been arrested,
      and what the evidence against him, I set out to procure
      these letters from persons with whom he has corresponded at
      times when away from Middelburg. I had hoped to be able to
      come to you earlier. But the search was a difficult one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What have these letters to do with the matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have brought them so that you may compare the hands and
      the signatures. You will see at once that the treasonable
      letter upon which you arrested him was not written by
      Philip."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How do you know that, mistress? You haven't seen the
      letter upon which he was arrested."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No; but I know that the writing cannot be the same,
      because he never wrote any treasonable letters. He never
      engaged in any treason."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? He could not possibly have engaged in treason without
      my knowledge."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not?" The Governor's eyes were upon her. Indeed, they
      had never left her since he had received that package from
      her hands. "Why not? You'll not persuade me that husbands
      do nothing that is outside the knowledge of their wives.
      This Danvelt was frequently from home, for instance, was he
      not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sometimes. Affairs took him to Flushing or to Arnemuiden."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Arnemuiden! Ay! A hotbed of treason that. How can you
      speak to the nature of the affairs that took him? Will you
      pretend that you had his entire confidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was under no such illusion. Indeed, the self-sufficient
      burgher sought to magnify himself in her eyes by casting a
      veil of mystery over his affairs, as though each of them
      presented a problem soluble only to an initiate.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps not," she admitted. "But in any case the
      verification of the handwriting must be one of the first
      steps towards establishing either his guilt or his
      innocence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Must it so, mistress?" He smiled down upon her from his
      fine height. Half-playfully he chid her. "You are to
      instruct me, then, in the details of my justiciary's
      office?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I, indeed, my lord. I have no such thought. I mention
      what is but a matter of common knowledge and common-sense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well," he said. "The letters shall be kept. I thank
      you for bringing them to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As to that, my lord, it is I who shall thank you for
      making the comparison and setting my husband at liberty."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me warn you, mistress, not to place too much reliance
      upon this comparison. It may be, after all, that you have
      but added evidence against him."
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled confidently as she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am quite sure that I have not done that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You love this husband?" he asked her gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He is my husband, sir." She was suddenly stiff and
      distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That does not answer my question."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are questions, sir, that are never answered because
      they should never have been asked."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You misunderstand me, madam." He stooped towards her a
      little. "I ask out of concern for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That same concern should have assumed the answer. If you
      will make the comparison for which I have brought you the
      means, I shall be indeed grateful."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, the comparison! The comparison!" He was a little
      impatient. "It shall be made. Depend upon that. It shall be
      made in due season."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In due season?" For the first time she seemed taken aback,
      and looked him fully in his handsome, florid face. "But why
      not now--at once?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "There are inconveniences. You will not be importunate,
      mistress, when I tell you that it would distress me to deny
      you. This is a matter for my secretaries and for the court
      when it comes to sit in judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if you can persuade yourself by these that no charge
      is possible against my husband, what need, then, for
      judgment? Could you not do it now, at once? So that my
      husband need not spend a night in gaol? It is to save him
      this that I have laboured."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor was properly sympathetic. There were the forms
      of the law which must be observed. Her husband, having been
      arrested, could not possibly be enlarged until the forms
      were satisfied. This could only be through the ordinary
      channel of the court. He deplored it, he suggested, but he
      was powerless to alter it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, only to-day, sir," she reminded him, "you boasted in
      my house that you are, yourself, the law in Walcheren."
    </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, smiling gently. "You are right to say I boasted.
      I was guilty of overstatement. I am no more than the
      mouthpiece of the law, the channel through which the law is
      dispensed. Have patience, madam. Believe me, I would do a
      deal, a very great deal, to serve you. But be merciful by
      not asking me to do that which is beyond my power."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was distressed. "When, then? How soon can you give
      judgment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To save your anxieties, at the earliest moment possible.
      But bear in mind that your husband is only one of five
      arrested to-day in Middelburg. The five cases are to be
      sifted. They overlap and are intertwined with one another.
      This will take time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But my husband's does not. My husband is not one of these
      as that comparison of hands will show."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may not take your word for that, madam, much though it
      would pleasure me to do so. The evidence of a wife! That is
      no evidence, even if she were qualified to speak. But I'll
      do what I can to serve you. Be sure of that." He was
      considering her ever, and his eyes had lately narrowed a
      little. "Come to me again to-morrow, madam. By then I may
      be able to be more definite. Seek me before I dine."
    </p>
    <p>
      In dejection she thanked him and withdrew, lighted by his
      servant whom he summoned to do the office. When she had
      gone, he sank into his chair again, and filled himself a
      cup from the jug. In silence he sat considering the wine
      before he drank it. In silence he continued after he had
      drunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool, watching him covertly, the least shadow of a
      mocking smile about his almost lipless mouth, at last broke
      in upon his brooding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why so thoughtful, gossip? What's to think about? Isn't
      all plain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plain?" Rhynsault stared at him across the table with the
      dull eyes of a suddenly awakened man. "What is plain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A number of things, concerning both Master Danvelt and
      Master Danvelt's widow in prospect." Abruptly he changed
      the subject. "Have you ever observed, gossip, that there is
      no loveliness to compare with loveliness in distress? I
      marvel that you escaped the appeal of it; that you could
      still be harsh with her. But I admire it in you. I admire
      it and commend it. Duty first: that is the motto of the
      Lord Claude de Rhynsault. The other things may follow."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What other things?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fruits of duty. And that, faith, was a luscious,
      well-sunned fruit; so white and smooth and warm. Don't tell
      me that you beheld it with indifference. Don't say that you
      were not tempted to put forth your hand to pluck it, for I
      shall not believe you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault looked at him again. "What then?" he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what is temptation for? Certainly not a thing to be
      resisted, whatever the priests may say. For what, after
      all, is temptation? The hawker of life's most alluring
      wares. And what's a priest? A kill-joy. And where are the
      advantages of being Ducal Governor, Burgundian Lieutenant
      in Zealand, Lord of Life and Death, Dispenser of the High
      Justice and the Low, if you may not help yourself to a
      burgher's wife now and again?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pish!" said the Governor, and sat on bemused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fool rose and went to fetch his arch-lute from the
      side-table on which it had been placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's advice for your case from the new song I've made."
      He thrummed a moment, and then delivered himself in a voice
      harsh as a raven's:
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Take all things that life can give<br>
      Love and wine and laughter.<br>
      Live your fill whiles you may live.<br>
      Scorn the life contemplative<br>
      Of things that may come after.<br>
      Ha ha, ha, ha! Hereafter!"
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
      More would have followed but that Rhynsault silenced him.
      "Cease your hell-cat music!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool was scandalised. "Thus you receive philosophy that
      is sound, opportune, and to your needs. I commend you to
      the saints, and take my leave."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out, his face distorted by his silent laughter.
      That there was devilry ahead he knew as surely as he knew
      Claude de Rhynsault, which was much better than Claude de
      Rhynsault knew himself. He had done his best to apply a
      spur to the devilry, out of the sheer malice of his nature
      and because of the satisfaction which his warped soul found
      in observing in others the course of passions from whose
      indulgence he was personally debarred.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the hall without, the thrumming of his lute and his
      receding voice reached the brooding Governor.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Flout not Love, for Love will not<br>
      Suffer it, I warn you.<br>
      Drink you whiles the cup is hot.<br>
      Soon in chilly death you'll rot<br>
      With only Hell to warm you.<br>
      Ha, ha, ha, ha! To warm you!"
    </blockquote>

    <h1>
      RHYNSAULT'S WOOING
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall of the Gravenhof was unusually thronged on the
      following morning by suitors awaiting audience of the
      Governor. The arrests of the day before were responsible
      for this; for in addition to the usual attendance of those
      who had affairs of one kind and another to transact with
      the ducal representative, his officers, and administrators,
      there was a number of friends and relatives of the accused,
      some summoned to render certain testimony, others coming of
      their own free will to plead and petition. Amongst these,
      but apart from them, and waiting patiently, sat Mistress
      Johanna, attended by her servants Jan and Peter and her
      waiting-woman Grieta. Her outward composure betrayed little
      of the anxiety and distress within. Apart from the urgings
      of wifely duty, in the discharge of which she sought to
      make amends for the lack of those deeper feelings which
      become a wife, as well as for the spiritual infidelity of
      which her conscience bore the guilt, there was a genuine
      and natural concern for Philip. In the hour of his distress
      and danger, she remembered only his good qualities, his
      directness and honesty, and her own shortcomings; and she
      was here to strain every nerve in serving and rescuing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above the subdued hum of conversation, a voice broke
      suddenly, cawing an evil song. The impish Fool surged into
      the hall by the double doors at the end of it, his lute
      slung before him, his face inscrutably alight, and sang his
      way through the crowd of suitors, who fell away before him.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Out of Love is Loathing born;<br>
      Out of Laughter, Weeping.<br>
      Time will wither Beauty's form<br>
      Pluck the blossom from the thorn.<br>
      And Death will come a-reaping.<br>
      Ha, ha, ha, ha! A-reaping!"
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
      He reached the Governor's closet and the Burgundian
      halberdiers who guarded the threshold, and passed in,
      leaving horror in his wake, especially in the breasts of
      those concerned for the unfortunate prisoners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor sat considering a list which had been placed
      before him by the usher. He looked up scowling at the
      unceremonious entrance of the licensed Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are inopportune," he greeted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Impossible! Folly is never out of season."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begone! I have affairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I perceived as I crossed the antechamber. Let me assist
      you by indicating the order of them." At his master's side,
      he leaned upon the table, and ran a long bony finger down
      the usher's list until he came to the name of Johanna
      Danvelt. There the finger paused. "I should begin there,
      since this is the only case that offers complexities and
      may delay you. The others are easily disposed of."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor and the Fool looked into each other's eyes.
      Rhynsault yielded to the suggestion, and the usher was
      instructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johanna came, the usher withdrew, and Kuoni retired into
      the background to lounge unnoticed on the window-seat, set
      in a deep embrasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She began by thanking his excellency for admitting her so
      promptly, ahead of others who had waited longer and
      therefore had perhaps a prior claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was graciousness itself. He assured her that to keep her
      waiting was a discourtesy of which he could never be
      guilty, and he pressed her to sit. She had brought him, she
      announced, yet some further letters, letters written to
      herself by Philip on the eve of their marriage, so that he
      might compare the hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much was hardly necessary. The letters you left with me
      last night suffice abundantly."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have made the comparison already?" she cried eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay. That will follow in the proper season."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In the proper season?" The implied postponement dismayed
      her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then came aid from an unexpected quarter. Said the Fool
      from the background, almost peremptorily: "What season more
      proper than the present?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?" Frowning, the Governor turned to stare at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you, sir. Thank you!" cried Johanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, mistress; no thanks. I but preach my philosophy of
      life; which is to seize ever what the season sends."
    </p>
    <p>
      If the answer mystified her, it was clear to Rhynsault. He
      spoke again of his eagerness, his ardent desire to serve
      her in all things. "Which is the reason," he added, "why I
      ordered you to be instantly admitted. But despite my good
      will towards you, I am confronted with difficulties where
      your husband is concerned, difficulties supplied by his own
      imprudence. It is not as if this were his first offence.
      There is that business in Bruges. In the case of a man of
      such antecedents, my duty to my master the Duke makes
      necessary the strictest scrutiny. Your husband claims Count
      Anthony of Guelders for his friend, and desires me to send
      a letter to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      He watched her intently as he spoke. Remembering Kuoni's
      suggestion last night of the possible link between the
      burgher and the Count, he desired to test it. Momentarily
      Johanna's eyes dilated. A sudden dread, a horror swept
      through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thought of appealing to Count Anthony had already
      presented itself to her, had been weighed and finally
      dismissed because of a terrible fear lest, yielding to an
      overwhelming temptation to remove the obstacle that stood
      between them, the Count's intervention now might have the
      result of precipitating her husband's doom. Her confidence
      in the Count's honour might not really permit her to
      believe this thing. Yet not even in the last extremity
      would she dare to put it to the test; and the suggestion
      now that Philip himself should be the agent of such a thing
      appalled her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet her bearing revealed nothing of this. Already pale and
      a little breathless when she had entered, a deepening
      pallor and an increased breathlessness went unnoticed. Her
      countenance preserved its calm after that swift momentary
      flash of fear from her clear eyes. She looked steadily at
      Rhynsault, and shook her head. She even displayed the ghost
      of a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My husband overstates the case when he claims Count
      Anthony as his friend. Once Count Anthony befriended him,
      just out of the chivalry and pity of his nature. He had no
      previous knowledge of him, and has had little since;
      certainly no knowledge that would enable him to speak to my
      husband's character and pursuits; nor, can I suppose,
      sufficient interest to bring him to intervene."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault appeared relieved. "It is as well," he said. "For
      in any case, Count Anthony is with the Duke's highness in
      the army investing Liège, and there would be delays and
      difficulties in reaching him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "All to no purpose even then," she repeated. "And
      fortunately not necessary, since you have these letters. If
      you will compare the signatures . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      He unfolded one of the letters, and glanced at it. "What's
      this? 'My jewel,'" he read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool in the background laughed. Rhynsault swung upon
      him in a passion real or simulated. "Begone!" he roared.
      "Out of this! I'll have no ribaldries of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Provide your own, then," said the Fool, as he obeyed, and
      made for the door of an inner room. "You'll contrive well
      enough without me." He leered, and was gone, with a last
      look at Johanna that turned her cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile with which the Governor turned to her again was
      invested with a fresh meaning for her, now that her senses
      had been awakened by the Fool. Tall and handsome in his
      fur-edged purple houppelande, the heavy gold chain of
      office on his breast, the Lorrainer bowed his sleek black
      head once more over that love-letter of Philip Danvelt. He
      had written so few, and so rarely in that tender strain,
      that it was an irony this one should have survived for its
      present purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'My jewel,'" he read again, and again looked at her with
      his ingratiating smile. "A jewel, indeed," he agreed. "On
      my soul too fair a jewel for the wear of any loutish
      burgher."
    </p>
    <p>
      She commanded herself with difficulty, repressed all show
      of the indignation that consumed her, save the scarlet
      flame that swept across her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It--it is the signature, my lord, that I desire you to
      consider."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes, the signature. But there's more than a signature
      to be considered, mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True. There are dates. They may play an important part in
      this." She half-rose in her dissembled alarm. "Suffer me to
      call my servant Jan. He knows--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let be! Let be!" he interrupted her. "If you would do your
      husband service, we must have a word alone together, you
      and I." He sank his voice to a gentle, wooing note. He set
      a hand on the back of her chair, and leaned over her as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      She used a woman's only buckler in such a case and affected
      not to understand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You wish to question me?" she assumed, but shrank a little
      from his closeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, what a timid dove it is!" he purred. "I vow you're
      trembling, mistress. But why? Surely you are in no fear of
      me. Will you not believe that it is my wish to be your
      friend?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You--you are kind," she said, conscious of the foolishness
      of the words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Kind?" He laughed. It was, indeed, she thought, a word for
      laughter. "I will be kinder so that you are reasonable."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reasonable?" She was almost palsied by his closeness and
      did not dare to look up. She could feel his breath upon her
      neck and cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the knowledge of his power and that her husband's life
      lay in his hands, and might be blotted out at his pleasure
      if he were provoked, prevented her from using the weapons
      of righteous anger to break this evil spell he wove about
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abruptly he pushed the letters back into her hand. "Here,
      take you these."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--but you have not compared the writing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pish! What shall the writing signify to me?" Never a
      patient wooer, he drove now straight to his ends. "Your
      husband's life doesn't hang on a row of pothooks. It hangs
      on my belief in what you tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But there is more than that. There are many who can
      testify--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perdition take them all! I care nothing for their
      testimony. Your word is enough for me, and I'll accept your
      word that the treasonable letter is not in your husband's
      hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll accept my word?" She was between hope and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even though I did not believe it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Followed a pause in which she could hear the thudding of
      her heart. "If I did that," he resumed, "your husband would
      be delivered from his peril. And it is a very mortal peril,
      I can assure you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But how can that be, since he is innocent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault straightened himself again, and again laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Innocent he may be. But I must be persuaded to pronounce
      him so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else can you pronounce him when the evidence is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A fig for evidence!" he interrupted her. "Evidence is for
      lawyers and other such carrion birds. Here! Take your
      letters, I say." And again he proffered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically, half-dazed, she put forth her hand to receive
      them. The next moment it was in his grip. She raised her
      glance at last, at this physical contact, and for a long
      moment stared into his eyes that smouldered as they now
      regarded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What a little hand!" he murmured. "So white and slim and
      frail, yet strong enough to hold the destiny of a man. Look
      you, mistress." He was leaning towards her again, still
      clutching that hand which she had not the strength or
      courage to withdraw. "I place the life of Philip Danvelt in
      this white palm, to do with absolutely as you will. Surely,
      you would never have the heart to destroy it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      In a silence of horror she continued to stare at him until,
      swept by a gust of passion, he pulled her roughly from her
      chair into his arms at a single wrench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at last active resistance awakened in her. She battled
      against the enfolding grip of those sinewy arms. Her voice
      rang sharply with authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me go! Let me go at once!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he tightened his coils until he held her paralysed. He
      spoke quietly into her ear, a murmur which at once wooed
      and threatened.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What? And leave your husband in the hangman's hands? Be
      kind, mistress, as you look for kindness in me. One little
      word from you, and Philip Danvelt may have his life and go.
      One little word."
    </p>
    <p>
      With an inarticulate ejaculation of contempt and loathing,
      she partly writhed out of his grip; enough to liberate her
      right arm and hand. In a flash that hand had closed upon
      the hilt of the dagger hanging from his belt. Before he
      could even guess her intent, the blade was out, the point
      descending towards his throat. Within an inch of it, he
      caught her wrist, and with the same grip so twisted it that
      her fingers relaxed their hold and the dagger sped from
      them to clatter on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enraged, he flung her off, and stood glaring at her, whilst
      she braced herself, panting, for whatever brutality might
      be to follow. But his anger cooled. It is even possible
      that her spirited act, exciting his admiration, rendered
      her even more desirable. He smiled at her, none too
      pleasantly; then stooped to take up his dagger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "An ugly claw, mistress, for so fair a hand," he mocked
      her. Then he grew stern. "Come now! I've been gentle and
      played the gallant long enough. Will you pay for this
      attempt upon my life, or shall your husband? It is for you
      to choose."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he advanced upon her until her next words checked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You fill me with horror! You unclean beast!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of his many wooings had been repelled in many ways.
      But never in terms so uncompromisingly unflattering, and,
      as he believed, untrue; for he knew that, when all was
      said, he was a fine figure of a man. The phrase brought him
      up as if it had been a blow. He went white to his suddenly
      sneering lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is it so? Horrifying am I to the dainty fastidiousness
      of a huckstering burgher's wife? Well, well! We must amend
      such unnatural feelings."
    </p>
    <p>
      With an inarticulate ejaculation, shuddering at the sight
      of him, she turned abruptly to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he reached the door ahead of her. With his back to it
      he finally admonished her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look you, mistress. I am not of those who take, as I
      might, what is not freely given. That is not my way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you let me go?" she demanded firmly, only anger and
      contempt in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, mistress, since you insist. But you shall come again
      and soon, or by the eyes of God, I'll stretch the neck of
      your loutish husband without mercy or scruple." He held her
      glance a moment, then turned, flung wide the door, and
      stood aside to let her pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out, her head high, without word or glance or even
      thought for anything but her outraged purity.

    <h1>
      THE FOOL ADVISES
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      His Excellency the Governor of Middelburg dispensed that
      day a stern and expeditious justice. Long before nightfall
      the four burghers impeached of seditious activities had
      been sentenced by him to be hanged. For motives of his own,
      so as to protract the example which this hanging was to
      afford, they were to perish at the rate of one a day for
      the next four days. And he let it be generally known that
      the fifth traitor, Philip Danvelt, whose trial was
      postponed for a further investigation of the evidence,
      would no doubt be sentenced in time to mount the gallows on
      the fifth day.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I desire the town to be purged of treason before Sunday,"
      he had informed the court and the people who thronged it.
    </p>
    <p>
      But when all had gone, he still sat, alone in that great
      hall, brooding in the judgment seat! He knew the futility
      of threatening more than you may perform, and Danvelt's
      case was exercising him. He had been confident that from
      one or the other of those arraigned that day, something
      incriminating Danvelt would have transpired. He had sought
      to obtain it from each, by threats, cajolery, and trickery.
      But all his efforts had drawn so blank that he seriously
      began to ask himself if it might not be that Philip Danvelt
      was innocent, and that the incriminating letter which he
      held was from some other Danvelt than this. He came to
      think that, if this were not indeed the case, Johanna would
      never have brought him letters so that he might compare the
      hands. He might have resolved the doubt by making the
      comparison as she had begged him. He refrained precisely
      because he feared that the comparison would establish
      Danvelt's innocence. And he wanted no proofs of that at
      present.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his aid in his quandary came that emissary of Satan, the
      Fool, entering the great hall abruptly in quest of his
      master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you sit in judgment upon the ghosts of those you've
      hanged?" the Fool hailed him, alluding to the emptiness of
      the place. Atop of his chaperon he had set a cap adorned by
      a peacock's feather three feet long. His inevitable lute
      was slung behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came to perch himself on the edge of the ponderous table
      on the judgment dais under the great red canopy that bore
      the arms of Burgundy. Rhynsault took counsel with him. The
      Fool's long face smiled inscrutably as he listened,
      dangling his skinny legs. His beady eyes were fixed upon
      the toes of his long pointed shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fetched a sigh when he had heard the Governor out.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Faith, the course of true love never did run smooth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love!" bellowed the Governor. "What has love to do with
      it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If love had naught to do with it there would be no
      difficulty. It's like a cough, gossip. It can't be hid. The
      other difficulty, of course, is that you are a man of your
      word. Having informed Mistress Danvelt that failing certain
      amiabilities her husband will hang--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that? Was your ear to the keyhole, you abortion?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My wits are my ears, gossip, and they are ever at the
      keyhole of the world. It is thus that I am informed that
      you are perplexed because, if Danvelt were hanged and
      afterwards proved innocent by this very alert and
      enterprising wife of his, the thing would have its
      awkwardness. The Duke is at times unreasonable. He takes
      narrow views of such adventures as the one that is now
      alluring you."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor raised his hand and drove a blow at the Fool.
      Kuoni ducked to avoid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hold your hand!" he cried. "For if you injure my head,
      you'll injure the only head between us. Listen a moment
      before you give way to violence. Your course is clear and
      simple." The Governor contained his anger at this. "All you
      need to do is to establish Danvelt's guilt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that's the difficulty."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool shook his head slowly. "No difficulty at all.
      You've rack and thumbscrews and all the other implements
      for the extraction of truth. Extract it from Danvelt
      himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if the truth is that he is innocent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is yourself is innocent. The truth to be extracted by
      the rack is of any colour that your needs demand. It is
      only a matter of turning the screw sufficiently. Come,
      come!" The Fool slid off the table. "You've ample grounds
      at law for putting him to the question. Put him to it long
      enough and rigorously enough, and you shall have whatever
      answer you require."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault licked his lips as he considered. Then he banged
      the table with his fist.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should have thought of it!" he exclaimed, and heaved
      himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It needs an acute mind like mine," said Kuoni. "If you had
      my wits to your great body, you would be an emperor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault summoned Diesenhofer, issued his commands, and
      went presently below to see them executed. The Fool went
      with him, to gratify the feral thirst that was a part of
      his warped nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into that vaulted underground chamber with its instruments
      of torture they brought the unfortunate Danvelt to be
      racked, ostensibly because he was conceived guilty of
      sedition, in reality because he was the husband of a
      beautiful and chaste woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had he been aware of this, it might have increased his
      courage and his obstinacy, and he might have resisted an
      ordeal even sterner than that to which he was subjected. As
      it was, he acquitted himself well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stripped to the waist, they placed him under a giant cobweb
      of grey ropes and pulleys. White and scared, but resolved
      nevertheless he answered firmly with a denial when the
      question was put to him in this position. His wrists
      pinioned behind him, and the rope attached to them, the
      question was repeated, the secretary at his pulpit writing
      busily the while. Not only did he persist in denial, but he
      protested against the measures being taken with him, urging
      that there was no evidence to justify it, and that such
      evidence as was urged could easily be proved no evidence at
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of strong thews and great physical vigour, and
      he had the hardy courage usually accompanying these
      physical endowments. He persisted with denial through three
      hoists, and until with dislocated shoulders he lost
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rested him for forty-eight hours, and then stretched
      him on the rack. His body, maimed already, turned traitor
      to his will. Under the exquisite agony his spirit broke. To
      win respite, he returned at last the required affirmative
      to that reiterated question: "Do you confess to having
      written a letter to the convicted traitor Thomas Tegel, in
      which you offered to supply arms and money for the
      projected rising against the government of the Duke's
      highness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The secretary took down his answer. He was removed from the
      rack, and carried back to his prison. On the morrow they
      brought him the confession in a written form that he might
      ratify it, as was by law required. He refused to do so, and
      was racked again. This time, he yielded, and when the
      confession was again put before him, signed it, and so
      signed away his life. Hanging, he thought, and rightly, was
      more easily endured than racking by one in his agonised
      bodily condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in those four days, Mistress Johanna, to the Governor's
      deep surprise and disappointment, had made no sign. Three
      days longer, Rhynsault waited, then on the seventh, Danvelt
      was put upon his public trial, confronted with his
      confession, which made the calling and examination of
      witnesses supererogatory, and sentenced to death, the
      sentence to be carried out upon the following morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault postponed the signing of the warrant until the
      evening, and when he signed it he did so almost as an act
      of anger. He had waited confidently, from the moment that
      the news of sentence had gone abroad, for the return of
      Mistress Johanna. Indeed, it was to bring her that he had
      proceeded to trial and sentence of her husband. He had
      confidently hoped, in his limited knowledge and lack of
      discernment, that she would seek him in such a spirit that
      his signature to the warrant of execution might never be
      required. Because her continued absence brought him a sense
      of defeat, he signed at last in fury, adding a note that
      the sentence be carried out at daybreak. Upon that he went
      to supper without appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool, supping with his master, as was the invariable
      custom, watched him with those beady eyes and that
      impassive solemn face, whilst inwardly his malicious soul
      was shaken with laughter. Here was the great Claude de
      Rhynsault beaten to his knees after having exhausted in
      vain all the brutalities at his command against a poor
      devil of a fellow who was probably quite innocent of the
      crime imputed to him. By the lengths to which he had gone,
      Rhynsault had manoeuvred himself into a position in which
      he was constrained to sacrifice the fellow's life for
      nothing. It was poor comfort to his rage to stretch a neck
      which he had meant only to threaten as a coercive measure.
      The Fool discovered an engaging irony in the situation, and
      inwardly he gloated over the bitterness that he knew to be
      in Rhynsault's disappointed soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke at last upon the Governor's sullen musings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are moody, gossip. Shall I sing to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the mockery was subtle, a suspicion of it reached
      his excellency. He looked sourly and searchingly at the
      Fool, and wondered what thoughts stirred behind that bland
      countenance and those unblinking eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I want no songs," he growled at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let me weep for you, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault made a noise in his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not even that?" said the Fool. "Lackaday! To a crazy ship
      all winds are contrary. Yet I could weep an ocean over the
      abject folly of you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Folly?" Rhynsault turned bloodshot eyes upon him. He was
      clearly dangerous. Yet the Fool had his deep reasons for
      braving the danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Folly, indeed," he insisted. "To have power and to forgo
      its uses is to be like an ass that carries a load of gold
      and yet eats thistles. Shall we change clothes, gossip? You
      might make a poor show in motley. But I in your office
      would know how to use my opportunities. But there! Fortune
      gives nuts to those that have no teeth. An old proverb
      that, and a true one. Lackaday!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No more of your chatter," Rhynsault growled at him, and
      reached for his wine cup. Though he had scarcely touched
      food, he had drunk deeply already!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chatter? That is what wisdom has become in your ears. You
      just sit a-dreaming and a-moping and a-sighing, like a
      child, for the moon."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault set down the empty cup. The matter that had so
      long been simmering in his thoughts suddenly boiled over.
      "She is obstinate as a mule."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then put a bridle on her," came the prompt advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through his teeth Rhynsault answered: "I'm putting a halter
      on her husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And that satisfies you? It brings you what you lack?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The fear of it may do so yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And if it doesn't?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then, let him die and be damned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which is the damnation of your last hope. Lend an ear to
      sound sense, gossip. Hope is a good breakfast, but a bad
      supper; and once you've hanged him, you'll have supped on
      your hopes. You will have consumed your most persuasive
      argument; which is his life. I can't rate the prescription
      highly. But, to be sure, when love is the disease any
      doctor is an ass."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dully Rhynsault looked at him. "You talk and talk," he
      complained sourly. "Sometimes I wonder what purpose you
      serve."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And sometimes you discover it to your own advantage." The
      Fool leaned forward. "What need to have ordered his hanging
      for the morning? That is the haste of vindictiveness, and
      vindictiveness is always stupid. You fail, and I deplore to
      see you fail, particularly when, guided by my wits, you
      might so easily succeed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Succeed?" The bloodshot eyes grew more inflamed. In that
      hour there was hardly a price that Rhynsault would not have
      paid for success. His desires had been so kindled by
      thwarting that they were burning up his reason. "Show me
      the way to that, and I'll overlook your insolence."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now here's a rich reward! No matter! I give it not for
      guerdon, but from the generosity of my nature. In your
      place I would have postponed sentence and very graciously
      sent word to Mistress Johanna that she is permitted to come
      and visit her unfortunate husband. You've left him in
      pitiful case, a man burnt to the socket. His condition must
      awaken her compassion, and compassion is a very melting
      emotion. It could do no harm, and might
      accomplish--anything." He paused, and considered the
      Governor, who sat in sullen silence, his chin upon his
      breast. "That is what I should have advised had you
      consulted me. Unfortunately you did not, and now it is too
      late."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault reared his head at that. "Too late?" he echoed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As if to answer him, a servant entered. Mistress Johanna
      Danvelt was now below, and begged the Governor to grant her
      audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mistress Johanna!" The Governor heaved himself up. His
      face lighted with an evil satisfaction. He looked across at
      the Fool and laughed. "Too late, eh?" he mocked him. Then
      to the servant: "Bring her up. Nay, wait." He grew suddenly
      cunning. He would stretch her will upon the rack of
      suspense until it snapped under the strain. "Say to her
      that I am immersed in affairs; but that if she will wait a
      while I will endeavour to spare her a moment. More is
      impossible. Let her wait in the hall."
    </p>
    <p>
      The lackey withdrew to bear the message. Rhynsault poured
      himself more wine, and laughed again, deep in his throat.
      "Too late, eh?" he mocked the Fool. "Too late, is it, you
      well of wisdom."
    </p>
    <p>
      His satisfaction awoke the malice of Kuoni. He would give
      it pause. He would plant an uneasy thought and perhaps
      something more in the dull brain of the Burgundian
      lieutenant. For like a skilled chessplayer, Kuoni perceived
      by several moves what might ultimately follow his present
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Laugh your fill, gossip. But too late it is. The warrant
      is signed, the hanging as good as performed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "He's not hanged yet."
    </p>
    <p>
      "No. But the fact is published that he confessed his guilt
      upon the rack. The court has sentenced him to death. It
      could do no less. As a consequence, you have signed the
      warrant. You could do no less. What, then, have you to
      offer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His reprieve, you numbskull."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool grinned his pity. "You'ld reprieve a man who has
      confessed to supplying the rebels with arms and money, and
      upon whom you have passed sentence? A nice tale that for
      the ears of the Duke of Burgundy."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault looked at him with eyes of wonder and wrath
      touched by a certain uneasiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was it not yourself advised me to wring the confession out
      of him by these means?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But not to publish it. Not to make it the ground upon
      which to sentence him in open court. There your own
      vindictiveness, your own fidelity to your rashly plighted
      word, is alone to blame."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault drank again. Thereafter: "Bah!" he said. "What's
      a burgher more or less that the Duke should trouble about
      him whatever I decide?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet in your shoes I should walk warily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Caution is not my habit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Alas, no! Yet caution, gossip, makes an excellent
      body-servant." He rose. "I'll be going. You can supply
      enough folly of your own in what's to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault gave him leave by a nod. At the door, Kuoni
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A last word of advice," said he. "A philosophical fragment
      for your study: Take all you may, give nothing more than
      you must. Weigh that well. It is pregnant with the wisdom
      of the ages. And let the lady wait yet awhile. Suitors cool
      with waiting. She may heed a word from me in passing, and
      that, too, may help! A happy night to you, gossip."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went out, closing the door after him. With his shoulders
      to it, he looked down the long hall, now full of shadows,
      and to the island of light by the table in the middle of
      it, where Johanna sat. Behind her stood her two servants,
      Jan, old and lean and tough, and Peter, stalwart, young,
      and vigorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat with her fur-edged cloak wrapped tightly about her
      to repress her shivering which sprang not only from the
      chill of the place. She was tormented at once by
      apprehension for her husband and memories associated with
      this very hall in which to-night she waited, a stricken
      suppliant. Those memories of another night, in this place,
      three months ago, came crowding thick upon her, to be
      transmuted by her too sensitive conscience into a cause
      from which the present dread effect was sprung. It was in
      this very hall, to-night so chill and dank and gloomy, but
      then a scene of brilliance, the like of which she had never
      formerly beheld, that she had last seen Count Anthony.
      Vividly the eyes of her mind beheld him again, first on the
      dais, leaning familiarly upon the back of the Duke's chair
      of state, later bowing before her and addressing her,
      inviting her to go forth by those doors, now closed and
      barred, into the fragrant gardens beyond, which now were
      desolate in the grip of an early winter, akin to the
      desolation and winter in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, perhaps, was her punishment, for having undutifully
      listened to a lover's words, and thus, having been
      unfaithful to her marriage vows. Her presence here again
      was the only amend she could make. She would brave the
      insults of Rhynsault's gross, carnal wooing, that she might
      stay his murderous hand by pleading and perhaps even by
      threatening. Her duty to her husband demanded no less of
      her. It must in any case have demanded it. It demanded it
      all the more because of her earlier departure from that
      duty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool, considering her from the shadows about the
      Governor's threshold, was oddly enough assailed by memories
      akin to her own. He, too, remembered that tepid August
      night when they had been so gay and festive at the
      Gravenhof, and the particular attention paid this lovely
      woman by the austere Count Anthony of Guelders, who had
      conducted her forth and sought privacy with her in the
      scented gloom of the garden. The Fool speculated again, as
      he had speculated already, upon the link between that
      brilliant prince and this simple burgher's daughter and
      burgher's wife. He had planted a suggestion in the mind of
      the Governor to the end that the Governor might ensnare the
      truth from her; this because the Fool saw a certain use to
      be made of the knowledge. But Rhynsault was a clumsy
      numbskull who had not known how to act upon the suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool's arachnidial mind was busy about the spinning of
      a tentative web of evil. His crooked soul glowed with
      satisfaction at his skill and the end which he foresaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      He moved down the hall on his spidery legs, and came into
      the island of light about the table. He bowed his grotesque
      dwarfish figure before Mistress Danvelt, who stiffened as
      she might have done at the approach of a snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice cooed softly. "His excellency will not long keep
      your loveliness waiting."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him without answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If meanwhile there is aught you lack ..." His gesture
      implied that she had but to command. "His excellency would
      have you at your ease."
    </p>
    <p>
      Still there was no answer from her beyond that dread
      fascinated stare of her blue eyes. A little in the
      background her servants looked on, and their glances,
      particularly Jan's, were lowering. But Kuoni paid little
      heed to them; his attention was upon Johanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, mistress," he urged. "Take heart. Here you have
      nothing to fear." He approached her by another step, and
      stood now very close to her, his head, although she was
      sitting and he standing, scarcely above the level of her
      own. "You are come, as I conceive, in the hope of averting
      the doom pronounced to-day upon your husband." He paused a
      moment, to add rapidly: "Why should you merely hope for
      that which it is within your power to govern?"
    </p>
    <p>
      That stirred her to speech at last. "Do you mock me?" she
      asked him witheringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mock!" He raised hands and eyes. "Heaven be my witness, I
      would be your friend and help you in your need."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was incredible that any good should come out of this
      creature whose exudations of evil were instinctively
      apprehended. Yet in her desperate case, clutching at
      straws, she troubled to question his assertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You help me? You? The Governor's man?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered her with a truth that went deeper than she or
      any could have guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am no man's man, if, indeed, I am a man at all. Whatever
      I am, mistress, I have the wit to belong to myself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you would help me?" She looked deep into those
      inscrutable beady eyes. "Why?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? As I do all things. For the interest I derive from
      it; the interest and the diversion. Look at me well. I am
      as hideous almost, mistress, as you are beautiful. But to
      compensate me for my lack of comeliness, I am master of the
      rarer gifts of wisdom and knowledge. Yet did I use those
      gifts no better that you use your beauty, I must have
      starved long since, or have perished even more miserably."
      He paused, and for once a faint expression crept into the
      mask of his face, an expression of contempt. "You move
      through life a pious, plangent thing of snivelling
      intercession. You know no way to your ends but prayer. You
      pray to man for the things that you would have, and, when
      man fails you, you pray to God, who fails you likewise. O
      mistress, were I a woman and had I your beauty, I'Id so
      transmute that beauty into power that the world should be
      my footstool."
    </p>
    <p>
      She put forth a hand in a gesture at once of dismissal and
      appeal. "Please leave me. You--you bewilder me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To be sure," said he, more briskly. "Wisdom is ever
      bewildering. I'll be plainer. You wish to save your husband
      from the hangman?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know that that is why I am here. I have come to
      plead--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Harshly, almost fiercely he interrupted her. "To plead! Of
      course, to plead! That is your way, as I have said. To
      plead! To plead where you should command."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Command? I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He leaned towards her, setting his elbow on the arm of her
      chair, and crossing his legs, so that he looked more
      grotesque and distorted than Nature had fashioned him. As
      he spoke, rapidly now, he used his hands freely in gesture,
      hands of long fingers and big knuckles, disproportionately
      large.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Listen, mistress. For a week Philip Danvelt's life has
      hung in the balance. In that week what have you done? To be
      sure, you have worn your lovely eyes red with weeping, and
      your shapely knees red with praying to an unresponsive
      Heaven. But what practical thing have you done to effect
      the rescue of your husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst marvelling with herself that she should trouble to
      answer this mocking thing of evil, yet she answered him out
      of a desperate hope that from all his evil some little good
      might yet come to her, if unawares.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What could I do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You could not bring yourself to pay the price that
      Rhynsault asks, because my lord is a gross fellow,
      artlessly clumsy in his wooing as in all else, a
      heavy-handed lout who crushes the delicate fruit he
      touches." He paused, and his face was turned fully to hers,
      his unblinking eyes looked into her own. "But was there
      none other to whom you might have turned in all that wasted
      week?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had shrunk back from him a little during his speech, as
      far, indeed, as the confines of her chair permitted. "I
      know of none," she said, still clinging to the hope that he
      was about to point the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Think now! Think!" he urged her, watching her keenly the
      while. "What of one, handsome and radiant as a prince of
      faerie, a noble and puissant gentleman, a mirror of
      chivalry, self-appointed protector of the oppressed? One
      who once served your husband in his extremity?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Count Anthony!" she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool chuckled, and straightened himself from his
      fantastic attitude. "Behold how quickly he leaps to your
      mind, mistress!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him, a deathly pallor in her face, yet
      something of indignation in her eyes. He laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so austere, this Count Anthony of Guelders, as repute
      pretends! Not above treading a garden path on a summer's
      night with the lovely lady of a Flemish burgher. My Lord
      Rhynsault had best go warily with his exalted Chastity for
      a rival."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat appalled. So that indiscretion of hers was not
      buried as she supposed in her own heart. This evil creature
      had seen enough to infer more. And as with him, so, no
      doubt, with others. How much had they seen, indeed, and how
      much in their vileness did they surmise? Indignation surged
      up in her, but it was indignation on the Count's behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You dare to insult one who is as pure and noble as you are
      abominable and evil!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But what self-betraying on the pretty gentleman's behalf!"
      he mocked her. "O Piety, thy name is slyness!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A hand fell on his shoulder, and held him in a crushing
      grip. Jan's voice growled in his ear. "Venomous toad! I'll
      crush the poison out of you once and for all time."
    </p>
    <p>
      Johanna was on her feet. "Let him go, Jan! Let him go!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The command, sternly delivered, was, however, scarcely
      necessary. The Fool had twisted himself out of that grasp
      and spun nimbly round to face the groom, a snarl on his
      pale lips, the livid gleam of steel in his right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It were wiser," he said viciously. "There's a nasty sting
      about me that makes me dangerous to handle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven!" said Jan. "I'll take my chance of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      And, ignoring both the command and the threat, he was
      advancing again upon the Fool, when down the hall rang a
      brisk metallic voice to check him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of what will you take your chance, sirrah?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault came slowly into view from the shadows about the
      doorway of his closet. He continued to speak as he
      advanced.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well? Of what do you take your chance? Let me tell you.
      You take your chance of a whipping when you raise your
      voice in here, you dog."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was level now with the grinning Fool. "Were you baiting
      him, Kuoni?" he asked, and took the Fool by the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Baiting him!" said the Fool. "God give me patience with
      you, gossip! Since when have you known me whet my wit on
      lumps of Flemish earth?"
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Governor, retaining that grip of his ear, lugged
      him forward almost to the feet of Johanna.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I trust, mistress, that this malapert Fool of mine has not
      been giving you annoyance."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, that--that is no matter, sir." She was suddenly
      breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are too clement. Whatever befall your husband, there
      is no charge against you, and I will have none offend you."
      He let the Fool go, nevertheless. "I had hoped, mistress,
      that you would have come before: before we were constrained
      by duty to go to extremes where your husband is concerned.
      Still, better late than never, as the proverb runs." He
      raised his voice to call. "Who waits?"
    </p>
    <p>
      An officer clanked in by the great doors which stood open
      at the hall's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To command, Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Governor waved a hand towards Johanna's servants:
      "Conduct these knaves below, and let them wait there."
    </p>
    <p>
      Johanna interposed. "By your excellency's leave, I should
      prefer them to remain."
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed surprised. "Mistress, I have that to say to you .
      . . touching your husband . . . which is not for the ears
      of lackeys."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your excellency can have nothing to say to me that may not
      be said before them."
    </p>
    <p>
      He admired her spirit; a spirit worth the conquering, he
      thought, whose conquest might afterwards be dwelt upon with
      pride. Gravely he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not my way, mistress, to open my mind before grooms.
      They go hence alone, or they go hence with you, at your
      pleasure; but they go hence at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause in which she fought down her loathing and
      her dread, a battle of which the only sign was the twisting
      and untwisting of her hands. At last she yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well," she said, as calmly as she might. "Go wait
      below for me, Jan."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Jan, that old and faithful servant, pervaded on her
      behalf with that loathing and that dread to an extent
      scarcely less than her own, ventured to advise her. To him
      Philip's life was as nothing compared with the least hurt
      to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come away, mistress," he muttered urgently. "Come away
      home with us."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was cold and stern with him. "Go, Jan!" she said
      shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant seemed to shrink together a little. He made a
      mute gesture of despair, half-raising his hands, and then
      letting them fall heavily to his sides. He shrugged
      despondently, turned on his heel, and with Peter stalked
      down the long hall under the officer's escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault turned to the Fool. "Well? Why do you wait? You
      are not wanted here."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool grinned. "Am I not? As usual, gossip, you are
      wrong. You never needed me more urgently or the thing I
      could tell you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will keep till morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So it will. But by morning it will be too late."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So much the better, then. Begone!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're wasting breath. I've no mind to linger, or to talk.
      I only mention that there is a thing I could tell if I were
      so inclined, which--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Begone!" the Governor roared at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am gone," he was answered in a laugh. "Ever have I been
      your friend, and it were unkind now to let a thought of the
      morrow mar the sweetness of your night."
    </p>
    <p>
      He skipped out. From beyond the door they heard his voice
      receding in the distance, singing:
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Flout not Love, for Love will not<br>
      Suffer it, I warn you.<br>
      Love is soon by Love begot;<br>
      Life is cold where Love is not;<br>
      So take you Love to warm you.<br>
      Ha, ha, ha ha! To warm you."
    </blockquote>

      RHYNSAULT'S BUCKLER
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Within his snug closet, whither he conducted her, the
      Governor considerately desired Mistress Danvelt to sit, and
      would have relieved her of her fur-edged cloak but that she
      clung to the garment, urging that her business was but
      brief and would not consume much of his time. Abruptly she
      came to it. They had brought her word of the sentence
      passed that day upon her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. "Your concern comes a little late, mistress." He
      stood quite close to her, half-sitting upon, half-leaning
      against the heavy table. He looked down upon her with eyes
      that glowed out of a face which he schooled into lines of
      kindliness. "You know that it is for to-morrow morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      No need to ask him what. His meaning was plain enough.
      Panic fluttered her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes. That is what they told me. But you dare not. You dare
      not!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered her for a long moment. Then he spread his
      hands, his whole attitude expressive of dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your distress moves me profoundly," he said slowly. "I did
      not think that it could mean so much to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You did not think . . . ?" She was between surprise and
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What cause did you give me to think it? I placed Danvelt's
      life in your hands. Did I not offer to set him free at a
      little word from you? Before the trial, it would have been
      so easy. Now!" He hunched his shoulders, paused, and then
      resumed: "And you have had a whole week in which to speak
      that word. Since you haven't chosen to speak it, what was I
      to suppose? Why, that, like so many wives, you would count
      yourself well rid of an importunate husband."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up into that handsomely florid countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is noble," she said. "It is generous to mock an
      unfortunate woman in the hour of her affliction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not mock," he assured her in words which his very
      glance belied. "If it is not as I have supposed, why did
      you not come before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She answered him firmly, for all her mental anguish.
      "Because, knowing him innocent, I did not believe it
      possible you could find him guilty. I waited confidently
      for his trial; for I believed that in the Duke's judgment
      seat you dealt in justice; that you would not dare to deal
      in anything else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were right. I have dealt in nothing else."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Close upon twenty witnesses waited to testify. They were
      brought here in answer to my appeal and you were informed
      of it. They could have spoken to my husband's character and
      pursuits. They could have proved beyond question that he
      did not write the letter upon which you arraigned him. Yet
      those witnesses were denied a hearing."
    </p>
    <p>
      "To have heard them would but have wasted time. The
      evidence of your husband's guilt was complete!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes burned in her white face. "Complete? Why, what a
      poor pretence is that? Will you maintain it before the face
      of the Duke your master, as you may yet have to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He frowned, but his full lips still smiled. "You threaten,
      mistress?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else did you expect of me? I threaten that which I
      shall not hesitate to fulfil. Am I to be mocked with your
      pretence of justice? Is the Duke to be mocked by your
      defilement of his justice? I am a poor, weak woman, you
      suppose, capable only of pleading. Well, I may go plead
      elsewhere, and you know the tale I shall have to tell: you
      know the motive I shall have to disclose; the real motive
      which urges you along this path of infamy. Didn't you make
      it clear to me a week ago in this room, when you refused to
      consider any evidence, when you--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When I placed your husband's life in your hands, to do
      with as you wished," he interrupted, unmoved by her
      threats. "It is you, not I, who send him to the hangman in
      the morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment before she could answer him, stricken dumb
      by her indignation and her crushing sense of impotence.
      When at last she found her tongue again, it was to pour
      words of bitter scorn upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a great soldier! A captain of renown! The Duke of
      Burgundy's trusted representative! Holder of the sacred
      office of justiciary! And yet you can stoop from your high
      place to such ignoble depths, accounting no means too base
      to win to your evil ends!" Her voice swelled up in scorn.
      "I imagined you a high-handed, masterful villain. But you
      are not even that. You are just a paltry rascal on the
      level of the thief, the forger, the utterer of base coin.
      You misuse your office to entangle my husband in a net of
      lies, and you shut out the evidence that would have torn
      that net to shreds. But I warn you! I warn you solemnly, my
      Lord Rhynsault, that, if you persist in this infamy, the
      Duke your master shall be fully informed and you shall be
      brought to account to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      She had risen, leaving her fur-edged cloak of blue velvet
      on the chair, and stood before him, a slim, white-clad
      figure with flaming eyes and heaving breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered appraisingly the white delicate beauty of
      her, and marvelled at the restraint he imposed upon
      himself. For never had she seemed to him more desirable
      than now in this white heat of righteous anger. But he had
      a part to play, a check to administer, which he thought
      should bring her to her knees, whence it should be his
      glory to uplift her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Saints give me patience with you, mistress! If it was
      lies entangled Philip Danvelt, the lies were his own."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His own? His own?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "His own. He confessed his treason; and he set his
      signature to the confession, which was written down in a
      measure as he uttered it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a blow between the eyes to her. Her anger was
      shouldered out by dismay and growing terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confessed?" she echoed, gasping, faltering. "He confessed,
      you say? What did he confess?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That he had written the letter upon which I impeached him;
      that he had supplied arms and money to equip the rebels."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that is not true!" she wailed. "It's not true! How,
      then, could he confess it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He should know the truth of it better than you, mistress."
      Rhynsault now affected a tone of regret. "All that you can
      say is that he never took you into his confidence in the
      matter. It is not likely that he would have done so. Shrewd
      men do not tell secrets to their women-folk, especially
      secrets that will put a rope about their necks."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I was not alone in my belief, in my knowledge," she
      answered, battling desperately against the odds that were
      suddenly heaped against her. "The letter was not in his
      hand. Twenty of the witnesses could have sworn to that. If
      he confessed--" She broke off. Suddenly she saw the
      explanation, and cried out in horror: "You tortured him!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault shrugged and pursed his lips. "He was put to the
      question. It is the usual practice. On the rack, he
      confessed, as commonly happens when a man is guilty. What,
      then, is to tell the Duke my master? That I hanged a man
      who avowed himself a rebel?" He laughed softly. "You see,
      good mistress, you threaten me with thunderbolts of lath."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the foundation of menace upon which she had built so
      confidently gave way under her feet. She half-turned from
      him, with a little moan of pain, and swayed as she stood
      there. He had beaten her down, indeed. Not even vengeance
      remained, so that it was idle to threaten him with it in
      the hope of averting her unfortunate husband's doom. And
      the horrible thought arose slowly in her mind, further to
      torture her agonised spirit, that it was she had been the
      innocent means of bringing this doom upon poor Philip.
    </p>
    <p>
      She reeled to the chair, and sank limply into it, her limbs
      momentarily bereft of strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "O God, pity him!" she cried. "You wrenched him limb from
      limb, until, in his agony and to obtain respite from your
      cruelty, he confessed a falsehood that has given you power
      over his life. And this because--because--O God!" She sank
      her face into her hands, her body convulsively shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still half-sitting on the table's edge, he watched her with
      those smouldering eyes, the ghost of a smile about his
      lips. Then he reached forth, and set a hand upon her
      shoulder. He spoke very softly, in a tone of gentle
      remonstrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was in your power to save him," he reminded her; and
      added, after a moment's pause: "For that matter, it still
      is. Even now, even at this eleventh hour, you can have his
      life if you will. The hand that signed the death warrant
      can sign the reprieve. If you have come to speak the little
      word I begged of you, you have not come in vain."
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her hands from her face, and turned to look up
      at him again, loathing and defiance in her glance. "I have
      not," she told him fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not? Why else, then, have you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She relapsed into the weakness from which she had
      momentarily arisen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is there no pity in you?" she cried. "Is there no fear
      either of man or God in your dark soul? What do you look to
      gain by sending my husband to his death? Nothing, nothing,
      nothing! What shall it profit you to leave me widowed? What
      satisfaction shall you have from that? Is that a man's
      worthy vengeance upon a woman whose only offence against
      him is her virtue? You do not fear the justice of your
      Duke, you say. My husband's confession is your buckler. But
      have you no fear of the justice of God? What shield will
      avail you against that when your hour comes? Will you
      imperil your immortal soul for this empty satisfaction you
      are contemplating?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault moved from the edge of the table, swung round to
      confront her, squarely planted upon his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Look you, madam, I have listened long enough. If you are
      come to deafen me with words, to weary me with a sermon
      upon heaven and hell, you distress yourself in vain. Heaven
      and hell have nothing to do with us at present. We are upon
      earth, we two, and alive. Talk to me of this, and I will
      listen. For the rest, I do not want your husband's life. It
      is the law that claims it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are the law in Middelburg."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Its minister only. If I were to check it now, and set your
      husband free, I should be false to my duty as the Duke's
      lieutenant here. Yet, for your sake, I would do even that."
      He paused a moment to add: "But I have my price. And you
      know it, mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      With hands clenched between her knees and lowered eyes, and
      in a half-strangled voice she answered him. "Yes, I know
      it. And I know that if I paid that price, my husband would
      curse and abominate the life I had so purchased for him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you so sure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sure? Am I sure?" She looked up at him in scornful wonder.
      "I am sure that my husband is a good, honest man,
      reverencing purity."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet life is very sweet," the Governor reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honour is sweeter to honourable men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault leaned down a little from his fine height. He
      spoke persuasively. "What need he know, since you are so
      tender of his feelings? A thing done in secret is as a
      thing not done at all."
    </p>
    <p>
      That brought her to her feet in a noble rage. "You pitiful
      knave! You infamous villain!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He flushed, but kept his temper. "If I am that, it is love
      has made me so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Love?" She flung the word at him in deepest scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, love," he insisted. "Love such as you have never
      known."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And never shall, please God," she answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long moment he stood meeting the defiance of her
      glance, pondering the lissom grace of her figure so stiffly
      erect, the proud poise of her golden head, the distracting,
      maddening beauty of her delicate face. The wolf was aroused
      in him, yet dominated by the perception that to prevail he
      must here play the fox. He commanded himself, clenching his
      hands until the nails bit into his palms. He smiled a
      little, very wistfully, and fetched a sigh that was pure
      artifice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So! You are resolved, then, to let him die?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have prayed to our Father in Heaven to purge the evil
      from your heart, to let the light of grace fall upon your
      soul before it is too late, before--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke in. "You pray for a miracle which your own will
      can accomplish." His self-control was slipping from him.
      Whipped on by the scorpion whips of his desire, he advanced
      upon her with open arms. "Johanna!" he cried, and there was
      a hoarse note of pleading in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      She recoiled before him. "Don't touch me! Don't dare to
      touch me with your evil hands!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He checked. He was white to the lips, and the sweat stood
      in beads upon his brow, just below the line of his sleek
      black hair. The purity and saintliness of her opposed to
      him a resistance almost physical, a resistance which he
      could not beat down by brutish force. He spoke through his
      teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ask for mercy with the voice of cruelty. Can you hope
      that your prayer will be heard?" Abruptly he gave up the
      contest, a man defeated. He strode to the door, flung it
      wide, and called the officer of the guard by name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cassaignac!"
    </p>
    <p>
      A voice answered from the distance. Approaching steps rang
      hollow in the vast hall outside. Turning where he stood,
      Rhynsault spoke to her in dismissal, harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You had best return home, madam. Here is no more to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      Confronting this finality, her panic momentarily returned.
      "Ah, no, no! Wait! Wait!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His white face sneered at her. "Wait!" he echoed. "I have
      waited already a week. I am a man of short moods, madam.
      Yet I have stood here with a patience that I hardly
      recognise for my own, whilst you have heaped insults upon
      me, and threatened me with vengeances temporal and
      spiritual--what am I to wait for now? Another sermon?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer surged on the threshold. With a shrug Rhynsault
      turned away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cassaignac, you may reconduct this lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      She staggered where she stood, one hand clutching her
      heart. Then, controlling herself, realising indeed that all
      was lost, that she had suffered insult in vain, that
      further intercession or delay were worse than idle, she
      gathered up her long cloak of blue velvet from the chair,
      and drew it about her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaden-footed she moved towards the door and the waiting
      officer. Midway she halted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'll give me leave to see my husband before--before he
      suffers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the malice of his rage a denial leapt to his lips,
      to be thrust down again by the memory of something the Fool
      had said, a piece of advice which he had forgotten until
      this moment, of which it had been necessary that she should
      remind him. His eyes kindled again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why should I deny you that? But time grows short. If you
      would see him, you had best see him now. At once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Without awaiting her reply, he ordered Cassaignac to bring
      Danvelt from his prison and allow him to have speech alone
      with his wife in the hall. Then he held the door for her
      whilst she passed out to await the coming of her husband.

    </p>
    <p>
      If her little time of waiting was an agony, the first sight
      of him when at last they brought him to her was even worse.
      He was scarcely recognisable for the man he had been a week
      ago. The healthy fullness of his cheeks was gone; the great
      bony structures of his face stood gauntly forth from the
      stretched yellow skin, and his eyes, which seemed to have
      receded in their sockets, burned feverishly; even his
      incipient paunch had shrunk completely. He no longer walked
      with that slight, swaggering roll and the forward thrust of
      his chin, but moved slowly and stiffly, bending forward
      like an old man. He wore no pourpoint, and over a shirt
      that was soiled and stained with sweat and blood they had
      thrown a cloak. His yellow hair was tousled and
      dishevelled.
    </p>
    <p>
      That first sight of him wrought in her such an uprush of
      pity and womanly tenderness that she ran to meet him, to
      enfold him in her arms. But he almost shrieked in her
      embrace, whereupon her arms were instantly relaxed and
      melted from him. She fell back in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You--you hurt me!" he gasped, and added the explanation:
      "I have been racked until I am one living ache." He looked
      at her fearfully with those burning eyes about which the
      shadows were so heavy. "What are you doing here, Johanna?
      Here in hell?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She could do no more than murmur his name, her soul flooded
      by compassion and distress. Very gently she conducted him
      to a leather chair set by the table in that little island
      of light. Cassaignac and the men who had brought him went
      out, and the two were alone in that vast place of gloom and
      chilliness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He mumbled explanations to her. "I endured as much as flesh
      and bone could bear. Then when I could endure no more, when
      I was stark mad with pain ...I threw away my life to buy a
      moment's ease. I said what they wanted me to say. I would
      have said anything, anything that was required of me. I
      confessed that I had written that letter to that man . . .
      What is his name? I have forgotten it. No matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was kneeling beside him, an arm very gently set about
      his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so you put it into this villain's power to murder you
      with safety to himself."
    </p>
    <p>
      He started violently and looked round, an abject creature,
      utterly broken in spirit by the breaking of his body. "Sh!"
      he hissed in craven alarm. "Take care! For pity's sake!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Care of what? Dear Heaven, what have I to care for, to
      hope for, or to fear? And as for you, my poor Philip? What
      more can they do to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered, and his head hung limply on his breast. "They
      have told you, then?" he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Governor sent me word. That is why I am here. I came
      to plead with him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Plead?" His lips writhed. He kept his voice low, but the
      bitterness of it came clearly enough. "As well might some
      poor damned soul plead with the Devil for release from
      hell, as man or woman plead for pity with my Lord
      Rhynsault."
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her, and from his self-pity he gathered now a
      tenderness which had never been part of his normal self.
      "My little wife! We were so happy and at peace with all the
      world! So happy, my Johanna!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was like a sword of reproach to her, this insistence
      upon their happiness, when in her heart she knew that her
      sole happiness had been in her illicit dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A week ago," he babbled on in his weak, plaintive voice,
      "we hadn't a single care to trouble the sweetness of our
      lives. To-morrow . . . !" He broke off, shuddering
      violently again. Then, through his teeth in his impotent
      rage, he cried: "Is there no God, that a devil such as that
      should walk the earth, wrecking men's lives?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hush, dearest! There is a God. Place your trust in Him. He
      will sustain you, Philip, and He will avenge you. Oh, be
      sure that He will avenge this wickedness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost he sneered. "Will that give me back my life? Will it
      . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      In anguished thought for his soul, she checked him. "Don't,
      Philip! Don't, my dear. God's ways are mysterious ways to
      us. Trust in Him now. He will not forsake you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was silent awhile, bowed and limp. "I am so broken and
      distraught." he complained weakly, tears in his voice.
      "When I look back on all that was; on the perfection of our
      happiness, so wantonly destroyed, I ...I am driven mad."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her sudden weeping recalled him in some measure to himself.
      He put forth a feeble hand to touch her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, now, Johanna! Nay, now! Don't weep! Don't! Help me .
      . . help me to be strong. I need strength, God knows."
    </p>
    <p>
      She controlled herself. "There is strength in prayer. Shall
      we pray together. Philip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, together," he agreed. "For the last time together. For
      the last time!" And then panic took him and convulsed him.
      "To-morrow!" His voice was hoarse with horror. He broke
      forth into frenzied protests, in dreadful, unreasoning,
      impotent revolt against the doom that was overtaking him.
      "Oh, why should I die? Why must I die?" He rocked now in a
      mental anguish that extinguished bodily pain. "Is there no
      power to save me, no power to help? Is there no escape from
      this horror?" His terrified gaze was upon her, appealing to
      her. "Am I to be butchered like a sheep because a
      self-sufficient fool of a Governor has blundered? Is there
      no help for me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Only in prayer, Philip, dear," she answered him,
      distraught by his agony, holding herself in hand by a
      supreme effort because of his great need for strength in
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was petulant almost. "How can I pray? How can you ask me
      to pray? Why did you come, Johanna? You should not have
      come. I was man enough until I saw you. Your coming
      has--has made a child of me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How could I not come?" She spoke in tones calculated to
      soothe his unreason. "How could I refrain from attempting
      to move that dreadful man? I warned him that God's
      vengeance will overtake him. But such as he are dead of
      soul. He only mocked my warnings."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet he allowed you to see me. That at least was
      considerate in him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes; he is considerate; considerate to himself," she
      answered with incautious bitterness, "thinking to further
      his evil hopes."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hopes?" He stared at her. "What hopes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That--that is no matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was not to be put off. There was something here he
      did not understand; something that she withheld. Her tone
      had betrayed it; her tone and that word "hopes," with its
      suggestion of infinite possibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What hopes had he? Tell me. You must tell me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Kneeling beside him, she sank back until she was sitting on
      her heels. Her hands folded in her lap, and her eyes
      lowered, she answered him, speaking very quietly, almost
      emotionlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You do not dream, Philip, out of what vileness is woven
      the net in which you are taken. It is a net, Philip, in
      which you are not so much the victim as the lure."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lure? What do you mean? What lure?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She lowered her voice until it was hardly more than a
      whisper, so that he had to strain to catch her words. "He
      offered me your--life--at a price."
    </p>
    <p>
      Danvelt gasped. He could hardly believe his ears. Hope was
      suddenly reborn in him. It throbbed through his being,
      shortening his breath, deepening if possible the pallor of
      his ghastly cheeks. "What--what do you mean?" His voice
      quavered. "Do you mean that he offered to sell you my life?
      Why, then, in that case . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      At once she perceived that the mischief of hope she had
      wrought did but add to his mental torment. A sob convulsed
      her, a sob of pity for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, but the price, my dear!" she cried, assuming that from
      her very tone he must guess the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his wits, never penetrating, were now as blunt as lead.
      "Price?" he echoed, his voice going suddenly shrill. "What
      price could be too high to pay for life?" Excitement grew
      in him. "Does that covetous captain want all our wealth?
      Then yield it to him, yield all so that I may live. You'ld
      suffer poverty with me so that . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him, her hands now clutching the arms of
      his chair, her tear-stained face upturned to his. "Can you
      dream I should have hesitated had it been but that? Oh,
      don't you understand? The price he proposed to me was to be
      paid by me. By me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stared at her, and slowly understanding pierced those
      heavy wits of his. The light of hope perished in his eyes,
      like a candle that is blown out. He covered his face with
      his emaciated hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The dog!" she heard him mutter. "The foul Burgundian dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a spell of silence, at the end of which she spoke
      very softly and gently. "You see, my dear. You could never
      have forgiven it, or ...or done other than loathe me if I
      had paid such a price as that for your life."
    </p>
    <p>
      To which his only answer was to echo that last word:
      "Life!" Uncovering his face, he stared straight before him
      with unseeing eyes. Presently he asked a question: "And
      you? What . . . what did you answer him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As you would have me answer."
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly he nodded. "You refused."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I told him that, if I paid that price, I must be as
      detestable afterwards in your eyes as in my own; that you
      would curse the life I had so bought for you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made no answer. He continued to sit there staring
      straight before him into vacancy, into realms visible only
      to the eyes of his spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is the truth, Philip, dear," she said presently,
      irked by his silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still he neither moved nor answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Isn't it?" she asked him, more sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered woodenly: "Is it? Perhaps . . . perhaps it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Perhaps!" It was a cry that re-echoed through that vaulted
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      It startled him. He stirred, looked at her and away again.
      Then he pressed his hands convulsively to his brow. He
      spoke in a voice of dull passion. "Oh, I don't know! I
      don't know! My brains are as broken as my body."
    </p>
    <p>
      This she understood, she thought. She was conscious of a
      little pang that even in his condition such things should
      need to be made clear. She attempted to do so, by little
      more than a reiteration of what already she had said; but
      this time she put it almost questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet, my dear, if I had done this thing, you would have
      cursed me afterwards for my unfaith."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would I?" he asked. He was staring into vacancy again,
      away from her. "How could I? How could I have cursed you?
      The thing if done--would have been done--for my sake. An
      act of--of sacrifice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A sacrifice of infamy, of shame," she urged.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet I should have lived." He spoke like a man in a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      She wrestled with his weakness. "To abominate your life; to
      loathe me once I were defiled."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Defiled? Ah, no! How could you be . . ." Then at last, the
      man in him asserted himself. "Yes, yes!" he cried. "You are
      right! You are right! It is unthinkable! Better a thousand
      times that I should hang!" And then, as if the very
      utterance of the word brought back the horror of its
      meaning to drown all else, he repeated it in shuddering
      awe: "Hang!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It bore a message to her, a clear, unmistakable message, a
      prayer from this husband against whom she had offended, in
      the first place by taking him to husband whilst withholding
      a wife's love, in the second by having bestowed that love
      elsewhere and avowed it since her marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came slowly to her feet, a tumult of thought
      distracting her, deepest affliction in her face. Yet she
      spoke quietly, in a measured voice of enforced calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There is nothing, Philip, that I would not do to serve
      you; no sacrifice I would not now make for you, save one.
      And even this one I would make at your own bidding; but
      only at your bidding; so that afterwards you should have no
      right to spurn or reproach me, since the act would then be
      more yours than mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bid you?" he cried. "I bid you commit this infamy against
      yourself? This horror?" He paused, wrestling with
      temptation, and when at last he completed his answer, it
      was but to give reasons why he could not complete it as she
      asked. "How can I bid you? It would shame my manhood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, then . . . You see, Philip?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "See? What do I see?" The conflict within him, between his
      self-respect and his fear, between his manhood and his will
      to live, came forth in a torrent of petulance. "O God!
      Don't ask me such questions! Don't tempt me with them! It
      is to agonise a man in my extremity. God knows I love my
      life. It is as sweet to me as the thought of death is
      horrible, and repellent. Perhaps--perhaps this horror
      distorts my judgment, for to me it seems, it seems . . ."
      He hesitated, still in prey to that conflict, then abruptly
      added: "It seems that a defilement is the lesser evil."
      Then, in a voice of despair again: "Oh, God! I do not know;
      I should not be asked. A defilement may be cleansed away. A
      life that is put out can never be rekindled."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him, and her eyes were as dead eyes in a face
      of stone. Cold and hard came her voice: "Then bid me to do
      it, Philip. I am your dutiful wife in all things. I swore
      obedience to you at the altar. That vow, at least, I have
      kept. I will obey you now if you command me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He struggled up in a state of revulsion. Perhaps her tone
      had brought him a measure of self-contempt. "No, no!" he
      cried. "Never! I will never command you to that. I neither
      beg nor bid it, Johanna. Do you understand? I forbid it! I
      forbid it! Do you hear. Johanna?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hear you, Philip," she answered very steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door at the end of the hall was opened, and Cassaignac
      came in to announce that it was time for Master Danvelt to
      return to his cell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shuddered at that summons and clung a moment to Johanna,
      who stood silent and rigid.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pray for me, Johanna, if--if we do not meet again. God
      keep you, wife. God keep you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "God help you, Philip," she answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke away abruptly. There was about him an attempted
      resumption of dignity, a pale ghost of his old swagger. "I
      am ready, sir," he informed the officer, and so dragged
      himself painfully down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had a last glimpse of his white, piteous face before he
      vanished and the doors closed again. Then she loosed the
      hold she had kept upon her spirit and sank into the chair
      which he had just vacated. Her lips were mumbling: "A
      defilement may be cleansed away; a life that is put out can
      never be rekindled."
    </p>
    <p>
      His command upon her had been clear enough. Only shame had
      made him retract some part of it ere he went forth. But his
      command remained, and she was an obedient wife. Obedience,
      indeed, was the only part of the marriage vow in which she
      had kept faith. Had Philip married another, this danger
      would never have encompassed him. It was she who had
      brought this doom upon him. It was because she had appeared
      desirable in the eyes of Claude de Rhynsault that her
      husband's life was being employed to coerce her, and would
      be vindictively destroyed if the coercion failed. In
      marrying him she had cheated him. She was very conscious of
      that now. It lay in her power to make some measure of
      amends by purchasing for him the life he desired so
      passionately, the life which he valued far above her
      honour. If she could not give him spiritual fidelity, at
      least she could in this give him obedience, and in such a
      measure as to compensate for all that she had withheld.
      Against her there was the outrage to herself. But of what
      account was she? For whom should she keep herself pure and
      undented? Not for Philip, who opined that a defilement
      might be cleansed. And not for Anthony of Guelders, who was
      as far as the stars beyond her reach.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the Devil was at her elbow whispering. Let the
      justice of Burgundy here take its course; let Philip hang;
      and perhaps Anthony would not then be so far, so hopelessly
      removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horror of herself shook her at that, as no horror of
      defilement could have shaken her. The temptation which
      might have turned her from paying so terrible a price
      served by its reactions but to goad her on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She fell, shuddering upon her knees, crossed herself, and
      turned, as all her life she had turned in difficulty, to
      the Mother of Chastity for guidance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sweet Mother in Heaven," was the burden of her prayer,
      "turn not thy face away from me, but regard only the motive
      and not the act."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst she knelt there, softly the door of Rhynsault's
      closet opened. From the threshold, unobserved and unheard,
      he stood regarding her for some moments. Then he advanced
      towards her, his feet rustling through the rushes with
      which the stone floor was spread.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound disturbed her. She cut short her intercessions,
      crossed herself, and rose to face him, oddly calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He halted before her, a smile in his baleful eyes. "Well,
      mistress? Are you still of the same mind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding him steadily, inscrutable of face and voice, she
      asked him:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You offered me my husband's life, did you not?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes narrowed mistrustfully. "I did," he said slowly,
      "and I do again. For the last time. I will sign the order
      for his gaol-delivery, so that you speak the necessary
      word."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hotly and fiercely came her answer: "Sign it, then. Sign it
      now. And I will speak that word."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment his incredulous glance devoured her. Then
      abruptly, with an inarticulate sound arising deep from his
      throat, he took her in his arms. With rough, almost brutal
      hands, he tore the tall-crowned hennin from her golden
      head, the lace from the neck of her white undervest, then
      stooped to kiss her eyes, her lips, her throat, like a
      vampire slaking its dreadful thirst.

      THE CHEAT
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      In the wintry light of early morning a woman issued from
      the apartments of the Governor of Middelburg, and stumbled,
      groping and uncertain, down the grey hall of the Gravenhof,
      where the shadows still lay deep and objects were as yet
      but ill defined. Her hair was dishevelled, a rich cloak of
      blue velvet edged with lynx fur, flung carelessly about her
      white-clad, lissom body, trailed after her, sweeping the
      stale rushes on the floor. The hand that held it about her
      clutched a paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the table she halted, and stooped over something lying
      there at her feet. It was the hennin, swathed in its veil,
      which last night had been brutally torn from her head. As
      if it reminded her of a yesterday which, gone for ever, had
      in its going altered all her life and all her world, a sob
      broke from her. Then she commanded herself. To sustain her
      in her affliction of shame, to temper the self-loathing in
      which she now held herself, she clung to the thought that
      what she had endured was a sacrifice made in the interest
      of another. This brought her, perhaps, some feeble ray of
      that ecstatic inspiration which is known to martyrs.
    </p>
    <p>
      She picked up the tall headdress and set it on the table,
      whilst swiftly and mechanically, depending upon her sense
      of touch alone, she restored some order to her hair. Then
      she put on the hennin, adjusted the cloak more carefully
      about her shoulders, and resumed her way down the hall to
      the double doors that opened upon the stairhead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond these she found two halberdiers on guard, who, upon
      beholding her issuing thence, stared as if she were a
      ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      She asked for the captain of the guard, in a voice whose
      normal tones amazed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men's glances questioned each other; then one of them,
      leaning his pike against the wall, departed to summon the
      captain. He returned almost at once accompanied by
      Diesenhofen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The red-headed Lorrainer grinned at her with horrible
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are early astir, madam," said he, and she knew that he
      mocked her, as hereafter all the world might mock her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With fingers that shook a little she unfolded her paper,
      and proffered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is an order for my husband's immediate
      gaol-delivery."
    </p>
    <p>
      "His gaol-delivery?" Diesenhofen's grin was effaced: his
      eyes grew round. Then he studied the paper. "It is correct
      enough," said he, and handed it back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mechanically she took it, and thrust it for safety into her
      bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will conduct me to him at once," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It will be more convenient, mistress, that I bring him
      here to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But at once," she insisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, at once," he assured her. "Meanwhile you had best wait
      within. I will find you a chair. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will find one for myself. Go, go. Do not keep me waiting
      longer than you must."
    </p>
    <p>
      He went, and she re-entered the hall, paced back to the
      table, and sat down heavily. There, her thoughts a swirling
      maelstrom around which swept her husband, Count Anthony,
      and von Rhynsault, each holding her attention in turn, she
      waited for a full half-hour, thankful at least to be left
      to wait alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she heard the doors open behind her, and, springing
      up between dread and eagerness, expecting to behold her
      husband, was confronted instead with the pale, scared faces
      of her servants Jan and Peter. Jan uttered an inarticulate
      cry and hastened forward. His lean old face as grey almost
      as the hair that hung about it, with deep shadows about
      eyes that were bleared by sleeplessness, he stood before
      her, fiercely anxious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mistress, mistress! What has happened? We have waited all
      night."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Happened?" she echoed. She uttered a short, joyless,
      dreadful laugh. "A soul has been down to hell, to purchase
      a man's life. That is what has happened. Your master is
      free. When the captain brings him, we will go home." And
      she repeated the word curiously: "Home!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain Diesenhofen is coming up now. He sent us on ahead
      of him." Thus Jan, talking as men will when they feel it
      desperately incumbent to talk. But his eyes were upon her,
      and it was to be read in them that his thoughts knew little
      of his tongue. Suddenly he covered his face with his hands,
      and broke into sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jan!" she commanded him. "Jan! Will you drive me to kill
      myself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mistress!" He fell on his knees before her, caught her
      hand, and bore it to his lips. "Mistress!" he cried again.
      It was all that he could say, but his broken-hearted tone
      said all the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Heavy steps sounded beyond the doors, which the servants
      had left open. Diesenhofen entered, followed by two men who
      bore a stretcher, on which lay supine under a cloak the
      figure of a man. Within six paces of the door they set it
      down at the officer's command. Johanna stared, not
      understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But--my husband? Where is my husband?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Diesenhofen waved away the bearers before answering her.
      "He is here, mistress."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here?" Wild-eyed she looked at the stretcher. "Merciful
      God! Have you been torturing him again?" This she conceived
      to be the explanation. The light, after all, was dim in
      that place. They had so broken him that he could not walk.
      "Philip!" she called, and swept quickly towards him.
      "Philip!"
    </p>
    <p>
      As she reached the stretcher, a wild fear gripped her
      heart. A moment she hesitated, then snatched away the
      covering cloak. One glance, and soundlessly, her nether lip
      in her teeth, she recoiled, staring a fearful question at
      the stolid captain. He answered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "He was hanged at daybreak, mistress, in execution of the
      sentence passed upon him yesterday in the Governor's
      court."
    </p>
    <p>
      She swayed there a moment, then staggered forward, and went
      down on her knees beside the body of her husband. And her
      first thought in that dreadful moment was that at least he
      would never know, and so never come to spurn her as unclean
      and defiled by the sacrifice made to save his life. Other
      thoughts followed, terrible, searing thoughts, in which
      grief and shame and rage were indissolubly commingled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Rhynsault found her, when presently he emerged from
      his closet, and checked, frowning, to discover this scene
      in a place which he had imagined empty by now. He would
      have withdrawn again, assailed by a certain sheepishness,
      but that he found her servants' eyes upon him. With his
      thumbs in the belt of his long scarlet gown, he advanced
      softly, and softly addressed himself to Jan.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Best take her home," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though he spoke softly, the sibilant voice pierced her
      absorption, and brought her to her feet, almost at a bound.
      She wheeled to face him, erect, stiff, oddly majestic. The
      only colour in her white face was supplied by the trickle
      of blood from the lip through which she had bitten. Her
      eyes blazed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have cheated me!" she said deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      He almost cowered before her anger, conscious of its
      righteousness and of the vileness which, in his view, sheer
      necessity had put it upon him to perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Best go home, mistress," was all that he could mutter
      sullenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You promised me his life, so that I bought it at your
      price. I have paid your infamous price, God knows! And you
      cheat me with this. Wantonly have you cheated me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay. Not wantonly." That at least he could truthfully
      urge. "What I promised I intended to fulfil. I did, as
      God's my witness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God is your witness," she assured him, her tone minatory.
      "God is, indeed, your witness. Beware of that, at least.
      Witness of the deed of shame between us. Witness of a vile
      bargain, vilely broken by a lying, treacherous devil!"
    </p>
    <p>
      That shook him out of his sheepishness, awoke the bully in
      him, brought the blood to his face and anger to his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the Blood!" he swore. "You'd better have a care,
      madam!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A care of what?" Defiantly she threw back her head.
      Defiantly she gave him back look for look. "Do you dream
      that after what I have endured there is anything on earth
      can daunt or frighten me? You have killed my soul,
      Rhynsault, to every human feeling but one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Words!" he growled. "You are distraught! Let me remember
      it, and use patience with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world shall know how you have cheated me."
    </p>
    <p>
      At that he shrugged and sneered. "You mean that you'll
      proclaim your harlotry? Pray do so, if you think it will
      profit you. But meanwhile, get you gone from here while my
      patience lasts. Away! Away!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay, we'll go," she said wearily, and commanded her
      servants to take up the bier.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed out ahead of her with their burden. In the
      doorway, as she was following them, she paused again, and
      turned. Out of a white face that was expressionless her
      flaming eyes considered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Remember, Rhynsault, your own words--that God is your
      witness. He comes with leaden feet, but strikes with iron
      hands. Remember that, too, as I remember it to strengthen
      me. You walk proudly in your brutal arrogance. But lord of
      life and death though you may be in Walcheren to-day, you
      shall yet be brought so low that you shall come to envy
      this poor clay that was Philip Danvelt, come to wish that
      it was yourself had been hanged in his stead this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You ranting beldame!" he roared in fury. "Diesenhofen! To
      the door with them!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She went out, Diesenhofen following.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault, still trembling with anger, an anger aroused not
      only by her words, but by a deep, inescapable sense of
      discomfiture, stood there awhile in thought, then
      ill-humouredly resumed his way to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a cheat, as she had so insistently dubbed him, and
      it was a vile thing that he had done in having broken his
      part of the bargain made. There was no escaping that
      accusation of his conscience. It was an accommodating
      conscience as a rule, not easily disturbed by any of its
      master's actions. He might have debauched the wife of every
      burgher in Middelburg without ever a remonstrance from that
      conscience of his. But this thing that he had done entailed
      sin against the code by which he lived. He was a knight,
      and a knight's plighted word or uttered promise was a
      sacred bond that could not be dishonoured without loss of
      self-esteem.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cursed the necessity under which he had been on this
      occasion to depart from his pledged word. But the necessity
      was present and very real. Kuoni had pointed it out to him.
      He could not, without danger to himself, and without the
      risk of being called unanswerably to account for it,
      reprieve a man who had been sentenced to death upon his own
      confession of having conspired against the government of
      the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only now, as he sat brooding without appetite at
      table, that he perceived that there were other ways in
      which the difficulty might have been overcome. A new trial
      might have been ordered, the witnesses examined, the
      handwritings compared, and thus a plausible reason reached
      for reversing the earlier judgment. The Fool had led him
      astray in this; and driven him to act with a rashness
      culpably stupid, which laid him open to be truthfully
      dubbed a cheat. And all for what? For the possession of a
      stone. He shivered with rage, disgusted and disgruntled. If
      he had cheated, why so had she. She had seemed so
      maddeningly delectable and desirable, and in possession had
      proved a statue, cold and inanimate as marble.
    </p>
    <p>
      From beyond the doors came the thrumming of a lute and the
      voice of Kuoni singing:
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      "Out of Love is Loathing born,<br>
      Out of Laughter weeping.<br>
      Time will wither Beauty's form,<br>
      Pluck the blossom from the thorn,<br>
      And Death will come a-reaping.<br>
      Ha, ha, ha, ha! A-reaping!"
    </blockquote> 
    <p>
      The door opened, and the Fool appeared upon the threshold,
      his lute slung before him. With mockery on his lips and in
      his little round eyes, he surveyed his master. It was as if
      he knew what was passing in that troubled mind, and took
      satisfaction in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good morrow, gossip!" was his greeting in a voice of sly
      malice.
    </p>
    <p>
      For answer, Rhynsault picked up a flagon from the table,
      and hurled it at him. It caught the Fool squarely on the
      brow, and stretched him senseless on the floor, whilst
      about his head a puddle formed of blood and wine.

    <h1>
      CAMP AND COURT
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the night of Friday, the 28th October, that
      Johanna Danvelt paid her fateful visit to Claude de
      Rhynsault at the Gravenhof.
    </p>
    <p>
      On that same night the army of the Duke of Burgundy, on the
      heights of the amphitheatre of hills about the city of
      Liège, lay under arms prepared for the final assault, which
      was to be delivered at dawn upon the stricken, exhausted,
      and despairing city. With this formidable and pitiless
      Burgundian host was Count Anthony, who had brought to
      it--and this to his present deep shame and
      mortification--his levy of eight thousand men of Guelders.
    </p>
    <p>
      He occupied a room in the house in which the Duke himself
      had found quarters. He had gone early to bed in view of the
      work to be done to-morrow, work in which he must perform
      his part, however deeply and rightly he may have loathed
      it. From his slumbers he was awakened abruptly in the
      neighbourhood of midnight, and sat up on his soldier's
      couch with Johanna's voice ringing in his ears. The voice
      had reached him when in that condition between sleeping and
      waking which is the dream-stage of the senses, but so
      clearly and distinctly that, as it brought him fully awake
      into that sitting posture, he believed her to be present in
      his room. Indeed, the sense of her presence was so strongly
      impressed upon him now, as he sat there startled and
      listening, that at length he called out:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's there?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He was answered out of the darkness by the voice of an
      equerry named de Steeg, who occupied a couch in his room.
      "My lord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony collected his wits and rose. He was
      half-dressed in preparation for the morrow, since they were
      to march at daybreak. He ordered his equerry to kindle a
      light, and not until this was done and the emptiness of the
      room revealed was the illusion of Johanna's physical
      presence finally dispelled. Then, desiring de Steeg to lie
      down again, Count Anthony remained a while sitting on the
      edge of his bed, evoking again and pondering the accents of
      the discarnate voice that had aroused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had called his name thrice, and it had been so laden
      with appeal, and with despair, that the memory of it now
      drove into his soul the conviction that she was in distress
      or danger, and for a moment in that conviction he was
      frenzied by the thought of the distance separating them.
      Then the impression faded. The calm sway of fully awakened
      intelligence supervened. He had dreamt; that was all. Often
      voices are heard so in dreams. What harm should come to
      her? She was secure and sheltered, the honoured wife of a
      prosperous burgher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he reasoned away his uneasiness. But the sense of it
      lingered even when reason had dismissed it, a sense of
      distress, oppression, and wretchedness, which, however, he
      assigned to other causes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was so wide awake that to woo sleep again was out of all
      question. He rose, and, bidding de Steeg to take no thought
      for him, drew on his boots and his pourpoint and took up
      his hat and a heavy cloak. Wrapped tight in this, for the
      night was bitterly cold, he went forth into the village
      street, where the mud churned up by men and horses during
      the day was now freezing into solid ridges underfoot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long he paced there under the stars, reviewing and reviling
      the course of events since that evening when he had left
      Flushing under Captain von Diesenhofen's escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Péronne he had accompanied the Duke to Liège with this
      great army at their heels, brought thither for the purpose
      of inflicting a terrible and merciless vengeance upon that
      little independent state which had dared withstand
      Burgundian encroachments upon its liberties. The Duke had
      sworn that he would deal with Liège as he had dealt with
      Dinant, which was much as the Romans had dealt with
      Carthage.
    </p>
    <p>
      This ruthless abuse of strength had outraged Count
      Anthony's sense of chivalry. It was not for this that he
      had brought his men of Guelders into the ducal army. He had
      joined hands with Charles to withstand a menace of war from
      the King of France, not to aid in the butchery of a
      population of artisans who had improvised themselves into
      soldiers because their homes were threatened. And butchery,
      a massacre, was Burgundy's present object, deliberate and
      avowed. Liège was to serve as an example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Papal Legate had come in tears to intercede with
      Charles to spare the lives at least of those unfortunate
      people. Even their own Prince-Bishop, the profligate Louis
      of Bourbon, on whose worthless behalf this war had first
      been waged, had implored for his subjects the lenience of
      the Duke. But Charles had met their prayers with scorn.
      Liège, he declared, should be demolished and its people
      stamped out of existence like vermin, under the heels of
      his troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst those present when the Duke thus opened his mind to
      the Papal Legate was one who, more than any other man in
      Christendom, should have raised his voice to plead the
      cause of the people of Liège, the man chiefly responsible
      for the rash act that was bringing this doom upon them.
      That man was the King of France. In vain Count Anthony
      looked to him for a protest or a prayer. He sat there
      wrapped in his fur pelisse, his thin legs crossed,
      listening to intercessions and to their rejection with the
      same propitiatory smile about his tight-lipped mouth. He
      wore his infamy without shame in those days, as lightly and
      carelessly as he wore the badge of Burgundy among the
      leaden saints in his hat. Having chosen this road out of
      the perils that had encompassed him at Péronne, he had
      resolved, it would seem, upon treading it with tripping
      feet and a debonair manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the height of the discussion, the Duke, with a certain
      contemptuous defiance in his manner, had turned to the King
      to ask him what course he considered should be taken with
      this city of Liège. King Louis had uncrossed his legs, and
      leaned forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He chose to express himself in a parable, delivered with
      that same ingratiating smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Once upon a time," said he, "my father had a high tree
      near his house; the crows that built their nests in its
      branches disturbed his slumbers. He caused the nests to be
      removed; but the crows built again, and yet again after the
      nests had been removed a second time. At last, he had the
      tree cut down at the roots; and after that he slept in
      peace."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You hear, gentlemen," the Duke had said, sweeping his eyes
      over the assembly, a sneering smile alike for that royal
      answer and for the profound silence in which it was
      received, even by those who had been loudest in advocating
      extermination.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, cutting sharply into that silence came Count
      Anthony's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We hear. But some of us do not believe our ears, or at
      least, do not believe that a king has spoken. For since
      there is neither statecraft nor chivalry in the counsel, it
      is unworthy of a prince."
    </p>
    <p>
      If prudently he left the indictment there, when he might
      have added so much more, it was that he desired to bring no
      avoidable bitterness to the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general gasp, a rustling movement among the
      members of that assembly, who may have numbered a round
      dozen, and then an ominous stillness, all eyes upon the
      affronted King.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he who has drunk vinegar need not make a wry face over
      green wine. The smile never left King Louis's lips, though
      it may have acquired a slightly sub-acid twist. With
      characteristic slyness he turned to the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fair cousin (beau cousin)," said he, "this touches you as
      closely as it touches me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke's colour rose a little and he scowled.
      Nevertheless, he brushed the matter aside as an
      irrelevancy. "From what touches me I know how to guard
      myself," he answered proudly, and the glance he directed
      upon Count Anthony was baleful. "As for the statecraft of
      the course, that is debateable ground. Chivalry is not in
      question in dealing with such a rabble."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us then debate the statecraft," was Count Anthony's
      reply. Thereupon he marshalled his arguments calmly, and
      even boldly, considering the general hostility in which he
      knew that he was heard, a hostility rooted in sycophancy to
      the Duke. From this he could not even exclude his own
      brother, Adolph of Guelders, who was present; Adolph, who
      meanwhile had married the Lady Catharine of Bourbon, and
      who, on the score both of the closer kinship thus
      established with the Duke of Burgundy, and of the office of
      Marshal of Guelders which he held, had insisted upon
      leading the Guelderland troops which Count Anthony had
      laboured to levy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony's present argument was that a wise prince
      would not stamp out a populous, industrious, and wealthy
      city, which with its dependencies might yet be brought
      within the ambit of his dominions to enrich him. At another
      time Liège might proudly and defiantly have clung to her
      independence. But now her pride was broken, her defiance
      stilled. She would submit if submission were proposed to
      her, and submit with a gratitude which should assure her
      future loyalty.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the obstinate Charles of Burgundy, having already
      determined upon his vindictive, remorseless course, was but
      confirmed in it by this opposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We desire no such pestilent subjects," was his angry
      reply. And save for the Legate, who was dejected and silent
      because he realised the futility of speech, and the
      Prince-Bishop, who, after all, was concerned for his own
      property and the source of his chief revenues, every voice
      approved the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Count Anthony significantly took his leave,
      implying that he could have no further part in such a
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he resumed the discussion anon in private with his
      cousin, and persisted in his advocacy of clemency until the
      Duke gave way to anger, and, thereby acting as steel upon
      flint, provoked anger in the Count. High words passed
      between them, and the Duke ordered the Count out of his
      presence. The Count, greatly daring, refused to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not thus, Charles," he had answered, "I will not go from
      you in anger. First I will remind you that I am here to
      serve you. You may have brought me back from my retirement
      by force. But I remained out of love for you, in your need
      of me, when you knew not upon whom you could depend in view
      of the French menace. You have no lack of friends now that
      you are on top and master of the situation. But then, when
      the self-seekers who fawn upon you to-day were waiting upon
      events, there was not one of them whom you could trust.
      Therefore, I stayed, that you might have one loyal heart
      beside you. Never yet have I failed you, Charles. At
      Montlhéry I saved your life; at Péronne I saved your
      honour. Suffer me to remind you of these proofs of my
      devotion, so that you may believe that only devotion
      inspires me now."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was mollified. Like most men of ungovernable
      temper, he was as easily turned from wrath as to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do believe it," he growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then believe me when I tell you that this thing you
      contemplate is an outrage upon chivalry which, if you
      persist in it, will tarnish your bright escutcheon for all
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is a point upon which we do not agree."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Very well. But let me remind you that the lances I brought
      from Guelders to reinforce your army were brought to defend
      you from the threatened onslaught of the King of France.
      They are not to be used in a massacre of helpless
      citizens."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was scowling again. "You mean that you will refuse
      to lead them into Liège?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Holding the views I hold, can I do less?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The question is, can you do so much?" The Duke laughed
      unpleasantly, revealing his strong white teeth. "You forget
      your brother Adolph. He is Marshal of Guelders, and he
      leads your men. And he'll lead them to hell at my bidding
      and to win my favour, especially if he suspects it will
      annoy you."
    </p>
    <p>
      And Count Anthony, realising the truth of this and the
      defeat and humiliation that must await him in insistence,
      had gone forth dejected. He would have quitted the Duke's
      camp but for the hope gleaming faintly amid despair that
      opportunity might yet be offered him of doing something in
      the dear cause of chivalry.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this he passed in bitter review as he paced there under
      the stars of that chill night, on the heights above the
      fertile valley of the Meuse, so soon to be a scene of
      desolation. He thought of the Duke, passionate and
      obstinate, of the King, treacherous and sly, and of all
      those opportunists who followed them, each intent in his
      acquisitiveness to turn to his own profit, in despite of
      honour, these failings of those princes.
    </p>
    <p>
      More than ever was Count Anthony persuaded that the world
      in which he had his being was no world for a gentleman.
      Bitterly now did he repent him of his return to it. What
      havoc had he not thereby wrought in his own life and in a
      life infinitely dearer to him than his own! What a
      fool--ignoble, paltry, and contemptible--had he not been to
      have weighed birth and blood--phantasmal attributes--and
      princely duty even, against natural instinct! What, after
      all, was this princely duty? There was his brother Adolph,
      ready, indeed eager in his insatiable ambition, to grasp
      the reins of government; daily betraying his resentment of
      his brother's seniority, missing no opportunity--as witness
      his marriage with the Lady Catharine--to strengthen his own
      position against possible eventualities. Brotherly love
      should have existed between Adolph and himself. But
      ambition in Adolph made brotherly love impossible, as all
      natural ties, it seemed, were impossible to princes. After
      all, was not Adolph better fitted than himself to be a
      ruler in such a world as this? It had no surprises for
      Adolph; he perceived in its pompous surface mockeries and
      underground intrigues nothing that was not as it should be;
      it was a world which Adolph understood, of which he was a
      part, equipped with a stomach which could digest with ease
      the things that nauseated Anthony. Such a man would make
      the better prince, no doubt, because untrammelled by any of
      those ideals that made men regard Anthony as a romantic
      dreamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had bethought him of this, if only he had reasoned
      thus in time! Now it was too late. The chance of better
      things, the chance of a life of realities nearer to his
      ideals, had slipped past him whilst he was fettered by
      preconceptions. He might now rule his duchy when he came to
      the throne, since there was no longer any better thing to
      be done, and live out his years in empty pomp and lonely
      state in Nimeguen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aroused from his thought by a steadily increasing
      rustle in the stillness of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had come some way beyond the end of the village street
      and past the last of its mean houses, and he stood now on a
      hillside road in open country. The sound came from below,
      and listening attentively he presently identified it. It
      was the laboured breathing of men, of a multitude by its
      volume, scaling otherwise stealthily the steep hillside.
    </p>
    <p>
      It needed but a moment's reflection to realise its meaning.
      What other could it be than a surprise attack by night? And
      a surprise attack it was. For those whose stealthy advance
      Count Anthony overheard were the six hundred men of
      Franchimont on a forlorn hope to save Liège at the eleventh
      hour by the assassination of Charles of Burgundy and Louis
      of France. They were guided in their desperate attempt by
      the very men who owned the houses in which the princes
      lodged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony turned at once, the soldier's instinct
      driving him, and ran back to rouse the sleeping camp and
      call out the archers of the guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the skirmish in the glare of hastily kindled torches and
      blazing tar-barrels amid the farmhouses and cottages,
      between the desperate men of Franchimont on the one side
      and the Burgundian soldiery and Scottish archers of the
      King of France on the other, you may read elsewhere in
      detail. For the men of Franchimont, hemmed about and
      overwhelmed by numbers, it only remained to sell their
      forfeited lives as dearly as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Detected in time, their attempt to avert the doom of Liège
      failed. It proved the last spark of resistance from that
      expiring city. In the morning when the army marched to the
      onslaught, the King of France riding in the press, and
      shouting "Bourgogne!" with the loudest, it met with no
      opposition from a city whose walls had formerly been razed
      to the ground and whose spirit was finally crushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to what followed, there is no more terrible page in the
      terrible history of sacked cities, abandoned deliberately
      to the lawless greed and lust of a brutal soldiery.
    </p>
    <p>
      To each division of the army a district of the city was
      assigned, and within that district all was to be theirs
      without restriction. Rapacity, cruelty, and lust were thus
      let loose upon Liège by ducal licence. Nothing was spared.
      The very churches were sacked, and those who had sought
      sanctuary in them butchered without regard to age or
      condition. The very convents were forced, the very nuns
      taken in prey by the Burgundian soldiery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The order of the day was to despoil and to exterminate, to
      strip naked of wealth and of life this proud city of which
      the Duke did not intend that one stone should remain upon
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      And whilst spoliation, rape, and carnage engaged the
      soldiery, the King of France sat dining at his ease in the
      Bishop's palace and complimenting his fair cousin upon this
      victory which rendered him the most fortunate prince alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the inhabitants of Liège had fled upon the approach
      of the ducal army; others belatedly had recourse to flight
      when they perceived the incredible ruthlessness of the
      conquerors. They were perhaps less fortunate than those who
      fell under the Burgundian steel, who were hanged or drowned
      by the exterminators. They survived that dreadful day only
      to wander homeless, fugitive, and hunted--for armed bands
      were sent out to hunt them--through the hills, through the
      rigours of a weather as inclement as the Duke of Burgundy.
      Many perished of starvation, as many, later, of exposure to
      the cold during a winter so bitter that the wine for the
      soldiery scouring the countryside for fugitives was served
      out in solidly frozen pieces cut with hatchets from the
      casks.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a week the sack of Liège endured. Then, the part of the
      soldiers being fully accomplished, they were replaced by an
      army of labourers from Luxembourg, who, under the direction
      of Burgundian officers, were to destroy the city by fire
      and then level the ruins with the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      For seven weeks after the Duke's departure, Liège continued
      to burn, until only the churches and the houses of
      churchmen remained standing in the charred desert that once
      had been so fair and populous and prosperous a city. And
      whilst their homes were burning, those who had fled from
      them were being hunted down. Upon them and others in the
      Ardennes the work of carnage and destruction went on. There
      was that district of Franchimont which had yielded those
      temerarious six hundred, and there were other districts
      which had proved troublesome in the past, to be schooled in
      what was due to the Duke of Burgundy. Thus, leaving a
      blackened train of ruins in his wake, and accounting the
      work either accomplished or to be accomplished in his
      absence, the Duke went home at last to Brussels to spend
      Christmas with his duchess, and to deal with the heavy
      arrears of business connected with his Flemish states which
      had accumulated during his campaigning absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned with his credit in the eyes of the world
      enormously enhanced, his position as one of the first,
      wealthiest, and most powerful princes in Europe fully
      consolidated. He had brought the King of France to his
      knees, used him like a vassal, and heaped upon him an
      amount of ignominy that was limited only by his imperious
      will. Upon a small but powerful principality that had dared
      to presume with him he had wreaked a terrible vengeance, to
      advertise his might and serve as a warning, not only to the
      various states making up his great dominions, but to others
      beyond their confines. He was, although he knew it not--and
      considered his present position but a stepping-stone to
      greater heights and greater achievements, among which were
      to be included a kingly crown--at the very zenith of his
      career, dazzling the world by his noontide lustre, courted,
      honoured, and feared by the nations of the earth, receiving
      at home in the magnificent splendour with which he
      surrounded himself the intoxicating incense of adulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one there was who had refused to join in that chorus of
      praise and reverence, one who remained absent from the
      Court, and whose absence left a conspicuous gap which vexed
      and fretted him, seeming to mark a lack of completeness in
      his triumph. Companion of his boyhood, sharer of his
      adolescent adventures and enterprises, often his guide and
      counsellor in them, and beside him in every crisis since
      his accession, the deliberate absence of Count Anthony of
      Guelders in such an hour as this filled him with chagrin.
      This presently grew into resentment of the disapprobation
      which he knew it to signify, and there was at least as much
      haughty annoyance at Count Anthony's absence as desire for
      his presence in the message which he dispatched to him at
      Nimeguen in the early days of January of that year 1469.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took the form of a summons to attend a meeting of the
      Chapter of the Golden Fleece. It was, as Charles well knew,
      a summons which Count Anthony could not in honour
      disregard. In reality he desired that his cousin should be
      present for another function, one which should show that
      absurdly romantic idealist that the deeds which had
      provoked his censure were the objects of very different
      sentiments among the great princes of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reluctantly Count Anthony came, as he was in duty bound by
      his knightly obligations. The alternative, to resign his
      membership of the Order of the Golden Fleece, were too
      gross an affront to offer, being in a prince tantamount to
      a declaration of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke's affection for him, underlying all resentments,
      dissipated the anger from the ducal mind when the Count
      presented himself. And the cordial, loving welcome he
      received made Count Anthony almost ashamed of his sulking
      at Nimeguen.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made philosophy to meet the case and to justify himself
      for accepting the situation as he found it, and condoning
      of what was done. The Duke, after all, acted according to
      his lights, and how is any man to be blamed for that? He
      acted not only according to his own lights, but according
      to those of other reigning princes of his time, and was not
      conscious that he did any wrong or in any way exceeded the
      rights or violated the obligations imposed upon him by his
      princely rank. The argument may have been unsound, but so
      is argument always when either hate or affection tempers
      judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      To confirm him, Count Anthony was present, a prominent
      member of that brilliant gathering assembled in the great
      hall of the palace at Brussels on Sunday, the 15th January,
      when the representatives of the city of Ghent came to make
      submission and sue for pardon for past events in the city
      on the occasion of the Duke's accession. With the example
      of Liège before their eyes, they realised the stern
      necessity for the measure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall was hung with tapestries figuring the achievements
      of Alexander and Hannibal, selected as suggestively
      appropriate to the occasion. On a dais that was carpeted
      with cloth of gold, sat the Duke, magnificently robed. He
      was supported by the Prince-Bishop of Liège, the Prince of
      Savoy, the Duke of Somerset, the Knights of the Golden
      Fleece and the ambassadors of France, England, Russia,
      Prussia, Austria, Bohemia, Naples, Milan, Venice, and other
      of the world's great states. Outside in the snow which lay
      thick in the courtyard humbly waited a crowd of men of
      Ghent, all of them men of consequence and wealth--the best
      that Ghent could send to represent her--the members of the
      municipality and the deans of the fifty-two guilds. For
      half an hour and more they stood there in the cold like
      mendicants, and when at last admitted came humbly as
      mendicants to sue pardon, profess submission utter and
      absolute to the Duke's will, and to implore him to take the
      city of Ghent under his exalted protection. To this Charles
      consented only after administering a harsh and stern rebuke
      upon past conduct, and publicly and formally destroying the
      royal charter, known as the Great Privelege of Ghent,
      whereby a King of France a hundred and fifty years ago had
      conferred upon the Ghenters the right of electing their own
      magistrates.

    </h1>
    <h1>
      GRAND MASTER OF BURGUNDY
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Chapter of the Golden Fleece had met, and Count
      Anthony had heard in that assembly, by now famous for the
      frankness of its criticisms even of the conduct of princes,
      only encomiums upon the Duke's prowess, statecraft, and
      foresight, he begged leave of Charles to return to
      Nimeguen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here's a very sudden fondness for the place," Charles had
      sneered in quick resentment of this haste of Anthony's to
      withdraw again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke sat over the fire in his closet, spreading his
      hands to the blaze, for it was a raw January morning, and
      all the town lay under a crust of frozen snow, glittering
      in a pale sunshine that was barren of heat. Anthony, beyond
      the hearth, was leaning on the overmantel. He fetched a
      sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The longer I live," said he, "the more persuaded I become
      that I am not fitted for the world. My views do not seem in
      tune with the views of my fellow-creatures. It is a
      depressing persuasion, which at Nimeguen I can escape by
      shutting myself up in the fair library my grandfather
      assembled. There I can commune with minds which I can
      understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You should marry and get children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't think that I ever shall."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke grunted. "In that case, and being otherwise as
      unhealthy-minded as you say, why not seek the retirement of
      a monastery?" His Highness was sarcastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've thought of it," said Count Anthony simply, whereupon
      the Duke lost patience with him, and read him a
      considerable homily. He spent too much time in dreaming and
      too little in doing; he was eccentric and fantastic in his
      notions; he practised an unnatural austerity; he was too
      much of a critic of other men's performances, whilst
      himself performing nothing. That was his trouble. What he
      needed was occupation. It was a need the Duke could supply.
      He pointed to a writing-table piled with documents,
      letters, petitions, charters, all manner of legal
      parchments awaiting consideration which his secretaries had
      sorted out and placed there for his study and
      pronouncement. And these were only some of the arrears
      which his absence from court had accumulated. Let Anthony
      lend him his assistance, as he had done of old. He would
      find time hang less heavily on his hands, and he would be
      afforded more profitable occupation than brooding over the
      imperfections of a world which he had had no hand in
      creating, or stringing rhymes out of strands of moonshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there were other matters besides claiming attention.
      There had been trouble in Zealand during his absence.
      Fortunately he was well represented there by the Lorrainer
      Claude de Rhynsault, the most capable and resolute of all
      his lieutenants. The vigilance of his ducal lieutenant had
      detected the first signs of the revolt, and he had rounded
      up the leaders and dealt with them out of hand, thus
      crushing the beast of sedition before it had even ventured
      to rear its head. That sedition was something for which
      indirectly he had to thank the King of France. The rising
      at Liège had confirmed a suspicion in Zealand that the Duke
      of Burgundy was about to meet defeat if not annihilation on
      the French frontier. The Duke laughed. Well, well! He had
      shown them the kind of man he was, and the example he had
      made of Liège should put sedition to sleep for years in
      Zealand and elsewhere. Meanwhile Rhynsault had done well.
      By his prompt and effective action he had saved the
      necessity for sterner measures which by their dislocation
      of trade must have had a disconcertingly inconvenient
      effect upon the revenues derived from Zealand. Rhynsault
      deserved well of him, and should be rewarded. It should not
      be said of the Duke of Burgundy that he could be prodigal
      only in punishing. He would promote Rhynsault to the vacant
      governorship of Ghent. He required a strong man there, and
      Rhynsault was of all his ducal lieutenants the strongest,
      the very man for the office. Also there was a vacancy in
      the Chapter of the Golden Fleece, and it might be well to
      bestow it upon Rhynsault.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," demurred Count Anthony, "is a very high honour even
      for so great a service."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am aware of it," the Duke answered. "Hence a certain
      hesitation. But it would not only be a fitting reward to
      one who has served me with exceptional ability always, but
      an encouragement to other ducal lieutenants to watch over
      my interests with the same zeal."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was one of the matters for consideration and discussion
      upon which he would welcome the Count's opinions. Then
      there were his audiences of justice, so long suspended of
      necessity that the list of petitioners who desired to sue
      directly to him had grown to enormous length.
    </p>
    <p>
      These audiences of justice were banquets to his vanity.
      Three days a week it had been his custom to sit in open
      court all morning to hear all claims and grievances in
      person, and to deliver judgment like another Solomon. Few
      duties of his princely office were dearer to him than this
      which he had imposed upon himself. He derived from it an
      incense such as no courtly adulation could supply; for this
      wielding power at first hand over the lives and destinies
      of men gave him a sense of being elevated almost to the
      rank of a divinity. Therefore, although it imported that he
      should resume that progress through the Northern provinces
      which necessities imposed upon him by the King of France
      had interrupted, yet he would postpone for two or three
      weeks that resumption in order to enable him to deal in
      person with some of the older petitions awaiting his
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sum total of all this was that, whilst on the one hand
      it was of the first importance that he should visit those
      Northern provinces in which the accession oaths had not yet
      been exchanged between himself and the representatives of
      the people, on the other it was of almost equal importance
      that he should remain at home to deal with the arrears of
      affairs which his campaigning absence had accumulated. And
      since it is not given to any man, not even to so exalted
      and quasi-divine a prince as the Duke of Burgundy and
      Brabant, to be in two places at one and the same time, it
      became clear that he must find a deputy to act for him at
      home, whilst abroad he went to give and receive those oaths
      which could not be pledged by proxy. In this deputy certain
      rare qualities were essential. He must be of a rank as
      nearly equal as possible to the Duke's own, to ensure him
      the reverence which an office rarely commands unless the
      holder himself commands it; he must be of exceptional
      ability in affairs, so that the Duke's interests should be
      properly safeguarded; and--most rare of all
      qualifications--he must be of proven fidelity to the Duke
      and entirely trustworthy, above all venal temptations.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," the Duke concluded, "is the man I need to be my
      Grand Master of Burgundy and my Vicegerent here during my
      absence in the North. You will agree that he is not readily
      found. Indeed, having carefully considered, I know of but
      one man who could fill that office for me in such a manner
      that I should be able to sleep in peace whilst on my
      travels. That man, Anthony, is yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count was almost startled. "But the responsibilities of
      such a charge are--"
    </p>
    <p>
      Peremptorily the Duke cut him short. "Are such as you could
      bear with ease and dignity." He rose. "It is an honour
      which you cannot refuse without affronting me. Just as you
      are the man I need for the office, so is the office the
      thing you need to give you back your manhood which you are
      in danger of losing in a mist of dreams." He set his
      strong, firm hand upon the Count's shoulder, and looked up
      into that solemn, comely face, with an expression in his
      dark eyes which was at once imperious and entreating.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the responsibilities and dangers of such an office
      daunted the Count, and were more than he cared to shoulder
      in the listlessness which had latterly descended upon him,
      on the other hand, he was not merely honoured by this proof
      of trust in his ability and integrity, but also deeply
      touched by an affection in the Duke which could so fully
      survive their late disagreements. He perceived that refusal
      was impossible; that, as the Duke said, it could not be
      made without affront.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed his head, and smiled a little. "Since you desire
      it, Charles, and if you are sure that none could serve you
      better--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are not you?" the Duke asked him sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smile on the Count's features broadened. "I think I
      am," said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so that very day the parchments were drawn up, signed,
      and sealed appointing Count Anthony of Egmont, Prince of
      Guelders, Lord of Valburg, and Knight of the Most Noble and
      Exalted Order of the Golden Fleece, to be Grand Master of
      Burgundy, Ducal Lieutenant-in-Chief and Ducal Vicegerent
      throughout the Dominions of the Duke of Burgundy and
      Brabant, whereof public proclamation was duly made.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a certain reluctance had signalised Count Anthony's
      acceptance of the office, none was perceptible in the
      manner in which he threw himself into its duties once he
      had accepted it. It was a full month before the Duke
      quitted Brussels for that necessary Northern visit. But not
      until then did Count Anthony wait to take up the onerous
      burden he had agreed to bear. At first in concert with the
      Duke, but gradually more and more independently in the
      Duke's name, he set about dealing with those weighty
      affairs which already had been awaiting attention overlong.
      There were affairs of England, affairs of the Empire,
      affairs of France, of Venice, Milan, and a dozen lesser
      states. And he went about them in a manner of so much
      graciousness, shrewdness, and tact that everywhere he
      smoothed away difficulties and strengthened ties. Details
      of his administration are to be found in La Marche by the
      curious in these matters, and it is possible to agree with
      La Marche that had Count Anthony of Guelders remained in
      his office and retained his influence over the Duke, the
      latter would have fulfilled his highest aspirations and
      raised Burgundy to the first power in Europe, instead of
      plunging by his uncontrolled rashness to disaster. That,
      however, is another story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the domestic affairs transacted in those days, and
      in which Count Anthony bore a part, the only one that
      concerns us is that of the promotion of the Sire Claude de
      Rhynsault. It was decided to give him the important
      governorship of Ghent, and if it was not yet decided to
      hang about his neck the collar of the Golden Fleece,
      neither was it decided not to do so. Decision was postponed
      because this was a matter in which the Duke and his newly
      appointed Grand Master could not see eye to eye. Count
      Anthony took the view that Rhynsault's birth and
      antecedents were not of such a quality as to entitle him to
      a place in the Chapter of that exalted order until he added
      to them, as a qualification, some achievement of more than
      ordinary worth which in itself should lend his name the
      lustre which origin failed to supply. The Duke, on the
      other hand, chose to account the man's long and tried
      fidelity and the skill with which he had handled the
      affairs of Zealand, and stifled there all danger of a
      revolt, at a time when a revolt might have had the most
      serious inflammatory qualities upon other neighbouring
      states, as sufficient grounds for bestowing upon him the
      highest honour in his gift.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this disagreement between the cousins was due the
      postponement in submitting Rhynsault's name to the Chapter
      for election to the vacant place. Meanwhile, however, the
      Governor of Zealand was summoned to Brussels by a very
      friendly letter from the Duke, which intimated to him that
      the object of this summons was to promote him as a mark of
      the Duke's appreciation of his services and worth.

      THE PETITIONER
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      At the audiences of justice held by the Duke in the great
      hall of the palace of Brussels during those four weeks that
      he spent there, a lady attracted the general notice by the
      beauty of a countenance on which dignity, candour, purity,
      and sorrow were blended into an arresting whole. It was not
      a countenance which man or woman would pass without a
      second glance. She was a little above middle height, of
      slender, graceful shape, and bore herself with that gentle
      dignity which commands the respect of all whilst offending
      none. She was richly dressed in black from the veil on her
      steeple headdress to the toes of her peaked shoes, and she
      was invariably attended by two grooms and a waiting-woman,
      which proclaimed her a person of consequence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her daily presence provoked inquiries touching her
      identity, and these elicited that she was from Zealand, the
      daughter of a wealthy merchant of Flushing and the widow of
      another wealthy merchant of Middelburg, one Philip Danvelt,
      who had suffered there some three months ago for sedition.
      This, if it lessened the desire to make her acquaintance,
      quickened the curiosity as to the purpose of her presence
      in such a place. What justice could be sought or hoped for
      from the Duke, by the widow of a convicted and executed
      traitor?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was observed, or else rumoured, that she courted the
      ushers in vain to obtain her a hearing from the Duke.
      Having failed with these, and, as time was slipping away
      and the last audience before the Duke's departure fast
      approaching, she transferred her attentions to the captain
      of the archers of the guard, who was invariably in
      attendance upon the Duke on these occasions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the captain of the archers, the Sire de Chavaigny,
      was young, and because she was very beautiful, she found at
      his hands a consideration deeper than that which she had
      received from the ushers. He at least manifested concern
      and an ardent desire to serve her. But at the same time he
      was reluctantly compelled to confess his powerlessness. The
      lists were so full that there was little hope that the Duke
      would be able to hear half the plaints that sought his
      personal ear. The Sire de Chavaigny would add the lady's
      name to these lists, but that was not to promise her an
      audience. Each petitioner must take his turn, and it was
      far beyond all possibility that her turn would be reached
      during the present session. Either she must postpone her
      plaint until the Duke's return from the North, or else
      present her case in the ordinary courts of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When will the Duke return?" she asked. Wrapt in that
      unfaltering dignity, she betrayed no impatience, no
      fretfulness. There was something about her of the calm
      purposefulness of Fate itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Chavaigny hunched his shoulder. "Who can say,
      madam? Perhaps in a few months. He will not remain absent
      longer than he must."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A few months!" A little wistful smile broke over the
      placid pallor of her face to invest it with a sweetness
      which the Sire de Chavaigny found devastating. "Already I
      have waited three months with terrible patience, Sir
      Captain, waited for the Duke's return from the wars,
      counting upon being heard by him the moment he returned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Three months!" he echoed. "And you present yourself only
      now? That is the error you have made. You should have come
      at once and set down your name, the moment your grievance
      arose. Then you would have been heard at the first
      opportunity."
    </p>
    <p>
      She perceived now her error. She should not have awaited
      word of the Duke's return from his campaign before setting
      out to seek him. She should have come to Brussels at once
      and sought guidance of those who were acquainted with the
      ways of courts, instead of sitting idly in Flushing,
      brooding over her wrongs and sustaining her life and her
      broken spirit upon the thought of justice to be obtained
      upon the evildoer.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had gone to Flushing, back to the house that had been
      her father's, the house where the stork still strutted in
      the courtyard and the quail fluttered in their cage upon
      the red wall above the tulip beds. She had gone thither
      because Middelburg had become unbearable. There were its
      associations of evil, there was the presence of Claude de
      Rhynsault, and, worse than either, there were the evil
      tongues of the women, which had been busy with her name,
      and had woven about it a tale of infamy. No sacrificial
      victim was she in this tale, but a willing adulteress so
      shameless and insensible that she had been in the arms of
      her lover at the very time that, by his orders, her husband
      was being hanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      That story had its source in the guards whom Johanna had
      surprised by issuing from Rhynsault's quarters soon after
      daybreak on the morning of Philip's hanging. They retailed
      the thing in the wine-shops and taverns as a most excellent
      jest. It spread until in its course it reached the ears of
      the burgher ladies of Middelburg. Some of these, to their
      honour, rejected it as an infamous invention. But many
      there were who welcomed it and helped on its propagation. A
      woman may not possess the beauty and endowments of Johanna
      Danvelt without arousing the malice of the spiteful of her
      sex. Then, too, there had been an aloofness about Johanna,
      which may have sprung from the fundamental unhappiness of
      her life since she had come to Middelburg. This had been
      interpreted as empty pride by many of those who had vainly
      sought her intimacy. And some there were who not too
      unwillingly had been through the hands of that very carnal
      governor, to whom the thought was very welcome that the
      austere, aloof, and apparently pious Johanna Danvelt, who
      had ever been regarded as a model of circumspection,
      should, in fact, be no better than themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst them the ladies of these various classes built up
      the story of her adultery, until it was widely if not
      commonly accepted that she had long been in secret the
      Governor's paramour, and that, if he did not show mercy to
      her husband, it was precisely because the man's removal
      would render her easier of access. It did not matter that
      the subsequent events gave the lie to this detail. It did
      not matter that on three occasions when Rhynsault presented
      himself at her door, he was denied admission, by
      uncompromising and even minatory messages unfalteringly
      delivered to him by the faithful Jan. Rhynsault on each
      occasion had ridden away laughing at the threats. But it
      was significant that he had ridden away, instead of forcing
      his way into the house and into Johanna's presence, as was
      to be expected in a man of his temperament and manner. Yet
      the current tale almost implied that on each occasion he
      had entered and been welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon Johanna became aware of the havoc gossip was making of
      her character. The bold, unfeeling stare of the women when
      she went abroad to take the air, or on her daily visit to
      church, their nudges and sneering whisperings, the absence,
      not merely of any of the expressions of sympathy which her
      widowhood should have inspired, but of greetings of any
      kind, soon began to make her aware of how she was regarded.
      And then one evening Jan cane home with a swollen eye and a
      bleeding nose. He had fought a man who had called his
      mistress a vile name. In answer to her inquiries touching
      his condition, he told her the plain truth; told her of the
      infamous things that were being said of her in Middelburg;
      told her in a foaming passion, out of his love and
      reverence for her, to the end that she might take some
      action to still these lying tongues.
    </p>
    <p>
      This full knowledge of calumnies already suspected did not
      touch her. To one who has been in hell, what can purgatory
      matter? The only thing that touched her was the evidence of
      Jan's devotion. She smiled calmly upon his fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What action can I take, Jan? As well might I seek to stem
      a river with these two hands."
    </p>
    <p>
      But action of another kind at least she did take. She
      dismantled the house in Middelburg, left the affairs of her
      late husband's trading-house in the hands of a steward, a
      man who had grown old in the service of Danvelt's father,
      and withdrew to Flushing to the home of her maidenhood, to
      the house in which Count Anthony had wooed her in days that
      now seemed to belong to the experiences of a former
      lifetime.
    </p>
    <p>
      There she waited for word of the Duke's return from the
      wars, with a patience that would have been impossible had
      it not been rooted in what was now the single purpose of
      her existence. She had placed agents in Brussels, and
      relays of horses were posted from there to Sluys, and
      maintained at her expense, so that instant word of the
      event might be brought to her. Meanwhile, she maintained
      herself in readiness for departure, and daily went over the
      memorial she had so carefully prepared. Rhynsault
      considered himself safely shielded from all consequences by
      the confession he had wrung from Danvelt under torture. Let
      her but gain the ear of the Duke and it might be that
      Rhynsault should come to realise his confidence misplaced.
      And to gain the ear of the Duke she was prepared to spend
      every ducat of her considerable fortune; for by her double
      inheritance from her father and her husband she was to-day
      the wealthiest woman in Zealand. Her father's death had not
      closed his shipbuilding yards. Philip Danvelt was not the
      man to permit his wife to cut off so rich a source of
      revenue. He had placed those yards under the care of a man
      of his own, and they continued to flourish. Now that Philip
      was gone, it was to the widow that Plancenoir, the man
      appointed, came regularly to render an account of his
      stewardship. Calmly, quietly, as she did all things, she
      received him, considered his accounts, listened to his
      suggestions, and discussed with him whatever it was
      necessary to discuss.
    </p>
    <p>
      But under that calm of hers she bore a sad and stricken
      heart. The house itself with its associations contributed
      to her sadness. Yet sooner than be deprived now of those
      associations she would have borne twice her burden of
      sorrow. There were rooms and articles of furniture that
      were intimately connected with her kindly, generous father.
      And there were all the things that brought back so vividly
      the memory of Count Anthony. Scarcely a room was without
      something to remind her of him. If she sat at table, she
      saw him sitting at the end of it, where he had sat on the
      night Friar Stephen had visited them. If she entered her
      bower above stairs, she beheld him lounging on the
      window-seat, the lute in his lap, the sunshine behind him
      setting an aureole about his tawny head. If she walked in
      the garden above the dunes, he was there stepping beside
      her, telling her again of his journey to England, until she
      could hear the deep, level tones of his dear voice speaking
      in that fluent Flemish of his which gathered refinement and
      distinction from its French accent.
    </p>
    <p>
      He haunted her in those winter days of waiting, and almost
      was she sadly content to abide there with her ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then at last, after close upon three months, at a time
      when the snow lay thick upon the land and the ice was
      everywhere, came one evening news that the Duke was
      returned to Brussels. She took ship at once with her
      servants despite the inclemency of the weather, and,
      landing at Sluys, travelled thence by swift stages to the
      ducal court. She used her wealth to procure her not only
      speed, but a certain state. Since her haste would not brook
      that she should wait to join some party of merchants or the
      like travelling to Brussels under escort, so as to ensure
      them safety from any of the predatory bands that roamed the
      land, she had an escort of her own of twenty tall fellows
      well-horsed and equipped, men of trust, the half of whom
      were derived from her shipyard at Flushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus she came on New Year's Day to Brussels, and was lodged
      with her escort at the Lion of Brabant, near Saint Gudule.
      But it was not until a fortnight later that the audiences
      of justice were renewed, and not until then that she made
      the discovery that long lists of those who desired to
      petition the Duke in person were already drawn up, and that
      she must await her turn. Not until another fortnight had
      slipped away did she make the further discovery that the
      Duke's sojourn in Brussels was soon to end, and that it was
      impossible that the existing lists should be exhausted
      before his departure. Then, at last, a feverish anxiety
      began to burn within her, however cold an exterior she
      might continue to present. It was then that she attempted
      to enlist the sympathy of ushers, to waste gold on bribes
      which were accepted greedily enough and knavishly enough by
      men who knew that it was beyond their power to earn them.
      Thus, at last, we find her making her appeal to the Sire de
      Chavaigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can you not help me, sir," she begged him, "to repair my
      fault in this matter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Help you to an audience, do you mean?" the young captain
      asked her, much as he might have asked did she mean him to
      help her to Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is what I mean," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Chavaigny pondered her with his clear young
      eyes for a long, thoughtful moment, then he fetched a
      half-sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam, there is nothing I would not do to serve you," he
      said gently, wistfully almost.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up sharply, a little frown between her brows.
      Since the bitter lesson learned at the hands of Rhynsault,
      she--who formerly had used all men with a trusting
      frankness--had grown mistrustful of all, quick to look for
      insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you say that to me, sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Pardi,</i> because it is true. If you ask me why it is
      true, faith, that is more than I can answer. I only know
      that to behold you and to be aware of your need is to
      desire to satisfy it."
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke with a blunt candour, free from any hint of
      gallantry such as she had apprehended, and in his eyes and
      countenance there was only deference. It moved her oddly,
      thawed a little of the ice that in these past months had
      settled about her heart. Her eyes were moist as she thanked
      him and implored him to yield to his kindly concern and
      discover some way to assist her, whose need was very
      urgent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is what I am considering, madam. There is one possible
      channel through which an audience might be procured for
      you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes?" She was suddenly all eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I warn you that it is not probable. In the
      dispensation of his justice the Duke desires, and
      logically, that the forms themselves shall be most just. He
      may consider that to give a preference to a late-comer is
      in itself an injustice to others. Still, we can but try.
      Have you a memorial of your plaint?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He need scarcely have asked, for the sheaf of parchments,
      folded, tied with silk, and sealed, bulked in her left
      hand. She held it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you entrust it to me, madam? There is one who might
      prevail upon the Duke to read it, that is my Lord Almoner,
      the Cardinal of Ghent, who is confessor to His Highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If he will read it first himself, he will find it his
      Christian duty so to prevail," she answered, her hopes now
      high.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Sire de Chavaigny smiled a little crookedly. He
      knew his world better than did Mistress Johanna; knew that
      a prelate's notion of his Christian duty was not always
      what one would suppose from his profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will do my utmost to induce him," he promised, but
      without confidence. "It happens that he is my uncle, so
      that at least I have access to him. What I can do to serve
      you shall be done, madam. Depend upon me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him warmly, enjoined upon him great care of her
      memorial, and, leaving it in his hands, turned to depart,
      and found herself face to face with Kuoni von Stocken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three days ago he had arrived in Brussels in the train of
      the Sire Claude de Rhynsault, who had come in answer to
      that summons from the Duke. And Rhynsault having little
      need of him here at Court, the Fool prowled whither he
      listed. Thus he had wandered into these halls of justice,
      thinking that here he might find entertainment and matter
      upon which to furbish up his wit, which had grown stale in
      the flat lands of Walcheren.
    </p>
    <p>
      When first he had espied Mistress Danvelt among the waiting
      clients, he had known that the entertainment would be
      certain. He could have no doubt of the objects of her
      presence in this place. Her pleadings should be amusing,
      all things considered; most amusing if they should happen
      to prevail.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had watched her as she approached the young captain of
      the guard. His eyes keener and his wits more alert than the
      Sire de Chavaigny's, he had not overlooked the package in
      her hand nor made two guesses as to its nature. Seeing her
      so long in talk with the officer, he became intrigued, and
      so detached himself from the fringe of the waiting throng,
      and wandered as if idly towards those two, moving with a
      noiseless step and ears alert.
    </p>
    <p>
      She needed to look at him for a long moment before she
      could be sure that he was not an apparition. He wore a
      scarlet hood and chaperon that entirely cased his head and
      ended in long points which reached down almost to his
      girdle. Below that, his pourpoint and hose were all black,
      as was the little round hat he wore atop of his hood. This
      he doffed to her, and bent his humped back until he was
      almost double.
    </p>
    <p>
      "God save you, Mistress Danvelt," he greeted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him. The pallor of her face had
      deepened, and her breath was quickened. There was fear in
      her glance and some horror too. Abruptly, ignoring his
      salutation, she passed out to the vestibule where her
      servants waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool followed her out of sight with his beady eyes.
      Then he donned his hat again, setting it at a rakish cock
      and solemnly considered the young captain, who stood a
      little bemused.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lovely woman, sir," said he dryly. "Lovely as a saint
      from Heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool raised his eyebrows. "When did you last see a
      saint from Heaven?" quoth he. Then, while the captain
      sought an answer, he relieved him of the need. "Oh, to be
      sure! Your uncle is the Cardinal of Ghent. That gives you
      an insight into celestial matters. Well, well, my nephew of
      a cardinal, if you have your uncle's word for it that
      they're like that in Heaven, we had better see to it that
      we get there."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are ribald," the captain reproved him, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's my trade. I should not be a Fool else. But under my
      ribaldry there's a heart, just as my crooked body holds a
      soul, although you might never suspect it from the aspect
      of me." He sidled nearer. "That sweet lady, now, moves my
      compassion. She has been deeply wronged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wronged!" The captain was outraged at the thought. "She
      has been wronged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "When you are a woman and as beautiful as a saint from
      Heaven, it's very difficult not to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain gripped him by the shoulder. "What do you know
      of her wrongs? Can you speak to them?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could, nephew of a cardinal. Should your saintly uncle
      desire to hear me in private, I might have a useful word to
      say."
    </p>
    <p>
      He disengaged his shoulder from that heavy hand, and was
      gone. He chuckled as he went, in anticipation of
      unexpectedly rich entertainment ahead. After that he grew
      very thoughtful on a conjecture which he desired to test.
      The opportunity came that evening, after supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke sat at cards with his brother the Bastard, the
      Duke of Somerset, the Cardinal of Ghent, and the Sire de
      Rhynsault, who was being shown so much favour and so
      greatly pampered these days that it was going to his head.
      He permitted himself odd familiarities, which if slight
      were yet beyond the usual in a court in which the most
      rigid etiquette was observed. Thus, he now ventured to
      propose that his Fool should sing, to amuse the ladies. The
      young Duchess saved his face by applauding the proposal,
      and the Fool obeyed quite readily. Whether he knew no
      better, or whether he was moved by the perversity of his
      crooked nature, he chose to sing the song that he had made
      last autumn in Middelburg, one stanza of which had already
      earned him a broken head. Or yet it may be that he
      perceived the opening such a song might make for him with
      one whom he desired to sound, one who was himself a poet,
      and a member of the Fool's present courtly audience. The
      song was not well received.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A vile, loathly ditty," the Duchess Margaret pronounced
      it, in English, to the Duke, who spoke the language as
      fluently and easily as became a man who boasted of his
      Lancastrian blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke agreed with her, and turned to Rhynsault to convey
      to him her opinion and his own. Rhynsault flushed under the
      half-reproof, the first check to his popularity since his
      advent there. His baleful eye sought the unhealthy
      countenance of Kuoni, whose very impassivity was an added
      provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a perversely ribald hound," he said by way of
      apology. "I should have mistrusted him. But he shall be
      schooled in better manners before the ladies."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, nay," the Duchess intervened. "He but exercised the
      licence of his kind. And perhaps he will yet make amends."
      She was moved to pity for that deformed and weakly
      creature, and desired him no such harm as the Sire de
      Rhynsault's tone appeared to promise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool bowed low. "For your Highness, and at your bidding
      then." And he sang a wistful little lament of a maid for
      her lover slain in the wars, as fragrant, delicate, and
      tender as the earlier song had been repellent. It brought
      tears to the eyes of more than one lady, and applause to
      the lips of them all as his lute-strings quivered into
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anon, as he was seated alone by the fire, Count Anthony
      came wandering over to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have a great gift of rhythm, Sir Fool," the Count
      commended him, and added the reproof: "Why, then, make a
      harlot of your muse?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is sincerity harlotry, Grand Master?" quoth the Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sincerity? You were sincere in that vile hedonism?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool shrugged. "I base my philosophy on life as I find
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which in itself is false. For philosophy deals with life
      as it should be."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Unless the should be may be, and is, then is it not
      philosophy, but moonshine." He spoke mournfully. Count
      Anthony, scenting suffering, was moved to compassion.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Has life used you ill?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "From the hour of my birth, Grand Master. Look at me. But I
      take not myself for model. I am the exception among men, a
      <i>lusus naturæ.</i> Because of this, because I may not
      take my part in the great play, I have been the more
      attentive an onlooker. And I have seen little to make me
      love my kind. Greed, lust, cruelty. These are the compounds
      of the soul of Man, of Man who claims to have been created
      in the image of a god. But--" He broke off, and leapt to
      his feet as if suddenly remembering the rank of the Prince
      who addressed him. He laughed, for once both visibly and
      audibly. "This is to be a traitor to my trade."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I prefer you so," said the Count solemnly, "though you
      are, I think, too sweepingly bitter. All men are not so
      fashioned."
    </p>
    <p>
      "True. Some oysters contain pearls. But you'll not argue
      from this that it is in the nature of the oyster to grow
      pearls. And when it happens that a man or woman are not of
      the more common make, does the world reward or reverence
      them for being different? Let me illustrate the point,
      Grand Master. In Middelburg there lately lived a lady of
      the burgher class, the young wife of a merchant who was
      involved in plots against the Duke's goverment, and who,
      confessing his crime, was duly hanged. Now this lady
      appeared to be of a pure and saintly life, pious,
      charitable, and good to all. Offences in themselves in the
      eyes of many of her sisters. To these she added the still
      greater offence of a beauty of body to match her beauty of
      soul. Yet, after her husband was hanged, the tale crept
      forth that she was the Governor's leman, and that she had
      been with her paramour at the very hour at which her
      husband met his death. What is one to think of life and of
      humanity in the face of such a story? Here was a woman who
      used all the Christian virtues as a cloak for sin. Can one
      accept evidence of virtue after that?" He paused and
      sighed. Then ended: "The indignation so rose against her
      that she was forced to quit Middelburg and retire to
      Flushing, where she had lived as a maid, to the house of
      her father, since deceased."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony was staring at him with a singular look in
      his dark eyes, a look that almost made the Fool afraid. It
      was clear that his mind was not at all upon the application
      of the story, but upon the later details of the identity of
      its central figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What was her name?" he asked in a voice out of which all
      the usual melody had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The name of her husband was Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment his throat was between the Count's two
      hands, and the Count's voice was rasping in his ear: "You
      lying dog!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Only for a second did Kuoni think that his last hour was
      come. In the next heartbeat he was released, flung off, and
      so swift had the whole action been that none at the other
      end of the room observed its real nature or supposed that
      Count Anthony did more than amuse himself with Rhynsault's
      Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      And meanwhile the Fool was gasping: "You misapprehend me
      grievously, Grand Master. The lie is not mine, if lie it
      be. I but retail a story current, to show the infamy of
      human nature. For, if the tale be not true, then there is
      the infamy of those that spread it. I know not, in faith,
      which it were better to believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      But laughter shook his soul the while, for the Count had
      given him a full answer to the question that all day had
      been bubbling in his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You say 'if it is true.' Is there the possibility? Bah! Do
      not answer, for I have not asked that question, or if I
      had, I know the answer to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Almost," said the Fool, "one might suppose your lordship
      to have acquaintance of the lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      His lordship did not answer him on that. "And Danvelt is
      dead, you say?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As dead as a man may be who was hanged for half-an-hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dead!" he repeated, as if to himself, and his eyes,
      wide-open, were staring into the heart of the fire. Then,
      abruptly, he swung on his heel, quitted the Fool, and, like
      a sleepwalker, went down the long room and so passed out.
    </p>

    <h1>
      THE FOOL'S MISSION
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      Betimes next morning the Fool presented himself at the Lion
      of Brabant to wait upon Mistress Johanna. He limped, and
      his back was sore, where last night Rhynsault had whipped
      him until he bled, for jeopardising his popularity by that
      unseemly song. But the Fool took little thought or care for
      these things this morning. He had a spiritual unguent for
      his bodily wounds and the promise of sweet entertainment
      soon to come. These human puppets should dance to his
      wire-pulling; the very souls of them should leap to his
      touch. He might be humped like a flea, grotesque of face
      and skeletal of limb, but it was in the mind that real
      power abode, and his mind was as much above that of his
      fellow-creatures as theirs were above the minds of apes.
      Thus Master Kuoni looked upon himself in exultant
      introspection, worshipping his own genius and contemptuous
      of the stupidity of those upon whom he was to exercise it.
      Among these he numbered--and this with the greatest of all
      relish--that bully braggart numbskull the Sire de
      Rhynsault, whom Kuoni's own wits had steered into the ducal
      esteem in which he was at present basking. And all that he
      had ever had for his pains had been kicks and cuffs and
      whippings--oh, yes, and a flagon at his head one morning
      last October which had all but extinguished him. He could
      chuckle now over the memory of that flagon and the horrible
      exasperation which had prompted Rhynsault to hurl it. Just
      as he chuckled, too, over the thought of Rhynsault
      strutting it in his pride, puffed out like a peacock by the
      favour of the Duke. Well, well, there were obstacles in
      every man's path, and only a fool would walk with his nose
      in the air. King Louis had a saying, the Fool remembered,
      that when Pride rides before, Misfortune follows fast
      behind. A shrewd rogue that King Louis; a man entirely
      after the subtle Kuoni's own heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although but three days in Brussels, his figure was known
      already. One of the advantages of his grotesque shape was
      that men remarked him and remembered him. The landlord of
      the Lion of Brabant had seen him in the street in
      attendance upon the puissant Sire de Claude Rhynsault, who
      was high in favour with the Duke and to be made, men said,
      Governor of Ghent. Therefore he was respectfully received.
      As Kuoni was wont to say, whilst he was a Fool among lords,
      among fools he was a lord. And he had a manner too, and a
      certain haughty air which he could assume, despite his
      stunted shape, to set a gulf between himself and common
      citizens such as only the most audacious would presume to
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was invited to wait in the common room. And there before
      the blazing logs he loosed his heavy cloak, contemptuously
      indifferent to the other occupants of the room, not even
      deigning to remove the round black hat which he wore over
      his scarlet hood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst he was thawing his chilled limbs came Jan, as
      Mistress Johanna's representative, to inquire his business,
      and this none too respectfully, for Jan had memories which
      did not make him love the Fool. Indeed, few things would
      have delighted him more in life than to have stretched the
      Fool's neck like a capon's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool looked him over with that beady, magnetic eye of
      his, of which many had experienced the subduing effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My business, sirrah, is to serve your mistress," he
      answered shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah!" said Jan, and stroked his shaven chin reflectively.
      "And exactly how do you propose to serve her?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That I shall do myself the honour of telling her in
      person, if she will condescend to see me. If not--" He
      paused, and hunched his shoulders. "--if not it will be her
      loss. Bear her that message, sirrah, and bring me the
      answer sharply. I am no suppliant, and I am pressed for
      time." But as Jan turned to depart upon the errand, the
      Fool deemed it well to add: "Tell her touching a certain
      memorial of hers that I may be able to indicate a channel
      by which it should reach the proper hands. That is all.
      Make haste."
    </p>
    <p>
      It followed that he was presently invited to ascend to a
      long low-ceilinged chamber on the first floor, where
      presently Mistress Johanna came to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He pondered her with the eye of an expert in things of
      beauty. How delicately white she looked and how graceful in
      that sheathing gown of black with its long tight sleeves
      which descended to the knuckles of her fine hands. Her
      suffering seemed to have refined her, fine though she had
      been before, to have bestowed upon her a certain grave
      dignity, almost a majesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      She advanced calmly towards the Fool, who had now uncovered
      and uncloaked, and stood forth in scarlet hood and chaperon
      above his suit of black.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sir, though I can scarcely believe the message you have
      sent me by my servant, I have consented to see you. I beg
      that you will state your purpose."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Incredible though it may seem to you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have come to learn that the incredible is not always the
      impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      His appraising, probing eyes were boldly upon her. "And
      that, I should opine, madam, is the least of your
      discoveries." He did not wait for her to question him upon
      his meaning, but went on, himself, to explain it. "I detect
      a new note in your voice, a new strength in your carriage.
      Knowledge has aged your soul, and shrunk this little world
      to its proper mean proportions in your eyes, so that it no
      longer terrifies you, eh? And you are adding to your
      knowledge fast. You are here in Brussels to ask for a
      justiciary, and they offer you an almoner. It is most apt.
      For, being interpreted, it means that here, at the fount of
      justice and the source of honour--barren, poetical phrases
      these--justice, when dispensed at all, is dispensed by way
      of alms: disdainfully, grudgingly, stingily."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see that you are informed of the steps I have taken. No
      doubt their object will be clear to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Quite clear, of course. But do not be afraid, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid!" She laughed, a little frosty laugh that was like
      a tinkle of silver bells. "Of what should I be afraid?
      There is nothing in the world with power to hurt me now."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his hooded head. "Nay, lady, nay! You have
      travelled far; but not yet quite so far as that. I doubt,
      indeed, if you would have the strength for such a journey.
      You do not know the peculiar asperities of the road to the
      grim kingdom of Insensibility. I do."
    </p>
    <p>
      That awoke in her another feeling besides her growing
      mistrust. The Fool had opened his mind to her for one
      moment, allowed her a glimpse into his soul, and in that
      swift, fleeting glimpse she had seemed to perceive that
      under the warped evil of his surface there was a suffering
      man; almost had she perceived--for his tone as well as his
      words had been full of self-revelation--that suffering and
      injustice had made him what he was, and that by cruelties
      endured had cruelty been fostered in him. In short, that he
      paid the world back in the only coin he earned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It disposed her--as understanding ever will--to judge him
      more leniently, even to believe that he made kin with those
      who suffered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He broke the long moment's silence. "Will you give me leave
      to sit, madam? I am a little weak this morning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, surely," she said, observing the abnormal pallor of
      that ever bloodless face and the dark stains that ringed
      his eyes. And as with a word of thanks he moved to a chair:
      "You are lame!" she cried. "Have you hurt your leg?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The lameness is not from my leg, but from the end of my
      back. It is nought. I was paid my wages last night. When
      that happens, I often go lame for a few days."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your wages?" she echoed, not understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A Fool's wages, of course," said he with a wry smile. "I
      bear a load of them on my back at present. They do not
      greatly incommode me until I come to take off my shirt. Oh,
      I was well paid last night. But not quite so richly as one
      morning last October in Middelburg with which you were
      concerned. On that occasion I was almost paid in full." He
      thrust back the close-fitting hood from his brow to reveal
      a great livid scar at the root of his hair which was
      already very grey.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the bewilderment in her eyes. And added sufficient
      to explain it, but no more. It was never his way--not,
      indeed, the way of his kind--to deal explicitly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a sweet, generous master, the Sire de Rhynsault," he
      said, in bitter mockery.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see." It seemed to her that she understood a great deal;
      in fact, she understood precisely what he intended that she
      should understand. If she inferred for herself that he was
      there to offer an offensive alliance against one whom he
      had cause to hate, the thing would seem infinitely more
      credible to her than if he were to protest it. She drew
      nearer, and came to stand by the table at which he had
      seated himself. She faced him across it, leaning towards
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you tell me, sir, that you took that wound . . . that
      you suffered on my behalf at Middelburg?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a sense," said he. "But I brought it on myself. That
      morning after you had gone, I mocked him. I did it to sting
      and goad him. I accounted him contemptible and vile. I have
      always accounted him contemptible and vile, which is why I
      have served him."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why you have served him?" This was at least incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had an explanation for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because it amused me to push him into vileness and to see
      how far he would go, once in it. You stare at me as if I
      were not real. But what else was there for me in life? I am
      no Rhynsault. What I lack in physical lusts, I make up in
      mental ones; where he amuses himself with bodies, I amuse
      myself with souls. I am frank with you, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God knows you are," said she, appalled, and shivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, compassionate me a little."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do. From my soul."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I proceed. I have feasted upon the spectacle of
      Rhynsault's grossness, his ineptitude, his maladroitness
      and his egregious vanity, so much that it has been worth
      while to endure his occasional brutalities; worth while
      because the knowledge was always within me that in the end,
      when I grew weary of his apish capers, when they ceased to
      amuse me, I could tumble him back on to the dunghill whence
      he originally arose."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes flickered at that. She began to see more clearly
      the purpose of this candid, merciless self-revelation of a
      crooked soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chance gave him the deputy-governorship of Friesland; that
      was close upon three years ago, when as Comte de Charolais
      our present Duke was virtually regent of the Burgundian
      dominions. He owed the office to the fact that he was a
      good soldier. So much must be admitted for him. And Duke
      Charles, himself a soldier first and last, loves a good
      man-at-arms above all other men, and commits the error of
      conceiving that a good fighter is necessarily a good
      administrator. It's a mistake he makes in his own person.
      But no matter. I was at Rhynsault's elbow then. I steered
      him through the difficulties of an office for which he was
      utterly unqualified. I had learning, knowledge of men and
      of the world, and wits. These I lent to Rhynsault. He
      quitted himself so well that, when the governorship of
      Zealand fell vacant, he was appointed to it. There he has
      done better still. I have helped him to the very summit of
      a perilously high ladder, of which he could never have
      climbed the half without my aid. And now upon his giddy
      eminence, swollen with pride in achievements which are not
      his own, a daw into whose tail I've stuck a handful of
      peacock's feathers, petted by the Duke, the envy of men,
      the admiration of the ladies, about to be made Governor of
      Ghent and perhaps even decked with the collar of the Golden
      Fleece, now is the moment to kick away the ladder and stand
      by to watch the egregious fall of him. I am by trade a
      maker of jests, madam. And this is my masterpiece."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A masterpiece of evil," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Evil? What is evil? But let that rest. It is too big a
      question. Whatever it may be, can it be evil to feed such
      an evil fool until he bursts? Is it not, rather, good,
      inasmuch as it supplies a warning to others of his foul
      kind?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why do you tell me all this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? The unnecessary question! Because your aims and mine
      are one to-day. By helping you to yours, I achieve my own.
      You have suffered a wrong which should not go unpunished. I
      require an unguent for my bleeding back and for the memory
      of many other bleedings of this same crooked back."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is not so crooked as your soul," she told him, sadly
      because in spite of all he aroused in her a certain pity.
      "Had it been sympathy for my wrongs that moved you, I had
      gladly hailed your help, sir. As it is--" She spread her
      hands, and shook her head again quite eloquently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He blinked at her owlishly. Where, he wondered, had he
      blundered? He had told her more or less the truth because
      he was too shrewd to suppose she would have believed him
      had he come to her with any pretence of altruistic
      sympathy. She was in desperate need of help to ends which
      must be dearer to her than life, if he judged her at all
      correctly. Why, then, so squeamish? He thought he perceived
      the light and betrayed it in his next words.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, well, madam, you may be less scornful of my help
      when you find his excellency the Lord Almoner indisposed to
      trouble himself with your memorial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You speak as if you knew that he would."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you know that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "How? I have a gift of knowledge, amounting at times to
      prescience. Let me lift the veil. At worst, my Lord Almoner
      will be peevish, and your memorial will be returned to you
      unread, the seals unbroken. That is what most probably will
      happen. At best, he may be in a benevolent mood, and he
      will condescend to lay it aside that he may slumber over it
      after dinner. So that the argosy of your destinies, if it
      floats at all, may be said to float upon the juices of a
      capon or the rosy contents of a flagon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go your ways, you mocker," she scorned him. "His
      excellency the Cardinal--"
    </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted her. "Is a thought too excellent to trouble
      himself about such little things. Excellency breeds
      corpulency and corpulency breeds somnolency, and somnolency
      breeds . . . pshaw!" He waved a bony hand in contemptuous
      dismissal of the Cardinal. "I am a mocker, yes. It is my
      trade to mock. And shall I tell you the whole secret of
      this trade?" He got to his feet, and tapped the table with
      a long, lean forefinger as he answered his own question.
      "It is to pluck the fair veil of illusion from the nasty
      face of truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And is the face of truth, then, always nasty?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've always found it so."
    </p>
    <p>
      "God help you, sir!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thank you for the prayer. I am dismissed, I think?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She confirmed him in the suspicion with amiabilities. If he
      would dine below at her charges ere he went, or if he would
      drink a cup of spiced wine against the cold, or accept a
      purse to repay him for his trouble, these things were at
      his command. But the Fool declined them all. He would not
      linger where he was not a welcome guest. He took his leave.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the door he paused, and turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your trust, I know, madam, is in your Cardinal. I hope it
      may not prove misplaced. But should this purple ambassador
      to the Court of Heaven by whom you set such store, prove
      indisposed to meddle in so earthly a matter as a woman's
      wrongs, pray bear in mind that you have a ready helper in
      the Fool. A message to me at the palace will bring me
      straight to you. No written message will be needed. It
      might not be safe. A blank sheet folded and bearing a plain
      seal is all that you need send, and not by Jan or any
      servant who was with you in Middelburg. Nor let the
      messenger seek the quarters of the Sire de Rhynsault. Let
      him hand the paper to the first archer in the guard-house
      and bid him convey it at once to the Fool of the Sire de
      Rhynsault. God save you, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      He departed by no means ill pleased. In his shrewdness he
      had not allowed so much as a hint to escape him of the
      channel by which he proposed to guide her memorial to the
      Duke. For if she refused to avail herself of that, all hope
      was at an end. And she might well refuse so long as there
      was any other hope to which she might cling. Let the
      failure of that hope, now centred in the Lord Almoner,
      reduce her to despair, and then would be his opportunity to
      make these puppets play the comedy his fertile wicked brain
      had authored.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did the sequel disappoint him. Betimes next morning,
      which was Sunday, a lackey brought him a letter under a
      plain seal which had been left for him with an archer of
      the guard. He opened it to find the paper blank. A little
      later, whilst the Court was at Mass, from which he made
      some excuse for remaining absent, he slipped out and,
      close-wrapped against the biting north wind, made his way
      through streets that were carpeted with frozen snow to the
      Lion of Brabant.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time he was admitted to Johanna's presence without
      preambles. She awaited him, a little impatient, a little
      fretful even, in that low-ceilinged room above stairs,
      where the gloom of the grey morning was relieved by the
      leaping flames of the generous fire on the cowled hearth.
      Spiced wine was steaming in a jug upon the table, and
      beside it a package, which he guessed to be her memorial,
      its seals, he observed, unbroken.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here then, cheek-by-jowl, he beheld at once his welcome and
      the cause of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose from the armchair by the fire, in which she had
      been sitting, and in rising broke from the chrysalis of her
      fur-lined cloak and stood forth slim and shapely in her
      sheathing gown of black, her golden head uncovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are good to come so promptly."
    </p>
    <p>
      He answered with a Latin tag.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Bis dat qui cito dat."</i> He advanced to the fire,
      like a moth to the flame, for being a thin-blooded creature
      he felt the cold intensely. He unwrapped himself from his
      voluminous cloak, let it slip from him, drew up a
      three-legged stool, and sat down almost within the hearth.
      She poured him a cup of the hot wine and brought it to him.
      He rose to receive it, thanked her, pledged her, and drank
      a deep draught of it, then resumed his seat, and spread his
      bony hands to the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So, so! That warms," said he. "It is not good to be cold.
      It numbs the wits together with the limbs, and I shall need
      my wits this morning if I am to serve you, mistress." He
      looked at her, and his thin lips, which, like his nose,
      were still blue, smiled rallyingly. "So your memorial has
      come back unread from his purple portliness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You saw it on the table," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay; but knew before I saw it. For otherwise you would not
      have sent for me. Why so reluctant, madam, to accept the
      help of one who desires to serve you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is not what I understood from you yesterday. You
      desire to serve yourself. I am but the means to your ends."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I am the means to yours, madam. So let us cry quits on
      that."
    </p>
    <p>
      She sighed deeply. "I must, since I can command no other,"
      she told him frankly. And straightly asked him: "What means
      have you to bring my memorial to the Duke's highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      He shifted on his stool; he laughed a little, the laughter
      of full self-confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "At least in my hands that memorial will not depend upon
      the dull humour of a fat-bellied prelate. Let me borrow for
      it Cupid's wings, and I'll warrant such flight for it that
      before nightfall it will have come to rest in the Duke's
      lap. Having sent forth the raven in vain, now try the dove,
      Madam Noah."
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward, her elbows on her knees, her face
      eager, but a little frown of perplexity between her fine
      brows. "I don't understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you did you would not need my help. Shall I be plain?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In Heaven's name!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet he seemed to hesitate, to avoid directness. It was as
      if, so as not to shock her sensibilities, he must gradually
      disclose, and, in disclosing, educate her to the task
      ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your error lay in seeking no better interest here at Court
      than that of this poor captain of the guard. He was
      well-intentioned towards you, of course. Your beauty made
      him that. But so it would have made others; others whose
      interest is of greater weight. Madam, you do not yet know
      the value to you of your beauty, the power that lies in
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed under that steady, expressionless glance of
      his, which watched her with so disconcerting an intentness.
      "I have no wish to know it," she told him sternly. "I
      remember that once before you sought to arouse that
      knowledge in me, under a pretence of serving me. Do you
      play the same tune now, Master Fool?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He avoided the question; answered instead, the statement.
      "Ay, but then you dealt with a base trickster, a foul
      cheat. How was I to know that. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave that," she bade him sharply. "Come to the present
      matter. Be short and plain." She was peremptory. "In one
      word: Whom have you in mind to act as my agent with the
      Duke?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "In five words, madam--the Grand Master of Burgundy." To
      her this was but a title. She knew nothing of its recent
      bestowal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What influence have you with him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I? None." And then, very slyly, an unmistakable
      significance in his glance, he added: "But you might have;
      nay, you would have if I know anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long and uncomfortable spell of silence in
      which she looked at him with eyes that at first were aflame
      with anger, and then of a steely coldness. At last, with a
      little smile of scorn, she answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So this is all your vaunted help? A piece of foul advice,
      which, had I been the woman to do as you propose, I should
      not have required. W<sup>h</sup>ere were your wits there,
      Master Fool, that you did not think of that?" She rose.
      "There is no more to say between us, I think, save to thank
      you for your wasted pains. I must seek other means. Heaven
      will reveal the way to me; for there is justice in Heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ay--in Heaven," he agreed. "But we're upon earth, where
      justice is for sale." He got up at last and stood before
      her, and his voice quivered with impatience, almost with
      anger. "God's light, madam! Will you hesitate to buy
      vengeance upon the guilty at the price you vainly paid to
      save the innocent?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She continued to ponder him with that cold, steely glance,
      a certain tightening about the corners of her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not necessary to put it quite so plainly. I had
      understood you already. Tell me, Master Fool, have you
      never, in all your life, met with anything pure,
      disinterested, chaste or noble, that you must proceed as if
      all souls were vile?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! Bah!" he snorted, and stooped for his cloak, which lay
      upon the ground where he had let it fall. He snatched it up
      viciously, as if to vent upon the garment the impatience
      and ill-humour by which he was assailed. "Purity! Chastity!
      Nobility! Words! Superstitions! Chimeræ!" He barked them
      out, the pitch of his voice steadily rising. "What is this
      chastity by which you set such store? A denial of Nature,
      an illusion with which blind, groping fools torment
      themselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blasphemer!" she answered him. "You speak of things you do
      not understand."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do I?" He leered at her. "Then why do those who seek to
      practise chastity find it necessary to flee the world? Why
      do they entrench themselves behind convent walls, and
      there, with hair shirt, flagellation, and lean diet, make
      their arid stand against Nature's angry onslaughts? You
      will allow an illusion such as that to lead you into
      neglecting the clear duty of avenging the murder of your
      husband, and the base cheat that was practised on yourself?
      If you did not allow it to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me peace!" she interrupted in a voice of pain. "I
      will hear no more. I beg that you will leave me."
    </p>
    <p>
      He made shift to do so, but without the intention. He had
      yet another card to play. He shrugged, like a man resigned,
      adjusted his cloak, and flung one wing of it over his left
      shoulder to swathe him. Then he took up his hat. He bowed
      in silence, and moved to the door. Midway thither he
      checked. He turned and looked at her across the wintry
      gloom of the chamber, and the dark furnishings on which the
      firelight flickered. He sighed, and his long, sallow face
      was sorrowful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, bethink you, madam! Forsake these hollow shams on
      which you build in vain; these empty bubbles blown by
      make-believe. Deal in realities. Use the irresistible
      weapons of your beauty."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent, her shoulders turned to him, facing the
      fire, one lightly shod foot upon an andiron, one hand upon
      the chimney cowl. He took one returning step towards her,
      leaned forward, and his voice was eagerly persuasive.
      "Come, madam, give me a token to Count Anthony, and leave
      the rest to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      She span round to face him, white to the lips, her eyes
      dilating.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whom do you name?" she cried, her voice strained and
      harsh.
    </p>
    <p>
      He feigned surprise at so much emotion. "Count Anthony of
      Guelders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has he to do in this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "He might have everything to do if you would but follow my
      advice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your advice?" Horror pervaded her soul, such horror and
      such dread as she had never known in all her trials.
      Controlling herself, she asked him: "Why do you name him
      now? Why did you not name him before?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I did. From the outset. He is the Grand Master of
      Burgundy, newly appointed. He is second in power only to
      the Duke, and what he wills the Duke is easily persuaded to
      perform. Give me a token that will bring him to you, so
      that you may make your prayer to him, and I'll warrant--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never! Never! Never!" Her vehemence startled him, and
      dashed his rising hopes. She advanced upon him, a wild
      creature now, frantic with fear and shame and horror.
      "Never, do you hear me, Master Fool? He is--"
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off. Even in her agitation she perceived how
      unnecessary it was to give the Fool her confidence, to tell
      him that Count Anthony of Guelders was the one man in the
      world to whom she could not appeal, the one man whom she
      could never bear to see again, the one man whom she could
      wish should never know her shame and her defilement. She
      desired if possible to continue to live in his memory as he
      had known her in Walcheren. If that were not possible, if
      knowledge of the events must come to him, at least let him
      never again behold her, let her hide herself from him, the
      only man who had power to revive her shame so that it must
      scorch her up and shrivel her to ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      But of this she said nothing to the Fool. Something of it
      he guessed, however, from the abrupt manner in which her
      self-control had slipped from her, from the terror that had
      glittered in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She controlled herself now, to be seared by a new thought.
      It was to Count Anthony of all living men that this
      creature proposed that she should sell herself for justice.
      But swift on the heels of that sudden anger with the Fool
      came pity. How little he knew his world, after all, this
      apostle of evil, to judge Count Anthony a man to be so
      bought!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go, sir," she dismissed him. "There is no more to be said
      between us."
    </p>
    <p>
      He departed, vexed and crestfallen. Things were not to run
      the course he had planned for them. Here were destinies
      which he had thought to shape with his thumbs as a potter
      shapes his pots. But unexpected elements had been present
      in the clay, elements unusual in the clay of humanity as
      Kuoni knew it. All was not done yet. By no means. But the
      consummation towards which he aimed, so far as the Sire de
      Rhynsault was concerned, would not be quite so poetically
      humorous as he had intended.

    <h1>
      THE MEMORIAL
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool retraced his steps, ruminating as he went. Having
      failed with Mistress Johanna, it now remained to succeed
      less picturesquely with Count Anthony. The manner of this
      required consideration. But no consideration was allowed
      him. His hand was forced by the events.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a bow-shot of the palace, he met a company of
      riders; twenty lances, coming two by two, and after these a
      string of laden pack-horses, each led by a mounted groom.
      The men-at-arms wore on their surcoats the device of
      Guelders, and at their head rode Count Anthony himself. It
      required no two glances to inform the Fool that Count
      Anthony was going a journey. Almost at the risk of being
      trampled under the hooves of the horses, which were moving
      briskly, the Fool flung himself forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Grand Master! Grand Master!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony drew rein. "What now, Fool?" His countenance
      was very stern under its plumeless black velvet hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whither away, Grand Master?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Does it concern you, Fool?" Yet he added: "I ride to
      Zealand."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool's pulses quickened. Despite the cold he broke into
      a perspiration at the thought of how nearly he had been too
      late. "Then it does concern me," said he. "And if it
      concerns the affair of which I spoke to your lordship last
      night, turn back, Grand Master. For what you would do in
      Zealand may better be done here."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What do you mean? Explain yourself, man. Be brief and
      plain."
    </p>
    <p>
      He could not be plain without betraying an excessive
      knowledge; and when one cannot be plain it is impossible to
      be brief.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you desire to sift that matter, the chief witnesses are
      here in Brussels. I have just discovered it. The lady
      herself arrived here some days since, and has vainly been
      seeking an audience of the Duke in this very business.
      Considering your . . . interest last night, I was on my way
      to tell you now."
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously Count Anthony was startled and deeply moved.
      "Come with me," he bade the Fool, and gave the order to go
      about.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his closet presently, booted, armed, and cloaked as he
      was, the Count flung himself into a chair. He was breathing
      hard. "Now, sir, your tale."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is already more than half-told."
    </p>
    <p>
      He lied of necessity to complete it. He had been to Mass
      that morning at Saint Gudule's and to his surprise had seen
      there the lady of whom last night he had spoken to the
      Count, the lovely widow of the merchant Danvelt, rendered,
      if possible, more lovely still by sorrow. From her servants
      he discovered that she was come to Brussels with a
      considerable train, which included many necessary
      witnesses, her object being to lay a plaint before the
      Duke's highness. So far her endeavours had met with no
      success, and, in view of the Duke's departure in a week's
      time for Friesland, it was feared that weary months of
      waiting lay ahead of her, by which she was profoundly
      downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony heard him out in silence, and continued
      sternly to consider him when his tale was done.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What is the nature of her plaint?" he asked. "Does she
      seek justice upon her calumniators?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool hesitated. "My lord, I was not told what is in the
      memorial."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count's sternness deepened. "What else should it
      contain, Fool?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you desire to know, Grand Master, were not the
      knowledge best sought in the memorial itself?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Or directly at the hands of Mistress Johanna?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With submission, Grand Master, first in the memorial."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony leaned forward, an elbow on his knee. "What
      do you know, yourself, of this business, Fool? You were
      with Rhynsault at the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an awkward question. The Fool could but evade it.
      "Will you question a witness before the plaintiff has been
      heard, Grand Master? First the memorial, then ask me such
      questions as it may suggest, and to the best of my
      knowledge and ability I will answer you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He beheld hesitancy in that stern face. Then, suddenly,
      resolve. The Count stood up, thrusting back his chair.
      "Where do you say Mistress Johanna is lodged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool raised his hands in entreaty. "My lord, you would
      commit an imprudence in seeking her, an imprudence which
      may defeat all. I gleaned certain things from her people,"
      he added hurriedly, to explain the depth of his knowledge.
      "I am your loyal servant, Grand Master, and the servant of
      Mistress Johanna. Be advised by me to begin with the
      memorial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But unless I seek her, how else is it to be obtained?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Never that way. I have cause to know. But I think I could
      obtain it for you within the hour, if you give me leave to
      go about it in my own fashion."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In God's name, do."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool summoned a servant, and sent him to fetch the Sire
      de Chavaigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What has he to do with it?" quoth Count Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You shall learn, Grand Master. I am using some of the
      knowledge gleaned this morning from her people. Suffer me
      to take certain liberties with your name when the captain
      comes."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Chavaigny clanked in, and bowed profoundly to
      the Count. It was the Fool, however, who addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ha, nephew of a cardinal, you sought, I think, to obtain
      your uncle's interest in a memorial left in your hands by
      Mistress Johanna Danvelt. You think that unfortunately you
      failed, and so you have returned her parchments to her. But
      the fact is you have not failed. His excellency your uncle
      has reconsidered the matter, and will be glad now to study
      this memorial. At least that is the message which my lord
      the Grand Master desires you to convey in person at once to
      Mistress Johanna, adding nothing to it, and subtracting
      nothing from it. But above all adding nothing to it: no
      word of this, you understand, or of any person's interest
      in the matter other than his greatness the Lord Almoner."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain looked at Count Anthony with eyes that plainly
      asked a question.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do as he says," the Count bade him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the memorial, so gladly surrendered by Johanna in the
      belief that Heaven had lent an ear at last to her
      intercessions, came during that same afternoon into the
      hands of the only man on earth from whose eyes she would
      have withheld it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reading of it almost stunned Count Anthony. When his
      senses had recovered, horror, anguish, rage, indeed, all
      the bitter emotions of which the human heart is capable,
      surged up in him. That Johanna, that chaste Madonna-like
      maid of whom his first impression had been one to fill him
      with reverence, that pure and austere wife so firmly
      entrenched within wifely continence, should have been thus
      defiled, subjected to this shameful martyrdom, was almost
      too horrible to be sanely considered by him. And Rhynsault?
      Such was his fury at the part this man had played that had
      he yielded to it he would have sought the fellow out and
      stabbed him without warning. It was perhaps the vindictive
      thought that a speedy death were too light a payment for
      such a debt that restrained and calmed him, and brought him
      back to a second, closer, and more detailed reading of that
      dreadfully circumstantial document.
    </p>
    <p>
      It occupied ten sheets, closely written in her own hand, so
      fine and beautiful that it might have been learnt in Italy.
      Though it was his first sight of her writing, he had no
      doubt that it was hers. It had the grace and delicacy and
      compact beauty that was in herself and consequently, he
      reasoned, must be in all things that issued from her.
      Appended to it was the copy of a brief document, an order
      for the gaol-delivery of Philip Danvelt, which announced
      that its original was in her keeping. After this came
      another half-dozen sheets, each being the deposition of a
      witness, in every case a man of consequence in Middelburg,
      attesting the loyal character of the deceased, and the fact
      that they had attended at his trial for the purpose of
      offering evidence upon the document on which his indictment
      had been based, but that their evidence had been excluded.
      Each declared himself in Brussels with Mistress Johanna, in
      readiness to come forward and make oath before the Duke of
      the truth of what he had written and to submit himself to
      be examined upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony set down the memorial on the table before
      him, and covered his face with his hands to shut out the
      horrible picture which the fundamental fact of that
      indictment evoked before his eyes. Thereafter, with elbows
      on the table and his head in his hands, the fingers buried
      in his tawny mane, he sat long immovable, pondering all,
      and above all pondering his own part in this. For that he
      had a part, he saw quite clearly, and it was a part that in
      his eyes made him almost the chief culprit in this crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began by cursing the day when he had gone to the rescue
      of that oaf Danvelt; cursed the hour in which he had
      delivered him from the hands of the ducal lieutenant at
      Bruges. Better, indeed, to have left the fellow to hang
      than that he should have lived to bring this unutterable
      thing upon Johanna. But if he had done that, he would never
      have known Johanna. What then? Better a thousand times that
      he should never have known her; better for both of them.
      What but misery and unhappiness had he brought her between
      his romantic love and his prosaical indecision? If she had
      never known him, her soul would never have been numbed by
      his desertion of her after he had awakened it to the
      awareness of life and love; and that numbness it was, that
      ensuing hopelessness, with its listlessness and
      indifference, which had made it possible for Danvelt to
      marry her and to bring this martyrdom upon her. It was his
      conduct, his actions from first to last, which had made
      this horror possible. For what he had done let him pay now,
      God helping him, by every exertion in his power, at need by
      every drop of blood in his body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resolve was quickly taken; but action upon it was
      postponed until the morrow. That day he could not trust
      himself. He was all tremors and frenzies, assailed by
      successive impulses: the impulse to run to Johanna; the
      impulse to seek the Duke and storm out his accusations
      against Rhynsault; the impulse to seek Rhynsault himself,
      and strangle him. All these he had to meet and curb. It was
      necessary, he understood, to wait until he should be calm
      enough to bring cold reason to his measures. For he
      realised here the need for care and prudence. Rhynsault at
      the moment was the spoilt darling of the Duke; and, whilst
      Charles might not be disposed to overlook so grave an
      offence as this, he would not be likely, considering his
      present attitude towards his Flemish subjects, and after
      the things he had sanctioned at Liège, to visit it with any
      punishment that could satisfy Count Anthony unless he were
      very skilfully handled and approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early next morning, by when he was again master of himself,
      Count Anthony waited upon the Duke, even as the Duke was
      about to set out for the audience of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You may, if so it please you," said he, "begin here and
      now your justiciary work by glancing at this memorial. The
      affair is, as it seems to me, of unusual gravity, not only
      in itself, but in consequence of the persons it concerns.
      Otherwise I should not intrude at such an hour."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in the Duke's closet. The captain of his archers,
      two pages, and two secretaries were in attendance and about
      to accompany him to the hall. In the corridor outside two
      files of archers of the guard awaited him.
    </p>
    <p>
      His Highness demurred. He was opposed to petitions and
      memorials reaching him through any but the ordinary
      channels. It meant, he complained, giving a preference over
      the petitioners already on the lists. Finally, however, he
      allowed himself to be persuaded, and sat down again to read
      the parchments which his cousin thrust upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he read, his brow grew black; as he read on, it grew
      blacker; then, before he had reached the end, his face was
      lighted by sudden understanding. He tossed the memorial
      down, unfinished, and uttered an impatient laugh:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, bah! This is just a tirade of vindictiveness from one
      of these sly, hard-headed burgher women because Rhynsault
      showed her traitor husband a proper lack of mercy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet that he hanged her husband is but half this woman's
      plaint," said Count Anthony quietly, "and as it seems to me
      the lesser half."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, as for the rest . . ." the Duke shrugged. "It is
      natural she should say the worst that occurs to her so as
      to blacken his character. What witnesses could there ever
      be to disprove an accusation of that character?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony was a little appalled, a little mystified
      even. Charles was not usually quite so stupid. But he
      preserved his patience, well aware that without it he would
      accomplish nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may not require disproving. Confronted with the
      accusation, Rhynsault may admit the truth of it. He is,
      after all, of knightly rank, and owes something to his
      spurs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you have me question him?" The Duke showed
      irritability. "Question him upon this trumpery indictment?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I should presume to advise it. The charge, after all, has
      its grave side. If you will read to the end, you will see
      that this lady has brought witnesses who swear that they
      could have given precious evidence, which was excluded from
      the trial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That must have been because Rhynsault was convinced
      without it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony shook his head. "It can never be good law to
      exclude evidence of any kind, and he is no law-giver who
      excludes it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And there you are wrong, Anthony. All that may be excluded
      which being superfluous serves only to waste valuable time.
      And you are wasting mine," he ended, irritably growing
      impatient under contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll waste less of it, if you will suffer me to call the
      Sire de Rhynsault before you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Call Rhynsault? To answer to this rubbish?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you afraid to call him, Charles?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Afraid! Af--By Saint George!" He flushed to the temples.
      "Is that a thing to say to me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony perceiving that it was, indeed, a thing to
      say to him, understood correctly now the source of his
      irritability. The Duke did not desire to look into this
      affair lest decency should compel him to take action upon
      it. Such action might result in his losing or having to
      curtail the services of an instrument so valuable to him as
      he accounted this Sire de Rhynsault. Rather than this, he
      would prefer to close his eyes to an offence against one of
      these burgher subjects who at present were filling him with
      resentment and contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke scowled at his Grand Master for a long, silent
      moment. Then, under the compulsion of the doubt cast upon
      him, he swung peevishly to the waiting captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chavaigny, bid the Sire de Rhynsault to wait upon us here
      at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      Chavaigny went out, and the Duke continued to scowl at his
      cousin, who had the power to shame him into doing things he
      did not wish to do. "After all, what's to come of it?" he
      demanded. "What, after all, if true? A soldier is not an
      anchorite. If I were to dismiss every man of mine who has
      made free with a burgher woman, I should have no army left.
      I am not the keeper of their souls, nor I shall be damned
      for their lechery."
    </p>
    <p>
      The more he grew heated, the more cold grew Anthony. "You
      can hardly have read the memorial attentively, Charles. The
      charge is of a complex nature. You may have missed some of
      the points."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I missed none of them. But it's not to be believed
      that all are true. I never yet knew a memorial to hold
      nothing but the truth."
    </p>
    <p>
      Little more was said until Rhynsault was ushered in. He
      came, jauntily, elastic of step, head erect, a smile upon
      his full red lips, a picture of vigorous, self-confident
      manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My homage to your Highness." He bowed to the Duke. "Your
      servant, my Lord Grand Master." He bowed to the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles cleared his throat. He found himself taken
      unawares, for in his sullenness he had not rehearsed where
      he should begin. Finally he picked up the memorial, to
      verify the name it contained, and blundered boldly into the
      heart of the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whilst at Middelburg, in October last, sir, you hanged a
      man named Danvelt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault stiffened, taken entirely by surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Danvelt? Yes . . . That is true, Highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony cut in quickly. "You have been hurrying,
      sir," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurrying?" Rhynsault looked at him, not understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a little out of breath," the Count sauvely
      explained, and so increased Rhynsault's uneasiness. But he
      attempted to carry it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, yes . . . naturally ...in my eagerness to obey the
      summons of his Highness. . . ."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, of course," purred the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke tapped the table with his forefinger. "Tcha! Tcha!
      What's that to the point? This man Danvelt was charged with
      treason, with supplying arms and money to the rebel
      movement. What was the evidence?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chiefly a letter from the man himself found among the
      effects of another convicted traitor."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke nodded. "I am really reluctant to trouble you, my
      good Rhynsault. But you should know that I have received a
      plaint against your administration of justice in this
      case."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A plaint?" Rhynsault appeared to be surprised. Then he
      quietly smiled. The Duke's manner had entirely restored his
      ease. "There are always those who complain when a man is
      hanged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "My own view," the Duke agreed. "Let me ask you to furnish
      me with answers which will justify me in dismissing this
      petition. Since it has been preferred, I must afford an
      answer to it. First, then, there is a deposition here from
      a burgomaster of Middelburg, who saw the letter at the
      trial--or so he states--and is ready to make oath that
      neither the hand nor the signature was that of the
      accused." The Duke paused for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then why did he not state it at the trial?" Rhynsault
      demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke referred to the memorial. "He writes here that he
      did, but that his statement was peremptorily brushed
      aside."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That hardly sounds the truth. Your Highness will consider
      that I conducted many similar trials in those days, and
      that it is impossible for me to speak with certainty to the
      details of any one of them. But if this burgomaster made
      any such statement at the time, it is impossible that I
      should have shut out such evidence. Quite impossible."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So I should judge," the Duke agreed with him, and would
      have passed on, accounting the question answered, but that
      Count Anthony, leaning on the table's edge at the apex of a
      triangle, whose other two angles were occupied by Rhynsault
      and the Duke, interposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Danvelt, after all, is not an uncommon name in Zealand,
      and the initial 'P' of the signature need not necessarily
      have stood even for Philip. Was any comparison made between
      documents known to be in the writing of the accused and the
      writing of his letter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was not necessary," said Rhynsault with assurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How, not necessary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault almost chuckled as he returned the pregnant
      answer: "The man confessed his guilt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confessed?" cried the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Confessed, your Highness," Rhynsault repeated firmly. "I
      hold his signed confession and can produce it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke laughed outright. He was immensely relieved.
      "There!" he exclaimed in triumph over his cousin. "That
      pricks your bubble."
    </p>
    <p>
      But Count Anthony's obstinacy, as the Duke accounted it,
      would not yet permit him to agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is the confession which you hold written in the man's own
      hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, my lord. It was taken down by one of my clerks in a
      measure as he uttered it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah! I see. You put him to the question?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And racked him until he confessed whatsoever you
      required."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault showed himself scandalised by such an
      implication. There was, however, no need for him to defend
      himself. The Duke took up the office of advocate on his
      behalf.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, now, nay!" His tone was between tolerance and
      indignation. "That is unfair, cousin. This good Rhynsault
      was within his rights. Fully within them. Surely there is
      no more to be said. And I keep the audience waiting." He
      pushed back his chair, preparatory to rising. But he was
      checked in the act by the Count's persistent return to the
      attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Was the confession ratified?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was, my lord."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did you compare the signature of that with the signature
      on the letter that incriminated him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault shrugged. Sure now of the Duke's support, he
      permitted himself a certain easy insolence of tone. "Who
      would trouble to compare the illegible scrawl of a man who
      had been racked, with something that he had written when in
      full vigour? Had his signature not been attested on the
      confession by my clerks, none could say whose signature it
      was."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke stood up, at the end of his patience. "You see,
      Anthony? My Lord Rhynsault answers too straightly and
      clearly to leave any doubts. To persist is to affront him,
      and it is not my way to affront those who serve me well."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault bowed himself double before the Duke's approving
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have leave to go," the Duke graciously dismissed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Count Anthony had not yet done. Greatly daring he
      interposed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One question more, Charles! One question in your
      interest."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke made a gesture of impatience, and but for
      Rhynsault's excessive audacity, that question would never
      have been asked, or, at least, not then.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, a dozen questions if you please, Lord Count."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I may take advantage of your generosity, then, to ask you
      two. First sir: Were you fully satisfied in your conscience
      of the guilt of this man whom you sentenced to be hanged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault became immensely dignified. "The question in
      itself is almost an insult," he answered. "I answer it,
      nevertheless. I was."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You were. And now, sir, the second question." And Count
      Anthony leaned forward, and spoke deliberately. "Why, then,
      did you reprieve him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Reprieve him? I?" Rhynsault laughed outright. "But the man
      was hanged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, yes. The circumstances of that are set forth in the
      memorial. But it still remains that you granted a reprieve,
      which by accident or by design of yours--I say not
      which--was presented too late to be effective."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That," said Rhynsault deliberately, "is a lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A copy of the terms of the reprieve is attached to the
      memorial," said Count Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If twenty copies are attached, I still say it is a lie.
      Why, what's a copy? Really, my lord! These be very slender
      grounds upon which to doubt a man of such tried fidelity as
      mine."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And so say I," the Duke agreed with him heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you pledge your knightly word that no reprieve was
      granted--" Count Anthony was saying, when Rhynsault so far
      forgot himself as to interrupt him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do so pledge it!" he cried defiantly. "My knightly
      word."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you pledge it also in the matter of the wrong you are
      here accused of having done the widow?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I wronged the widow? I?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony was more precise. "It is writ there," he
      ended. "A woman, unless she be an abandoned one, will not
      so freely set down the story of her shame. Do you pledge
      your knightly word that this, too, is false?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault hesitated. Here he perceived quite clearly that
      he was upon dangerous ground. He lacked the wits of Kuoni
      to point the way for him. Finally he took what he deemed
      the safest course.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So," he said. "Now I understand. The memorial is drawn up
      by this vindictive woman." He shrugged, and of intent
      permitted himself to look a little shamefaced. "Nay, there
      I confess my wrong. But what would your Highness?" He
      appealed him to the Duke. "I yielded to a very ordinary
      temptation. The lady was beautiful, alluring, and not
      unwilling, and--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not unwilling! You infamous base liar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      His head thrown back, his eyes ablaze, the invective had
      burst from Count Anthony's lips before he could reflect.
    </p>
    <p>
      It startled both Rhynsault and the Duke by its terrible
      vehemence. Rhynsault sucked in his breath. Squarely,
      defiantly, he looked Count Anthony between the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you make yourself this woman's champion, my lord?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And now it was the Duke who gasped, thinking that he
      perceived the drift of Rhynsault's course, and yet unable
      to believe what he perceived. In no court of Europe was the
      etiquette more rigid than at the court of Burgundy, where
      all public functions took on the semblance almost of
      religious rites, where precedence was observed with an iron
      rigidity. Rhynsault, because of valuable services, had been
      accorded certain liberties, but there was a point at which
      the Duke's dignity demanded that a line should be drawn.
      Was Rhynsault about to trespass beyond that line?
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Count had answered firmly. "I do. What, then,
      sir?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the outrageous thing the Duke suspected happened.
      With a coarse laugh, Rhynsault, plucked a glove from his
      belt. "That simplifies the issue, my lord," said he. "If I
      am to be put upon my trial for my commerce with this lady,
      let it be trial by battle, which I make so bold as to claim
      with you as is my knightly right." And he flung the glove
      down at Count Anthony's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was speechless. That any man should so far forget
      the respect due to his person as to offer a challenge in
      his presence, and on a matter in which all questions asked
      might be assumed from the questioner to be asked upon ducal
      authority, was beyond belief. And there was aggravation of
      the offence in the disparity of rank between one who was,
      after all, an upstart soldier of fortune and the other, to
      whom he presumed to toss his glove, the prince of a
      reigning house and the peer as well as blood-cousin of the
      Duke himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no word that he might have found could have been one
      half so scathing and searing to the Lorrainer's pride as
      those which were spoken by the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Captain," he said to Chavaigny, who looked on round-eyed,
      "the Sire de Rhynsault has dropped his glove; by accident,
      I think. Be so good as to restore it to him."
    </p>
    <p>
      Chavaigny stooped to obey the order, whilst Rhynsault,
      scarlet with fury, lost all self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the Blood!" he was roaring. "I might have known--"
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the Duke found his voice suddenly, and used it to
      roar louder than Rhynsault. "Silence, buffoon! Will you
      raise your voice in my presence? Will you utter threats and
      vaunts and challenges before my face? Who are you, in God's
      name? What are you, and what am I? Do you know, sirrah
      knight?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that instance of the fury of which Charles of
      Burgundy was capable, the Sire de Rhynsault's soul quailed
      within him; the bully effaced himself, his wrath
      extinguished like a candle that is blown out. In a moment
      he was all humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Highness!" His voice shook. "I admit my fault. Humbly I
      crave your Highness's pardon. Humbly!" But he went on to
      explain himself. "It heated me to be given the lie."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Heated you, did it? If you were given the lie, sir, it was
      the Grand Master speaking with my voice who gave it you. To
      raise your voice to my Grand Master, acting in the
      discharge of the functions of his office, is to raise your
      voice to me. And that, by Saint George, I suffer from no
      man; not from a sovereign prince, much less an upstart
      mercenary who is what he is by my favour alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus the storm crackled about the Lorrainer's head. By his
      presumption he had damaged himself more deeply--if only
      temporarily, for the Duke's rages were as brief as they
      were terrible--than by a dozen admissions of such matters
      as the memorial contained. As eager in his wrath to see
      Rhynsault's crest reduced as he had hitherto been anxious
      to spare him these vexations, the Duke turned to the Count.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Continue your questions, Grand Master, and let him beware
      how he answers."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have no more questions, Highness. The Sire de Rhynsault
      has admitted that he did this wrong. What he would have
      added in extenuation, if true, which it is not, can be no
      extenuation. Judgment now is for your Highness. It is for
      you to say whether you are content that such things shall
      be done, which, being done by men who hold office as your
      lieutenants and representatives, may almost be regarded as
      having been done by your own self."
    </p>
    <p>
      If it was disingenuous and craftily calculated to keep the
      Duke's anger directed along its present course, it was at
      least justified by all the facts. Dispassionately Count
      Anthony summed up the matter, so dispassionately that none
      could have guessed the extent to which his passions were
      concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "However satisfied the Governor of Middelburg may have been
      in his conscience, as he says, that this Danvelt was
      guilty, it was an injudiciousness to exclude the evidence
      of those who would have testified to the handwriting. The
      natural impression would be that he desired to hear nothing
      that would tell in the prisoner's favour; that, in fact, he
      had ends of his own to serve by presuming the prisoner's
      guilt. When you consider the burgomaster's solemn
      attestation that the incriminating letter which he saw was
      not in the handwriting of Philip Danvelt, this impression
      receives an unpleasant confirmation. Justice unjustly
      administered, or even carelessly administered, is a
      fomenter of discontent, and rightly so, especially among a
      subject people. And your Highness is well acquainted with
      the evils arising out of that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am so, by Saint George!" the Duke agreed. In the
      hostility which Rhynsault had drawn upon himself, the Duke
      was easily swayed by arguments which otherwise he might
      have brushed aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When all this is considered, it seems impossible not to
      attach belief to the story of this lady's wrongs, which,
      moreover, I repeat, the Sire de Rhynsault admits, even if
      his admission may not go the length of the lady's own
      statement." He paused. "It is for your Highness to
      pronounce," he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Malevolently the ducal eye was pondering the crestfallen
      Governor of Middelburg.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is something," he sneered at him, "that you do not
      fling your other glove, or raise your voice again to bellow
      here of your knightly rank. As for that knightly rank of
      yours, which you derive from me, I tell you plainly that,
      unless you make reparation to this woman you confess to
      having wronged, your spurs shall be hacked off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault's face turned grey. "Reparation!" he faltered.
      "Reparation, Highness?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is what I said. Reparation. Or else you lose your
      spurs and all further office in my service." It was
      necessary, the Duke thought, other things apart, that this
      upstart, who presumed so readily, should realise that the
      hand that had made him could break him just as easily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What--what reparation does your Highness suggest?" quoth
      the humbled bully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay, I'll make you no suggestions. Not I. It is for you to
      ply your wits, man."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What reparation can he make for such a wrong as that?" put
      in Count Anthony, betraying in his tone at least a little
      of the impatience that consumed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault was almost in despair. "I am eager to obey your
      Highness," he protested. "That has ever been my endeavour."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave the past, my friend. Come to the future. You shall
      have until to-night to think about it. I'll waste no more
      time on you now. The audience waits. You have leave to go.
      But let me hear from you again before I sup."
    </p>
    <p>
      He waved him away. Rhynsault stumbled out, unuttered curses
      in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, of course, the Fool, that unfailing mentor, who
      showed Rhynsault how to swim these difficult waters by
      which he was in danger of being submerged. Into the Fool's
      ear the browbeaten yet raging Rhynsault poured the tale of
      the events in the ducal closet.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I warned you of the dangers of that reprieve," Kuoni
      reminded him. "See now in what peril you would be standing
      if Danvelt had not been hanged."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Fool, if he had not been hanged, there would be no peril
      at all, for there would have been no memorial."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would there not? If you believe that you'ld believe
      anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll have no pertness," Rhynsault warned him. "I'm in no
      mood for it. The peril as it stands is grave enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "This? Pooh!" The Fool was disdainful. "To what does it
      amount? The loss of your spurs. You can grow another pair
      in time. But you could never have grown another head."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Leave that, and come to what's to be considered. What
      reparation can I offer that will quiet the Duke's humour?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The natural reparation; that which is accounted the
      reparation proper in such cases. You made the lady a widow.
      Make her a wife again, and the harm will be undone."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you mock me? Can I bring her husband back to life?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It isn't necessary to go to so much trouble, gossip.
      Provide her with another one."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where shall I find him?" cried the exasperated Rhynsault.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool looked at him, grinning silently awhile. Then he
      sighed and shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord! How your wits need stirring! You'll have to execute
      yourself, of course."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Marry her, myself?" Rhynsault was round-eyed at that.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else? Isn't that the proper and complete reparation?
      The form of it in such cases that all the world approves?
      And, on my soul, you are to be felicitated. She's well
      favoured and said to be rich. The Duke must perforce
      approve such reparation as that. Behold your difficulties
      all solved for you, gossip. Am I not your good angel?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But ..." Rhynsault broke off and fell to pondering; he
      grinned, his eyes twinkled; then his face lengthened again.
      "There's one thing you've forgot."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not I," the Fool assured him with a deadly grimness that
      escaped him. "I never forget anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What if she refuses to marry me, as well she may?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is her affair and responsibility. Yours ends with the
      offer of reparation. If she declines it, shall the Duke
      blame you for that?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, I believe you are right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By Heaven, I agree with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault chuckled. He rubbed his hands. He laughed
      outright at the humour of the whole thing. And, oddly
      enough, so did the Duke when Rhynsault put the proposal to
      him that evening. His ducal rage had passed like a summer
      storm. He had been well pleased with his administration of
      justice in the course of the morning. This mellowed him.
      When Rhynsault came, humbly seeking audience in compliance
      with the order earlier received, the Duke was disposed to
      be lenient. Rhynsault had probably learnt his lesson in
      circumspection, and so that he could offer some reasonable
      amends which would absolve the Duke in the matter of
      judgment passed and his word pledged, all would be well,
      and he need not lose a valuable servant and a very
      desirable governor for that stiff-necked city of Ghent.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Count Anthony, who was present, did not laugh at all.
      He could not believe the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will marry her, do you say?" he asked incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a great deal," said Rhynsault, entirely mistaking the
      incredulity, "and it's the best that I can offer. I offer
      it ungrudgingly. It is a proper reparation; indeed, the
      very fullest reparation for such wrong as I may have done
      her in a soldier's way."
    </p>
    <p>
      "In a soldier's way!" echoed Count Anthony, who with
      difficulty repressed the impulse to strike that impudent
      Lorrainer. He looked at the Duke for the answer, and the
      Duke returned his glance, the laugh still lingering on his
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, as he says, the best that he can offer, and it
      would generally be considered a reparation in full. We must
      be satisfied; and, indeed, I think it should content the
      lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Content her?" Count Anthony was white. His eyes glowed as
      if he had the fever. "You dream that she will consent to
      this?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why not? If she would consent to be his mistress, will she
      not consent to be his wife?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony was in despair. He perceived clearly enough
      that the Duke, his rage being spent, was considering only
      the value to himself of this Lorrainer, and out of that
      consideration desired to be rid of the whole affair. In
      this mood, the Count perceived, no justice was to be
      obtained. The Duke cared nothing for this woman's wrongs;
      cared nothing that among the traitors hanged in Walcheren
      one might have been innocent. All this earlier
      noble-seeming rage had been concerned with nothing but a
      breach of etiquette. A burgher more or less was of little
      account to the Duke, and not for a moment to be set in the
      balance against so valuable a servant as this upstart
      mercenary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, however, Count Anthony saw something else: saw
      what Kuoni had seen when out of his cruel humour he had
      sent Rhynsault upon this fool's errand of reparation by
      marriage. He saw where the Duke was in a cleft stick by
      virtue of the ducal word he had pledged that morning in his
      anger--that reparation should be made. If Johanna refused,
      as refuse she would, outraged by the very proposal, then
      the reparation that Rhynsault offered could not be made
      effective. He said so, and the Duke answered him with the
      false argument with which Kuoni had fooled his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she refuses, the matter is at an end."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not so," Count Anthony ventured to retort. "You pledged
      your word that she should have reparation. In justice it
      follows that it must be such reparation as she will
      accept."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke was annoyed because he perceived the soundness of
      the argument and at the same time perceived that she might
      have unanswerable reasons for refusing reparation in this
      form.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you tell me what is your interest in this woman, that
      you insist on pressing the matter to extremes?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And Rhynsault's eyes echoed the Duke's question if his lips
      were prudently silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This," said Count Anthony, less than truthfully, and with
      his hand he struck the memorial which lay upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke shrugged impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am concerned for your honour, Charles," the Count
      continued. "I will not have it dragged with impunity
      through kennels by any lieutenants of yours."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course, of course!" The Duke's peevishness increased.
      Then he took his resolve. "Look now; for the moment we have
      gone far enough. It is not necessary to waste time in
      pursuing the matter further upon pure assumption. Adequate
      reparation is offered--adequate in my eyes, as it must be
      in the eyes of all the world, however the woman may regard
      it. I will indite my judgment thus. It shall be attached to
      the memorial, and so returned to her. If she accounts it
      adequate, or unsuitable, let her name the alternative, and
      we will consider further. Meanwhile, I should advise her to
      be satisfied. Rhynsault, at least, has done his part."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But if--" the Count was beginning, when the Duke
      peremptorily cut him short.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Enough! I'll waste no more time on this trumpery affair,
      which has become swollen out of all proportion to its
      significance. I have a mass of business claiming my
      attention, and but five days left in which to deal with
      it." He called one of his secretaries. "Set down my
      judgment."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony went out defeated, but not despairing. When
      Johanna's refusal came the matter must be reopened. Then
      would be his opportunity. Meanwhile, he burned with shame
      for her that such a proposal should be laid before her.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ducal equerry attended by two lances drew up that evening
      at the Lion of Brabant, and dismounting came to deliver to
      Mistress Johanna in person her memorial, now bearing the
      ducal seal on the silk that bound it, informing her that
      the Duke's judgment was attached.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling with eagerness, she broke the seal. The Sire de
      Chavaigny had been as good as his word; the Lord Almoner
      had been kindly disposed; justice was awarded her at last.
      Then she read the judgment and was on fire from head to
      foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I asked for justice, and I am offered a lewd insult."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam!" The equerry was scandalised. "That is not the way
      to speak of a judgment of his Highness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Convey my words to him," she answered in a royal rage.
      "Let him call me to account for them. Or let him punish me
      for my temerity if he chooses. I think I should prefer that
      to his favour, if this be the expression of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, madam, is not a message of which I can be the
      bearer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is the message that I bid you bear; that I beg you to
      bear; every word of it. Or shall I set it down in writing?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you insist that it should reach the Duke. But let me
      beg you to reflect, madam--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It needs no reflection. I have known too much shame and
      sorrow ever to know fear. I had looked to the Duke of
      Burgundy to lighten my burden, not shamefully to increase
      it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She found pen and ink and in the space below the Duke's
      seal and signature she quickly wrote her defiant
      repudiation of his judgment; this in no neat Italian hand
      like that of the memorial, but in a crabbed scrawl, the
      best her shaking fingers could accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Duke came to read it, his face turned purple. He
      sent for Count Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This woman whom you choose to protect is insolent!" He
      tossed her writing to his cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony read and nodded. "This is not insolence. It
      is righteous anger at a judgment which is accurately
      described for what it is--a lewd insult."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was rash of him. But his seething anger committed him to
      it. He was to regret it a moment later when he witnessed
      its effect, an effect which he should have foreseen.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A lewd insult, is it?" Fiercely the Duke smote the table
      with his powerful fist. "Call it what you will, it stands."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can it, if she declines to be a party to it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "That is her affair." And, fuming, he sent for Rhynsault.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean that if she refuses this, she shall have nothing.
      What, then, becomes of your pledged word that she should
      receive reparation for what yourself you pronounced her
      wrong?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have offered her, as from Rhynsault, reparation that I
      considered adequate. If she refuses it, is my pledge
      broken? You rant. I might offer her my ducal crown and my
      dominions in reparation, and she might refuse that. Should
      I then be forsworn?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What she wants--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know what she wants," the Duke snapped at him. "The
      vindictive vixen wants Rhynsault's head. Well, it happens
      that I want it, myself; and I can't spare it her."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault came in, and was shown what she had written.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My Grand Master argues," said the Duke, still snorting in
      anger, "that her refusal checkmates you along this line.
      What do you say to that, Rhynsault?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault mistook, as well he might, the source of the
      Duke's wrath. From what had been said earlier, he had
      feared this difficulty and its consequences to himself;
      also he had been successfully considering how to meet it
      should it indeed arise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is no reason, Highness, why I should not discharge the
      reparation I suggested and your Highness imposed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How can you, if she refuses to be a party to it?" quoth
      the Duke in the very words which he had lately had from
      Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could marry her by proxy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "By proxy?" The Duke was surprised and showed it, indeed
      almost bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If I did that," said Rhynsault submissively, "I should
      discharge my part of the obligation, and your judgment,
      Lord Duke, would be given effect."
    </p>
    <p>
      It took the Duke a moment to appreciate the situation.
      Slowly he stroked his shaven chin, sitting forward in his
      chair, one elbow on the table. Slowly his dark eyes
      kindled, and a smile curled the full lips of his
      prognathous mouth. That would be a keen retort upon the
      insufferable insolence of this Flemish beldame. At the same
      time it relieved him of his pledge, and made an end of this
      pestilent matter which already had engaged too much of his
      attention required by weightier affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do so," he said. "Any serving-wench will serve your turn.
      Let it be done at once."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Charles!" Count Anthony was appalled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is finished," said the Duke peremptorily. He rose. His
      hand waved Rhynsault away, and Rhynsault bowing took his
      leave, to set about finding that serving-wench without
      delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But have you considered that you go beyond your rights,
      beyond your powers?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Beyond my rights?" It was news to the Duke of Burgundy
      that any limits could be set upon his rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You place this unfortunate and suffering woman under the
      authority and at the mercy of this man. You prescribe a
      compulsory marriage. It is a thing illegal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not if I have pronounced it. I am the law."
    </p>
    <p>
      His jaw was set, his eyes hard as they looked into his
      cousin's, and Anthony, knowing his obstinacy, knew that it
      would be worse than vain to seek to move him now.
    </p>
    <p>
      He said no more. He had need to be alone; to think, to
      devise some means of saving Johanna from all the horror
      which this forced marriage must imply. If all else failed,
      he must give Rhynsault the trial by battle which once the
      Lorrainer had had the temerity to claim. But not only was
      it repugnant to him to meet on equal terms so base a
      creature as Rhynsault; there was the danger that he might
      be slain in the encounter. It was not the peril to life
      that daunted him. He would cast away his life, his rank,
      his very honour, to serve Johanna in an extremity to which
      he himself had so largely had a hand in bringing her. But
      if he were slain, she would be utterly at the mercy of
      Rhynsault, and of a Rhynsault immeasurably strengthened in
      his position towards her by a husband's rights. It was
      unthinkable; an intolerable thought. There was no issue
      that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered seeking Johanna, and taking counsel with her.
      But he was restrained by instinctive knowledge of her
      aversion to receiving him, by the conviction that it would
      give her pain to discover that it was he and not the Lord
      Almoner who had bourne her memorial to the Duke, and that
      his endeavours on her behalf had brought upon her a horror
      almost as great as any that she had already undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end he sat down to torment his soul once again by
      the perusal of that terrible memorial. Thereafter he was
      lost in thought for a time. At last, after some hesitation,
      he sent a page in quest of the Sire de Chavaigny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain came at once, leaving his supper in his
      solicitude to wait upon the Grand Master.
    </p>
    <p>
      "May I depend upon your silence, Messire de Chavaigny?" the
      Count asked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain gave the required protestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Because this is a matter in which my name must not
      appear," and he proceeded to it. "You interested yourself,
      I understand, in Mistress Johanna Danvelt to the extent of
      seeking your uncle the Almoner's interest in her memorial.
      She has reason to believe that this interest brought the
      memorial to the Duke's hands. Considering the result to
      her, your credit may not stand as high as it might. Still
      of your good intentions she may be persuaded; and, so,
      disposed to trust you yet again. Represent yourself as
      still acting on your uncle's behalf and endeavour to obtain
      from Mistress Johanna the original of this document." He
      showed the captain the copy of the reprieve which was
      attached to the memorial. "She may be reluctant to part
      with it. But do your best to induce her, by assuring
      her--mark this well--that your uncle, chagrined at the
      deplorable miscarriage of his hopes on her behalf, desires
      to make yet an attempt to obtain a modification of the
      judgment his Highness has pronounced."
    </p>
    <p>
      Her reluctance proved less than Count Anthony had feared.
      Word had been sent her of the final decision taken, and
      that, despite her refusal to marry Rhynsault, the marriage
      was nevertheless to take place, by proxy. With her
      indignation at this mockery had come utter despair. She had
      waited in vain through all these weary months, comforted
      herself in vain with the thought of a just vengeance. There
      was, as the Fool had told her, no justice on this earth
      save such as could be purchased. Oh, the Fool knew his
      world, was justified of his cynicism and of the evil tools
      with which he worked and which he sought to thrust on
      others. But not on that account could she be guided by his
      advice even to the extent of seeking the intervention of
      Count Anthony in her affairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing now remained for her but departure. She would
      return to Flushing, realise so much of her property as she
      could, and remove herself beyond the dominions of the Duke
      of Burgundy, she would go to France, perhaps, anywhere
      where she would be secure at least from the further
      persecutions which she rightly apprehended from Rhynsault's
      brutality, now that it was about to be legalised by the
      Duke's judgment and sanctified by Holy Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that the Sire de Chavaigny found her in
      the act of packing.
    </p>
    <p>
      His errand gave her pause. Was there yet a hope? Was
      Heaven, through the instrumentality of my Lord Cardinal, to
      assist her, after all? The reprieve, that original document
      to which she had clung so tenaciously as the culminating
      piece of evidence against Rhynsault, was readily
      surrendered. It was her last stake. If it were lost now, no
      matter, since all else was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bidding her be yet of good heart, the young captain went
      his ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony thanked him with a warmth which in
      Chavaigny's opinion far exceeded the trivial service he had
      rendered, pledged him to secrecy again, and so dismissed
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, two days later, on the Wednesday of that week
      so very fateful to several of the actors in this
      tragi-comedy, the Sire de Rhynsault led to the altar in
      Saint Gudule's a waiting-maid of the Duchess Margaret's,
      who stood proxy for Johanna, the widow of Philip Danvelt,
      whom the Sire Claude de Rhynsault, Governor and Ducal
      Lieutenant of Middelburg, took to wife in compliance with a
      ducal mandate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Fool, who was present, was bewildered. Somewhere the
      machinery which he had set in motion had become jammed.
      This great blundering numbskull of a Rhynsault was breaking
      easily through all the snares Kuoni had so cunningly laid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mistress Johanna, who was informed of it, took fright, and
      again prepared to go. But again the captain of archers came
      to wait upon her with another message from the Lord
      Almoner, to the effect that all was not yet done.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night Rhynsault made merry in his apartments,
      celebrating, with some improvised guests and some of the
      lesser nobles of the court, his brideless nuptials and his
      safe deliverance from what might have proved a nasty snare.
      He was elated above all because assured by an approving
      clap upon the shoulder from the Duke when he returned from
      church, that his Highness bore him no resentment and had
      not in any way diminished his intentions concerning him.
      Marrying might have few attractions for a man of the
      Lorrainer's mettle, but if a man must be forced into it, he
      could have little ground for complaint when he found
      himself the husband of the wealthiest woman in Zealand and
      probably the most beautiful. Having married her, it
      remained for him to woo her. He would prove no laggard
      there, and he would stand no nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, a laggard he did prove perforce for three
      days more. The best part of two of these days was taken up
      with labours connected with the governorship of Ghent, to
      which, to his immense satisfaction, he was now definitely
      appointed under the Duke's seal. There were voluminous
      instructions to be received. And the ducal secretaries for
      two whole days addled his brains with the contents of a
      mountain of parchments. The governorship of Ghent, he
      realised, was a very different affair from that of
      Friesland or even Zealand.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were legal questions, financial questions, commercial
      questions, municipal questions, even ambassadorial
      questions, and many others in which it imported that the
      Governor should be instructed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Friday there was a banquet given by the Duke on the eve
      of his departure, to which Rhynsault was bidden, and in
      which he cut a figure of some importance. And then at last,
      on Saturday morning early, the Duke took his departure for
      the North, leaving Count Anthony as Grand Master of
      Burgundy to act as his deputy in all matters until his
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having witnessed the pomp and circumstance of that
      departure and of the Duke's attendant train which was
      almost of the proportions of an army, Rhynsault went to
      complete his own preparations for quitting Brussels,
      intending that very day to set out for Ghent, and there
      relieve the Deputy-Governor, who was meanwhile discharging
      the duties of the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      These preparations were to include his wife, of course. And
      so at about noon, which would be some four hours after the
      Duke had left, Rhynsault, with a couple of attendants and
      followed by a horse-litter intended for the conveyance of
      the lady, presented himself at the Lion of Brabant, and in
      his big voice loudly demanded to be conducted to the Lady
      Johanna de Rhynsault. Before the obsequious and intimidated
      host would conduct him it was necessary for him to add that
      he meant the lady who lately had been known as Johanna
      Danvelt.
    </p>
    <p>
      His descent upon her was as the fall of a thunderbolt from
      a clear sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was seated at her window in that long, low-ceilinged
      chamber, wondering what hope could be left now that the
      Duke was gone, yet desperately clinging to such hope as she
      could find in the last message borne to her by the Sire de
      Chavaigny and the fact that since then there had been no
      word from the Lord Almoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      She heard without heeding the heavy ascending tread upon
      the stairs and the clank of a scabbard against the rails.
      Without knock, or by-your-leave, her door was flung open.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned sharply in her surprise, and there upon the
      threshold she beheld the Sire de Rhynsault, a magnificent
      figure filling the narrow doorway, his tall, vigorous body
      decked in scarlet, a heavy chain of gold upon his breast.
      His sleek black head was slightly inclined, his full lips
      smiled upon her not without a hint of derision, and there
      was an odious terrifying gleam in his bold blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madam wife," said he, and bowed a little. Then he entered,
      and closed the door upon the startled face of the landlord,
      who had followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In retrospect to her afterwards that entrance was like an
      evil dream, and, whilst the horror it had inspired in her
      remained vivid, the details of it were obscured as by a
      mist. Frozen in that horror she remained seated, staring at
      him, her face piteously white.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, madam," said he. "Have you no greeting for me?" He
      advanced upon her. To her startled eyes his proportions
      seemed to increase as he advanced. He was like a mountain,
      a scarlet, fiery mountain toppling irresistibly over to
      crush out her life under its vast bulk.
    </p>
    <p>
      To shake off that nightmare spell was an effort demanding
      every ounce of her strength. She sprang up at last, and
      back from him until she stood with her shoulders squarely
      to the window-panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      His great hands took her by those shoulders, and drew her
      relentlessly to him, a leer on his big handsome face. He
      kissed her, and she suffered it, paralysed by terror.
      Through her mind reverberated as if on the note of some
      great bell the word "Betrayed!" She had been cheated again,
      either by the smooth-spoken Sire de Chavaigny, or else by
      the Lord Almoner himself. Their interest, their assurances
      had been a lure to hold her there at this monster's
      disposal, when but for her trust in those betrayers she
      would have found safety in flight whilst yet there was
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He held her at arm's length, and considered her critically,
      his head on one side.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You lack responsiveness, madam wife. But that will follow.
      At least it will follow if you value your ease and my good
      will. If not . . . But let that be at present." He took his
      hands from her shoulders. "I have a litter awaiting you
      below. If you will come with me now, your servants may
      follow with your packages."
    </p>
    <p>
      Before her eyes the scarlet bulk of him shrank and swelled
      alternatively. She was on the point of swooning. Yet such
      was her spirit that it conquered at least the weakness of
      her body. She found her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not come with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not come with me?" He laughed. "You are my wife. I wedded
      you on Wednesday, though you lacked the grace yourself to
      be present. But my wife you are, and you shall practise
      wifely obedience. So come, madam. We ride to Ghent, where
      you are to fill the proud place of Governor's lady."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not come with you. I am not your wife. This is a
      mockery. A woman may not be wed against her will."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The facts contradict you, sweetheart. Married you are,
      and, if you've not had the will to it hitherto, you'll be
      wise to find it for the future." There was a minatory note
      tempering the laughter in his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will not," she reiterated. She was almost frenzied.
      Bitterly now she regretted the qualms which had prevented
      her from sending an appeal to Count Anthony. Better he
      should know her shame, bitter though that thought of his
      knowledge must be to her, than that she should thus lie now
      at Rhynsault's mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, come," he growled. "No tantrums. I'm a man of short
      moods. You'll need to remember it if you would live at
      peace with me. We ride to Ghent, mistress. Come!"
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her by the wrist, and, half-turning, attempted to
      drag her after him. But she resisted with all her strength.
      He let her go again. He was angry now. He planted his feet
      squarely, set his arms akimbo, and thus confronted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pay heed, Johanna!" he admonished her. "I have married you
      by no desire of my own in the first instance. A memorial
      which you sent the Duke, and upon the matter of which you
      and I may yet come to have a word or two, placed me under
      the necessity of this. But having married you, I mean you
      well so that you prove submissive. If you do not so prove
      of your own inclination, you shall come to prove it by
      other means. There is no sense in struggling against bonds
      from which you can gain no deliverance. If you do not like
      your nuptial fetters, you have only yourself to blame for
      them. You have brought this upon yourself, my girl. You
      should have held your peace, and left the past behind you.
      Enough said! We will go now or else . . . never mind that.
      I am not one to threaten. I perform without warning, as
      you'll discover. So come, I say, and I say it for the last
      time."
    </p>
    <p>
      She stood leaning against the table, looking at him, but
      making no movement to obey, and answering no word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Steps sounded upon the stairs, and again the clank of a
      scabbard against the rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      He jerked a thumb backward over his shoulder in the
      direction of the door. "You hear? Those are my knaves.
      They'll carry you to your litter, however you may kick and
      scream, and you'll find them tough tirewomen. Better come
      of your own accord."
    </p>
    <p>
      The door behind him opened. He wheeled impatiently at that,
      speaking as he turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who bade you . . ." he checked. He was looking at the Sire
      de Chavaigny. Behind the captain on the landing, Rhynsault
      caught a gleam of steel from the headpieces of three or
      four archers. "What the devil do you want here?" he asked,
      his anger blended with astonishment. He was to be more
      astonished still.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am seeking your excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Seeking me? For what purpose?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To arrest you, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a moment before his excellency found his voice. "To
      arrest me? To arrest me?" This was utterly incredible. "Are
      you mad?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "My orders are quite clear. Your sword, sir!" And the
      captain held out his gloved hand to receive it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I am even now about to ride on the Duke's business to
      Ghent, of which I am Governor. This is some error."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If it is, the error is not mine, my lord." And again he
      said: "Your sword!"
    </p>
    <p>
      But he would not yet surrender it, could not yet believe
      that he was not dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But in God's name, with what am I charged?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "With high treason, Excellency."
    </p>
    <p>
      "High ..." He choked. Then he recovered, and drew himself
      up stiffly. "Upon whose orders do you act?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Orders of the Grand Master of Burgundy. Come, sir, you
      must not keep us waiting. Your sword, if you please, and
      let us go."
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind Rhynsault a woman's laugh was heard. To Johanna,
      rendered faintly hysterical for the relief of this
      eleventh-hour intervention, it seemed that the scene which
      lately had been played between Rhynsault and herself was
      being repeated; but now Rhynsault was in the rôle he had
      forced on her. Just as reluctant was he to obey this
      invitation to depart as she had been when he had similarly
      pressed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned upon her in a fury. "It amuses you, you . . . ?"
      he rasped at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come, sir, come!" Chavaigny was peremptory. "Else my
      knaves must handle you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Even that!" she said, white to the lips, her eyes glowing
      like live coals. "Even that! Now will you believe in God,
      Sire de Rhynsault?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He stayed to sneer at her. "Laugh your fill, madam wife.
      You shall have more to laugh at when I've squelched this
      trumpery charge under my heel. The Duke shall make this
      Grand Master of his sorry for himself before all's done."
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of patience, Chavaigny stood aside and signalled to his
      men. They tramped in, laid hands upon the Sire de
      Rhynsault, and thrust him violently out, raging and
      blaspheming obscenely at this fresh indignity.

    <h1>
      JUDGMENT
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Master of Burgundy was well aware of the
      dangerous game to which he set his hand the moment the
      Duke's back was turned. And so was M. de Chavaigny when the
      Grand Master sent for him to be his instrument.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will take what men you need, sir," Count Anthony had
      instructed him, "and you will at once proceed to the
      quarters of the Sire de Rhynsault, or wherever else he is
      to be found, and place him under arrest. The charge against
      him, should he require to know it, will be high treason."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Chavaigny looked grave. The Grand Master
      proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will see to it that from the moment he is in your
      hands he is allowed to communicate with no one, and, above
      all, to send no messages. I ask your strictest adherence to
      these instructions."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Chavaigny bowed stiffly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will your lordship set them down for me in your own hand?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A smile lighted Count Anthony's pale face, which in this
      last week had grown haggard. "I see that you understand."
      he said. And added: "It is done already. I commit no one to
      responsibility for actions that are mine." He took up a
      paper from his table, and handed it to the captain. The
      captain scanned it, bowed, and withdrew to go upon that
      startling errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault stormed and blustered from the moment of his
      arrest until he found himself back in the main room of his
      quarters at the palace, where he was informed that he would
      for the present be confined. He demanded to send messages.
      He was denied. He announced that his messages were for the
      Duke, that a courier must be sent after him at once, and he
      dared any man to risk the consequences of the Duke's
      subsequent anger were this refused him. But Chavaigny,
      secure and immune from any consequences by virtue of the
      clear written orders under which he acted, left the
      Governor of Ghent to rage impotently alone, deprived of all
      personal attendants, and under a strong guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over Sunday he continued there, visited only by those who
      brought him food and drink, and even these were not his
      ordinary attendants, but archers who were appointed to the
      service, and who never came singly, and were never twice
      the same, so that Rhynsault could not address himself to
      corrupting or bribing them.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday morning at the early hour of eight, it was
      announced to him by the Sire de Chavaigny that his judges
      waited. Cowed now, and even a little scared, chiefly
      because he could not see clearly the line by which it was
      sought to establish this preposterous charge of high
      treason, he suffered himself to be conducted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial was to be held in the great hall of the palace,
      where the Duke himself dispensed justice, and a bruit of
      what was to take place there that morning having already
      gone abroad despite the Sire de Chavaigny's precautions,
      there was already a goodly attendance when the great ducal
      lieutenant, who had been cutting so brave a figure during
      the last few days in Brussels, who was pointed out as a man
      whom the Duke honoured, was brought by his guards within
      the barrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thither, too, in response to a summons brought her by a
      pursuivant, came Mistress Johanna, attended by her servants
      and followed by that train of friendly witnesses from
      Middelburg, supported by her here in Brussels at her own
      charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in awe; almost with reluctance. There was an
      ordeal ahead of her far sterner than any for which she had
      been prepared, in that she must now meet the eyes of Count
      Anthony with the knowledge that he was informed of all the
      grounds of her bitter, shameful plaint. The Fool had
      visited her last night, and had resolved for her any
      perplexities which the sudden turn of events might hold for
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It looks," he had said, "as if I might be out of
      employment soon. I am to suffer this because I am an
      altruist. What you would not do for yourself, Mistress
      Johanna, it was necessary that I should do for you. Your
      Lord Almoner throughout has been as somnolently indifferent
      as I predicted. I practised a deception on you, madam. Your
      friend at court has been my Lord Anthony of Guelders from
      the moment that I brought the matter to his notice. I have
      a notion that he, too, may be out of employment soon. You
      shall presently behold in him, as in me, the reward of
      virtue. Since we are altruists both, and poets both with a
      full sense of the poetic, Count Anthony and I might get on
      very well together. If he should need a Fool, I shall
      certainly need a master. As a reward, when they present you
      with Rhynsault's head upon a charger, perhaps you will use
      your good offices with the Count on my behalf."
    </p>
    <p>
      If she began by being vexed with him for the part he had
      played, he soon dissolved that vexation in the reminder
      that but for that same duplicity of his she would by now be
      on her way to Ghent as the Governor's lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came, then, fully informed of the steps by which the
      present situation had been reached. The pursuivant who
      conducted her, led her with her attendants and her
      witnesses within the barriers, and found a seat for her on
      the benches ranged there. On the topmost of these benches,
      which ascended in three tiers at right angles with the
      dais, the Fool had perched himself, an expectant spectator.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judges, four of them, were already in their places, two
      on each side of the dais. At a table below and a little to
      one side sat four clerkly fellows preparing their quills. A
      pikeman, in corselet and headpiece, his halbert ordered,
      stood at each of the four corners of the enclosure. Others
      were ranged at intervals down the two sides of the hall to
      keep order among the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Came a flourish of trumpets such as usually announced the
      advent of the Duke, and all heads were bared in the great
      hall. Johanna's eyes were raised to the doorway immediately
      facing her, whence the four tabarded trumpeters had issued
      and on either side of which they had ranged themselves to
      deliver their fanfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through this doorway came first the Sire de Chavaigny,
      closely followed by four archers of the guard; after these
      came a herald bearing the sword of state, and then in a
      robe of cloth of gold, such as the Duke wore on these
      occasions, a flat bonnet of scarlet velvet on his head,
      pale and stern, the Grand Master of Burgundy emerged. His
      eyes, meeting Johanna's as he entered, lighted suddenly,
      and as suddenly were veiled. Calmly and slowly he passed to
      his high seat on the dais, two archers following to range
      themselves behind him, immediately under the great
      escutcheon bearing the Burgundian arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at Chavaigny, who stood waiting before him at the
      foot of the dais. His voice, that clear, melodious voice,
      the memory of which had ever haunted Johanna's ears, rang
      through the silent hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bring in the Sire Claude de Rhynsault, Ducal Lieutenant
      and Governor of Ghent." Thus he gave the prisoner in full
      the new title which had been to him so great a source of
      pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      They brought him in, still wearing the magnificent scarlet
      suit in which he had been arrested, but with his bearing
      shorn of much of its habitual magnificence. He had
      neglected to shave that morning, which increased the
      haggard look of a man who for two nights had known little
      sleep; this as a result of rage rather than of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read him the indictment," the Grand Master commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      A clerk rose at the table, and in a nasal, whining voice
      discharged that duty. It was not quite what the Sire de
      Rhynsault had expected, and there was a quality in it which
      shook the assurance which hitherto had fully sustained him,
      awoke the alarm from which hitherto he had been immune.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no question, as he had so confidently supposed,
      of rejudging the case of Philip Danvelt, by establishing
      Danvelt's innocence, impeaching his judge for careless
      administration of justice, and for excluding evidence
      which, fully as available then as now, should certainly
      have been admitted. The indictment was framed upon quite
      other lines. Danvelt's guilt was assumed, accepted on the
      man's own confession without any question as to how it
      might have been extorted. Indeed, the assumption of his
      guilt was actually made the corner-stone of the present
      charge. The Sire de Rhynsault's offence was made to lie in
      the fact that he had subverted to his own ends the Duke's
      justice, by reprieving a man whose guilt of treason he
      accounted fully established by the evidence upon which he
      had sentenced him to death, since otherwise it was
      inconceivable that he could so have sentenced him. To this
      was added the comparatively minor charge of his having
      neglected to proceed as by law required to the confiscation
      of the property of a man convicted of treason, and by that
      neglect having defrauded the Duke's revenues.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clerk finished the reading and was resuming his
      seat, Rhynsault bounded up and bellowed out his answer, so
      that he could be heard to the hall's end.
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is a judged affair," he protested angrily, froth upon
      his lips. "It is judged and closed and finished by the
      Duke's highness in person. And I challenge your authority
      to reopen it. You are abusing your office, sir, in the
      Duke's absence. I answered all points which the Duke saw
      proper to raise upon this matter, and answered them to his
      full satisfaction, as you well know, sir."
    </p>
    <p>
      Very calmly the Grand Master answered him: "My Lord of
      Rhynsault, it was not yet my intention to come to that,
      although come to it in the end I must. But if you rest your
      defence upon it, I am content to proceed along the line you
      are opening."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do rest my defence upon it. His Highness has pronounced
      in this matter, and it is closed."
    </p>
    <p>
      "A matter that is closed by a false statement may be
      reopened at any time when the truth becomes apparent. The
      Duke's highness, as you correctly state, closed this matter
      upon receiving your clear denial that you had granted this
      reprieve, a denial backed by your knightly word. You will
      remember that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do remember it. I am relieved that your lordship does
      the same. I ask myself, this being so, why you presume to
      molest me in this manner and to drag me here to be
      questioned again."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is because, sir, since you uttered that denial to the
      Duke, certain further knowledge has reached me which makes
      it clear that by that denial you abused the Duke's
      confidence and his trust in the knightly word which you had
      pledged. It is upon this further knowledge that the present
      indictment has been drawn. In this I proceed as I must
      suppose the Duke himself would proceed had he remained to
      learn what I have learnt."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Had he remained, you would never have dared--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Shall we keep to the indictment?" He was of a most
      exquisite courtesy in meeting the deliberate rudeness of
      the accused. "Do you maintain here the defence you made
      before the Duke? Do you persist in the denial that you
      granted this reprieve to a convicted traitor?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I answer now as I answered then: the man was hanged. That
      is answer enough. How could he have been hanged if I
      reprieved him? The charge is ludicrous. The facts destroy
      it. You speak of abuse of the Duke's trust. I would beg
      you, Grand Master, and you, sirs"--he swept the judges with
      his fierce eyes--"to beware how far you abuse that same
      trust yourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will answer your question, sir," the Grand Master
      replied, ignoring all else that Rhynsault had said. "How
      this man came to be hanged notwithstanding the reprieve is
      a matter not to be cleared up without seeking more evidence
      than we possess at present. But," he continued,
      impressively and surprisingly, at least in the ears of
      Rhynsault, "that matter is not of great importance; indeed,
      hardly relevant. The existence of the reprieve is a full
      proof of the intention; and in matters connected with
      treason, as I need not explain to you, who are yourself a
      justiciary, the intent is as punishable as the act itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault was utterly contemptuous, in his confidence that
      all this was mere bluster, based upon a faith attached to
      the copy of the reprieve which formed part of the memorial.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The existence of the reprieve might do that," said he, a
      thought too rashly in his arrogance. "But where is this
      reprieve?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The answer took his breath away. "I have it here." And the
      Grand Master displayed a sheet of parchment, which his hand
      had held from the moment he had entered the hall. He turned
      to the judges. "You had best examine it for yourselves
      sirs."
    </p>
    <p>
      Whilst it was being passed round and scanned, there was a
      murmur of excitement in the hall. These proceedings grew
      interesting as a puppet show.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault's face changed colour. Stupidly he had never
      supposed that the original had survived. He had imagined it
      handed to Diesenhofen by Mistress Johanna on that fatal
      October morning, and he had been careless--culpably,
      stupidly careless, as he now perceived--in not making sure
      of it afterwards. Then he took heart again. He was starting
      at shadows. This was no such ponderous matter, after all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up. "May I see this document which I am said to
      have signed?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not merely signed, sir; the whole of it is written in your
      hand. Let him see it for himself, M. de Chavaigny."
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain brought it to him, and held it under his eyes.
      This was the document, indeed. He took the only possible
      line. "That is not my hand!" he blustered. "An impudent
      forgery vindictively prepared to--"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Messire de Rhynsault!" So impressive was the Grand
      Master's voice and raised hand, that the Lorrainer fell
      silent to listen. "Is it worth your while to perjure
      yourself further? There will be men in plenty in Middelburg
      who know your hand. There are two within this hall at this
      instant, who can swear to it: your Fool and the Burgomaster
      of Middelburg. In addition, I could bring an officer of
      your own to swear not only that this reprieve is in your
      hand, but the very circumstances in which it was presented
      to him, which will hardly leave a doubt as to how it came
      to be issued by you. Is it worth while? Shall I call these
      present witnesses? If you persist in denial, I must. But
      let me remind you that the only consequence will be to
      bring you into increased contempt."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault did not need the reminder. He perceived it
      clearly enough; perceived that he was snared. His Fool he
      could not trust; there was no knowing which way that ape
      might jump. The nature of the Burgomaster's testimony was
      certain, and the truth would easily be wrung out of
      Diesenhofen. But in what, after all, was he snared? Why, in
      a cobweb that a gesture of his could destroy. He made that
      gesture without further thought. The Grand Master who
      pursued him so relentlessly might desire to convict him
      upon these trumpery grounds. But it was beyond his power to
      do so without the agreement of the judges, and not by such
      paltry means as those at his command could he ever sway
      them to move against a man whom all the world knew to be
      honoured by the Duke.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Bah!" he cried. "I will not waste your time. It is
      possible that I wrote this thing. I had forgotten it--an
      easy matter considering the pressure of ducal business in
      those days when I worked unremittingly to stamp out treason
      in the province entrusted to me. His Highness is well aware
      of my labours. It is because of them that he has graciously
      promoted me to the governorship of Ghent. Will you, sirs,
      venture to punish me for deeds which his Highness rewards?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "This, sir, is not one of those deeds, as you well know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But can you suppose that this one trivial affair is to be
      set by his Highness against all the other deeds of mine
      which have so stoutly served him?" He was contemptuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To suppose otherwise would be treason in itself, since it
      would assume that his Highness dispenses justice not
      according to the laws of which he is the custodian, but
      according to his own caprice."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I said not that!" cried Rhynsault. He was alarmed to see
      how his words were being twisted, and this so as to impress
      the judges who were sagely nodding their approval of the
      Grand Master's construction.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not consciously," Count Anthony agreed. "But it is the
      meaning of your words when they are properly interpreted.
      Let us, however, keep to the facts, and leave argument
      until afterwards. I understand you, then, to acknowledge
      this reprieve to be in your own hand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault shrugged. "I have already answered you on that."
      And he added insolently: "You may make the most of it."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Master eased at last the stiffness of his pose
      and sat back, lounging a little in his great gilded chair
      of state. He seemed to imply by this that the work was
      done, the matter at an end. The Fool, watching him intently
      with his beady eyes, missing no word that he uttered, and
      fully aware of the tripping cords which each of his
      utterances had supplied for Rhynsault, admired the only
      wits he had ever seen at work which could compare with his
      own. Johanna, stealing glances now and again at Count
      Anthony, marvelled at his impassivity and the silky suavity
      of his voice, and knew that here an avenger had arisen for
      her wrongs whom nothing could resist.
    </p>
    <p>
      He addressed the judges. "Sirs, the Sire de Rhynsault is to
      be commended, at least, in that he has not put it upon us
      to protract this trial beyond what is strictly necessary.
      You have heard his admission that he uttered this reprieve
      upon a man whom he had convicted of high treason, and in
      view of his admission, it is for you, who are men of law,
      to say whether the indictment charging the Sire de
      Rhynsault with high treason has been justified. I will
      limit myself with indicating the point of law upon which
      the indictment has been based. It runs, I think--if I am
      wrong, sirs, it is for you to set me right--it runs that he
      who comforts, shelters, nourishes, aids, or sustains,
      however lightly, a man convicted by a competent tribunal of
      the odious crime of high treason, is himself guilty of that
      odious crime, and is to be accounted the accomplice of the
      man convicted and to suffer in the same degree." He paused
      and looked to right and left of him. "Is that
      interpretation of the law correct?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is, Grand Master," each answered him in turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would appear, then, to be beyond dispute that a man who
      misuses the powers of his gubernatorial office to grant a
      reprieve to a convicted traitor must be held to have given
      aid to that traitor in the highest possible degree, and
      therefore to have rendered himself the man's accomplice and
      thus, himself, become guilty of high treason. I say only
      that it would appear so, because after all it is for you,
      who are to speak to the law, to say whether in effect it is
      so or not. That is what I now invite you to consider."
    </p>
    <p>
      Their consideration was a brief one, their answer
      unanimously that the law of the matter was clear, and the
      Grand Master's application of it to the particular case
      under consideration unanswerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sire de Rhynsault's face became the colour of lead, and
      the sweat stood in beads upon his brow, for all that it was
      chill within that hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In that case, we need not concern ourselves about the
      lesser matter of the guilty neglect to confiscate the
      property of the convicted traitor. That is an omission
      which his successor in the governorship of Zealand may
      amend. Your decision, then, upon the question of law,
      amounts to a finding that the prisoner is guilty of the
      high treason with which the indictment charges him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He put it interrogatively, and the senior of the four
      judges rose in his place to answer him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That, Grand Master, is indubitably our finding. But we
      would urge on the prisoner's behalf that which he, himself,
      has not forgotten to urge: that against this misdemeanour,
      of which he is guilty, should be weighed the zealous
      services which he rendered the Duke's highness during his
      governorship of Zealand."
    </p>
    <p>
      Rhynsault took heart again at that. These judges, after
      all, were not quite so rash and reckless as the Grand
      Master. He leaned forward in his consuming and fearful
      anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very quietly came from Count Anthony the question: "Have
      you ever, in all your vast juridical experience, sir, known
      services of whatever magnitude to be permitted to weigh
      against the heinous sin of treason?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I confess, Grand Master, that I have not."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What reason, then, can you have for urging the services
      admittedly rendered by the Sire de Rhynsault?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not a reason so much as the recollection of the high
      esteem in which the Sire de Rhynsault is held by the Duke's
      highness. Remembering this, we do, whilst delivering
      judgment upon the particular action submitted to us,
      respectfully but earnestly enjoin your lordship that this
      judgment of ours be laid before the Duke himself so that
      his Highness may pronounce upon it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony smiled upon the venerable senior judge. "Your
      respect and your earnestness are not lost upon me, worthy
      sir. But in this injunction you transcend, I think, the
      functions of your office. It is for you to speak to the
      law, and to this you have spoken with your accustomed
      wisdom. To the rest it is for me to speak, and I do so with
      a full sense of my responsibility as the Duke's
      Vicegerent."
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, but already the Sire de Rhynsault perceived the
      doom ascending upon him, and was too appalled to speak, too
      appalled even to curse himself for the readiness with which
      he had acknowledged that reprieve. He should have denied,
      and denied, and so made delays. Then he found the beautiful
      sombre eyes of his judge directed fully upon his. But he
      saw no beauty in them. He saw only remorselessness, belying
      the gentle tones of the voice that reached him in that
      hushed and breathless place.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Claude de Rhynsault," the voice said, addressing him now
      as felons are addressed without the courtesy of any title,
      "you have heard the finding of the judges, which convicts
      you of the high treason for which you have been indicted.
      To what they have uttered it is not my wish to add more
      than your case makes strictly necessary. High treason is
      not an offence that has ever been regarded at any time or
      in any country with any leniency, for of all offences it is
      the most dangerous to the state and the most contagious.
      Therefore, and as you, yourself, no doubt felt when you
      passed sentence of death upon Philip Danvelt, it is the
      duty of those who sit in the seat of justice to extirpate
      it effectively wherever met. To an offence already in
      itself the greatest, you have added in this case a singular
      and unusual heinousness, not to be condoned by God or man."
      He said this slowly, incisively, so that its inner
      meaning--not apparent to the general public--should cut
      deeply into the understanding of Rhynsault. "You have
      abused the powers with which the Duke's highness invested
      you, and defiled the sacred trust imposed upon you by your
      office. In short, you have made a harlot of the Duke's
      justice, to serve aims and purposes of your own." He paused
      for a full moment to let that phrase sink home. Then he
      continued: "What those aims and purposes may have been, we
      do not now inquire, since the knowledge could not possibly
      extenuate your offence, and its further aggravation is not
      necessary to the ends of justice. But in your heart you
      will know them, Rhynsault, and whatever they may have been,
      I can but urge you now to seek the clemency of God for the
      clemency of man is by the law denied you."
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached for the hour-glass, standing on the pulpit by
      his side, the upper bulb of which was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To seek that divine clemency, you shall have one hour.
      When these sands are run, the sentence which I am now to
      pass upon you shall be executed. You are to be taken to the
      great square, and there in public your spurs shall be
      struck off and you shall be degraded from your knightly
      rank, and after that your head shall be severed from your
      body."
    </p>
    <p>
      An audible shiver ran through the hushed press in that
      great hall, as if a gust of wind had stirred through it.
      The Grand Master reversed the hour-glass and set it down
      upon the little table. Then he stood up to depart, and all
      who were seated rose. At last the awed silence was broken
      by the voice of Rhynsault, hoarse, and clamant, the man
      himself restrained by the guards who clung to his arms and
      held him back from hurling himself forward in his frenzy.
      His voice rose almost to a scream. He threatened them with
      the vengeance of the Duke if they dared to execute that
      sentence; he demanded the right to appeal to the Duke in
      person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Grand Master, already moving on his stately way from
      the dais, paused, and raised his hand for silence.
      Rhynsault checked, that he might listen, wildly hoping that
      his threats might have intimidated that rash justiciary.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sentence I have passed upon you," he said, "has been
      passed with the Duke's voice. For here I speak for the Duke
      as you spoke for him in Middelburg when you passed sentence
      there."
    </p>
    <p>
      More than his words, the look in his eyes bore Rhynsault
      the assurance that it was no earthly judgment, but the
      judgment of God which had overtaken him.

    <p>
      Rhynsault was gone, dragged out by the men-at-arms. The
      Grand Master had departed with his judges and attendants.
      The hall was emptying, and still Johanna sat, a woman
      entranced, her hands folded, her eyes almost vacant. Her
      servants and her friendly witnesses waited aloof.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the benches behind her the Fool climbed down from the
      high place whence he had viewed the show. His voice came
      sibilantly into her ear to rouse her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not Solomon in all his glory was more beautiful, more
      poetical, or more just than the Grand Master of Burgundy.
      To be sentenced to death by such a man was more than my
      Lord Rhynsault deserved, and certainly more than he had the
      wit to appreciate."
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked round upon the hunchback, like one who awakens.
      "Do you mock even now?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not mock, madam. I exult. I glory and delight in the
      splendour of the Grand Master. Compared with him, I am but
      a common trickster. He fooled them all to his own ends,
      Rhynsault, the judges, and the law itself, and he may even
      fool the Duke when the Duke comes to ask him to render an
      account of this day's work. Oh, but it was all
      magnificently done, and all in your honour, madam. You may
      take pride in the thought."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pride!" said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Satisfaction at least, then."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Satisfaction? What satisfaction is there in vengeance? It
      is Dead Sea fruit. It crumbles to ashes when it is grasped.
      It cannot restore; it cannot repair."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Lord! And this after all you laboured to obtain it! You
      are hard to please, madam."
    </p>
    <p>
      Considering him, she shook her head, and he saw that there
      were tears in her eyes. She drew a purse, a heavy,
      well-filled purse, from the scrip at her girdle, and
      proffered it. "You have served me well, after your own
      fashion. God alone knows why, considering what you are or
      what you pretend to be."
    </p>
    <p>
      He recoiled, a stricken look leaping to his unhealthy face.
      He had served her well! He! It came to him now that he was
      the author of all her woes, all done in wantonness from
      sheer love of evil. For the first time in all his life he
      was ashamed of his own vileness, and knew not why, knew not
      what withered chord of righteousness had suddenly been
      touched to life within his soul by her. But her gold he
      would not take, not though the imminent loss of his master
      must cast him adrift upon the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The habits of a lifetime supplied him with an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take no payment for my work beyond the payment I have
      had already in laughter over the pricking of that fool's
      bubble who was to be Governor of Ghent. Give your gold to
      the poor. I am rich, for I lack nothing. God save you,
      madam! I must hurry if I would secure a good place to see
      the fall of an empty head."
    </p>
    <p>
      And with a bow which his shape alone rendered fantastic, he
      was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      She followed soon. From the window of her room in the Lion
      of Brabant, she saw a great crowd come flocking down the
      street, as she sat there a little later. They were
      returning, she knew, from the show provided by the
      execution of Rhynsault, and it occurred to her that for the
      second time in her young life she was a widow, she who had
      never really been a wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later still, a tall, cloaked figure came striding
      down the street and across the threshold of the inn.
      Presently a knock fell upon her door, and when it opened in
      answer to her bidding, the tall figure stood there under
      the lintel, the cloak now loosened, the head bare. She fell
      to trembling violently, as with a half-stifled cry she rose
      from her window-seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony advanced. Her eyes devoured his face, noted
      its haggard look, and the lines that had crept into its
      young comeliness since last she had beheld it at close
      quarters on that August night in the garden of the
      Gravenhof, when she defeated temptation in a battle which
      he had scarcely suspected.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood before her, smiling gravely, sadly. It seemed
      impossible to her that he should know all and still stand
      thus before her, still smile thus upon her. Then he spoke,
      and his voice was low-pitched and gentle as a lover's
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Are you content, Johanna?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Content?" she echoed, and she answered him as she had
      already answered the almost identical question from the
      Fool.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Indeed," he agreed with her, "we are not gods, and
      therefor we have our limitations. But within those
      limitations that man has paid in full. He went out to die
      with the iron of retribution deep in his soul. I drove it
      home from the judgment seat before I let him go. He
      understood me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I did," said she. "But what then? He is dead, and I am
      living. Am I the cleaner by his death? Not all his blood
      could wash out one spot of my defilement."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Defilement?" quoth he, and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What else? What else do you account it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long moment before he answered her, and in that
      moment they looked deep each into the eyes of the other.
      His answer when it came rang out. "A sacrament that has
      left you holier than you were. Defilement, do you say? As
      well might we suppose the martyrs of our faith to be damned
      for suicide, because they welcomed a death it was within
      their power to avert."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such thoughts had she used to restore her self-respect and
      imagined them just sophistries. It was an ecstasy to hear
      him utter them, and so know that they must be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Purity," he added, "is of the soul; and over your white
      soul, Johanna, Rhynsault possessed no empire."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yet the world ..." she was beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah, leave the world," he bade her, and took her hand. "Or
      face it under the shelter of my name."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your name?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am asking you to be my countess, Johanna. It is more
      than I ever hoped would be permitted me by Fate. I will
      make amends to you, my dear, for all the suffering I have
      brought upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have brought upon me? You?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He explained himself, and tortured her with the
      explanation, with a joy so exquisite as to be near to pain,
      and the pain so tempered with pride in his words as to be
      akin to joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Your hesitancy, being what you are," she told him, "was
      uttered by the voice of prudence. If you would listen to it
      now, you would not offer me what you have offered. Oh
      Anthony, I love you! That I need not deny to-day. But
      because I love you, we must go our ways, my dear. Let it
      comfort you, and banish the thought that you are to blame
      for any unhappiness of mine, to know that this answer I
      should have made you in Flushing, in my father's house when
      I was still a maid, if in asking me you had told me who you
      were."
    </p>
    <p>
      She set a hand upon his shoulder, turned her face upwards,
      and frankly met the sombre gaze of his dark eyes now full
      of pain. "I shall thank God every night of my life that you
      have sought me, Anthony; for in the pride you have brought
      me, you have restored to me all that I had lost."
    </p>
    <p>
      He strove to move her from this by every argument a lover
      knows. But she remained unshaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are a great prince, and I am the daughter of a
      merchant and the widow of another merchant. We are not
      matched as the world judges."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The world! The world!" he cried impatiently. "What have we
      to do with the world?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Merely to live in it," said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You and I are outside all of that, predestined mates, as
      once before I protested to you that my instincts told me,
      some inner voice whose truth is beyond doubting."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you convince your father, the Duke of Guelders, of
      that? Or your lady mother? Or your kin? Or the people over
      whom you are one day to rule and who would then have me for
      their duchess? Don't you see how impossible it is, my
      dear?"
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, but cared not. They should accept what he desired.
      And so he argued long, but all in vain, and at last upon
      the rock of that resolve the argosy of his rich hopes was
      shattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He bowed to her will when that befell. "I will not press
      you further now. But I am as certain that the destiny which
      has made clear at last the path will not suffer us to end
      our lives apart." Abruptly he asked her: "Whither do you
      go, Johanna?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She told him that she would be returning to her father's
      house in Flushing, to continue the supervision of the
      shipbuilding yards which she had inherited. "As for the
      heritage from Philip, I was glad to hear you pronounce
      to-day that it shall go from me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was an inevitable part of the line I took," he said.
      "When I did so, I had hoped so confidently to make you the
      reparation in which you deny me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do not give yourself concern. I have enough without that,
      and I have no real right to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      She suffered him to kiss her at parting. It was their first
      kiss, and her own firm resolve that it should be their
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning early she departed from Brussels, her mission
      there so singularly accomplished. If she bore sorrow and
      longings with her, yet she bore more peace than she had
      ever hoped to know again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind her, however, she left little peace in the heart of
      Anthony. And to his unrest on her behalf was presently to
      be added unrest on quite other grounds. For at noon that
      day, to the amazement of all, the Duke, attended by a small
      company of men-at-arms, rode into Brussels and straight to
      the palace. In spite of all precautions, the news of
      Rhynsault's arrest had gone after his Highness, reached him
      as he was about to embark at Sluys, and brought him back in
      a towering rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate, thought the Grand Master, when he beheld
      the furious Duke come striding into his closet, that he had
      caused execution to follow so swiftly upon the heels of
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You know why I am here!" the Duke blazed at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony had risen. He strove successfully for calm to
      meet this onslaught. "An event of yesterday has probably
      been misrepresented to you."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Misrepresented? Yes, if you mean that it is untrue that
      Rhynsault has been tried and executed for the affair of
      Middelburg. God of my life! You have dared to abuse my
      trust! Dared to trump up this business and to reverse the
      judgment which I myself already had pronounced! That is to
      push temerity singularly far. It is something for which you
      may have to meet a heavy reckoning."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You have, indeed, been misinformed," said the Count. "It
      will save time if you read the judgment, which was set down
      in details by the clerks. There you will find that the
      matter upon which I judged him was not at all the matter
      upon which you acquitted him. He was indicted for high
      treason. But read the judgment for yourself." And he
      proffered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before so much apparent calm, arguing an easy conscience,
      the Duke's wrath took pause. Swiftly he read the document
      thrust upon him. But not to the end. Two thirds of the way
      through, he flung it down.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Trickery!" he roared. "Sheer trickery!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "You cannot have observed that the judgment was pronounced
      not by me, but by your own judges. After that I had no
      alternative but to sentence him to death."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You coerced them into it. You duped them! But, by God, you
      do not dupe me! You knew that I valued this man, that he
      had served me well, and that I needed him in Ghent. And you
      have deprived me of him to satisfy an obstinacy of your
      own. Of what did you accuse him? Of subverting my justice
      to serve his own ends, was it not? That shall be your own
      indictment." And he swung in his passion upon a cowering
      page of the Count's. "Summon me the guard, boy."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The guard!" said Count Anthony. "Charles, you cannot
      arrest me. I am a Prince of Guelders."
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you were the Pope of Rome and, having accepted the
      office of Grand Master here, had so misused it, I should
      arrest you and bring you to account."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will regret this when you are calm."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So will you regret having taken off Rhynsault's head. God
      of my life! The audacity of you!" He advanced upon him in
      his fury, and suddenly putting forth his hand seized the
      emblem of the Golden Fleece that hung upon Count Anthony's
      neck. With a wrench he snapped the chain that carried it,
      and so tore it from him. "You wear that no longer, sir. If
      I am Duke of Burgundy, a hempen collar shall take its
      place."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony stiffened. "You dishonoured that collar,
      Charles, when you thought to hang it about the filthy neck
      of your knave Rhynsault. My only regret at being deprived
      of it concerns the way in which you have taken it."
    </p>
    <p>
      This had the effect of further infuriating that man of
      violent passions. He raised his hand. Count Anthony did not
      flinch. His eyes were steadily upon the Duke, and the voice
      was steady in which he admonished him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nay! If you strike me, Charles, I shall be constrained to
      dispel your growing illusions that you are divine."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Duke's hand fell to his side. The guard came in at that
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony's arrest made some stir. His brother Adolph
      posted off to Nimeguen with the news, and from the old Duke
      of Guelders came strong representations to the Duke of
      Burgundy, which the Duke of Burgundy entirely disregarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial followed ten days later, presided over by the
      Duke in person, and was attended by as much of Brussels as
      could pack itself into the great hall of the palace, where
      it was publicly held. Count Anthony had demanded trial by
      the Chapter of the Golden Fleece, as was his right. The
      Duke had trampled upon that right, as he was prepared at
      all times to trample upon every right that stood in the way
      to his self-willed ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he was to make the discovery that there were certain
      things upon which he could not trample. One of these things
      was the law, however much he might boast that the law was
      embodied in himself. After all, he sat with judges, the
      same judges who had sat with Count Anthony; and scowl upon
      them, browbeat them though he might, he could not move them
      from the interpretation which they chose to put upon the
      law, which was the interpretation that Count Anthony, ably
      arguing, compelled them to put upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I take my stand with confidence," he had said in answer to
      the accusation of abuse of trust, "upon the indictment of
      the Sire de Rhynsault. That indictment was found to be
      justified by the fact upon which it was based. That fact
      was subsequently established by the confession of the
      accused himself. To charge me with having used this matter
      of a reprieve to pronounce a judgment counter to the wishes
      of your Highness is by implication to accuse your Highness
      of subverting the law of which you are the sacred custodian
      to private purposes of your own."
    </p>
    <p>
      Although his temerity in this last may have appalled the
      judges, upon the soundness of his main argument they were
      not to be shaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We find," said their dean and spokesman, the same who had
      urged Count Anthony's delay in the execution of Rhynsault,
      "that the utmost complaint justly to be made against the
      Grand Master is of having acted with unnecessary
      precipitancy in the execution of the sentence. But that is
      not an offence at law, and it is not lawful to frame a law
      to meet an event subsequent to that event's occurrence."
    </p>
    <p>
      To which Count Anthony had ventured to reply that the
      senior judge had contradicted himself. Because, if a thing
      were not an offence at law, it could not justly be termed
      in a court of justice a ground for just complaint against
      any man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus was the Duke baulked of his angry aims and compelled
      to pronounce the acquittal of the Count, the more incensed
      against him because the necessity was imposed upon him by
      the craftiness with which Count Anthony had gone to work in
      the matter of Rhynsault.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though he acquitted him, see him again he would not. On
      his return to his apartments in the palace, an officer
      brought the Count a brief note in which he was requested to
      depart the Duke's dominions within twenty-four hours.
      Disobedience of this order of exile must, of course, be
      attended by very serious consequences. Because of the love
      that had existed between them, Count Anthony begged a last
      audience of Charles. This was refused him. Disgraced and
      banished, the Count set out for Guelders on the morrow.
    </p>
    <p>

      REALITIES
    </h1>
    <p>
       
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of Count Anthony's disgrace preceded him to
      Nimeguen, where, indeed, little else had occupied the minds
      of the Court since the hawk-faced Adolph had come back
      there with the tale of his brother's arrest and of the
      grounds of it. Adolph denounced Anthony's conduct as having
      ruined the credit of the House of Guelders at the Court of
      Burgundy, and presently brought the old Duke and the still
      handsome Duchess to the same view. From the Court this view
      came to spread through the town of Nimeguen and thence to
      permeate the state itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It follows that the Count was given a cool reception on his
      arrival home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old Duke, bearded like a goat and bleating like one,
      bitterly upbraided his son, spoke of the shame which his
      conduct reflected upon his House and the grave consequences
      which the loss of Burgundy's friendship might bring upon
      the state. In short, like the Duke of Burgundy,
      notwithstanding the clear finding of the Burgundian judges
      and the Count's acquittal of the charge, the Duke of
      Guelders persisted in the view that Count Anthony had been
      guilty of a gross betrayal of trust and had dishonoured his
      office to serve certain dark ends of his own. In this the
      weak old man had been soundly educated by his enterprising
      and ambitious younger son.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is bitter to reflect," he told Count Anthony, "that the
      valuable services rendered the Duke of Burgundy by your
      brother Adolph, that his very alliance with the Duke's
      sister-in-law, should all have been wasted by your
      unpardonable and discreditable offences."
    </p>
    <p>
      Count Anthony roused himself from his listlessness and
      weary disgust with the world to defend this impugnment of
      his honour. He pointed out that he had been cleared of the
      charges by his acquittal; that independent and unbiased
      judges had refused to say that he had been guilty of
      violating his trust, but, on the contrary, had held that
      what he had done was no less than the duty imposed upon him
      by his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact that the good relations between Burgundy and
      Guelders had been jeopardised was, however, beyond dispute.
      It was even rumoured that a Chapter of the Golden Fleece
      was about to be summoned for the purpose of considering,
      upon the Duke's instigation, the expulsion of Count Anthony
      from the order. Count Anthony, however, anticipated it by
      the formal resignation of an honour, the insignia of which
      had already been torn from his neck by his passionate
      cousin. He did so in humble terms, studiously framed to
      avoid offence, so that the breach between the two duchies
      should not be widened. This, after all, in the Count's
      view, was a grave matter, and one which his duty to the
      State of Guelders forbade him to neglect. After all,
      whatever the finding of the court, in his heart Count
      Anthony knew that Charles of Burgundy was justified of his
      anger. The Count had knowingly and deliberately proceeded
      in opposition to the Duke's wishes; he had tricked the
      judges and made himself secure by a sophistical and
      insincere interpretation of the law. And that he had abused
      the trust reposed in him by the Duke of Burgundy was beyond
      question. For the peace of his conscience it remained that
      in honour he was justified of that abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the consequences to himself he troubled little. But of
      the consequences to Guelders he must think seriously. It
      was not beyond possibility that, if the present situation
      of severed relationship between the two courts were
      permitted to continue, there might be found in it, by the
      voracious ambition of Charles of Burgundy, a pretext for
      war, which could end only in the absorption of Guelders
      into the steadily spreading Burgundian dominions.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was brought home to Count Anthony after he had been a
      fortnight in Nimeguen at a council held by his father and
      composed of the six representatives of the noblest houses
      of Guelders, the Chancellor of the Duchy, and Adolph of
      Egmont, the Marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chancellor voiced the general feeling when he put it to
      Count Anthony that it was his duty to the state to make
      some personal effort to conciliate the Duke of Burgundy, to
      seek to mollify his wrath by some act of self-abasement or
      reparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I might wait upon him in my shirt, barefooted, and with a
      halter about my neck. That is the sort of self-abasement he
      loves to see, especially in cold weather. He has more than
      once imposed it upon the representatives of his Flemish
      subjects. Would that content you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His levity in such a matter shocked them. Adolph, feeling
      that the Council would support him, expressed himself
      strongly upon his brother's lack of grace. Anthony bowed to
      the rebuke, but his lips smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have an alternative to offer," he said. "It is that I
      abdicate my rights of succession in the Duchy. That should
      give a full effect to the Duke of Burgundy's desire to see
      me suffer for what he accounts my misdeeds. It is a
      punishment that must entirely satisfy him and so restore
      the harmony between himself and the State of Guelders."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adolph's eyes gleamed. The old Duke, who was entirely under
      the sway of his younger son, sat very still with vacant
      glance and combed his goat's beard in silence. But the
      others, beginning with the Chancellor, dashed Adolph's
      hopes by the vehemence with which they repudiated any such
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, they were very far from reposing a full trust in
      Adolph; and his father, they knew, had ceased seriously to
      count. Anthony might have his eccentricities; he might be
      something of a dreamer and a poet, addicted to romantic
      notions; but at the same time they knew that they could
      build upon his honour as upon a rock, and they had received
      proofs of his considerable abilities, not only at home, but
      in the activities in Burgundy which in the past had so
      endeared him to Duke Charles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Protest as they might, however, Count Anthony showed them
      that what he had put forward as a suggestion was already a
      deliberately weighed resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was not born," he told them quietly, "to fill the office
      of ruler in a state. My endowments are not those for which
      the office calls, and, if I am to be frank with you, that
      is with me no matter for regret. I have seen little to
      admire in those same endowments. My brother Adolph
      possesses them in a high degree. Of this," he continued
      more briskly, "I have been long aware, and what I now
      propose to do, I should have done before but that I
      conceived it to be against the duty which my birth imposed
      upon me. From the moment that it becomes clear, as clear it
      has become, that, in consequence of the circumstances which
      have arisen, my abdication will actually benefit the state,
      my last qualm vanishes. My abdication becomes a duty, the
      highest service I can render Guelders."
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Count Anthony firmly adhered in spite of arguments
      which were protracted for some days. In the end, seeing him
      unshaken in his determination, and since no faintest
      opposition to it came from either his father or his
      brother, the Chancellor and the nobles bowed to his wishes,
      consoling themselves with the immediate advantages to
      Guelders in a reparation to the Duke of Burgundy beyond
      anything that he could have demanded or expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, when the news reached Charles that the abdication
      of his cousin Anthony's rights of succession to the Duchy
      of Guelders was the amend which Guelders offered for any
      displeasure the Count might have occasioned him, such a
      revulsion of feeling arose in him that he actually
      considered demanding the cancellation of that act, as
      unjustly excessive. That impulse subsiding, however, he
      determined to leave things as they were, and wrote a
      courteous and friendly letter to the Duke of Guelders in
      which he expressed his appreciation of this vindication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emboldened by the terms of this letter, which were
      communicated to him at his castle of Valburg, whither he
      had retired, Count Anthony wrote to Duke Charles, begging
      him for the sake of their ancient friendship to ease the
      decree of banishment at least to the extent of permitting
      him to pass freely through Burgundian dominions should he
      desire to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The irascible and unforgiving Charles accorded him so much,
      but accorded it grudgingly. The Sire Anthony of Egmont--a
      ducal secretary wrote, deliberately omitting a title which
      had belonged, not to the man, but to the office of heir to
      the duchy--was permitted free passage through and sojourn
      in all the states under the dominion of his Highness the
      Duke of Burgundy, upon the condition, however, that he
      should not come at any time within twenty miles of the
      ducal court, wherever it might happen to have its seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      This befell early in March of the year 1469. At once Count
      Anthony made such preparations for departure that men must
      assume there was no intention of returning. He sold his
      castle and lands of Valburg, which belonged to him
      personally, went to take leave of the ducal family, and
      departed the duchy without any state and accompanied only
      by a body-servant, that same François who had been with him
      earlier upon his travels. Thus he passed out of Guelders
      and out of the history of nations, which, therefore, takes
      no account of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a morning of early April he came to Flushing, and,
      leaving horse and servant at the inn, he repaired on foot
      to the big red house, in the courtyard of which the stork
      once again advanced to welcome him, on the wall of which
      the quail were fluttering in their osier cage, whilst
      beneath them in the beds the tulips reared again their
      white and yellow heads, those tulips which once he had
      borne for his device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Jan gasped at sight of him, and, breathless, ushered
      him into the house, into that dining-room so full of
      memories, and there left him whilst he went in quest of his
      mistress. Not long was he kept waiting. The rustle of a
      gown heard through the door which Jan had left ajar soon
      heralded her coming. The sound seemed to draw the blood to
      his heart, to leave him pale, to quicken his breath, and
      turn his knees to water. Not in all his life had he known
      so overpowering an emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then as the door opened he span round, and they faced each
      other across that little space. She regarding him with
      startled incredulous eyes out of a face as pale as his own,
      her bosom rising and falling rapidly within its tapering
      corsage.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My lord," she said to him, "why have you come?"
    </p>
    <p>
      His answer went to the heart of things. "Because I am no
      lord. All that is done. In Brussels, three months ago, you
      said to me that, had I been just the Anthony Egmont I
      called myself when first I stepped within this house, all
      might have been possible between us. To-day I am no longer
      a Prince of Guelders, no longer heir to a duchy. All that I
      have stripped off and cast from me, indeed, constrained to
      it by circumstances which leave me no regrets. I am just
      Anthony Egmont, a man of simple estate. Read the
      safe-conduct under which I travel, and convince yourself of
      that." And he proffered her the letter in which the Duke of
      Burgundy sanctioned his sojourn in Burgundian lands. "Read
      it, Johanna, and then, if your heart bids you, repeat to me
      what you said in Brussels three months since. The
      conditions are fulfilled."
    </p>
    <p>
      In her bewilderment, not knowing what else to do, perhaps
      because she needed a moment to consider, she took that
      scrap of parchment. When she had read it, she shook her
      head and looked at him almost piteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I do not know what it means."
    </p>
    <p>
      "It means that I am here to seek work in your shipyards, to
      learn, if you will give me employment, the art of building
      ships, so that I may give my energies and such ability as I
      may possess to the safeguarding of your interests."
