  <h2><a id="ch1"
     name="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I</h2>

  <p class="first">THE tramp looked to be less savoury than most tramps; and
  more dangerous. For he was playing with a serviceable automatic pistol,
  throwing it from one hand and catching it with the other, balancing its
  muzzle on his forefinger with an anxious eye as it leaned first one way and
  then another; or letting it slip through his hands until the barrel was
  pointing earthward. This pistol was rather like a precious plaything; he
  could neither keep his eyes nor hands from it, and when, tired of the toy, he
  slipped it into the pocket of his tattered trousers, the disappearance was
  momentary. Out it came again, to be fondled and tossed and spun.</p>

  <p>"Such things cannot be!" said the tramp aloud, not once, but many times in
  the course of his play.</p>

  <p>He was unmistakably English, and what an English tramp was doing on the
  outskirts of Littleburg, in the State of New York, requires, but for the
  moment evades, explanation.</p>

  <p>He was not pleasant even as tramps go. His face was blotched and swollen,
  he carried a week's growth of beard, one eye was recovering from the violent
  impact of a fist delivered a week before by a brother tramp whom he had
  awakened at an inconvenient moment. He might explain the swelling by his
  ignorance of the properties of poison ivy, but there was nobody interested
  enough to ask. His collarless shirt was grimy, his apology for a jacket had
  bottomless pits for pockets; on the back of his head, as he juggled the
  pistol, he maintained an ancient derby hat badly dented, the rim
  rat-eaten.</p>

  <p>"Such things cannot be," said the tramp, who called himself Robin ... the
  pistol slipped from his hand and fell on his foot. He said "Ouch!" like a
  Christian man and rubbed the toe that was visible between upper and sole.</p>

  <p>Somebody was coming through the little wood. He slipped the pistol into
  his pocket and, moving noiselessly between bushes, crouched down.</p>

  <p>A girl, rather pretty, he thought; very slim and graceful, he saw. A local
  aristocrat, he guessed. She wore a striped silk dress and swung a walking
  stick with great resolution.</p>

  <p>She stopped almost opposite him and lit a cigarette. Whether for effect or
  enjoyment was her own mystery. Not a hundred yards away the wood path joined
  the town road, and a double line of big frame houses were inhabited by the
  kind of people who would most likely be shocked by the spectacle of a
  cigarette-smoking female. "Effect," thought Robin. "Bless the woman, she's
  going to set 'em alight!"</p>

  <p>From where he crouched he had seen the look of distaste with which she had
  examined the feebly smoking cylinder. She puffed tremendously to bring it
  into working order and then went on. He rather sympathized with people who
  shocked folks: he had shocked so many himself, and was to continue.</p>

  <p>Leisurely he returned to the path. Should he wait for nightfall or make a
  circuit of the town? There must be a road west of the rolling mills to the
  north or past the big cheese factory to the south. Or should he walk boldly
  through the main street, endure the questions and admonitions of a vigilant
  constabulary, and risk being run out of town so long as they ran him out at
  the right end? He had elected for the first course even before he gave the
  matter consideration. The town way was too dangerous. Red Beard might be
  there, and the fat little man who ran so surprisingly fast and threw knives
  with such extraordinary skill.</p>

  <p>Another pedestrian was coming&mdash;walking so softly on rubber shoes that
  Robin did not hear him until too late. He was a lank young man, very smartly
  dressed, with a straw hat, adorned with a college ribbon, tilted over his
  right eye. The buckle of the belt which encircled his wasp waist and
  supported nicely creased trousers was golden, his shirt beautifully figured.
  He might have just walked out of any ad. page of almost any magazine.</p>

  <p>The rather large mouth twisted in a grin at the sight of the ragged figure
  sitting by the path side.</p>

  <p>"'Lo, bo!"</p>

  <p>"'Lo!" said Robin.</p>

  <p>"Going far?"</p>

  <p>"Not far&mdash;Canada, I guess. I'll get ferried over from
  Ogdensburg."</p>

  <p>"Fine: got your passport 'n' everything?"</p>

  <p>Sarcasm was wasted on Robin.</p>

  <p>"I'll get past on my face," he said.</p>

  <p>The young man chuckled and offered a very silvery case, thought better of
  it, and withdrew the cigarette himself. Robin respected the precaution; his
  hands were not very clean.</p>

  <p>He lit the cigarette with a match that he took from the lining of his hat,
  and smoked luxuriously.</p>

  <p>"You won't find it easy. Those Canadian police are fierce. A fellow I know
  used to run hooch across, but you can't do that now&mdash;too fierce."</p>

  <p>He was enjoying his condescension, his fellowship with the lowly and the
  possibly criminal. He was broad-minded, he explained. He had often talked
  with the genus hobo and had learned a lot. Only a man of the world could talk
  with tramps without loss of dignity. One need not be common because one
  associated with common people.</p>

  <p>"That's what I can't get our folks to understand," he complained. "Old
  people get kind of narrow-minded ... and girls. Colleges ruin girls. They get
  stuck up and nobody's good enough for 'em. And Europe ... meeting lords and
  counts that are only after their money. I say 'See America first.'"</p>

  <p>Robin the tramp sent a cloud of gray smoke up to the pine tops.</p>

  <p>"Somebody said it before you," he suggested. "It sounds that way to
  me."</p>

  <p>The young man's name was Samuel Wasser. His father kept the biggest store
  in Littleburg&mdash;Wasser's Universal Store. Samuel believed that every man
  was entitled to live his own life, and was careful to explain that a young
  man's own life was an altogether different life from any that was planned for
  him by people who were "past it."</p>

  <p>"I made seven thousand dollars in one year," he said. "I got in with a
  live crowd fall before last. But the Canadian police are fierce, and the
  Federal officers are fiercer&mdash;still, seven thousand!"</p>

  <p>He was very young; had the joy of youth in displaying his own virtues and
  superior possessions. He rattled certain keys in his pocket, hitched up his
  vivid tie, looked despisingly at the main street of Littleburg, and asked:
  "Did you see a young lady come along? Kind of stripey dress?"</p>

  <p>Robin nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm getting married to-night," said Samuel lugubriously. "<i>Got</i> to!
  It's a mistake, but <i>they're</i> all for it. My governor and her uncle.
  It's tough on me. A man ought to see something of life. It isn't as though I
  was one of these country Jakes, jump at the first skirt he sees. I'm a
  college man and I know there's something beyond, a bigger world"&mdash;he
  described illustrative circles with his hands&mdash;"sort of&mdash;well, you
  know what I mean, bo."</p>

  <p>Robin knew what he meant.</p>

  <p>"Seems funny talking all this stuff to you, but you're a man of the world.
  Folks look down on you boys, but you <i>see</i> things&mdash;the wide-open
  spaces of God's world."</p>

  <p>"Sure," said Robin. The tag had a familiar ring. "Where men are men," he
  added. He had not seen a movie show since&mdash;a long time; but his memory
  was retentive.</p>

  <p>"Have another cigarette. Here, two. I'll be getting along."</p>

  <p>Robin followed the dapper figure of the bridegroom until it was out of
  sight. He wished he had asked him for a dollar.</p>

  <p>Looking up into the western sky, he saw above the dim haze that lay on the
  horizon the mass of a gathering storm.</p>

  <p>"Maybe it will come soon," he said hopefully.</p>

  <p>Red Beard did not like rain, and the fat little man who threw knives
  loathed it.</p>

  <h2><a id="ch2"
     name="ch2"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

  <p class="first">MR. PFFIEFER was a stout man with a sense of humour; but
  since he was a lawyer having his dealings with a dour people who had one
  public joke which served the whole county when recited at Farmers'
  Conventions, and one private obscenity which, told in a smoky atmosphere
  'twixt shuffle and cut, had convulsed generations of hearers, he never
  displayed the bubbling sense of fun that lay behind his pink mask of a
  face.</p>

  <p>He could have filled his untidy office with unholy laughter now, but he
  kept a solemn face, for the man who sat on the opposite side of a table
  covered with uneven mounds of paper, law books, and personal memoranda was a
  great personage, a justice of the peace and the leading farmer in the
  county.</p>

  <p>"Let me get this thing right, Mr. Pffiefer." Andrew Elmer's harsh voice
  was tense with anxiety. "I get noth'n' out of this estate unless October is
  married on her twen'y-first anniversary?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Pffiefer inclined his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"That is how the will reads." His podgy fingers smoothed out the
  typewritten document before him.</p><br>

  <p class="typewriter">To my brother-in-law twenty thousand dollars and the
  residue of my estate to my daughter October Jones to be conveyed on the
  marriage of my daughter on or before the twenty-first anniversary of her
  birth.</p><br>

  <p>Andrew Elmer scratched his head irritably.</p>

  <p>"That lawyer over in Ogdensburg figured it out this way. I get twenty
  thousand dollars anyway. Then when October marries&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is responsible for this curious instrument?" interrupted the
  lawyer.</p>

  <p>Andrew shifted uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Well, I guess I drew it up. Jenny left most all her business to me."</p>

  <p>He was a thin man with a hard, angular face and the habit of moving his
  lips in silent speech. He held long conversations with himself, his straight
  slit of a mouth working at a great speed though no sound came. Now he spoke
  to himself rapidly, his upper lip going up and down almost comically.</p>

  <p>"Never was any reason to have this thing tested," he said at last.
  "Jenny's money was tied up in mortgages an' they only just fell in. It was
  that bank president over at Ogdensburg that allowed I didn't ought to touch
  the money till October was married. I figured it out this way. That the
  residoo's all that concerns her ..."</p>

  <p>"Is there any residue, Mr. Elmer?"</p>

  <p>There was a certain dryness in the lawyer's tone, but Elmer saw nothing
  offensive in the question.</p>

  <p>"Why, no; not much. Naturally there's always a home for October with me
  an' Mrs. Elmer. That's God's holy ord'nance&mdash;to protect the fatherless
  an' everything. She's been a great expense&mdash;college an' clothes, an' the
  wedding'll cost something. I figured it out when I drawed up that
  will..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pffiefer sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"Your legacy is contingent&mdash;just as October's is contingent. When is
  the wedding to be?"</p>

  <p>Like a ghost of wintry sunlight was the fleeting brightness which came to
  Elmer's harsh face.</p>

  <p>"To-night; that's why I dropped in to see you. Mrs. Elmer figured it this
  way: you can be too economic, says she. For a dollar 'r so you can get the
  law of it, so's there'll be no come-back. I'd feel pretty mean if after
  October was out of the&mdash;was fixed up, there was a rumpus over the
  will."</p>

  <p>"Marrying Sam Wasser, ain't she?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer nodded, his eyes fixed on the buggy and the lean horse that was
  hitched just outside the window. That cadaverous animal was eating greedily
  from the back of a hay wagon which had been incautiously drawn up within
  reach.</p>

  <p>"Yeh&mdash;Sam's a nice feller."</p>

  <p>He ruminated on this for a while.</p>

  <p>"October's kind of crazy&mdash;no, not about Sam. Obstinate as an old
  mule. She goes mad&mdash;yes, sir. Seen her stand on the top of the well an'
  say, 'You touch me an' I'll jump right in'&mdash;yes, sir. Sparin' the rod's
  the ruin of this generation. My father took a slat to all of us, boy an' girl
  alike. An' I'm her guardian, ain't I? Mrs. Elmer reckons that a spankin' is
  just what October wants. But there it is&mdash;she didn't holler 'r anything,
  just walked to the well an' said, 'If you beat me I'll jump in.' I figure
  that self-destruction is about the wickedest thing anybody can talk about. It
  goes plumb clean in the face of divine Providence. That's October. She'll do
  most anything, but it's got to be done her way. Sam's a nice, slick young
  feller. His pa's got building lots and apartment houses down in Ogdensburg,
  besides the store, and Sam's made money. I'm not sayin' that I'd like to make
  profit on the degradation&mdash;to the level of the beasts in the
  field&mdash;of my fellow critters, but the money's good."</p>

  <p>The lawyer pieced together and interpreted, from this disjointed evidence
  of October's wickedness and Sam Wasser's virtues, a certain difficulty in the
  operation of match-making.</p>

  <p>"October's just as hard as a flint stone. She's never found grace, though
  me an' Mrs. Elmer's prayed an' prayed till we're just sick of prayin' an'
  Reverend Stevens has put in a whole lot of private supplications to the
  Throne. I guess Satan does a lot of work around these high schools."</p>

  <p>There was a silence. Mr. Elmer's long, shaven upper lip wrinkled and
  straightened with uncanny rapidity. The fascinated Mr. Pffiefer, a student of
  lip reading, saw words: "October," "Giving trouble," and, many times,
  "money."</p>

  <p>He became audible.</p>

  <p>"You never know where you're at with October. S'pose you say 'October,
  there's a chicken pie for dinner,' she says 'Yes.' And when you hand out the
  plate she says, 'I don't eat chicken pie,' just like that. Don't say anything
  till you push the plate at her."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer relapsed into silence; evidently his mind had reverted to the
  will. The lawyer read "residue" and "hell" and other words.</p>

  <p>"She's fast, too. Smoking on Main Street only this morning, and after I
  prayed an' Mrs. Elmer almost went down on her knees."</p>

  <p>"What was the great idea?" Mr. Pffiefer permitted himself the question.
  "This will, I mean. Why residue, why marriage, before October's twenty-first
  anniversary?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer glanced at him resentfully.</p>

  <p>"Jenny believed in marryin' young, for one thing. And that's right, Mr.
  Pffiefer. The Psalmist said, 'A maid&mdash;'"</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," said the lawyer, a little testily, "we know what he said. But
  David never was my idea of a Sabbath school teacher. Mrs. Jones's views are
  understandable. But fixing the will that way&mdash;I can't get round that,
  somehow. Almost looks as if it was a bribe to get October off your
  hands."</p>

  <p>His bright eyes transfixed Mr. Elmer for a second, but that worthy and
  conscientious man stared dumbly through the window. If he heard the challenge
  he did not accept it.</p>

  <p>"Almost looks," said Pffiefer, with a hint of rising heat, "as if this
  humbug about the residue of an estate which palpably and obviously has no
  existence was a lure to a likely bridegroom. Sounds grand, 'residue of my
  estate,' but so far as I can see, Elmer, there are ten acres of marsh and a
  cottage that no man or woman could ever live in&mdash;say five hundred
  dollars ...?"</p>

  <p>He jerked his head on one side inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Twen'y-five hundred dollars," murmured Mr. Elmer. "Got a feller over from
  Ogdens to value it. He said the new Lakes canal might be cut right through
  that property. What'll I be owing you, Mr. Pffiefer?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer's first inclination was to say "Nothing," but he thought better
  of that.</p>

  <p>"Ten dollars," he said briefly, and saw the old man wince.</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer paid on the nail, but he paid with pain. At the door of the
  office he paused. A thought occurred to the lawyer.</p>

  <p>"Say, Mr. Elmer, suppose Sam doesn't want to marry? He's got kind of smart
  lately. And he has more money than seems right."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer shifted uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Sam's a worker," he said. "He's made money out of real estate&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where?" asked the other bluntly. "I know as much about realty in this
  country as the next man, and I don't remember seein' Sam's name figurin' in
  any deal."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer was edging to the door.</p>

  <p>"I think the rain'll hold up long enough to get in the corn," he stated.
  "Roots are just no good at all. Maybe I'll get you to fix that new lease I've
  gave to Orson Clark."</p>

  <p>On this good and promising line he made his exit.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pffiefer saw him climb slowly into the buggy and untie the reins. He
  had touched a very sore place; Mr. Elmer was panic-stricken. And there was
  every reason why he should be.</p>

  <p>Give a dog a bad name and hang him. Give a man, or, worse, a woman, a name
  which is neither Mary nor Jane but hovers somewhere about the opposite end of
  the pole, and she attracts to herself qualities and weaknesses which in some
  ineffable way are traceable to her misguided nomenclature.</p>

  <p>They who named October Jones were with the shades, though one of them had
  lived long enough to repent of his enterprise.</p>

  <p>October, under local and topical influences, had at various times and on
  particular occasions styled herself Doris Mabel, and Mary Victoria, and
  Gloria Wendy. At the Flemming School she was Virginia Guinevere: she chose
  that name before she left home and had her baggage boldly initialled V. G.
  J.</p>

  <p>"I guess I can't get rid of the Jones," she said thoughtfully, her
  disapproving eye upon the "J." "That old sea-man will kind of hang around,
  with his chubby little knees under my ears, all time."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid so," said her parent wearily.</p>

  <p>He had been a tall man, hollow cheeked, long bearded. Children did not
  interest him; October bored him. She had a trick of borrowing rare volumes
  from his library and leaving them on a woodpile or amid the goldenrod or
  wherever she happened to be when it started raining.</p>

  <p>"Jones was a pretty mean kind of name," she suggested. "Can't you change
  it, Daddy?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Jones sighed and tapped his nose with a tortoise-shell paper
  knife.</p>

  <p>"It satisfied my father, my grandfather, and my great-grandfather, and
  innumerable ancestors before them&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Her brows knit.</p>

  <p>"Who was the first Jones?" she demanded. "I'll have to get the biology of
  that. I guess they sort of came out of their protoplasms simultaneous."</p>

  <p>"-ly!" murmured Mr. Jones. "I wish you would get out of that habit,
  October&mdash;"</p>

  <p>October groaned.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with Virginia?" she asked. "That is one cute little
  name."</p>

  <p>There was nothing that was October in her appearance, for October is a red
  and brown month, and she was pinkish and whitish: she had April eyes and hair
  that was harvest colour, and she had a queer, searching habit of glance that
  was disconcerting. People who did not know her read into this an offensive
  skepticism, while in reality it was eagerness for knowledge.</p>

  <p>As to her moral character:</p>

  <p>Miss Washburton Flemming, Principal of the Flemming Preparatory School for
  Girls, wrote to her father:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">...I would point out one characteristic of October's which
  may have escaped your observation, and that is her Intense Romanticism,
  which, linked as it is with an Exaltation of Spirit, may lead her into ways
  which we should all deplore. It is unfortunate that the dear child was denied
  the inestimable boon of a Mother's Love. Perhaps she is more self-controlled
  to-day than she was when she came under our care ...</p><br>

  <p>"How much more of this stuff?" snarled Stedman Jones as he turned the
  page. There were three more pages and a two-page postscript. He dropped the
  letter on the floor.</p>

  <p>He really didn't care how intense or how romantic October was, or how
  exalted she might be. While he paid her fees and her amazing extras he did
  not wish people to write letters to him about her or anybody or anything. He
  had not to buy her dresses, thank heavens. There was an income from his
  wife's estate administered by a lout of a brother-in-law whom he had only met
  twice in his lifetime and with whom, in consequence, he had only quarrelled
  twice.</p>

  <p>Stedman was a bibliophile, the author of a scholarly volume of mediaeval
  French history, and the only time he was ever really cheerful with October
  was the last week of her short vacations.</p>

  <p>Nobody ever called her Virginia or Alys or Gloria Wendy or Guinevere or
  anything but October: the nearest she got to an acceptable nickname was when
  somebody, reasoning along intelligent lines, called her "Huit." In another
  age she would have been a Joan of Arc; lost causes had for her an attraction
  which she could not resist. She was by turns a Parlour Socialist, a Worker of
  the World, an Anarchist, and a Good Christian Woman.</p>

  <p>Cross October in the pursuit of her legitimate rainbows and she was
  terrible; thwart her, and you trebled her resolution; forbid her, and she
  bared her feet for the red-hot shares across which she was prepared to walk
  to her objective.</p>

  <p>Her father died the second year she was at the Flemming School. She spent
  two days trying to be sorry&mdash;trying to remember something that made him
  different and dearer. She confided to the principal, who consoled her with
  conventional references to the source of all comfort, that she had not been
  greatly successful.</p>

  <p>"There is really nothing intrinsically precious about fathers&mdash;or
  mothers either," she said, to the good lady's distress. "You give back people
  all that they give to you. Parents are only precious when they love their
  children&mdash;otherwise they are just Mr. Jones and Mr. Hobson. That is how
  I feel about Daddy. I tried hard to be sorry, but the only tear I've shed is
  when I got maudlin about being an orphan. There's an awful lot of self-pity
  about us orphans."</p>

  <p>Miss Washburton Flemming felt it necessary to straighten a dangerous
  angle.</p>

  <p>"Your father, my dear, worked very hard for you. He gave you a comfortable
  home, he bought you all that you have, and paid your fees&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He'd have been arrested if he hadn't," said October. "I'm terribly sorry,
  Miss Flemming, but I've just got to get this thing right from my own point of
  view. I don't think any other matters to me just now."</p>

  <p>Her father left practically no money&mdash;he never had any to leave; she
  learned this from the big, uncouth Andrew Elmer. Mr. Jones had merely an
  annuity which died with him. Mr. Elmer, whom she remembered dimly, was an
  uncle, the brother-in-law of her mother and sole executor of her mother's
  estate. Incidentally, her guardian by law and soon to be her most unwilling
  host.</p>

  <p>The translation from the intenseness of the Flemming School to the
  modified placidity of Four Beeches Farm had at first the illusion of a
  desirable change; it was as though she had come through the buffets and
  tossings of a whirlpool to calm waters. In twenty-four hours those calm
  waters had the appearance of a stagnant pool on which the green scum was
  already forming. And Mrs. Adelaide Elmer was a shocking substitute for the
  human contacts she had broken.</p>

  <p>October did not rebel; rebellion was her normal state of being. The
  wildness of a tiger is unaffected by a change of cages; the new keeper had
  met with nothing fiercer than the domestic cat, and was outraged because her
  charge showed her teeth when she should have purred. Wise Miss Flemming had
  fixed an imponderable average of behaviour, balancing periodic atheisms
  against rhapsodical pieties, and discovered a standard of spiritual
  excellence which was altogether admirable. Mrs. Elmer lacked the qualities of
  discrimination. She was, in truth, on the side of uncharity, having been
  strictly trained in a school which enjoined obedience to parents, blind faith
  in the Holy Word, and the meek and awe-stricken silence of all children in
  the presence of their elders.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Stevens was called in, his assistance invoked. He came one
  Saturday afternoon, bringing in his large hand three little books of counsel
  and comfort. October was not impressed by him, and in truth his education had
  been of an intensive character and there were certain appalling gaps which
  only social experience or innate goodness of heart could have bridged.</p>

  <p>"He has all the thrones and oil paintings of theology, but there is no
  carpet on his floor and he eats with his fingers," said October
  metaphorically.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elmer, who took this literally, was momentarily paralyzed.</p>

  <p>"A nicer man never lived"&mdash;her voice was a cracked falsetto when she
  was agitated&mdash;"and he uses a knife and fork same as you, October. I
  never heard a wickeder story."</p>

  <p>October did not argue. She never argued unless there was a victory to be
  gained.</p>

  <p>The proposal that she should marry, nervously offered by Elmer, was
  accepted with remarkable patience.</p>

  <p>"Really?" October was interested. "Who have you got?"</p>

  <p>Andrew repressed a desire to expatiate on the coldbloodedness of the
  question.</p>

  <p>"I been talking to Lee Wasser ..." he began.</p>

  <p>The next day Samuel was introduced. He was rather sure of himself and he
  spoke unceasingly on his favourite topic. October listened with downcast
  eyes. When he had gone she asked:</p>

  <p>"Does this young man know anybody besides himself?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer did not understand her.</p>

  <p>Samuel brought flowers and candy and new facts and anecdotes which showed
  him in an heroic light. He had a neat turn of humour and a gift of repartee.
  He told her all about this. His conversation was larded with: "So I says to
  Ed," and "So Al says to me," and he invariably concluded every such narrative
  with the assurance: "I thought they'd die laughin'."</p>

  <p>Once she asked if anybody had ever died in these happy circumstances, and
  he was taken aback.</p>

  <p>"Well ... I mean ... of course they didn't die. What I meant was ... well,
  you know."</p>

  <p>He went home that night with his mind clouded with doubt. Once, when they
  were alone, sitting on the porch on a hot June night, he grew sentimental,
  tried to kiss her. It was his right, as he explained afterward. There was no
  unseemly struggle or resistance, no lips seeking lips and pecking at an ear.
  She held him back with one athletic hand and asked him not to be a fool.</p>

  <p>No date had been fixed for the wedding. The announcement on the part of
  Andrew Elmer that, by a clause in her mother's will, October must be married
  on her twenty-first birthday, came in the nature of a shock to everybody but
  October. When she was told, a week before the date, she merely said "Oh?"</p>

  <p>Sam had a consultation with his father and ordered an expensive suite at a
  hotel romantically situated on the banks of the Oswegatchie.</p>

  <p>Thus matters stood when Mr. Elmer had his interview with Joe Pffiefer, the
  man of law, and found his worst fears fully justified.</p>

  <p>The old gray horse ambled on at his own pace; the buggy rocked from side
  to side as its spider-web wheels met an obstruction, and Mr. Elmer rocked
  with it. His shrewd eye surveyed the street. Old man Wasser was standing
  outside Wasser's Universal Store, running his hairy hand through and again
  through his mat of gray hair. His octagonal glasses had slipped down his
  nose, pugnacity was in the thrust of his long jaw. With his free hand he was
  gesticulating to point his observation. And his audience was Sam, very
  serious. Not the seriousness of one who was at that moment an object of
  admonition, but rather he seemed to have a partnership in seriousness; his
  manner spoke agreement. Every time the waving hand fell to thump an invisible
  tub Sam nodded deeply.</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer sniffed&mdash;he always sniffed rapidly when he was
  perturbed&mdash;and guided the languid gray to the broad sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"I was just saying to Sam that it don't feel like a wedding day for
  nobody. Seems like when you're camping and find out round about supper time
  that it's been Sunday all day. It don't seem like Sunday&mdash;and it don't
  seem like Sam's wedding day."</p>

  <p>Sam shook his head. It only felt like a wedding day to him because he was
  uncomfortable and nervous and rather unhappy.</p>

  <p>"It ought to be&mdash;different," said Mr. Wasser, Senior, glaring up at
  the man in the buggy. "Ought to have a kind of excitement and&mdash;well, it
  ought to be different. I'm not so sure..."</p>

  <p>He shook his head. Sam also shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't see what's the matter with the day&mdash;" began Elmer.</p>

  <p>"It's the feeling. Kind of hunch, here!" Old Wasser struck his chest. "You
  got to be reasonable, Andrew; you got to put yourself in my place. Sam's my
  only boy&mdash;can't afford to spoil his young life. That's the point. And
  October&mdash;her wedding day, and here was she, not 'n hour ago, on this
  very board walk with a cigarette an' everybody looking at her and remarking.
  Old Dr. Vinner and Miss Selby and the city people over at Littleburg House.
  And Sam&mdash;What did she tell you, Sam?"</p>

  <p>Sam emerged from the background and testified.</p>

  <p>"She said one man's like another man&mdash;only this morning. And she
  didn't love me. She said she'd as soon marry a tramp as marry me&mdash;she
  wasn't partic'lar. She said that a girl had to make a start somewhere an'
  maybe I'd do to begin with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer drew a deep whistling breath.</p>

  <p>"Wish she'd seen that bum I was talkin' to, she'd change her mind pretty
  quick," said Sam, encouraged to eloquence. "I told her that wasn't the kind
  of talk I liked to hear from a girl who was wearin' my betrothal ring. She
  took it off and heaved it at me. Said she wasn't going to limit
  the&mdash;what was it?&mdash;limit the expression of her personality for
  fifty dollars' worth of bad taste&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"H-w-w-w!" breathed Andrew Elmer. Mr. Wasser's face was all smiling
  triumph.</p>

  <p>"She said maybe she'd change her mind, she wasn't sure. That's when she
  told me that one man was like another as far as she was concerned."</p>

  <p>"Sam's got the ring in his pocket," confirmed Mr. Wasser.</p>

  <p>"She's young&mdash;" Andrew spoke urgently&mdash;"they get that way, doubt
  their own judgment. It's natural. She's always spoke well about you to me. I
  get plumb tired of hearing her talk of you. It's 'Sam this' and 'Sam that'
  mornin' till night. She's proud and likes to hide her feelings."</p>

  <p>"Wish she'd hide the line she sold me," said Sam, not wholly convinced,
  and yet, since he was a man and young, finding a difficulty in disbelieving
  this story of the secret praises which had been lavished upon him.</p>

  <p>He looked at his father. The smile had left Mr. Wasser's face; he was glum
  and perplexed.</p>

  <p>"And we ought to have had her marriage deed fixed, Andrew. What's the
  hurry, anyway? Give these young people a month or so to think it over."</p>

  <p>He pleaded, but could not insist. Andrew Elmer was in a sense a partner in
  his real estate transactions; he had unsuspected pulls, controlled a certain
  board of management, was in every way the wrong man to antagonize.</p>

  <p>"It don't feel like a wedding, Andrew. No party, nothing. Kind of mean and
  underhand. It will do us no good."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer gathered up the reins; it was the psychological moment.</p>

  <p>"If you and Sam ain't up to Four Beeches round about nine o'clock to-night
  I guess I've got enough sense to know that you've backed out," he said
  sombrely, and laid his whip across the old gray's withers.</p>

  <p>Anyway, he ruminated with satisfaction, he had avoided discussing the very
  delicate matter of October's financial position.</p>

  <p>As he was turning at the fork, a long-bodied touring car came slowly past
  him. He had a glimpse of a thin-faced man at the wheel. An Englishman, he
  guessed by the monocle. The machine had a Canadian number. Strangers are rare
  in Littleburg; he turned his head and looked back after the car, saw it stop
  before the Littleburg House. A few minutes later he saw two men who were also
  strangers. A tall thickset man with a short red beard, and a fat little man
  whose face was broader than it was long, the breadth being emphasized by the
  straight black eyebrows and moustache. They were striding out side by side,
  the little man's head no higher than his companion's shoulder. They favoured
  Mr. Elmer with a quick sidelong stare and marched past with no other
  greeting,</p>

  <p>"Littleburg's goin' ahead," said Mr. Elmer.</p>

  <p>He had large interests in Littleburg real estate and had every reason to
  be pleased at this slender evidence of the town's growing popularity.</p>

  <p>The two men marched on without exchanging a word and turned into
  Littleburg House with the precision of soldiers. A tall thin man in a long
  dust coat was talking to the clerk. He was an Englishman; his accent betrayed
  him. Good-looking, though his face and features were small; sleek-haired, a
  little petulant.</p>

  <p>"... the roads are abominable. Isn't there a post road to Ogdensburg?"</p>

  <p>The two men hardly paused in their stride: they heard this as they passed
  to the stairway. A stocky, sandy-haired man who had been dozing in one of the
  long chairs that abounded in the vestibule opened one eye as they came
  abreast of him, straightened up, relit the stub of his dead cigar, and
  followed them up the stairs. Evidently he knew their habitation, for he
  knocked on Number 7 and a voice barked permission to enter.</p>

  <p>"'Morning, boys." He nodded affably to the two, and such was his perfect
  assurance that there was no need for him to display the silver badge that was
  pinned on the inside of his coat. "Heard you were in town. Stayin' long?"</p>

  <p>Red Beard finished the glass of water he was drinking when the detective
  entered, wiped his moustache daintily with a silk handkerchief, and jerked a
  cigar from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Me and my friend are just stoppin' over to look 'round," he said. "We
  reckon to go on to Philadelphia by the night train. Thasso, Lenny?" He looked
  to his friend for support.</p>

  <p>"Thasso," said Lenny.</p>

  <p>The sandy man lit the cigar.</p>

  <p>"Chief asked me to make a call," he said apologetically. "Thought maybe
  you mightn't know we'd seen you arrive. Pretty poor place&mdash;Littleburg.
  You'd starve here and that's a fact. Ogdensburg's not much better. The police
  have had a clean-up lately and they're mighty sore with folks who think
  they're easy. Chief was on the line to them this morning and they reckoned
  Ogdensburg wouldn't be healthy for you."</p>

  <p>"Philadelphia," said Red Beard, "and we're only stopping off. Utica's our
  home."</p>

  <p>"Fine," said the sandy man, by nature and training a skeptic. "Either of
  you boys got a gun?"</p>

  <p>Red Beard spread out his arms invitingly, and the detective made a quick
  search, first of one and then of the other. No lethal weapon was
  discovered.</p>

  <p>"That's fine," said the sandy man cheerfully. "I'll be seeing you at the
  depot about nine?"</p>

  <p>"Sure thing," said Red Beard as heartily.</p>

  <p>The detective went down through the vestibule and telephoned; the
  Englishman had departed.</p>

  <p>"Some of these guys want the earth," complained the clerk. "'Is Lordship
  wants a new post road."</p>

  <p>"English?"</p>

  <p>"And some," said the clerk.</p>

  <p>An hour later Red Beard and his friend came down to the lounge and were
  silent spectators of a ceremony.</p>

  <p>A number of high-spirited young men of Littleburg had formed a ring about
  an embarrassed young man, and they were chanting a ribald chorus. Red Beard
  gathered from this that the young gentleman in the centre was on the verge of
  matrimony. They were chanting the lay of a local poet and were by now word
  perfect.</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"Old Sam Wasser was a mean old skunk,<br>
  He keeps his hooch where it can't be drunk.<br>
  He marries a girl and he never sends<br>
  A 'come-all-ye' to his faithful friends&mdash;"</p><br>

  <p>"Aw, listen, fellers!"</p><br>

  <p class="verse">"There ain't no cake for the bride to cut,<br>
  No hooch for the health of this poor nut.<br>
  Old Sam Wasser is a mean old dog,<br>

  <p>"Aw, listen, fellers!"</p><br>

  <p>The circle broke into a formless little group from which great noises
  emerged.</p>

  <p>"You are, Sam!" "And so you are ... you old skinflint!" "Aw, listen!"
  "Say, come along to my apartment."</p>

  <p>The crowd billowed unevenly toward the door, Mr. Bennett, the proprietor
  of Littleburg House, rubbing his hands in the background and looking happy
  for the first time since this congregation had irrupted into his hotel.</p>

  <p>Sam Wasser's "apartment" was above the garage of his suffering parent.
  Sam, who was a strangely old boy, gave little parties here at times. There
  were secret closets wherein the Right Stuff was stored, and an odd assortment
  of glasses.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of the afternoon Sam made a suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Lishen, fellers, got an idea. There'sh an ole hobo up in the woods, good
  feller&mdash;man of the world. Le's go right along an' gi'm a drink. Bet he

  <h2><a id="ch3"
     name="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. ELMER made several visits to the bedroom. She had
  endeavoured throughout the day to arouse October to a sense of her
  responsibilities, but unsuccessfully.</p>

  <p>"You'd break the heart of a stone," said Mrs. Elmer bitterly.</p>

  <p>She was a terribly thin woman with a face that was all angles, and her
  manner was normally and permanently acidulated.</p>

  <p>"How can I pack, October? I don't know what you want to take with
  you."</p>

  <p>October put down her book and regarded the thin lady thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Anything. What does a bride wear, anyway?"</p>

  <p>It was the first spark of interest she had shown.</p>

  <p>"Your blue, the satiny one. Mr. Elmer thought that as the wedding was to
  be quiet it was waste of money to buy falderals."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lord!" groaned October. "Who wants falderals? Anything you like, Mrs.
  Elmer. Not too much; I don't want the bother of unpacking."</p>

  <p>"Can't you do anything?" demanded the exasperated woman. "Do you expect me
  to break my back over your trunks?"</p>

  <p>"Don't pack 'em," said October, and returned her mind to the book.</p>

  <p>She had her supper in her room alone. She was reading by the light of a
  kerosene lamp, her head on one hand, when Mrs. Elmer in rustling black came
  twittering in to her.</p>

  <p>"The Reverend Stevens has come," she whispered, as though the information
  were too intimate to be spoken aloud.</p>

  <p>October put down her book, carefully marked the place, and stood up,
  brushing back her hair with a quick gesture.</p>

  <p>"What does he want?" she asked astoundingly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elmer did not swoon.</p>

  <p>"You're goin' to be married, ain't you?" she demanded violently.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that!"</p>

  <p>The long parlour at Four Beeches was at its worst a gaunt and cheerless
  room. All that flowers, garden-grown, could do to its embellishment had been
  done. The flowers gave the room a beauty and a dignity which October had not
  noticed before. Mr. Elmer in his Sunday best and the Reverend Stevens in
  funereal black were solemn figures. So were Johnny Woodgers, the hired man,
  and his wife, and Art Fingle, the clerk from the Farmers' Bank, and Martha
  Dimmock, the widow woman who was accounted Mrs. Elmer's closest and most
  confidential friend. October looked in vain for Sam.</p>

  <p>"You didn't wear the blue after all," whispered Mrs. Elmer. "That dress
  looks too gay&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I feel gay," said October clearly.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Stevens held a whispered conversation with Andrew Elmer, and
  Mr. Elmer went out. It was Mr. Stevens's opportunity. He tiptoed across the
  room. He had the manner of one in the presence of the newly deceased.</p>

  <p>"You are about to embark upon a new life and a new career," he said; "a
  career which calls for the exercise of all the virtues&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is this Sam person?" demanded October. "I'd like to take one really
  good look at him before I decide."</p>

  <p>"He will be here presently."</p>

  <p>Mr. Stevens was annoyed. October had that effect on him. He, too, had need
  to exercise all his Christian virtues when he was brought into contact with
  her. To say that he disliked her intensely is to put the situation
  truthfully. He was looking forward to the day when she would be removed to
  the fold which sheltered Lutheran Wassers.</p>

  <p>"You are about to embark upon a new&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The sound of voices came faintly from the road outside; they must have
  been very loud voices to reach so far. Somebody was laughing stupidly.</p>

  <p>"&mdash;a new career, as I say. There can only be one sure guide even in
  the most paltry affairs&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The voices were so loud now that he stopped. The door was flung open, Mr.
  Elmer came in backward, waving his hands frantically. After him, facing first
  one way and then the other, came Mr. Wasser in a tail coat, very flushed and
  talking at the top of his voice.</p>

  <p>The little crowd that followed exploded into the room. Sam Wasser was very
  noticeable. He had a flag attached to a walking cane and he waved it
  furiously. Hatless and bearing marks of strife, he did not differ in this
  respect from his elated friends.</p>

  <p>"Here he ish! Whoop! Rush that weddin'. Yi-yap! Gerraway!" This to his
  frantic father.</p>

  <p>Then, in a singsong chorus which was lustily sung by his supporters:</p>

  <p>"Callin' your bluff, November Jones, December Jones, callin' your bluff,
  November Jones, September Jones&mdash;wow!"</p>

  <p>Then it was that October saw the tramp. He was pushed forward by friendly
  hands and stood swaying unsteadily on his feet. His eye was glassy, his hair
  a little wild. Somebody had ripped his coat so that only one sleeve
  remained.</p>

  <p>"Sorry," he said thickly.</p>

  <p>Sorry? She looked at him keenly. One word, and it determined her course.
  Until that moment her mind was all fury and contempt.</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer became articulate.</p>

  <p>"What in hell's the meaning of this?" he screeched. "Hey? What's the idea?
  Get out, you bunch of boozers, get out!"</p>

  <p>"Idea?" Sam strode forward truculently. "She'd sooner marry tramp, she
  said. Call her bluff. Tha's what. Here's tramp. Marry him, tha's what!"</p>

  <p>Into the face of October Jones came a look that defied the description of
  those who witnessed the scene.</p>

  <p>"I'll marry him!"</p>

  <p>Robin the tramp stared at her owlishly.</p>

  <p>"He's drunk!" said a voice in the background, and there was a laugh.
  "Wouldn't drink, so we sat on him and poured it down."</p>

  <p>"We poured it down, we poured it down!" roared the chorus, stamping time
  with their feet. "He wouldn't drink so we poured it down! Poured it down
  ..."</p>

  <p>The voices straggled; one dropped out and then another. Sam was left in
  the position of soloist, and presently he stopped.</p>

  <p>October was searching the face of the dazed tramp, eagerly, tensely. The
  thing of rags and tatters shook his head in helpless protest. His gaze
  wandered from the girl to the shaded lamp: it was smoking blackly. The lamp
  interested him. He raised a solemn finger as though in reproof. And then his
  eyes came back to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Fearfully sorry!" he muttered. "Curse that intaglio!"</p>

  <p>It was as though he of all the gaping company had some dim understanding
  of her humiliation. He waggled his head, frowned terribly. She saw the
  struggle between the will of him and the drug that deadened his senses. He
  was trying to throw off the black cloth that blinded him&mdash;and failed. As
  to this strange talk of intaglios. She had no room in her mind for that.</p>

  <p>"I will marry him!"</p>

  <p>Elmer's lip was working terribly fast. Mr. Wasser was weeping weakly.</p>

  <p>"You can't. You marry Sam&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That weakling!"</p>

  <p>Sam sniggered at this, made to stride up to her, tripped over the carpet,
  and floundered on his hands and knees, tried to rise and fell again.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to marry me off to-night&mdash;I'll take the tramp!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elmer wrung her hands.</p>

  <p>"You don't know what you're saying," she squeaked. "You can't do it,
  October!"</p>

  <p>"Can't I?" The girl's eyes were on the Reverend Stevens. "One man is like
  another in the eyes of God, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>She turned to Robin; he was regarding her with wide eyes.</p>

  <p>"Such things cannot be," he said solemnly.</p>

  <p>"What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Robin&mdash;Robin Leslie."</p>

  <p>"Robin Leslie&mdash;that will do."</p>

  <p>She took his grimy hand in hers. She was at that moment a being exalted;
  her eyes were blazing.</p>

  <p>The Reverend Stevens fiddled with his prayer book, looked over his glasses
  at Mr. Elmer. Andrew was biting his nails, one eye on the clock, one on the
  limp figure that sprawled on the floor. Sam had gone to sleep.</p>

  <p>"You do as you like," his voice quavered. "You're mad, October&mdash;plumb
  starin' mad..."</p>

  <p>She still held the hand in hers.</p>

  <p>"My name is October Jones&mdash;his is Robin Leslie&mdash;marry us."</p>

  <p>The Reverend Stevens opened the book and stumbled through the words. From
  the carpet came the drum beat of Sam's snores.</p>

  <p>"Ring?"</p>

  <p>She stooped and searched the waistcoat pocket of the slumbering youth.</p>

  <p>"Here it is."</p>

  <p>So in the sight of God and His congregation she was made Mrs. Robin
  Leslie.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elmer, hand at mouth, watched her like a woman in a trance. Andrew
  talked furiously, but no sound came. As for Robin the tramp&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Sorry!" he said once.</p>

  <p>The crowd at the end of the room gasped as they came toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Where you goin'?" asked Wasser hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"With my husband."</p>

  <p>They disappeared into the black night, and for a long time nobody spoke or
  moved. Then with a scream Mrs. Elmer flew to the door.</p>

  <p>"October! October!"</p>

  <p>There was no answer but the uneasy rustling of the leaves and the deep
  growl of distant thunder.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4"
     name="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

  <p class="first">AS OCTOBER crossed the porch she heard the roll of thunder.
  Hanging over the handrail was the old coat she used as a carpet when the
  shade of the apple trees enticed her out of doors. She gathered it
  mechanically.</p>

  <p>Robin was walking ahead of her. She saw the nearly white sleeve of his
  tattered shirt and, quickening her pace, overtook him.</p>

  <p>"Where's that?" He pointed with waggling finger.</p>

  <p>"That is the road&mdash;it leads to the fork."</p>

  <p>He rubbed his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Another way&mdash;path over fields?"</p>

  <p>She considered.</p>

  <p>"You don't wish to go through the town? It doesn't worry me at all."</p>

  <p>"Worries me. I'm rather tight. The young devils! I wasn't prepared for
  them."</p>

  <p>He stood uncertainly. Ahead were the gate and the road. Behind she heard
  somebody scream her name.</p>

  <p>"This way."</p>

  <p>She caught him by the sleeveless coat and dragged him between the
  elderberry bushes along a track scarcely visible in daylight. He stumbled
  once and apologized. She saw that he really was "tight"&mdash;intoxicated.
  The path brought them to grass and trees and an occasional view between the
  apple trees of a far-away yellow light. Presently they were clear of the
  orchard and traversing a rough stretch of field where Mr. Elmer grazed his
  cows. There was a big barn here, its bulk showing blackly against the sky;
  beyond was rough going, a pool where the cows drank and sheer waste land
  where nothing grazed or grew.</p>

  <p>"Storm somewhere," said Robin. October had seen the lightning. "Following
  the valley of the St. Lawrence."</p>

  <p>She stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"What are you&mdash;what nationality? You're not American?"</p>

  <p>"Bri'sh." Only now and again was his voice slurred.</p>

  <p>She drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"Then I'm&mdash;British!"</p>

  <p>She could not see his face; she had to suppose his dullness from his tone
  and attitude.</p>

  <p>"Are you? Fine."</p>

  <p>Her lips were tight pressed.</p>

  <p>"I'm American&mdash;nothing will ever make me anything but American."</p>

  <p>"Oh." He was trying to think. "You said you were Bri'sh just now&mdash;I
  hate people who can't make up their minds. Where are we going?"</p>

  <p>"Where <i>are</i> we going? Where do you want to go?"</p>

  <p>"Prescott."</p>

  <p>She gasped.</p>

  <p>"In Canada?"</p>

  <p>He nodded; she had to guess this.</p>

  <p>"Where does this bring us&mdash;right here, I mean?"</p>

  <p>She told him there was a road ahead of them. It joined the main road west
  of Littleburg.</p>

  <p>"Is there a little wood road goes through it?" he asked eagerly. And,
  surprised, she said that there was. They had reached the snake fence which
  marked the boundary of Four Beeches Farm when he hissed:</p>

  <p>"Don't speak&mdash;kneel!"</p>

  <p>She obeyed and heard somebody talking, and after a while saw the flare of
  a match.</p>

  <p>"Flat down in this dip!" He set her an example and sprawled face downward
  on the moist grass. She fell beside him, her heart racing.</p>

  <p>There was no cause for that wild excitement, she told herself, and yet she
  knew that there was an enormous, a vital reason. There was danger; a vague
  sense of peril lifted the hairs of her neck. She found herself glaring toward
  the road and hating the men who were walking in so leisurely a fashion toward
  them. Nearer and nearer. One stopped to strike another match. They were less
  than six yards from where the two were lying. She glimpsed a fat, broad face
  and had a flash of a red beard.</p>

  <p>"You certainly put your name in lights, Lenny!" said Red Beard
  disparagingly. "We Ought to have come out with a band."</p>

  <p>"Huh!" grunted the other. "What's that matter? He's not here, not'n
  miles."</p>

  <p>"I saw him, I tell you. With a bunch of kids, all loaded. If you'd been
  around I'd have got him."</p>

  <p>"Had to go up to the depot... that fly cop ..."</p>

  <p>The voices grew indistinct; they became a murmur. Came a growl and rumble
  of thunder, and when it died away there was silence.</p>

  <p>"Are they looking for you?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>His voice was steady; he seemed suddenly sobered. As he rose, the western
  skies throbbed palely with lightning, and she saw the glint of something in
  his hand. Sober his head might be to meet what trouble was present, but he
  staggered as he walked.</p>

  <p>"Don't stub your toe against the fence," he whispered. "Wood sounds carry.
  Is there a gate?"</p>

  <p>"Farther along."</p>

  <p>"Down!"</p>

  <p>He had seen the faint speck of a cigar end; the men were coming back. This
  time the hiding pair had an advantage. A small ridge of earth ran parallel
  with the fence; behind this they were safely screened.</p>

  <p>The two strollers stopped opposite to them. Apparently one seated himself
  on the fence; they listened, heard the scrape of his shoes on the rail.</p>

  <p>"... back in the wood on the other side of the town, I bet. Ought to have
  combed that wood, Lenny. If I hadn't been a bonehead I'd 'a' got him at
  Schenectady."</p>

  <p>A silence.</p>

  <p>"He got that gun," said another voice.</p>

  <p>"Like hell he did! That's newspaper lyin'. Fellers don't smash a bank to
  get a gun. Well, maybe it wasn't a bank but I reckon the bookkeeper's office
  at a plant is as good as a bank."</p>

  <p>"Newspaper said&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Newspaper!" He added an appeal to his Deity.</p>

  <p>Another long silence. The scent of a good cigar was wafted toward and over
  the hillock.</p>

  <p>"Say, what's Gussie got on him?"</p>

  <p>Red Beard (she could identify the two voices now) laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Lenny, suppose we get this bird&mdash;what'll we have on Gussie?
  Oh, nothin'! Come on."</p>

  <p>The sound of their footsteps receded. Raising his head, Robin took an
  observation.</p>

  <p>"Gussie!" he murmured, "That's jolly good!"</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed before he got up and helped her to rise.</p>

  <p>"Where is the gate?"</p>

  <p>She walked a little ahead of him. He must have seen that the coat she
  carried was trailing; he took it from her without a word.</p>

  <p>The gate was found; it was half open. They went through the road, which
  was uneven but infinitely easier to walk upon than the field. The grass had
  been heavy with dew&mdash;she felt the front of her dress was soaked.</p>

  <p>"There's a house up in these woods&mdash;haunted. Not afraid?"</p>

  <p>"The Swede's house," she said, remembering.</p>

  <p>"That's it. Hanged himself, didn't he? Hobos never go there&mdash;rather
  sleep in the rain. They think it is unlucky. Terribly superstitious people,
  tramps. Am I walking too fast?"</p>

  <p>"No." A hundred yards farther on: "You're not drunk now."</p>

  <p>He turned his head sideways to her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am, horribly! I keep thinking you're someone else. And my legs are
  all crazy. I didn't sleep last night. I jumped a ride on a freight train
  night before that, but one of the train hands found me and booted me off. I
  could sleep standing to-night. But I'm drunk all right."</p>

  <p>The road began to ascend. She had so often walked this way that she could
  have gone forward blindfolded. Larches appeared on either hand and the road
  became a track. Now they were in a great darkness; the far-off lightning was
  helpful, the sky reflection came down to them through the tree tops.</p>

  <p>"It is to the left somewhere; there are two steps up the bank."</p>

  <p>They walked more slowly now, searching for the path to the Swede's house.
  A flicker of light in the sky, and they saw the steps&mdash;two roughhewn
  slabs of sandstone, worn by the feet of the suicide.</p>

  <p>At the head of the steps he stopped, swaying from side to side. She
  thought the climb had made him dizzy, but when she put out her hand to steady
  him he disengaged himself gently. Then she too saw the red gleam of a fire.
  It was somewhere beyond the spot where they had turned from the track.</p>

  <p>"Shtay here," he said huskily, and went down the steps.</p>

  <p>Moving stealthily forward, the man stalked the fire foot by foot. No sound
  came back to the waiting girl. Nearer and nearer he went, slipping from tree
  to tree until he reached a place where he could see the campers.</p>

  <p>There were two: one immensely tall and one who seemed by comparison a
  dwarf, and though later he proved to be scarcely shorter than the average
  man, Robin thought of him and spoke of him as "the little man."</p>

  <p>Tramps both, grimy of face, their raiment was such that the sack about the
  big fellow's shoulders seemed surprisingly smart. He had a low receding
  forehead, a gross button of a nose, and a huge hairy chin; eyes as small, as
  dark, and as close set as a monkey's. His companion was a very old man. His
  rags were indescribably foul, his face had not known soap and water in weeks.
  White-bearded, bald, he sat, staring into the fire.</p>

  <p>"Come right along, bo," growled the big man.</p>

  <p>He had seen the stalker, though apparently he had not lifted his eyes from
  the bread he was carving.</p>

  <p>Tramp Robin lurched forward. His head was surprisingly clear, though
  nausea almost overcame him.</p>

  <p>"Howdy," growled the big man. "Set you down. Did that yard dick chase you?
  The&mdash;! He ditched me, but this old plug flew the coop."</p>

  <p>Robin gathered they had been thrown off a train by a railroad
  detective.</p>

  <p>"An' a slow freight!" He invoked his God.</p>

  <p>"Goin' up to Ogdens?" the little old man asked eagerly. "We're glommin'
  the Limited to-night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ain't no Limited, you old fool [he did not say "fool"], I'm tellin' yer.
  How's this town for handouts, Joe? Listen, this dam' road's worse than
  hell."</p>

  <p>"I haven't tried it yet."</p>

  <p>The big man opened his eyes. The accent, if not new, was strange.</p>

  <p>"British! That's funny." And then, looking closely at the stranger: "Ye're
  stewed! Hi, Baldy, this bird's stewed!"</p>

  <p>A new interest came to the little eyes.</p>

  <p>"Set down, Joe&mdash;guess you're the gay cat!"</p>

  <p>"Pardon me"&mdash;the little old man's voice took on a sudden
  refinement&mdash;"you are acquainted with Ogdensburg? You will be interested
  to learn that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up!"</p>

  <p>The big tramp's lips curled up in a snarl, his hand swung back, and the
  little man shrank to the earth, a grimace of terror on his grotesque
  face.</p>

  <p>"Always seein' spooks; got himself nearly pinched by a station bull at
  Troy&mdash;Troy, can you beat it! Him yowlin' round the railway yards about
  app'ritions! Ju-liah!"</p>

  <p>Baldy was shivering like a wet dog, but at that word some courage returned
  to him.</p>

  <p>"Not that word, O! Listen. She treated me badly&mdash;she was mean. O, but
  I'd rather you didn't!"</p>

  <p>"Ju-liah!" roared the big man mockingly.</p>

  <p>His great hand shot out, gripped the little face of his companion, and
  shook it savagely. Robin looked, said nothing till the brute threw the old
  man from him and grinned up at the eyewitness.</p>

  <p>"Set you down. What's hurtin' you, Joe? G'wan, set down. You comin' along?
  There's good batterin' in Ogdens. Say, I knew 'n Englishman&mdash;set down!"
  The last two words were shouted.</p>

  <p>"Standing up," said Robin calmly. "<i>And</i> walking!"</p>

  <p>"'Fraid I'll roll you? Gawd a'mighty, you ain't got three cents!"</p>

  <p>"Maybe not; still, I'm walking."</p>

  <p>He turned and walked away. Out of the corner of his eyes he saw the man
  reach for a stone, and spun round.</p>

  <p>"I'm packing a gat," he said significantly.</p>

  <p>He saw that the man believed him, for he forced a laugh.</p>

  <p>"You'd get life for that," he said sarcastically. "<i>An</i>' a sappin'!
  It's a fool thing to carry&mdash;a gun."</p>

  <p>He got up and trod on the fire, collected the remains of the feast, and
  rolled them up into an old newspaper.</p>

  <p>"Come on, Baldy&mdash;this gay cat reckons I'm goin' to roll him! You
  catchin' that freight?"</p>

  <p>Robin shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Never thought you was. Bet you've never decked a car in your life.
  Come on&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>Baldy got up slowly, collected his own belongings, and slouched in the
  trail of his master. Soon they were out of sight, and Robin, stamping the
  last red ember to death, went back to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Who were they?" she asked. She had seen them pass..</p>

  <p>"Some fellers&mdash;tramps. Where's this house?"</p>

  <p>She pointed&mdash;at least he thought she was pointing. The storm was
  coming nearer; the heaven lit up in a quivering succession of flashes. He saw
  a low-roofed shack, a blind that hung by one hinge, a pitiful little portico
  drooping on one pillar.</p>

  <p>"Home!" said Robin magnificently.</p>

  <p>The door was fast, but a window gave him entrance. After a while she heard
  his footfall in the passage and the squeaking of a latch. It took a
  perceptible time to open the door, and then it only yielded far enough to
  admit her.</p>

  <p>"Hinges gone," he said briefly.</p>

  <p>He pushed the door tight and then, striking a match, lit a piece of candle
  which he took from a pocket on the inside of his coat. The passage was inches
  deep in debris. Dead leaves had found their way here, and scraps of
  discoloured rags showed under the accumulations of dust. Across the passage
  ran a beam of unpainted pine, and screwed into the wood was a large hook. She
  saw this. The forgotten Swede, whose sole memorial this tumbledown house was,
  had hanged himself.</p>

  <p>"Ugh!"</p>

  <p>He looked at her gravely.</p>

  <p>"Not scared?" His eyes went up to the hook. "That wasn't it. Used to hang
  hams there. He did it in a wood&mdash;on a tree somewhere. So they say. Lost
  his wife and went mad&mdash;before you were born. So they say."</p>

  <p>"So who say?" a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>He jerked his head vaguely toward Littleburg; in reality he was indicating
  a scattered community.</p>

  <p>"Tramps swap these yarns. I didn't understand them all&mdash;they have a
  language of their own. Hold the light, will you, please?"</p>

  <p>October took the candle from his hand and he lurched into a room that
  opened from the passage. He returned very soon, carrying a dusty and ragged
  blanket.</p>

  <p>"There's an iron bed&mdash;the spring mattress feels good to me. Rusty, I
  think, but springy. We'd better chance a light."</p>

  <p>The bed was a very dismal-looking affair, but, as he said, the spring
  bottom was intact. He shook out the blanket and folded it pillow fashion.</p>

  <p>"Warmish," he said sleepily, "but you'd better pull your coat over
  you."</p>

  <p>She sat on the bed. Looked at him. He might have been good-looking once.
  The bristly face, the bruised eye, the puffy redness on one cheek... October
  shook her head.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter with your face?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He was surprised by the question.</p>

  <p>"Generally or particularly?" he asked, and touched his cheek. "This?
  Poison ivy. Those old Inquisitors missed something. Go to sleep."</p>

  <p>She kicked off her shoes and lay down, pulling her coat over her. The
  mattress was largely soft, but it was made up of little steel links and her
  dress was thin. She would be like a tattooed lady in the morning. He had
  seated himself in a corner of the room and blown out the candle. Presently
  she heard his deep breathing; once he snored.</p>

  <p>Through the unshaded window she could see the sky lit red and blue at
  irregular intervals. The house shook and shivered with every crash of
  thunder. And then the rain came down. It rattled and drummed on the iron
  roof, beat against the broken windowpane.</p>

  <p>"Seep, peep, peep!"</p>

  <p>The roof was leaking somewhere; the drip and drop of water sounded close
  at hand. Between thunder rolls she heard the breathing of Robin. She was
  dozing when he spoke in his sleep.</p>

  <p>"Silly fool," he muttered, "silly fool!"</p>

  <p>Whether he was talking of himself, or of somebody who belonged to the life
  that was veiled, or of her, she could only speculate upon.</p>

  <p>She fell into a dreamless sleep. She woke slowly with the consciousness
  that somebody was holding her hand; a bristly cheek was near to hers. She
  opened her lips to scream and a firm hand closed her mouth.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5"
     name="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

  <p class="first">THE wedding party had melted down to four. The Reverend
  Stevens had gone on the tail of guests&mdash;wanted and unwanted. His
  responsibility had been a heavy one, he both felt and said. And
  yet&mdash;might he not to-morrow find himself a Controversial Subject, with
  legions for him as well as sour battalions against? Might he not anticipate
  pictures of himself across two or even three columns, with captions
  beneath?</p>

  <p>He had been human before he had become evangelical; it was difficult to be
  wholly inhuman. Brethren of his cloth, who cared less for captions and
  controversy, would arise in their wrath and denounce him. Mothers of
  marriageable daughters, fearing the imitative qualities of youth, would
  condemn him unreservedly. The broad-minded, who invariably champion the less
  decent protagonist of all controversies, would say that there was something
  to be said for him.</p>

  <p>He stole away, shaking his head. When the reporters came to him in the
  morning he would have twelve photographs of himself spread on the parlour
  table for their inspection. He preferred the one taken at Potsdam in the
  early days of his ministry. It was in profile, and he had rather a striking
  profile. He thought about October as he hurried homeward, but imagination was
  not his strong point. She had committed a folly in her petulance; she would
  probably have run away from her tramp husband before now. He honestly
  expected to learn in the morning that she had returned to Four Beeches Farm,
  was there already, he supposed, as he disrobed for the night.</p>

  <p>Andy Elmer sat rigidly by the table that served as an altar. Mrs. Elmer
  was weeping, more in anger than in sorrow, in her rocker. Mr. Lee Wasser sat
  on the sofa, his arm about a dazed and sickly Sam.</p>

  <p>"Nobody can blame me," said Mr. Elmer disjointedly. "The crazy little cat!
  High school an' college ideas..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Wasser glared at him malignantly.</p>

  <p>"Look fine in the newspapers, hey? My boy thrown over for a dirty old
  hobo, hey?"</p>

  <p>He had said this so often in the last ten minutes that Andrew Elmer
  scarcely heard him.</p>

  <p>"She's got no clothes&mdash;nothin'!" wailed Mrs. Elmer. "Not even the
  blue. What folks'll say..."</p>

  <p>Andy's upper lip went up and down furiously.</p>

  <p>"She done it for spite&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>The hired man appeared in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"There's a feller wants to see you, Mr. Elmer. English, I guess. Didn't
  understand half he was say-in'."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer blinked at him. The Grand Cham of China could not have made a
  more inopportune appearance at that hour and in those circumstances than an
  unintelligible Englishman. He glanced at his wife. Mrs. Elmer dabbed her eyes
  and made an awkward exit. Sam was not in a state that permitted any kind of
  exit. There was a challenge in Lee Wasser's eye; he, at any rate, had nothing
  to be ashamed of. Already Sam was a Victim of Dire Machinations.</p>

  <p>He had been drugged by this infamous man with the black eye and the
  swollen face, or hypnotized, or treated with something that had no fumes of
  whisky in it. And, thus incapacitated, had been bereft of his wife. Sam
  drooped more limply; uttered discordant sounds. Mr. Elmer was alarmed.</p>

  <p>"Can't you get him into the kitchen, Lee?" he almost pleaded. "Mrs.
  Elmer's awful particular&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He's singing." Mr. Wasser's tone was ferocious. "There's a whole lot back
  of this business. If it costs me a thousand dollars I'm going to get right
  down to the bottom of it!"</p>

  <p>The hired man ran his fingers between the hateful stiff collar of ceremony
  and his scrawny neck, a gesture of impatience. There was a little group of
  excited people on the back porch all talking at once. He had his own view to
  expose and felt that he was missing something.</p>

  <p>"Say, Mr. Elmer, he said he wanted to see you."</p>

  <p>Behind him there appeared a tall figure in a long dust coat. He wore an
  eyeglass and bright brown gauntlets. Mr. Elmer saw that over enamelled shoes
  were fawn-coloured spats.</p>

  <p>"Sorry to bother you&mdash;er&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was a good-looking fellow with a waxlike complexion, a small brown
  silky moustache, and a permanent smile. At least, it seemed permanent. His
  voice was soft and rather musical.</p>

  <p>"I heard a rumpus outside but couldn't make head or tail of what
  these&mdash;er&mdash;people were saying. Something about a tramp. I hope you
  will forgive me&mdash;er&mdash;butting in."</p>

  <p>He said "butting in" a little self-consciously, as an Englishman speaks a
  foreign language. He had (his manner said) no right to flounder in strange
  colloquialisms, but desired to make himself understood.</p>

  <p>"Uh huh. That's right. There was a tramp up here boozed. That's so."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer was called upon without notice to put into words his version of
  the happening. And it must be put into words sooner or later. In two or three
  days he would be facing a Farmers' Convention&mdash;he shuddered at the
  thought.</p>

  <p>"Well, say ..."</p>

  <p>The presence of Mr. Lee Wasser and the condition of the heir to the Wasser
  fortune largely determined the colour and shape of his narrative. That the
  monocled Englishman was a curious intruder, to be asked what'n thunder the
  affair had to do with him, did not occur to Mr. Elmer. The stranger was The
  World; he represented in his person millions of people sitting at breakfast
  reading their morning newspapers and saying: "That's a queer affair over in
  Littleburg&mdash;tramp married a college girl."</p>

  <p>Moreover, he was the forerunner of an army of reporters and
  photographers.</p>

  <p>"My niece, well, her mother was a sort of sister-in-law ... this young
  lady ... October Jones was her name.... She got some mighty queer notions
  about&mdash;everything."</p>

  <p>"Extraordinary!" murmured the stranger. It was merely a polite or a
  sardonic interjection, but it gave Mr. Elmer a guiding line.</p>

  <p>"Extr'ordin'ry. You've said it! Well, this young lady was gettin' married.
  Everything fixed. Reverend Stevens&mdash;well, everything!" A wave of his
  hand indicated certain festive preparations; the Englishman in the dust coat
  examined the flowers earnestly.</p>

  <p>"And then, this tramp sort of&mdash;well, he came. Right there where
  you're standing."</p>

  <p>"An' Sam was doped. No doubt about that." Mr. Wasser entered the
  conversation loudly. "This bum fixed him that way. Maybe gave him somep'n' to
  smell. He's unconscious now."</p>

  <p>Andrew nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's about it," he said, "and October was <i>crazy</i>. She said 'I'll
  marry him.' I just couldn't speak. I was standin' here, or maybe
  there"&mdash;he indicated the alternative spots with meticulous exactness. "I
  just couldn't so much as holler."</p>

  <p>"Doped," murmured Mr. Wasser helpfully.</p>

  <p>Andrew considered this explanation and regretfully decided upon its
  rejection.</p>

  <p>"Paralyzed," he substituted. "Couldn't believe I was awake."</p>

  <p>The stranger was staring at him. He was as near to being without a smile
  as ever Mr. Elmer saw him.</p>

  <p>"Married?" he said sharply. "Who was married?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer groaned at the man's stupidity.</p>

  <p>"October&mdash;her crazy idea ... she took the ring out of poor Sam's
  pocket. Just bent down an' took the ring. 'Here it is,' she says. 'What's
  your name?' An' this hobo says&mdash;what did he say, Lee?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Wasser had forgotten. His angry gesture told the Englishman how very
  unimportant was the question of a tramp's name.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand. This girl&mdash;October, is that her
  name-?&mdash;wanted to marry a tramp?"</p>

  <p>"He was drunk," said Mr. Wasser, in a tone that suggested a reason for
  October's strange behaviour.</p>

  <p>"She wanted&mdash;and she did," said Mr. Elmer.</p>

  <p>The stranger's mouth opened; his eyeglass dropped.</p>

  <p>"Married! Not really married?"</p>

  <p>Messieurs Elmer and Wasser nodded. Sam's nod was involuntary.</p>

  <p>"Good God!"</p>

  <p>The heart of Andrew Elmer sank. If this simple statement produced such an
  effect upon a stranger, and obviously an unemotional stranger, what would
  follow the general publication of the news?</p>

  <p>"I want to say right here that October is peculiar. She's crazy, that's
  all. She'd jump into a well, yes, sir. She said so I 'You touch me,' she
  says, 'an' I'll jump right in.' Yes, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To-night? Did she jump into the well?"</p>

  <p>There was unmistakable hope in the stranger's voice.</p>

  <p>"No, sir: I'm talkin' about last fall&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"She married this tramp&mdash;actually married him?" And when they nodded
  gravely: "My God!" Then, before Mr. Elmer could speak: "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"October&mdash;" began Mr. Elmer.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about October." He was smiling, but wickedly. "I suppose she
  is here. Where did the tramp go?"</p>

  <p>Lee Wasser pointed dramatically to the door.</p>

  <p>"They went out&mdash;there! Both of 'um."</p>

  <p>The man in the dust coat turned his head.</p>

  <p>"Both of 'um!" he repeated absently and with sudden animation. "How long
  since? Which way did they go?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer lugged out his big watch.</p>

  <p>"About half an hour ago," he said.</p>

  <p>The watch had no value at all to indicate the passage of time. This event
  belonged to eternity; the dial should have been divided into aeons.</p>

  <p>"About half an hour&mdash;they went out there."</p>

  <p>The door, then, was a starting point, the black night a destination. The
  stranger walked from the house. At the gate four men were talking.</p>

  <p>"Say, listen, this bird was loaded. Didn't know what he was doin'. Sam an'
  Ed got him up in the wood an' Pete back-heeled him and got him on the floor.
  'You son of a gun,' says Ed, 'you gotta drink.'"</p>

  <p>Dust Coat went past them and they stopped discussing the great happening
  to speculate upon his identity.</p>

  <p>"English. He's got a big machine. Joe Prideaux at the garage reckons it's
  worth ten thousand dollars an' more."</p>

  <p>The machine was waiting a little way along the road and Mr. Alan Loamer
  leaped into the driver's seat and drove at an increasing speed toward
  Littleburg. He came through the town more cautiously because he could not
  afford to be held up by the unimaginative police. Clear of the power plant,
  he let the big car roar and switched on his powerful headlamps. He was
  watching the road carefully. Presently he saw somebody jump a fence from the
  road and brought his machine to a stop.</p>

  <p>"Byrne!" he called.</p>

  <p>A shape came but of the gloom and then another.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen him?"</p>

  <p>"No. Lenny and me's been hanging around here. He's got to come this way
  unless he works back. Lenny reckoned he might be in the woods the other side
  of town."</p>

  <p>The man at the wheel said something under his breath that Red Beard could
  not hear.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to locate you," he said. "Stay here: I'll go back and make
  inquiries. He has a girl with him."</p>

  <p>"You don't say!" Red Beard was frankly astonished.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;that may make things difficult for you." Mr. Loamer was
  fretful. His audience did not know that inside him and behind his calmness
  was a boiling, bubbling rage. "Is there a side road here? I want to turn my
  car." He pronounced the word strangely.</p>

  <p>"Wants to turn his 'caw,' does he?" said Red Beard, watching the
  manoeuvres of the big machine from a distance. "Gussie's rattled all right,
  Lenny."</p>

  <p>"What's the idea&mdash;this girl? Never heard anything about her,"
  demanded the fat man.</p>

  <p>The machine had turned by now and was flying back; it boomed- past them on
  its way to Littleburg.</p>

  <p>"You heard him; did he tell me anything? A girl. First I've heard of a
  girl. That bird's nutty. I keep tellin' you, Lenny."</p>

  <p>Mr. Loamer came back to Littleburg to find it alive. He saw groups at odd
  corners, and once he passed two men carrying shotguns and addressing each
  other noisily. On the corner of Main and Union streets he saw a
  policeman.</p>

  <p>The policeman knew nothing except that there had been some sort of trouble
  up at Mr. Elmer's farm. The chief was dealing with the consequence, whatever
  it was. He asked Mr. Loamer if he had seen two men, one with a red beard and
  one rather fat and short. Mr. Loamer said that he had not.</p>

  <p>"They're not in town, I guess," said the policeman, and expressed the view
  that the storm would just miss Littleburg.</p>

  <p>It was an hour after midnight when the watcher on the road saw the
  unmistakable headlamps of the big car and woke his companion, who was
  sleeping with his back against the rail of the fence.</p>

  <p>"There is a search party looking for these people," said Mr. Loamer. "They
  are going through the woods on the far side of the town, but somebody
  suggested that he would make for the Swede's house. They say it is haunted.
  Where is it?"</p>

  <p>"Swede's house&mdash;know that, Lenny?"</p>

  <p>The sleepy-eyed Lenny thought that he had heard of such a place, but he
  had never seen it. Evidently he had a nodding acquaintance with the
  district.</p>

  <p>"It's somewhere on the high ground back of Elmer's place," he said. "Never
  been there, but the woods are not big."</p>

  <p>He indicated the route they would follow. Mr. Loamer said he would return
  to the town for the latest news and would join them.</p>

  <p>"This time&mdash;get him!" he said emphatically. "The girl?" He smoothed
  his moustache with his gloved hand. "I don't know what to do about her." He
  was silent for a very long time. Evidently the girl was the subject of his
  cogitation, for when he spoke he said: "She doesn't matter, really."</p>

  <p>As he stepped into the driver's seat he remarked casually:</p>

  <p>"A policeman asked me if I had seen you fellows, and of course I told him
  that I hadn't."</p>

  <p>"That was certainly kind of you." Red beard was good-humouredly
  sarcastic.</p>

  <p>When the car was out of sight he clapped his companion on the
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Let's go," he said. "That old Swede's house is haunted, eh? Maybe we can
  deal it a new spook."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6"
     name="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

  <p class="first">OCTOBER was very wide awake now. She did not struggle, but
  gripped at the hand which covered her mouth, conserving all her strength to
  pry loose this suffocating pad of muscle and bone.</p>

  <p>"Don't make a sound!" he was breathing. "Terribly scared you'd shout...
  somebody prowling outside the house."</p>

  <p>She nodded. The hand was drawn away, the bristly face was removed.</p>

  <p>"Sorry!" he whispered. "Can you get off the bed without raising a riot?
  Wait!"</p>

  <p>His two hands went under her; she felt herself raised slowly.</p>

  <p>"Creak&mdash;squeak!" went the rusty springs as they relaxed. He canted
  her gently, feet to floor, so that she stood with her back to the wall in
  which the window was set.</p>

  <p>"Don't move!"</p>

  <p>The storm had passed; she thought she detected the ghostly light of dawn
  in the room. Silence and then, outside, the cracking of a twig.</p>

  <p>Robin the tramp crouched under the window. She could only see a splodge of
  something a little blacker than the blackness of the room.</p>

  <p>The window darkened; hands were fumbling with the latch. She heard the low
  murmur of a querulous voice. Suddenly a brilliant circle of light appeared on
  the opposite wall: the man outside was searching the room with an electric
  lamp. The circle moved left and right, up and down; focussed on the end of
  the rusty bed and paused there undecidedly. She saw Robin clearly now,
  huddled under the window; he was gripping a steel rod that, attached to the
  window, had once regulated its opening. She had wondered why the man outside
  had failed to find a way in. The light went.</p>

  <p>"Get to the door, along the passage to the right. Take your shoes but
  don't put them on!"</p>

  <p>She nodded agreement to the sibilant instructions, gathered her shoes, and
  tiptoed along the passage until a door barred further progress. Here she
  waited. Presently she heard him coming toward her.</p>

  <p>"Is it open?" he whispered, and went past her.</p>

  <p>The passage was so narrow that she felt the brush of his shirt sleeve on
  her face. The door was unlocked but noisy. The enemy was at the front door by
  now, rattling the handle. Robin the tramp waited until the sound came again
  and then, putting his shoulder to the obstruction, pushed. With a grind and a
  jar it opened. Reaching back, he caught her by the arm and pulled her
  through. They were in a kitchen which smelled of earth and damp. A second
  door was here. He felt for it, groping along wet walls. Overhead the roof had
  partly vanished.</p>

  <p>A thudding sound shook the little house. Another. Robin tugged at the door
  and it opened with a groan; the scent of wet leaves and balsam came to
  October's grateful nostrils.</p>

  <p>"Got your coat?" His lips were close to her ear. She did not mind the
  bristly cheek now. "Good! Follow me&mdash;you'll get your feet wet but that
  won't kill you. Hold my sleeve. When I stoop, do the same."</p>

  <p>He stepped out into the tangle of what had once been a garden. Noiselessly
  he moved toward the encircling wood, she creeping behind him. Her stockings
  were soaked; once she trod on a thorn and needed all her self-control to
  repress a cry. As it was she made some sort of sound, for he half turned.
  They were circling toward the town road; if it had been light they could not
  have seen the Swede's shack when he stopped.</p>

  <p>"Put on your shoes&mdash;I expect your feet are wet."</p>

  <p>She held onto his arm with one hand and pulled on her shoes one by one
  with the other. Her feet were sodden, and the soles of her silk stockings in
  rags. But she was glad to have leather between foot and earth.</p>

  <p>"No hurry. They will take some time exploring the hut," he said, still
  whispering. "And the trees will spoil Lenny's style&mdash;he likes the great
  open spaces where men are men!"</p>

  <p>Something amused him; she heard him laughing in staccato gasps. He was
  moving more swiftly, and the distance between them and the shack must have
  been considerable when they struck a path that ran downhill, the trees began
  to thin, and then he caught tight hold of her arm and stopped.</p>

  <p>She saw the figure, too.</p>

  <p>It was smoking a cigarette. There was just enough light in the sky to
  reveal an indistinct outline&mdash;a man, and he was sitting on a fallen tree
  to their left front.</p>

  <p>Behind them somebody shouted; it sounded faint and comfortably far. The
  man on the tree trunk got up and strolled slowly up the path, but
  unexpectedly deviated to his right. He passed the watching pair not a dozen
  yards away; evidently he had missed the path.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he called.</p>

  <p>"They've been here, but they've gone." Still faintly.</p>

  <p>It was Red Beard's voice; she recognized its deep raucousness.</p>

  <p>The smoker passed out of sight. Still stooping, Robin went on, stopped
  again and pointed.</p>

  <p>In the fold of the little hill she saw three gleaming lights, two white,
  one red.</p>

  <p>"A car," he breathed.</p>

  <p>By the position of the lights she saw that the bonnet of the machine was
  turned toward Littleburg.</p>

  <p>Stealthily he crept toward the lights and, holding fast to his sleeve, she
  followed. One swift look round.</p>

  <p>"Jump in!" he said, and she scrambled aboard.</p>

  <p>She did not realize that the engines were running until he was by her
  side. He gripped the clutch lever and looked back again. They were moving
  with little or no sound. The springs of the machine took the strain of the
  uneven surface; nearer and nearer to the white road they stole. Then she
  heard a shout behind, but looking round, could see nothing against the dark
  background of hill and wood.</p>

  <p>The car was going faster. Something buzzed past her cheek; she thought it
  was a nocturnal beetle and instinctively put up her hand to brush her
  face.</p>

  <p>Robin the tramp slowed to take the turn; and now Littleburg was behind
  them and the car was flying toward Ogdensburg. She sat huddled in a corner of
  the seat, watching and yet not watching the country fly past. Barn and
  farmhouse, rail crossing, stretch of rolling country, now a steep hill,
  tree-furred, now a dead town with an ugly iron church and none to watch their
  passage but a cat.</p>

  <p>Once they passed a lake and saw at the end of it a miniature Niagara. It
  was growing lighter. They passed a farm wagon.</p>

  <p>Robin came to a fork and branched right, though it was clear that this was
  the poorer road. And so it proved. They bumped and swayed up a steep and
  slippery grade. The road became unrelieved rock, and when they had got beyond
  a great scar in the hillside, from which at some period stone had been
  quarried, the road ceased to be. Nevertheless, they continued, dodging
  between trees, avoiding, miraculously, a confusion of boulders that seemed to
  have been dropped for the special purpose of checking their adventure. Coming
  over a razor-back ridge, he jammed on the brakes, and only in time, for from
  the crest the ground dropped steeply to the well-defined edge of a chasm.</p>

  <p>"That's that," said the tramp, and hoisted himself from his seat.</p>

  <p>Before she could descend he had put his hands about her waist and lifted
  her free of the machine. He walked to the top of the slope and looked back.
  The car tracks were visible on the grass if the search came so far. But
  beyond was the stone causeway (as he called it) and the lower slopes of the
  road had marks of trolley wheels in which his own might merge.</p>

  <p>He strolled to the car, pulled from the back seat a folded rug, and then
  "whooped" softly. There were a basket here and a hold-all. He lugged them
  out, one after the other. Opening the lid, he looked in and grinned
  demoniacally (as October thought); then he unrolled the canvas carry-all.</p>

  <p>"Here is a towel and soap&mdash;I can hear water up there," he jerked his
  head to the higher slopes. '"Ware wire!"</p>

  <p>She looked inquiringly at him.</p>

  <p>"Ware?"</p>

  <p>"Watch your step," he translated.</p>

  <p>She found the water; it was beautifully cold. When she came back to him
  with a light step, as rosy as the dawn that had broken, he took towel and
  soap from her and went up the hill. There was a ludicrous plaid patch on the
  back of his pants that seemed in keeping. She had seen the genus on the
  stage. October watched him, chin in hand, until he disappeared behind the
  tangle of whortleberry and laurel that hid the spring.</p>

  <p>Robin Leslie&mdash;Mrs. Robin Leslie. And the situation did not seem
  unreal. She was part of his life. Red Beard was her deadly foe. She had
  thrilled and grown tense at a common danger. October never analyzed her own
  emotions. She could pick to threads motives and causes, could reduce to
  formulae human eccentricities, but she never felt the urge to disintegrate
  her own soul that she might furnish sections for a microscope, or tested with
  the acid of other people's experience her own reactions. The man attached to
  the plaid patch was a fact&mdash;Mr. Robin Leslie. He could differ only from
  any other man in respect to his behaviour. So far he was entirely
  satisfactory. He had given her the spring bed (she <i>was</i> a tattooed
  lady, she had discovered after a limited investigation); he had told her to
  put on her shoes at exactly the right moment. She in his place would have
  done the same. He drove a car rather efficiently. He had probably stolen cars
  before. The plaid patch was not absurd, nor the sleeveless jacket. Probably
  his pants were hitched up with string and she had overlooked the old soup can
  that all tramps carry.</p>

  <p>He came back very clean-looking and surprisingly wholesome; when he opened
  the basket and offered her a sandwich she saw that his nails were immaculate.
  But he was a little shaky; his eyes bloodshot. They were gray eyes set well
  apart, but they were decidedly bloodshot. There was a thermos bottle in the
  basket. The coffee steamed as he poured it into one of the cups that he had
  found in this heaven-sent basket.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said, and sat down cross-legged, "let's get everything right! I
  know you are here, I know that you were in the Swede's house&mdash;by the
  way, he did hang himself from that hook, but I thought it best to
  lie&mdash;and I know that in some mysterious fashion you have got yourself
  attached to me. But exactly why and how?"</p>

  <p>She sat very upright at this. Was he joking? Apparently not. He was
  sipping at his cup, one reddish eye regarding her over its edge.</p>

  <p>"I'm your wife," she said.</p>

  <p>He choked, coughed, and put down the cup.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon?"</p>

  <p>"I am your wife," she said, and by the rising horror that made his
  unpleasant face assume a terrifying hideousness, she gathered that he did not
  well remember all that had happened at Littleburg.</p>

  <p>"My wife, you said. You're not serious?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I've very serious. You don't remember?"</p>

  <p>No, he did not remember.</p>

  <p>"The young devils! They came up to me in the wood&mdash;all of them as
  tight as foolish young people can be. I had no idea what their little game
  was&mdash;in fact, I was expecting quite a different sort of party. One of
  them&mdash;Mr. Goldbuckle, a young man who talks a great deal about
  himself"&mdash;she recognized Sam immediately&mdash;"asked me to drink. And
  just about then I didn't want to drink. I don't recall the circumstances of
  my defeat. Two of them knelt on my chest&mdash;one fellow put the neck of a
  bottle in my mouth. It was a case of drink or perish. I drank. Did I go to
  your house?"</p>

  <p>She told him undramatically. And as she went on he punctuated the story
  with startled "Good Lord's!"</p>

  <p>"But you're really serious? I married you&mdash;or rather, you married
  me?"</p>

  <p>She was very serious, she said.</p>

  <p>Robin covered his face with his hands and moaned.</p>

  <p>"What a perfectly horrible nightmare!"</p>

  <p>She was interested but not offended.</p>

  <p>"Is it, Mr. Leslie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Mr. who?" he demanded, his eyes wide open.</p>

  <p>"That is the name you gave&mdash;Mr. Robin Leslie. I suppose you dreamed
  that?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head dispiritedly.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;that's my name all right&mdash;at least, it is my
  Christian&mdash;given name: Robin Leslie Beausere&mdash;no, it <i>isn't</i>
  French. It was never French," he said testily, in answer to her inquiry.
  "What a perfectly ghastly thing to happen! I suppose I was awfully
  tight."</p>

  <p>"You were rather&mdash;tight," she said; "in fact, very. You said you were
  sorry&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I was sober then," grimly. "What is or was your name?"</p>

  <p>"October Jones&mdash;horrible, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Ghastly," he groaned. "Moses&mdash;<i>what</i> a name!"</p>

  <p>She stiffened at this.</p>

  <p>"I don't see anything 'ghastly' about it," she said coldly. "It is
  certainly unusual."</p>

  <p>"Unusual! What am I to call you?"</p>

  <p>"You may call me October," she replied.</p>

  <p>"I'll be&mdash;I won't, anyway. What a lout!"</p>

  <p>It was strange to her that she should guess he was referring to Sam.</p>

  <p>"I don't think that you have anything to complain about," she said, still
  a trifle annoyed.</p>

  <p>His solemn eyes were fixed on hers.</p>

  <p>"You were sober," he said with significance. "I was incapable of offering
  resistance. "</p>

  <p>"Oh!" said October indignantly and half rose. He waved her down.</p>

  <p>"Don't let us start our married life with a quarrel," he said sombrely.
  "Have another sandwich."</p>

  <p>She took the sandwich because she was hungry.</p>

  <p>"We will pack all the grub that is left," he suggested. "I don't think we
  shall be getting any eats as sumptuous as these for a very long time."</p>

  <p>He looked up at the sky.</p>

  <p>"Seven o'clock&mdash;between that and eight. We ought to double back
  toward Littleburg, then strike east. There is plenty of timber in this
  country, thank Heaven! With luck we should find a place where we can sleep
  before nightfall."</p>

  <p>"Why does that red-bearded man want you? Have you committed a crime?"</p>

  <p>He smiled with his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Have I committed a crime? Yes. I burgled a factory at that funny-sounding
  place&mdash;Schenectady. This is my chief offense. I don't mind <i>him</i>.
  It is the little fellow, the knife-throwing gentleman, who rattles me. He is
  rather wonderful&mdash;a South American, I suppose. Leonardo Dellamontez. And
  run! That fellow can sprint like a hare. You wouldn't think so to see him.
  Very fat and short in the leg. I shouldn't think he could sit a horse. But a
  real artist."</p>

  <p>He spoke dispassionately, if anything admiringly, of the knife thrower.
  October had the illusion that they were sitting together on the grandstand
  watching Leonardo competing in some murderous Olympic game.</p>

  <p>"You're not a real tramp, are you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Sure as you're born!" he answered. "Is that the right thing to say? Yes,
  I'm a tramp, but the State of New York is not an ideal tramping ground. There
  is no merit in the exercise you get from strolling through a picture gallery.
  Now the Gobi Desert is real tramping! And the woolly lands beyond Urzra.
  That's tramping, too!"</p>

  <p>She had a dim idea that the Gobi Desert was in China, but Urzra she could
  not place.</p>

  <p>"Mongolia&mdash;it's Red now. Queer little place full of Buddhist priests
  and dogs that will pull you down in the street and leave nothing but your
  watch and guard."</p>

  <p>"But," she insisted, "you're tramping for&mdash;for fun, for pleasure. It
  is a sort of vacation rucksack hike, isn't it? You aren't tramping because
  you've no money and&mdash;well, because you can't get work?"</p>

  <p>"I've got fifty cents," he said. "Just now I'm tramping to save my
  life!"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'd hate to tell you," he said. "If I did, you'd say what I say, 'Such
  things cannot be!'"</p>

  <p>"But what <i>are</i> the things?"</p>

  <p>He rose, gathered her cup, and corked the vacuum bottle.</p>

  <p>"Mediaeval things&mdash;things you hear about in the Valley of the Rhone
  and on the Rhine. The history of France is full of it, and England. Ever
  heard of Queen Ethelfleda? What a lady! That is what I am finding in this
  Empire State of yours&mdash;just mad, impossible things that cannot be.
  You're another of 'em! Good Lord!"</p>

  <p>He was shaking his head at her.</p>

  <p>"I really must have been tight!"</p>

  <p>"Intoxicated," she said. "You're almost offensive."</p>

  <p>"Am I?" He was immediately penitent. His unsightly face drooped. "Of
  course I am. But I just feel that I <i>can</i> be offensive to you."</p>

  <p>She knew what he meant and was fairly well pleased.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7"
     name="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

  <p class="first">THE way they took was a painful one. They traversed mile
  upon mile of sloping hill; she seemed, most of the time, to be walking
  alternately on the right side of her right foot and the left of the other.
  Both legs ached in turn, while the other went cramped. And yet she carried
  nothing. It was Robin Leslie Beausere who was cluttered up with food and
  blanket. She did not even carry her own coat.</p>

  <p>There was very little conversation. He admitted that he did not know the
  country at all; she was as ignorant. New York State was foreign territory to
  her. Now if it had been Virginia or Ohio&mdash;</p>

  <p>She did not even know the names or relative positions of the towns. Twice
  she had been to New York City, but the sleeper of an express is a poor place
  to study topography. She knew Ogdensburg, because she had taken trips along
  the St. Lawrence and had called there. With Littleburg and its environs she
  was fairly well acquainted, but they were miles and miles from
  Littleburg&mdash;forty, she supposed. He thought more.</p>

  <p>Ethelfleda? Who was Queen Ethelfleda? October had a sketchy acquaintance
  with the British monarchs. Ethelfleda&mdash;Alfred&mdash;one of the Saxon
  bunch. What had they to do with a fifty-cent tramp in the State of New
  York?</p>

  <p>It was intriguing, bizarre. She could hardly keep her eyes from the plaid
  patch. Once upon a time she had made a study of the Scottish tartans. It
  wasn't Stewart&mdash;Stewart is red; and it was not Cameron&mdash;that had a
  yellowish line in it (or was that Gordon?).</p>

  <p>"Campbell!" she cried triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" He came round in alarm.</p>

  <p>"That patch&mdash;on your trousers. It is a Campbell tartan!"</p>

  <p>"Is it?" He screwed his head to see. "I am not fearfully keen on the
  Campbells. So it is&mdash;how clever of you! The Argyll and Sutherland
  Highlanders wear that pattern of kilt. A pretty good regiment&mdash;mainly
  recruited in the Midlands."</p>

  <p>As he lifted his jacket to examine the patch she saw the butt of a gun in
  his pocket. She had supposed the revolver, but had forgotten all about
  it.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it very dangerous carrying a pistol in New York?" she asked. "I
  mean&mdash;in your position?"</p>

  <p>"Much more dangerous not to&mdash;especially now."</p>

  <p>He resumed his march and was talking over his shoulder, and then, at a
  tangent:</p>

  <p>"I suppose you wouldn't have the slightest difficulty in getting a
  divorce?"</p>

  <p>"I don't wish a divorce&mdash;yet," she said calmly, and she heard him
  groan again. "You're very ungallant," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am, aren't I? Very sorry. What is the best remedy for a poison-ivy
  skin?"</p>

  <p>"Does it hurt?" She was sympathetic.</p>

  <p>"A wee bit&mdash;nothing to make a fuss about. It rather irritates when
  one is hot. Hullo!"</p>

  <p>He stood stock-still. Ahead of them they heard the clop-clop of a
  lumberman's ax, and as they stood, the swish and thud of falling timber.</p>

  <p>They were walking along the wet floor of a little ravine. There was cover
  enough in case of necessity, thickly growing clumps of dark laurel and
  fernlike sumac. The walls of the little canon rose steeply. Looking up, he
  saw with some concern a small hut perched on the edge. But there was no sign
  of a man or his inevitable dog.</p>

  <p>"Let's try this other face," he suggested. "I'm afraid that the unsparing
  woodmen are on the other side of that bluff."</p>

  <p>He went first, and their progress was painfully slow. In half an hour he
  drew himself cautiously over the side of a rock. Before him was a beautiful
  sight, trees&mdash;spruce, pine, basswood&mdash;an impenetrable fairy
  woodland that belonged to dreams.</p>

  <p>After a careful reconnaissance he signalled her to follow. They plunged
  into the cool twilight and silence. A game preserve of some kind, he thought;
  big, tame birds were strutting on the ground, a hen pheasant rose at his feet
  and went noisily to a less disturbed area. There were rabbits&mdash;he
  thought he saw a sleek black stoat&mdash;or were there any stoats in North
  America?</p>

  <p>The nest they found by accident&mdash;it was a saucer-.like depression in
  a small hillock, and was shielded from view, supposing anybody came, by
  low-growing bushes and high-growing ferns.</p>

  <p>"We can't light a fire," he said, as he spread the blanket for her to sit
  upon, "but happily there is no need. You may find the ground damp. We will
  move on before night."</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?"</p>

  <p>"Prescott," he told her. "Not exactly Prescott, but a few miles down
  river. Hungry?"</p>

  <p>He produced the thermos bottle. The coffee was lukewarm but
  refreshing&mdash;what was left.</p>

  <p>"But how do you know which way we're going?"</p>

  <p>He felt in his hip pocket where the pistol was and brought out a little
  compass. Because the nest was rather difficult to find he broke off a small
  branch of a young tree and stuck it upright&mdash;more for her guidance than
  his.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind being left alone? I want to do a little exploring."</p>

  <p>He was gone the greater part of two hours (she had become aware of her
  wrist watch in the course of their morning march) and he returned carrying
  three cantaloupes. There was a farm on the edge of the wood, he told her.</p>

  <p>"Some swell lives there&mdash;it looks like one of those
  gentleman-farmer's places&mdash;pedigreed cows and a good dancing floor.
  There was a wonderful pair of blue pants drying on a line, but I hadn't the
  nerve to raid 'em. Seen the newspapers?"</p>

  <p>He took a sheet from his pocket. When he had lifted the cantaloupes he had
  also paid a visit to a gardener's shed. The newspaper had been lying on the
  bench.</p>

  <p>"You're famous," he said.</p>

  <p>She unfolded the page, her mouth opened.</p><br>

  <p class="headline">FIENDISH HOBO STEALS WIFE OF<br>
  LITTLEBURG SOCIETY MAN</p>

  <p class="headline">Doped in Wood by Drink-Crazed Thief,<br>
  Bridegroom Sees His Beautiful Bride Married to Tramp</p>

  <p class="headline">County Roused. Armed vigilants searching all night.<br>
  Stolen woman niece of Littleburg's most prominent citizen</p><br>

  <p>Beneath was a very large picture of October. Sharing honours was a
  smirking Sam. The photograph had been taken on the occasion of Ye Olde
  Englishe Fayre, an event organized for a Littleburg charity. It depicted Sam
  with an inane smile on his face, his hat tilted over one eye. In all the
  circumstances there was some discrepancy between the festal picture and the
  caption:</p>

  <p class="caption">Robbed of Bride, Samuel E. Wasser, Prominent Clubman of
  Littleburg, Lies Prostrate with Grief.</p><br>

  <p>"Is this the miscreant who married us?" asked Robin.</p>

  <p>There indeed was the Reverend Stevens&mdash;but not in profile. And even
  as he slept he had become a controversial subject.</p><br>

  <p class="headline">Rev. Stevens held up at point of gun and forced to
  perform ceremony.</p><br>

  <p>"Why!" October's eyes were blazing. "How <i>could</i> they! How could
  they! Oh!"</p>

  <p>He was examining the news sheet critically.</p>

  <p>"That is a pretty good portrait of you. Most of these things
  flatter&mdash;I rather like your hair done that way."</p>

  <p>"I am going right back to Littleburg to tell them they are liars," she
  stormed. "Liars! Prominent society man, that&mdash;that <i>hick</i>! Oh, but
  it is too bad&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Worse to come&mdash;did you see the very latest? It is on the back page.
  You can't go back."</p>

  <p>With trembling hands she turned the newspaper and found the worst.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper"><b>Has beautiful October Jones met with a terrible death
  at the hands of the mad tramp-fiend? That is the question all Littleburg is
  asking.</b></p><br>

  <p>"You see," he explained gravely. "You can't go back if you're dead; that
  would be an anticlimax and would be unpardonable. They would never forgive
  you. You had better stay dead for a week or two."</p>

  <p>"'Drink-crazed tramp'! Minister 'held at point of gun'! I must do
  something!"</p>

  <p>"Write to <i>The Times</i>," he said soothingly.</p>

  <p>"<i>The Times</i>? Don't be absurd. Can't you see what this means?
  Everybody will be searching for you&mdash;you'll never have a fair
  chance&mdash;they will shoot you like a dog if they come upon you here
  or&mdash;or anywhere!"</p>

  <p>"I suppose they would." Only then such an idea occurred to him,
  apparently. He was rather surprised. "Pity one can't buy the afternoon
  extras&mdash;I'd like to know what Gussie says about the car. Do you
  bet?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean," she said, bewildered.</p>

  <p>"If you did I would bet you that Gussie says nothing. Not a word&mdash;not
  a syllable. Of course, the farm hand may have seen us without being able to
  identify the machine I drove. In which case the search will shift nearer. Do
  you think you could sleep?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps later&mdash;you're all nerved up by this infernal newspaper
  report. Sorry I brought it with me&mdash;I thought you would be amused."</p>

  <p>"Amused!" she scoffed.</p>

  <p>As the afternoon wore on she began to feel drowsy and fell asleep for an
  hour. She awoke to find him lying flat on his face at the edge of the
  "saucer." He had parted the ferns that obstructed his view, and as he looked
  back at her she guessed that her awakening owed nothing to chance.</p>

  <p>"I saw a woman walking in the wood," he said in a low voice. "She was some
  distance away. Probably she belongs to the farm. I thought I had better kick
  you."</p>

  <p>"Did you kick me?" indignantly.</p>

  <p>"We're married," he said. "I understand the practice is very usual in our
  circle."</p>

  <p>Half an hour passed.</p>

  <p>"I have been a brute," he said, without turning his head. "No, not over
  kicking you. That whisky was what Goldbuckle would call fierce. I'm still a
  little dithery, but I can think. When this woman has gone I will take you to
  the farm&mdash;at least to the outskirts. You'll find your way into the house
  and 'phone. I want you please to lie about me: say you left me on the
  Ogdensburg road&mdash;wherever that may be."</p>

  <p>"Leave you?" She was aghast.</p>

  <p>"Of course&mdash;you can't go around sleeping in woods&mdash;hunted and
  God knows what. I'm being selfish, really. It will be easier for me to get
  away. And you can tell them, of course, that you aren't dead and that I'm
  quite&mdash;as tramps go&mdash;respectable. I was joking this morning about
  your not being able to go back because you were dead. But you Americans have
  no sense of English humour."</p>

  <p>She, too, was lying face downward now. Her hands were clasped under her
  chin.</p>

  <p>"I'm late but I'm laughing," she said calmly. "How funny!"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>He screwed his head round to her, and he was frowning. Much of the
  inflammation had left his face&mdash;one red wheal ran from his ear and
  disappeared in the growth upon his chin.</p>

  <p>"Do you really expect me to go to the farm and say 'Please, I'm the stolen
  bride of the Littleburg Society Man?' Have you any imagination?"</p>

  <p>He scratched his nose, frowning deeper.</p>

  <p>"I have&mdash;but I'd rather like to hear how yours is working."</p>

  <p>She flashed a quick smile. He had not seen her smile before, and the
  experience left him a little breathless.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you," she nodded. "I am met by the lady of the house&mdash;I
  relate my sad story. She looks at me oddly. Do you know what I mean?
  Just&mdash;oddly. Can't you see her eyebrows going up, can't you hear her
  saying, 'My poor child!'&mdash;supposing she is playing at farms and not a
  real slave-wife. And then she telephones to the police and maybe to Mrs.
  Elmer. And then she seeks her dearest friend, who maybe is staying with her,
  and, closing the door so that the servants can't hear, tells her. And then
  they look at one another and one says, 'What do you think?' and the other
  says 'Well&mdash;they're married,' and then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, yes!" Robin spoke hurriedly. He was actually embarrassed. "Of
  course, yes. Shut up!" This last outrageous piece of rudeness in a fierce
  whisper. "The woman!"</p>

  <p>October followed his example and, gently pressing back the ferns,
  looked.</p>

  <p>The lady was very near to them. She strode manfully, using a black ebony
  walking cane. She was in black, and over her gray head she wore a Spanish
  mantilla. In point of inches she was enormous, and her thinness made her seem
  taller. Coming into a patch of sunlight, the swinging hands glittered
  dazzlingly. October saw this in spite of herself, for she was gazing
  awe-stricken at the face of the woman. Dead white, with dark-rimmed eyes and
  a nose that was grotesquely big and outstanding. Diamonds flashed at her
  ears, from her wrist, from the black corsage. She went on out of sight, and
  then October heard the man sigh.</p>

  <p>"Queen Ethelfleda! Did you see her? Elfleda! Suffering
  snakes&mdash;here!"</p>

  <p>"Elfleda? Is that her name?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head; his staring eyes were still glued to the tree clumps
  around which she had disappeared. He was a comical picture of amazement.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll go sideways! Elfleda, the old sport! She follows hounds that
  way, takes anything from a stone wall to a cut road. And she's there when
  they kill&mdash;always! By gum! Elfleda!"</p>

  <p>"Is her name Elfleda?" October was a thought impatient.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;Loamer&mdash;the Lady Georgina Loamer. Her father was the
  Marquis of Dealford. Funny old devil and everlastingly broke."</p>

  <p>"You know her?" She was astonished.</p>

  <p>"Only in a hat-touching way. 'Good-morning, my lady&mdash;I hope your
  ladyship is well'&mdash;that kind of thing. We are not"&mdash;he chuckled
  softly&mdash;"on speaking terms. She is staying at the farm. You can't go
  there."</p>

  <p>"I cannot because I will not," said October correctly. "I am going
  through&mdash;Prescott, isn't it? What will you do in Prescott?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much."</p>

  <p>He was looking at her glumly; she felt that she had suddenly become a
  worry to him.</p>

  <p>"Anyway, I refuse to go back." She very resolutely spoke her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"I remember the wedding now, dimly," he said. "I thought that it was a
  part of the rag&mdash;jamboree, whatever you call it. Just remember
  it&mdash;faintly!"</p>

  <p>A little while after this he pillowed his face on his arm and fell asleep.
  October took stock of the food. There were two very stale biscuits, a small
  box of crackers, three cakes of chocolate, and a segment of pie, the latter
  carefully wrapped in thin white paper. They would not starve. There was, in
  addition to the thermos bottle, a flat, military-looking water flask, which
  Robin had filled just before they climbed out of the ravine.</p>

  <p>She sat patiently, her hands folded in her lap; it was her turn to keep
  guard. There was an importance in her vigil. Now and again she looked through
  the ferns but saw nothing. The sun was sinking. Millions of tiny flies began
  to gyrate in great clouds under the spread of every tree. She heard more
  distinctly the tap-tap-tap of a woodpecker.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?" she did not know that he was awake.</p>

  <p>"About seven&mdash;aren't you hungry?"</p>

  <p>He sat up, rubbing his face vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Starving," he answered, and they supped together frugally. After they had
  wrapped up what food remained (and they ate the stalest items first) he
  outlined his programme. They would start before the light was entirely gone
  and make for the southern section of the reserve. He believed that a post
  road ran somewhere in that direction. And there was a railway somewhere near.
  In point of fact, they had heard hoarse whistles and the far-off clang of
  bells during the afternoon. The trouble was going to be at the bridges, he
  said. If they came to any considerable stream they must follow it or find
  some means of crossing. He was an expert on such things, she gathered, and
  had evaded several unhappy experiences by a careful avoidance of bridges. As
  far as he could understand they would "fetch up" in the morning midway
  between Ogdensburg and a place he called "Liffy's." He was very emphatic
  about "Liffy's." She thought it was a township, but apparently Liffy was a
  human being who maintained himself precariously by the hiring of boats.</p>

  <p>"He is Irish," he explained gravely. "His brother shot my uncle&mdash;not
  fatally, I'm sorry to say. But even bad marksmanship has not disturbed our
  good relations. His other name is Mike."</p>

  <p>All this in the preparation for departure. She asked a question.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't think he has been a tramp. At any rate, I have never met him
  in that role. He has been most other things. Are you ready?"</p>

  <p>Night was coming down when, with the motor rug rolled and fastened
  horse-collar fashion about his shoulder, he led the way. The wood was deeper
  than she thought. Between tree tops she saw the thin crescent of a new moon.
  The harsh shriek of an owl near at hand made her jump involuntarily.</p>

  <p>"Made me jump, too," he comforted her.</p>

  <p>They were descending all the time, and this worried him a little. Most
  abruptly their progress was stopped by a high wire fence. The wood's natural
  boundary was beyond this, for the wire ran irregularly from tree to tree.
  Searching the ground, he found a piece of branch wood suitable for the
  purpose, and prized up the lower strand of the wire.</p>

  <p>"You can slip under&mdash;keep very close to the ground and make yourself
  thin!"</p>

  <p>She got under with only a slight mishap. One of the sharp barbs caught the
  old coat which she insisted she should wear, and ripped a narrow strip.</p>

  <p>"You'll be a real hobo in a week," he said. "Rags and tatters&mdash;I must
  hunt up a tomato can for you!"</p>

  <p>By some miracle he himself wriggled under without a scratch.</p>

  <p>"'Let caution mark the way,'" he quoted, dropping his voice. "The post
  road is nearer than I thought."</p>

  <p>Nearer, indeed. From the thicketlike density of the wood they came
  suddenly within a few yards of the open, and a road bright with the lights of
  stationary automobiles.</p>

  <p>"... the lumber man said he say 'um go into Mr. Murphy's reservation.
  Don't let anybody move till we get the signal from the fellers on the other
  side of the park. An' listen, fellers, I want first crack at that bird. I got
  somethin' to wipe out, tha's what! If I get him over my sights he's dead,
  tha's all! Don't any of you fellers forget it. I'm speakin' as man of the
  world to men of the world. I got to get him or he's got to get me."</p>

  <p>Sam Wasser was addressing a select and approving audience. Even as he
  spoke there came the sound of a shot beyond the woods.</p>

  <p>"Get your lights ready, boys, and don't shoot the young lady."</p>

  <p>They came surging up the bank to where a petrified October stood gripping
  her husband's sleeve in terror.</p>

  <p>"Back! Under the wire. I'll go first."</p>

  <p>Before she reached the fence he was under; he dragged her through with
  some violence. She heard another rent made in her coat.</p>

  <p>"Left. Hurry. They don't know about the wire."</p>

  <p>Evidently the party had halted for another reason.</p>

  <p>"Spread out! Ed, you go right along to the corner. Mr. Elmer&mdash;Where's
  Mr. Elmer? Oh, say, Mr. Elmer, you stick along here."</p>

  <p>The corner? There would be an angle to the fence and the confines of the
  estate must be fairly near.</p>

  <p>"Run!" he said under his breath, and she obeyed.</p>

  <p>The right-angle fence appeared as unexpectedly as its fellow. Peering
  through, Robin saw that the roadway was deserted. He yanked up the lower
  strand and the girl slipped under. She held the wire less efficiently while
  he followed.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;my coat wouldn't show a new tear."</p>

  <p>Ed, ordered to the corner, must have obeyed with some reluctance. He was
  nowhere in sight. The two made to the right, keeping by the side of the road
  and walking in single file. From the wood came the sound of a shot and then
  another; there followed a fusillade. She saw that he was shaking with
  laughter.</p>

  <p>"They will kill one another and I shall be blamed," he said, and he was
  almost prophetic.</p>

  <p>Two specks of light showed ahead of them. They lay flat on the side of the
  road until the car passed.</p>

  <p>"We had better keep to the verge," he said, and explained that the ancient
  word for the borders of a road was "slang." "Gipsies used to camp on the
  slang&mdash;gipsies and wandering tinkers with a queer language of their own.
  And 'slang' has passed into the vocabulary as all queer languages."</p>

  <p>He was oddly informative and at the most unlikely moments. She asked him
  to elucidate his riddle of Queen Elfleda, but here he was not obliging.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you one day," he said. "Jolly old Elfleda! What a perfect
  lady!"</p>

  <p>They walked over a mile before they came to a byroad. Private tracks there
  were, leading to gloomy farm buildings; once a big dog leaped out at them
  from an open gate. Robin whistled and the dog came to his side and was with
  difficulty persuaded to go to his home again.</p>

  <p>They were within a few yards of the side road when October whispered:</p>

  <p>"Are you sure we are not being followed?"</p>

  <p>He looked back.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think we were; why?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;I'm nervous, I suppose. But I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>They turned into the side road at this minute and he waved her on, and,
  crouching down by the corner of the fence that bounded the main road, looked
  back. He remained for a few minutes before he joined the girl.</p>

  <p>"I saw nobody&mdash;did you?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm not sure. I thought I saw somebody walking on the side of
  the road. It may have been imagination."</p>

  <p>Less than a mile away was a railroad. They saw a brilliantly lighted train
  moving across the landscape.</p>

  <p>"There is a crossing at the end of this road, I suppose," mused Robin. "We
  might take the track, but I've a notion that wouldn't help us any. We'd
  probably land in the very place we wish to avoid."</p>

  <p>The plan was to cross the track and find a road on the far side that ran
  parallel. That which they now trudged did not run straight to the railroad,
  they found. Halfway down there was a sharp elbow, and in the crook of it were
  two high gates flanked by tall pillars that led to a drive and eventually, as
  he supposed, to a house hidden behind the high clipped hedges that lined the
  fence and flanked the drive. As he stopped to make an inspection a dog barked
  furiously, but evidently it was leashed.</p>

  <p>But a bigger danger than dogs threatened. As they stood October saw that
  she was casting a long dim shadow on the ground. The man had seen it, too,
  and looked round. At the far end of the road two motor lights showed and they
  were growing in brilliance every fraction of a second.</p>

  <p>Robin made a swift survey. There was no cover of any kind; it was
  impossible that, passing them, the motorists could miss seeing them, and in
  that bright light there could be no question but that they would be
  identified. He saw an iron ring dangling from the gate, turned it, and, as a
  heavy iron latch came up, the big gate moved open.</p>

  <p>October needed no instructions to follow; she had become inured to
  furtiveness and was inside the gate almost as soon as he. He fastened the
  gate again. The dog was barking furiously. So close was the car that there
  was light enough to see the gaps that offered shelter. They had to crawl on
  hands and knees before they rolled over under a hedge, completely hidden. The
  machine had stopped; somebody got down and, walking to the gate, flung it
  open with a crash. From the direction of the invisible house a man's voice
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Dick?"</p>

  <p>"Yep. Sorry I'm late&mdash;Bill, did you hear the shooting?"</p>

  <p>The man walked from the house up the drive to meet him, his feet
  scrunching pleasantly on the gravel.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Shooting? Yes, I thought I heard something. Dog was barking like mad.
  What is the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"That dam' hobo&mdash;the feller that killed the Littleburg girl. They got
  him on Murphy's land&mdash;Murphy is trying to look as if he enjoyed having
  his birds shot over in September! Some of these Jakes started into blaze away
  at one another. Nobody killed&mdash;that's the wonder. I'll get the machine
  inside. Sorry I'm late."</p>

  <p>His voice receded; evidently he was going to the car. There was a harsh
  purr, the machine turned cautiously into the drive and somebody clanged the
  gate behind it.</p>

  <p>"Let my man come out and put it away. Leave it, Dick."</p>

  <p>There was a chuckle, a snap of steel.</p>

  <p>"Best lock the gears while that bird is around. He lifted a car last
  night&mdash;they found it up on Quarry Hill, eh? He's some mover, that bum!
  Wait, I'll get my valise."</p>

  <p>"Come on"&mdash;impatiently. "I'll send Hawkins for it."</p>

  <p>Sounds of two pairs of feet on gravel; silence as they crossed the grass
  floor of a lawn.</p>

  <p>"Get out&mdash;quick as you can," Robin whispered. She had never seen him
  quite as excited. "Walk along toward the railway and wait."</p>

  <p>October obeyed, wriggling out under the hedge&mdash;a terribly difficult
  exit this proved to be, for the car lights had been extinguished and she
  could not see the providential gap through which they had come.</p>

  <p>She lifted the latch noiselessly and stepped into the road. She thought
  that the car theft of the night before was to be repeated, and it might have
  been but for those locked gears. The ignition was also locked, but he could
  have made a short circuit under the hood and overcome that difficulty. The
  gears defied him.</p>

  <p>She turned to the right as she went out, and had walked a hundred yards
  when a doubt assailed her. The house had been on the left: she was going back
  the way she had come. Or wasn't she? Standing irresolutely for a moment, she
  considered. She saw the lights of a winking train as it passed through a belt
  of trees. Of course ...</p>

  <p>She had started to run when she saw the men. They stood one on each side
  of the road, motionless pillars of black&mdash;but men. Her heart was
  thumping painfully; for an instant she was breathless. Robin must be warned;
  they had been followed.</p>

  <p>She walked rapidly along the centre of the road, and they crossed to
  intercept her.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, ma'am."</p>

  <p>It was Red Beard. She would have detected his voice among a thousand.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8"
     name="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

  <p class="first">"GOOD-NIGHT," said October, and would have gone on, but he
  threw out his hand and she found her arm gripped painfully.</p>

  <p>"Goin' far, ma'am?"</p>

  <p>"No, to Mr.&mdash;to the house. Please let me go&mdash;or I'll call
  for&mdash;my brother."</p>

  <p>"Didn't know she had any brother, d'you, Lenny? Thought she was just one
  lone li'l' orphan. Hey, where's that hobo friend of yourn?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean." She spoke loudly. Robin could hear. And then
  a panic seized her. Suppose he heard and came? These two men were after him;
  one threw knives.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter&mdash;nobody's goin' to hurt you, are they, Lenny?"</p>

  <p>He invariably appealed to Lenny, and as a general rule Lenny said nothing.
  He bent over past her and whispered into the ear of his companion.</p>

  <p>"Uh huh," grunted Lenny, "thasso."</p>

  <p>"You come along back to your uncle, ma'am," said Red Beard. "I guess we're
  mighty poor kind of hicks after runnin' around with that swell husband of
  yours, but you better stick along of us, hey, Lenny?"</p>

  <p>All the time she was conscious of a tense alertness in him; he was like a
  man who expected attack from some quarter, he knew not whence. Then she saw
  the gun in his hand&mdash;sensed it rather, for the night was very dark; the
  crescent moon had slid down from the sky and only the stars gave light.</p>

  <p>"Come along." His grip of her arm did not relax; he was sidling. Lenny
  made no pretense that he was not walking backward.</p>

  <p>Starlight, faint and ghostly, was reflected back in the knife he carried
  between finger and thumb.</p>

  <p>"Must be grand marryin' that kind of trash. Been a dream sort of
  honeymoon, ain't it, ma'am?"</p>

  <p>"What are you scared of?" she asked. "And must you walk like a
  crab&mdash;if he shoots you, you will fall on me."</p>

  <p>She heard the quick catch of his breath, and then he laughed softly, but
  not heartily.</p>

  <p>"That's good! Heard that, Lenny? I guess your husband's somewhere around,
  ma'am? There's a bunch handy that wants to get acquainted with him. Ain't
  there, Lenny?"</p>

  <p>"Thasso," said Lenny.</p>

  <p>"Got a gun, ain't he, ma'am? I'll bet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Watch out!"</p>

  <p>For the life of her she could not resist the mischievous inclination. He
  jumped sideways with an oath. For an instant she was free, but he clawed at
  her.</p>

  <p>"Say, what's this funny stuff, Missis Tramp? What's the idea? I guess
  we're laughin' at you, ain't we, Lenny? Funny stuff&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He was loud and angry. Thereafter they progressed much more quickly, but
  neither Red Beard nor the silent Lenny kept his head still. Every two steps
  one glanced back.</p>

  <p>"We'll get him, don't worry, ma'am. He's around, that's all we want to
  know. There's two men guardin' the crossin', anyway. I guess before mornin'
  we'll be takin' you down to the morgue an' sayin', 'Pick yours, ma'am.' Hey,
  Lenny?"</p>

  <p>"Thasso," said Lenny.</p>

  <p>"What are you in real life?" she asked. "Just thieves or merely
  gunmen?"</p>

  <p>"Say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Gunmen, I guess," she nodded. "They're cheapest in Chicago. Somebody told
  me you can get them at basement prices."</p>

  <p>Red Beard had his civic pride. Chicago was his home town. He developed a
  spluttering obscurity of speech.</p>

  <p>"Listen, you. What's good enough for me's good enough for&mdash;say,
  what's the matter with you, anyway? Cheap! I like that, hey, Lenny? What's
  cheaper'n a hobo's girl, huh!"</p>

  <p>They had reached the post road; there was a thrilling spectacle revealed.
  Quite near them cars were packed end to end. The ground rose gently to one
  side of the road, apparently No Man's Land, for the sloping ground beyond was
  unfenced. A fire was burning&mdash;a regular camp fire that lit the trees
  picturesquely. Since it was a warm night, a camp fire was unnecessary in its
  first essential. But it was undoubtedly picturesque and threw strange lights
  upon stern faces, glinted on the barrels of shotguns and glittered evilly on
  the face of Mr. Elmer's big watch.</p>

  <p>"A quarter of eleven. I guess we'd better get back to Littleburg, Sam.
  Seems likely we've missed 'um. I figure that October's dead. Maybe it's best
  for everybody."</p>

  <p>He glanced sideways and backward at the one woman of the party. Mrs. Elmer
  had a passion for a peculiarly sticky candy; her cheeks bulged, her narrow
  jaws worked monotonously. Mrs. Elmer shook her head, tears welled from her
  eyes, her jaw went up and down.</p>

  <p>"Lumberman saw her," said Sam briefly.</p>

  <p>He sat cross-legged, elbow on knee, his small chin cupped in his palm.
  Across his legs was a shotgun. Mr. Elmer had twice pushed the muzzle in
  another direction than himself.</p>

  <p>Sam was staring into the fire. His face was very red, his brows knit
  terribly.</p>

  <p>"I ought to have killed him," he said hollowly. "I had a feelin' when I
  see him&mdash;saw him&mdash;first time. Sort of creepy
  feelin'&mdash;fate!"</p>

  <p>Somebody asked how long it would take for this damned old fire to burn
  itself out; another wondered whether it should be left. One or two of the
  searchers had already stolen away to their machines.</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer looked at his watch.</p>

  <p>"Nobody can blame anybody," he said comfortably. "October was that kind of
  girl. Remember once, when I was goin' to correct her, she walked right over
  to the well. 'You touch me,' she says, 'an' I'll jump in.'That's
  October!"</p>

  <p>Sam wrinkled his nose in a sneer. He was, by common agreement, the most
  important member of the party, the acknowledged leader, the Chief Victim. He
  could and did resent the presence of any other Authority on the subject of
  October and her eccentricities.</p>

  <p>"She jumped in all right!" he said bitterly. "The question is, was it
  arranged? Mighty queer to me that she said that very mornin', 'One man's good
  as another. I'd as soon marry a tramp.'"</p>

  <p>Andrew was startled by this new hypothesis; the jaws of Mrs. Elmer stopped
  moving.</p>

  <p>"That's the question: Was it fixed?" Sam addressed a new audience,
  attracted by a relief from the sameness of argument and speculation. "He was
  there, sittin' by the path. She must have seen him; he saw her. 'Yes,' he
  says when I asked him."</p>

  <p>He looked up at this point; his scorched eyes stared to one side of the
  blazing wood. The red-bearded man he did not know. The girl in the torn and
  ragged coat who came into the light of the fire he knew. He gripped his gun
  and glared at her. Mr. Elmer rose unsteadily to his feet.</p>

  <p>"October!" he gasped, and was uncertain how further to proceed, for she
  was no prodigal daughter, nor yet a sheep returned to the fold. He realized
  in that heart-searching moment that she was no more, no less, than the Cat
  Who Wouldn't Drown.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sam Wasser gave him time to think. Still clasping his shotgun, he took
  three strides forward and confronted her.</p>

  <p>"You've come back, eh, October?"</p>

  <p>His huskiness was appropriate.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Beausere," she said icily. "I'm married."</p>

  <p>This set him blinking and arrested what might well have been an historic
  utterance. Instead:</p>

  <p>"Married&mdash;ah! Oh, yes! Ain't that fine. Ain't you ashamed, October
  Jones! I wouldn't have your disposition an' character an' everythin' for a
  million dollars! Ain't you ashamed!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be hysterical," said October, "and don't called me
  'Jones'&mdash;I'm through with the Joneses for everlasting."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elmer had staggered forward in faltering stages. She was a woman and
  knew a woman's place. Her head drooped forward, her face wore that look of
  pained surprise with which she invariably met all life's crises.</p>

  <p>"October!" she said mournfully. "Oh, October!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Wasser saw his duty.</p>

  <p>"Don't you go gettin' mixed up in this," he said sharply. "October's made
  her bed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elmer transfixed him with a look.</p>

  <p>"I want to know," she said.</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer coughed. Gaping spectators turned delicately away and pretended
  to be interested in one another. They would know all about it later; they
  could afford to wait. Only Sam, who didn't know better, brooding with folded
  arms, did not budge.</p>

  <p>"Sam!" said Mr. Elmer gently.</p>

  <p>"Was it fixed&mdash;that's what I want to know?" he demanded. "You just
  tell me that an' I'm through&mdash;tha's all!"</p>

  <p>"Sam!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elmer glanced significantly at the other men.</p>

  <p>"I don't care what anybody hears"&mdash;Sam was truculent, "was it
  arranged?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wasser&mdash;junior"&mdash;October's voice was like
  honey&mdash;"won't you run away? Mrs. Elmer wishes to be maternal!"</p>

  <p>He stared; Mrs. Elmer stiffened her back. Her nicest feelings were
  outraged.</p>

  <p>"Ain't that just like you, October, goin' puttin' the worst meanin' to
  everything!" She was her old shrill self. "After all Mr. Elmer done for you,
  an' me packin' your old trunks, you ought to be ashamed. Makin' a mock of
  things ..."</p>

  <p>Mr. Elmer heard the sound of strife and came into range; would have
  delivered his own views, which were formed by now, but October stopped
  him.</p>

  <p>"I want to tell everybody that I married of my own free will. Most of you
  know that, but it may be news to some."</p>

  <p>"Fixed!" Sam said this between his teeth.</p>

  <p>"I married him in preference to Sam Wasser&mdash;with my eyes open. Is
  that clear? And I do not regret the choice. I said once that one man is as
  good as another. That isn't true. Some men are much better than others. My
  husband, for example, is much better than Mr. Sam Wasser."</p>

  <p>She looked round for Red Beard; he had vanished. Robin would be waiting
  for her near the crossing. An idea came to her mind.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps there is an American gentleman here who will take me on a ride
  to&mdash;some place; I will tell him later."</p>

  <p>There were a dozen who would have offered their services. The night had
  begun on a more heroic level than it was ending. Worse than death is
  ridicule. Unless somebody could rescue the situation from the deeps in which
  it wallowed&mdash;</p>

  <p>Sam Wasser obliged nobly.</p>

  <p>"You're comin' back to Littleburg, that's what! You got a nerve! Think
  we're goin' to stand for you an' that dam' bum? Say, what do you know about
  that, fellers? You got to come back! Nobody's goin' to have the laugh on
  us."</p>

  <p>This decided the matter: the party returned to its heroic status. Nobody
  was going to have the laugh on them. She was a prisoner; October was
  horror-stricken. Not at the ignominy of her lot. Robin was alone. Of course,
  he had been alone before, but this time was different. She might never see
  him again. She went deathly cold at the thought. There was no question of
  love, but he was something definitely hers; he was indispensable. Why? She
  did not explain to herself. And he needed her. Why? She shook her head; but
  she was very certain.</p>

  <p>Red Beard? She strained her eyes toward the road. There were several men
  there, but Red Beard was not among them.</p>

  <p>"You've got to come back home with me and Mrs. Elmer to-night." Andrew was
  very gruff and surly. "Maybe to-morrow&mdash;well, that fool lawyer Pffiefer
  allowed he might fix you up at his home. Listen, October, you got to tell
  Mrs. Elmer&mdash;everything."</p>

  <p>"Does Littleburg want to know so badly?" she asked innocently.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Elmer, I said. She's a woman, October." This very soberly.</p>

  <p>"I didn't need that warning, Mr. Elmer," she said.</p>

  <p>The situation grew and continued very strained.</p>

  <p>That interminable journey! October curled up in one corner of the jiggitty
  old Ford, Mrs. Elmer in the other, the elder lady's lunch basket between them
  as a screen to trap contaminations.</p>

  <p>She woke from a doze as the machine struck the rotting cord road that led
  to Four Beeches Farm. The old room&mdash;unchanged. The infinitely ticking
  clock with faded roses painted on the dial. That damnably indifferent yellow
  cat curled up under the table. The house smelled stale! Worse than the earthy
  kitchen at the Swede's shack. There ought, by rights, to be a hook in the
  ceiling whereon a broken heart could make a swift and merciful transition to
  a land where tramp-like angels wander hand in hand through scented woods.</p>

  <p>Not love, it wasn't love. Hero worship!</p>

  <p>She fell into a paroxysm of laughter. Mrs. Elmer, tight lipped, hoped that
  this was the beginning of a breakdown.</p>

  <p>"You got a lot to laugh about!" Sam had come home with them. "You
  oughter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shush!" She waved him to oblivion. "Go home. You have no <i>locus
  standi</i>, Sam Wasser! You have no reason. As a prospective bridegroom you
  had one foot in the family. But now&mdash;!"</p>

  <p>Biting his lip in cogitation, Mr. Elmer had to agree in his mind that
  October was right. He was weary of Sam: Sam's loss, Sam's schemes of
  vengeance, Sam's leadership. A mere boy, too. October was crazy and
  ungrateful, no doubt, but right. Even Sam succumbed to her logic.</p>

  <p>"That lets me out," he said, hitching up his belt. "Don't suppose you an'
  me will be seein' one another&mdash;much. You go your way&mdash;I go mine.
  Yeh. I don't bear you any grudge, October. I'm leavin' Littleburg, goin' to
  Europe somewhere&mdash;but before I go I'd like to say this&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He never said it.</p>

  <p>"I know&mdash;I've read it. You forgive me; you hope I'll be
  happy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I wasn't going to say anything like that!" he protested indignantly.
  "Huh! Wastin' my time, tha's what! Ruined my life, 'n everything an' just
  stand there laughin'!"</p>

  <p>"I guess you'd better be getting along, Sam," said Mr. Elmer. He opened
  the door. Sam shrugged his thin shoulders, snapped his fingers jazz-fashion
  and retired. Halfway to the forks he remembered a smart answer he might have
  returned when she handed him locus standi&mdash;Sam had Latin of his own.</p>

  <p>An awkward silence followed his departure. October occupied the rocker;
  Mrs. Elmer, arms tightly clasped across her middle, looked at her husband.
  Andrew, his mind on the Farmers' Convention, turned up the light of the big
  shaded kerosene lamp with the carefulness and concentration of one who wished
  to be spared any other duty. Lena, the Swedish cook, tiptoed into the room,
  with a tray on which a large silver coffeepot was conspicuous. She set the
  cups noiselessly. Nobody had the courage to tell her to go away. Lena tiptoed
  out; she felt that she had compromised on the fatted calf.</p>

  <p>Half-heartedly Mrs. Elmer poured out the coffee.</p>

  <p>"Your room's just about straight," she said. "I don't know what I'll say
  to folks, I'm sure."</p>

  <p>She handed a cup to October with a gesture of disparagement. October
  sipped the hot fluid thoughtfully. Perhaps it wasn't true about the guard at
  the railway crossing. A lie would come naturally to Red Beard, and Robin was
  cautious&mdash;he was almost like one of the wild creatures of the forest. He
  could see things in the dark, things invisible to her. So the Swede hanged
  himself on the hook after all. It was nothing to smile about, but she smiled,
  and Mrs. Elmer, who watched her every expression, felt her anger rising.</p>

  <p>"Glad you can grin, October! I guess Mr. Elmer and me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Grinning&mdash;was I?" She was almost penitent; Mrs. Elmer had never seen
  her that way before. "I'm sorry; I was thinking of&mdash;entirely different
  things. I suppose I must stay here? Couldn't I have a room at Littleburg
  House?"</p>

  <p>A suggestion on which Mr. Elmer had very emphatic views.</p>

  <p>"Littleburg House&mdash;who's payin' for a suite at Littleburg House,
  October? You got no money to pay. Littleburg House!"</p>

  <p>It was the first intimation of her penury. In many ways this was the most
  informative statement Andrew Elmer had ever made.</p>

  <p>"Oh! Is that so?" She nearly added "Lenny."</p>

  <p>"That's so," said Mr. Elmer, unconsciously in the character of the fat
  little man who threw knives.</p>

  <p>There was a knocking at the door. Husband and wife exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"If it's Sam tell him to come in the morning," snarled Mr. Elmer.</p>

  <p>She disappeared. The door of the parlour was sturdy enough to exclude any
  sound lower than a shout. To and fro October rocked, her cheek on her palm.
  Over the back of a chair her tattered, bark-torn coat was hanging: it was
  lovely to see. Almost every stain and rent could be identified with some
  stage of her&mdash;of their adventure.</p>

  <p>The door opened slowly. Mrs. Elmer came in, her parlour smile advertised
  the social importance of the caller.</p>

  <p>"Just step in, mister."</p>

  <p>Mister came at her heels. A tall man in evening dress. His soft white
  shirt was like snow, his black tie was most correct; his trousers were an
  inch too short, and a gap of shirt showed between his waistcoat and the top
  of his trousers.</p>

  <p>He had a stubbly moustache and side whiskers, and a pair of horn-rimmed
  pince-nez, a little askew, was on his nose.</p>

  <p>"Captain Sullivan, Department of Justice," he gruffly introduced himself.
  "Is this the young lady?"</p>

  <p>As he indicated October, four inches of shirt-cuff shot out. The sleeves
  of his coat were a little short.</p>

  <p>October gazed, fascinated. Mr. Elmer stopped talking to himself and
  stared.</p>

  <p>"I came by special&mdash;from Washington," said Captain Sullivan. "Young
  lady, you're under arrest!"</p>

  <p>October nodded. She had no questions to ask.</p>

  <p>"Get your coat&mdash;have you any food in the house?" This to Mrs. Elmer.
  The lady nodded; the right words would not come.</p>

  <p>"Cheese, bread, biscuits." Captain Sullivan's eyes fell on the coffeepot.
  "Coffee. We have a long journey."</p>

  <p>"Under arrest?" Mr. Elmer found his voice.</p>

  <p>"Under arrest," said Captain Sullivan of the Department of Justice
  solemnly. "Contravention of Section twenty-nine."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Elmer vanished into the kitchen. She returned in a remarkably short
  space of time with a basket loaded with odd things.</p>

  <p>"Have you a bottle&mdash;a large bottle?"</p>

  <p>She nodded dumbly, returned from the kitchen with a bottle&mdash;a large
  bottle. Gravely Captain Sullivan half filled it from the coffeepot; added
  milk. He took two large handfuls of sugar and put them into the pocket of his
  coat. His gravity was almost depressing.</p>

  <p>"Arrested? Say, arrested?" asked Mr. Elmer.</p>

  <p>Captain Sullivan regarded him severely for the space of a second, then he
  took up the coat that was hanging over the chair.</p>

  <p>"Yours?"</p>

  <p>October nodded. She was on her feet now.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, and took two cups from the table. He had the bottle in
  one hand, the basket in the other; an apple fell out: he stopped and picked
  it up.</p>

  <p>"Screak!"</p>

  <p>A back seam of the jacket parted under the strain and a white slither of
  shirt showed.</p>

  <p>October went obediently, meekly. Outside the gate stood a car, its engine
  running. "Chug, chug, CHUG!" Every third chug was more explosive than its
  fellows. She scrambled into a machine which was without dignity.</p>

  <p>"Say, Captain, that's a pretty poor kind of flivver for a long journey!"
  Mr. Elmer had followed them to the gate.</p>

  <p>"It is disguised," said the captain coldly. "We always disguise."</p>

  <p>The car rattled wheezily through Littleburg and came again to the
  well-remembered road. October sighed luxuriously.</p>

  <p>"I think you're wonderful!" she breathed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9"
     name="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

  <p class="first">SOME forty miles away a distracted and wrathful young man
  was telephoning to the police.</p>

  <p>"... a brown leather valise. R. T. on both sides.... Eh? I told
  you&mdash;hours ago I told you. Listen, write it down, will you: a brown
  leather valise. It was strapped on the back of my machine. It had an evening
  dress suit, safety-razor outfit, and&mdash;well, the usual fixings. And a
  suit of pajamas."</p>

  <p>Robin grew conversational as the car jogged along.</p>

  <p>"The pajamas were rather superfluous&mdash;I chucked them into a field.
  I'm sorry now; you could have worn the pants as a scarf. And that
  razor&mdash;my heavens, it hurt!"</p>

  <p>The car had been gathered from the parking place near the camp fire. It
  was the end machine&mdash;nobody had seen it go. The youth of Littleburg had
  a sort of communal interest in cars. Ed borrowed Joe's when things went wrong
  without so much as by your leave. The owner was possibly sleeping at that
  moment without a single uneasy dream of loss.</p>

  <p>"But the shaving&mdash;cold water and no glass, and this face of
  mine!"</p>

  <p>"Did you see me taken away?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"From the Boy Scouts&mdash;yes. As a matter of fact, you passed me. What
  really happened?"</p>

  <p>She told him about Red Beard, but this was no news to him. He had seen Red
  Beard.</p>

  <p>"I guessed that you had gone in the wrong direction when I didn't see you.
  I stopped to loot the valise. I'm wearing silk undies&mdash;I feel
  royal!"</p>

  <p>She asked nothing. When they came to the side road where the valise had
  been acquired he turned down. As they passed the house where the wronged
  owner of a good dress suit was expressing his views about the police and
  police methods, he waved a silent salute to the author of his comfort.</p>

  <p>Red Beard had only half lied. At the crossing was a sentinel with a gun
  under his arm. As they passed he shouted:</p>

  <p>"You haven't seen ..."</p>

  <p>The rest of the sentence was inaudible.</p>

  <p>"Good-night!" roared Robin as they bumped across the track.</p>

  <p>"I could have wished something less conspicuous than a dress suit," he
  said, "but finders can't choose. And I feel like the Prince of Wales.
  Besides, as we're doing our walking by night the costume is appropriate. You
  weren't frightened when I appeared?"</p>

  <p>"I knew you&mdash;of course I knew you," she scoffed.</p>

  <p>"I thought you would&mdash;Hullo!" He jerked his head round to look
  back.</p>

  <p>"What was it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A man lying beside the road&mdash;hiding, I think. You don't know which
  way Reddy went after he left the Wolf Cubs?"</p>

  <p>She had not seen his going. Robin considered all the possibilities.</p>

  <p>"He guessed I was making for the railway," he said at last. "Perhaps he
  thought I had already gone on. I wonder what Elfleda thinks about it
  all&mdash;and Gussie!"</p>

  <p>She could advance no postulation.</p>

  <p>"Looks like a crossroad ahead," he said. "Suppose we turn down, shut off
  the lights, and eat. I had to abandon the grub and I'm starving."</p>

  <p>The crossroad was, it seemed, the main road, not a spot for lingering. A
  few miles along this highway they found a likely lane and a suitable halting
  ground. There was a glow in the western sky&mdash;faint but distinguishable.
  He suspected the presence of a large town or a big factory of some kind.</p>

  <p>"Ogdensburg can't be very far away," he said as he uncorked the
  bottle.</p>

  <p>She was not very hungry but she ate to keep him in countenance.</p>

  <p>"If we could hide the car you could sleep in it," he said. "There is a
  skin blanket of some kind in the back. I'd give a thousand pounds for a line
  to the habits and customs of the local tribe! There must be any number of old
  barns that nobody ever looks into. You knew me, eh? Spotted me the moment I
  pranced into the parlour?"</p>

  <p>He seemed pleased at this and reverted to her recognition again.</p>

  <p>"Elmer will go to the police, of course. He was suspicious at the last.
  Elfleda wots well my habits; I wonder if Gussie is wise?"</p>

  <p>"In what respect?"</p>

  <p>"About my knowing."</p>

  <p>She put down the cup from which she had been drinking.</p>

  <p>"What is your crime?" she asked. "I know that you are a burglar and a car
  thief, but what have you done that is <i>seriously</i> wrong?"</p>

  <p>And when he laughed:</p>

  <p>"No, really. Have you stolen his wife?" It was strange to her that she
  found a difficulty in putting the doubt into words. "Have you?"</p>

  <p>"God forbid!" he said piously. "Gussie's wife doesn't live with him.
  Either she couldn't stand Gussie, or, what is more likely, his mother."</p>

  <p>"Is that Elfleda&mdash;the woman with the nose?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"She <i>has</i> a nose, yes. Georgina is Gussie's ma. She is really the
  queen pippin of the Things That Cannot Be. But what a woman to hounds! I saw
  her take Bellamy Gap in the Quorn country&mdash;nobody has taken that jump
  since old Fralenhough broke his neck in '63. What an old sport!"</p>

  <p>She was confounded.</p>

  <p>"But I thought she was unpleasant. Wasn't Elfleda rather&mdash;awful!"</p>

  <p>"Terrible!" he said solemnly. "Do you remember the low-down trick she
  played on Athewold when she came in all dressed up to see the king?"</p>

  <p>"I <i>don't</i> remember!" October's tone was sharper than usual, but he
  was very disarming.</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you all about it some day," he said. "I'm a whale on Saxon
  history. Now to find a castle of refuge!"</p>

  <p>He got down and cranked up the car; they rattled on for a mile or so and
  reached a three-way fork. He took the centre way and they came presently to a
  gaunt-looking building, very square and ugly, that stood within a few yards
  of the road. The wire fence that indicated the boundary was sagging and in
  places missing. One of the finds he made when he searched the car was an
  electric torch, and with this in his hand he went exploring.</p>

  <p>The foreground was littered with iron barrels. Rank grass grew through and
  about the debris. There, in the neglect and desolation, was unmistakable
  evidence of ruin. He saw that the window glass was broken; on the black door
  that was squarely in the middle of the building was a half-obliterated tramp
  sign written with chalk. He puzzled over this sign for a time; it might be a
  private signature revealing the identity of the writer, or a piece of general
  information. Was it "not safe"?</p>

  <p>Picking his way carefully through the rubbish, he rounded a corner of the
  building and continued. At the far end he came upon a one-story annex built
  onto the main structure. He could imagine this had once been an office of the
  long-departed occupants. There was a small door and he tried this, never
  expecting that it would open. To his surprise, it yielded readily&mdash;too
  readily: somebody was pulling from the inside, and he stepped back quickly,
  pulling the gun from his pocket.</p>

  <p>In the light of his lamp he recognized the old man he had seen near the
  Swede's house on the night of the wedding. The old fellow knitted his
  brows.</p>

  <p>"Seen you before, ain't I, bo?"</p>

  <p>He spoke in an undertone, as though he were afraid of disturbing
  somebody.</p>

  <p>"Me and O. was pulled off by a bull," he whispered, "so we hit the
  ties."</p>

  <p>The old man looked back into the room and stepped out, closing the door
  very gently.</p>

  <p>"My mistake entirely." Again the voice was like that of an educated
  man.</p>

  <p>"Canadian," said Robin's trained ear.</p>

  <p>"I did not see you well. The light&mdash;disconcerting. Hum!"</p>

  <p>He peered forward shortsightedly.</p>

  <p>"Hum! I see you have dressed for dinner. The fashion has changed
  considerably. A soft shirt, for example, was regarded
  as&mdash;er&mdash;declasse."</p>

  <p>His grimy hand felt the texture of the tuxedo.</p>

  <p>"It is rather interesting." He shook his bald head. "Let me see&mdash;it
  was in 'ninety or a little later that Hast&mdash;hum!"</p>

  <p>Robin was startled alike by the accent and the substance of the old man's
  speech.</p>

  <p>"It was before the trouble with Julia," said the old gentleman,
  reminiscent, "and long before the Apparition. That came to me in Santa
  Barbara, or possibly it was Sacramento, in&mdash;I cannot tell you the date.
  I treated my wife very badly. Julia was an instrument of divine justice."</p>

  <p>He spoke pleasantly in the way of an old man retailing his reminiscences.
  He had been a professor of anatomy at a great American university, he
  remarked casually&mdash;before the trouble with Julia and long before the
  Apparition and Him.</p>

  <p>The old man nodded toward the door.</p>

  <p>"He thinks I am mad because of the Appearance. I have tried to explain
  that I have gifts not vouchsafed to every man. But I can sympathize with a
  skeptic. I should have laughed, twenty, thirty years ago&mdash;hum!"</p>

  <p>Robin thought it was time to ask vital questions.</p>

  <p>"A car? Let me think!" The old man smoothed his shiny pate. "There is a
  shed behind&mdash;nobody comes to the studio as they call it. It was occupied
  by a moving picture&mdash;er&mdash;maker. I know little about such matters. I
  am glad you came."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"I am glad you came," repeated the old man. "The Apparition. I am not sure
  that I understood her. She is usually so explicit. But
  to-night&mdash;nebulous, indefinite. Naturally, one would not like to fall
  into error. Was it not perhaps that my own sense of personal grievance ... He
  gave me rather a bad beating up. Look!"</p>

  <p>He pointed to his mouth; it was swollen and cut.</p>

  <p>"Is this somebody you are travelling with?"</p>

  <p>The ancient nodded seriously.</p>

  <p>"His name I do not know. Harry the Valet, they call him." He glanced
  nervously at the door. "I will show you the shed," he said, and went ahead.
  "We have been together for eight years&mdash;longer, perhaps. I find him
  useful. But he is very cruel ... hum!"</p>

  <p>The "shed" was a lean-to, but if, as the old man said, this disused studio
  was a place that nobody visited, the shelter was on the side of the building
  where it was least likely to be observed.</p>

  <p>"This is a favourite 'sleep' for the confraternity." The visitor gathered
  what he meant. "But I am afraid we have the best place. But of course you
  would not wish to sleep here?"</p>

  <p>Robin broke it to him that he would, and the old man did not seem
  surprised.</p>

  <p>"Are you alone? No? There is a store in a corner of the lot. I have not
  been there myself, but I understand that it is comfortable in dry
  weather."</p>

  <p>He would have shown the way, but Robin declined his assistance and they
  returned to the front of the one-story building to find that "he" was waiting
  in the open for him. A giant, almost a head taller than Robin.</p>

  <p>"Hey! What's this, Jesse, what'n hell's the big idea? Leavin' the door
  open, you little&mdash;"</p>

  <p>His language was not delicate. Robin showed his lamp on to the ground. It
  gave enough light to inspect the man. Poorly but not uncomfortably dressed,
  well fed, burly&mdash;there all that could be said favourably of his
  appearance finished. If anything, he was less prepossessing than he had been
  on the night of their introduction.</p>

  <p>The old man addressed him as "O.," and was pitifully anxious to propitiate
  him.</p>

  <p>"Get in and make that bed again, you little runt!" He lifted his foot; the
  bald old man dodged the kick with remarkable agility.</p>

  <p>In the light O. had seen the white expanse of dress shirt and anticipated
  largesse. Robin understood that he was not recognized.</p>

  <p>"That old guy's nutty&mdash;don't take notice of him. He sees spooks. Got
  the makin's on you? Well, have you got a dollar ... quarter? Me an' him ain't
  had no food in days."</p>

  <p>It was the moment to put O. right. Robin explained.</p>

  <p>"Sleepin' here? You're crazy. Anyway, there's no room." The note of
  deference was gone from his voice. "What's the idea?"</p>

  <p>"I'm staying here, that's all," said Robin shortly and turned away.</p>

  <p>He expected the man to follow, but he made no movement. Very briefly he
  explained to October what the position was.</p>

  <p>"I don't think we can get the car much farther," he said. "The tank is
  nearly empty, but I may be able to swipe a tin to-morrow."</p>

  <p>He drove the car over the ruts and furrows, surmounted mysterious heaps of
  refuse, and backed it into the shelter. Then they went in search of the
  corner store. It was a small windowless building that had evidently been used
  as a sleeping place before. Door there was none; the floor was bare, not even
  a sack had been left. The one-time whitewashed walls were covered with
  pencilled inscriptions by former occupants. Some of them were translatable
  and others unprintable. There were also drawings, but he dropped his light
  quickly from these.</p>

  <p>"You had better try the floor," he said, and laid the cushions and rug he
  had brought from the car in one corner.</p>

  <p>He heard her whisper and, looking up, saw the giant form of O. silhouetted
  in the doorway. Robin walked out of the hut.</p>

  <p>"Want anything?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Who's the skirt?"</p>

  <p>Robin's light flashed full on the animal face of the man, who shaded his
  eyes and saw the gun in Robin's other hand.</p>

  <p>"Go back where you belong."</p>

  <p>"Hi! hi! what's matter with you!"</p>

  <p>"Get!"</p>

  <p>The big man shambled off into the darkness; his curses came back with
  undesirable clearness.</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>"O.," said Robin laconically. "Or 'nought'&mdash;he's nothing."</p>

  <p>One cushion sufficed him. He planted it in the doorway, pulled a rubber
  sheet round him and, with his back to the wall, dozed. It was a long time
  before October fell into a fitful sleep. She must have awakened a dozen
  times, but whenever she turned or stretched she saw a movement at the door
  and knew that he was awake. Finally she sat up, pushed back her hair, and
  yawned.</p>

  <p>"Did it waken you?" asked the voice from the doorway.</p>

  <p>"It? What was it? I heard nothing."</p>

  <p>"Poor little Baldy is getting a beating&mdash;for two cents I'd go
  over."</p>

  <p>What he meant, as she knew, was that, but for the necessity of guarding
  her sleep, he would have gone.</p>

  <p>She yawned, got up on her feet, pulling on her shoes, and joined him. His
  head was bent, listening. From somewhere in the grounds came the sound of
  weeping, a thin, weak crying like a child's.</p>

  <p>"Poor old Baldy!" he said softly.</p>

  <p>She asked him who he meant and he told her of the old man called
  "Jesse."</p>

  <p>"I suspect he is a slave. Some of the old hands have these poor devils to
  fetch and carry for them. Baldy is one such."</p>

  <p>He told her nothing of Julia or the Apparition or the great university
  where Baldy had lectured to students who were now great doctors driving in
  their pretentious limousines. The tale was harrowing enough, and he was not
  past being harrowed himself.</p>

  <p>The weeping ceased. She brought her blanket, put it round her shoulders,
  and sat with him. He had had "forty winks," he said, and anyway he did not
  require much sleep, boasting that he had once kept awake for three days and
  nights.</p>

  <p>"Where was this?" she asked, and he answered vaguely that it was in
  Europe, and did not think it worth while explaining that an intensive enemy
  bombardment of his trench had been a contributory cause to his
  wakefulness.</p>

  <p>Just as the first pale light came into the east they heard another cry. An
  "Ow!" hoarse and startling. Nothing followed. Robin moved uneasily. He could
  see the angle of the building now&mdash;the after side of the office. Then he
  rose.</p>

  <p>"I really must go over, I am afraid," he said. "Do you mind? You will be
  quite safe here."</p>

  <p>"Shall I come with you?"</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Yes, perhaps it would be better."</p>

  <p>The morning was chilly; he helped her into the beloved coat and they
  stepped out side by side. In the cold light of dawn he had a remarkable
  appearance. He had taken off the stiff collar and tie, and the shirt was
  unbuttoned at the neck. There were four inches of shirt showing between the
  rumpled-up waistcoat and trousers that were built for a slighter man. The
  sleeves had worked up until the cuffs seemed to be in the region of his
  elbows. Intercepting her amused glance, he chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I look funny, don't I? Like a comedy waiter. Some day I'll take off the
  rest of my venerable beard and then I'll give you leave to laugh!"</p>

  <p>They rounded the corner and stopped before the door, listening. No sound
  came from inside the "office." He motioned her back and pushed the door
  gently. As it opened a little he listened again. Sharp as his ears were, he
  could detect no sound of breathing. The atmosphere was thick. He made a
  grimace and moved the door wide open.</p>

  <p>Still no sound. He could have switched on the light, but he did not wish
  to disturb them&mdash;they must sleep soundly if fresh air did not rouse
  their shivering protests. The room was inkily dark. He took one cautious
  step, and then his foot slipped on something and he lost his balance. Down he
  came sprawling.</p>

  <p>It was soft and wet. His hands were covered with a warm, sticky fluid. Up
  to his feet he came in a second and flashed down the lamp, on the face of the
  man called "O." He looked, petrified with horror, then his lamp searched for
  Jesse, who was once a professor of anatomy and saw Apparitions. The old man
  was not there.</p>

  <p>Robin stooped and wiped his hand on the man's coat, then he backed out.
  October was waiting, a dim figure in the gray dimness.</p>

  <p>"Was he&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>Then she saw the white shirt front.</p>

  <p>"Blood!" she whispered. "Is the old man hurt?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The other&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Dead&mdash;sorry."</p>

  <p>He sent the light round its limited range. There was no sign of the old
  man who spoke such good English. Perhaps he was already with the Apparition
  that came to him some nights and leered and pointed him his duty.</p>

  <p>They went back to the little store and gathered rug and cushions.</p>

  <p>"We must get away from here&mdash;quick," he said, carrying the equipment
  to the car. "The poor old beggar! Professor of anatomy! I should say so!"</p>

  <p>When he cranked up the car the noise of it sounded deafening. Nobody could
  live on the earth and not hear it.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how far we can run on a quart of gas," he said, "but we'll
  go as far as we can."</p>

  <p>They came out onto the road and turned in the direction they had been
  heading when the car had stopped before the studio. The light was still
  faint&mdash;hardly distinguishable from night. Patches of white mist lay in
  the hollows, and when they descended a sharp dip they ran into a fog that
  continued a surprising time.</p>

  <p>Now they were climbing a road that was cut in the side of a bare hill. The
  engines began to make spluttering noises, the machine went on in jerks. Near
  to the top they went dead. He pulled the brake, and, getting down, walked to
  the crest. From here the road ran gently downhill.</p>

  <p>He came back and told her, and together, with great labour, they pushed
  the machine to the far side of the ridge. Here they sat down and regained
  their breath.</p>

  <p>"Can't you take off your shirt?" she asked anxiously. "It
  is&mdash;dreadful! And your hands ..."</p>

  <p>She looked round for water but there was no spring here.</p>

  <p>"Couldn't I buy you some clothes?" she asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>He put his hand in his pocket and when he withdrew it she saw two quarters
  on his palm.</p>

  <p>"Buy me anything up to fifty cents," he said.</p>

  <p>She had no money. Her wrist watch might have a selling value, but it could
  not be a high one.</p>

  <p>"Great Moses!"</p>

  <p>She followed the direction of his startled eyes. He was looking backward:
  the hill commanded a view of the road along which they had come. Big white
  billows of smoke were rising from the studio; she saw the red and yellow
  flames lick up and vanish.</p>

  <p>"On fire&mdash;he did it, the old hero!"</p>

  <p>She knew that he was talking of Baldy. Then his face fell.</p>

  <p>"That is going to call together all the police in miles," he said, "and
  they will find O.&mdash;both parts of him."</p>

  <p>Without another word he stripped off coat and shirt. Underneath was the
  silk which made him feel royal. He made a bundle of waistcoat and shirt,
  looked longingly at the gasoline tank, and finally stuffed them under one of
  the back cushions.</p>

  <p>"Let us glide," he said.</p>

  <p>The car went smoothly downhill. He might have got a movement for his
  engine, but he was reserving this for a final run on the level.</p>

  <p>"You must be dreadfully cold&mdash;have the rug around your shoulders,"
  said October, but though he was shivering he refused the offer.</p>

  <p>There was a little township ahead of them. The inevitable farm truck
  appeared in the road. Robin made a signal and the driver, a sleepy and
  disgruntled youth, stopped.</p>

  <p>"Sure I've got gas ..."</p>

  <p>Robin bargained and lied. He had a manner with him that combined hauteur
  and good humour. He sought for the young man's weak spot and found it..</p>

  <p>"This young lady is my daughter&mdash;she's rushing to meet the 6.15.
  Queer thing is that I came along without my wallet&mdash;look!"</p>

  <p>Fifty cents displayed upon a broad palm look very few cents.</p>

  <p>"That's not enough for a can," said the young man, one eye on October.
  "I'd get fired&mdash;yes, sir. Still&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He had a can that was near full. The exchange was effected.</p>

  <p>"Where you from? Not Littleburg? Say, they caught that Willie last night
  an' shot him up, yes, sir. Over by Murphy's Corner, you know. He poisoned a
  feller an' got his wife away&mdash;she's dead too."</p>

  <p>"Glory be!" said Robin. "I must tell her&mdash;I must tell my
  daughter."</p>

  <p>A few miles farther along a motor fire engine came rocking past, smothered
  with dust.</p>

  <p>"We are getting near to progress," said Robin. "This is where we go very
  slow."</p>

  <p>He had hardly spoken before he heard the hideous shriek of a motor horn
  behind. He thought it was the fire float and took no notice. Again the angry
  yelp. Looking back, he saw a car and, drawing in to the side, waved it
  on.</p>

  <p>"It's very early for traffic&mdash;" he began, and then the car drew
  abreast and passed. The man at the wheel was little-featured and wore a
  monocle. From the heap of furs by his side protruded the dead white face of a
  lady with a large Roman nose. For a second their eyes met. She spoke to the
  man at her side and he half turned his head, straightened it again, and
  swerved before the little machine.</p>

  <p>"What a nerve!" said Robin Leslie Beausere.</p>

  <p>It was all over in two seconds, the exchange of glances, the passing. The
  machine ahead accelerated, became a dim form showing between rolling clouds
  of dust, and was gone.</p>

  <p>"Elfleda! "said October.</p>

  <p>"And Gussie. So they found the car. I am very glad. I'd hate to lose
  it."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in blank amazement.</p>

  <p>"But it isn't your car."</p>

  <p>"In a sense and for the time being it isn't," he said carefully, "but it
  will be!"</p>

  <p>At the next fork he stopped and examined the wheel tracks. The
  diamond-pattern tires had gone due north; he took the westerly road and was
  sorry. So many were the houses hereabouts that he guessed he was approaching
  the suburbs of a large town. There were cars and people on the
  road&mdash;people who were interested in a man dressed simply in a tuxedo and
  silk vest. And the gasoline was running low. A garage was opening, and he
  stopped the car before its doors. But the man who was opening up was an
  assistant and had no authority to loan gasoline.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to buy this handsome runabout?" blandly.</p>

  <p>The garage hand regarded this suggestion as a humourless joke and went
  sour on it. Then he said something.</p>

  <p>"Cut yourself, ain't you?"</p>

  <p>He was looking curiously at Robin's hand.</p>

  <p>"Could you drive a machine like that and not cut yourself?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>October came to the rescue.</p>

  <p>"My uncle has left home without money and we have to get on to Ogdensburg.
  Would you loan us some gasoline if I left my watch with you&mdash;or would
  you buy it?"</p>

  <p>The garage man took the watch and smiled cleverly. He was not, said the
  smile, the kind of man who would fall for fake jewellery. With disparagement
  written large upon his homely face bearing relics of yesterday's toil, he
  weighed the little gold timepiece in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Worth about a dollar, I guess?" he said. "You can buy 'um cheaper, but a
  dollar'd be fair."</p>

  <p>The watch had cost a hundred and fifty dollars a year before.</p>

  <p>"Make it ten," said October courageously.</p>

  <p>The young man half shook his head. He had a girl for whose birthday he had
  designed an expensive present&mdash;and an expensive present is one that is
  just a little more than you can afford. And it was a nice watch. It had been
  worn and yet remained gold.</p>

  <p>"Five dollars is all that I could give you for that watch."</p>

  <p>A brilliant idea came to October.</p>

  <p>"You shall have that little watch for three dollars and a suit of
  clothes," she said, with solemn earnestness.</p>

  <p>He was staggered, but the bargaining faculties of the man were stirred. He
  had a suit, a very old suit.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" he said.</p>

  <p>Near to the garage was the tiniest wooden house she had ever seen. It
  looked to be rather a large tool chest, yet into this he disappeared. When he
  came out garments were hanging over his arm. October took them one by one and
  examined them critically.</p>

  <p>"They're not Savile Row, are they?" she asked, and he, who had taken a
  correspondence course in the French language, thought she had introduced a
  foreign idiom and answered "Oui."</p>

  <p>With one dollar's worth of gasoline in the tank, two greasy bills in her
  hand, and the suit neatly folded on the back seat, the machine sped on its
  way.</p>

  <p>"He's very slight, not to say skinny," said Robin ominously. "I'm going to
  bulge!"</p>

  <p>They were now in a more sparsely peopled country; farms were fewer, there
  were clumps of trees and fast-running little streams. They followed the
  course of one of these until they came to a wooded glen.</p>

  <p>He had abandoned food and covering but had held fast to soap and
  towel&mdash;she had discovered this the night before, when the sugar with
  which he sweetened her coffee had imparted a faintly soapy flavour to an
  otherwise perfect refreshment.</p>

  <p>"You go first," he said, and produced the towel with a flourish.</p>

  <p>Climbing down the steep bank to the stream, she made a hurried toilet and
  returned him apologetically a very damp towel. He had, he gravely informed
  her, a shirt. He used this to dry himself, washed the shirt in the stream,
  and applied to his cheeks the safety razor. It was a groaning
  performance.</p>

  <p>There came back to her a smart, youngish man with a moustache the ends of
  which had been soaped and twisted into spiky points. The vividly brown suit
  showed signs of wear and tear, but in many ways it fitted him better than the
  dress clothes he had abandoned. The crumpled dress collar had been
  straightened out, the black dress tie gave him an air of respectability.</p>

  <p>"You look," October summed up, "rather like a drummer who is travelling in
  a snappy line of funeral fixings."</p>

  <p>The shirt was spread on the engine to dry while they made a hasty meal and
  held a council of war. O.'s death had complicated matters, he said. The
  certain circulation of particulars and number of the stolen car, the
  appearance of Captain Sullivan at Four Beeches Farm in a borrowed dress suit,
  and that swift recognition of Elfleda's were all bad enough. What would
  follow the discovery at the studio would be worse.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear man, they can't say that you killed this wretched bully!"
  she protested.</p>

  <p>They could and they might, he argued. He had been seen coming from the
  direction of the fire; the garage man had noted the blood on his hands.</p>

  <p>"My only hope is Elfleda&mdash;she's clever," he said, and she was
  speechless with astonishment.</p>

  <p>"But&mdash;I thought she would have you arrested if she could? I
  understood that. Doesn't she hate you?"</p>

  <p>He nodded, but did not reply, for his mouth was occupied with the half of
  a large apple.</p>

  <p>"She loathes me!" he said. "But the last thing she wishes is my arrest.
  Elfleda would strip her rings from her fingers, her diamonds from her ears,
  her king's-ransom pearls from her neck to prevent my arrest! That is her big
  worry. She will never forgive me for coming into the public eye. If you could
  get inside Elfleda's soul you would find it like a tossing sea of despair.
  Poor old Elfleda!"</p>

  <p>October settled back in a corner of the car and moaned.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand! What is the mystery? First you make me think that
  this wretched woman hates you, then you tell me she would sell her
  jewels&mdash;as I have done&mdash;to save you. Then you call her 'poor old
  Elfleda' as though she were your dearest friend!"</p>

  <p>"I'm naturally mysterious," he said modestly, but became serious
  immediately. "The point is this: we're marked, and the car marks us. I don't
  know whether its lawful owner has already interviewed the police&mdash;it is
  rather early. But that risk can only be delayed a short while. Every garage
  will be notified and our friend whose wardrobe I am representing is certain
  to betray us. The only hope in that direction is that he doesn't disclose the
  fact that he swapped clothes for your watch. Probably he won't. He will think
  that the watch has been stolen, and that if he tells the truth he will lose
  watch, dollars, and suiting. He will say that we filled up and went on."</p>

  <p>"What shall we do with the machine?" she asked, impressed by his
  logic.</p>

  <p>"Leave it&mdash;not here but near some township. You will have to leave
  your coat, too, I am afraid. That is positively trampish."</p>

  <p>He recovered his shirt. It was dry&mdash;in places. There were even yellow
  scorch marks. October made a suggestion. A thin branch of alder was broken
  off, and to its end the shirt was tied by its sleeves. There was hardly
  enough wind to stir the linen, but when the car started and the breeze caught
  the fluttering thing, it billowed out like an obese and shapeless
  sausage.</p>

  <p>"An emblem of surrender and slightly conspicuous," said Robin, glancing
  up, "but ingenious."</p>

  <p>Fortunately the road was deserted, and the only man who saw this strange
  banner found a perfectly natural explanation for its presence. They had to
  strike their banner once for a farmer's car, but by the time they came to the
  really dense traffic the shirt was dry. And they came up to the "dense
  traffic" unexpectedly at the first crossroad&mdash;two buggies, several
  Fords, a little trolley crowded with young men and maidens in festal garb,
  and a motor wagon with an oddly uniformed band. They were all in sight when
  the machine, panting huskily, struggled over the top of a long steep
  hill.</p>

  <p>"They are going to the Farmers' Convention!" said the girl, suddenly
  remembering.</p>

  <p>Apparently the Convention was an affair of some importance.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Elmer was president or something."</p>

  <p>She wasn't quite sure that she knew the name of the town where the
  Convention was to be held, but she had heard that it was an occasion for
  hectic gaieties. Mr. and Mrs. Elmer often talked about a lady who swallowed
  swords and a gentleman who put his head in a lion's mouth. In their artless
  admiration of these feats of daring they were almost human.</p>

  <p>All this October related as they made their slow progress to the
  intersecting road. Robin made up his mind quickly. Not to be going to the
  Convention would be, in the eyes of numerous travellers, both odd and
  noticeable. The best way to avoid attention was to drift with the stream. He
  turned with the tide, planted himself between a dilapidated joy wagon and a
  slow-moving and heavily loaded Ford, and kept his position.</p>

  <p>The gaiety of the Convention came out to meet them&mdash;booths where
  young men were eating quickly but solemnly; a little group of heads bent in a
  motionless mob about a top-hatted man who was performing some miracle in the
  centre; another and larger group gathered round a small rostrum on which a
  bareheaded gentleman wearing a polka-dot waistcoat and frock coat held a
  large pink-filled bottle in one hand and gesticulated with the other.</p>

  <p>"We'll back in here," said Robin.</p>

  <p>They had reached the centre of the town; motor vehicles in every stage of
  beauty or decrepitude were parked at an angle to the sidewalk.</p>

  <p>"Every town in the United States should have its name painted up in
  letters a mile high," said Robin as he got down. "We'll leave this bad baby
  here&mdash;I don't know a better place than a car park. Now where can I leave
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Leave me?" she repeated in dismay.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I want clothes for us both, a new machine, and information," he said,
  "and I shall get all these best if I work alone. By the way, I suppose you
  have never picked a pocket? That's a pity. I'm rather clumsy with my hands.
  We'll have to try another way."</p>

  <p>He left her outside the drug store with strict injunctions that she was
  not to move until he returned, and was soon lost to sight in the crowd. She
  stood for a long time watching the people. Immediately opposite where she
  stood was a big square building with a red shingled roof. Across its
  clapboard front in letters gilt and Gothic were the words "Astor House." It
  was presumably the principal hotel, for on the narrow veranda was a line of
  chairs, occupied by shirt-sleeved men.</p>

  <p>As she was looking a long-bodied touring car drew up before the doors. It
  was covered with dust so that it was difficult to distinguish its colour, but
  the shape was familiar. It was the car that had passed them on the descent
  from the hill! More, it was the identical machine that she and Robin had left
  in the quarry forest. But the woman with the Roman nose was not one of its
  three passengers, nor did the monocled man Loamer sit at the wheel.</p>

  <p>First to descend was the passenger who had lolled at his ease behind.</p>

  <p>Sam Wasser!</p>

  <p>Spellbound, she stood watching.</p>

  <p>"That's the machine&mdash;English. Some flivver, but gimme my old
  Overland!"</p>

  <p>Behind her two men who had come out of the drug store were talking.</p>

  <p>"She's been to Littleburg an' back 'n two hours. That's going some. But
  she <i>eats</i> juice&mdash;eats it."</p>

  <p>The car had been sent back to Littleburg to pick up Sam. Why?</p>

  <p>Let Lady Georgina Loamer supply the explanation.</p>

  <p>She received her guest in a sitting room which until that morning had been
  a bedroom and which became an integral part of suite A by the simple process
  of removing a bed, substituting a writing table, and opening a door that
  communicated with a bedroom in which no change had been made.</p>

  <p>Sam, who had been literally lifted from his breakfast a little more than
  an hour before, was glad to meet her&mdash;at least he said so.</p>

  <p>"So good of you to come, Mr. Wasser! I suppose you wonder why I asked
  you?"</p>

  <p>She paused; her son made a discreet retirement. Sam had an illusion of
  importance. He remembered that he was a gentleman and dragged his fascinated
  eyes from the peculiar abnormality of the lady's countenance; thereafter
  looked past her right ear, which supported a large pear-shaped emerald. So
  did her left ear, for the matter of that.</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down&mdash;please!"</p>

  <p>"After you, ma'am," said Sam gallantly.</p>

  <p>He hitched up the knees of his pants and sat expectantly.</p>

  <p>"I was so terribly sorry to hear of your misfortune. My son told me, and I
  have been wondering if I could do something for you."</p>

  <p>Sam coughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am, that's kind of you, but I guess there's nothing can be done.
  I got to smile an' start fresh. I don't blame October&mdash;it's this bum.
  He's just naturally bad. I ought to have killed him. But I just didn't want
  to till I was sure."</p>

  <p>"Sure," she repeated encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I went up after him before&mdash;well, before the weddin', ma'am.
  Up in the woods. You see, ma'am, I had my suspicions. That very mornin' she
  said 'I'd rather marry that hobo.' But I wasn't sure. So I went up in the
  woods to have it out with him an' I said&mdash;well, I don't know what I
  said. I just laid him out."</p>

  <p>"That was brave of you, to go alone against that big fellow."</p>

  <p>Sam moved uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am, not exactly alone&mdash;two fellers, maybe three." She
  accepted three. He added sombrely: "I ought to have killed him."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Wasser"&mdash;the old woman tapped her knee with fingers that were
  hardly visible under flashing rings&mdash;"I think you are very foolish to
  say that nothing can be done. I am English, so that I am not very well
  acquainted with your laws, but you know, don't you, that the validity of the
  marriage has been questioned and that the State Attorney has declared it to
  be illegal?"</p>

  <p>"Is&mdash;that&mdash;so!"</p>

  <p>Sam had skipped all those parts of the newspaper reports which did not
  mention him.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think you could seek out this foolish girl and explain what a
  terrible position she is in? And don't you think, Mr. Wasser, that it would
  be very chivalrous and noble of you to offer her your name?"</p>

  <p>Sam's feet were twisting under the chair.</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please&mdash;I want to finish. All the newspapers say that the
  girl&mdash;that Miss Jones loved you; that is so, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Wasser's feet curled round one another lightly.</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am, October was kind of crazy&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Crazy about you? Yes, that is what I mean."</p>

  <p>Lady Georgina Loamer was a very clever woman, and three minutes' personal
  association with October, or one minute's personal observation of October in
  her relationship with Mr. Wasser would have informed her. Unfortunately, she
  took newspaper accounts a little too literally. She was a subscriber to the
  London <i>Times</i>, which dismissed big tragedies in little space. Such
  as:</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">The man found shot in Trafalgar Square has been
  identified as Sir John Smith. Lady Smith has been detained by the police. It
  is believed that jealousy of the popular dancer Madame Tiptoeski is at the
  root of the sad affair.</p><br>

  <p>She was not acquainted with the cliches of a brighter journalism. She did
  not know that any woman who poisons her husband is automatically "beautiful,"
  and that when romance is missing from even the most sordid tragedy it is
  mechanically supplied. It was impossible for her to envisage an army of
  toiling reporters whose task was to save or blacken faces, and that while
  they had no objection to being harrowed, the average readers refused to be
  nauseated, and therefore it was necessary, for the proper presentation of the
  Littleburg affair, that October Jones should be presented in the light of a
  victim.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes. She was&mdash;not exactly crazy, ma'am, but&mdash;well, we
  <i>understood</i> each other."</p>

  <p>Lady Georgina wondered which of the two understandings was the more
  accurate. She had a pretty shrewd idea.</p>

  <p>"This is what I wanted to say. The happiness of young people is my chief
  consideration in life. I have a feeling that I would like to help you. The
  question is, Mr. Wasser, would you be offended if I said that the day you and
  this wretched&mdash;this poor young woman&mdash;were reconciled and married,
  I would give you as a wedding present ten thousand dollars?"</p>

  <p>Sam's feet went limp. He made sounds indicative of surprise and pleasure,
  but in his face was the blank despair of a starving man who is separated from
  food by a river that he cannot swim.</p>

  <p>"Well, ma'am, you see, it's this way. Nobody knows where October is. Last
  night this hobo stole a gentleman's clothes an' bluffed old Elmer&mdash;said
  he was from the Department of Justice&mdash;he'll get thirty years in the
  penitentiary for that&mdash;and October went away, and where she went
  to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Lady Georgina walked to the window and pulled aside the lace curtains.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that she?"</p>

  <p>Sam gaped past her.</p>

  <p>October Jones was standing on the opposite sidewalk. She did not see the
  interested audience of her movement. All her attentions were concentrated
  upon a red-bearded man who stood stock-still in the middle of the street,
  regarding her with an unfriendly eye.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>Where was Robin? Her heart was beating furiously, and it was not from fear
  for herself. She withdrew her attention for a second and looked round for the
  echoing Lenny. He was nowhere in sight. When her eyes came back to Red Beard
  he was apparently interested elsewhere. And then he strolled on, ignoring
  her. She wanted to follow, but Robin had told her to stay. And stay she
  must.</p>

  <p>The crowd was increasing. Every minute brought a new contingent from the
  neighbouring towns and&mdash;was she mistaken?&mdash;more police. She saw a
  party of a dozen ride slowly down the street; they must have come some
  distance, for their horses were caked with dust, their flanks wet and
  heaving. And then a wagon drew up by the sidewalk and a dozen youngish men
  tumbled out&mdash;she saw the glitter of a police badge as one threw back his
  jacket to shake off the dust. Police?</p>

  <p>Surely more than was necessary to keep in order a few thousand law-abiding
  holiday makers, or to deal with the half a dozen manipulators of peas and
  walnut shells who lurked in secluded side streets to baffle and bleed the
  unwary.</p>

  <p>She felt herself go white and red again. Robin's presence here was known,
  but that was not all. Something dreadful had happened.</p>

  <p>"'Lo, October!"</p>

  <p>She almost jumped at the greeting. Mr. Sam Wasser's smile was labelled in
  his mind as friendly. It was a large and stony grin&mdash;he held out his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Glad to see you, October. Didn't think I'd be meet-in' you here. Seen Mr.
  Elmer?"</p>

  <p>"No," she managed to say.</p>

  <p>Sam extracted a cigar from his handkerchief pocket and lit it with an air
  of nonchalance. He found it difficult to meet her gaze.</p>

  <p>"All that stuff&mdash;what I said last night&mdash;forget it, October. I
  was sore. Honest, wouldn't you be sore? I'm a man of the world, October."</p>

  <p>She had been thrown off her balance, but she was her normal self again;
  could even smile so faintly that he was not sure whether she smiled at
  all.</p>

  <p>"Why, Sam, that's fine. When did this happen?"</p>

  <p>He was in the position of an orator who had a set speech for delivery but
  could find nothing to lead him to the opening. If she had said, as he had
  every reason to anticipate, "Why are you following me?" he could have begun:
  "Because, in spite of all that has passed, I love you and wish to protect you
  from yourself," or something like that.</p>

  <p>"Aw, say, October! I been worried to death about you&mdash;can't sleep,
  can't eat nothing."</p>

  <p>Yet there was nothing of the starveling in his appearance, and his eyes
  were brighter than they would have been if he had sat up all night in the
  doorway of a studio store listening to the sobbings of an old man.</p>

  <p>She looked round at the drug store.</p>

  <p>"I see&mdash;you were on your way to the druggist? Too bad, but he'll fix
  you up with a sleeping draught. Perhaps you need a tonic&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want you!" said Sam huskily, and before she could frame an answer he
  stepped in with his preamble. "I want you because&mdash;well, in spite of the
  way you turned me down&mdash;you know you did, October! I guess if any other
  feller's ever been treated so darned mean he wouldn't come runnin' after you
  same as me."</p>

  <p>She became conscious of a small and supernaturally clean boy on the
  sidewalk. He stood, very ill at ease and uncertain, looking first at October,
  then at Sam. In his hand he twisted and twirled a folded slip of paper.</p>

  <p>"You only got to look at what the <i>Globe an' Star</i> wrote to see how
  mean you've been. After what I done&mdash;did for you an'
  everything&mdash;"</p>

  <p>October went up to the boy.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me?" she asked in a low voice.</p>

  <p>"You Mrs. Bo&mdash;somethin'?"</p>

  <p>She almost snatched the note from his hand.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">Get to school far end of main avenue. Walk on into country.
  Will endeavour pick you up. Police looking for me.</p><br>

  <p>There was no signature. The note was written on a telegraph blank.</p>

  <p>She crumpled the paper in her hand and nodded to the boy. Evidently he
  expected no reward, for he did not linger.</p>

  <p>Sam, whose eloquent appeal had been interrupted, saw nothing remarkable in
  her brief colloquy with the small boy. Possibly she had sent him on an errand
  and had been waiting there for his return.</p>

  <p>"... in spite of all that's passed, October, I&mdash;well, I'm crazy about
  you. That's what. Plumb mad about you, October. You're all alone an'
  friendless an'&mdash;well, you know&mdash;an' you're not married, October!
  The district attorney an' the bishop an' everybody says it's unregular and
  illegal."</p>

  <p>She cared nothing for bishops at that moment of crisis.</p>

  <p>"Meet me here in an hour's time."</p>

  <p>This was not the moment for argument; she could not even spare the time to
  be offensive.</p>

  <p>"What I wanted to say was this, October&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In an hour's time. Leave me now or I will not see you at all. Go!"</p>

  <p>He responded to this dramatic dismissal. She did not wait until the broad
  portals of Astor House had engulfed him before she joined that section of the
  leisurely throng that was moving in the direction of the school. To make
  absolutely sure that she had made no mistake she asked a woman loiterer.</p>

  <p>Police everywhere!</p>

  <p>There were other men, obviously strangers to the town, who exchanged
  knowing glances with the uniformed men as they strolled past them.</p>

  <p>The schoolhouse was a building of glaring red brick, shingle-roofed, not
  to be missed. It was aloof from the town proper, nearer to a huddle of
  one-story frame houses of microscopic dimensions that formed a suburb to the
  town and yet had an entity and a name of its own. The woman she had
  questioned had told her that the school was "this side Lutherville."</p>

  <p>The road before the school was comparatively deserted except for the
  pedestrians and vehicles making for the town she had left. There was no sign
  of Robin.</p>

  <p>"Walk on into country," the note said, and she continued on her way. Soon
  Lutherville was behind her. On either side were fields dotted with shocks of
  buckwheat; farm buildings were numerous; ahead was the blue curve of hills.
  She stopped and sat down, staring back along the road. Except for the cars
  that had passed her there was nothing in sight.</p>

  <p>A motor truck of some kind was coming toward her, progressing with painful
  slowness. A diminutive man was driving&mdash;she thought at first he was a
  boy. The noise of the worn-out and patched-up engine was thunderous, even at
  a distance. As it came nearer it sounded like an artillery bombardment.</p>

  <p>"Phut! Crash! Boom! Bang!" and through the major notes the counter melody
  of metallic tittering.</p>

  <p>The driver was a middle-aged man with a wisp of iron-gray beard on his
  chin and large rimless glasses on his nose. His face wore a look of fierce
  determination and labour, as though it were only the operations of his
  indomitable soul that kept the horrible machine in motion. It moved at a good
  walking pace; when it came near the noise was deafening. The driver threw her
  one appealing glance as he came up to her. The truck had a tilt; napping
  curtains hid its interior.</p>

  <p>"October!"</p>

  <p>She spun round with a cry. The curtains at the back were parted. She saw a
  face and an extended hand and flew. The hand caught hers; she gripped the
  edge of the tailboard with her other hand and was drawn upward.</p>

  <p>"Watch your step," warned Robin. "We have guests!"</p>

  <p>And then in the half darkness she saw the man with the red beard and his
  broad-faced companion. They were lying on the broken floor of the truck,
  their hands strapped to one another's, back to back.</p>

  <p>"You can sit on 'em if you like," shouted Robin obligingly.</p>

  <p>It was necessary to shout, for inside the truck the sound of bombardment
  was intensified.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10"
     name="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

  <p class="first">WHEN Mr. Robin Leslie Beausere left his wife he went in
  search of a telegraph office. He had two dollars in his pocket, and was
  determined to take a short cut out of all his troubles. But the telegraph
  office was not easy to find without making inquiries. And his accent was
  rather English. One good result came of his wanderings&mdash;he became
  acquainted with local topography. On a board attached to a hardware store was
  a sheet advertising the desirable character of building lots outside the
  town. To illustrate their proximity a conscienceless draughtsman had drawn a
  plan, and on one of the broad tree-shaded avenues (as they were in the
  drawing) was the inscription "To Ogdensburg." And Ogdensburg or thereabouts
  was his destination.</p>

  <p>The town boasted, in addition to a cinema, a theatre. He became aware of
  this, oddly enough, before he had seen the lurid posters which advertised
  that sterling attraction <i>A Mother's Sin</i> which was immodestly described
  as "The most stupendous Drama of Love and Hate and Woman's Sacrifice ever
  presented on the American Stage."</p>

  <p>It was an argument between the pugnacious driver of a trolley that had
  evidently transported the properties and scenery of this soul-stirring play,
  and one who, to judge by his commanding manner and all-round insolence, was
  not only the manager but the leading man of the troupe, that first attracted
  Robin's attention.</p>

  <p>He was not near enough, nor did he penetrate the fast-gathering crowd, to
  learn the cause of the dispute, but guessed that money entered into the
  question.</p>

  <p>It was as he strolled off that he became dimly aware that there were more
  police in the town than seemed necessary. Two men, walking together in front
  of him, were obviously detectives. One took off his hat and showed a sandy
  head, bald at the back. They were talking; he got nearer to them.</p>

  <p>"... not in ten years. Last case was when Mickey got Norey the Lawyer. Cut
  his throat same as this bum's was cut."</p>

  <p>That was all and more than Robin wanted to hear. The body had been found,
  and though his own name had not been mentioned he knew that he was the
  explanation for this incursion of police officers. They were looking for him,
  and either knew that he was in town or guessed that this was the most likely
  place to find him.</p>

  <p>Soon after this he found the telegraph office, took a blank to the wall
  desk, and considered. To send such a wire at all was repugnant to him. He was
  quitting. Whichever way he examined his motives, he was a quitter. But there
  was October to be considered ...</p>

  <p>He dropped point of pencil to the paper; checked his hand again. What good
  would be the wire if they arrested him for the murder of O.? He got a little
  hot and bothered as he thought of all the possible consequences of such an
  arrest.</p>

  <p>He made up his mind quickly, scribbled a note to the girl, and looked
  round for a messenger. A boy had brought in a wire for dispatch and was
  paying the clerk. Robin caught his eye and signalled him; the small boy came
  suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Here's a quarter for you, son: take this note to a young lady you'll find
  waiting outside the druggist's."</p>

  <p>When the messenger had gone Robin walked without haste to the door and
  stepped aside to allow a newcomer to enter.</p>

  <p>"Mornin', bo!"</p>

  <p>Red Beard was more shocked than he; his voice trembled so slightly that an
  ordinary hearer would not have detected the quaver of it. Behind him was
  Lenny, a set grin on his face, his brown eyes saying as plainly as words,
  "Too near&mdash;and too many police around."</p>

  <p>"Come right in, Reddy"&mdash;Robin's voice was cool, desperately
  polite&mdash;"tickled to death to see you."</p>

  <p>He had started at an advantage; his left hand was in his jacket. By a
  scarcely imperceptible flicker of eye had Red Beard observed this potent
  fact.</p>

  <p>"Got kind of spruce, ain't you? Never seen you with a moo-stache before.
  You're a dude, bo, ain't he, Lenny?"</p>

  <p>"Thasso," grunted Lenny.</p>

  <p>"I'll be going along," said Robin.</p>

  <p>Red Beard stepped aside promptly. As he came onto the street Robin turned
  at an angle to face them.</p>

  <p>"Listen"&mdash;Red Beard seemed to have forgotten that he wanted to go
  into the office at all&mdash;"I'd like to talk to you, bo. Suppose you come
  for a walk?"</p>

  <p>"Suppose!" replied Robin sardonically. "Where's the cemetery, anyway?"</p>

  <p>"Aw! Cemetery!" Red Beard looked pained. "What's all this cemet'ry stuff?
  Me and Lenny will walk in front. That's fair, ain't it, Lenny?"</p>

  <p>Lenny agreed in the usual manner.</p>

  <p>Curiosity was one of Robin Leslie's weaknesses.</p>

  <p>"Walk," he said, and kept close behind them as they marched together side
  by side in their soldier-like way. As they turned at the corner of the block
  he was close behind them&mdash;knowing the dangerous nature of corners. At
  the Main Street end of the thoroughfare was a fair sprinkling of people, a
  booth or two. A man, patently Latin of origin, was selling hot edibles
  briskly. Farther down the street a procession was forming, and here was a
  bigger and younger crowd. There was a circus in town: gilded wagons;
  beautiful but under-attired ladies hobnobbing with gorgeous Cossacks; clowns
  smoking cigarettes; a dispirited lion blinking sleepily in a cage; two camels
  (Robin observed that one was mangy) and a top-hatted huntsman with a mixed
  pack of performing hounds that were merely dogs; a band wagon of scarlet and
  gold; and, a long way behind the tail of this aggregation of talent and
  beauty, a very ancient truck with a bedraggled air,</p>

  <p>"Let's talk."</p>

  <p>Red Beard and his companion stopped and came about with military
  exactness.</p>

  <p>"I seen your young lady on Main Street," said Red Beard. "That's one nice
  girl. A perfect lady&mdash;ain't she, Lenny?"</p>

  <p>"Thasso," said Lenny.</p>

  <p>"Me and Lenny's been talkin' about you. Lenny reckons that you're mad at
  us for shootin' you up at Schenectady. But we was all wrong. Mistook you for
  a bum who put dirt on me an' Lenny down in Looeyville last fall. Ain't that
  so, Lenny?"</p>

  <p>"Thasso," said Lenny.</p>

  <p>"We got you wrong, bo, and that's a fact. Now me an' Lenny don't want any
  fuss&mdash;we got our own graft an' we don't want anybody to go sour on us
  because we mistook you for a guy that doubled us in Looeyville."</p>

  <p>"And when," asked Robin blandly, "did you make this discovery? Did it
  coincide&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"How's that?" asked Red Beard.</p>

  <p>"Did it happen when you found that I'd borrowed the watchman's gun and was
  a good enough shot to take your hat off?"</p>

  <p>"That's nothin' to do with it," Red Beard hastened to assure him. "You
  didn't need to shoot off my derby&mdash;I'd take it off to you as a shooter.
  Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Then what do you want to talk about?"</p>

  <p>Red Beard did not look at his friend. He stared straight ahead.</p>

  <p>"You're in bad. Seen the coppers in town? I'll bet you have! I'll bet
  there's nothin' you don't see! Sharp! That's what I says to Lenny: 'I'll bet
  he don't miss any!'"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I've seen the police; I thought they were after you."</p>

  <p>Red Beard was amused. He laughed loud and long.</p>

  <p>"Tha's the best one I heard since I left New York! Say, Lenny, did you
  hear this big stiff? Ain't he the big joke? Listen&mdash;I'm tellin' you. You
  got to get out of town&mdash;quick! There's three fly cops on every way
  out&mdash;and mounted fellers. You can't get out one-handed and that's a
  fact. Me and Lenny's got to skip, too&mdash;that bonehead cop from
  Littleburg's here and he's mad at us. But me an' Lenny won't leave you. We
  got a feelin' we'd like to pull you out with us. Only we can't take your
  young lady. That's a fact."</p>

  <p>"How are you going to get me out?"</p>

  <p>Red Beard looked round, and it occurred to the fugitive that until that
  moment his would-be rescuer had not considered a method. The ramshackle truck
  was drawn up by the roadside; its little driver sat with his back to a high
  poster-covered fence, eating.</p>

  <p>"Just wait," said Red Beard, and walked slowly over to the luncher.</p>

  <p>"Mornin'., boss&mdash;come far?"</p>

  <p>The little man eyed him unfavourably over his glasses.</p>

  <p>"Ogdens," he said briefly, and took another bite at the thick wad of brown
  dough that occupied his attention.</p>

  <p>"Me and my friends reckon we'd like to go back to Ogdens. Startin'
  soon?"</p>

  <p>"Yuh"&mdash;with a glance at "my friends." And then, with a shake of head:
  "My old truck don't go fast enough. You'd get there sooner on the cars."</p>

  <p>Red Beard whistled softly.</p>

  <p>"Pretty well known around here?"</p>

  <p>"I'd say," said the truck owner complacently. "You wouldn't find nobody
  here that didn't know me. My name's Meister."</p>

  <p>"Police know you?"</p>

  <p>"Hey?" Suspicion was in the man's face and tone. He had money in his
  pocket and this man was a stranger. "Yuh! Don't suppose there's a cop in this
  country that don't know me. I'm a Justice of the Peace!"</p>

  <p>He put back the remainder of his lunch in a tarnished pail.</p>

  <p>"I guess I'll be getting along."</p>

  <p>Red Beard signed to the others to come; they were crossing the road. Mr.
  Meister's heart sank into his little boots.</p>

  <p>"We figured we'd like to take a ride with you," said Red Beard, and, as
  the old man went to the starting handle, signalled the two into the back of
  the machine.</p>

  <p>The engines whirled round; Mr. Meister leaped to his seat with great
  agility when he saw that his questioner had disappeared. The truck jerked
  forward; behind the driver the curtain was pulled aside.</p>

  <p>"Drive straight through town and speak to nobody. I'll be watching you,
  you old runt, an' I'll blow your spine outer you if you squeal!"</p>

  <p>The muzzle of a gun rested on the back of the driver's seat. Mr. Meister
  reeled. As the truck came to the thronged avenue:</p>

  <p>"You guys better lay flat," said Red Beard, "case any of these hicks peek
  in," and set an example, lying athwart the floor, holding back the front
  curtain with one hand, his gun levelled in the other.</p>

  <p>Robin and Lenny were stretched side by side and facing. Half the width of
  the truck was between them.</p>

  <p>They were clear of the town, beyond the shacks that were qualifying for
  entrance to the gazetteer; fields on either side; no sign of October.</p>

  <p>"Put that gun down!"</p>

  <p>Red Beard turned his head. Robin was resting on his elbow, and his left
  hand held a black-barrelled automatic. Red Beard looked at Lenny and the
  impassive face of the echo told him nothing. He laid down the revolver very
  carefully, and Robin kicked it toward himself. And then, every muscle in
  play, he flung himself back against the side of the truck. Lenny struck, but
  struck short. Swifter than eye could follow, his hand had moved: the knife
  buried itself in the wooden floor and the point protruded beneath.</p>

  <p>"Come here, Reddy, and step lively! Stay down&mdash;you!"</p>

  <p>He was on his feet. Red Beard lurched forward, his hands above his
  head.</p>

  <p>"Lie down&mdash;back to back."</p>

  <p>There were little straps in the truck; the pinioning was easy.</p>

  <p>"Clever, ain't you? We got you out of town and this is what you do! Say,
  we'll get you for this!"</p>

  <p>"Don't talk," said Robin ominously.</p>

  <p>He took a look at the driver. The little man was like one in a trance.</p>

  <p>"Go right on; don't stop till you get to Ogdensburg."</p>

  <p>Now he saw the slim figure by the wayside and, going to the back curtain,
  called.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11"
     name="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

  <p class="first">AS THEY cleared the first crossroad Robin pointed to the
  exit and helped her drop to the road. The truck thundered on without
  them.</p>

  <p>"Which way now?"</p>

  <p>She sounded breathless, and he looked at her keenly.</p>

  <p>"Canada now," he said.</p>

  <p>The railway had run parallel with the road for the last few miles, and
  they crossed it without meeting anything more human than a dog. At a wayside
  pond he stopped to toss into the still water a number of deadly weapons that
  he had acquired in the course of the trip. Two knives, a revolver, and a
  small automatic went to their permanent rest.</p>

  <p>"I'm rather sorry for Lenny," he said. "Effective knife throwing is
  largely a matter of balance&mdash;it may take him years to get used to a new
  armoury."</p>

  <p>She shivered, and again he shot an anxious glance at her.</p>

  <p>"You're not feeling&mdash;sick?" And, when she shook her head: "You'll
  never deceive me about that, will you?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I'm not sick. Not <i>really</i> sick. I'm just&mdash;I'm
  frightened to confess it&mdash;but my nerves have that all-in feeling."</p>

  <p>"You have seen the newspapers?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;why? Is it about the tramp? Did they find the&mdash;the
  body?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen them, but I gathered from such talk as I overheard that
  O.'s body was found and that the old man had not been heard of. Of course
  they blame me&mdash;the garage man spilled the beans. I am aching to see the
  newspapers."</p>

  <p>He saw them much sooner than he expected.</p>

  <p>They reached the inevitable Ogdensburg Road and turned in the direction of
  that (to him) important town. She was worried by this. Were not the victims
  of his duplicity also en route to Ogdensburg?</p>

  <p>"They will shout like blazes as soon as I am out of earshot, and the funny
  little man will stop his machine and untie them&mdash;unless he has the sense
  to drive them to the nearest police station."</p>

  <p>He laughed at the memory of a good joke.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" She was inclined to be irritable.</p>

  <p>For answer he put his hand in his pocket and drew out a respectable
  handful of bills.</p>

  <p>"Nearly a thousand dollars&mdash;I took every cent they had," he said
  simply.</p>

  <p>October was past surprise.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand&mdash;anything," she said. "Why did you&mdash;hold
  them up? Surely they were trying to help you? If it had not been for them you
  would still have been in town&mdash;captured probably."</p>

  <p>He was tickled at this.</p>

  <p>"Elfleda wouldn't allow that! I told you she wouldn't. And of course
  Elfleda was there&mdash;I saw the car as I was talking to Reddy at the
  telegraph office. No, Elfleda would hate to see me pinched!"</p>

  <p>"Sam was there, too," she said.</p>

  <p>He listened without comment. At the end of her narrative he said:</p>

  <p>"That was Elfleda, of course! Isn't she wonderful! Jolly old Elfleda! I
  just hate the thought of putting Gussie behind bars&mdash;that is going to
  break her up&mdash;hullo!"</p>

  <p>She had left his side and, walking to a grassy bank at the side of the
  road, sat down. Her face had gone suddenly very white, her hands were
  trembling.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I can walk any more," she said unsteadily.</p>

  <p>In a state of panic Robin made a search of the road. It was a straight,
  broad avenue, and he thought he saw the white gable of a house through the
  trees.</p>

  <p>"You won't faint if I leave you?" She shook her head. "Sure?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly&mdash;I sha'n't faint. Hunger doesn't kill the first
  day!"</p>

  <p>Hunger! She had eaten nothing since seven that morning. He searched his
  pockets frantically.</p>

  <p>"What a callous brute I've been!" he exclaimed. "I've nothing&mdash;not
  even a crust."</p>

  <p>Without another word he sprinted down the road. As he came nearer to the
  gable he saw it was a house of some size. A colonial mansion, white and
  chaste with wooden Corinthian pillars, hidden for half their height by some
  creeping flower of brilliant purple. As he pushed open the gate he was
  staggered to see, on a neatly painted board nailed to a big sycamore, "Rooms
  to Rent."</p>

  <p>He rang the bell and after a wait of a minute the door was opened by a
  sharp-featured maid in black. He supposed her the maid from the white apron
  and cap she wore. He thought she was between forty and fifty. She had been
  weeping; her eyes were very red and swollen, her nose had been streaked with
  powder hurriedly, in a pathetic endeavour to hide the evidence of her
  distress.</p>

  <p>"May I see your mistress, please?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes winked rapidly.</p>

  <p>"She is not at home."</p>

  <p>She was obviously British, but it was not, he thought, an unusual
  circumstance to find an English maid in a house of this character. And then
  he recalled the advertisement on the sycamore.</p>

  <p>"Can I have a room&mdash;two rooms? My&mdash;er&mdash;my wife has been
  taken ill on the road."</p>

  <p>She shook her head half-heartedly, measured his inches with a glance.</p>

  <p>"Would you be staying long?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;everything depends."</p>

  <p>He could almost watch the process of vacillation.</p>

  <p>"Come in, please."</p>

  <p>She closed the door behind him. He was in a large vestibule from which a
  staircase wound up to a gallery that ran around all four sides of the hall.
  Facing him on the wall was a large steel engraving of Queen Victoria, about
  which hung the Union flag of Britain. The floor was paved in squares of black
  and white tiling; there was a bloated rosewood cabinet against one wall, and
  an old grandfather's clock ticked solemnly in one corner. She opened a door
  and showed him into a parlour that was an example of all that mid-Victorian
  parlours should be. Everything was specklessly clean, but terribly worn and
  shabby. The original design of the carpet had long since disappeared&mdash;it
  was a reddish-blue smudge.</p>

  <p>She took off her apron and cap and laid them on the horsehair couch.</p>

  <p>"I am the lady of the house," she said simply. "I have only one maid.
  I&mdash;I sometimes open the door to strangers. You wanted rooms?"</p>

  <p>"Two," he said, but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I have one&mdash;a large double room. You see, Mr.&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Beausere."</p>

  <p>"&mdash;Mr. Beausere, I have no boarders any longer. I am rather far from
  Ogdensburg, and in the past few years new boarding houses have been opened.
  Sometimes in the spring and autumn I have a family from Canada."</p>

  <p>She wanted to tell him something, but he, growing impatient as he thought
  of October, was in no mood for her confidences.</p>

  <p>"May I bring her, then?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She hesitated again.</p>

  <p>"Yes, please. I am sure that I am doing right. God has performed great
  miracles for me&mdash;I must trust you."</p>

  <p>With this cryptic utterance in his ears but hardly in his mind he raced
  back to where he had left October, and a load rolled off his heart when he
  saw her walking slowly toward him.</p>

  <p>"You angel! I thought you would at least need carrying!"</p>

  <p>She smiled at this, and October seldom smiled.</p>

  <p>"What have you unearthed?" she asked. "Robin, I could eat grass!"</p>

  <p>He told her of his new landlady.</p>

  <p>"Poor soul&mdash;how brave!" said October in a hushed voice. "And I love
  mid-Victorian furniture, especially when the tables are loaded with fried
  chicken and pie and melons ... ugh! I mustn't think it!"</p>

  <p>The landlady was waiting at the door and informed them quaintly that she
  was usually called "Miss Ellen."</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing I would ask of you," she said, after she had
  ceremoniously introduced the parlour to October, "and that is to make as
  little noise as possible. I&mdash;I have an invalid in the house. My&mdash;my
  dear father."</p>

  <p>She searched rapidly for her handkerchief. Here, then, was the source of
  tears.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would like dinner? It is rather late&mdash;we dine at two,
  but if you wish&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>October wished, most fervently. Miss Ellen glided from the room and closed
  the door softly upon them.</p>

  <p>"In many ways," said Robin, glooming down on the girl, "this isn't real!
  It is one of the Things That Cannot Be. Thank God for money!"</p>

  <p>He rustled the bills in his pocket luxuriously, and then:</p>

  <p>"There is only one room," he said, with elaborate indifference. "I mean
  bedroom. I will break it to our dear lady that I have an eccentric desire to
  sleep on the Chesterfield&mdash;maybe there is a davenport somewhere. To a
  man who has spent a very considerable time sleeping on hard ground and
  regarding woodsheds as sybaritic, a davenport, or even a reasonably soft
  carpet, will be heaven."</p>

  <p>She said nothing in reply; for some reason or other the moment was
  embarrassing.</p>

  <p>"I suppose&mdash;we <i>are</i> married?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord, yes&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>She looked hard at the window.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sam Wasser had his doubts. He said the marriage had been declared
  illegal by the district attorney. I suppose he means the state attorney. And
  the bishop."</p>

  <p>He was uneasy.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that?" She nodded. "It's a stunt! One of those infernal
  newspaper men wanted a sensation and interviewed the bishop."</p>

  <p>She raised her face with a jerk.</p>

  <p>"Would you be&mdash;terribly relieved if it were dissolved? I shall never
  forget how miserable you were when I told you the morning after."</p>

  <p>He looked somewhat miserable now.</p>

  <p>"I guess <i>you'll</i> be relieved, you poor little hoboess!"</p>

  <p>"You're evading!" she accused.</p>

  <p>He eyed her steadily.</p>

  <p>"If this marriage is dissolved will you marry me all over again?" he
  asked, and her hand shot out to him and was imprisoned.</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen knocked at the door. Dinner was ready, she said. She hoped they
  would excuse her shortcomings and (this was asked as Robin was following into
  the dining room) when might she expect the baggage?</p>

  <p>He turned back and produced his money. It would, he explained, take some
  time to get his baggage. He was only staying because his wife was not well.
  As a matter of fact, he was on a visit from Canada and they had brought no
  baggage at all. He intended (a very bright notion) to ask her whether she
  would be so kind as to buy a few things for his wife in town&mdash;possibly a
  few articles for himself? A Palm Beach suit, for example? He had a roll of
  bills in his hand as he spoke. Would she accept a week's board in advance? He
  could have sworn that her eyes lit up at the suggestion.</p>

  <p>By the time he joined October at the table she was halfway through the
  first course. Miss Ellen herself waited on them. She made, she said in some
  confusion, a very good wine.</p>

  <p>"Not alcoholic. My dear father always laid it down that a strict
  observation of the law is the highest expression of culture."</p>

  <p>The elderberry wine was palatable. She gave them the history of the bush
  from which the berries were picked. The coffee was thin and unpalatable.</p>

  <p>"Of course she's British!" scoffed Robin when the girl expressed her
  doubt. "Taste the coffee and be convinced!"</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen came in soon after; she was dressed for the street and, to his
  delight, expressed her willingness to buy whatever he required. Perhaps they
  would inspect their room after her return? If not, it was the door facing
  them when they reached the head of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Beausere will see her room when you return," said Robin
  emphatically.</p>

  <p>He made a hurried list of his requirements and handed pencil and paper to
  October, walking discreetly to the window while she described her more
  intimate needs.</p>

  <p>The dining room overlooked a broad lawn flanked by flower beds blazing
  with early chrysanthemums. There was a little wooden nesting place on the end
  of a pole, weatherworn cupids at odd corners. Beyond the lawn a grove of
  trees; beyond that, to his surprise, a railroad. It seemed to skirt the end
  of a kitchen garden, sketchily revealed through the grove.</p>

  <p>After Miss Ellen's departure October went up to inspect her room and Robin
  found his way into the grounds. The lawn was delightfully soft; the gravelled
  path led to a pergola unseen from the window. Dorothy Perkins roses still
  bloomed pinkly, but there was a suggestion of neglect here.</p>

  <p>Poor soul. October had said rightly. He sensed a hard and bitter fight
  against the encroachment of poverty, and heroic, vain defense, in the face of
  overwhelming odds. It is hard to keep the wolf from the cottage door with its
  one entrance&mdash;here there were so many approaches to guard.</p>

  <p>The belt of pines cut off the kitchen garden; a low hedge, which was
  neither box nor privet, separated this land from a broad meadow. A small
  cowshed in one corner was closed. A train thundered past; he walked to the
  untrimmed bushes that were the first boundary line.</p>

  <p>Untrimmed, broken&mdash;why broken? There was a distinct gap, newly
  broken. The twigs that were snapped showed white, except in one place. A dark
  red turning brown. Blood! There it was again on the burnished face of a leaf
  and on another broken twig. He looked down. The grass grew high here, there
  was an abundance of goldenrod, a patch was crushed down, their stems
  snapped&mdash;blood on the goldenrod too!</p>

  <p>And now he began to quarter the field; found nothing until he explored the
  grove. Under a tree very dose to the path through which he had walked was a
  grimy old golf cap, and when he picked it up it was damp&mdash;blood! He
  wiped his hand on the grass and dropped the cap where he had found it. He
  looked at the house. It had a brooding air; the very windows seemed to leer
  slyly as though enjoying some grim joke at his expense.</p>

  <p>"Nerves!" said Robin, and returned to the house very thoughtful.</p>

  <p>October was in the parlour reading a newspaper with an expression more
  serious than his own.</p>

  <p>"I found this under the pillow of the sofa," she said, and gave it to
  him.</p>

  <p>There was a heavy type line across the front page.</p><br>

  <p class="headline">POLICE RESERVES OF STATE SEARCHING FOR TRAMP
  MURDERER.</p><br>

  <p>"That is good to begin with," he said, after he had read the line
  aloud.</p>

  <p>"There's worse to come," she said; but he was reading the worst:</p><br>

  <p class="headline">ROBERT LESLIE, ABDUCTOR OF BRIDES,<br>
  CUTS THROAT OF A FELLOW TRAMP AND<br>
  BURNS STUDIO TO HIDE HIS FIENDISH CRIME</p><br>

  <p>"They called me 'fiendish' before," he complained.</p>

  <p>"Have you read what Al Luke has to say?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He jumped the headlines and came to Al Luke, his story.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">It was round about seven when I saw the tramp fiend. He
  stopped at Mr. Stone's garage, where I work, and asked me for a can of
  petrol. I saw his hands were stained, but little dreamed that the sanguinary
  fluid&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>"I'll bet Al didn't say that," protested Robin.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">&mdash;sanguinary fluid was the blood of his wretched
  victim. I saw October Jones. She sat in the machine most of the time. She
  looked pale and wan. I would not call her pretty, but she was
  sad-looking&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>"He wouldn't call you pretty," emphasized Robin.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't even call you pretty," she retorted.</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">The man was a debased-looking creature and the trace of
  his vicious life was only too evident. I didn't notice what clothes he
  wore&mdash;</p><br>

  <p>"Good for Al!"</p><br>

  <p class="newspaper">&mdash;I only saw his besotted face. Madness glared out
  of his eyes.</p><br>

  <p>The report concluded with the information that Mr. Al Luke was expecting
  to get married at an early date to the prettiest girl in Luxor, and was
  moving to Littleburg to join the thriving garage company of Slitt &amp;
  Silberman as head mechanic.</p>

  <p>"Not so bad," said Robin, and folded up the paper. "I wonder what happened
  to Baldy&mdash;that pathetic old slave! The paper makes no mention of
  him."</p>

  <p>At her suggestion he replaced the journal where she had found it. He left
  her with an old volume of Scott&mdash;the lightest reading that the bookshelf
  in the parlour had to offer, and, returning to the garden, began a systematic
  search.</p>

  <p>Nearing the end of the tree belt, he was conscious of the pungent odour of
  burning kerosene. Against the brick wall which bordered one side of the
  garden was a heap of ashes that still smouldered. He sniffed and raked over
  the ashes. The centre of the heap was still red. What had been burned here?
  It was impossible to tell: the fluffy ash gave no clue, until he saw, in the
  depth of the red glowing heart, a red-hot metal button, and then another a
  little larger. Old clothing&mdash;and Miss Ellen did not seem the kind of
  woman who would burn old clothes.</p>

  <p>Going down into the meadow, he straddled the gap in the hedge and found
  himself on a railway embankment. There were bloodstains here and a heap of
  gravel piled up by the side of the track was scattered as though it had been
  struck by a heavy body.</p>

  <p>There had been an accident. He began to piece together the evidence. Miss
  Ellen's aged father had wandered onto the track and had been knocked over by
  an engine and carried into the house. But why the mystery, and how came it
  that she made no reference to the happening?</p>

  <p>Going back through the trees, he found the cap. It was an ancient golf cap
  with a large red check, and he had the impression that he had seen it before.
  But where? There must be thousands of such caps in use. He picked it up with
  a stick and, balancing the thing carefully, carried it to the ash heap and
  poked it into the centre of the fire.</p>

  <p>When he returned to the parlour October was asleep, the open book in her
  lap. He sat down opposite her.</p>

  <p>She was pretty, very pretty. The long lashes that lay on her cheek were
  darker than her hair, a mop of red gold ... He sighed deeply, and the sound
  may have awakened her, for she opened her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Was I asleep? How long have you been here? Did I snore? How mean of
  you!"</p>

  <p>He shook his head solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Nary a snore! I could have kissed you, but I didn't."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you?" she asked, retrieving the book that had fallen to the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"My innate delicacy is largely responsible," he said, "plus the dread
  warning of Mr. Samuel Wasser."</p>

  <p>"That we are not married?" She yawned and stretched her arms. "Lordy! I
  shouldn't take much notice of what Sam said&mdash;there was nothing about it
  in the <i>Post-Courier</i>."</p>

  <p>"That almost makes it true," he replied. "October, <i>quo vadis</i>?"</p>

  <p>"Ogdensburg," she said lazily, "and a nice swim in the St. Lawrence, and
  then Canada!"</p>

  <p>He laughed gently.</p>

  <p>"Do you know the width of the river at Ogdensburg? October, I owe you an
  apology."</p>

  <p>"Why?" suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I thought you were just reckless&mdash;I wish to heaven I could remember
  all the details of that wedding! I imagined&mdash;be calm!&mdash;hysteria. A
  sort of frenzy that came upon you and made you say 'I will' or whatever one
  says&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"<i>You</i> said it," she challenged.</p>

  <p>"But I was not quite myself."</p>

  <p>"Tight&mdash;intoxicated!" she mocked. "Of course you said 'I will.' And I
  wasn't frenzied. I knew all that it meant or might mean&mdash;marrying a
  tramp. I did&mdash;if you smile I shall do something&mdash;unwomanly!</p>

  <p>"That was Mr. Elmer's favourite complaint against me, that I did unwomanly
  things&mdash;smoked, and washed myself all over in' the stable&mdash;they
  haven't a shower at Four Beeches Farm. But I wasn't frenzied. Not after you
  said 'Sorry.' If you hadn't said 'Sorry' I shouldn't have married you. But
  you <i>did</i> say 'Sorry' and I knew that you meant it. And I've never been
  afraid&mdash;except once. Once&mdash;I was scared when I woke up, scared and
  angry with myself because&mdash;well, I don't know why. What do you think of
  me?"</p>

  <p>In clear type such a question has more than a hint of coquetry; there was
  provocation enough in its artlessness, yet he could see no more than she
  meant to ask.</p>

  <p>"I am trying to tell you. You're unique."</p>

  <p>"All women are," she retorted.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;don't interrupt: you send all my profound judgments skew-wiff!
  But you're unique in the light of experience. You may represent a numerous
  genre, but I have never met a sample. Vividly wholesome&mdash;'vividly' is
  right&mdash;you shine! Puritanical, too. That's queer. I thought you were
  Joan of Arc-ish but you're not. You see no&mdash;apparitions (poor old
  Baldy!); you're sane. Lady Godiva is nearer the type: a shingled Lady Godiva.
  You would have scorned the compromise of long hair&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is so: I should have felt I was a cheat&mdash;what else?"</p>

  <p>"You're emotional in a kind of way&mdash;I haven't quite got to the end of
  you there. You're rather a stranger. I talked blithely about kissing you just
  now. But the truth is I never thought of it. I'd sooner knock out the fuse of
  a dud shell with a coke hammer. You'd explode&mdash;or you wouldn't. I'd be
  disappointed if you didn't and be unconscious if you did. How old are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Twenty-one. If I hadn't been twenty-one yesterday or whenever it was
  you'd be going on your way and I should have finished <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>.
  I wonder if I should have exploded?"</p>

  <p>"I think you would," he nodded. "It would have been a pretty bad piece of
  timing on my part. I know a fellow who jumped into the sea to save a drowning
  girl. She was awfully pretty and rather fond of him, but as he swam with her
  he kissed her&mdash;she never forgave him."</p>

  <p>She had not taken her eyes from his face all the time he had been
  speaking.</p>

  <p>"I hate your moustache," she said.</p>

  <p>"That was another reason why I could not kiss you," he said, and she went
  pink.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of that&mdash;yes, I was! It is too late to start
  lying. I was. That moustache with little spiky ends&mdash;like an Italian
  banker or Matilda Ann's ideal&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Hi, bo! You glommin' the freight?"</p>

  <p>A cracked, choky voice hailed them, and Robin leaped to his feet.</p>

  <p>Standing in the doorway was a little man wrapped in a woman's faded
  kimono. His head was swathed in white bandages, his scrawny feet were bare.
  Chalk-faced, he glared at Robin.</p>

  <p>"Get busy! We'll make Troy in the mornin' and there's poke-outs
  aplenty."</p>

  <p>It was Baldy the tramp, Baldy tottering into this quiet parlour, the light
  of madness in his eyes. The old man's knees gave way as Robin reached and
  caught him.</p>

  <p>"Hey?" He looked up into Robin's face. "'Lo&mdash;that shack ditched me,
  bo&mdash;an' the train makin' forty! Caught me with his sap and ditched me!"
  His head drooped.</p>

  <p>"What does he say?" asked the bewildered girl. "I can't understand."</p>

  <p>"He was stealing a ride on a train and the brake-man found him, clubbed
  him, and threw him off."</p>

  <p>The mystery of the bloodstain and the gap in the hedge was a mystery no
  longer. And the miracle of Miss Ellen's&mdash;was it not miraculous that this
  old wanderer should have been ditched at the door of the house he had left
  thirty years before!</p>

  <p>He laid the old man down on the hard sofa. His eyes were closed, and
  October, in alarm, thought he was dead.</p>

  <p>"I wonder where the servant is?" asked Robin. "Would you look after him
  while I find her?"</p>

  <p>At that moment Baldy's eyelids flickered and opened. He looked up at Robin
  and smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"I am dreadfully sorry to give you so much trouble, sir. My knowledge of
  medicine tells me that I have&mdash;um&mdash;a very short time to live. Would
  it be trespassing on your kindness to ask you&mdash;I would like to see Julia
  very much. My dear wife would understand&mdash;in the circumstances. Julia,
  she is staying at the King Edward Hotel. Suite 12, I think&mdash;yes, I am
  almost sure. Lady Georgina Loamer."</p>

  <p>Across the frail body Robin's eyes met the girl's.</p>

  <p>"Elfleda! What a lady!" he breathed.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12"
     name="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

  <p class="first">LADY GEORGINA LOAMER reclined at her ease in a long cane
  chair, a cigarette between her heavily carmined lips, her bright eyes fixed
  upon her son. That small-featured man was not happy, and he had less reason
  for happiness because of his mother's awful calm. A dozen times he took out
  his monocle, polished and replaced it in position. His fingers beat a
  miserable tattoo on the arm of the chair, and his mechanical smile was little
  more than a grimace.</p>

  <p>The town was still crowded; Main Street was a vista of twinkling lights.
  The blaring circus band had just passed under the window, interrupting their
  conversation, and incidentally affording a blessed respite for Mr.
  Loamer.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" she asked. When Lady Georgina Loamer was
  annoyed her voice had a peculiar hoarseness. And she was hoarse now.</p>

  <p>"I don't know." He examined his eyeglass attentively. "I suppose I'd
  better take the car to Ogdensburg and bring back these fools. Really, Mother,
  I don't see why you should rag me! I've done my best. I never supposed that
  Robin would be easy. I told you so&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind what you told me!" she rasped.</p>

  <p>"At any rate," he interrupted, "it was not my idea; you will admit that.
  It was yours."</p>

  <p>He wilted under the contempt in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Not your idea! Have you ever had an idea, Alan? Not your idea! I hate to
  remind you, but you are very like your father."</p>

  <p>Evidently this was her deadliest insult, for there followed a long and
  tense silence. Mr. Alan Loamer's face was very red; his frown was terrible;
  but she knew him for the weakling he was, and his active rebellion came in
  the nature of a shock.</p>

  <p>"I don't care!" He spoke rapidly, his sentences were a little disjointed.
  "I'm finished with the business. It's too horrible! And he knows, he's always
  known! Doesn't he call you 'Elfleda' openly? He has always expected this,
  Mother. Robin is no fool. You shouldn't have come&mdash;why didn't you stay
  in Ottawa? You've made things impossible. I'm going to New York to-morrow
  morning, and I'm catching the first boat that sails for Europe!"</p>

  <p>The thin lips of the woman curved in a smile.</p>

  <p>"You sail&mdash;as a steward?" she asked sardonically. "And how will you
  reach New York? 'On the bumpers' or 'riding the rods'? Those are the terms,
  aren't they? You'll stay here, Alan, until I give you leave to go&mdash;and
  money to go with. I should have stayed in Ottawa! I never intended staying in
  Ottawa. When the Sullivans offered me their house while they were in Europe I
  accepted because I knew that sooner or later you would need help. Have you
  ever succeeded in anything&mdash;without help?"</p>

  <p>He wriggled in his impotent rage and became his old humble self.</p>

  <p>"Mother, be reasonable! This thing is getting on my nerves; I shall have a
  breakdown. I get no sleep&mdash;really, the thing is impossible. And he
  knows! Why not chuck the thing and come back to England with me?"</p>

  <p>She got up from her chair, walked to the window, and pulled aside the
  shade; he thought she had heard something which had attracted her attention,
  but apparently she needed this stimulus of movement and light&mdash;stimulus
  or sedative, for, when she turned round, she was smiling.</p>

  <p>"We'll go to Ogdensburg," she said. "There is a good hotel
  there&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Do you know the place?" he asked, in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I knew it years ago," she answered briefly. "My father had large
  interests in Canada and I spent some years in Toronto. What is the name of
  that man with the red beard?"</p>

  <p>"Byrne," he replied.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I want to see him," she said. "No, not here. It would be foolish to bring
  them back. Where are they waiting?"</p>

  <p>He told her that they had telephoned from a little restaurant on the
  outskirts of Ogdensburg.</p>

  <p>"That means, of course, that they are too well known to go into the town,"
  she nodded. "And it would be little better for them here, if what you say is
  true."</p>

  <p>He was a picture of apprehension.</p>

  <p>"Is it wise?" he pleaded. "I mean to say, need you come into this at
  all?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool!" She cut him short. "Now tell me, what have you said to
  these men? What reason have you given?"</p>

  <p>"I've told them that Robin was a servant who has been blackmailing the
  family for years. That's right, isn't it? That he unearthed some&mdash;well,
  some scandal about&mdash;us."</p>

  <p>"Me," she said shortly.</p>

  <p>"Well, you. I've never asked you whether there was a scandal. I suppose
  that isn't true?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't necessary that you should be convinced," she said coldly. "Did
  you convince them?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I did"&mdash;he was doubtful&mdash;"but they're a pretty tough
  crowd. Bryne wanted to know how long Robin had been a hobo; fortunately I
  wasn't obliged to go into details. One of them&mdash;the little Italian or
  Spaniard or whatever he is&mdash;met Robin two years ago in a hobo camp on
  the Frazer River in Vancouver. They called him 'The Guy Who Walks,' because
  he never jumps trains. Apparently a walking tramp is an object of derision.
  This Lenny man was on the run for some crime he'd committed in St. Louis at
  the time, and apparently he had some sort of fight with Robin and got the
  worst of it. Byrne told me that he only found this out after he'd fixed with
  Lenny to join him, and if it had not been for Lenny's surprise at finding an
  old enemy they would have got him south of Schenectady."</p>

  <p>Another pause.</p>

  <p>"Mother, when&mdash;if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped.</p>

  <p>"When&mdash;if?" she repeated impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Suppose the thing goes through, what about these two men? We're rather in
  their hands, aren't we?"</p>

  <p>Her frosty smile answered him.</p>

  <p>"One of them will be killed&mdash;at least one," she said. "I know Robin!
  Ring the bell, Alan, please. We ought not to keep these poor men
  waiting."</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>The sound of a door opening sent Robin into the hall. It was Miss Ellen,
  laden with parcels, and she gave him a friendly nod&mdash;then saw his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Has anything happened?" she asked fearfully.</p>

  <p>He tried to reassure her, but, dropping the packages she carried, she ran
  past him into the parlour, and when he went in she was kneeling by the sofa,
  her arm about the old man's neck.</p>

  <p>"Well! That is why you came, to find him, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>She was strident, defiant; he marvelled at the valour of this frail little
  woman. "I should have known that you were detectives. That is why you sent me
  on this errand, so that you could spy on a poor old man."</p>

  <p>Hate shone in her eyes like a fire. He was too dumbfounded to answer.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to prove that&mdash;that he killed anybody. He couldn't do
  it&mdash;he couldn't! And the girl&mdash;a man as old as he is&mdash;lies,
  newspaper lies!"</p>

  <p>A light dawned upon Robin Leslie Beausere. Now he knew why the old man's
  bloodstained clothes had been burned&mdash;why the newspaper was so carefully
  hidden from sight. This loyal daughter of his had confused her
  father&mdash;with Robin! He could have chuckled, and did indeed smile.</p>

  <p>"We are not detectives," he said quietly; "we are tramps!"</p>

  <p>"Tramps?" Doubt and incredulity in tone and look.</p>

  <p>"Yes; one half the newspaper story applies to me&mdash;the other half to
  your father."</p>

  <p>"You are a tramp&mdash;which half? Which half?" tremulously. "He
  didn't&mdash;he didn't hurt&mdash;kill anybody?"</p>

  <p>"Of course he didn't&mdash;how stupid you are, Robin!"</p>

  <p>"Robin! Robin Leslie! Is that your name? It was in the newspapers!"</p>

  <p>"Let us get your father up to bed." Robin was peremptory, almost bullying.
  "We can talk about things afterward."</p>

  <p>The old man had been a silent listener, and now, as the other stooped to
  lift him, he tittered foolishly.</p>

  <p>"Professor of anatomy, hey? His own knife too! He got his! Third cervical
  vertebra."</p>

  <p>Robin carried him rapidly out of earshot. On the bottom step of the stairs
  stood an old woman, wringing her hands. She was the oldest woman he had ever
  seen.</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, oh, lor', Miss Ellen! I only went down to boil the kettle, Miss
  Ellen."</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen, practical in that testing time of nerves and judgment, waved
  her aside and flew upstairs ahead of Robin and his burden. She showed the way
  to a little room at the far end of the gallery.</p>

  <p>"Thank you&mdash;I can attend to him now."</p>

  <p>She was as pale as the old man and almost pushed Robin from the room.</p>

  <p>"This," he said, as he came back to the parlour, "is emphatically one of
  the Things That Cannot Be. It is impossible and absurd&mdash;the most
  monstrous of all coincidences that ever disturbed the smooth flow of logic's
  placid stream."</p>

  <p>"It was the old man&mdash;Baldy, as you called him?"</p>

  <p>"Baldy; and this is his home&mdash;the home from which Elfleda enticed
  him. I'm only guessing now. October, we may have to move quickly."</p>

  <p>"Why? Do you think she will send for the police?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is a chance. You see, she cannot believe that her father would
  murder; she may be seized by the notion that my conviction would free her
  parent from blame. The homely little lioness! S-sh!" He raised a finger in
  warning.</p>

  <p>There was a telephone in the hall; they heard Miss Ellen's voice, and
  Robin crept to the closed door and listened.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Soeur? Will you come up right away? My father has come home, very
  sick. Yes, my father; he has been to&mdash;to Europe."</p>

  <p>A clang as the receiver was hung up. Robin had tiptoed back to the middle
  of the room when the door opened. Miss Ellen's face was still white, but she
  had recovered her old serenity. Closing the door behind her, she stopped to
  straighten a linen mat on one of the small tables which abounded in the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Leslie&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Beausere&mdash;but Leslie will do," he said.</p>

  <p>"I want you to tell me&mdash;the truth. About my father and about
  yourself." Her faded eyes fell upon the girl and their infinite pathos
  brought October to the verge of tears. "I am quite alone&mdash;in the world,"
  she said. "There isn't a lonelier woman in all the world. And I've nobody to
  whom I can turn for advice or help. Will you remember this?"</p>

  <p>Robin nodded slowly.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you everything," he said.</p>

  <p>For a moment October wondered whether that "everything" was more than she
  knew. But of his life before the marriage he said nothing. He only sought her
  confirmation when he spoke of the ceremony. After that he went on without
  reference to her. Miss Ellen had seated herself stiffly on the edge of a
  chair, her hands folded in her lap, her pale blue eyes searching his face.
  She listened without interruption until he finished.</p>

  <p>"You think there is no doubt?" She shook her own head in anticipation of
  his answer. "I'm glad&mdash;I'm glad he killed him!" she said breathlessly.
  "That anybody could be so wicked and cruel to an old man!" She shuddered.
  "Dreadful&mdash;he drove my father insane. And he was such a gentle
  soul&mdash;such a dear, gentle soul!"</p>

  <p>With an effort of will at which Robin could only marvel she controlled her
  quivering lips.</p>

  <p>"He was a professor of anatomy at the university and had a practice in
  Toronto&mdash;a consultative practice. My mother was an American lady and
  this was her house. She left a small legacy which enabled me to keep it going
  until my father came back; she was sure that he would return. About thirty
  years ago my father met an English peer&mdash;the Marquis of Nealford. He was
  in Toronto in connection with a company with which he was associated. He had
  a daughter, a very clever girl and very heartless, it proved. My mother said
  she was homely but brilliant. I never saw her. She was clever enough to
  fascinate my father&mdash;so that he forgot his home, his reputation,
  everything. He prepared to run away with this Lady Georgina Loamer; even sent
  Mother a letter praying her forgiveness; and then he found that she had
  fooled him. Apparently she was under the impression that he was very rich. It
  was all sordid and horrible. We never saw my father again. We had a letter
  asking us to forget him. She married soon after&mdash;we saw this in the
  Globe&mdash;she often comes to Canada, and once I saw her photograph in the
  newspapers: a woman with a face like a hawk."</p>

  <p>She described the miracle. She and the old woman had been pulling
  vegetables in the garden when the train had rattled past, and had heard
  rather than seen the old man fall from the roof of the car on which he had
  been concealed until a vigilant brake-man found him.</p>

  <p>"We dragged him into the house. Until he opened his eyes and called me by
  my dear mother's name I did not know him. And then he told me of
  the&mdash;the&mdash;of what he had done, and I found the blood on his poor
  rags and burned them. Mr. Leslie, what am I to do?"'</p>

  <p>"Do nothing. You have sent for the doctor? Tell him your father is asleep
  and you do not wish him disturbed. No doctor can help him at present. Later,
  when all this talk of tramps and murders has subsided, you can call him in.
  The point is, Miss Ellen, what would you wish us to do?"</p>

  <p>She had no views.</p>

  <p>"You may stay&mdash;or go whenever it is convenient," she said. "I will
  help you however I can. I was glad you came&mdash;the presence of a man in
  the house was welcome. What set you tramping, Mr. Leslie?"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I was born that way, I guess," he said.</p>

  <p>"Was it a woman, too?"</p>

  <p>October detected the hesitation and her heart missed a beat.</p>

  <p>"In a way," he said. Out of the tail of his eye he saw October clutch the
  edge of the table. "Yes ... the same lady&mdash;Julia. Never knew that her
  name was Julia&mdash;yes, I did, though. My father used to call her
  that&mdash;Georgina Julia."</p>

  <p>"She made you&mdash;a tramp?" Miss Ellen was open-mouthed. "But
  she's&mdash;old. Sixty."</p>

  <p>"A deuced alluring woman," said Robin calmly.</p>

  <p>"Stuff!" scoffed October. "A woman like that couldn't send a man
  <i>anywhere</i>! I don't believe it. It was somebody else! Why do you
  pretend?"</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen might not have been there. For the moment the old man was
  excluded as the absorbing interest: their common danger, the very mystery of
  the Guy Who Walked. Robin Leslie had struck the fuse with a coke hammer.</p>

  <p>"I never thought of that! Somebody hurt you and you left the world! I
  never dreamed there was romance back of everything.</p>

  <p>"Back of most things," he said, a trifle haughtily.</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen reacted to the strain; it was not a moment to intrude upon
  young married people, and she had her own immediate and urgent trouble.
  Looking round, Robin missed her, but none saw her go.</p>

  <p>"It is absurd"&mdash;she could shrug too. "I am going on like a silly
  schoolgirl. Naturally you had your past&mdash;I could not expect you to table
  your broken heart for my inspection. I am sorry."</p>

  <p>"I am glad," he said stiffly. "I mean, I am glad you have the grace to be
  sorry."</p>

  <p>"Grace!" She flamed at this.</p>

  <p>"Grace," he said firmly. "I had no broken heart to table&mdash;as you call
  it."</p>

  <p>"What would you call it?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Table," he agreed. "I have no romance; I have had no violent affairs. My
  heart is so nearly virginal it makes no difference."</p>

  <p>"Somebody sent you away and you went," she insisted. "There is no crime in
  that&mdash;you have no need to defend yourself. It is not my business. I
  don't expect you to take me into your confidence&mdash;I should loathe you if
  you did. She has a right to your reticence."</p>

  <p>He glowered at her. One needle point of his ridiculous moustache curled
  downward. Under such a handicap he could not be heroic.</p>

  <p>
  "There&mdash;is&mdash;no&mdash;woman&mdash;in&mdash;my&mdash;life&mdash;but&mdash;you,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>She laughed politely.</p>

  <p>"I am not concerned," she said.</p>

  <p>"I could <i>shake</i> you!"</p>

  <p>"You dare! And your moustache is coming undone!"</p>

  <p>"Is it?" He was interested enough to approach the gilt-framed mirror above
  the stove. "You did that. No self-respecting moustachios could stay jaunty in
  the presence of a nagging wife."</p>

  <p>"I'm not nagging&mdash;and I'm not your wife!"</p>

  <p>He said nothing to this; she thought she saw a shadow pass across his
  face.</p>

  <p>"I am nagging&mdash;and I am your wife," she added. "I'm an unpleasant
  little devil, Mr. Robin Leslie Beausere&mdash;I do wish we were in
  Canada!"</p>

  <p>He caught his breath.</p>

  <p>"That's better!" he said. "I had the sensation of standing on a chimney
  stack a mile high and watching somebody cutting the guys. Yes, it was as bad
  as that. Elfleda was the lady, but I haven't tramped for love of her."</p>

  <p>"Who could?" she answered sympathetically.</p>

  <p>It was strange how shaken she was; she could hardly believe that this limp
  being with funny squirmy sensations inside her was October
  Jones&mdash;Leslie&mdash;or Beausere.</p>

  <p>"I mustn't try that again," she said seriously.</p>

  <p>"Try what?"</p>

  <p>"Entertaining the gentleman with the green eyes. Yes, I was jealous."</p>

  <p>He took no advantage of the opening; she would have been surprised if he
  had. That was the wonder of it all&mdash;she could dispense with her
  defenses, leave the portcullis raised and the drawbridge down, and the truce,
  unspoken, unformed, was observed. The safety of him was like a draught of
  wine. Sometimes it tempted her to folly. In certain moods she was for
  painting "welcome" on the portcullis and laying a carpet across the bridge.
  Just to see if he would&mdash;</p>

  <p>A knock at the front door advertised the arrival of the doctor. There
  followed a long conversation between Miss Ellen and the visitor. The murmur
  of their voices came faintly through the stout door.</p>

  <p>"He is going upstairs," said Robin, in surprise.</p>

  <p>A very long time elapsed before the voices were heard again and the front
  door closed. Miss Ellen came in, her eyes red with weeping.</p>

  <p>"The doctor says my father cannot possibly recover," she said. "I told him
  he had fallen from a train and he says that at his age the shock is too
  violent for any hope of recovery."</p>

  <p>She pressed her lips tightly together, but the tears were rolling down her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"But the doctor doesn't know," said Robin quietly. "He doesn't know the
  hard life your father has been leading. He must have been ditched scores of
  times, and O.'s beatings, I am afraid, were frequent."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I bless you for that little ray of hope," she said, "but the doctor is
  right&mdash;I feel it. And his mind has gone, though he has long lucid
  intervals when he knows me and remembers&mdash;everything. I am too grateful
  to God that He sent him home to the heart that loved him, to resent."</p>

  <p>The heroine! Robin was humbled in the presence of this homely woman,
  prematurely aged by her sorrows. She had given up her life for this appointed
  end&mdash;sacrificed youth, and was grateful that the wanderer might die in
  the home he had desolated.</p>

  <p>"Do you think he will die?" October asked in a low voice after she had
  gone.</p>

  <p>Robin nodded.</p>

  <p>"She thinks so. Women have an uncanny instinct for these things."</p>

  <p>The coincidence of Baldy's arrival worried him. This old rod-rider who had
  probably toured and re-toured every state in the Union was wise in the ways
  of shacks. It was unlikely that he would be so incautious as to show himself
  unless&mdash;That was the explanation, of course. The old man's homing
  instinct had brought him; he was looking for the house which he knew lay on
  the railway, and, thus exposed, the brakeman or one of the train's crew had
  ditched him.</p>

  <p>Dusk fell. Miss Ellen came into the parlour with a lamp and drew the
  shades. She was very calm, almost cheerful. Her father was sleeping, she
  said. At the door she lingered.</p>

  <p>"I have put your clothes upstairs, Mr. Leslie. If you wish to dress before
  supper they are ready for you."</p>

  <p>Robin had forgotten all about the clothes.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind if I go up and change?"</p>

  <p>October did not object.</p>

  <p>"You will go to bed at what time you wish," said Miss Ellen.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Robin thoughtfully. "And that reminds me, Miss Ellen. Would
  you object very much if I used your parlour&mdash;very late? In fact, I may
  be writing until the early hours&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We may both be writing till the early hours," October broke in.</p>

  <p>The woman looked from one to the other.</p>

  <p>"I see," she said quietly, and went out.</p>

  <p>"What <i>did</i> she see?" asked Robin, but his wife was immersed in her
  Scott and supplied no answer.</p>

  <p>Soon after, Robin disappeared and was gone until a few minutes before
  supper was announced. There walked into the room a soldierly figure in yellow
  tussore. He was clean-shaven; the face was well moulded&mdash;there was about
  him that ineffable air of good breeding which may not be stated in terms of
  looks.</p>

  <p>"You?" she said incredulously.</p>

  <p>"I," said Robin. He fingered his cheek tenderly. "The poison ivy has
  ceased to cling to my sturdy jaw. Scared away, I imagine."</p>

  <p>She had noticed that morning that the swelling had almost disappeared. Of
  the black eye, the relic of which had disfigured his face on their first
  meeting, nothing remained but the palest shadow.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;come into the light. I want to look at you."</p>

  <p>He obeyed without embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Yes." The scrutiny did not altogether satisfy her, it seemed. "Yes, you
  are different. I wonder if I like the change? I think so."</p>

  <p>This new aspect of him gave her the satisfaction a new toy affords to a
  child. She made him stand, here and there, with the light on his face and
  behind him; in profile&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>"Do I get past?"</p>

  <p>"You get past," she said. "But you're terribly young!"</p>

  <p>"I shall grow out of that," he said tritely. "And I'm thirty something. In
  our set I am an aged gentleman."</p>

  <p>She pondered this.</p>

  <p>"Ten years older than I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thirteen: that's unlucky. For you, I mean. What nonsense you make me
  talk!"</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen had supper with them&mdash;an act of friendliness that they
  appreciated each for a different reason. She remarked frankly upon his
  improved appearance and said she thought she had seen his photograph
  somewhere. Robin turned the subject, but October nailed it down.</p>

  <p>"Where? Please try to think, Miss Ellen," she asked.</p>

  <p>"I was a Presidential candidate," said Robin.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly&mdash;Where, Miss Ellen?"</p>

  <p>But Miss Ellen could not remember. When she had gone out to make the
  coffee October tackled him. Her curiosity was piqued.</p>

  <p>"Has your portrait ever appeared in the newspapers?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Society butterfly&mdash;male," murmured Robin; "seen in all the best
  circles. 'Mr. Robin Beausere, well-known clubman and social leader.' Sam has
  nothing on me. Wherever I go there's a note: 'Mr. Robin Beausere has arrived
  in town. He is staying in a handsome B. &amp; O. box car in the railway
  yard.'"</p>

  <p>"But she has seen it," insisted the girl.</p>

  <p>"Maybe: under a gruesome snap, 'Found in farmer's haymow, this man goes to
  jail for sixty days.'"</p>

  <p>"Be serious&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you"&mdash;he leaned over the table&mdash;"I was cured of
  rheumatism by Dr. Schmidt's Rub-it-on&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I won't talk to you!" She flounced round in her chair. "I expect there is
  something disreputable behind it."</p>

  <p>"You've said it, aunty!" He was almost disrespectful.</p>

  <p>When the coffee came in Miss Ellen left them finally.</p>

  <p>"I have opened the secretaire if you wish to write," she said, "and I have
  put a cover and a pillow on the sofa if you don't."</p>

  <p>"That lady has a nice mind," said Robin when they were alone.</p>

  <p>He turned the conversation to a more serious channel.</p>

  <p>"We may stay here for a day or so," he said, "but we must make
  preparations for a flit."</p>

  <p>"It will be ever so much easier now that you have clothes," she suggested,
  but he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure of that. All depends upon how far Red Beard allowed the
  truck to go before he pulled up. I've been thinking since that they may not
  have gone far."</p>

  <p>"Who is Red Beard?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. He <i>had</i> a nice smile; she was certain of this now.</p>

  <p>"A gunman of sorts. A tramp I pigged with in Utica told me that he was a
  well-known hijacker who had got into some sort of trouble in Chicago&mdash;he
  double-crossed one of the intelligentsia in the rum-running business and Mud
  became his middle name. The red beard is merely a Living Down of the Past.
  Lenny was with him in his various enterprises. He has been on the road (as we
  call it at home). I met him two years ago when I was hiking through British
  Columbia and we had a&mdash;well, a sort of fight. It was over a question of
  property. He tried to glom my boots when I was asleep. They are nothing very
  much. Some day the slow but steady law of the United States will reach for
  Red Beard and set him firmly in a large wooden chair, and some lucky jail
  electrician will buy his wife a new hat on the proceeds."</p>

  <p>He was observing her closely.</p>

  <p>"You're a tired woman. If you are wise you'll go meet Miss Morpheus. I
  change the sex because, as I have told you before, I am innately
  delicate."</p>

  <p>The advice was welcome. October had never felt so tired in her life. How
  long ago since she had slept in her hard little bed at Four Beeches Farm?
  Ages!</p>

  <p>He talked about the road and the queer folks of a world beyond her ken.
  The Gobi Desert was tramping. He knew strange people, famous people in their
  own world. Hoke, who tramped through Russia while the Revolution was in
  fiercest flame, who ambled pleasantly through Germany during the war and
  begged his way from one prisoners' camp to another. Lossy, the New Englander
  who spoke fourteen languages and could not write his own name. And Lossy had
  walked and begged his way from Kashmir to Bucharest. She was immensely
  interested, was angry with herself that she nodded. Perhaps the monotony of
  his voice was studied ... she woke halfway up the stairs in his arms&mdash;he
  delivered her on her feet at the door of her room.</p>

  <p>A minute later he was knocking softly on the door, begging in a loud
  whisper for his razor.</p>

  <p>It was no more than the truth that he had letters to write&mdash;the
  writing had been postponed too long. One of these was a very long letter. His
  pen moved with extraordinary rapidity; sheet after sheet was covered and
  tossed aside. Miss Ellen brought him coffee at ten o'clock, saw the quantity
  and was impressed.</p>

  <p>"There is a mail box at the end of the lot," she said, and described its
  location. But there would be no collection until the morning, she said.</p>

  <p>"I'll mail them to-night&mdash;a mail box is as good as a safe deposit,"
  he said.</p>

  <p>Might she bring him some refreshment before he went to bed? She suggested
  elderberry wine, but Robin, in haste, elected for tea. She had tea, a special
  brand that "Dr. Evington" liked. It was the first time he had heard Baldy's
  name&mdash;the grandeur of the appellation surrounded the old man's identity
  with an aura of dignity. Never again did he think of the little tramp except
  as Dr. Evington.</p>

  <p>By eleven o'clock the three most important letters were finished. He went
  in search of Miss Ellen to beg stamps, and found her in a lofty,
  stone-flagged kitchen, stirring some concoction that simmered on a wood
  fire.</p>

  <p>"Shall I mail them?" she volunteered, when the stamps had been extracted
  from her note case, but he wouldn't hear of this.</p>

  <p>It was a fine night; the sickle moon was still in the sky, and gave an
  eerie half light to a dark and silent world. He walked up the drive, pulled
  open the gate, and strolled toward the mail box. It was affixed to a stone
  pillar that formed a corner stone of the small estate. He dropped the letters
  in and walked leisurely back. Frogs were croaking by a far-away pond, a
  frantically hurrying bat darted down toward him, swerved and vanished. A slow
  freight was making the grade somewhere south, and the harsh cough-cough of
  the engine was softened by distance to the gentlest of woofs. A night for the
  road and the open country, he thought.</p>

  <p>His hand was on the gate&mdash;</p>

  <p>A streak of silver in the air&mdash;bird&mdash;he ducked in time.</p>

  <p>The knife struck the crossbar of the gate&mdash;he saw the second in
  flight and threw himself back as he jerked out his gun. The second knife
  missed the gate&mdash;he heard the sharp whang of it as it struck a tree. Out
  of the darkness on the opposite sidewalk leaped a thin pencil of
  flame&mdash;once, twice. The report of the revolver was thunderous. The
  automatic spat in reply, a shadow ran from the shadows&mdash;Robin threw his
  gun to his left hand and fired. The shadow stumbled and went down.</p>

  <p>Robin was inside the gate, running. He saw the door open.</p>

  <p>"Get away from the door!" he yelled, and Miss Ellen fell out of sight.</p>

  <p>He leaped to the top step as October reached the hall. She asked no
  questions. A small lamp was standing on the hall table: she made for this and
  blew it out as he closed the door.</p>

  <p>"What was it?" Miss Ellen was trembling. "Not the police?"</p>

  <p>"No, the men I was telling you about." He was out of breath but was
  grinning savagely. "Lenny got his knives back&mdash;probably saw me toss them
  in the pond and fished them out again. I should have been prepared for that.
  But the gun is different&mdash;a .42. Whiskers used a hammerless of a smaller
  calibre."</p>

  <p>"They didn't hurt you?"</p>

  <p>October's hand was moving slowly up and down his sleeve, and the caress
  set him on fire.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;but I hurt one of them. Lenny, I think. I hope he isn't dead;
  I've a soft spot for the wife of the jail electrician and I'd hate it if she
  were robbed of her new hat. I'll make sure."</p>

  <p>He went through the parlour, extinguished the light, and, opening a window
  noiselessly, dropped onto the flagged terrace beneath. Passing through the
  tree belt, he reached the place where the old man's clothes had been burned.
  There was a weather-beaten door in the wall and he had noticed that it was
  not quite closed. He pushed it open far enough to squeeze through. He was in
  a narrow alleyway flanked on one side by the wall of the garden and on the
  other by a wire fence. Along this he crept, pausing every few paces to
  listen. Presently he was within a few yards of the road. He calculated that
  he must be opposite the spot where the shadow fell. The purr of a motor car
  growing fainter and fainter. He reached the road and looked left and
  right.</p>

  <p>The road was very straight; half a mile away he saw a speck of red
  light&mdash;the tail light of a car, and as he looked, it went out of sight.
  The automatic was in his left hand now: he was taking no chances.</p>

  <p>Nobody was there&mdash;not even in the black shadows of the trees in front
  of him. They had gone. He stepped into the middle of the road, the moonlight
  reflected on the polished barrel of his gun. No sound or movement. The
  nearest house was a quarter of a mile away, and only congenital idiots come
  out at night to learn the cause of promiscuous shooting. Doubtless there were
  timid souls at this moment 'phoning urgently to police headquarters.</p>

  <p>Here, or was it here that Lenny fell? He took a chance and lit a
  match&mdash;dropped it instantly as the sound of pattering feet came to his
  ears.</p>

  <p>It was October. She wore an old coat over her nightdress and was
  barefooted.</p>

  <p>"Get back to the house!" he hissed.</p>

  <p>"Don't be a cave man," she said. "They've gone. I saw the machine drive up
  and somebody lifted in. I went up to my bedroom and looked out of the window.
  It isn't as clever as climbing the garden wall, but you see a lot more. Is
  this the knife?" She held a long-bladed, wicked-looking hunting knife in her
  hand. "It was sticking in a tree&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He raised his hand in warning and listened.</p>

  <p>"That's the patrol wagon," he said, and they ran to the house and closed
  the door. Miss Ellen, waiting like a wilting ghost in the gloomy hall, rubbed
  her thin hands together nervously.</p>

  <p>"Will they come here?" she asked, when he told her.</p>

  <p>"They may inquire&mdash;you had best tell them that you heard the shots.
  October can go back to her room. I don't imagine that they will wish to
  search the house. If you went down to the gate that might save a lot of
  trouble."</p>

  <p>She nodded; she had nerve and to spare. So it came about that when the
  police arrived, and behind them a dozen or so residents in the neighbourhood,
  Miss Ellen was able to give the only authentic story of the shooting.</p>

  <p>"Didn't see any of 'em, did you?" asked the police sergeant, for Miss
  Ellen claimed to have been a witness from her bedroom window. "One a
  red-bearded guy? He was in Ogdensburg this afternoon."</p>

  <p>No, Miss Ellen had not identified a red-bearded guy or any other kind of
  guy. The police made a sweeping examination of the ground and found blood
  traces to confirm the lady's story.</p>

  <p>"Wasn't a hobo&mdash;feller in a brown suit, moustache waxed up&mdash;with
  a girl?"</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen had seen no such hobo.</p>

  <p>"That's certainly queer." The sergeant scratched his head. "Automobile and
  everything! Didn't see that either, Miss Evington? I'm telling everybody
  there's pain and sorrow coming to any bum I find with a gun&mdash;and that's
  a fact!"</p>

  <p>He went off to collect evidence from the other inhabitants. One had heard
  six shots fired&mdash;one had heard only two. The firing was all over in
  something under a minute: on that point they were all agreed.</p>

  <p>And then a discovery was made by accident. The mail box at the corner of
  the lot had been broken open and rifled. It was not a very difficult
  operation, for roadside boxes are not designed to resist the attention which
  had been paid to this.</p>

  <p>"A gang of mail crooks," concluded the sergeant vaguely.</p>

  <p>At long last the patrol wagon departed townward, the neighbours
  disappeared behind doubly locked doors, and Miss Ellen went back to the dark
  parlour.</p>

  <p>"They've gone! And the mail box has been broken open&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was shaking so that she had to sit down. But the indomitable woman's
  rest was short. She went upstairs&mdash;her father was still sleeping.</p>

  <p>There were wooden blinds to the parlour window; as a matter of precaution,
  Robin closed them before he lit the lamp again.</p>

  <p>"Go along and sleep," he said.</p>

  <p>October shook her head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't. Honest. I'll stay up till I feel tired."</p>

  <p>She lifted one bare foot after the other and brushed them clean of the
  sand.</p>

  <p>"Then for Heaven's sake dress," he said; "and dress warmly, because I'm
  going to say something to you that will make your blood run cold!"</p>

  <p>"This," said October, as she made for the door obediently, "this will be
  an interesting night."</p>

  <p>She was down in a few minutes, if not wholly, at least warmly,
  dressed.</p>

  <p>"Produce your creep," she said.</p>

  <p>He was pacing up and down the long room, his hands clasped behind him. She
  wondered why he frowned and whether there was really something serious to
  hear.</p>

  <p>"Patrol wagon or no patrol wagon&mdash;Lenny dead or Lenny
  alive&mdash;those birds have not roosted for the night."</p>

  <p>"They will comeback?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir; sure as you're born!"</p>

  <p>"When you have finished being idiomatic in the Darktown manner will you
  please tell me why you think this?"</p>

  <p>He was laughing softly.</p>

  <p>"You've got a nerve&mdash;'Darktown manner'! I'll reduce it to good
  English. I'm too near the touch line&mdash;that's permissible&mdash;for
  Elfleda to let up&mdash;relax her efforts, I mean. She's that kind. There is
  only one thing that will stop her and it isn't a gun&mdash;but a fountain
  pen!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head, all at sea.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand? For the first time since&mdash;I've lost track of
  time&mdash;I am in a position to write&mdash;and I wrote. And they saw me
  mailing letters and duly reported to general headquarters, which was, I
  suspect, in the car. They went after the letters and got them. Therefore do I
  say that the night is still young for Elfleda!"</p>

  <p>"What did you write in the letters?" she asked curiously.</p>

  <p>"There was one important and vital sentence in the most important and
  vital of the letters. It ran somehow like this, and was at the
  beginning:</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"This is practically a copy of the letter I sent you from
  Littleburg last night, but I am scared of the first going astray."</p><br>

  <p>"<i>Did</i> you write from Littleburg last night?" she asked in surprise,
  and he shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;it was an inspiration to start with, that passage. The only
  question is: Will Elfleda call my bluff?"</p>

  <p>"But who was the letter meant for?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A friend&mdash;his name is Mortimer and he is, to be exact, a domestic
  servant in the employ of a lunatic."</p>

  <p>"I give you up!" she said in despair. "And my blood isn't running cold and
  I'm terribly disappointed."</p>

  <p>He suggested, unhelpfully, bed and a good night's sleep. She searched for
  the Scott, tidied away by Miss Ellen, and found it. Robin went back to his
  pen and ink and began writing letters all over again. The clock in the hall
  had a soft, musical chime.</p>

  <p>Looking up from her book, October counted twelve. Robin glanced round at
  her.</p>

  <p>"Is your hearing good?" he asked softly.</p>

  <p>"Yes&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer; his eyes wandered to the door.</p>

  <p>"There is a bell ringing somewhere."</p>

  <p>She heard it now, a mournful clang-clang, muffled by the interposition of
  many doors.</p>

  <p>"Do you think it is Miss Ellen&mdash;her father may be worse. Shall I
  go&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He waved her down, and was halfway to the door when it flew open. It was
  Miss Ellen, and her teeth were chattering.</p>

  <p>"Somebody at the door&mdash;ringing!" she gasped. "Past twelve; there is
  an automobile in front of the house."</p>

  <p>"Oh?" Robin's face was blank, expressionless. "Would you like me to open?"
  he asked.</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen's face was twitching.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I will open!" Her voice was strained and unnatural. "I will
  open&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She went firmly from the room; he followed her, signalling October to put
  out the light. In the open doorway he slipped his gun from his pocket and
  covered the door beyond the unconscious Ellen Evington. A rattle of chain and
  the creak of the lock.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"A lady who wishes to see Mr. Robin Beausere."</p>

  <p>Robin nearly let his pistol fall in his astonishment.</p>

  <p>For the woman who spoke was Lady Georgina!</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13"
     name="ch13"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

  <p class="first">"LET her in!" he whispered, and stepped back into the
  parlour. Fortunately, October had only turned the lamp low and light was
  restored.</p>

  <p>Georgina was alone: he saw this when her tall figure was silhouetted
  against the open doorway.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Elfleda," he said, and stepped aside to let her pass.</p>

  <p>In her white-gloved hands she carried a pair of lorgnettes. She raised
  them and favoured October with a long and steady scrutiny, and such was the
  girl's disposition and balance that she grew neither angry nor embarrassed
  under the ordeal, but gave gravity for insolence.</p>

  <p>"Is this&mdash;the girl?"</p>

  <p>"That is my wife&mdash;yes," he answered quietly.</p>

  <p>"Really!"</p>

  <p>An ironical politeness can be very offensive. And yet Georgina had no
  desire to be offensive. She came bearing large flags of truce with an ink-wet
  deed of armistice ready for his signature. Literally, she carried in the
  shagreen bag that dangled from her wrist a document which represented both
  armistice and lopsided reparation.</p>

  <p>"I should like a talk with you&mdash;alone," she said.</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen stood with folded hands just inside the room. She faded away at
  the words.</p>

  <p>"Would you like me to go?" October needed only the agreement in his eyes
  to follow her hostess. Robin closed the door.</p>

  <p>"Now, my lady," he said, "won't you sit down?"</p>

  <p>Georgina declined with a gesture.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are going back to Canada?" she began conventionally.</p>

  <p>"I hope so," he said. He was very careful in the choice of words. "You
  have read my letter?"</p>

  <p>Her eyebrows rose.</p>

  <p>"I do not remember that you wrote to me."</p>

  <p>"I didn't; I can't remember when I wrote last to you. But I gather that
  you have read my letter."</p>

  <p>She ignored the question; indeed, it was one not to be answered without
  placing herself at a great disadvantage, and just now it was necessary that
  she should maintain command of a very delicate situation.</p>

  <p>"Robin, I am in all sorts of trouble. You know that. Methway Court to keep
  up, Alan to provide for&mdash;the boy ought to be married&mdash;the house in
  North Audley Street, that simply eats money and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Current expenses?" he suggested when she paused. "They must be fairly
  heavy. I do not know what is the current rate for gunmen, but it must be
  heavy. Even the second-rate yegg is expensive, I should imagine. You are
  feudal-minded, Georgina. I have often wondered why your ginger-bearded
  retainer doesn't wear your badge on his chest&mdash;three leopards couchant
  on a field or, isn't it? Lenny would look fine in a suit of armour carrying
  your flaming banner."</p>

  <p>She accepted his banter without visible resentment. He could admire her
  without reservations, having discounted her peculiar morals. Sixty and as
  straight as a lance. Fascinating, too, with her wonderful eyes as black as
  night and as fathomless. The Roman nose had a quality of its own; less in
  evidence, she would have been a beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>"You interrupted me, Robin."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry!"</p>

  <p>She laid the shagreen bag on the table where he had been writing, took out
  a folded slip of paper and smoothed it flat.</p>

  <p>"I cannot help feeling that you blame me, Robin, for all the stupid things
  that have happened since&mdash;since the night I called on you. That seems a
  long time ago, doesn't it? It was most unfortunate that you should have seen
  Alan in Schenectady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But fortunate for him that I have not seen him since."</p>

  <p>His voice was silky; he was smiling. She shivered a little, knowing the
  Beausere family rather well. One had had his head lopped off on Tower Hill
  with just that smile, and was still enjoying his private jest when the
  headman exhibited his trophy to a half-frozen crowd of sightseers. Another
  smiled that way before Richard of Gloucester even as Duke Clarence struck him
  down. And they had smiled their way out of dangers and into dangers. They
  were deadliest when they were most cheerful.</p>

  <p>"Alan can look after himself. He is not exactly a coward. A
  fool&mdash;yes. But no man of my blood is a coward."</p>

  <p>Yet he had shaken her. She had experienced a spasm of fear, and he knew
  it.</p>

  <p>"There are divers expressions of cowardice. We won't go into the ethics of
  this business."</p>

  <p>He had seen the slip of paper she had smoothed open on the writing table.
  The colour and shape were familiar. But he said nothing, waiting for her to
  explain a visit that now needed no explanation.</p>

  <p>"Shall I be very frank, Robin?" He inclined his head. "I want to get back
  to Europe. My agents have found a delightful villa for me at Cannes. I shall
  sell the Court and rent the house in London. But I have a fearful number of
  bills to pay, and some of my creditors are getting unpleasant. I wish to
  start with a clean slate, and that can only be done if you will help me."</p>

  <p>"To what extent?"</p>

  <p>She picked up the check; it was already filled in, wanted nothing but a
  signature. The sum was a very large one. He smiled again and handed back the
  paper.</p>

  <p>"No," he said.</p>

  <p>He did not say that he was sorry, as he had said on one historic occasion.
  He was not sorry at all, and he was honest.</p>

  <p>"No?"</p>

  <p>Her head hung to one side; the lips were tightened.</p>

  <p>"It means an awful lot of bother&mdash;for both of us. I should hate to
  see you in one of these American courts and the whole ghastly business
  exposed. Naturally, being what you are, it is unlikely that you would allow
  yourself to be arrested for murder without a fight. It would be perfectly
  horrible to hear that you had been shot down like a dog by some wretched
  policeman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Or gunman," he suggested. "Such accidents happen in a free-for-all fight
  and the murderer has the support of a righteous act. I'm sorry&mdash;I
  interrupted you."</p>

  <p>"That, I wish to avoid. I would like to see you ride in comfort over the
  border, without fuss or scandal. I suppose this girl means nothing to
  you?"</p>

  <p>She watched him keenly and would have been happy to have found a new and
  more effective lever.</p>

  <p>"We will not discuss 'this girl,'" he said.</p>

  <p>One shoulder went up&mdash;he knew the sign; he could have foretold her
  next words.</p>

  <p>"Well, there is nothing to be done. I hoped you would be sensible."</p>

  <p>There was no bargaining: she did not offer <i>quid pro quo</i>. She had
  come for a loan and it had been refused. That was the end of it&mdash;for
  her.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, Robin." She picked up her bag, stuffed the check inside, and
  snapped the fastening.</p>

  <p>"You're not in a hurry?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She waited.</p>

  <p>"The villa at Cannes&mdash;delightful! One can see you growing old there,
  an almost saintly figure. And in the Casino&mdash;a venerable and frugal
  gambler. Alan would find it irksome, but he could travel. What is the
  American equivalent to Aylesbury?"</p>

  <p>She was puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Aylesbury? You mean the hunt?"</p>

  <p>He showed all his teeth in a smile.</p>

  <p>"I am thinking of the hunted. There is a convict establishment at
  Aylesbury&mdash;for women! Have you ever thought of that as an unpleasant
  alternative to Cannes, Georgina? I went there once&mdash;line upon line of
  drab women in gray, walking in a circle and looking at the ground. The dead
  alive!"</p>

  <p>Lady Georgina did not blench; she raised her lorgnettes deliberately and
  examined him.</p>

  <p>"Is that&mdash;er&mdash;a threat?"</p>

  <p>"It is a possibility," he said. "I don't know. I haven't made up my mind.
  I admire you tremendously, Georgina. Your courage is beyond praise. There is
  a tiny loophole for you&mdash;it is in New York City&mdash;the narrowish
  entrance to a pier where the outgoing liner is waiting for the just and the
  unjust. Write off your bad debts, Georgina, and trust to my well-known
  generosity!"</p>

  <p>She walked in her stately fashion to the door.</p>

  <p>"Good-night," she said.</p>

  <p>"Good-night. Will you please not make a noise as you pass through the
  hall&mdash;Dr. Evington is very ill."</p>

  <p>She swung round.</p>

  <p>"Evington. Dr. Evington?" harshly. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Very ill," he murmured.</p>

  <p>She looked up and down the parlour, a wondering frown on her forehead.</p>

  <p>"Here?"</p>

  <p>"He has just come back from hell," said Robin. "Thirty years of
  it&mdash;nearer forty, I should imagine. Think of it, Georgina! Thirty-odd
  years of tramping, riding perilously on the decks of fast trains, risking
  death and insanity on the rods, kicked, cuffed, jailed, begging from door to
  door for a hand-out&mdash;and all because some attractive young woman of
  aristocratic lineage desired the thrill of flirting with a simple professor
  of anatomy!"</p>

  <p>He had pulled off the mask: she had lost self-control and looked pitiably
  old.</p>

  <p>"You're lying, Robin! You've heard that stupid piece of scandal."</p>

  <p>"Were you ever in his house?" He saw from her expression that she had
  been. "Don't you recognize the place?"</p>

  <p>"Once&mdash;only once," she broke in. "I came&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She was half convinced.</p>

  <p>"The lady who opened the door to you is his daughter. You owe her a life,
  Georgina. The mother died a few years back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where is he? I want to see him."</p>

  <p>Robin was dumbfounded.</p>

  <p>"My dear good woman, you can't see him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I want to see him!"</p>

  <p>She threw open the door. On the other side of the hall she saw a light in
  the dining room, but before she could cross the tiled floor Miss Ellen was in
  the doorway.</p>

  <p>"Are you his daughter&mdash;Marcus Evington's?" and, when Miss Ellen
  bowed: "I am Georgina Loamer&mdash;Lady Georgina."</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen put out her hand to the wall for support. In the dim light of
  the little hall lamp Robin saw her face go whiter. October was in the
  background.</p>

  <p>"I want to see your father. Is it true he is here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." The word hardly reached the watchful man.</p>

  <p>"Will you take me to him?"</p>

  <p>Miss Ellen turned meekly to the stairs and led the way.</p>

  <p>"Why is she seeing him?" October whispered.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;I think I had better go up."</p>

  <p>He mounted the stairs two at a time and saw the Lady Georgina disappear
  into the doctor's room. The door was open; the old man lay on his back,
  looking strangely at the visitor. Miss Ellen, her trembling hands folded, was
  a picture of patience, of resignation, of sheer fatalism. In one corner of
  the room sat the aged maid, knitting on her lap, glooming over her
  steel-rimmed glasses at the visitor.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Julia!"</p>

  <p>Lady Georgina was sitting on the bed, one of his hands between hers. And
  in her dark eyes was such a look as Robin had never seen.</p>

  <p>"Marky!"</p>

  <p>Just that, in a husky, tear-choked voice. Robin swore softly to himself.
  He was dreaming, surely.</p>

  <p>"Why, Julia! Old O. used to laugh at my Apparition ... and here you are,
  darling! I always knew you'd come. We'll go west, Julia&mdash;glom a freight
  to Chicago an' deck the Limited. I know a grand place we can stop off&mdash;a
  hand-out in every street, hot coffee 'n' everything."</p>

  <p>He closed his eyes and seemed to be sleeping, but presently he spoke
  again.</p>

  <p>"This, gentlemen, is a typical case of intracranial pressure. You will
  observe that the patient..."</p>

  <p>His voice sank to a mumble, and when he spoke again it was of "Julia" and
  "the dam' shack who sapped" him.</p>

  <p>Georgina did not speak; she sat with his hand in hers, her eyes roving the
  wasted face. What story was here, half told? wondered Robin. He was never to
  know. Somewhere in the past of these two units of humanity was
  romance&mdash;peculiar bonds not to be translated to his understanding. The
  souls of men and women are outside all measurement; their secret hearts defy
  comparison with formulae.</p>

  <p>"Good to see you! Good to see you!"</p>

  <p>The old man's voice was very clear. Five minutes passed without a sound.
  Only Robin knew that he was dead.</p>

  <p>Lady Georgina came downstairs, her head held high; there was no trace of
  tears when she stood before Robin.</p>

  <p>"I shall not see you again," she said. "Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>He was mute. So much he might say, but all her barriers were up against
  speech. She hated him&mdash;hated him because he knew; hated him for what he
  was, for all that he represented.</p>

  <p>"Aylesbury. I think it would be more comfortable than a box car, or the
  roof of a Pullman on a rainy night, don't you, Robin?"</p>

  <p>He said nothing. She had concentrated upon him all the bitter malignity
  she felt toward a world that had been so hard to the pitiful thing she had
  left upstairs. He stood for the obstacle that had baffled her throughout her
  life, that had broken two hearts, thirty years before. He sensed this, felt
  unutterably sorry for her; yet had she at that moment presented the check for
  his signature he would have refused. But she had no thought of offering check
  or palm branch. War. The knowledge set him tingling. He would have laughed as
  he stood on the top step and watched the car pull away into the night.
  Laughed and wept, for she was making a greater appeal to his sympathy than he
  had thought possible.</p>

  <p>He closed the door and went into the parlour. October was in her
  room&mdash;which was all to the good. He unfastened one of the blinds and
  pulled up the window. The drop to the terrace below was a gentle one. On the
  window sill he laid his electric torch that he had brought from October's
  room. Drawing the heavy cloth curtains across the window, he took out his
  automatic, stuffed two more shells in the magazine and another in the breech,
  pulled up the safety catch and dropped the weapon into his pocket. Among the
  articles he had asked Miss Ellen to buy for him was a dark raincoat&mdash;she
  had hung it in the hall. He found this, transferred the gun, and hung the
  coat within reach.</p>

  <p>The hall clock chimed one; it had the sound of a knell. Robin showed his
  teeth in a smile; it was his one gesture of defiance.</p>

  <p>The handle of the door turned. It was October, and he had never seen her
  more depressed.</p>

  <p>"It is dreadful. But, Robin, this poor lady is wonderful&mdash;truly
  wonderful! That woman has gone?" He nodded. "Isn't it&mdash;unreal? And
  ugly!"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing ugly about love," he said, and realized he was being
  sententious.</p>

  <p>"I suppose not. Only it gave me the creeps. Not the death of that poor old
  man. That was too natural to be anything but right. But she&mdash;sitting on
  the bed and holding his hand and all the ancient ghosts parading. It was
  rather like seeing withered flowers on an ash pit and trying to reconstruct
  them in their beauty."</p>

  <p>"Tired?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>"We may have to leave in a hurry," he said, and she nodded.</p>

  <p>"I rather expected that. When?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Soon, I think. I am only afraid of one thing, that they
  come 'soft footed to destroy.' But that is hardly likely. We ought to hear
  the wagon in time,"</p>

  <p>"The police?" She was startled.</p>

  <p>"The police&mdash;the last refuge of the wicked. Gunmen do not grow on
  bushes or Georgina would pick a quart. I'm going out to sit on the doorstep."
  He swept up his coat. "Will you explain to Miss Ellen? And, October, get into
  everything that is new and wait for me here."</p>

  <p>He opened the front door softly and went down to the gate. The world was
  silent and mysteriously without movement. His yellow Palm Beach suit made him
  conspicuous&mdash;he pulled on the coat and buttoned it to his neck; the
  sleeves were too long for effective gunplay&mdash;these he rolled back.</p>

  <p>Not a sound.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed; the hall clock chimed the quarter. There appeared far
  away to his left two twinkling stars of light. Georgina's auto, he guessed.
  The lights grew brighter; to his ears came the hum of the engines. How near
  would she come? Not much nearer, apparently. The lights went out and the
  engines ceased to purr. The patrol wagon was noisier. He must hear this
  before he made a move.</p>

  <p>There it was&mdash;a harsher moan. He walked back into the house and
  closed the door. Miss Ellen was in the parlour.</p>

  <p>"Your wife has told me you are leaving&mdash;I made this ready for
  you."</p>

  <p>It was a packet of food; he thanked her and dropped it into his
  pocket.</p>

  <p>"We must go through the window," he said, and asked her to close and
  shutter it after them.</p>

  <p>As October dropped to his side on the stone flags he heard the patrol
  wagon distinctly.</p>

  <p>"This way."</p>

  <p>He took her hand. October had not touched his hand since the wedding, she
  realized; it felt very strong and capable.</p>

  <p>Through the tree belt, across the kitchen garden into the meadow. He
  helped her over the gap in the hedge. Somewhere a railway engine was coughing
  asthmatically.</p>

  <p>He stooped and looked along the road. There was a grade here up which the
  express that carried poor Baldy might speed at forty miles an hour, but no
  heavy freight would make that time.</p>

  <p>Still holding his hand, they made a cautious way along the ties. Presently
  they cleared the obstruction of the house and could see the tree-lined road
  from Ogdensburg. The patrol wagon had halted short of their objective. Men
  were tumbling out to the road. To go farther was to show themselves against
  the sky line. The track ran along the top of an embankment; there was a
  little culvert ahead over a small stream. Better to wait, he thought, and
  sought a hiding place. There was a small pile of railway ties, and behind
  this they crouched.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what this train is, but our only chance of escape this way
  is to find a box car with the doors open. If that fails us we must cross the
  track and take to the fields."</p>

  <p>The train was near now; the light of its powerful head light lit the
  bushes and trees that fringed the track. And then it came into sight&mdash;a
  white beam shot along the metals.</p>

  <p>"Wait till I say 'Go,'" he whispered. "Don't try to climb&mdash;wait until
  I have boarded the car."</p>

  <p>The engine grunted past. October could see the train crew in the light of
  the furnace fire. They were in darkness again. He touched her arm and she
  rose.</p>

  <p>Car after car passed, and then:</p>

  <p>"Follow!" he whispered, and, running, reached up and caught a steel rod
  and hoisted himself through the open door of the car. Instantly he turned
  and, reaching down, gripped her wrist and pulled her up, breathless and
  triumphant.</p>

  <p>Looking back in the direction of the house, he saw little lights flashing
  in Miss Ellen's garden&mdash;thought he saw a man running beside the track,
  but since the train increased its speed as it reached the top of the grade
  and began the downhill run, he thought he might be mistaken.</p>

  <p>"We're here!" he said grimly.</p>

  <p>"There is somebody in the car!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He took the torch from his pocket and flashed the light around. At the far
  end of the car lay two tramps half covered by straw. They were sleeping
  peacefully.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going?"</p>

  <p>It was the old question, and she nearly laughed at its familiarity.</p>

  <p>"I don't know&mdash;Ogdensburg, I think. We are moving in that
  direction."</p>

  <p>The train whammed on at a pace which he likened to a steady jogtrot, but
  there was no sign of Ogdensburg. Once, with a thundering rattle of bumper
  against bumper, they pulled up at a little station. Two men walked along the
  track, one of them swinging a lantern.</p>

  <p>"... found that bum yet? Yeh&mdash;murder! Killed another
  bum&mdash;yeh&mdash;he orter get a medal from Congress!"</p>

  <p>They were discussing tramps as they came back.</p>

  <p>"Got two in here&mdash;look."</p>

  <p>He sent the light of his lantern toward the sleeping hobos. October
  squeezed herself tight against the wall. Robin had chosen the other end of
  the car, and the two men did not look in their direction. The lantern was
  withdrawn.</p>

  <p>"What's the use? You ditch 'em and likely enough they gang up against you
  and one fine night it's 'Joe Smith, aged 38. No flowers.' Let 'em sleep. The
  yard sleuth's job, not mine."</p>

  <p>The train moved on for a few miles and then stopped. Looking out, Robin
  saw a man with a red lamp walking down the track toward the engine in the
  blinding light of the headlight. A gaitered police officer!</p>

  <p>He imparted the news to the girl.</p>

  <p>"He's come on a motorcycle," he surmised.</p>

  <p>He pulled open the big door on the far side of the car and dropped to the
  track, and in another second she had joined him. There was no station
  building in sight, but a hundred yards in front of the engine he saw a level
  crossing. The cycle would be there&mdash;he almost imagined that he could see
  the light of it. They reached the sandy ditch by the side of the track and,
  leading the way, Robin crawled toward the head of the train. He could hear
  voices above the hiss of the escaping steam&mdash;a volley of "Is that so's?"
  and "Yes, sirs." He remembered Lenny and grinned.</p>

  <p>The sound of steam stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"... only one car that's empty&mdash;all the others are sealed ... two
  bums, but I've had 'em since Littleburg."</p>

  <p>Sound of heavy feet plodding along the track side. The engine crew were
  leaning out of the cab that they might miss nothing&mdash;their backs were
  toward the fugitives.</p>

  <p>The danger was the headlight. It threw a beam that covered both tracks,
  but the ditch became deeper, and by stooping they could keep their heads
  below its edge. Walking was difficult. They were tramping through mud; their
  feet became entangled with coarse water grasses. Robin found a deep mud-hole
  and sank up to his knees.</p>

  <p>"Farewell, Palm Beach!" he groaned, as he guided her past the trap. The
  crossing was a dozen yards away, and there was no sign of a motorcycle. "We
  can't expect everything," said Robin philosophically, and at that second the
  rays of the headlight were reflected dimly on polished steel. It was on the
  right side of the road, too&mdash;they need not cross the track.</p>

  <p>He climbed up the steep bank, pulling her with him.</p>

  <p>"You'd better lie down&mdash;"</p>

  <p><i>Pang</i>!</p>

  <p>A bullet struck the wire fence on which his hand rested, and hummed into
  the night. The shot came from the ditch fifty yards behind them. October saw
  the flash.</p>

  <p>"Run!"</p>

  <p>She was on her knees, but he jerked her to her feet and, stooping, they
  flew.</p>

  <p><i>Pang</i>!</p>

  <p>Robin stumbled forward&mdash;her heart stood still.</p>

  <p>"Nothing&mdash;caught me a clip on the head, but nothing."</p>

  <p>He was under cover, tinkering furiously with the big motorcycle.</p>

  <p>"Give me the pistol."</p>

  <p>He handed it to her without a word and she crept forward. A man was
  running along the track toward them, but her eyes were only for the hidden
  assassin in the ditch.</p>

  <p>And then she saw him and fired. The force of the recoil startled her no
  less than the violence of the explosion. She felt her hand tingle hotly.</p>

  <p>"Come!" It was Robin calling. He was straddling the machine, its headlight
  burned brilliantly. "Up behind me on the carrier&mdash;hang on!"</p>

  <p>She obeyed, found a steel grill at the back of the seat and sat sideways,
  her arms around his body. He kicked at the starter. There was a splutter and
  bang and they glided forward, gathering speed.</p>

  <p>"Wow-w-w!"</p>

  <p>"He's shooting&mdash;the cop," shouted Robin. "Don't worry. Rotten
  target!"</p>

  <p>It seemed an eternity before the road crooked round and the railway was
  out of sight. She could see its reflected searchlight for a long time. The
  cycle behaved nobly; over his shoulder Robin shouted encomiums on its
  sterling qualities. They met only one man, an elderly gentleman driving a
  buggy, whose horse reared up and shied toward the side of the road. He hurled
  fierce imprecations after them.</p>

  <p>"Small town doctor," roared Robin. "Only excuse for man his age being out
  late."</p>

  <p>The wind tore speech to fragments&mdash;they were moving at a rate which
  made conversation a matter of guesswork.</p>

  <p>Apparently he had no route in his mind, but he told her afterward that he
  was following a simple plan&mdash;first road to right&mdash;then first road
  to left.</p>

  <p>"Red Beard&mdash;ditch!"</p>

  <p>She gasped.</p>

  <p>' 'The man who fired at us?"</p>

  <p>"Jumped&mdash;train&mdash;same&mdash;time&mdash;we. Thought&mdash;spotted
  him."</p>

  <p>He checked the speed of the machine and after a few minutes stopped. She
  was not sorry to leave the carrier. It was of steel, in pattern rather like a
  grid. Robin put out the headlight.</p>

  <p>"There will be a telephone within a mile of where the train stopped," he
  said. "By now the constabulary of the county will be looking for a lady and
  gentleman riding the wind."</p>

  <p>He picked up the machine and toppled it over a low wall into a field.</p>

  <p>"We are approaching," he said. "Did you see the billboard in that field we
  just passed? Billboards are the heralds of civilized communities."</p>

  <p>He stooped, and with a stick scraped the drying mud from his
  pantaloons.</p>

  <p>"You were about to ask where do we go from here?" he said.</p>

  <p>"I wasn't!" she affirmed stoutly. "I've ceased to be curious. I should
  like to know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Where we are&mdash;so should I." He put up his head and sniffed. "Can't
  you smell it?"</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"The sea! You can scent it sometimes&mdash;it comes sweeping up the St.
  Lawrence. I can smell it now. Glory be!"</p>

  <p>She sniffled up the cool night air, but detected nothing that reminded her
  of the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

  <p>"We're near the river," he said seriously; "how near or just where I'm not
  troubling to think. I wonder where we can hide up?"</p>

  <p>They walked on, and, as he had anticipated, came soon to a collection of
  houses. Their character and appearance were hidden. No wandering policeman
  was encountered, and they emerged into the country again in five minutes.</p>

  <p>"The name of that thriving city might have helped us if we knew it," he
  said. "There was a shop that sold fishing tackle; did you notice that?"</p>

  <p>She hadn't, and marvelled that he could have made such a discovery in the
  darkness.</p>

  <p>They stopped at the fork and decided to take the left-hand road. It seemed
  the less cared for. It proved to be a cheerless way. A wind sprang up before
  dawn, and there was a nip in it that chilled his thinly covered legs.</p>

  <p>".... if I might mention anything so indelicate."</p>

  <p>He could mention anything without protest from October. Her own legs were
  aching; she had an overwhelming desire to sleep, and had he suggested that
  they should lie down in the middle of the road, she would have offered no
  objection.</p>

  <p>The sky had clouded over, they saw, with the coming of the first gray
  light in the sky. On and on they trudged along the uneven road. Twice he
  stopped to let her rest&mdash;the second time he had to shake her awake. She
  was apologetic in a sleepy way and tried to be brightly conversational.</p>

  <p>"An intensive education in movie cliches tells me that you will turn out
  to be a secret service man who is flying from a gang of international war
  makers," she said. "You have the secret plans of&mdash;of the next war in the
  heel of your shoe, or maybe concealed in your vest; with a golden badge that
  you've only to show to the police chief to&mdash;to&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Get a good cigar," he humoured her. "No, I'm nothing so romantic."</p>

  <p>"Then you're the heir to a great fortune that Lady Thingummy wants. You
  have a fleur-de-lis tattooed on your right arm."</p>

  <p>"Heir to the ages&mdash;no. The only person who could die and leave me
  something is Georgina. And I'll bet she won't. Try another."</p>

  <p>"I can't&mdash;I'm talking nonsense. You're Mr. Tramp and I'm Mrs. Tramp
  and we'll wake in the lock-up and I shall be petted by the Society for the
  Protection of Lady Hobos."</p>

  <p>She scarcely realized that he had guided her from the main road and that
  they were trudging through one of his favourite lanes.</p>

  <p>She was sleeping on her feet, her arm linked in his, when she became
  conscious that they had stopped. She stared stupidly at a narrow stream of
  black-looking water. Moored to the bank was a long black scow. There was
  light enough to see a man curled up on the bank under a gaily coloured
  blanket. When they came up to him they saw he was black, and that his
  dazzling bedspread was only one of many. Near by were the ashes of a fire, an
  old tin kettle blackened with much use, and a grub box. But neither kettle
  nor food was responsible for his deep and stertorous sleep.</p>

  <p>Robin picked up the empty bottle and sniffed.</p>

  <p>"Guaranteed to kill at fifty yards," he said. "Snowball has been enjoying
  a solitary jag."</p>

  <p>Between the bank and the scow was a plank; he walked aboard and looked
  round. The scow was empty&mdash;its usual cargo was coal, he saw. At one end
  in the stern was a hatchway which was unlocked. He made an inspection of the
  cramped quarters. Apparently this was the sleeping and living room of the
  crew. In the bow was a small compartment with a wooden bunk but having no
  evidence of occupation. It was approached through a sliding hatch, but the
  hasp by which the door was fastened had been broken off.</p>

  <p>He returned to find October sitting on the bank, her arms folded on her
  knees, her head on her arms. Lifting her bodily, he carried her across the
  plank, which sagged under them so that the yard of their progress required an
  extraordinary effort, and eventually got her into the close little cubby
  hole. Laying her on the bunk with his rolled coat under her head, he pushed
  the door tight and stretched himself on the floor, and fell into a painful
  sleep. In his dreams he heard voices shouting anathemas upon the heads of all
  boozing coons, the slow drag of feet, and a guttural, whining voice raised in
  exculpation.</p>

  <p>Thump!</p>

  <p>A heavy object fell on the deck above his head. He stared round, saw that
  October had rolled perilously near to the edge of the bunk, and pushed her
  back unceremoniously with his foot, before he fell off to sleep again.</p>

  <p>He woke with a taste of bitumen in his mouth, and saw that October was
  sitting on the edge of the bunk eating a biscuit. Her face was black.</p>

  <p>"There was a letter for you," she said, and handed down an envelope.</p>

  <p>"Has the mail come?"</p>

  <p>There was no light to read; he slipped it into his pocket.</p>

  <p>"It was wrapped up with the food," said October. "Isn't everything quiet?
  You look funny!"</p>

  <p>She began to laugh, quietly at first, and then mirth shook her.</p>

  <p>"If it is the coal dust on my face that amuses you," he said, "perhaps you
  would like to see your own."</p>

  <p>She had a bag and a mirror. Her exclamation of horror was pleasant
  hearing. He opened the hatch a little and peeped cautiously out. The banks
  were travelling past&mdash;the scow was on the move. Looking aft, he saw the
  coon sitting with a blanket about his shoulders, his head on his breast, one
  hand on the long tiller. He pulled open the hatch a little farther, got his
  head and shoulders out. Ahead of them was a little tugboat, and between scow
  and tug a hawser slapped up and down in the water.</p>

  <p>He went down to the girl, but the cabin was empty&mdash;a mystery
  explained when she crawled out through the narrowest door he had ever seen.
  There was a wash place there with a rusty little pump that yielded a trickle
  of water.</p>

  <p>"Which way are we going?" she asked in alarm.</p>

  <p>"That way," he pointed. "Whether it leads to the river or New York I don't
  know. We must lie low until night."</p>

  <p>He closed the door, and, visiting the wash room, succeeded in removing
  some of the grime from his face. With the hatch closed, the atmosphere was
  stuffy. October developed a headache and went to sleep again. Every hour or
  so Robin took an observation. Once, when he looked out, the scow was under
  the shadow of a line of big elevators, and he saw the smoke of
  locomotives.</p>

  <p>It must have been four o'clock when the tug ceased to haul. The bump of
  the scow as it struck the bank awakened the girl. Robin went to his peep
  hole.</p>

  <p>"We are taking more scows in tow."</p>

  <p>After the exchange of a considerable quantity of bad language between the
  captain of the tug and the coon at the tiller, in which the skipper was aided
  and abetted by an unknown called "Tom," who evidently was posted on the canal
  bank, progress was resumed. Robin dozed and dreamed that he was back in the
  Swede's house and could not leave it because before every door and window
  swung the body of the departed owner. He felt a pressure on his arm and
  woke.</p>

  <p>"We have stopped," she whispered in his ear. "I heard somebody ask the
  Negro if he had seen a man and a woman when he stopped last night."</p>

  <p>Feet sounded on the deck, booted, heavy feet.</p>

  <p>"What's down here, anyway?"</p>

  <p>The door to the wash room was a thick plank opening on hinges inward.
  Robin gathered up his coat and the girl's hat and bag and pushed her through
  the opening. He followed and, bracing his feet against the scow's timbers,
  set his back firmly against the door. He heard the hatch grind back and heavy
  feet tread the floor of the bunk house.</p>

  <p>"Nobody heah, sah. I done bin in dis cab'n an' outer dis cab'n all day,
  sah."</p>

  <p>"Where do you sleep?" asked an authoritative voice.</p>

  <p>"Me, sah? I sleep up for'ard sah. There ain't nothin' in my cab'n,
  sah!"</p>

  <p>"We'll go look, shall we?"</p>

  <p>"No, sah! No, sah!" There was terror in the coon's voice.</p>

  <p>"Hi, wait, nigger&mdash;you stay right here with us."</p>

  <p>There was a crash as the hatch closed and they were gone. Robin stole out
  and listened, heard later an angry colloquy.</p>

  <p>"Five pints of hooch under his bedding. Nigger, you'll get twenty years
  for that."</p>

  <p>After that an animated and interminable conversation went on somewhere
  near, but Robin could hear nothing. The scow must be tied up to some pier,
  for he heard the rumble of wagon wheels and the slow clip-clop of a horse's
  hoofs. The talkers were moving in his direction. Robin heard authority
  again.</p>

  <p>"Now see here, Byrne ..."</p>

  <p>Byrne! Robin dared move the hatch; the failing light justified the
  act.</p>

  <p>"... there's no argument. You get out of town. You're not welcome and
  that's a fact. I don't care what you're doing. I know, I KNOW! I'll get
  Leslie without any assistance from you&mdash;thank you! I know just all about
  it..."</p>

  <p>Robin did not catch Red Beard's retort.</p>

  <p>"Sure I am! Always glad of information, Mr. Byrne. You traced him to the
  scow, did you, yeh! I know all about the officer losing his machine. Too bad!
  You traced him to the scow&mdash;you're one fine sleuth. Well, he's not on
  the scow and never came on. Only thing here is hooch&mdash;and wood alcohol
  at that..."</p>

  <p>"Can't I stay the night? I'll leave town first thing in the morning.
  Listen, Chief&mdash;this bird got my partner&mdash;right through the leg. I'm
  sore's hell. And this bum is on the scow&mdash;him an' his skirt. He's
  somewheres round. I gotta instinct. Say, I'd give a million dollars to get
  him for you."</p>

  <p>They were walking slowly as he spoke; Robin did not hear the reply. More
  deadly than all the sleuths was Red Beard, for he had sources of information
  denied to the police. And he had the use of a fast automobile, could pick up
  the distinctive track of the cycle. It was not very hard to understand how
  this bloodhound came to nose along the trail. They had seen nobody on the
  journey except the old man in the buggy. Who had seen them? What homeless men
  had looked out from their sleeping places and watched them pass in the light
  of dawn?</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to do but wait," he said.</p>

  <p>October thought that he sounded rather middle-aged and told him as
  much.</p>

  <p>"Maybe. I feel a hundred. I don't know where we are, and we may blunder
  from the scow into the arms of a dock bull."</p>

  <p>There was a church clock near them. They counted the quarters until ten
  struck. Robin opened the hatch and closed it again quickly. Two men were
  standing at the far end of the boat, visible in a distant arc lamp. The Negro
  was one, the other he recognized though his back was turned. So Red Beard was
  back. That instinct of which he boasted had brought him. He was illustrating
  his words with his hands. He pointed down, he pointed first to one side of
  the scow and then the other, and then he turned round and it was the coon who
  pointed. And a Negro's gestures are expressive. By the slope of his hands
  Robin saw that he was indicating the cubby hole, then he pulled open an
  invisible plank and vigorously washed his face&mdash;pointed again. Red Beard
  was nodding. The Negro took a step toward the fore cabin&mdash;Red Beard
  caught him by the arm and told him something. All these events Robin repeated
  to the girl.</p>

  <p>"... the coon is firing a gun&mdash;Reddy has told him I am
  armed&mdash;Reddy is flapping his hand up and down as if he was saying 'Leave
  him to me.' Now he is leaving the scow&mdash;no, he isn't, he's going down to
  Snowball's dugout&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Reddy fades out of the picture!" she said wearily. "It sounds like an
  over-elaborated film scenario&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Somebody called "Bud" in a loud voice, and the coon came flying up to the
  deck&mdash;alone. He ran toward the hatch. Robin closed it quickly, and just
  then there was a thud on the deck. The scow bumped so violently that October
  was nearly thrown from her feet.</p>

  <p>"We're on the move!" said Robin suddenly.</p>

  <p>He could hear the panting of the tug&mdash;the scow lurched sideways. From
  the pier a man roared a string of rapid instructions, only the last four
  words of which could be distinguished.</p>

  <p>"Don't forget the bacon."</p>

  <p>Evidently this was a time-honoured jest. The Negro's roar of laughter
  filled all space.</p>

  <p>"Ha ha!" said Robin politely.</p>

  <p>He was sitting by her side and, reaching out, took her hand.</p>

  <p>"How did you know I wanted comfort?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Do you? Yes, I knew that. I am psychic. You have a forlornness."</p>

  <p>He heard her deep sigh and grinned.</p>

  <p>"Don't laugh&mdash;I'm psychic, tool" she said fretfully, "and I know you
  smiled. Do you realize that a week ago I had never slept in a haunted house,
  or in a scow, or ridden in a box car with tramps, or seen anybody die? And
  it's&mdash;well, crowding on me! And I feel that I'm going through life
  running away from something&mdash;the kind of nightmare you have after a
  bridge party&mdash;running away from a man with a knife, running, running,
  running until you wake up and turn on the light! Shall I wake up?"</p>

  <p>"Don't laugh&mdash;I'm psychic, tool" she said fretfully, "and I know you
  smiled. Do you realize that a week ago I had never slept in a haunted house,
  or in a scow, or ridden in a box car with tramps, or seen anybody die? And
  it's&mdash;well, crowding on me! And I feel that I'm going through life
  running away from something&mdash;the kind of nightmare you have after a
  bridge party&mdash;running away from a man with a knife, running, running,
  running until you wake up and turn on the light! Shall I wake up?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and you won't need to turn on the light&mdash;there will be sunshine
  and flowers and fountains playing and a brass band&mdash;everything the heart
  can desire."</p>

  <p>She drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"I don't see that&mdash;only horrid roads, and old sheds and box cars,
  tramps without end, hobbling along and to nowhere!"</p>

  <p>He dropped her hand suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You're shaking my nerve&mdash;and you mustn't do it, October." His voice
  was almost sharp. "I get panicky when you talk that way&mdash;when you feel
  that way. I just want to leap up on deck and shoot somebody&mdash;anybody; it
  is hysteria. Dash your auburn tresses, you've made me hysterical."</p>

  <p>"My hair isn't auburn," she said coldly, and then laughed and squeezed his
  arm tight. "I'm mean! I think I was depressed about Red Beard&mdash;I did so
  hope I had killed him! And then we could have sat side by side in court and
  cheered one another&mdash;the prisoner always gets the best seat in
  court."</p>

  <p>He laughed at this&mdash;rather more loudly than was safe&mdash;overhead
  he heard the creak of a shoe and put his hand to her mouth.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if he heard!"</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14"
     name="ch14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

  <p class="first">FIFTY thousand dollars are a lot of dollars, as Red Beard
  often said to Lenny. And Lenny had invariably replied "Thasso!" A few minutes
  afterward, he would grin from ear to ear, for he was a slow thinker, though
  an excellent judge of pace.</p>

  <p>Red Beard squatted by the Negro steersman, a cigar between his teeth, his
  arms clasped about his knees, and tried to imagine what they would look
  like&mdash;five hundred bills for a hundred dollars each, all spread out on a
  large table. It would have to be an enormously large table.</p>

  <p>He watched the dark country pass on either bank, his eyes glued on the
  chugging tug. The scow had passed out of the canal and was keeping to the
  central channel of a little river that alternately sprawled and closed upon
  them. She was due to meet the <i>William and Mary</i>, a collier out of
  Cardiff, and Red Beard anticipated no more than a pleasant trip and a few
  quiet hours to exercise his thoughts. And the most pleasant of these was that
  fifty thousand dollars are a lot of dollars.</p>

  <p>Now suppose.</p>

  <p>The worst of men have their dreams, and they are usually about money.</p>

  <p>Now suppose he had got that walking guy down at Schenectady, or when he
  was leaning on the gate taking the air. The thought thrilled him. Suppose he
  were on this very scow? Red Beard, though no Catholic, carried in his pocket
  a tiny silver medallion of St. Anthony, reputedly a great help in finding
  articles you mislay. He possessed all the superstitions of his illiteracy,
  and in a grip now safely deposited in New York at the Grand Central Station
  he stored innumerable charms, which were all cunningly promoted and degraded
  as their potency failed. But St. Anthony was one of the constants of his
  faith.</p>

  <p>He took it out now, rubbed it on the palms of both hands, and deposited it
  religiously in the depths of his pocket. This nigger talked of a recess
  opening from the forward cubby hole, but niggers are born liars and imagine
  things; and anyway, Red Beard had not thought it necessary to pursue his
  search. A thought occurred to him.</p>

  <p>"Bud, go along and see what's down that hatch. I'll take your steering
  stick."</p>

  <p>"Me, sah? No, sah!" Bud shook his head vigorously. "Dat place is sure
  ha'nted! Old nigger died down thah last time we was on the Welland."</p>

  <p>Red Beard tried to jeer him into making the investigation; but the coon
  was adamant. He said that the night after the old nigger man was moved the
  hatch was padlocked. Next morning the lock was broken. Another padlock was
  fixed and again was broken. According to Bud, this happened six nights out of
  seven. He did not explain that the only time it happened was when a shore
  thief came aboard in his absence, looking for loot. But Red Beard was
  impressed. He believed in ghosts and premonitions&mdash;pictures falling from
  the wall, and death tappings ...</p>

  <p>He stared forward into the darkness apprehensively, but after a while he
  mastered his uneasiness, and walked along the narrow side deck, standing
  irresolutely above the hatch. And then he heard the laugh, and his heart
  leaped. Going down on his knees, he examined the covering. A broken staple
  gave support to the coon's legend, but Mr. Byrne was superior now to
  superstitious fears. His fingers went gingerly along the slide. The hatch
  must be pushed toward the bow of the boat. If the staple were there it would
  be easy enough to fasten. How else might it be kept closed? His practical
  mind found a way, and he went cautiously back to the uneasy steersman.</p>

  <p>"Got an iron bar&mdash;anything!"</p>

  <p>Bud, perturbed and frightened, went reluctantly down into his sleeping
  hole. In a box under the bunk were kept the ship's tools, a rusty collection
  of axes, hammers, and chisels. From the bottom Red Beard raked out two
  crowbars of different lengths, and, armed with these, he went forward again.
  If the longer of the two bars had been made for the purpose, it could not
  have suited him better. With the claw fixed to the back of the hatch he
  hammered down the head of the crowbar against the prow post. Robin heard the
  hammering and, guessing its meaning, jumped for the hatch; he tried to pull
  it back, but not an inch would it yield.</p>

  <p>"Put your hands to your ears," he whispered.</p>

  <p>And then, from the deck above, he heard a hateful voice.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, bo!"</p>

  <p>Red Beard lay flat on the hatch and formed a trumpet of his two hands.</p>

  <p>"Think you'll make Canada this trip? Like hell you will&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Right at his elbow the wood splintered and flew upward. A second bullet
  snicked the tip of his ear; his face was smarting in a dozen places where the
  splinters had struck.</p>

  <p>He scrambled to his feet with a bellow of rage and whipped out his gun.
  Ahead of them was a great expanse of water, and as Red Beard fired the tug
  was caught by the swift waters of the St. Lawrence and swung round. From the
  little steamer's deck the skipper was shouting at him excitedly; the siren
  wailed; but Red Beard neither heard nor realized. Half mad with rage he
  danced up and down the little deck, his gun whirling.</p>

  <p>"I'll fix you, I'll fix you!"</p>

  <p>Again the pistol banged, but by now Robin had taken cover with the girl
  behind the stout plank.</p>

  <p>Back to the stern and the alarmed Bud the gunman raced, vanished into the
  little cabin. The steersman heard the rattle and crash of the tool box being
  overturned, and then the half-demented man came out carrying a rusty ax.</p>

  <p>"Boss, fo' de Lawd's sake, what you gwine ter do? Boss, I'll get fired for
  dis, sure!"</p>

  <p>But Red Beard swept him aside. The tug was panting against the stream; the
  hawser that held the scow was taut. With two blows he severed the rope, and
  without pause dropped down into the broad flat bottom of the scow. Crash! The
  ax fell on the floor, and as he lugged it back, a thin plank came up,
  revealing the black ribs and a layer of black water that covered the outer
  skin of this decrepit craft.</p>

  <p>Bud was dancing to and fro, working the tiller first this way and then
  that in his frenzy as the scow drifted in circles to the centre of the
  stream. The ax was useless&mdash;the bilge water was too deep. Red Beard
  clambered up to the foredeck and searched for the short crowbar, found it,
  and returning down, drove through the water to the bottom of the boat.</p>

  <p>Only then did the Negro steersman realize what he was doing. He dropped
  his tiller with a yell, and made a wild jump into the well of the boat.</p>

  <p>Red Beard's back straightened and his gun drove out.</p>

  <p>"Stay where you are, nigger!"</p>

  <p>"For Gawd's sake, boss. I cain't swim."</p>

  <p>"Get back&mdash;quick!" He fired a shot at the coon's foot and Bud
  clambered out of the well with a wild howl.</p>

  <p>The wood was old and soggy; every blow of the sharp claw dug deeply into
  its rottenness. Panting, blinded with the perspiration which ran down his
  face at his unusual exertion, Red Beard drove down the bar and felt it slip
  through. Water bubbled up noisily; he struck again, breaking off the edges of
  the hole he had made. The river was above his ankles when he climbed to the
  after-deck.</p>

  <p>He pushed the petrified steersman aside, dragging back the tiller so that
  the scow headed for the shore. The scow lurched sideways, turning round and
  round, now stern first, now broadside to the stream, but all the time edging
  toward the dark shore. In the well the water was rising slowly, bringing with
  it the loose deck boards that had covered its floor.</p>

  <p>"I cain't swim, I cain't swim!" sobbed Bud.</p>

  <p>"Shut up!" snapped Red Beard savagely. "When we hit the bank, jump!"</p>

  <p>Nearer and nearer to the shore the water-logged craft circled. She was so
  heavily water-logged that she no longer responded to the rudder. Red Beard
  made a mental calculation and guessed that, by now, the people in the fore
  cabin had water up to their waists. Another and a stronger eddy caught them
  and brought the stern of the scow within a few feet of the bank. He had
  judged well. There was a grinding thump and, with a scream of terror, Bud
  shot through the air like something released from a catapult, tumbled onto
  the steep bank and, by a superhuman effort, dragged himself to land.</p>

  <p>Red Beard's departure was more dignified. He literally stepped from the
  rudder top to earth, and save for wet feet suffered no inconvenience.</p>

  <p>The scow was drifting out again, and, as it drifted, sank lower and lower
  till only the rims of the stern and bow showed. Presently it passed out of
  sight. Red Beard put up his hand to his lacerated cheek, drew out a splinter
  with a grimace, and grinned.</p>

  <p>"Figured I'd fix him, and I've fixed him!" he said complacently, and sat
  down to recover his breath and to debate in his mind the important
  question&mdash;was Lenny entitled to his agreed share of the blood money?</p>

  <p>"Fifty-fifty's all wrong," said Red Beard.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>The first intimation of danger that came to the two people in the cabin
  was a gushing of water through the loosely set floor boards. At first Robin
  could not believe his eyes, and then, as there reached him the thud-thud of
  the falling crowbar and the gurgle of the inrushing water, the horror of the
  thing turned him cold.</p>

  <p>With the help of his lamp he made a hurried search for some means to break
  open the hatch. The plank that formed the door to the wash room seemed the
  only possible instrument, but the hinges were tightly screwed, and not all
  his efforts could wrench one loose.</p>

  <p>"We're sinking, aren't we?" asked October quietly.</p>

  <p>"It feels that way," he said.</p>

  <p>"Is the knife any good?" she asked, and produced unexpectedly from her
  pocket the weapon that Lenny had thrown.</p>

  <p>It was a clasp knife of peculiar pattern: the blade, as long again as the
  handle, folded over, its edge being protected by a narrow steel groove which,
  when the knife was in use, fitted into the handle. He seized this timely
  weapon from her hand and, snapping it straight, attacked the hatchway. But
  the wood here was at least three quarters of an inch thick, and although he
  had the advantage of working from the punctures which the bullets had made,
  there was little hope of cutting away sufficient to allow them to escape.</p>

  <p>By now, as Red Beard had calculated, the water was between waist and
  armpits, and the scow was wallowing first to one side and then to the other,
  and with every drunken stagger of it they thought the end had come.</p>

  <p>"Will the hatch slide in the other direction?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He examined the edge and saw at once that the wooden cover was kept in its
  place by a flimsy strip of wood, which was already strained and bent under
  the pressure of the hammered crowbar. Driving the knife into the wood, he had
  the satisfaction of tearing off a long splinter without trouble. A second
  slither followed. As he struck again he heard the bump of the stern as it
  struck the bank. The water was now up to his shoulders and he worked at fever
  speed, handicapped by the presence of the girl, whom he had been forced to
  put in front of him on the lower of the three steps that led down from the
  deck. He pried loose yet another jagged slip, and, planting his hands on the
  under side of the hatch, exerted all his strength and pushed. The hatch did
  not open, as he expected; it gave half an inch and then stuck. But that half
  an inch produced a result he had not anticipated. The iron bar fell to the
  deck with a clang, and, reversing the motion of his hands, he pulled and the
  hatch slid back. Linking his arm in hers, he dragged her to the deck, already
  under water.</p>

  <p>"Can you swim, October?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. How far and for how long?"</p>

  <p>It seemed there was no need to swim for any distance. As the craft
  careened round, out of the darkness on their left loomed a low bluff. In
  another instant they were in the water, swimming strongly against the
  current. A log floated past them, but they dived under it; and then, reaching
  out his hand, Robin dug his fingers into a clay bank and they slipped and
  slid up its steep and oozy face until his hand touched the thorny branches of
  a bush.</p>

  <p>October was the first to recover her speech.</p>

  <p>"<i>Now</i> where are we?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm damned if I know," said Robin, "but curse all intaglios!"</p>

  <p>It was the first time he had used strong language in her presence, and in
  the circumstances she felt that he was justified. But the intaglios
  again?</p>

  <p>Presently he gripped her hand and lifted her.</p>

  <p>"Walk," he said. "You'll be chilled to death sitting there in those wet
  clothes. We'll find a house somewhere."</p>

  <p>They struggled through the bramble of a little wood and emerged on the
  other side, to find there was a broad canal to cross. Along this they
  wandered until they came to a deserted lock, which gave them a bridge. Before
  them at the foot of a long hill they saw the lights of a considerable
  township. Presently, labouring across the fields, they found a road.</p>

  <p>"Once more we take to the broad highway," said October gaily; "and if this
  is Littleburg I shall scream!"</p>

  <p>"It is anywhere but Littleburg," he said, "but I thought I
  recognized&mdash;no, I didn't! But I've been in this town before."</p>

  <p>He felt in his pocket and his hand touched the sodden roll of bills he had
  taken from Lenny&mdash;who was the cashier of the confederation.</p>

  <p>"We'll go straight to the best hotel," he said firmly, "order a hot dinner
  and a hot bath."</p>

  <p>Somebody was walking ahead of them&mdash;a stranger like themselves, for,
  hearing footsteps behind him, he stopped and turned.</p>

  <p>"Say, mister, what place is this? I just landed from a scow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was Red Beard. Robin slipped his arms from his wet jacket.</p>

  <p>"This is the place you get off, Whiskers!" he said, and drove with his
  left.</p>

  <p>Red Beard fell with a crash, but in a second he was on his feet and had
  jerked out his gun. Before he could raise it a hand gripped his wrist and
  twisted it so painfully that with a yell the gunman dropped his weapon. It
  fell at October's feet and she kicked it to the side of the road.</p>

  <p>Red Beard was game, but he was no hand fighter. The third time he went
  down he elected to stay. Robin searched round for the pistol, put it in his
  pocket, and walked back to his enemy.</p>

  <p>"Are you insured, Byrne?" he asked. "Because if you are, I'm entitled to a
  commission from the company that took the risk. Ninety-nine cents to the
  dollar is your premium if you and I ever meet again! Do you get that?"</p>

  <p>Red Beard did not answer. He was counting his teeth.</p>

  <p>The end of the road brought them to the main avenue and to the rails of a
  trolley car.</p>

  <p>"We shall attract a little attention, October, but I can't risk your
  running round in damp clothes."</p>

  <p>The town was peculiarly constructed: it consisted of one main avenue with
  practically no houses behind on either side, and a large proportion of the
  buildings were devoted to the rest and the refreshment of man. There was a
  festive gaiety about these big boarding houses and little hotels which
  suggested that the community enjoyed only a seasonal prosperity, and this
  view was supported by the fact that some of the hotels were already closed
  for the year.</p>

  <p>The chill wind that swept down the long street was responsible for its
  deserted appearance&mdash;they did not see even a rural policeman, though
  there was a knot of people about the enticing and brightly illuminated
  entrance of the inevitable cinema.</p>

  <p>"The best hotel is any hotel," said Robin, "and this place looks good to
  me."</p>

  <p>It was a two-story frame house standing back from the road behind a grassy
  forecourt, and the open hallway, with its gaily covered lights, decided him.
  Across the broad transom were the words "River Hotel," and as they stepped
  into the warm vestibule a heavenly smell of cooking food came out to meet
  them.</p>

  <p>Robin searched for a bell and found it, and presently a stout little
  woman, with huge, gold-rimmed spectacles, appeared with the set smile of one
  who had profited by her contact with humanity. The smile faded at the sight
  of the two coal-stained and bedraggled scarecrows. Robin hastened to remove
  the unfavourable impression which they had created.</p>

  <p>"We've been picknicking on a scow," he said, "but unfortunately we didn't
  choose a clean one, and we finished up our trip by falling into the water.
  Can you give us rooms?"</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;yes," she hesitated, and then, with an "Excuse me," darted
  through a door and returned immediately with a large red-haired man chewing a
  toothpick, who surveyed them solemnly, critically, and appraisingly.</p>

  <p>"Why," he drawled, when he had found his voice, "I don't know that this
  hotel will suit you. Maybe if you go along to Mrs. Hodges, she's open all
  winter."</p>

  <p>"We're closing down to-morrow," jerked in the stout little woman. "All our
  boarders are gone and we have no staff."</p>

  <p>"We only want rooms for the night," said Robin.</p>

  <p>The big man chewed his toothpick with his eye on his wife, and Robin
  thought it a good moment to produce from his unpleasantly damp pocket a mass
  of wet paper.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to have you dry this for me," he said, and at the sight of so
  much indubitably good money the big man was galvanized into a violent
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Sure I will," he said. "You count it out, because I don't want any
  argument after. Mother, you'll find a room for this gentleman and lady.
  Married, mister?"</p>

  <p>Robin nodded.</p>

  <p>"Two rooms," he said soberly, "and if possible two bathrooms."</p>

  <p>"We've got three," said the proprietor, with some pride.</p>

  <p>He came up to collect the money and told Robin that they were the only
  guests in the house. Apparently they shut down at the end of August, but this
  September had been so unusually fine that a number of the boarding houses in
  the town had dragged out their period of usefulness.</p>

  <p>"You'll be wanting some more clothes," said the big man. "Would you like
  me to 'phone up to the Universal and ask them to send you down some duds?
  Maybe your wife would like something dry?"</p>

  <p>It was an excellent scheme. Robin was hardly out of a scalding hot bath
  when a salesman from the Universal, happy to find customers at this dead end
  of the season, arrived with two big grips.</p>

  <p>"I've got a Palm Beach suit here that you couldn't buy in New York for
  fifty dollars&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No!" said Robin loudly.</p>

  <p>They dined in solitary state, he and October, in a large, overornamented
  dining room, economically darkened except for a lamp over their table. It was
  a well-cooked dinner, and after the feast Robin leaned back with a sigh of
  content and smiled up at the big man who acted as waiter.</p>

  <p>"If I expressed a desire for a pint of good wine would you send for the
  police?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I'd send for the wine. What would you like?" To Robin's
  amazement he produced a card with all the skill and aplomb of a conjurer, and
  like a man in a dream the visitor ordered a bottle of Clicquot. The landlord
  neither whispered nor winked, nor emphasized the difficulty he had in
  procuring the Right Stuff&mdash;which was surprising.</p>

  <p>That was the first remarkable occurrence of the night. The second came in
  more dramatic circumstances. They had retired to the hotel parlour, there to
  discuss the morrow, when the first hint of trouble came. Next to the parlour
  was the proprietor's office, and only a thin matchboarding separated the two
  rooms. Robin had heard the telephone bell ring before, and had been an
  unwilling eavesdropper to conversations which consisted of the unimportant
  exchange of intimate gossip that make up the life of a small community.</p>

  <p>The little Hebrew salesman who brought the clothes had told him that they
  were twelve miles from Ogdensburg.</p>

  <p>"In which direction?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I didn't ask him that. He was a very short-speech little man. I've never
  met a salesman that spoke less."</p>

  <p>He was rising to search for a newspaper when he heard the telephone bell
  ring and the proprietor's voice answer.</p>

  <p>"Hey?... Yes, Chief..." A long pause. "Yes, two people... that's right, a
  man and a woman. Say, wait a minute."</p>

  <p>He got up and closed the door of his office, rather unnecessarily, as it
  happened.</p>

  <p>"Yes, about an hour ago ..." Another pause, and then, in a tone of
  consternation: "You don't say! ... Is that so?"</p>

  <p>And then the receiver was hung up. They looked at one another.</p>

  <p>"The Great Highway, I think," said Robin carefully, and at that moment the
  proprietor came in and closed the door behind him. In his hand he had a
  half-dried sheaf of notes.</p>

  <p>"You'd better take this, mister&mdash;and get!"</p>

  <p>"I haven't paid my bill," said Robin.</p>

  <p>"Don't worry about that&mdash;you step lively! Killed a bum, did you?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head in wonder. Robin had the idea that the gesture held not
  a little admiration, too.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has squealed on you, son. I didn't oughter tell you, but the
  Chief's getting his gang together and the station house is only a block
  away."</p>

  <p>He personally conducted them onto the porch.</p>

  <p>"They'll come from uptown"&mdash;he pointed left. "You had best go right
  till you come to the fork."</p>

  <p>An automobile came speeding up the street and now it stopped before the
  door and three men jumped out. October clung more tightly to her husband's
  arm. Behind them the tall man stood in the doorway, blocking all escape from
  the rear, for under the eye of authority he stood for justice rather than for
  generosity.</p>

  <p>The leader of the three was a police officer of some rank. He walked up
  the path to the house, a gun in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Is your name Robin?" he asked sharply.</p>

  <p>"That is my name," said Robin, and added: "One of them."</p>

  <p>"We've had information laid against you that you killed a tramp!"</p>

  <p>"That's right, Chief," said the third man eagerly. "I seen him do it. At
  least, I didn't see him, but I know he done it!"</p>

  <p>The police officer cut him short.</p>

  <p>"We know nothing about this murder," he said; "no report has come through,
  but I must hold you, Robin, until the Chief receives instructions from
  headquarters. Is this young lady your wife?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Robin quietly, and the officer scratched his chin in
  perplexity.</p>

  <p>"Maybe she'd like to come along to the station?" he said, and without a
  word the girl led the way to the automobile. The machine turned and sped back
  through the town toward the little stone building at the far end of the
  street, Red Beard standing precariously on the running board.</p>

  <p>They were ushered into a large, bare room, where a man in a black alpaca
  coat sat at a desk. He looked up as they entered.</p>

  <p>"Is that Robin?" he said. "Listen, Johnny, there's nothing known about
  this bird. No bums have been murdered, no complaint has been
  made&mdash;headquarters say somebody has been stringing us."</p>

  <p>October's mouth opened wide in amazement.</p>

  <p>The man at the desk was scowling in perplexity.</p>

  <p>"Ask that R. C. sergeant if he's heard anything," he said. "The fellow
  that came this afternoon&mdash;if he is still here."</p>

  <p>Red Beard, hovering in the doorway of the station, shuffled his feet
  uncomfortably. He looked from the chief at his desk to a notice pasted above
  the stove&mdash;a yellow-varnished list of police "Don't's," which had
  escaped Robin's notice. Red Beard read and choked, and then stepped softly
  out into the street and out of the lives of these puzzled young people
  awaiting the solution of a mystery which, to one at least, seemed
  insoluble.</p>

  <p>"What is an R. C. sergeant?" she asked, under her breath.</p>

  <p>Robin shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Is it Roman Catholic?"</p>

  <p>A broad-shouldered man, with a clean-shaven, good-humoured face, strode
  in, saluting the chief at the desk stiffly. He wore the stripes of a
  sergeant.</p>

  <p>"This is the man," said Robin's captor.</p>

  <p>The newcomer turned, took one glance at the prisoner and his jaw
  dropped.</p>

  <p>"Suffering snakes!" murmured the bewildered Robin. "Where are we?"</p>

  <p>The sergeant looked at him oddly and grinned.</p>

  <p>"You're in Canada, my lord," he said.</p>

  <p>October thought that "my lord" was a piece of pleasantry.</p>

  <p>"In Canada?"</p>

  <p>Of course! She remembered now! The river was running to the right when
  they had landed.</p>

  <p>The man in the alpaca coat had risen and was walking toward the little
  group.</p>

  <p>"Then you know this gentleman, Sergeant?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The Royal Canadian policeman grinned again.</p>

  <p>"I ought to, Chief," he said. "I was his orderly for two years&mdash;Lord
  Rochford, Assistant Military Secretary to the Governor General."</p>
  <hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15"
     name="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

  <p class="first">The Chapter That Should Have Been First!</p>

  <p>ROBIN LESLIE BEAUSERE, fourth Earl of Rochford, ordinarily enjoyed the
  dances at Rideau House. But most willingly would he have foregone the
  function that brought him in the scarlet mess jacket and golden aiguillettes
  and all the gorgeous trappings of his profession to dance attendance upon The
  Great. For the morrow saw the beginning of his vacation, and he had planned
  to take the night train to Quebec, go on by boat to Chicoutimi, and begin the
  hike he had promised himself toward Lake Kenogami. His rooms at La Bonne
  Menagere were already booked; his steamer and train reservations taken, when
  there dropped into the city of Quebec an Important Military Personage with a
  passion for changing his routes and upsetting carefully arranged programmes.
  So that the dance at Government House took on something of an official
  complexion, and there were military secretaries in scarlet and A. D. C.'s in
  gold to add colour to His Excellency's state.</p>

  <p>The Important Military Personage had heard of Robin and his favourite
  hobby; he sent for him after the dances had started.</p>

  <p>"They tell me you're a great walker, Lord Rochford."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, I am something of a tramp," Robin laughed. And being also
  something of a judge of character, he dared confess his own
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"Great heavens, don't let me keep you from your infernal mountains!"
  laughed the personage genially. He was a very human man. "I'll tell His
  Excellency that I've no further use for you&mdash;you're attached to my
  august person, aren't you? Anyway, you are officially dismissed!"</p>

  <p>A joyous Robin went back to his little house at Majorshill Park. As he was
  getting out of his car a nondescript figure shuffled across the sidewalk and
  a whining voice advertised its owner's hunger with a passionate earnestness.
  Robin chuckled as he felt in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"You're a bad lad, bo! If the city police find you they'll sap you to
  death&mdash;and they'll certainly jug you!"</p>

  <p>He dropped a dollar into the outstretched palm, and his key was in the
  door when a thought struck him and he called the man back to him.</p>

  <p>"How's riding, bo?"</p>

  <p>"Rotten," said the man. "Them C. P. R. shacks are the hell's own
  fusiliers! I've seen 'em kill a bum up in Kickin' Horse Pass&mdash;well, not
  kill him," he amended, "but sort of killed him, if you get me. I'm thinking
  of getting across the river and deckin' the flier down to Albany&mdash;it's a
  lousy town for bummin', but I could get a job there."</p>

  <p>"Good riding!" said Robin, and left him.</p>

  <p>As he came into the hall Mortimer, his valet and butler, met him with
  surprising news.</p>

  <p>"I'm very sorry, my lord," he said in an undertone, "but her ladyship has
  arrived."</p>

  <p>Robin frowned.</p>

  <p>"Which ladyship?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Lady Georgina&mdash;and Mr. Loamer."</p>

  <p>"The devil they have!"</p>

  <p>He was not quite sure whether he was annoyed or amused. His last interview
  with Georgina, though it had ended with all the appearance of amiability, had
  left their relations rather strained.</p>

  <p>Lady Georgina was sitting before the flower-filled fireplace, and he
  crossed and took her hand.</p>

  <p>"Georgina, you're irrepressible," he said, and nodded to the
  small-featured young man who had effaced himself behind an evening newspaper.
  "And you're a provocative woman." He pointed to the cameo brooch she wore,
  not as a brooch, but as though it were the bizarre decoration of a knightly
  order, just above her waist.</p>

  <p>The Rochford intaglios are famous; there is no other collection in the
  world so complete. His grandfather had been a great collector&mdash;not so
  the Countess of Rochford of that time. To this vivacious lady, intaglios were
  stones of no particular value, and on the death of her husband she had
  presented to the youthful Georgina one precious Medici intaglio which two
  generations of Rochfords had been trying to buy back ever since.</p>

  <p>"Provocative?" She looked down at the gem with a grim smile of
  satisfaction. "An ugly little beast, Robin, but a thousand pounds would not
  buy it."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"I refuse to be enraged!" he said. "I'm starting on my vacation
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Your holiday. Why do you use these wretched American terms?"</p>

  <p>"I like 'em," he said carelessly, and then: "What are you doing in Ottawa,
  anyway?"</p>

  <p>Her ladyship glanced at her son.</p>

  <p>"We are on our way home; we've been staying at the Sullivans' house in New
  York. Alan wished to go straight on to Quebec, but I had a duty to
  perform."</p>

  <p>"And I'll bet it was an unpleasant one, you look so happy about it," said
  Robin.</p>

  <p>"All duties are unpleasant." She had a long feather fan and could use it
  effectively. "This particular duty is to myself and to Alan."</p>

  <p>He did not offer her any further opening, suspecting what was coming.</p>

  <p>"Here is the situation in a nutshell, Robin. You are enormously rich and
  we are enormously poor. Alan is your second cousin and heir to your title and
  as much of your money as is entailed. In the circumstances don't you think
  it's rather mean that you should allow us to struggle on, when, with a few
  scribbles of your pen, you could relieve us of so much trouble and so much
  anxiety?"</p>

  <p>"In other words," said Robin good-humouredly, "with so much money running
  loose in the family, you feel you're entitled at least to a pension?"</p>

  <p>"You can put it as objectionably as you wish," she said. "But nothing you
  say can relieve you of your responsibility to the family."</p>

  <p>Alan Loamer was watching them, and the eyes of the two men met.</p>

  <p>"What do you say to this undignified suggestion?"</p>

  <p>Alan shrugged his shoulders, folded his newspaper, and put it down tidily
  on the table.</p>

  <p>"It is Mother's idea entirely," he said. "Naturally, I have no wish to
  live on charity, but I really think that you might help us a little,
  Robin."</p>

  <p>"Am I not helping you a little now?" asked Lord Rochford quietly. "I am
  under the impression that twelve hundred good pounds goes from my bank
  account to your mother's every first of January."</p>

  <p>Lady Georgina smiled.</p>

  <p>"How absurd&mdash;twelve hundred pounds! Of course, it is something. But
  remember that Alan is your heir presumptive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I may marry; why shouldn't I?"</p>

  <p>He marvelled that she had broken her journey to repeat all the arguments
  that had been offered again and again. This conversation was the same, almost
  word for word, as one they had had in London before he left to take up his
  duties in Canada. Written down, her words would read like a carbon copy of
  the long talk he had had with her ladyship in Paris three summers before.</p>

  <p>Before he could speak he heard a noise in the street, walked to the
  window, and looked out.</p>

  <p>"Poor devil!" he said, forgetting Lady Georgina and the glum heir
  presumptive.</p>

  <p>His friend the tramp was in the hands of the law, and seemed unwilling to
  accept the hospitality which the Canadian government were prepared to offer
  him, for he struggled to break free as he crossed the street.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" Georgina was behind him.</p>

  <p>"Only an old hobo&mdash;poor soul! And he'd planned such a wonderful hike!
  He was crossing the river tonight to deck a passenger train to Albany."</p>

  <p>He turned back from the window.</p>

  <p>"And now he goes to quod!"</p>

  <p>"A lethal chamber would be better," she said, helping herself to a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked in surprise. "They're a good lot of fellows. I've met
  them, been in camp with them. An amusing, romantic bunch of speed
  hounds!"</p>

  <p>"You're getting rather American, aren't you?" she asked. "Even in your
  sympathy with tramps."</p>

  <p>"I'm a tramp myself," he said, as he followed her example and lit a
  cigarette.</p>

  <p>She pursed her lips thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"He would have crossed the river, got into America&mdash;without a
  passport?"</p>

  <p>The idea of a tramp with a passport tickled him.</p>

  <p>"Anybody could," he said. "If I cared to employ my vacation that way, I
  could walk from here to New York and back again. I know an Irish scoundrel
  who runs booze who would ferry me across the river and bring me back again,
  and not charge me a cent."</p>

  <p>She was looking at the thin ash of her cigarette with a thoughtful
  frown.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe that," she said.</p>

  <p>"You're very rude." He was amused. "You always have been rude,
  Georgina."</p>

  <p>"You could go from here to New York and back&mdash;how much money would
  you require?"</p>

  <p>"Fifty cents," he said promptly, "and I'd bring that amount back
  again."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," she said again. "It is impossible."</p>

  <p>He was piqued.</p>

  <p>"Would you like to bet?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"My dear Robin"&mdash;she made a weary gesture&mdash;"have I any money to
  bet with?"</p>

  <p>She fingered her brooch absently and he rose to the bait.</p>

  <p>"I'll bet you a thousand pounds to your intaglio that I make the round
  trip," he said. "I'd love it! The very thought of it is like a tonic!"</p>

  <p>For a long time she stared at him, uttering no word.</p>

  <p>"A thousand pounds to my intaglio&mdash;I want a thousand pounds badly!
  I'll bet you, Robin!"</p>

  <p>And all the time she was thinking with a rapidity which would have amazed
  him had he known.</p>

  <p>Robin left next morning at five, just after the dawn broke, but her
  ladyship and her son were already on their way to Chicago by the night
  express; for there she knew a high police official who was personally
  acquainted with every bad man in the State of Illinois.</p>

  <p>* * *</p>

  <p>There is a broad porch behind Lord Rochford's house&mdash;and if you know
  Ottawa it is the easiest house in Canada to locate, because of the big blue
  Chinese bowls that are filled with red geraniums that flower at the
  front&mdash;and from this comfortable place of dreaming you look across
  Ottawa River and can see above the rectangles of the modern architects the
  twin towers of Notre Dame.</p>

  <p>It was proof of Robin's eccentricity that he lived so far from Rideau
  House, which is popularly supposed to be the Hub of Canada's universe, but he
  had his peculiarities. It was far enough from Rideau House, and it was at
  Rideau House that he was sleeping at nights.</p>

  <p>"Which is absurd!" said October.</p>

  <p>"Propriety is my favourite weakness," he admitted.</p>

  <p>She turned up her nose at this.</p>

  <p>"Not that I object to living at this gorgeous little house&mdash;I'm used
  now to the smell of tobacco everywhere&mdash;but isn't it rather silly? Elsie
  or Marie&mdash;the maid you hired yesterday is already la-la-ing about our
  matrimonial troubles: she would be sympathetic for two cents."</p>

  <p>He groaned.</p>

  <p>"It is an awful long business," he said. "I have to make my inquiries in
  such a roundabout fashion. But we are married, I'm sure of that."</p>

  <p>"Well? Why marry again, Robin?"</p>

  <p>He drew up a chair to her side&mdash;they were on the porch at the hour
  when the twin towers were turning golden in the light of the dying sun and
  the Ottawa becomes a turquoise mist.</p>

  <p>"I've heard it said that girls like to remember their wedding day; to put
  away in lavender their wedding gowns and hide odd scraps of vegetation in
  cedar boxes."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Men like to have memories, too," he said gently. "I cannot even preserve
  the black eye I wore on our wedding eve, and though by diligent searching I
  could find poison ivy and, by allowing my beard to grow for a week, I could
  obtain a permanent photograph record of the bridegroom, it isn't the same
  thing as <i>remembering</i> the ceremony."</p>

  <p>"You were horrible!" she said thoughtfully. "You looked a tramp and you
  were a tramp and you were&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Intoxicated." His voice was grave. "I admit it&mdash;that is what I mean.
  I should like to be married once&mdash;sober."</p>

  <p>October examined him with interest.</p>

  <p>"It is rather difficult to remember you&mdash;even as you were at Miss
  Ellen's. When I saw you all dressed up this morning with those goldy things
  on your shoulder I somehow couldn't see you washing your shirt or borrowing a
  lady's watch to buy a suit of old clothes. Did you write to Miss Ellen?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"And did you send her&mdash;anything?"</p>

  <p>"I sent her back the statement her father signed on his deathbed," he said
  quietly. "It is of no use to me, and might be hurtful to his memory. Anyway,
  she will keep it."</p>

  <p>"Did you send her anything?" she persisted.</p>

  <p>"Money," awkwardly, "yes; but of course I couldn't say who I was. I think
  she knows. Do you remember when she said she had seen my photograph in the
  newspaper? I went across with the Governor General to see a man, a friend of
  his."</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"The Place Never Reached," he said, and she wailed.</p>

  <p>"Ogdensburg!"</p>

  <p>And then he became serious.</p>

  <p>"I've seen the G. G. and told him all about the great adventure and he was
  a brick! He insisted on having poor Baldy's statement photographed, and I
  believe he is writing to the Secretary of State at&mdash;Washington. They are
  very good friends. And I told him&mdash;I was married."</p>

  <p>A silence.</p>

  <p>"Did he burst into tears?" she asked innocently.</p>

  <p>"No, he was very brave about it. That was when he gave me the leave."</p>

  <p>She frowned.</p>

  <p>"Leave?"</p>

  <p>"Yes"&mdash;Robin tried to appear
  unconcerned&mdash;"the&mdash;er&mdash;honeymoon leave; it is usual."</p>

  <p>A longer silence.</p>

  <p>"That means we are married&mdash;officially," she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>They stared gloomily across the river, purple, now, and sombre.</p>

  <p>"That is certainly tough on you, bo!" she said ironically.</p>

  <p>"It's tougher on you," he retorted, and quoted from a recent headline.
  "'Mad School-girl Escapade Binds Her to Maniac Hobo.'"</p>

  <p>"Oh!" she said, and then: "Was it so mad?"</p>

  <p>She got up from her chair, seemingly intent upon the darkening landscape.
  Then suddenly she turned and, dropping her hands on his shoulders, stooped
  and kissed him.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," said Robin, and she sat down, but her chair remained
  unoccupied.</p>

  <p>"Dinner is served, my lord," said Mortimer in the doorway. Under cover of
  the darkness October arranged her hair.</p>

  <p>"Did the mail come?" she asked.</p>

  <p>She expected nothing by mail, but felt that she must impress upon the
  world he represented that she was very calm and very unflurried and
  altogether self-possessed&mdash;everything, in fact, that she was not at that
  moment.</p>

  <p>"No, my lady&mdash;I forgot to tell your lordship that Lady Georgina
  called ten minutes ago and left a little parcel."</p>

  <p>"Georgina!"</p>

  <p>He did not say what he thought, but went into the panelled dining room.
  The package was beside his plate&mdash;a small box pushed into an envelope.
  He lifted the lid and took out a card&mdash;and a tiny intaglio brooch.</p>

  <p>"With compliments," said the card.</p>

  <p>Robin breathed heavily.</p>

  <p>"The old sport!" he said softly.</p>

  <p>When dinner was through the man came to ask what time he was to order the
  car. October answered for him.</p>

  <p>"Lord Rochford will not need his car to-night," she said.</p>
