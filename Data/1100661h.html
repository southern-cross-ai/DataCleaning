  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap1"
     name="chap1">CHAPTER 1</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Jim Bartholomew, booted and spurred and impatient to be
  gone, sat on the edge of the table and watched the clock with a sigh. He
  looked too young a man to be the manager of the most important branch of the
  South Devon Farmers' Bank, and possibly the fact that his father had been
  managing director of that corporation before he died had something to do with
  his appointment.</p>

  <p>But those who saw in him only a well dressed young man with a taste for
  good horses, and imagined that his accomplishments began and ended with
  riding to hounds or leading a hunt club cotillion, had reason to reverse
  their judgment when they sat on the other side of his table and talked
  business.</p>

  <p>He glanced at his watch and groaned.</p>

  <p>There was really no reason why he should remain until the closing hour,
  for yesterday had been Moorford's market day and the cash balance had gone
  off that morning by train to Exeter.</p>

  <p>But, if the truth be told, Bartholomew lived in some awe of his assistant
  manager. That gentleman at once amused and irritated him, and whilst he
  admired the conscientiousness of Stephen Sanderson there were moments when
  his rigid adherence to the letter of banking regulations and local routine
  annoyed Jim Bartholomew unreasonably. He took another look at his watch,
  picked up his riding whip from the table, and passed into the assistant
  manager's room.</p>

  <p>Stephen Sanderson did just what Jim expected. He looked up at his manager
  and from the manager to the loud-ticking clock above the door.</p>

  <p>"In two minutes we shall be closed, Mr Bartholomew," he said primly and
  managed to colour that simple statement of fact with just a tinge of
  disapproval.</p>

  <p>He was a man of forty-two, hard-working and efficient, and Jim
  Bartholomew's appointment to the management of the Moorford branch had
  shattered one of the two ambitions of his life. He had no particular reason
  to love his manager. Bartholomew was an out-of-door man, one who had
  distinguished himself in the war, who loved exercise and something of the
  frivolity of life. Sanderson was a student, an indefatigable hunter of
  references, and found his chief pleasure within the restricted area which a
  reading lamp throws. Moreover he had a weakness, and this Jim Bartholomew,
  with his queer inquisitiveness, had discovered, to Stephen Sanderson's
  embarrassment.</p>

  <p>"The vaults are closed, Mr Sanderson," said Jim, with a smile. "I don't
  think two minutes will make a great deal of difference one way or the
  other."</p>

  <p>Mr Sanderson sniffed without raising his eyes from the paper upon which he
  was writing.</p>

  <p>"How go the criminal investigations?" asked Jim humorously and the man
  flushed and laid down his pen viciously.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you, Mr Bartholomew," he said hotly, "that you are making fun
  of a quality of mine which may one day serve the bank and its interests very
  well."</p>

  <p>"I am sure it will," said Jim soothingly, half ashamed of the provocation
  he had given.</p>

  <p>"I have recently had from New York, from a corresponding friend of mine,
  the threads of a remarkable case," went on the ruffled Sanderson, taking up
  an envelope. "Here is something," he said vehemently, "which would make you
  open your sceptical eyes in astonishment."</p>

  <p>When he was excited his voice betrayed his northern ancestry, and that to
  Jim Bartholomew was a danger sign.</p>

  <p>"My dear chap, it is a very excellent study indeed," he said, "and I
  congratulate you. Why, when I was in the Naval Intelligence Department, I had
  serious thoughts of taking up detective work myself."</p>

  <p>Again Mr Sanderson raised his eyes to the clock.</p>

  <p>"You'll be going now," he said pointedly and Jim with a laugh turned out
  of the bank.</p>

  <p>His horse, held by the ostler of the Royal Inn, was waiting by the
  sidewalk, and he mounted and cantered through the town and up the long slope
  which leads to the edge of the moor. Clearing the scatter of villas, he came
  at last after a stiff climb to the depression which was locally named the
  Devils Bowl.</p>

  <p>On the furthermost edge of the bowl a figure on horseback was waiting,
  silhouetted against the westering sun, and he shook up his mount and took a
  short cut down the rough slope and through the boulder-strewn bed of the
  hollow.</p>

  <p>The girl who awaited him had been sitting astride, but now she had taken a
  more comfortable attitude, slipping one polished boot from the stirrup and
  throwing it across the horse's neck. She sat clasping her knee, and looking
  down at Jim's awkward progress with a smile of amusement.</p>

  <p>Margot Cameron had the type of face which the black-and-white artists of
  France alone know how to draw. If she gave the impression of pallor, it was
  because of those vivid red lips of hers which drew all colour to her mouth
  and made the healthy pink and the faint tan of her face seem colourless by
  comparison.</p>

  <p>When you were nearer to her you saw that the red of lip and the apparent
  pallor of skin owed no more to the reinforcement of art than the mop of
  gold-brown hair (now braided sedately) upon her shapely head.</p>

  <p>Jim rode up, hat in hand, waving a salute.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," said the girl, dropping her right foot back into the
  stirrup, "that whilst I was sitting here there came over me, with almost
  stunning force, the realisation that you do work for a living after all!"</p>

  <p>"I keep office hours," said Jim smugly, "which is quite a different thing.
  If you have been in England all this long time and have not discovered that
  English businessmen do not begin work until ten o'clock in the morning, that
  they knock of for tea at three o'clock in the afternoon, and go home at four,
  then your trip has been wasted."</p>

  <p>A gleam shone in the girls eyes. She did not readily smile, and if
  laughing had been a habit of hers, such hours of her life as were spent in
  Bartholomew's company would have been a series of hysterical giggles.</p>

  <p>They rode quietly side by side for a time before Jim spoke.</p>

  <p>"Talking of hideous realisations," he said slowly, "it has been my day's
  obsession that I shall only see you once more after today&mdash;you still
  intend sailing on Saturday?"</p>

  <p>The girl nodded.</p>

  <p>"And you'll be away for&mdash;" He left his question half finished.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Margot shortly, "my future plans are rather
  uncertain. For the moment they are largely determined by what course of
  action Frank and Cecile decide. They were talking of buying a place in
  England and staying here for a few years. Frank doesn't like the idea of my
  launching forth on my own, otherwise&mdash;" She stopped suddenly.</p>

  <p>"Otherwise?" suggested Jim.</p>

  <p>"Otherwise," said the girl, "I might, of course, think of taking a place
  myself in England."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," said Jim softly.</p>

  <p>She turned to him.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't like me to do that, would you?" she asked abruptly and Jim
  was silent.</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted in that quiet way of his, "I don't think I should care
  for your taking that step. I should like it just to happen that you were
  here. If you weren't so infernally well off&mdash;I&mdash;I think your
  future might be planned a little more definitely."</p>

  <p>She waited, but he offered no explanation and she had not the will to
  demand one. They had reached the wild slope of the upper moor. Far away on
  the horizon like a tiny blue cloud was hoary Hay Tor, and beneath them,
  through the thin plantation that fringed the river, they glimpsed the silver
  fret of the Dart.</p>

  <p>"This is the only place in England where I can breathe," said the girl,
  snuffling the air.</p>

  <p>"You have our permission," said Jim graciously.</p>

  <p>He pulled in his horse and pointed with his riding crop across the
  moor.</p>

  <p>"Do you see that white house&mdash;it is not really a house, I think it
  was designed either for an emperors shooting box or a lunatic asylum."</p>

  <p>"I see," said the girl, shading her eyes.</p>

  <p>"That is Tor Towers. I suppose you have met Mrs Markham?"</p>

  <p>"Markham?" said the girl, wrinkling her forehead. "No, I don't think I
  have."</p>

  <p>"She is a compatriot of yours and another immensely wealthy lady."</p>

  <p>"American?" said the girl in surprise. "It is curious we haven't met her
  and we've been here for a year."</p>

  <p>"I've only seen her once myself," admitted Jim. "She is a client of the
  bank, but Sanderson usually interviews her."</p>

  <p>"Is she young or old?"</p>

  <p>"Quite young," said Jim enthusiastically, "and as beautiful as&mdash;as,
  well, have you ever seen Greuze's picture in the Louvre, 'L'Oiseau Mort'?
  Well, she's as beautiful as that, and Greuze might have painted his picture
  with her as a model except for the darkness of her hair."</p>

  <p>The girl was looking at him, her eyebrows arched with something that might
  have been amusement and was certainly surprise.</p>

  <p>"Tut-tut!" she said with mock severity, "this enthusiasm&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Margot," said Jim, and he really did blush. "I only saw
  her once, I tell you."</p>

  <p>"Once? But she made an impression apparently," nodded the girl.</p>

  <p>"In a way she did," said Jim, returning to his old seriousness, "and in a
  way she didn't."</p>

  <p>"I understand you perfectly," said the girl. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean I could admire her and yet there was something about her which
  left me with an odd sense of sadness."</p>

  <p>Margot laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"Of all ways to a man's heart, an odd sense of sadness is the shortest,"
  she said. "Come, let us get home."</p>

  <p>She turned her horse to one of the smaller roads leading to the valley of
  the Dart and the Moor ford from which the town took its name.</p>

  <p>"Wait a bit."</p>

  <p>Jim reined his horse to a standstill, and Margot Cameron turning back saw
  something in his face that set her heart thumping more than the exercise of
  reining in her horse justified.</p>

  <p>"Margot, I'm not going to see a great deal more of you," said Jim and his
  voice was husky. "You're going away and God knows when you're coming back
  again. And when you've left, this place which you and I think is so beautiful
  will be just a damnable desert&mdash;if you will pardon the profanity."</p>

  <p>She did not speak, but looked past him.</p>

  <p>"I think I'm staying on in this town," he said, "because I am probably
  doing the only kind of job that I'm fit for. And it is likely that I shall
  stay here for ever and be a bald old bank manager at seventy. I wasn't
  intended to be a bank manager," he said, with a return to his whimsical self,
  "it was never ordained that I should sit in an office behind a
  leather-covered table and call the bluff on people who want a thousand
  overdraft on a five-hundred security. It was intended that I should be a
  sailor," he said half to himself, "or a&mdash;yes, a bank robber! I have a
  criminal heart, but I have no enterprise."</p>

  <p>"What is this all leading to?" asked the girl, bringing up her eyes to his
  face.</p>

  <p>"It is leading to this one vital and important fact," said Jim, sitting
  bolt upright on his horse, a sure sign of his nervousness. "It means that I
  love you and I don't want you to leave this country in any ignorance of that
  point. Wait a moment," he said, as he thought she was about to speak (as a
  matter of fact she found a little difficulty in breathing in spite of her
  testimonial to the qualities of Dartmoor), "I know you'll tell me that you
  wish I hadn't told you, but after all you'll wish that because you will be
  afraid of my hurt." He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've got the hurt and I'm getting rid of a lot of my mind-sickness when I
  tell you that I love you. I'm not going to ask you to be my wife either,
  Margot. It would be unfair to entertain the idea of marrying you, even
  supposing you did not whack me over the head with your crop at the bare
  suggestion. I just wanted to tell you that I love you and that I'm going to
  work&mdash;I shall leave this grisly town...and some day perhaps..." His
  speech tailed off into something like incoherence.</p>

  <p>She was laughing softly though there was a suspicion of tears in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are a queer man, Jim," she said softly, "and now having proposed to
  me and rejected yourself nothing remains for me to say except that I will
  never be a sister to you and that I promised Cecile I would bring you home to
  tea."</p>

  <p>Jim swallowed something and then with a deep sigh stuck his heels into his
  horse and pushed him forward to the girls side.</p>

  <p>"That's that," he said.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if your that is my that?" said the girl, and went on quickly.
  "Now, let us gossip about the beautiful Mrs Markham."</p>

  <p>And of the beautiful Mrs Markham and other matters they talked until they
  passed through the stone pillars of Moor House, that quaint mansion on the
  hinge of Moorford which the Camerons had rented for the summer.</p>
  <hr>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">CHAPTER 2</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Frank, a tall handsome American of thirty-five, was coming
  back from the tennis court, and he greeted Jim and his sister nom afar.</p>

  <p>"I've had a visit from your assistant," he said, after the horses had been
  taken away and Margot had gone into the house.</p>

  <p>"From Sanderson?" said Jim in astonishment, "what the dickens did he want?
  Have you overdrawn your account?"</p>

  <p>Frank grinned.</p>

  <p>"Nothing so prosaic as that," he said. "No, it was on quite an interesting
  business he came. By the way he's something of an amateur detective, I
  suppose you know?"</p>

  <p>Jim groaned.</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" he said dismally, "he hasn't been up here rustling clues or
  anything of that kind, has he?"</p>

  <p>The other laughed.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," he said, "but a month ago he asked me for an introduction
  to a personal friend of mine. I happened to mention when I was talking with
  Sanderson at the bank that John Rogers, our District Attorney, was a friend
  of mine. Rogers has an extraordinary knowledge of criminals and has quite the
  best library on criminology in the United States. This was the fact I let
  fall to your Mr Sanderson and which resulted in my giving him a letter of
  introduction to John and his consequent visit today to see me. Apparently
  John has put him in possession of important data and Sanderson wished one or
  two matters explained&mdash;such as the functions of our State Governors and
  their power to grant pardons."</p>

  <p>"What is he after?" asked Jim after a puzzling moment. "He never confides
  in me, you know; in fact, I rather jibe him about his criminal
  investigations, and, in consequence, we are not exactly the most intimate of
  friends."</p>

  <p>Frank had led the way to his den as they were talking. He took up a sheet
  of notepaper from his table and read it over.</p>

  <p>"I jotted down a few items after he had gone," he said, "and really,
  Bartholomew, your Mr Sanderson isn't as eccentric as he seems. This is the
  point. There is in England at this present moment what he romantically calls
  'The Big Four of Crime.' Three of them are citizens of my own dear native
  land, and one, I believe, is a Wop&mdash;or a Spaniard&mdash;who poses as an
  Italian, named Romano. The fact that Romano is a criminal has been
  established. The other three, about whom there are known records, are a Mr
  and Mrs Trenton&mdash;Doc Trenton is the man&mdash;I've got most of these
  facts from Sanderson&mdash;and a particularly well-experienced forger named
  Talbot. These are the names by which they call themselves, of course, and I
  wouldn't vouch for their accuracy."</p>

  <p>"But what on earth has this to do-" began Jim.</p>

  <p>"Wait a bit," said Frank, "I want to tell you this much. I think your man
  has got on the right track. There's no doubt whatever about the existence of
  the four persons whose doings he is following. They are very much alive and
  kicking. The police of most of the countries in Europe, certainly the police
  of America, know them and their exploits very well, for at one time or
  another they have all been in the hands of the law: The work that Sanderson
  has been engaged upon, apparently, has been the identification of these four
  law breakers with a gang which, for the past year, has been engaged in jewel
  robberies in Paris and London."</p>

  <p>Jim Bartholomew nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have good reason for knowing there is such a gang," he said. "Almost
  every post from the Bankers' Association contains some fresh warning and some
  new particular of their methods. I suppose it was from these 'confidentials'
  that Sanderson got his idea?"</p>

  <p>The "confidentials" were the secret documents which bankers in all
  countries receive, not only from their own associates but from the police
  headquarters.</p>

  <p>"He told me as much," said Frank. "What Sanderson had really been doing is
  this. He has been canvassing the police forces of the world by
  correspondence, getting particulars of the jewel and bank thieves known to
  them and, when it is possible, their photographs. That is why I was able to
  help him with my friend the District Attorney who has written to Sanderson
  telling him that he has sent him on a batch of information and photographs.
  They hadn't turned up when Sanderson came here, but the American mail comes
  in scraps, as you probably know."</p>

  <p>"What is Sanderson's idea as to the future?" asked Jim, puzzled. "Does he
  aspire to be a policeman? I suppose he didn't take you that much into his
  confidence?"</p>

  <p>Frank laughed.</p>

  <p>"That is just what he did," he said. "As a matter of fact, he unbosomed
  himself of his ambitions in a most highly confidential way but as he did not
  extract from me any promise that I would not pass the information on I can
  tell you. I can rely upon you, Bartholomew, not to rag him?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," protested Jim. "Had I known he was taking the thing so
  seriously and doing such excellent work I would have given him all the
  assistance in my power."</p>

  <p>"Sanderson's idea, and his chief ambition, is to create a Bankers'
  Protection Corps," Frank went on, "and it is quite an excellent scheme. His
  plan is to take the likeliest men from the banking world, clerks and so on,
  and train them to the detection of banking crimes&mdash;and here comes Jones
  to call us to tea."</p>

  <p>He rose, and Jim preceded him from the room. In the hall Frank Cameron
  changed the subject abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I shall miss you quite a lot," he said, "and I am hoping that fate will
  bring us back to this delightful spot."</p>

  <p>Jim was as fervently hoping the same, but did no more than murmur a
  conventional agreement.</p>

  <p>"The voyage is going to do my wife a lot of good, I hope. She has not been
  quite the same since her sister died."</p>

  <p>It was the first time that Frank Cameron had mentioned his wife's illness,
  though Jim had had many talks with Margot on the matter.</p>

  <p>"She died quite suddenly in the United States, didn't she?"</p>

  <p>Frank nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, we were in Paris at the time. One morning we got an urgent cable and
  Cecile went back to New York next day&mdash;she insisted upon going
  alone&mdash;she arrived there just in time, poor girl. She has never quite
  recovered from the shock. It has clouded her life most tragically&mdash;by
  the way you never talk to Cecile about her sister, do you?"</p>

  <p>Jim shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No. I have never mentioned her, and it is not a subject I should care to
  raise."</p>

  <p>Frank nodded his approval.</p>

  <p>Margot had changed from her riding kit and was sitting in the drawing-room
  with her sister-in-law. Mrs Cameron rose and came towards him with
  outstretched hands. She was a stately pretty woman of thirty with flawless
  features and dark eyes that had always seemed to Frank to hold the shadow of
  tragedy.</p>

  <p>"Thank heaven, I've finished my packing," she said.</p>

  <p>"When and how do you leave?" asked Jim. "Tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"Early on Saturday morning," said Cecile Cameron, handing him his tea.
  "We're going by car to Southampton and sending the baggage on overnight. I
  want to stay here until the very last moment and it will be rather fun
  motoring in the early morning."</p>

  <p>"I have ordered fabulous sums to be at your disposal tomorrow," laughed
  Jim. "I don't know what my general manager will say when he knows that the
  bank has lost four such excellent clients."</p>

  <p>"Four?" said Mrs Cameron. "Who else is leaving beside us three?"</p>

  <p>"Mrs Markham of Tor Towers will be a fellow passenger of yours&mdash;and
  she's American, by the way."</p>

  <p>"Markham? Do you know her, Frank?"</p>

  <p>Frank Cameron shook his head.</p>

  <p>"She is not a New Yorker," explained Jim. "I believe she comes from
  Virginia. She is a regular visitor to this country and as a matter of fact
  she is coming back to us and has deposited her jewels with us&mdash;I wish
  she hadn't. I hate the responsibility of carrying a hundred thousand pounds'
  worth of diamonds in my vault, and as soon as the good lady is on the sea I
  shall send them up to London for safe custody."</p>

  <p>"Mrs Markham," said Frank thoughtfully. "It is curious we have never met
  her. Is she young or old?"</p>

  <p>"Young," said Jim. "I have never seen her myself, except at a distance.
  She leaves the management of her domestic affairs to her butler, a pompous
  gentleman named Winter&mdash;a typical superior domestic servant. Sanderson
  has conducted all the business dealings we have had with Mrs Markham, so I
  know very little about her, except that she is a most agreeable lady, has
  tons of money, is a widow, and spends most of her time painting sketches of
  Dartmoor. But I don't suppose you three good people will want any fourth, and
  certainly you'll find scores of friends on the ship. Have you a suite?"</p>

  <p>Frank nodded.</p>

  <p>"We have Suite B, which is the best on the ship, and Cecile has a great
  friend going out, Mrs Dupreid&mdash;Jane is sailing, isn't she?" He turned to
  his wife.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I had a letter from her this morning. You're quite right, Mr
  Bartholomew; one doesn't want a great crowd on a ship, and sea voyages
  depress me horribly. I don't think Jane Dupreid is going to be much of an
  acquisition to our party, Frank." She smiled quietly. "Jane is a bad sailor
  and takes to her bunk the moment the ship leaves the wharf and stays there
  until it passes Sandy Hook."</p>

  <p>The conversation drifted to ships and passengers and their eccentricities,
  and was mainly between Frank Cameron and his wife and Jim. Margot Cameron was
  unusually silent and thoughtful, and it was Cecile who drew attention to the
  fact.</p>

  <p>"You're rather quiet, Margot; what is the matter?"</p>

  <p>Margot Cameron roused from her reverie with a start.</p>

  <p>"How terrible that my silences are remarkable!" she said, with a little
  laugh. "I suppose it is rather like when the engine stops at sea, it wakes
  you up! To be perfectly frank, I was feeling a little sad at leaving this
  place."</p>

  <p>Frank looked from his sister to Jim and back to his sister again and
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," he said dryly.</p>

  <p>"I think I must be getting old," said Margot, "but somehow of late I hate
  change."</p>

  <p>"I rather dislike it myself," said Frank, "but either you or I have got to
  go, Margot. We have to settle up Aunt Martha's estate."</p>

  <p>He saw Jim's eyes light up and grinned.</p>

  <p>"That sounds as though we are going to make a short stay and then home
  again, but I really ought to see the mining properties I am interested in and
  that means spending the winter in California."</p>

  <p>Jim groaned.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said grimly "you'll find me here with the other permanent
  fixtures of the town, and maybe when you return you will find plates affixed
  to various buildings to commemorate your stay. I shall be a deadly dull
  man."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps a circus will happen along," suggested Margot helpfully.</p>

  <p>"There are two courses open to me," said the solemn Jim. "The first is to
  allow myself to get into the whirl of local gaiety and take up sheep
  breeding, and the second is to rob the bank and shoot up the town. There is
  every incentive to rob the bank," he added thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"The beautiful Mrs Markham's diamonds&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Why do you always prefix Mrs Markham with the word 'beautiful'?" asked
  the girl, not without a certain undercurrent of irritation.</p>

  <p>"For lack of a better adjective," was the cryptic reply.</p>

  <p>"Well, I shouldn't shoot up the town until we're well on our way," said
  Frank, passing his cup back to Cecile.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" said Jim suddenly, "what a wonderful ring!"</p>

  <p>He was looking at Mrs Cameron's outstretched hand and she flushed
  slightly.</p>

  <p>"It is lovely, isn't it?" said Cameron quietly "Let me show it to
  Bartholomew."</p>

  <p>She hesitated, then drew the ring from her finger and handed it to the
  visitor. It was a broad band of gold and had the appearance of having been
  cut rather than moulded. It was the design which had attracted Bartholomew's
  attention, and now he carried it to the window to examine it more carefully
  for the design was an unusual one. Three serpent-headed women, delicately and
  beautifully carved, every line of their sombre faces exquisitely modelled,
  though each face was not more than an eighth of an inch in length.</p>

  <p>He examined it admiringly, noted the twining snakes and a hint of wings,
  and brought the ring back to Mrs Cameron.</p>

  <p>"The Daughters of the Night," he said. "A beautiful piece of work!"</p>

  <p>"The Daughters of the Night?" Mrs Cameron frowned.</p>

  <p>"Yes, they are the three Furies, aren't they? The Roman deities who
  brought punishment to evil-doers."</p>

  <p>"I never heard them called the Daughters of the Night," Cecile Cameron
  spoke slowly as she replaced the ring on her finger. "The Daughters of the
  Night!"</p>

  <p>"My mythology is a little bit rusty," smiled Jim, "but that is the name by
  which I remember them. It is certainly a lovely piece of work."</p>

  <p>"You are fortunate to see it," said Frank. "My wife only wears it one day
  in the year, the anniversary of her father's death. Isn't that so, darling?"
  Mrs Cameron nodded.</p>

  <p>"Father gave one to my sister and myself," she said. "He was a great
  connoisseur and had had this ring copied from one which is now in the Louvre.
  It hasn't"&mdash;she faltered&mdash;"it hasn't very pleasant memories, but
  Daddy was so proud of them&mdash;it was his own work&mdash;that I wear mine
  once a year for his sake."</p>

  <p>She did not mention her dead sister, but Jim guessed that that was where
  the unhappiness of the memory lay.</p>

  <p>"It is rather valuable," said Jim, "because the ring at the Louvre was
  stolen in '99 if you remember, and today this is the only copy in the world."
  Margot had risen and walked to the piano and was playing softly and Jim had
  come to accept Margot's playing as part of the daily pleasure which life held
  for him. He pulled up a chair to her side.</p>

  <p>"Play me something that will soothe my jagged nerves," he said.</p>

  <p>"You've no right to have jagged nerves&mdash;a boy like you," she said,
  and stopped.</p>

  <p>"This time next week where shall we be?" quoth he. "What ship are you
  going on?"</p>

  <p>"On the Ceramia."</p>

  <p>"On the Ceramia?" he lifted his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Great Scott! Old man Stornoway is chief officer and old Smythe is chief
  engineer."</p>

  <p>She turned on the stool, her hands on her lap.</p>

  <p>"And who may these old gentlemen be?" she asked. "Frank!" she called over
  her shoulder. "Come and hear about the doddering friends of Mr
  Bartholomew."</p>

  <p>"Well, they're not really old men," explained Jim, "but they are very
  great pals of mine. You see, during the war I was in the Navy. I was almost
  everything that you can be in the Navy from stoker to Intelligence Officer.
  Stornoway was the skipper of B. 75, which was a special service destroyer,
  and I was Intelligence Officer on her. We were running a patrol to the north
  of Scotland. Smythe was chief engineer and so we got to know one another
  rather well, and when we were picked up&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Picked up?" said the girl. "What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, we were torpedoed rather neatly one cold February day and
  we three were in the water together for about twelve hours, and naturally
  under those circumstances you get to know a man."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed.</p>

  <p>"Did you rescue them from a watery grave?" she asked sardonically. "Or did
  they rescue you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, we sort of rescued one another," explained Jim hazily.</p>

  <p>The girl sensed behind that awkward statement a story of unrecorded
  heroism and resolved to seek out Stornoway at the earliest opportunity and
  discover the truth of this incident.</p>

  <p>Jim would have stayed to dinner but for the fact that he had a long report
  which must be written that night, and the girl walked with him down the
  drive.</p>

  <p>"So you're going to be a bank robber after I leave, are you?" she
  said.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he protested stoutly. "It's easy. Do you know, Margot, I have a
  criminal mind."</p>

  <p>"I've often suspected you of having a weak mind, but never a criminal
  mind," said the girl, "but I suppose that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In what respect have I a weak mind?"</p>

  <p>"Well," she drawled, "I think you lack resolution, and in some respects
  self-confidence."</p>

  <p>"Good lord!" he gasped. "I thought I was the most sure and certain man in
  the world."</p>

  <p>"In some respects you are. In fact, in some respects you are inclined to
  be bumptious," she went on remorselessly, "but in others&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped and faced her.</p>

  <p>"Now you've got to tell me where I've failed. Don't leave me in this
  benighted land&mdash;for benighted it will be when you have gone&mdash;with
  that untold mystery taxing all my mental resources. In what respect have I
  failed?"</p>

  <p>"I think you're very&mdash;English," she said.</p>

  <p>"In other words, pudden-headed," said Jim. "But surely you are not going
  to blame me because I am a citizen of the most downtrodden race in the
  world."</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"I think you're dense, that's all."</p>

  <p>"Oh, is that all?" he said sarcastically. And then more seriously:</p>

  <p>"Suppose I am willingly dense. Suppose I know that within my reach is the
  greatest prize in all the world?" His voice shook ever so slightly.</p>

  <p>"Suppose I know there is somebody so generous and so fine and so immensely
  gracious that she would give herself to me&mdash;I who have just enough money
  to realise my poverty. Suppose I knew all this and had resolved in my heart
  that for her happiness and mine I must come to her with an accomplishment
  behind me, would you say that I lacked confidence?"</p>

  <p>She did not speak, but laid her hand within his, and in silence they
  walked the rest of the way.</p>

  <p>"I shall see you tomorrow," she said without looking at him. "You wouldn't
  like to come to Southampton to see us off?"</p>

  <p>"That's an idea," he said. "It will be rather painful, but I&mdash;yes.
  I'll do it. I'll come down by the morning train."</p>

  <p>"Why not come down by car with us?"</p>

  <p>"I can't do that," he said. "I am due in London on Saturday morning, but
  I'll go up by the midnight train to London, see my general manager, and catch
  the boat train to Southampton. Good night!" He held out his hand and she
  looked round.</p>

  <p>Behind them the groom was leading Jim's horse.</p>

  <p>"Good night," she said, "and don't bring your horse tomorrow: I can't go
  riding."</p>

  <p>"Will you come into town tomorrow with your sister?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Possibly," she nodded. He swung into his saddle and the girl was gently
  rubbing the nose of the horse.</p>

  <p>"Jim," she asked suddenly "if&mdash;if you are going to make your
  fortune...you will try something very rapid, won't you?"</p>

  <p>He stooped over and laid his hand upon her head and she raised her eyes to
  his.</p>

  <p>"It will be something infernally rapid," he said.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">CHAPTER 3</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Mr Stephen Sanderson had had a bulky letter by the American
  mail and had sat up half the night writing, taking notes and comparing the
  new data he had received from Frank Cameron&rsquo;s friend with the
  voluminous matter he had already classified and tabulated.</p>

  <p>It was a long work, but it was a labour of love for Stephen Sanderson. It
  meant the careful reading of thousands of newspaper extracts dealing with the
  wave of crime which had swept over England and France that year. It meant the
  comparison of methods thus recorded, with those which had been supplied him
  by the report which had come from New York. He had worked until the daylight
  filtered greyly through the curtained window with a dozen portraits of men
  and women outspread on the table before him. He was piecing together with
  amazing patience the pieces of the most fascinating jigsaw puzzle. Only one
  or two pieces did not fit, and he arose after four hours' sleep, refreshed
  and thrilled by the thought that even these elusive scraps might yet be
  fitted into the picture.</p>

  <p>Jim, coming to the office at ten o'clock, found his assistant sitting
  before his desk a little hollow-eyed but more cheerful than he remembered
  him.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr Sanderson."</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Mr Bartholomew."</p>

  <p>Jim had an inquiry on the tip of his tongue, but checked himself. He
  looked at his assistant with a new respect.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything particularly interesting this morning?" asked Jim as he
  hung up his hat and slipped off his coat&mdash;it had been raining that
  morning.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, sir," said Sanderson. He was punctilious in all outward evidence
  of respect.</p>

  <p>"I have the money ready for Mrs Cameron and for Mrs Markham."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, but she's not drawing out her balance, is she?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said the other. "Her balance isn't a very large one. About
  2,000. She is leaving a little in the account because she is returning. I am
  expecting Mr Winter any moment. Would you like to see him?"</p>

  <p>"Who is Winter? Oh, the butler? No, thank you very much," said Jim
  carelessly. "If he wants to see me he'll find me in the office."</p>

  <p>He went into his room, closed the door, and Sanderson went on with his
  work. There was a knock at the door and the clerk came in.</p>

  <p>"Mr Winter, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll see him in here. Ask him in, will you?"</p>

  <p>A stout, genial-looking man with black side whiskers was Mr Winter. He
  offered his large hand, and sitting down on the seat opposite Sanderson at
  the managers invitation, he produced a pink slip which Sanderson
  examined.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr Winter, I suppose your lady is in a state of great excitement
  about the prospect of going back to America?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," smiled Mr Winter. "There's very little excitement at Tor
  Towers, sir, believe me. It is just about the dullest situation I was ever
  in. Mind you, everything is as it should be in the way of food and
  accommodation, but there's precious little life."</p>

  <p>"When are you leaving?"</p>

  <p>"Tonight, sir. We are going by car to Bournemouth and on early tomorrow to
  the ship."</p>

  <p>"It is going to be a pleasant trip for you, Mr Winter."</p>

  <p>The elder man rubbed the bald patch on the top of his head.</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, it may be and it may not," he said cautiously "I have never
  been out of England and I don't know how I'm going to get on with these
  Americans. Of course, Mrs M. is a very nice lady and if they are all like her
  I shall be comfortable. But never having been abroad or been on a
  ship&mdash;why naturally I'm a bit nervous."</p>

  <p>"You'll be all right," said Sanderson.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell and handed the cheque to the clerk.</p>

  <p>"Bring the cash for this, will you," he said</p>

  <p>"There is one thing, sir," the butler leant over the table and lowered his
  voice. "Mrs M. is a little nervous about those jewels you've got and she
  asked me if I'll have a look at them to see if they are properly
  packed&mdash;in fact, sir, I won't tell a lie, to see if they are still in
  your possession."</p>

  <p>Sanderson indulged in one of his rare smiles.</p>

  <p>"I don't think she need worry about that," he said. "I suppose it is the
  jewel robberies which are worrying her?"</p>

  <p>"That's it, sir," nodded Winter emphatically. "My lady says that she was
  robbed once before when she was in America and it has made her scared."</p>

  <p>"I think I can put her mind at rest," said Sanderson, rising, and going to
  a steel door at the end of his room.</p>

  <p>He manipulated two keys and presently the big door swung open, and he
  disappeared into the vault.</p>

  <p>He came back in a moment with a small brown-paper parcel.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to open this?" he said, pointing to the package and the
  sealed tape which enveloped it.</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said Winter. "All she wanted you to do was to tear the paper so
  that I could see. I understand the jewels are in a glass case."</p>

  <p>"Mrs Markham's idea," said Sanderson, "and not a bad one."</p>

  <p>He caught a corner of the paper and tore it cautiously revealing an oblong
  glass box.</p>

  <p>"There they are."</p>

  <p>Mr Winter leaned forward and looked reverently at a section of a broad
  diamond collar which sparkled and glittered in the light.</p>

  <p>"That's all right, sir," he said, "and here's Mrs Markham's seal."</p>

  <p>He handed over a gummed label, across which was written "Stella Markham"
  and the date.</p>

  <p>"What is that for?" asked Sanderson in surprise, and Mr Winter
  chuckled.</p>

  <p>"A wonderful lady is Mrs M. She thinks of everything. 'Winter,' she said,
  'after Mr Sanderson has torn the paper you'd better put this label over the
  tear so that nobody will think the parcel has been interfered with without my
  knowledge."</p>

  <p>He licked the label and with an "excuse me, sir," rubbed it down over the
  torn paper.</p>

  <p>"There's a gentleman Mrs Markham doesn't like," he said, with a jerk of
  his head to the window which gave out upon the High Street. Following the
  direction of his eyes Sanderson saw the back of a stocky figure.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"That's Farmer Gold. He's a very objectionable man and turned madame off
  his property where she was sketching."</p>

  <p>"He's usually a very decent fellow," said Sanderson. "I'll put this
  package back in the vaults and you can reassure Mrs Markham that her jewels
  are safe."</p>

  <p>The clerk came in with the money which was counted, not once, but three
  times by the careful Mr Winter. He had pocketed the money and was rising when
  Sanderson detained him.</p>

  <p>"There's one thing I want to see you about, Mr Winter," he said, "if you
  can spare five minutes of your time."</p>

  <p>"With all the pleasure in life," said Mr Winter.</p>

  <p>"You're going to America, and you will be in a favourable position to
  collect a little information for me, especially whilst you are on the
  ship."</p>

  <p>"If I'm well enough to get about, sir," interrupted Winter. "I'm not
  looking forward&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, you'll be well enough to get about," said Mr Sanderson, with a little
  laugh. "Sailing with you will be Mr and Mrs Cameron."</p>

  <p>"Cameron?" repeated the other.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Are they country people? Do I know them?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you know them, but they live in this town."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, the American people," nodded Winter. "Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>And Sanderson detailed his commission. Not for five minutes, but for
  twenty did he speak. It was necessary to some extent to take the butler into
  his confidence, and this he did. Jim heard the murmur of voices in the next
  room and, looking across the unfrosted top of the door panel, caught a
  glimpse of Sanderson's earnest face and smiled. He sealed the letter he was
  writing and passed into the outer office.</p>

  <p>"Has Mrs Cameron been?" he asked his clerk.</p>

  <p>"No, sir. Mr Winter, Mrs Markham's butler, is here."</p>

  <p>"Tell Mr Sanderson I shall be back in ten minutes," said Jim, and went out
  into the High Street.</p>

  <p>He was restless, impatient of things, craving unreasonably for a glimpse
  of the face which was soon to pass away from him, perhaps for ever. He walked
  through the town in the direction of the Camerons' house and knew himself for
  a fool. He was halfway up Moor Hill when he saw the car coming slowly down.
  It stopped at his signal and Cecile Cameron beckoned him.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going so early?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The other occupant of the car was Margot, who had no need to make any
  inquiry and was only interested in what excuse Jim would invent.</p>

  <p>"I was coming out to meet you," said Jim, seating himself in one of the
  bucket seats.</p>

  <p>"And Margot?" said Cecile softly.</p>

  <p>"And Margot," Jim admitted without blushing. "I know I am a frantic idiot,
  but I just hate your going."</p>

  <p>"I think we all wish we were staying," said Cecile, "even Margot."</p>

  <p>"Even Margot," scoffed her sister-in-law.</p>

  <p>"Can't you find an excuse to come with us?" said Mrs Cameron.</p>

  <p>"I found the excuse quite a long time ago," said Jim.</p>

  <p>Margot stared out of the window; interested apparently in anything and
  everything except the young man in tweeds who sat with his foot against
  hers.</p>

  <p>"Maybe I'll turn up there if you don't come back quickly," Jim went on.
  "One of these fine days when you're sitting in your palatial apartment on the
  29th floor of the Goldrox Hotel you will ring your bell for the waiter and in
  will come Jim Bartholomew&mdash;I had no idea I had walked such a short
  distance."</p>

  <p>The car was pulling up before the bank.</p>

  <p>Sanderson was standing at the door talking to his visitor.</p>

  <p>"And now to do a little honest banking business?" said Jim. "I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped dead at the sight of Mrs Cameron's face. It was as white as
  death, her lips were bloodless and her face was frozen in an expression of
  horror.</p>

  <p>Jim turned and saw Sanderson at the door. He had just given his final word
  to Mrs Markham's butler and had not noticed the arrival of the car. He looked
  back again at Cecile. She was shaking as if from an ague.</p>

  <p>"My God!" she gasped. "Oh, my God!"</p>

  <p>By this time Sanderson had turned into the bank.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter, Cecile dear? For heaven's sake, what has happened?"
  said Margot, putting her arms about Cecile.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, nothing."</p>

  <p>Jim was dumb with astonishment.</p>

  <p>Sanderson! What was there in the sight of that stony face which would
  reduce this well-poised woman to such a condition of terror? That it was
  Sanderson he did not doubt. He jumped out of the car and assisted Mrs Cameron
  into the bank.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it is nothing. I am stupid," she said faintly as he brought her into
  his office. "Just a little fainting attack, I sometimes have them. You must
  please forgive me, Mr Bartholomew, for making such a spectacle of
  myself."</p>

  <p>"But what was it, dear?" Margot asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, nothing." Mrs Cameron forced a smile. "Really it was nothing,
  Margot. I just had an attack of the vapours. Will you attend to me, Mr
  Bartholomew? I&mdash;I don't think I want to see your assistant manager."</p>

  <p>Jim was only too anxious to deal with the matter himself. He walked into
  Sanderson's office and that worthy was at the table apparently unconscious of
  his responsibility for Mrs Cameron's condition.</p>

  <p>"I am attending to Mrs Cameron's account myself, Sanderson," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," replied the other, without looking up. "I've just fixed
  Mrs Markham's account."</p>

  <p>In three minutes Jim was back in his office with the notes and by that
  time Cecile Cameron had recovered something of her calm.</p>

  <p>"There's quite a run on the bank today," said Jim. "Mrs Markham's butler
  has just drawn 2,000 for that lady."</p>

  <p>There was a silence as he counted the money then: "Mrs Markham is the lady
  who is going to America, is she?" said Cecile.</p>

  <p>"I believe she is leaving today or tomorrow. I'll find out."</p>

  <p>He went into Sanderson's room. He guessed that Cecile's interest in Mrs
  Markham was an excuse to get him out of the room that she might have a little
  further time to recover and he delayed his return as long as possible.</p>

  <p>He was somewhat surprised to find his assistant in excellent humour and
  informative.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Jim on his return, "she's sailing tomorrow and her butler has
  been confiding his terrors of the sea to Sanderson. I gather she is leaving
  today."</p>

  <p>He saw the girls back to their car and bade farewell to them and stood
  watching the number plate at the back of the car until it had disappeared,
  then he went slowly back to his office. He pressed the bell which
  communicated with Sanderson and the assistant manager came in.</p>

  <p>"Sanderson," he said, "I owe you an apology."</p>

  <p>"Do you, sir?" said Sanderson in surprise.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Jim. "I've been rather a boor about your little hobby and I
  didn't realise how very important your work in that direction may be."</p>

  <p>Mr Sanderson looked at him suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Mr Bartholomew if you're going to be funny about it-"</p>

  <p>"I'm not being funny at all," said Jim. "Sit down. I had a long talk with
  Mr Cameron yesterday afternoon, and without betraying any of your secrets he
  told me that you were working systematically with the object of identifying
  the members of the Big Four who have been victimising the banks."</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, that's true," said Sanderson, sitting down, "and I'm happy to
  say that I'm on the track. And I'm not the only one looking for them either,"
  he said. "I had a letter yesterday from a friend of Mr Cameron's who's a
  lawyer in America, and he gave me some very interesting information. The
  biggest enemy to the Big Four is a woman&mdash;a woman detective who has been
  employed by the Department of Justice in America for four years tracking down
  the principal members. I don't know the name of the lady and this fact was
  told me in confidence."</p>

  <p>"A woman detective sounds thrilling," said Jim. "What do you think are the
  prospects of their capture?"</p>

  <p>Sanderson shook his head.</p>

  <p>"That's a difficult question to answer," he said. "As likely as not the
  lady who is on their track is nearer to detecting them than ever I shall be.
  She has unlimited resources, she has the Government of America behind her,
  she can appear in all sorts of guises, and can devote the whole of her time
  to the work." It seemed at that moment to Jim that he had a deeper grudge
  against the mysterious woman detective with her unlimited authority than he
  had against the miscreants whose undoing he sought.</p>

  <p>"By the way sir, Mr Winter wanted to see Mrs Markham's jewels before he
  left," said Sanderson as he was leaving, and gave an account of the
  interview.</p>

  <p>He made no reference, however, to the interview which followed when they
  sat head to head over the table, he and the butler whom he was training and
  from whom he anticipated receiving such assistance.</p>

  <p>"Blow her jewellery," said Jim. "I wish to heaven she'd leave it in London
  or somewhere. I'll have to send that necklace to town just as soon as Mrs
  Markham has gone, Sanderson. You might write to the Head Office and tell them
  that they can expect it on Tuesday and you can take it. A trip to town will
  do you no harm, and it will probably help you."</p>

  <p>Sanderson nodded gratefully.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir, I want to go to Scotland Yard to see Inspector McGinty. I
  have had some correspondence with him. He seems a very intelligent man."</p>

  <p>"He probably is," said Jim dryly. "It is curious how often real detectives
  are that way!"</p>

  <p class="first">He had the choice of going home and eating a solitary lunch
  or mooning in his office. Somehow a meal, and a solitary meal, had no
  attraction for him and he was still in a state of indecision when he saw the
  Camerons' car pull up and Frank jump down.</p>

  <p>Jim Bartholomew hurried out to meet him.</p>

  <p>"I want to speak to you, Jim," said that troubled man.</p>

  <p>It was the first time he had called Jim Bartholomew by his Christian name,
  and Jim accepted the omen with pleasure.</p>

  <p>"I can't make out what has happened to Cecile," said Frank as they paced
  the broad sidewalk, deserted at the luncheon hour, "This morning she was
  quite cheerful and even made a jest about that ring of hers, which is a
  mighty solemn subject with Cecile, I can tell you. What did you call it?"</p>

  <p>"The Daughters of the Night," said Jim. "It sounds romantic and a little
  improper, but it is historically accurate."</p>

  <p>"Well, as I say she went away from the house cheerful," Frank went on,
  "but came back from the bank a pitiful wreck. What happened?"</p>

  <p>"The Lord knows!" said Jim. "I was sitting in the car with her when
  suddenly I saw her face go white and I thought she was going to faint."</p>

  <p>"Was there reason for it?"</p>

  <p>"None that I could see," said Jim, who thought it wisest not to mention
  the fact that it was apparently the sight of Sanderson which had reduced her
  to this condition.</p>

  <p>"Well, anyway she's decided that she won't go to America tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Good Lord!" said Jim, and his heart leapt.</p>

  <p>"I can't go either, of course," said Frank. "But Margot will have to go.
  There are documents to be signed and either she or I must sign them. We'll
  follow on after."</p>

  <p>"Is Margot going alone?" said Jim.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid she must," replied the other.</p>

  <p>"She'll have plenty of room to move around. I've engaged a suite for
  three."</p>

  <p>"What does she say about it?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, she's very much distressed," said Frank, "and I'd like you to
  see her. She's a good girl that, Bartholomew the best in the world is my
  little sister. She's leaving tonight for Southampton. I wish you would go
  down and see her off tomorrow I do not like to leave Cecile in her present
  condition."</p>

  <p>"Rather," said Jim, with alacrity "You haven't any idea what has decided
  Mrs Cameron not to go? I thought she was rather keen on the trip."</p>

  <p>"She was never enthusiastic," said the other; "but she was agreeable. You
  see, her friend was going out, Mrs Dupreid, and there were all the prospects
  of rather a jolly voyage. I'm as sick as a monkey about it. What made her
  decide to change her mind heaven only knows. I never attempt to pry into
  first causes, so far as women are concerned, and in consequence I am a
  happily married."</p>

  <p>Jim laughed.</p>

  <p>"Can you spare time to come up to the house now?" asked Cameron. "My car
  is here."</p>

  <p>Jim hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Just one moment."</p>

  <p>He went back into the bank and entered Sanderson's room.</p>

  <p>"I'm going out for about an hour, Sanderson," he said; "if you want me
  will you 'phone Mrs Cameron's house?"</p>

  <p>Sanderson nodded. He was even genial.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose you'll be needed this afternoon, Mr Bartholomew. I've
  settled the trouble about Jackson &amp; Wales' bill, and the statement will
  be ready for you to sign at five."</p>

  <p>On the way up to Moor House Frank Cameron offered Jim more of his
  confidence than he had shown during the twelve months of their
  friendship.</p>

  <p>"Cecile has never been herself since her sisters death. She died of
  typhoid in New York City," he said. "I told you Cecile got there in time and
  only just in time. They were rather a devoted family and I sometimes wonder
  whether the shock has not affected her mind&mdash;I'll be candid with you,
  Jim. It worries me to death at times. I insisted upon her seeing a specialist
  when we were in New York last fall and I gave him my views, but he could
  trace nothing of a serious nature and put her condition down to shock and
  nerve trouble. Margot, of course, has been a brick, as she always is in times
  of stress. How do you feel towards Margot?" he asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>Jim went red.</p>

  <p>"I love her," he said suddenly and with strange gruffness.</p>

  <p>"I thought so," said the other quietly. "Well, what are you going to do
  about it?"</p>

  <p>There was a half-smile on his face as he asked the question.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to ask her to be my wife, but I'm going to ask her, not as a
  bank manager with a microscopic income&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You know that Margot has money of her own?" interrupted Frank.</p>

  <p>"That is why," said Jim quietly "I have infinite faith in my&mdash;my
  star, if you like. I am going to make good, and just as soon as Margot is on
  the way I shall resign my position as bank manager and take up something
  which offers better opportunities. I know, my dear chap, what you're going to
  say"&mdash;he laid his hand on the other's knee. "You're going to tell me
  that you've the very job for me&mdash;I know you're a very rich man and I dare say you
  could place me in the way of getting easy money but that isn't quite good
  enough and you wouldn't like me much if I accepted your offer."</p>

  <p>"You're right," said Frank after a pause. "And I respect you for it, Jim.
  I don't doubt that you'll pull through and I know somebody else who will
  share my faith."</p>

  <p>Lunch was waiting when they arrived, and Cecile Cameron, who had recovered
  something of her self-possession, met Jim with a whimsical smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of my latest eccentricity, Mr Bartholomew?"</p>

  <p>"The knowledge that you are still keeping money in my bank compensates me
  for a lot," said Jim. "After all, is it eccentric to do what you want to do
  and not do the things you don't want to do? Is it not more eccentric to stop
  yourself doing what your heart aches to do?" He looked straight at Margot and
  Margot returned his gaze without flushing. "To give up what you want most in
  the world."</p>

  <p>"I don't call that eccentric," said the girl. "I call that&mdash;a little
  heroic."</p>

  <p>Jim bowed, which was disconcerting.</p>

  <p>"I decided that I couldn't break with this very peaceful life yet awhile,"
  said Mrs Cameron, "and I really think that I ought not to be blamed."</p>

  <p>"Nobody is blaming you, darling," said Frank. "Would you like to go to the
  Continent for a little while?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to stay here," said his wife quickly, "in this little
  out-of-the-world place where one sees nobody."</p>

  <p>"This is where you bow again, Jim," said Margot.</p>

  <p>"Do you 'Jim' Jim too?" asked Frank in spurious amazement.</p>

  <p>"Occasionally in my tender moments," said the girl coolly and Jim
  choked.</p>

  <p>It was an unexpectedly cheerful luncheon party and Jim went to the bank
  with two conspicuous possibilities for future happiness. (1) That if the
  Camerons stayed, Margot would return. (2) That if Margot returned, he would
  never have the courage to let her go again. It is extraordinary how the
  prospect of his future cowardice cheered him.</p>

  <p>Margot came to the bank that afternoon to say goodbye. She had probably
  chosen this public spot because she was not quite certain how she would
  behave if they parted in more secluded circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Cecile is going away to Scotland. She had a long, long talk with Frank
  this afternoon," said Margot. "Frank came out of the study looking awfully
  serious. Anyway Cecile's gone. I've just seen her off."</p>

  <p>"Gone already?" said Jim in amazement. "Has Frank&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, she's gone alone... She has some friends up there."</p>

  <p>"Poor girl, I wonder what it was." Margot looked at Jim.</p>

  <p>"I've been trying to guess too. Did you notice that when she collapsed she
  was looking at your Mr Sanderson?"</p>

  <p>Jim nodded.</p>

  <p>"I did not fail to notice that," he said. "To my knowledge she had never
  seen Sanderson before."</p>

  <p>"I know she hadn't," said the girl. "We were talking about you two or
  three days ago and I was telling her about Mr Sanderson's detective hobby and
  she was amused. She then told me that she had never seen your manager."</p>

  <p>She offered Jim her hand.</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, Jim," she said gently "I think I shall be coming back soon."</p>

  <p>He took her hand in both of his and he found it difficult to speak.</p>

  <p>"You understand, don't you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly," she replied. "Won't you kiss me?"</p>

  <p>She lifted up her face and he pressed her lips lightly with his.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">CHAPTER 5</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Jim Bartholomew came back from the railway station with a
  heavy heart. He had declined Franks offer to drive him to the bank and had
  promised to go up to the house to dinner. It accentuated his gloom that
  Sanderson was in an exuberantly cheerful mood. To Jim's intense annoyance he
  hummed little snatches of song as he worked, and the sound penetrating
  through wood and glass partition had the character of a dirge.</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you moaning about?" demanded Jim, exploding into his
  assistant's room.</p>

  <p>"Moaning, sir?" asked Sanderson, with a bland smile. "I'm just happy
  that's all. Do you know sir what the Big Four&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn the Big Four!" growled Jim irritably and was surprised to hear
  the other chuckle.</p>

  <p>He turned back from the door.</p>

  <p>"Well, what about the Big Four?" he said, feeling that any subject which
  interested him that afternoon would be more than welcome.</p>

  <p>"I've been piecing together the rewards offered for the capture of these
  fellows," said Sanderson. "Have you any idea how much it aggregates?"</p>

  <p>"Not the faintest."</p>

  <p>"120,000," said 'Mr Sanderson impressively. "The Italian Government alone
  offer 50,000 for the recovery of the Negretti diamonds. They are state
  heirlooms. The Duke of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up about money," said Jim. "Aren't you sick of talking pounds and
  dollars and francs and marks?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I'm not," said the other truthfully.</p>

  <p>Jim had walked back in his room and Sanderson followed him.</p>

  <p>"There's one thing I'd like to ask you to do, Mr Bartholomew," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"What's that?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>"Write to headquarters and ask them to let us have an extra revolver down
  here. We've only got one, the one in your desk. Do you know that I sleep on
  these premises, upstairs, absolutely unarmed?"</p>

  <p>"Well, take mine," said Jim. "What a ferocious beggar you are! I think you
  go too often to the movies."</p>

  <p>"Movies? Me?" spluttered Sanderson indignantly. "Do you imagine I spend my
  hard-earned money in that kind of trash? The only thing I have seen on the
  cinematograph, Mr Bartholomew," he said emphatically, "is a series of
  interesting photographs showing the life of the bee, and if these wretched
  cinema theatres would only show interesting topics of that character I should
  be a regular patron."</p>

  <p>"Here's the gun," said Jim, unlocking the drawer and taking out a
  long-barrelled Colt. "Be careful. It is loaded."</p>

  <p>"Put it in your drawer, sir, and leave the drawer unlocked and I'll take
  it tonight."</p>

  <p>"Why do you want a revolver?" asked Jim curiously.</p>

  <p>"Because I have a feeling that sooner or later we are coming to grips with
  the Big Four," replied Sanderson solemnly.</p>

  <p>"Bosh!" said the sceptical Jim. "What the dickens are the Big Four coming
  to this little burg for? To steal jingle and Merrick's overdraft, or-"</p>

  <p>"There's a hundred thousand pounds' worth of diamonds in this bank," said
  Sanderson, significantly and Jim whistled.</p>

  <p>"By gosh! So there is! I think you're right. Now don't forget, Sanderson,
  those diamonds must go up to London on Tuesday."</p>

  <p>A customer came into the bank at that moment, a well-to-do farmer named
  Sturgeon who farmed about a thousand acres in the neighbourhood. He glanced
  up at the clock as he came in.</p>

  <p>"I've just made it," he said, putting down his paying-in book on the
  counter.</p>

  <p>Jim, standing in the doorway of his room, gave him a nod.</p>

  <p>"We're open day and night to take money, but we're rather careful of our
  business hours when it comes to paying out," said Jim, his hands in his
  pockets.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Bartholomew," said Sturgeon. "I saw a friend of yours half an hour
  ago getting out of the train at the Halt."</p>

  <p>The Halt, as its name implied, was a small station outside the town where
  the trains sometimes stopped to pick up and set down passengers who came from
  the moorland villages and could thus save a journey into town.</p>

  <p>"I have so many friends that I can't place this particular one," said Jim
  lazily.</p>

  <p>"Mrs Cameron," was the surprising reply.</p>

  <p>"Mrs Cameron? Nonsense," said Jim incredulously. "Mrs Cameron has gone up
  to London."</p>

  <p>"She may or may not have gone to town," said the other. "But I tell you
  that she got down at the Halt and got into her car which was waiting."</p>

  <p>Jim was silent.</p>

  <p>"Maybe you're right," he said at last.</p>

  <p>"I am right," smiled the other, gathering up his pass-book. "So long!"</p>

  <p>Jim Bartholomew went back into his room and closed the door. Mrs Cameron
  had left by the three o'clock train which connected with the northern express
  at Bristol. She had gone an hour before Margot, who was catching the Exeter
  train connecting through Yeovil with Southampton.</p>

  <p>He had held his breath for a moment having a wild idea that it might have
  been Margot. But Mrs Cameron!</p>

  <p>Frank would be able to explain, and he was on his way to the telephone
  when he thought better of it. Mrs Cameron would hardly change her plan again
  without making her husband aware of the fact. Then he remembered that Frank
  had spoken most casually of his wife going to Scotland and had offered no
  comment upon her decision. It was curious.</p>

  <p>When he went up to dinner that night he half expected to find Cecile
  Cameron sitting in the drawing-room, but she was not there and Frank made no
  mention of her, which was also an extraordinary circumstance, for Frank
  Cameron never tired of talking of his wife. It was a very dull meal and Jim
  missed Margot horribly. He talked of her very frankly and his host encouraged
  him. It seemed to Jim as though Frank Cameron was anxious to keep the
  conversation away from his wife, and once when Jim mentioned casually the
  difficulties Cecile might have in catching the Scottish express, Frank
  changed the subject. Jim walked home that night, a little sick at heart, a
  little lonely and very love-conscious. A thin drizzle of rain was falling and
  he had left his raincoat at the office. His way back to the house where he
  lodged lay past the bank and he felt in his pocket for his key. It was there,
  he noted with satisfaction. He quickened his steps, overtaking another
  pedestrian, who turned out to be the inspector of the local police.</p>

  <p>"A wretched night, Mr Bartholomew," said that gentleman, recognising the
  other. "Was that Mr Cameron's car I saw in the High Street half an hour ago?
  There it is now." He pointed to a red tail light on the opposite side of the
  road.</p>

  <p>"No, it is not Mr Cameron's car. Has it been there long?"</p>

  <p>"About half an hour," said the inspector. "I suppose it is one of the
  gentry from the country. They're having a school concert tonight at the
  Church Hall." The town of Moorford, feeling the urge for economy, had decreed
  that the street lamps should not be lit upon moonlight nights, and as this
  was officially a moonlight night, in spite of the heavy bank of clouds
  overshadowing all sign of the moon and the drizzle of rain which was falling,
  the lamps were dark, and it was impossible for Jim to see the outlines of the
  car. As they came abreast of the bank he took out the key which opened the
  side door.</p>

  <p>"Going to work, sir?"</p>

  <p>"No, I'm going to get my coat," said Jim. "I'll probably overtake
  you."</p>

  <p>The inspector went on, and Jim entered and closed the door behind him.</p>

  <p>The inspector passing glanced up and saw lights in the windows of the
  living-rooms above the bank, where Mr Stephen Sanderson had his headquarters.
  More than this, he noted a light in an interior room which he recognised as
  the assistant manager's private office. He had not gone a dozen yards when he
  heard a shot, and turned. He listened, but there was no outcry. It was
  undoubtedly a shot. He was an old soldier and could not mistake the sound. He
  walked quickly back to the bank and peered over the green-painted sashes of
  the window and looked in. He saw a silhouette of a figure against the glass
  door of Sanderson's office and knocked.</p>

  <p>Then he went round to the side door. It was ajar, though he had distinctly
  remembered hearing Bartholomew close it.</p>

  <p>He flashed his lamp into the interior and walked in. There was a door on
  the left of the passage. He turned the handle and found himself in Jim
  Bartholomew's private office. This too was empty and the key had been left in
  the lock.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" called a voice.</p>

  <p>"Inspector Brown&mdash;is anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Come in, will you, inspector."</p>

  <p>The inspector crossed the room, opened the glass-panelled door that gave
  into Sanderson's office, and there he stopped.</p>

  <p>Jim Bartholomew was kneeling on the floor, looking down upon a prostrate
  figure that lay stretched stiff and stark by the side of the desk.</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said he. "Why it's Mr Sanderson. Is he hurt?"</p>

  <p>"He is dead," said Jim dully and looked at the revolver in his hand. "My
  pistol killed him."</p>

  <p>"I heard the shot as I was unlocking my door," said Jim, "and ran in.
  There was nobody here." He got on his feet and walked to the door in
  Sanderson's room which opened on to the passage leading to the side door.
  That was unfastened.</p>

  <p>"He went out this way," said Jim. "Get out into the street, Brown. I'll
  search the house. The man who did this can't be far away."</p>

  <p>But evidently the murderer had made his or her escape by the same passage
  as the two men had entered. The slayer of Sanderson was probably not half a
  dozen feet from the inspector when he had pushed open the door which the
  murderer had left ajar in his flight, but when the inspector reached the
  street it was empty. Far down to the southern end of the town was a tiny
  speck of red light. It was the car that they had seen waiting on the opposite
  side of the street and which was now disappearing from view.</p>

  <p>Jim's search of the room above gave nothing. It revealed only one fact,
  that two persons had been there. Sanderson had had a visitor. There were two
  empty coffee cups on the table and in the saucer of one of these was the end
  of a cigarette, the type which Sanderson smoked.</p>

  <p>There was no other clue, and he went back to the office and bent over the
  dead man. Sanderson had been shot at short range. Death must have come
  painlessly for upon his face, now dignified by the Greet Visitation, was a
  strange serenity and something of that good humour in which Jim had found him
  during the afternoon.</p>

  <p>One hand of the dead man lay flat and open, turned downward on the floor,
  the other was tightly clenched. Jim lifted this. Between ringer and thumb was
  a little slip of paper. He prised the fingers apart and took out the thing
  which Sanderson had been holding, carrying it to the table under the light.
  It was a torn portion of a photograph, and the untorn edges were about an
  inch and a half in length. The face, whatever face it was, had gone, but the
  one hand which showed was obviously the hand of a woman. Jim looked, and
  suddenly the room went round and round and he gripped the edge of the table
  for support, for upon the finger of that hand, the hand of this unknown
  woman, was the ring, the only one of its kind in the world, and there leered
  up to him with microscopic exactness the three dire faces of the Furies, the
  Daughters of the Night.</p>

  <p>Mrs Cameron!</p>

  <p>Whoever had killed Sanderson had killed him to steal that picture. Where
  had it come from? Then in a flash Jim remembered the package of photographs
  which had come from the District Attorney. And Mrs Cameron's horror at the
  sight of him, and her change of plans...the getting out at the Halt when she
  was supposed to be on her way to Scotland. He sat heavily on a chair, his
  head on his hands, shaking and ill. He heard the thud of heavy feet in the
  passage, thrust the torn corner of the photograph in his waistcoat pocket,
  and got up to meet the inspector, who was unaccompanied.</p>

  <p>"I'll have to fetch the doctor myself, Mr Bartholomew," he said. "The
  police doctor is out of town and I shall have to go up to Dr Grey at Oldshot.
  Will you wait?"</p>

  <p>Jim nodded. He welcomed the interval. He wanted to think.</p>

  <p>It was half an hour before the inspector returned accompanied by a doctor
  and another constable he had picked up on his beat. And a further surprise
  awaited him. The door was ajar but Jim Bartholomew had gone. On the table of
  the room where the murdered man was lying was a sheet of paper and a key and
  written upon the paper were the words:</p>

  <p>"Telegraph to our bank at Tiverton to send a manager over to take charge. Give him this key."</p>

  <p>The inspector stared at the doctor and from the doctor to
  the constable.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand it," he said in a worried voice. "Why did Mr
  Bartholomew go? And where has he gone?"</p>

  <p>Information on both subjects was forthcoming. At two o'clock it was
  reported to the inspector that Mr Bartholomew had mounted the last train for
  Exeter as it was moving out of the station. At ten o'clock next morning in
  answer to the inspector's urgent wire arrived an official of the bank, who
  made a hasty inspection of the strongroom.</p>

  <p>He came with a little disordered
  bundle in his hand and put it on the table, then consulted a deposit
  book.</p>

  <p>"Deposit No. 64," he read slowly, "one dog collar of diamonds, property of
  Mrs Stella Markham of Tor Towers. Deposited at the bank on the 19th
  September. Valued &pound;112,000 and insured by the bank. Premium paid."</p>

  <p>He looked from the book to the torn package. The seals had been ripped,
  the tapes broken, and the brown paper torn. Inside was a glass box&mdash;and
  it was empty.</p>

  <p>That afternoon a warrant was issued for the arrest of James Bartholomew on
  a charge of murder and robbery. His description was telegraphed throughout
  the country and the busy radio sent forth urgent inquiries to all steamships
  which had left port that day, and received the reply "Not aboard."</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">CHAPTER 6</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Margot Cameron, leaning over the rail of the huge Ceramia,
  had watched the quay anxiously for some sign of Jim. He had promised to see
  her off and she knew that it must be some extraordinary circumstance which
  would keep him away. There was so much that she wanted to tell him, so much
  that she had forgotten to say when they had parted, and she could have wept
  when the clanging bell warned non-passengers to leave the ship.</p>

  <p>She was still on the deck as the big liner swung into Southampton Waters,
  hoping that at the eleventh hour she would see him, and it was not until the
  ship was passing Netley that she went below with a sigh, to the luxurious
  suite which her brother had reserved. The vastness of the apartments, their
  horrible emptiness, served to emphasise her loneliness, and for the first
  time in her life she felt genuinely homesick and could have cried. She shook
  of this weakness, changed her dress, took a book and went on the deck to find
  her chair.</p>

  <p>Frank had made his arrangements very thoroughly and three chairs had been
  reserved amidships. A steward brought her rugs and pillow and she settled
  down to get over what is invariably the most trying part of a voyage.</p>

  <p>A fluttering label to one of the chairs caught her eye. She reached out
  and held it steadily.</p>

  <p>"Mrs Dupreid," she read, and remembered that Cecile's friend was on
  board.</p>

  <p>She put down her book and went down to the purser's office.</p>

  <p>"Mrs Dupreid," said one of the assistants. "Yes, madam, she is in
  Stateroom 209, C Deck."</p>

  <p>Margot thanked him and went up the elevator to C Deck and began her
  search. Stateroom 209 was amidships and she knocked at the door. A maid
  appeared.</p>

  <p>"Is Mrs Dupreid in her cabin?" asked Margo.</p>

  <p>"Yes, madam," said the maid, "but she doesn't want to see anybody."</p>

  <p>"Will you tell her it is Miss Cameron."</p>

  <p>"She knows you are on board, madam," said the maid, "and she told me to
  ask you to excuse her. She is feeling very unwell and she is not fit to see
  anybody."</p>

  <p>Margot was a little piqued by the uncompromising refusal, and with a
  conventional expression of regret she went back to her book on the promenade.
  The passengers had come up from lunch (she only realised then that in her
  anxiety to see Jim Bartholomew she had missed that rather important meal) and
  were taking up their chairs. Her own chair was the end of the four and next
  to her a steward was arranging cushions and soft fleecy rugs for a tall slim
  girl who stood watching the preparation without interest.</p>

  <p>Margot glanced at her curiously. Women are always fascinating to other
  women, and somehow Margot sensed rather than knew the identity of her
  left-hand neighbour.</p>

  <p>She was very pretty, about twenty-eight, Margot judged, with a spiritual
  face and dark deep eyes that seemed to Margot to look through and through her
  when they rested for a moment in her direction.</p>

  <p>Presently the steward finished and the lady with a word of thanks seated
  herself.</p>

  <p>Margot noticed that she was beautifully dressed and read too the title of
  her book, which was a book of reminiscences of a former police chief in New
  York. The lady did not read. Instead, to Margot's surprise, she turned to
  her.</p>

  <p>"You're Miss Cameron, aren't you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," smiled Margot, laying down her book.</p>

  <p>"I heard that you were on board with your brother and his wife. I am a
  neighbour of yours. My name is Stella Markham."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I have seen your house. It was pointed out to me only a few days
  ago." ("Designed for an emperors palace or a lunatic asylum," she remembered
  Jim's description.) She shrugged (mentally) at the recollection, for she was
  not feeling too kindly about Jim. She had counted on his coming to see her
  off and he had failed her, had not even sent her a wire.</p>

  <p>"Your brother and his wife are with you&mdash;yes?"</p>

  <p>"Mr and Mrs Cameron aren't on board," said Margot. "They changed their
  plans at the last moment."</p>

  <p>"It is going to be a lonely voyage for you," said Stella Markham, with a
  quiet smile.</p>

  <p>"I prefer it so, I think," replied Margot. The conversation dropped
  hereabouts and they both took up their books.</p>

  <p>It was Stella Markham who broke the silence.</p>

  <p>"Your sister-in-law was one of the two people I wanted to meet," she said.
  "Three if I include you," she added with tact, and Margot laughed.</p>

  <p>"Who was the other?" she asked, and was quite unprepared for the
  reply.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to meet a bank manager there, a man named Bartholomew. And since
  I have been on board I have wanted to meet him more than ever."</p>

  <p>"But why?" asked the girl in surprise, praying that Mrs Stella Markham
  with the penetrating eyes would not observe her change of colour.</p>

  <p>"I am told he is rather amusing," drawled the girl, and Margot bridled. "I
  am sitting at the table of the chief officer, Mr Stornoway, and he spoke
  about Mr Bartholomew when he heard I had come from Moorford."</p>

  <p>Margot remembered that Stornoway was one of the ship's officers whom Jim
  had mentioned.</p>

  <p>"My dear," Mrs Markham went on, "he raved when I mentioned his name,
  though at first I thought he looked a little embarrassed. It appears that Mr
  Bartholomew was on a ship when it sunk and they were in the water for twelve
  hours, and if it hadn't been for our bank manager they would have both been
  drowned&mdash;he and another man who is also on this ship."</p>

  <p>"I have heard about it," said Margot.</p>

  <p>"Do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"Mr Bartholomew? Yes, I know him rather well."</p>

  <p>"And is he very amusing?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean does he stand on his head and sing comic songs?" asked Margot
  coldly.</p>

  <p>"No, I mean is he interesting?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, immensely," said Margot shortly, and again they drifted to their
  books, and again it was Mrs Markham who spoke.</p>

  <p>"I am the dullest person in the world," she said. "I am bored, bored,
  bored, until I can find nothing in existence which justifies my living. I
  hate England and I hate America. I hate Paris worst of all."</p>

  <p>"Have you ever tried Coney Island?" asked Margot, who was beginning to
  dislike her languid companion. "I am told that is rather amusing."</p>

  <p>The lady stiffened a little.</p>

  <p>"I have never met anybody who has ever been to Coney Island," she said,
  and went back to her book. Margot took a turn up and down the deck by
  herself; then went down in the elevator to F Deck on which the pursers office
  was situated. Her conversation with Mrs Markham had reminded her that there
  was a possibility that Jim had sent a telegram after all. At any rate there
  would be one from her brother and sister. There was a wire from Frank, but
  none from Jim. Nor was there any message from Cecile. Margot remembered,
  however, that Cecile would be en route to Scotland and must find a difficulty
  in wiring in time to catch the boat. She wandered aimlessly about the ship
  until teatime. There seemed to be nobody she knew on board, and in sheer
  ennui she went back to her cabin and lay down. She was aroused by the entry
  of her maid, who began setting out her dress for dinner.</p>

  <p>"What time is it?"</p>

  <p>"Half-past six, madam," said the faithful Jenny, who looked pale and
  hollow-eyed.</p>

  <p>"Have you been ill?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss."</p>

  <p>"Then you're a silly goop," said Margot cheerfully. "The sea is like
  glass. Where are we?"</p>

  <p>"We're near Cherbourg, madam. We arrive in an hour's time."</p>

  <p>The Ceramia called at Cherbourg for passengers and generally there was a
  stay of several hours.</p>

  <p>Margot went into the restaurant to dinner. She had exchanged the table for
  three which Frank had booked for a table in one corner of the beautiful
  saloon and from her isolation scrutinised the restaurant without, however,
  finding anybody she knew very well. On the fat side she caught a glimpse of
  Mrs Stella Markham wonderfully arrayed in black and heliotrope and she also
  was dining in solitary state. Margot had her coffee in the big social hall,
  that seventh wonder of the maritime world, and listened to the band, and at
  eleven o'clock as the Ceramia was turning to leave Cherbourg she went to her
  suite for the night.</p>

  <p>She was an excellent sailor, and though the ship took a roll in the swell
  of the English Channel she slept soundly till Jenny brought her morning
  coffee and rolls.</p>

  <p>"There is no news for me, is there?"</p>

  <p>"No, miss," said Jenny.</p>

  <p>"No wireless?"</p>

  <p>"No, miss."</p>

  <p>"All right, put my bath ready."</p>

  <p>She was bitterly disappointed. If he could not have come to see her, he
  could at least have sent her a message. Surely he knew, of course he knew, he
  who had been a sailor, that it was possible to communicate with people at
  sea.</p>

  <p>When she was dressed she sought out the purser, with whom she had
  travelled before, and asked him a question.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, we're far enough away to get messages," he said. "As a matter of
  fact we've had several radios in the night." He looked round and lowered his
  voice. "One of which was an inquiry for a suspected murderer, by the
  way."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">CHAPTER 7</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Margot Cameron shivered.</p>

  <p>"Is he on board?" she asked.</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"No, no. They got me out of my bed about three to identify the gentleman
  and that meant going through about six hundred passports. Which annoyed
  me."</p>

  <p>The girl laughed in sympathy.</p>

  <p>"Have you many passengers?"</p>

  <p>"We're full up," he said, "and if I hadn't got the passports I couldn't
  have given them any answer at all&mdash;I certainly shouldn't parade the
  passengers in the middle of the night. As it was I was able to say that the
  man they seek is not on board. If he has left England, which is unlikely, he
  could have gone on a dozen ships. Saturday is a great sailing day. Be sure,
  Miss Cameron," he said, "I'll let you have any radio that comes within half
  an hour of its arrival."</p>

  <p>With that she had to be content. Church service relieved the tedium of the
  morning, and she dozed and read the weary hours away until nightfall. She saw
  Mrs Stella Markham again. It was difficult to avoid her, as her chair was
  next to Margot's and passengers retained the same chairs in the same
  positions throughout the voyage. They were sitting idling when an unhappy man
  waddled past and Mrs Markham laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"That is my poor butler," she said. "He just loathes the sea."</p>

  <p>"Does he travel first class?" asked the girl in surprise, for servants
  usually are accommodated in the second saloon.</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes, why not?" she said coolly. "If I had a dog he should go first class.
  I loathe second class people and I don't think third class people ought to
  live."</p>

  <p>"You're evidently a democrat," said Margot politely and the lady stared at
  her.</p>

  <p>"I loathe people who are ironical and sarcastic," she said.</p>

  <p>"Then you loathe me most intensely," laughed Margot, and a smile dawned at
  the corner of Stella Markham's straight lips.</p>

  <p>"No, I don't exactly," she said. "You're so young and refreshing and I
  would give exactly two millions to change places with you."</p>

  <p>"Give who?" asked Margot quietly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I forgot," said Mrs Markham, and again the smile fluttered. "Money
  doesn't mean a great deal to you. You're a lucky young lady."</p>

  <p>Just as she was going down to dress for dinner Margot remembered with a
  pang of remorse that she had not made inquiries of Mrs Dupreid and she went
  to her suite. Again the hard-faced maid met her.</p>

  <p>"Mrs Dupreid is better and she is sleeping, madam," she said. "I take her
  on the deck at night for a little exercise."</p>

  <p>Margot came away with the sense that she had at least done her duty. The
  day never seemed to end and was like all second days at sea, interminable,
  and with a sigh of relief she got into her pyjamas that night and marked off
  the Sunday on her calendar, as a day nearer relief. Monday was a replica of
  Sunday save that the weather had grown warmer and the passengers had
  discarded even their lightest overcoats and were leaning over the side or
  lying full stretched in their chairs on the sun deck basking in the bright
  sun.</p>

  <p>There was nothing that promised the sensational developments which marked
  its close. Mrs Stella Markham gave her the first hint of unusual
  happenings.</p>

  <p>"I had quite an exciting adventure last night," she said, as she sat down
  by Margot's side.</p>

  <p>"That sounds thrilling," said Margot. "And just now I want to be
  thrilled."</p>

  <p>"My cabin is on A Deck, that is to say on this promenade deck," said Mrs
  Markham, "and my windows open on to that portion of the promenade which is
  underneath the captain's bridge. It is rather an embarrassing position if one
  forgets to put up the shaded glass and even more embarrassing when loving
  couples linger outside after the lights are lowered at night&mdash;I think
  love talk is the most puerile in the world, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Margot quietly, "I have not had an opportunity of
  hearing it."</p>

  <p>The other looked at her and smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well, the first adventure happened when I was on deck immediately after
  dinner. My maid went for a walk on the forward deck. Maids are rather a
  responsibility, especially if they get friendly with the men passengers, She
  was leaning over the rail looking at the third class people in the well deck
  when she saw somebody in my room. My bedroom is that nearest where she stood.
  It opens into a sitting-room and into a bathroom, She looked round and to her
  amazement she saw a woman peering into the room very timidly."</p>

  <p>"What kind of woman?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that is where the girl's description breaks down. According to my
  maid, she was 'heavily veiled,' which sounds romantic but isn't very
  descriptive. I haven't seen any very heavily veiled passengers on the ship,
  though there are a few who might with advantage spare us the sight of their
  unpleasant faces."</p>

  <p>"What happened then?" asked Margot.</p>

  <p>"The woman evidently saw my girl looking in and turned away quickly The
  girl ran round as fast as she could to the saloon entrance but there was no
  sign of woman veiled or otherwise and the cabins were empty."</p>

  <p>"Probably a passenger who made a mistake."</p>

  <p>"I thought of that," said Mrs Markham, with a nod, "but the most
  extraordinary thing is yet to come. About half-past eleven I took my final
  walk on the deck with Mr Winter&mdash;that is my butler, a very respectable
  man&mdash;and the Rev. Mr Price from Texas. We were talking
  about&mdash;various trivialities&mdash;you know the sort of conversation you
  can develop on a ship, and really a minister is the only third possible when
  one's butler is the second. And this sort of conversation went on until eight
  bells rang, which is midnight, and I said good night to Mr Price and we went
  back to my cabin. Winter always makes a point of seeing me into my cabin at
  night.</p>

  <p>"When I got to my door and opened it I was surprised to find the lights
  turned on. I was about to remark upon the fact to Winter when a hand, a grimy
  hand, and a blue sleeve came round the open doorway from my bedroom, seized
  the switch and turned off the current. Mr Winter, in spite of his appearance,
  is a very courageous man and immediately ran into the room, switched on the
  light and dashed into my bedroom, which was in darkness just as he did so he
  saw a man slip through the window on to the foredeck like an eel, disappear
  over the rail of the deck down on to the well deck and out of sight."</p>

  <p>"Good heavens!" said the girl in alarm. "Who was it?"</p>

  <p>"He is a sailor&mdash;one of the ship's sailors, and, of course, I've made
  a complaint to the captain."</p>

  <p>"What was his object, do you think? Robbery?" asked Margot.</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham nodded.</p>

  <p>"I'm very careless with my small pieces of jewellery," she said, "and
  there was quite a number lying about, but evidently we must have disturbed
  him, for nothing was missing."</p>

  <p>"Did you see his face?"</p>

  <p>"It was impossible for me, but Mr Winter said that the man was obviously a
  stoker. His face and his hands were black and he wore the blue dungarees
  which stokers on these oil-driven ships wear."</p>

  <p>Apparently the captain took a very serious view of the circumstances, for
  that afternoon all the stokers of the ship were paraded on the afterdeck and
  the sedate Mr Winter accompanied his mistress in an attempt to pick out the
  miscreant. In this, however, he failed&mdash;the nearest he got being to
  identify the man who was on duty at the moment the visitation occurred.</p>

  <p>At dinner that night the passengers were supplied with printed copies of
  the Ceramia bulletin, a little newspaper printed on the ship giving a summary
  of the world's news which had been received by wireless. Margot wondered
  whether there would be any reference to Mrs Markham's adventure.</p>

  <p>The girl read the little paper carefully but in the main it consisted of
  extracts from speeches delivered by unimportant people upon subjects which
  were age-old. There was the result of the tennis championship, a few remarks
  upon the bank balances and the shifting exchanges, and that was all.</p>

  <p>Margot was talking to the purser on the upper deck that night when Mrs
  Markham strolled up.</p>

  <p>"Your bulletin isn't very interesting, Mr Purser," she said.</p>

  <p>"It is as interesting as we can make it, madam," he answered, with a
  smile. "You see we can only take the news they send us."</p>

  <p>"Was there nothing else crowded out?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all, madam," replied the purser. "Were you expecting
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"No, no," she replied, with a shrug of her shoulder. "Only one pines for
  something more exciting than Mr Balfour's views on popular education."</p>

  <p>As she walked away the purser looked after her.</p>

  <p>"Has Mrs Markham told you what happened last night?"</p>

  <p>Margot nodded.</p>

  <p>"I wish it hadn't happened," said the purser in a troubled voice. "My work
  is quite hard enough without these wretched robberies or attempted robberies.
  There is generally something of the sort every voyage. When you get three
  thousand people in one hull it is any odds against your excluding a
  sprinkling of the criminal classes. Our own men on the ship are very honest.
  They've been with us for years and we've never had a complaint. Of course in
  the old days, with the stokers, we took on the scum of the earth, but now in
  the oil-burning ships we have our pick of the men and generally they are
  known personally to the chief engineer."</p>

  <p>"Mr Smythe?" she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, do you know him?"</p>

  <p>"I know of him," said the girl; "he is a friend of a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>She was unusually wakeful that night and sat on the deck long after the
  majority of the strollers had gone below, reading under a bulkhead light.</p>

  <p>She saw Mrs Markham leaning on the arm of her faithful butler, taking her
  final constitutional, and presently these two disappeared. Most of the lights
  on the ship had been extinguished, leaving bulkhead lights at rare intervals
  to furnish illumination for the late promenaders.</p>

  <p>She was making up her mind to go below when she saw a man walking slowly
  from the after end of the ship. He was in evening dress and he kept close to
  the rail, turning now and again to look upon the darkened waters. It was not
  until he came abreast of her that he turned his face and then she leapt up
  with a startled cry.</p>

  <p>It was Jim Bartholomew!</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">CHAPTER 8</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Jim!" she gasped, and put out both her hands.
  "Why&mdash;why&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ssh!" he said in a low voice. "Don't call me Jim."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"Call me John Wilkinson," he said, "that seems a fairly good name."</p>

  <p>"But Jim, what has happened? What does it mean? Why are you on the ship?
  It's delightful. I was so worried about your not coming."</p>

  <p>He looked around.</p>

  <p>"Walk to the rail," he said, "lean over and I'll talk to you. Margot,"
  &mdash;his voice was low and serious&mdash;"I want you to be a real friend of
  mine."</p>

  <p>"You need not ask me to be that," she said. She was trembling with
  excitement.</p>

  <p>"I am going to make a bigger demand on your patience than any man has made
  upon a woman before, I think," he went on. "First I want you to meet me here
  every night."</p>

  <p>"But why can't I see you in the daytime?"</p>

  <p>"Because," he said, "there are reasons which, thank God! you don't
  know."</p>

  <p>Her heart was beating wildly, she was afraid, afraid for him. A thousand
  wild speculations passed through her mind and she was no nearer the solution
  of the mystery.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand it," she said, and laid her hand upon his, "but I
  trust you and you're on board, and that's wonderful. What did you say your
  name is?"</p>

  <p>"John Wilkinson. Frightfully unoriginal, but it is the first that came
  into my head."</p>

  <p>"Where is your cabin?" He chuckled.</p>

  <p>"I haven't a cabin," he said, "at least not to myself."</p>

  <p>"But, Jim&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He squeezed her hand tight.</p>

  <p>"Dear," he said, "four days ago I could have asked you to be my wife. I
  could have taken you in my arms and you would have been mine, but I missed my
  chance. A kind of vanity, which men call pride, would not allow me to ask you
  because you had money and I had little, and today it seems that I am not only
  in danger of losing you but of breaking your heart, unless you keep steadfast
  and have faith in me and I, by the grace of God, can make good in the next
  four days."</p>

  <p>"In the next four days?" she repeated. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It seems strange, I who have talked about waiting for years to win out.
  I've got to make good in four days or I'm lost and finished. Now will you
  have that faith in me, Margot darling, and believe in me?"</p>

  <p>She nodded,
  snuggling up against him.</p>

  <p>"Now go below, dear, I'll stay where I am. There is a lynx-eyed ship's
  inspector coming along and I do not desire his company. Good night."</p>

  <p>He pulled one of her hands underneath his arm and kissed the fingertips.
  Margot went below a little delirious, for all that was not joy was fear, fear
  for the man she loved and whose danger she knew was imminent.</p>

  <p>The next morning she made a request of the chief steward which resulted in
  her being transferred from her loneliness to a seat at the purser's table.
  There were three other passengers, two of whom made no appearance during the
  voyage, and a third, a little German-American who had generally eaten his
  meal before Margot put in an appearance.</p>

  <p>"I never had such a table," said the purser in despair. "I can tell you
  I'm awfully grateful to you for joining me, Miss Cameron. You are making life
  worth living. In future every passenger who asks for a seat at my table must
  furnish me with a written guarantee that he will not miss a meal," he
  laughed. "In point of fact I've given another seat at the table to an Italian
  officer. Have you noticed him?"</p>

  <p>"The man with the baggy riding breeches?" said the girl.</p>

  <p>"That's the fellow," said the purser. "I think he must sleep in them."</p>

  <p>She had seen the dapper Italian staff officer, resplendent in grey and
  gold, had duly admired his polished riding boots, the generous proportions of
  his breeches, and the faultless cut of his high collared tunic.</p>

  <p>"Visconti is his name, Pietro Visconti. He's an awful swell in Italy. One
  of the attaches to the Italian embassy I believe. At any rate, he's
  travelling on a diplomatic passport."</p>

  <p>Soon after, the Italian officer made his appearance. He was a little,
  keen-faced man, very voluble, very polished, with a gift of bowing from his
  waist which was a little awe-inspiring. He spoke English fluently and would
  have fulfilled even Mrs Stella Markham's requirements in respect to his
  amusing qualities.</p>

  <p>It was not necessary that Margot and he should become good friends for
  Captain Pietro Visconti to confide in the girl in the afternoon that he was
  madly passionately in love&mdash;with another lady, at which declaration
  Margot heaved a sigh of relief. The lady in question was none other than Mrs
  Markham, about whose eyes and stature and beauty, purity of complexion and
  grace of carriage, he spoke without comma or full stop for half an hour.</p>

  <p>The girl was glad of the distraction, for if the days had seemed long
  before, this day was without end. She tried to sleep in the afternoon so that
  she might be fresh and bright for her interview with Jim that night, but
  sleep was denied her. It was on her return to the deck that she was the
  recipient of Captain Visconti's confidence. Another distraction came in the
  evening when Mrs Markham introduced the Rev Charles Price to her. Here she
  was agreeably surprised, for the Rev. Charles Price was a pleasant, well-read
  man who did not try to talk to her for her good and did not even reprove her
  when she lit a cigarette on the deck. Rather he held the match. He had been
  travelling in Europe for his health, he said.</p>

  <p>"Nerves?" asked the girl quietly, and he was surprised.</p>

  <p>"Yes. Why do you suggest that?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Because you're still very jumpy," she laughed. "You have been looking
  round all the time you have been speaking to me and you start at every
  sound."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"That's true," he said. "I think Mrs Markham's adventure has rather got on
  my nerves. I hate the thought of her, or of any woman, being liable to such
  an experience, though she is very plucky about it all."</p>

  <p>The steward was bringing round tea on little wicker trays and she shared
  her tray with Mr Price.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you're going out to your friends?" he said, taking the tea she
  handed him.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am in a way," she replied. "I am making a business visit, after
  which I'm going back to England&mdash;I hope."</p>

  <p>It occurred to her at that moment that there was no urgent hurry for her
  return. What Jim was going to do in New York she could not guess. Why he was
  there was beyond the wildest flights of her imagination. She remembered, as
  she had remembered a dozen times with a sinking of heart, that the next four
  days were vital to him. And where was he all this time? Why did he not appear
  on deck with the other passengers, and what&mdash;She gave it up with a
  little shrug of despair, and Mr Price, who had been watching her through his
  heavy&mdash;rimmed glasses, handed back his empty cup.</p>

  <p>"I think you want a little nerve cure yourself, Miss Cameron," he
  said.</p>

  <p>At dinner that night she found in addition to the bulletin a passenger
  list. She had been wanting this and had not dared to ask for one. She went
  carefully through the long columns of names and came to the end with a blank
  face.</p>

  <p>Jim was not there, either in his own name or as John Wilkinson. She closed
  the pamphlet thoughtfully and put it by the side of her plate.</p>

  <p>"Were you looking for anybody, Miss Cameron?" asked the purser.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;er&mdash;yes," she said with as much carelessness as she could
  assume; "a friend of mine said he might travel by this ship&mdash;Mr
  Wilkinson, John Wilkinson."</p>

  <p>The purser shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We haven't a Wilkinson aboard, either in the first, second, or third
  class. I know that because I had to go through the landing tickets today and
  compare them with the list."</p>

  <p>"Not on board?" she said incredulously.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said emphatically '"We have no passengers by the name of
  Wilkinson, which is rather an unusual circumstance, because it is a fairly
  common name. But for the matter of that I once went three voyages without a
  Smith!" He had to leave the table early for the pressure of work in the
  purser's department had been increased by the breakdown of his assistant.</p>

  <p>"Oh, by the way, Miss Cameron," he said as he was leaving, "if you would
  like an unusual experience tonight and you can keep awake so long, I will
  take you to the wireless room."</p>

  <p>Her eyes sparkled.</p>

  <p>"I'd love that!" she said. "But aren't you too busy?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Even a purser is allowed time to sleep," he said humorously "Could you be
  on the top deck at half-past twelve; and I will take you up."</p>

  <p>She had arranged to meet Jim and the interview was for twelve and it would
  be short. She nodded.</p>

  <p>It was half-past eleven when she came on the deck and at five minutes to
  twelve Jim came strolling along by the rail, pausing more frequently tonight
  to look out to sea because the weather was finer and the ship's motion was
  steadier and there were more passengers taking the air.</p>

  <p>She walked down to meet him, noting that he had stopped between two
  bulkhead lights and leant over the rail. He was as correctly dressed as he
  had been on the previous night, but she thought his face looked a little
  peaky and worn.</p>

  <p>"It has been rather hot today," he said, when she asked him if he was not
  feeling well, "and I have been&mdash;er&mdash;in my cabin."</p>

  <p>"Did you see Frank before you came away?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I hadn't time," he said. "I didn't leave until Friday night."</p>

  <p>She did not ask him why realising that that was tacitly forbidden.</p>

  <p>"Margot," he asked suddenly, "will you tell me something about your
  sister-in-law?"</p>

  <p>"Cecile," she said in surprise. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"But, my dear, you know all there is to be known about her. She was
  married some seven years ago to Frank."</p>

  <p>"What was she before she was married?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean? She was well off. She was the daughter of Henrick
  Benson, who was a rich man and an artist. You remember he carved that ring
  which you called the Daughters of the Night."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you know anything else about the family?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, except that her sister, of whom she was very fond, had married
  unhappily when she was a girl of eighteen. I never heard very much about it
  because Cecile doesn't talk about those things. She ran away from college
  with a chauffeur or something, and naturally that isn't a thing Cecile would
  say much about. Anyway the poor girl died."</p>

  <p>"I know that," said Jim. "Do you know what became of her husband?" The
  girl hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Even that I am not certain about, but I have an idea that he was a pretty
  bad man and&mdash;and&mdash;went to prison for some crime. That is only an
  impression I have rather from what Cecile did not say than what she said,
  Magda's life was a tragedy&mdash;that was her name. Why do you ask me all
  this, Jim? No, no, I'm sorry I've broken the rule."</p>

  <p>He leant toward her with a glance to left and right and kissed the tip of
  her ear.</p>

  <p>"Pray hard for me, Margot. Pray like smoke for the next three days, for I
  am up against it good and hard."</p>

  <p>She pressed his arm,</p>

  <p>"I do pray for you," she said quietly</p>

  <p>"And have faith in me, whatever you hear." She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Now go down below, dearie, and let me make a furtive way to my hiding
  place."</p>

  <p>She was leaving when he clutched her arm and drew her to the rail. Two
  passengers, young men were strolling toward them talking. One she remembered
  having seen before, the other was a stranger. They were apparently ordinary
  first class passengers in the conventional garb of their class, but their
  appearance had a remarkable effect upon Jim.</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?" she whispered as they passed. "Do you know them?"</p>

  <p>"One of 'em," said Jim grimly "The fellow nearest to us&mdash;phew!"</p>

  <p>"Who is he?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I can guess," he said quietly "The last time I saw him he was stripped to
  the waist and answered to the name of Nosey&mdash;on the whole I think it was
  a pretty good guess on the part of the man who named him. Go, dear, I must
  get away."</p>

  <p>When she went back to the deck again he was gone and the mysterious
  "Nosey" had also disappeared. She was joined soon after twelve by the purser,
  who showed her up the narrow gangway leading to the wireless room between the
  two giant smokestacks of the Ceramia. It was a hot little room, blazingly
  illuminated, for the valve lamps of the switchboard added to the glare of the
  overhead lights. The operator, a spectacled young man, explained to her the
  workings of the instruments, and presently she sat with earpieces clamped to
  her head listening delightedly to the shrill intermittent whine.</p>

  <p>"That's the Campania," explained the operator. "She's three hundred miles
  astern."</p>

  <p>"How wonderful!" said the girl. "And what is that other noise?"</p>

  <p>He was lengthening the wave length, and "the other noise" was a shrill
  almost imperceptible succession of sharp thin whistles.</p>

  <p>"That is Aberdeen. It is the last you will hear from the old country," he
  said. "We shall be out of range tomorrow."</p>

  <p>One of the operators looked across.</p>

  <p>"I expect that's the news coming through," he said. "Excuse me, miss. If
  you don't mind I'll take it down."</p>

  <p>He fastened the receivers to his ears and sat down, jerking an ebony key
  under his hand.</p>

  <p>Presently he began to write. He looked round at the purser.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether it's worth while taking this down, sir," he said;
  "the chief officer said that no reference to the Moorford murder should
  appear in the bulletin."</p>

  <p>"Moorford&mdash;murder?" said the girl anxiously. "Why, what was
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it's been censored out of the bulletin by the chief officer," said
  the purser. "I suppose he doesn't want to alarm the criminal in case he
  happens to be on board this ship. It happened at a bank."</p>

  <p>The girl stood with
  her back to the wall or she would have staggered. Her face was deathly white,
  but none noticed this in the fierce rays of the lamps.</p>

  <p>"The assistant manager, a man named Stephenson, I think, or Sanderson, was
  shot dead, and the manager, Bartholomew, was found with a revolver in his
  hand. Apparently that could have been explained away because Bartholomew had
  only left the police inspector a few minutes before, but that night
  Bartholomew disappeared taking with him a diamond necklace worth &pound;112,000
  which curiously enough is the property of a lady on this ship. We've just had
  a wireless through informing her of her loss and I'm delivering it in the
  morning."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;what happened to Bartholomew?" asked the girl in a strangled
  voice.</p>

  <p>"He got away," said the purser, with a shrug. "Clean away apparently. Of
  course, they may have caught him since the last message came through. Is
  there anything in that?" he asked the operator.</p>

  <p>"No, just a few extra bits of news. They have arrested a man in France,
  but it turns out that he is not Bartholomew." </p>

  <p>She took a step forward and
  would have fallen but for the support of the purser's arm.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">CHAPTER 9</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Why, Miss Cameron," he said, with concern, "I'm awfully
  sorry that I brought you here. Those lights are strong and the room is
  stifling."</p>

  <p>He led her out on to the boat deck on a level with which the wireless
  cabin was situated, and found a chair for her.</p>

  <p>"Just wait here. I'll get you a glass of water," he said, and hurried
  below.</p>

  <p>A figure in the shadow of one of the boats moved and she saw the gleam of
  a white shirt front.</p>

  <p>"Jim!" she whispered in agony "Jim!" </p>

  <p>He crossed to her noiselessly and she
  saw that he was barefooted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Jim, I know! What does it mean? What does it mean?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"You've heard?" he said quietly</p>

  <p>She could only nod.</p>

  <p>"You have faith in me, Margot, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>She drew a long breath and
  raised her eyes slowly to his.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Jim. I have faith," she said, and he bent down and held her for the
  space of a few seconds in his arms, his lips to hers.</p>

  <p>The sound of the purser's boots on the brass-edged companionway sent him
  melting into the shadows.</p>

  <p>"I'm better now," she said, as she took the glass with a shaking hand.</p>

  <p>"You don't look very much better," said the purser. "I can't tell you how
  sorry I am. I ought to have known that the room was too hot."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, it's all right," she said. "It was my own fault, really I&mdash;I
  had too much wine for dinner."</p>

  <p>"What a confession!" he said indignantly. "You forget you sit at my table,
  Miss Cameron. Why, you haven't had wine since you've been on the ship."</p>

  <p>She laughed, but there was a note of hysteria in her laugh, and the purser
  was very glad to hand her to her maid.</p>

  <p>Murder! Murder! The words rang in her ears as she tossed from side to side
  in her bed that night. The rush of the waters against the skin of the ship,
  the wail of the wind as it struck the scuttle of her open port, all seemed to
  carry the same burden of sound.</p>

  <p>It was impossible, Jim couldn't have done it.
  Jim, who used to talk mockingly of being a bank robber. It was absurd. It was
  tragic and yet here was a fact. There was a warrant against him and his
  flight confessed his guilt.</p>

  <p>What could she do? She asked herself that question a thousand times and
  found no satisfactory answer. She could only have faith and wait, but where
  was Jim? In what part of the hold was he hiding? How could he escape the
  scrutiny of the inspectors who searched every yard of the ship twice a day
  for signs of stowaways, who examined the boats and penetrated into the
  noisome darkness of the ship's most secret places in search of unauthorised
  passengers?</p>

  <p>She might ask these, and endless strings of other questions, and yet
  remain unsatisfied. It was nearly six o'clock before she dozed off and the
  lunch bugle was sounded before she appeared on deck.</p>

  <p>"I was wanting to see you," it was Stella Markham who beckoned her. "I've
  had some terrible news."</p>

  <p>Margot knew full well what that news was and at that moment she hated this
  languid, drawling woman as she had never hated any human being before. But
  for her wretched diamonds this crime would never have occurred. Why had she
  not taken them somewhere else? To London, or New York. She turned an
  inquiring face to the older woman.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she said, with an air of unconcern.</p>

  <p>"I have lost a large dog collar of diamonds&mdash;stolen, my dear, by the
  bank manager," said Mrs Markham. "Of course, the bank will make good the loss
  because I am insured for them, but they were the finest stones&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Are you on the stage?" asked Margot rudely.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl, no, why?"</p>

  <p>"I thought only actresses lost diamonds worth &pound;112,000 and dog collars made
  of the finest stones," said the girl, exasperated beyond reason. "Why do you
  leave them about or take them to banks; why don't you wear them and take all
  your own risks?"</p>

  <p>The woman's thin eyebrows rose, and then she laughed.</p>

  <p>"I forgot," she said; "it was the amusing bank manager who took them, and
  he was a friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"He still is a friend of mine," flamed the girl.</p>

  <p>"But how very interesting to know people of that class!" mocked Stella
  Markham.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you mean by that class," the girl was in a cold fury.
  "All I know is that your vanity and lack of forethought have brought about a
  good man's downfall" (Mrs Markham smiled indulgently) "and a poor decent
  man's death."</p>

  <p>"Death?"</p>

  <p>The smile vanished from Mrs Markham's face.</p>

  <p>"Who is dead?" she asked quickly</p>

  <p>"Stephen Sanderson, the assistant manager. He was found shot dead in his
  office the night before we sailed."</p>

  <p>The woman's face went suddenly old.</p>

  <p>"Mother of God!" she whispered. "Shot dead! No, no!" So terrible was the
  change in her appearance that Margot stepped up and caught her arm.</p>

  <p>"Why, what is it?" she asked, but Mrs Markham made no reply. She shook her
  head and then crumpled up back into her chair. She had fainted.</p>

  <p>To Margot Cameron the memory of the days that followed seemed to her to be
  the memory of bad dreams. That night she was in her accustomed place to meet
  Jim, but Jim did not come. Earlier she had met the Rev. Mr Price and Mrs
  Markham walking along the deck. Mrs Markham had fully recovered and was
  apologetic. At least she said she had fully recovered from her fainting fit,
  but the girl saw the dark rings round her eyes and drew her own
  conclusions.</p>

  <p>"It is silly of me, but I never could hear of violent death without
  fainting," she said, "and it came as a double shock to me because I knew the
  poor man."</p>

  <p>"Mrs Markham has been telling me the sad news," said Mr Price. "It was
  terrible, terrible."</p>

  <p>He shook his head and there was conviction in his voice.</p>

  <p>"That may account for&mdash;" began Mrs Markham.</p>

  <p>"For what?" asked the gentleman when she paused.</p>

  <p>"For what the deck steward told you this evening."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes," said Mr Price, staring over the side of the ship.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"The deck steward told me that there were two detectives on board. I
  cannot discover whether they are first class passengers."</p>

  <p>A new panic seized the girl.</p>

  <p>"Detectives?" she said shakily "Who are they? Could you point them
  out?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Mrs Markham, with a hint of irritation. "Winter will probably
  know them, he's of that class of man who mixes with&mdash;detectives."</p>

  <p>"It is terrible!" said Mr Price again.</p>

  <p>The story of the bank tragedy seemed to have affected him deeply.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;think I'll go to bed," he said, "if you ladies will
  excuse me."</p>

  <p>He turned abruptly and left them.</p>

  <p>"I like that man," said Margot. "I don't know why but I think I like
  him."</p>

  <p>"Do you?" said Mrs Markham indifferently. "Yes, he's quite a nice man, I
  should think."</p>

  <p>"Your man is not with you tonight."</p>

  <p>"He is under the weather," said Mrs Markham brusquely. "We had a head sea
  this morning and that was quite enough to put Mr Winter hors de combat."</p>

  <p>It was after this that Margot waited for Jim's appearance. She was still
  waiting when the watch came to hose the deck. She retired to her cabin that
  night and wept, almost for the first time in her life. She could not sleep,
  and at five o'clock when the dawn was showing through her porthole she got
  up, dressed herself and went out on the deck.</p>

  <p>The elevators were not running at that hour and she had to climb the broad
  companionway. When she reached C Deck she remembered Mrs Dupreid and smiled
  in spite of her sadness at the idea of calling on her at five o'clock in the
  morning.</p>

  <p>Nevertheless she turned back and looked down the narrow passage which led
  to the stateroom.</p>

  <p>Mrs Dupreid's cabin door was ajar and there was a light burning. Perhaps,
  thought Margot, she is as sleepless as I am, and after a moment's hesitation
  she went down the passage and knocked at the door.</p>

  <p>At the knock the door swung open. The cabin was empty. What was more, the
  bed had not been slept in. Margot frowned. Probably Mrs Dupreid was on deck,
  and she climbed the remainder of the stairs and went out into the cold dawn.
  The deck was empty save for a patrolling quartermaster who looked at her
  without interest, being inured to the eccentricities of passengers, but
  presently came back to her and asked her if she would like some coffee.</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose any of the stewards are about so early miss, but I can
  get you some if you wish."</p>

  <p>She gratefully accepted the offer.</p>

  <p>He put a chair for her and covered it with a rug and she was beginning to
  enjoy the novelty of the experience.</p>

  <p>The ship was rolling a little and she thought of Mr Winter
  sympathetically. A grey sea was running and the skies were lowering and
  promised rain.</p>

  <p>"It will clear up before noon," said the quartermaster in the way of all
  quartermasters, whose lives are spent in explaining away bad weather to
  unhappy passengers, "That's the greaser watch going on duty."</p>

  <p>A string of men was coming along the deck.</p>

  <p>"They take a short cut in the morning when nobody's about."</p>

  <p>"What are greasers?"</p>

  <p>"They're the fellows who look after the engines&mdash;stokers we used to
  call them&mdash;it's pretty hot, I can tell you, down below with a
  temperature of 140. When they dragged a fellow out the other day it took two
  hours before he recovered consciousness!"</p>

  <p>"Poor fellow!" said the girl. "It is terrible that we people who live in
  such comfort do not realise what these men suffer."</p>

  <p>"Martha's Sons," said the quartermaster profoundly "or Mary's sons, I
  ain't sure which. A chap wrote a poem once showing that one lot of sons had
  to work for the other lot of sons." Margot nodded. The leader of the men was
  now abreast and they passed curious glances at her. She looked along the line
  and nearly dropped her cup.</p>

  <p>It required all her self-possession to remain silent, for the seventh of
  the men, barefooted and bareheaded, looking straight ahead, was Jim
  Bartholomew, clad in stained blue jumper and ragged-ended trousers that did
  not come far below his knees.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">CHAPTER 10</a></h2>

  <p class="first">He passed with the others at a jogtrot and left her
  speechless. The quartermaster was discussing with respectful fervour the
  inequalities of life and did not notice her agitation.</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss, that's what it is. Some of us work in the engine room below
  and some of us sleep on the upper deck. But them as works in the engine room
  below have pleasures which the upper deck people know nothing about. There's
  many a man in the stokehole, miss," he said impressively, "who's as much of a
  gentleman as the best first class passenger that ever sailed. Think of 'em,
  miss, human beings, like you and me&mdash;loving&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh don't," said the girl, putting out her hand.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry, miss," said the quartermaster in surprise, and a little
  flattered that his eloquence had produced so remarkable a response.</p>

  <p>"Will you get me another cup of coffee? I'm afraid I've spilt this," she
  said. He took the cup and disappeared.</p>

  <p>So that was it! That was the explanation of it all. Jim Bartholomew was a
  stoker! Then it came to her, in a flash. The chief engineer and the chief
  officer of the ship were his friends. It was the chief officer who suppressed
  the news of the murder. They had shipped him, taking all manners of risks for
  the sake of the man who had saved their lives at the risk of his own. And was
  down there. She remembered the story of the man who had been dragged out and
  had been two hours in recovering and shuddered. He was down there at that
  moment. Well, it would be cool there in the early morning&mdash;cooler than
  in the heat of the day.</p>

  <p>Then she recalled the mysterious "Nosey"&mdash;"The last time I saw him he
  was stripped to the waist." Was he a stoker too? She had not seen the man
  since that night. But speculation here was brief. Her mind went back to
  Jim.</p>

  <p>She made a brief calculation. If he went down at five he would come up at
  nine and probably not go on duty again until the afternoon. But the afternoon
  was the hottest and the purser had said that this was a hot ship, especially
  in the Gulf Stream. She wished that the man had not told her, and then
  repented of the wish. Perhaps that was the reason Jim had not come out to her
  that night. In this she was nearly right. He had been on duty toiling there
  in the bowels of this giant steamer and in an atmosphere which defied
  description. And he was doing it all for something, for someone. She knew
  that. It was not for himself. It was for&mdash;who else but for her? She was
  smiling when the quartermaster brought her a fresh cup of coffee. She was
  smiling when she lay down upon her bed an hour later for a doze, and when she
  woke cramped and stiff, for she had not undressed, at three o'clock in the
  afternoon, her first thought was of Jim Bartholomew, a fugitive from justice,
  labouring in the stifling heat of the engine room and she laughed.</p>

  <p>It was the laugh of pride, for she knew, none better, how terrible was his
  peril.</p>

  <p>Memory brought another recollection of the early morning, her visit to the
  cabin of Mrs Dupreid. As soon as she was dressed she made her way to the
  stateroom of Cecile's friend and knocked at the door. The same maid, who
  apparently spent most of her time in the cabin, came in answer to the summons
  and whispered:</p>

  <p>"Mrs Dupreid is asleep. She had a very bad night."</p>

  <p>"Indeed," said Margot politely. "What time did she go to bed?" It was no
  business of hers, and it was impertinence to ask, as she knew.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she went to bed before midnight, madam," said the maid, and Margot
  went back to the deck puzzled.</p>

  <p>Must there be a mystery about Mrs Dupreid, as well, she wondered? To
  Stella Markham she was more than ordinarily polite. This graceful creature
  had lost some of her poise in the last twenty-four hours. The undercurrent of
  insolence had gone from her tone and she was, as Margot told herself, more
  human than she had been before.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I had a very bad night," she replied to the girl's inquiry. "I
  hate this ship. There are times," her voice was vibrant with passion, "when I
  wish to God it were at the bottom of the sea!"</p>

  <p>"Ask the captain, perhaps he'll sink it for you," said Margot calmly. "He
  has the reputation of being a most obliging man."</p>

  <p>The woman shot a glance at her, but her obvious anger melted to a
  smile.</p>

  <p>"It's childish of me to give way," she said, "and I stand properly
  rebuked. Phew! Isn't it hot?"</p>

  <p>It was hot. The sea was like glass, for the quartermasters promise of a
  break before noon had been miraculously fulfilled. Overhead the sky was an
  unflecked blue, and only patches of gulf weed stained the sapphire purity of
  the ocean.</p>

  <p>"If it's hot here, I wonder what it is like in the engine room," said Mrs
  Markham in her conversational tone. "They tell me that one of the stokers, or
  greasers as they call them, died of apoplexy at midday. I asked the doctor
  going down to lunch, but of course he denied it. They never tell you the
  truth about these things on a ship."</p>

  <p>"I think this voyage is going to kill me too," said Margot unsteadily
  rising and walking to the rail.</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham, who saw in this act nothing more than a piece of restlessness
  on the part of her companion, resumed the knitting which the arrival of
  Margot had interrupted.</p>

  <p>Margot came back steeled to a further encounter. Somehow she knew that if
  it were true that a man had died, it could not be Jim.</p>

  <p>"How is your butler?" she asked. "Has he died of apoplexy?"</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham went on knitting, her eyes fixed on her needles.</p>

  <p>"No," she said after a while. "My butler is immortal." There was something
  in her tone which made the girl look at her.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean a good butler never dies," said Mrs Markham.</p>

  <p>Margot was looking up and down the deck. "I never see him about."</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, he keeps to the smoking-room. Here comes a friend of yours."</p>

  <p>"He is not my friend," said Margot quickly as the smirking Captain Pietro
  Visconti, resplendent in uniform, came marching along the deck.</p>

  <p>"Queer little fellow," said Mrs Markham, intent upon her work.</p>

  <p>"Yes," Margot added irreverently, "he looks as though he has come straight
  from the hands of his Maker," and the other laughed.</p>

  <p>The dapper officer halted at the regulation pace, saluted punctiliously
  each of the ladies and shook hands solemnly with Margot.</p>

  <p>"You were not down to lunch, miss," he said. "I am disconsolate. I
  promenade on this side, I promenade on the other side, but I do not see you.
  I climb to the boat deck and I promenade there also. I search in the social
  hall and in the palm court, but no, you are not there." Margot slipped away
  and left him with his divinity and hurried down to her friend the purser.</p>

  <p>"I want you to be awfully kind to me, Mr Bray," she said, when she found
  him alone in his office, sweltering in the heat, though the electric fans
  were going over his head.</p>

  <p>"You may be sure that your wishes will be gratified, Miss Cameron," he
  said gallantly. "I want you to break one of the most cherished rules of the
  ship."</p>

  <p>"What is the most cherished rule of the ship?"</p>

  <p>"Well, one is that you never give away secrets. You never tell us the
  number of knots you are going to run or what happens when the speed is
  reduced and why."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"Sometimes we don't know in the purser's department."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am going to ask you." It required an effort on her part and she
  had to swallow before she spoke. "Is it true that a&mdash;a stoker died
  today?"</p>

  <p>He looked grave.</p>

  <p>"The story's out, is it? Yes, it is perfectly true. What do they say he
  died of?"</p>

  <p>"They say heat apoplexy," she said, her feet trembling beneath her.</p>

  <p>"That isn't true. It was a blow-out that killed him, poor chap. I am
  awfully sorry. He has been with the company for fifteen years."</p>

  <p>The girl drew a long sigh of relief which sounded like a sob.</p>

  <p>"Thank you for telling me," she said huskily "I wanted to
  know&mdash;something about it."</p>

  <p>"Why Miss Cameron, one would think you had a friend in the stokehole," he
  laughed, as he opened the door for her.</p>

  <p>"They are all my friends in the stokehole," she said. "I am only just
  beginning to understand something of the burden which the Lord has laid upon
  the sons of Martha." And the purser, who stood between Martha's sons and the
  pleasant-living sons of Mary was silent.</p>

  <p>The day had not been without adventure for Jim Bartholomew. His watch had
  been relieved and he was passing down the narrow alleyway communicating with
  his cramped quarters for'ard when somebody tapped him on the shoulder, and
  looking round he saw the greasy black face of the man beside whom he had been
  working that morning,</p>

  <p>"I want to talk to you, Wilkinson," said the stoker in a low voice. "Turn
  into the bathroom."</p>

  <p>Jim obediently followed instructions,</p>

  <p>The bathroom was a bare room fitted with showers and a long line of wash
  bowls and it was empty.</p>

  <p>"What were you doing on the promenade deck last night?" asked the man
  called Nosey and there was authority in his tone.</p>

  <p>"I might ask the same question of you," said Jim. The other looked at him
  thoughtfully, then suddenly: "Of course! You're Bartholomew!"</p>

  <p>"That is a name," said Jim, "it is not necessarily mine."</p>

  <p>"Don't let us argue about that," said the man, "sit down
  somewhere&mdash;I'm dead tired, but I've got to have this thing out with
  you."</p>

  <p>They found two wooden stools.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to tell you this," said Nosey. "I'm a Scotland Yard man, and
  though I'm not after you I have power to arrest you and will probably do so,
  though headquarters do not believe you committed the murder or stole the
  necklace&mdash;my pal, by the way, has a very full report by wireless of the
  affair. Now, the best thing you can do, Mr Bartholomew, is to tell me all you
  know and be perfectly frank. You won't have many opportunities, because I'm
  leaving the stokehole tomorrow or the next day&mdash;I'm satisfied that none
  of the people I want are in the ship's company."</p>

  <p>There was nothing to be gained by evasion or silence and Jim told
  everything to the last detail. For an hour they sat, the detective
  interrupting occasionally with a question, and at the end when they rose, the
  Scotland Yard man dropped his hand on the other's shoulder,</p>

  <p>"There is somebody who is going to be pinched before this packet reaches
  the Hudson River&mdash;maybe it will be you."</p>

  <p>"I should hate you to go home empty-handed," said Jim politely.</p>

  <p>The routine of ship life had grown wearisome for Margot Cameron and she
  waited impatiently now not for the hour of sleep, but the hour of
  meeting.</p>

  <p>Once more she took her place by the rail on the darkest part of the deck
  that night, and Jim came along,</p>

  <p>He was, as usual, in evening dress.</p>

  <p>"You wonderful man," she breathed and moved close to him. "How is the work
  going? The big work, I mean."</p>

  <p>"I think it is going well," he said.</p>

  <p>He looked round.</p>

  <p>"That infernal chief steward will see me, and he's the last man I want to
  meet, because unhappily he knows me. Will you turn boldly with me and
  compromise yourself for everlasting by coming to the boat deck
  unchaperoned?"</p>

  <p>"I think I am compromised already," said the girl, and slipped her arm
  into his.</p>

  <p>The way up to the boat deck was by a narrow companion ladder, and she
  mounted first. There were one or two couples left, shadowy figures lying in
  their chairs, and the two moved for'ard, where the gangway is narrow and
  obstructed by bolts and stanchions. Between two boats was a narrow platform
  from which the lowering was directed, and into one of these tiny alleyways
  they turned.</p>

  <p>"Now I want you to tell me everything that has happened?" she said, and
  briefly he retailed all that happened up to the discovery of the body.</p>

  <p>"I can't understand one thing," she said. "Why did Cecile get out at the
  Halt and go to her car, and why didn't you tell Frank?"</p>

  <p>"Because I thought he knew," said Jim. "It puzzled me too. Did she say she
  was going to Scotland before she took her sudden decision?"</p>

  <p>"No," said the girl. "It all came out in the talk she had with Frank in
  the study. It was a serious talk, because Frank looked very worried when he
  came out and poor Cecile looked positively ghastly. But you haven't told me
  all."</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," he said, and he did not speak for a while. "There are two
  things. One I'll tell you and one I will keep until later, I will not tell
  you what happened after the inspector left me alone with the body. But this
  you shall know, and I want your help to solve the mystery. When I looked at
  poor Sanderson's hand I found that he was clutching a piece of paper. I
  prised his hand open and took out the corner of a photograph which had
  evidently been torn from his grasp."</p>

  <p>"A photograph of whom?" asked the girl quickly</p>

  <p>"Of nobody specially. It was just a corner, I tell you. All that was
  visible was a woman's hand."</p>

  <p>He was quiet.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl.</p>

  <p>"It was a hand, and on that hand," said Jim, "was a ring."</p>

  <p>The girl clutched his arm.</p>

  <p>"Not the Daughters of the Night?" she asked in a whisper.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the Daughters of the Night," he said.</p>

  <p class="first">Cecile! Her ring&mdash;and yet&mdash;</p>

  <p>"There was no doubt about it at all," he said. "Since I have been on the
  ship I have borrowed the chief engineers magnifying glass and the enlargement
  shows clearly every detail of the carved faces."</p>

  <p>She was very silent and they stood leaning over the rail watching the
  water foaming at the ship's hull.</p>

  <p>"Won't you tell me some more of what happened to yourself?"</p>

  <p>"Only this," he said. "I arrived at Southampton at daybreak and went
  straight on board. I knew Smythe, the chief engineer, would be there and I
  explained frankly all that happened and told him my suspicions which I
  haven't given to you. He got Stornoway down to his cabin and we talked the
  matter over at lunch. Two wonderful fellows, they are! They took the risk. I
  berth in the chief engineer's cabin&mdash;which is on this deck, by the way,"
  he said. "The steward is in the guilty secret, but he too is an old friend of
  mine."</p>

  <p>"What is going to happen in New York?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he said. "There are detectives on the ship, but I hardly
  think that they are looking for me."</p>

  <p>"What are they here for?"</p>

  <p>"They are after the Big Four. Did I tell you poor Sanderson's theory? Poor
  chap, almost the last thing he told me was the amount of reward that was
  offered for their arrest."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to think," said the girl after a while. "The photograph
  of the ring stuns me. It is the only ring of its kind in the world. Frank has
  often said so. Oh, but it couldn't have been-"</p>

  <p>She could not finish the sentence and he did not attempt to finish it for
  her.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that Cecile did this terrible thing?" she asked after a
  while.</p>

  <p>"Shoot Sanderson. Good Lord, no!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think she knew Sanderson? It almost seems as though she did. You
  remember how ill she became when she saw him from the car that day?"</p>

  <p>He did not reply for a while, then:</p>

  <p>"I should dismiss the possibility of your sister's guilt from your mind if
  I were you," he said. "I am perfectly convinced that she had no more to do
  with that murder than you or I."</p>

  <p>Suddenly from the darkness behind them rose a cry, a strangled cry like
  that of an animal. There was a scuttle of feet and the thud of something
  falling. At the first sound Jim had leapt into the darkness and the girl
  stumbled over him. She saw him bending over a dark object that lay against a
  bulkhead. He struck a match and looked down.</p>

  <p>"Who is this gentleman?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The girl looked over his shoulder, and shuddered at the sight of the blood
  that was trickling down the side of the unconscious man's head.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Mr Price," she said, "the clergyman."</p>

  <p>Evidently nobody aft had heard the cry, for they were left alone. Jim
  lifted the stricken figure and propped him up with his back against the side
  of a raft. Presently the man groaned.</p>

  <p>"How are you? Can you walk?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>At first he thought the man could not have recovered consciousness, for he
  did not make an immediate reply.</p>

  <p>"I'll try," said the voice, and with another groan he heaved himself on
  his feet with Jim's assistance.</p>

  <p>"Terrible, terrible!" he muttered and repeated, "terrible, terrible!"</p>

  <p>"Are you better, Mr Price?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm better. Who is that?"</p>

  <p>"It is Miss Cameron."</p>

  <p>"Very extraordinary. I fell over those bolts. It is so dark up here."</p>

  <p>"Who did this?" asked Jim.</p>

  <p>"Did what?" demanded the other.</p>

  <p>"Who hit you?" asked Jim again. "You're not going to tell me you fell over
  a bolt, because I heard you struggling." He struck another match. "And
  somebody tried to strangle you, there's the marks round your throat!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you've been dreaming, sir," said Price, "but thank you for
  your kind attention," and with this he staggered toward the companionway,
  holding on to the boats as he went.</p>

  <p>"Humph!" said Jim. "Well, that was fortunate."</p>

  <p>"Fortunate?" repeated the girl. "Why fortunate?"</p>

  <p>"Fortunate indeed," said Jim, his voice shaking. "I think you and I ought
  to be on our knees thanking God&mdash;at least I ought&mdash;and heaven knows
  I've got enough to be thankful for already."</p>

  <p>"Let's see where that cry came from."</p>

  <p>He went carefully along the narrow alleyways and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Just about here, I think," he said, "almost opposite the entrance to the
  wireless room. Now let's go along and see the wireless gentleman."</p>

  <p>He passed through the narrow doorway and up a short flight of stairs to
  the "public" office where passengers handed in their radios and where they
  were checked. There was a little pigeon-hole behind which sat an operator in
  his shirtsleeves.</p>

  <p>"Did Mr Price take his change?" asked Jim suavely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, he took his change, one dollar and fifty cents."</p>

  <p>"I thought he gave you a ten-dollar bill," said Jim at a random.</p>

  <p>"That's just what he did do, sir, and the cable was eight dollars fifty
  cents," said the operator patiently and Jim thanked him.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" asked the girl wonderingly when they were on the deck
  again.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to know the length of the message and whether he sent a message
  at all. He sent a radio which cost him eight dollars fifty cents, which means
  that he sent about forty words, which is a fairly long message. He had sent
  that message and it was when he came out that they set upon him, and I should
  imagine that Mr Price is an extremely lucky man that he is not over the side
  of the ship."</p>

  <p>"Jim, there's one thing I want to ask you," said the girl when he was
  taking leave of her. "If things work out, as please God they will, and you
  are put right in the eyes of the world, are you&mdash;are you&mdash;how long
  will you&mdash;" She found it more difficult to frame her question than she
  had supposed.</p>

  <p>"I will marry you just as soon as it is possible," said Jim, "even if I
  have to borrow the money from you to pay for the licence."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">CHAPTER 12</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Two more days. Today, tomorrow, and perhaps half another day
  was all that remained for Jim to put himself right. She did not doubt that he
  would win through, and yet the fear that he might not turned her cold. In the
  morning she was on deck immediately after breakfast and the first person she
  saw was Mr Price, sitting calmly in his chair reading a serious-looking
  volume. He touched his bandaged head to her in salute.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid I frightened you last night," he said. "It was very stupid of
  me to go wandering about the upper deck by myself."</p>

  <p>"I think if you had been by yourself you would have escaped injury," she
  said.</p>

  <p>He laughed, but his laugh ended with a little wince of pain.</p>

  <p>"I see your young friend has convinced you that I was attacked by
  somebody. Believe me, my dear Miss Cameron, that is not so. Probably the
  cries you heard were some foolish young people skylarking on the other side
  of the deck. I have often heard them myself and have been similarly
  alarmed."</p>

  <p>"You were attacked, and anyway Mr&mdash;my friend did not say he heard you
  cry out," she persisted, with a nod of her head, "you were struck after
  sending a long radio message to New York."</p>

  <p>He dropped the book he was holding with a nervous start and looked at her
  between his half-closed eyes.</p>

  <p>"You're not Miss Withers, by any chance?" he said in little more than a
  whisper.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Who is Miss Withers?" she demanded. "Oh, I know there's a woman
  detective. Mr"&mdash;it was only by biting her tongue that she could keep Jim
  Bartholomew's name unsaid&mdash;"Mr Wilkinson told me that there was such a
  person."</p>

  <p>"Yes, there is a person named Withers, Agnes Withers I think her name is,"
  he said lazily. "I seem to remember her figuring in a case and it must have
  been in her capacity as a detective. No, I meant another Miss Withers, an old
  friend of my&mdash;er&mdash;aunt."</p>

  <p>Captain Pietro Visconti came along just
  then and carried her off.</p>

  <p>"I do not like that priest," he said. "I never did like priests." He
  twirled his little moustaches thoughtfully. "They are wolves in sheep's
  clothing. They are very bad for the young," he smirked.</p>

  <p>He was in a less emotional mood that morning, and sitting by her in Stella
  Markham's chair (Margot wondered whether he derived any extraordinary
  satisfaction from that association with the woman he so brazenly and openly
  worshipped) he talked about Italy and Milan his home; of his career in the
  army and during the war (she found afterwards that he had fought with
  distinction on the Tagliamento), and spoke so intimately of Washington that
  she asked him if he had been there before.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Several times, but in a humble capacity, not as second attach&eacute;, to the
  greatest military nation on the earth."</p>

  <p>She smiled, and he reminded her gravely that the Romans had taught the
  world the art of war. He had to vacate his chair, for Stella Markham put in
  an appearance. The curious oldness which had come to her face, and which
  Margot had noticed two days before, had not entirely disappeared, She looked
  as if she had had no sleep and confirmed this impression with her first
  words.</p>

  <p>"I saw the daybreak this morning," she said.</p>

  <p>"I've seen it one or two mornings," laughed Margot. "Can't you sleep?"</p>

  <p>The woman shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I haven't slept since I left Tor Towers," she said, and raised her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Great heavens, why did I ever leave there?"</p>

  <p>"But you're going back, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I shall be compelled to," said Mrs Markham after a pause. "I
  shall have to if there is any question of the insurance on my
  jewels&mdash;those which were stolen, you know, I have sent a radio to a firm
  of lawyers in London to watch my interests and I do not suppose there will be
  any very great difficulty. Well?"</p>

  <p>It was Mr Winter, her butler, not as jovial or as rubicund as usual. He
  stood in a deferential attitude.</p>

  <p>"There is a radio for you in your cabin, madam," he said.</p>

  <p>"All right, Winter." She dismissed him with a nod. "Even he is brightening
  up," she explained. "What has happened to Mr Price?"</p>

  <p>She was standing a little ahead of the chairs and looking along the deck.
  She had seen the white bandage about the clergyman's head.</p>

  <p>"Do you know Miss Cameron?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the girl quietly "I think he met with an accident last night
  on the boat deck."</p>

  <p>"An accident? I knew nothing about that."</p>

  <p>She walked along to Price and sat in a chair by his side for some
  time.</p>

  <p>In the restless way of an ocean passenger Margot dropped her book and went
  walking. She picked up en route a little German-American who was her table
  companion. He was going back to America to marry and was very shy until she
  drew him out, then found him something of a rhapsodist.</p>

  <p>She had made the second circuit of the deck and was approaching the spot
  where Mrs Markham sat talking to the clergyman when she saw the butler come
  from the companionway. He stood at some distance and waited until he caught
  Stella's eye. She rose and went downstairs, the butler following.</p>

  <p>It was late in the afternoon before Margot saw Mrs Markham again. This
  time they met in the social hall where Margot was taking tea listening to the
  band, her heart and mind in the engine room below; for every thud of the
  screw reminded her of the man whose future was hanging by a thread.</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham sailed in, radiantly beautiful to the girl's admiring eyes and
  wearing a dress of such design as turned a hundred pair of feminine eyes in
  her direction.</p>

  <p>She pulled up an armchair to Margot's side.</p>

  <p>"Where are you staying in New York?"</p>

  <p>Margot gave her an address.</p>

  <p>"I should like to see you there," said Mrs Markham. "I am going on to
  Richmond, but I shall be back in New York in a week or ten days."</p>

  <p>Insensibly Margot realised that Stella Markham's attitude had changed.
  From the light, almost patronising acquaintance, she had developed into a
  would-be friend. And her subsequent attitude supported Margot's theory. She
  talked of Devonshire, tried to get Margot to tell her something of their home
  life at Moor House, and expressed her regret that they had not met during
  their stay in England.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you'll be met at New York?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Margot. "I shall probably be met by my brother's
  lawyer&mdash;in fact, I think it is certain I shall be."</p>

  <p>"Who are his lawyers?" she asked interestedly. "Mine are Peak and
  Jackson."</p>

  <p>"John B. Rogers is Frank's lawyer. He used to be District Attorney."</p>

  <p>"I know him," nodded Stella, "at least I know him by repute. And everybody
  else, of course, knows him in New York."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think he's rather popular."</p>

  <p>"I'm going on to Richmond immediately," said Mrs Markham thoughtfully,
  "and I brought a box of candies from Paris which I promised to give to a
  friend of mine the very day I landed."</p>

  <p>"Why not hand them to a messenger?"</p>

  <p>"Because I don't know my friend's address. I told her to call for me at
  the very hotel you're staying at. I wonder if you would mind handing them to
  her and telling the clerk, if anybody inquires for me, to send her to
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said the girl, with a smile.</p>

  <p>It was one of those little commissions which she detested, but she thought
  that under the circumstances it would be ill-mannered to refuse.</p>

  <p>"I will give you the candies before we leave the ship," said Mrs Markham.
  "Perhaps you will come down to my cabin&mdash;I've some lovely frocks I would
  like to show you. Why not come down this afternoon&mdash;now?"</p>

  <p>Margot was curious to see Mrs Markham's cabin and accompanied her without
  hesitation. Her suite was at the fore end of A Deck and consisted of two
  rooms, a bedroom and sitting room, the former of which was nearest the bow.
  It was a very pleasant cabin, though not in many respects as pleasant as
  Margot's own suite. The dresses that Stella Markham showed were beautiful and
  they alone were worth the visit. She was saying goodbye when Mrs Markham
  called her back.</p>

  <p>"You might as well take these candies along now," she said, and pulled a
  steel box from under the bed. She tried the key in the lock and found some
  difficulty in inserting it. She held up the box and examined the keyhole
  closely.</p>

  <p>"Somebody has been tampering with this," she said, and again Margot saw
  that drawn look in her face. After a while she succeeded in turning the key,
  lifted the lid and took out a flat circular package from which she stripped
  the wrappings, revealing a beautiful, satin-covered box, the top of which was
  hand-painted. This in turn she lifted and showed a layer of the most
  delicious-looking candies Margot had seen.</p>

  <p>"You don't mind taking these, do you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said Margot heartily and waited until the box was wrapped
  and tied about with string. She carried the package back to her cabin and put
  it in her trunk. Stella Markham puzzled her. At first she thought she
  understood her perfectly but every day presented some fresh phase, some new
  angle of the woman, and Margot felt her confidence in her own judgment
  shocked by the contradictions and irreconcilable phases of her character.</p>

  <p>As she was stepping out of the elevator on the promenade deck Stella was
  waiting for her.</p>

  <p>"I feel I must make this confession," she said; "there's a duty on sweets,
  and it struck me that if your friend the District Attorney sees you through
  the customs, he is so well known that nobody will bother you with an
  examination."</p>

  <p>Margot laughed.</p>

  <p>"That idea had occurred to me," she said.</p>

  <p>Like every other day this was but a preparation for the night. To her the
  days began when she met her lover in the shadows of the boat deck and ended
  when they parted. All between was a weary interregnum relieved only by such
  excitements as chance brought to her. But of that excitement she was to have
  this day her fill. It began in the afternoon when she went into her cabin to
  find a not particularly agreeable odour of tobacco smoke.</p>

  <p>She rang the bell for the stewardess.</p>

  <p>"Who has been smoking in this suite?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nobody, madam, that I know of," said the woman in surprise.</p>

  <p>The girl sniffed around.</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't mind if they smoked decent tobacco, but this is terrible
  stuff!"</p>

  <p>She could not escape the impression that she had smelt that kind of
  tobacco before somewhere. She looked round the apartment and after a while
  she found what she was seeking, a little pile of cigar ash which had
  evidently been knocked off and had not broken in its fall. She examined it
  carefully and then very thoughtfully went back to the deck. She saw Captain
  Pietro Visconti sitting by himself and she went straight to him.</p>

  <p>"Captain Visconti," she said, "what were you doing in my suite this
  afternoon?"</p>

  <p>He had jumped to his feet as she addressed him.</p>

  <p>"In your suite, lady?" he said, with extravagant surprise. "I have not
  been to your suite."</p>

  <p>She unwrapped the little paper and showed him the cigar ash, and he
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are the Sherlock. You discover cigar ash, eh? Well, it is not
  mine. My cigars are peculiar."</p>

  <p>"Very peculiar," she said emphatically:</p>

  <p>"They are Italian," he explained, "but there are several people who smoke
  the same kind of cigars on this ship. I could find you a dozen. Why should I
  want to go into your room, Miss Cameron? I do not even know where it is."</p>

  <p>After such a flat denial she had to accept his statement and apologise.
  After all, he might have strolled in by accident. It was hardly likely that
  he would come furtively smoking a cigar. And yet now she came to think of it,
  she had never seen him without a cigar, and once he had told her that he
  smoked them so unconsciously that he did not know whether they were between
  his teeth or not.</p>

  <p>But if he came&mdash;why? Here was a problem she saved against her meeting
  Jim that night.</p>

  <p>The second thrill came after dinner. It occurred to the girl that before
  the chocolates could be delivered it would be necessary to know the name of
  the person who would call for them, and as she was on the top deck she went
  down the alleyway to Mrs Markham's suite.</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham was evidently in, for there was a light showing through the
  transom and she could hear the sound of voices. The girl knocked and at the
  same time turned the handle, never doubting that Stella Markham whom she had
  seen at dinner would be visible. To her surprise the door was locked.
  Presently she heard:</p>

  <p>"Who is there?"</p>

  <p>It was Stella Markham's voice which spoke, but the voice was so strange
  that she could hardly recognise her.</p>

  <p>"It is I, Margot Cameron," said the girl. "I wanted to ask you
  something."</p>

  <p>"One moment."</p>

  <p>The light was suddenly switched out and the door was opened two inches.
  Yet even by the indifferent light that was left Margot saw that the woman's
  eyes were red with weeping.</p>

  <p>"What is it, my dear?" asked Stella quietly.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to know the name of the person who is to call for those
  candies."</p>

  <p>"I will tell you later, dear. Will you excuse me now?"</p>

  <p>She shut the door almost in Margot's face and again she heard the murmur
  of voices. The other person was evidently a woman and it was unlikely that it
  would be Stella's maid. If Margot had any doubt upon that subject it would
  have been set at rest when she saw the maid later on the fore part of the
  deck.</p>

  <p>Who, then, was the visitor? Margot was not ordinarily curious, but she
  felt that it was her duty to collect information and in some indefinable way
  she was helping the cause of Jim Bartholomew by her efforts.</p>

  <p>Instead of going back to the deck she went into the broad saloon entrance,
  from which the side alleyways gave, and after waiting half an hour she was
  rewarded by seeing a woman come out of Mrs Markham's cabin.</p>

  <p>Instead of coming to the saloon entrance the visitor turned into one of
  the side alleys from which, as Margot knew, ran a smaller staircase to the
  lower deck. Instantly her mind was made up. She raced down the companionway
  to C Deck. She guessed rather than knew who the visitor was, and she was
  rewarded when she saw the tall black figure turn into Mrs Dupreid's
  cabin.</p>

  <p>So it was Mrs Dupreid, Cecile's friend! Margot's head was in a whirl. She
  gave up trying to think consecutively. Jim would know. It was another problem
  for him. She relied upon him, believing that he already held the threads of
  the mystery in his hands.</p>

  <p>The whole thing was beginning to bewilder her. Why did Mrs Dupreid visit
  Stella Markham, and why did Stella Markham weep? The thing was altogether too
  puzzling. She went to the quietest part of the ship, which was the library,
  and read one of Scott's novels and found in the artificiality of his unreal
  heroes and heroines something of calm.</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock the library lights were lowered as a general hint to all
  those who might still be enjoying its hospitality. There was another hour
  yet, but as they had agreed to meet on the upper deck there was no reason why
  Jim should not put in an appearance earlier. She blamed herself for not
  having suggested this, and, getting her cloak, she went on to the upper deck
  on the off chance of the same idea occurring to him.</p>

  <p>This night the deck was deserted. There was a dance in the saloon below
  which had attracted most of the younger people, and as she stepped cautiously
  along the obstructed way between the boats and the deckhouses she decided
  that it was just a little too lonely to wait alone and that if Jim was not
  there she would go down to the promenade again.</p>

  <p>But Jim was there.</p>

  <p>She stood stock still when she saw him. Dark as the night was, he was
  silhouetted clearly. He was standing by the rail at the end of the long
  boats&mdash;and Margot almost swooned, for there was a woman in his arms!</p>

  <p>Margot stood as though paralysed. And yet there was no doubt. She could
  never mistake Jim Bartholomew; the set of his head and shoulders was
  inimitable.</p>

  <p>It was Jim. He was whispering endearing words to his companion. She could
  hear the caress in his voice and the woman was crying. The girl held her head
  in her hands. Was she mad or dreaming? Was the ship filled with weeping
  women? She gasped. Was this Mrs Markham?</p>

  <p>She must have made some sound, for suddenly the couple went apart and the
  woman melted into the darkness.</p>

  <p>"Jim," said Margot hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear. I didn't expect you."</p>

  <p>"I guessed you didn't expect me," she said quietly with a pathetic attempt
  at humour. "Jim, who was that woman?"</p>

  <p>He was silent.</p>

  <p>"Who was that woman?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you, dear."</p>

  <p>"Don't call me 'dear,'" she said in a sudden fury. "Jim, who was that
  woman? Will you tell me?"</p>

  <p>"I can't tell you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Then I'll find out." She swung on her heel and ran along the deck,
  indifferent to possible foot-traps, and was back in the saloon entrance,
  breathless but determined.</p>

  <p>The first person she saw was Mrs Markham, who was talking to Visconti,
  waving a languid fan as she watched the dancing through the open door of the
  Social Hall. Margot went down the companionway at a run.</p>

  <p>It was she!</p>

  <p>She caught a glimpse of Mrs Dupreid's skirt as she disappeared into her
  cabin, and a minute later Margot was at the door knocking.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" said a muffled voice.</p>

  <p>"It is Margot Cameron."</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I cannot see you tonight. I am not well."</p>

  <p>"I am coming in to see you, Mrs Dupreid," said the girl with
  determination. "I am Margot Cameron, and Cecile is my sister-in-law."</p>

  <p>"You can't come in," said the woman again, but Margot pressed aside all
  opposition, stepped into the cabin and slammed the door behind her.</p>

  <p>"Now," she said, and then&mdash;"why, why...! Cecile!"</p>

  <p>It was Cecile Cameron, tear-stained and defiant, who faced her.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">CHAPTER 13</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Now, will you kindly tell me," said Margot, sitting heavily
  down on the settee, "what all this dam' mystery means?"</p>

  <p>"Margot!" said Cecile.</p>

  <p>"I know I am using violent language," said Margot recklessly, "but there
  is a time when respectability means stagnation. Will you kindly explain?"</p>

  <p>"I can't," said Cecile sadly, "only I want you to know that Frank knows
  I'm here."</p>

  <p>"That's one comfort," said Margot, a smile struggling in the corner of her
  lips, and the smile was one which was largely determined by her relief. "So
  long as Frank knows you are here&mdash;how did you come here, by the
  way?"</p>

  <p>"I decided to come on the boat and my friend Mrs Dupreid luckily was
  staying in North Devon. We were going to pick her up, if you remember, on the
  way to the boat."</p>

  <p>Margot nodded.</p>

  <p>"I had a talk with Frank and I told him certain things and he agreed that
  it would be best perhaps if I went. Only I couldn't go under my own name for
  certain reasons. I wanted to be alone and I wanted to have the freedom to
  work as I wished to work. I saw Mrs Dupreid and she very kindly agreed to my
  plan, which was that I should take her passport and occupy her cabin and she
  would come on by a later boat. That is to say when I can get the passport
  back to her."</p>

  <p>"That much I understand," nodded Margot. "But why are you here and why
  were you in Mrs Markham's cabin?" Cecile shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You've got to trust me, dear."</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, I'll trust you," said Margot hopelessly. "I've trusted and I
  trust you, and tonight I had to trust you both together in the most
  compromising attitude, Cecile."</p>

  <p>"I had to howl to somebody," said her sister-in-law. "I was surprised to
  meet him. You see, I take my little walks on the upper deck. I have to keep
  out of your way and I stumbled on him accidentally a night ago. We've been
  talking&mdash;" She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"So I gather," said Margot dryly, "and rather a nice way of talking too.
  And really dear old Cecile, I don't grudge Jim's sympathy a bit. Did he tell
  you that he himself is in need of quite a lot?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Cecile, nodding, "poor boy."</p>

  <p>"And I hope you were sympathetic?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I was," said Cecile indignantly.</p>

  <p>"And did he weep over you?" asked the remorseless Margot. "One good weep
  deserves another."</p>

  <p>"I think sometimes, Margot, you're absolutely heartless. But darling, I'm
  so glad to see you," she took the girl in her arms and squeezed her. "It's
  been a perfect hell of a life&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Ssh!" reproved Margot. "Now let's talk sensible. When am I to be let into
  this scandal?"</p>

  <p>Cecile looked at her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Maybe the day we reach New York," she said, "that's
  if&mdash;if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If what?"</p>

  <p>"If things go well," said Cecile guardedly.</p>

  <p>"Do you know"&mdash;it was Margot's turn to hesitate&mdash;"about
  the&mdash;the photograph? Cecile nodded.</p>

  <p>"He told me everything."</p>

  <p>"Did you ever meet Mr Sanderson before?"</p>

  <p>Cecile's back was toward the girl
  and she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Let that matter wait until we arrive, will you, dear, to please me?"</p>

  <p>"To please you I'll do anything. I wonder if that Jim has waited for me?"
  she said, and went tearing out of the cabin.</p>

  <p>An elevator was going up and she
  caught it, and arrived on the boat deck in time to whistle a disappearing
  figure.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's you, is it?" said Jim. "Well, did you slay the lady?"</p>

  <p>The girl
  shivered.</p>

  <p>"Don't let's talk about slaying people," she said. "Cecile is a darling,
  of course, but she's a most mysterious and exasperating darling just
  now&mdash;and Jim, was it necessary that she should weep on your shirt
  front?"</p>

  <p>"I couldn't very well take of my shirt," said Jim calmly and the girl
  smothered her laugh on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>They snuggled together in the little place between the boats.</p>

  <p>"When do you go back to your stokering?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Don't be frivolous about my stokering," he said; "it is a most
  unfrivolous occupation. Whilst you're here I am going to take you into my
  secret and if I do not tell you things that you want to know you must not ask
  me. You promise?"</p>

  <p>"I promise," she said.</p>

  <p>"In the first place I want to tell you, as I have told you before and it
  was quite unnecessary to tell you ever, that I did not steal Mrs Markham's
  jewels. That necklace was stolen by what poor Sanderson called The Big Four.
  It is pretty well confirmed, I think, that there is a Big Four&mdash;that is
  to say, a gang of four have been working together and have been engineering
  the big jewel robberies which have created such a sensation in Europe. It was
  a member of the Big Four who stole Mrs Markham's jewels."</p>

  <p>"Who are the Big Four?" she asked. "Oh, I beg your pardon. Is that a
  forbidden question?"</p>

  <p>"It is and it isn't," he said. "It is a forbidden question because it is
  one I cannot very easily answer. I can't answer it because I am not certain.
  We know that there are two people named Trenton, both of whom have served
  terms of imprisonment in the United States&mdash;Sanderson told me that. They
  are a man and a woman, and at this particular moment there are two detectives
  from Scotland Yard on board the ship who are searching very carefully amongst
  the second and third class passengers. The third of the four is a Spaniard
  named Antonio Romano. The fourth, and really the keystone of the arch, though
  he is not the leader&mdash;Trenton is that&mdash;is a man named Talbot who is
  an expert forger and has made the obtaining of jewels a special branch of his
  study. It is certain that two of the four are on board this ship. Scotland
  Yard has had information to that effect."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"Because one of the Scotland Yard men works in my watch," was the
  surprising reply.</p>

  <p>"Is he a stoker?" asked the girl, then quickly "the man you call
  'Nosey'?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. I guessed who he was that night on deck, and when he asked me if I
  was Jim Bartholomew, who was wanted for the murder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The girl went white.</p>

  <p>"You didn't tell him that!" she said faintly "Oh, tell me you didn't say
  that!"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes I did," said. "Don't be silly, darling. You don't suppose I'm
  going to be in hiding all my life? If I can't clear up this mystery on the
  voyage, I am going back to stand my trial and prove conclusively that I
  neither shot Sanderson not stole the jewels."</p>

  <p>He kissed her gently and presently her panic feeling wore of.</p>

  <p>"I shall be grey when this ship reaches port," she said.</p>

  <p>"And I shall be a deep oil-burnt red," said Jim. "Shall I go on?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, do, please."</p>

  <p>"Well, there isn't any more to say," he said disappointingly "and it will
  ease your mind to know that if I hadn't spoken to Sergeant Rawson, who is my
  companion in misery, I wouldn't have had a ghost of a chance of getting
  ashore in New York. When we anchor off Ellis Island there will be a young
  army of American detectives on board looking for the gang, and I think it is
  pretty certain they will find them."</p>

  <p>"Why?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Because one of them has turned States Evidence. He sent a radio to
  Washington on the night he was nearly killed." The girl would have cried out
  in her astonishment, but he put his hand over her mouth. "Mr Price?" she
  whispered.</p>

  <p>"Price, or Talbot, that is one of them. He is turning States Evidence and
  I'd have given anything to have seen the contents of his message. Talbot is a
  man who is going to do things, and he's the man who is going to restore to
  Mrs Markham her filched dog collar. And I hope she will let her dog wear it,"
  he added viciously.</p>

  <p>"Poor darling," she laughed. "Do you know I feel ever so much better and
  happier. This has been a really wonderful voyage."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't it?" he said sardonically "If you could see how sunburnt I am from
  the waist"&mdash;he changed his tone&mdash;"and yet it's worth it. I'd give
  twice the time in twice as difficult circumstances for this stolen hour with
  you." Then suddenly, "Let's go down on to the promenade deck and be
  bold."</p>

  <p>The deck was fairly clear of people and they walked up and down, talking
  of Devonshire, of America, of all things in the world save the thing that was
  in their hearts. At the end of the deck for'ard where it turned before the
  cabins on A Deck they saw Mr "Price." He was leaning over the rail, looking
  down at the deck below in a meditative and thoughtful way. About twenty yards
  away sitting in a chair under one of the bulkhead lights and smoking
  aimlessly was an exquisite young gentleman in immaculate evening kit. Margot
  recognised him as the passenger whom she had seen promenading with the man
  called "Nosey".</p>

  <p>"Do you see that lad?" asked as they passed him.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"That is the other detective. He's engaged in watching Price, or Talbot,
  to see that the gang do not get him. They nearly got him the other
  night."</p>

  <p>"But what a fine time he has, compared with the man in the
  stoke&mdash;hole!" said the girl.</p>

  <p>Jim chuckled. "They tossed as to who should go first class and my friend
  lost," he said.</p>

  <p>They made a circuit of the deck three times and still Mr Price leant over
  the rail with his head sunk on his chest and his arms folded. The fourth time
  they came round Jim stopped before the young watcher,</p>

  <p>"Our friend has been there some time, hasn't he?" he said.</p>

  <p>The watcher dropped his cigarette and looked along the deck.</p>

  <p>"Yes, he's been there for half an hour."</p>

  <p>"Has anybody been near him?"</p>

  <p>Evidently the detective knew Jim. (The girl discovered later that the two
  policemen and Jim had had a conference that night in the chief engineer's
  cabin.)</p>

  <p>"Nobody has been near him," he said. "Of course, lots of people have been
  walking past him like you and others."</p>

  <p>"I wonder what he's thinking about?" said Jim.</p>

  <p>"Poor man," said the girl pityingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, Price ought to be happy," replied the detective, with a laugh.</p>

  <p>"He had a radio from the American Government today saying that he will be
  pardoned and that his evidence will be accepted on behalf of the State."</p>

  <p>He strolled up toward the meditating figure, and laid his hand on his
  shoulder. "Now Mr Price," he said. "You ought to be going to bed, you
  know."</p>

  <p>Price did not reply and the detective bent over and looked at him. Then he
  turned and strolled back, his hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"I think, Miss Cameron," he said, "I think," he said carefully "you ought
  to go downstairs to bed."</p>

  <p>Jim looked at him, and the girl looked at Jim and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Is he&mdash;hurt?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Oh no, but he has little fainting attacks," said the detective. "Fits,
  you know, and people hate being seen when they're like that."</p>

  <p>She accepted the lie as gospel and with a smile to Jim went down
  below.</p>

  <p>Then Jim and the detective went forward and laid the dead man down on the
  deck and the detective pulled out the stiletto from his side.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">CHAPTER 14</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Nothing keeps a secret so truly as a ship. For a ship's
  company from captain to bellboy are born conspirators against revelation.
  None of the passengers, save those immediately concerned, who sat down to
  breakfast the next morning knew or guessed the tragedy which had been enacted
  in the night.</p>

  <p>Price's place at the table had been laid for him, his serviette folded on
  his left, his hot rolls and coffee were waiting for him at half-past eight,
  the hour at which he invariably took his first meal.</p>

  <p>The deck steward dried the spray from his chair, put cushion and books
  ready though he in common with every other deck hand knew that somewhere down
  near the keel of the ship, in a little room devoid of light, Mr Price lay
  dead.</p>

  <p>Margot knew so little that, discovering Mr Price's cabin, she sent down a
  message to ask how he was, and the steward, who at that moment was packing
  the murdered mans belongings, returned the message that he was a little
  better but was not coming on deck that day.</p>

  <p>The bellboy who brought the message to her, the deck steward who heard it
  delivered, the very band as they broke into a march at their eleven o'clock
  performance were all well aware that at twelve o'clock the previous night a
  passenger had been murdered in cold blood&mdash;but the passengers knew
  nothing.</p>

  <p>Mr Winter, the butler, was one of those who inquired for the Rev. Mr
  Price. He inquired of the smoke room steward. The smoke room steward, who not
  only knew that Mr Price was dead but had helped to carry his body below,
  replied that Mr Price had been in there a few moments before and had just
  gone out. That day, which had opened so sunnily was not fortunate from the
  point of view of the ship's run. Towards midday they ran into a dense white
  fog and for the rest of the day the Ceramia crawled forward at ten knots an
  hour, her siren blowing at deafening intervals. It was clammy and chilly on
  the promenades and the decks were so wet and slippery that even walking was
  uncomfortable. Nevertheless Margot maintained her chair and, enveloped in
  rugs, preferred the open air to the clearer atmosphere of her cabin. Not so
  Stella Markham, who retired to her own sitting-room.</p>

  <p>Margot had spent the greater part of the morning with her sister-in-law
  who had elected to remain in obscurity until the voyage was ended. She did,
  however, prevail upon Cecile to shift her cabin to the larger and more
  comfortable suite which Margot was occupying.</p>

  <p>"I shall have you near me, but there are two entrances to the suite, so
  you can go in and out as you like. I only ask this, that if you decide to
  entertain Jim Bartholomew you invite me to your party."</p>

  <p>Cecile smiled.</p>

  <p>"You've never forgiven me, have you, Margot?"</p>

  <p>"I've forgiven you because I have a Christian spirit," said Margot. "But I
  don't think that sort of thing ought to become a habit. If you want to weep,
  darling, you come along and weep on me. I'm ever so much less knobbly than
  Jim."</p>

  <p>The fog continued throughout the day but cleared up in the evening, only
  to gather even more densely after dinner. Margot had come to know the watches
  below which Jim was keeping and she knew that this was one of his early
  nights and there was a prospect of his getting on to the boat deck long
  before his usual hour. She simply sat and killed time with a book, wrapped up
  in her big rug cape, and Mrs Markham coming out on the deck with a face which
  expressed her disgust at the weather called her sanity into question.</p>

  <p>"Ugh! It's beastly," she said. "I wonder if we shall run into an iceberg
  or anything?"</p>

  <p>"You're a cheerful little soul," said Margot. "Have you ever been happy,
  Mrs Markham?"</p>

  <p>To her surprise Stella Markham turned on her with a face that was haggard
  with fury.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you know what happiness is if you ever think I've been
  happy, or you can trace any look of happiness in me, Margot," she said. "I've
  never been happy. I never shall be happy. How would you like to stand before
  your Maker and confess that much?"</p>

  <p>Margot was silent. She saw the woman's bosom rise and fall in her
  agitation.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry," she said gently. "I didn't mean to be rude. I was just being
  funny."</p>

  <p>"Of course you were." Mrs Markham's anger vanished and she dropped her
  hand upon the girl's shoulder. "I'm just full of nerves tonight. I'm going
  back to that infernal cabin to read."</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham was sick of body and sick of heart. True to her word she went
  straight back to her cabin and found Mr Winter waiting for her.</p>

  <p>"You have the key, madam," he said.</p>

  <p>She took it out of her pocket, put it in the lock and opened the door. The
  place was in darkness. So also was her bedroom, and this she approached,
  switching on the light. She heard the movement of feet almost as her hand was
  on the electric switch. The man who stood with one hand upon the open window
  ready to spring was in evening dress, but the lower half of his face was
  covered by a handkerchief.</p>

  <p>"Winter!" called Markham loudly and the butler came in. The masked man
  turned to face the levelled barrel of a revolver.</p>

  <p>"What are you doing here?" asked Mrs Markham.</p>

  <p>It was a question which was superfluous. Two drawers had been pulled out
  and their contents were strewn on one of the settees. The intruder had made
  no attempt to disguise his presence. The bed was rumpled as though the
  mattress had been pulled up and examined. A wardrobe was open and apparently
  the marauder had this time dispensed with the ordinary light, for he carried
  a small electric torch.</p>

  <p>"Put up your hands," said Mr Winter. "Put them up, sir."</p>

  <p>With a quick movement of her hand Mrs Markham tore away the mask from Jim
  Bartholomew's face.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I know you," she said; "you're a friend of Margot's."</p>

  <p>"Got me first time," said Jim.</p>

  <p>At first he had put up his hands before the menacing pistol, but now put
  them into his pockets.</p>

  <p>"'What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>Jim's eyes wandered from one confusion of
  effects to another as he smiled, and he had a particularly happy smile.</p>

  <p>"That's a silly question to ask!" he said coolly. "It must be pretty
  evident to you that I haven't been tidying up!"</p>

  <p>"You've been looking for something, haven't you?"</p>

  <p>"That's about the size of it," said "You can put your revolver away. Mr
  Winter. There is going to be no shooting."</p>

  <p>"I'm going to take you before the captain straight away," said Winter, His
  face was pale, whether from fury or fear Jim did not trouble to consider.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you will," he said gently. "After all, I can't run away
  from the ship. There's no necessity for disturbing the captain at this hour,
  even if they allow you to disturb him, which is extremely doubtful. You know
  me, you can find me when you want me."</p>

  <p>"Suppose we can't find you when we want you, Mr Bartholomew&mdash;I think
  that is your name?"</p>

  <p>"That is my name," said Jim.</p>

  <p>There was an awkward pause.</p>

  <p>"You can go,"' said Stella Markham.</p>

  <p>"You wouldn't like to search me before I went, I suppose," said Jim.</p>

  <p>"You can go," she said again, pointing to the door. She was whiter of face
  than Winter.</p>

  <p>"Wait," it was Mr Winter who blocked the entrance. "I don't think that is
  how it should be arranged, Mrs Markham."</p>

  <p>He was a strapping, strongly built man, but Jim pushed him aside as though
  he had been a child and walked past him on to A Deck. He missed the girl and
  guessed that she was waiting for him up above, and there he found her. She
  had gone to her cabin and changed from her flimsy evening gown to a costume
  more suitable for a tete-a-tete on a foggy night.</p>

  <p>"Tomorrow," were his first words, "I am going to be a respectable member
  of society. In other words, I am coming first class with my friend from
  Scotland Yard, who is just about as tired of stoking oil engines as I
  am."</p>

  <p>"What is going to happen?" asked Margot.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "tomorrow evening we pass Fire Island Light and some time
  later we anchor off Sandy Hook. The next day the Federal authorities come
  aboard and we shall see what we shall see."</p>

  <p>The fog was thinning, but the ship was still keeping to her steady ten
  knots.</p>

  <p>"You're a little tired tonight, aren't you?" she asked. "You're not
  speaking."</p>

  <p>"I've had rather an exciting experience," he said. "I'll tell you about it
  one of these days. And also I am a little tired. This fog means extra duty in
  the stokehole. Everybody stands by and the watches are doubled."</p>

  <p>"Then I won't keep you," she said dismally, and he caught her up in his
  arms.</p>

  <p>"That's just what you were proposing to do a few days ago, and maybe what
  you'll have to do yet," he said&mdash;"that is, if I escape jail."</p>

  <p>"Really, I think I'll go down and go to bed. Good night, Jim."</p>

  <p>He kissed her again and watched her as she walked back toward the
  companion ladder. Then he turned and strolled in the opposite direction.</p>

  <p>She was nearing the ladder when she remembered that she had not asked him
  about their next meeting and she turned back. When she saw him he was leaning
  over the rail where she had seen him with Cecile in his arms. He was more
  clearly silhouetted because the fog formed a white background for him, and
  she stood a moment watching him.</p>

  <p>As she did so she saw a figure steal out of the shadow of the boats, saw
  something rise and fall, heard the horrible impact as it struck and saw him
  droop limply over the rail. She tried to scream but she could not, Then
  before she could utter a word or move she saw Jim's assailant stoop and lift
  him by the legs, using the rail as a fulcrum. Higher and higher&mdash;and
  then the girl screamed. But it was too late. As the black figure darted back
  into the darkness Jim toppled over the side and she heard the splash as he
  struck the water. She screamed again and raced down the alleyway toward the
  stern of the ship. Her mind was made up and when she came to the limit of the
  deck she jumped on the rails, ripped of her skirt and taking one look to
  locate the dark figure which showed in the light from the portholes, she
  sprang, straight as an arrow into the water.</p>

  <p>It was not as chilly as she had expected and she came to the surface and
  looked round. She saw the dark bulk of Jim's shoulders and swam straight to
  him as he sank. Her arm was round him as the stern of the vessel cleared
  them. Then something struck the water with a splash and a vivid green flare
  burnt within three yards of her. She turned and saw the red lifebuoy with the
  spluttering calcium light and dragged Jim toward it. They had been seen, and
  even as she looked and saw the vast stern of the Ceramia towering above her,
  the liner turned sharply to starboard and suddenly the screws were still.</p>

  <p>She heard voices on the deck and the creak of a boat being lowered and
  clung desperately to the lifebuoy. Jim had recovered consciousness but was
  still too dazed to afford much help. She hooked his arm into the buoy and
  kept treading water. Suppose the light failed? Suppose they could not find
  her in the darkness? Already the ship seemed miles away and she could not see
  the boat if they had lowered it, but the calcium light burnt in a continuous
  splutter and presently she heard the creaking of oars and the ship's
  lifeboat, looking monstrously large seen from that angle, came alongside.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">CHAPTER 15</a></h2>

  <p class="first">They lifted Jim into the boat and the girl followed. She was
  attired only in blouse and petticoat, and it did not occur to her until the
  boat was hauled up to the level boat deck and then she was thankful for the
  mercy of darkness until somebody put a coat around her and she made her
  escape to her cabin.</p>

  <p>She had a hot bath and changed, and then in spite of the protests of
  Cecile went out to discover what had happened to Jim. She found him dressed
  in tweeds, the centre of an interested circle of passengers and he was lying
  outrageously.</p>

  <p>"I went to sleep and fell over the rails," he said. "Miss Cameron saw
  me&mdash;I don't remember anything until I recovered consciousness with the
  calcium light blazing and Miss Cameron holding me up by my ears."</p>

  <p>The quartermaster on watch aft had witnessed the fall and he it was who
  had thrown the lifebuoy. This Jim discovered later. The doctor had dressed
  his head and to Margot's relief the wound was not very serious. The man who
  struck it must have been nervous, for he did no more damage than a couple of
  stitches remedied.</p>

  <p>"As for you," said Jim when he was alone with her, "I owe you something
  more&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I'll present my bill one of these days," she interrupted hastily, "and
  now I'm going back to my cabin&mdash;you seem quite your old talkative self,"
  and with a gentle squeeze of his arm, she was gone.</p>

  <p>His head was racking the next morning when he woke.</p>

  <p>Accommodation had been found for him on F Deck and he shared a big cabin
  with the two men from Scotland Yard. The visit of the doctor, the application
  of a new dressing, and the swallowing of a draught reduced his agony to a
  mere irritation.</p>

  <p>That morning Mr Winter attended the commander of the ship and tendered a
  complaint against the victim of the last night's adventure. His complaint was
  listened to respectfully and he was informed that the matter was already in
  the hands of the authorities. Whereupon Mr Winter in his animosity grew a
  little venomous for one so respectable and typically English.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know, sir," he said, "that this man Bartholomew is a
  fugitive from justice and the police have a warrant out for him, on a charge
  of murder?"</p>

  <p>"I know all about that," said the commander politely. "Are you a police
  officer?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I am not," said Mr Winter, with dignity.</p>

  <p>"Well, there are police officers on the ship who are attending to that
  matter," said the commander, "and you can rest assured that they will not
  shirk their duty."</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham had chosen the time of Winter's appointment with the captain
  for an interview which she badly wanted. Visconti, idling about the deck as
  radiant and gorgeous a figure as ever, saw Stella come from the companionway
  and instantly obeyed her beckoning finger.</p>

  <p>"Will you come down to my cabin, Captain Visconti?" she asked,</p>

  <p>"Madam"&mdash;he bowed low&mdash;"what would give me greater
  happiness?"</p>

  <p>"I want to show you those Tanagra figures I bought in Italy last year,"
  she said carelessly and he followed her to the end of the alleyway and into
  her cabin.</p>

  <p>She closed the door behind him and motioned him to a settee.</p>

  <p>"Tony," she said, almost wailed, "Tony, what was wrong? Oh, my God! Why
  did you kill Talbot?"</p>

  <p>The Spaniard had set his kepi down on the seat beside him and did not
  raise his eyes from the floor.</p>

  <p>"Had he&mdash;?" she began again.</p>

  <p>"He had turned States Evidence," said Tony.</p>

  <p>"But how&mdash;when?"</p>

  <p>The man she called Tony shrugged his elegant shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He has been in a blue funk for a month past. You know that, madonna. I
  had to keep close to his side all the time he was in Paris and never let him
  out of my sight when he was in London. The discovery that there were
  detectives on board must have driven him into a panic, for two days after we
  sailed he sent a preliminary radio to Washington asking if evidence would be
  accepted from one of the gang and whether that member who betrayed the others
  would be treated favourably. On receipt of a reply he sent a longer
  wire&mdash;Winter saw him writing it and guessed what it was all about. Like
  a fool, too, Talbot had kept copies of his wires and Winter found them in his
  cabin."</p>

  <p>The woman was silent.</p>

  <p>"Who are the detectives?" she asked. "Do you know them?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is one who has been working in the stokehole with Bartholomew and
  another who has been amongst the first class passengers all the voyage."</p>

  <p>"Are they after&mdash;us?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether they're after you," he said. "I should think not.
  Talbot never suggested in his wire that you were on board."</p>

  <p>"But they will know," she said, fretfully plucking at her dress, and he
  rose slowly to his feet, walked across to her and laid his hand upon her
  bowed shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Madonna," he said earnestly "there is a way out for you, unless
  Winter&mdash;" He stopped and bit his lip thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she asked, looking up quickly.</p>

  <p>"I mean you cannot be associated with any of the jobs which we have done.
  That necklace business at Moorford&mdash;is that the name of the place?"</p>

  <p>She
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Even that cannot be charged to you. Winter's job again. Why did he do
  that?" he asked suddenly. "I always thought the diamonds were your own."</p>

  <p>She nodded again.</p>

  <p>"The only honest money I ever made in my life," she said bitterly.
  "Somebody who&mdash;who was fond of me gave me an option on Eastern Lands and
  that was the profit. I put the money into diamonds because Winter advised
  me."</p>

  <p>"You were foolish," said the other, "I see now Winter would not like you
  having independent means or money of your own and he threw your jewels into
  the stock. I have been interested in the fate of that necklace&mdash;today I
  am more happy about it."</p>

  <p>He looked down at her meditatively.</p>

  <p>"Shall I tell you something, madonna?" he said more softly than he had
  spoken, and she looked up with alarm in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"No, please do not."</p>

  <p>He gave one of his extravagant little gestures, but the hard brown eyes
  which had directed the stroke that ended the life of Talbot the forger were
  soft and humid.</p>

  <p>"I love you greatly, madonna, and I know that is a very bad thing for you
  to hear, because I am a man who has done many terrible deeds, but I worship
  you as children worship God." He paused and then went on slowly, "I will do
  everything to keep you out of this if our voyage ends badly."</p>

  <p>"But Winter?" she asked, and the Spaniard who posed as an Italian showed
  his teeth in a smile which was not pleasant.</p>

  <p>"I do not regret Talbot," he went on as though speaking his thoughts
  aloud, "I know the man and he was bad. If I have blood on my hands, so also
  has he. You do not remember the case of the girl Hien&mdash;no, that would be
  when you were in&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The door opened violently and Winter came in and his face was livid with
  rage.</p>

  <p>"Well," he scowled at Tony, "what do you want?" and Tony smiled.</p>

  <p>"Civility from you, my good Winter," he said lightly, "and a more amiable
  cast of countenance."</p>

  <p>"Amiable?" snarled the other. "Do you know that Fire Island Lightship is
  right ahead?"</p>

  <p>"The proximity of lightships does not distress me any," said Tony
  cheerfully. "Indeed, in such foggy weather as this, it is a pleasure to know
  that there is a lightship in the neighbourhood."</p>

  <p>"See here, Tony, don't get fresh with me. Do you know what the lightship
  means to you and me?" asked Winter.</p>

  <p>He had dropped his somewhat exaggerated English accent. His drawl and
  finicking intonation had gone and he snapped his words. There was a wicked
  look in his eyes as he towered above the dapper little man.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not get fresh with you?" demanded the other. He was his
  insouciant self and he stood in an attitude of careless ease which might have
  deceived any man but Winter, who knew that the thumb hooked into the pocket
  of those baggy breeches touched a long-bladed knife and that Tony would
  strike long before the bigger man could drop his hand to his pistol
  pocket.</p>

  <p>Winter forced a grin.</p>

  <p>"Well, be cheerful if you feel like it," he said. "There's no reason, I
  can tell you."</p>

  <p>"What did the captain say?" asked Mrs Markham.</p>

  <p>"What do you think he said?" growled the other. "He made me feel a fool.
  You've got everything, Tony?"</p>

  <p>The Spaniard nodded.</p>

  <p>"The dog collar?"</p>

  <p>The Spaniard nodded again.</p>

  <p>"When did you give him that?" asked Winter suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yesterday?" said the woman.</p>

  <p>Winter looked from one to the other suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"That's a lie," he said. "Where is that collar?" He made a step toward the
  deck.</p>

  <p>"You can save yourself the trouble," said Stella Markham coolly, "the
  collar has been removed to a safe place."</p>

  <p>His heavy face was puckered and
  lined with fury and he came back at her with a rush. Before he could lay his
  hand upon her or before Tony could slip between them there was a timid knock
  at the door.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" asked Winter.</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham had stepped softly to the door, but he pushed her aside and
  pulled it open. Cecile Cameron was standing there and their eyes met for a
  moment. The scowl went out of Winter's face and a sly smile dawned
  slowly.</p>

  <p>"Come in, Mrs Cameron," he said politely.</p>

  <p>She had no eyes but for Stella
  and went straight to the girl.</p>

  <p>"Well?" it was Winter who spoke. "What are you going to do to get your
  sister out of trouble?"</p>

  <p>Cecile turned in alarm.</p>

  <p>"Is she in&mdash;danger?" she asked in a low voice, and he growled
  impatiently.</p>

  <p>"We are all in danger, don't you realise that?"</p>

  <p>"I will do my best," said Cecile Cameron wearily.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to do a pretty good best too," said Winter brutally. "You
  can't save your sister without making some effort to save her husband."</p>

  <p>She met his eyes without flinching.</p>

  <p>"I think I can do something," she said. "There is no charge against her
  and she has no existence to the detectives on board."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" asked the man quickly. Tony, a silent spectator,
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"She has interviewed the excellent Bartholomew," he said, "and what she
  tells us is a confirmation of my best hopes."</p>

  <p>"Your hopes?" Winter swung round on him.</p>

  <p>"My hopes," said the other. "I desire most earnestly that madame should
  not appear in this matter if there is any question of police."</p>

  <p>John Winter was peering at him.</p>

  <p>"So that's it, is it," he said softly. "That's the meaning of your
  sister's meetings, her visits night after night, and you said she was only
  trying to induce you to give up this kind of life! You were lying, eh? I
  suppose you've got it all framed up to put it on me, now Talbot's dead. And
  Tony's in it!"</p>

  <p>"You're a fool!" said Tony quietly "I shall have to share whatever
  medicine they ladle out and I've got an idea it is going to be a stiff
  dose."</p>

  <p>Winter turned slowly to his wife. She was sitting with her head on her
  sister's shoulder and her eyes were closed. There was something pathetic in
  the weariness of the drawn face and the shadowed eyes, but Mr Winter was no
  sentimentalist.</p>

  <p>"If you think you're going to get this scandal hushed up and that I'm
  going to be the goat who goes to jail whilst my dear wife is playing the
  society lady in England or New York, why you've got another guess coming," he
  said, breathing heavily. "You're in this with me, Stella, or Magda, or
  whatever your fool name is, and I'm ready to take the stand and prove you
  were in every job we did in Europe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"And I'm prepared to take the stand and prove that she was not," said the
  little Spaniard.</p>

  <p>"You!" snapped John Winter.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" said Tony. "I at least am as respectable as you!"</p>

  <p>"All right." John Winter turned to the door.</p>

  <p>Then suddenly the fury he had pent up and suppressed burst its bounds and
  with an oath he leapt at the white-faced girl, and his hand was at her throat
  when he felt a curious pain under the left shoulder, a sharp, hot twinge of
  agony that made him cry out and switch round.</p>

  <p>"I gave you no more than a millimetre," said Tony quietly and John Winter
  dropped his eyes to the long, thin blade in the Spaniard's hand.</p>

  <p>"Only one millimetre! Imagine, my dear Winter, if I gave you seventy-five
  or eighty!"</p>

  <p>Winter did not speak. He pulled open the door and blundered out, and when
  the women looked at Tony again his hands were empty and the knife had
  mysteriously disappeared.</p>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">CHAPTER 16</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Here's the end of the road," said Jim Bartholomew.</p>

  <p>"Where?" The girl looked round startled. A thin haze hung upon the sea,
  but the Ceramia was making her maximum speed.</p>

  <p>"If you listen you will hear a hooter going in a minute. That's Fire
  Island and the United States."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a lot about the voyage for one who has never been
  there," she said.</p>

  <p>"I've never been to the United States," he confessed, "but I have been to
  Fire Island Light. I came once on a cruise after a fugitive submarine in the
  bad old days." The siren of the lightship was now audible. They were standing
  on the foredeck beneath the captain's cabin and they heard the clang and
  grind of the telegraph and soon after the thud of the propellers came at
  longer intervals.</p>

  <p>"We're slowing down," he said.</p>

  <p>"Listen."</p>

  <p>Margot took his arm in hers.</p>

  <p>"Dear, I want to&mdash;ask you something."</p>

  <p>He knew what was coming and was silent.</p>

  <p>"What is going to happen to Mrs Markham?" she asked, and he looked at her
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"What do you know about Mrs Markham?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Tell me what will happen to her."</p>

  <p>"Do you know who she is?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Cecile told me this morning," she said. "Mrs Markham is Cecile's
  sister&mdash;the one that was supposed to be dead, and she's married to that
  dreadful man whom she pretends is her butler."</p>

  <p>He looked thoughtfully over the side before he replied.</p>

  <p>"Does Frank know?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded the girl. "She told Frank everything the day she was
  supposed to leave for Scotland. Frank has been a brick throughout. What is
  going to happen to Mrs Markham?" she asked again.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Jim. "What poor Sanderson called the Big Four of Crime was
  never known under that title to the police either in England or in America.
  The people they have been after have been Talbot, Trenton, and
  Romano&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Romano? You don't mean our beautiful little cavalry officer?"</p>

  <p>"That is the gentleman," said Jim grimly "But the name of Mrs Trenton has
  never appeared in any of the warrants. She was looked upon by Scotland Yard
  as being more or less of a victim, and I discovered from the conversation I
  had with the detectives that that is the view which the American police are
  taking. To make doubly sure one of them put through a code inquiry to
  Washington yesterday morning and had a reply which is quite satisfactory from
  Mrs Trenton's point of view. The only danger of course," he said thoughtfully
  "is that Trenton, out of sheer malice, endeavours to drag Mrs&mdash;his wife
  down with him. The man is a fiend."</p>

  <p>Margot shivered.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it dreadful to think about? She ran away with him, when she was at
  school&mdash;poor woman, she has been punished for her folly."</p>

  <p>"I hope her punishment is ended," said Jim, and there was a great deal
  more in his speech than the girl could guess.</p>

  <p>Winter had gone back to his
  wife's cabin and was packing when the telegraph had rung the engines to
  half-speed.</p>

  <p>"Why are they slowing?" Stella asked listlessly.</p>

  <p>"Why the hell don't you go and ask the captain?" snarled the other.</p>

  <p>Mrs Markham shrugged.</p>

  <p>"Really, Winter, you grow more and more impossible. Throughout this voyage
  I have been trying to make things right for you and you've been trying to
  make them just as wrong as they can be."</p>

  <p>"When I want your advice I'll ask you for it," he said. "And when I want
  you to talk, why, I'll send you along a permit. At present you can close your
  mouth and sit tight. I've got something to settle with you&mdash;and
  Tony."</p>

  <p>He was busy strapping some bags and trunks. Mrs Markham sat with folded
  hands staring into vacancy.</p>

  <p>"Whatever side of the Atlantic we live," she said, "there's hell and a
  worse hell in between."</p>

  <p>"Will you shut up?" he snarled, and lifted a hand threateningly.</p>

  <p>"One of these days"&mdash;he glowered at her&mdash;"one of these days, my
  lady&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"One of these days I suppose I shall go the way of Talbot, and the way you
  tried to send Jim Bartholomew."</p>

  <p>He walked to the window of her sleeping cabin and looked out. The swaying
  mast of a little boat was disappearing aft and his face went a dirty
  white.</p>

  <p>"That's a police boat," he said thickly.</p>

  <p>She shrugged again and walked out of the room.</p>

  <p>"Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"On to the deck to look."</p>

  <p>"Come back," he shouted, and when she did not obey a suspicion of what was
  behind her action came to him and with a bellow of rage he ran after her.</p>

  <p>He flew down the alleyway out on to the deck looking round for her. He did
  not see his wife, but he saw something else which made his blood turn
  cold.</p>

  <p>Tony stood half a dozen paces from the saloon entrance and he was the
  centre of a group of three men, strangers who had evidently come aboard from
  the police boat, the mast of which showed above the rail, and though Tony was
  smiling and obviously conversational, the hand of one of the detectives which
  gripped the Spaniard's arm was self-explanatory. He turned in a flash to go
  back the way he had come, but a fourth stranger was standing in the narrow
  doorway and behind him was Jim Bartholomew.</p>

  <p>"You're wanted, Trenton," said the man. "And if you're sensible, you are
  not going to give me any trouble. Put out your hands."</p>

  <p>The game was up. Escape was impossible, and Trenton, his flabby face grey
  and old, held out his hands and the handcuffs were snapped on. The stranger
  gripped him by the arm and led him across to the group of which Tony Romano
  was the centre, and in that short space of time, Mr Winter, or John Winter
  Trenton, made up his mind.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, chief," he said, recognising one of Tony's captors.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Trenton," he said coolly. "The other man is dead, you say?"
  He spoke to the Scotland Yard detective at his side, but Romano answered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, quite dead," he said cheerfully. "In fact, that I can certify
  because I killed him. Now my dear Winter"&mdash;he smiled upon his
  companion&mdash;"let us proceed."</p>

  <p>"Wait a moment," said Trenton hoarsely. "You want three of us, don't
  you?"</p>

  <p>"Two alive and one dead," said the police officer.</p>

  <p>"Well, you're going to take three alive."</p>

  <p>They had not put the irons upon Tony Romano and he was standing in his
  usual attitude of ease, a half smile on his thin, swarthy face.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he interrupted, "you have heard the chief tell you that he
  requires three, two alive and one dead. Would you desire anything more than
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Yes I would," snarled Trenton.</p>

  <p>"You are contemptible," said Tony, "but you shall have it different since
  you wish."</p>

  <p>He spoke so calmly and gave so little warning of his intentions that even
  the officer who held him was taken off his guard. He seemed to contract the
  muscles of the arm which was in his captors grip and to leap forward at the
  same time, and those who watched thought he did no more than clumsily embrace
  his companion in misfortune, for he threw his arms around him.</p>

  <p>"That will do!" said the chief sharply. "Take that man, Riley." Then he
  saw Trenton's face, the chin resting on the Spaniard's shoulder, and in that
  face was a grimace of terror.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that will do, I think," said Romano, and as he disengaged himself
  from the other. Trenton crumpled in a heap to the ground.</p>

  <p>"And that, gentlemen, is the knife," said the Spaniard pleasantly,
  dropping the long steel weapon to the deck.</p>

  <p>Whilst they handcuffed him he was
  very talkative.</p>

  <p>"You need not bother about Trenton," he said. They were leaning over the
  prostrate man trying to staunch the wound in his back. "He is quite dead, I
  assure you. In that same way did my friend Talbot die. It is better so. I do
  not like the idea of sharing a trial with such a man."</p>

  <p>They hurried him below to F Deck, where they made a quick but thorough
  search.</p>

  <p>"I think you will find most of the jewels these people are bringing back
  in friend Romano's baggy breeches," said Jim quietly. Romano smiled.</p>

  <p>"Otherwise, why the baggy breeches?" he said coolly. "It is perfectly
  true, chief, and these garments," he patted his pantaloons proudly with his
  cuffed hand, "these garments are worth three million dollars."</p>

  <p>From an open port on F Deck a gangway led to the police boat. As they
  were taking him away Romano turned to Jim.</p>

  <p>"My respectful salutations to all who have been kind to me," he said. He
  looked the other straight in the eye and Jim knew that the message was for
  Stella Markham.</p>

  <p>"Will you also apologise to Miss Cameron? I went to her room to gain peace
  of mind. There was something there that I hoped to find. I was
  successful&mdash;it is there still."</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <h2 style="page-break-before:always"><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">CHAPTER 17</a></h2>

  <p class="first">So they took away Tony Romano and carried with them also the
  bodies of the two men, and the passengers of the Ceramia heard for the first
  time of the tragedy which had occurred without their knowledge. Then Jim
  sought the woman. She was not alone. Cecile was with her, her arms about
  her.</p>

  <p>"Do they want me?" asked Stella Markham dully. Jim shook his head. He
  hesitated to tell of the Spaniard's deed by which he had forfeited what
  little chance he had had of escaping the Chair.</p>

  <p>"I haven't had to explain your presence on the ship, Mrs Trenton," he
  said. "The only man who can betray you is dead."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Tony...Tony did that for me?"</p>

  <p>It was not until that evening when they were gathered in Cecile's
  sitting-room at the hotel that she told her story.</p>

  <p>"I ran away from school with my&mdash;husband. He was much older than I,
  and I suppose that I was fascinated&mdash;I was certainly a fool. He was not
  of the same social grade as my own people, but his lack of breeding might
  have been excused and he might, with his intelligence, have climbed very high
  indeed. But John Winter Trenton was always a crook, a crook in heart and a
  crook in mind. It was a long time before I learnt the truth, and when I did I
  suppose I wasn't as horrified as I should have been. At any rate, he could
  put things so attractively&mdash;I'm excusing myself," she said, with a
  shrug. "I went with him. I took a passive part in some of his most nefarious
  swindles and he got away with it for a long time. Then a clever woman
  detective got after."</p>

  <p>Jim smiled.</p>

  <p>"Why do you smile?"</p>

  <p>"Curiously enough," he said. "I thought you were that woman detective when
  I began to get a glimmering of this story."</p>

  <p>Stella shook her head again.</p>

  <p>"No, she has never left America. She had us arrested, Winter and I, and it
  was while we were waiting trial that I let my sister know what had become of
  me. For years Winter had been working a small game and then he got into a
  better set, mainly through the help of Talbot, and we came to Europe and they
  started the series of robberies which you know about. It was Winter who
  planned it all, Tony and Talbot who carried the plan into execution. I had
  nothing to do but pose as a grand lady. We rented expensive furnished houses,
  sometimes in the north of England, sometimes in the south, and from there the
  gang spread their nets. Winter, of course, posed as my butler." She smiled
  faintly. "There is a certain amount of humour in that. It was I who was that
  man's slave. He's dead," she cried passionately. "I'm glad he's dead! If I
  could thrust him down into hell with these hands..." She stood trembling in
  her passion, and then of a sudden broke into a fit of weeping.</p>

  <p>"I think we know all there is to be known, Mrs Cameron," said Jim. "Does
  your husband know?"</p>

  <p>"I told him," said Cecile. Jim went out of the room, taking Margot with
  him. They were walking to the elevator when the girl asked: "Why did you
  search her stateroom, Jim? Of course, you were the mysterious sailor whom she
  saw disappearing through the window? Did you expect to find anything?"</p>

  <p>"I expected to find two things," he said. "I found one&mdash;the second
  ring, the Daughters of the Night. You remember Cecile telling us that her
  father had given both his girls a similar ring? That I found on my second
  visit. The other thing I sought I have never found and my failure is the
  bitterest disappointment to me. Do you know we have not recovered the jewels
  which were deposited by Mrs Markham and which probably today are her only
  assets, even though they were stolen! Incidentally we are responsible at the
  bank to the extent of &pound;112,000. Here is the ring."</p>

  <p>He took it from his waistcoat pocket and showed it her. It was a replica
  of the ring which Mrs Cameron had worn, and the girl took it in her hands and
  admired it.</p>

  <p>"It was the photograph of Mrs Markham wearing this ring, which poor
  Sanderson had. He must have caught a glimpse of her, and, utterly deceived by
  Winter's pleasant appearance, he invited Winter down the night Mrs Markham
  left Moorford, intending to employ, as he thought, an honest servant to
  pursue inquiries. I think he suspected Stella from what he had seen of her
  and her resemblance to the photograph, and he had arranged to interview
  Winter in order to get him to identify the police photograph of Mrs Trenton
  with the man's employer. I think that theory is as near correct as possible.
  It is impossible to get the correct one. Both the parties to that meeting are
  now dead."</p>

  <p>"What happened then?"</p>

  <p>"Winter came to the bank that night. Mrs Markham may have been in the
  car&mdash;as to that I have no information. He was probably horrified to see
  the photograph, for if Stella was identified so was he. In desperation he
  must have threatened Sanderson, who produced my revolver. There was a
  struggle, that is clear from an overturned chair. Winter, who was a powerful
  man, must have secured possession of the revolver, shot Sanderson and torn
  the photograph from his hand, making his escape down the passage when I came
  through the door of my office."</p>

  <p>"But the jewels? What happened then?"</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what happened then," said Jim. "As I stood looking down at
  Sanderson I had an instinctive feeling that Mrs Markham was in some way mixed
  up in this case. I took my keys and opened the safe expecting to find Mrs
  Markham's packet gone. Sanderson had told me in the morning that Winter had
  been down to the bank looking at the package and sticking a label on it, and
  he also told me that Winter had drawn his attention to a man outside the
  window of the office whom he said his mistress did not like. I found the
  package and brought it to the table and, without any excuse from the strict
  point of view of a banker and a custodian, I broke the seals and opened the
  package, only to find, as I expected, the glass box was empty."</p>

  <p>"What had happened?" asked the girl.</p>

  <p>"Winter had performed the very simple trick of 'ringing the changes'. He
  had brought with him to the bank that morning a package similarly sealed, and
  whilst he had drawn Sanderson's attention away by directing his eyes to
  somebody outside the window, he substituted the empty package for the other.
  As soon as I discovered the glass box was empty I knew that Winter was in it
  and just how Sanderson had been tricked. Mrs Markham I thought had already
  left. Probably Winter was on his way to Southampton with her. I had to think
  quickly. I took &pound;200 out of my private drawer, raced home, took my bag which
  was already packed for my visit to London&mdash;I intended spending Sunday
  night in London&mdash;and caught the last train to Exeter. The rest of the
  story you know."</p>

  <p>"What did you expect to find on board the ship?"</p>

  <p>He laughed. "I expected
  to find the murderer. I was certain of finding you," he said.</p>

  <p>"And this man speaks of the two things both in the same breath," said the
  girl wonderingly, "and he expects me to go on loving him and cherishing
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know you will," said Jim, "because I tell you honestly the only thing
  that has spurred me on, the only thing that has kept my mind clear and my
  heart cheerful, has been the knowledge that you were near me."</p>

  <p>She looked at him, a keen, scrutinising glance. Three times the elevator
  door had opened, but the sorrowful "Going down!" of the attendant had been
  unheeded.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I mean it," he said indignantly.</p>

  <p>"That's rather wonderful," she said softly, and then, "but you haven't
  told me what you didn't find. What has become of the necklace?"</p>

  <p>He spread out his hands in despair.</p>

  <p>"Tony's baggy riding breeches yielded enough stuff to keep a respectable
  jeweller going for ten years," he said, "but amongst those relics there was
  nothing that bore the remotest resemblance to Mrs Markham's dog collar, and
  that," he said soberly, "adds rather a gloom to the proceedings. Now I
  wonder&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Poor Mrs Markham! Poor Cecile! What will be the end of that?"</p>

  <p>"The Lord knows!" he said.</p>

  <p>"By the way, I wonder who her friend is in New York, the girl to whom I
  was to give the candies?"</p>

  <p>"What friend in New York?" asked Jim, with sudden interest.</p>

  <p>"Oh, some girl who will call for a box of-"</p>

  <p>Jim gripped her with a yell.</p>

  <p>"Where's that box?" he said, and her mouth opened wide.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Let me look at it." They flew down the corridor together and, defiant of
  all proprieties, Jim followed the girl into her room. She unlocked and opened
  her trunk and with trembling fingers tore the wrappings from the candy
  box.</p>

  <p>Jim knocked the lid off and their faces fell.</p>

  <p>"It is candy," said Jim, "unless&mdash;" He poked his finger down, then
  suddenly swept the chocolates aside and drew forth something which glittered
  even through the silver tissue in which it had been wrapped.</p>

  <p>"Darling," he said, "this settles our future."</p>

  <p>"Our future was settled when you were rescued from a watery grave."</p>

  <p>Suddenly he whistled.</p>

  <p>"Tony went to your stateroom?"</p>

  <p>"The Italian&mdash;yes?" she said in surprise. "I accused
  him&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>"He went to make sure that the box was there. The diamonds are Stella
  Markham's own property and he was worried about their disposal. He must have
  suspected that Stella had put them in your keeping, and searched your cabin
  'for his peace of mind'&mdash;those were his words. He loved her."</p>

  <p>"Loved her?" repeated Margot incredulously.</p>

  <p>"He loved her and rescued her as assuredly as you rescued me, when you
  dived in your petticoat&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a stern eye.</p>

  <p>"You were supposed to be unconscious, Mr Jim Bartholomew."</p>

  <p>"And do you wonder?" demanded Jim.</p>
