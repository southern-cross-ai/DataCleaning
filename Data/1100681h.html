  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="I"></a>Chapter I</b></h2>
  <p>Along  a twisting country lane, warm and dusty, and richly colored by the dying  radiance of a July sunset, jangled a battered caravan, as brown and worn as the  ancient horse which lugged it reluctantly onward. From innumerable hooks on  back, front, and sides dangled tin cans, iron kettles, bristling brooms,  bundles of brushes, and such-like domestic necessaries, together with goat-skin  rugs, woollen mats, reach-me-down suits, carpet clippers, and many pairs of  stout boots. The whole crazy vehicle, with its hawkers&rsquo; stock-in-trade, creaked  and groaned and labored complainingly, as if on the verge of disintegration.</p>
  <p>Not  so the driver&mdash;presumably the owner. He sat rigidly upright, holding the reins  alert for adventure; slim and straight, and spare as a poplar; filled to the  brim with the fiery wine of youth. Handsome, too, a woman would have declared  at the sight of that clean-shaven face, bronzed, smooth-skinned, oval, with  clear-cut features, and closely-clipped dark hair. The young man&rsquo;s firm mouth,  watchful grey eyes, strong jaw, and square chin revealed him as an inborn  master of his fellows. He should have been commanding men in war, controlling  some big business in peace; somehow governing, somehow dictating.</p>
  <p>Yet  here he was in a dingy grey riding suit and a shabby cap, with disreputable  gaiters and heavy boots, driving an equally disreputable caravan for the  traffic of gipsy merchandise. His being in such a galley would certainly have  startled M. Jourdain, that innocent gentleman, who was only surprised when he  found virtue in unexpected places. A country policeman, who was strolling along  the lane, knew nothing of Moliere&rsquo;s hero, but he felt much the same when the  dreary old caravan rumbled round the corner. The enigmatic driver was the very  last person he expected to meet in his back-water of Life&rsquo;s tumultuous river.</p>
  <p>On  the instant Constable Selwin&rsquo;s right hand went to his helmet, as his broad,  round face expressed excessive and very natural surprise. &ldquo;Mr. Lawson!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Selwin!&rdquo;  Lawson spoke in an easy, imperious tone, friendly, but with more than a hint of  mastership. &ldquo;We parted at Capetown five years ago to meet in this Rip Van  Winkle country. What the dickens are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarley  village policeman, sir; married, with a family of two; got into the force six  months after reaching Albert Docks. And you, sir?&rdquo; Selwin ran an observing eye  over the driver&rsquo;s dress and the driver&rsquo;s caravan. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you doing this for a  sort o&rsquo; bet, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  a living, Selwin. After another hunting trip&mdash;sorry you weren&rsquo;t with me that  time&mdash;I took the trail to South America, and had a ton-hole time in the wilds.  Came home last year to find father dead, leaving me nothing but his blessing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  colonel dead, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Two  years dead. Lost all his money in some speculation, and I had to earn a living  somehow. I saved a gipsy&rsquo;s old mother from drowning, and when he died nine  months ago he left me this caravan and the horse. As I couldn&rsquo;t stick an  office, I took to trading round the country.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  a gentleman like you, Mr. Lawson&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that&rsquo;s all right, Selwin. I&rsquo;m having a topping time, although I don&rsquo;t meet with  such adventures as we did when we were on that hunting trip in Africa. So there  you are. I want to camp hereabouts tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarley  Wood&rsquo;s the place,&rdquo; volunteered the policeman, promptly pointing a guiding thumb  over his left shoulder. &ldquo;Quarter of a mile on, Sir; glade in the heart of it,  sir, with water for the horse. And no one will say anything if I don&rsquo;t&mdash;which,&rdquo;  added Selwin, viciously, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t my style with a gentleman who saved me from  being eaten by a lion like Daniel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  wasn&rsquo;t eaten,&rdquo; answered Lawson, with a laugh. &ldquo;Look me up tonight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir!&rdquo; Selwin saluted again. &ldquo;Anything I can do, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  fished out a shilling from his pocket. &ldquo;Tobacco!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Navy  cut, sir.&rdquo; The policeman fielded the coin dexterously. &ldquo;I know the sort, sir,  none better, after two years of hunting and shooting along o&rsquo; you, sir,&rdquo; and he  stood looking after the caravan with an admiring air&mdash;for the driver&mdash;not for the  vehicle&mdash;which excited his disgust.</p>
  <p>Dick&mdash;that  was the diminutive of Lawson&rsquo;s baptismal name to his few and tried friends&mdash;easily  found the wood, and less easily the glade in the heart of the wood. Here, near  a pond of clear water and under the whispering foliage of a spreading beech, he  halted his disreputable caravan to prepare camp as in old African days. But there  was no ready-handed Selwin to assist him now, as then, and he regretted the  lost comradeship. However, with the methodical thoroughness of long experience  he unharnessed the ancient steed, haltered him, and selected a grazing ground.  Nigh to this was a narrow tangled path&mdash;leading to nowhere so far as he knew&mdash;and  he roped the animal to a birch tree at its entrance. Afterwards he lighted a  fire, filled his kettle from the bubbling spring which fed the pond, and made  ready the frying pan for eggs and bacon.</p>
  <p>By  the time he had arranged his tin dinner service, with knife, fork, and spoon,  on a coarse white cloth spread over a convenient stump, the water was boiling  and the contents of the pan spluttering. So Dick brewed hot and strong tea to  enjoy a truly excellent supper, which was very acceptable after his long drive  from Tarhaven to this hamlet in the wilderness. Not that he had seen Sarley  Village, or wished to see it for the moment, but he knew that it was within  exploring distance. Meanwhile he was very well satisfied with his solitude, and  reclined lazily by the fire, smoking thoughtfully and considering a somewhat  problematic future. The outlook was not encouraging, for he seemed to be at the  bottom of the abyss. Regularly the distant Sarley church clock chimed the hours  and the quarters; but so deep in thought was the young fellow that he was  amazed when 10 booms of the bell wakened him to the swift passing of time.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten  o&rsquo;clock, b&rsquo; Jove!&rdquo; he said, speaking aloud after the fashion of the solitary,  and rose to stretch himself with a comfortable yawn. &ldquo;Time for bye-bye. Shall I  sleep in the open, or under cover?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>A  light hand swept along the grass told him that dew was beading every blade so  Lawson sauntered into the caravan with an electric torch for his night-lamp. On  the bed he found an envelope, which must have fallen unawares from his pocket.  As it contained a possible answer to his cogitations regarding his future he  took out the letter to refresh his memory. The epistle directed him to seek out  Lady Hamber of Sarley Court, with a view to employment as a bailiff on her  estate. Attached was a visiting card inscribed with the name &lsquo;Oliver Bollerd,&rsquo;  and a few pencilled words recommending the bearer. Nodding his head in  approval, and wondering if the introduction would lead to anything, Dick  restored letter and card to the envelope, that to his inner pocket, and yawned  again as he proceeded to take off his Norfolk jacket. Before his arms were out  of the sleeves he paused and listened, on the alert immediately, like a  startled stag. In the stillness there came a cry to his ear&mdash;the cry of a woman  in pain, such as he had heard several times in Africa. The note of suffering,  strange in so solitary a neighborhood, sent him shuffling back into his jacket  and headlong down the caravan steps. As he leapt towards the dying fire he  heard a low moan in the dark distance, and flung on a bundle of brushwood to  excite a blaze. But the sufferer was beyond the bound of the luminous circle,  and only when Lawson heard her moan again did he discover her whereabouts. A  few strides brought him to the entrance to the path near which the horse was  tethered, and he swore inwardly at his neglect to bring the torch, which would  have given him sufficient light for necessary examination of sex and condition.  But it was a woman, sure enough, as he soon became certain when she explained  her outcry. &ldquo;I stumbled over the horse&rsquo;s rope, and have sprained my ankle,&rdquo; she  murmured in a low and very musical voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry,  Madam,&rdquo; Lawson went down on his knees. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t expect anyone to come down the  path, or I should have tied up my horse elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are a gentleman!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  sorts, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  but you are. I can tell by your voice. Help me; my foot&mdash;&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  permission, madam.&rdquo; Dick picked her up gently and carried her toward the fire,  now blazing briskly. Yet even as he did so she feebly resisted his masterful  action.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! No!&rdquo; She spoke faintly but insistently. &ldquo;Put me down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense.  I can&rsquo;t leave you in the darkness with a sprained ankle!&rdquo; He placed her beside  the fire and ran back to the caravan. On the way he marvelled, as did  Christabel when she met the Darke Ladye in the magic wood. This lady was not  dark, but the fairest of the fair, as he knew from the glimpse he had caught of  feathery golden hair; but she was just as lovely and just as richly dressed.  What an adventure! Here was a straying damsel, arrayed in a fashionable dinner  gown, and wrapped in a gold-embroidered cloak, coming from nowhere into his  life. Dick, wondering profoundly at the beneficence of destiny, strode back to  his angel, entertained unexpectedly, if not unawares, with an eiderdown quilt,  a pillow, a bottle of embrocation, and a few hastily-contrived bandages. The  girl, having drawn her glittering cloak closely up to her neck and over her  face, so that only a pair of angry eyes were visible, greeted her good  Samaritan in a few muffled words the reverse of sweet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she snapped, and her voice was as angry as were her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear young lady, you don&rsquo;t know what is good for you,&rdquo; said Lawson, coolly  placing the pillow under her head and the quilt over her body.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you are a gentleman you will let me go,&rdquo; she flashed out indignantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  by all means.&rdquo; He rose from his knees and stepped back with a bow.</p>
  <p>She  made a valiant effort to rise, and failed. &ldquo;You see I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said crossly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have seen that ever since I picked you up over yonder,&rdquo; the young man assured  her dryly, and thinking how excessively feminine she was, and how charming were  her contradictions. &ldquo;Let me have a look at the ankle.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  She tucked her slender feet in the smartest of evening shoes under the hem of  her gown. &ldquo;Go away. Oh!&rdquo; Out came the right foot, for, very naturally, the  change of position enhanced the pain.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be silly,&rdquo; said her comforter, roughly. &ldquo;I must rub your foot with this  embrocation and bandage it somehow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you a doctor?&rdquo; she asked mistrustfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  I be rambling round the country in a caravan if I were a doctor&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know&mdash;that is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t know anything, not even how impossible you are as an invalid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  she frowned, and winced&mdash;&rdquo;how very rude.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  how very true. Come now, I won&rsquo;t beat you. Pull off your shoe and stocking.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Daunted  by his imperious manner, and feeling with feminine intuition that he was to be  thoroughly trusted, she obeyed. Tenderly the man rubbed the delicate ankle with  the strong biting mixture, bandaged it carefully, and stood up to let her put  on her shoe; the stocking, of course, being impossible. Then he discovered that  she had fainted with the pain and that the cloak had fallen away from her face.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="II"></a>Chapter II</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  b&rsquo; jove!&rdquo; commented the young man, stirred to the core of his appreciative soul  by the sight of the exquisite face, delicately perfect, &ldquo;this is the beauty of  the world.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  praise was superlative, but none the less honest and well deserved. But Dick,  very much a gentleman, did not take such pardonable advantage of the situation.  After gazing for one glorious moment he hastened to fill a cup at the spring,  and was shortly restoring consciousness to this stray Helen. Two splendid blue  eyes&mdash;Dick guessed from the halo of golden hair that they would be blue&mdash;opened  slowly with a bewildered expression, which changed suddenly to one of mingled  fear and defiance. The girl sat up, drew her rich cloak again around her&mdash;but  this time not over her face&mdash;and shivered at the thought of the isolation.  Lawson ascribed this attack of nerves to a matter-of-fact cause. &ldquo;Foot hurting?&rdquo;  he asked anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  my ankle,&rdquo; she retorted, ungraciously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;  He was quite imperturbable. &ldquo;Ankle hurting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was so smoothly said, yet with such a twinkle in the eyes, that the prostrate  lady permitted herself to relieve a smile. Then she frowned; the more so as she  became convinced of his good will. &ldquo;You might do something more useful than  stand there laughing at me,&rdquo; was her unexpected remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I might,&rdquo; agreed Dick cheerfully: and stooping. &ldquo;If you will let me carry you  into my caravan and put you on an apology for a bed I think you would be more  comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not. I know nothing about you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ditto,  ditto, so far as you are concerned,&rdquo; he retorted lightly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not going to answer any questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t asked any.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you will. And I have a brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh.  Does he ask questions?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But I have a&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  I regret to say that I can&rsquo;t see the connection between&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>This  time she interrupted, and petulantly. &ldquo;Men are so stupid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Granted&mdash;and  women are so clever. Come now, that is nicely said, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  girl smiled again and frowned again. &ldquo;What is the use of talking cleverly? You  ought to help me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  idea. You have only to ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want to go to Sarley Grange, two miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarley  Court,&rdquo; said man, the supremely stupid, remembering the letter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  Sarley Grange. Don&rsquo;t you understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not-er-exactly,&rdquo;  confessed Lawson, sadly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dense you are. I want to go to Sarley Grange, two miles away. I was walking  there when I stumbled over your silly rope.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  surveyed her charming evening frock, which the now open cloak revealed more  fully. &ldquo;Is that you usual costume for walking?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not. I came away in a hurry and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes. That&rsquo;s all right. I am not asking questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  won&rsquo;t be answered if you do ask them!&rdquo; she cried, crossly; then with delightful  inconsistency proceeded to demand information. &ldquo;What about yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  chuckled at this very feminine turning of the tables. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what  about myself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  hawker of pots, kettles, pans, brushes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nonsense;  you are a gentleman&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fallen  on evil days, if I may venture to complete your sentence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you be serious?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Occasionally,  when life is at its best.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  now?&rdquo; she put the question in quite a sympathetic tone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is at its worst. I have a caravan, a horse, another suit of clothes, and a  trifle of money. Such is my dismal lot.&rdquo; He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Also  good looks, youth, strength, hope, brains, and the wide world before you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  assign to me the gifts of the good,&rdquo; said Lawson, imperturbably, and wondering  at her motherly tone of kindly rebuke.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think the gods are very good to you,&rdquo; said the girl, seriously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are&mdash;in sending you here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is not my opinion,&rdquo; she replied, dryly. &ldquo;I wish I were elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarley  Grange, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely.  But how am I to get there with my sprained ankle?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;B&rsquo;  Jove, madame&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not madam,&rdquo; she interrupted with a snap.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sorry,  mademoiselle. What I was about to say is that you have heaps of pluck.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you!&rdquo; She blushed and looked more attractive than ever. &ldquo;I need it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;B&rsquo;  Jove, you do, sitting there talking so delightfully when you are in pain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  blushed again and her eyes shone. Really this was a very charming young  gentleman, who knew how to turn a compliment, and evidently, acknowledged the  undoubted superiority of women. &ldquo;But,&rdquo;&mdash;she followed up her thoughts in sober  speech, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that compliments help me much in my present plight.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are as oil to grease the wheels of Life&rsquo;s chariot,&rdquo; said Dick, sententiously. &ldquo;But  to take a more practical view&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Which  is what I have been asking you to do for the last thirty minutes,&rdquo; she  interpolated with a grimace, for her ankle hurt considerably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can drive you to Sarley Grange in my caravan,&rdquo; went on Lawson, as if she had  made no remark.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Splendid!&rdquo;  The errant damsel clapped her hands. &ldquo;And you will leave me at the lodge  without requesting explanations?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  my honor!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you are&mdash;er&mdash;nice,&rdquo; sighed his patient. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t suppose we shall ever meet  again. Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lawson.  Richard Maxwell George Henry Lawson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  a Royal string of names,&rdquo; she commented, but did not offer information in  return. &ldquo;But as we won&rsquo;t meet again, Mr. Lawson, I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  won&rsquo;t we&mdash;or, why can&rsquo;t we&mdash;meet again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  because&mdash;because&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  reasons. Go on.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  She became angry, and looked as tempting as a peach. &ldquo;You are asking me  questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  asked me questions,&rdquo; he countered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  a woman&rsquo;s privilege. And my ankle is hurting me while you stand there making  fun of my sufferings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, no.&rdquo; Dick was shocked, and came towards her. &ldquo;I shall catch my horse at  once, but you must let me take you into my caravan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  horse is only a stone&rsquo;s throw away,&rdquo; said the lady, sharply; &ldquo;you can put me in  the caravan when you put the horse between the shafts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right  ho!&rdquo; Seeing that there was no arguing with her, Dick walked towards the path  where he had chanced upon her so unexpectedly. Then he uttered an exclamation  of astonishment and dismay. The horse had vanished, only the rope and the  halter remaining.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the matter?&rdquo; called out the girl.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  horse has escaped&mdash;wandered&mdash;disappeared. Choose your word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;  there was a distinct note of anxiety in her voice, &ldquo;it must have slipped its  halter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Looks  like it.&rdquo; Lawson untied the rope from the birch tree and advanced towards the  fire. &ldquo;What about a horse thief? Anyone with you?&rdquo; he shot a keen glance at her  which she resented promptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not,&rdquo; was her wrathful reply. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t go about with people who steal horses. How  silly you are! Go away and catch the horse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sound  advice, mademoiselle. But it will take time to hunt through this fairy wood&mdash;near  Athens, you know. And you&mdash;&rdquo; he lifted her up, quilt and all, in his strong arms  with a promptitude which aroused resentment but not alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?  Why? Why?&rdquo; she babbled, feeling that she could trust him wholly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  may be&mdash;er&mdash;tramps about,&rdquo; explained Dick, hoping that Selwin would not stumble  too suddenly on his romance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well,&rdquo; she sighed, and allowed him to carry her into the caravan, wrapped in  the quilt and grasping the pillow. &ldquo;Do hurry,&rdquo; she implored, when he laid her  gently on the bed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  put a girdle round the earth in forty minutes,&rdquo; answered Lawson in a gay tone. &ldquo;Take  the torch and don&rsquo;t be frightened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  was puzzled by the escape of the ancient steed. In his remarkably logical mind  he was tolerably assured that the halter had been deliberately removed so that  the animal might stray. But for what reason, and by whom? Severely as he  questioned himself, while groping here and there in this cimmerian wood, he  could find no plausible answer to these suggestions. And all the time he  wandered, further and further away from the glade, from the caravan, and its  precious occupant. The gloom was not altogether cimmerian, he found, when his  eyes grew accustomed to the dimness, for there was a faint, luminous light  lingering amongst the trees, and he managed to scramble along without any  marked mishap. The distant clock, struck three-quarters. &ldquo;Nearly eleven,&rdquo; muttered  Dick, treading cautiously through leagues&mdash;as it seemed&mdash;of unknown geography. &ldquo;Damn  the horse!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>At  that very moment he heard crackling sounds as the beast pushed its way through  the close undergrowth and sprang in the direction of the movement. As he did so  there came to his ear, faint but distinct, the unmistakable noise indicating  the discharge of a revolver. Lawson half-unconsciously promptly wheeled round  to fight his way back to the glade. All on fire for rescue of the girl from  some unknown danger, he plunged onward blindly like a bull, and brought his  head violently into contact with a tree trunk. For the next fifteen minutes or  so he took no further interest in life as he knew it.</p>
  <p>Recovering  his senses with a dull aching in his head, he ploughed through the underwood  more cautiously towards the glade&mdash;reached it somehow, some time, and noted  vaguely that the fire had died down to a smouldering glow. Up the caravan steps  he went, flung open the caravan door, and plunged in. There was no answer to  his call, and he dropped on his knees to explore, his hand coming into touch  with the torch immediately. Clicking on the light he saw a woman lying on the  bed, as he expected; but the torch light revealed another face. Dick gasped.  The girl had disappeared. In her place was an elderly woman&mdash;a complete  stranger. And she was dead&mdash;shot straight through the heart.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="III"></a>Chapter III</b></h2>
  <p>HERE  was a pretty kettle of fish, truly. Sitting well back on his heels and flashing  the torch every now and then over the expressionless mask of death, Dick  considered hesitatingly the strange events of the evening.</p>
  <p>They  offered unanswerable riddles. The girl who had come so unexpectedly into the  glade, and vanished just as unexpectedly, leaving in her place a woman almost  thrice her age. Worse still, and still more extraordinary, this woman was dead,  and not for long, since the body was yet warm. She also was arrayed in a costly  opera cloak. There was blood on her breast, and it required only a brief  examination for Dick to determine that she had been shot through the heart. But  for what reason, and by whom?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound!&rdquo;  ejaculated Lawson, for the third time that evening, and wondered how he was to  extricate himself from the morass into which the worst-tempered of the Three  Fates had cast him.</p>
  <p>That  he was in danger of being arrested he knew very plainly.</p>
  <p>Then  the instinctive desire of man born of woman to make himself as safe as he well  could, asserted itself strongly and stirred him to immediate action. Selwin  might arrive with the tobacco at any moment, and it was necessary to shift the  body before his official eye could behold it in its present resting place.  Wisdom suggested a prompt removal of this damning evidence to some less  suggestive locality. With his liberty and life in jeopardy the man&rsquo;s brain  worked with exceeding swiftness: and almost in the moment when the details of  the scheme were conceived he found himself carrying the sinister burden down  the caravan steps. And, as he bore it across the glade, past the dying fire,  past the pond, he thought of the best hiding place. But immediately that  thought was displaced by another. He would not hide the body, for if discovered  hidden, as it would most certainly be sooner or later with Sarley village so  near, the fact of concealment would tell against him. It would be best to lay  down his burden somewhere in the wood, so that it might appear that the woman  had fallen naturally under the fire of some unknown assailant.</p>
  <p>But  where? The reply came so rapidly that it was evident his good angel was bestirring  on his behalf. The girl had come down the path by the birch tree, so it was  possible, even probable, that the elder woman&mdash;say her mother&mdash;had followed on to  guard, or watch. Lawson, mindful of the precious moments flying swiftly, lost  no time in nutting his thought into action, and, carrying his uncanny load for  some distance up the narrow winding path laid it down gently in a curve of the  same. Luckily he had been careful to wrap the opera cloak securely round the  body while conveying it to the path, so there was no blood on his grey clothes  to incriminate him. Having thus arranged matters he felt assured that, so far  as he and the caravan were concerned, no physical evidence was available to  connect him with the crime in any way whatsoever.</p>
  <p>Before  leaving the sinister spot, Dick waved the torch over the still, white face. It  was a remarkably handsome countenance, strong in outline, with an aqueline  nose, and a determined chin. As the informing life had escaped from the shell,  there was no positive expression to reveal character; but Lawson judged from  the decisive contours of nose and lips and chin, from the width, and height of  the forehead, that the dead woman had been an imperiously dominant human being.  He noted that her shoes were thin and ill-adapted to wandering in these rough  woodland ways; also that she wore much jewellery on neck and wrists and  fingers. Even under the black lace veil, draping her plentiful white hair,  twinkled a diamond star, so it was evident that she had been a woman of wealth  and good standing. Finally the presence of the gems declared positively that  robbery was not the motive for the execution of what seemed to be a purposeless  crime.</p>
  <p>Naturally  enough, Lawson would have preferred to make a more thorough examination in the  hope of finding some clue to her name; but there was no time to search  exhaustively. He examined himself all over in the gleam of the torch, when he  turned away, so as to make sure that all incriminating marks were absent. Also,  he made certain that the ground was sufficiently hard and dry to avert the  registration of betraying footmarks. The fates proved propitious, and all was  safe, so he hastened back to the glade with a sigh of relief that the most  gruesome part of his task was over. Stroking his chin meditatively by the fire,  he considered his next move with much care and deliberation.</p>
  <p>This  was plainly to go forth and meet Selwin. He slipped on breeches and boots, and  started towards the distant roadway along which he had driven, if would seem,  centuries ago. On the way he made up an ingenious tale, likely to account for  all discoveries, without bringing him too prominently into the matter. As he  made his way out of the glade the church clock told him it was half-past 11.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Too  early,&rdquo; murmured the schemer, guided through the wood by stray moonbeams, thin,  cold, and silver clear. &ldquo;I shall have to lengthen that time of insensibility  when I banged against the tree-trunk. Otherwise Selwin will wonder why I did  not give the alarm before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  village constable was late on his rounds, and Lawson struck the high road  before he met him. The tramp, tramp, tramp of stout boots gave notice of the  man&rsquo;s approach, and at once Dick began to run with such blindfold speed that he  cannoned off Selwin into the near hedge.</p>
  <p>The  policeman whipped out his torch at once, and uttered an exclamation of surprise  when he saw the face of the panting fugitive.</p>
  <p>Recovering  himself, the young man staggered towards the officer, at his last gasp, it  would seem. &ldquo;Selwin!&rdquo; he grasped an arm, and shot out his words brokenly,  breathlessly&mdash;&ldquo;ran&mdash;all&mdash;the&mdash;way. Shot&mdash;heard&mdash;shot&mdash;Long&mdash;ago. Shot&mdash;shot!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poachers?&rdquo;  queried the constable, on the alert immediately, and steadying him.</p>
  <p>The  other wiped the perspiration off his face with the back of his hand, and sat  down on the roadside, presumably to recover much-wanted breath, &ldquo;Might be,&rdquo; he  nodded. &ldquo;Anyhow&mdash;shot. I heard one. Would poachers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  they&rsquo;re all over the place, sir. Give me no end of trouble. When?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  quarter to 11.&rdquo; Dick rose, now quite himself, as he was tired of acting the  part of a blown runaway. &ldquo;I went to bed early&rdquo;&mdash;he hated to tell lies, but it  was necessary to do so in the interests of the girl, although, for all he knew,  she might be inculpated in the crime&mdash;&rdquo;and found the caravan too hot. So I  shoved on my boots and breeches, and took the bedding to the fire. Went to  sleep for a time, and woke to find that my horse had slipped his halter; his  movement roused me, I guess. In the wood, while looking for him, I heard the  shot&mdash;quarter to 11, for I heard the clock strike.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  were you at the moment, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the heart of the wood, searching for that infernal horse. When I heard the shot  I turned back to see what was doing. In the darkness I came against a tree and  went west for the time being.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long?&rdquo; Selwin flashed his torch, and nodded when he saw the bruise on Lawson&rsquo;s  forehead, continuing the tale.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  you have me.&rdquo; Dick held his aching head with both hands. &ldquo;I dunno. Anyhow, when  I came to myself I scouted to find you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Poachers!&rdquo;  chuckled Selwin. &ldquo;Come along, sir. This is like old times in the wilds. Glad  you are with me, sir,&rdquo; he chuckled again.</p>
  <p>Shortly  two men were exploring the bush with keen glances everywhere for a possible  poacher. Selwin glanced round the glade, and made mental notes in the growing  light of the rising moon. He saw that the horse was missing, the caravan door  was open, and noted the bedding by the fire. Everything was in keeping with the  story, and he scratched his head in a puzzled way. &ldquo;Seems all right, sir. Sure  you ain&rsquo;t been dreaming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rot?  I was wide awake. Look round carefully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  officer obeyed, and nosed about like a hound on the trail, while Dick at his  heels urged promptitude and caution. Wishing Selwin to be the finder of the  body, Lawson gradually urged him toward the path, believing that he would  naturally be on fire to explore it. And this happened, for the policeman  shouted discovery while Dick was ostentatiously examining the opposite side of  the glade. Lawson raced toward the sound. &ldquo;Hullo! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up  this blinking path, sir. Here&mdash;here&mdash;here!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;This!&rdquo;  Lawson halted by the birch tree. &ldquo;Shout again!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selwin  did so, and Dick sped up the windings quickly, purposely diving to right and  left among the brushwood, as if unaware of the geography of the place. He  arrived breathless, to find the officer&rsquo;s torch flashing over the dead face,  and the officer himself excited beyond measure.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murder,  sir. Look at the blood. And a woman.&rdquo; He looked closer, bending down. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s  Lady Hamber!&rdquo; He straightened himself in dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Hamber,&rdquo; he repeated solemnly. &ldquo;Lady Hamber!&rdquo; Dick echoed the name with equal  dismay. He remembered the letter. &ldquo;Lady Hamber!&rdquo;&mdash;he spoke as solemnly as Selwin  had done.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IV"></a>Chapter IV</b></h2>
  <p>FORTUNATELY  the imperfect moon light prevented Selwin from noticing the startled look of  his companion which might have suggested leading questions. The mention of the  dead woman&rsquo;s name, so intimately connected with what he carried in his pocket,  shook Dick considerably. With cautious cunning he feigned complete ignorance. &ldquo;And  who is Lady Hamber?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Widow  of Sir John Hamber,&rdquo; answered the policeman, glibly. &ldquo;Sarley Court.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sarley  Court!&rdquo; echoed Lawson, wondering if the unknown girl had come from that house;  wondering also if she had anything to do with this mysterious death. &ldquo;Lady  Hamber of Sarley Court,&rdquo; repeated Selwin, more to himself than to his  companion. &ldquo;What was she doing in this blinking wood so late.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  we could learn that we might find out who murdered her,&rdquo; said Dick drily.</p>
  <p>Selwin  nodded. &ldquo;Did you see her in the glade by any chance, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  So far as I know she never entered the glade. Do you think she was coming to  the glade when she was shot down?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  policeman criticised the attitude of the body and was perplexed by the  disposition of the same. &ldquo;Lying sideways, face up&rsquo;ard,&rdquo; he said, shaking his  head with official gravity. &ldquo;Seems to me as one can&rsquo;t say nohow if she was  coming or going.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly  not going,&rdquo; remarked Dick, positively; &ldquo;had she passed through the glade I  should have seen her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you was sleeping in the caravan, sir,&rdquo; objected the constable.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but later on, in the open, by the fire, as you see. Besides, as I told you, I  was hunting for my horse when Lady Hamber was shot down. At a quarter to eleven  I heard the crack of a revolver when I was groping my way through trees and  underwood over yonder. It is just as well to be precise, Selwin, or people will  think that I have something to do with the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  policeman threw back his head and laughed scornfully. &ldquo;No one &lsquo;ud be such a  fool as to think that, sir. Any tramps about the glade tonight, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t see any. I saw no man of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  no woman, since you never set eyes on Lady Hamber,&rdquo; chuckled Selwin.</p>
  <p>Dick  did not contradict him, since truth-telling was risky. &ldquo;Lady Hamber,&rdquo; he mused,  looking down on the still, white, handsome face. &ldquo;Had she enemies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  she wasn&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call popular, sir. Haughty and stuck-up and thinking a  power of herself. But murder&mdash;&rdquo; Selwin shook his head again. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as  anyone would have gone so far as murder. Evening dress with jewels, I see; not  a robbery, I take it, unless the cove as did it had no time to lift the swag.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had ample time. I heard the shot at a quarter to eleven, and when I met you on  the road it was after half-past eleven. I was insensible meanwhile from the  knock on the head. But as you say, Selwin, evening dress, alone in a wild wood  at so late an hour. What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Them  at Sarley Court may be able to tell us,&rdquo; suggested the policeman, &ldquo;Help me to  carry the body, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  obeyed, lifting the head while Selwin swung up the feet. &ldquo;Where is the place&mdash;Sarley  Court, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  like a stone&rsquo;s throw away, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Up  this path?&rdquo; Dick remembered how the girl had come down this byway.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  sir. This here wood joins on to the park, and there&rsquo;s a fence between with a  gate of sorts. Lady Hamber must have come this way to get into the wood, though  goodness knows why she was messing about here after dark.&rdquo; And the perplexed  officer shook his head with the air of a beaten man.</p>
  <p>The  two carried the dead woman slowly along the path, stopping every now and then.  The way was so narrow, so twisted, so tangled with briar and brushwood, that it  was some considerable time before they reached the gate. A bright half-moon  revealed the fence, which turned out to be a low brick wall into which were  mortised stout posts, supporting wire-netting.</p>
  <p>Passing  through a gate at the park boundary they struggled along a little used path, as  crooked and tangled as that in the wood, and suddenly emerged into a vast space  of smooth, green lawns, girdled by ancient oaks and elms, beech, birch, and  chestnut trees. On a slight rising, approached by three terraces, rose the big  house of mingled flint and stone and brick, with steeply sloping roofs and many  windows glittering coldly in the moonlight.</p>
  <p>The  mansion fronting them was as dark as the wood, and as silent; no lights, no  sound, no indication of life anywhere. &ldquo;Gone to bed.&rdquo; commented Selwin, ponderously.  &ldquo;Why wasn&rsquo;t she there, too, and what was she doin&rsquo; in Sarley Wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  naturally could not reply to these questions, and said nothing, but he uttered  an exclamation of relief when they turned the corner of the house after  climbing the three flights of terrace steps. Here four French windows were  ablaze with vivid light, and one of them stood wide open, as though an inmate  of the mansion had stepped out for a mouthful of fresh air. Undoubtedly, if  circumstantial evidence went for anything, Lady Hamber had made use of this  exit, but&mdash;&rdquo;Why did she walk as far as that bloomin&rsquo; wood?&rdquo; queried the  constable, voicing Dick&rsquo;s mental question. &ldquo;Queer go, ain&rsquo;t it, sir? We&rsquo;d best  carry her in and call up the servants.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>On  a convenient couch of rose-colored brocade they laid down their uncomfortable  burden, and Selwin went to shout for assistance while Lawson kept watch. When  alone he glanced curiously round the room, a luxurious apartment with a richly  painted ceiling. In his half-undressed state&mdash;without gaiters and coat, clothed  mainly in pyjamas, with the addition of breeches and stout boots&mdash;Dick felt very  much out of the picture. But the servants, who now began to push into the room,  were not much better as regards clothing, being all more or less untidy and in  hastily assumed costumes. Selwin drew them into line, quite in a military way,  and began to question a very dignified butler, who remained dignified  throughout in spite of his dishabille and natural alarm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Hamber,&rdquo; said the constable, pointing to the body on the couch, &ldquo;dead&mdash;found in  the wood by this gentleman and myself, shot through the heart. What do you know  about it? Be careful, for anything you say will be used in evidence against  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I  don&rsquo;t know&mdash;anything,&rdquo; quavered the butler, while a wail of alarm rose from the  female servants, horror-struck in the presence of death. &ldquo;We all went to bed at  10, leaving her ladyship here with Mr. Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  is Mr. Randolph?&rdquo; Selwin made a note of the name.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  friend of her ladyship&rsquo;s, who came over here this evening from Mr. Pollard&rsquo;s  place to stay for a few days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  bed, I suppose,&rdquo; said the bewildered man, staring at the body of his late  mistress as if the eyes would start out of his head.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Sir Gerald?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s  in bed, too; went there at 9 o&rsquo;clock. You know, Mr. Selwin, as he had an  accident with his motor car and has been ill for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know.&rdquo; The policeman glanced round at the frightened faces. &ldquo;Well, and have any  of you anything to say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  came in a chorus, and one after another endorsed the butler&rsquo;s statement that  they had all retired to bed at 10 o&rsquo;clock, leaving her ladyship and Mr.  Randolph in the drawing room. &ldquo;But Miss Audrey is sitting with her brother,&rdquo;  volunteered the housekeeper, a stout old dame, wearing a nightcap and a bed  robe of flaming red.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must see her; see everyone,&rdquo; said Selwin, positively. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Randolph&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  name!&rdquo; A tall young man with a toothbrush moustache as black as his  closely-trimmed hair lounged into the room. He was clothed from head to foot in  a sage-green silk dressing gown, and smoked a cigarette. &ldquo;Heard a row,&rdquo; he  explained in a drawling way. &ldquo;Thought this might be useful; burglars. What?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  officer took the revolver, which Randolph held and examined the chambers  carefully. &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t been fired,&rdquo; he muttered, laying it on the table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should it have been fired?&rdquo; asked the young man, greatly amazed, and shot an  enquiring glance at Lawson, whom he recognised as one of his own class,  notwithstanding the shabby undress.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Hamber has been shot in the wood, sir,&rdquo; stammered the butler, and moved aside  to reveal the body on the couch.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  Lord!&rdquo; Randolph dropped his easy tone, also his cigarette, and stepped forward  swiftly, with a look of horrified amazement. &ldquo;Who shot her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what I am trying to find out, sir,&rdquo; said Selwin, significantly. &ldquo;Mrs Trotte&rdquo;&mdash;he  turned to the stout housekeeper&mdash;&rdquo;go up and ask Sir Gerald and his sister to  come down at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I say, you know,&rdquo; cried Randolph, as the woman left the room, &ldquo;I was with Lady  Hamber here up to 9 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten,  according to the servants,&rdquo; interposed Dick, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to bed at nine,&rdquo; insisted Randolph, wheeling to face the speaker; &ldquo;but I  did come down just before ten to get a book I had left here. The butler was in  the room when I came down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  were, sir,&rdquo; struck in the butler, &ldquo;and I left you here with her ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so; but I went upstairs again a minute or so after ten.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  Lady Hamber?&rdquo; asked Selwin, pointedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  said that she was going to the library to write some business letters; but I  left her in this room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Was  that window open?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but she said nothing about going out,&rdquo; said the young man, perplexed. &ldquo;And  after reading my book for a time I went to bed, and was awakened by the infernal  row you have all been making.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man spoke convincingly, and Dick believed that he was truly explaining the  events of the evening. Selwin nodded once more, and was about to ask another  question, when Mrs. Trotte rolled into the room, much flustered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Audrey begs that you will excuse her, Mr. Selwin, as she is sitting up with Sir  Gerald, and don&rsquo;t want him waked out of a lovely sleep, she holding his hand to  keep them eyes of his shut.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  objected to the policeman accepting this excuse as he seemed inclined to do,  being more than anxious to satisfy himself on a certain and very important  point. His whispered suggestion altered the man&rsquo;s mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Take  me to Sir Gerald&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; commanded Selwin, sharply. &ldquo;Mr. Lawson, come with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Trotte objected vehemently, but was nevertheless compelled to become an  unwilling guide. Leaving the excited, hysterical servants at one end of the  room and Randolph staring at the dead body of his unfortunate hostess at the  other, the two men followed the stout housekeeper. Protesting loudly all the  way that they would rob Sir Gerald of a much-needed sleep, she panted up the  wide staircase, along the spacious corridor, and knocked gently at a door near  the far end. In answer to a soft invitation, Selwin, with the other man at his  heels, stepped promptly into the room. They found themselves in the rosy  twilight of shaded electric bulbs to behold a handsome lad sleeping on the bed  close to an open window. Beside him, holding his hand, sat an agitated young  lady, swathed in a crane-embroidered kimono of white silk. Lawson stared with  all his eyes. Yet he was by no means surprised. She&mdash;as he expected&mdash;was the very  girl who had appeared and disappeared so mysteriously in the wood of adventure.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="V"></a>Chapter V</b></h2>
  <p>Lawson  instinctively knew that Miss Hamber not only recognised him immediately, but  had guessed at his presence in the house from the moment Mrs. Trotte had taken  up Selwin&rsquo;s summons. Consequently, so far as he was concerned, she had her  feelings completely under control, and after an indifferent glance in his  direction addressed herself pointedly to the constable. With him, indeed, she  was anything but indifferent, displaying considerable distress and alarm. But  for the fear of waking her brother, she would undoubtedly have been even more  vehement in showing her anxiety. As it was, she spoke in an eagerly enquiring  whisper. &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo; she asked, trying to control herself.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  miss,&rdquo; Selwin spoke as softly as she did, knowing, from village gossip, that  the baronet&rsquo;s nerves were dangerously shattered by his motor car accident, and  that possibly to waken him suddenly might wreck his reason. &ldquo;She is dead. Her  body is lying in the drawing room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Hamber! Dead!&rdquo; Audrey shivered, and turned even paler than she was.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shot  through the heart,&rdquo; whispered Dick over Selwin&rsquo;s shoulder, and with his eyes  fixed intently on her anxious face.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Murdered?&rdquo;  She put the question with a quick indrawing of her breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;By&mdash;by&mdash;whom?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far we don&rsquo;t know, miss,&rdquo; struck in Selwin, staring alternately at the girl and  the sleeping man. &ldquo;Have you any idea who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  she interrupted, quietly positive, her bosom rising and falling with  overpowering emotion held in check determinedly. &ldquo;I have been here for the  greater part of the evening holding my brother&rsquo;s hand. He will wake if I take  it away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t  you come downstairs, miss, and explain?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is nothing to explain,&rdquo; replied the girl, fiercely, but keeping her voice to  undertones. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave my brother; I won&rsquo;t leave him. This is the first  sound sleep he has had for nights and nights. If he wakes he may lose his  sanity. You know, Selwin.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  miss. That accident broke him up a lot, miss. Shan&rsquo;t stay longer than I can  help; but you understand, I must hunt while the trail is hot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Yes! It&rsquo;s terrible&mdash;horrible!&rdquo; She wiped her pale lips with a cobweb  handkerchief. &ldquo;Anything I can say or do to help&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, miss. Perhaps you can explain why Lady Hamber went into the wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  surprise exhibited by the girl was so perfect that had not Dick been aware of  recent events, he would have been deceived. &ldquo;Was she in the wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selwin  nodded respectfully. &ldquo;We found her body on the path leading to the park.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  the path leading to the park,&rdquo; repeated Audrey, and again her manifestation of  surprise was a masterpiece of acting. &ldquo;But how did it&mdash;I mean, how did she get  there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what I am trying to learn, miss,&rdquo; said Selwin, drily. &ldquo;If you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I know nothing,&rdquo; she interrupted again, and again in a fierce whisper. &ldquo;About  half-past 9 I came up here to sit with my brother, who retired to bed at 8 o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Leaving  Lady Hamber and Mr. Randolph, in the drawing room, miss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no, I left her there, but Mr. Randolph had already gone to bed. He has been  staying with my Uncle Oliver at Sarley Grange, and told me that he had been  walking over the grounds during the day for miles. So he went to bed early,  and, as my brother needed me, I left Lady Hamber in the drawing room. She said  she was going to the library to write business letters.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you have been in this room ever since half-past 9, miss?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  said Audrey, boldly, and stared directly at Dick, who stared back in an equally  searching manner. The situation adjusted itself between them without words, and  she drew a deep breath of relief. &ldquo;Sitting beside my brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you know nothing, miss?&rdquo; Selwin looked disappointed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  she said, resolutely, but this time did not look at Lawson, aware by her  previous glance that what he knew he would keep secret.</p>
  <p>The  constable stood irresolute, overcome by the situation. A more independent and  zealous officer would have insisted upon her coming into the presence of the  dead, so as to shake her into possible confession, presuming that she had any  knowledge. But Selwin was a native of Sarley Village, and his hereditary  respect for his local superiors prevented him from pushing things to extremes.  Also the danger of the sickness complicated matters. With a remembrance of his  former master&rsquo;s resourceful mind in African wilds, he turned to him for  counsel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think that Miss Hamber has said all she can say for the moment,&rdquo; advised Dick,  promptly. &ldquo;Tomorrow morning, when released from her vigil, she can tell more&mdash;that  is, if she knows more, which I doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey  shot him a grateful glance. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t know&mdash;more,&rdquo; she gasped, &ldquo;and I&mdash;I can&rsquo;t&mdash;bear  any&mdash;any trouble at present. This horrible death is enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Naturally!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson,  taking Selwin&rsquo;s arm, guided him gently to the door, where Mrs. Trotte hovered  anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  worry, Miss Hamber,&rdquo; he added, looking back with his eyes on her feet, &ldquo;all  will come right in the end.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey  drew her feet under her kimono, guessing from his significant glance exactly  what he meant she should guess. The excuse of holding her brother&rsquo;s hand did  away with the risk of rising and revealing a sprained ankle. If Selwin saw that  she limped he would probably have declined belief in her staying-at-home tale.  Dick knew, and she knew that he knew, that several lies had been told during  the last 15 minutes; but these were white lies to save someone&mdash;possibly the  young man on the bed, who had slept throughout the conversation. On the way  down the stairs, at the heels of the voluble housekeeper and Constable Selwin,  Lawson considered the matter. If the sick brother with shattered nerves had  retired to bed at 8 o&rsquo;clock, he, naturally, could not have been hidden in the  wood to fire the shot. There was someone else concerned in the matter, he felt  sure, if only to carry back the girl to Sarley Court, since she could not have  walked hither with a sprained ankle. Out of gratitude, she might be, and  probably was, shielding this person, for in no other way could he account for  her obstinate deception. Of course, in thus acting a difficult part, she was  lying cleverly and cautiously. Dick disapproved of falsehood, but was forced to  be lenient in his judgment, remembering how he had lied himself earlier in the  evening. More, he admired the pluck of the girl in facing a desperate situation  so resolutely. She was to him a heroine, as well as a beauty. It must be  confessed that her attractive looks biassed the young man in his conclusions,  for, if it was possible to fall in love at sight, he was fathoms deep in an  ocean of nectarous sweetness. &ldquo;But it is a devil of a mess,&rdquo; ruminated Lawson,  on returning to the drawing room. The ordinary duties of a country policeman  had not educated Selwin into dealing with mysterious crimes, and he was baffled  at the outset. The servants, Mr. Randolph, Miss Hamber, all had told their  various stories, honestly enough, it would seem. These threw no light on the  darkness, indicated no trail, pointed to no safe conclusion. In a quandary,  Selwin appealed again to Lawson for advice. And as Dick was as much an inborn  ruler as the policeman was an inborn servant, he promptly interpreted the  appealing glance, giving Selwin the credit of being in authority. &ldquo;As you  suggested to me, constable,&rdquo; he said, when all were looking to the officer for  guidance, &ldquo;it will be best to leave things as they are until the morning.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course, sir.&rdquo; Selwin was grateful for sound advice, masked under an open  recognition of his official position.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should arrest me, Selwin. It would show real zeal an your part,&rdquo; said Dick when  they passed out into the park.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Show  me up as a bally idiot, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Selwin. &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t I known you for four or  five years, inside out?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  nodded, touched by the man&rsquo;s loyalty. &ldquo;Still, the body was found in the wood,  and I was camping in the wood. I might have a revolver&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  take your word for it, sir, that you haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; struck in Selwin, swiftly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;All  right between you and I, Selwin, but we must satisfy the coroner as to that.  Just shift my goods in the caravan to make sure of my honesty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Openly  grumbling at this cautious advice, but recognising its wisdom, Selwin pushed  on, through the park and the wood, finally arriving at the glade. Here he went  through the contents of the caravan methodically, turning over everything both  inside and outside. Also he searched the glade and the path, but without any  result in any direction. &ldquo;Clever chap that chap as did it sir,&rdquo; commented the  baffled constable, with a shrug of despair, &ldquo;ain&rsquo;t left never a trace behind  him. Now I&rsquo;m going to the post office to knock up the gal with the wire and get  a telegram sent off to my inspector at Tarhaven. And you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall stay here and get some kind of a sleep. Unless you want me, of course.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No! That&rsquo;s all right, sir. See you at sunrise, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>When  Selwin went off with a hasty salute Dick filled his pipe, rekindled the fire,  and boiled a kettle of water to brew himself some strong tea, which refreshment  he very greatly required. Then, instead of seeking his bed, he sat by the fire,  thinking deeply. The girl&mdash;her brother. Was she guilty; was he guilty? When the  dawn came with golden lights and winging birds, dew on the grass and wind in  the trees, he was as far off as ever from finding answers to these leading  questions.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VI"></a>Chapter VI</b></h2>
  <p>Sarley  Village&mdash;the inhabitants insisted upon the majesty of the full name&mdash;was made up  of many cottages, round about and climbing up a tolerably high hill, topped by  the church with its wooden spire. The narrow streets ran crookedly anyhow and  anywhere, leading into one another, leading into the surrounding country lanes  confusedly. There were no sidewalks, and the cobblestone pavements sloped  inward to central open drains, down which poured the spring and autumn rains in  torrents. These last washed away all refuse, and kept the place in a sanitary  condition, so this continual cleansing, together with the stimulating winds  from the North Sea, made the locality singularly healthy. The cottages had  whitewashed walls, thatched roofs, quaint, diamond-paned casements, and narrow,  low doors. It was quite a primeval village, such as Arthur&rsquo;s knights might have  stumbled across, and the villagers prided themselves on its simplicity. That  such a place should keep its prehistoric appearance when only four miles from  the main railway to London was a source of pride to all who dwelt therein.</p>
  <p>The  Monk&rsquo;s Inn&mdash;two cottages thrown into one&mdash;was the largest house in the hamlet,  and here the inhabitants collected after the day&rsquo;s work was done to discuss the  small events to their small world. Mostly, the gossips were agricultural  laborers, for Sarley Village was set in the midst of spacious cornlands, dotted  with farms, more or less prosperous. From the churchyard could be seen the  marshes, the broad silver line of the Thames, and the distant loom of the  Kentish hills. But inland, from the cluster of cottages, stretched a rich land  of alluvial soil, with wheat fields, blossoming hedges, and here and there  limited woodlands, the remains of a once overspreading forest. Sarley Court,  divided from the hamlet by Sarley Wood, lay to the left of the hill, and Sarley  Grange to the right, two and a trifle more miles away.</p>
  <p>The  mysterious and startling crime committed in Sarley Wood amazed and shocked the  villagers, especially as the victim was the chief lady of the countyside. But  it cannot be said that they expressed any great sorrow, for she had never been  popular, and, indeed, was frankly disliked for her tyranny. Still, the tragedy  of her sudden death galvanised everyone into something resembling energy, and  the Monk&rsquo;s Inn was filled from morning to night with stolid Saxon folk debating  the whys and wherefors of the matter. Some said this, others said that; but no  one had any idea as to how Lady Hamber had come by her unexpected death. The  whole place was in an uproar when Inspector Helder and his myrmidons came  post-haste from Tarhaven in response to Selwin&rsquo;s summons. With them, men,  women, and children streamed eagerly towards Sarley Wood, which now took on a  sinister aspect, likely to grow largely when winter tales were told by the  fireside. Helder&rsquo;s police drove away the morbid sightseers, formed a cordon,  and prevented all exploration, with the result that the gossipers were reduced  to chattering in street and cottage and public-house. The general view  expressed was that Sir Gerald and Miss Audrey would be thankful that Lady  Hamber had passed away, tragic though her going was.</p>
  <p>That  such an uncomplimentary opinion should be held was due to the dead woman  herself. She had never attempted to conciliate local prejudices, and, indeed,  had gone out of her way to accentuate them, with that true aristocratic  intolerance which leads to revolutions. She had always been looked upon as a  haughty despot, whose insolent manner was only equalled by her superlative bad  temper. No person of either sex had a good word to say for her, and some even  hinted that she thoroughly deserved her fate. It was suggested that some  poacher, or discharged servant, or evicted tenant, had shot her out of revenge;  but no one could indicate, with any precision, as to who had done the deed. The  circumstances of the death&mdash;the reason for the death&mdash;the name of the assassin  who had inflicted death&mdash;these were unfathomable mysteries. And mysteries they  remained when the inquest took place in the largest room of the Monk&rsquo;s Inn two  days later.</p>
  <p>Certainly,  as more became known of the presence of the caravan in Sarley Wood, various  suspicious persons wondered, openly, if its owner had committed the crime. But  Selwin, loyal to his former master, soon nipped these rumors in the bud by  pointing out that Mr. Lawson was a stranger in the land, that he had never set  eyes on Lady Hamber, that he possessed no revolver, and finally, that he had  been the first to give the alarm. This, said Selwin, he would scarcely have  done, if guilty, without risking the feel of a rope round his neck. Also, the  constable eulogised Lawson as the saviour of his life in Africa, talked of his  hunting exploits, and spoke feelingly of his generous hand, his kind heart, his  qualities of perfect comradeship with high and low. In this way the grateful  man repaid his debt to Dick, and stopped much wicked gossip before it grew to  dangerous proportions. So when he ventured into Sarley Village, Lawson found  himself greeted with all due respect, and understood that public opinion  exonerated him from all complicity. Even when he appeared before coroner and  jury in the commercial room of the Inn, no one credited him with committing the  crime, or of having knowledge of the perpetrator of the crime. Dick felt, and  said later on, when the storm blew over, that he owed a deep debt of gratitude  to Selwin for his championship.</p>
  <p>But  for that loyal friend he might have been placed in an awkward position.</p>
  <p>Inspector  Helder, Selwin, and Lawson did their best to obtain all possible evidence to  place before the coroner. But their efforts resulted in nothing, or next to  nothing, for when the inquest took place little more was known than had been  known immediately the shot was fired. Lady Hamber, without the knowledge of  anyone in the house, had gone into the wood, and there had been shot by some  unknown person, who had vanished into thin air. Why she had gone, or who had  murdered her, it was impossible to discover. Helder, clever enough in ordinary  police duties, professed himself confounded when confronted by this abnormal  event.</p>
  <p>The  number of witnesses called was naturally large, since all the Sarley Court  servants had to be in attendance. The story of one and all was the same. Sir  Gerald Hamber, a delicate-looking young man, declared that he had retired to  bed at 8 o&rsquo;clock, leaving his stepmother&mdash;for such Lady Hamber was to him and  Audrey&mdash;his sister, and Randolph in the drawing-room. Randolph stated that being  weary after wandering for hours over the Gollard estate, he had retired also,  leaving Miss Hamber and the elder lady together. Just before 10 o&rsquo;clock he had  come down again to fetch a book, and found Lady Hamber, but not her  stepdaughter, who had gone to sit with her brother. Audrey herself deposed to  the departure of her brother and the visitor at the times stated, and that she  herself went upstairs at half-past nine to soothe Sir Gerald to sleep. The  servants, headed by the dignified butler and the stout housekeeper, swore that  they had retired to bed at 10 o&rsquo;clock, so it would seem that after that hour no  one had seen the deceased. Backhouse was the last to see her, just before ten,  and had also seen Mr. Randolph when he came down to fetch the book. Selwin  stated that the drawing-room was lighted up, and that one of the French windows  was open when he and Mr. Lawson brought the body to the big house. Lady Hamber,  throwing a veil over her head, had evidently stepped out for a breath of fresh  air after writing her business letters in the library.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why should the deceased have gone so far as the wood?&rdquo; asked the coroner.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say, sir,&rdquo; replied the constable, stolidly.</p>
  <p>Lawson&rsquo;s  evidence was listened to with breathless interest, and he was careful to repeat  the story he had already told to Selwin. While doing this he saw that Miss  Hamber was watching him steadily all the time, as if wondering why he withheld  mention of her visit to his camp. But of this he said nothing. Yes, he had  camped in Sarley Wood, and had heard the shot while looking for his horse. &ldquo;At  a quarter to eleven,&rdquo; said the witness. &ldquo;The church clock chimed that hour just  before I heard the crack of the revolver. I ran at once towards the glade, but,  hitting by head against a tree, became insensible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  how long?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t say,&rdquo; confessed Lawson, frankly; &ldquo;but it was after half-past 11 when I came  across the constable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Selwin  (recalled) stated that he agreed with the last witness as to the time, as it  was shortly after midnight when he and Mr. Lawson carried the body into the  Sarley Court drawing room. He described the finding of the body.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;From  the position of the body, would you say the deceased was coming into the glade  or going away from it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t tell that, sir. The body was lying sideways on the path.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  was again questioned as to whether he expected any visitor, and if he knew the  dead woman. To both questions he replied in the negative. He saw no tramps  about the glade. &ldquo;I am a light sleeper,&rdquo; said the witness, &ldquo;and, being in the  open, would have heard the slightest footfall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  well,&rdquo; said the coroner, when the scanty evidence was complete, &ldquo;it does not  seem to me that we have learnt much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have learnt nothing,&rdquo; grumbled Inspector Helder, disconsolately. &ldquo;An open  verdict is all that can be given.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  an open verdict was given, for the jury could only say that the crime had been  committed by some person or persons unknown. There were some uncomplimentary  remarks made regarding the absence of the revolver, with which the poor lady  had been shot; but, on the fact of it, this was not the fault of the police, as  the wood had been searched from end to end. Also there was a sense of  dissatisfaction with the verdict. &ldquo;For my own sake,&rdquo; said Lawson to Inspector  Helder, &ldquo;I wish the mystery of the death had been solved.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do I,&rdquo; rejoined the officer, &ldquo;but so far as you are concerned, sir, the law has  nothing on you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you for your good opinion, inspector. All the same, I intend to look into the  matter and get at the truth myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  be clever if you do, sir,&rdquo; said Helder cynically.</p>
  <p>Naturally,  as Lady Hamber was a great personage, the funeral was sumptuous and stately.  People came from all over the country and from London, so that the little  hill-top churchyard was crowded. Audrey and her brother were present, but  avoided Lawson; indeed, took not the slightest notice of him. He was annoyed by  this, particularly on the part of the girl, seeing how his silence had  prevented trouble from coming to her. &ldquo;When Lady Hamber&rsquo;s body was laid to rest  in the family vault, he tried to meet the couple face to face, while the  throngs of mourners was breaking up. In this attempt he failed, and their  attitude of dodging a meeting inclined him to believe that the girl had  something to do with the murder, and that the brother knew that she had. Or the  brother was guilty and the sister was shielding him. Dick returned to his camp  firmly resolved to bring the pair to book next day. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t see either Sir Gerald or Miss Audrey, sir,&rdquo; said Backhouse, the dignified  butler, when the young man presented himself next day at Sarley Court front  door, with the idea of extorting a confession from one or the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  must see them, and at once,&rdquo; insisted Lawson, his face growing dark.</p>
  <p>Backhouse  shook his head gravely. &ldquo;Sir Gerald and Miss Hamber left for the Continent last  night, sir, immediately after the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo;  thought Dick, immediately. &ldquo;He, she, or both of them.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="VII"></a>Chapter VII</b></h2>
  <p>As  the day was exceedingly warm, with a pitiless sun blazing in a sky of tropical  blue, Dick Lawson had sought shelter from intolerable glare and heat under the  spreading beech-tree which shadowed his disreputable caravan. Being more or  less of a professional hawker, he should have been travelling along the dusty  roads toward the next village. But somehow he could not tear himself away from  the neighborhood in which he had met with so extraordinary an adventure. He  wished to conclude it, to get to the bottom of things, to bring the culprit to  justice, and thought that some clue to the truth might be discovered in the  vicinity. Four-and-twenty hours had elapsed since he had stood at the door of  Sarley Court, and during that time Dick had been thinking hard, so far without  any result. There was no beginning and no end to his thoughts; they ran in  circles, the last constantly repeating the first.</p>
  <p>Stretched  at full length under the beech, Dick smoked meditatively, and thought out a  theory&mdash;a story, a possibility, concerning the happenings on that fatal night.  Young Hamber had retired to bed at 8 o&rsquo;clock, leaving his sister, his  step-mother, and the guest in the drawing room; At 9 Randolph had gone  upstairs, while the two women remained. Audrey had declared that she went to  her brothers&rsquo; bedroom 30 minutes later. This Dick did not believe. It was more  probable that she had quarrelled with the elder woman, and had fled from the  house hurriedly&mdash;as was indicated by her unsuitable attire for a night journey&mdash;to  seek refuge with her uncle, Olive Bollard, at Sarley Grange, two miles distant.  Randolph, coming down for the book, and Backhouse, the butler coming for final  orders, had both seen Lady Hamber in the drawing room before 10 o&rsquo;clock.  Lawson, therefore, surmised that immediately they departed she had followed  Audrey through the park into the wood. Probably it was Lady Hamber, overhearing  the conversation about the sprained ankle, who had slipped the halter from the  horse, so that Audrey might be prevented from travelling in the caravan to  Sarley Grange. And then&mdash;here Dick&rsquo;s imagination gave out. Audrey was in the  caravan while he was trailing the horse. Lady Hamber probably lurking up the  path. But how the girl had left the caravan with her useless ankle, and how  Lady Hamber had replaced her on the bed, it was impossible to say. There  certainly was&mdash;as Dick conjectured&mdash;a third person involved, who had shot the  elder woman, transferred her body to the caravan, and carried Audrey to her  home. But who was that person? Not Sir Gerald, who was a mere wreck, and  incapable of active participation. Then who else? So far Lawson&rsquo;s thoughts ran  easily: now they came to full stop.</p>
  <p>Audrey,  who could have thrown light on the darkness, had fled to France with her  brother, to whom she had doubtless confessed everything. The wonderful thing  was that she trusted so wholly to Lawson to preserve an honorable silence, and  had not even thought it worth while to demand a promise of secrecy in a  personal interview. It was this neglect that justified her mainly in Dick&rsquo;s  eyes. Had she been really guilty she assuredly would have striven to extort  some such promise. As it was, being innocent&mdash;so Lawson believed&mdash;she left him  unfettered in any way. But he had seen the relief in her eyes, both in the  bedroom and in the room where the inquest was held. Therefore she trusted him,  and Dick, ridiculously in love with a girl about whom he knew next to nothing,  swore inwardly that he would still continue to hold his peace. Nevertheless, he  wished to meet her and ask questions. But it was difficult to bring about such  a meeting. In the hope of evolving some plan to do so, he continued to think,  and closed his eyes, the better to concentrate his jostling thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you are here. Good! I am glad to find you. Hi, Lawson! Wake up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  opened his eyes, sat up and stared at the bulky figure of a stout old gentleman  who was moving with a surprisingly light step across the glade. He put a name  to him at once. &ldquo;Mr. Bollard.&rdquo; and rose, wondering why his visitor had come.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Himself!&rdquo;  assented Bollard, straddling his huge legs, taking off his straw hat, and  wiping his round ruddy face with a yellow and red bandana handkerchief, &ldquo;and  glad to find you so immediately young Lawson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  asked Dick, very directly.</p>
  <p>The  intruder produced a gold snuff box, tapped it lightly, and refreshed himself  with a goodly pinch of the mixture. He was over 6 ft. in height, immensely  stout, and his large, clean-shaven face was like a setting winter sun in its  fullness and redness. With shrewd grey eyes, a hard mouth, and an eagle-beaked  nose, Mr. Oliver Bollard looked quite a formidable person. But when his eyes  twinkled and his mouth smiled&mdash;as they did while he looked at his slim young  friend&mdash;he became less threatening in bulk and looks. In fact, he suggested a  good-natured elephant, with a giant&rsquo;s strength put to good uses. Dick knew him  of old, and realised that he was much less of an ogre than he looked. And after  the passing of his first surprise, the young fellow accepted the newcomer&rsquo;s  presence as natural. &ldquo;I saw you at the funeral yesterday,&rdquo; he remarked, to  break the silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you not come and speak to me, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was&mdash;there is&mdash;nothing to speak about,&rdquo; retorted Dick, shrugging.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think there is, or I would not be here,&rdquo; said the stockbroker&mdash;that was his  occupation&mdash;in a roaring voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  really.&rdquo; Dick pointed to the rug whence he had risen. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down and  explain? And, if you like, something, to eat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Something  to drink,&rdquo; thundered Bollard, dropping lightly to the ground. He was  wonderfully light and dexterous, considering his bulk.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tea!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bah!  Yours is a Pussyfoot camp, is it? Well, well, the better for you, if not for  your visitors. I believe in young people being temperate.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  old people?&rdquo; asked Dick, with an amused look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  they can do as they like. I am fond of my glass myself. But you&mdash;no, no!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  preach what you don&rsquo;t practice, Mr. Bollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am a signpost; go where I point. Ha ha!&rdquo; he roared at his mild joke. &ldquo;And now,  young Lawson, I knew you as a brat in petticoats, and your father since he was  a Sandhurst cadet. For that reason I gave you a letter to Lady Hamber to get  employment. It has not been delivered, I presume.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so. Lady Hamber was murdered before I could call at Sarley Court.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  murdered her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  shrugged again. &ldquo;Ask me another. If you are acquainted with the proceedings  which took place at the Monks&rsquo; Inn you must know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know all that there is to be known,&rdquo; said Bollard with a snort, &ldquo;and that  amounts to nothing. I saw Inspector Helder and your village constable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Selwin,  I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.  He does not believe that you have anything to do with the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  nodded. &ldquo;We are old friends. And I venture to say that you do not suggest any  complicity on my part in this crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course. Seeing that it was to your advantage to deliver that letter and get  employment, Lady Hamber was more useful to you alive than dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  I agree with you.&rdquo; Dick bent his head in grave assent.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  knowing that you had this letter, which, by the way, I notice you did not  mention in your evidence, you should have searched me out yesterday when I was  at the funeral. In place of that I have to come hunting after you.&rdquo; The last  words came in an indignant roar.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see no reason why I should see you or you see me, Mr. Bollard, The letter has  nothing to do with the mystery of this crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mystery.  Ha! Exactly. Mystery! What do you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told everything I knew.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No.&rdquo; Mr. Bollard&rsquo;s eyes lost their twinkle, and became as hard as those of a  cat on a mouse hunt &ldquo;You kept silent about something. Come, now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did I keep silent about?&rdquo; asked Lawson, wondering at this probing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you to inform me,&rdquo; countered the other smartly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  eyes of Bollard bored into Dick, as if to search out his most intimate  thoughts. &ldquo;I love my niece,&rdquo; he said finally, and with apparent irrelevance. &ldquo;Yes,  and I loved her mother, my sister, quite as much, if not more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  Dick looked an enquiry, for the conversation puzzled him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t think that my&mdash;my niece, has anything to do with&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; interrupted the other man positively, and a trifle untruthfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  Bollard took another pinch of snuff, and sighed with relief. Yet when he spoke  again it was again with apparent irrelevance. &ldquo;A man of your birth and brains  cannot go touring the country side as a hawker. Come to London, young Lawson,  and I shall get you a post in a West-End establishment as a riding master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  a riding master?&rdquo; demanded Lawson, grateful for the offer, but still wondering  at Mr. Bollard&rsquo;s aggressive friendliness.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are fond of horses&rdquo;&mdash;Bollard heaved himself up from the ground&mdash;&rdquo;and you enjoy an  open-air life. Come now; what do you say?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  accept?&rdquo; roared the Good Samaritan ogre.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I want to be in London&mdash;for reasons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Again  Bollard&rsquo;s eyes hardened; again he looked a searching enquiry. But he did not  ask for any explanations. &ldquo;Good. When will you be in town?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  five or six days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good.  Call at my office. You know where it is. Then we can talk further.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you do all this for me?&rdquo; asked Dick as Bollard turned away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  knew your father; I know you,&rdquo; called back the big man over his shoulder, and  sped lightly out of the glade, like an escaping fairy&mdash;say a giant Puck.</p>

  <p>Within  two weeks of rearranging his future, Dick had established himself in shabby  rooms in a shabby Bloomsbury boarding-house. These were not such as he would  have chosen had he been possessed of any plausible banking account; for a  lavish up-bringing had inculcated luxurious tastes. However, a lengthy  experience of lean days in African wilds had accustomed this stepson of Nature&mdash;so  he regarded himself&mdash;to discomfort, and he was content with bed, board, fire,  and limited pocket-money. Of course, he hoped sooner or later, to revert to the  civilised delights of his nonage, when his father was alive and cash plentiful;  but he could not see, at the moment, how he could recover these fair-weather  days. The prospect of earning money as a riding master did not allure him; but  it was all that offered, and an improvement on the alternative of walking the  streets. So Lawson, thankful for the grudging gifts of the gods, went to  interview Mr. Oliver Bollard, 37 Wren street, E.C. From him he hoped to learn  details regarding the situation.</p>
  <p>Being  a born pedestrian, Dick preferred to walk, rather than to ride in an  overcrowded bus, and sauntered leisurely along Holborn on his way to the City.  Ignoring the traffic and the passers-by he mused over his present position.  After seven hours of wrangling with a closefisted gipsy, he had sold the  jingling caravan and its contents, together with the ancient steed, at a tolerable  profit. The price would keep his head above water for the time being, so he was  satisfied on that score. But he was by no means satisfied with the termination&mdash;or  rather the non-termination of his adventure in Sarley Wood.</p>
  <p>Further  searching, further questioning, further theorising, had been but the weaving of  ropes of sand; and he left the glade as wise as when he had first camped  therein. Nevertheless, still hoping for the happening of the unexpected, he had  left his present address with Selwin with instructions to write him should any  clue be discovered. Of Audrey and her brother he had heard nothing since their  hurried departure to Paris; and, indeed, he scarcely expected to hear anything,  seeing what social barriers divided them. At the same time he was watching his  chance to break down those barriers, so that he might obtain an interview with  the girl. She owed him an explanation since he had stood by her in the hour of  need. That explanation he was determined to have, not only that a very natural  curiosity might be gratified, but that his belief in her innocence might be  justified. Of course, being head-over-heels in love, he made sure that she  would be able to exonerate herself in some unforeseen way.</p>
  <p>Although  Mr. Bollard was a wealthy man and extremely well known on the Stock Exchange,  his offices gave no evidence either of position or riches. The building was  mean and small; the business rooms, when Dick gained them up a narrow flight of  stairs, scarcely less so. But the clerks were smartly dressed and alert, while  the outer office had an air of stealthy prosperity felt rather than seen.</p>
  <p>Although  up in the air, so to speak, Lawson had the feeling of being in the treasure  vaults of Midas, gloomy, rough, chilly, but undeniably filled with gold. Dick  was smiling to himself over this flight of fancy on his part, when he was  ushered into the sanctum of the great man. Mr. Bollard, huge and imposing, even  more so in his city clothes than he had been in his country kit, rose to  welcome his visitor, and pounced immediately on that smile with the roar of a  lion. &ldquo;You appear to be pleased with yourself, young Lawson,&rdquo; he said, shaking  hands vigorously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was thinking of the contrast between the glitter of gold and the gloom of your  dingy office.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  now&rdquo;&mdash;Bollard spoke good-humoredly but loudly, as was his custom&mdash;&rdquo;don&rsquo;t  disparage my office, young Lawson. This is the magnet which attracts the gold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;  Dick took a seat near the writing table, &ldquo;That is why I remarked on the  contrast. Why do you compel me to dot my &lsquo;i&rsquo;s&rsquo; and cross my &lsquo;t&rsquo;s&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  don&rsquo;t understand epigrams in the city. But we understand&mdash;none better&mdash;the value  of time, so let us get to business at once. Here&rdquo;&mdash;Bollard passed along an  envelope&mdash;&rdquo;that is a letter of introduction to Simon Tarr, who has a riding  school in Belgravia. Go to that address today at 3 o&rsquo;clock and see him. He  wants a smart young riding master, as his pupils are mostly young ladies&rsquo; who  approve of good looks. Put your goods in the shop window; be well groomed, well  dressed, entertaining, and a good instructor. Then you may marry one of Tarr&rsquo;s  pupils&mdash;there are rich girls among them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  tempt me.&rdquo; said Lawson, slipping the envelope into his pocket with a nod of  thanks.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tempt you? No, no! Eve will do that&mdash;a dozen of Eves. Good heavens! What wouldn&rsquo;t  I give to be young and handsome as you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  poor?&rdquo; queried Lawson with a shrug.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  With your looks and chatter you can buy a rich wife.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  I really? And suppose I don&rsquo;t want to buy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Mr. Bollard shot a look at him. &ldquo;You are in love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Fathoms  deep!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Candid!  Candid!&rdquo; the stockbroker grunted. &ldquo;Pretty girl?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  angel!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  all are until they are married. Rich?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe so, I don&rsquo;t know. What is more. I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;May  I ask her name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not at liberty to give heir name!&rdquo; retorted Dick, wondering what this  prosperous elephant would say if he mentioned Miss Audrey Hamber.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Bollard looked abashed for a moment but soon recovered himself, and apologised  with a good-humored bellow. &ldquo;You must excuse my being inquisitive, young  Lawson, but your father was a very old friend of mine and I am anxious to do  what I can for his son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am more than grateful Mr. Bollard. Your first effort was a failure, so I hope  that this second one will prove a success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hope  so. Hope so.&rdquo; Bollard tumbled his papers about. &ldquo;For your own sake it will be  advisable to say nothing about this Sarley Wood crime. People don&rsquo;t like to mix  up with those who have been connected with such dark doings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;I can assure you, sir, that there were no dark doings on  my part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  I didn&rsquo;t mean that. But it is just as well for you to keep a silent tongue in  that handsome head of yours young Lawson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far I have done so,&rdquo; said Dick drily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  what, what, what? Do you know anything?&rdquo; Bollard looked anxious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told all I knew at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Bollard grunted and looked disappointed. &ldquo;Nothing more has come to light?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  never will.&rdquo; Bollard threw himself back in his chair looking vast and almost  threatening. &ldquo;The Sarley Wood murder will have to be relegated to the list of  undiscovered crimes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  would appear so,&rdquo; confessed Lawson, composedly. &ldquo;But you knew Lady Hamber  intimately, since she married your brother-in-law. What is your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  haven&rsquo;t got one, save that one of her many enemies must have done her in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  nodded. &ldquo;So the Sarley villagers suggest. She had enemies?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  put it in another way, young Lawson, she had no friends. Lady Hamber was a most  detestable woman&mdash;Heaven forgive me for speaking ill of the dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that so? And her past?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  she had no past of the kind understood. Chaste, well-born, accomplished, above  reproach in every way. She was all that, and yet a more meddling, evil-minded,  gossiping woman never lived. Her very virtues were vices.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did she get on with her stepchildren?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  looked uneasy, but answered, honestly enough, in a subdued roar, &ldquo;She bullied  them and made their lives a misery. They disliked her, and she disliked them.  Her death came in the nature of a relief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  the villagers seem to think, Mr. Bollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh?  What?&rdquo; The big man&rsquo;s face grew purple with wrath. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that  any of these villagers suspect&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no,&rdquo; Dick hastened to interrupt, &ldquo;they don&rsquo;t suspect; but they know that Sir  Gerald and his sister are happier without their stepmother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  nodded heavily. &ldquo;They would not be human else. You are sure that there is no  talk about either being inculpated in the matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  sure.&rdquo; Lawson felt that the old man referred particularly to Audrey. &ldquo;You see,  I made every enquiry before I left Sarley Village. Also I have given Selwin my  address, and should he learn anything he will write to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  to you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  rose and shrugged his square shoulders. &ldquo;I had so much to do with the matter  that I wish to see it through.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;See  it through?&rdquo; Bollard also rose, and his face looked anxious. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Can  you ask? I don&rsquo;t like incomplete adventures.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  mean to learn more?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean to learn everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  looked at Dick, and Dick at Bollard. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t, if I were you,&rdquo; said the  stockbroker, gloomily. &ldquo;It will do you no good.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  will bring the assassin of Lady Hamber to the scaffold.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you can do that&rdquo;&mdash;Bollard brought his great hand down with tremendous force on  Lawson&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I am with you. Let me know what you discover. Let us work  together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I thought you did not want me to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not! I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; interrupted the older man, sharply; &ldquo;but since you are bent  upon completing your adventure, as you call it, I have some desire to take a  belated part in it. Also I must confess that for the sake of my&mdash;my&rdquo;&mdash;he gulped&mdash;&rdquo;that  is, of my niece, I want the matter cleared up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Miss Hamber has nothing to do with it!&rdquo; said Dick, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not!&rdquo; Bollard, was quite fierce. &ldquo;Nevertheless, people may say much they  ought not to say. Now good-bye, good-bye. I&rsquo;m busy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  abruptly dismissed, Lawson left the office, and walked back to his Bloomsbury  lodgings. He was more certain than ever that Bollard knew from Audrey herself  of the visit to the glade and the sprained ankle, and was terrified lest  anything should come out to inculpate her. The odd thing was that he was not  more open about the matter, seeing he must know that Dick knew. But all  meditation on this puzzle was ended when Lawson returned to his sitting room to  pick up a bulky letter. He opened it to find a paper on which was typewritten, &ldquo;With  thanks for your silence;&rdquo; also a bundle of 50 ten-pound notes. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo;  ejaculated Dick, &ldquo;Lady Hamber&rsquo;s murderer!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="IX"></a>Chapter IX</b></h2>
  <p>This  unexpected five hundred pounds had apparently fallen from the skies, and Dick  stared at the bundle of notes&mdash;at the single line of typewriting&mdash;with a surprise  too great to be expressed in mere words. This was a bolt from the blue with a vengeance,  but how it had struck the intended person&mdash;himself&mdash;the young man could not  imagine. With his mind full of the late interview with Mr. Bollard, he had  failed to examine the envelope, but now did so, in order, if possible, to trace  the sender of the money. How was it that this anonymous correspondent had  learnt his new address? This part of the mystery proved easier to solve than he  expected, for the notes had been addressed to Richard Lawson care of Constable  Selwin, Sarley Village, with the instruction &ldquo;Please forward.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was nothing unreasonable about this. The criminal knew that Lawson and Selwin  were deeply involved in the tragedy, and it was natural to suppose that they  had kept in touch with one another. The packet had been posted from London to  Sarley Village, thence back again to London. As there was no handwriting, no  name, no registration, it would be difficult to trace the sender. Lawson  flicked through the notes. They were all brand new, and genuine enough, as he  saw. Dick rose to walk up and down his small room, very much puzzled, as he did  not know what to make of the matter.</p>
  <p>It  was at this moment that the name of Mrs. Josephine Tremby flashed into Lawson&rsquo;s  perturbed mind. She was an old friend of his with whom he had been intimate up  to the age of 21, when she was 19. Then he had gone to seek his fortune in  Africa, and although they had corresponded in a perfunctory manner they had not  come together for the last ten years. But Mrs. Tremby had informed Dick of her  marriage; later on the death of her husband, leaving her penniless. Her last  letter&mdash;dated a year ago&mdash;had explained that she now earned bread and butter as a  detective.</p>
  <p>Lawson  looked for the letter, hoping fervently that he had not destroyed it.  Fortunately he came across it among the bundles of papers in his trunk. &ldquo;Mrs.  Josephine Tremby, 24 Parson&rsquo;s street, Soho,&rdquo; read Lawson and ruminated. &ldquo;I  wonder if she is still there. Anyhow, it&rsquo;s worth looking her up at that address  on the chance. If anyone can help me it will be Jossy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>No  sooner had he made up his mind than he acted at once, and sent off a wire  asking if he could see her that evening. While waiting for a reply he filled in  the time by calling on Mr. Simon Tarr at his riding establishing in Belgravia,  and speedily arranged details for his engagement. Mr. Tarr was all that was  amiable, and seemed to be visibly impressed by Dick&rsquo;s superior manner. They  parted on the understanding that Lawson was to take up his duties within three  days and as the salary was satisfactory everything seemed all right.</p>
  <p>Mr.  Tarr was an easy-going personage, and so long as his new employee conducted  riding parties early in the morning and late in the afternoon stated that Dick  could do as he pleased. Lawson returned to his shabby lodgings, much relived by  this unexpected settlement of ways and means to live. And to add to his  gratitude to the gods&mdash;he no longer called them grudging&mdash;he found an answer to  his wire. Mrs. Tremby was still at her year old address, and would expect him  at 8 o&rsquo;clock that evening.</p>
  <p>Dick  made himself smart for the visit, as he wished to do his best to impress his  decidedly critical friend. Dress clothes were out of the question, as he had  not affected such luxuries for years, but he put on a lately purchased suit of  blue serge which his old Bond street tailor had supplied on credit. Dick was an  aristocratic-looking man, who knew how to wear clothes, and was quite satisfied  with his appearance when he knocked at Mrs. Temby&rsquo;s office door. To reach it he  had to climb a narrow flight of dingy stairs in a dingy house, in a dingy  neighborhood. Wondering why so fastidious a woman, as she always was, should  elect to carry on business amidst such grim and shady surroundings, Lawson  entered in response to an invitation. Passing through a chilly, uninviting  outer office, he stepped into a well-furnished room, the appearance of which  was positively luxurious in the rose-hued shading of many electric lights.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby rose from her desk to advance towards him with outstretched hands. &ldquo;My  dear old Dick, I am glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ditto!  Ditto! Jossy, old girl.&rdquo; Dick did not refuse the cheek she proffered, and  kissed her warmly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ages since we met.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ten  years,&rdquo; calculated Mrs. Tremby, indicating a chair with a nod. &ldquo;And whose fault  is that, my dear?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  fault of Fate,&rdquo; retorted the visitor, coolly seating himself. &ldquo;One of the three  sisters sent me abroad to make my fortune and kept you at home to make yours,  Jossy. And&mdash;&rdquo; He looked round significantly.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby shrugged. &ldquo;Oh, my dear boy, all this is camouflage. I manage to keep my  head above water, and that is all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  why in this shady locality?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  hum! I have much to do with foreign scamps in my professional capacity, and  like to be on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not in Scotland Yard&mdash;in the C.I.D.?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  such luck. But occasionally I have been engaged by the authorities in  connection with cases. I rather like the detective business, you know, Dicky;  it&rsquo;s sensational and interesting, particularly when it has to do with  Continental sharpers. But I can&rsquo;t say that I have made my fortune.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  look all right,&rdquo; Dick surveyed her critically.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby really looked more than all right, for her evening dress was costly,  attractive, and admirably chosen. She was a tall, rather massive woman, with a  well-moulded face, strikingly handsome. Her mouth was firm, her large dark eyes  somewhat imperious, and on the whole suggested a masculine strain of  determination and thoroughness. She smiled in a motherly way at her visitor&rsquo;s  compliment, for she was fond of Dick after a sisterly fashion.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Camouflage  again,&rdquo; she said, with a broad smile, showing brilliantly white teeth. &ldquo;All my  goods are in the shop window, and I have to make a show to keep my end up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whatever  made you take up the detective business, Jossy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Needs  must when a certain gentleman drives,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Tremby, lighting a  cigarette and passing along her case to Dick. &ldquo;Billy chucked away all our coin  in silly speculations, and then died of a broken heart, poor chap! I had the  choice of going on the stage, of being a companion, of entering a stuffy city  office, and several other chances. Nothing doing, Dicky.&rdquo; She leaned back and  crossed her legs in quite a gentlemanly way. &ldquo;All too dull and much too  uncertain. Then I met a Secret Service man, who suggested the detective  business, and gave me several tips. I jumped at the opportunity and have done  fairly well for the last few years. But&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Tremby sighed&mdash;&rdquo;nothing likely to  make me famous has come my way. I want to make a splash, and get my name in the  mouth of the public. But all this is egotism,&rdquo; she finished. &ldquo;Tell me about  yourself, your adventures, your success.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  blew rings of smoke, and laughed. &ldquo;My failure, you should say. You know the  pater died.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby nodded sadly. &ldquo;Speculated like Billy did; broke his heart also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Well, he left me without a cent, and I made no money in Africa. So home I came,  and with a caravan left me by a gipsy whose life I saved&mdash;that is, I saved his  mother from being drowned, to be precise&mdash;I have been travelling the country in  a caravan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a caravan,&rdquo; Mrs. Tremby sat up and threw away her half-smoked cigarette,  somewhat excited. &ldquo;Now I remember. Deuce take me, how could I have forgotten!  You are the Richard Lawson of the Caravan Crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh  the London papers call it that, do they?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Dicky, you don&rsquo;t mean to say that you have come here to ask me to take a hand  in clearing up the business?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I do. Now is your chance to make a splash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think so.&rdquo; The lady was tremendously excited, and shuffled the papers on  the table before her into some sort of order. &ldquo;My dear boy, tell me all about  the business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you have read everything in the newspapers,&rdquo; protested Dick, feeling as if she  had taken him by the throat with her strenuous interest.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  read what the newspapers chose to say,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Tremby. &ldquo;It is very  interesting to note how much they don&rsquo;t say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  now, Dicky, there&rsquo;s a heap left unsaid. I want you to say it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I gave my evidence at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Tremby sarcastically, &ldquo;and very guarded evidence it was, my  dear boy. You were alone in that wood, and I&rsquo;ll bet you saw much more than you  let out to the coroner and jury.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  was startled by her feminine intuition. &ldquo;But I say&mdash;&rdquo; He hesitated.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  now,&rdquo; observed the lady abruptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give you a lead. I know Audrey Hamber.  Yes. We were at school together. I am eight-and-twenty; she is twenty-five, two  years older than that delicate brother of hers.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you&mdash;you like her?&rdquo; Dick bent forward eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo;  Jossy bent forward also and grinned, if a knowing smile from a beautiful woman  can merit such a word being used. &ldquo;You are in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am,&rdquo; finished Dick, promptly. &ldquo;Head over ears!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  And you only saw her at the inquest,&rdquo; mused Mrs. Tremby, artfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&mdash;that is&mdash;you see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t see; but I guess a lot. Seeing Audrey at the inquest would not make you  fall in love with her. You have met her; you have spoken to her. Oh, I know  what a fascinating little wretch Audrey is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  isn&rsquo;t a wretch; she&rsquo;s a darling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby lifted her handsome eyebrows. &ldquo;As bad as that. Well, tell me what she  said to you in the wood, and how she came to be there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never said she was in the wood. That&rsquo;s guesswork on your part.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pure  guesswork,&rdquo; assented Mrs. Tremby, agreeably; &ldquo;but you may as well tell me what  she said.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  still hesitated. Her uncanny hitting of the bull&rsquo;s-eye amazed him beyond  description. And once she got into her head what she had got, he knew enough of  the tenacity of the feminine nature to be sure that she would follow up her  guess&mdash;if guess it was&mdash;by making certain that she was right.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have seen Audrey,&rdquo; declared Dick, nervously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is in Paris. The &lsquo;Morning Post&rsquo; said that she went there with her brother  immediately after the funeral.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  without seeing me,&rdquo; muttered Lawson, more to himself than to the other.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should she see you, unless you were friends?&mdash;and that you could not be if you  only saw her at the inquest. It won&rsquo;t do, Dicky, old son. If you want your  mother to pull you through you must own up.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hang  it, Jossy,&rdquo; fumed the young man, &ldquo;you talk as though I had shot that poor  woman. I didn&rsquo;t. I was in another part of the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes, yes!&rdquo; She waved her hand to silence him. &ldquo;I read all that in the  newspapers. You silly fellow, I know you are as innocent as Audrey, or her  delightful brother. All the same, you do know of something which implicates her  and Gerald. Go on! I am her friend, remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jossy!&rdquo;&mdash;he  stared at her admiringly&mdash;&rdquo;you are as clever as the devil.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Scarcely  so successful,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Tremby, selecting a fresh cigarette.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;  He hesitated. &ldquo;I do know much which I kept dark at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  win,&rdquo; said the lady, in quite an American way. &ldquo;H&rsquo;m. You feared to inculpate  Audrey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  confound you!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!  You and your &lsquo;confounding.&rsquo;&ldquo; Jossy was quite good humored. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  speak in confidence, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Honest  Injun. I am not going to publish your information, whatever it may be worth,  and give the tip to the scamp we are after. Can&rsquo;t you see, Dicky, that if I run  this show properly I shall make a record as a detective? Well-born people&mdash;rich  people&mdash;murder&mdash;mystery&mdash;a pretty girl&mdash;all the elements of a detective story are  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you will be able to end the story with my marriage to Audrey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  there&rsquo;s no knowing,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Tremby, tolerantly. &ldquo;I am a born matchmaker,  and it is time you were married. Now then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  took the plunge. After all, he knew he could trust Jossy.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="X"></a>Chapter X</b></h2>
  <p>For  the next fourteen days Lawson was engaged in instructing young ladies how to  ride. He had explained everything to Mrs. Tremby, from the time he arrived at  Sarley Village up to the receipt of the bundle of notes and the anonymous line  of gratitude. Naturally, when he did so, he expected to hear Josey&rsquo;s comments  on his extraordinary story. But she declines to express any opinion, save that  there were wheels within wheels, and she could not see at the moment how these  worked. Bidding Dick to keep silent and possess his soul in patience, she sent  him away from the dingy house in Soho with the assurance that she would deal  with the matter in her own way. &ldquo;And my way, my innocent child,&rdquo; ended Mrs.  Tremby, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t admit of your queering my pitch by shoving your oar in.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>So  while Jossy did magic in her own dark ways, hunting a trail invisible to Dick,  that young gentleman devoted himself to earning honest money as Mr. Tarr&rsquo;s  riding master. He proved to be a great success, his looks and charm of manner  fluttering the hearts of the pupils so greatly that their number increased.  Also, from African experiences, Dick knew his business, and was able to convey  to the most dense the idea of managing a horse and using the animal to the best  advantage. Mr. Tarr, seeing that this skill and popularity added largely to the  number of his clients, even at this early stage, blessed his stars and Mr.  Bollard for having sent him so capable an assistant. Lawson found the life  pleasant, easy, and profitable, but all the time thought of Audrey and the  mystery of Sarley Wood. But for that fly in the ointment he would have been  completely happy.</p>
  <p>It  was at the end of the fourteen days that he again came into contact with Arthur  Randolph. Since the inquest he had not set eyes on that languid young gentleman,  and cared very little if he never saw him again. But early one morning  Randolph, riding in the park, saw Dick with his bevy of girls&mdash;a company of  charming Amazons on horseback. Randolph followed, and when Lawson led his  charges back to Mr. Tarr&rsquo;s mews, and the throng dispersed, found means to renew  his acquaintance with the young riding master. Dick emerged from the mews to  come face to face with Randolph in a irreproachable riding kit and mounted on a  remarkably fine blood horse. &ldquo;How do you do, Lawson?&rdquo; said Randolph, bringing  his animal up to the kerbstone.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Dick lifted his eye carelessly. &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; and, wondering why the man  should greet him, he said no more, wishing to gain information.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  have not met since that time in Lady Hamber&rsquo;s drawing room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  the inquest on Lady Hamber&rsquo;s body,&rdquo; corrected Lawson, coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  we didn&rsquo;t meet then?&rdquo; smiled Randolph. &ldquo;We were only in the same room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  matter?&rdquo; said Dick, with a shrug, and still watchful.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no matter at all,&rdquo; replied the man on the horse, carelessly. &ldquo;Only it is odd we  should meet again so soon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think so, seeing that you followed me here,&rdquo; observed Dick coldly, for  Randolph was a kind of man about town he did not admire.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did so to ask if you had found out anything about Lady Hamber&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I find out anything? I gave my evidence at the inquest, as you did, and  there the matter ended.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  me, Mr. Lawson, not for you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;  Dick looked an enquiry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw your friend Mrs. Tremby,&rdquo; said Randolph meaningly. &ldquo;She called on me to  hear what I had to say, and I gathered&mdash;indirectly, of course&mdash;that you had  engaged her to deal with the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have. It is necessary that Lady Hamber&rsquo;s assassin should be captured and  punished.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t find that easy,&rdquo; said Randolph, and his smile disappeared.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t expect to find it easy; nor does Mrs. Tremby, who understands things of  this kind. All the same, I mean to get at the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  never will,&rdquo; the other assured him, and spoke emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you say that so positively?&rdquo; Dick put this leading question bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear fellow, look at the difficulties. Lady Hamber goes into a wood at a late  hour; no one knows why. She is shot in that wood; no one knows who by. The  revolver with which she was shot cannot be found. The man who used it has  disappeared, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you know that the shot was fired by a man?&rdquo; interrupted the other.</p>
  <p>Randolph&rsquo;s  eyes glittered eagerly. &ldquo;Have you any reason to believe that a woman used the  revolver?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  at present. But&mdash;&rdquo; Lawson purposely left his sentence unfinished so as to learn  if Randolph dreaded hearing Audrey&rsquo;s name. Certainly he could not have known  that Audrey had visited the wood; but the eager look in his eyes seemed to hint  that he guessed she might have done so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  what?&rdquo; enquired Randolph, and now indolently, more on his guard.</p>
  <p>Dick  shrugged his shoulders again. &ldquo;Nothing! I don&rsquo;t know if it was a man or a woman  who shot Lady Hamber. I know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you were in the wood all the time;&rdquo; the remark was made significantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  satisfied the coroner and jury with regard to my innocence, Mr. Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  my dear chap&rdquo;&mdash;the tone of the other was quite cordial as he gathered up his  reins. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean for one moment that you had anything to do with the  matter. I only wondered if, being in the wood, you might not have some kind of&mdash;er&mdash;suspicion,  let us say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have not,&rdquo; declared Lawson bluntly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well; it&rsquo;s a pity. If I can do anything to help&mdash;for Lady Hamber was a dear  friend of mine&mdash;let me know what I can do,&rdquo; and with a nod Randolph touched up  his horse and rode away, more languid than ever.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;  commented Dick, looking after, him. &ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  the way to Bloomsbury he asked himself this question, for it seemed queer and  even suspicious that Randolph should thrust himself into the matter at this&mdash;so  to speak&mdash;eleventh hour. Did he know anything? Was he uneasy about anything?  These were puzzling and very pertinent questions, so much so that Dick found no  answer to them when he arrived at his lodgings. Also all idea of trying to do  so vanished when he found Mrs. Tremby waiting.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are late,&rdquo; she said, greeting him gaily in the shabby sitting room. &ldquo;Why, I  have been here quite half an hour, and time means money in my business, my very  unpunctual old dear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was detained by&mdash;&rdquo; Lawson stopped, not wishing to mention Randolph&rsquo;s name, lest  it should lead to discussion and postpone the explanation of his visitor&rsquo;s  errand. &ldquo;Never mind. Why have you come, Jossy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have found out who sent you that money,&rdquo; announced Mrs. Tremby triumphantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  B&rsquo; Jove, you&rsquo;re a marvel, Jossy! And who&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  a bit. I want to explain how I traced the notes.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  passed her a cigarette and took one himself. When they lighted up he looked  enquiringly at Jossy, who was quite willing to afford him details.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  took the notes to the bank,&rdquo; she said, leaning her elbows on the table and  speaking with much deliberation. &ldquo;Threadneedle street, you know. I believed  that they would keep the numbers and might know who had cashed the cheque for  the five hundred. In one way and another&mdash;no need to go into details, Dicky, as  I see you are on tenterhooks&mdash;I learnt that those fifty-pound notes&mdash;the whole  ten of them&mdash;were paid across the counter to&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped with an exasperating  smile.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on! Go on!&rdquo; commanded Lawson impatiently. &ldquo;Why stop?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  want you to guess.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silly  cuckoo you are, Jossy!&rdquo; snapped Dick, still impatient. &ldquo;Not Audrey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not. The queen can do no wrong.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gerald  Hamber&mdash;her brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much. He is in Paris.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick,  remembering his late meeting, started. &ldquo;Randolph?&rdquo; he asked quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  my son. Mr. Oliver Bollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XI"></a>Chapter XI</b></h2>
  <p>Half  an hour later Lawson was on his way to the city to a taxi. The name revealed by  Mrs. Tremby as that of the man who had sent the money startled him not a  little, as it was the very last one he expected to hear. Jossy had her views  about the matter, and Dick had his; yet, strange to say, the two did not  exchange views. The lady gave her reason for such reticence on her part in her  own bluff, masculine way. &ldquo;Before I tell you my opinion, Dicky; go and see Mr.  Bollard, and ask questions.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  may refuse to answer them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hardly,  seeing what a dubious position he stands in by this secretive action, my dear  boy. What do you think?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall follow your example, Jossy, and let you know that after I have seen  Bollard.&rdquo; He paused and nodded reflectively. &ldquo;But he sent these notes for a  very good reason.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  sent them as a bribe,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Tremby, preparing to go, &ldquo;and if the  reason is a good one there was no need for secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that,&rdquo; retorted Lawson, dryly. &ldquo;Anyhow, there you are, and  there I am. I can&rsquo;t say more at present.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  certainly can&rsquo;t say less. Good bye, you close old oyster.&rdquo; At the door she  halted and laughed. &ldquo;I have another string to my bow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  stared and became incautious. &ldquo;Randolph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  hum!&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby, and, with a most unladylike wink, disappeared.</p>
  <p>Thinking  how exasperating she was with her saying just enough to make him wish to hear  more, Lawson rapidly changed his clothes. Having got rid of his professional  riding kit, he put on his serge suit and went out to hail the first taxi he  saw. While the vehicle dodged the crowded traffic and buzzed towards Ludgate,  Dick reflected over Jossy&rsquo;s discovery.</p>
  <p>In  spite of the doubt he had expressed to Mrs. Tremby, he felt tolerably confident  that Bollard would own up. Also he was certain that the reason Bollard would  give was one which had suggested itself to him the moment he had heard the  name. However, it was useless to consider what the stockbroker would or would  not say, when all would be explained within the next quarter of an hour. So  Lawson thought more of his meeting with Randolph than of the coming interview,  and wondered why the man had so pointedly sought him out. Only when he alighted  before Bollard&rsquo;s dingy office did he remember his errand. The bulky parcel of  notes in his breast pocket, which Jossy had restored to him, brought the  immediate business of the moment into his mind.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  again, young Lawson!&rdquo; roared the stockbroker, who had ordered his visitor to be  shown in immediately to the inner office. &ldquo;What now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have come to tell you that I am getting on all right with Tarr, and that the  situation is tophole,&rdquo; said Dick, avoiding an immediate explanation.</p>
  <p>Bollard  shrugged his massive shoulders. &ldquo;You seem to be in a great hurry about it.  Quite unnecessary, I assure you, young Lawson. Tarr came a few days ago to  thank me for having picked up a parcel for him. Have a cigar!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  prefer a cigarette. Thanks!&rdquo; Dick selected one from the box pushed towards him  and struck a match. &ldquo;And&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  I thought there was an &lsquo;and,&rsquo;&ldquo; said Mr. Bollard, coolly. &ldquo;It is usually a &lsquo;but.&rsquo;  Well, what have you really and truly come to see me about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to restore these.&rdquo; Lawson fished out the parcel of notes and placed them,  uncovered, on the writing table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money!&rdquo;  Bollard raised his thick eyebrows, but otherwise was wholly unconcerned. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  meant well in sending them, but I don&rsquo;t require such a bribe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bribe?&rdquo;  Bollard&rsquo;s face grew dark, and his manner became stiff. &ldquo;What do you mean, Mr.  Lawson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think you can guess!&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s tone was dry, but not unfriendly. &ldquo;But I see no  reason why the five hundred pounds should have been sent anonymously.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  fenced. &ldquo;You might make yourself clearer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  prefer the explanation to come from you,&rdquo; said Lawson politely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have none to give,&rdquo; was the stiff reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I think you have. A bit of an insult to me&mdash;what?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t see the insult.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  Dick seized on the half admission. &ldquo;Then you do know something about the  matter?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  fenced again. &ldquo;Why do you think that I sent you five hundred pounds?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think. I know.&rdquo; And Dick related Jossy&rsquo;s visit to the Bank of England and  the tracing of the notes by their numbers.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  clever of your lady friend,&rdquo; said the stockbroker, unmoved. &ldquo;She ought to  succeed in her profession. Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am waiting to hear what you have to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  told me so before.&rdquo; Bollard threw himself back in his chair and put his thumbs  in the armholes of his white waistcoat. &ldquo;Let us make the position as plain as  as possible. You say&mdash;on the evidence of Mrs. Tremby&mdash;that I sent you these  notes. Why should I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is where the insult I spoke of comes in. I require no bribe to keep silent, Mr.  Bollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silent  about what?&rdquo; enquired the other, doggedly obstinate in keeping his cards  hidden.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  Audrey Hamber&rsquo;s visit to the glade on the night when her stepmother was  murdered. Come now, Mr. Bollard, I guessed long ago from your attitude towards  me that you knew&mdash;that she told you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  got you the situation with Tarr out of respect to the memory of your late  father, who was my dear friend.&rdquo; observed Bollard irrelevantly, or apparently  so.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you say!&rdquo; Dick wondered why the man fenced so persistently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  And I say that I tried to get you a situation with Lady Hamber, as her bailiff,  before she was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  you did. I take back my hint of bribery, although it was needless for you to  send me this money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  abandoned his defiant attitude and leaned forward, looking somewhat old and  worn. &ldquo;I wanted to help you, young Lawson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have done so, and I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t want thanks. What you have done for Audrey is worth much more than the  situation with Tarr and that money.&rdquo; He glanced at the banknotes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Dick heaved a sigh of relief that they had come to grips at last, &ldquo;so you do  know of that visit to the glade?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  You were clever to guess that I possessed such knowledge.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  it was natural that I should guess. I knew that Miss Hamber would turn to you  for assistance in her new trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  new trouble?&rdquo; Bollard looked up anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  On the night she came to the glade she was going to you at Sarley Grange for  your help. What her trouble was then I don&rsquo;t know. But the death of her  stepmother in the wood is the new trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  nodded. &ldquo;Both troubles are one,&rdquo; he said heavily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you know why Lady Hamber was murdered?&rdquo; Dick looked aghast.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No;  I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said the stockbroker doggedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how can the two troubles be one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  this way. Audrey quarrelled with her stepmother, who was a most impossible and  tyrannical woman, and so left Sarley Court on the spur of the moment to come to  me. Lady Hamber, afraid of what would come of my supporting my niece against  her, followed to stop her. So out of the old trouble rose the new one. You see?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see!&rdquo; Dick nodded. &ldquo;What was the quarrel about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  hesitated. &ldquo;Well, you know so much that I may as well tell you more, especially  as you have befriended my niece. Lady Hamber was anxious that the girl should  marry Arthur Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Dick winced. He hated the idea of Audrey becoming the wife of such a wastrel as  he was tolerably sure the man would turn out to be.</p>
  <p>The  stockbroker guessed his thoughts.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  needn&rsquo;t be afraid, young Lawson,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Audrey dislikes the man,  and it was because she refused to marry him that the quarrel took place. It  reached such proportions that my niece&mdash;always impetuous&mdash;determined to rush over  to me immediately, and ask for my interference. So now you know why she was  wandering about in so unsuitable a dress for a country walk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lady  Hamber did follow her, then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must have done so, seeing that her body was found in your caravan by you; but,&rdquo;  added Bollard, enquiringly, &ldquo;how did Selwin find it lying on the path?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  placed it there, so as to avert suspicion from myself,&rdquo; explained the other,  bluntly. &ldquo;You can guess that I was in a quandary.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Very wise of you to act as you did,&rdquo; said Bollard, approvingly. &ldquo;But you can  imagine why Lady Hamber followed, it was to prevent Audrey from bringing me  into the matter. Lady Hamber,&rdquo; finished the man, grimly, &ldquo;had a wholesome fear  of me, since she knew I disapproved of her doings.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Precisely.  I understand. And she let my horse loose, no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  Audrey thinks; so I believe. She must have followed on immediately after  Randolph and the butler left the drawing room, and undoubtedly overheard the  conversation about the sprained ankle. Knowing that my niece could not walk to  Sarley Grange, she&mdash;Lady Hamber&mdash;must have slipped the halter from the horse to  prevent you from taking Audrey over in your caravan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Plain  as day,&rdquo; said Dick, absently. Then added, alertly; &ldquo;what took place while I was  hunting after the horse?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  hesitated for the second time. &ldquo;I shall leave my niece to explain all that,&rdquo; he  remarked after a pause. &ldquo;You see, young Lawson, she swore me to silence, and  only your discovery that I had sent you the money has forced me to break my  silence. You can guess that I wish to say as little as possible.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  a way I do, Mr. Bollard. But why there should be anything withheld from me,  seeing that I am so deep in the confidence of your niece, I do not understand.  Nor do I understand why Miss Hamber refused to meet me and explain matters  before she left for the Continent with her brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was unstrung and upset,&rdquo; explained the other, earnestly, &ldquo;and could not bring  herself at the moment, to repeat to you what she told me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  what she told you throw any light on the darkness?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  does not reveal the name of the person who murdered Lady Hamber, or why Lady  Hamber was shot,&rdquo; said Bollard, bluntly. &ldquo;So far as that goes, my niece is as  much in the dark as you are, or I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why should she refuse to meet me?&rdquo; persisted Lawson, dubiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have told you, so far as I am able to tell. Who can account for the whims of a  woman? Anyhow, her very leaving without an explanation shows that she trusts  you not to give her away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought she was shielding someone.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whom  did you think she was shielding?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Her  brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo;  Bollard laughed in his big, jovial manner. &ldquo;Gerald was in bed all the time,  more or less of a wreck with his nerves. He has lost much of his memory, poor  chap, because of a motor accident. Audrey is shielding no one. But I shall  leave her to explain things. Meanwhile, as you won&rsquo;t allow me to be your  banker, can&rsquo;t I help you in other ways?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have got me this situation, which suits me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I want to give you something to show my gratitude,&rdquo; urged Bollard.</p>
  <p>Lawson  halted at the door and half-turned. &ldquo;When the time comes and this mystery is  solved, you can give me something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  all my heart.&rdquo; was the eager answer. &ldquo;And that is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  hand of your niece in marriage,&rdquo; said Dick briskly, and disappeared.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XII"></a>Chapter XII</b></h2>
  <p>After  Lawson left the city he drove to Soho to report the result of his interview  with Bollard to Mrs. Tremby. To his surprise the door of her office was locked,  and a paper pinned thereto informed him and all callers that she would not  return for five or six days. The young man was annoyed, since it seemed to him  that it was unbusinesslike of Jossy to leave him in the lurch at the moment.  However, there was nothing to be done at the moment by word of mouth, so he  went back to his lodgings and wrote an explanatory letter. This he posted to  the Soho address. thinking that he was something of an ass to do so, seeing  that she was not there and would not be there for at least a week.</p>
  <p>To  his surprise once more&mdash;the first one having been when he discovered her absence&mdash;he  received an answer by next day&rsquo;s evening post. Mrs. Tremby had read his  statement concerning his visit to Bollard, and thanked him for having sent it  so promptly. She added that, for reasons connected with the case in hand, which  would take too long to explain by letter, she was obliged to go out of town.  Dick wondered if she meant to make enquiries about the matter in Sarley  Village, and had half a mind to follow her there, if, indeed, that was the goal  of her journey. But all conjecture and decision to pursue was swept aside when  he read the postscript to her original epistle. Women&rsquo;s postscripts are always  significant, since a woman&rsquo;s last word usually means much more than dozens of  the preceding ones. But this particular one puzzled the young man greatly,  since it appeared to have nothing to do with anything in the letter. &ldquo;Have you  a dress suit?&rdquo; wrote Jossy, in her large masculine caligraphy. &ldquo;If not, get one&mdash;the  smartest your means will allow.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  what the dickens is she talking about clothes for?&rdquo; questioned Lawson, raising  his eyebrows and wondering what was the secret of this Sphinx. &ldquo;I fail to see  what she has to do with my wardrobe. Dashed nonsense&mdash;fiddling while Rome is  burning. Hang all women&mdash;excepting one, of course!&rdquo; And in a fit of petish anger  he tore the silly letter into small bits.</p>
  <p>But  during the next day or so he went about his business with that silly letter  tormenting his mind. After all, Jossy was as clever as a monkey, and&mdash;in his  experience&mdash;had never suggested this or that without some good reason, not  always apparent at the moment. What this one might be for&mdash;chattering about  dress clothes Dick could not guess, and fought for many exasperating hours  against adopting the suggestion.</p>
  <p align="center">* * * * * * *</p>
  <p>The  mirror into which Dick was looking to settle his white tie, gave no answer,  only showing the gazer his handsome, cross face. The sight made the wise young  gentleman smooth his wrinkles, and rid himself of his frown, for it would never  do to let Jossy suspect that she had ruffled his temper. It was a very smiling,  agreeable person who greeted Mrs. Tremby when she swept into the shabby siting  room on the stroke of nine. Jossy was in her warpaint also, gorgeous in a  sumptuous gown of amber satin, which suited her dark beauty. She looked as  stately as the Queen of Sheba, and her dress sparkled with jewels, as did her  eyes with good humor. She was undoubtedly pleased that Dick had obeyed her, and  admired his handsome, well-bred looks. &ldquo;You are now a civilised being, old  chap,&rdquo; said Jossy, nodding her satisfaction. &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you kick a bit when you  read my P.S.?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear no,&rdquo; said Dick untruthfully, and determined not to give the lady any  opportunity of triumphing. &ldquo;You are in charge of the case, so I obeyed orders.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t think,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Tremby, sarcastically. &ldquo;You always like to be  top-dog, Dicky, and I bet you swore yourself silly over my being silly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I did think you were silly,&rdquo; confessed Lawson, with a shrug, &ldquo;but thinking that  there might be method in your silliness, I&mdash;well, here you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Here I am,&rdquo; said Jossy, taking his words in another sense, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t you think  I am wearing well. Where are your compliments?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jossy,  darling, you look like Solomon-in-all-his-glory, and if I weren&rsquo;t in love with  Audrey I should certainly ask you to marry me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you certainly shouldn&rsquo;t be accepted. You always did have the mere of a German  super-man, Dicky. Now we&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  where?&rdquo; Lawson got between her and the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  I am taking you to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  know all about it when you get there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  frowned, and still prevented her from leaving the room, although Mrs. Tremby,  reminded him that the register of a waiting taxi was ticking up an increasingly  large fare every minute. &ldquo;Hang the taxi,&rdquo; he said, sharply. &ldquo;Why do you indulge  in all this mystery?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is my way of doing things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is an infernally unpleasant way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Now,  look here Richard Maxwell George Henty Lawson, you&rsquo;ve got to let me run this  show in my own way. Only by allowing me to do so can I bring things to a  successful issue. And don&rsquo;t swear in the presence of a lady, you civilised  ruffian of the back blocks.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t swear.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said &lsquo;hang,&rsquo; likewise &lsquo;infernally.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Call  that swearing? Why, I could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am sure you could,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Tremby hastily. &ldquo;Dicky, don&rsquo;t be several  kinds of ass. I know what I am doing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  do, and that is what I want to know also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tiresome  person!&rdquo; Jossy resumed her seat. &ldquo;I have been attending to the case for the  last seven days.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t you write me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was no use my wasting stamps when I had nothing to report.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Have  you anything to report now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll  see when I take you to the place I am taking you to,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby,  mysteriously. &ldquo;But I can tell you this much, Dicky&mdash;I have been following that  Randolph person.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;  Lawson became quite eager. &ldquo;Do you think he knows anything?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am quite sure he does. Didn&rsquo;t Bollard talk about him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Only  so much as I reported in my letter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby reflected. &ldquo;That the quarrel between Audrey and her stepmother was on  account of a possible marriage with Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can leave out possible,&rdquo; said Dick coolly. &ldquo;Audrey belongs to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  many a slip,&rdquo; quoted Jossy, and rose impatiently, gathering her cloak of claret  colored velvet round her ample figure. &ldquo;Come! I can explain myself better in  the taxi.&rdquo; And without further words she left the room.</p>
  <p>Dick  followed, wondering why she behaved so mysteriously. It was plain that she had  a plan. But what was that plan? When he joined her in the taxi she had already  directed the chauffeur where to go; so he was still ignorant of his  destination. As to her promised explanations, these were mere scraps and vague  hints.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you meet Randolph, don&rsquo;t let him think that you are suspicious,&rdquo; warned Mrs.  Tremby as they drove through the well-lighted streets.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t. Am I likely to meet him?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not impossible,&rdquo; rejoined Jossey, dryly, and relapsed into silence. Not another  word would she say, and Dick felt inclined to shake her into speech.</p>
  <p>In  due time the taxi turned into Park lane and stopped before a red pathway  leading under a striped awning up to an hospitable open door. Dick paid the  chauffeur, and followed his guide, greatly bewildered. She led him up a wide  staircase smothered in flowers, and presented him as her dear friend to a  smiling hostess, who welcomed him affably. Afterwards, with Jossy on his arm,  Dick moved into a vast and sumptuous drawing room, which opened out into an  equally sumptuous ballroom.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have brought you here,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby, impressively whispering, &ldquo;to see  someone who knows the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Where  is the someone?&rdquo; Lawson stared at the rainbow colored crowd of dancers swaying  to lively music like a bed of tulips in a summer breeze.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yonder.&rdquo;  Mrs. Tremby waved her fan towards the left. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t faint, old son.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  wholly unprepared, very nearly did. Amidst the merry dancers, standing beside  Randolph and talking gaily, he beheld&mdash;Audrey Hamber!</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  knows everything,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Tremby significantly. &ldquo;It is your business to  learn everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIII"></a>Chapter XIII</b></h2>
  <p>Only  for a moment did Dick gain a glimpse of the girl he loved, talking brightly  with the man he hated. The next moment Jossy drew him back into the multitude  of guests. He tried to break away from her, to struggle towards Miss Hamber,  but his arm was firmly held and shaken gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be silly, you hot-head!&rdquo; breathed Mrs. Tremby, half amused, half angry. &ldquo;We are  not here for enjoyment, but on business. Randolph must not see you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not, hang him?&rdquo; demanded Lawson, chafing under restraint.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  he will make it his business to prevent you from having a quiet talk with  Audrey,&rdquo; she said, sharply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be sorry if you don&rsquo;t allow me to arrange  matters in my own way.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are so confoundedly mysterious,&rdquo; muttered the young man, irritably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have to handle this thing with the gloves on, Dicky. Come and sit down. I can  answer your questions now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you know that Audrey was to be here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  thought she was in Paris, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was in Paris, and returned two days ago. I brought her back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you have seen her; you have spoken to her,&rdquo; said Dick, breathlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  much,&rdquo; replied Jossy, deliberately. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to let her know that I am  professionally engaged in this Sarley Wood case. But Lady Heston, who gives  this ball is an old friend of mine. She knows Audrey also&mdash;we were all three at  school together&mdash;so I asked her to send an invitation to Paris and insist that  Audrey should come over. You see she has come, but is quite unaware that I  schemed for her to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!  And she doesn&rsquo;t know that I am here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course not. I want you to take her by surprise and startle her into a  confession. I induced Lady Heston to ask Randolph also.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you, when you know that I detest the man?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  boy, you must put your likes and dislikes aside for the moment. So far as  Randolph is concerned, I like him as little as you do. He was always a wrong &lsquo;un,  and Bill, my late lamented, had more to do with him than I approved of. But I  wished him to meet Audrey, so that I might see them together and learn what  terms they are on with one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  agreeable terms, if one can judge,&rdquo; growled Lawson, bitterly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!  but one can&rsquo;t always judge,&rdquo; retorted Jossy, wisely. &ldquo;I am perfectly sure that  Audrey fears the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should she fear him?&rdquo; Dick bristled and scowled.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what I wish to find out&mdash;what you must learn. I told you I have been  following Randolph for the last six or seven days. I learn that he is  desperately hard up; that he was very thick with Lady Hamber; that he wished  Audrey to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bollard  said as much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  learnt what I tell you from Bollard and the information suggested to me the  idea of bringing Audrey and Randolph together.&rdquo; Mrs. Jossy paused, and added,  musingly, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if Gerald is on Randolph&rsquo;s side.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  sat up alertly. &ldquo;Why should he be?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  they are friends&mdash;great friends. Both were in Africa two years ago on a hunting  trip, and got to know one another intimately. This being so, it is just  possible that Gerald may favor his friend as Audrey&rsquo;s husband. Rotten if he  does, as Randolph is only after her money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  she money?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Three  thousand a year under her father&rsquo;s will. Gerald has the estate and five  thousand per annum. And as Lady Hamber only had a life interest in the property  I expect that boy is now richer than ever. He is a nice boy,&rdquo; Jossy sighed. &ldquo;I  saw a lot of him when Audrey and I were school friends&rdquo;&mdash;she shook herself to  banish sentiment. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are wonderful, Jossy. If you can introduce me to Miss Hamber I daresay I can  learn much. But,&rdquo; Dick hesitated, &ldquo;you suggest that she knows everything. I don&rsquo;t  believe that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  think, Dicky. While you were hunting that horse the shot was fired. Audrey was  in the caravan, yet when you returned she had disappeared and the body of Lady  Hamber was in the bed she had occupied. It is impossible than all that could  have happened without her knowing the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  may know a lot,&rdquo; said Lawson, doggedly defending the girl, &ldquo;but I am sure she  is ignorant of the man&rsquo;s name who shot her step-mother. If she knew it she  would have told at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby shook her head. &ldquo;Audrey had no love for her step-mother. Everyone knew  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Still,  I don&rsquo;t think she would keep the name of the man who murdered her step-mother  quiet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might want to shield the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  winced. The idea had occurred to him more than once. &ldquo;Unless it was her  brother, there is no one I can think of whom she would shield.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Gerald wasn&rsquo;t in the business. You remember you saw him yourself in bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I don&rsquo;t think he had anything to do with the matter,&rdquo; Dick reflected. Then he  winced again. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose that she is shielding Randolph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t know. She might be&mdash;not from love. But Randolph has some hold over her. I  gathered here and there&mdash;society gossip and scandal, you know&mdash;that she tolerated  him dangling after her and paying her lover-like attentions. And then he was  staying at Sarley Court when the crime was committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  the guest of Lady Hamber, I take it, since she was mistress there?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby nodded and stood up. &ldquo;Yes. Lady Hamber was keen on the marriage, and&mdash;as  we learnt from Bollard&mdash;that caused the row which sent Audrey into the wood on  her way to Sarley Grange.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  you don&rsquo;t think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear Dick, I don&rsquo;t know what to think. It&rsquo;s all a muddle, but I am now giving  you an opportunity of learning something likely to dispose of the difficulties.  Audrey would tell me nothing, since she thinks I know nothing. But you are  partly in her confidence because of the adventure in the wood, so you can force  her to tell everything. Then&rdquo;&mdash;Jossy spoke significantly and moved out of the  alcove. &ldquo;Stay here, Dicky, and I shall send Audrey to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  followed her out with an alarmed look. &ldquo;She won&rsquo;t come if she knows that I am  here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  won&rsquo;t know. I shall merely tell her that an old friend wants to see her. No,  Dicky, don&rsquo;t contradict. I am in charge of this business. How often have I to  tell you that? Get back and sit tight, old bean.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby pushed him back through the screen of flowers into the alcove and swept  majestically down the brilliantly lighted corridor. Lawson sat down on the  sofa, nervously anticipating the coming of the girl. He fervently hoped that no  other person would stumble upon the cosy corner, as it was necessary for  himself and Audrey to be alone for their very important conversation. But  either from sheer luck or Jossy&rsquo;s managements&mdash;he did not know what influence  she had in this house&mdash;no one came to the alcove, although several couples  passed along at intervals. Then he heard the sound of two murmuring voices in  the distance, which, when they came nearer, proved to be those of Mrs. Tremby  and Miss Hamber. It was the former who was speaking when the pair halted before  the alcove. &ldquo;It is an old friend who wishes to see you, dear,&rdquo; said Jossy  amiably. &ldquo;Go in and you will have the surprise of your life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;An  old friend,&rdquo; repeated Audrey wonderingly. &ldquo;I have no old friends,&rdquo; she said  with a sigh; &ldquo;many acquaintances but no real friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think you will find one in there,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby, and guided the girl  towards the screen of flowers. &ldquo;I shall return in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But,  Jossy&mdash;&rdquo; Audrey broke off, as her companion was now moving some distance away  down the corridor. For a moment she hesitated, not approving of the mystery in  which she seemed to be involved. Then curiosity got the better of prudence, and  she stepped into the alcove, to find herself face to face with a tall man who  had arisen when she entered. In the dim light she could not recognise him, and  laughed. nervously. &ldquo;Mrs. Tremby said that I would find an old friend here,&rdquo;  she remarked after an awkward pause.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope you will think so, Miss Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;  With a little cry she stepped back, recognising his voice, yet not quite  trusting her hearing, &ldquo;It surely, can&rsquo;t be&mdash;you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is me&mdash;if you mean Richard Lawson,&rdquo; said the young man gravely.</p>
  <p>He  had stepped forward as she stepped back, and a ray of light from the corridor  revealed his face plainly. Audrey looked searchingly at him; he just as  searchingly at her. Both were extremely pale. The girl gasped, and strove to  carry off the situation lightly. &ldquo;You had more names than that when we last  met,&rdquo; she stammered, shaking with nervous agitation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Richard  Maxwell George Henry Lawson,&rdquo; said Dick, striving to speak lightly in his turn.  &ldquo;I hope your ankle is better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  you, yes!&rdquo; she answered in low tones. Then she looked down, afterwards looked  up, and spoke desperately. &ldquo;What is the use of our fencing? Why did Mrs. Tremby  bring me here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  meet me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  she knows that we have met before?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  does. Mrs. Tremby is helping me to unravel the skein which the Fates twisted  for us in Sarley Wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know she became a detective,&rdquo; stammered the girl, very pale and nervous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is as a detective that she is assisting me, Miss Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  what a shame! I never thought that Jossy&mdash;I mean Mrs. Tremby&mdash;would trick me like  this!&rdquo; Audrey spoke vehemently and angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  else could she do, since you refused to meet me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not refuse,&rdquo; she denied with a stamp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  in words; but you avoided me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Tears  came into her eyes; but they were tears of anger. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t want to meet you.  There is no reason why you should persecute me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come,  now, that is unjust both to me and to yourself.&rdquo; said Dick, sternly, for he saw  that she required to be dominated. &ldquo;You know well that I have not persecuted  you. I accepted your extraordinary conduct in silence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  Audrey felt shamed and small at the gentle rebuke. &ldquo;I owe you much for your  silence. I take back what I said about persecution; but I don&rsquo;t see what good  can come of our meeting.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do. You must tell me all that took place when I left you in my caravan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey  looked sullen, and sat down on the sofa, doggedly determined to hold her  tongue.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall tell you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  see. You are shielding some one.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  dare you say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  how am I to interpret your silence? Don&rsquo;t answer; I know that you are shielding  your brother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey  sprang to her feet with a cry of alarm. Then, &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; she said, in  choking tones. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to tell you, but it is true.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIV"></a>Chapter XIV</b></h2>
  <p>Immediately  after making her confession Audrey sat down again on the sofa and began to cry  quietly. The tragedy in the wood, the many days of suspense, and now this  meeting with the man she had striven to avoid broke her nerve. She was in a  corner; she was up against it; and knew not what to do, what to say.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gerald  is as innocent as you are.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the deuce,&rdquo; murmured Lawson. Then, passing from the lover to the lawyer, he  proceeded to examine her, and spoke sternly. &ldquo;Then why are you shielding your  brother?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you talk to me in that tone I shan&rsquo;t say a word,&rdquo; she cried, still looking like  a small fury. &ldquo;And I thought you were my friend,&rdquo; she added, again about to  break down.</p>
  <p>Dick  sat beside her and took her hand. &ldquo;I want to be your friend.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey  snatched her hand away. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t; you don&rsquo;t. You have come to get me into  trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  laughed at this feminine way of putting things. &ldquo;So far I have tried to avoid  doing so,&rdquo; he said in a wounded voice&mdash;purposely wounded.</p>
  <p>The  little lady was evidently an April damsel of rain and sunshine, tears and  laughter. She changed again in a moment, and stretched out a timid hand.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are very kind and honorable and good,&rdquo; she said in a meek voice, &ldquo;but you can  guess that I don&rsquo;t mean half I say. I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m&mdash;all broken up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  recaptured the timid hand and patted it consolingly. &ldquo;Poor little girl; I want  to help you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you really and truly mean that?&rdquo; She looked at him hopefully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I do. Had you come to me before you ran away to the Continent I should  have stood by you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  had to run away for Gerald&rsquo;s sake. You know his nerves are all shattered by his  car being overturned, and this dreadful thing has made them worse than ever. He  remembers what took place day and night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought his memory was gone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  no. It is faulty. He remembers some things and not others. But what took place  in the wood&rdquo;&mdash;she shivered and winced&mdash;&rdquo;he remembers only too dearly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did take place?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  I tell you, you will keep it to yourself?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;if  I see it is necessary to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; insisted the girl, tremulously, &ldquo;I daren&rsquo;t risk Gerald getting into  trouble while he is so ill.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  he is innocent he won&rsquo;t get into trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey  shook her head and clasped her hands between her knees, looking down at her  feet. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know. Things look black against him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Tell  me all about it,&rdquo; coaxed Dick, gently. &ldquo;You can trust me, surely, seeing that I  have proved myself worthy of your trust.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know I can.&rdquo; She still hesitated. &ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear,&rdquo;&mdash;he took her hand again&mdash;&rdquo;there must be no &lsquo;but.&rsquo; I must learn all you  know if I am to be of any use in clearing up this business. Yes, and Mrs.  Tremby must know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jossy.  No, no.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  must,&rdquo; said Lawson firmly. &ldquo;She is your friend as I am, and, like myself, is  working in your interest. Come now. Your uncle told me he would leave you to  explain. Yes,&rdquo; in answer to her look of surprise. &ldquo;He sent me five hundred  pounds anonymously, as a reward for my silence. Mrs. Tremby traced the bank  notes to him, and I learn that he knows about your adventure to the wood. He  told me something, but not all. Now you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah,  well,&rdquo; Audrey interrupted him swiftly, having apparently made up her mind on  the instant. &ldquo;I shall trust you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will have no reason to regret doing so,&rdquo; said Dick, and waited for the recital,  rather downcast as she removed her hand from his when she began.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;When  you left me in the caravan,&rdquo; Audrey started abruptly, and plunged straight into  the middle of things, &ldquo;I lay for a time feeling very sick with the pain in my  ankle. Then I heard a shot, close at hand. Wondering what was wrong and  thinking it might be poachers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  didn&rsquo;t guess that Lady Hamber had followed you?&rdquo; he interrupted.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  You see, we had a quarrel about, about&mdash;&rdquo; she hesitated. &ldquo;Well, we had a  quarrel. I had gone up to Gerald&rsquo;s room at half-past eight, and came down again  later when Mr. Randolph went to bed, as I didn&rsquo;t want to see him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can understand that,&rdquo; murmured Dick, recollecting the cause of the quarrel.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did you say?&rdquo; she asked; then without waiting for a reply continued quickly. &ldquo;Lady  Hamber&mdash;she was only my step-mother, you know, and we never got on well together&mdash;insulted  me so grossly that I determined to go over to Uncle Oliver at once. I came to  the wood, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I left you in the caravan where you heard the shot,&rdquo; supplemented Dick with a  nod. &ldquo;I know all the rest. But after you heard the shot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought it was poachers, and lay for some time&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know for how long&mdash;hoping  that you would come back, as I feared lest they should enter the caravan and  find me. Then I grew so nervous that I wished to face the worst to end the  suspense. I crawled to the door and opened it. Some distance away, near your  fire, and not far from the path, I saw a woman lying. Near her stood my  brother, holding a revolver. I was terrified and called out to Gerald.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  hadn&rsquo;t shot her? You are sure he hadn&rsquo;t shot her?&rdquo; asked Dick sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  said Audrey, positively. &ldquo;He came running up to me, and said that, finding I  was not beside him when he woke up, he put on his clothes, and came down to  look for me. He found the drawing-room empty, the window open, and saw Lady  Hamber walking down the terrace steps. Wondering where I was and what she was  doing, he followed. She was some distance ahead of him, and just as he got  through the park gate into the wood he heard the shot. Very much alarmed, he  ran down the path into the glade, and found Lady Hamber lying near the fire, as  I told you. She was dead, and a revolver lay beside her. Gerald had just picked  it up when I called out to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  Gerald heard nothing other than the shot? He saw no one?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  He just heard the shot, and ran down the path to find the dead body and the  revolver. I was afraid, if you came back, that you would think Gerald was  guilty, so I made him carry Lady Hamber&rsquo;s body into the caravan and lay it on  the bed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  might have trusted me,&rdquo; said Dick, reproachfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  could I?&rdquo; she retorted, rather snappishly, &ldquo;when I knew so little about you.&rdquo;  She sighed with relief when she completed her narrative.</p>
  <p>Dick  nodded. &ldquo;I know. Selwin and I found you seated by your brother&rsquo;s bed holding  his hand. Was he alone?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  But I told him to pretend to be asleep, so that I might hold his hand and  excuse myself from rising and coming downstairs.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  feared to show that your ankle was sprained?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  That might have led to awkward explanations, and I had to consider my poor  brother. I was afraid when you entered that you would speak; but after a single  look at you I knew that you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you know?&rdquo; asked Lawson, feeling secretly pleased.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  how does a woman know such things in a man? Instinct, I suppose. And for Gerald&rsquo;s  sake I avoided meeting you, as I knew you would ask questions. But my very  avoidance of you showed that I trusted in your honor.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  your uncle said,&rdquo; murmured the young man. &ldquo;But I was puzzled.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Silly!  Men are so stupid!&rdquo; said Audrey, more April like than ever. &ldquo;That is all, and  you see Gerald is innocent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  he?&rdquo; questioned Lawson, unexpectedly. &ldquo;After all, his memory is faulty, and he  might have unknowingly shot Lady Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Absurd,&rdquo;  said Audrey more calmly than he expected. &ldquo;Gerald had no revolver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo;  Dick reflected, &ldquo;there is something in that. Where is the revolver which he  picked up!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gerald  has it. He carried it home, when he carried me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Does  be know to whom it belongs?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I don&rsquo;t either. But if you will come and see us in Winter square Gerald will  show it to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good.  It will be a useful clue. Have you any idea who shot Lady Hamber?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  the least,&rdquo; said Audrey, frankly. &ldquo;I never liked her, as she was always unkind  and sometimes actively cruel. I daresay I should not be at this ball, seeing  that she was killed only lately; but I can&rsquo;t pretend to be sorry for her, and  lament like a hypocrite. Besides, Lady Heston made a point of my coming here  tonight&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know why?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do,&rdquo; said Dick, coolly. &ldquo;Mrs. Tremby arranged the whole thing, so that we might  meet.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jossy  might have told me,&rdquo; cried Audrey, in angry tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you have come, if she had told you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  might; I might not. Anyhow&mdash;&rdquo; the girl took Dick&rsquo;s hand and shook it&mdash;&rdquo;I am glad  I did come, and forgive Jossy. You are my friend?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Lawson&rsquo;s voice was a little unsteady. &ldquo;Can you doubt it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  after the way you have behaved. And you will discover the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall try to, with the assistance of Mrs. Tremby.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey  nodded in a satisfied way and with evident relief. &ldquo;I want the truth to be discovered  to set Gerald&rsquo;s mind at rest. He lives in terror lest he should be suspected. I  only wish his memory would give way on that point as it has given way on  others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one suspects him,&rdquo; said Dick, in comforting tones. &ldquo;I shall call and see him,  and put his mind at rest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  you only can,&rdquo; sighed Audrey, &ldquo;Oh, dear! how I hate trouble. I have had nothing  else since dad died, what with Lady Hamber&rsquo;s disagreeable behaviour, and now  her death. You are a tower of strength, Mr. Lawson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  hope to prove one. But&rdquo;&mdash;Dick spoke timidly for him&mdash;&rdquo;can&rsquo;t you call me by my&mdash;my  first name?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey  colored and looked embarrassed. &ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; She rose abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because&mdash;because&mdash;oh,  it is no use my beating about the bush&mdash;I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Lawson!&rdquo; She darted towards the screen of flowers, and stood there as if poised  for flight. &ldquo;You&mdash;you mustn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  not?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  I am engaged to marry Mr. Randolph!&rdquo; sighed the girl, and the next instant she  was gone, leaving Dick aghast and speechless.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XV"></a>Chapter XV</b></h2>
  <p>After  Audrey&rsquo;s flight Lawson remained where he was, overwhelmed by the information so  abruptly given. He knew from Mrs. Trembly that Randolph had been paying  attentions to the girl for some time, less for herself than for her money; knew  also that Lady Hamber had favored the match. But the quarrel which had made  Audrey leave the house on the night of the crime arose from her objection to  such a marriage; so it was strange that she should change her mind so  immediately and positively. Also Dick remembered that, according to Jossy, the  girl feared the man. He was puzzled as well as amazed, wondering how the  situation had come about.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby might explain, since she was Audrey&rsquo;s old school friend, and there was a  chance that the two might be confidential. But be this as it may, it was  necessary to hunt out Jossy, and enlighten her about the new and disagreeable  complication. Dick pulled himself together, and left the alcove with the  intention of enlisting his friend&rsquo;s sympathy to bring about the breaking of  this monstrous engagement.</p>
  <p>Having  been launched so suddenly and unexpectedly by Mrs. Tremby into society, Lawson  knew none of the fashionable people present. There were many pretty girls,  smart young men, old dowagers, and antique gentlemen, long past their dancing  days. After silent months in Africa and hand-to-mouth living in the under-world  Lawson was quite bewildered with the light and color and perfume, with the  wines and food, the incessant chattering, and the intoxicating rhythm of the  music. It was years since he had mingled with the social throng, and he felt  singularly isolated, knowing no face, meeting on all sides indifferent glances,  devoid of warmth or recognition. Jossy, in the distance, was dancing with a  golden youth to the strains of the latest waltz&mdash;a very sentimental melody; so  there was no chance of speaking to her at the moment. Audrey could not be seen,  although Dick looked for her everywhere. He was on the point of going back to  his drab-colored lodgings when he heard Randolph&rsquo;s voice at his elbow&mdash;that  languid, irritating, drawling voice, which had so annoyed him in the tragic  drawing room of Sarley Court. Even now the young man frowned when it struck his  ear.</p>
  <p>His  enemy&mdash;Dick quite looked upon the man as such&mdash;stood just behind him, arm-in-arm  with a would-be-young woman all diamonds and bones. That is, she was remarkably  tall, remarkably lean, sparsely clothed, and twinkled like a sunlit sea with  many jewels. This ancient damsel was arrayed in a frock of pale-green chiffon,  which began late and ended early, displaying thin legs and arms, rather pretty  feet, a bust that left much to be desired, and the scrawny neck of a plucked  fowl. It was a painful sight to see this mutton dressed-as-lamb female smiling  and smirking with a man young enough to be her grandson. Randolph, as Dick  observed, was paying great attention to this ruin of what was once a woman, and  listened with flattering attention to her screaming peacock voice. She talked  incessantly on everything and anything, her pale, shallow eyes wandering all  over the place while she chattered. As it happened, they alighted on Dick,  close at hand and a look of genuine surprise crept into them. &ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;  screeched the lady with a gasp.</p>
  <p>Dick  recognised her at once; for, indeed, she was not one to be forgotten, with her  Madge Wildfire looks and ways. &ldquo;How are you, Cousin Esther?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Richard!&rdquo;  screamed Esther, with a coquettish wave of her fan, &ldquo;you wicked boy, to have  dropped just before me like this. I thought you were in Africa shooting  kangaroos&mdash;dear, pretty creatures, such a shame to kill them.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wiped Africa clean of kangaroos,&rdquo; said Lawson, not caring to enlighten her  ignorance, &ldquo;and here I am.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  obvious,&rdquo; giggled the lady, &ldquo;but you always were obvious, you know. Let me  introduce you to Mr. Randolph. Arthur, my cousin, Mr. Lawson&mdash;we were boy and  girl together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Without  showing any merriment at this ridiculous observation Randolph nodded stiffly to  Dick. &ldquo;I have met Mr. Lawson before.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really&mdash;how  odd!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  odd, Miss Spine?&rdquo; said her companion staring at Dick while Dick stared at him,  with mutual dislike.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  it is so strange meeting Richard here, and you knowing him. The world is small,  isn&rsquo;t it? Only the mountains don&rsquo;t meet. And you do look well.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  do you,&rdquo; said Dick, mendaciously, &ldquo;not a day older.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Spine gave a little scream. &ldquo;Oh my dear boy, and I haven&rsquo;t seen you for  centuries. How can you pay such bare-faced compliments?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  compliments, Miss Spine,&rdquo; put in Randolph, gallantly; &ldquo;the truth!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ah  well, I suppose I must believe you. Do come and get me some supper, Richard.  No, don&rsquo;t go Arthur. I want you and my cousin to be friends.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  two men glared at one another over Miss Spine&rsquo;s skinny shoulders as they  escorted her to the supper-room. Here they found a secluded table and attended  to the wants of the flirtatious grandmother. Miss Spine ate and drank largely,  chattering all the time, first to one, then to the other, asking questions  without waiting for replies, and replying to questions which were not asked.  Towards the end of the supper she hit upon a subject which both her companions  wished to avoid. &ldquo;And where did you meet Richard, Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Down  the country,&rdquo; replied Randolph, evasively, and Dick approved of the evasion. He  wished to speak of the crime to Randolph, but not here, or in the disconcerting  presence of Miss Spine.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Down  the country,&rdquo; said the lady, and shivered agreeably. &ldquo;I should think you had  enough of the country, Arthur. Last time you were there it was awful, so you  told me&mdash;Sarley Court&mdash;the murder, you know. Poor Lady Hamber, although I never  admired her, with those trying-to-be-young ways. And that girl&mdash;the  stepdaughter. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t call her pretty, do you, Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  is&mdash;agreeable,&rdquo; said Arthur, cautiously, much to Dick&rsquo;s indignation and  wonderment, since he expected Randolph to praise the girl he was engaged to.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t see it myself,&rdquo; Miss Spine fanned herself violently. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so very pale  and washed out. Perhaps she knows something.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  knows nothing,&rdquo; put in Lawson, fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  me, Richard, don&rsquo;t glare at me. You are just like your poor, dear father, you  know. One couldn&rsquo;t say a thing without his jumping down one&rsquo;s throat. And I don&rsquo;t  see what you know about her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  was one of the witnesses at the inquest,&rdquo; growled the young man, angrily.</p>
  <p>Miss  Spine screamed again, and sat bolt upright. &ldquo;I remember, Lawson! Oh, yes, of  course! You were travelling with a horrid caravan&mdash;so silly for a man of your  birth and position. And you saw nothing, did you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  denied Dick, stolidly, but with his eyes on Randolph, &ldquo;nothing!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  heard something, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Randolph, languidly, and avoiding the  glance with which Lawson strove to fix him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  shot. I told all I had to tell at the inquest.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  interesting,&rdquo; babbled Miss Spine, archly, although there was really no occasion  for archness. &ldquo;Quite a romance. And romances ought to end in marriage. Why,  Richard, since you and that horrid constable found the body of poor, dear, Lady  Hamber&mdash;disagreeable woman&mdash;you should marry the girl.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  may be already engaged,&rdquo; said Dick, still looking at Randolph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Really?  Who to? Oh, Arthur, do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t  heard of anyone,&rdquo; replied Randolph, and this denial puzzled Dick more than  ever. Why was the man lying?</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  of course not. Who would marry her when one doesn&rsquo;t know the real truth of the  matter? She may be keeping something back.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  isn&rsquo;t!&rdquo; denied Dick savagely. &ldquo;You are talking nonsense, Cousin Esther.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  never talk nonsense!&rdquo; retorted the lady, indignant. &ldquo;Do I, Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;  He switched off the conversation to a less dangerous line. &ldquo;Do you know Hamber  Mr. Lawson?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I have never met him. You were hunting with him in Africa. I believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  year or so ago,&rdquo; drawled the other. &ldquo;Who told you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Bollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  really! I didn&rsquo;t know that my doings interested him to such an extent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Spine, finding herself left out of the conversation, hastened to bring herself  into it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dear  fellow, Gerald Hamber; so delicate, and no memory; that horrid motor car upset  with him. He is a great friend of yours, Arthur?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. He saved my life in Africa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Spine gave her usual peacock scream. &ldquo;How thrilling! Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  were in the wilds, and one of the niggers got drunk and went round with an axe  to all the white men. He tackled me when I was unarmed; but Gerald, who was a  little distance off, threw me his revolver, and I managed to pick it up and  shoot the brute just as Gerald let fly at him with a Winchester.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  killed him? How thrilling!&rdquo; cried Miss Spine, clasping her bony hands.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  didn&rsquo;t Hamber use the revolver himself? asked Dick, abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  he might have missed, and I was unarmed,&rdquo; explained Randolph; &ldquo;so in the  excitement of the moment he did what he thought best. I made Gerald give me the  revolver as a keepsake. Hullo! Going?&rdquo; he added, as Dick rose.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I want to get home early and put myself to bed. I rise early, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you rise early?&rdquo; enquired Miss Spine, catching his arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  business. I am a riding master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Dick!  You a riding master?&rdquo; She was shocked, and looked offended.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  Mr. Simon Tarr,&rdquo; said her cousin, gravely. &ldquo;I must earn money somehow, and it&rsquo;s  better than trading round the country with a caravan.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think so. And yet, it isn&rsquo;t a position for you&mdash;the riding master, I  mean. Of course, your poor darling father lost his money, but&mdash;&rdquo; Miss Spine  broke off and looked rather ashamed. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come and see me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t know you wanted to see me&mdash;the black sheep&mdash;the wastrel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  be silly, Richard, you were never the one or the other,&rdquo; said his cousin severely.  &ldquo;We people of good birth must hang together. Come and see me, I am at my house  in Shrewsbury square, Kensington. You know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know. Thank you. I shall call some day.&rdquo; Dick nodded to Randolph and shook  hands with his cousin. &ldquo;Goodbye, Esther.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Au  revoir, you mean,&rdquo; said Miss Spine, lightly, although she felt inwardly greatly  ashamed that she had so neglected her handsome cousin. &ldquo;Remember the address.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Promising  that he would, Lawson left the supper room, glad to get away from Randolph,  whom he disliked more than ever. The tale told by the rascal hinted that he and  Gerald were on the best of terms, which would mean that the boy would probably  support Randolph in his desire to marry Audrey. But why did not the scamp admit  the engagement? Why was he so attentive to Esther Spine, who was the last  person on earth to attract such a sybarite? The young man made sure that  Randolph was playing some deep game, but what it was he could not quite  understand. However, there were more important things to attend to, and he put  Miss Spine and the supper conversation out of his mind. It was necessary to see  Jossy and report to her the interview with Audrey. Just at the door of the  ballroom, Dick found her and touched her shoulder. She turned immediately from  the man she was talking to. &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Come  aside for a moment,&rdquo; murmured Dick, and drew her into a corner. &ldquo;Audrey is  engaged to Randolph,&rdquo; he announced, abruptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never,&rdquo;  cried Mrs. Tremby, in dismay.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  told me herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Jossy reflected for a moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see her, Dick, and let you know the result  tomorrow.&rdquo; Then she went back to her partner, and Lawson went home.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVI"></a>Chapter XVI</b></h2>
  <p>While  engaged in teaching his pupils next morning, Dick thought a great deal about  his meeting with Miss Spine. She was a distant cousin of his father, possessed  of a good income, and a thirst for admiration. Had he not met her thus by  accident, as it were, Dick would never have thought of looking her up, and,  indeed, was not sure that he would trouble to accept her invitation. But on  second thoughts he decided that he would, since it had been given warmly and in  good faith. Miss Spine greatly valued her connection with the Lawsons, slight  as it was, and apparently disliked the idea of having a relative occupying the  lowly position of a riding master. This was probably the case, as Dick decided  when he returned to his lodgings to find a letter from the lady.</p>
  <p>Miss  Spine wrote very amiably, and&mdash;as Lawson confessed&mdash;kindly. She scolded her  cousin for not having come to see her when he returned from Africa, instead of  touring the country in a caravan. She insisted that he should get more  respectable employment than that as the underling of Mr. Tarr, and enclosed a  cheque for one hundred pounds.</p>
  <p>Lawson  laughed when he thought how Dame Fortune was pursuing him with offers of money.  First the five hundred pounds from Bollard, now the one hundred from Miss  Spine. But he felt as little inclined to accept the last as he had been to  accept the first. At the same time, he admitted to himself that it was  wonderful so mean a woman should behave so generously. Of course it was only  Miss Spine&rsquo;s foolish pride which made her open her purse; yet at the back of  this Dick detected a possible sympathy with him in his troubles. He folded up  the cheque and thrust it into his pocket, with the idea of consulting Jossy as  to acceptance or non-acceptance.</p>
  <p>But  where was Jossy? Dick had called at her office in Soho on his way home after  his morning duties had been attended to. She was not in, and a card on the door  notified that she would not return until late in the day. Dick hoped that she  would visit him at his lodgings, and remained at home for some hours in the  hope of seeing her. Still, she did not put in an appearance, and the young man  was sorely perplexed, sorely displeased. Considering how anxious he was to hear  what Audrey had said relative to the engagement, he thought that Mrs. Tremby  might have come immediately. Also he wished to tell her of his meeting with his  cousin; of the conversation at the supper table, and ask what she thought about  Randolph keeping the engagement with Audrey secret. While waiting, he passed an  uncomfortable morning and afternoon, fretting over Jossy and her dilatory ways.</p>
  <p>Then  his patience&mdash;if it could be called so&mdash;was rewarded. At 4 o&rsquo;clock a messenger  boy brought a note from Mrs. Tremby, asking him to be at her office at 5.  Lawson drew a long breath of relief, and lost no time in obeying the summons.  Long before the appointed hour he was climbing the dingy stairs, only to find  the office door still closed. However, as he was to blame and not Jossy, the  young man sat on the top stair and smoked a meditative pipe until the dilatory  lady arrived.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  here you are,&rdquo; he said, when Jossy skipped up the stairs. &ldquo;I have been on the  look-out for you all day. Where have you been?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  your business, young man,&rdquo; said Jossy, slipping her key into the lock. &ldquo;I have  been all over the shop. Bollard&mdash;Audrey&mdash;Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does Audrey say?&rdquo; enquired Dick, eagerly, as he followed her into the luxurious  office&mdash;the pearl of comfort in the bleak misery of the dingy house. &ldquo;Oh, Jossy,  do tell me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you nothing if you don&rsquo;t let me choose my own way of telling,&rdquo; she  snapped, sinking into her desk chair. &ldquo;Do give me a cigarette, old chap. I am dying  of thirst and for want of a smoke.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  passed along a cigarette, and lighted it for her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make you some tea, if  you have the appliances.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the cupboard,&rdquo; Jossy nodded over her shoulder. &ldquo;But can you make tea?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;A  jolly sight better than you,&rdquo; retorted her friend, bringing out a kettle, a  Primus, and various other things. &ldquo;Fancy asking a pioneer if he can make tea!  Where is the water?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  a tap in the outer room.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right  oh! Now sit tight and smoke while I get things ready.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jossy  laughed and blew rings of smoke, watching his deft preparations with amusement  and approval. Dick filled the kettle, lighted the Primus, cut thin slices of  bread and butter, and laid the cloth on a small bamboo table, which he placed  at Mrs. Tremby&rsquo;s elbow. When all was ready he poured out the tea, and fed Jossy  lavishly with cake and the rest of the viands. &ldquo;You are in good training for a  husband Dicky,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby, when her appetite was more or less satisfied.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Audrey&rsquo;s  husband,&rdquo; said Dick, with a nod, as he devoured bread and butter and drank his  tea.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are gone on her, old boy!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gone  on her. How slangy you are, Jossy. I worship her, I adore her. Why, she is the  most glorious&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I know she is,&rdquo; Mrs. Tremby cut short his rhapsody, ruthlessly. &ldquo;I have heard  all that sort of stuff from Billy. But she is engaged to Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  she says, confound him. Why did you look him up?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  ask if it was true. Oh, I know Audrey told you, but she might have said it to  choke you off.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  tosh,&rdquo; burst out Dick, drawing in his long legs and looking furious. &ldquo;I believe  she loves me. So there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jossy  puffed out a cloud of blue smoke from a freshly lighted cigarette. &ldquo;I always  did believe men to be conceited. How do you know she loves you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw it in her eyes. And&mdash;and&mdash;oh, Jossy, don&rsquo;t be a beast. You know we are made  for one another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have some idea that you are. But Randolph. He is engaged; he said so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why is he playing the fool with that silly cousin of mine? Why does he keep the  engagement secret from her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Eh,  what? Your cousin. The Spine woman?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I met her last night at the ball. She was talking to Randolph and spotted me.  Randolph was feeding her vanity kite high, and denied that he had heard  anything about Audrey being engaged.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you, he said so&mdash;he shirked an explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you?&rdquo; Jossy looked anxious.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  said nothing. I lay low, waiting to find out what his game is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  what is his game?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Ask  me another! Unless it is to marry Esther.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if he is engaged to Audrey&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is what I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; Dick paused, then asked: &ldquo;And your opinion?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jossy  waved aside the smoke curling from her cigarette, &ldquo;Tell you what, my son.  Randolph has two strings to his bow. One is Audrey, the other that Spine cousin  of yours. Both are rich. Failing Audrey, he will marry Esther. Seems to me,&rdquo;  mused Mr. Tremby, &ldquo;as if he wasn&rsquo;t very sure of Audrey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  she admitted the engagement herself,&rdquo; argued the disconsolate Lawson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Daresay!  They&rsquo;re engaged right enough. But she doesn&rsquo;t like him. I saw that when she  owned up to me last night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw her again?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;After  you went away from Lady Heston&rsquo;s house I did. She said that she had seen you,  that you had proposed, and that she had choked you off by telling of her  engagement. I asked her if she loved Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Or  me?&rdquo; queried Dick, eagerly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I didn&rsquo;t go so far as that. I asked about Randolph only. She would not say that  she loved him, and, indeed, gave me to understand&mdash;being a woman dealing with a  woman, I read between the lines&mdash;that she feared him. Dicky&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Tremby leaned  forward impressively&mdash;&rdquo;she&rsquo;s been frightened into this engagement. I don&rsquo;t know  in what way, but she doesn&rsquo;t love the man. He can in some way force her into  marrying him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  why is he paying attention to Esther?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  must find that out. Perhaps&mdash;as I suggested&mdash;he is not sure of Audrey, and should  she fail him, will marry your cousin. He&rsquo;s jolly hard up, my boy, and, in some  way, wants to get hold of cash.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  scowled, and clenched his fist, with an intense desire to drive it in his rival&rsquo;s  face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done?&rdquo; he growled, wrathfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  more than what I have done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  that is?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  went to Bollard&rsquo;s city office this morning and told him of my interview with  Audrey and Randolph. Bollard was furious. He detests Randolph, and&mdash;&rdquo; added Mrs.  Tremby, with emphasis, &ldquo;favors you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Favors  me!&rdquo; Dick gasped with excitement.</p>
  <p>Jossy  nodded. &ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re the white boy with him. I believe he wants you to marry  Audrey. Yes! He talked about her being unprotected, and Gerald as not being  able to look after her. And then he said&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  Yes! Yes?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  he would break the engagement with Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good  heavens!&rdquo; Lawson sat back with a gasp. &ldquo;Can he?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know. But after I left him he was going to look up Randolph, and promised to  wire me the result of the interview, I am expecting the telegram every minute.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Scarcely  were the words out of her mouth than a sharp knock came to the outer door.  Guessing in a flash what the knock meant Lawson sprang to his feet and was opening  the door before Jossy could speak. He returned, with a buff-colored envelope. &ldquo;Read!  Read!&rdquo; he commanded, on fire with impatience. Mrs. Tremby read: &ldquo;Engagement  broken. Audrey free. Tell Lawson. Bollard.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVII"></a>Chapter XVII</b></h2>
  <p>The  news conveyed by the telegram caused Dick to ascend immediately to the seventh  heaven. How Bollard had contrived to break the engagement between his niece and  Randolph it was impossible to say; but there was no doubt that the wire settled  the matter decisively. Audrey was free to be wooed and won.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  by me&mdash;by me&mdash;by me!&rdquo; cried the young man, jumping up to pace the room  exultingly. &ldquo;My luck has changed, Jossy. I am passing out of the storm clouds  into the brightest of sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  shout until you are out of the wood,&rdquo; advised Mrs. Tremby, gravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t croak!&rdquo; Dick felt a qualm, so seriously did she speak.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t croak without reason, old chap. Randolph is a revengeful beast. and won&rsquo;t  take his whipping lying down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  can he do?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  know.&rdquo; Mrs. Tremby leaned back in her chair, and placed her hands behind her  head. &ldquo;But he managed to force Audrey to engage herself to him, so, to me, it  looks as though he knew something to her disadvantage.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;If  so, he would not consent to the breaking of the engagement.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!  H&rsquo;m! There is something in that, Dicky, boy. I wonder what means Bollard used  to smash up things and upset Randolph&rsquo;s applecart?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  ask him when I see him,&rdquo; said Lawson determinedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t if I were you, old son. Better leave well alone. Go to Winter square  and make love to Audrey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should like to, no end.&rdquo; Dick hesitated, and his face became somewhat outcast. &ldquo;But  will she listen to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. When I saw her last night she was full of your praises. In her eyes  you are honorable, kind, clever, and all the rest of it. Audrey said that she  never could, and never would, forget what she owed you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  only gratitude,&rdquo; said Dick, ungratefully. &ldquo;I want love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo;  said the lady, philosophically, &ldquo;they say that pity is akin to love, so why not  gratitude also? Anyhow, Dicky, you have good ground to work upon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  Audrey listen to me?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think so. No; more than that, I am sure she will listen. And I could not wish  her a better husband. She needs one&mdash;and a protector,&rdquo; ended Jossy, in a significant  tone.</p>
  <p>Lawson  stopped his perambulations and stared at her. &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  Randolph is spiteful and cunningly clever. I know much more about him than you  do, Dicky, for my late lamented had much to do with him. If Bollard had not  managed to break the engagement I was going to bring forward my record of  Randolph&rsquo;s shady past into which I enquired. As it is, there is no need to do  that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  he worries Audrey,&rdquo; finished Dick, thoughtfully, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t see what he can  do.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  can I. However, he will do his best to make himself disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt that. Probably he will console himself with Esther.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  if I know it, Dicky,&rdquo; Mrs. Tremby sat up, with a wrathful look in her eyes. &ldquo;There  isn&rsquo;t much friendship between me and your cousin, who is an extreme silly old  spinster. All the same, she is too good to marry that scamp, who would waste  her money and end up by deserting her. Bollard has stopped the marriage with  Audrey; I shall stop the marriage with Miss Spine. Never you mind how. But I  have a rod in pickle for Mr. Arthur Randolph, although I don&rsquo;t wish to use it  until I am forced to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  nodded, rather absent-mindedly. &ldquo;This is all very well, Jossy, but it is a side  issue, after all&mdash;the breaking of Audrey&rsquo;s engagement, I mean. We are as far off  as ever from discovering the truth about the murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;One  thing at a time, Dicky. We have cleared the ground so far! now we can get on.  What conversation did you have with Randolph last night, when your cousin was  present? Tell me word for word. There might be something in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Unless  you can make mountains out of molehills, I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; replied Lawson,  recalling the supper table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anyhow,  I&rsquo;ll report everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Having  a remarkably retentive memory, the young man related the whole conversation,  including Randolph&rsquo;s African story, and the saving of Randolph&rsquo;s life by young  Hamber. Jossy listened attentively, and seemed deeply interested, so much so  that Lawson expressed surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  is nothing in what I have told you, so far as I can see,&rdquo; he protested.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t see further than your nose,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Tremby, rather vulgarly. &ldquo;There  may be more in this than you imagine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind. You have given me an idea. No, don&rsquo;t ask me what it is, because I won&rsquo;t  explain. I&rsquo;ll think over things, and act accordingly. Now, Dicky, you go home  and dream of Audrey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d  rather see her than dream about her,&rdquo; said Lawson, ruefully. &ldquo;If you come  across her, do put in a good word for me, Jossy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I&rsquo;ll do that. And I am going to visit her in a couple of days&mdash;three o&rsquo;clock on  Thursday afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  be there also,&rdquo; said Dick brightening. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I shall be glad.&rdquo; Jossy rose with a yawn. &ldquo;Oh, Dicky, get out.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Thus  peremptorily dismissed Lawson took his departure, and returned on winged feet  to his rooms. There he passed the rest of the evening smoking and thinking of  Audrey&rsquo;s perfections. What a beauty she was. What an angel&mdash;and something of a  spitfire. Anyhow, the bravest and most loyal little soul in the world. The way  in which she stood up for that wreck of a brother of hers; the self-control she  had exercised throughout the whole trying time. &ldquo;Oh, there is no one worth  thinking about but Audrey,&rdquo; said Dick to himself when he went to bed.</p>
  <p>Next  morning brought a letter from Mr. Bollard asking Dick to call at his office  about noonday. Lawson wondered why the invitation should have been sent, so  immediately after the telegram to Mrs. Tremby; but was glad to receive it. Had  the letter not arrived he would in any case have looked up the stockbroker,  being immensely curious to learn how he had contrived to bring Randolph to  heel. Probably Bollard intended to tell him, and while attending to his bevy of  damsels the riding master thought all the tine of the coming interview. He  presented himself at Wren street when the many churches in the city were  announcing with chiming bells the hour of twelve.</p>
  <p>Bollard  looked somewhat anxious and careworn, when the young man appeared in his  office, and silently indicated a chair. Dick wondered at this unusual behaviour  in the jovial old man, and noticed that he spoke throughout the interview in a  much more subdued tone of voice. There was no roaring; and no hearty laughter.  Bollard somehow did not seem to be his usual self. &ldquo;Are you ill, sir?&rdquo; asked  Dick sympathetically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Worried,  my boy, worried,&rdquo; said the stockbroker, passing his hand across his forehead. &ldquo;I  had an uncomfortable interview with Randolph yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I guessed. But it had a comfortable termination.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  nodded, with a grim look. &ldquo;Oh, I settled him all right. I see you are very  anxious to know how I did so. But I am not going to explain.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t wish to force your confidence, sir,&rdquo; said Lawson, quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that. Believe me that if I could explain to anyone I would do so to you,  young Lawson. But there are things better left unsaid.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Randolph  has a shady past, I know from Mrs. Tremby,&rdquo; suggested Dick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  the way I floored him had nothing to do with his past,&rdquo; said Bollard, swiftly, &ldquo;but  if he makes trouble after what I have said to him, I shall bring up his past,  which is not one of the cleanest. I employed a private detective to hunt up  details, although in this instance I did not use them.&rdquo; He paused.</p>
  <p>Dick  wondered what the old man was thinking about, so twisted was his large face  with pain, although his eyes remained cool and steady. &ldquo;You wish to speak to  me, sir?&rdquo; he said, when the silence become unbearable.</p>
  <p>Bollard  started, as if taken by surprise, and became more of his usual self, looking  the speaker squarely in the eyes. Then he made an astonishing remark, which  seemed to have nothing to do with the matter in hand. &ldquo;You love my niece?&rdquo; he  said, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know I do, sir. I told you when we last met that one day I would ask you to give  her to me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  shall have her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Dick gasped, and stared wildly, with his mouth open.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is, of course,&rdquo; amended Bollard, &ldquo;if she loves you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;think&mdash;she  does.&rdquo; Lawson&rsquo;s words came haltingly. &ldquo;And I know that I love her,&rdquo; he ended  boldly and positively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can see that. And I am inclined to think that Audrey returns your love, so far  as one can read a young girl&rsquo;s mind. Your honorable conduct and chivalrous  silence made a great impression on her. I know of no one whom I would sooner  choose for her husband.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  thank you&mdash;thank you. But&mdash;&rdquo; Dick&rsquo;s face fell&mdash;&rdquo;I have no money.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Money  is not everything,&rdquo; said the stockbroker, quietly; &ldquo;and Audrey will have&mdash;indeed  she has&mdash;three thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  couldn&rsquo;t live on my wife, sir,&rdquo; Lawson&rsquo;s face flushed. &ldquo;Audrey would not  respect me if I did that, nor would I respect myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Bollard  stretched out his hand and shook that of Lawson. &ldquo;I quite expected you to say  that, and your saying it shows me more than ever how right I am in my judgment.  If Audrey is willing you shall marry her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I can&rsquo;t give her a home or a position, sir.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  seem to make a great many objections,&rdquo; said Bollard, dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Would  you rather I did not, Mr. Bollard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  no. I think the better of you for your diffidence. But you can set your mind at  rest. I shall get you a place where you will be able to earn a good salary, and  have a brilliant future, if you work.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  would work myself to death for Audrey,&rdquo; exclaimed the fervent lover.</p>
  <p>Bollard  laughed in his old hearty manner. &ldquo;I think Audrey prefers you alive rather,  than dead,&rdquo; he said, jovially. &ldquo;Young Lawson, your father was my very good  friend, and I have known you from your childhood upward. You are well bred, a  man of good birth, and have brains, which you have not used. I shall put you in  the way of using them. I want you to marry Audrey, because I know you are  honorable and honest. She wants a protector.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  was struck by Bollard&rsquo;s use of the same word which Mrs. Tremby had applied to  this possible marriage. &ldquo;Is she in any danger, sir?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  might be&mdash;from Randolph!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the danger?&rdquo; Dick bristled like a terrier.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may not come; on the other hand it may. When it does then you shall be put in  possession of facts.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  they bear on Lady Hamber&rsquo;s death?&rdquo; questioned Dick, and wondered inwardly why  he spoke thus, and without apparent reason.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes,&rdquo;  drawled Bollard, and turned his face away; then he stood up and faced round,  observing abruptly, &ldquo;keep your eye on Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  he anything to do with the murder?&rdquo; Dick was startled, sensing danger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  accuse no one, young Lawson. Go and see if my niece will marry you, and if she  accepts keep your eye on Randolph. He means mischief.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;  Dick was amazingly puzzled. &ldquo;If you would explain&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; Bollard was quite fierce, &ldquo;and what is more I won&rsquo;t explain  unless I am driven to do so. I speak in Audrey&rsquo;s interests. Now go.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  obeyed and left the room, half-pleased, half-annoyed, wholly puzzled.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XVIII"></a>Chapter  XVIII</b></h2>
  <p>For  the next four and twenty hours Dick had ample food for thought. The more he  considered the circumstances of his visit to the city the more tangled did his  thoughts become. So far as he could gather there was some secret connected with  Audrey, which Randolph knew, which Randolph had made use of to compel the girl  to engage herself to him. But as Bollard, in some known way, had forced the  scoundrel to break the engagement, why should he fear any revenge on the part  of the rejected suitor? If this shady friend of the late Lady Hamber had a hold  over the girl, undoubtedly&mdash;so it would appear&mdash;the stockbroker had a hold over  him. And one hold, or the other&mdash;perhaps both&mdash;had to do with the murder in  Sarley Wood. It was impossible that Audrey could be guilty; equally impossible  that Randolph was implicated. What, then, was the meaning of Bollard&rsquo;s hints?  Dick gave up the riddle in despair, not even having Jossy at hand to help him  to solve it.</p>
  <p>For  Mrs. Tremby had disappeared again, and again the notice of her absence for two  or three days was fixed to her office door. Where she had gone to, or what she  was doing, Dick could not guess, save that her action had something to do with  the case. The crime in which the young man was so strangely involved had been  complicated at the outset, but it seemed to him that it was even more  complicated now. Dick thought and thought and thought, in the hope of arriving  at some conclusion, so that this nightmare existence&mdash;to others as well as to  himself&mdash;should come to an end, but only succeeded in worrying himself to fiddle  strings.</p>
  <p>This  game was certainly not worth the candle, as his worrying produced no result.  Therefore, after more than 24 hours of tumultuous thoughts he threw his worries  to the four winds and set out to visit Winter square.</p>
  <p>He  would see Audrey; he would make love to Audrey. The crime and its mystery, the  extraordinary behaviour of Bollard and Randolph could go hang. Dick&rsquo;s misery  was so great that he laughed, and then sought out Audrey, to find a better  reason for his laughter.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I am glad to see you, Mr. Lawson,&rdquo; was the girl&rsquo;s greeting to the visitor, and  she held out both her hands with a smile.</p>
  <p>Lawson  was so taken aback by this unexpected friendliness, and more than friendliness,  that he could only stare and clasp both those dear little hands in his own. He  looked into Audrey&rsquo;s face, noting that in spite of her smile it was wan and  worn. &ldquo;I am glad to see&mdash;you,&rdquo; he stammered, for his brain was whirling, and he  did not know how to word his thanks for this delightful reception. &ldquo;You&mdash;you are&mdash;kind.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have every reason to be&mdash;to you,&rdquo; replied Miss Hamber soberly. &ldquo;Do sit down, Mr.  Lawson. Tea will be in soon, and my brother Gerald is coming down. He wants to  meet you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Delighted!&rdquo;  murmured the still bewildered man. &ldquo;And is Mrs. Tremby coming?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  wrote and said that she was; but so far I have seen nothing of her. Have you  seen her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  for the last two days&mdash;more or less. She has disappeared. Somehow,&rdquo; added Dick,  looking puzzled, &ldquo;Jossy has a trick of disappearing.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  always was a queer girl,&rdquo; sighed Audrey, seating herself opposite to Dick in a  deep armchair; &ldquo;but she is very clever and a dear. She told me that she had  known you all her life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  has,&rdquo; admitted the visitor, &ldquo;and has bullied me terribly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey  laughed. &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think you were a man to be bullied. Remember how you  ordered me about in the wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was for your good,&rdquo; said Lawson with a smile.</p>
  <p>Audrey  laughed again. She had no doubt that she loved Dick. He had walked into her  heart when they met so strangely in Sarley Wood, and the door had been shut to  everyone else.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  engagement has been broken,&rdquo; said Lawson suddenly, bringing his eyes back to  her face, and announcing the fact somewhat defiantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  How do you know?&rdquo; Her color came and went, and she seemed embarrassed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  Uncle Oliver told me; told Mrs. Tremby. We were both delighted.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is superfluous to ask why,&rdquo; said Miss Hamber with a nod of relief. &ldquo;Neither of  you liked Mr. Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  detest him. And you?&rdquo; He looked at her searchingly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t&mdash;care&mdash;for  him,&rdquo; she murmured brokenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  should think you didn&rsquo;t, the bounder.&rdquo; Dick bent forward eagerly. &ldquo;And I hope  you weren&rsquo;t angry at what I said in that alcove?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  the alcove?&rdquo; Audrey looked down and drew patterns on the carpet with the toe of  one small bronze slipper.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  dear alcove,&rdquo; said Dick sentimentally, &ldquo;where I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>What  he would have said Audrey guessed easily, and her heart beat while she waited  to hear him say it. But at that moment the door opened to admit a tall, thin,  delicate-looking young man. When he saw Lawson he came forward with an  outstretched hand. All the same, there was an apprehensive, nervous look on his  delicate face. &ldquo;I have to thank you for much, Mr. Lawson,&rdquo; he said, in a low  and rather hoarse voice. &ldquo;You have been a good friend to Audrey and to me.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that is all right,&rdquo; said Dick, wishing to pass over the matter lightly, so as  to set the invalid at his ease. &ldquo;I only did what any decent chap would have  done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; cried Audrey strongly. &ldquo;Not one man in a thousand would have behaved with  such discretion and so chivalrously.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree.&rdquo; Gerald sank into a near armchair with a sigh of exhaustion. &ldquo;As I said  to my sister, Mr. Lawson, you are a tower of strength. You should hear our  Uncle Oliver sing your praises.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Bollard is my very good friend,&rdquo; laughed Dick, still striving to lighten the  somewhat strained atmosphere, &ldquo;but he thinks too well of me. I really have done  very little; but I hope to do much.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo; asked young Hamber listlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish to solve the mystery of your stepmother&rsquo;s death!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you could,&rdquo; sighed the boy&mdash;he was little else. &ldquo;All the same, I don&rsquo;t  think you ever will.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that. With Mrs. Tremby&rsquo;s assistance I hope to.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on hoping,&rdquo; said Audrey, vehemently. &ldquo;And you and Jossy are so clever that I am  sure you will succeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  wish us to succeed?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Most  emphatically; so does Gerald. We won&rsquo;t know a moment&rsquo;s peace until you do  succeed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  would have said more, but that two footmen entered at that moment, bringing in  the afternoon tea. When they were all enjoying the meal, Gerald looked round  the big room enquiringly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought someone else was coming here today,&rdquo; he said, vaguely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jossy,  dear,&rdquo; murmured Audrey, who was refilling Dick&rsquo;s cup.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, of course. But there was someone else. I say, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;What did you say  your name was?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lawson,&rdquo;  replied Dick, seeing that the boy&rsquo;s memory was at fault.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  so, Lawson. Yes, you helped Audrey in the wood when I&mdash;when I&mdash;&rdquo; His face took on  a bewildered expression. &ldquo;What did I do in the wood, Audrey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  think of the wood, Gerald,&rdquo; she said, anxiously. &ldquo;Have some more tea.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I have to think. Someone is coming. He doesn&rsquo;t like Lawson.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  looked puzzled. &ldquo;Who doesn&rsquo;t like me, Hamber?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  man who is coming. Ah, yes!&rdquo; Gerald raised his voice, having got a clue to what  he wished to remember. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Randolph. He doesn&rsquo;t like you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  I don&rsquo;t like him!&rdquo; retorted Dick, promptly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Randolph isn&rsquo;t a bad chap. We were in Africa together.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you saved his life?&rdquo; observed Dick, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I? I forgot. But when he comes here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gerald!&rdquo;  Audrey started. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that you have asked&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Randolph,&rdquo; announced the dignified Backhouse, throwing open the door.</p>
  <p>The  unwelcome visitor walked languidly forward as the door closed, but halted  scowling when he saw Lawson. He was smartly dressed, looking prosperous and  somewhat insolent. The color came to Miss Hamber&rsquo;s face and her eyes looked  angry. &ldquo;Why have you come here?&rdquo; she demanded in her straightforward way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gerald  asked me to come,&rdquo; retorted Randolph with insolence&mdash;veiled it is true, but none  the less insolent for that&mdash;&rdquo;and I wanted to come.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sit  down, old chap,&rdquo; said Hamber, patting a chair beside him; &ldquo;you know Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;what  did you say your name was?&rdquo; He appealed to Dick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I know his name and all about him,&rdquo; said Randolph, coolly, &ldquo;and I must say I am  surprised to see him here, riding-master.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  my friend,&rdquo; said Audrey, sharply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  well,&rdquo; sneered the other, &ldquo;if you choose to select your friends from the  riffraff of the lower orders, I have&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo;  commanded Dick, rising; &ldquo;remember, you are in a lady&rsquo;s drawing room, Mr.  Randolph. You shall answer to me for that speech, outside.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anywhere  you choose,&rdquo; said the man, with cool impertinence, &ldquo;and you are not to come  here again.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  dares to say that?&rdquo; demanded Audrey, her cheeks red with anger.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do!&rdquo; Randolph, who had sat down rose again. &ldquo;I hold you there,&rdquo; he tapped the  palm of his hand, &ldquo;so I am master here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Hamber  rose also, and spoke with dignified displeasure. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  mean that I saw you carrying Audrey into the house on the night when your  step-mother was murdered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;  Gerald&rsquo;s color came and went, but spoke firmly. &ldquo;And that means?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  one or the other of you shot her. Obey me, both of you, or I tell. And no one  can prevent my telling.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are wrong,&rdquo; said a clear voice at the door, and the three turned swiftly to see  that someone had entered slightly. &ldquo;I can prevent you.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XIX"></a>Chapter XIX</b></h2>
  <p>It  was Mrs. Tremby who stood at the door, massive, imposing, and with a gleam in  her dark eyes which boded little good to Randolph. Audrey and Dick were  relieved and uplifted by her arrival, for they saw that she had come with the  full intention of fighting Randolph, and made certain that he would find her no  mean antagonist. The scamp himself evidently thought otherwise; for he stared  at her derisively, and began to laugh mockingly. &ldquo;You, Mrs. Tremby?&rdquo; he said,  with a shrug. &ldquo;And what can you do, pray? How can you prevent me from telling  what I know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll  come to that later,&rdquo; answered the big lady, advancing leisurely into the room. &ldquo;I  did not expect to find you here, Mr. Randolph; but it is just as well that we  should meet so opportunely. Otherwise you would have put me to the trouble of  looking you up. Gerald, how are you?&rdquo; She placed her hand on the boy&rsquo;s  shoulder, and gave it a friendly shake. &ldquo;Audrey, dear, do give me a cup of tea  and something to eat.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Randolph  was quite taken aback by this cool behaviour, and apparently reconsidered his  opinion with regard to her capability of opposing him. His laughter ceased, and  he looked uneasy.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know Mrs. Tremby of old,&rdquo; he remarked, in his drawling way. &ldquo;There is no chance  of anyone talking but herself when she is present. Audrey&rdquo;&mdash;he turned towards  the girl&mdash;&rdquo;I shall call later and explain myself to you and your brother,&rdquo; and  he sauntered languidly toward the door, with an insolent look at Dick as he  passed by him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t go away if I were you, Mr. Randolph,&rdquo; said Jossy over her shoulder,  and very imperturbably; &ldquo;you might walk into the hands of the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  man wheeled at the door, and his sallow face blanched, although he still strove  to maintain his nonchalant attitude. &ldquo;You are talking nonsense,&rdquo; he called  back, with an uneasy frown. &ldquo;What have I to fear from the police?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  know best, Mr. Randolph. You hinted a few moments ago that I talked too much,  so I won&rsquo;t waste words in explaining what you already know. Sugar, please,  Audrey; you know I always like my tea sweetened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m going!&rdquo; Randolph tugged the door open irritably.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  you please. Don&rsquo;t say I have not warned you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Randolph  hesitated, thought better of his determination to leave, and closed the door  violently. Then he came swiftly back to face Mrs. Tremby. &ldquo;What the devil do  you mean?&rdquo; he demanded ferociously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gently,  Mr. Randolph; you are in the presence of ladies.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>It  was Lawson who spoke, and he advanced toward the man with a quiet smile, which  seemed to intimidate Randolph more than open anger would have done.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t mean to be rude,&rdquo; he muttered, scowling darkly. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will when I have finished my tea,&rdquo; said Jossy, sweetly. &ldquo;Well, Gerald, and what  have you to say about this&mdash;gentleman? He&rsquo;s a pal of yours.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  this time Hamber had been sitting in his chair as quiet as a mouse, and  listening attentively. &ldquo;From this moment Randolph is no friend of mine,&rdquo; he  said, with a firm dignity new to those present. &ldquo;He has dared to come here and  declare that either Audrey or I shot Lady Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe you did,&rdquo; insisted Randolph. He took his seat, leant back, and crossed  his legs, quite recovering his coolness, which the entrance of Mrs. Tremby had  dispelled. &ldquo;If you did not&mdash;one or the other of you&mdash;why were you in the wood on  that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  did you know we were in the wood?&rdquo; asked Audrey, calmly. Now that things were  becoming dangerous she set her teeth and faced them bravely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must have been. I was reading up to a late hour in my bedroom, the window of  which looked out on to the lawns in front of the house. Before retiring I went  to see what kind of a night it was, and I saw Gerald carrying you across the  lawn up the terrace steps. Oh, you were in the wood right enough, and you shot  Lady Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should I shoot her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  had a row with her. Oh, yes. When I came came down to the drawing room for that  book she told me that you had quarreled with her and had rushed out. I wanted  to go and search for you, but she made me go back to my room. Then the butler  came in, and after dismissing him, I suppose, she followed, to be shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  not by Miss Hamber,&rdquo; struck in Dick, quickly, &ldquo;she was lying in my caravan when  the shot was fired; and moreover, had no revolver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did not say that at the inquest,&rdquo; snarled Randolph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  was no need for me to say anything,&rdquo; retorted Lawson.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  of course you would defend her,&rdquo; sneered the other man.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall do so to the last ditch,&rdquo; was Lawson&rsquo;s answer, and Audrey looked at him  with gratitude shining in her eyes.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the last ditch is close at hand, and I am going to push Gerald and his precious  sister into it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Randolph  surveyed Dick&rsquo;s inches and noted the choleric gleam in his eye. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want  you to interfere. It&rsquo;s none of your business.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  make it my business!&rdquo; said Lawson, resolutely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Words!  Words! Words!&rdquo; chanted Jossy, setting down her cup, &ldquo;let us get to business. I  can explain yours, Mr. Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  can you?&rdquo; the man&rsquo;s lips twisted in quite an ugly way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly.  You want Audrey&rsquo;s money, and so forced her to become engaged to you by  threatening her with the story you have just told. For the sake of Gerald, she  engaged herself to you. Bollard broke the engagement and forced you to  withdraw. Now, finding that you can&rsquo;t get the money in that way, you have come  here to ask for blackmail.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  come to ask money for my silence,&rdquo; said Randolph, sullenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  said as much&mdash;blackmail!&rdquo; Mrs. Tremby spoke with great tranquility. &ldquo;You always  were a low-bred hound, Mr. Randolph, as my late husband had only too good  reason to know. But I did not think that you would fall quite as low.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Words!  Words! Words!&rdquo; Randolph mocked her by echoing her former speech.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  far&mdash;yes. Now we come to deeds! deeds! deeds! You will hold your tongue about  this cock-and-bull story, which can be explained away.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Who  will make me hold my tongue?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  dear me!&rdquo; Jossy sighed. &ldquo;Are we talking in a circle? I thought I had explained  myself fully when I entered.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Say  what you have to say, and get out!&rdquo; snapped the man, furiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Tremby shall stay here as long as she pleases,&rdquo; said Gerald, rising, and with  an angry flush on his fair face. &ldquo;This is my house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am master in it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Indeed  you are not!&rdquo; flashed out Audrey. &ldquo;Sooner than that, I shall go with Gerald to  Inspector Helder at Tarhaven and explain all that took place on that night, and  how Gerald and I came to be in the wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t dare!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey  faced him resolutely, and caught her brother&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I will dare! Do you think  that I am going to be intimidated by a man who sinks to demanding blackmail? You  forced me into a promise of marriage by threatening to tell how you saw my  brother and I returning to Sarley Court in the moonlight. I was weak enough to  agree, to shield my brother. Now that he knows&mdash;you having told him yourself&mdash;there  is no need for me to keep the matter secret. I shall let Gerald judge for  himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have already judged,&rdquo; said the young man, feverishly. &ldquo;I agree with you,  Audrey. We shall tell the story to Inspector Helder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  yet,&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Tremby. &ldquo;First we must find who really did murder Lady  Hamber,&rdquo; and she looked at Randolph.</p>
  <p>He  winced. &ldquo;You will never find that out. There is no evidence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t agree with you. I haven&rsquo;t been looking into this case for nothing, Mr.  Randolph. But there is one thing I don&rsquo;t know, so perhaps you will be good  enough to enlighten me. How did Bollard force you to break the engagement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shan&rsquo;t tell you. I have still a card to play, and when I play it&rdquo;&mdash;he looked  savagely at the girl&mdash;&rdquo;you will find that I can make things deuced unpleasant all  round&mdash;for Bollard as well as others.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you mean to blackmail Bollard,&rdquo; observed Jossy, coolly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  object to the word.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Probably  you do. But what does that matter? Well, Bollard can look after himself, which  he is quite capable of doing. I shall attend to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mind  your own business!&rdquo; Randolph glared at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Whipping  hounds such as you are is my business, my dear Judas. And, by the way, before  we go any further, I don&rsquo;t intend to let you marry Miss Spine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall marry her if I choose,&rdquo; growled Randolph, doggedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  said Lawson, in a voice like thunder, so loud and emphatic was his tone. &ldquo;You  certainly will not. I am Miss Spine&rsquo;s relative, and I don&rsquo;t choose that she  shall marry a man capable of acting as you have done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d  better take care, Lawson. I know a thing which will put you in Queen street. So  there.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind at present,&rdquo; Randolph rose and caught up his hat and cane. &ldquo;As I said, I  have a card to play yet&mdash;two cards; one which will trump Bollard, and one which  will trump you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  the sooner you play them the better,&rdquo; said Dick coolly, &ldquo;for as soon as you do  play them I shall thrash you within an inch of your miserable life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Randolph  winced, and made for the door, with an ugly laugh. &ldquo;I am going to Scotland  Yard,&rdquo; he said viciously.</p>
  <p>The  brother and sister looked at one another with sudden apprehension, and Dick,  noting the interchange of glances, felt a qualm. It might be that this  scoundrel could do some harm to one or the other. Mrs. Tremby alone was perfectly  calm and collected. She rose from her chair and walked toward Randolph as he  fumbled with the door knob. &ldquo;Do you wish me to speak here or in the hall?&rdquo; she  enquired. &ldquo;I am ready to do either.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  good creature,&rdquo; she said impatiently. &ldquo;I told you that I was going to prevent  you from speaking of what you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; he cried triumphantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can! It does not suit my plans that you should speak now. When I lay my hand on  the man who shot Lady Hamber&rdquo;&mdash;she touched his shoulder lightly, and he shrunk  away, quivering&mdash;&rdquo;you can speak as much as you like.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do you propose to stop me from telling what I know?&rdquo; asked the man in a hoarse  voice, and manifestly afraid.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can tell you here or in the hall.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Randolph  looked into her eyes, which were very close to his own. For the moment he was  inclined to defy her and bid her speak out before everyone. But her calm looks  daunted him, and he opened the door. &ldquo;You can tell me in the hall,&rdquo; he growled  savagely, &ldquo;but you won&rsquo;t close my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  let us see if such a miracle can be accomplished,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby, and pushed  the man out of the room, closing the door after her.</p>
  <p>Those  left behind looked at one another. Audrey, controlling herself with a visible  effort, threw her arm over the shoulder of her brother. He was shaking from  head to foot, evidently the prey of his unruly nerves. &ldquo;Do you&mdash;you think that  Jossy will&mdash;stop him&mdash;from&mdash;speaking?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  dear, yes.&rdquo; Audrey smoothed his fair hair tenderly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Lawson?&rdquo;  he appealed to Dick anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe in Jossy,&rdquo; said Dick cheerfully. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a wonder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>They  had every reason to believe him, for when Mrs. Tremby returned she was smiling  gaily. &ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;he will be silent. I&rsquo;ve fixed him.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XX"></a>Chapter XX</b></h2>
  <p>&ldquo;Jossy,  how did you&mdash;?&rdquo; asked Audrey breathlessly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear, I shall explain everything when the time comes. As I told Dick, so I tell  you&mdash;that you must let me conduct this matter in my own way. Just now I want  fresh tea. I am tackling no light job, and my nerves are as bad as yours, my  dear Gerald.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  one would believe that,&rdquo; said the young man, touching the bell. &ldquo;Why, you stood  up to that scoundrel like a Briton.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;Scoundrel? I thought he was your pal?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said that before, and I told you he wasn&rsquo;t. My eyes are opened to what he  really is.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey,  who had always disliked and dreaded the friendship between her weak brother and  this strong-minded rascal, clapped her hands softly with delight when he spoke.  &ldquo;Since when, Gerald?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Since  he came in with his blackmailing proposition, Audrey.&rdquo; He slipped his arm round  her waist. &ldquo;You should have told me how he forced you to promise to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  health wasn&rsquo;t good enough for me to tell you that,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;All I wished  to do was to get you out of the trouble. That is why I persuaded you to go with  me to Paris immediately after the funeral. Hush!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  broke off suddenly when Backhouse made his appearance with fresh tea and took  away the empty teapot. A second ringing of the bell always meant that another  supply of tea was wanted, so no time was lost. When the butler departed and  Jossy was enjoying her second cup, Dick spoke out resolutely. He had been  considering matters.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hamber,  I think you know that I am a staunch friend to yourself and your sister?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I know that, Lawson. You have proved it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  tell me everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought Audrey had already done so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I have.&rdquo; The girl looked at her lover with a perplexed frown. &ldquo;What do you want  to know further than I have explained?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Are  you afraid lest Randolph should get you both into trouble?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  there is no doubt that he can, if he goes to Scotland Yard and tells how he saw  Gerald carrying me back to Sarley Court on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Hamber nodded, and turned even paler than he was. &ldquo;It will be hard to explain  that. And&mdash;and I can&rsquo;t explain. I don&rsquo;t quite remember everything, you know. I  missed Audrey, and went in search of her. Then I heard the shot, and&mdash;and I  picked up the revolver, didn&rsquo;t I, Audrey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  nodded. &ldquo;Afterwards you placed Lady Hamber&rsquo;s body in the caravan and carried me  home, since I could not walk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t remember that&mdash;exactly. It is all so vague.&rdquo; The boy swept his thin hand  across his forehead. &ldquo;I only know bits. But I couldn&rsquo;t tell a connected story  to save my life.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  try to,&rdquo; advised Mrs. Tremby from the tea table.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I must, if the police ask me things.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  won&rsquo;t ask you anything&mdash;at all events, not now.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  if Randolph goes to Scotland Yard&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  dear boy,&rdquo; broke in Jossy, crossly, &ldquo;your memory is rotten. Didn&rsquo;t I tell you  that I had shut that beast&rsquo;s mouth? He won&rsquo;t go to Scotland Yard.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are sure?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly  sure.&rdquo; Mrs. Tremby rose and crossed to the boy to lead him gently to a deep  armchair. &ldquo;My dear, you always trusted me. I have been just like a mother to  you, so why not trust me now?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gerald  leaned against her confidently. &ldquo;You are always kind, Jossy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course I am kind,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Tremby; &ldquo;in the meantime, don&rsquo;t worry over  that wretch. He daren&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if he shot Lady Hamber himself,&rdquo; said Audrey who had  been thinking. &ldquo;Yes. You heard how he admitted that she told him I had left the  house. He might have followed me&mdash;followed my stepmother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is not impossible,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby, dryly, &ldquo;not even improbable.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;B&rsquo;Jove,&rdquo;  cried Lawson, suddenly enlightened, &ldquo;is that what you said to him in the hall,  Jossy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I said something else. Don&rsquo;t bother me, Dicky, I have other things to attend  to, much more important.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  can be more important than the closing of Randolph&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perhaps  not at this moment. However, it is closed, so you needn&rsquo;t bother any more as to  the why and the wherefore.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Jossy!&rdquo;  burst out Audrey, desperately, &ldquo;I wish you wouldn&rsquo;t make such a mystery of  things. I am sick of mystery.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t wonder at it. Ever since Lady Hamber married your father you have had  mystery, and her murder only adds to the perplexity of everything. But we must  go step by step, Audrey dear, as we are groping along a dark path and cannot  see very far ahead. When I know what I intend to know, then I shall speak out,  and you will approve of my present licence. Lady Hamber&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  don&rsquo;t talk of her,&rdquo; interrupted Audrey, vehemently. &ldquo;I shall never forgive her  for what she said to me on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did she say?&rdquo; Jossy looked across the room curiously.</p>
  <p>Audrey&rsquo;s  face became red, and she cast down her eyes. &ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to&mdash;to speak of it,&rdquo;  she murmured, in choking tones. &ldquo;She was a wicked woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby suddenly left the arm of Gerald&rsquo;s chair on which she was sitting, and  went over to Audrey, and took both her hands. &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; she said, firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  The girl pulled her hands away.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  what she told you anything to do with the case&mdash;with the murder?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  I would tell you if it had. It was a&mdash;a private matter.&rdquo; Audrey looked at Dick,  grew a deeper crimson, and ended up by bursting into tears as she sank down  into a chair.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Miss  Hamber&mdash;Audrey!&rdquo; Dick was beside her in a moment, greatly distressed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Dick, Dick!&rdquo; She caught his hand and pressed it against her wet cheek. &ldquo;I know  you will help me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  any way&mdash;in any way. Dearest, you know that I love you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Love  Audrey!&rdquo; cried Gerald, with weak surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I want to marry her. Have you any objection?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Objection!&rdquo;  Hamber sprang to his feet with amazing strength, considering his weak health,  and crossed the room to shake Dick&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;After what you have done for us,  there is nothing I would like better.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  was taken aback by this friendly display from a quarter where he had expected  opposition. &ldquo;But you scarcely know me,&rdquo; he faltered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Audrey  knows you&mdash;Jossy knows you&mdash;Uncle Oliver knows you. What they say is good enough  for me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Audrey!&rdquo; Dick held out his arms and the girl, rising, would have cast herself  into them, but Mrs. Tremby held her back. &ldquo;No. This is no time for love-making,  much as I sympathise with you and Dicky. I have something to learn from Gerald,  as I told you at the ball. Where is that revolver he picked up in the wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Audrey,  with a nod, went to a cabinet, opened a drawer, and took out a revolver. This  she brought to Jossy, who examined it carefully, and sat down to question  Gerald. &ldquo;Come over here, my dear boy. Is this the revolver you picked up near  the body of Lady Hamber?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so. I did pick up a revolver, only I can&rsquo;t be sure this one is&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is,&rdquo; said Audrey, positively. &ldquo;When I crawled out of the caravan, Gerald had  just picked it up. I took it from him and carried it home with me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jossy  nodded in a satisfied way. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Gerald, do you remember saving  Randolph&rsquo;s life in Africa?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  I&mdash;oh, yes, I think I did.&rdquo; The boy looked puzzled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I did.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course,&rdquo; struck in Dick, wondering what Mrs. Tremby was trying to arrive at. &ldquo;Randolph  told me himself. A nigger got drunk and ran amuck. Randolph was unarmed, when  the man made for him with an axe, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  yes!&rdquo; Hamber interrupted, excitedly. &ldquo;I remember now quite clearly; I threw him  my revolver, and he shot the nigger just when I fired my Winchester. Of course  I saved Randolph&rsquo;s life, and he repays me in the way he has done.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  kind of man would,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby, with disgust. &ldquo;But Gerald, dear, is this  the revolver you threw to Randolph?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  started, guessing what Jossy wished to learn, and looked eagerly at the boy,  who was now examining the weapon.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t be sure,&rdquo; murmured Hamber, in a far-away voice. &ldquo;One revolver is so like  another.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  are two deeply-cut nicks in the butt of this one, see, and some kind of letter,  curving imperfectly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes,&rdquo; said Hamber, still in his far-away voice, and looking at the weapon  indifferently. &ldquo;I remember trying to carve my name. That curve is a &lsquo;G.&rsquo; and  the two nicks the &lsquo;H&rsquo;; only I was interrupted before I could put in the  crossbar. It is my revolver right enough.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gerald!&rdquo;  cried Audrey, excitedly, &ldquo;do you know what you are saying?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Saying?&rdquo;  He looked vaguely at her, evidently not realising the importance of his speech.  &ldquo;Yes, I know; of course I know. What are you making such a fuss about, Audrey?  There&rsquo;s nothing in giving a revolver to a chap. I chucked it to Randolph when  that nigger went for him. We laughed over the business when talking in his  bedroom at Uncle Oliver&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  and Audrey would have both exclaimed, but that Jossy silenced them with a look.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  made you recall the story, Gerald?&rdquo; she asked, softly, and in a coaxing way.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why,  I found the revolver in Randolph&rsquo;s bag when he was packing up to come over to  Sarley Court.&rdquo; Gerald spoke easily and with indifference.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and  he took it to Sarley Court?&rdquo; asked Jossy, anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  suppose so. But why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  She rose triumphantly. &ldquo;Because Randolph shot Lady Hamber with this very  revolver. He is the guilty person. I always thought so.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXI"></a>Chapter XXI</b></h2>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby and Lawson left Winter square with a triumphant feeling that the  long-standing mystery had been rightly solved, and that Randolph would now have  to pay in full for his evil deeds. Jossy explained at length to the young man  that she had always suspected Randolph, since her knowledge of the past assured  her that he would shrink at nothing to gain his ends. But it was hard to  understand why he had shot Lady Hamber, although on the evidence of the  revolver&mdash;he must have done so. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what motive he had to get rid of  her,&rdquo; argued Lawson; &ldquo;she was his friend; she supported his suit to Audrey,  and, so far as I can see, was more use to him alive than dead.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jossey  nodded gravely. &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; she assented. &ldquo;I am puzzled myself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think that there may be some other explanation of the death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There  may. Everything is possible in connection with criminality. But failing  Randolph, who could have killed the woman?&rdquo; She thought for a few minutes, then  suddenly made a suggestion. &ldquo;Ask Randolph round to your lodgings?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;  Dicks face expressed unbounded astonishment. &ldquo;We are not on good terms, and I  prefer his room to his company.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Daresay.  But I should like to ask the man questions in your presence. He is a slippery  customer, and should I see him alone would deny the truth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t admit the truth before a witness,&rdquo; expostulated Lawson, doubtfully.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t care if he does, or not,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby coolly. &ldquo;I have sufficient  evidence on which to have him arrested. When Inspector Helder has him under  lock and key he may confess. But I wish to learn what his motive was for this  apparently causeless murder, so I want you to be present when I ask.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  won&rsquo;t come to my rooms, Jossy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will,&rdquo; Mrs. Tremby retorted confidently. &ldquo;Mention in your note that I have told  you how I closed his mouth, and infer you wish to speak to him about the  matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I don&rsquo;t know how you closed his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall tell you now. Randolph forged the name of a rich young fellow, who was  the friend of my late husband. Billy was mixed up in the matter, so that it  looked as if he was an accomplice. I saw the young man, and managed to convince  him that Billy was innocent; but I asked him not to take steps against  Randolph, lest my husband&rsquo;s name should suffer. Then Billy died, and the matter  has remained in abeyance. I told Randolph that, if he spoke out, I would have  him arrested for the forgery, however much it might reflect on my husband&rsquo;s  memory.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Jossy!&rdquo; Dick was touched, for he knew how Mrs. Tremby had loved her weak and  foolish husband. &ldquo;Would you do that for Audrey&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  and for Gerald&rsquo;s. You guessed, as I saw, that I love Gerald. I should like to  marry him, as he needs someone such as I am beside him to be his mother as well  as his wife. I mothered Billy, who was just such another sweet-pea, ready to  cling round any stick. However, we can discuss this later.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Meanwhile,  send a note by hand to Randolph&mdash;this is his address&mdash;and ask him to come round  to your digs at nine o&rsquo;clock tonight. I shall turn up at that hour.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>While  Dick was placing the card she gave him in his pocket-book, and the two were yet  lingering at the corner of Winter square, a breathless man hurried up. It was  the butler, Backhouse, less dignified than usual, because of his haste. He  addressed himself immediately to Mrs. Tremby. &ldquo;I thought I would have missed  you, madam,&rdquo; he said, striving to recover his breath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Lawson and I have been chatting here for the last ten minutes,&rdquo; replied Mrs.  Tremby, wondering at his appearance. &ldquo;Anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  madam. But Miss Audrey wants you to come back with me. She has something of  importance to tell you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Shall  I come too, Jossy?&rdquo; questioned Dick, looking anxious and fearful lest some new  trouble had come to Audrey.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  Go to your rooms and write the note to Randolph immediately. There is no time  to lose. I shall go back and see Audrey.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t think there is anything wrong?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything  is wrong until all these mysteries are cleared up,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Tremby,  brusquely. &ldquo;I shall call and see you at nine o&rsquo;clock. Come, Backhouse.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>She  moved away with the butler, looking much disturbed by this unexpected summons  to return, and left Dick standing where he was in a state of nervous  excitement. He immediately jumped to the conclusion that something had gone  wrong with Audrey and her brother, but what it might be he could not think. But  for the necessity of obeying Jossy and securing the presence of Randolph at his  rooms, he would have gone back to the house.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  whole infernal thing is enough to drive a chap out of his mind,&rdquo; muttered  Lawson between his teeth.</p>
  <p>Ordering  the taxi to wait, the young man hurried to his sitting room, and wrote a hasty  note to Randolph, inviting him at 9 o&rsquo;clock that evening to discuss what Mrs.  Tremby had talked about in the hall of Sir Gerald Hamber&rsquo;s house. With this he  went downstairs and jumped into the taxi again. Dick felt that he could not sit  still while things were in such an unset condition, and so drove to Randolph&rsquo;s  address, to deliver his own note. He dismissed the taxi in Sophia street, St.  James&rsquo;s, where the man lived, and gave the note to the ex-butler who owned the  house, with instructions that it was to be given to Mr. Randolph at once. Then  he wondered if he dared to call again at Winter square, so as to get his mind  set at rest. After some struggle with his anxiety he decided to walk home to  Bloomsbury, and leave things in the capable hands of Mrs. Tremby. The walk did  him good, and he returned home to await patiently the coming of the expected  visitor.</p>
  <p>Yet  it was with a long-drawn breath of relief that Lawson heard the clock strike  nine times.</p>
  <p>Randolph  arrived almost to the minute, looking anxious and nervous. It was in vain that  he strove to be his languid, insolent self. There was fear in his shifty eyes;  lack of self-control in his restless gestures. With an effort to appear  indifferent he lounged into the room at the heels of Dick&rsquo;s landlady, and when  she retired, threw himself into a chair. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked, striving to steady  his voice, &ldquo;and what do you wish to see me about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think my note informed you of that,&rdquo; replied his host quietly. &ldquo;What Mrs.  Tremby said to you in the hall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is none of your business,&rdquo; burst out Randolph, fiercely, &ldquo;and she promised to  say nothing if I held my tongue over the presence of Hamber and his sister in  Sarley Wood on that night.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Tremby thought it advisable to tell me of your crime,&rdquo; said Dick, shrugging.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then. I think it advisable to tell the police about that couple, who have to do  with the death of Lady Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  was about to ask him if it was wise to do so, seeing that he, himself, could be  proved guilty, when the door opened and Josey entered quietly. She had lost her  florid color and lively manner, appearing pale and decidedly subdued, &ldquo;Oh, you  have come as requested,&rdquo; she said, on seeing Randolph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  he replied, insolently, &ldquo;and I want to know why you broke your promise?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  exercised a woman&rsquo;s immemorial right to change her mind,&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Tremby,  coolly; &ldquo;but you need not be afraid. Mr. Lawson will hold his tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t hold mine,&rdquo; said Randolph, losing his coolness in a fit of sheer rage. &ldquo;Tomorrow  I shall go down to Tarhaven and explain all I know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  indeed! Will you explain how you shot Lady Hamber?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Randolph  sprang from his chair with such violence as to overturn it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lie. You  know it is!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the truth, and you know it is,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby, very distinctly, while  Dick listened with all his ears. &ldquo;Audrey called me back to the house after I  left it with Mr. Lawson, and told me to ask Backhouse questions. You did not go  to bed after leaving Lady Hamber in the drawing room, but put on your overcoat  and followed her out of the window.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  did not follow her,&rdquo; said Randolph, livid with anger and fear.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Backhouse  saw you, when he came back for a moment to look in and see if the lights were  out. He said nothing, since he did not think it was necessary at the time. But  he revealed what he knew to Audrey, and&mdash;well, what explanation have you to  make?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;None.  I had no revolver with which to shoot Lady Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, you had. The revolver Gerald threw to you in Africa, when that nigger  tried to kill you. Gerald was over at Sarley Grange, where you were staying the  day before you came to Sarley Court. He saw the revolver in your bag, and  recognised it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Randolph&rsquo;s face wore a curious expression. &ldquo;So I shot Lady Hamber with that  revolver, did I?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  did,&rdquo; said Jossy, serenely. &ldquo;Gerald picked it up near the body where you flung  it down when you escaped from the wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Randolph  sneered. &ldquo;So clear; very conclusive. Well, then, I was out of the house on that  night. But I did not follow Lady Hamber; I was not in the wood. I did not have  the revolver; and I did not shoot her, having no reason to do so.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby shrugged her massive shoulders. &ldquo;As to your reason I can say nothing.  But you have admitted in the presence of a witness,&rdquo; she pointed to the silent  Lawson, who nodded, &ldquo;you have admitted that you left the house on that night,  on or about the time Lady Hamber went out. The revolver was in your possession,  as Gerald can prove, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  is enough evidence against me,&rdquo; interrupted Randolph, waving his hand  impatiently, and now quite his own insolent self. &ldquo;You are sure that the woman  was shot with that revolver?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  I am quite sure I have it. It is loaded in five chambers, the sixth is empty of  the cartridge, with which Lady Hamber was shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  was shot with a bullet,&rdquo; sneered Randolph, his eyes glittering, why Dick could  not imagine, &ldquo;not with a cartridge. But who can expect a woman to be strictly  accurate? Well, you have a very pretty case against me. I suppose you intend to  have me arrested. Are the police in waiting?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Mrs. Tremby looked at him, steadily. &ldquo;I am going to give you a chance of  escape. Go back to your chambers and write out a confession, so that all those  involved in this matter may have their characters cleared. Bring it me tomorrow  and sign it in the presence of Mr. Lawson and myself. Then I advise you to  escape to the States.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you advise me to escape to the States,&rdquo; said Randolph, in a curious tone. &ldquo;According  to your account I am guilty of forgery and murder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are,&rdquo; said Jossy, firmly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  admit the first, but not the last. Why this clemency?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby faced him squarely, &ldquo;I know why Audrey became engaged to you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Randolph laughed in an ugly way, &ldquo;she explained how I forced her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did!&rdquo; Jessy&rsquo;s eyes met his very steadily.</p>
  <p>The  scoundrel looked rather taken aback. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think she&rsquo;d have the pluck to do  that,&rdquo; he muttered, then raised his eyes to look at Dick. &ldquo;You are very silent,  Mr. Lawson, yet you are the champion of this unfortunate damsel. Why don&rsquo;t you  defend her?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Tremby is defending her on my behalf,&rdquo; said Lawson, politely, and overcoming a  wild desire to knock the man down. &ldquo;I know how you forced Miss Hamber to engage  herself to you. Yes&mdash;you intended to tell the police that she and her brother  were in the wood if she refused to marry you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  that is it, is it?&rdquo; Randolph laughed, and still in the old ugly way, while he  turned toward Mrs. Tremby. &ldquo;So he doesn&rsquo;t know the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  she answered, very pale, but with great self-control, &ldquo;he does not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wonder what he will say when he does know?&rdquo; sneered the man, now quite his old  wicked, languid self, and surveyed the amazed face of Lawson with a mocking  smile.</p>
  <p>Dick  sprang to his feet. &ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;both of you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will know later,&rdquo; said Jossy, catching his arm as he advanced with an angry  gesture toward Randolph. &ldquo;Gerald and Audrey are going down to-morrow to Sarley  Grange for a few days,&rdquo; she went on, addressing the scamp. &ldquo;They stay there  with Mr. Oliver Bollard. Before they leave town by the 12 o&rsquo;clock train I want  your confession. Only on your promising to bring it to me tomorrow at 11&mdash;bring  it here, so that Mr. Lawson and I can witness it&mdash;will I afford you this chance  of escape. Meantime you are being watched.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Very  kind of you,&rdquo; said Randolph, picking up his hat and overcoat, &ldquo;both in having  me watched and in giving me this chance of getting away. Well, Mrs. Tremby, I  accept your generous offer. Tomorrow at 11 you will see me here with my  confession, and everything will be put right. Meantime, I bid you good night,  Mr. Lawson. Madam!&rdquo; He bowed ironically to Jossy, and left the room with a  mocking laugh.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  does this mean?&rdquo; asked Dick when the door was closed. &ldquo;What is the truth he  spoke about?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Jossy  sighed; &ldquo;You will know all when the confession is signed and witnessed.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXII"></a>Chapter XXII</b></h2>
  <p>It  was in vain that Dick attempted to make Mrs. Tremby reveal what Randolph meant  by his strange behaviour. All she would say was that Audrey had told her  something of moment which had led her to afford the scamp a chance of escape,  and that as soon as his confession was signed and witnessed an explanation  would be given. Seeing that Mrs. Tremby was depressed and quite worn out,  Lawson did not press the matter. But he passed a bad night after the lady left,  since he felt that there was something very uncomfortable to be revealed. It  concerned Audrey, perhaps her brother; but what it possibly could be Dick was  unable to guess. Throughout the dark hours he tossed and turned on his bed,  wooing sleep in vain, for the suspense was dreadful. He was quite haggard and  sick with apprehension when he got up next morning.</p>
  <p>A  cold bath and a tolerably good breakfast, together with the early riding lesson  he had to give his class, somewhat braced him. He returned to his rooms feeling  very much better, and was changing his clothes when the landlady knocked at his  bedroom door with the information that a lady wished to see him. Thinking it  was Jossy, arriving to wait for Randolph and the promised confession, Dick was  uplifted; actually whistling, when he finished dressing and opened the door of  his bedroom to greet the lady. He stopped short at the sight of the very last person  he expected to see.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  it&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; screamed Miss Esther Spine, in her peacock voice, and with an  indignant glare. &ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d come, did you, Richard? Oh, you bad man,  with your plots and schemes and wicked doings. And after I sent you a hundred  pounds,&rdquo; she continued, quivering with anger, and tossing her head indignantly;  &ldquo;after I was prepared to overlook your wicked past and welcome you to my only  too kindly heart. To accuse Arthur of being a murderer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  you know that, do you?&rdquo; Lawson strode across the room and stared hard at her. &ldquo;And  how do you know?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  do I know?&rdquo; shrieked Miss Spine, shrilly. &ldquo;Why, the poor darling came to me  last night, after he left you, and told me what you and that wicked woman had  said. Mrs. Tremby. Yes! Mrs. Tremby.&rdquo; She repeated the name because Jossy had  just entered silently. &ldquo;Oh! the pair of you. And Arthur one of the sweetest and  most angelic of men.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  has a good advocate in you,&rdquo; said Jossy, quietly. &ldquo;May I ask you why you have  come here to defend that scoundrel?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  won&rsquo;t hear you.&rdquo; Miss Spine stuffed her fingers into her ears. &ldquo;No, no! I  really won&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t sit in the same room with you. Richard, turn that woman  out immediately. I am only a girl&mdash;or almost a girl&mdash;innocently brought up. She  is not fit company for me in any way. Oh, the shame of it; to sit down with a  Jezebel.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby flushed with annoyance, and, walking across the room, pulled the excited  damsel&rsquo;s hands from her ears and forced her into a chair. &ldquo;What do you mean by  coming here and making a fool of yourself?&rdquo; She shook Miss Spine until the many  jingling ornaments she wore rattled loudly.&rdquo;&lsquo;How dare you talk to me and of me  in this disgraceful way, you wretched old creature!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Old!  Creature!&rdquo; Miss Spine gasped, with indignation. &ldquo;I am neither the one nor the  other. In the interests of my dearest Arthur I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  the devil is dearest Arthur to you?&rdquo; demanded Dick, roughly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Swearing!  How awful. Richard, I wonder you aren&rsquo;t afraid of being struck dumb with your  wicked speech.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wish you were,&rdquo; he retorted. &ldquo;Now then, Esther, pull yourself together and  explain yourself reasonably.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  be civil,&rdquo; supplemented Mrs Tremby with a frown. &ldquo;I am not going to allow you  to be impertinent.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Miss  Spine tossed her head and her hands quivered as she tried to get her nerves  into better order. &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s all very well talking, and you are both very bold  in your ignorance. But if you know what Arthur knows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  do know,&rdquo; snapped Jossy, impatiently; &ldquo;he is coming here shortly to give me a  written statement of the crime he committed.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; shrieked Miss Spine, triumphantly, &ldquo;he has gone down to that horrid  man, Mr. Bollard&rsquo;s place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  know that,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Tremby, quietly, &ldquo;but I wished to learn if you knew  it, as you are evidently working hand-in-glove with Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  he really gone down to see Bollard, Jossy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  Dick. He will see him, but not until the afternoon. Just before I left my  office I received a wire from Tarhaven from the man I employed to watch  Randolph. He&mdash;Randolph, I mean&mdash;has gone there to see Inspector Helder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;For  what reason?&rdquo; Dick looked perturbed.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is making a last attempt to throw the blame of his crime on to someone else. He  and Helder will probably go over to Sarley Grange this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Of  course they will.&rdquo; The fair Esther left off powdering her nose, and nodded with  a contemptuous smile. &ldquo;Arthur told me so. Gerald Hamber is guilty, and will be  arrested by Inspector Helder.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  a lie,&rdquo; cried Lawson angrily&mdash;but it distressed him to see that Mrs. Tremby did  not support his downright denial.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is the truth,&rdquo; insisted Miss Spine. &ldquo;Oh, I know how you learnt that my dearest  Arthur left the house on that night, and how you accuse him of following Lady  Hamber to shoot her. He told me all, and now&rdquo;&mdash;her voice leaped an octave, until  she screamed like a seagull&mdash;&rdquo;I will tell you all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Go  on, then,&rdquo; said Dick, quietly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am engaged to Arthur,&rdquo; cried Miss Spine triumphantly. &ldquo;Oh, I know he paid that  washed-out Audrey Hamber attentions, but his heart was always mine. He told me  so, bless him, my darling, my angel. We were going to elope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should you elope?&rdquo; asked Jossy, with a shrug. &ldquo;No one would mind if you married  the man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  wanted the romance of an elopement,&rdquo; said Miss Spine simpering. &ldquo;My heart being  fresh and young in a way you cannot understand with your worn nature.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Never  mind my worn nature. Go on with your confession.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s  not a confession. I need not tell you anything. I only came out of regard for  Richard, so that he might escape from the punishment which will most surely  fall upon him in being associated with you in accusing an innocent man of  murder. My Arthur is no murderer.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  will have to prove that,&rdquo; said Dick dryly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can prove it!&rdquo; Miss Spine rose dramatically, waving her arms with a small  mirror in one hand and a powder puff in the other. &ldquo;On that night when Lady  Hamber was slain in the wood my Arthur was with me!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  you!&rdquo; Jossy and Dick stared at the woman; stared at one another.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I wished to elope, and wrote to Arthur, arranging to be on the road outside  Sarley Court waiting for him. I drove down late at night in my car, my heart  leaping to meet him. I heard the shot,&rdquo; said Miss Spine, with emphasis, &ldquo;and  shortly afterwards Arthur came running up to say that he could not go with me  that night, as something dreadful had happened. So I went back to town, and  later read all about the tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Your  statement doesn&rsquo;t clear Randolph&rsquo;s character,&rdquo; said Dick bluntly. &ldquo;You declare  that he came to you after the shot was fired. And he might&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;  Miss Spine screamed indignantly. &ldquo;Gerald Hamber fired the shot! Arthur saw him  fire it!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  Randolph did follow Lady Hamber!&rdquo; struck in Mrs. Tremby sharply. &ldquo;You said a  little time ago that he did not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Arthur  asked me to say nothing about that; but when you say that my Arthur fired the  shot I think it is right to defend him. He did follow, and he did see the  shooting. So there!&rdquo; Miss Spine moved hurriedly toward the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hamber  is not guilty!&rdquo; insisted Lawson furiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  is. That plain-looking sister of his has been trying to defend him, and that is  why she took him to Paris. He is half an idiot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nothing  of the sort!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Tremby furiously in her turn. &ldquo;He is much more  sensible than you are! If anyone is guilty it is Randolph!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then, go down to Mr. Bollard&rsquo;s place and hear what Inspector Helder has to say  now that Arthur has told him what he saw. You will arrive in time to see Gerald  Hamber arrested. And Arthur,&rdquo; ended Miss Spine triumphantly, &ldquo;will then marry  me!&rdquo; She left the room with a cackling laugh, jeering and sneering.</p>
  <p>Miss  Tremby and Dick looked at one another. &ldquo;Could Hamber be guilty after all?&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXIII"></a>Chapter  XXIII</b></h2>
  <p>An  hour later&mdash;on the stroke of one, to be precise&mdash;a powerful motor car was racing  out of London, with Dick at the wheel and Mrs. Tremby beside him. Shortly after  Miss Spine&rsquo;s departure Jossy had telephoned to Winter square, only to learn  that Audrey and her brother had already left the house to catch the midday  express from Liverpool street. Bollard was expecting them at his country house,  but Mrs. Tremby would have prevented their going had it been possible, if only  to disarrange Randolph&rsquo;s vindictive plans. But it was too late, so nothing  remained but to follow and see what would be the result of the scoundrel&rsquo;s  machinations. Having wired to Tarr that he was off duty for the day, he and  Jossy started as soon as possible.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  you think we shall be in time?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Tremby, while the car whizzed along  in the hot sunshine. &ldquo;We must get there before Helder arrives.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe we can manage it,&rdquo; said Lawson grimly, as he let out the car to full  speed up a long, straight white road bordered by hedges; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t expect we  shall find things will happen as Esther suggests.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  seemed very certain of the truth of what she was saying.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Randolph,  has pulled wool over her eyes. She is so infatuated with the man that she  believes anything he says.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;But  I know, from the wire I received, that Randolph has gone to seek out Inspector  Helder,&rdquo; said Jossy dismally. &ldquo;He looks as though he were innocent, otherwise  he would not put his head in the lion&rsquo;s mouth.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Bluff!&rdquo;  said Lawson curtly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  doubt that,&rdquo; contradicted Mrs. Tremby acidly, for her nerves were troubling  her. &ldquo;Gerald can prove that Randolph had the revolver, Audrey that it is the  revolver with which Lady Hamber was shot, while that woman, in our presence,  declared that Randolph was out of the house on that night. The evidence is  strong against him. His mere statement that Gerald is guilty will not clear his  character.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Dick  shook his head anxiously. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a difficult case. Jossy. I can&rsquo;t see what  Randolph is driving at. If he really saw the boy shoot that woman, he would  have asked for money to hold his tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  did ask,&rdquo; Mrs. Tremby reminded him.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  But he did not seem to be sure if Audrey or Gerald was guilty. Also he merely  tried for blackmail, on the plea that he saw the boy carrying his sister back  to the house. If he really saw Gerald shoot he would have charged him openly  with the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so have been forced to admit that he left the house in pursuit of Lady Hamber,&rdquo;  declared Mrs. Tremby doubtfully, &ldquo;He did not wish that to be known, remember.  Miss Spine said so, and only let it out by chance. No, Dicky, there is  something at the back of this which I cannot grasp.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  agreed, with a nod, then suddenly asked: &ldquo;You are sure Hamber is an innocent  man, Jossy?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;  she replied resolutely. &ldquo;I would stake my life on his innocence.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  Audrey seems to be afraid on his account.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Because  of his health,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby quickly. &ldquo;The poor boy has been all broken to  pieces since his accident. His memory is almost gone, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s  the point,&rdquo; interrupted Lawson sharply. &ldquo;Do you think that he might have really  shot the woman and then forgotten all about it?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  I don&rsquo;t. Gerald is not the kind of man to shoot a woman.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  disliked his stepmother, remember.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  had every reason to,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby with a frown. &ldquo;Particularly if what  Audrey told me is true, which I can hardly believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  did she tell you?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t explain at present. Audrey made me promise to tell the truth&mdash;and a very  unpleasant one it is&mdash;to you; when the mystery of her stepmother&rsquo;s death was  solved. Until that happens I am bound in honor to hold my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Has  what she told you anything to do with the death?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  might have something to do with it, and it might not.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Randolph  knows this secret?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  And made use of it to force Audrey to engage herself to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  I&rsquo;m not going to be kept in the dark any longer,&rdquo; said Dick in a resolute tone.  &ldquo;When I see Audrey I intend to insist upon an explanation. If in any possible  way this secret bears on the death I have a right to know it in order to save  the girl I love.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will know it when the time comes. Meanwhile, can&rsquo;t you trust me, Dicky?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t like mystery,&rdquo; he grumbled, frowning.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Neither  do I. I have had enough of it to last my lifetime. When things are straightened  out I shall marry Gerald&mdash;he asked me once to become his wife, you know&mdash;and  leave the detective business. In the meantime, trust your old pal, Dicky. I won&rsquo;t  let you down.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  cast a side glance at the massive figure of the big woman, at her strong face  and firm lips. Jossy was no fool, and although he felt sore at being excluded  from her confidence and that of Audrey, yet he felt that he could safely leave  things in her hands. All the same, &ldquo;I wish I could understand you, Jossy,&rdquo; he  said with a sigh of vexation.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will before you marry Audrey, or I Gerald,&rdquo; she said, comforting him in her motherly  way.</p>
  <p>By  this time they were more than halfway to their goal. Dick had travelled the  roads only a short time previously in his caravan, so there was no need for any  delay in consulting maps. With no deviation from the nearest route to Sarley  Village he drove the big car steadily onward, between hedgerows, through  villages and towns, over causeways bridging marshes, up and down hills. In a  couple of hours, or a little more, the machine sung through Sarley Village,  passing the big house, the wood, the tiny hamlet itself, and emerged again into  the open country. Here, immediately beyond the village, the ground began to  rise towards the hill upon which Sarley Grange was built. One side of the hill  was extremely precipitous&mdash;a kind of inland cliff, which in prehistoric times  had been washed by the sea&mdash;and up the side of this, in a slanting direction, a  narrow road had been cut from the live rock. In days of yore Sarley Grange had  been a robbers&rsquo; castle, and there was only one way of approaching it, so that in  time of war it could be well defended by a few resolute men. Along the side of  the road and on the verge of the precipice ran a new wall to prevent accidents&mdash;so  low that Jossy became a trifle nervous.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Do  take care, Dicky,&rdquo; she said, clutching the side of the car. &ldquo;If you barge into  that wall we&rsquo;ll fall about 30 or 40 ft., and there won&rsquo;t be much left of us.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t  squeal,&rdquo; retorted Lawson, who was surging the machine steadily up the incline. &ldquo;I  know my business. Also, as much as I know, there has never been an accident  here. Selwin, who is a native of these parts told me all about the place when  he came upon me in Africa. Sarley Grange seems to be a kind of  Dove-in-the-Eagle&rsquo;s-Nest or an excellent robber&rsquo;s castle of the Middle Ages.  Bollard is a stockbroker. I expect it suits him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby, not having read Charlotte Young&rsquo;s delightful story, paid no attention  to this prattle. Still rising, this leafy way&mdash;the trees arched over it, making  a kind of emerald twilight in the sunshine&mdash;led to an open space of  widely-spreading lawns, bordered by brilliant flower beds. The house itself was  a mixture of the old and the new&mdash;Norman, Tudor, Georgian, and Victorian  architecture were all mingled in one delightful whole, harmonised by wind and  sun and Father Time. It was a charming old house, but Mrs. Tremby cast only one  look at it, and then her eyes fell on a car at the door.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Dicky,&rdquo; she said, her voice shaking, &ldquo;we are too late. There is a car.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  may not have come from Tarhaven,&rdquo; said Lawson soothingly, and halted his own  machine behind the other. &ldquo;Get out, Jossy, and let us go into the house.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>There  was no chauffeur in the waiting car so it was impossible to make enquiries. But  a glance told Dick that it was much too luxurious a vehicle to be hired or  owned by Helder. An idea flashed into his mind that his cousin had anticipated  their arrival, but he did not impart this to Mrs. Tremby, who was sufficiently  anxious as it was. The footman who opened the door explained that Mr. Bollard,  with his guests, was in the library, and just as he did so a French window on  the left opened, and the man himself stepped out.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Young  Lawson! Mrs. Tremby!&rdquo; He came forward quickly, and nodded to the footman to  close the door. &ldquo;I am so glad you have come. There is a lunatic here worrying  Audrey, and Gerald, and me.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not a lunatic,&rdquo; screamed a highpitched voice, and when Miss Spine appeared  out of the French window, Dick knew that his guess had been correct. &ldquo;How dare  you say&mdash;oh!&rdquo;&mdash;she broke off in dismay when she beheld the new arrivals&mdash;&rdquo;you  here?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  and Mrs. Tremby,&rdquo; said Lawson coolly. &ldquo;We came along to see this thing through.  You advised us to, you know.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  didn&rsquo;t expect you would come, Richard,&rdquo; shrieked Miss Spine viciously, &ldquo;and  that woman, too. Ah, well,&rdquo; she laughed jeeringly, &ldquo;the more the merrier. Come  in and wait for the arrival of the police.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a frown Bollard ushered in Jossy and Dick, when Miss Spine stepped back into  the library. They entered by the window as the nearest way, since, in obedience  to his master&rsquo;s orders, the footman had already closed the front door. The  library was a sombre apartment with a red carpet and curtains and black oak  bookcases filled with volumes. Audrey was seated on the arm of a chair in which  her brother was huddling, and looked up with relief when she saw her lover and  his companion. &ldquo;Oh, Dick!&rdquo; she cried with a sob, &ldquo;you are just in time. This  woman has been saying such dreadful things about Gerald,&rdquo; and she passed her  arm round the neck of the shivering boy.</p>
  <p>Miss  Spine giggled hysterically, and Bollard turned from her with a look of  aversion. &ldquo;Is she mad?&rdquo; he asked Mrs. Tremby pointedly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  more mad than you are, Mr. Bollard,&rdquo; cried Miss Spine sharply. &ldquo;And, if it  comes to that, I would rather be mad than wicked. That man&rdquo;&mdash;she pointed to  young Hamber&mdash;&rdquo;is guilty of the death of his stepmother.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stuff  and nonsense,&rdquo; muttered the stockbroker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Wait  until Inspector Helder arrives. Then we shall see if it is stuff and nonsense.  Oh, I wish he would come to punish you all.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have got your wish, madam,&rdquo; said Bollard heavily. &ldquo;Here is Inspector Helder,  and with him that blackguard Randolph.&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXIV"></a>Chapter XXIV</b></h2>
  <p>As  in the case of the last arrivals, Mr. Bollard went out by the French window to  call Helder and his companion into the library. Helder, lean and sharp-eyed,  followed the big man in through the window, and after him came Randolph, with a  triumphant smile. Lawson felt nervous. Randolph certainly did not look as  though he were afraid, whereas Hamber was shaking from head to foot and displayed  every evidence of guilt.</p>
  <p>Audrey  also was pale, but kept her nerves well under control and faced the trying  situation with amazing bravery. Mrs. Tremby had sat down silently with an  impassive face, so it was hard to tell what she was thinking about. But Bollard&rsquo;s  expression was one of dismay and grief, which made him appear years older than  he was. Evidently Miss Spine&rsquo;s story had impressed him more than he had  confessed, and he was by no means sure that she was the lunatic he had called  her. She and Randolph, whose arm she took, were all smiles and sneers; but  Helder preserved his official calm, and took his seat near the writing table  with the air of a judge. For quite three minutes there was a dead silence.  Helder broke it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard a very extraordinary story from this gentleman,&rdquo; he said, indicating  Randolph, &ldquo;one which I can scarcely believe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is true, all the same,&rdquo; said Randolph, smiling sardonically, and the woman  hanging on his arm added. &ldquo;Perfectly true!&rdquo; with her usual scream.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the story?&rdquo; asked Bollard, sitting down heavily. &ldquo;As you have come to my  house, Mr. Helder, I am entitled to an explanation.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Certainly,  Mr. Bollard. Your nephew Sir Gerald Hamber is accused by this gentleman of  having shot his stepmother, Lady Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is a lie!&rdquo; said the unfortunate boy from the chair in which he was curled up,  looking the picture of misery.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Anything  you say will he used in evidence against you.&rdquo; Helder warned him in rasping  official tones.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  brother has a right to defend himself!&rdquo; cried Audrey, flushing.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  time and place will be given to him to make his defence,&rdquo; said Helder  judicially. &ldquo;Meanwhile&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  don&rsquo;t you come to the point?&rdquo; interrupted Randolph, who seemed to be annoyed by  this slow dignity of the law. &ldquo;I told you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helder  interrupted sharply. &ldquo;I know what you told me, but I am taking my own way in  dealing with the matter.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have already made one mis-statement,&rdquo; muttered the scoundrel savagely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;On  purpose. I want to get at the rights of the case from all present before I tell  exactly what you told me. You asserted that Sir Gerald Hamber was in Sarley  Wood on or about the time Lady Hamber was shot?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes;  but I also said that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  will come to that later,&rdquo; Helder waved his hand to impose silence.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby, who had been listening attentively and watching Randolph&rsquo;s face, spoke  suddenly to the scamp.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  don&rsquo;t believe that Sir Gerald is guilty?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  do you say that?&rdquo; demanded Miss Spine, ruffling her feathers, &ldquo;when I said that  he was when I saw you at my cousin&rsquo;s lodgings?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  said so. Mr. Randolph doesn&rsquo;t say so,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Tremby shrewdly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have heard what Inspector Helder said,&rdquo; shuffled Randolph angrily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes. But there is something behind what he says.&rdquo; She faced round to the  inspector. &ldquo;Mr. Helder, give me a straight answer. Do you believe that Sir  Gerald is guilty of this crime?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am here to listen to what evidence can be given on that point,&rdquo; evaded the  officer, rather disconcerted by her sharpness. &ldquo;Until Miss Spine speaks I  cannot be sure. Mr. Randolph has told me his story; I wish to hear that of the  witness he has called.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall speak at once!&rdquo; screamed the peacock in a desperate hurry.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo;  Helder spoke imperiously, &ldquo;you shall speak when I order you to do so, Miss  Spine. First, I wish to hear from those present what they did not say but  should have said at the inquest,&rdquo; he glanced at Audrey. &ldquo;You, I understand,  were in the wood on that night?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  she said boldly. &ldquo;I quarrelled with my stepmother and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Gently!&rdquo;  warned Helder, significantly, &ldquo;what you say will be used in evidence against  you.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Confound  it,&rdquo; said Lawson furiously, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t accuse Miss Hamber. Why, I can tell you  that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have heard from Mr. Rudolph what you can tell,&rdquo; retorted the inspector,  sharply, &ldquo;and in due course you can repeat what you know. Just now I wish to  hear what Miss Hamber has to say.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  quarrelled with my stepmother over a matter which has nothing to do with this  case,&rdquo; said Audrey quickly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am not so sure of that,&rdquo; murmured Randolph, looking at her with a wicked smile,  &ldquo;the quarrel about&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Hold  your tongue,&rdquo; shouted Helder indignantly. &ldquo;Am I conducting this case or are  you? Go on, Miss Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  matter of the quarrel,&rdquo; went on Audrey steadily, &ldquo;I repeat, has nothing to do  with the case. Lady Hamber insulted me and I left the house, dressed as I was,  with the intention of coming over here to see my uncle. On the way through the  wood I stumbled over the rope with which Mr. Lawson&rsquo;s horse was tethered, and  sprained my ankle. As I could not walk Mr. Lawson went to look for the horse,  which had got loose, and proposed to drive me here in his caravan. While I was  in the caravan I heard a shot.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  then?&rdquo; enquired Helder, keenly, for Audrey was hesitating.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  looked out,&rdquo; she said faintly, &ldquo;and saw my brother near the body of Lady Hamber  with a revolver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;There,  you see!&rdquo; shrieked Miss Spine, triumphantly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  silent!&rdquo; ordered the inspector, roughly. &ldquo;Go on, Miss Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;We  placed the body of Lady Hamber in the caravan, and my brother carried me home,  as I was unable to walk.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  the revolver?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  took that from him. Mrs. Tremby has it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here  it is,&rdquo; said Jossy, producing the weapon from her vanity bag. &ldquo;I thought it  would be necessary to produce it, and brought it along.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  whom does this belong?&rdquo; asked Helder, examining it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;To  me,&rdquo; said Gerald in quite a firm voice, and started to his feet.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Helder raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;You admit that; also to having been in the wood;  having stood by the body with this in your hand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I missed my sister and followed Lady Hamber. While I was entering the wood I  heard the shot, and arrived in the glade to find my stepmother&rsquo;s body and the  revolver beside her. I picked it up just as my sister looked out of the  caravan. But,&rdquo; he ended with emphasis, &ldquo;I did not shoot her.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yet  you say that the revolver is yours, Sir Gerald?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  was; but I gave it to Randolph in Africa, so that he might save his life when  it was in danger from a drunken negro.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Is  that true?&rdquo; Helder turned towards Randolph.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Perfectly  true,&rdquo; said that gentleman, serenely, much to the astonishment of Dick, who  expected him to deny it.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;  Helder nodded quietly, &ldquo;and how did it get into the wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  must ask Hamber that, inspector.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  do ask it. Sir Gerald?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Randolph  brought it into the wood,&rdquo; said the boy positively.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;He  never did&mdash;he never did,&rdquo; screamed Miss Spine, furiously shaking her fist.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Be  quiet,&rdquo; ordered the officer again. &ldquo;How can you prove that Mr. Randolph brought  this,&rdquo; he tapped the weapon, &ldquo;into the wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t prove it,&rdquo; sighed the boy sadly; &ldquo;all I can say is that on the day before  Randolph came over to my place I was seeing my uncle, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you went to Randolph&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; interrupted Mr. Bollard hurriedly&mdash;&rdquo;yes, I  remember, Gerald. You saw the revolver in his bag, and afterwards told me of  the incident in Africa.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  think I did,&rdquo; said Hamber slowly, and passing his hand across his forehead.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  are not sure,&rdquo; questioned Helder gently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Not  quite. But I must have, as the sight of the revolver would bring back the  incident to my mind, bad as my memory is. I know that Randolph did have the  revolver in his room, and that was the last I saw of it until I picked it up in  the wood.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Did  you recognise it then?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Only when Mrs. Tremby asked me about it did I remember it was the same  revolver. And it is. So, it being in Randolph&rsquo;s possession, how does he account  for it being in the wood?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  have explained all that to Inspector Helder,&rdquo; said Randolph, complacently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  is the explanation?&rdquo; asked Dick, brusquely.</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby looked the same question, although she did not speak. Randolph appeared  so confident and so much at ease, that she scented danger to those she loved.  As Dick&rsquo;s question was not answered immediately, she was forced to speak in the  end. &ldquo;Miss Spine said that Mr. Randolph saw Sir Gerald shoot Lady Hamber. I don&rsquo;t  believe that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  won&rsquo;t believe many things you will hear shortly,&rdquo; snapped the fair Esther with  a giggle. &ldquo;If I could speak&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  will give your evidence shortly,&rdquo; said Helder, sharply imposing silence.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;How  long is this comedy going on?&rdquo; drawled Randolph, lazily.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;As  long as I choose,&rdquo; retorted the officer. &ldquo;I have my reasons.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  should the word &lsquo;comedy&rsquo; be used?&rdquo; asked Bollard, heavily. &ldquo;It seems to me that  this is much too serious a subject to be spoken of so lightly.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is,&rdquo; assented Helder, with official phlegm, and looked at him oddly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Well,  then&rdquo;&mdash;Bollard&rsquo;s heavy gaze wandered towards the faces of Randolph and Miss  Spine, who were regarding him intently, perhaps to see how he accepted the fact  that his nephew was in danger of being hanged&mdash;&rdquo;neither one of you can prove  that Gerald is guilty!&rdquo; he said, with a violent roar of defiance.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  let him prove himself to be innocent,&rdquo; replied Randolph, insolently. &ldquo;He was in  the wood; he was seen by his sister standing over the body of the woman he  hated with the revolver. How does he explain these things?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  can&rsquo;t explain further than I have done,&rdquo; said Hamber, doggedly. &ldquo;I am  guiltless.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  do you think, Mr. Lawson?&rdquo; The inspector turned to address Dick.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  believe Sir Gerald Hamber to be wholly innocent,&rdquo; was the prompt reply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  you, Mrs. Tremby?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with Mr. Lawson,&rdquo; she replied, emphatically.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Bollard?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;My  nephew is most certainly guiltless,&rdquo; said the big man, loudly and fiercely.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No!  No!&rdquo; Randolph and his companion spoke in chorus. &ldquo;He murdered her!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  agree with you. Three against three, and the casting vote is mine.&rdquo; Helder  jumped up lightly and advanced towards the shrinking boy. &ldquo;I arrest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo;  Bollard rose, big and imposing. &ldquo;Arrest the right man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Helder  wheeled. &ldquo;And who is the right man!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am!&rdquo; was the amazing answer. &ldquo;I shot Lady Hamber!&rdquo;</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXV"></a>Chapter XXV</b></h2>
  <p>Followed  a dead silence on the astounding declaration of Bollard that he had shot the  woman. Three of those present looked at the man as though he had said what they  expected him to say, and the remaining three stared in tongue-tied amazement,  scarcely able to believe their ears.</p>
  <p>Inspector  Helder clapped a heavy hand on the stockbroker&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;I arrest you,  Oliver Bollard, in the King&rsquo;s name for the murder of Selina Hamber. Anything  you say will be used in evidence against you.&rdquo; He produced handcuffs.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  need not bring those out,&rdquo; said the big man quietly. &ldquo;I am quite willing to go  without making trouble.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no! It is a mistake&mdash;it can&rsquo;t be true.&rdquo; Audrey sprang across the room and seized  her uncle by the arm. &ldquo;Say it is not true.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  my dear child, it is true!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No,  no!&rdquo; It was Gerald this time who echoed his sister&rsquo;s denial. &ldquo;You are doing  this to shield me, Uncle Oliver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am doing it to save you,&rdquo; answered the stockbroker with emphasis. &ldquo;That man and  woman&rdquo;&mdash;he indicated Randolph and Miss Spine with contempt&mdash;&rdquo;believe that they  had you in a net. To release you from that net I have spoken, and truly. I  alone am guilty of this&mdash;if you call it so&mdash;crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;What  else do you call it?&rdquo; asked Miss Spine, with a scream of surprise.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Justice!  Punishment! Lady Hamber deserved to die. I knew what I was doing, and  deliberately removed her from this world to prevent her from making innocent  people suffer wrongfully.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Bollard,&rdquo; came Helder&rsquo;s warning, &ldquo;better say no more.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>The  big man turned his head towards him, and roared quite in his old style of  overbearing superiority. &ldquo;I shall say all I wish to say, and I expect you to  follow my example.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;In  what way?&rdquo; Randolph asked the question with a yawn, rather overdoing his  pretended indifference, since he was really greatly excited.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Explain  this comedy you have been carrying on for the last half-hour. Mrs. Tremby, you  were right in thinking that there was something behind all the talk. Inspector  Helder and these two melodramatic schemers knew all the time that I was the  wanted man.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Quite  right,&rdquo; said Randolph coolly. &ldquo;And you have to thank Mrs. Tremby, for bringing  about this&mdash;as you suggest&mdash;melodrama.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo;  Jossy started to her feet indignantly. &ldquo;I have nothing to do with this.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  have everything to do. Be quiet, Mr. Helder, I shall speak. It was your telling  me that Lady Hamber was shot with that revolver which gave me the clue. Up to  the time you spoke I never suspected Mr. Bollard, nor had I any suspicion that  Gerald&rsquo;s revolver had been used.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Mrs.  Tremby sat down, feeling faint. She liked the big, jovial stockbroker, and  hated to think that he had been trapped by the information she had given,  unconscious, as she had been, that such would accomplish Randolph&rsquo;s ends. &ldquo;I  don&rsquo;t see how you make that out,&rdquo; she said defiantly, but in a trembling voice.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  shall explain.&rdquo; With his hands in his pockets Randolph leant against the wall  by the still open French window. &ldquo;I did have the revolver in my bag when Gerald  was with me in my bed room. We talked of the African incident before I went  over to Sarley Court, and in doing so I took the revolver up to examine it.  Indeed, I think I offered it to Gerald, since it was of no use to me and really  belonged to him.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Gerald  shivered and nodded. &ldquo;I wish I had taken it; then this awful thing would not  have happened.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  I don&rsquo;t know. You might have seen about shooting Lady Hamber yourself, old  chap. You never liked her, you know. But to continue, I threw the revolver into  a corner, and went away without it. Afterwards I remembered that I had left it,  just when I was going, and asked Bollard to send it over to me. He promised to  do so&mdash;promised to bring it himself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;And  so I did,&rdquo; said the stockbroker, who was listening intently. &ldquo;An hour or so  after you left this place I went up to your room and found the revolver&mdash;which,  by the way, was loaded.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  always had it loaded in case I might wish to use it,&rdquo; said Randolph in a  careless tone. &ldquo;Well, go on. You took possession of it.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;to  return it to you. Late at night I walked over to Sarley Court to return it to  you. Seeing one of the windows of the drawing room open&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;At  what time?&rdquo; asked Helder, who was busy with his notebook.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  10 o&rsquo;clock&mdash;I can&rsquo;t be quite sure to the minute, but it was somewhere between  half-past 9 and 10 o&rsquo;clock. I was about to enter, when I heard Lady Hamber and  Audrey quarrelling. For a reason I decline to impart, I remained outside  listening. Lady Hamber insulted Audrey grossly&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;She  did&mdash;she did!&rdquo;&lsquo; murmured the girl, clinging to her uncle.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;So  I was on the point of intervening,&rdquo; went on Bollard, ignoring the interruption,  &ldquo;when Audrey ran out in a rage, saying that she would walk over to see me. I  was on the point of following her, when Randolph entered the room to ask for  some book he had left. Then Backhouse came in for final instructions. Lady  Hamber got rid of both of them&mdash;she seemed anxious to do so, and I wondered why.  So I waited and saw her come out. I followed her across the lawns, through the  park, and into the wood when she passed through the gate. She went down the  path, and I followed. I was near her crouching in the bushes, and overheard, as  she did, the conversation between young Lawson and my niece.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;About  the sprained ankle?&rdquo; asked Dick, suddenly.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,  about the sprained ankle. When Lady Hamber heard you say, young Lawson, that  you would take Audrey to my place in the caravan, she slipped the halter from  the horse, and it strayed. I saw that she intended to prevent Audrey from  leaving the wood, so that the poor girl might be compromised. And this evil  intention, in conjunction with what she had said to my niece in the drawing  room, caused me to make up my mind to kill her then and there as a dangerous  and wicked woman. I had the revolver in my pocket, and it was loaded. Had I not  possessed it at the moment, had it not been loaded, this tragedy might not have  taken place.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Then  you did not really kill intentionally,&rdquo; said Mrs. Tremby anxiously.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  yes, I did,&rdquo; replied the big man with amazing calmness. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t try to find  loopholes in the hope of my escaping, Mrs. Tremby; thank you all the same. I  intended to shoot the woman. When young Lawson placed my niece in the caravan  and went to search for the horse Lady Hamber moved forward into the glade. I  believed that she intended to lock the caravan door, so as to still further  compromise Audrey. When she reached the fire I aimed at her in the light of the  fire and shot her through the heart. Then I examined her to see if she was  dead, and in doing so threw down the revolver. Before I could pick it up I  heard someone coming down the path.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  was me,&rdquo; struck in Hamber quickly. &ldquo;I followed Lady Hamber, but did not see  you, Uncle Oliver.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nor  I you,&rdquo; rejoined the other, looking puzzled. &ldquo;Odd we should have missed one  another, Gerald, when we were on the same trail. However, as soon as I heard  the noise of someone coming I ran out of the wood and walked home.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  saw you!&rdquo; cried Miss Spine, unexpectedly and triumphantly.</p>
  <p>All  present looked at her.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  saw me?&rdquo; questioned the stockbroker.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  She nodded victoriously. &ldquo;I came down in my car to elope with my dear Arthur.&rdquo;  She squeezed Randolph&rsquo;s arm, and he winced at the endearing gesture and word. &ldquo;While  I waited I heard the shot, and then saw you run across the road. Your face was  easily seen in the moonlight, which had grown strong. I never thought anything  more about the matter until Arthur came and told me that Mrs. Tremby and Mr.  Lawson suspected him of committing the crime.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  should have come forward at the inquest,&rdquo; said Inspector Helder, looking up  from his notebook and speaking severely. &ldquo;We then wanted to learn if anyone had  been seen in or about the wood. Had you spoken then, Miss Spine, we should have  solved this mystery long ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  tell you the sight of Mr. Bollard never suggested to me that he had anything to  do with the matter. I daresay I am a silly little thing,&rdquo; went on the damsel,  coquettishly, &ldquo;and should have more sense. But only when my dear Arthur came to  tell me that he was suspected did I reveal what I had seen. And I am sure,  along with Arthur, I have done my best to tell you everything.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Rather  late in the day,&rdquo; commented the inspector dryly; &ldquo;you should have come to  Tarhaven with Mr. Randolph. He told me about the revolver; but, until I had  your evidence, I could not be wholly certain that Mr. Bollard was guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;You  can be certain now,&rdquo; shrieked Miss Spine, very much offended, &ldquo;and I am not  going to stay here to be insulted by a low policeman.&rdquo; She rushed through the  window, calling out to her chauffeur, who had returned, to get the car ready to  start. When those within heard the hum and buzz of the motor, Miss Spine looked  back: &ldquo;Arthur, come with me at once.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Right  oh!&rdquo; Randolph caught up his hat and moved towards the window. Before he could  reach it Bollard lunged forward, and placed himself in the way. &ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo;  he roared, grimly, &ldquo;you and I have to talk a little.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  decline to talk to you,&rdquo; said the smaller man, and turned white. Certainly he  had reason to be afraid, being a coward at heart and finding the gigantic  towering appearance of Bollard very nerve wrecking.</p>
  <p>The  big man towered over his opponent, tremendously threatening, with his great  hands outstretched to grip him. &ldquo;Stay where you are,&rdquo; he bellowed, and looked  like a fairly tale giant in his grim strength.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mr.  Bollard!&rdquo; Helder rose and laid a warning hand on his prisoners arm.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;It  is all right, inspector; I am not going to harm the rat, although he deserves  to have his neck wrung. Yes, you,&rdquo; he raged, bringing his large red face close  to Randolph&rsquo;s pallid cheek. &ldquo;You are a blackmailer, a forger; yes, and a  white-livered hound who lives on women! I&rsquo;ll wring your neck!&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  two huge hands hovering near his throat Randolph&rsquo;s blood turned to water, and  he almost fainted. But the very extremity of his fear gave him the courage to  save himself. Before those mighty hands could clutch him, before those long  arms could hug him with a bear-like grip, he darted under them, and was out of  the window in a moment, knocking down Miss Spine, who barred the way of escape.  With a roar of fury the stockbroker, sweeping aside Inspector Helder like a straw  hurled himself in pursuit.</p>
  <p>Miss  Spine&rsquo;s chauffeur had started the motor and was standing by the door of the  car, waiting for his mistress to seat herself in it. Randolph, all his senses  on the alert to evade sure death, sprang into the machine, slipped behind the  wheel, and set the machine going. It began to move, and but for Bollard&rsquo;s  extraordinary swiftness the fugitive would have got safely away. But the big  man plunged in pursuit immediately, moving with the speed of an enraged  elephant. As the car gathered speed so did he, and within a short distance  caught it up, to leap into it and on to the wretched man. Randolph&rsquo;s cry of  terror was echoed by Miss Spine, who was picking herself up, much dishevelled.</p>
  <p>Helder  and the rest of those in the library came tumbling in disorder through the  French window as quickly as possible. All began to run down the avenue, with a  vague idea of preventing trouble. Needless to say, this was impossible. The car  was racing down the incline at tremendous speed, with the two men fighting  furiously over the wheel. Dick, being light-footed and in excellent condition,  sped ahead of the others and arrived breathless at the archway, to see the  machine lunge through on to the road. It did not take the curve, for no hand  was on the steering gear, but smashed straight into the protecting wall. There  was a cry of terror from Randolph, a shout of joy from Bollard, and the car,  crashing through the heavy stone, toppled over the precipice. Lawson staggered  under the archway and across the road to look over the abyss. Thirty and more  feet below he saw the ruins of the machine. Bollard and his victim lay dead  beneath.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Nemesis!&rdquo;  said Dick, sighing.</p>
  <h2 align="center"><b><a name="XXVI"></a>Chapter XXVI</b></h2>
  <p>When  examination was made, and the bodies recovered from under the ruins of the car,  Randolph proved to be as dead as the proverbial door-nail. But, strange to say,  Bollard still breathed. How so heavy a man could fall from so great a height  and yet remain alive, it was impossible to explain. Nevertheless, although  unconscious, he had not passed away, and Helder had him carried back into the  house. Miss Spine, in an agony of grief at the loss of her lover and the  shattering of her hopes, took charge of his broken remains. She had his body  taken to London, and it was buried at Kensal Green, where her family possessed  a vault. For all her frivolity and faults, the woman really and truly loved the  man, and mourned him sincerely all her days. But after she left Sarley Grange  with the body of her beloved, none of those concerned in the case ever saw her  again. She held aloof from them, and shut herself up to indulge in her grief,  which was heartfelt and genuine.</p>
  <p>Helder,  still holding to his duty as the representative of the law, returned to Sarley  Grange to keep watch and ward over his prisoner. It was his hope that Bollard  would live to be tried and condemned for his double crime of killing Randolph  as well as Lady Hamber. But, along with Mrs. Tremby, the man&rsquo;s niece prayed  that he might die, without recovering consciousness. And likewise prayed her  brother and her lover. Bollard had done evil that good might come of it; and  wrongly as he had acted, it could not be denied but what his mad actions had  been dictated by love. It was to save his dead sister&rsquo;s children from shame and  disgrace that he had sinned so deeply.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Will  he live?&rdquo; asked Helder, after the doctor summoned immediately from Tarhaven had  made his examination.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No  hope,&rdquo; replied the medical man, positively, &ldquo;not the slightest. The wonder is  that he has lived so long.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>All  that day and all that night the stockbroker remained unconscious. His niece and  nephew, along with Dick and Jossy, remained in the house. Helder also, intent  upon getting some kind of confession. He knew that Bollard was guilty, but  desired to learn why he had shot the woman. Towards the morning, just before  dawn, the Tarhaven doctor sent a message, saying that his patient had recovered  his senses, and wished to see the inspector. Helder went up at once, and found  Bollard feeble, but able to speak. &ldquo;Come here!&rdquo; he whispered; for his roaring  voice had sunk to the merest thread of sound. &ldquo;I want to be sure before I die  that my two dear children are safe.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;They  are safe enough,&rdquo; said Helder, sympathetically, although from habit he produced  his note-book; &ldquo;you are guilty.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am, and I do not apologise for my guilt. In my desk in the library you will  find a written confession signed by me in which I have set down what I told  you. I, and I alone, killed that woman, Gerald and Audrey knew nothing about  the matter; they have never known.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Why  did you murder Lady Hamber?&rdquo; asked Helder, anxiously bending over him.</p>
  <p>Bollard  looked at him cunningly. &ldquo;She tricked me. I loved her and found she was  carrying on with Randolph. Now go and send up young Lawson; my time is short.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>With  a friendly nod the inspector left the sick room, and delivered the message at  once. While Dick went upstairs to obey the summons, Helder sought the library,  and there, by candle-light, for the sun had not yet risen, made a close search  of the confession. He speedily found it in a drawer of the desk, as Bollard had  stated, and read it carefully. What it said was all in keeping with what he  already knew. The dying man had loved Lady Hamber, but his jealousy had been  aroused by her flirtation with Randolph. He had shot her in the glade, not for  Audrey&rsquo;s sake, but out of revenge. And Helder, putting away the confession in  his pocket, felt tolerably certain that the death of Randolph was another act  of revenge. So here was the truth. A good reason for the two crimes had been  given, so there was no need to make further enquiries. But at the back of his  mind; recollecting Bollard&rsquo;s explanations in the library, the officer believed  that there was another and more plausible reason. However, satisfied to some  extent, he kept his promise made to the dying man, and never questioned Audrey  or anyone else about the matter.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile,  Lawson was sitting by Bollard&rsquo;s death-bed, listening to a strange story. The  amazing vitality of the big man astonished him. After a glass of brandy,  unwillingly administered by the doctor before he left the room, he was able to  speak clearly and strongly and at length. But Dick knew that this was merely  the sudden flare-up of an expiring candle, so did not waste his time or the man&rsquo;s  strength in asking more questions than were necessary. He listened with all his  ears.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  told Helder that I shot Lady Hamber because I loved her, and she awoke my  jealousy by flirting with Randolph. And for that reason Helder believes that I  killed the man also. Let him continue to believe so. He will ask no questions  being thus satisfied as to the motive for my two acts&mdash;crimes he calls them. We&rsquo;ll  leave it at that.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t  what you told him true?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;No.  Young Lawson, you love Audrey?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;With  all my heart and soul,&rdquo; said Dick, fervently.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Good!  You shall marry her, and do so as soon as you can. Mrs. Tremby will marry  Gerald, which is a good thing for her and for him; for him, as he needs someone  to look after him and guide him, when Audrey is your wife; for, as she is poor,  and wants a home and a proper position in society.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  am poor also,&rdquo; Dick reminded him.</p>
  <p>Bollard  chuckled feebly. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t be when I am dead. When my will is read, you will  find that I have left you Sarley Grange and six thousand a year. No, don&rsquo;t thank  me! I loved your father, and I love you. Also I love my niece, whom you love.  All is for the best. And now&mdash;listen.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;  Dick bent his ear close to the man&rsquo;s mouth, for his voice was now very much  weaker. &ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Sir  John Hamber, my brother-in-law, was a mean hound. We were at college together.  He met my sister and Audrey was born out of wedlock.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;That  doesn&rsquo;t matter to me,&rdquo; said Lawson, when he had digested this astounding  information. &ldquo;I love Audrey for herself.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;I  thought you would say that.&rdquo; Bollard feebly patted Dick&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;I found out  the truth, and compelled Hamber to marry my sister. Then Gerald, was born in  wedlock. He is legitimate: Audrey illegitimate. Afterwards my sister, whom I  very dearly loved, died. Years afterwards Hamber married the woman I shot. She  was always a tyrant, and treated both the children shamefully. When Hamber  died, like the mean dog he always was, he told her about Audrey. On the night  she was shot, Lady Hamber taunted Audrey about the matter, and told her she had  no right to her name. That information made Audrey rush out to find me, and so  all the trouble came about. Knowing that Lady Hamber would disgrace my poor  darling child, I shot the woman deliberately, and I am glad that I did shoot  her. But she left her venom behind her, for afterwards, when Audrey became  engaged to Randolph, I learnt that he knew the truth from Lady Hamber.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;The  scoundrel,&rdquo; cried Lawson; &ldquo;and used it to force on the engagement?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  I broke the engagement by telling Randolph that if he married Audrey he would  get no money, as being illegitimate, she could not inherit her large income,  owing to the wording of the will. I killed Randolph deliberately, as he knew  the truth, and I did not trust him. You understand?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Does anyone else know the truth?&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Mrs.  Tremby. Audrey told her. No one else. And now&mdash;now&mdash;&rdquo; Bollard&rsquo;s voice sank to a  whisper, &ldquo;now&mdash;I&mdash;am&mdash;dying. Rather&mdash;unexpected.&rdquo; He made an effort to sit up, but  fell back. &ldquo;Gerald&mdash;Audrey&mdash;my&mdash;darl&mdash;&rdquo; His voice ceased. He was dead, but had  lived long enough to explain everything.</p>
  <p>Dick  drew the sheet over the massive, strong face, stern in death, and went out to  notify the doctor and the nurse. Then he took his way to the library, which  Helder had vacated. A lamp was lighted, although the dawn was now beginning to  redden the eastern sky. A figure sitting in the armchair started up when the  young man entered. It was Audrey. She ran to him and looked in his face! &ldquo;Is he&mdash;is  he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes!  He died a few minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Thank  God, he is safe from arrest, Dick,&rdquo; she caught his arm, &ldquo;did he tell you  anything?&rdquo; Her lips quivered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Everything.  You are poor; losing the money because of the illegitimacy.&rdquo; Lawson patted her  hand. &ldquo;We need not speak of that ever again, darling heart. We shall marry and  live here.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Here?  At Sarley Grange?&rdquo; Audrey looked bewildered.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Yes.  Your uncle left it and a large income to me on condition that I married you.  And so&rdquo;&mdash;he drew her into his arms&mdash;&ldquo;after a long journey under a clouded sky we  come at last into the sunshine.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Oh,  Dick! Dick!&rdquo; She nestled to him. &ldquo;And Gerald. He will be all right, for my dear  Jossy and he are going to be married. But, darling about this illegi&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
  <p>Lawson  drew her across the room, out of the French window and on to the lawn. Beyond  the circle of trees the sky was rosy, on the horizon it was spangled with  golden clouds. While they watched the lights grew more and more radiant, until  the sun leapt over the edge of the world to bathe the dewy verdure with  luminous splendor. With his arms round the girl he loved Dick pointed to the  glorious promise of day.</p>
  <p>&ldquo;Before  us is the light,&rdquo; he said solemnly, &ldquo;behind us the darkness. Never speak of the  past, Audrey; let it bury its dead. You are&mdash;you. That is all I care about.&rdquo;</p>
  <p>And  in the growing light, with myriad birds singing a welcome to their unclouded  future, he kissed her thrice on her sweet lips.</p>
