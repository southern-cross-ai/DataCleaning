  <p class="first">BERYL MERVILLE wrote:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Ronnie, We are back again from Italy, arriving this
  afternoon. Daddy thought you would be there to meet us, and I was so
  disappointed to find nobody but Mr. Steppe. Oh yes! I know that he is a most
  important person, and his importance was supported by his new car, such an
  impressive treasure, with a collapsible writing-table and cigar-lighter and
  library&mdash;actually a library in a cunning little locker under one of the
  seats. I just glanced at them. I am a little afraid of Mr. Steppe, yet he was
  kindness itself, and that bull voice of his, bellowing orders to porters, and
  chauffeurs, and railway policemen was comforting in a way. Daddy is a little
  plaintive on such occasions.</p>

  <p class="letter">I thought he was looking unusually striking; Steppe I mean.
  People certainly do look at him, with his black, pointed beard and his
  bristling black eyebrows. You like him, don't you? Perhaps I should, too,
  only&mdash;he is very magnetic, a commanding person, he frightens me, I
  repeat. And I have met another man; I don't think you know him, he said he
  had never met you. Daddy knows him rather well, and so does Mr. Steppe. Such
  a queer man, Ronnie! He arrived after daddy had gone to his club, to collect
  some correspondence. The maid came, and told me there was a strange man in
  the hall who said Dr. Merville had sent for him; so I went down to see him.
  He made the queerest impression on me. You will be amused, but not flattered,
  when I confess that the moment I saw him, I thought of you! I had a sort of
  warm impulse toward him. I felt as though I were meeting you, as I wanted you
  to be. That sounds feeble, and lame, but employing my limited vocabulary to
  the best of my poor ability, I am striving to reduce my mad impression to
  words.</p>

  <p class="letter">How mad it was, you'll understand. For, Ronnie, he was a
  stoutish man of middle-age&mdash;no more like you than I am like Mr. Steppe!
  Yet when I saw this shabbily-dressed person&mdash;the knees of his trousers
  shone, and the laces of his untidy boots were dragging&mdash;I just gasped.
  He sat squarely in one of the hall chairs, a big rough hand on each knee, and
  he was staring in an absent-minded way at the wall. He didn't even see me
  when I stood almost opposite to him. But his head, Ronnie! It was the head of
  a conqueror, one of those heroes of antiquity. You see their busts in the
  museums and wonder who they are. A broad eagle face, strangely dark, and on
  top a shock of grey-white hair brushed back into a mane. He had the most
  beautiful eyes I have ever seen in a man, and when they turned in my
  direction, and he got up from his chair, not awkwardly as I expected, but
  with the ease of an Augustus, there was within them so much loving kindness
  that I felt I could have cried. And please, Ronnie, do not tell me that I am
  neurotic and over-tired. I was just mad&mdash;nothing worse than that. I'm
  mad still, for I cannot get him out of my mind.</p>

  <p class="letter">His name is Ambrose Sault, and he is associated with daddy
  and Mr. Steppe, though I think that he is really attached to that horrid
  Greek person to whom daddy introduced me&mdash;Moropulos. What sort of work
  he does for Moropulos I have not discovered. There is always a great deal of
  mystery about Mr. Moropulos, and Mr. Steppe's business schemes. Sometimes I
  am very uncomfortable&mdash;which is a very mild way of describing my
  feelings&mdash;about daddy...and things. Ronnie, you have some kind of
  business dealings with father. What is it all about? I should so like to
  discover. It is to do with companies and corporations, isn't it? I know Mr.
  Steppe is a great financier, but I don't quite know how financiers work. I
  suppose I ought not to be curious, but it worries me&mdash;no, bothers is a
  better word, sometimes.</p>

  <p class="letter">Come and see me soon, Ronnie. I promise you I won't...you
  know. I've never forgiven myself for hurting you so. It was such a horrid
  story...I blame myself for listening, and hate myself for telling you. But
  the girl's brother was so earnest, and so terribly upset, and the girl
  herself was so wickedly circumstantial. You have forgiven me? It was my first
  experience of blackmailers, and I ought to have known you better and liked
  you better than to believe that you would be such a brute...and she was such
  a common girl, too..."</p>

  <p>She stopped writing and looked round. "Come in." The maid was
  straightening her face as she entered. "That gentleman, miss, Mr. Sault, has
  called."</p>

  <p>Beryl tapped her lips with the feathered pen holder. "Did you tell him
  that the doctor was out?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, miss. He asked if you were in. I told him I'd go and see." Something
  about the visitor had amused the girl, for the corners of her lips
  twitched.</p>

  <p>"Why are you laughing, Dean?" Beryl's manner was unusually cold and her
  grave eyes reproving. For no reason that she could assign, she felt called
  upon to defend this man, against the ridicule which she perceived in the
  maid's attitude.</p>

  <p>"Oh, miss, he was so strange! He said: 'Perhaps she will see me'. 'Do you
  mean Miss Merville?' says I. 'Merville!' he says in a queer way, 'of course,
  Beryl Merville', and then he said something to himself. It sounded like 'how
  pitiful'. I don't think he is quite all there, miss."</p>

  <p>"Show him up, please," said Beryl quietly. She recognized the futility of
  argument. Dean and her type found in the contemplation of harmless lunacy a
  subject for merriment...and Dean was the best maid she had had for years. She
  sat waiting for the man, uncertain...Why did she want to see him? She was not
  really curious by nature, and the crude manners of the class to which he
  belonged usually rubbed her raw. The foulness of their speech, the ugliness
  of their ideals and their lives; the gibberish&mdash;almost an unknown
  language to her&mdash;of the cockney man and woman, all these things grated.
  Perhaps she was neurotic after all; Ronnie was quite sure of his judgement in
  most matters affecting her.</p>

  <p>Ambrose Sault, standing in the doorway, hat in hand, saw her bite her
  lower lip reflectively. She looked round with a start of surprise, and,
  seeing him, got up. He was a coloured man! She had not realized this before,
  and she was unaccountably hurt; just coloured, and yet his eyes were
  grey!</p>

  <p>"I hope I haven't disturbed you, mademoiselle," he said. His voice was
  very soft and very sweet. Mademoiselle? A Creole...a Madagascan...an
  Octoroon? From one of the French foreign territories perhaps. He spoke
  English without an accent, but the 'mademoiselle' had come so naturally to
  his lips.</p>

  <p>"You are French, Mr. Sault...your name, of course..." She smiled at him
  questioningly and wondered why she troubled to ask questions at all.</p>

  <p>"No, mademoiselle." He shook his great head, and the mask of a face did
  not relax. "I am from Barbadoes, but I have lived in Port de France, that is,
  in Martinique, for many years. I was also in Noumea, in New Caledonia, that
  is also French." There was an awkward silence here. Yet he was not
  embarrassed and displayed no incertitude of his position. Her dilemma came
  from the fact that she judged men by her experience and acquaintance with
  them, and the empirical method fails before the unusual...Ambrose Sault was
  that.</p>

  <p>"My father will be home very soon, Mr. Sault. Won't you please sit
  down?"</p>

  <p>As he chose a chair with some deliberation it occurred to her that she
  would find a difficulty in explaining to the fastidious Dr. Merville why she
  had invited this man to await him in the drawing-room. Strangely enough, she
  herself felt the capacity of entertaining and being entertained by the
  visitor, and she had no such spasm of dismay as had come to her, when other,
  and more presentable visitors, had settled themselves for a lengthy call.
  This fact puzzled her. Ambrose Sault was...an artisan perhaps, a messenger,
  more likely. The shabbiness of his raiment and the carelessness of his attire
  suggested some menial position. One waistcoat button had been fastened into
  the wrong buttonhole; the result was a little grotesque. "Have you been
  working very long with my father?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No...not a very long time," he said. "Moropulos and Steppe know him
  better than I." He checked himself. She knew that he would not talk any more
  about his associates, and the enigma which their companionship presented
  would remain unsolved, so far as he could give a solution.
  'Moropulos'&mdash;'Steppe'? He spoke as an equal. Even Ronnie was deferential
  to Mr. Steppe, and was in awe of him. Her father made no attempt to hide his
  nervousness in the presence of that formidable person. Yet this man could
  dispense with the title. It was not bravado on his part, the conscious
  impertinence of an underling desirous of asserting his equality. Obviously he
  thought of Mr. Steppe as "Steppe'. What would he call her father? No occasion
  arose, but she was certain he would have been 'Merville' and no more.</p>

  <p>Sault's eyes were settled on her, absorbing her; yet his gaze lacked
  offence, being without hostility, or notable admiration. She had a ridiculous
  sensibility of praise. So he might have looked upon Naples from the sea, or
  upon the fields of narcissi above Les Avants, or the breathtaking loveliness
  of the hills of Monticattini in the blue afterlight of sunset. She could not
  meet his eyes...yet was without discomfort. The praise of his conspection was
  not human. She laughed, artificially, she thought, and reached out for a book
  that lay on the table. "We have just returned from Italy," she said. "Do you
  know Italy at all, Mr. Sault?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know Italy," he said, and took the book she held to him. "That
  is rather a wonderful account of Lombardy and its history," she said.
  "Perhaps you would like to read it?" He turned the leaves idly and smiled at
  her. She had never seen a man smile so sweetly.</p>

  <p>"I cannot read," he said simply. She did not understand his meaning for a
  while, thinking that his eyesight was failing.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you would care to take it home."</p>

  <p>He shook his head and the book came back to her. "I cannot read," he said,
  without shame, "or write&mdash;at least I cannot write words. Figures, yes,
  figures are easy; somebody told me&mdash;he was a Professor of English, I
  think, at one of the Universities&mdash;that it was astonishing that I could
  work out mathematical problems and employ all the signs and symbols of
  trigonometry and algebra without being able to write. I wish I could read.
  When I pass a bookshop I feel like an armless man who is starving within
  hands' reach of salvation. I know a great deal, and I pay a man to read to
  me&mdash;Livy and Prescott and Green and, of course, Bacon&mdash;I know them
  all. Writing does not worry me...I have no friends."</p>

  <p>If he had spoken apologetically, if he had displayed the least aggression,
  she might have classified and held him in a place. But he spoke of his
  shortcomings as he might have spoken of his grey hair: as a phenomenon beyond
  his ordering.</p>

  <p>She was thunderstruck; possibly he was so used to shocking people from
  this cause that he did not appear to observe the effect he had produced.</p>

  <p>He was so completely content with this, the first contact with his
  dream&mdash;woman, that he was almost incapable of receiving any other
  impression. Her hair was fairer than he had thought, her nose thinner, and
  the moulding of her delicate face was more spiritual. The lips redder and
  fuller, the rounded chin less firm. And her eyes...He wished she would turn
  her head so that he could be sure of their colour. They were big, set wide
  apart, there was depth in them and a something upon which he yearned. The
  figure of her he knew by heart. Straight and tall, and most gracious. A
  patrician; he thought of her as that. And Oriental. He had pictured her as a
  great lady at Constantine's court; he set her upon the marble terrace of a
  decent villa on the hills above Chrysopolis; a woman of an illustrious
  order.</p>

  <p>She could never suspect that he thought of her at all as a distinct
  personality. She could not guess that he knew her as well as his own right
  hand; that, day after day, he had waited in the Row, a shabby and
  inconspicuous figure amongst the smart loungers; waited for the benison of
  her presence. She had not seen him in Devon in the spring...he had been
  there. Living on the rain-soaked grass of Tapper Downs to watch her walking
  with her father; sitting amidst gorse on the steep slope of the cliff, she
  was unconscious of his guardianship, reading in her chair on the smooth
  beach.</p>

  <p>"How curious, I nearly said 'sad'. But you do not feel very sad about it,
  Mr. Sault, do you?"</p>

  <p>Amused, he shook his head. "It would be irritating," he said, "if I were
  sorry for myself. But I am never that. Half the unhappiness of life comes
  from the vanity of self-pity. It is the mother of all bitterness. Do you
  realize that? You cannot feel bitter without feeling sorry for yourself."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "You miss a great deal&mdash;but you know that. Poetry? I
  suppose you have that read to you?"</p>

  <p>Ambrose Sault laughed softly. "Yes&mdash;poetry."</p>

  <p>"Out of the dark which covers me,</p>

  <p>Black as a pit from Pole to Pole,</p>

  <p>I thank whatever gods there be,</p>

  <p>For my unconquerable soul."</p>

  <p>"That poem and Theocrite, and only two lines of Theocrite are the
  beginning and the end of my poetical leanings. I attend lectures, of course.
  Lectures on English, on architecture, music, history&mdash;especially
  history&mdash;oh, a hundred subjects. And mathematics. You can get those in
  the extension classes, only, unfortunately, I cannot qualify for admission to
  the classes themselves."</p>

  <p>"Have you never tried to&mdash;to..."</p>

  <p>"Read and write? Yes. My room is packed with little books and big books.
  A-b, ab; c-a-t, cat; and copy-books. But I just can't. I can write the
  letters of the alphabet, a few of them that are necessary for mathematical
  calculations, very well; but I cannot go any further. I seem to slip into a
  fog, a sort of impenetrable wall of thick mist, that confuses and baffles me.
  I know that c-a-t is 'cat', but when I see 'cat' written it is a meaningless
  combination of straight and curved lines. It is sheerly physical&mdash;the
  doctors have a word for it...I cannot remember what it is for the moment, I
  just can't read..."</p>

  <p>Dr. Merville came in at that moment, a thin, colourless man, myopic,
  irritable, chronically worried. He entered the drawing-room hurriedly. Beryl
  thought he must have run upstairs. His frowning, dissatisfied glance was
  toward Sault; the girl he ignored. "Hello, Sault&mdash;had no idea you were
  here. Will you come into my study?" He was breathless, and Beryl knew by the
  signs that he was angry about something. It occurred to her instantly that he
  was annoyed with her for entertaining the untidy visitor. The study was next
  door to the drawing-room, and he walked out with a beckoning jerk of his
  chin.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to have met you, mademoiselle." Ambrose Sault was not to be
  hurried. Returning to the open doorway, Dr. Merville, clucking his
  impatience, witnessed the leisurely leave-taking. The study door had scarcely
  closed on the visitor before it opened again and her father returned. "Why
  the deuce did you ask that fellow up, Beryl? He could have very well waited
  in the servants' hall&mdash;or in the breakfast-room, or anywhere.
  Suppose&mdash;somebody had called!"</p>

  <p>"I thought he was a friend of Mr. Steppe's," she said calmly. "You know
  such extraordinary people. What is he?"</p>

  <p>"Who, Sault? Well, he is..." Dr. Merville was not immediately prepared to
  define the position of his visitor. "In a sense, he is an employee of
  Moropulos&mdash;picked him up in his travels. He is an anarchist."</p>

  <p>She stared. "A what?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly an anarchist...communist...anyway, he has quaint views
  on&mdash;things. Believes in the equality of the human race. An extraordinary
  fellow, a dreamer, got a crazy idea of raising a million to found a college,
  that's what he calls it, The Mother College...can't stop now, darling, but
  please don't make a fuss of him. He is just a little difficult as it is. I
  will tell you about him some day."</p>

  <p>He bustled out of the room and the study door closed with a thud. Beryl
  Merville considered Ambrose Sault for a very long time before she turned to
  her writing-table where the unfinished letter to Ronald Morelle invited a
  conclusion.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap2"
     name="chap2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WELL, Sault, why have you come? Anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>Beryl would have thought Dr. Merville's manner strangely mild and
  conciliatory after his show of antagonism toward the visitor.</p>

  <p>Sault had seated himself on the edge of a low chesterfield under the
  curtained window. "Moropulos is worried about some people who called at his
  bureau today. They came to ask him about a letter that had been sent to him
  from South Africa by the assistant manager of the Brakfontein Diamond
  Mine."</p>

  <p>Merville was standing by the library-table, in the centre of the room. The
  hand that played with the leaves of a magazine was trembling ever so
  slightly. "What has happened...how did they know...who were they?" he
  demanded shakily.</p>

  <p>"I think it was the managing director&mdash;the American gentleman. He was
  very angry. They discovered that the manager had been receiving money from
  London soon after he made his report. Moropulos told me that the shares had
  dropped thirty points since yesterday morning. Mr. Divverly said that
  Moropulos and his gang&mdash;those were the words, I think&mdash;had bribed
  the manager to keep back the report that the mine was played out. I suppose
  he did. I know very little about stocks and shares."</p>

  <p>Dr. Merville was biting his knuckles, a weak and vacillating man; Sault
  had no doubts as to this, and it hurt him every time he realized that this
  invertebrate creature was Beryl Merville's father. How and why had he come
  into the strange confederation?</p>

  <p>"I can do nothing." The doctor was fretful, his voice jerky; he fixed and
  removed his pince-nez and fixed them again. "Nothing! I do not know why these
  people make inquiries. There was nothing dishonest in selling stock which you
  know will fall...it is a part of the process of speculation, isn't it, Sault?
  All the big houses work on secret information received or bought. If&mdash;if
  Moropulos or Steppe care to buy information, that is nobody's affair..."</p>

  <p>"There may be an inquiry on the Stock Exchange," said Sault calmly.
  "Moropulos asked me to tell you that. The Johannesburg committee have taken
  up the matter and have called for information. You see, the manager has
  confessed."</p>

  <p>"Confessed!" gasped the doctor, and went white.</p>

  <p>"So Mr. Divverly says. He had told the directors that Moropulos had the
  information a month before the directors."</p>

  <p>The doctor sat down heavily on the nearest chair. "I don't see&mdash;that
  it affects us," he protested feebly; "there is no offence in getting a tip
  about a failing property, is there, Sault?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Moropulos says it is conspiracy. They can prove it
  if..."</p>

  <p>"If?"</p>

  <p>"If they find the letters which the manager wrote. Moropulos has them in
  his desk."</p>

  <p>Merville sprang up. "Then they must be destroyed!" he cried violently. "It
  is madness to keep them...I had no idea&mdash;of course he must burn them. Go
  back and tell him to do this, Sault."</p>

  <p>Ambrose Sault put his hand into the fold of his shabby jacket and brought
  out a bundle of documents. "They are here," he said in a matter-of-fact tone.
  "Moropulos says that you must keep them. They may get a warrant to search his
  house."</p>

  <p>"Keep them&mdash;I?" Merville almost screamed. "Moropulos is a
  fool&mdash;burn them!"</p>

  <p>Sault shook his head. "Steppe says 'no'. They may be useful later. You
  must keep them, doctor. It is Steppe's wish. To-morrow I will start working
  on the safe."</p>

  <p>Dr. Merville took the papers from the outstretched hand and looked round
  helplessly. There was a steel box on his desk. He took out his key, looked
  again and more dubiously at the packet of letters, and dropped them into the
  box. "What is this safe, Sault? I know that you are a devilish clever fellow
  with your hands, and Moropulos mentioned something about a safe. You are not
  making it?"</p>

  <p>Sault nodded, and there was a gleam in his fine eyes.</p>

  <p>"But why? Moropulos has a safe and Steppe must possess dozens. Why not buy
  another, if he must have a special place for these wretched things?"</p>

  <p>"You cannot buy the safe that I shall make," said the dark man quietly.
  "It has taken me a year to invent the dial...eh? Yes. Combination. They are
  easy, but not this one. A word will open it, any other word, any other
  combination of letters, and there will be nothing to find."</p>

  <p>The doctor frowned. "You mean if any other person&mdash;the police, for
  example&mdash;try to open the safe, the contents are destroyed?"</p>

  <p>Sault nodded.</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>The visitor, his business at an end, rose. "That is simple, a twist of the
  hand, unless the combination is true, releases a quart of acid, any of the
  corrosive acids will serve."</p>

  <p>Merville bent his head in thought. Presently he saw a flaw in the
  invention. "Suppose they don't touch the lock?" he asked. "Suppose they burn
  out the side of the safe&mdash;it can be done, I believe&mdash;what
  then?"</p>

  <p>Ambrose Sault gave that soft laugh of his. "The sides will be hollow, and
  filled, from the inside of the safe, with water pumped in at a pressure. Cut
  through the safe, and the water escapes and releases a plunger that brings
  about the same result&mdash;the contents of the safe are destroyed."</p>

  <p>"You are a strange creature&mdash;the strangest I have met. I don't
  understand you," Merville shook his head. "I hope you will hurry with that
  safe." As Sault was at the door he asked: "Where did Moropulos find you,
  Sault?"</p>

  <p>The man turned. "He found me in the sea," he said. "Moropulos was trading
  in those days. He had a sloop&mdash;pearl smuggling, I think. I thought he
  had told you. I never make any secret about it."</p>

  <p>"In the sea&mdash;for heaven's sake, what do you mean? Where?"</p>

  <p>"Ten miles off the Isle of Pines. I got away from Noumea in a boat. Noumea
  is the capital of New Caledonia. I and three Canaques&mdash;they were under
  sentence for cannibalism. We ran into a cyclone and swamped, just as we were
  trying to make the sloop which was standing in to the lee of the island.
  Moropulos took me on board and the natives; when he found that I was a
  convict&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A convict...a French convict!"</p>

  <p>Sault was leaning easily, his cheek against the hand that gripped the edge
  of the open door. He nodded. "I thought he had told you. Of course he would
  have taken me back to Noumea for the reward, only he had a cargo on board
  which he did not want the French to see. I found afterwards that when we
  called at the Loyalty Island he tried to sell me back, but couldn't get a
  price." He smiled broadly as at a very pleasant recollection. "Moropulos
  would sell me now," he said, "only I am useful."</p>

  <p>"But why...why were you imprisoned?" asked Merville, awe-stricken at the
  tremendous revelation.</p>

  <p>"I killed a man," said Sault. "Good night, doctor."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap3"
     name="chap3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a Monday morning and a bank holiday. A few regular
  habitues of the park, to whom the word 'holiday' had no especial
  significance, had overlooked the fact and took their cantering exercise a
  little self-consciously under admiring eyes of the people who seldom saw
  people riding on horseback for the pleasure of it. The day was fine and warm,
  the hawthorn trees were thickly frosted with their cerise and white blossoms;
  stiff crocuses flamed in every bed, and the banners of the daffodils
  fluttered in the light breeze that blew half-heartedly across the wide green
  spaces. On every path the holiday-makers struggled, small mothers laden with
  large babies; shop-boys in garments secretly modelled on the supermen they
  served; girls from the stores in their bargain-price finery; young men with
  and without hats, the waitresses of closed tea-shops, and here and there a
  pompous member of the bourgeoisie conscious of his superiority to the crowd
  with which, in his condescension, he mingled.</p>

  <p>There is one shady place which faces Park Lane&mdash;a stretch of wooded
  lawn where garden-chairs are set six deep. Behind this phalanx there is an
  irregular fringe of seats, usually in couples, and greatly in request during
  the darker hours. In the early morning, before the energies of the
  promenaders are exhausted, the spot is deserted. But two young people
  occupied chairs this morning. There was nothing in the appearance of the girl
  that would have made the companionship seem incongruous. In her tailored
  costume, the unobtrusive hat and the simplicity of the toilette, she might as
  well have been the youngest daughter of a duke, or a work-girl with a
  judgement in dress. Her clothes would not be 'priced' by the most expert of
  woman critics, and even stockings and shoes, the last hope of the appraiser,
  would have baffled.</p>

  <p>No two glandes would have been required to put the man in his class. If he
  was a thought dandified, it was the dandification of a gentleman. He looked
  what he was, a man of leisure; the type which is to be found in the Guards,
  or the smartest regiment of cavalry. Yet Ronald Morelle was no soldier. He
  had served during the war, but had seen none of its devastations. He hated
  the violence of battle and despised the vulgarity of a noisy patriotism. His
  knowledge of Italian had secured him a quasi-diplomatic appointment,
  nominally at Italian headquarters, actually in Rome. He had used every
  influence that could be employed, pulled every string that could be pulled,
  to keep him from the disorder of the front line, and fortune had favoured him
  to an extraordinary extent. On the very day he received instructions to
  report to the regiment with which he had trained, the armistice was signed...
  he saw the last line of trenches which the British had prepared, but never
  occupied, south of Amiens, saw them from the train that carried him home, and
  thought that they looked beastly uncomfortable.</p>

  <p>The girl by his side would not be alone in thinking him good-looking. He
  was that rarity, a perfectly-featured man. His skin was faultless; his
  straight nose, his deep-set brown eyes, his irreproachable mouth, were
  excellent. The hypercritical might cavil at the almost feminine chin. A small
  brown moustache was probably responsible for the illusion that he favoured
  the profession of arms. Evie Colebrook thought he was the most beautiful man
  in the world, and when he smiled, as he was smiling now, she dared not look
  at him. He was talking about looks, and she was deliciously flattered. "How
  ridiculous you are, Mr. Morelle," she protested. "I suppose you have said
  that to thousands and thousands of girls?"</p>

  <p>"Not quite so many, Evie," he answered. "To be exact, I can't remember
  having been so shamelessly complimentary to any girl before. You need not
  call me 'Mr. Morelle' unless you wish to&mdash;my friends call me
  'Ronnie'."</p>

  <p>She played with the handkerchief on her lap. "It seems so familiar.
  Honestly, Ronnie, aren't you rather...what is the word? The book you lent
  me...a play?"</p>

  <p>"A philanderer?" suggested the other. "My dear child, how silly you are.
  Of course I'm not. Very few people have impressed me as you have. It must
  have been Fate that took me into Burts&mdash;I never go into shops, but
  Francois&mdash;that's my man&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know him," she nodded, "he often comes in. I used to wonder who he
  was."</p>

  <p>"He was out and I wanted...I forget what it was I wanted, even forget
  whether I bought it. I must have done, otherwise I should not have found
  myself staring over a pay-desk at the most lovely girl in all the world."</p>

  <p>She laughed, a gurgling laugh of sheer happiness, and looked at him
  swiftly before she dropped her eyes again. "I like to hear that," she said
  softly. "It is so wonderful...that you like me, I mean. Because I'm nothing,
  really. And you, you're a...well, gentleman. I know you hate the word, but
  you are. Miles and miles above me. Why, I live in a miserable little house in
  a horrible neighbourhood...full of thieves and terrible creatures who drink.
  And my mother does odd jobs for people. And I'm not very well educated...
  really. I can read and write, but I'm not half so clever as Christina, that
  is my sister. She's an invalid and reads all day, and all night too, if I'd
  let her."</p>

  <p>He was watching her as she spoke. The play of colour in her pretty face,
  the rise and fall of her narrow chest, the curve of chin and the velvet
  smoothness of her throat...he marked them all with the eye of the gourmet who
  watches lambs frisking in the pasture and sees not the poetry and beauty of
  young life, but a likeable dish that will one day mature. "If you were a
  beggar-maid and I were a prince..." he began.</p>

  <p>"I'm not much better, am I?" she asked ruefully, "and you are a prince, to
  me, Ronnie..." She was thinking.</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"How can anything come right for us? I don't want to think about it, and I
  try ever so hard to keep it out of my thoughts, I'm so happy...meeting
  you...and loving you...and tomorrow never comes, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean how will this dear friendship end?" She nodded. "How would you
  like it to end?"</p>

  <p>Evie Colebrook poked the ferrule of her sunshade into the grass and turned
  up a tuft of clover. "There is only one way it can ever end&mdash;happily,"
  she said in a low voice, "and that is well, you know, Ronnie."</p>

  <p>He laughed. "With you in a beautiful white dress and a beautiful white
  veil and a wreath of orange blossom round your glorious hair, and a priest in
  a surplice reading from a book; and people watching you as you go down the
  aisle and saying&mdash;well, you know what they say. I think a wedding is the
  most uninteresting function which Society affects."</p>

  <p>She said nothing, but continued prodding at the turf. "It can be done
  quietly," she said at last.</p>

  <p>Leaning toward her, he slipped his hand under her arm. "Evie, is love
  nothing?" he asked earnestly, "isn't it the biggest thing? Which is the best,
  a wedding between two people who half hate one another, but are marrying
  because one wants money and the other a swagger wife, or an everlasting
  love-union between a man and a woman who are bound with bonds that cannot
  break?"</p>

  <p>She sighed, the quick, double sigh of one half convinced. "You make me
  feel that I'm common and...and brainless, and, anyway, I don't want to talk
  about it. Ronnie, I suppose you're awfully busy this morning?" She looked
  wistfully at the big Rolls that was drawn up by the side of the road.</p>

  <p>"I am rather," he said, "I wish I weren't. I'd love to drive you
  somewhere&mdash;anywhere so long as you were by my side, little fairy. When
  shall I see you again?"</p>

  <p>"On Sunday?" she asked, as they strolled toward the car.</p>

  <p>"Why not come up to the flat to tea on Saturday afternoon?" he suggested,
  but she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I'd rather not, Ronnie&mdash;do you mind? I...well, I don't want to
  somehow. Am I an awful pig?"</p>

  <p>He smiled down on her. "Of course not...oh, damn!" A girl on a horse had
  just cantered past. She saw him and lifted her whip to acknowledge his raised
  hat.</p>

  <p>"Who is that?" Evie was more than curious.</p>

  <p>"A girl I know," he said suavely. "The daughter of my doctor, and rather a
  gossip."</p>

  <p>"You're ashamed of being seen with me."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" he laughed. "I am so proud of you that I wish she had stopped,
  confound her!" He took her hand and smiled into her eyes. "Good-bye,
  beloved," he breathed.</p>

  <p>Evie Colebrook watched the car until it had turned out of sight. It was
  following the gossiping girl, but she did not care. She went home walking on
  air. At the corner of the Row, the big car drew abreast of the rider. "Why on
  earth are you riding on Bank Holiday, Beryl&mdash;the park is full of louts,
  and there aren't half a dozen people in the Row!"</p>

  <p>Beryl Merville looked at him quizzically. "And why on earth are you in the
  park, Ronnie; and who was your beautiful little friend?"</p>

  <p>He frowned. "Friend...? Oh, you mean the girl I was speaking to? Would you
  call her beautiful?...yes, I suppose she is pretty, but quite a kid. Her
  father is an old friend of mine&mdash;colonel&mdash;I forget his name, he is
  something at the War Office. I have an idea they live near the park. I saw
  her walking, and stopped the car to talk to her. Frankly, I was so bored that
  I almost fell on her neck. I wasn't with her for five minutes."</p>

  <p>Beryl nodded and dismissed the matter from her mind. She was more
  interested in another subject.</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear, I had your letter. I'm an awful brute not to have come over
  and seen you. But the fact is, I have been working hard. Don't sneer, Beryl.
  I really have. Sturgeon, the editor of the Post Herald, has discovered in me
  a latent genius for writing. It is rather fun...apparently I have a flair for
  that kind of work."</p>

  <p>"But, Ronnie, this is great news! Stop your car by the corner and find a
  man to hold my horse...there is an awful lot I want to talk to you about." He
  parked his car, and, helping her dismount, handed the reins to an idle groom.
  A watchful attendant drew near. "You will have to pay for the seats, Ronnie,
  I have no money."</p>

  <p>"Happily I have two tickets," he said, and realized his mistake before he
  drew them from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I thought you hadn't been with your colonel's daughter more than five
  minutes?" she challenged, and laughed. "I sometimes think that you'd rather
  lie than eat!"</p>

  <p>"My dear Beryl." Mr. Morelle's tone revealed both shock and injury. "Did I
  say that I didn't sit with her? I couldn't be so uncivil as to expect her to
  stand. The fact is, that she hinted that she would like me to drive her round
  the park, and I had no wish to."</p>

  <p>"Never mind your guilty secret," she said gaily, "tell me all about your
  new job. Poor Ronnie, so they have made you work at last! I feared this."</p>

  <p>Ronnie smiled good-naturedly. "It is amusing," he said. "I was always
  rather keen on that kind of work, even when I was at Oxford. Sturgeon saw
  some verses of mine in one of the quarterlies, and asked me if I would care
  to describe a motor-car race...the Gordon Bennett Cup. I took it on and he
  seemed immensely pleased with the account I wrote. I feel that I am doing
  some poor devil out of a job, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"But it doesn't keep you awake at nights," she finished. "But how lovely,
  Ronald. You will be able to describe Mr. Steppe's trial...everybody says that
  one of these days he will be tried..."</p>

  <p>Ronald Morelle was not amused. She saw a frown gather on his forehead and
  remembered that he and Mr. Steppe had some association. "Of course I'm
  joking, Ronnie. How awfully touchy you are! Mr. Steppe is quite nice, and
  people invariably say unpleasant things about a successful man."</p>

  <p>"Steppe..." he paused. There was a nervousness in his manner and in his
  tone which he could not disguise. "Steppe is quite a good fellow. A little
  rough, but he was trained in a rough school. He is very nearly the cleverest
  financier in this country or any other." He would have changed the
  conversation had she not interpolated a question. "I do not know him...Sault
  you said? No, I've never met him. He does odd jobs for Moropulos. A
  half-caste, isn't he? What a nerve the fellow had to come to the house! Why
  didn't you kick him out?"</p>

  <p>"It is obvious that you haven't seen him or you wouldn't ask such a
  question," she replied, her eyes twinkling.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what he does," Ronnie went on. "Steppe has a good opinion of
  him. That is all I know. He has three decorations for something he did in the
  war. He was in the Field Ambulance and brought in a lot of people from No-
  Man's-Land. He is quite old, isn't he?" She nodded. "Moropulos isn't anything
  to boast about. Steppe likes him, though." Apparently the cachet of Mr.
  Steppe satisfied Ronnie in all things. "He's a Greek...you've met him? A
  sleek devil. They say that he's afraid of Sault, except when he is
  drunk."</p>

  <p>"Ronnie!"</p>

  <p>"A fact. Moropulos drinks like a fish. Absinthe and all sorts of stuff.
  Steppe told me. That is why this nigger fellow Sault is useful. Sault is the
  only man who can handle him. He's as strong as an ox. There isn't a smarter
  devil than Moropulos. He has the brain of a Cabinet Minister, and is as close
  as an oyster. But when the fit is on him he'd stand up in the street and talk
  himself into gaol. And others...not Steppe, of course," he added hastily,
  "Steppe has nothing to be afraid of, only...well, Moropulos might say things
  that would look bad."</p>

  <p>"And is that all?" she asked, with an odd sense of disappointment.
  "Doesn't Mr. Sault do anything else but act as an sort of keeper?"</p>

  <p>Ronnie, already weary of the subject, yawned behind his hand. "Awfully
  sorry, but I was up late last night. Sault? Oh yes, I believe he does odd
  jobs. He is rather an ugly brute, isn't he?"</p>

  <p>She did not answer this. Her interest in the man puzzled her. He appealed
  in a strange fashion to something within her that was very wholesome. She was
  glad, very glad, about his war decorations. That he should have done fine
  things...she liked to forget Ronnie's war services. "I wish I had decided to
  ride this morning," complained Ronnie. "I never dreamt you would be out on a
  day like this. Why I came into the park at all I really do not know. I didn't
  realize it was a bank holiday and that all these dreadful people would be
  unchained for the day. How is the doctor&mdash;well?" She nodded. "He looked
  a little peaked when I saw him last. Look, Beryl...Steppe!" A car, headed for
  Marble Arch, had swerved across the road in response to the signal of its
  occupant. It pulled up behind Ronald's machine, and Mr. Steppe, with his
  queer sideways smile, alighted, waving a white-gloved hand. "Oh, dear," said
  Beryl plaintively, "why did I get off that horse? I could have pretended that
  I had not recognized him."</p>

  <p>"My dear girl!" Ronald was genuinely distressed, and it came to Beryl in
  the nature of an unpleasant discovery that he was so completely in awe of the
  financier, that his manner, his attitude, the very tone of his voice, changed
  at the sight of him. And Steppe seemed to expect this homage, took it as his
  right, dismissed and obliterated Ronnie from participation with a jerk of his
  head intended as an acknowledgement of his greeting and as an excusal of his
  presence. Beryl could not help realizing his unimportance in the
  millionaire's scheme of life.</p>

  <p>The photographs of Jan Steppe, which have from time to time appeared in
  the public press, at once flatter and disparage him. The lens has depicted
  faithfully the short black beard, the thick black eyebrows, the broad nose
  and the thick bull-neck of him. They missed his immense vitality, the aura of
  power which enveloped him, his dominant and forceful ego. His voice was thick
  and deep, sometimes in moments of excitement, guttural, for his grandfather
  had been a Transvaal boer, a byworner who had become, successively, farmer
  and mine-owner. Jan Cornelius Steppe, the first, had spoken no English, his
  son, Commandant Steppe, an enlightened and scholarly man, spoke it well. He
  had been killed at Tugela Drift in the war, whilst Jan the third was in
  England at a preparation school.</p>

  <p>"Huh! Beryl! Very good luck, huh? I shall miss my train, but it is worth
  while. Riding? God! I wish I wasn't so fat and lazy. Motor-cars are the ruin
  of us. My grandfather rode twenty miles a day and my father was never off a
  horse. Huh!"</p>

  <p>Beryl often asked her father why Mr. Steppe grunted at the end of his
  every question. But it was not a grunt. It was a throaty growl cut short, a
  terrifying mannerism of his, meaningless but menacing. She used to wonder
  whether the impression of ruthless ferocity which he gave was not more than
  half due to this peculiarity. He towered above her, a mountain of a man,
  broad of shoulder and long of arm. There was something simian about him,
  something that was almost obscene. He was fond of describing himself as fat,
  but this was an exaggeration. He had bulk, he was in the truest sense gross,
  but she would not have described him as fat.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," he commanded, "I haven't seen you since Friday. The doctor
  came in yesterday morning. Nerves, huh? What's the matter with him?"</p>

  <p>Beryl laughed. "Father receives a great deal of misplaced sympathy. He is
  really very well. He has been jumpy ever since I can remember."</p>

  <p>Steppe nodded. He was sitting by her side in the chair vacated by Ronnie,
  and Ronnie was standing. "Sit down, Ronnie." She pointed to a chair at the
  other side of her. "N&mdash;no thank you, Beryl," he said hastily, for all
  the world like a schoolboy asked to sit in the presence of his master.</p>

  <p>"Sit down," growled Steppe, and, to the girl's amazement, Ronnie sat. It
  was the only notice Jan Steppe took of his presence throughout the interview,
  and Ronnie neither showed resentment nor made the slightest attempt to
  intrude into the conversation that followed. Presently Steppe looked at his
  watch. "I can catch that train," he said, and got up. "You're coming to
  dinner with me next week&mdash;I'll fix the date with the doctor." She said
  she would be delighted. Something of the mastership extended to her. "You saw
  Sault?" He turned back after he had taken her hand. "Queer fellow, huh? Big
  man, huh?"</p>

  <p>"I thought he was...interesting," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"Yes...interesting. A man." He glowered at Ronald Morelle. "Interesting,"
  he repeated, and went away with that. Her fascinated gaze followed him as he
  strode toward the car. "Paddington...get me there, damn you," she heard him
  say; and when the car had gone...</p>

  <p>"Dynamic," she said, with a sigh. "He is like a power-house. When I shake
  hands with him I feel as though I'm going to get a bad burn! You were very
  silent, Ronnie."</p>

  <p>"Yes"&mdash;absently. "Old Steppe is rather a shocker, isn't he? How did
  he know you had seen Sault?"</p>

  <p>"Father told him, I suppose. Ronnie, are you afraid of Mr. Steppe?"</p>

  <p>He coloured. "Afraid? How stupid you are, Beryl! Why should I be afraid of
  him? He's...well, I do business with him. I am a director of a company or
  two; he put me into them. One has to&mdash;how shall I put it? One has to be
  polite to these people. I'll go along now, Beryl...lot of work to do."</p>

  <p>He was uncomfortable and she did not pursue the subject. The knowledge
  brought a little ache to her heart&mdash;that Ronnie was afraid of Jan
  Steppe! She would have given her soul to respect Ronald Morelle as she
  respected the swarthy grey-haired man whom even Steppe respected.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap4"
     name="chap4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"CHILDREN," said Mrs. Colebrook, peering into the saucepan
  that bubbled and splashed and steamed on the kitchen fire, "are a great
  responsibility...especially in this neighbourhood where, as you might say,
  there is nothing but raffle." Sometime in her youth, it is probable that Mrs.
  Colebrook had to choose between 'rabble' and 'riff-raff' and had found a
  compromise. "That man Starker who lives up the street, number 39 I think it
  is...no maybe it's 37&mdash;it is the house before the sweep's. Well, I did
  think he was all right; geraniums in his window, too, and canaries. A very
  homely man, wouldn't say boo to a goose. He got nine months this
  morning."</p>

  <p>Ambrose Sault, sitting in a wooden chair which was wedged tightly between
  the kitchen table and the dresser, drummed his fingers absently upon the
  polished cloth table-cover and nodded. His dark sallow face wore an
  expression of strained interest. "Evie...well, I'm worried about Evie. She
  sits and broods&mdash;there's no other word for it&mdash;by the hour, and she
  used to be such a bright, cheerful girl. I wonder sometimes if it is through
  her working at the drug-stores. Being attached to medicines in a manner of
  speaking, you're bound to hear awful stories...people's insides and all that
  sort of thing. It is depressing for a young girl. Christina says she talks in
  her sleep and moans and tosses about. It can't be over a young man, or she'd
  bring him home. I asked her the other day&mdash;I think a girl's best friend
  is her mother&mdash;and all I got was, 'Oh, shut up, mother'. In my young
  days I wouldn't have dared to speak to my mother like that, but girls have
  changed. They want to go to business, cashiering and typewriting and such
  nonsense. I went out to service when I was sixteen and was first parlourmaid
  before I was twenty. But talk to these girls about going into domestic
  service and they laugh at you."</p>

  <p>A silence followed which Sault felt it was his duty to break. "I suppose
  they do. Life is very hard on women, even the most favoured of women. I
  hardly blame them for getting whatever happiness they can."</p>

  <p>"Happiness!" scoffed Mrs. Colebrook, shifting the saucepan to the hob, "it
  all depends on what you call 'happiness.' I don't see much happiness in
  standing in a draughty shop taking money all day and adding up figures and
  stamping bills! Besides, look at the temptation. She meets all kinds of
  people..."</p>

  <p>"I think I'll go upstairs to my room, Mrs. Colebrook. I want to do a
  little work."</p>

  <p>"You're a worker," said Mrs. Colebrook admiringly. "I'll call you when
  supper is ready."</p>

  <p>"May I walk in to see Christina?"</p>

  <p>He asked permission in the same words every night and received the same
  answer. "Of course you can; you need never ask, Mr. Sault. She'll be glad to
  see you."</p>

  <p>At the head of the narrow stairway Sault knocked on a door and a cheerful
  voice bade him come in. It was a small room containing two beds. That which
  was nearest the window was occupied by a girl whose pallor was made more
  strangely apparent by a mop of bright red hair. Over her head, and hooked to
  the wall, was a kerosene lamp of unusual design and brilliance. She had been
  reading and one white hand lay over the open page of a book by her side.
  Sault looked up at the lamp, touched the button that controlled the light and
  peered into the flame. "Working all right?"</p>

  <p>"Fine," she said enthusiastically. "You're a brick, Ambrose, to make it. I
  had no idea you could do anything like that. Mother won't touch it, she
  thinks it will explode."</p>

  <p>"It can't explode," he said, shaking his head. "These vapour gas lamps are
  safe, unless you fool with them. Have it put outside the door in the morning
  and I'll fill it. Well, where have you been today, Christina?"</p>

  <p>She showed her small white teeth in a smile. "To Etruria," she said
  solemnly. "It is the country that was old when Rome was young. I went on an
  exploring expedition. We left Croydon Aerodrome by aeroplane and stayed
  overnight in Paris. My fiance is a French marquess, and we stayed at his
  place in the Avenue Kleber. The next morning we went by special train to
  Rome. I visited the Coliseum by car and saw the temples and the ruins. I
  spent another day at the Vatican and St. Peters and saw the Pope. Then we
  went on to Volsinii and Tarquinii and I found a wonderful old tomb full of
  glorious Etruscan ware. Plates and amphoras and vases. They must have been
  worth millions. There we met a magician. He lived in an old ruined house on
  the side of the hill. He had a flock of goats and gave us milk. It was magic
  milk for suddenly we found ourselves in the midst of an enormous marble city
  full of beautiful men and women in togas and wonderful robes. The streets
  were filled with rich chariots drawn by little horses. The chariots shone
  like gold and were covered with figures of lions and hunters and trees and
  scrolls...wonderful! And the gardens! They were beautiful. Flowers of every
  kind, heliotrope, and roses, and big white trumpet lilies, and the marble
  houses were covered with wisteria...oh, dear!"</p>

  <p>"Etruria?" repeated Sault thoughtfully. "Older than Rome? Of course, there
  must have been people before the Romans, the sort of ancient Britons of
  Rome..."</p>

  <p>Her eyes, fixed on his, were gleaming with merriment. "Of course. I told
  you about the marvellous trip I had to China? When I was the lovely concubine
  of Yang-Kuei-Fee? And how the eunuchs strangled me? That was long after Rome,
  but China was two thousand years old then."</p>

  <p>"I remember," he said soberly, "you went to China once before then..."</p>

  <p>His glance fell on the pages of the book, and he picked it up, turning its
  meaningless leaves. "It is all about Etruria," she said. "Evie borrowed it
  from the store. They have a circulating library at the store. Have you seen
  Evie?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head. "Not for weeks," he said. "I am usually in my room when
  she comes home." Christina Colebrook, invalid and visionary, puckered her
  smooth brows into a frown. She had emerged from her world of dreams and make-
  belief and was facing the ugliness of life that eddied about her bed. "Evie
  is changed quite a lot," she said. "She is quieter and dresses more
  carefully. Not in the way you would notice. She always had good taste, but
  especially in the way of underclothes. All girls adore swagger underclothes.
  They live in dread that one day they will be knocked down by a motor-bus and
  taken in hospital wearing a shabby camisole! But Evie...she's collecting all
  sorts of things. You might think she was getting together a trousseau. Has
  she ever spoken to you about anybody called 'Ronnie'?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;she never speaks to me." said Ambrose.</p>

  <p>"You know nobody called 'Ronnie'?" He signified his ignorance. At the
  moment he did not associate the name.</p>

  <p>"She talks in her sleep." Christina went on slowly, "and she's spoken that
  name lots of times. I haven't told mother; what would be the good with her
  heart as it is? 'Ronnie' is the man who is worrying her. I think she is in
  love with him or what she thinks is love. And he is somebody in a good
  station of life because once she called out in the middle of the night.
  'Ronnie, take me in your car.'"</p>

  <p>Sault was silent. This was the first time Christina had ever spoken to him
  about the girl.</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing that can happen," said she wisely, "and that
  would break mother's heart. Mother has very narrow views. The people of our
  class have. I should feel that way myself if I hadn't seen the world," she
  patted the book by her side. "Perhaps mother's view is right. She is
  respectable and the old Roman Emperor Constantine, when he classified the
  nobility, made the 'respectable' much superior to the 'honourable'."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean...about Evie?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that she'll come to me one night and tell me that she is in
  trouble. And then I shall have to get mother into a philosophical mood and
  try to make her see that it is better for a child to be illegitimate than not
  to be born at all."</p>

  <p>"Good gracious!" said Ambrose, startled. "But it may be...just a
  friendship."</p>

  <p>"Rats!" said Christina contemptuously. "Friendships between attractive
  shop-girls and well-to-do young men! I've heard about 'em&mdash;platonic.
  Have you ever heard of Archianassa? She was Plato's mistress. He didn't even
  practice the kind of love that is named after him. Evie is a good girl and
  has really fine principles. I shock her awfully at times; I wish I didn't. I
  don't mean I wish I didn't say things that make her shocked, but that she
  wouldn't be shocked at all. You have to have a funny kink in your mind before
  you take offence at the woman and man facts. If you blush easily, you fall
  easily. I wish to God Evie wasn't so pretty. And she's a dear, too, Ambrose.
  She has great schemes for getting me away to a country where my peculiar
  ailment will dissolve under uninterrupted sunlight. Poor darling. It would be
  better if she thought more of her own dangerous sickness..."</p>

  <p>"Ronald Morelle," said Ambrose suddenly, "but it wouldn't be he."</p>

  <p>"Who is Ronald Morelle?"</p>

  <p>"He is the only Ronald I know. I don't even know him. He's a friend of
  a...a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"Rich&mdash;where does he live?"</p>

  <p>"In Knightsbridge somewhere."</p>

  <p>Christina whistled. "Glory be! Evie's shop is in Knightsbridge!"</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock that night Evie Colebrook came into the room, and, as
  she stooped over the bed to kiss her sister, Christina saw something. "You've
  been crying, Evie."</p>

  <p>Evie turned away quickly and began to unfasten her skirt. "I...I twisted
  my ankle...slipped off the sidewalk...I was a baby to cry!"</p>

  <p>Christina watched her as she undressed rapidly. "You haven't said your
  prayers, Evie."</p>

  <p>"Damn my prayers!" There was a little choke at the end. "Put out the
  light, Christina, I'm awfully tired."</p>

  <p>Christina reached up for the dangling chain that Ambrose Sault had fixed
  to the lamp, but she did not immediately pull it. "Mr. Sault was talking
  about people he knew tonight," she said carelessly. "Have you ever heard of a
  man called Ronald Morelle?"</p>

  <p>There was no answer, then..."Good night, Christina." Christina pulled the
  chain and the light went out.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap5"
     name="chap5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BERYL MERVILLE told herself, at least once a day, that the
  average girl did not give two thoughts about the source of her father's
  income. In her case, there was less reason why she should trouble her head.
  Dr. Merville had retired from practice four years before. In his time, he was
  what is loosely described as 'a fashionable physician' and certainly was
  regarded as one of the first authorities of cardiac diseases in the country.
  His practice, as a consultant, was an extensive one, and his fees were
  exceptionally high, even for a fashionable physician. When he retired he was
  indubitably a rich man. He sold his house in Devonshire Street and bought a
  more pretentious home in Park Place, but...</p>

  <p>The zest for speculation, repressed during the time he was following his
  profession, had occupied the hours of leisure which retirement brought to
  him. An active man, well under sixty, the emptiness of his days after he had
  turned over his work filled him with dismay. He had broken violently from the
  routine of twenty-five years and found time the heaviest of the burdens he
  had ever carried. He tried to find interests and failed. He was under an
  agreement to the doctor who had purchased his practice not to return to his
  profession, or he would have been back in Devonshire Street a month after he
  had left. He bought a few thoroughbreds and sent them to a trainer, but he
  had no love for the Turf, and although he won a few respectable stakes, he
  quitted the game at the end of the first season.</p>

  <p>Then he tried the stock market, made a few thousands in oil and grew more
  interested. A rubber speculation hurt him, but not so much that his
  enthusiasm was damped or his bank balance was seriously affected. He followed
  this loss with what might have been a disastrous investment in South African
  Mines. Then, at a nerve-wracking moment, came Steppe, who held up the market
  and let out Merville, bruised and shaken, but not ruinously so. Here might
  have ended the speculative career of Dr. Merville, had he not been under an
  obligation to the South African. Within a month of their meeting, the
  doctor's name appeared on the prospectus of one of Steppe's companies&mdash;a
  mild and unromantic Cold Storage flotation which was a success in every
  sense.</p>

  <p>Merville had many friends in Society; people who might look askance at the
  name of Jan Steppe, and be disturbed by the recollection of certain other
  companies which that gentleman had floated, accepted Dr. Merville's
  directorship as evidence of the company's stability and financial soundness.
  The issue was over-subscribed and paid a dividend from the first year.</p>

  <p>This object lesson was not lost upon the big man. He followed the
  promotion with another. The East Rand Consolidated Deep was floated for
  three-quarters of a million. Applications came in for two millions. Dr.
  Merville was chairman of the board. Even Jan Steppe was surprised. Large as
  was the circle of Merville's acquaintances, neither his personal popularity
  nor his standing as a financial authority could account for this overwhelming
  success. Merville himself discounted his own influence, not realizing that in
  the twenty-five years of professional life he had built up a national
  reputation. His name had been a household word since his treatment of a
  foreign royalty whose case had been regarded by native physicians as
  hopeless. This may not have been a complete explanation; probably the fact
  that the stock in the Cold Storage Company stood at a premium had something
  to do with the rush for Consolidated Deeps.</p>

  <p>The new company did not pay dividends, but long before the first was due,
  Mr. Steppe had launched two others. On paper Dr. Merville made a fortune;
  actually, he acquired heavy liabilities, not the least of which was his heavy
  participation in a private flotation which Mr. Steppe, with unconscious
  humour, labelled 'The Investment Salvage Syndicate'. It was a stock-holding
  company and in the main it held such stock as a general public declined to
  purchase.</p>

  <p>There are rules of behaviour which normal people do not transgress. A
  gentleman does not search the overcoat pockets of his fellow club-men, and
  confiscate such valuables as he may find; nor does he steal into the houses
  of people he does not know and remove their silver. A corporation man has a
  less rigid code. Dr. Merville found himself consciously assisting in the
  manipulation of a stock, a manipulation which could only be intended to
  deprive stockholders of their legitimate rights. There was one unpleasant
  moment of doubt and shame when Merville sought to disentangle his
  individuality from this corporative existence. He tried to think singly,
  applying the tests which had governed his life...he found it easier to divide
  his responsibility. Somehow he felt less venal when only a fourteenth of the
  blame attached to him. This fraction represented his holding in Consolidated
  Deeps.</p>

  <p>Wealth is an effective narcotic. Rich and fearless men can find a
  melancholy pleasure in the contemplation of their past sins. But poverty and
  the danger of poverty acts as a microphone through the medium of which the
  still small voice of conscience is a savage roar. Beryl thought he was
  unusually nervous when she went to find him in his study. He started at the
  sound of her voice. "Ready...yes, dear. What time did Steppe say?"</p>

  <p>"Eight o'clock. We have plenty of time, father&mdash;the car isn't here
  yet. Do you know whether Ronnie will be there?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Merville was looking abstractedly at her; his mind, she knew, was very
  far away. "Ronnie? I don't know. John Maxton will be there. I saw him today.
  Steppe admires him and John is clever; he will be a judge one of these days.
  Yes...a judge." The little grimace he made was involuntary.</p>

  <p>"One would think you expected to meet him in his official capacity," she
  laughed.</p>

  <p>"Absurd, of course...as to Ronnie? How do you feel about him, Beryl?"</p>

  <p>The maid tapped at the door to say the car had arrived. Beryl answered:
  "Do you mean&mdash;? I don't quite know what you do mean."</p>

  <p>"About the scandal. Do you remember a man who came to see you&mdash;why he
  should have come to you, I don't know&mdash;with a story about his
  sister?"</p>

  <p>"East was the name. Yes, Ronnie told me all about it. The man is a
  blackmailer and his sister was not much better. Ronnie had shown a kindness
  to the girl, he met her at some...some mission or other. Ronnie does queer
  things like that...and he gave her some money to go on a holiday. That was
  all."</p>

  <p>"Humph...ready?"</p>

  <p>"But, daddy, don't you believe Ronnie?" She was desperately anxious to
  consolidate her own faith.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Ronnie is a queer fellow." He was ready to go, his overcoat
  was over his arm, and yet he lingered. She guessed he would say something
  more about Ronald Morelle and was stiffening to defend him, but she was
  mistaken. "Beryl, you are twenty-two and very beautiful. I may be biased, but
  I hardly think I am. I have seen many lovely women in my life and you could
  hold your own with any of them. Do you ever think of getting married?"</p>

  <p>She tried hard to control herself, but the colour in her face deepened and
  faded. "I haven't thought much about it," she said. "There are two parties to
  a marriage, daddy."</p>

  <p>"Are you fond of anybody? I mean are you, in your heart...committed to any
  man?"</p>

  <p>A pause, then: "No."</p>

  <p>"I'm glad," said her father, relieved. "Very glad...you must look for
  something in a man which fellows like Ronnie Morelle can never give to a
  woman...power, fortune, mental strength and stability...come along."</p>

  <p>She followed him to the car, dumb with astonishment, but not at that
  moment apprehensive. She knew that he had been talking of Jan Steppe.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap6"
     name="chap6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. STEPPE had a house in Berkeley Square which he rented
  from its lordly owner. Beryl had dined there before, and it had been a
  baffling experience, for in no respect did the personality of the tenant find
  an opportunity of expressing itself. The furnishings and colour-schemes of
  the landlord had been left as they had been found, and, since the atmosphere
  of the place was late Victorian, Mr. Steppe was unconformable to his
  surroundings. Beryl thought of him as a sultan amidst samplers. Sir John
  Maxton was talking to him when they were announced. One of the greatest
  advocates at the bar, Maxton was tall, slender, aesthetic. His gentle manner
  had led many a confident witness into trouble. He had a reputation at the Bar
  as a just and merciless man; a master of the art of cross-examination. "The
  doctor told me you were likely to be here," he said, when she had escaped
  from Steppe's thunderous civilities. "I hoped Ronnie would have
  come&mdash;have you seen him lately?"</p>

  <p>"Only for a few minutes on Monday. I met him in the park. I didn't know
  you were a friend of his, Sir John?"</p>

  <p>Maxton's lips curled. Beryl wondered if he was trying to smile, or whether
  that twitch indicated something uncomplimentary to Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"I'm more than a friend&mdash;and less. I was one of the executors of his
  father's will. Old Bennett Morelle was my first client and I suppose I stand
  in loco parentis to Ronnie by virtue of my executorship. I have not seen him
  for quite a year. Somebody told me that he was scribbling! He always had a
  bent that way&mdash;it is a thousand pities he didn't take the law
  seriously&mdash;an occupation would have kept him out of mischief."</p>

  <p>"Has Ronnie been called to the Bar?" she asked in astonishment."</p>

  <p>Maxton nodded. "Just before the war, but he has never practised. I hope
  that his newspaper connection will keep him busy."</p>

  <p>"But Ronnie works very hard," she asserted stoutly. "He has his company
  work, he is a director of several, and chairman of one, I believe."</p>

  <p>Maxton looked at her with the faintest shade of amusement in his eyes. "Of
  course," he said dryly, "that is an occupation." He lowered his voice. "Do
  you mind if I am ill-bred and ask if you have known our host very long?"</p>

  <p>"A few years."</p>

  <p>He nodded. Beryl, glancing across at her father and Steppe, saw that the
  doctor was talking earnestly. She caught Steppe's gaze and looked back to Sir
  John. "I have been fighting a case for him. Rather a hopeless proposition,
  but we won. The jury was wrong, I think, in giving us a verdict. I can say
  this because the other side have entered an appeal which is certain to
  succeed."</p>

  <p>Jan Steppe must have heard the last sentence. "Huh? Succeed? Yes,
  perhaps...it doesn't matter very much. I had a verdict, a disqualified winner
  is still a moral winner, huh, doctor? You used to be a racing man; what do
  you think?" Dinner was announced whilst the doctor was disclaiming any
  knowledge of the Turf or its laws. The dinner was exquisite in its selection
  and brevity. Mr. Steppe had one special course which none of the others
  shared. He invited them and showed no regret when they refused. A footman
  brought a silver dish piled high with steaming mealie cobs. He took them in
  his hands and gnawed at the hot corn. It was probably the only way that
  mealies could be eaten, she told herself...no more inelegant an exhibition
  than the sword-swallowing manoeuvre which followed the serving of
  asparagus.</p>

  <p>"Sault?" Mr. Steppe was wiping his fingers on his serviette. "You asked me
  once before, Beryl...where was it? In the park. No, I haven't seen him. I
  very seldom do. Strange man, huh?"</p>

  <p>The butler had attended more frequently to Dr. Merville's wineglass than
  to any other of the guests. His gloom had disappeared and he was more like
  the cheerful man Beryl remembered. "Sault is a danger and a menace to
  Society," he said. Steppe's brows lowered but he did not interrupt. "At the
  same time, he can exercise one of the most beneficent forces that Nature has
  ever given into the care of a human being."</p>

  <p>"You pique my curiosity," said Maxton, interested. "Is he psychic or
  clairvoyant?...from your tone one would imagine that he had some supernatural
  power."</p>

  <p>"He has," nodded Merville. "I discovered it some time ago. He lodges with
  a woman named Colebrook in a very poor part of the town. Mrs. Colebrook
  suffers from an unusual form of heart disease. She had a seizure one night
  and Sault came for me. You will remember, dear, when I was called out in the
  middle of the night...a year ago. The moment I examined the woman, who was
  unconscious and in my opinion in extremis, I knew that nothing could be done.
  I applied the remedies which I had brought with me, and which I had thought,
  from his description of the seizure, would be necessary, but with no effect.
  Sault was terribly upset. The woman had two daughters, one bedridden. His
  grief at the thought that she would die without her daughter seeing her was
  tragic. I think he was going upstairs to bring the girl down, when I said
  casually that if I could lend the patient strength to live for another hour,
  she would probably recover. What followed, seems to me even now as part of a
  fantastic dream."</p>

  <p>Beryl's elbow was on the table, her chin in her palm, and she was
  absorbed. Maxton lay back, his arm hanging over the back of his chair,
  weighing every word; Steppe, his hands clasped on the table, his head bent,
  sceptical. "Sault bent down and took the inert hands of the woman in his...
  just held them. Remember this, that she was the colour of this serviette, her
  lips grey. I wondered what he was doing...I don't know now. Only her face
  went gradually pink and her eyes opened."</p>

  <p>"How long after he took her hands?" asked Maxton.</p>

  <p>"Less than a minute, I should think. As I say, she opened her eyes and
  looked round, and then she nodded very slowly. "What do you think of that,
  Dr. Merville?' she said."</p>

  <p>"She knew you, of course?"</p>

  <p>"She had never seen me in her life. I learnt that afterwards. Sault
  dropped her hands and stood up. He was looking ghastly. Not a vestige of
  colour. I said to him: 'Sault, what is the matter?' and he answered in a
  cockney whine, that was 'h'-less and ungrammatical&mdash;Sault never makes an
  error in that respect&mdash;'It's me 'eart, sir, I get them attacks at
  times&mdash;haneurism'."</p>

  <p>"Sault?" Steppe's face was puckered into a grimace of incredulity.</p>

  <p>"Go on, please, father!" urged the girl.</p>

  <p>"What came after was even more curious. Mrs. Colebrook got up quite
  unaided, sat down in a chair before the fire and fell fast asleep. Sault sat
  down too. I gave him some brandy and he seemed to recover. But he did not
  speak again, not even to answer my questions. He sat bolt upright in a wooden
  chair by the side of the kitchen table&mdash;all this happened in the
  kitchen. He didn't move for a long time, and then his hands began to stray
  along the table. There was a big work-basket at the other side and presently
  his hands reached it and he drew it toward him. I watched him. He took out
  some garment, I think it was a nightdress belonging to one of the girls. It
  was unfinished and the needle was sticking into it...he began to sew!"</p>

  <p>"Good God!" cried Maxton. "Do you suggest that on the touching of hands
  the two identities changed?"</p>

  <p>"I suggest that&mdash;I assert that," said the doctor quietly, and drank
  his wine.</p>

  <p>"Rubbish!" growled Steppe. "What did Sault say about it?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you. Exactly an hour after this extraordinary transference
  had been made, I saw Mrs. Colebrook going pale. She opened her eyes and
  looked at me in a puzzled way, then at the daughter, a pretty child who had
  been present all the time. 'I always 'ave these attacks, sir', she said, 'a
  haneurism the doctors call it'."</p>

  <p>"And Sault?"</p>

  <p>"He was himself again, but distressingly tired and wan."</p>

  <p>"Did he explain?"</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head. "He didn't understand or remember much. The
  next day out of curiosity I called at the house and asked if he could sew. He
  was amused. He said that he had never used a needle in his life, his hands
  were too big."</p>

  <p>Beryl sat back with a sigh. "It doesn't seem&mdash;human," she said. The
  doctor had opened his mouth to reply when there was a crash in the hall
  outside and the sound of a high aggressive voice. Another second and the door
  was thrown violently open and a man lurched in. He was hatless and his frock
  coat was covered with the coffee-coloured stains of wet mud. His cravat was
  awry and the ends hung loose over his unbuttoned waistcoat. A stray lock of
  black hair hung over his narrow forehead. He strode into the centre of the
  room, and with legs apart, one hand on his hip and the other caressing his
  long brown beard, he surveyed the company with a sardonic smile.</p>

  <p>"Hail, thieves and brother bandits!" he said thickly. He spoke with a
  slight lisp. "Hail, head devil and chief of the tribe! Hail,
  Helen&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Steppe was on his feet, his head thrust forward, his shoulders bent.
  Maxton saw him and started. There was something feline in that crouching
  attitude. "You drunken fool! How dare you come here, huh?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Moropulos snapped his fingers contemptuously. "I come, because I have
  the right," he said, with drunken gravity; "who will deny the Prime Minister
  the right of calling upon the King?" He bowed and nearly lost his balance,
  recovering by the aid of a chair-back.</p>

  <p>"Go to my study, Moropulos, I will come out with you," Steppe had gained
  control of himself, but the big frame was trembling with pent rage.
  "Study&mdash;bah! Here is my study! Hail, doctor, man of obnoxious draughts;
  hail, stranger, whoever you are...where's the immaculate Ronnie? Flower of
  English chivalry and warrior of a million flights&mdash;huh?" He bellowed his
  imitation of Steppe's grunt and chuckled with laughter. "Now, listen,
  confederates, I have done with you all. I am going to live honest. Why? I
  will tell you..."</p>

  <p>"Moropulos!" Beryl turned quickly toward the door. She knew before she saw
  the stolid figure that it was Sault.</p>

  <p>Moropulos turned too. "Ah! The Faithful Ambrose...do you want me, Sault?"
  His tone was mild; he seemed to wilt under the steady gaze of the man in the
  doorway. Ambrose Sault beckoned and the drunken intruder shuffled out,
  shamefaced, fearful.</p>

  <p>"Quite an interesting evening," said Sir John Maxton, as he closed the car
  door on the Mervilles that night.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap7"
     name="chap7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Two days later Sir John Maxton made an unexpected call upon
  the doctor, and it occurred to him that he might also have made an unwelcome
  appearance, for he interrupted a tete-a-tete. "I thought I should find the
  doctor in. Well, Ronnie, how are you after all these years?"</p>

  <p>Ronnie was relieved to see him&mdash;that was the impression which the
  lawyer received. And Beryl, although she was her sweet, equable self, would
  gladly have excused his presence. Maxton had an idea that he had surprised
  them in the midst of a quarrel. The girl was flushed and her eyes were
  unusually bright. Ronnie's countenance was clouded with gloom. Sir John was
  sensitive to atmosphere. "No, I really won't stay. I wanted to have a chat
  with the doctor about the extraordinary story he told us the other night. I
  was dining with the Lord Chief and some other judges last night, and without
  mentioning names, of course, I repeated the story. They were remarkably
  interested. Barham says that he had heard of such a case..."</p>

  <p>"What is all this about?" asked Ronnie curiously. "You didn't tell me
  anything, Beryl. Who, what, and where is the 'case'?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sault," she said shortly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sault! He is an extraordinary fellow...I must meet him. They say that
  he cannot read or write."</p>

  <p>"Is that a fact?" Sir John Maxton looked at the girl.</p>

  <p>"Yes...I believe so. Ronnie, on the contrary, is in the way of becoming a
  famous writer, Sir John."</p>

  <p>"So I hear." He wondered why she had so deliberately and so abruptly
  brought the conversation into another channel.</p>

  <p>Ronald Morelle, for his part, was not inclined to let the subject drift.
  "It is quaint how that coon intrigues you all," he said; "Oh yes, he is
  coloured. You haven't seen him, John, or you wouldn't ask that question."</p>

  <p>"I have seen him; it did not appear to me that he was coloured&mdash;he
  has a striking face."</p>

  <p>"At any rate, he seems to have struck you and Beryl all of a heap," said
  Ronnie, smiling. "Really, I must meet him. Are you going, Sir John?" Maxton
  was taking his farewell of the girl. "Because if you are, I'll walk a little
  way with you. 'Bye, Beryl."</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Ronnie," she said quietly.</p>

  <p>Once in the street Maxton asked: "What is the matter with you and
  Beryl?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing...Beryl is just a little grandmotherly. She went to the theatre
  last night with some people and she spotted me in a box."</p>

  <p>"I see," said Sir John dryly; "and of course you were not alone in the
  box."</p>

  <p>"Why on earth should I be?" demanded the other. "Beryl is really
  unreasonable. She swore that my friend was a girl she had seen me with in the
  park."</p>

  <p>"And who was it...is that a discreet question?"</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't," said Ronnie instantly. "I don't think one ought to chuck
  names about...it is most dishonourable and caddish. The lady was a very great
  friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"Then I probably know her," said Sir John, wilfully dense. "I know most of
  the people in your set, and I cannot imagine that you would be scoundrel
  enough to escort the kind of girl you couldn't introduce to me or Beryl or
  any other of your friends."</p>

  <p>"I give you my word of honour"&mdash;Ronnie was earnest&mdash;"that the
  lady was not only presentable, but is known personally to you. The fact is
  that she had a row with her fiance, a man I know very well, a Coldstreamer,
  and I was doing no more than trying to reconcile them...bring them together,
  you understand? She was dreadfully depressed and I got a box at the theatre
  with the idea of cheering her up. My efforts," he added virtuously, "were
  successful. Beryl said that it was a girl&mdash;the daughter of a dear friend
  of mine, she had seen me talking with in the park."</p>

  <p>"What dear friend of yours was this?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think you've met him," parried Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"Did she have trouble with her fiance too?" asked Sir John innocently.
  "Really, Ronnie, you are coming out strong as a disinterested friend of
  distressed beauty! If I may employ the imagery and language of an American
  burglar whom I recently defended, Sir Galahad has nothing on you!"</p>

  <p>"You don't believe me, John," said Ronnie, injured.</p>

  <p>"Of course I cannot believe you. I am not a child. You had some girl with
  you, some 'pick up', innocent or guilty, God knows. I will assume her
  innocence. The sophisticated have no appeal for you. There was a girl named
  East&mdash;a chorus girl, if I remember rightly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"If you're going to talk about that disgraceful attempt to blackmail me,
  I'm finished," said Ronnie, resigned.</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you charge her and her brother with blackmail? They came to
  me..."</p>

  <p>"Good lord, did they? I'll break that infernal blackguard's neck!"</p>

  <p>"When will you meet him?" Ronnie did not answer. "They came to me and I
  knew that the story was true. The brother, of course, is a blackmailer. He is
  levying blackmail now and you are paying him...don't argue, Ronnie, of course
  you are paying him. You said just now that you would break his neck, which
  meant to me that you see him frequently...when he comes to draw his
  blood-money. If it was a case of blackmail, why did you not prosecute? The
  mere threat of the prosecution would have been sufficient to have sent him to
  ground&mdash;it struck me that the girl was acting under the coercion of her
  brother, and I do not think you would have had any trouble from her. Ronnie,
  you are rotten."</p>

  <p>He said this as he stopped at the corner of Park Lane and Piccadilly, and
  Ronnie smiled nervously. "Oh, come now, John, that is rather a strong
  expression."</p>

  <p>"Rotten," repeated the lawyer. He screwed a monocle in his eye and
  surveyed his companion dispassionately. "Chorus-girls...shop-girls...the
  mechanics of joy who serve Madame Ritti...that made you jump, eh? I know
  quite a lot about you. They are your life. And God gave you splendid gifts
  and the love of the sweetest, dearest girl in this land."</p>

  <p>"Who is this?" asked the young man slowly.</p>

  <p>"Beryl. You do not need to be told that. Search the ranks of your light
  women for her beauty, Ronnie."</p>

  <p>A girl passed them, a wisp of a girl on the border-line of womanhood. She
  carried a little bag and was hurrying home from the store where she was
  employed. Even as he listened to the admonition of his companion, Ronnie
  caught her eyes and smiled into them...she paused and looked round once... he
  was still watching her. "I am afraid I must leave you, John, I've a lot of
  work to do, and you are quite mistaken as to my character...and Beryl."</p>

  <p>He left the lawyer abruptly and walked toward the gates of the park where
  the girl had stopped, ostensibly to tie a shoelace. Sir John saw her pass
  leisurely into the park; a few seconds later Ronnie had followed. His time
  was his own, for Evie Colebrook was working that evening, the annual
  stocktaking was in progress, as she had told him when they were at the
  theatre on the previous night. "Rotten!" repeated Maxton, and stalked
  gloomily to his club.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap8"
     name="chap8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. RONALD MORELLE'S flat was on the third floor of a block
  that faced busy Knightsbridge. His library was a large and airy room at the
  back and from the open casements commanded an uninterrupted view of the park.
  It was a pleasant room with its rows of bookshelves and its chintzes. The
  silver fireplace and the rich Persian rugs which covered the parquet were the
  only suggestions of luxury. There were one or two pictures which Francois had
  an order to remove when certain visitors were expected. The rest were decent
  reproductions with the exception of a large oil-painting above the
  mantelpiece. It was a St. Anthony and was attributed to Titiano Vecellio. The
  austere saint loomed darkly from a sombre background and was represented as
  an effeminate youth. The veining of the neck and shoulders was
  characteristically Titian, so too was the inclination of a marble column
  which showed faintly in the picture. Titiano's inability to draw a true
  vertical line is well known, and upon this column, more than upon other
  evidence, the experts accepted the picture as an early example of the
  fortunate painter's work.</p>

  <p>Ronnie was indifferent as to the authenticity of the picture. The dawning
  carnality on Anthony's lean face, the misty shape of the temptress...Titian
  or his disciple had reduced to visibility the doubt, the gloating and the
  very thoughts of the saint. A black oak table stood in the centre of the room
  and a deep Medici writing-chair was placed opposite the black blotting-pad.
  It pleased Ronnie to imitate those ministers of state who employed this
  colour to thwart curious-minded servants who, with the aid of a mirror, might
  discover the gist of outward correspondence. It was nearing midnight when the
  sound of Ronnie's key in the lock sent his sleepy servant into the lobby.
  Ronnie stood in the hall tenderly stripping his gloves.</p>

  <p>"Has anybody been?"</p>

  <p>"No, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>"Letters?"</p>

  <p>"Only one, m'sieur. An account." He opened the library door and Ronnie
  walked in. He switched on the light of his desk lamp and sat down. "I have
  not been out all the evening, Francois."</p>

  <p>"No, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>"I came home after dinner and I have not left this room, do you
  understand?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>"Have we any iodine...look for it, damn you, don't gape!"</p>

  <p>Francois hurried out to inspect the contents of the bathroom locker, where
  were stored such first-aid remedies as were kept in the flat. Ronnie looked
  at his hand and pulled back the cuff of his coat; three ugly red scratches
  ran from the wrist to the base of the middle fingers. His lips pursed
  angrily. "Little beast," he said. "Well?"</p>

  <p>"There is a bottle...would m'sieur like a bandage?"</p>

  <p>"It is not necessary...have you a cat in the flat?...no, well, get one
  tomorrow. You need not keep it permanently. I don't think there will be any
  trouble. Bring me a hand-mirror from my dressing-table&mdash;hurry!"</p>

  <p>He lifted the shade from the table lamp and, in the mirror, examined his
  face carefully. His right cheek was red, he imagined finger-marks, but the
  fine skin had not been torn. "I have had a quarrel with a lady, Francois. A
  common girl...I do not think she will make any further trouble, but if she
  does...she does not know me, anyway." Ronald's love-making had ended
  unpleasantly, and he had left the dark aisles of the park in a hurry, before
  the scream of a frightened girl had brought the police to the spot.</p>

  <p>"I was expecting m'sieur to telephone me saying that I might go home,"
  said Francois. He lodged in Kensington, and sometimes it was convenient for
  Ronnie that he should go home early. Two women came in the morning to clean
  the flat and he usually arrived in time to carry in his master's breakfast
  from the restaurant attached to the building.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't telephone. Take this glass back and bring me the evening
  newspapers. That is all. You can clear out."</p>

  <p>When the front door closed upon his valet, Ronnie got up and, walking to
  the window, pulled aside the curtains. The casement was open and he sat down
  on the padded window-seat, looking out into the darkness. He was not thinking
  of his night's adventure, being something of a philosopher. The sordidness
  and the vulgarity of it would not distress him in any circumstances. He was
  thinking of Beryl and what John Maxton had said. He knew that she liked him,
  but he had made no special effort to foster her affection or to evolve from
  their relationship one more intimate. By his code, she was taboo; love-making
  with Beryl could only lead to marriage, and matrimony was outside of his
  precarious plans. It pleased him to ponder upon Beryl...perhaps she was in
  love with him. He had not considered the possibility before. That women only
  differed by the hats they wore was a working rule of his; but it was strange
  that the influence he exercised was common to girls so widely separated by
  birth, education and taste as Beryl was from Evie Colebrook...and others.</p>

  <p>Self-disparagement was the last weakness to be expected in Ronald Morelle,
  and yet it was true to say that he had restricted his hunting for so long to
  one variety of game, that he doubted his ability to follow another. His
  father had been an enthusiastic hawker, one of the remaining few who followed
  the sport of kings, and Ronnie invariably thought of his adventuring in terms
  of falconry. He was a hawk, enseamed, a hawk that swung on its rigid sails,
  waiting on until the quarry was sprung...sometimes the quarry was not without
  talons to rend and tear at the embarrassed falcon...he felt the wounds on his
  hand gingerly. But a trained hawk respects the domestic fowl, even the folk
  of the dovecot may coo at peace whilst he waits on in the sky.</p>

  <p>Beryl?...She was certainly lovely. Her figure was delectable. And her
  mouth, red and full...a Rossetti woman should not have such lips. Was it
  Rossetti who painted those delicately-featured women? He got up and found a
  big portfolio filled with prints. Yes, it was Rossetti, but Beryl's figure
  was incomparably more delicious than any woman's that the painter had drawn.
  He came back to the window, staring out into the night, until, in the grey of
  dawn; the outlines of trees emerged from the void. Then he went to bed and to
  sleep.</p>

  <p>He did not move for five hours, and then he woke with a horrible sense of
  desolation. He blinked round the room and at that instant the clock of a
  church began to strike...the quarters sounded...a pause..."Toll...toll...
  toll...toll...toll...toll...toll...toll...toll." Nine o'clock! "No...
  no...Christ...no!"</p>

  <p>Francois, an early arrival, heard his voice and rushed in. "M'sieur!" he
  gasped. Ronald Morelle was sitting on his bed, sobbing into his hands. "A
  nightmare, Francois...a nightmare...get out, blast you!" But he had had no
  nightmare, could recall nothing of dreams, though he strove all day, his head
  throbbing. Only he knew that to hear nine o'clock striking had seemed very
  dreadful.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap9"
     name="chap9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"I SAW your friend Ronald Morelle today," said Moropulos,
  sending a writhing ring of smoke to the ceiling. Sprawling on a big morris
  chair, his slippered feet resting on the edge of a fender, he watched the
  circle break against the ceiling. A pair of stained grey flannel trousers, a
  silk shirt and a velvet coat that had once been a vivid green; these and an
  immense green silk cravat, the colour of which showed through his beard,
  constituted his usual morning neglige. Ambrose Sault, busy with the body of
  an unfinished safe, which in the rough had come from the maker's hands that
  morning, released the pressure of his acetylene lamp and removed his goggles
  before he replied. He was working in shirt and trousers, and his sleeves were
  rolled up, displaying the rope-like muscles of his arm. He looked across to
  his indolent companion and wiped the perspiration from his forehead. "Mr.
  Ronald Morelle is neither a friend nor an acquaintance, Moropulos. I don't
  think I have ever seen him. I have heard of him."</p>

  <p>"You haven't missed much by not knowing him," said Moropulos, "but he's a
  good-looking fellow." He flicked the ash of his cigarette on to the tiled
  hearth. "Steppe is still annoyed with me." Sault smiled to himself. "You
  think he is justified? Perhaps. I was terribly drunk, but I was happy. Some
  day, my dear brother, I shall get so drunk that even you will not hold me. I
  move toward my apotheosis of intoxication certainly and surely. Then I will
  be irresistible and I shall have no fear of those brute arms of yours." He
  sucked at the cigarette without speaking for a long time.</p>

  <p>Sault went back to his work. "I have often wondered!" said Moropulos at
  last.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Whether it would have been better if I had followed the advice of my head
  man that morning I pulled you aboard the sloop. You remember Bob the Kanaka
  boy? He wanted to knock you on the head and drop you overboard; you were too
  dangerous, he said. If a Government boat had picked us up and you had been
  found on board as well as certain other illicit properties, I should have had
  a double charge against me. I said 'no' because I was sorry for you."</p>

  <p>"Because you were afraid of me," said Sault calmly, "I knew you were
  afraid when I looked into your eyes. Why do you speak of the islands now...
  we haven't talked about the Pacific since I left the boat."</p>

  <p>"I've been thinking about you," confessed Moropulos, with a quick, sly
  glance at the man. "Do you realize how&mdash;not 'curious'...what is the
  word?"</p>

  <p>"Incurious!" suggested Sault, and Moropulos looked at him with reluctant
  admiration. "You are an extraordinary hombre, Sault. Merville says you have
  the vocabulaire...that is English or something like it...of an educated man.
  But to return...do you realize how incurious I am? For example, I have never
  once asked you, in all our years of knowing one another, why you killed that
  man."</p>

  <p>"Which man?"</p>

  <p>Moropulos laughed softly. "Butcher! Have you killed so many? I refer to
  the victim for whose destruction the French Government sent you to New
  Caledonia."</p>

  <p>Sault stood leaning his back against the table, his eyes fixed on the
  floor. "He was a bad man," he said simply. "I tried to find another way of...
  stopping him, but he was clever and he had powerful friends, who were
  Government officials. So I killed him. He hired two men to wait for me one
  night. I was staying at a little hotel on the Plassy Road. They tried to beat
  me because I had reported this man. Then I knew that the only thing I could
  do was to kill him. I should do it again."</p>

  <p>Moropulos surveyed him from under his lowered brows. "You were lucky to
  escape 'the widow', my friend," he said, but Ambrose shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nobody was executed in those days; capital punishment had not been
  abolished, but the Senate refused to vote the executioner his salary. It had
  the same effect. I was lucky to go to New Caledonia. Cayenne is worse."</p>

  <p>"How long did you serve?"</p>

  <p>"Eight years and seven months," was the reply.</p>

  <p>Moropulos made a little grimace. "I would sooner die," he said, and lit
  another cigarette. Deep in thought he smoked until Ambrose made a move to
  pick up his Crooke's glasses. "Don't work. I hate to see you&mdash;and hate
  worse to hear you. What do you think of Morelle?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know him; I have heard about him. He is not a good man."</p>

  <p>"What is a good man?" Moropulos demanded contemptuously. "He is a lover of
  ladies, who isn't? He is a cur too...Steppe walks on him. He is scared of
  Steppe, but then everybody is, except you and I." Ambrose smiled. "Well,
  perhaps I am...he is such a gorilla. But you are not."</p>

  <p>"Why should I be? I am stronger than he."</p>

  <p>Moropulos looked at the man's bare arms. "Yes...I suppose it comes down to
  that. The basis of all fear is physical. When will the safe be finished?"</p>

  <p>"In a week. I am assembling the lock at home. I shall make it work to five
  letters. The only word I can spell. I shouldn't have known that but I heard a
  man spell it once...on the ship that brought me home. He was a steerage
  passenger and he used to take his little child on the deck when it was fine,
  and the little one used to read scripture stories to him. When she came to a
  hard word he spelt it. I heard one word and never forgot it."</p>

  <p>"I'll be glad when the thing is finished," the Greek meditated. "We have a
  whole lot of papers that we never want to see the light of day, Steppe and I.
  We could destroy them but they may be useful&mdash;correspondence that it
  isn't safe to keep and it isn't wise to burn. You are an ingenious
  devil!"</p>

  <p>In the Paddington directory, against "Moropulos, 49 Junction Terrace',
  were the words, 'mining engineer'. It was a courtesy status, for he had
  neither mined nor engineered. Probably the people of Junction Terrace were
  too occupied with their own strenuous affairs to read the directory. They
  knew him as one who at regular periods was brought home in the middle of the
  night singing noisily in a strange language. Cicero's oration was Greek to
  Cassius; the melodious gibberish of Mr. Moropulos was Greek to Junction
  Terrace, though they were not aware of the fact.</p>

  <p>No. 49 was a gaunt, damp house with a mottled face, for the stucco had
  peeled in patches and had never been renewed. Moropulos bought it at a
  bargain price and made no contingency allowance for dilapidations. The
  windows of the upper floors were dingy and unwashed. The owner argued that as
  he did not occupy the rooms above it would be wicked waste of money to clean
  the windows. Similarly he dispensed with carpets in the hall and on the
  stairs. His weekends he spent in more pleasing surroundings, for he had a
  cottage on the borders of Hantshire where he kept hens and grew cabbage-roses
  and on Sundays loafed in his garden, generally in his pyjamas, to the scandal
  of the neighbourhood. He had a whimsical turn of mind and named his cottage
  'The Pantheon', and supported this conceit by decorating his arcadian groves
  with plaster reproductions of the great figures of mythology, such figures as
  Phidias and Polycletus and Praxiteles chiselled. He added to this a wooden
  pronaos which the local builder misguidedly surmised was intended for the
  entrance to a new cinema. When they discovered that the erection had no other
  purpose than to remind Moropulos of departed Hellenic splendours, the grief
  of the villagers was pathetic. Here he was kept, reluctantly, tidy. He owned
  a small American car which supplied him with the transportation he required,
  and made his country home accessible. It was Friday, the day he usually left
  town, but he had lingered on, hoping to see some tangible progress in the
  construction of the safe. "You never seem to get any further," he complained.
  "You have been fiddling with that noisy lamp for two hours and, so far as I
  can see, you've done nothing. How long will it be before anything happens?"
  and then before Sault could reply he went on: "Why don't you come to my
  little Athens, Sault? You prefer to stay in town. And you are a man of
  brains! Have you got a girl here, eh?"</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"Gee! What a time that fellow Ronnie must have! But they will catch him
  some day...a mad father or a lunatic fiance, and ping! There will be Ronnie
  Morelle's brains on the floor, and the advocates pleading the unwritten
  law!"</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a lot about him."</p>

  <p>Moropulos ran his fingers through his beard and grinned at the ceiling.
  "Yes...I can't know too much. We shall have trouble with him. Steppe laughs
  at the idea. He has him bound to his heel...is that the expression, no? Well,
  he has him like that! But how can you bind a liar or chain an eel? His very
  cowardice is a danger."</p>

  <p>"What have you to be afraid of?" asked Sault. "So far as I can make out,
  you are carrying on an honest business. It must be, or the doctor wouldn't be
  in it." His tone was sharp and challenging. Moropulos had sufficient nous not
  to accept that kind of challenge. "I can understand that you have papers that
  you wish to keep, in such a way that nobody but yourselves can get at them.
  All businesses have their secrets."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," agreed the Greek, and yawned. "Ronnie will pay," he said, "but
  I am anxious that I should not be asked to contribute to the bill. I have had
  a great deal of amusement from watching him. The other night I was in the
  park. I go there because he goes. I know the paths he uses. And there came
  with him a most pretty young lady. She did not know him."</p>

  <p>"You guessed that?"</p>

  <p>"I know, because later, when she complained, she did not know his name.
  Ronnie!" he mused. "Now I tell you what I will undertake to do. I will make a
  list, accurate and precise, of all his love affairs. It will be well to know
  these, because there may come a day when it will be good to flourish a weapon
  in this young man's face. Such men marry rich women." Sault was working and
  only muttered his reply. He was not then interested in Ronnie Morelle.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap10"
     name="chap10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HE stayed on in the house long after Moropulos had dragged
  himself to his room and had dressed for the journey. So absorbed was he in
  his task that the Greek left without his noticing. At seven o'clock he
  finished, put away his tools in a cupboard, threw a cloth over the safe, and
  went out, locking the door behind him. Both Steppe and Moropulos had urged
  him to live in the house, but though he had few predilections that were not
  amenable to the necessities of his friends, Sault was firm on this point. He
  preferred the liberty which his lodgings gave him. Possibly he foresaw the
  difficulties which might arise if he lived entirely with the Greek.</p>

  <p>Moropulos had a vicious and an uncertain tongue; was tetchy on some
  points, grotesquely so on the question of Greek decadence, although he had
  lived so long away from his native country that English was almost his mother
  tongue. Sault could be tactful, but he had a passion for truth, and the two
  qualities are often incompatible. A bus carried him to the end of the street
  where he lodged, and he stopped at a store on the corner and bought a box of
  biscuits for Christina. She was secretary and reader to him, and he repaid
  her services with a library subscription and such delicacies as she asked him
  to get for her. The subscription was a godsend to the girl, and augmented, as
  it was, by an occasional volume which Evie was allowed to bring from the
  store library by virtue of her employment, her days were brightened and her
  dreams took a wider range than ever.</p>

  <p>The driving force of learning is imagination. By imagination was Christina
  educated. Evie sometimes said that she did not understand one half of the
  words that Christina used. To Mrs. Colebrook her daughter was an insoluble
  enigma. She associated education with brain-fever and ideas above your
  station, and whilst she was secretly proud of the invalid's learning, she
  regarded Christina's spinal trouble as being partly responsible for the
  abnormality. Mrs. Colebrook believed in dreams and premonitions, and the
  sinister significance of broken picture-wires. It was part of her creed that
  people who are not long for this world possess supernatural accomplishments.
  Therefore she eyed Christina's books askance, and looked upon the extra
  library subscription as being a wild flight in the face of providence. She
  expressed that view privately to Ambrose Sault.</p>

  <p>"You have come at a propitious moment, Sault Effendi," said Christina
  solemnly as he came in. "I have just been taking my last look at the silvery
  Bosphorous. My husband, taking offence at a kiss I threw to the handsome
  young Sultan as he rose beneath my latticed window, has decreed that tonight
  I am to be tied in a sack and thrown into the dark waters!"</p>

  <p>"Good gracious!" said Ambrose. "You have been in trouble today,
  Christina."</p>

  <p>"Not very much. The journey was a lovely one. We went by way of
  Bergen&mdash;and thank you ever so much for that old Bradshaw you got for me.
  It was just the thing I wanted."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Moropulos kindly gave it to me...yes...Bergen?"</p>

  <p>"And then to Petrograd...the Tsars there, poor people...and then to
  Odessa, and down the Black Sea in...oh, I don't know. It was a silly journey
  today, Ambrose...I wasn't in the heart for a holiday."</p>

  <p>"Is your back any worse?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No...it seems better. I nearly let myself dream about
  getting well. Do you think that other idea is possible? We can borrow a
  spinal carriage from the Institute, but mother hasn't much time, and besides,
  I couldn't get down those narrow stairs without a lot of help. Yes...yes,
  yes, I know it is possible now. But the chariot, dear Ambrose?"</p>

  <p>"I've got it!" He chuckled at her astonishment. "It will come tomorrow. It
  is rather like a motor-car, for I have to find a garage for it. In this tiny
  house there is no room. But I got it...no, it didn't cost me a great deal.
  Dr. Merville told me where I could get one cheap. I put new tyres on and the
  springs are grand. Christina, you will be...don't cry, Christina, please...
  you make me feel terrible!"</p>

  <p>His agitation had the effect of calming her. "There must be something in
  this room that makes people weep," she gulped. "Ambrose...Evie is just
  worrying me to death."</p>

  <p>"What is wrong?"</p>

  <p>She shook her red head helplessly. "I don't know. She is changed...she is
  old. She's such a kid, too...such a kid! If that man hurts her"&mdash;the
  knuckles of her clenched hand showed bone-white through the skin&mdash;"I'll
  ask you to do what you did for mother, Ambrose, give me strength for an
  hour..." her voice sank to a husky whisper, "and I'll kill him...kill
  him..."</p>

  <p>Sault sat locking and unlocking his fingers, his eyes vacant. "She will
  not be hurt. I wish I was sure it was Ronald Morelle...Steppe has only to
  lift his finger..."</p>

  <p>They heard the sound of Mrs. Colebrook's heavy feet on the stairs and
  Christina wondered why she was coming up. She had never interrupted their
  little talks before. "Somebody to see you, Christina, and I'm sure it is too
  kind of you, miss, and please thank the doctor. I'll never be grateful enough
  for what he did..."</p>

  <p>Ambrose Sault got up slowly to his feet as Beryl came into the room. "I
  wonder if you really mind my coming&mdash;I am Beryl Merville."</p>

  <p>"It is very good of you, Miss Merville," said Christina primly. She was
  ready to dislike her visitor; she hated the unknown people who called upon
  her, especially the people who brought jelly and fruit and last year's
  magazines. Their touching faith in the virtues of calves-foot and fruit as a
  panacea for human ills, their automatic cheerfulness and mechanical good
  humour, drove her wild. The church and its women had given up Christina ever
  since she had asked, in answer to the inevitable question: "Yes, there are
  some things I want; I'd like a box of perfumed cigarettes, some marron glace,
  and a good English translation of Liaisons Dangereux." She loathed marron
  glace, and scented tobacco was an abomination. Her chief regret was that the
  shocked inquirer had never heard of Liaisons Dangereux. Christina only knew
  of its existence from a reference in a literary weekly which came her
  way.</p>

  <p>Beryl sensed the hidden antagonism and the cause. "I really haven't come
  in a district visitor spirit," she said, "and I'm not frightfully sorry for
  you and I haven't brought you oranges&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Grapes," corrected Christina. "They give you appendicitis&mdash;mother
  read that on the back page of Health Hints. Sit down, Miss Merville. This is
  Mr. Sault."</p>

  <p>She nodded to Ambrose. "Mr. Sault and I are old acquaintances," she said.
  She did not look at him. "I have to explain why I came at all. I know that
  you are not particularly enthusiastic about stray visitors&mdash;nobody is.
  But my father was talking about you at lunch today. He has never seen you,
  but Mr. Sault has spoken about you and, of course, he does know your mother.
  And father said: 'Why don't you go along and see her, Beryl?' I said, 'She
  would probably be very annoyed&mdash;but I'll take her that new long wordy
  novel that is so popular. I'm sure she'll hate it as much as I'."</p>

  <p>"If it is Let the World Go, I'm certain I shall," said Christina promptly,
  "but I'd love to read it. Let us sneer together." Beryl laughed and produced
  the book. It seemed an appropriate moment for Ambrose to retire, and he went
  out of the room quietly; he thought that neither of the girls saw him go, but
  he was mistaken. Christina Colebrook was sensitive to his every movement, and
  Beryl had really come to the house to see him.</p>

  <p>On her way home she tried to arraign herself before the bar of
  intelligence, but it was not until she was alone in her room that night that
  she set forth the stark facts of her folly. She loved Ronald Morelle, loved
  him with an intensity which frightened her; loved him, although he was,
  according to all standards by which men arc judged, despicable. He was a
  coward, a liar, a slave to his baser appetites. She had no doubt in her mind,
  when she faced the truth, that the stories which had been told of him were
  true. The East girl...the pretty parlourmaid who had begun an action against
  him...And yet there was something infinitely pathetic about Ronnie Morelle,
  something that made her heart go out to him. Or was that a case of
  self-deception, too? Was it not the beautiful animal she loved, the sleek,
  lithe tiger...alive, and vital, and remorseless?</p>

  <p>To all that was brain and spirit in her, he was loathsome. There were
  periods when she hated him and was bitterly contemptuous of herself. And in
  these periods came the soft voice of Ambrose Sault, whispering,
  insinuating...That was lunacy, too. He was old enough to be her father; was
  an illiterate workman, an ex-convict, a murderer; when her father had told
  her he had killed a man, she was neither shocked nor surprised. She had
  guessed, from his brief reference to New Caledonia, that he had lived on that
  island under duress. He must have been convicted of some great crime; she
  could not imagine him in any mean or petty role. A coarse-handed workman,
  shabby of attire...it was madness to dream and dream of him as she did. And
  dreams, so Freud had said, were the expressions of wishes unfulfilled.</p>

  <p>What did she wish? She was prepared to answer the question frankly if any
  answer could be framed. But she had no ultimate wish. Her dreams of Ambrose
  Sault were unfinishable. Their ends ran into unfathomable darkness. "I wonder
  if he is very fond of that red-haired girl?" she asked her mirror.
  Contemplating such a possibility she experienced a pang of jealousy and hated
  herself for it.</p>

  <p>Jan Steppe came back from Paris on the eve of her birthday. He called at
  the house the next morning, before she was down, and interviewed Dr.
  Merville; when Beryl went in to breakfast, two little packages lay on her
  plate. The first was a diamond shawl pin. "You are a dear, daddy!" She went
  round the table and kissed him. "It is beautiful and I wanted one badly." She
  hurried back to her place. Perhaps Ronnie had remembered...She picked up the
  card that was enclosed and read it. "Mr. Steppe?"</p>

  <p>Her father shot a quick glance at her. "Yes...bought it in Paris. He came
  in person to present it, but left when he found that you were not down...
  rather pretty."</p>

  <p>This was an inadequate description of the beautiful plaque that flashed
  and glittered from its velvet bed. "It is lovely," she said, but without
  warmth. "Ought I accept...it is a very expensive present!"</p>

  <p>"Why not? Steppe is a good friend of ours; besides, he likes you," said
  the doctor, not looking up from his plate; "he would be terribly hurt if you
  didn't take it...in fact, you cannot very well refuse."</p>

  <p>She ran through her letters. There was a note from Ronnie, an invitation
  to a first night. He said nothing about her birthday. "Oh, by the way, some
  flowers came. I told Dean to put them in your room. I have been puzzling my
  head to remember when I told him the date of your birthday. I suppose I must
  have done so, and, of course, he has the most colossal memory."</p>

  <p>"Who, father?"</p>

  <p>"Sault. He must have got up very early and gone to the market to get them.
  Very decent of him."</p>

  <p>She went out of the room with an excuse and found her maid in the pantry.
  She had filled a big bowl with the roses. There were so many that only room
  for half of them had been found. "The others I will put in the doctor's room,
  miss," said the maid.</p>

  <p>"Put them all in my room, everyone of them," demanded Beryl. She selected
  three and fastened them in her belt before she went back to the
  breakfast-room. The doctor laughed. "I've never seen you wearing flowers
  before&mdash;Sault would be awfully pleased." This she knew. That was why she
  wore them.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap11"
     name="chap11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EVIE COLEBROOK came home at an unusually early hour, and the
  girl on the bed looked up in surprise. "I heard mother talking to somebody,
  but I had no idea it was you, Evie. What is the matter&mdash;has your swain
  another engagement?"</p>

  <p>"My swain, as you call him, is working tonight," said Evie, "and it is so
  hot that I thought I would come home and get into my pyjamas."</p>

  <p>"Mother has been talking about your eccentric tastes, with particular
  reference to pyjamas," said Christina. "She thinks that pyjamas are
  indelicate. In her young days girls weren't supposed to have legs."</p>

  <p>"Father wore pyjamas."</p>

  <p>"Father also drank. Mother thinks that the pyjamas had something to do
  with it. She also thinks that book-reading was a contributory cause."</p>

  <p>"What terrible jaw-breaking words you use, Christina! Father did read a
  lot, didn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Father was a student. He studied, amongst other things, racehorses. Do
  you know who father was?" Evie stared at her expectantly. "He was a
  carpenter, wasn't he?"</p>

  <p>"He was the youngest son of the youngest son of a lord. Take that look off
  your face, Evie; there is no possibility of our being the rightful heiresses
  of the old Hall. But it is true; he had a coat of arms."</p>

  <p>"Then why did he marry mother?"</p>

  <p>"Why do people marry anybody?" demanded Christina. "Why did grandfather
  marry grandmother? Besides, why shouldn't he have married mother? He was only
  a cabinet-maker when he met her. She has told me so. And his father was a
  parson, and his mother the Honourable Mrs. Colebrook, the daughter of Lord
  Faushelm. There is blue blood in your veins, Evie."</p>

  <p>"But really, Christina"&mdash;Evie's voice was eager and her eyes
  bright&mdash;"you are not fooling; is it true? It makes such an awful
  difference&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Christina groaned. "My God, what have I said?" she asked dramatically.</p>

  <p>"But really, Christina?"</p>

  <p>"You are related so distantly to nobility that you can hardly see it
  without a telescope," said Christina. "I thought you knew, Mother used always
  to be talking about it at one time. My dear, what difference does it make?"
  Evie was silent. "A man doesn't love a girl any more because she has a fifth
  cousin in the House of Lords; he doesn't love her any less because her mother
  takes in laundry, and if her lowly origin stands in the way of his marriage,
  and he finds that really she is the great granddaughter of a princess, he
  cannot obliterate her intermediate relations."</p>

  <p>"What is 'intermediate'?"</p>

  <p>"Well, mother and father, and the parson who got into trouble through
  drinking, and his wife who ran away with a groom."</p>

  <p>Evie drew a long sigh. "Where is your swain?" she asked. "I don't like
  that word 'swain', it sounds so much like 'swine'."</p>

  <p>"I hope you will never see the resemblance any clearer,'" said Christina.
  "My swain is working too. I shouldn't take off that petticoat if I were you,
  Evie; he may come in and you can see your knickers through that dressing-
  gown."</p>

  <p>"Christina!"</p>

  <p>"I hate mentioning knickers to a pure-minded girl," said Christina,
  fanning herself with a paper, "but sisters have no secrets from one another.
  Ambrose&mdash;if that is who you mean&mdash;is very busy these days."</p>

  <p>"Do you call him Ambrose to his face?" asked Evie curiously, and her
  sister snorted.</p>

  <p>"Would you call Julius Caesar 'Bill' or 'Juley' to his face; of course
  not. But I can't think of him as Ambrose Sault Esquire, can I?"</p>

  <p>"I don't understand him," said Evie. "He seems so dull and quiet."</p>

  <p>"I'll get him to jazz with you the next time you're home early," said
  Christina sardonically.</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. Naturally he isn't very lively being so old."</p>

  <p>"Old! He is lively enough to carry me downstairs as though I were a pillow
  and wheel me for hours at a time in that glorious chariot he got for me! And
  he is old enough&mdash;but what is the good of talking to you, Evie?"
  Presently her irritation passed and she laughed. "Tell me the news of the
  great world, Evie; what startling happenings have there been in
  Knightsbridge?"</p>

  <p>"I can tell you something about Mr. Sault you don't know," Evie was piqued
  into saying; "he has been in prison."</p>

  <p>Christina turned on her side with a wince of pain. "Say that again."</p>

  <p>"He has been in prison." A long pause.</p>

  <p>"I hoped he had," Christina said at last. "I believe in imprisonment as an
  essential part of a man's education&mdash;who told you?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not going to say."</p>

  <p>"Ronald Morelle...aha!" She pointed an accusing finger at the dumbfounded
  Evie. "I know your guilty secret! The 'Ronnie' you babble about in your sleep
  is Ronnie Morelle!"</p>

  <p>"Wh&mdash;what makes you...it isn't true...it is a damned lie!..."</p>

  <p>"Don't be profane, Evie. That is the worst of druggists' shops, you pick
  up such awful language. Mother says that you can't work amongst pills without
  getting ideas in your head."</p>

  <p>"I never talk in my sleep...and I don't know Ronnie Morelle...who is he?"
  Evie's ignorance was badly assumed. Christina became very thoughtful. She lay
  with her hand under her cheek, her grey eyes searching her sister's face.
  "Would Ronnie be impressed by your distant relationship with nobility?" she
  asked quietly. "Would it make such an awful difference if he knew about the
  coat of arms in father's Bible? I don't think it would. If it did, he isn't
  worth worrying about. What is he?"</p>

  <p>"Didn't Mr. Sault tell you?" asked Evie hotly. "He seems to spend his time
  gossiping about people who are a million times better than him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Than he," murmured Christina, her eyes closed.</p>

  <p>"He is a nasty scandal-mongering old man! I hate him!"</p>

  <p>"He didn't say that Ronnie had been in prison." Christina's voice was
  gentle. "All that he said was that the only 'Ronnie' he knew was Ronald
  Morelle. He did not even describe him or give him a character."</p>

  <p>"How absurd, Christina! As if old Sault could give Mr. Morelle a
  character'! One is a gentleman and the other is an old fossil!"</p>

  <p>"Old age is honourable," said Christina tolerantly&mdash;"the arrogance of
  you babies!"</p>

  <p>"You're half in love with him!"</p>

  <p>"Wholly," nodded Christina. "I love his mind and soul. I am incapable of
  any other kind of love. I never want a man to draw my flaming head to his
  shoulder and whisper that, until he met me, the world was a desert and food
  didn't taste good. It is because Ambrose Sault never paws me or holds my hand
  or kisses me on the brow in the manner of a father who hopes to be something
  closer, that I love him. And I shall love him through Eternity. When I am
  dead and he is dead. And I want nothing more than this. If he were to die
  tomorrow, I should not grieve, because his flesh means nothing to me. The
  thing he gives me is everlasting. That is where I am better off than you,
  Evie. You have nothing but what you give yourself. You think he gives you
  these wonderful memories which keep you awake at nights. You think it is his
  love for you that thrills you. It isn't that, Evie. Your love is the love of
  the martyr who finds an ecstatic joy in his suffering."</p>

  <p>Groping toward understanding, Evie seized this illustration. "God loves
  the martyr...it isn't one-sided," she quavered, and Christina nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is true, or it may be true. Does your god love you?"</p>

  <p>"It is blasphemous to...to talk of Ronnie as God."</p>

  <p>"God with a small 'g'."</p>

  <p>"It is blasphemous, anyhow. Ronnie does love me. He hasn't silly and
  conventional ideas about...about love as most people have. He is much
  broader-minded, but he does love me. I know it. A girl knows when a man loves
  her."</p>

  <p>"That is one of the things she doesn't know," interrupted Christina. "She
  knows when he wants her, but she doesn't know how continuously he will want
  her. How unconventional, too? And broad-minded? the broad-minded are usually
  people who take a generous view of their own short-comings. Is he one of
  those unconventional souls who think that marriage is a barbarous
  ceremony?"</p>

  <p>"Who told you that?" Evie was breathless from surprise.</p>

  <p>"It isn't an unique view...broad-minded men often try to get narrow-
  minded girls to see that standpoint."</p>

  <p>"You're cynical...I hate cynical people," said Evie, throwing herself on
  her bed, "and you have all your ideas of life out of books, and the rotten
  people who come in her, moaning about their troubles. You can't believe
  writers, not some writers...there are some, of course, that give just a true
  picture of life...not in books, but in articles in the newspapers. They just
  seem to know what people are thinking and feeling, and express themselves
  wonderfully."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;so Ronnie writes for the newspapers, does he?" Evie's indignant
  retort was checked by a knock on the door. "That is Mr. Sault...can he come
  in?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose so," answered Evie grudgingly. She got off the bed and tied her
  dressing-gown more tightly. "I don't really show my legs through this kimono,
  do I, Christina?"</p>

  <p>"Not unless you want to...come in!"</p>

  <p>Ambrose Sault looked tired. "Just looked in before I went to my room," he
  said. "Good evening, Evie."</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Sault." Evie's dressing-gown was wrapped so tightly as
  to give her a mummified appearance.</p>

  <p>"I saw the osteopath today and I've arranged for him to come and talk to
  you tomorrow," said Ambrose, sitting on the edge of the bed at the inviting
  gesture of Christina's hand.</p>

  <p>"I will parley with him," she nodded. "I don't believe that he will make a
  scrap of difference. I've seen all sorts of doctors and specialists. Mother
  has a list of them&mdash;she is very proud of it."</p>

  <p>"I'm only hoping that this man may do you some good," said Ambrose,
  rubbing his chin meditatively. "I have seen some wonderful cures...in
  America. Even Dr. Merville believes in them. He says that if you build a
  skyscraper and the steel frame isn't true, you cannot expect the doors to
  shut or the windows to open. I'm sorry I am so late, but the osteopath was
  dining out, and I had to wait until he came back. He hurt his ankle too, and
  that took time. I had to give him a rubbing. He is the best man in London.
  Dr. Duncan More."</p>

  <p>She did not take her eyes from his face. Evie noticed this and discounted
  Christina's earlier assertion. "Will it cost a lot of money?" asked
  Christina.</p>

  <p>"Not much, in fact very little. The first examination is free. He doesn't
  really examine you, you know. He will just feel your back, through your
  clothes. I asked him that, because I know how you dislike examinations. And
  if he doesn't think that you can be treated, and that there is no chance of
  making you better, he won't bother you any more."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe in these quack doctors," said Evie decidedly. "They
  promise you all sorts of cures and they only take your money. We have a lot
  of those kind of remedies at the store, but Mr. Donker, the manager, says
  that they are all fakes...don't tell me that an osteopath isn't a medicine. I
  know that. He's a sort of doctor, but I'll bet you he doesn't do any
  good."</p>

  <p>"Cheer up, Job!" said Christina. "Faith is something. I suppose you mean
  well, but if I took any notice of you I'd give up the struggle now."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to depress you, you're very unkind, Christina! But I don't
  think you ought to be too hopeful. It would be such an awful&mdash;what's the
  word?&mdash;come-down for you."</p>

  <p>"Reaction," said Sault and Christina together, and they laughed.</p>

  <p>Sault went soon after, and Evie felt that a dignified protest was called
  for. "There is no reason why you should make me look a fool before Sault,"
  she said, hurt. "Nobody would be happier than I should be if you got well.
  You know that. I'm not so sure that Mr. Sault is sincere&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What?" Christina leant up on her arm and her eyes were blazing, "You can
  say that he is old and ugly if you like, and shabby, and...anything. But
  don't dare to say that, Evie...don't dare to say he isn't sincere!"</p>

  <p>Evie lay awake for a long time that night. Christina was certainly a
  strange girl...and when she said she did not love Sault, she was not speaking
  the truth. That was just how she had felt, when Christina had hinted that
  Ronnie was not sincere. Only she had been too much of a lady to lose her
  temper. About old Sault, too! What did he do for a living? She must ask
  Christina.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap12"
     name="chap12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. JAN STEPPE sat astride of a chair, his elbows on the
  back rest, his saturnine face clouded with doubt. "It certainly looks like a
  very ordinary safe to me, Sault. Do you mean to say that an expert could not
  get inside without disturbing the apparatus, huh?"</p>

  <p>"Impossible," replied Sault. "I have filled the top chamber with water and
  I have tried at least a thousand combinations, and every time I put the
  combination wrong the safe has been flooded." He twisted the dials on the
  face of the unpretentious repository until he brought five letters, one under
  the other, in line with an arrow engraved on the safe door. He was a long
  time doing this and Steppe and the Greek watched him. "Now!" said Sault. He
  turned the handle and the door swung open. The contents were two or three old
  newspapers, and they were intact. "What is the codeword?" Steppe peered
  forward. "Huh&mdash;why did you choose that word, Sault?"</p>

  <p>"It is one of the very few words I can spell. Besides which, each letter
  is different."</p>

  <p>"It is not an inappropriate word," said Moropulos, amused, "and one easy
  to remember. I intend pasting a notice on the safe. Steppe, explaining
  frankly that unless the codeword is used, and if any other combination of
  letters is tried, indeed, if the handle is turned, whilst the dial is set at
  any other word than the codeword, the contents of the safe are destroyed.
  This may act as a deterrent to promiscuous burglars."</p>

  <p>Steppe fingered his stubbly beard. "That will be telling people that we
  have something in the safe that we want to keep hidden, huh?" he said
  dubiously, "a fool idea!"</p>

  <p>"Everybody has something in his safe that he wants to keep hidden," said
  the other coolly. "Now let me try...shut the door, Sault, that is right."
  Steppe got out of the chair to spin the dials. "Now we will suppose that I am
  some unauthorised person trying to find a way of opening the safe. So !" He
  turned the handle. "Open it." Sault worked at the dials and presently the
  door swung open. The newspapers were saturated and an inch of water at the
  bottom of the safe splashed out and into a bathtub that Sault had put ready.
  "How about cutting into the safe? Suppose I am a burglar, huh? I burn out the
  lock or the side, and don't touch the combination?"</p>

  <p>"I have left a hole in one side of the safe," said Sault, and pointed to a
  rubber plug that had been rammed into a small aperture. With a pair of
  pincers he pulled this out and a stream of water spurted forth and was mostly
  caught in the can he held. "That has the same effect," he explained, "the
  water is pumped at a pressure into the hollow walls of the safe. The door is
  also hollow. When the water runs out, a float drops and releases the contents
  of the upper chamber. In the case of the door, the float operates the same
  spring that floods the safe when the handle is turned."</p>

  <p>Steppe scratched his head. "Perfect," he said. "You have experimented with
  the acid."</p>

  <p>Sault nodded. "Both with sulphuric and hydrochloric," he said; "I think
  hydrochloric is the better."</p>

  <p>Steppe turned to the Greek. "You had better keep it here," he said, and
  then: "Will it be ready today? I want to get those Brakpan letters out of the
  way. I needn't tell you, Sault, that the code-word must be known only to us
  three, huh? I don't mind your knowing...but you, Moropulos! You have got to
  cut out absinthe...d'ye hear? Cut it out&mdash;right out!"</p>

  <p>His growl became a roar that shook the room, and Moropulos quailed. "It is
  cut out," he said sulkily. "I am confining my boozing to the 'Pantheon'...
  I've got to have some amusement."</p>

  <p>"You have it, if all I hear is true," said Steppe grimly. "Give Sault a
  hundred, Moropulos. It is worth it. What do you do with your money, Sault?
  You don't spend it on fine clothes, huh?"</p>

  <p>"He goes about doing good," said Moropulos, with a good-natured sneer. "I
  met him in Kensington Gardens the other day, wheeling an interesting invalid.
  Who was she, Sault?"</p>

  <p>"My landlady's daughter," replied the other shortly.</p>

  <p>"No business of yours, anyhow," growled Steppe. "You've met Miss Merville,
  huh? Nice lady?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, a very nice lady," said Sault steadily. He pushed back his long grey
  hair from his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Pretty, huh?"</p>

  <p>Sault nodded, and was glad when his employer had departed.</p>

  <p>"Steppe is gone on that girl," said Moropulos, "he'd have brained you if
  you had said she wasn't pretty."</p>

  <p>"He wouldn't have brained me," said Sault quietly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose he wouldn't. Even Steppe would have thought twice about lifting
  his hand to you. He's a brute though, I saw him smash a man in the face once
  for calling him a liar...at a director's meeting. It was an hour before the
  poor devil knew what had happened. Yes, she is pretty. I see her riding some
  mornings, a young Diana...delicious. I'd give a lot to be in Steppe's
  shoes."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>Moropulos rolled a cigarette with extraordinary rapidity and lit it. "Why?
  Well, if he wants her, he'll have her. Steppe is that kind. I don't suppose
  the doctor would have much to say in the matter. Or she either."</p>

  <p>Sault picked up an iron bar from the tables. It was one of four that he
  had brought for the purpose of strengthening the safe, and it was nearly an
  inch in diameter. "I think she would have something to say," he said,
  weighing the bar on the palms of his hands. And then, to the Greek's
  amazement, he bent the steel into a V. He used no apparent effort, the bar
  just changed its shape in his hands as though it had been made of lead.</p>

  <p>"Why did you do that?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," said Ambrose Sault, and, with a jerk, brought the steel
  almost straight.</p>

  <p>"Phew!" Moropulos took the bar from his hand. "I shouldn't like to annoy
  you seriously," he said. He did not speak of Beryl again.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap13"
     name="chap13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EVIE COLEBROOK had found a note awaiting her at the store on
  the morning of the day she came home early. It consisted of a few words
  scrawled on a plain card and had neither address nor signature:</p>

  <p>'Dearest Girl,&mdash;I shall not be able to see you tonight. I have a long
  article to write and shall probably be working through the night, when your
  dear and precious eyes are closed in sleep. Your Lover.'</p>

  <p>She had the card under her pillow when she slept.</p>

  <p>"Are you sure you aren't too busy?" said Beryl when she came down, a
  radiant figure, to the waiting Ronnie. "Now that you have taken up a literary
  career, I picture you as being rushed every hour of the day."</p>

  <p>"Sarcasm is wasted on me," Ronnie displayed his beautiful teeth.
  "Unflattering though it be, I admit to a slump in my literary stock. I have
  had no commissions for a week."</p>

  <p>"And I'm not taking you away from any of those beautiful friends of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"Beryl!" he muttered reproachfully. "You know that I have no friends...if
  by friends you mean girl friends."</p>

  <p>"It is my mad jealousy which makes me ask these questions," she said
  quizzically. "Come along, Ronnie, we will be late."</p>

  <p>What the play was about Beryl never quite remembered. Ronnie, sitting in
  the shade of the curtains, was more interested in his companion. It was
  strange that he had known her ever since she was a child and he was a
  schoolboy, and yet had never received a true impression of her beauty. He
  watched her through the first act, the tilt of her chin, the quick smile.
  "Beryl, you ought to be painted," he said in the first interval. "I mean by a
  portrait painter. You look so perfectly splendid that I couldn't take my eyes
  off you." The colour came slowly, and in the dim light of the box a man who
  had not been looking for this evidence of her pleasure would have seen
  nothing.</p>

  <p>"That is a little less subtle than the usual brand of flattery you
  practise, isn't it, Ronnie? Or is your artlessness really an art that
  conceals art?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not flattering you...I simply speak as I feel. I never realized your
  loveliness until tonight." She straightened up and laughed. "You think I'm
  crude...I suppose I am. You do not say that I am keeping my hand in, though
  you probably think so. I admit I have had all sorts of flirtations, in fact I
  have been rather a blackguard in that way, and of course I've said nice
  things to girls...buttered them, and played to their vanity. But if I were
  trying to make love to you, I should be a little more subtle, as you say. I
  should imply my compliments. It is just because my...my spasm is
  unpremeditated that I find myself at a loss for words. There is no sense in
  my making love to you, anyway, supposing that you would allow me. I can't
  marry...I simply won't marry until I have enough money, and I haven't nearly
  enough. If in four years' time the money doesn't come...well then, I'll risk
  being a pauper, but the girl will have to know."</p>

  <p>She said nothing. Here was an unexpected side to his character. He had
  some plan of life and a code of sorts. If she had been better acquainted with
  that life of his, which she so far suspected, she would have grown alert when
  Ronnie unmasked his way of retreat. She was surprised at his virtuous
  reluctance to make a woman share his comparative poverty&mdash;she should
  have been suspicious when he fixed a time limit to his bachelorhood. It was
  not like Ronnie to plan so far in advance, that she knew. It might have
  occurred to her that he was definitely excusing the postponement of marriage.
  As it was, she was seeing him in a more favourable light. Ronnie desired that
  she should. His instinct in these matters was uncannily accurate. "It was
  worth coming out with you, if only to hear your views on matrimony," was all
  the comment she made.</p>

  <p>"I don't know..." he looked gloomily into the auditorium, "in many ways I
  have been regretting it. That doesn't sound gallant, but I am not in a mood
  for nice speeches...you think I am? I did not mean to be nice when I said
  that you were lovely, any more than I wish to be nice to Titian when I praise
  his pictures. Beryl, I've been fond of you for years. I suppose I've been in
  love with you, though I've never wanted to be. That is the truth. I've
  recognized just how unfair it would be to chain a woman like you to a
  rake&mdash;I'm not sparing myself&mdash;like me. God knows whether I could be
  constant. In my heart I know that if I had you there could be no other woman
  in the world for me...an intimate knowledge of my own character makes me
  sceptical."</p>

  <p>Beryl was spared the necessity for replying. The curtain went up on the
  second act just then. She knew he was looking at her, and turned in her chair
  to hide her face. Her heart was beating tumultuously. She was trembling. She
  was a fool...a fool. He meant nothing...he was a liar; lied as readily as
  other men spoke the truth. That frankness of his was assumed...he was acting.
  Versed in the weaknesses of women, he had chosen the only approach that would
  storm her citadel. She told herself these truths, her reason battling in a
  last desperate stand against his attack. And yet...why should he not be
  sincere? For the first time he had admitted the unpleasant charges which
  hitherto he had denied. He surely could not expect to make her love him more
  by the confession of his infidelities? If he had followed up his talk, had
  made any attempt to carry on the conversation from the point where he left
  it, she would have been invincible.</p>

  <p>But he did not. When the curtain went down again, he was more cheerful and
  was seemingly interested in the people he recognized in the stalls. He asked
  her if she would mind if he left her. He wanted to smoke and to meet some men
  he knew. She assented and was disappointed. They had a long wait between
  these two acts, and as he had returned to the box after a shorter interval
  than she had expected, there was plenty of time, had he so wished, to have
  resumed his conversation. He showed no such desire, and it was she who began
  it. "You puzzle me, Ronnie. I can't see...if you loved me, how you could do
  some of the things you have done. You won't be so commonplace as to tell me
  that you wanted to keep me out of your mind and that that form of amusement
  helped you to forget me."</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted, "but, Beryl dear, need we discuss it? I don't know why
  I spoke to you as I did, I felt like it."</p>

  <p>"But I am going to discuss it," she insisted. "I want my mind set in
  order. It is overthrown for the moment. What prevented you from keeping me as
  a friend all this time...a real close friend, if you loved me? Oh, Ronnie, I
  do want to be fair to you even at the risk of being shameless, as I am now.
  Why could you not have asked me, even if it meant waiting?"</p>

  <p>He looked down at the floor. "I have some sense of decency left," he said
  in a low voice. And then the curtain went up. Beryl looked at her programme.
  The play had four acts; there was another interval. He did not leave her this
  time; nor did he wait for her to begin.</p>

  <p>"I'm going to be straight with you, Beryl," he said. "I want you&mdash;I
  adore you. But I cannot commit you to an engagement which may adversely
  affect your father and incidentally myself. I am being brutally selfish and
  mercenary, but I am going to say what I think. You'll be amused and perhaps
  horrified when I tell you that Steppe is very keen on you."</p>

  <p>She was neither amused nor horrified; but, on the other hand, if Ronnie
  Morelle realized that in his invention he had accidentally hit upon the truth
  he would not have been amused, and most certainly terror would have struck
  him dumb. If Beryl had only said what she was of a mind to say, that she had
  learnt from her father that Steppe was in love with her, she might have
  silenced him. But she said nothing. Ronnie's explanation seemed natural...
  knowing Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"I'd sooner see you dead than married to him," he said vehemently, "but
  none of us can say that now. We are in a very tight place. Steppe could ruin
  your father with a gesture...he could very seriously inconvenience me." Here
  he was very much in earnest, and the girl, with a cold feeling at her heart,
  knew he spoke the truth. "But that time will pass. We shall weather the storm
  which is shrieking round our ears...you don't read the financial papers...
  you're wise. You see what might happen, Beryl?"</p>

  <p>Beryl nodded. She was ridiculously happy.</p>

  <p>"A great play, don't you think so, Miss Merville?" It was Sir John Maxton
  who had pushed through the crowd in the vestibule.</p>

  <p>"Splendid," she said.</p>

  <p>"Ronnie, did you like it?"</p>

  <p>"I never heard a word," said Ronnie, and somehow that statement was so
  consonant with his new honesty that it confirmed her in a faith which was as
  novel.</p>

  <p>The car carried them through the crowded Circus and into the quietude of
  Piccadilly. "Oh, Ronnie...I am so happy!..." His arm slipped round her and
  his lips pressed fiercely against her red mouth.</p>

  <p>"Why can't you sleep?" asked the drowsy Christina, as the girl lit her
  candle for the second time.</p>

  <p>"I don't know...I'm having such beastly dreams," said Evie fretfully.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap14"
     name="chap14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE step of Ambrose Sault was light and there was a buoyancy
  in his mien when he came into Mrs. Colebrook's kitchen, surprising that good
  lady with so unusual an appearance at an hour of the day when she was taking
  her afternoon Siesta. "Lord, how you startled me!" she said. "The ostymopat
  came this morning. A stout gentleman with whiskers. Very nice, too, and
  American. But bless you, Mr. Sault, he'll never do any good to Christina,
  though I wish he could, for I'm up and down these blessed stairs from the
  moment I get up to the moment I go to bed. He'll never cure her. She's had
  ten doctors and four specialists, and she's been three times to St. Mary's
  Hospital, to say nothing of the Evelyna when she was a child and fell out of
  the perambulator; that did it. Ten doctors and four specialists&mdash;they're
  doctors too in a manner of speaking, so you might say fourteen."</p>

  <p>Sault never interrupted his landlady, although his forbearance meant, very
  often, a long period of patient waiting. "Can I see Christina, Mrs.
  Colebrook?" he begged.</p>

  <p>"Certainly you can; you needn't ask me. She'll be glad to see you," said
  Mrs. Colebrook conventionally. "I thought of going up myself, but she has
  always got those books. Do you think so much reading is good for her?..."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure it is."</p>

  <p>"But...well, I don't know. I've never read anything but the Sunday papers,
  and they've got enough horrors in 'em&mdash;but they actually happened. It
  isn't guesswork like it is in books. I never read a book through in my life.
  My husband!...Why, when he passed away, there was enough books in the house
  to fill a room. He'd sooner read than work at any time. He was a bit
  aristocratic in his way."</p>

  <p>Sault had come to understand that 'aristocratic' did not stand, as Mrs.
  Colebrook applied the word, for gentleness of birth, but for a loftiness of
  demeanour in relation to labour. He made his escape up the stairs.</p>

  <p>Christina was not reading. She lay on her back, her hands lightly folded,
  and she was inspecting the end bed-rail with a fixity of gaze that indicated
  to Ambrose how far she was from Walter Street and the loud little boys who
  played beneath her window. "I have nothing for you today...I haven't been
  baking."</p>

  <p>She patted the bed and he sat down. "The osteopath has been, I suppose
  mother told you? She has the queerest word for him, 'ostymopat'. Yes, he came
  and saw, or rather he prodded, in a gentle, harmless kind of way, but I fancy
  that my spine has conquered. He didn't say very much, but seemed to be more
  interested in the bones of my neck and shoulders than he was in the place
  where it hurts. He wouldn't tell me anything. I suppose he didn't want to
  make me feel miserable. Poor kind soul...after all the uncomplimentary things
  that have been said about my spinal column!"</p>

  <p>"He told me," said Ambrose, and something in his face made her open her
  eyes wide.</p>

  <p>"What did he say...please tell me...was it good?"</p>

  <p>He nodded and a beatific smile lightened his face. "You can be cured;
  completely cured. You will walk in a year or maybe less. He thinks it will
  take six months to manipulate the bones into their place, he talked about
  'breaking down' something, but he didn't mean that he would hurt you. He just
  meant that he would have to remove...I don't know what it is, but it would be
  a gradual process and you would feel nothing. He wants your mother to put you
  into a sort of thin overall before he comes." He lugged a parcel from his
  pocket. "I bought one...a smock of thick silk. I thought you had better have
  silk. He works at you through it, and it makes his work easier for him and
  for you if...anyhow, I got silk, Christina."</p>

  <p>Her eyes were shining, but she did not look at him.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't seem possible," she said softly, "and it is going to cost a
  lot of money...cost you. The silk overall is lovely, but I wouldn't mind if I
  wore sackcloth. You great soul!" She caught his hand in both of hers, and
  gripped it with a strength that surprised him. "Evie is quite sure that I am
  in love with you, Ambrose...I lied to her when I said I never called you
  Ambrose. And, of course, we are in love with one another, but in a way that
  poor Evie doesn't understand. If I were normal, I suppose I'd love you in her
  way...poor Ambrose, you would be so embarrassed." She laughed quietly.</p>

  <p>"Love is a great disturbance," said Ambrose. "I think Evie means that
  kind."</p>

  <p>"Were you ever in love that way? I have never been. I think I love you as
  I should love my child if I had one. If you say that you love me&mdash;as a
  mother, I shall be offended, Ambrose. Do you think it will really happen...
  will it cost very much?"</p>

  <p>"A pound a visit, and he is coming every day except Sunday."</p>

  <p>Christina made a calculation, and the immensity of the sum left her
  horror-stricken. "A hundred and fifty pounds!" she cried. "Oh, Ambrose...how
  can you? I won't have the treatment. It is certain to fail...I won't,
  Ambrose!"</p>

  <p>"I've paid a hundred on account. He didn't want to take it, but I said
  that I would only let him come on those terms. I wasn't speaking the truth...
  I'd have let him come on any terms. So you see, Christina, I've paid and you
  must be treated!"</p>

  <p>"Hold my hand, Ambrose...and don't speak a word. I'm going for a long
  walk...I haven't dared walk before..." She resumed her gaze upon the bed-rail
  and he sat in silence whilst she dreamt. Evie returned at ten o'clock that
  night and heard Christina singing as she mounted the stairs. "Enter, sister;
  has mother told you that I am practically a well woman?"</p>

  <p>"Don't put too high hopes&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shut up! I'm a well woman, I tell you. In a year I shall walk into your
  medicine shop and sneer at you as I pass. Have you brought home any candy?
  'Sweets' is hopelessly vulgar, and I like the American word better. And you
  look bright and sonsy. Did you see the god?"</p>

  <p>"I wish you wouldn't use religious words, Christina, just when we are
  going to bed, too. I wonder you're not afraid. Yes, I saw my boy."</p>

  <p>"Have you a boy?"&mdash;in simulated surprise. "Evie, you are a surprising
  child. Whom does he take after?"</p>

  <p>"Really, I think you are indecent," said her sister, shocked. "You know
  perfectly well I mean...Ronnie."</p>

  <p>"Oh, is he the 'boy'? To you girls everything that raises a hat or smokes
  a cheap cigar is strangely boyish. Well, is he nearly dead from his midnight
  labours?"</p>

  <p>"I'd like to see you write a long article for the newspapers," said Evie
  witheringly.</p>

  <p>"I wish you could. You may even see that. Tell me about him, Evie. What is
  he like...what sort of a house has he?" She waited.</p>

  <p>"He lives in a flat, and, of course, I've never seen it. You don't imagine
  that I would go into a man's flat alone, do you?"</p>

  <p>Christina sighed. "There are points about the bourgeoisie mind which are
  admirable," she said. "What does 'bourgeoisie' mean? The bourgeoisie are the
  people who have names instead of numbers to their houses; they catch the
  nine-twenty-five to town and go home by the five-seventeen. They go to church
  at least once on Sunday, and their wives wear fascinators and patronise the
  dress-circle."</p>

  <p>"You talk such rubbish, Christina. I can't make head or tail of it half
  the time. I don't see what it has got to do with my going into Ronnie's flat.
  It wouldn't be respectable."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't I think of that word?" wailed Christina. "Evie?"</p>

  <p>"Huh?" said Evie, her mouth full of pins and in an unconscious imitation
  of one who, did she but know it, held her soul in the hollow of his
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Where do you meet your lad&mdash;I simply can't say 'boy'."</p>

  <p>"Oh, anywhere," said Evie vaguely. "We used to meet a lot in the park. As
  a matter of fact, that is where I first saw him, but now he doesn't go to the
  park. He says the crowd is vulgar, and it is you know, Christina; why I've
  heard men addressing meetings and saying that there wasn't a God! And talking
  about the King most familiarly. It made my blood boil!"</p>

  <p>"I don't suppose the King minds, and I'm sure God only laughed."</p>

  <p>"Christina!"</p>

  <p>"Well, why not? What's the use of being God if He hasn't a sense of
  humour? He has everything He wants, and that is one of the first blessings He
  would give Himself. Where do you meet Ronnie, Evie?"</p>

  <p>"Sometimes I have dinner with him, and sometimes we just meet at the tube-
  station and go to the pictures." Christina pinched her chin in thought. "He
  knows that girl who came to see you&mdash;Miss Merville. I told him about her
  visit, and he asked me if she knew that I was a friend of his, and whether
  she had seen me. She rather runs after him I think. He doesn't say so, he is
  too much a gentleman. I can't imagine Ronnie saying anything unkind."</p>

  <p>"But he sort of hinted?" suggested Christina.</p>

  <p>"You are uncharitable, Christina! Nothing Ronnie does is right in your
  eyes. Of course he didn't hint. It is the way he looks, when I speak about
  her. I know that he doesn't like her very much. He admitted it, because, just
  after we had been talking about her, he said that I was the only girl he had
  ever met who did not bore him&mdash;unutterably. His very words!"</p>

  <p>"That was certainly convincing evidence," said Christina, and her sister
  arrested the motion of her hairbrush to look suspiciously in her direction.
  You could never be sure whether Christina was being nice or unpleasant.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap15"
     name="chap15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RONALD MORELLE had once been the victim of a demoralising
  experience. He had awakened in time to hear the church clock strike nine, and
  for the space of a few seconds he had suffered the tortures of hell. Why, he
  never discovered. He had heard the clock strike nine since then, in truth he
  had been specially wakened by Francois the very next morning in the
  expectation that the tolling of the bell would recall to his mind the cause
  of his abject fear. But not again did the chimes affect him. He had made a
  very thorough examination of his mind in the Freudian method, but could trace
  no connection between his moments of terror and the sound of a bell. 'A
  nightmare, as an unpleasant dream is called, may be intensely vivid, yet from
  the second of waking, leaves no definite memory behind it', said a lesser
  authority. He had to rest content with that.</p>

  <p>He had other matters to think about. Steppe, an unusual visitor, came to
  his flat one morning. Ronnie was in his dressing-gown, reading the morning
  newspapers, and he leapt up with a curious sense of guilt when the big man
  was announced. "You dabble in press work, Morelle, don't you?" Ronnie
  acknowledged his hobby. "Do you know anybody in Fleet Street...editors and
  suchlike?"</p>

  <p>"I know a few...why, Mr. Steppe?"</p>

  <p>Steppe lit a cigar, and, strolling across the room, looked out of the
  window. He carried the air of a patron to such an extent that Ronnie felt an
  interloper, an uncomfortable feeling to a man still in pyjamas. "Because
  we've got to beat up a few friendly press criticisms," said Steppe at last.
  "The financial papers are raising merry hell about that Klein River diamond
  flotation and we have to get our story in somehow or other. You don't want to
  be called a swindling company promoter, huh? Wouldn't look good, huh?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see how I come into it," said Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"You don't, huh? Of course you don't! Have you ever seen anything but a
  shop-girl's ankles? You...don't see! You're a director, so is Merville.
  You've drawn director's fees. I'm not a director...it doesn't matter a damn
  to me what they say."</p>

  <p>The name of Jan Steppe seldom appeared amongst the officers or directors
  of a company. He had his nominees who voted according to the orders they
  received. "What makes it so almighty bad is that I was floating the Midwell
  Traction Corporation next week. We'll have to put that back now, but it will
  keep. What are you going to do?"</p>

  <p>"I don't exactly know what to do," said Ronnie. It was the first time he
  had ever been called upon to justify his director's fees. "I know a few
  men...but I doubt if I can do anything. Fleet Street is a little rigid in
  these things."</p>

  <p>"Get an article in somehow," ordered Steppe peremptorily. "Take this line:
  That we bought the Klein River Mine on the report of the best engineer in
  South Africa. We did. There's no lie about that. Mackenzie&mdash;he's in a
  lunatic asylum now. And the report was in his own hand-writing, so there
  won't be a copy. And you needn't mention that he is in a lunatic asylum, most
  people think he is dead."</p>

  <p>"Didn't he write to us complaining that we only put an extract from his
  report into the prospectus?"</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that!" snarled Steppe. "I didn't come here for a
  conversation. He did write; said that we'd published a sentence away from the
  context. He didn't think I was going to put the worst into the prospectus,
  did he? What he said was that the Klein River Mine would be one of the
  richest in South Africa if we could get over difficulties of working, which
  he said were insuperable. He was right. They are. The only way to work that
  mine is with deep-sea divers! Now, have this right, Morelle, and try to
  forget Flossie's blue eyes and Winnie's golden hair. This is business. Your
  business. You've got to take that report (Moropulos will give it to you, but
  you mustn't take it from the office) and extract all that is good in it. At
  the General Meeting you have to produce your copy and read it. If anybody
  wants to see the original, refer 'em to Mackenzie. You've got to make Klein
  River look alive, and you haven't to defend it, d'ye hear me? You've got to
  handle that mine as though you wished it was yours, huh? No defence! The
  hundred pound shares are at twelve; you've got to make 'em look worth two
  hundred. And it is dead easy if you go the right way about it. Ask any
  pickpocket. The easiest way to steal a pocket-book is to go after the man
  that's just lost his watch. Make 'em think that the best thing they can do is
  to buy more Klein Rivers and hold them, huh? You've got to think it, or you
  won't say it. Get this meeting through without a fuss, and there's a thousand
  for you."</p>

  <p>"I'll try," said Ronnie.</p>

  <p>Yet it was in no very confident mood that he faced a hall full of enraged
  stockholders a week later. The meeting was described as 'noisy'; it ended in
  the passing of a vote of confidence in the directors. Ronnie was not elated;
  no other man but Steppe could have induced him to present a forged document
  to a meeting of critical stockholders, and when Klein Rivers rose the next
  day to seventeen, he was not as enthusiastic as Dr. Merville, who 'phoned his
  congratulations on what was undoubtedly a remarkable achievement. He spoke of
  nothing else that day, and Beryl basked in the reflected approval.</p>

  <p>Her father knew nothing. He wondered why Ronnie, whom he did not like
  over-much, called with greater frequency. He had too large an experience of
  life to harbour any misconception as to his second cousin's private
  character, although he would, in other circumstances, have passively accepted
  him as a son-in-law. Men take a very tolerant view of other men's weaknesses.
  The theory that the world holds a patch of arable land reserved for young men
  to put under wild oats, and that without exciting the honest farmers whose
  lands adjoin, is a theory that dies hard as the cultivated fields increase in
  number. He did not regard Ronnie as a marrying man, and with the exception of
  a few moments of uneasiness he had when he noted Beryl's preference for his
  associate's society, he found nothing objectionable in the new interest which
  Ronnie had found. But he wished he wouldn't call so often.</p>

  <p>Dr. Merville might, and did, dismiss Ronnie's errant adventures with a
  philosophical sua cuique voluptas...he found himself talking a more and more
  lenient view of Ronald Morelle's character. A man is never himself until he
  is idle. Successions of nurses, schoolmasters, and professors shepherd him
  into the service of his fellows, and the conventions of his profession, no
  less than a natural desire to stand well with the friends and clients he has
  acquired in his progress, assist him in maintaining something of the
  appearance and mental attitude which his tutors have formed in him. Many a
  man has gone through life being some other man who has impressed him, or some
  great teacher who has imparted his personality into his plastic pupil. The
  first instinct of a man lost in the desert is to discard his clothes. The
  doctor, wandering in this financial waste, began to discard his principles.
  He was unconscious of the sacrifice. If, in the course of his professional
  life he had made a mistaken diagnosis, or blundered in an operation, he would
  have known. If at school he had committed some error, he would have been
  corrected. Now, though this he did not realize, he was, for the first time in
  his life, free from any other authority than his own will and conscience. He
  fell into a common error when he believed, as he did, that standards of
  honour and behaviour are peculiar to the trades in which they are exercised
  and that right and wrong are adaptable to circumstances.</p>

  <p>"Ronnie is coming to dinner tonight, isn't he? You know I shall not be
  here, my dear? I promised Steppe I should spend the evening with him. I wish
  you would tell Ronnie how pleased we all are at his very fine speech. I never
  dreamt that he had it in him. Steppe talks of making him chairman of the
  company."</p>

  <p>"I thought he was that."</p>

  <p>"No...er...no. The chairman is a man named Howitt...a very troublesome
  fellow. Steppe bought him out before the meeting, Ronnie was only acting-
  chairman."</p>

  <p>"I thought you were a director, daddy?" She was curious on this point, and
  had waited an opportunity of asking him why he had not been present at the
  meeting.</p>

  <p>"I am...in a sense...but my nerves are in such a state just now, that I
  simply couldn't bear the strain of listening to a crowd of noisy louts
  jabbering stupid criticism. The company is in a perfectly sound position. You
  can see that from the way the stock has jumped up in the past few days. These
  city people aren't fools, you know."</p>

  <p>She wondered if it was the 'city people' who were buying the stock or were
  responsible for the encouraging rise in Klein River Diamonds. More likely,
  she thought, the buyers were the people who knew very little about stock
  exchange transactions.</p>

  <p>Ronnie arrived as the doctor was going out, and they met in the street
  before the door. "It was nothing," said Ronnie modestly; "they were rather
  rowdy at first, but after I had had a little talk with them...you know how
  sheep-like these fellows are. I discovered from Steppe who was likely to be
  the leader of the opposition, and I saw him before the meeting. Of course, he
  was difficult and full of threats about appointing a committee of
  investigation. However..."</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes, you did splendidly...you'll find Beryl waiting for you. Er...
  Ronnie."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Don't unsettle her...she is in an maddening mood just now, especially
  about the companies and things. I shouldn't talk too much about Klein Rivers.
  She is a very shrewd girl. Not that there is anything about Klein Rivers that
  is discreditable."</p>

  <p>"I never talk business to Beryl," said Ronnie. Which was nearly true.</p>

  <p>He found her in the drawing-room and took her into his arms. She was so
  dear and fragrant. So malleable in his skilled hands now that the barrier of
  her suspicion had been broken down.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap16"
     name="chap16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the middle of the night Ambrose Sault turned in his
  narrow bed and woke. He was a light sleeper and the party-walls of the tiny
  house were thin. He got out bed, switched on the light of a portable electric
  lamp which stood within reach of his hand, and, thrusting his feet into
  slippers, opened the door. The house was silent, but a crack of light showed
  under Christina's door. "Are you awake, Christina?" he asked softly. "Is
  anything wrong?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, Mr. Sault." It was not Christina. There was no hint of tears in
  her voice. Ambrose went back to his bed, and to sleep. He knew that he had
  not been mistaken either as to the sound that had awakened him or the
  direction from whence it came. For one terrific moment he had thought it was
  Christina and that the new treatment which had already commenced was
  responsible for the loud sobs which had disturbed his sleep. He was sorry for
  Evie. He was easily sorry. A cat writhing in the middle of the street, where
  a too-swift motor-car had passed, wrung his heart. A child crying in pain
  made him sweat. When he saw a man and a woman quarrelling in this vile
  neighbourhood, he rushed from the scene lest the woman be struck.</p>

  <p>"What did he get...up for?" whispered Evie; "he is always...
  interfering."</p>

  <p>"The wonder to me is that the whole street isn't up," said Christina.
  "What is the matter, Evie?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know...I'm miserable." Evie flounced over in her bed. "I just had
  to cry. I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>Christina was very serious; she too had been awakened by the hysterical
  outburst. It carried a meaning to her that she had the courage to face.
  "There is nothing wrong is there, Evie?" No answer. "I can't be all the help
  to you that I should like, darling, and I am a pig to you at times. But I get
  tetchy myself, and it is a bore lying here day after day. You would tell me
  if there was anything wrong, wouldn't you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," whispered the girl.</p>

  <p>"I mean, really wrong. If it was anything that affected your health.
  Nothing would make you wrong in my eyes. I should just love you and help you
  all I could. You know that. It isn't wise to keep some secrets, Evie, not if
  you know that there is somebody who loves you well enough to take half your
  burden from you."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what you're driving at," said Evie in a fret. "I've nothing
  to reproach myself with, if that's what you mean."</p>

  <p>Christina snorted. "Then what are you snivelling about?" she demanded. She
  was not unreasonably irritated.</p>

  <p>"I haven't...seen...Ronnie...for a week!" sobbed the girl.</p>

  <p>"I wish to God you'd never seen him," snapped Christina, and wished she
  hadn't, for the next minute Evie was in bed with her, in her arms.</p>

  <p>"I'm so unhappy...I wish I hadn't met him, too...I know that it isn't
  right, Chris...I know it isn't...I know I shall never be happy. He is so much
  above me...and I'm so ignorant...such a...such a shop-girl."</p>

  <p>Christina cuddled the slim figure and kissed her damp face. "You'll get
  over that, Evie," she said soothingly.</p>

  <p>"But I love him so!"</p>

  <p>"You don't really...you are too young, Evie you can't test your feelings.
  I was reading today about some people who live in Australia, natives, who
  think that a sort of sour apple is the most lovely fruit in the world. But it
  is only because they haven't any other kind of fruit. If you go to a poor
  sort of store to buy a dress, you get to think the best they have in stock is
  the best you can buy anywhere. It takes a lot of courage to walk out of that
  shop and find another. After a while you are sure and certain that the dress
  they show you is lovely. It is only when you put it against the clothes that
  other women have bought from the better shops that you see how old-fashioned
  and tawdry and what an ugly colour it is." She waited for an answer, but Evie
  was asleep.</p>

  <p>Ambrose came home early the next day. Every other afternoon he took
  Christina to Kensington Gardens. He kept the long spinal carriage in a stable
  and spent at least half an hour in cleaning and polishing the wheels and
  lacquered panels of the 'chariot'. "Shut the door, Ambrose." He obeyed. "You
  heard Evie crying? It was nothing. She hasn't seen her man for a week and she
  was a little upset. I promised her to tell you that it was all your
  imagination if you asked. Poor Evie doesn't know that you wouldn't ask,
  anyhow."</p>

  <p>"Is it Ronald Morelle, Christina?" She nodded, and seeing his face
  lengthen she asked: "Is he a good man, Ambrose? Do you think there is my
  danger to Evie?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know him personally." Ambrose was speaking very slowly. "No. I
  don't know him. Once or twice I have seen him, but I have never spoken.
  Moropulos says he is rotten. That was the word he used. There have been one
  or two nasty incidents. Moropulos likes talking about that sort of thing...
  what was that word you told me, Christina? It is not like me to forget? It
  describes a man with a bad curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Prurient?"</p>

  <p>"That is the word. Moropulos has that kind of mind. He is interested in
  that kind of subject. He says that Ronald Morelle is bad. The worst man he
  has ever met. He wasn't condemning him, you understand? In fact he was
  admiring him. Moropulos would."</p>

  <p>Christina was plucking at her underlip pensively. "Poor Evie!" she said.
  "She thinks she is in love with him. He is a beautiful dream to her,
  naturally, because she has never met anybody like him. I wish he had made the
  mistake of treating her cheaply the first time he met her. That would have
  ended it. What I am afraid of is that he does understand her, and is
  proceeding on a definite plan. What am I to do, Ambrose?"</p>

  <p>Years before, when he was working in a penal settlement, Ambrose Sault had
  bruised and cut his chin. He had been working in tapioca fields and the
  prison doctor had warned him not to touch the healing wound with his hand for
  fear of poisoning it. From this warning he had acquired a curious trick. In
  moments of doubt he rubbed his chin with the knuckle of a finger. Christina
  had often seen him do this and had found in the gesture sure evidence of his
  perplexity. "You can't advise me?" she said, reading the sign. "I didn't
  think you would be able to."</p>

  <p>"I can go to Morelle and warn him," suggested Sault, "but that means
  trouble&mdash;here. I don't want to make mischief."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Evie would never forgive us," she said, with a sigh. "I'm
  ready, Ambrose."</p>

  <p>He stooped and lifted her from the bed, as though, as she once described
  it, she were of no greater weight than a pillow.</p>

  <p>Mr. Jan Steppe was dressing for dinner when Sault was announced. "Tell him
  to wait...no, send him up."</p>

  <p>"Here, sir?" asked the valet.</p>

  <p>"Where else, you fool, huh?" Sault came into the dressing-room and waited
  until his employer had fixed a refractory collar. "Don't wait, you."</p>

  <p>The valet retired discreetly. "Well, Sault, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>"The daughter of the woman I lodge with knows Morelle," said Ambrose Sault
  briefly, "she's a pretty child and I don't want anything to happen to her
  that will necessitate my taking Morelle and breaking his neck."</p>

  <p>Steppe looked round with a scowl. "Necessitate'? You talk like a damned
  professor. I'm not Morelle's keeper. It is enough trouble to keep him up to
  the scratch in other matters. As to breaking his neck, I've got something to
  say to that, Sault, huh?" He faced the visitor, a terrifying figure, his
  attitude a threat and a challenge.</p>

  <p>"You might have to identify him," said Sault thoughtfully, "that is
  true."</p>

  <p>Steppe's face went red. "Now see here, Sault. I've never had a fight with
  you and I don't want to, huh? You're the only one of the bunch that is worth
  ten cents as a man, but I'll allow nobody to dictate to me...nobody, whether
  he is a girl-chasing dude or an escaped convict. Get that right! I've smashed
  bigger men and stronger men than you, by God!"</p>

  <p>"You'll not smash me," said Sault coolly, "and you needn't smash Morelle.
  I'm telling you that I won't have that girl hurt. A word from you will send
  Morelle crawling at her feet. I don't know him, but I know of him. He's that
  kind."</p>

  <p>Steppe glared. "You're telling me, are you?" he breathed. "You think
  you've got me because you're indispensable now that you know about the safe.
  But I'll have another safe and another word. D'ye hear? I'll show you that no
  damned lag can bully me!"</p>

  <p>The other smiled. "You know that the code is safe with me. That's my way.
  I would break Morelle or you for the matter of that...kill you with my hands
  before your servant could come...but the code would be with me. You know
  that, too."</p>

  <p>He met&mdash;had not feared to meet&mdash;the fury of Steppe's eyes, and
  presently the big man turned away with a shrug. "You might," he said,
  speaking more to himself than to Ambrose Sault. "One of these days I'll try
  you out. I'm not a weakling and I've beaten every man that stood up to me."
  He looked round at the visitor and the anger had gone from his face. "I
  believe you about the safe. You're the first man or woman I've ever believed
  in my life. Sounds queer, huh? It is a fact. I'm not frightened of you...
  nobody knows that better than you." Sault nodded. "About Morelle...I'll talk
  to him. What is this girl...you're not in love with her yourself, huh? Can't
  imagine that. All right, I'll speak to Morelle...a damned cur! Anything
  more?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," said Ambrose, and went out. Steppe stared at the closed door.
  "A man," he said, and shivered. No other man breathing had caused Steppe to
  shiver.</p>

  <p>He saw Ronnie at a club late that night. "Here, I want you." He jerked his
  head in the direction of a quiet corner of the smoking-room, and Ronnie
  followed him, expecting compliments, for they had not met since the
  meeting.</p>

  <p>"You've got a parcel of women in tow, huh?" said Steppe.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand&mdash;" began Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"You understand all right. One of them is a friend of Sault's...
  Colebrook, I think her name must be. Go steady. She is a friend of Sault's.
  He says he'll break your neck if you monkey around there; do you get that,
  huh? Sault says so. He'll do it."</p>

  <p>Ronnie did not know Ambrose Sault any better than Ambrose knew him. The
  threat did not sound very dreadful and he smiled.</p>

  <p>"You can grin; maybe I'll see the same grin when I come to look at you on
  the mortuary slab. Sault is a hell of a bad man to cross. He has had his kill
  once, that will make the second seem like blowing bubbles. That's all."</p>

  <p>Ronnie was annoyed, but not greatly impressed. He only knew Sault as a
  sort of superior workman, who did the dirty work of the confederacy.
  Sometimes he used to wonder how Steppe employed him, but then he also
  speculated upon the exact standing of Moropulos whose name never appeared on
  a prospectus and who had, apparently, no particular duties. Threats did not
  greatly distress Ronnie Morelle. He had been threatened so often; and it was
  his experience that the worst was over when the threat came. He was free of
  the park now. Walking down Regent Street, one Saturday afternoon, he had come
  face to face with The Girl Who Had Screamed. She was with a tall,
  broad-shouldered young man and she had recognized him. After he had passed
  them, Ronnie, from the tail of his eye, saw the couple stop and the girl
  point after him. The man looked as though he were going to follow, but The
  Girl Who Had Screamed caught his arm. And that was the end of it. The man
  might hate him, but would not make a fuss. The offence was comparatively old,
  and men did not pursue other people's stale vendettas. The beginning and end
  of vengeance was a threatening gesture.</p>

  <p>He knew just what that broad-shouldered man was saying, and thinking. He
  was a scoundrel, he deserved flogging. If he had been on hand when the girl
  squealed, he would have torn the heart out of the offender. But he wasn't
  there; and the girl had shown both her purity and her intelligence by
  preferring his gentle courtship to the violent love-making of Ronnie Morelle.
  In a sense the incident was subtly flattering to the broad-shouldered young
  man.</p>

  <p>Ronnie was not seeing Evie in these days; he was more pleasingly engaged.
  The new game was infinitely more intriguing, an opponent better armed for the
  fight and offering a more glorious triumph. But Steppe's warning piqued him.
  Sault! His lips curled in derision. That nigger! That half-caste jail-bird!
  He wrote to Evie that night making an appointment.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap17"
     name="chap17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"You don't know how happy I was when I found your letter at
  the store this morning. The manager doesn't like girls to get letters; he is
  an awful fossil, but he's rather keen on me. I told him your letters were
  from an uncle who isn't friends with mother."</p>

  <p>"What a darling little liar you are!" said Ronnie, amused. "My dear, I've
  missed you terribly. I shall have to give up my writing if it is going to
  keep me from my girl." She snuggled closer to his side as they walked slowly
  through the gloom to her favourite spot. She did not tell him how she had sat
  there every evening, braving the importunities of those less attractive
  ghouls who haunt the park in the hours of dusk. "There have been times," said
  Ronnie when they had found chairs and drawn them to the shadow of a big elm,
  "when I felt that I could write no more unless I saw you for a moment. But I
  set my teeth and worked. I pretend sometimes that you are sitting on the
  other side of the table, and I look up and talk to you."</p>

  <p>"You are like Christina," said the delighted girl; "she makes up things
  like that. Would you have liked to see me really walk into the room and sit
  down opposite to you?"</p>

  <p>"Nine-tenths of my troubles would vanish," he said fervently, "and I could
  work...by heaven, how I should work if I had the inspiration of your company!
  I wish you weren't such a dear little puritan. I'm half inclined to engage a
  housekeeper if only to chaperon you." He waited for a rejoinder, but it did
  not come. "You have such queer ideas about how people should behave," he
  said. "In fact you are awfully old-fashioned, darling."</p>

  <p>"Am I...I suppose I am."</p>

  <p>"Why, the modern girl goes everywhere: bachelor parties and dances...
  chaperons are as much out of date as the dodo."</p>

  <p>"What is a dodo?"</p>

  <p>"A bird...a sort of duck." he gurgled with laughter.</p>

  <p>"You funny boy..."</p>

  <p>"You know Sault, don't you? Isn't he a great friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>She struggled up out of his arms. "Friend! Of course not, He is a great
  friend of Christina's, but not of mine. He is so old and funny-looking. He
  has grey hair and he is quite dark...when I say dark, I mean he is not a
  negro, but...well, dark."</p>

  <p>"I understand. Not a friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not. There are times when I can't stand him! He doesn't read or
  write, did you know that? Of course you do...and he has been in prison, you
  told me that too. If mother knew she would have a fit. Why do you talk about
  him, Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>"I've no special reason, only..."</p>

  <p>"Only what? Has he been talking about me?"</p>

  <p>"Not to me, of course...he told a friend of mine that he didn't like you
  to know me. It was a surprise to me that he was aware we were friends. Did
  you tell him?"</p>

  <p>"Me&mdash;I? Of course not. I never heard of such nerve! How dare he!"</p>

  <p>"Ssh...don't get angry, darling. I'm sure he meant well. You have to do
  something for me, Evie dear."</p>

  <p>"Talking about me!..."</p>

  <p>"What is the use." He bent his head and kissed her. "It will be easy for
  you to say that you've only met me once or twice...and that you are not
  seeing me any more."</p>

  <p>"But you...you will see me, Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>"Surely. You don't suppose that anything in the world will ever come
  between us, do you? Not fifty Saults."</p>

  <p>"It is Christina!" she said. "How mean of her to discuss me with Sault!
  And I've done so much for her; brought her books from the store and given her
  little things...I do think it is deceitful of her."</p>

  <p>"Will you do as I ask?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, Ronnie darling. I'll tell her that I've given you up. But she
  is terribly sharp and I must be careful. We sleep in the same room; ours is a
  very small house. I used to have a room of my own until Sault came&mdash;the
  horrid old man. He is in love with Christina. It does seem ridiculous,
  doesn't it, a man like that? Christina says she doesn't, but really...she is
  so deceitful."</p>

  <p>"Will you tell her what I suggest?" he insisted.</p>

  <p>"Yes...I'll tell her. As for Mr. Sault..."</p>

  <p>"Leave me to deal with Mr. Sault," said Ronnie grandly.</p>

  <p>Evie reached home, her little brain charged with conflicting emotions. Her
  relief at meeting the man again, the happiness that meeting had brought, her
  resentment at Sault's unwarranted interference, her hurt from Christina's
  supposed duplicity and breach of confidence, each contended for domination
  and each in turn triumphed. "I have given up Ronnie and I am not going to
  meet him again," she said, as she entered the room.</p>

  <p>She was without finesse and Christina, instantly alert, was not impressed.
  "This is very sudden. What has happened?"</p>

  <p>"I've given him up!" Evie slammed her hat down on the rickety dressing-
  table. She had no intention of letting the matter rest there. Her annoyance
  with Sault must be expressed. "If a girl cannot have a friendship without her
  own sister and her sister's friends making up all sorts of stories about her
  and breaking their sacred word, too, by telling people about their private
  affairs, then she'd better give up having friendships," she said a trifle
  incoherently.</p>

  <p>"I want to sort that out," said Christina, frowning. "The only thing I'm
  perfectly sure about, is that somebody is behaving badly. Do you mean that
  people have been talking about you and your...Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>Evie glowered at her. "You know...you know!" she blurted tremulously. "You
  and Sault between you, trying to interfere in my...interfering in my
  affairs."</p>

  <p>"Oh," said Christina, "is that all?"</p>

  <p>"Is that all! Don't you think it enough, parting Ronnie and I? Breaking my
  heart, that is what you're doing!" she wailed. "I'll never speak to Sault
  again. The old murderer...that's what he is, a murderer! I'm going to tell
  mother and have him chucked out of the house. We're not safe. Some night
  he'll come along with a knife and cut our throats. A nigger murderer," she
  screamed, "he may be good enough to be your friend, but he's not good enough
  for me!"</p>

  <p>"Open the window and tell the street all about it." suggested Christina.
  "You'll get an audience in no time! Go along! Open the window! They would
  love to hear. Every woman in this street screams her trouble, sooner or
  later. The woman across the road was shouting 'murder' all last night. Be
  fashionable, Evie. Ronnie would love to know that you made a hit in Walter
  Street."</p>

  <p>Evie was weeping now. "You're horrible and vulgar, and I wish I was dead.
  You've...parted Ronnie and I...you and Sault."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," said Christina quietly, "my impression is that you are
  saying what Ronnie told you to say."</p>

  <p>"I swear&mdash;" began Evie.</p>

  <p>"Don't swear, Evie, screech. It is more convincing. Ronnie told you to say
  that you had given him up. What did Ambrose Sault do?"</p>

  <p>"He went to a friend of Ronnie's with a lot of lies...about me and Ronnie.
  And you must have told him, Christina. It was mean, mean, mean of you!"</p>

  <p>"He didn't want telling. He heard you the other night when you were having
  hysterics and yelling 'Oh, Ronnie, Ronnie!' at the top of your voice. You did
  everything except give Ronnie's address and telephone number. Apart from
  that, I did tell him. I wanted to know what kind of man you're raving about.
  And your Ronnie is just dirt."</p>

  <p>"Don't dare to say that&mdash;don't dare!"</p>

  <p>"If mother didn't sleep like a dormouse she'd hear you. Some people think
  they can make white black if they shout 'black' loudly enough. Ronald Morelle
  has a bad reputation with girls. I don't care if you foam at the mouth, Evie,
  I'm going to say it. He is a blackguard!"</p>

  <p>"Sault told you! Sault told you!" Evie's voice had a shrill thin edge to
  it. "I know he did...a murderer, a nigger murderer, that is what he is. Not
  fit to live under the same roof as me...I shall tell Ronnie what he is."</p>

  <p>"As you are permanently parted, I don't see how you will have an
  opportunity of telling him," said Christina. "I could have told him myself
  today, I saw him."</p>

  <p>"Saw him, how?" Evie was surprised into interest.</p>

  <p>"With my eyes. Mr. Sault took me into Kensington Gardens and I saw
  him&mdash;he pointed him out to me."</p>

  <p>Evie smiled contemptuously. "That is where you and your damned Sault were
  wrong," she said in triumph. "Ronnie has been working in his flat all the
  afternoon! He was writing an article for The Statesman!"</p>

  <p>"He didn't seem to be working very hard when I saw him," said Christina,
  unmoved, "unless he was dictating his article to Miss Merville. They were
  driving together. Sault said: "There is Morelle'&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He should have said 'Mister'."</p>

  <p>"And I saw him. He is good-looking; the best-looking man I have ever
  seen."</p>

  <p>"It wasn't Ronnie...I don't mean that Ronnie isn't good-looking. He's
  lovely. But it couldn't have been him. Besides, he hates that Merville girl,
  at least he doesn't like her. You are only saying this to make me jealous.
  How was he dressed?"</p>

  <p>"So far as I could see, he wore a long-tailed coat&mdash;he certainly had
  a top hat. Mr. Sault said that he thought he had been to Lady
  Somebody-or-other's garden-party. Mr. Steppe was going, but couldn't get
  away."</p>

  <p>"Now I know it wasn't Ronnie! He was wearing a blue suit...no, he hadn't
  changed his clothes. He told me he didn't dress until an hour before he met
  me. Sault is a...he must have been mistaken."</p>

  <p>Before she went to bed she came over to say 'good night'. "I'm sorry I
  lost my temper, Chris."</p>

  <p>"My dear, if you lose nothing else I shall be happy."</p>

  <p>"I hate your insinuations, Christina! Some day you will find out what a
  splendid man Ronnie is...and then you'll be surprised."</p>

  <p>"I shall," admitted Christina, and later, when Evie was dropping into
  sleep: "Who did Ambrose kill?"</p>

  <p>"Eh?...I don't know. Somebody in Paris..." Another long silence.</p>

  <p>"He must have been a terrible villain!"</p>

  <p>"Who, Sault?"</p>

  <p>"No, the man he killed," said Christina.</p>

  <p>She lay awake for a long time. It was two o'clock when she heard his key
  in the lock. She raised her head, listening to the creaking of the stairs as
  he came up. He had to pass her room and she whispered: "Good night,
  Ambrose!"</p>

  <p>"Good night, Christina." She blew a kiss at the door.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap18"
     name="chap18">CHAPTER XVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MR. STEPPE, with a gardenia in his buttonhole, leant out of
  the window of his car and waved his yellow glove in greeting, and Beryl, who
  was just about to enter her own machine, stepped back upon the sidewalk and
  waited. She felt a little twinge of impatience, for she was on her way to the
  Horse Show and Ronald. "Is the doctor in? Good! He can wait...Where are you
  off to, Beryl, huh? Looking perfectly lovely too...I often wonder what those
  old backveld relations of mine would say if they ever saw a girl like you.
  Their women are just trek-oxen...mustn't say 'cows', huh! Are you in a great
  hurry?"</p>

  <p>"Not a great hurry," she smiled, "but I think father is expecting
  you."</p>

  <p>"I know. But he'll not be worried if I'm late. Drive me somewhere. I want
  to talk."</p>

  <p>She jumped at the opportunity of placing a time-limit on the conversation.
  "Drive to Regent's Park, round the inner circle an back to the house," she
  ordered, and Mr. Steppe handed her into the car. "I want to have a little
  chat about your father," he said, greatly to her surprise. He had never
  before spoken more than two consecutive sentences in reference to Dr.
  Merville. "What I tell you, Beryl, is in confidence," he said. "I'm not sure
  whether I ought to tell you at all, but you're a sensible girl, huh? No
  nonsense. That is how a woman should be. The doctor has lost a lot of
  money&mdash;you know that?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't know," she answered in alarm, "but I thought that father
  confined his investments to your companies?"</p>

  <p>"Yes...so he has. He has taken up a lot of shares...against my advice. He
  is carrying...well I shouldn't like to tell you the figure. He bought
  them&mdash;against my advice. Most of my stock is only partly paid up. He is
  carrying nearly a million shares in one concern or another. That is all
  right. You can carry millions, always providing there is a market, and that
  you can sell at a profit, or else that there isn't any need to call up the
  remainder of the capital. That need has arisen in the case of two companies
  in which he is heavily involved. Now, Beryl, you are not to say a word about
  what I have told you."</p>

  <p>"But...I don't quite follow what you have said. Does it mean that father
  will be called upon to pay large sums of money?" He nodded. "Or else...
  ?"</p>

  <p>"There is no 'or else'," said Steppe. "The capital has to be called in, in
  justice to the shareholders, and the doctor must pay. Somebody must pay. In
  fact, I am going to pay. That was the reason I was calling on him today."</p>

  <p>"He has been very worried lately," said Beryl in a troubled tone. "I don't
  know how to thank you, Mr. Steppe. Is it a big sum?"</p>

  <p>"It runs to hundreds of thousands," said Steppe. "Very few can lay their
  hands on that amount, huh? Jan Steppe! They know me in the city, hate me,
  would slaughter me, but they don't despise me. I can sign cheques for a
  million and they'd be honoured."</p>

  <p>"But father must make some arrangement to pay you, Mr. Steppe..." she
  began.</p>

  <p>"That is nothing. The shares may rise in value...there is no telling what
  may happen with the market in an optimistic mood. But I thought I would let
  you know. Steppe isn't a bad fellow, huh?"</p>

  <p>She heaved a long sigh. "No...you are kind, most kind. I wish father
  wouldn't touch the stock-market. Temperamentally, he is unfitted for a
  gambler. He is so easily depressed. Can't you persuade him, Mr. Steppe?"</p>

  <p>"If you say the word, I'll stop him," said Steppe "There is nothing I
  wouldn't do for you, Beryl."</p>

  <p>She was silent. "I'm grateful," she said, as the car was heading for the
  house. "I cannot put myself under any bigger obligation...father must do as
  he wishes. But if you could help him with advice..."</p>

  <p>It occurred to her then that if he could, at a word arrest the speculative
  tendencies of Dr. Merville, why had he contented himself with 'advice' when
  her father had made his disastrous investments? Saying goodbye to him at the
  door of the house, Beryl drove on to Olympia a disturbed and anxious
  girl.</p>

  <p>Steppe watched the car out of sight before he mounted the step and rang
  the bell. "You saw us, huh? Yes, I wanted to talk to Beryl and I knew that
  you wouldn't mind waiting. I've got to call up the unpaid capital of Brakpan
  Mines and Toledo Deeps."</p>

  <p>The doctor moved uneasily. "Couldn't you wait a little while?" he asked
  nervously. "The shares are moving. They went up a fraction
  yesterday&mdash;which means that there are buyers."</p>

  <p>"I was the buyer," said Steppe. "I took a feeler at the market. I bought
  five hundred&mdash;and I could have had five hundred thousand at the price.
  They were falling over one another to sell. No, I'm afraid I've got to make a
  call and you'll have to take up your shares, huh? Well, I'm going to let you
  have the money."</p>

  <p>"That is good of you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. I must keep your name sweet and clean, Merville. I am going
  to marry Beryl."</p>

  <p>The doctor opened a silver box and took out a cigar with a shaking hand.
  "Beryl is a very dear girl," he said. "Have you spoken to her?"</p>

  <p>"No, there is plenty of time. I don't want to scare her&mdash;let her get
  used to me, Merville, huh? That's the way. You are crossing with me tonight,
  huh? Good, I hate the Le Havre route, but you can sleep on board and that
  saves time. Abrahams is coming from Vienna with the Bulgarian concession. I'm
  inclined to float it."</p>

  <p>Ronnie was waiting in the main entrance when the girl arrived. In some
  respects he was a model escort. He never expected a woman to be punctual and
  had trained himself in the art of patient waiting. "No, really, I haven't
  been here very long," he replied to her apology, "and you, of all women, are
  worth waiting for."</p>

  <p>"You are a dear. I don't believe you, but still you are dear. I'm so sick
  of life today, Ronnie...don't ask me why. Amuse me."</p>

  <p>"How is the doctor?" he queried, as they were shown into their seats.</p>

  <p>"He is going to Paris tonight with Mr. Steppe," she said. "I'm rather
  glad. Two or three days abroad will do him lot of good. There aren't many
  people here this afternoon, Ronnie."</p>

  <p>"Most of the swells are at Ascot," he explained; "the night seance is
  crowded. Gone to Paris, eh?"</p>

  <p>The news made him thoughtful.</p>

  <p>She drove him back to the house to tea. Dr. Merville was out and was not
  returning to dinner. The maid said he had left a letter in his study. Beryl
  found it to be a note saying he was unlikely to see her before he went. His
  bag would be called for, he added.</p>

  <p>"My hard-hearted parent has gone without saying goodbye," she said. "Take
  me out to dinner, Ronnie. After I would like to see a revue. I feel
  unintellectual today; I'm in the mood when I want to see people with red
  noses and baggy trousers. And I want to be in a box. I love boxes,
  since...</p>

  <p>Ronald Morelle walked home from Park Crescent stopping at a messenger
  office to scribble a note.</p>

  <p>"It is at a drug store in Knightsbridge," he said. "I want the boy to give
  it to the young lady in the pay desk. Perhaps he had better make a
  purchase...a cake of soap, if that is the boy," he smiled upon the diminutive
  messenger, "and let him hand the letter to the lady when he puts in his
  bill."</p>

  <p>He came to the flat to find Francois laying out his dress clothes. "Finish
  what you are doing and go home. I shall not want you this evening," he said.
  "Stay&mdash;have a bottle put on ice. You can lay the small table. You might
  have bought some flowers. I hate flowers but&mdash;get some. You can throw
  them away tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'sieur," said his imperturbable man, "for how many shall I lay
  supper?"</p>

  <p>"For three," answered Ronnie. It was a convention that he invariably
  entertained two guests, but Francois had never had to wash more than two used
  glasses.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap19"
     name="chap19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BERYL was still in the drawing-room and the tea-table had
  not been cleared when Ambrose Sault came for the doctor's bag. She heard the
  sound of his voice in the hall and came to the head of the stairs. "Is that
  you, Mr. Sault? Won't you come up for moment?" The doctor had telephoned to
  Moropulos, he explained, asking him to take the grip to his club. She
  gathered that it was usual for Ambrose to carry out these little
  commissions.</p>

  <p>"How is Miss Colebrook...has she forgiven me for acting the part of
  district visitor? She is a nice girl and her hair is such a wonderful
  colour."</p>

  <p>"The osteopath says she will get well," replied Ambrose simply, "and when
  I went in to see her this morning she told me she really thought that she
  felt better already. She has the heart of a lion, Miss Merville."</p>

  <p>"She is certainly brave." Beryl knew she was a brute because she could not
  work up an enthusiastic interest in Christina Colebrook.</p>

  <p>"It will be wonderful if she is cured." Sault's voice as hushed. "I
  daren't let myself think about it&mdash;in fact, I shall be more bitterly
  disappointed than she if the treatment does not succeed."</p>

  <p>"You are very fond of her?" She had been examining his face as he spoke,
  wondering what there was in him that she had seen at their first meeting
  which reminded her of Ronnie. There was not a vestige of likeness between
  them. This man's face, for all its strength, was coarse; the eyes were the
  only fine features it possessed. And the skin...there was a yellow-brown
  tinge in it. She remembered her father saying once that people who had negro
  blood in their veins betrayed their origin, even though they were quite
  white, by a dark half-moon on their finger-nails. Whilst he was speaking he
  moved his hands so that the nails were discernible. They were ugly nails,
  broad and ragged of edge...yes, there it was. A brown crescent showing
  against the deep pink.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I'm very fond of her. She is lovable. I haven't met anybody like
  Christina before." Why was she annoyed? Perhaps 'annoyed' hardly described
  her emotion. She was disappointed in him. Her attitude toward Sault was
  enigmatical&mdash;it was certainly capricious. She was a little nauseated and
  was glad when he went.</p>

  <p>Sault carried the suitcase to the club and left it with a porter. He
  wished he had an excuse for calling every day at the house...the sight of her
  exalted him, raised him instantly to a higher plane. He saw Evie walking home
  in front of him; she saw him, stopped, and became interested in a shop
  window. She always avoided him in the street and would not dream of walking
  with him. In the kitchen, to which she followed him, she condescended to
  speak.</p>

  <p>"You were looking very pleased with yourself when I saw you in High
  Street, Mr. Sault," she said.</p>

  <p>"Was I?...yes, I was feeling good. You're home early tonight, Evie."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook had a washing day and was at her labours in the scullery,
  and Evie could flare up without reproof. "I'm so glad you notice when I come
  in, and go out!" she said. "It is nice to know that all your movements are
  watched. I suppose I ought to ask your permission when I stay out late? We
  always like to please the lodger!"</p>

  <p>He looked down into the pretty flushed face and smile gently. "I believe
  you are trying to be cross with me, Evie," he said good-naturedly, "and I
  don't feel like being cross with anybody. My dear, it is no business of
  mine&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't call me 'my dear' if you please! You have nerve to 'my dear' me! A
  man like you!"</p>

  <p>Sault's knuckle touched his chin awkwardly. "I didn't mean to be
  offensive&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are offensive! You are the most beastly offensive person I know! You
  go prying and spying into my business and telling lies about gentlemen whose
  boots you're not fit to blacken."</p>

  <p>"Hello, hello!" Mrs. Colebrook stood in the kitchen doorway, wiping her
  soapy hands on her apron. "What's this, Evie? Telling lies about you? Mr.
  Sault would not tell a lie to save his life. What gentleman? He'd have to be
  a pretty good gentleman for Mr. Sault to black his boots."</p>

  <p>Evie wilted before her mother's fiery gaze and, turning, slammed from the
  room. "It is nothing, Mrs. Colebrook," smiled Ambrose. "I made her angry...
  something I said. It was my fault entirely. Now what about those
  blankets?"</p>

  <p>"You're not going to wash any blankets," said Mr Colebrook, "and Evie has
  got to say she is sorry."</p>

  <p>"I washed blankets before you were born, Mrs. Colebrook, or soon after, at
  any rate. I promised you I'd come home and help you." He went with her to the
  little scullery with its copper and wash tub, she protesting.</p>

  <p>"I didn't think you meant it," she said, "and I can't let you do it. You
  go into the kitchen and I'll make you a cup of tea."</p>

  <p>"Blankets," said Ambrose, rolling up his sleeves.</p>

  <p>Evie burst into her room, red with anger. She hated Sault more than ever.
  She said so, flinging her hat wildly on the bed. "Oh...was that who you were
  strafing?" asked Christina.</p>

  <p>"I gave him a piece of my mind," said Evie, with satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"That was generous, considering the size of it." Christina bent outward
  and laid down the paper and dactylograph she had been using. "I couldn't have
  done that a few days ago," she said, "and what has poor Ambrose done?"</p>

  <p>"He had the cheek to tell me I was home very early, as if he was the lord
  of the house!"</p>

  <p>"Aren't you home early?"</p>

  <p>"It is no business of his, the interfering old devil!"</p>

  <p>Christina eyed her critically. "You came home in a bad temper," she said.
  "I suppose giving up Ronnie has got on your nerves."</p>

  <p>"I haven't given him up!" Evie snapped, "only he's busy tonight."</p>

  <p>Christina chewed a toffee ball reflectively. "That man is certainly
  industrious," she said; "they will have to bring out new papers to print all
  he writes. Does he find time to eat?" Evie lifted her nose scornfully. "What
  did you say to my Ambrose?"</p>

  <p>"I told you."</p>

  <p>"You said that you gave him a piece of your mind&mdash;that doesn't mean
  anything to me. Did you call him a murderer?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I didn't...I hope I'm a lady."</p>

  <p>"I've often hoped so, and maybe one of these days my hopes will be
  realized. So you didn't call him a murderer? You lost a great opportunity.
  Don't be offensive to him again, Evie," she said quietly. Evie did not reply.
  When Christina spoke in that tone of voice she was frightened of her. "What
  is Ambrose doing now?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know...in the kitchen I suppose, guzzling food. And I'm starving!
  But I won't sit down at the same table as a black man, I won't!"</p>

  <p>"Don't be a fool, Evie. Go down and get some food. You can bring it up
  here and eat it. And Evie...Ambrose is a very dear friend of mine and I
  dislike hearing you call him a 'black man'. He is almost as white as you and
  I. His great grandfather was an Indian."</p>

  <p>"If you don't like to hear me say unpleasant thing about your friends,
  don't say them about mine."</p>

  <p>Here, Evie thought, not without reason, that she had a point which was
  worth labouring. She was astonished when Christina surrendered without firing
  another shot. "Perhaps you are right, dear. Go and get something to eat."</p>

  <p>Evie returned almost immediately with the news that the kitchen was empty
  and that she had seen one whom she was pleased to describe as 'the enemy'
  bending over a wash tub, his arms white with lather. "Do you think he is
  making up to mother?" she asked, as that interesting possibility presented
  itself.</p>

  <p>Christina choked. "Don't say funny things when I'm eating candy," she
  begged.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap20"
     name="chap20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE revue had reached its seventh scene before Beryl and her
  escort were shown into the big stage box of the Pavilion. She had hardly
  taken her seat before she saw a familiar face in the stalls.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that Mr. Moropulos?" she asked, and following the direction of her
  eyes he nodded.</p>

  <p>The Greek did not appear to have noticed them. He was conspicuous as being
  the only man in that row of the stalls who was not wearing evening dress.
  "Yes, that is Moropulos. Don't let him see you, Beryl."</p>

  <p>Apparently Mr. Moropulos did not identify the pair, for though he turned
  his head in their direction he showed no sign of recognition. Half-way
  through the last part of the revue he disappeared, and they did not see him
  again. "And now home. It has been a jolly afternoon and evening," said Beryl,
  as they came out.</p>

  <p>Ronnie was looking round for his car. "What a fool I am," he said. "I told
  Parker not to wait...for some extraordinary reason I imagined your car would
  be here. We'll have to take a taxi."</p>

  <p>The cab had hardly started before he tapped at the window and, leaning
  out, gave a fresh direction. "Come home and have some supper. I've just
  remembered that I told Francois I was bringing a couple of men home...told
  him early this morning."</p>

  <p>She hesitated. "I can't stay very long," she said. "No...nobody is waiting
  for me. My maid never does...it spoils my enjoyment of a dance if I think
  that I am keeping some poor girl out of her bed. I'll come in for five
  minutes, dear."</p>

  <p>His arm came round her, her head drooped toward him. "Ronnie...I'm so glad
  all this has come about, darling...I've run after you...I know I have. But I
  don't care...four years seems such an awful long time to wait."</p>

  <p>"An eternity," he breathed.</p>

  <p>"And marriage is, as you say...in your immoral way...only a third party
  sanction...it is silly."</p>

  <p>He kissed her. An automatic lift carried them to the third floor and
  Ronnie went in, switching on the lights. "I wonder whether father will be
  angry," she asked. "If your man..."</p>

  <p>"He sleeps out." Ronnie helped her off with her wrap. "He's never here
  after nine. This is my own room, Beryl&mdash;but you saw it when the doctor
  brought you here to dinner."</p>

  <p>She walked over to the big black table and sat down. "Here genius broods,"
  she laughed quietly. "What a humbug you are, Ronnie! I don't believe you
  write a thousand words a month!" He smiled indulgently. "And there is your
  wicked Anthony! He looks worse by artificial light. Now, Ronnie, I really
  must go."</p>

  <p>"Go?"&mdash;incredulously, "with foie-gras sandwiches and beautifully dry
  wine?" The door into the dining-room was open and he pointed. "It is the last
  bottle of that wine. Jerry will be furious when he comes to breakfast in the
  morning and finds it gone." Ronnie had a friend, one Jeremiah Talbot, a man
  after his own heart. Beryl had met him once, a languid, loose lipped man with
  a reputation for gallantry.</p>

  <p>"Well...I'll eat just a little...and then you must take me home. You
  shouldn't have paid off the cab."</p>

  <p>He was too busy at the wine bucket to listen. She sat on the edge of one
  of the window chesterfields and let her eyes rove around the room, and after
  a while he brought a plate of sandwiches and a filled glass. She put her lips
  to the wine and handed it back to him "No more, dear."</p>

  <p>A sudden panic had taken possession of her, and she was shaking. "No!..."
  And yet it was so natural and so comforting to let him hold her. She relaxed,
  unresisting. "I shouldn't be here, Ronnie," she murmured between his kisses;
  "let me go, darling...please." But he held her the tighter and she did not
  deny his lips.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap21"
     name="chap21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RONNIE woke with a start, stared at the window and cursed.
  Pulling on a dressing-gown he slipped from the room and at the sight of him
  the woman who was dusting the side-board paused in her work. "I don't want
  you here today...where is your friend?"</p>

  <p>"In the pantry, sir."</p>

  <p>"Well, take her with you...ah, Francois, listen. Turn these women out and
  then go out yourself...go to the city...and get...buy anything you like, but
  don't come back before eleven...no, twelve."</p>

  <p>He waited until the flat was empty and returned to his room. Beryl was
  lying with her head in the crook of her arm. She was not asleep...nor crying,
  as he had feared. "I'm dreadfully sorry, darling...I must have fallen
  asleep."</p>

  <p>"What is the time?" She did not turn, but spoke into the pillow. "Eight...
  curse it! You can't go home in evening dress."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" She struggled up, her face averted. "It is the best way," she
  said. "Will you get me a cab?" When he came up again, she was tidying her
  hair at the mirror. "It was very foolish," she remarked, without emotion.</p>

  <p>"There is nobody below, and thank God there was an Albert Hall ball last
  night," said Ronnie, "and it is only eight...shall I come down with you?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No...just show me how to work the elevator. An Albert
  Hall ball? Where could I have been after that finished? You lie better than
  I, Ronnie."</p>

  <p>"Having breakfast...lots of people make a special function of breakfast
  after those shows."</p>

  <p>"All right...show me how the elevator works."</p>

  <p>To her maid a quarter of an hour later: "I'm going to bed, Dean, and if
  Mr. Morelle rings up will you tell him that I am sorry I cannot see him this
  morning. You can bring me a cup of chocolate...yes, I've had breakfast, but
  bring me some chocolate."</p>

  <p>She was standing by the window in a silk wrap when the maid brought the
  tray. Beryl did not look round. "Put it down, Dean...I will ring when I want
  you."</p>

  <p>She walked across the room and locked the door. Then she came to the
  mirror and looked for a long time at herself. "Yes...Beryl...Beryl...it is
  you! I was hoping it was somebody else."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap22"
     name="chap22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THAT same morning Mr. Moropulos asked a question of Ambrose
  Sault. "What exposure should you give to a photograph taken, say, soon after
  eight o'clock in the morning?"</p>

  <p>"What sort of a morning?"</p>

  <p>"This morning."</p>

  <p>Ambrose glanced out of the window.</p>

  <p>"You could get a snapshot on a twenty-fifth of a second."</p>

  <p>Mr. Moropulos produced a folding Kodak from his pocket. "Would this stop
  be wide enough?"</p>

  <p>Ambrose took the camera in his hand. "Yes," he said. "What were you
  taking, a scene or a figure?"</p>

  <p>"A figure," said Mr. Moropulos, "a lady in evening dress."</p>

  <p>Ambrose smiled. "Eight o'clock is a funny time to photograph a lady in
  evening dress," he said.</p>

  <p>"An amusing time...if one hadn't been waiting up all night to take it. I
  was here at five. Yes...I came back for the camera. I took a chance of
  missing the lady, but even if I had it wouldn't have mattered. But eight
  o'clock!" he laughed gleefully&mdash;"how very obliging! Sault, my Ambrosial
  man, I am going to sleep."</p>

  <p>"I think you need it," said Ambrose. He did all the work of the house,
  even to making Mr. Moropulos' bed, and he was glad of the opportunity to
  'spring clean' the sitting-room. He only interrupted his labours to cut a
  crust of bread and a slice of cheese for his lunch. At five o'clock in the
  afternoon the telephone bell rang for the first time that day. "Is that Mr.
  Moropulos...is that you, Mr. Sault?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, lady." He recognized her voice instantly and his heart leapt within
  him. "I'm so glad...will you come to the house, please?"</p>

  <p>"Yes...I'll come right away." He hung up the receiver as Moropulos
  strolled in, yawning. "He-e! Who was the caller?"</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine," said Sault.</p>

  <p>"Didn't know you had any friends...are you going? Make me some coffee
  before you go, Sault."</p>

  <p>"Make it yourself," said Ambrose.</p>

  <p>Moropulos grinned after him. "I'd give a lot of money to stick a knife
  into that big chest of yours, my good Ambrose," he said pleasantly.</p>

  <p>Marie opened the door to the untidy visitor, showing him straight to the
  drawing-room, and Beryl came half-way to him, taking his hand in both of
  hers. "I'm so glad you've come...I had to send for you...Do you mind? I want
  to talk to you about nothing in particular...I'm nervy. Can't you tell from
  my hand?"</p>

  <p>The hand in his was shaking, he felt the quiver of it. And she looked
  pale. Why had she sent for him? She was amazed at herself. Perhaps it was his
  strength she wanted; a rock on which she might rebuild the shattered fabric
  of her reason. She had been thinking of him all the afternoon.</p>

  <p>Ronnie never came to her mind. He was incidental...reality lay with the
  coarse-featured man whom she had likened to a Caesar. "I don't want you to do
  anything for me, except be here. Just for a little while." She was pleading
  like a frightened child.</p>

  <p>"I am here&mdash;I will stay here until you want me to go," said Ambrose,
  and smiled into her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Sault, I do so want to talk about something. It won't hurt you, will
  it?" She had only released his hands to pull a chair forward. Opposite to him
  she sat, this time both of her hands in his. Why? She gave up asking the
  question. "You killed somebody, is it true?...I knew it was true before I
  asked you. Did it injure you...make you think less of yourself...did you
  loathe the man you killed because he made you do it? You are looking at me so
  strangely...You don't think I am mad, do you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think you are mad. No, I didn't even hate the man. He deserved
  death. I did not wish to kill him, but there was no other way. There must be
  that definite end to some problems...death. There is no other. I believe
  implicitly in it...destruction. A man who is so vile that he kills in his
  greed or his lust, who takes an innocent and a helpful life&mdash;helpful to
  the world and its people&mdash;you must destroy him. The law does this, so
  that the brain behind his wicked hands shall not lead him to further
  mischief. If you have a sheepdog that worries sheep you shoot him. There is
  no other way. Or he will breed other sheepdogs with the same vice. Most
  problems are soluble by various processes. Some of them drastic, some of them
  commonplace. A few, a very few, can only be ended that way. My man was one of
  these. I won't tell you the story...he was a bad man and I killed him. But I
  didn't hate him, nor hate myself. And I think no less of myself...and no
  more. I did what I thought was right...I've never regretted it, but I've
  never been proud of it."</p>

  <p>She listened, fascinated. The hands in his were quiet now, there was a hue
  in her cheeks. "How fine to feel like that...to detach yourself...but why
  should you regret? You injured no one. Except the man and...was he
  married?"</p>

  <p>He nodded. "I didn't know at the time. She came forward afterwards and
  paid the expenses of my defence...She hated him...It was very sad."</p>

  <p>They were quiet together until she lifted her head and spoke. "Mr.
  Sault...I'm going to ask you another strange question. Have you, in all your
  life, ever been in love?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said instantly.</p>

  <p>"With a woman, just because she is a woman? As I might love a man because
  he has all the outward attractions of a man? Have you loved her just for her
  beauty and despised her mean soul and her vicious mind, and...and
  despising...still loved?" She hung upon his words, and when he said 'no' her
  heart sank.</p>

  <p>"No...no, I couldn't do that. That would be...horrible!" He shuddered.</p>

  <p>She had made Ambrose Sault shudder! Ambrose Sault who spoke calmly of
  murder, had shuddered at something, which to him was worse than murder. The
  fragrance of sin which had held to her and supported her through the day, was
  stale and sour and filthy. She shrank away from him, but he held her hands
  tightly.</p>

  <p>"Let me go, please." Her voice sounded faint.</p>

  <p>"In a moment...look at me, lady." She raised her eyes to his and they held
  them. "I am going to say something to you that I never dreamt I would say; I
  never thought the words would come to me. Look at me, lady, a rough
  man...old...I'm more than fifty, ugly, with an old man's shape and an old
  man's hands. Illiterate...I love you. I shall never see you again...I love
  you. You are beautiful...the most beautiful lady I have seen. But it isn't
  that. There is something in you that I love...I don't know what...soul...
  spirit...individuality. I hope I haven't revolted you...I don't think I
  have."</p>

  <p>"Ambrose!" She clutched at the hands he was drawing away. "I must tell
  you...there is nothing to love but what you see...there is no soul...no
  soul...nothing but weakness and a pitiful cowardice...I love a man who is
  like that, too. Foul, foul! But beautiful to look at...and, Ambrose, I have
  given him all that he can take."</p>

  <p>Not a muscle of his face moved.</p>

  <p>"I have given him everything...this very day...that is why I sent for you.
  There must be something in what you say...a spirit in me responds to
  you...oh, Ambrose, I love him!" She was sobbing against the stained and
  ravelled coat. There was a scent of some pungent oil...turpentine...But he
  did not speak. His big hand touched her head lightly, smoothing her hair.
  "You think I'm...what do you think I am?" she asked. "You know."</p>

  <p>He patted her shoulder gently. "I suppose you are wondering what I am
  feeling? I will tell you this...I am not hurt. I can't be hurt, for you have
  lost nothing which I prize. If you were different, you wouldn't like me to
  say that." He took her face between his rough hands and looked into her eyes.
  "How very beautiful it is!" he said.</p>

  <p>She shut her eyes tight to keep back the tears. "I said I wouldn't see you
  again. Perhaps I won't, but if you want me, send for me."</p>

  <p>She dried her eyes. "I'm a weakling...I wish I was wicked and didn't
  care...I don't care, really. What has happened is..." she shrugged, "it is
  the discovery of my own rottenness that has shocked me...nearly driven me
  mad. You are going now, Ambrose...that is so lovely of you...you even know
  when to go!" She laughed nervously and laid her two hands on his shoulder.
  She did not want to kiss or to be kissed. And she knew that he felt as she
  did. "Come to me when I want you. I shall be busy inventing lies for the next
  few days. Goodbye, Ambrose."</p>

  <p>When he had gone, she realized that no man's name had been mentioned.
  Perhaps he knew.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap23"
     name="chap23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR the first time in his life Ronald Morelle was regretting
  an adventure. All day long he had been trying to write, with the result that
  his waste-paper basket was full of torn and twisted sheets, even as the
  silver ashtray on the table was heaped with cigarette ends. He had gone half
  a dozen times to the telephone to call up Merville's house and had stopped
  short of giving the number. Then he tried to write her a note. He could think
  of nothing to say beyond the flamboyant beginning. What was the use of
  writing? And what was she thinking about it all? He wished...and he wished
  again.</p>

  <p>He had made a hopeless fool of himself. Why had he done it? For the truth
  unfolded as the hours passed, that an end must be found to this affair. In
  other cases finis had been written at his discretion, sometimes cheerfully.
  sometimes with tears and recriminations. There had been instances that called
  for solid compensations. Beryl was not to be ended that way. Besides. he had
  half-promised her...</p>

  <p>He grew hot at the very thought of matrimony, and in the discomfort of the
  prospect, the pleasant irresponsibilities of bachelorhood, and the features
  that went to the making of his life, too good to lose. In such a mood he
  thought of Evie Colebrook. How perfectly attractive she was; he could admire
  her virtue, and cold-bloodedly compare her with Beryl. To Beryl's
  disparagement.</p>

  <p>He was hemmed in by his new responsibility; ached to be free from fetters
  that were still warm from the forge. Late at night he wrote two letters, one
  to Beryl, the other and the longer to Evie. Beryl had hers with her morning
  tea, saw who it was from the moment the maid pulled aside the curtains and
  let in the morning sunlight. She turned it over in her hand...now she knew.
  So that was how she felt about a letter from Ronnie. Not so much as a tremor,
  not a quicker pulsation of heart. She opened the envelope and read: 'My very
  dearest,&mdash;I don't know what to write to you or how. I adore the memory
  of you. I am shaken by the calamity&mdash;for you. Command me; I will do as
  you wish. I will not see you again though it breaks my heart.'</p>

  <p>It was written on a plain card, unsigned, a wire that morning: She sent
  him 'Come to tea'. In answer came a hurried note by special delivery. 'I
  cannot: I dare not trust myself. I am overwhelmed by the sense of my
  treachery. That I should have brought a second's unhappiness to you!'
  Unsigned. Ronnie never signed or dated such epistles.</p>

  <p>She read the note and laughed. Yes, she could laugh.</p>

  <p>On the third evening, her father returned in almost cheerful frame of
  mind. And he had enjoyed the trip, having met a number of French medical men
  who had entertained him. "They were charming, and the new Pasteur
  laboratories were most fascinating. We feared you would have had a dull time,
  Beryl. I hope Ronnie didn't desert you!"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid he didn't," she said, and the doctor beamed.</p>

  <p>"You're not too fond of him, I am glad of that, for he is rather a rascal.
  I suppose young men, some young men, are like that...conscienceless."</p>

  <p>"Did you have a good crossing?" she asked, and turned the conversation
  into a more pleasant way.</p>

  <p>"Sault was to have met us at the station but he did not turn up. Perhaps
  Moropulos is drinking. One never knows when Moropulos will break out. He is
  afraid of Steppe."</p>

  <p>"Who isn't?" she asked, with a grimace.</p>

  <p>The doctor scratched his cheek meditatively. "I don't know...I'm not
  afraid of him. Naturally I shouldn't like a rough and tumble with him,
  physically or verbally. Ronnie, of course, is in the most abject terror of
  him. The only man who isn't...er...reluctant to provoke him, is Sault." He
  chuckled. "Steppe told me that he had a row with Sault over some girl that
  Ronnie had been carrying on with...the daughter of the woman Colebrook, my
  dear. Apparently Sault went to our friend Jan and told him to put a stop to
  it, and Steppe was naturally annoyed, and do you know what Sault said?" Her
  eyes were shining. "He told Steppe that in certain contingencies he would
  kill him, before his servant could reach him; to his face!"</p>

  <p>"What did Mr. Steppe think of it?" she found her voice to ask.</p>

  <p>"Amused...and impressed too. He says Sault wouldn't tell a lie, wouldn't
  do a mean thing to save his soul. That is something of a testimonial from a
  man like Steppe who, I am sorry to say, is inclined to be a little
  uncharitable."</p>

  <p>Beryl folded her serviette; she looked to be absorbed in the
  operation.</p>

  <p>"He was telling me that Sault is one of the finest mathematicians in the
  country. And he doesn't read or write! Of course he writes figures and
  symbols perfectly. He attends every lecture that he can get to; a remarkable
  personality."</p>

  <p>"Very."</p>

  <p>"I thought you rather liked him?"</p>

  <p>She started from her reverie. "Who...Ambrose?"</p>

  <p>"Ambrose!"</p>

  <p>"That is his name, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"But, my dear," smiled the doctor indulgently, "you wouldn't call him by
  his Christian name! I think he would be rather annoyed to be treated like a
  servant."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't thinking of him as a servant."</p>

  <p>They got up from the table together and she went with him as far as his
  study door. "What have you been doing with yourself...theatres?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, and a ball. An all-night affair. I came home at eight."</p>

  <p>"Humph...bad for you, that sort of thing."</p>

  <p>She was sure it was. It was bad to lie too, but she was beyond caring.
  Ambrose never lied. He would lie for her. Ronnie also would lie&mdash;for
  himself.</p>

  <p>She mused and mused, thinking of Sault...Ambrose Sault. And the red-haired
  invalid. And this sister of hers whom Ambrose had gone to Steppe about...she
  laughed quietly. She would have loved to have seen that contest of giants.
  Could Steppe be brow-beaten? It seemed impossible, and yet Ambrose had cowed
  him.</p>

  <p>She dreamt that night that she saw Ronald and Sault fighting with reaping
  hooks...She woke up with a shiver, for in her dreams their heads had been
  exchanged and Ronnie's face smiled at her from Sault's broad shoulders.</p>

  <p>It was growing light, she found, when she peeped through the curtains. She
  went to bed again but did not sleep any more. It was a coincidence that
  Ronald Morelle was also awake at that hour. His new responsibility was
  weighing on him like a leaden weight. She would never let him go. Her wire
  had terrified him. "There's no end to it!" he said, with a groan. "No
  end!"</p>

  <p>He did not love Beryl; he loved nobody, but there were some girls whom he
  wanted to see again and again. Evie was one of that kind. He did not want to
  see Beryl. He pictured himself chained for life to a woman who was now wholly
  without attraction.</p>

  <p>To this misery, was added a new and unbelievable horror. Steppe called
  just as Ronald was going out to lunch. At any time Steppe was an unwelcome
  visitor. In the state of Ronnie's nerves, he felt it impossible that he could
  support the strain of the big man's company for five minutes. He wished
  Steppe wouldn't barge in without warning. It was not gentlemanly..."I'm
  awfully glad to see you, Mr. Steppe; when did you get back?"</p>

  <p>"Last night...I won't keep you a minute. I'm on my way to make a call on
  that swine Moropulos," he growled. "I want to see you about Beryl." Ronald
  Morelle's heart missed a beat. Had she told? He turned white at the thought.
  Luckily Steppe was striding up and down the room, hands in pockets, bearded
  chin on chest.</p>

  <p>Ronnie's mouth had gone dry and he had a cold sinking feeling inside him.
  "Yes...about Beryl," he managed to say.</p>

  <p>"You're a great friend of hers, huh? Known her for a long time?" Ronnie
  nodded. "You have some influence with her?"</p>

  <p>"I...I hope so...not a great influence."</p>

  <p>"I am going to marry Beryl. The doctor has probably hinted to you that I
  have plans in that quarter, huh?"</p>

  <p>Ronnie swallowed..."No," said, "I didn't know...my congratulations..."</p>

  <p>"Keep 'em," said the other shortly, "they're not wanted yet. You're a
  great friend of hers, huh? Go about with her a great deal? I suppose it is
  all right. I'd pull the life out of you if it wasn't...but Beryl is a good
  girl...What I want you to do is this: give me a good name. If you have any
  influence, use it. Get that?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Morelle found voice to say. "I'll do what I can."</p>

  <p>"That's all right. And, Morelle, when I'm married you won't be asked to
  spend a great deal of time at my house. You'll come when I invite you. That's
  straight, huh? So long."</p>

  <p>Ronald shut the door on him.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap24"
     name="chap24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WHAT a mess! What a perfect hell of a mess he was in! He
  stood by the window, biting his nails. Suppose Beryl told? He wiped his
  forehead. Girls had queer ideas about their duty in that respect. He knew of
  cases. One of those threatening gestures which had come his way was the
  result of such a misguided act of confession on the part of a girl whom he
  had treated very handsomely indeed. A baser case of ingratitude it would be
  difficult to imagine. Beryl might. She had principles. Phew!</p>

  <p>He heard the trill of the telephone in Francois' pantry.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Moropulos," said Francois, emerging from his room.</p>

  <p>Ronnie scowled. "Tell him...no, put him through." He laid down his
  walking-stick and gloves. "Yes, Moropulos; good morning...lunch? Well, I was
  going out to lunch with some people." Moropulos said that his business was
  important. "All right...oh, anywhere...one of those little places in
  Soho."</p>

  <p>He slammed down the instrument viciously. But this was a time to
  consolidate his friends and their interests. Not that Moropulos was a friend,
  but he was useful and might be more so.</p>

  <p>The Greek arrived at the restaurant to the minute and was looking more
  spruce than usual. "Have you seen Steppe?" was his first question.</p>

  <p>"I understand he was on his way to see you...he seemed angry," said
  Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"Our dear Steppe is always angry," answered the Greek coolly, "this time,
  however, he has no cause. If he has gone to my house, he will not see
  me."</p>

  <p>"What is the trouble?"</p>

  <p>Moropulos shrugged. "He has been informed by evil-minded people that
  during his absence I was...well, not to put too fine a point on it, very
  drunk."</p>

  <p>"And were you?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, at the very hour when his spies informed him I was
  dancing on a table in a low part of the East End, and shouting that the
  Mackenzie report was a forgery&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ronnie went pale. "Good God! You never said that?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"Of course not. If I had, it would be a serious thing for me. I, Paul
  Moropulos, tell you, Ronald Morelle, that it would be a disastrous thing for
  me. Just now my relations with dear Jan are&mdash;er&mdash;strained. I do not
  wish a breach."</p>

  <p>"But surely if Steppe's men say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Let them say'," quoted Moropulos, "it is what I say, and you say, and
  somebody else says, that counts, for at the very moment I was supposed to be
  misbehaving,"&mdash;he emphasized his words&mdash;"I was dining with you and
  the lovely Miss Merville in your flat."</p>

  <p>"What! Why, that is a lie!"</p>

  <p>"What is one lie worse than another? Observe I give you the date; it was
  one day before the charming Miss Merville spent the night with you alone in
  your very beautiful flat."</p>

  <p>Had the floor collapsed, Ronald Morelle could not have received a worse
  shock. "I recognise your embarrassment and sympathize with you," said
  Moropulos, "but it is essential for my happiness and ultimate prosperity,
  that both you and Miss Merville should testify that I dined with you on the
  previous night."</p>

  <p>Ronnie had nothing to say. He had not yet realized the tremendous import
  of the man's threat.</p>

  <p>"I will save you a lot of trouble by telling you that I followed you from
  the Pavilion to Knightsbridge. I spent the whole of the night outside,
  wondering when she would come out, and I photographed her as she got into the
  cab. The photograph, an excellent one, is now in a secret place. Steppe, I
  hope, will never see it," he added, looking at his vis-a-vis from under his
  eyelids. "Steppe is angry with me; how unjust! It is impossible that I could
  have been making a fool of myself at the very hour we three together were
  talking of...what were we talking of?...Greece, let us say, the
  academies...Steppe would not believe you, of course, but he would believe
  Miss Merville, and a great unpleasantness would be avoided. I am sorry to
  make this demand of you, but you see how I am situated? I swear to you that I
  had no intention of using my knowledge. It was an amusing little secret of my
  own."</p>

  <p>Ronald found his voice. "Am I to tell...Miss Merville that you know? That
  you have a photograph?"</p>

  <p>Moropulos spread his hands. "Why should she know? It is not
  necessary."</p>

  <p>Ronnie was relieved. It was something to be spared the scene which would
  follow the disclosure that a third person was in their secret. He asked for
  no proofs that Moropulos knew, and any thought of the girl and what this
  meant to her never entered his head. If Steppe knew! He grew cold at the
  thought. Steppe would kill him, pull his life out of him. Ronald Morelle was
  prepared to go a long way to keep his master in ignorance. "I will see Miss
  Merville," he said, and then, feeling that a protest was called for: "You
  have behaved disgracefully, Moropulos...to blackmail me. That is what it
  amounts to!"</p>

  <p>"Not at all. It was a simple matter to tell Steppe that on the night in
  question I was waiting soberly outside your flat, watching his interests. He
  is immensely partial to Beryl Merville. A confusion of dates would not have
  been remarked; he would be so mad that the lesser would be absorbed in the
  greater injury. Me, he would forgive&mdash;you..."</p>

  <p>Ronald shuddered.</p>

  <p>In the afternoon he made his call. "It is lucky finding you alone, dear,"
  he began, awkwardly for him; "you'll never guess what I've been through
  during the past few days..." She was very calm and self-possessed. A shade
  paler, perhaps, but she was of a type that pallor suited. And she met his
  eyes without embarrassment. That made matters more difficult for Ronald. He
  plunged straight away into the object of his visit.</p>

  <p>"Where were you on Tuesday night, Beryl?"</p>

  <p>She was puzzled. "Tuesday?...I forget&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>"Try to think, dear," he urged.</p>

  <p>"I was dining at home. Father was out, I think. I'm not sure. I went to a
  concert after with the Paynters. Yes, that was it&mdash;why?"</p>

  <p>"You were dining with Moropulos and I."</p>

  <p>She stared at him. "I don't understand."</p>

  <p>"Moropulos is in trouble with Steppe. He has been drinking and some of
  Steppe's watchers have reported that he made an ass of himself, gave away
  some business secrets, and that sort of thing. Steppe is naturally furious
  and Moropulos wants to prove an alibi."</p>

  <p>"That he was dining with us; how absurd! Where?"</p>

  <p>"In my flat."</p>

  <p>She surveyed him steadily. He was unusually excited. She had never seen
  Ronnie like that before. Nothing ever ruffled him. "Of course, I can't tell
  such a lie, even to save your friend," she said. "I was dining at home,
  although father has such a wretched memory that he won't be sure whether I
  was here or not."</p>

  <p>"Where did you meet the Paynters; did they call for you?" he asked
  eagerly, and she shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, I met them at Queen's Hall. I was late and they had gone into the
  Hall. But that is beside the point. I am not helping you in this matter."</p>

  <p>"But you must, you must!" He was frenzied. "Moropulos knows...he saw you
  come into the flat...and come out."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence.</p>

  <p>"When...on that night?"</p>

  <p>She walked across the room, her hands clasped behind her. Ronnie had
  expected hysteria...he marvelled at her calm.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said at last. "I dined with you and Moropulos. You had
  better invent another lady. Let us be decent, even in our inventions. And Mr.
  Moropulos entertained us with talk about...what?"</p>

  <p>"Anything"&mdash;nervously; "I know that you think I'm a brute...I can't
  tell you what I think about myself."</p>

  <p>"I can save you the trouble. You think you are in danger, and you are
  hating me because I am the cause."</p>

  <p>"Beryl!"</p>

  <p>She smiled. "Perhaps I am being uncharitable. The complex of this
  situation doesn't allow for very clear thinking. I may take another view next
  week. Will you post this letter for me as you go out?"</p>

  <p>He went down the stairs dumbfounded. Her quietness, the unshaken poise of
  her, staggered him. "Will you post this letter?"!...as if his visit had been
  an ordinary call.</p>

  <p>He glanced at the envelope. It was addressed to a Bond Street milliner,
  and on the back flap was scribbled: 'Send the blue toque also'.</p>

  <p>"H'm," said Ronnie, as he dropped the letter into the post box. He felt in
  some indefinable way that he was being slighted.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap25"
     name="chap25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MRS. COLEBROOK acclaimed it as a miracle and discovered in
  the amazing circumstance the result of her industrious praying. "Every night
  I've said, 'Please God make Christina well, amen'." The osteopath, a short,
  bearded man, who perspired with great freedom, grunted his grudging
  satisfaction. Christina was not well by any means, but for the first time in
  her life she stood upon her own two feet. Only for a few seconds, with Mrs.
  Colebrook supporting her on the one side and the bone doctor on the other,
  but she stood.</p>

  <p>"Yes...not bad after a month's work," said the osteopath. "You must have
  massage for those back muscles; they are like wool. If you don't mind a man
  doing it, you couldn't do better than persuade Mr. Sault. He is an excellent
  masseur...I found this out by accident. The evening he came to engage me, I'd
  been dining out and sprained my ankle getting out of a cab...young lady, I
  observe your suspicion. I am an abstainer and have not touched strong wines
  for twenty years. I came in feeling bad and was not inclined to discuss
  spines with him or anybody. But he insisted on massaging the limb...said he
  had learnt the art in an hospital somewhere...yes, ask him. Otherwise it will
  cost you half a guinea a day."</p>

  <p>Evie heard all this early in the afternoon. It was early-closing day and
  she came home to lunch. She flew up the stairs and literally flung herself
  upon Christina. "You darling!...Isn't it wonderful! Mother says you stood up
  by yourself...Oh, Chris, didn't it feel splendid?"</p>

  <p>"Mother is a romancer," smiled Christina. "I certainly did stand on my
  feet with considerable assistance, and it felt like hell&mdash;pardon the
  language&mdash;physically. Spiritually and intellectually it was a golden
  moment of life. Oh, Evie, I'm gurgling with joy inside, and the prospect of
  Ambrose rubbing my back fills me with bliss."</p>

  <p>"Ambrose...Mr. Sault?" Christina inclined her bead gravely. "But not your
  bare back?"</p>

  <p>"I fear so," said Christina. "I knew this would be a shock to you."</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly, Chris .. it is all right, I suppose," and then with a
  happy laugh, "of course it is all right. I'm wrong. I think I must have an
  unpleasant mind. You've always said I had .. well you've hinted. I'd even let
  him rub my back if it would do you good."</p>

  <p>"You Lady Godiva," murmured Christina admiringly, "quo vadis?"</p>

  <p>"That means where am I going? I always mix it up with that other one, 'the
  sign of the cross'. I am going to a matinee with a girl from the shop. She
  had tickets sent to her by a gentleman who knows the manager. It will be a
  bad play; you can't get tickets for a success. How is your Ambrose? I haven't
  seen him for weeks. Ronnie says that there has been an awful lot of trouble
  at the office..."</p>

  <p>"Oh! Has he an office?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know...some office Ronnie is connected with. He's a director, my
  dear. I saw his name in the paper...Ronnie I mean."</p>

  <p>"Has Ambrose been in trouble?"</p>

  <p>"No, some other man; I forget his name. It is foreign, and he drinks. But
  it has all blown over now."</p>

  <p>Christina sighed. "I don't see how Ambrose came into it, even after your
  lucid explanation."</p>

  <p>"Ambrose, that is to say, Mr. Sault, is supposed to look after...whatever
  his name is. It sounds like the name of a cigarette. He is supposed to stop
  him drinking. And he found this...Moropulos, that's the name, in a bar and
  hauled him out, and Moropulos fought him...I don't know the whole story, but
  I do know that there was a row."</p>

  <p>"Is the cigarette person still able to walk about?" asked Christina
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but they are very bad friends. Moropulos says he'll get even with
  Sault."</p>

  <p>"Unhappy man," said Christina, "Ronnie is getting quite communicative,
  isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"We're real friends," answered the girl enthusiastically, "we're just
  pals! I sometimes feel...I don't know whether I ought to tell you this. But I
  will. I sometimes feel that I really don't want to marry Ronnie at all. I
  feel that I could be perfectly happy, married to somebody else, if I had him
  for a friend. Isn't that queer?"</p>

  <p>Christina thought it was queer and wondered if this attitude of mind was
  Evie's very own or whether it had grown by suggestion. But she had evidently
  done Ronnie an injustice in this instance.</p>

  <p>"I've never told Ronnie this," said Evie. "I don't fancy that he would
  understand, but I did ask him whether he thought that he could be friends
  with Beryl Merville if she married somebody else. I only asked him for fun,
  just to hear what he would say. My dear, how he loathes that girl! I could
  tell he was sincere. He was so furious! He said that if she married he would
  never visit her house, and he wished he had never seen her."</p>

  <p>Christina made no response. It was on the tip of her tongue to say that
  Beryl Merville must know the man very well to have excited such hatred, but
  she observed the truce.</p>

  <p>When Ambrose put in an appearance late in the evening she learnt that he
  had heard from the osteopath. His large smile told her that even before he
  spoke. "Now, Ambrose, did he say anything about massage?"</p>

  <p>Ambrose nodded. "I'll do it if you let me," he said simply, "my hands
  aren't as awkward as they look."</p>

  <p>Later her mother, who had been an interested spectator of the treatment,
  spoke a great truth. "It seems natural for Mr. Sault to be rubbing your back,
  Christina. He's just like a...a soul with hands...sounds ridiculous I know,
  but that is what I felt. He wasn't a man and he wasn't a woman. It seemed
  natural somehow...how did you feel about it?"</p>

  <p>"Mother, I begin to believe that I got my genius from you," said
  Christina, patting a rumpled sheet into place. "I couldn't have bettered
  that; 'a soul with hands'!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook blinked complacently. "I've always been a bit clever in
  describing people," she said. "Do you remember how I used to call Evie
  'spitfire'?"</p>

  <p>"Don't spoil my illusions, mother&mdash;'a soul with hands' entitles you
  to my everlasting respect. And don't tell Evie, or she'll talk about his
  feet. He has big feet, I admit, though he makes less noise than Evie. And he
  snores, I heard him last night."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap26"
     name="chap26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE came a day when Christina put her feet to the grimy
  pavement of the street and walked slowly, but without assistance, to Dr.
  Merville's car, borrowed through Beryl for the afternoon. It was a cold,
  clear day in January, the wind was in the east and the gutters of Walter
  Street were covered with a thin film of ice. A momentous occasion, for in
  addition to other wonders, Christina was wearing her first hat! Evie had
  chosen and bought it. The woollen costume was one from Mrs. Colebrook's wash
  tub. Ambrose had provided a grey squirrel coat. It had appeared at the last
  moment. But the hat was a joy. Christina had worn it in bed all the morning,
  sitting up with pillows behind her and a mirror in her hand. "Lend me that
  powder-puff of yours, Evie," she said recklessly, "my skin is perfect...I
  admit it. But I can't appear before the curious eyes of the world wearing my
  own complexion. It wouldn't be decent."</p>

  <p>"If you take my advice," suggested the wise Evie, "you'll put a dab of
  rouge on your cheeks. Nobody will know."</p>

  <p>"I am no painted woman," said Christina, "I am poor, but I am respectable.
  Ambrose would think I had a fever and send for the osteopath. No, a little
  powder. My eyes are sufficiently languorous without eye-black, I think. It
  must be powder or nothing."</p>

  <p>Ambrose did not accompany them, and Evie and Mrs. Colebrook were her
  attendants in the drive to Hampstead.</p>

  <p>Beryl saw them; she had arranged with Ambrose and the chauffeur that the
  car should go past the house, and she watched from behind a curtained window.
  So that was Evie; it was the first time she had seen her...no, not the first
  time. She was the girl to whom Ronnie had been speaking that holiday morning
  when she had passed them in the park. She was very pretty and petite. The
  kind Ronnie liked. She lingered at the window long after they had passed,
  loath to face an unpleasant interview.</p>

  <p>She knew it would be unpleasant: her father had been so anxious to please
  her at lunch; his nervousness was symptomatic. He wanted to have a little
  talk with her that afternoon, he said; she guessed the subject set for
  discussion.</p>

  <p>Sitting before the drawing-room fire, she was reading when he came in,
  rubbing his hands and wearing a cheerful smile which was wholly
  simulated.</p>

  <p>"Ah, there you are, Beryl. Now we can have a chat. I get very little time
  nowadays."</p>

  <p>He poked the fire vigorously and sat down.</p>

  <p>"Beryl..." he seemed at some loss for an opening, "I had a talk with
  Steppe the other day...we were talking about you."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Steppe is very fond of you...loves you." Dr. Merville cleared his throat.
  "Yes, he loves you, Beryl. A fine man, a little rough, perhaps, but a fine
  man and a very rich man."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" said Beryl again, and he grew more agitated.</p>

  <p>"I don't know why you say 'Yes, yes'," he said irritably, "a young girl
  doesn't as a rule hear such things without displaying some...well, some
  emotion. How do you feel about the matter?"</p>

  <p>"About marrying Mr. Steppe? I suppose you mean that? I can't marry him: I
  don't wish to."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure you would learn to love him, Beryl."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Impossible. I'm sorry, father, especially if you wish me to marry him.
  But it is impossible."</p>

  <p>The doctor stared gloomily into the fire.</p>

  <p>"You must do as you wish. I cannot conscientiously urge you to make any
  sacrifice...he is a rough man and I'm afraid he will take your refusal badly.
  I don't mind what he does...really. I've made a hash of things...it was
  madness ever to invest a penny, I had a hundred and fifty thousand when I
  came into this house. And now...!"</p>

  <p>She listened with a cold feeling in her heart.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean...that you depend upon the goodwill of Mr. Steppe...that if
  you were to break your connection with him and his companies your position
  would be affected?..."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that is how matters stand," he said, "But I forbid you to
  take that into consideration."</p>

  <p>Yet he looked at her so eagerly, so wistfully, that she knew his lofty
  statements to be so many words by which he expressed principles long since
  dead. The form of his vanished code showed dimly through the emptiness his
  speech.</p>

  <p>"I am a modern father...I believe that a girl's hand should go where it
  will. Girls do not marry men to please their families, except in melodrama,
  and fathers do not ask such a ghastly sacrifice. I should have been glad if
  you had thought kindly of Steppe. It would have made my course much more
  smooth. However..."</p>

  <p>He got up, stooped to poke the fire again, hung the poker timidly on the
  iron and straightened himself.</p>

  <p>"Let me think it over," she said, not looking at him.</p>

  <p>Not until he was out of the room did he feel comfortable.</p>

  <p>She had been prepared for this development. Steppe had been a constant
  visitor to the house and his rare flowers filled the vases of every room
  except hers. And her father had hinted and hinted. That Dr. Merville was
  heavily in the debt of her suitor she could guess. Steppe had told her months
  before that he had come to the rescue of the doctor. Only she had hoped that
  so crude an alternative would not be placed before her, though she knew that
  such arrangements were not altogether confined to the realms of melodrama. At
  least two friends of hers had married for a similar reason. A knightly
  millionaire boot maker had married Lady Sylvia Frascommon, and had settled
  the Earl of Farileigh's bills at a moment when that noble earl was dodging
  writs in bankruptcy. She could look at the matter more calmly because she had
  come to a dead end. There was nothing ahead, nothing. She did not count
  Ambrose Sault's love amongst the tangibilities of life. That belonged to
  herself. Steppe would marry that possession. It was as much of her, as hands
  and lips, except that it was beyond his enjoyment.</p>

  <p>In the midst of her examination, her father came in. "There is one thing I
  forgot to say, dear...Ronnie, who is as fond of you as any of us, thinks that
  you ought to marry...he says that he'll be glad to see you married to
  Steppe...I thought it was fine of Ronnie."</p>

  <p>"Shut the door, father, please; there's a draught," said Beryl.</p>

  <p>Dr. Merville returned to his study shaking his head. He couldn't
  understand Beryl.</p>

  <p>So Ronnie approved! She sat, cheek in hand, elbow on knee, looking at the
  fire. Steppe did not seem so impossible after that. Ronnie! He would approve
  of course. What terrors he must have endured when he discovered that Steppe
  was his rival! What mental agonies! An idea came to her.</p>

  <p>She went down to the hall where the telephone was and gave his number.</p>

  <p>"Hello...yes."</p>

  <p>"Is that you, Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes...is that you, Beryl?" His voice changed. She detected an anxious
  note. "How are you?...I meant to come round yesterday. I haven't seen you for
  an age."</p>

  <p>"Father says that you think I ought to marry Steppe."</p>

  <p>There was an interval.</p>

  <p>"Did you hear what I said?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes...of course it is heartbreaking for me...I feel terrible about it
  all...but it is a good match, Beryl. He is one of the richest men in town...
  it is for your good, dear."</p>

  <p>She nodded to the transmitter and her lips twitched.</p>

  <p>"I can't marry him without telling him, can I, Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>She heard his gasp. "For God's sake don't be so mad, Beryl! You're mad!
  What good would it do...it would break your father's heart...you don't want
  to do that, do you? It would be selfish and nothing good could come of
  it..."</p>

  <p>She was smiling delightedly at her end of the wire, but this he could not
  know.</p>

  <p>"I will think about it," she said.</p>

  <p>"Beryl...Beryl...don't go away. You mustn't, you really mustn't...I'm not
  thinking about myself...it is you...your father. You won't do such a crazy
  thing, will you? Promise me you won't...I am entitled to some
  consideration."</p>

  <p>"I'll think about it," she repeated, and left him in a state of
  collapse.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap27"
     name="chap27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT happened sometimes that Mr. Moropulos had extraordinary
  callers at his bleak house in Paddington. They came furtively after dark, and
  were careful to note whether or not they were followed. Since few of these
  made appointments and were unexpected, it was essential that the Greek should
  be indoors up to ten o'clock. Therefore he failed in his trust when his
  unquenchable thirst drew him away from business. He was maintained in comfort
  by Jan Steppe to receive these shy callers. Mr. Moropulos was not, as might
  be supposed, engaged in a career of crime as we understand crime. The people
  who came and whom he interviewed briefly in his sitting room were respectable
  persons who followed various occupations in the city, and would have swooned
  at the thought of stealing a watch or robbing a safe. But it was known in and
  about Threadneedle Street, Old Broad Street, and in various quaint alleyways
  and passages where bareheaded clerks abound, that information worth money
  could be sold for money. A chance-heard remark, the fag-end of a conversation
  in a board-room, heard between the opening and closing of a door; a peep at a
  letter, any of these scraps of gossip could be turned into solid cash by the
  bearded Greek.</p>

  <p>It was surprising how quickly his address passed round, and even more
  surprising how very quickly Moropulos had organized an intelligent service
  which was unique as it was pernicious. He paid well, or rather Steppe did,
  and the returns were handsome. A clerk desiring to participate in a rise of
  value which he knew was coming, could buy a hundred shares through Moropulos,
  and that without the expenditure of a cent. Moropulos knew the secrets of a
  hundred offices; there were few business amalgamations that he did not know
  about weeks in advance.</p>

  <p>When the Westfontein Gold Mines published a sensational report concerning
  their properties, a report which brought their stock from eight to nothing,
  few people knew that Moropulos had had the essential part of the report in
  his pocket the day after it arrived in London. It cost Steppe three thousand
  pounds, but was worth every penny. The amount of the sum paid was
  exaggerated, but it was also spread abroad. And in consequence, Mr. Moropulos
  was a very busy man.</p>

  <p>He was in his sitting-room on that shivering winter night. A great fire
  roared in the chimney, a shaded lamp was so placed that it fell upon the
  book, and the occupant of the sofa could read in comfort. On a small eastern
  table was a large tumbler full of barley-water. From time to time Mr.
  Moropulos sipped wryly.</p>

  <p>It was nearing ten and he was debating within himself whether he should go
  to bed or test his will by a visit to a cafe where he knew some friends of
  his would be, when he heard the street door slam and looked over his
  shoulder. It could only be Sault or...</p>

  <p>The door opened and Jan Steppe came in, dusting the snow from the sleeve
  of his coat. It was a handsome coat, deeply collared in astrakhan, and its
  lining was sealskin, as Mr. Moropulos dill not fail to observe.</p>

  <p>"Alone, huh?" said Steppe. He glanced at the barley-water by the Greek's
  side and grinned sardonically. "That's the stuff, not a headache in a
  bucketful!"</p>

  <p>"Nor a cheerful thought," said Moropulos. "What brings you this way,
  Steppe?"</p>

  <p>"I want to put something in the safe." Sault's invention stood on a wooden
  frame behind a screen. "Have to be careful about this word...give me some
  more light," said Steppe, at the dial. Moropulos rose wearily and turned a
  switch. "That's better...huh. Got it!" The door swung open, and taking a
  small package from his pocket, the big man tossed it in. "Got something here,
  huh?" He pulled out an envelope. There was a wax seal on the back. "'The
  photograph'?" he read, and frowned at the other.</p>

  <p>"It is mine," said Moropulos. "Nothing to do with the business?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing." Steppe threw it back and turned the dial. "Nothing new, huh?"
  He glanced at the barley-water again. "Where's Sault?"</p>

  <p>"He goes home early. I don't see him again unless one of your hounds sends
  for him..."</p>

  <p>Steppe's smile was half sneer. "You don't like Sault...a good fellow,
  huh?"</p>

  <p>Moropulos wrinkled his nose like an angry dog. His beard seemed to stiffen
  and his eyes blazed. "Like him...he's not human, that fellow! Nothing moves
  him, nothing. I tried to smash him up with a bottle, but he took it away from
  me as if I were a child. I hate a man who makes me feel like that...if he
  hadn't got my gun away I'd have laid him out. It would be fine to hurt the
  devil...and he is a devil, Steppe. Inhuman. Sometimes I give him a newspaper
  to read&mdash;just for the fun of it. But it never worries him."</p>

  <p>"Don't try. He's a bigger man than you. You want to rouse him, huh? The
  day you do, God help you! I don't think you will. That's how I feel about
  him. He's cold. Chilly as a Druid's hell. He is dangerous when he's quiet...
  and he's always quiet."</p>

  <p>"He is no use to me. It is a waste of money keeping him. I'll give you no
  more trouble."</p>

  <p>Steppe pursed his lips until his curling black moustache bristled like the
  end of a brush. It was a grimace indicative of his scepticism. He had reason.
  "Leave it. Sault will not give you any bother. I don't want strangers here,
  huh? Cleaners who are spying detectives."</p>

  <p>Moropulos took his book again as his employer went out. But he did not
  read. His eyes looked beyond the edge of the page, his mind was busy.
  Detestation of Ambrose Sault was not assumed, as he had simulated so many
  likes and dislikes. Sault's maddening imperturbability, his immense
  superiority to the petty annoyances with which his daily companion fed him,
  his contempt for the Greek's vulgarity, these things combined to the fire of
  the man's hatred. They were incompatibles&mdash;it was impossible to imagine
  any two men more unlike. Moropulos was one whose speech was habitually
  coarse; his pleasures coarse and elemental. He delighted to talk of his
  conquests, cheap enough though they were. It pleased him, beyond normal
  understanding, to bring Beryl Merville into the category of easy women. He
  had never doubted that she was bad. There were no other kind of women to
  Moropulos. Suspecting, before there were grounds for suspicion, he had
  watched and justified his construction of the girl's friendship with Ronnie
  Morelle. He was certain when he watched her come out of the Knightsbridge
  flat that if he had been fortunate he would have seen her there before,
  perhaps the previous night.</p>

  <p>Beryl was no less in his eyes than she had been. She was bad. All women
  were bad, only some were more particular than others in choosing their
  partners in sin.</p>

  <p>He had reason to meet Ronald Morelle the next morning, and returning he
  brought news. Ambrose was clearing the snow from the steps and path before
  the house when he arrived. "Come in." He was bubbling over with excitement.
  "I've got a piece of interesting information."</p>

  <p>Ambrose in his deliberate fashion put away broom and spade before he
  joined the other.</p>

  <p>"You know Beryl Merville, don't you? Steppe is marrying her." He had no
  other idea than to pass on the news, and create something of the sensation
  which its recital had caused him. But his keen eyes did not miss the quick
  lift of Sault's head or the change that came to his face. Only for the
  fraction of a second, and then his mask descended again.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it, Sault? Some girl, eh?"</p>

  <p>He added one of own peculiar comments.</p>

  <p>"Who told you?"</p>

  <p>"Ronald Morelle. I don't suppose he minds now. Lucky devil, Steppe. God!
  If I had his money!"</p>

  <p>Ambrose walked slowly away, but his enemy had found the chink in his
  armour, he was certain of it. It was incredible that a man like Ambrose Sault
  would feel that way, but he would swear that Ambrose was hurt. Here he he was
  wrong. Ambrose was profoundly moved; but he was not hurt.</p>

  <p>That day Moropulos said little. It was on the second and third days that
  he went to work with an ingenuity that was devilish, to break farther into
  the crevice he had found.</p>

  <p>Ambrose made little or no response. The sliest, most outrageous innuendo
  he passed as though it had not been spoken. Moropulos was piqued and angry.
  He dare not go further for fear Sault complained to Steppe. That alone held
  him within bounds. But the man was suffering. Instinctively he knew that.
  Suffering in a dumb, hopeless way that found no expression.</p>

  <p>On the Friday night. Ambrose returned to his lodging looking very tired.
  Christina was shocked at his appearance.</p>

  <p>"Ambrose...what is the matter?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Christina...yes, I know. Moropulos has been trying, very
  trying. I find it much more difficult to hold myself in, I suppose I'm
  getting old and my will-power is weakening."</p>

  <p>She stroked the hand that lay on the arm on the chair (for she was sitting
  up) and looked at him gravely.</p>

  <p>"Ambrose, I feel that you have given me some of your<br>
  strength. Do you remember how you gave it to mother?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head,</p>

  <p>"No, not you...I purposely didn't. I've a loving heart for you, Christina.
  I shall carry you with me beyond life."</p>

  <p>"Why do you say that tonight?" she asked, with an odd little pain at her
  heart.</p>

  <p>"I don't know. Steppe wants me to go down with Moropulos to his place in
  the country. Moropulos has asked me before, but this time Steppe has asked
  me. I don't know..."</p>

  <p>He shook his head wearily. She had never seen him so depressed. It was as
  if the spirit of life had suddenly burnt out. "I hope you will be as you say,
  Ambrose, but, my dear, you are overtired; we oughtn't to discuss souls and
  eternities and stuff like that. It is sleep you want, Ambrose."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sleepy." He bent over her, his big hand on her head. "I am glad
  you are well," he said. She heard him go downstairs and out of the house,
  late as it was.</p>

  <p>A few minutes afterwards Evie came in. "Where is Sault going?" she asked.
  "I saw him stalking up the street as though it belonged to him. And oh,
  Chris, what do you think Ronnie says? Mr. Steppe is marrying that girl that
  came here...Beryl Merville!"</p>

  <p>"Fine," said Christina absently. She knew now, and her heart was bursting
  with sorrow for the man who had gone out into the night.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap28"
     name="chap28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"THE PANTHEON" occupied an acre of land that had once been
  part of a monastery garden. Until Mr. Moropulos with his passion for Hellenic
  nomenclature had so named it, the old cottage and its land were known by the
  curious title: "Brother-god Farm', or as it appeared in ancient deeds, 'The
  Farmstead of Brother-of-God'. For Mr. Moropulos there was peculiar pleasure
  in setting up in the monastery land such symbols of the monotheistic religion
  of ancient Greece as he could procure.</p>

  <p>The house itself consisted of one large kitchen-hall on the ground floor,
  and two bedrooms above. A more modern kitchen had been built on to the main
  walls by a former tenant. The cottage was well-furnished, and, unlike his
  home in Paddington, the floors were carpeted&mdash;a piece of needless
  extravagance from the Greek's point of view, but one which he had not
  determined, for he had bought the cottage and the furniture together, the
  owner being disinclined to sell the one without the other. The garden was the
  glory of the place in the summer. It had a charm even on the chill afternoon
  that Ambrose deposited his bag at the white gate. A wintry sun was setting
  redly, turning to the colour of wine the white face of the fields. In the
  hollows of the little valley beyond the cottage, the mists were lying in
  smoky pools. His hands on the top of the gate, he gazed rapturously at such a
  sunset as England seldom sees. Turquoise...claret...a blue that was almost
  green...Drawing a long breath he picked up his bag and walked into the
  house.</p>

  <p>"Go down and look after Moropulos. He is weakening on that barley-water
  diet...he told me himself." Thus Steppe. His servitor obeyed without
  question, he knew that the shadow of death was upon him. Moropulos was
  stretched in a deep mission-chair, his slippered feet toward the hearth. And
  he had begun his libations early. On the floor within reach of his hand was a
  tumbler, full of milky-white fluid. There was a sugar-basin...a glass jug
  half filled with water, and a tea strainer. Ambrose need not look for the
  absinthe bottle. The accessories told the story.</p>

  <p>"Come in...shut the door, you big fool...no you don't!" Moropulos snatched
  up the tumbler from the floor and gulped down its contents. "Ha&mdash;a! That
  is good, my dear...good! Sit down!" He pointed imperiously to a chair.</p>

  <p>"You'll have no more of that stuff to-night, Moropulos." Ambrose gathered
  up the bottle and took it into the kitchen. The Greek chuckled as he heard it
  smash. He had a store...a little locker in the tool shed; a few bottles in
  his bedroom.</p>

  <p>"Come back!" he roared. "Come, you big pig! Come and talk about Beryl. Ah!
  What a girl. What a face for that hairy gorilla to kiss!" Sault heard, but
  went on filling a kettle, and presently the shouts subsided. "When I call
  you, come!" commanded Moropulos sulkily, as Ambrose returned with a steaming
  cup of tea in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Drink this," said Ambrose. Moropulos took the cup and saucer and flung
  them and their contents into the fireplace. "For children, for young ladies,
  but not for a son of the south...an immortal, Sault! For young ladies, yes ..
  for Beryl the beautiful." A hand gripped him by the beard and jerked his head
  up. The pain was exquisite&mdash;his neck was stretched, a thousand hot
  needles tortured his chin and cheek where the beard dragged. For the space of
  a second he looked into the grey eyes, fathomless. Then Ambrose broke his
  grip and the man staggered to his feet mouthing, grimacing, but silent. Nor
  did Ambrose speak. His eyes had spoken, and the half-drunken man dropped back
  into his chair, cowering. When Sault returned to the room after unpacking his
  bag. Moropulos was still sitting in the same position. "Do you want anything
  cooked for your dinner?"</p>

  <p>"There is...fish...and chops...you'll find them in the kitchen." He sat,
  breathing quickly, listening to the sizzle and splutter of frying meat.
  Ambrose Sault shut the door that led into the kitchen, and the Greek stood
  up, listening. From beneath a locker he produced a bottle, quietly he took up
  the water-jug and sugar and stole softly up to his room. He locked the door
  quietly, put down his impedimenta and opened a drawer of an old davenport.
  Underneath an assortment of handkerchiefs and underwear, he found an ivory-
  handled revolver, a slender-barrelled, plated thing, that glittered in his
  hand. It was loaded; he made sure of that. His hatred of Ambrose Sault was an
  insensate obsession. He had pulled him by the beard, an intolerable insult in
  any circumstances. But Sault was a nigger...he sat down on the only chair in
  the room and prepared a drink...</p>

  <p>"Are you coming down? I've laid the table, and the food is ready," Ambrose
  called from the bottom of the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell!"</p>

  <p>"Come along, Moropulos. What is the sense of this? I am sorry I touched
  you."</p>

  <p>"You'll be more sorry," screamed the Greek. His voice sounded deafening,
  near, for he had opened the door. You dog, you..." Mr. Moropulos had a wider
  range of expletives than most men. Ambrose listened without listening.
  Pulling out a chair from the table, he sat down and began his dinner. He
  heard the feet of the drunkard pacing the floor above, heard the rumble of
  his voice, and then the upper door was flung violently open and the feet of
  Moropulos clattered down the stairs. He had taken off his coat and his
  waistcoat. His beard flowed over a coloured silk shirt, beautifully
  embroidered. But it was the thing in his hand that Ambrose saw, and seeing,
  rose.</p>

  <p>The man's face was while with rage; an artery in his neck was pulsating
  visibly. "You pulled my beard...you ignorant...negro...you nigger thing...
  you damned convict! You're going on your knees to lick my boots...my boots,
  not Beryl's, you old fool!..."</p>

  <p>Ambrose did not move from the position he had taken on the other side of
  the table.</p>

  <p>"Down, down, down!" shrieked Moropulos, his pistol waving wildly. Ambrose
  Sault obeyed, but not as Moropulos had expected. Suddenly he dropped out of
  view behind the edge of the white cloth and in the same motion he launched
  himself under the table, toward the man. In a second he had gripped him by
  the ankles and thrown him...the pistol dropped almost into his hands.</p>

  <p>Moropulos stumbled to his feet and glared round at his assailant. "I hope
  to God you love that woman; I hope to God you love her...you do, you old
  fool! You love her...Ronald Morelle's mistress! I know! She stayed a night at
  his flat...other nights, too...but I saw her as she came out...I photographed
  her!"</p>

  <p>"You photographed her as she came out?" repeated Ambrose dully.</p>

  <p>A grin of glee parted the bearded lips. "I've hurt you, damn you! I've
  hurt you! And I'm going to tell Steppe, and tell her father, and
  everybody!"</p>

  <p>"You liar." Sault's voice was gentle. "You filthy man. You saw
  nothing."</p>

  <p>"I didn't, eh? Oh, I didn't! Morelle admitted it...admitted it to me. And
  I've got the photograph in a safe place, with a full account of what
  happened!"</p>

  <p>"In the safe!" Moropulos had made a mistake, a fatal mistake, he realized
  it even as he had spoken. "And you...and Morelle...have her in your cruel
  hands!" So softly did he speak that it seemed to the man that it was a
  whisper he heard. Sault held in his hands the pistol. He looked at it
  thoughtfully. "You must not hurt her," he said.</p>

  <p>Moropulos stood paralysed for a moment, then made a dart for the door. His
  hand was on the latch when Ambrose Sault shot him dead.</p>

  <h2><a id="book3"
     name="book3">BOOK THE THIRD</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap29"
     name="chap29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AMBROSE looked a very long time at the inert heap by the
  door. He seemed to be settling some difficulty which had arisen in his mind,
  for the gloom passed from his face, and, pocketing the revolver slowly, he
  walked across to where Paul Moropulos lay. He was quite dead.</p>

  <p>"I am glad," said Ambrose. Lifting the body, he laid it in the chair; then
  he took out the pistol again and examined it. There were five live
  cartridges. He only needed one. In the kitchen he put on the heavy overcoat
  he had been wearing when he arrived. Returning, he lit the candle of a
  lantern and went out into the back of the house where Moropulos had erected a
  small army hut to serve as his garage. He broke the lock and wheeled out the
  little car. Ambrose Sault was in no hurry; his every movement was deliberate.
  He tested the tank, filled it, put water in the radiator, then started the
  engines and drove the car through the stable gates on to the main road,
  before, leaving the engines running, he paid another visit to the house and
  blew out the lamp. As he reached the dark road again he saw a man standing by
  the car. It proved to be a villager.</p>

  <p>"Somebody heard a shot going up this way. I told 'un it was only Mr.
  Moropuly's old car back-firing."</p>

  <p>"It was not that," said Ambrose, as he stepped into the car. "Good night."
  He drove carefully, because his life was very precious this night. He thought
  of Christina several times, but without self-pity. Christina would get
  well...and her love would endure. It was of the quality which did not need
  the flesh of him. Ronald Morelle must die. There was no other solution. He
  must die, not because he had led the woman to his way; that was a smaller
  matter than any, and honestly meant nothing to Ambrose. Ronald's offence was
  his knowledge. He knew: he had told. He would tell again.</p>

  <p>A policeman stopped him as he drove through Woking. He was asked to
  produce a license, and when none was forthcoming, his name and address were
  taken. Ambrose gave both truthfully. It was a lucky chance for the policeman.
  Afterwards he gave evidence and became important: was promoted sergeant on
  the very day that Steppe sneered at a weeping man. That was seven weeks
  later...in March, when the primroses were showing in Brother-of-God Farm.</p>

  <p>Ambrose knew Ronald's flat. He had gone there once with Moropulos, and he
  had waited outside the door whilst Moropulos was interviewing Ronnie. Nine
  o'clock was striking as the car drew up before the flat...Ronnie heard it
  through the closed casement. Nine o'clock? He dropped his pen and leant back
  in his chair. What was the cause of that cold trickling sensation? His mouth
  went dry. He used to feel like that in air raids. A bell rung. "Francois..."
  Louder&mdash;"Francois!"</p>

  <p>"Pardon, m'sieur." Francois came out of his pantry half awake.</p>

  <p>"The door." Who was it? thought Ronnie...he jumped up.</p>

  <p>"What do you want, Sault?"</p>

  <p>Ambrose looked round at the waiting servant.</p>

  <p>"You," he said. "I want to know the truth...first that man should go."</p>

  <p>Ronnie flushed angrily. "I certainly cannot allow you to decide whether my
  servant goes or remains. Have you come from Mr. Steppe?" Ambrose hesitated.
  Perhaps it was a confidential message from Steppe, thought Ronnie. This
  uncouth fellow often served as a messenger. "Wait outside the door,
  Francois&mdash;no, outside the lobby door."</p>

  <p>"I haven't come from Steppe."</p>

  <p>Suddenly Ronnie remembered. "Steppe said you had gone to the country with
  Moropulos&mdash;where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Dead."</p>

  <p>Ronnie staggered back, his pale face working. He had a horror of death.
  "Dead?" he said hollowly, and Sault nodded.</p>

  <p>"I killed him."</p>

  <p>A gasp. "God!...Why?"</p>

  <p>"He knew...he said you had told him. He knew because he was outside your
  flat all night and photographed her as she went out."</p>

  <p>The blood of the listener froze with horror. "I&mdash;I don't know what
  you're talking about...who is the 'she'?"</p>

  <p>"Beryl Merville."</p>

  <p>"It is a lie...absurd...Miss Merville!...Here?" He found his breath
  insufficient for his speech. Something inside him was paralysed: his words
  were disjointed.</p>

  <p>"It is true...she was here. She told me."</p>

  <p>"You...you're mad! Told you! It is a damned lie! She was never here. If
  Moropulos said that, I'm glad you've killed him!"</p>

  <p>"He took a photograph and wrote a statement; you know about that because
  he spoke to you and you admitted it all."</p>

  <p>"I swear before God that Moropulos has never spoken to me. I would have
  killed him if he had. The story of the photograph is a lie...he invented it.
  That was his way&mdash;where is this picture?"</p>

  <p>Ambrose did not answer. Was this man speaking the truth? His version was
  at least plausible. He must go at once to the house in Paddington and get the
  envelope...it must be destroyed. How would he know if Ronnie was speaking the
  truth?</p>

  <p>Ronald Morelle, his teeth biting into his lip, saw judgement wavering. He
  was fighting for his life; he knew that Sault had come to kill him and his
  soul quivered. "Where is that picture?...I tell you it is an invention of
  that swine. He guessed...Even to you I will not admit that there is a word of
  truth in the story."</p>

  <p>He had won. The hand that was thrust into the overcoat pocket returned
  empty.</p>

  <p>"I will come back," said Sault.</p>

  <p>When he reached the street he saw a man looking at the number-plate of his
  car. He took no notice, but drove off. He had to break a window to get into
  the house at Paddington. He had forgotten to bring his keys. That delayed his
  entrance for some while. He was in the room, and his fingers on the dial of
  the combination, when three men walked through the door. He knew who they
  were.</p>

  <p>"I have a revolver in my pocket, gentlemen," he said. "I have killed Paul
  Moropulos, the owner of this house."</p>

  <p>They snapped handcuffs upon his wrists. "Do you know the combination of
  this safe, Sault?" asked the tall inspector in charge. He had been reading a
  typewritten notice affixed to the top.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Ambrose Sault.</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"I am not at liberty to say."</p>

  <p>"What is in it...money?" No answer. The officer beckoned forward one of
  the uniformed men who seemed to fill the hall. "This safe is not to be
  touched, you understand? By anybody. If you allow the handle to be turned
  there will be trouble. Come along. Sault."</p>

  <p>The handcuffs were unnecessary. They were also inadequate. In the darkness
  of the car: "I am very sorry, inspector...I have broken these things...I was
  feeling for a handkerchief and forgot." They did not believe him, but at the
  police station they found that be had spoken the truth. The bar of the cuff
  had been wrenched open, the steel catch of the lock torn away. "I did it
  absent-mindedly," said Ambrose, shame-faced. They put him into a cell where
  he went instantly to sleep.</p>

  <p>The handcuffs became a famous exhibit which generations of young policemen
  will look upon with awe and wonder.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap30"
     name="chap30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SUNDAY morning, and the bells of the churches calling to
  worship. Fog, thin and yellow, covered the streets. All the lamps in Jan
  Steppe's study were blazing, he had the African's hatred of dim lights and
  there was usually one lamp burning in the room he might be using, unless the
  sun shone. He paced up and down the carpet, his hands thrust deep into his
  pockets, his mind busy. He was too well equipped a man to see danger in any
  other direction than where it lay. In moments of peril, he was ice. He could
  not be cajoled or stampeded into facing imaginary troubles, nor yet to turn
  his back upon the real threat. All his life he had been a fighter and had
  grown rich from his victories. Struggle was a normal condition of existence.
  Nothing had come to him that he had not planned and worked for, or to gain
  which he had not taken considerable risks.</p>

  <p>The risks now were confined to Ambrose Sault and his fidelity to the trust
  which had been forced upon him by circumstances. He was satisfied that
  Ambrose would not speak. If he did...Steppe chewed on an unlighted cigar. The
  removal of Moropulos meant an inconvenience; Sault scarcely counted. The
  Greek was a nuisance and a danger, whilst his extravagance and folly had
  brought his associates to the verge of ruin. When the police arrested Ambrose
  Sault they took possession of the house in which he had been found. Amongst
  other things seized was the safe upon which Moropulos had pasted a
  typewritten notice in his whimsical language:</p><br>

  <p class="sign">TO BURGLARS<br>
  AND ALL WHOM IT MAY CONCERN<br>
  CAUTION<br>
  Any attempt to open this safe,<br>
  except by the employment of the correct codeword,<br>
  will result in the destruction of the safe's contents.<br>
  DON'T TURN THE HANDLE</p><br>

  <p>Steppe had seen the notice but had not read it. If it had not been
  affixed! One turn of the handle and every paper would have been reduced to a
  black pulp. He tried to remember what was stored in the cursed thing. There
  were drafts, memoranda, letters from illicit agents, a record of certain
  transactions which would not look well...the Mackenzie Report! Later he
  remembered the photograph in the sealed envelope. Why had Sault gone to the
  safe? The report he had had from the police&mdash;they had been with him for
  the best part of the morning&mdash;was to the effect that Sault had been
  arrested at the moment he was swinging the dials. What was Sault after? He
  could not read: only documents were in the safe.</p>

  <p>A footman appeared. "Who?...Morelle...show him in."</p>

  <p>Ronnie was looking wan and tired. He had not recovered from his fright.
  "Well? I got your 'phone call. Don't 'phone me, d'ye hear...never! You get
  people listening-in at any time; just now the exchanges will be stiff with
  detectives. What were you trying to tell me when I shut you up?"</p>

  <p>"About Sault...he came to me last night."</p>

  <p>"Huh! Fine thing to talk about on the 'phone! Did you tell the
  police?"</p>

  <p>"No, and I've ordered Francois to say nothing. After Sault went, I sent
  Francois to...to Moropulos' house. I knew Sault was going there."</p>

  <p>"How did you know? And why did he come to you, anyway?"</p>

  <p>The answer Ronnie had decided upon after much cogitation. "Oh...a rambling
  statement about Moropulos. I couldn't make head or tail of it. He said he was
  going to the house; I was afraid there would be trouble, so I sent
  Francois."</p>

  <p>"You knew Moropulos was in Hampshire&mdash;I told you they were both
  there."</p>

  <p>"I'd forgotten that. I don't want to come into this, Steppe&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What you want matters as much to me as what your Francois wants. If Sault
  says he came to your flat...but he won't. He'll say nothing...nothing." He
  looked keenly at the other. "That was all he said, huh? Just a rambling
  statement? Not like Sault that, he never rambles. Did he tell you that he'd
  killed Moropulos?" Ronnie hesitated. "He did! Try to speak the truth, will
  you? So he told you he had killed the Greco?"</p>

  <p>"I didn't take him seriously. I thought he must be joking..."</p>

  <p>"Fine joke, huh? Did Sault ever pull that kind of joke? You're not telling
  me the truth, Morelle...you'd better. I'm speaking as a friend. What did he
  come to talk to you about, huh? He never even knew you...had no dealings with
  you. Why should he come to you, after he'd committed a murder?"</p>

  <p>"I've told you what happened," said Ronnie desperately.</p>

  <p>Again the quick scrutiny. "Well...we shall see."</p>

  <p>Ronald waited for a dismissal.</p>

  <p>"That sounds like the doctor's voice," he said suddenly.</p>

  <p>Steppe strode to the door and opened it.</p>

  <p>"Why, Beryl, what brings you out? Good morning, doctor...yes, very bad
  news."</p>

  <p>Beryl came past him and went straight to Ronald. "Did you see him,
  Ronnie...did he come to you?"</p>

  <p>"To me&mdash;of course not. I hardly knew him."</p>

  <p>"Don't lie," said Steppe impatiently, "we're all friends here. What makes
  you think he went to Morelle, Beryl?"</p>

  <p>"I wondered."</p>

  <p>"But you must have had some reason?"</p>

  <p>She met the big man's eyes coldly. "Must I be cross-examined? I had a
  feeling that he had been to Ronnie. I don't know why...why does one have
  these intuitions?"</p>

  <p>"We saw it in the morning papers," explained the doctor. "I am fearfully
  worried; poor Moropulos, it is dreadful."</p>

  <p>Steppe smiled unpleasantly. "He is the least troubled of any of us," he
  said callously, "and the next least is Sault. I saw the detective who
  arrested him. He said Sault went straight to sleep the moment they put him
  into the cell, and woke this morning cheerful. He must have nerves of
  iron."</p>

  <p>"Can anything be done for him, Mr. Steppe?"</p>

  <p>"He shall have the best lawyer&mdash;that Maxton fellow. He ought to be
  retained. As far as money can help, I'll do everything possible. I don't
  think it will make a scrap of difference."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Steppe, you know what an evil man Moropulos was: you know the
  provocation he offered to Ambrose Sault, isn't it possible that the same
  cause that made him kill this man also sent him to the safe?"</p>

  <p>"What safe is this...was that in the newspapers too?"</p>

  <p>"Yes: he was not a thief, was he? He would not be trying to open the safe
  for the sake of getting money? He came to get something that Moropulos
  had."</p>

  <p>"I wonder..." Steppe was impressed. "It may have been the photograph."</p>

  <p>Ronnie checked the exclamation that terror wrung. He was livid.</p>

  <p>"Do you know nothing about a photograph?" asked Steppe, with growing
  suspicion.</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>Here Beryl came to the rescue. When he saw her lips move, Ronnie expected
  worse. "Whatever it was, I am sure that the safe holds the secret. Ambrose
  would not kill a man unless...unless there was no other solution. Won't you
  open the safe, Mr. Steppe?"</p>

  <p>"I'll be damned if I do!" he vociferated violently, "there is nothing
  there which would save him."</p>

  <p>"Or justify him...or show the Greek as being what be was?"</p>

  <p>Steppe could not answer this: he had another comment to offer. His
  attitude toward her had changed slightly since the big diamond had blazed
  upon her engagement finger: a reminder of obligations past and to come.
  "You're taking a hell of an interest in this fellow, Beryl?"</p>

  <p>"I shall always take a hell of an interest in every matter I please," she
  said, eyeing him steadily. "Unless you satisfy me that nothing has been left
  undone that can be done for Ambrose, I shall go into the witness-box and
  swear to all that I know."</p>

  <p>"My dear..." Her father's expostulation she did not hear.</p>

  <p>Steppe broke into it. "There is something about this business which I
  don't understand. You and Moropulos and this fellow dined together once...or
  didn't you? Sounds mighty queer, but I won't inquire&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>"You'll open the safe?"</p>

  <p>"No!" Steppe's jaw set like a trap. "Not to save Sault or any other man!
  There is nothing there to save him, I tell you. But if there was...I wouldn't
  open it. Get that into your mind, all of you."</p>

  <p>She regarded him thoughtfully, and then Ronnie. He looked in another
  direction. "I am taking the car, father."</p>

  <p>Even Steppe did not ask her where she was going.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap31"
     name="chap31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CHRISTINA had known in the middle of the night when the
  police came to search Sault's room. A detective of high rank had been
  communicative; she heard the story with a serenity which filled the quaking
  Evie with wonder. If her face grew of a sudden peaked, a new glory glowed in
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook wept noisily and continued to weep throughout the night.
  Christina meditated upon an old suspicion of hers; that her mother regarded
  Ambrose Sault as being near enough the age of a lonely widow woman to make
  possible a second matrimonial venture. This view Evie held definitely.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Chris...my dear, I am so sorry," whimpered the younger girl, when the
  police had taken their departure. "And I've said such horrid things about
  him. Chris, poor darling, aren't you feeling awful?...I am."</p>

  <p>"Am I feeling sorry for Ambrose?" No." Christina searched her heart before
  she went on. "I'm not sorry. Ambrose was so inevitably big. Something
  tremendous must come to him; it couldn't be otherwise."</p>

  <p>"I was afraid something might happen." Evie shook her head wisely. "This
  Greek man was very insulting. Ronnie told me that. And if poor Ambrose lost
  his temper..."</p>

  <p>"Ambrose did not lose his temper." Christina's interrupted brusquely. "If
  Ambrose killed him, he did it because he intended doing it."</p>

  <p>"In cold blood!" Evie was horrified.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Ambrose must have had a reason. He tells me so...Don't gape, Evie,
  I'm not delirious. Ambrose is here. If I were blind and deaf and he sat on
  this bed he would be here, wouldn't he? Presence doesn't depend on seeing or
  hearing, or even feeling. He'd be here if he was not allowed to touch me. Go
  back to bed, Evie. I'm sleepy and I want to dream."</p>

  <p>Beryl arrived soon after eleven. Evie was out, and Mrs. Colebrook, red-
  eyed, brought her up to the bedroom. Christina was sure the girl would come
  and had got up and dressed in readiness. Some time went by before they were
  alone. Mrs. Colebrook had her own grief to express, her own memories to
  retail. She left them at last singultient in her woe.</p>

  <p>"Do you think you are strong enough to come to the house?" asked Beryl. "I
  could call for you this afternoon. Perhaps you would stay with me for a few
  days. I feel that I want you near to me." This without preliminary. They were
  too close to the elementals to pick nice paths to their objectives. They
  recognized and acknowledged their supreme interests as being common to
  both.</p>

  <p>"Mother would be glad to get rid of me for a day or two," said
  Christina.</p>

  <p>"And I am sending my father abroad," nodded Beryl, with a faint smile.
  "When shall I come?"</p>

  <p>"At three. You have not seen him?"</p>

  <p>Beryl shook her head. "They are taking him into the country. We shall
  never see him again," she said simply. "He will not send for us. I am trying
  to approach it in all the proper spirit of detachment. He is a little
  difficult to live up to...don't you feel that?"</p>

  <p>"If I say 'no' you will think I am eaten up with vanity," said Christina,
  with a quick smile. "I am rather exalted at the moment, but the reaction will
  come perhaps, in which case I shall want to hang on to your
  understanding."</p>

  <p>At three o'clock the car arrived. Mrs. Colebrook saw her daughter go
  without regret. Christina was unnatural. She had not shed a tear...Mrs.
  Colebrook had heard her laughing and had gone up in a hurry to deal with
  hysteria, only to find her reading Stephen Leacock. She was appalled. "I am
  surprised at you, Christina! Here is poor...Mr. Sault in prison..." Words
  failed her, she could only make miserable noises.</p>

  <p>"Mother has given me up," said Christina, when she was lying on a big
  settee in Beryl's room, her thin hand outstretched to the blaze. "Mother is a
  sort of female Hericletos...she finds her comfort in weeping."</p>

  <p>Beryl was toasting a muffin at the fire. "I wish it were a weeping
  matter," she said, and went straight to the subject uppermost in her mind.
  "Moropulos took a photograph of me coming from Ronald Morelle's flat. I had
  spent the night there." She looked at the muffin and turned it. "Moropulos
  was...nasty. He must have told Ambrose that he knew."</p>

  <p>Christina stirred on the sofa. "Did Ambrose know?"</p>

  <p>"Yes; I told him. Not the name of the man, but he guessed, I think...I
  know the photograph was in the safe. He went to Ronnie. Perhaps to kill him.
  I imagine Ronnie lied for his life. The police were looking for Ambrose.
  The...the killing of Moropulos was discovered by a man who heard the shot,
  and the car had just passed through Woking after the police had been warned.
  A detective saw the car outside Ronnie's flat and followed it. I don't know
  all the details. Father has seen the inspector in charge of the case. Do you
  like sugar in your tea?"</p>

  <p>"Two large pieces," said Christina; "I am rather a baby in my love of
  sugar. Do you love Ronnie very much, Beryl...you don't mind?"</p>

  <p>"No...please. Love him? I suppose so; in a way. I despise him, I think he
  is loathsome, but there are times when I have a...wistful feeling. It may be
  sheer ungovernable...you know. Yet...I would make no sacrifice for Ronnie. I
  feel that. I have made no sacrifice. Women are hypocrites when they talk of
  'giving'; they make martyrdom of their indulgence. Some women. And it pleases
  them to accept the masculine view of their irresponsibility. They love
  sympathy. For Ambrose I would sacrifice...everything. It is cheap to say that
  I would give my life, I have given more than my life. So have you."</p>

  <p>Christina was silent.</p>

  <p>"I have faced...everything," Beryl went on. She was sitting on a cushion
  between Christina and the fire, her teacup in her hands. "You have also...
  haven't you, Christina?"</p>

  <p>"About Ambrose? Yes. He has passed. The law will kill him. He expects
  that. I think he would be uncomfortable if he was spared. He told me once
  that all the way out to New Caledonia he grieved about the people who had
  been guillotined for the same offence as he had committed. The unfairness of
  it! He never posed. Can you imagine him posing? I've seen him blush when I
  have joked about that funny little trick of his; have you noticed it? Rubbing
  his chin with the back of his hand?"</p>

  <p>Beryl nodded. "He said he had tried to get out of the habit."</p>

  <p>Christina continued. "No, Ambrose couldn't pretend, or do a mean thing, or
  lie. I'm getting sentimental, my dear. Ambrose was distressed by
  sentimentality. Mother kissed his hand the day I stood for the first time. He
  was so bewildered!"</p>

  <p>They laughed together.</p>

  <p>"Are you marrying Steppe?" asked Christina. She felt no call to excuse the
  intimacy of the question.</p>

  <p>"I suppose so. There are reasons. At present he is rather impersonal. As
  impersonal as a marriage certificate or a church. I have no imagination,
  perhaps. I shall not tell him. You don't think I should...about Ronnie, I
  mean?"</p>

  <p>Christina shook her red head. "No. As I see it, no. If you must marry him,
  you are doing enough without handing him another kind of whip to flog you
  with."</p>

  <p>"I told Ambrose: that was enough," said Beryl. "My conscience was for him.
  Steppe wants no more than he gives."</p>

  <p>The clock chimed five. Ambrose at that moment was passing through the
  black gates of Wechester County Prison, and Ronald Morelle was taking tea
  with Madame Ritti.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap32"
     name="chap32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MADAME lived in a big house at St. John's Wood. A South
  American minister had lived there, and had spent a fortune on its interior
  adornment. Reputable artists had embellished its walls and ceilings, and if
  the decorations were of the heavy florid type, it is a style which makes for
  grandeur. The vast drawing-room was a place of white and gold, of glittering
  candelabras and crimson velvet hangings. How Madame had come to be its
  possessor is a long and complicated story. The minister was recalled from
  London on the earnest representations of the Foreign Office and a budding
  scandal was denied its full and fascinating development.</p>

  <p>Madame had many friends, and her house was invariably full of guests, Some
  stayed a long time with her. She liked girls about her, she told the innocent
  vicar who called regularly.</p>

  <p>Her object (confessed Madame) was to give her guests a good time. She
  succeeded. She gave dances and entertained lavishly. She made one
  stipulation: that her visitors should not play at cards. There was no
  gambling at Alemeda House. The<br>
  attitude of the police authorities toward Madame Ritti's establishment was
  one of permanent expectancy. Good people, people with newspaper names, were
  guests of hers; there was nothing furtive or underhand about her parties.
  Nobody had ever seen a drunken man come or go. The guests were never noisy,
  only&mdash;Madame's girl guests were many. And none of the people who came to
  the dances were women.</p>

  <p>Madame was bemoaning the scepticisms of the authorities to Ronnie. She was
  a very stout woman, expensively but tastefully dressed. Her lined face was
  powdered, her lips vividly red. A duller red was her hair, patently dyed.
  Dyed hair on elderly women has the effect of making the face below seem more
  fearfully old. She wore two ropes of pearls, and her hands glittered. Ronnie
  always went to Madame Ritti in his moments of depression; he had known her
  since he was little more than a school-boy. She had a house in Pimlico then,
  not so big or so finely furnished, but she had girl guests.</p>

  <p>"You know, Ronnie, I try to keep my house respectable. Is it not so? One
  tries and tries and it is hard work. Girls have so little brain. They do not
  know that men do not really like rowdiness. Is it not so? But these
  policemen...oh, the dreadful fellows! They question my maids...and it is so
  difficult to get the right kind of maid. Imagine! And the maids get
  frightened or impertinent'&mdash;she laid the accent on the last syllable.
  She was inclined to do this, otherwise her English was perfect.</p>

  <p>The door opened and a girl lounged in. She was smoking a cigarette through
  a holder&mdash;a fair, slim girl, with a straight fringe of golden hair over
  her forehead. Ronnie smiled and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Ronnie...where have you been hiding?"</p>

  <p>Madame snorted. "Is it thus you speak? 'Hello, Ronnie', my word! And to
  walk in smoking! Lola, you have to learn."</p>

  <p>"I did not know anybody else was here," replied the girl, instantly
  apologetic. "I'm awfully sorry, Madame." She hid the cigarette behind her and
  advanced demurely. "Why, it is Mr. Morelle! How do you do?"</p>

  <p>"That is better, much better," approved Madame, nodding her huge head.
  "Always modesty in girls is the best. Is it not, Ronnie? To rush about,
  fla-fla-fla!" Her representation of gaucherie was inimitable. "That is not
  good. Men desire modesty. Especially Englishmen. Americans, also. The French
  are indelicate. Is it not so? Men wish to win; if you give them victory all
  ready, they do not appreciate it. That will do, Lola." She dismissed the girl
  with a stately inclination of her head.</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing? We have not seen you for a very long time. You
  have other engagements? You must be careful. I fear for you sometimes."</p>

  <p>She patted his arm. "You will come to night! You must dress, of course. I
  do not receive men who are not in evening dress. Grand habit, you understand?
  The war made men very careless. The smoking jacket...tuxedo...what do you
  call it, and the black tie, that is no longer good style. If you are to meet
  ladies you must wear a white bow and the white waistcoat with the long coat.
  I insist upon this. I am right, is it not so? All the men wear grand habit
  nowadays. What do you wish, Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing in particular; I thought I would come along. I am feeling rather
  sick of life today."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "So you come to see my little friends. That is nice and they
  will be glad. All of them except Lola; she is going out to dinner tonight
  with a very great friend. You know your way; they are playing baccarat in the
  little salon. It amuses them and they play only for pennies."</p>

  <p>Ronnie strolled off to seek entertainment in the little salon.</p>

  <p>He was rung up at his flat that evening four times. At midnight Steppe
  called him up again. "M'sieur, he has not returned. No, m'sieur, not even to
  dress." Madame Ritti, for all the rigidity of her dress regulations, made
  exceptions seemingly.</p>

  <p>Ronald was sleeping soundly when Steppe strode into his room and let up
  the blind with a crash. "Hullo?" Ronnie struggled up. "What time is it?"</p>

  <p>"Where were you last night?" Steppe's voice was harsh, contumelious. "I
  spent the night ringing you up. Have the police been here?"</p>

  <p>"Police, no. Why should they?"</p>

  <p>"Why should they?" mimicked the visitor. "Because Saul stopped his car
  before the entrance of these flats. Luckily, they are not sure whether he
  went in or not. The detective who saw the car did not notice where Sault had
  come from. They asked me if there was anybody in Knightsbridge he would be
  likely to visit, and I said 'no', d'ye hear? I can't have you in their hands,
  Morelle. A cur like you would squeal and they would find out why he came. And
  I don't want to know."</p>

  <p>The dark eyes bent on Ronnie were glittering.</p>

  <p>"You hear? I don't want to know. Moropulos is dead. In a week or two Sault
  will be dead and Beryl will be married. Why in hell do you jump?"</p>

  <p>Ronnie affected a yawn and reached out for his dressing gown. "Of course I
  jumped," he was bold to say, even if he quaked inwardly. "You come thundering
  into my room when I'm half asleep and talk about police and Moropulos. Ugh, I
  haven't your nerve. If you want to know, Sault came here to ask me where you
  were. I thought he was a little mad and told him you were out of town.</p>

  <p>"You're a liar...a feeble liar. Get up!"</p>

  <p>He stalked out of the room, slamming the door behind him, and when Ronnie
  joined him, he was standing before the mantelpiece, scowling at the
  Anthony.</p>

  <p>"Now listen. They will make inquiries, and it is perfectly certain that
  they will trace you as being a friend of Moropulos. I want to keep out of it,
  and so do you. At present they cannot connect me with the case, except that I
  had dealings with Moropulos. So had hundreds of others. If they get busy with
  you they will turn you inside out. I don't want you to get it into your head
  that I'm trying to save you trouble. I'm not. You could roast in hell and I'd
  not turn the hose on to you! I'm thinking of myself and all the trouble I
  should have if the police got you scared. Sault didn't come here, huh? Was
  anybody here beside you?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"Only Francois."</p>

  <p>"Your servant!" Steppe frowned. "Can you trust him?"</p>

  <p>Ronnie smiled. "Francois is discreet," he said complacently. A shadow
  passed across Steppe's dark face. "About the women who come here, yes; but
  with the police? That is different. Bring him in."</p>

  <p>"I assure you, my dear fellow&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Bring him here!" roared the other.</p>

  <p>Ronnie pressed a bell sulkily.</p>

  <p>"Francois, you were here in the flat on Saturday night, huh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>"You had no visitors, huh?" Francois hesitated. "No visitors, Francois;
  you didn't open the door to Sault&mdash;you know Sault? And if detectives
  come to ask you whether Sault was here, you will tell them the truth...you
  did not see him. Your master had no visitors at all; you saw nobody and heard
  nobody." He was looking into a leather pocket-book as he spoke, fingering the
  notes that filled one compartment.</p>

  <p>Francois' eyes were on the note-case too. "Nobody came, m'sieur. I'll
  swear. I was in the pantry all the evening."</p>

  <p>"Good," said Steppe, and slipped out four notes, crushing them into a
  ball.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to see me today?" asked Ronnie, and his uncomfortable guest
  glared.</p>

  <p>"Not today. Nor tomorrow, nor any day. Where were you last night?"</p>

  <p>Francois retired in his discretion.</p>

  <p>"I went to Brighton&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You went to Ritti's&mdash;that..." He did not attempt any euphemism.
  Madame Ritti's elegant establishment he described in two pungent words. "God!
  You're...what are you? I'm pretty tough, huh? Had my gay times and known a
  few of the worst. But I've drawn a line somewhere. Sault in prison and
  Moropulos dead...and you at Ritti's! What a louse you are!"</p>

  <p>He stalked into the ball, shouted for Francois and dropped the little
  paper ball into his hand. Francois closed the door on him respectfully.</p>

  <p>"A beast..." said Ronnie, disgusted.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap33"
     name="chap33">CHAPTER XXXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">INSTRUCTED by Steppe to defend him, a solicitor interviewed
  Ambrose Sault in his airy cell. He expected to find a man broken by his awful
  position. He found instead a cheerful client who, when he was ushered into
  the cell, was engaged in covering a large sheet of paper with minute figures.
  A glance at the paper showed wondering officer of the law that Sault was
  working out a problem in mathematics. It was in fact a differential equation
  of a high and complex character.</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of Mr. Steppe, but I don't know what you can do, sir. I
  killed Moropulos. I killed him deliberately. Poor soul! How glad it must have
  been to have left that horrible body with all its animal weaknesses! I was
  thinking about it last night; wondering where it would be. Somewhere in the
  spaces of the night...between the stars. Don't you often wonder whether a
  soul has a chemical origin? Some day clever men will discover. Souls have
  substance, more tenuous than light. Light has substance. You can bend light
  with a magnet; I have seen it done. The ether has substance; compared with
  other unknown elements, ether may be as thick as treacle. Supposing some
  supernatural scientist could examine the ether as we examine a shovel-full of
  earth? Is it not possible that the soul germ might be discovered? For a soul
  has no size and no weight and no likeness to man. Some people think of a soul
  as having the appearance of the body which it inspires. That is stupid. If
  death can cling to a point of a needle, and life grows from a microscopic
  organism, how infinitesimal is the cell of the soul! The souls of all men and
  all women of the world might be brought together and be lost in one atom of
  down on a butterfly's wing!"</p>

  <p>The lawyer listened hopefully. Here was a case for eminent alienists. He
  saw the Governor of the jail as he went out. "I should very much like this
  man to be kept under medical observation," he said. "From my conversation
  with him, I am satisfied that he isn't normal."</p>

  <p>"He seems sane enough," replied the Governor, "but I will speak to the
  doctor; I suppose you will send specialists down?"</p>

  <p>"I imagine we shall: he isn't normal. He practically refused to discuss
  the crime...occupied the time by talking about souls and the size of 'em! If
  that isn't lunacy, then I'm mad!"</p>

  <p>Steppe, to whom he reported, was very thoughtful. "He isn't mad. Sault is
  a queer fellow, but he isn't mad. He thinks about such things. He is
  struggling to the light&mdash;these are the words he used to me. Yes, you can
  send doctors down you wish. You have briefed Maxton?"</p>

  <p>The lawyer nodded. "He wasn't very keen on the job. It is a little out of
  his line. Besides, he'll be made a judge in a year or two, and naturally he
  doesn't want to figure on the losing side. In fact, he turned me down
  definitely, but I was hardly back in my office&mdash;his chambers are less
  than five minutes' walk away&mdash;before he called me up and said he'd take
  the brief. I was surprised. He is going down to Wechester next week."</p>

  <p>Steppe grunted. "You understand that my name doesn't appear in this except
  to Maxton, of course. I dare say that if I went on to the witness-box and and
  told all I knew about Moropulos and what kind of a brute he was my evidence
  might make a difference. But I'm not going, and your job is to keep me out of
  this, Smith."</p>

  <p>Steppe's attitude was definite and logical. Sault, in a measure, he
  admired without liking. He saw in him a difficult and possibly dangerous man.
  That he had piqued his employer by his independence and courage did not
  influence Steppe one way or another. It was, in truth, the cause of his
  admiration. Sault was a man in possession of a dangerous secret. The folly of
  entrusting two other men with the combination word of the safe had been
  apparent from the first. He had been uneasy in his mind, more because of the
  unknown reliability of Moropulos, than because he mistrusted Sault, and he
  had decided that the scheme for the storage of compromising documents
  possessed too many disadvantages. Without telling either of his associates,
  he had arranged to transfer the contents of the safe to his own custody when
  the disaster occurred. The safe was in the hands of the curious police. And
  the more he thought about the matter, the more undesirable it seemed that the
  safe should be opened.</p>

  <p>It contained, amongst other things, the draft of a prospectus which had
  since been printed&mdash;the shares went to allotment two days before the
  murder. The draft was in his own hand, a dozen sheets of pencilled writing,
  and it described in optimistic language certain valuable assets which were in
  fact non-existent. The financial press had remarked upon the fact, and not
  content with remarking once, had industriously continued to remark. Steppe
  had made a mistake, and it was a bad mistake. The cleverest of company
  promoters occasionally overstep the line that divides optimistic estimate
  from misrepresentation.</p>

  <p>Fortunately his name did not appear on the prospectus; most unfortunately,
  he had preserved the draft. He had put it aside after Dr. Merville had copied
  the document. He had a reason for this. Jan Steppe seldom appeared in such
  transactions; even his name as vendor was skilfully camouflaged under the
  title of some stock-holding company. He was a supreme general who issued his
  orders to his commanders, gave them the rough plan of their operation and
  left them to lick it into shape. It sometimes happened that they deviated
  from his instructions, generally to the advantage of the scheme they were
  working; occasionally they fell short of his requirements, and then his draft
  proved useful in emphasising their error.</p>

  <p>And this was only one of the safe's contents. There were others equally
  dangerous. Steppe believed that his servant would die. To say that he hoped
  he would die would be untrue. Belief makes hope superfluous. It was politic
  to spend money on the defence of a man who, being grateful, would also be
  loyal. He could accept Sault's death with equanimity, and without regret.
  With relief almost.</p>

  <p>Evidence could be given which would show Moropulos in an unfavourable
  light. The Greek was a drunkard, his reputation was foul, he was provocative
  and quarrelsome. The weapon was his own (Sault had once taken it away from
  him), a plea of self-defence might succeed, but always providing that Mr. Jan
  Steppe would submit himself to cross-examination, and the reflected odium of
  acquaintance with the dead man and his killer. And Mr. Jan Steppe was
  determined to do nothing of the kind.</p>

  <p>Sault would carry his secret to the grave unless...suppose this infernal
  photograph which Moropulos had put into the safe...suppose Sault mentioned
  this to the lawyers: but he would be loyal. Steppe, having faith in his
  loyalty, decided to let him die.</p>

  <p>Sir John Maxton had changed his mind on the question of defending Sault as
  a result of an urgent request which ha reached him immediately after the
  solicitor had left his chamber He called on Beryl Merville on his way home.
  She was alone. Christina had returned to her mother, and Dr. Merville was a
  Cannes, mercifully ignorant of the comments which the financial newspapers
  were passing upon a company of which he was president.</p>

  <p>"I will undertake the defence, Beryl, though I confess it seems to me a
  hopeless proposition. I had just that moment refused the brief when you rang
  through. If I remember aright, I have met Sault...wasn't he that
  strong-looking man who came to Steppe's house the night we were dining there?
  I thought so. And Moropulos...who was he? Not the drunken fellow who made
  such a fool of himself? By jove! I hadn't connected them...I have only
  glanced at the brief, and I am seeing Sault on Friday. Fortunately I am
  spending the week-end in the country, and I can call in on my way. Smith is
  attending to the inquest and the lower Court proceedings. I saw Smith (he is
  the solicitor) this afternoon: he tells me that Steppe is paying for the
  defence. That is a professional secret, by the way. He also surprised me by
  expressing the view that Sault is mad."</p>

  <p>Beryl smiled. "He is not mad," she said quickly, "why does he think
  so?"</p>

  <p>Sir John humped his thin shoulders: a movement indicative of his contempt
  for the lawyer's opinion on any subject. "Apparently Sault talked about souls
  as though they were microbes. Smith, being a God-fearing man, was shocked. To
  him the soul stands in the same relationship to the body as the inner tube of
  a tyre to the cover. He is something of a spiritualist, and spiritualism is
  the most material of the occult sciences&mdash;it insists that spirits shall
  have noses and ears like other respectable ghosts. From what he said, I
  couldn't make head or tail of Sault's view."</p>

  <p>"Ambrose is not mad," said the girl; "he is the sanest man I have ever
  met, or will meet. His view is different; he himself is different. You cannot
  judge him by any ordinary standard."</p>

  <p>"You call him 'Ambrose'," said Sir John in surprise, "is he a friend of
  yours?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." She said no more than that, and he did not press the question. It
  was impossible to explain Ambrose.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap34"
     name="chap34">CHAPTER XXXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A CALL at the Colebrooks' in the afternoon or evening had
  become a regular practice since Christina had stayed with her. Evie had very
  carefully avoided being at home when Beryl called.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I don't like your aristocratic friend, and I know it is a great
  comfort to have somebody to speak to about poor Mr. Sault, but I simply can't
  stand her. Ronnie says that he quite understands my dislike. Christina, do
  you think Miss Merville is a...you won't be offended, will you? Do you think
  she is a good girl?"</p>

  <p>"Good? Do you mean, does she go to church?"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. Do you think she is a...virtuous girl? Ronnie says that
  some of these Society women are awfully fast. He says it wouldn't be so bad
  if there was love in it, because love excuses everything, and the real wicked
  people are those who marry for money."</p>

  <p>"Like Beryl," said Christina, "and love may excuse everything...like
  you...he hopes."</p>

  <p>Evie sighed patiently.</p>

  <p>"Do you know what I think about Ronnie?" asked Christina.</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I don't want to know," snapped Evie, roused out of her attitude
  of martyrdom.</p>

  <p>"I think he is a damned villain!...Shut up, I'm going to say it. I think
  he is the very lowest blackguard that walks the earth! He is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Evie had snatched up her coat and fled from the room.</p>

  <p>Christina's orders from the osteopath were to go to bed early. She was
  making extraordinary progress and had walked unassisted down the stairs that
  very day&mdash;she was lying dressed on the bed when Beryl arrived. "I
  suppose you'll liken me to the squire's good wife visiting the indigent
  sick," she said, "but I've brought a basket of things...fruit mostly. Do you
  mind?"</p>

  <p>"I've always wanted to meet Lady Bountiful," said Christina. "I thought
  she never stepped from the Christmas magazine covers. Did you meet Evie?"</p>

  <p>"No, I thought she was out."</p>

  <p>"She's hiding in the scullery," said Christina calmly.</p>

  <p>"She doesn't like me. Ronnie, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Christina nodded. "Ronnie at first hand may be endurable: as interpreted
  by Evie he is&mdash;there is only one word to describe him&mdash;I promised
  mother that I would never use it again. Any news?"</p>

  <p>Beryl nodded. "I had a letter&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So did I!" said Christina triumphantly, and drew a blue envelope from her
  blouse. "Written by the prison chaplain and dictated by Ambrose. Such a
  typical letter...all about the kindness of everybody, and a minute
  description of the cell, intended, I think, to show how comfortable he
  is."</p>

  <p>Christina had had a similar letter.</p>

  <p>"Sir John Maxton is defending him," said Beryl. "That is what I have come
  to tell you. He is a very great advocate."</p>

  <p>They looked at one another, and each had the same thought. "The best
  lawyer and the kindest judge and the most sympathetic jury would not save
  Ambrose," said Christina, and they looked for a long time into one another's
  eyes, and neither saw fear.</p>

  <p>Beryl did not stay long. They ran into a blind alley of conversation after
  that: a time of long quietness.</p>

  <p>Jan Steppe was waiting in the drawing-room when she returned. The maid
  need not have told her: she sensed his presence before the door was opened.
  She had seen very little of Steppe, remembering that she had engaged herself
  to marry him. She did not let herself think more about it: she had not been
  accurate when she told Christina that she had no imagination. It was simply
  that she did not allow herself the exercise of her gift. The same idea had
  occurred to Jan Steppe...he had seen little of her. He was a great believer
  in clearing up things as he went along. An unpleasant but profitable trait of
  his.</p>

  <p>"Been waiting for you an hour: you might leave word how long you'll be
  out, huh, Beryl." A foretaste, she thought, of the married man, but she was
  not offended. That was just how she expected Steppe would talk: probably he
  would swear at her when he knew her better. Nevertheless&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I go and I come as I please," she said, without heat. "You must be
  prepared to put me under lock and key if you expect to find me in any given
  place, at any given time. And then I should divorce you for cruelty."</p>

  <p>He did not often show signs of amusement. He smiled now. "So that's your
  plan. Sit down by me, Beryl. I want a little talk." She obeyed: he put his
  arm about her, and looking down, she saw his big hairy hand gripping her
  waist. "Why are you shaking, Beryl?...You're not frightened of me, huh?" he
  asked, bending his swarthy face to hers. "I&mdash;I don't know." Her teeth
  were chattering. She was frightened. In a second all her philosophy had
  failed and her courage had gone out like a blown flame. Every reserve of will
  was concentrated now in an effort to prevent herself screaming. Training,
  education, culture, all that civilisation stood for crashed at the touch of
  him. She was woman, primitive and unreasoning: woman in contact with savage
  mastery.</p>

  <p>"God! What's the matter, huh? You expect to be kissed, don't you? I'm
  going to be your husband, huh? Expect to be kissed, then, don't you? What is
  the matter with you?" She got up from the sofa, her legs sagging beneath her.
  Looking, he saw her face was colourless: Steppe was alarmed.</p>

  <p>He wanted her badly. She had the appeal which other women lacked,
  qualities which he himself lacked. And he had frightened her. Perhaps she
  would break off everything. He expected to see the ring torn from her
  trembling hand and thrown on the floor at his feet. Instead of that: "I am
  very sorry, Mr. Steppe...foolish of me. I've had rather a trying day." She
  was breathless, as though she had been running at a great pace.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Beryl, I understand. I'm too rough with you, huh? Why, it is I
  who should be sorry, and I am. Good friends, huh?" He held out his hand, and,
  shivering, she put her cold palm in his. "Doctor coming back soon? That's
  fine. You haven't sent him on any newspapers, huh? No, he could not get them
  there."</p>

  <p>Other commonplaces, and he left her to work back to the cause of her
  fright. With reason again enthroned (this was somewhere near four o'clock in
  the morning) she could find no other reason than the obvious one. She was
  afraid of Steppe as a man. Not because he was a man, but because he was the
  kind of man that he was. He was a better man than Ronnie, she argued. He had
  principles of sorts. Ronnie had none. Perhaps she would get used to him: up
  to that moment it did not occur to her to break her engagement, and,
  curiously enough, she never thought of her father. Steppe was sure in his
  mind that he held her through Dr. Merville. That was not true. Neither sense
  of honour nor filial duty bound her to her promise, nor was marriage an
  expiation. She must wear away her life in some companionship. After, was
  Ambrose Sault, in what shape she did not know or consider. She never thought
  of him as an angel.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap35"
     name="chap35">CHAPTER XXXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SOMETIMES the brain plays a trick upon you. In the midst of
  your everyday life you have a vivid yet elusive recollection of a past which
  is strange to you. You see yourself in circumstances and in a setting wholly
  unfamiliar. Like a flash it comes and goes; as swiftly as the shutter of a
  camera falls. Flick! It is gone and you can recall no incident upon which you
  can reconstruct the vision of the time-fraction. Beryl saw herself as she had
  been before she came upon a shabby grey-haired man studying the wallpaper in
  the hall of Dr. Merville's house. Yet she could never fix an impression. If
  the change of her outlook had been gradual, she might have traced back step
  by step. But it had been violent: catastrophic. And this bewildering truth
  appeared: that there had been no change so far as Ronnie was concerned. He
  had not altered in any degree her aspect of life. It worried her that it
  should be so. But there it was.</p>

  <p>She had a wire from her father the next morning to say that he was
  returning at once. Dr. Merville had seen certain comments in the newspaper,
  and was taking the next train to Paris. She did not go to the station to meet
  him, and was not in the house when he arrived. Even in the days that followed
  she saw little of him, for he seemed to have pressing business which kept him
  either at Steppe's office or at Steppe's house. One night she went to dinner
  there. It was a meal remarkable for one circumstance. Although Sault was
  coming up for trial the following week, they did not speak of him. It was as
  though he were already passed from the world. She was tempted once to raise
  his name, but refrained. Discussion would be profitless, for they would only
  expose the old platitudes and present the conventional gestures.</p>

  <p>In the car as they drove home the doctor was spuriously cheerful. His
  lighter manner generally amused Beryl; now her suspicions were aroused, for
  of late, her father's laborious good humour generally preceded a request for
  some concession on her part. It was not until she was saying good night that
  he revealed the nature of his request. "Don't you think it would be a good
  idea if you cut your engagement as short as possible, dear?" he asked, with
  an effort to appear casual. "Steppe doesn't want a big wedding&mdash;one
  before the civil authorities with a few close friends to lunch
  afterwards&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You mean he wants to marry at once?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not at once, but&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;in a week or so.
  Personally, I think it is an excellent scheme. Say in a month&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, no!"&mdash;she was vehement in her objection&mdash;"not in a month. I
  must have more time. I'm very sorry, father, if I am upsetting your
  plans."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," said his lips. His face told another story. Possibly Steppe
  had issued peremptory instructions. She was certain that if she had accepted
  his views meekly, the doctor would have named the date and the hour. Steppe
  may have expressed his desire, also, that she should be married in grey. He
  was the sort of man who would want his bride to wear grey.</p>

  <p>Jan Steppe, for all his wealth and experience, retained in some respects
  the character of his boer ancestors. His dearest possession was a large
  family Bible, crudely illustrated, and this he cherished less for its message
  (printed in the taal) than for its family records that covered four
  fly-leaves inserted for the purpose. He liked wax fruit under glass shades,
  and there hung in his library crayon enlargements of his parents, heavily
  framed in gold. He was a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, and maintained
  a pew in the kirk at Heidelberg where he was born and christened. He believed
  in the rights of husbands to exact implicit obedience from their wives. The
  ultimate value of women was their prolificacy; he might forgive
  unfaithfulness; sterility was an unpardonable offence. Springing, as he did,
  from a race of cattle farmers, he thought of values in terms of stock
  breeding. Instinctively Beryl had discovered this: on this discovery her
  repugnance was based, though she never realized the cause until long
  afterwards.</p>

  <p>The day of the trial was near at hand. Sir John Maxton had had two
  interviews with his client. After the second, he called on her. "I haven't
  seen you since I met him, have I? Your Sault! What is he, in the name of
  heaven? He fascinates me, Beryl, fascinates me! Sometimes I wish I had never
  taken the brief&mdash;not because of the hopelessness of it&mdash;it is
  hopeless, you know&mdash;but..."</p>

  <p>"But?" she repeated, when he paused, puzzling to express himself
  clearly.</p>

  <p>"He is amazing: I have never met anybody like him. I am not particularly
  keen on my fellows, perhaps I know them too well and have seen too much of
  their meannesses, their evilness. But Sault is different. I went to discuss
  his case and found myself listening to his views on immortality. He says that
  what we call immortality can be reduced to mathematical formulae. He limited
  the infinite to a circle, and convinced me. I felt like a fourth-form boy
  listening to a 'brain', and found myself respectful! But it wasn't that...it
  was a sweetness, a clearness&mdash;something Christlike. Queer thing to say
  about a man who has committed two murders, both in cold blood, but it is a
  fact. Beryl, it is impossible to save him, it is only fair to tell you. I
  cannot help feeling that if we could get at the character of this man
  Moropulos he would have a chance, but he absolutely refuses to talk of
  Moropulos. 'I did it', he says, 'what is the use? I shot him deliberately. He
  was drunk! I was in no danger from him. I shot him because I wanted him to
  die. When I walked over to where he lay, he was dead. If he had been alive I
  should have shot him again'. What can one do? If he had been anybody else I
  should have retired from the case.</p>

  <p>"There is a safe in this case, probably you have read about it in the
  newspapers. It was found in the Greek's house, and is a sort of secret
  repository. At any rate, it cannot be opened except by somebody who knows the
  codeword. I suspected Sault of being one who could unlock the door, and
  challenged him. He did not deny his knowledge, but declined to give me the
  word. He never lies: if he says he doesn't know, it is not worth while
  pressing him, because he really doesn't know. Beryl, would your father have
  any knowledge of that safe?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "It is unlikely, but I will ask him. Father says that
  Ronnie is going to the trial. Is he a witness?"</p>

  <p>Sir John had, as it happened, seen Ronnie that day and was able to inform
  her. "Ronnie is writing the story of the trial for a newspaper. What has
  Sault done to him? He is particularly vicious about him. In a way I can
  understand the reason if they had ever met. Sault is the very antithesis of
  Ronnie. They would 'swear' like violently different colours. I asked him if
  he would care to stay with me&mdash;I have had the Kennivens' house placed at
  my disposal, they are at Monte Carlo&mdash;but he declined with alacrity. Why
  does he hate Sault? He says that he is looking forward to the trial."</p>

  <p>Beryl smiled. "'For lo, the wicked bend the bow that they may shoot in
  darkness at the upright heart'," she quoted.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap36"
     name="chap36">CHAPTER XXXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RONALD MORELLE also found satisfaction in apposite
  quotations from the scriptures. When he was at school the boys had a game
  which was known as 'trying the luck'. They put a Bible on the table, inserted
  a knife between the leaves, and whatever passage the knife-point rested
  against, was one which solved their temporary difficulties. Ronnie had
  carried this practice with him, and whenever a problem arose, he would bring
  down The Book and seek a solution. He utilised for this purpose a miniature
  sword which he had bought in Toledo, a copy of the Sword of the Constable. It
  was a tiny thing, a few inches in length. Its handle was of gold, its
  glittering blade an example of the best that the Fabrica produced.</p>

  <p>"It is really wonderful how helpful it is, Christina," said Evie, to whom
  he had communicated the trick. "The other day, when I was wondering whether
  you would be better for good, or whether this was only, so to speak, a flash
  in the pan...because I really don't believe in osteopaths, they aren't proper
  doctors...I stuck a hatpin in the Bible and what do you think it said?"</p>

  <p>"Beware of osteopaths?" suggested Christina lazily.</p>

  <p>"No, it said, "Make me to hear joy and gladness, that the bone which Thou
  hast broken may rejoice."</p>

  <p>"My bones were never broken," said Christina, and asked with some
  curiosity: "How do you reconcile your normal holiness with playing monkey
  tricks with the Bible?"</p>

  <p>"It isn't anything of the sort," replied Evie tartly, "the Bible is
  supposed to help you in your difficulties."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, my bones rejoice to hear that Ronnie is such a Bible student,"
  said Christina.</p>

  <p>Evie knew that to discuss Ronald Morelle with her sister would be a waste
  of time. Ronnie was to her the perfect man. She even found, in which
  Christina described as a 'monkey trick' a piety with which she had never
  dreamt of crediting him.</p>

  <p>Christina was unjust, but she hoped in time to change her opinions. In the
  meantime, Ronald Morelle was moulding Evie's opinions in certain essentials
  pertaining to social relationship, and, insensibly, her views were veering to
  the course he had set. She had definitely accepted his attitude toward
  matrimony. She felt terribly advanced and superior to her fellows, and had
  come to the point where she sneered when a wedding procession passed her. So
  far, her assurance, her complete plerophory of Ronnie's wisdom, rested in the
  realms of untested theory. But the time was coming when she must practise all
  that Ronnie preached, and all that she believed. She was no fool, however
  intense her self-satisfaction. She was narrow, puritanical, in the sense to
  which that term had been debased, and eminently respectable. He might have
  converted her to devil worship and she would have remained respectable.
  Ronnie was going abroad after the trial. He had made money, and although he
  was not a very rich man, he had in addition to the solid fortune he had
  acquired through his association with Steppe, a regular income from his
  father's estate. He intended breaking with Steppe, and was in negotiation for
  villas in the south of France and in Italy. Evie knew that she would
  accompany him, if he insisted. She knew equally well, that she would no
  longer be accounted respectable. That thought horrified her.</p>

  <p>To her a wedding ring was adequate compensation for many inconveniences.
  The fascinations of Ronnie were wearing thin: familiarity, without breeding
  contempt, had produced a mutation of values. The 'exceedingly marvellous' had
  become the 'pleasantly habitual'. And she had, by accident, met a boy she had
  known years before. He had gone out to Canada with his parents and had
  returned with stories of immense spaces, of snow-clad mountains and cosy
  farms; stories that had interested and unsettled her. And he had been so
  impressed by her, and so humble in the face of her imposing worldliness.
  Ronnie was, of course, never humble, she did not impress him, or make him
  blush or fell gauche. She had more of the grand lady feeling with Teddy
  Williams than she could ever experience in the marble villas of Palermo. And
  Teddy placed a tremendously high value upon respectability. Still...he could
  not be compared with Ronnie.</p>

  <p>She had consented to pay a visit to Ronnie's flat. She was half-way to
  losing her respectability when she reluctantly agreed, but the thrill of the
  projected adventure put Teddy Williams out of her mind. The great event was
  to be on the day after Ronnie came back from Wechester.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile, Ronnie, anticipating a dull stay at the Assize town,
  made arrangements to fill in his time pleasantly.</p>

  <p>The day before he left London he called on Madame Ritti, and Madame gave a
  sympathetic hearing to his proposition.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it will amuse Lola, but she must travel with her maid. One must be
  careful, is it not so? One meets people in such unlikely places, and I will
  not have a word spoken against my dear girls."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap37"
     name="chap37">CHAPTER XXXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE case of the King against Ambrose Sault came on late in
  the afternoon of the third Assize day. The Assizes opened on the Monday, and
  the first two and a half days were occupied by the hearing of a complicated
  case of fraudulent conversion; it was four o'clock in the afternoon when
  Sault, escorted by three warders, stepped into the pen and listened to the
  reading of the indictment.</p>

  <p>It was charged against him that "He did wilfully kill and murder Paul
  Dimitros Moropulos by shooting at him with a revolving pistol with intent to
  kill and murder the aforesaid Paul Dimitros Moropulos".</p>

  <p>He pleaded "Guilty", but by the direction of the Court, a technical plea
  of "Not Guilty" was entered in accordance with the practice of the law. The
  proceedings were necessarily short, the reading of the indictment, the
  swearing in of the jury, and the other preliminaries were only disposed of
  before the Court rose. Wechester Assize Court dates back to the days of
  antiquity. There is a legend that King Arthur sat in the great outer hall, a
  hollow cavern of a place with vaulted stone roof and supporting pillars worn
  smooth by contact with the backs of thirty generations of litigants waiting
  their turn to appear in the tiny court-house. "I knew I was going to have a
  dull time," complained Ronnie. "Why on earth didn't they start the trial on
  Monday?"</p>

  <p>"Partly because I could not arrive until today," said Sir John. "The judge
  very kindly agreed to postpone the hearing to suit my convenience. I had a
  big case in town. Partly, so the judge tells me, because he wanted to dispose
  of the fraud charges before he took the murder case. Are you really very
  dull, Ronnie?" He looked keenly at the other.</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't anybody be dull in a town that offers no other amusement than a
  decrepit cinema?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I caught a glimpse of you as I was coming from the station, and
  unless I was dreaming, I saw you driving with a lady&mdash;it is not like you
  to be dull when you have feminine society."</p>

  <p>"She was the daughter of a very old friend of mine," said Ronnie
  conventionally.</p>

  <p>"You are fortunate in having so many old friends with so many pretty
  daughters," said Sir John dryly. Ronnie was in court at ten o'clock the
  following morning. The place was filled, the narrow public gallery packed.
  The scarlet-robed judge came in, preceded by the High Sheriff, and followed
  by his chaplain; a few seconds later came the sound of Ambrose Sault's feet
  on the stairway leading to the lock. He walked to the end of the pen, rested
  his big hands on the ledge and bowed to the judge. And then his eyes roved
  round the court. They rested smilingly upon Sir John, bewigged and gowned,
  passed incuriously over the press table, and stopped at Ronald Morelle. His
  face was inscrutable: his thoughts, whatever they were, found no
  expression.</p>

  <p>Ronald met his eyes and smiled. This man had come to him with murder in
  his heart: but for Ronnie's ready wit and readier lie, his name too would
  have appeared in the indictment. That was his thought as he returned the
  gaze. Here was his enemy: trapped beyond danger. His smile was a taunt and an
  exultation.</p>

  <p>Sault's face was not troubled, his serenity was undisturbed. Rather, it
  seemed to Sir John, who was watching him, that there was a strange benignity
  in his countenance, that humanised and transfigured him.</p>

  <p>Trials always wearied Ronnie. They were so slow, so tedious: there were so
  many fiddling details, usually unimportant, to be related and analysed. Why
  did they take the trouble? Sault was guilty by his own confession, and yet
  they were treating him as though he were innocent. What did it matter whether
  it was eight or nine o'clock when the policeman stopped the car in Woking and
  asked Sault to produce his licence? Why bother with medical evidence as to
  the course the bullet took&mdash;Moropulos was dead; did it matter whether
  the bullet was nickel or lead? From time to time sheer ennui drove him out of
  the Court. He had no work to do&mdash;his description of Sault in the dock,
  his impression of the Court scene, had been written before he left his hotel.
  The verdict was inevitable. Yet still they droned on, these musty lawyers;
  still the old man on the bench interjected his questions.</p>

  <p>Sir John, in his opening speech, had discounted his client's confession.
  Sault felt that he was morally guilty. It was for the jury to say whether he
  was guilty in law. A man in fear of his life had the right to defend himself,
  even if in his defence he destroyed the life of the attacker. The revolver
  was the property of Moropulos, was it not fair to suppose that Moropulos had
  carried the pistol for the purpose of intimidating Sault, that he had
  actually threatened him with the weapon? And the judge had taken this
  possibility into account, and his questions were directed to discovering the
  character and habits of the dead man. Steppe, had he been in the box, would
  have saved the prisoner's life. Ronnie Morelle knew enough to enlighten the
  judge. Steppe had not come, Ronnie would have been amused if it were
  suggested that he should speak.</p>

  <p>The end of the trial came with startling suddenness. Ronnie was out of
  Court when the jury retired, and he hurried back as they returned. The white-
  headed associate rose from behind his book-covered table, and the jury
  answered to their names. "Gentlemen of the jury, have you considered your
  verdict?"</p>

  <p>"We have." The voice of the foreman was weak and almost inaudible.</p>

  <p>"Do you find the prisoner at the Bar guilty or not guilty?"</p>

  <p>A pause. "Guilty."</p>

  <p>There was a sound like a staccato whisper. A quick explosion of soft
  sound, and then silence.</p>

  <p>"Ambrose Sault, what have you to say that my lord should not condemn you
  to die?"</p>

  <p>Ambrose stood easily in the dock: both hands were on the ledge before him,
  and his head was bent in a listening posture. "Nothing."</p>

  <p>His cheerful voice rang through the Court. Ronnie saw him look down to the
  place where Sir John was sitting, and smile, such a smile of encouragement
  and sympathy as a defending lawyer might give to his condemned client; coming
  from the condemned to the advocate, it was unique. The judge was sitting
  stiffly erect. He was a man of seventy, thin and furrowed of face. Over his
  wig lay a square of black silk, a corner drooped to his forehead. "Prisoner
  at the Bar, the jury have found the only verdict which it was possible for
  them to return after hearing the evidence."</p>

  <p>He stopped here, and Ronnie expected to hear the usual admonition which
  precedes the formal sentence, but the judge went on to the performance of his
  dread duty. "The sentence of this Court is, and this Court doth ordain, that
  you be taken to the place from whence you came, and from thence to a place of
  execution and there you shall be hanged by the neck until you are dead, and
  your body shall afterwards be buried within the precincts of the prison in
  which you were last confined. And may God have mercy upon your soul."</p>

  <p>Ambrose listened, his lips moving. He was repeating to himself word by
  word the sentence of the law. He had the appearance of a man who was
  intensely interested. A warder touched his arm and awoke him from his
  absorption. He started, smiled apologetically, and turning, walked down the
  stairs and out of sight.</p>

  <p>"Goodbye, my friend&mdash;I shall see you once again,' said Ronnie. He had
  decided to leave nothing undone that would authorise his presence at the
  execution. Going into the hall to see the procession of the judge with his
  halberdiers and his trumpet-men, he saw Sir John passing, and his eyes were
  red. Ronnie was amused.</p>

  <p>"Are you travelling back to town to-night, Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>"No, Sir John. I leave in the morning."</p>

  <p>Sir John wrinkled his brows in thought. "You saw him? Did you ever see a
  man like him; I am bewildered and baffled. Poor Sault, and yet why 'poor'?
  Poor world, I think, to lose a soul as great as his."</p>

  <p>"He is also a murderer," said Ronnie, with gentle sarcasm. "He has
  brutally killed two men&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing brutal in Ambrose Sault." Sir John checked himself. "I
  go back by the last train. I am dining with the judge in his lodgings, and he
  told me I might bring you along."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, I've a lot of work to do," said Ronnie, so hastily that the
  other searched his face.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you are alone here?"</p>

  <p>"Quite ,...the truth is, I promised to drive with a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>"A man?"</p>

  <p>Lola came through the big doors at that moment.</p>

  <p>"I was looking for you, Ronnie...my dear, I am bored to tears..."</p>

  <p>Sir John looked after them and shook his head. "Rotten," he said. That a
  man could bring his light o' love to this grim carnival of pain!</p>

  <h2><a id="chap38"
     name="chap38">CHAPTER XXXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">In the afternoon Christina received a note delivered by
  hand. "Mother, would you mind if I spent the night with Miss Merville?" Mrs.
  Colebrook shook her head without speaking. In these days she lived in an
  atmosphere of gloom, for she had adopted the right of chief griever.</p>

  <p>"Nobody else seems to care about poor Mr. Sault," she had said many times.
  "I really can't understand you, Christina, after all he has done for you. I
  won't say that you're heartless, because I will never believe that about a
  child of mine. You're young."</p>

  <p>"Do you think Mr. Sault would like to know that you go weeping about the
  house for his sake?" asked Christina patiently.</p>

  <p>"Of course he would. I should like somebody to grieve over me, and I'm
  sure he'd like to know that somebody was dropping a silent tear over him." On
  the whole, Mrs. Colebrook preferred to be alone that night. The late editions
  would have the result of the trial. Evie would be out. She was going to a
  theatre with Teddy Williams. That, Mrs. Colebrook thought, was heartless, but
  Evie had an excuse. Mr. Sault had done nothing for her: had even quarrelled
  with her.</p>

  <p>So Christina went gladly to her new friend. She saw the doctor for a
  minute in the hall, and in his professional mood, Dr. Merville was charming.
  "You open up vistas of a new career for me, Miss Colebrook," he laughed.
  "With you as a shining example, I am almost inclined to take up osteopathy in
  my old age! Really, you have mended wonderfully."</p>

  <p>In Beryl's little room she heard the news..."We expected it, of course,"
  she said. "Did Sir John wire anything about Ambrose...how he bore it?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, here is the telegram."</p>

  <p>Christina read: Sault sentenced to death. He showed splendid courage and
  calmness.</p>

  <p>"Naturally he would," said Christina quietly. "I am glad the strain is
  over, not that I think it was a strain for him. Beryl, I hope we are going to
  be worthy disciples of our friend. There are times when I am very afraid. It
  is a heavy burden for a badly equipped mind like mine. But I think I shall go
  though without making a weak fool of myself. I almost wish that I was
  marrying Jan Steppe. The prospect would take my mind off...no, it wouldn't.
  And it doesn't in your case."</p>

  <p>"I don't want to have my mind relieved of Ambrose," said Beryl. "We can do
  nothing, Christina. We never have been able to do anything. Ambrose could
  appeal, but, of course, he won't do anything of the sort. I had a mad idea of
  going to see him. But I don't think I could endure that."</p>

  <p>Christina shook her head. She saw him every day. He never left her, he was
  sitting there now with his hands folded, silent, thoughtful. She avoided
  saying anything that would hurt him. In moments when Evie annoyed her, as she
  did lately, the thought that Ambrose would not approve cut short her tart
  retort. She confessed this much, and Beryl agreed. She felt the same way.</p>

  <p>Beryl had had another bed put in her own room, and they talked far into
  the night There was nothing that Ambrose had ever said which they did not
  recall. He had said surprisingly little. "Did he ever tell you in so many
  words that he loved you, Beryl?"</p>

  <p>Only for a second did Beryl hesitate. "Yes," she said.</p>

  <p>"You didn't want to tell me that, did you? You were afraid that I should
  be hurt. I'm not. I love his loving you. I don't grudge you a thought. He
  ought to love somebody humanly. I always think that the one incompleteness of
  Christ was His austerity. That doesn't sound blasphemous or irreverent, does
  it? But He missed so much experience because He was not a father with a
  father's feelings. Or a husband with a husband's love. I suppose theological
  people can explain this satisfactorily. I am taking an unlearned view...
  "</p>

  <p>Evie was very nervous, thought Christina, when she saw her the next
  afternoon. Usually she was self-possession itself. She snapped at the girl
  when she asked her how she had enjoyed the play, although she was penitent
  immediately. "Mother has been going on at me for daring to see a play the
  night poor Ambrose was sentenced," she said. "I'm sure nobody feels more
  sorry than I do. You're different to mother. I ought to have known that you
  weren't being sarcastic."</p>

  <p>"How is Teddy? I remember him when he was a tiny boy. Do you like him,
  Evie?"</p>

  <p>Evie pursed her red lips. "He's not bad," she granted. "He's very young
  and...well, simple."</p>

  <p>"You worldly old woman!" smiled Christina. "You make me feel a hundred!"
  Yes, Evie was nervous. And she took an unusual amount of trouble in dressing.
  "Where are you going tonight&mdash;all dolled up?"</p>

  <p>Evie was pained. "That is an awfully vulgar expression, Chris: it makes me
  feel like one of those street women. I am going to meet a girl friend."</p>

  <p>"Where are you going, Evie?" asked Christina, quietly insistent.</p>

  <p>"I am going to see Ronnie, if you want to know. You make me tell lies when
  I don't want to," snapped Evie. "Why can't you leave me alone?"</p>

  <p>Christina sighed. "Why don't I, indeed," she agreed wearily. "What is to
  be will be: I can't be responsible for your life, and it is stupid of me to
  try. Go ahead, Evie, and good luck!" a remark which considerably mystified
  Evie Colebrook. But, as she told herself, she had quite enough to try her
  without worrying about Christina and her morbid talk.</p>

  <p>The principal cause of her worry was an exasperating lapse of memory. In
  the agitation of the proposal, she had forgotten whether Ronnie had asked her
  to meet him in the park at the usual place, or whether she had agreed to go
  straight to the flat. An arrangement had been made one way or the other, she
  was sure. She decided to go to the flat.</p>

  <p>Beryl came to the same decision. "Steppe and I are going to Ronnie's place
  tonight," said Dr. Merville. "It will be a sort
  of&mdash;er&mdash;board&mdash;meeting as Jan is leaving London tomorrow. I
  haven't had a chance of asking him about a matter which affects me
  personally. You do not read the financial newspapers, do you, Beryl? You
  haven't heard from the Fennings, or any of the people you
  know&mdash;er&mdash;any unpleasant comment?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head again.</p>

  <p>"Jan was asking me again about...you, Beryl. I can't get him to talk about
  anything else. I think you will have to decide one way or the other," he was
  pulling on his gloves, an operation which gave him an excuse for looking
  elsewhere than at her. "It struck me that he was growing impatient. You are
  to please yourself...but the suspense is rather getting on my nerves."</p>

  <p>She made no answer until, accompanying him to the door, she made a sudden
  resolve.</p>

  <p>"How long will you be at Ronnie's?" she asked. "An hour, no longer, I
  think, why?"</p>

  <p>"I wondered," she said. It was lamentably, wickedly weak in her; a servile
  surrender to expediency. She knew it, but in her desperation she seized the
  one straw that floated upon the inexorable current which was carrying her to
  physical and moral damnation. Ronnie must save her: Ronnie, to whom she had
  the best right of appeal. It was a bitter, hateful confession, that,
  despising him, she loved him. She loved the two halves of the perfect man.
  Sault and Ronnie Morelle were the very soul and body of love. She loathed
  herself&mdash;yet she knew it was the truth. Ronnie must help. He might not
  be so bad as she believed him to be; there might be a spirit in him, a
  something to which she could reach. The instinct of honour, some spark of
  courage and justice transmitted to him by his ancestors.</p>

  <p>Anything was better than Steppe, she told herself wildly, anything! She
  dreamt of him, terrible dreams: by day she kept him from her mind. And then
  came night and the dreams that made her very soul writhe in agony, lest, in
  dreaming, she had exposed a wickedness which consciously she had seen in
  herself. If Ronnie failed&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Ronnie will fail; you know he will fail," whispered the voice of reason.
  She could but try.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap39"
     name="chap39">CHAPTER XXXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A FOREIGN-LOOKING servant opened the door to Evie Colebrook.
  "Mr. Morelle is out, mademoiselle; is he expecting you?"</p>

  <p>She was in a flutter, ready to fly on the least excuse. "Yes...but I will
  come back again."</p>

  <p>Francois opened the door wide. "If mademoiselle will wait a little...
  perhaps Mr. Morelle will return very soon." Francois was an ugly,
  bullet-headed little man and his name was a war creation. It was in fact
  'Otto', and he was a German Swiss.</p>

  <p>She came timidly into the big room and was impressed by the solid luxury
  of it. She would not sit, preferring to walk about, delighted with the
  opportunity of making so leisurely an inspection of a room hallowed by such
  associations. So this was where Ronnie worked so hard. She laid her hand
  affectionately upon the big black table. Francois watched her a little sadly.
  He had a sister of her age, and in his eyes at least, as pretty. Moreover,
  Francois had grown tired of his employer. Menservants were in demand and he
  would have no difficulty in finding another job. Except for this: Ronald paid
  extraordinarily good wages. He saw her pick up a framed photograph. "This is
  Mr. Morelle's portrait, isn't it? I don't like it."</p>

  <p>Evie felt on terms with the man. It seemed natural that she should. She
  had wondered if Francois would be at Palermo too.</p>

  <p>"Yes, mademoiselle, that is his portrait."</p>

  <p>Evie frowned critically at the picture. "It is not half good-looking
  enough."</p>

  <p>"That is possible, mademoiselle," said Francois, without enthusiasm. He
  had never done such a thing before. He marvelled at his own temerity, even
  now. "Mademoiselle, you will not angry if I say some things?" he asked, and
  as he grew more and more agitated his English took a quainter turn.</p>

  <p>Evie opened her eyes in astonishment. "No, of course not."</p>

  <p>"And you must promise not to tell Mr. Morelle."</p>

  <p>"It depends," hesitated the girl, and then, "I promise."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," said Francois a little huskily. "I have a little sister so
  big as you in Switzerland. Her name is Freda, and, mademoiselle, when I see
  you here, I think of her, and I say I will speak to this good, good young
  lady. Mademoiselle, I do not like to see you here!"</p>

  <p>He said this dramatically. Evie went crimson. "I don't know what you
  mean."</p>

  <p>"I have make you cross," said Francois, in an agony of self-reproach. "You
  think I am silly, but I speak with a good heart."</p>

  <p>There was only one way out of this awkward conversation. Evie became
  easily confidential. She spoke as a woman of the world to a man of the world.
  "Of course you did," she said. "I appreciate what you say, Francois. If I saw
  a girl...well...compromising herself, I mean a girl who hadn't my experience
  of the world, I'd say the same as you, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A knock at the outer door interrupted her. Francois shot an imploring
  glance in her direction, and she nodded. "There you are, Ronnie...didn't you
  say I was to come straight here?"</p>

  <p>"Hello, Evie." He seemed a little annoyed. "I told you I would meet you at
  the Statue."</p>

  <p>Evie was abashed. "Oh, I am sorry," she began, but he went on "Any letter,
  Francois?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'sieur, on the desk."</p>

  <p>"All right, clear out."</p>

  <p>But Francois lingered. "M'sieur."</p>

  <p>"Well?" asked Ronnie, turning with a scowl.</p>

  <p>Francois was ill at ease. "Tomorrow my brother is coming from Interlaken;
  may I have an evening for myself, m'sieur?"</p>

  <p>Ronald was angry for many reasons; he was not in the mood to grant
  favours. "You have Sundays and you have your holidays. That's enough," he
  said. Francois went out, crestfallen. "I suppose you think I'm unkind," said
  Ronnie, with a laugh as he helped take off her coat. "But if you give those
  sort of people an inch they'll take the earth." He dropped his hands upon her
  shoulders and looked into her eyes. "It is lovely to have you here. You're
  two hours too soon."</p>

  <p>"Am I?" she asked in alarm. "I was so upset last night that I don't know
  what you said."</p>

  <p>"I said ten o'clock, but it doesn't matter. Only Francois would have been
  gone by then. How lovely you are, Evie! How slim and straight and
  delightful!" Suddenly she was in his arms, her face against his.</p>

  <p>She struggled, pushing him away, escaping at last, too breathless for
  speech. "You smother me," she gasped. "Don't kiss me like that, Ronnie. Let's
  talk. You know I oughtn't to be here," she urged. "But I did so want to see
  your beautiful house."</p>

  <p>He did not take his eyes from her. "You are going to do what I asked
  you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, shook her head, her heart going furiously. "I don't
  know&mdash;Ronald, I do love you, but I'm so&mdash;so frightened."</p>

  <p>He drew her down to him and she sat demurely on the edge of the deep
  lounge chair he occupied. "And I'll take you to&mdash;where shall I take
  you?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Somewhere in Italy, you said."</p>

  <p>"Palermo! Glorious Palermo...darling, think of what it will be, just you
  and I. No more snatched meetings and disagreeable sisters, eh?"</p>

  <p>Evie was thinking: he did not break in upon her thoughts. She was good to
  see. More attractive in her silence, for she had he slightest of cockney
  twangs. "I wish Christina could come," she said at last; a note of defiance
  was in her tone. "A change like that would be splendid for her, and I've
  always planned to give her one."</p>

  <p>"Christina? Good lord! Come with us? You mad little thing, I'm not running
  a sanatorium." He laughed, leaning back in the chair to look up at her.</p>

  <p>"Ronnie, I know it is awful nerve on my part...but if you love me..." He
  expected this. The philosophies he imparted seldom survived the acid test
  which opportunity applied. "I suppose," she went on nervously, "it would be
  too much of a come-down to think of&mdash;of marrying me?"</p>

  <p>"Marriage!" His voice was reproving, his manner that of a man grievously
  hurt. "You know what I think&mdash;what we both think about marriage,
  Evie?"</p>

  <p>"It is&mdash;it is respectable, anyway,"</p>

  <p>"Respectable!" he scoffed. "Who respects you? Who thinks any worse of you
  if you aren't married? People respect you for your independence. Marriage! It
  is a form of bondage invented by people who make a jolly good living out of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Well, religion is something. And the Bible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Ronnie jumped up. "We'll try the luck, Evie!" He went to a shelf and took
  down a book. Evie was a dubious spectator. The fallibility of the method
  seemed open to question when such enormous issues were at stake. Yet she
  accepted a trifle reluctantly, the little sword he handed to her, and thrust
  it between the pages of the closed book. She opened it at the passage the
  sword had found.</p>

  <p>"'Woe unto you&mdash;'" she began, but he snatched the book from her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"No, silly," he said, and read glibly. "'There is no fear in love: perfect
  love casteth out fear!'"</p>

  <p>Evie was sceptical. "You made it up!" she accused. "I mean, you only
  pretended it was there. I know that passage. I learnt it at school&mdash;it
  is in John."</p>

  <p>He chuckled, delighted at her astuteness. "You little bishop," he said,
  and kissed her. "Now sit and amuse yourself. I want to speak to
  Francois,"</p>

  <p>He was on his way to the pantry to dismiss Francois to his home when the
  bell sounded. He stopped Francois with a gesture.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap40"
     name="chap40">CHAPTER XL</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"Don't open the door for a minute," he said in a low voice.
  "Evie, will you come tomorrow night&mdash;no not tomorrow. Today is Monday,
  come on Friday."</p>

  <p>"Yes, dear." She was glad to escape.</p>

  <p>"Through there," he pointed. "Francois, let mademoiselle out by the pantry
  door after you have answered the bell."</p>

  <p>Who was the visitor? People did not call upon him except by
  invitation&mdash;except Steppe. And Jan Steppe came slowly and suspiciously
  into the hall. Ronnie scarcely noticed the doctor who followed him. "Why were
  you keeping me waiting?" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Francois could not have heard the bell," answered Ronnie easily.</p>

  <p>"That's a lie." He looked round the room and sniffed. "You had a woman
  here, as usual, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Ronnie looked injured.</p>

  <p>"M'm. Some shop-girl," insisted the big man. "One of your pickups,
  huh?"</p>

  <p>"I tell you I have been alone all the evening," said Ronnie, resigned.
  "Francois, isn't that so?"</p>

  <p>Jan Steppe saved the servant from needless perjury. "He's as big a liar as
  you are. You'll burn your fingers one of these days." He had a deep harsh
  laugh, entirely without merriment. "You had a little trouble about one last
  year, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>Merville, impatient and fretful, broke in. "Let him alone, Steppe. I want
  to get this business over."</p>

  <p>Steppe stared at him. "Oh, you want to get it over, do you? We'll hurry
  things up for you, doctor!"</p>

  <p>Ronnie was interested. He had never heard Steppe speak to Merville in that
  tone. There had been a marked change in Jan's attitude, even in the past few
  days. However, Ronnie was chiefly concerned in considering all the possible
  reasons for this call. The doctor explained and Ronnie breathed again.</p>

  <p>"We'll sit here," said Steppe. He sat down in Ronnie's library chair, and
  taking a bundle of documents from his inside pocket, he threw them on the
  table. "Here are the papers you want, Merville&mdash;and by the way&mdash;"
  He turned in his chair and glowered at Ronnie. "Do you remember we pooled the
  Midwell Traction Shares, Morelle?" His voice was ominous.</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;yes&mdash;of course," said Ronnie, quaking.</p>

  <p>"We undertook to hold the stock until we mutually agreed as to the moment
  we should unload, huh?" Steppe demanded deliberately. Ronald made an
  ineffectual attempt to appear unconcerned. "And we undertook not to part with
  a share until the stock reached forty-three. Do you remember, huh?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Ronnie, and the big man's fist crashed down on the table.</p>

  <p>"You're sure you remember?" he shouted "You sold at thirty-five. Do that
  again, and d'ye know what I'll do?"</p>

  <p>"I'm sure Ronald wouldn't&mdash;" began Merville, but was silenced.</p>

  <p>"You shut up! It didn't matter so much that Traction jumped. But you broke
  faith with me, you rat!"</p>

  <p>"Don't lose your temper, Steppe," said the other sulkily, "it was a
  mistake, I tell you. My broker sold without authority."</p>

  <p>"Whilst we are on the subject of the Traction Shares, I want to ask about
  the statement I filed in regard to the assets of the company. Was it right?"
  For a week the doctor had been trying to put this question. "Of we three, I'm
  the only director&mdash;you're not in it and Ronnie isn't in it, if there is
  anything wrong, I should be the goat?"</p>

  <p>Steppe's voice was milder. Here was a topic to be avoided. "Huh! You're
  all right. What are you frightened about?"</p>

  <p>"I'm not frightened, but you had the draft?"</p>

  <p>"It is in the safe," said Steppe, with some satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"Steppe, how do we stand there?" asked the doctor urgently. "I know
  Moropulos was doing work for you of a sort. What was his position and
  Sault's? Is that the safe which Sault made? He told me about it some time
  ago."</p>

  <p>Steppe turned his head again in Ronald's direction. "You went to the
  trial! You saw him! You've seen him before&mdash;what do you think of
  him&mdash;clever, huh?"</p>

  <p>"Well I don't know&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Of course, he's clever, you fool," said the other contemptuously. "If you
  had his brains and his principles you'd be a big man. Remember that&mdash;a
  big man."</p>

  <p>"I am attending the execution," said Ronnie, "the under-Sheriff is
  admitting three Press reporters, and I am to be one of them."</p>

  <p>Steppe eyed him gloomily, groping after the mind of the man who could fear
  him, yet he did not fear to see a man done to death. "I'll tell you men all
  about Moropulos and Sault because you're all tarred with the same brush. This
  is the big pull of Sault. A pull he's never used. Moropulos and I had
  business together. He was on one side of a wall called 'Law', huh. I was on
  the other. The comfortable side. And he used to hand things over. That put me
  a bit on his side. There were letters and certain other documents which we
  had to keep, yet were dangerous to keep. But you might always want 'em. I was
  scared over some share that&mdash;well, I oughtn't have had them. And that's
  how Sault came to make the Destroying Angel, that's a good name! I christened
  it. There was a combination lock, the word being known only to Moropulos,
  Sault, and myself. If you used the wrong combination&mdash;any combination
  but the right one, the acids are released and the contents of the safe are
  destroyed. If you try to cut through the sides&mdash;the water runs out, down
  drops a plunger with the same result. When Moropulos was killed I tried to
  get at it, but the police were there before me. There was a typewritten note
  pasted on the top of the safe, telling exactly what would happen if they
  monkeyed with it. They haven't dared to touch it. It's in the Black Museum
  today with enough inside to send me&mdash;well, a hell of a long way."</p>

  <p>"Suppose this man tells?" asked Merville fearfully.</p>

  <p>"He won't tell. That kind of a man doesn't squeal. If it had been Ronald
  Morelle, I'd have been on my way to South America by now. A word from Sault
  and I'm&mdash;" he snapped his fingers "but do you think it worries me? I can
  sleep and go about my work without a second's fear. That's the kind of man I
  am. No nerves&mdash;look at my hand." He thrust out his heavy paw stiffly
  "Steady as a rock, huh? Good boy, Sault!"</p>

  <p>"I met him once&mdash;" began Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"I've met him more than once," said the grim Steppe. "A man with strange
  compelling eyes, the only fellow that ever frightened me!" He looked at
  Ronald curiously. "It is unbelievable that a white-livered devil like you can
  see him die. It would make me sick. And yet you, whose nerves ought to be
  rags considering the filthy life you live, can stand calmly by&mdash;ugh! I
  don't know how you can do it. To see a man's soul go out!"</p>

  <p>Ronnie laughed quickly.</p>

  <p>"Sault's rather keen on his soul. Boyle, the Governor, says he recited
  Henley's poem on his way to the cells."</p>

  <p>But Steppe did not laugh.</p>

  <p>"Soul? H'm. He made me believe in something... soul or spirit or...or
  something. He dominated me. Do you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I do. A transient X that only abides in the body at: he will of its
  host."</p>

  <p>Ronnie groaned wearily. "Oh God, are you going to lecture?" he asked, and
  Jan Steppe roared at him.</p>

  <p>"Shut up! Go on, Merville. Do you mean that it leaves the body before...
  death?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," said Merville thoughtfully. "I've often stood by the side of
  a patient desperately sick, and suddenly felt in my body his despair and
  weakness, and seen him brighten and flush with my strength."</p>

  <p>"Really?" Steppe's voice was intense. "Do you mean that your spirits have
  exchanged themselves?"</p>

  <p>Dr. Merville flicked the ash of his cigar into the fireplace. "Call it
  'spirit', 'soul', 'X', anything you like&mdash;call it individuality. There
  has been a momentary exchange."</p>

  <p>"How do you explain it?"</p>

  <p>"Science doesn't explain everything," said Merville. "Science accepts a
  whole lot of what we call 'incommensurables'."</p>

  <p>"H'm." Steppe pushed away the papers and rose. "H'm. that'll do for the
  night. Keep those papers, you fellows, and digest them. You going out,
  Morelle?"</p>

  <p>"No, would you like me to go anywhere with you?" Ronnie was eager to
  serve.</p>

  <p>"No"&mdash;shortly. "Merville, I'm dining with you tomorrow, and I hope
  Beryl won't have a headache this time. I've got a box at the Pantheon."</p>

  <p>The doctor was obviously embarrassed. "She&mdash;well, she isn't very
  bright just now."</p>

  <p>"Let her be bright enough to come to dinner to-morrow night," said
  Steppe.</p>

  <p>The door banged and Ronnie drew a long breath. "Thank God," he said
  piously.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap41"
     name="chap41">CHAPTER XLI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Francois went after them, not unhappy to detach himself from
  the tense and threatening atmosphere, his resentment against his employer
  somewhat modified when he reached home, by a letter from his visiting brother
  announcing the postponement of his departure from Switzerland.</p>

  <p>Therefore it was Ronnie who answered the sharp ring of the bell. When he
  saw the girl his jaw dropped. "Really, Beryl! You place me in a most awkward
  position. Whatever made you come? Steppe was here...suppose he came back? Why
  didn't you bring somebody with you?" He was flustered and scared. Steppe
  might return at any moment.</p>

  <p>"I'm sorry I have outraged the proprieties," said Beryl, with a little
  smile. "Did that child from the druggist's have a chaperon?"</p>

  <p>"Eh?" Ronnie was startled.</p>

  <p>"I saw her coming in and I saw her go out. I've been waiting for an
  opportunity of seeing you. She's pretty, but oh, Ronald she's only a
  baby!"</p>

  <p>Ronnie made a quick recovery from his surprise. If she had seen Evie, she
  had also seen Steppe and must be sure that he had gone. She would probably
  know from her father what were their plans for the night. "I give you my word
  of honour, Beryl," said he earnestly "that she merely came to see me about
  her sister&mdash;you know her, Christina I think she is called. Evie is very
  anxious that I should help send her abroad. As far as Evie is concerned, you
  can put your mind at rest. I give you my solemn word of honour that I have
  never as much as held her hand."</p>

  <p>She knew he was lying, but tonight of all nights she must accept his word.
  She was in a fever: it was almost painful to hold fast to the last shreds of
  her failing reserve. "Ronald." Her voice was tremulous and he braced himself
  for a scene. "You don't want me to marry Steppe?" So that was it. And he had
  thought she had accepted the position so admirably. "Ronald, you know it
  would be&mdash;death to me...worse than death to me. Can't you...can't you
  use your imagination?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes avoided his: that alone helped to restore a little of his poise.
  She had come as a suppliant, and would not be difficult to handle. The old
  Beryl, polished, cynical, mistress of herself and her emotions, might have
  beaten him down; induced God knows what extravagant promises. "I don't want
  to talk about what has happened. I am not reproaching you or appealing to any
  sense of duty, but&mdash;" She stood there, her eyes downcast, twisting her
  gloves into tight spirals. He said nothing, holding his arguments in reserve
  against her exhaustion. "You make it hard, awfully hard for me, Ronnie. You
  do know...Steppe wants to marry me?" He nodded. "Do you realize what that
  means...to me, Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>"He's not a bad fellow," protested Ronnie. "Really, Beryl I never dreamt
  you were going to take this line. Is it decent?"</p>

  <p>"He's...he's awful, Ronnie; you know he's awful. He's hideous, he's just
  animal all through. Animal with reasoning powers, gross...horrible. You liked
  me, Ronnie," she was pleading now. "Why...why don't you marry me? I love
  you&mdash;I must have loved you. I could learn to respect you; so easily.
  They say you're rotten but you're of my own kind. Ronnie, don't you know what
  it means to me to say this&mdash;don't you know?"</p>

  <p>She was gripping his arm with an intensity which made him wince.
  Hysteria...suppose Steppe did come back? He went moist at the thought.
  "Ronnie, why don't you?" she breathed. "It would save me. It would save
  father, too. He would accept the accomplished fact, and be relieved. Ronnie,
  it would save my soul and my body. I'd serve you as dutifully as any woman
  ever served a man. I would, Ronnie. I'd be...I'd be as light as the lightest
  women you know&mdash;don't you realize what I am saying?..."</p>

  <p>"My dear girl," he said, thoroughly alarmed. "I couldn't oppose Steppe,
  he's a good fellow, really he is. I'm sure you'd be happy. I'm awfully fond
  of you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then take me away! I'll go with you tonight...now, now! Take me, Ronnie,
  I'll go...now...this very minute, and I'll bless you. He wouldn't want me
  then. I know him."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I wish you wouldn't talk such rot," he quavered.</p>

  <p>"Take me," she urged desperately. "There is a train tonight for Ostend,
  take me. Take me, Ronald, I could love you...I could love you in
  gratitude...save me from this gross man."</p>

  <p>Ronnie, in a flurry of fear, pushed her away. "You don't know what you're
  talking about," he said shrilly. "Steppe would kill me...Beryl, I'm fond of
  you, but I can't cross Steppe."</p>

  <p>That was the end. Her last throw in the game. Ronnie was Ronnie. That was
  all. She was very calm now; but for her pallor and the uncontrollable tremor
  of her hands, her old self. That she had humiliated herself did not bring her
  a moment's regret. Stampeded...she had been stampeded by sheer physical fear.
  "I think I'll go," she said, taking up her furs. "You need not get me a
  cab&mdash;this time. And Moropulos cannot photograph me. I might have forced
  you to do what I wished, playing on your fears. I couldn't do that. What a
  coward...but I won't reproach you, Ronnie."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand and he held it reluctantly. This time he took no
  risks. He gave her a minute's start, and then he, too, went out. Madame
  Ritti's was ever a place of refuge to Ronnie when his nerves were
  jangled.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap42"
     name="chap42">CHAPTER XLII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">How quickly the days flew past! Beryl had a letter from Sir
  John Maxton one Saturday.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I have seen our friend for the third time since the
  sentence, and you know that on Tuesday he 'goes the way'&mdash;those are his
  own words. What can I tell you of him, Beryl, that you do not know? He has
  become one of my dearest friends. How strange that seems, written! Yet it is
  true, and when he asked me if I would come and see him on the morning, I
  agreed. In France it is the custom of the defending advocate to be
  present&mdash;I am glad it is not necessary in England. Yet I shall go and I
  pray that I may be as fearless as he.</p>

  <p class="letter">"He spoke of you yesterday and of 'Christina'&mdash;that is
  Miss Colebrook, isn't it? But so cheerfully!</p>

  <p class="letter">"The officers of the prison are fond of him, and even the
  chief warder, a hard-bitten Guardsman, who was the principal flogger at
  Pentonville for many years, speaks of him affectionately. Completely
  untroubled&mdash;that is how I should describe Ambrose. He has been allowed
  the privilege of a reader, one of the warders, an educated man who acts as
  librarian to the prison. He has chosen Gibbon's 'Roman Empire', and on my
  suggestion he is concentrating on the chapters dealing with the creation of
  the Byzantine Empire. The story of Belesarius fascinates him; Belesarius is a
  character after his own heart, as I knew would be the case. The chaplain sees
  him frequently, and Ambrose is politely attentive. It is rather like a
  village schoolmaster instructing Newton in astronomy. Ambrose is so far
  advanced that the good man's efforts to bring him to an understanding is just
  a little pathetic. "I can't understand Mr. Pinley's God', he said to me when
  I called immediately after the clergyman's visit. "He is a slave's conception
  of a super-master&mdash;the superstition of a fighting tribe." Ambrose holds
  to his own faith, which is comprehended in Henley's poem 'Out of the dark
  which covers me'. He recites this continuously.</p>

  <p class="letter">"I said that he spoke of you and Christina. I asked him if
  he would like to see you both, knowing that if he did, you would face the
  ordeal. But he said that it was unnecessary."</p>

  <p>On the Monday evening Christina came to the house. They did not sleep that
  night. "I suppose we're neurotic, but I never felt saner," said Beryl, "or
  more peacefully-minded. And yet if it were somebody I did not know, some
  servant with whom I was just on nodding terms, I should be a bundle of
  nerves. And it is Ambrose! Christina, are we just keyed up, overstrained...
  shall we collapse? I have wondered."</p>

  <p>"I shall not break," said Christina. "I have been worrying about you..."
  Yet it was Christina on whom the chimes of the little French clock on the
  mantelpiece fell like the knell of doom. "...Six...seven...eight...nine!"
  counted Beryl, tense, exalted.</p>

  <p>It was over. Ambrose Sault had gone the way.</p>

  <p>"Good-bye, Ambrose!" Christina's voice was a wail.</p>

  <p>Before Beryl could reach her, she had slipped to the floor in a dead
  faint.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap43"
     name="chap43">CHAPTER XLIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RONALD MORELLE came down the carpeted stairs of the House of
  Shame, and there was a half smile on his lips, as though the echoes of
  laughter were still vibrating through this silent mansion and he must
  respond. The hall was in darkness except for the light admitted by a
  semicircular transom. Turning his head, he saw that the door of the saloon
  was ajar, and he hesitated. He had never seen the saloon by daylight, only at
  night, when the soft lights were burning and the silver chandelier glowed
  with tiny yellow globes. He pushed open the door. The darkness here had been
  relieved by somebody who had opened one window and unshuttered two others.
  The room was in disorder, chairs remained where the sitters had left them,
  and the cold grey light of morning looked upon tarnished gilding and faded
  damask, and the tawdry litter of the night before. Merciless, pitiless,
  contemptuous was the sneer of the clean dawn.</p>

  <p>Ronald's smile deepened. And then he caught a reflection of himself in one
  of the long mirrors. He looked pale and drawn. He shivered. Not because the
  mirror gave back the illusion of a sick man&mdash;he knew well enough he was
  healthy&mdash;but because he glimpsed the something in his eyes, the leering
  devil that sat behind the levers and turned the switches of desire.</p>

  <p>A car was waiting for him at the end of the slumbering street&mdash;Madame
  did not like cars at the door in the early hours of the morning&mdash;and he
  stepped in, wrapping his coat about him. The sun had not yet risen and
  Wechester was a two hours' run with a clear road. Sault was in Wechester Gaol
  awaiting the dread hour, and from somewhere in Lancashire a gaunt-faced
  barber, who had marked in his diary the date of an engagement, had taken
  train to Ronald's destination, carrying with him the supple straps that would
  bind the wrists of the living and be slipped from the wrists of the dead.</p>

  <p>The clear sky gave promises of a perfect winter day, but the morning air
  was cold. He pulled up the windows of the car and wished he had bought a
  newspaper or book to while away the time. In two hours the soul of Ambrose
  Sault...The soul! What was the soul? Was it Driesh's "Entelechy'; that
  'innermost secret' of animation? Was there substance of the soul? Was it
  material? A flame, Merville had once called it, a flame from a common fire.
  Could the flame leap at will from a man's body and leave him...what? A
  lunatic, a madman, a beast without reason? Ronald shrugged away the
  speculation, but the scholar in him was uneasy, and insensibly he came back
  to the problem.</p>

  <p>The promises of fair weather were belied as the car drew to Wechester. A
  mist, thin and white, lay like a blanket on the streets, and Ronald's car
  'hawked' its way into the still thicker mist which lay all Wechester Common.
  The car drew up at the prison gates, and he looked at his watch. It wanted a
  quarter of nine.</p>

  <p>Ronnie saw a thin man, thinly clad, walking up and down outside. His hair
  was long and fell over his coat collar, his nose was red with the cold, and
  now and again he stopped to stamp his feet. Ronnie wondered who he was.</p>

  <p>A wicket opened at his ring, and he showed his authority through the bars
  before, with a clang and a clatter of turning locks and the thud of many
  bolts, the door swung open and he found himself in a square stone room
  furnished with a desk, a high stool and one chair.</p>

  <p>The warder took his authority and read it, made an entry in the book, and
  rang a bell. It was a cheerless room, in spite of the fire, thought Ronald.
  Three sets of handcuffs garlanded above the chimney-piece; a suggestive
  truncheon lay on brackets near the warder's desk and within reach of his
  hand, and a framed copy of Prison Regulations only served to emphasise the
  bareness of the remaining wall.</p>

  <p>Again the clatter and clink of the lock and another warder came in.</p>

  <p>"Take this gentleman to the Governor's room," said the door-keeper. Ronald
  was amused because the second warder put his hand on his arm as though he
  were a prisoner, and did not remove his hand even when he was unlocking the
  innumerable gates, doors, and grilles which stood between liberty and the
  prisoners.</p>

  <p>The Governor's room was scarcely more cheerful than the gatekeeper's
  lodge. There was a desk piled with papers, a worn leather armchair and an
  office smell which was agreeable and human. The Governor shook hands with the
  visitor, whom he had met before, and Ronald nodded to the two other pressmen
  who were waiting. Then they took him out into the yard. The warder led the
  way, and the doctor followed, then came the Governor, and last, save for the
  warder who brought up the rear, went Ronald Morelle, without a single tremor
  of heart to the house of doom.</p>

  <p>To a great glass-roofed hall with tier upon tier of galleries and yellow
  cell doors, and near at hand&mdash;that which was nearest to them as they
  came in&mdash;one cell door ajar. Outside three blankets neatly folded were
  stacked one on each other. They were the blankets in which the condemned man
  had slept. Here was a wait. A nerve-racking wait to those with nerves. Ronald
  had none. A small door opened into the yard and he strolled through it and
  found himself in a small black courtyard. Twenty paces away was a little
  building which looked like a tool-house. There were two grey-black sliding
  doors and these were open. All he could see was a plain, clean interior with
  a scrubbed floor, and a yellow rope that hung from somewhere in the roof. He
  was joined by an officer whom he took to be the chief warder.</p>

  <p>Physically Ronald was a coward. He admitted as much to himself. He feared
  pain, he shrank from danger. In his questionable business transactions he
  guarded himself in every way from unpleasant consequences, employing two
  lawyers who checked one another's conclusions.</p>

  <p>Yet he could watch the pain of others and never turn a hair. He had
  witnessed capital operations and had found stimulus in the experience which
  the hospital theatre brings to the enthusiastic scientist. He had seen death
  administered by the law in England, America, and France. Once he stood by the
  side of a guillotine in a little northern town of France and watched three
  shrieking men dragged to 'the widow', and was the least affected of the
  spectators, until the blood of one splashed his hand. And then it was only
  disgust he felt. He himself was incapable of violent action. He might torture
  the helpless, but he would have to be sure they were helpless.</p>

  <p>"Chilly this morning, sir," said the chief warder conversationally, and
  said that he did not know what was happening to the weather nowadays. "It
  this the first time you've been inside?"</p>

  <p>"In a prison? Oh, lord, no," said Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" The warder jerked his hand towards the door. "On this kind of
  job?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, twice before."</p>

  <p>The officer looked glum. "Not very pleasant. It upsets all the routine of
  the establishment. Can't get the men out for exercise till after it is over.
  They sit in their cells and brood&mdash;we always have a lot of trouble
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>"How is he going to take it?" asked Ronald.</p>

  <p>"Who, the prisoner?" Mr. Marsden smiled. "Oh, he's going to take it all
  right. They never give any trouble&mdash;and he&mdash;he'll go laughing, you
  mark my words. We like him, here&mdash;that's a funny thing to say, isn't it?
  But I assure you, I've had to take three men off observation duty&mdash;they
  are the warders who sit in the cell with him&mdash;they got so upset. It is a
  fact. Old fellows who'd been in the prison service for years. Here's the
  deputy."</p>

  <p>A tall man in a trench coat had come through the grille. "Good morning,
  Morelle, have you see the Governor?" Ronnie nodded. "He won't be here for
  the&mdash;er&mdash;event," said Major Boyle. "Between ourselves, he said he
  couldn't stand it. An extraordinary thing. Have you seen Sir John
  Maxton?"</p>

  <p>"No, is he here?" asked Ronnie, interested.</p>

  <p>"He's in the cell with the man&mdash;there he is."</p>

  <p>Sir John's face was grey; he seemed to have shrunken. He had not expected
  to see Ronnie, but he made no comment on his presence. "Good morning, Boyle.
  Good morning, Ronnie. I have just said goodbye to him."</p>

  <p>"Aren't you staying?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;he understands," said Sir John briefly. Then he seemed to be
  conscious of Ronnie's presence. The deputy had gone back to the hall.
  "Ronnie, how could you come here this morning&mdash;and meet the eyes of this
  man so soon to face God?" he asked in a hushed voice.</p>

  <p>Ronnie's lips curled. "I suppose you feel in your heart that it is a great
  injustice, that your noble-minded murderer should go to a shameful death,
  whilst a leprous but respectable member of society like myself walks free
  through that gate!"</p>

  <p>"I would wish no man this morning's agony," said the other.</p>

  <p>"Suppose you were God..."</p>

  <p>"Ronnie, have you no decency!"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes&mdash;but suppose you were; would you transfer the soul of the
  individuality of us two, Ambrose Sault and Ronnie Morelle?"</p>

  <p>"God forgive me, I would, for you are altogether beastly!"</p>

  <p>Ronnie laughed again. There was the sound of a slamming door and a man
  came into the yard, squat, unshaven, a little nervous. A derby hat was on the
  back of his head, and in his hands, clasped behind him, was a leathern strap.
  "There's the hangman," said Ronnie. "Ask him what he thinks of murderers'
  souls! What is death, Sir John? Look at those tablets on the wall&mdash;just
  a few initials. Yet they sleep as soundly as the great in the Abbey under
  their splendid monuments. Though they were hanged by the neck until they were
  dead. You would like God to change us. One of those changes which Merville
  talked about the other night&mdash;it was a pity you weren't there."</p>

  <p>Sir John said nothing; he walked to the grille and a warder unlocked the
  steel door. For a second he stood and then, as the hangman went into the
  hall, he passed out through the opened gate.</p>

  <p>Presently two warders came from the hall and then another: two walking
  solemnly in slow step, and then a bound man; a great rugged figure who
  overshadowed the clergyman by his side. The drone of the burial service came
  to Ronald Morelle, and he took off his hat.</p>

  <p>Sault was reciting something. His powerful voice drowned the thin voice of
  the minister:</p>

  <p>"It matters not how straight the Gate..."</p>

  <p>He paced in time to the metre.</p>

  <p>"How charged with punishment the scroll,</p>

  <p>I am the master of my fate..."</p>

  <p>Nearer, and yet more near, and then their eyes met!</p>

  <p>The debonair worldling, silk hat in hand, his hair brushed and pomaded,
  his immaculate cravat set faultlessly&mdash;and the other! That big
  grey-faced man with the mane of hair, his rough clothes and his collarless
  shirt!</p>

  <p>They looked at one another for a fraction of a second, eye to eye, and
  Ronald felt something was drawing at him, tugging at his very heartstrings.
  The eyes of the man were luminous, appealing, terrible. And then with a crash
  the world stood still&mdash;all animate creation was frozen stiff, petrified,
  motionless, and Ronald swayed for a moment.</p>

  <p>Then a firm hand on his arm pushed him forward. He stepped forth
  mechanically. He had a curious, almost painful feeling of restriction. And
  then he realized, with a half&mdash;sob, that his hands were bound behind
  him, strapped so tightly that they were swollen and tingling, and warders
  were holding his arms. He tried to speak, but no sound came, and looking up
  he saw...!</p>

  <p>Once more he was looking into eyes, but they were the eyes of himself!
  Ronald Morelle was standing watching him with sorrow and pity. Ronald Morelle
  was watching himself! And then the urgent hand pressed him forward, and he
  paced mechanically.</p>

  <p>"...I know that my Redeemer liveth..."</p>

  <p>The little clergyman was walking by his side, reading tremulously. Ronald
  looked down at himself, his shoe was hurting him, somebody had left a nail
  there, and he cursed Francois; but those were not his shoes he was looking
  at, they were great rough boots, and his trousers were old and frayed, and
  there was a shiny patch on his knee.</p>

  <p>"...Man that is born of a woman hath but little time upon this earth, and
  that time is filled with misery..."</p>

  <p>He walked like one in a dream into the shed and felt the trap sag under
  him. The executioner&mdash;it must be the executioner he
  thought&mdash;stooped and strapped his legs tightly. Ronald wondered what
  would happen. It was an absurd mistake, of course, rather amusing in a way...
  Francois had not been paid his monthly salary, and Francois was meeting his
  brother today from Interlaken, Interlaken in the Oberland.</p>

  <p>The man put a cloth over his face&mdash;it was linen, unbleached and
  pungent. When the executioner passed the elastic loops behind his ears, he
  released one too quickly and it stung. "It is not me, it is not me," said
  Ronald numbly, "it is the body of Ambrose Sault&mdash;the gross body of
  Ambrose Sault. I'm standing outside watching! It is Sault who is being
  hanged&mdash;Sault! I am Morelle...Morelle of Balliol...Major Boyle," he
  screamed aloud. "Major Boyle...you know me...I am Morelle..."</p>

  <p>Yet his body was huge&mdash;he felt its grossness, its size, the strength
  of the corded muscles of the arm; the roaring fury of the life which surged
  within him. He heard a squeak&mdash;the lever was being pulled...!</p>

  <p>With a crash the trap gave way and the body of Ambrose Sault swung for a
  second and was dead, but it was the soul of Ronald Morelle that went forth to
  the eternal spaces of infinity.</p>

  <p>The prison clock struck nine.</p>

  <h2><a id="book4"
     name="book4">BOOK THE FOURTH</a></h2>

  <h2><a id="chap44"
     name="chap44">CHAPTER XLIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">A WARDER came round the edge of the pit with his arms
  extended as the executioner, reaching out his hand, steadied the quivering
  rope. The prison doctor looked down the pit. "He's all right," he said
  vaguely. The tremulous clergyman was the last to go backing out of the death
  chamber he watched the warders close and lock the doors. The body of Ronald
  Morelle settled its top hat firmly on its shapely head and looked down at the
  little parson. There were tears in that good man's eyes. "He was not bad, he
  was not bad," he murmured shakily. "I wish he had repented the murder."</p>

  <p>"There was nothing to repent," said Ronald quietly, "if repentance were
  possible the murder was unnecessary." His voice was strangely deep and rich.
  Hearing himself, he wondered. The minister looked up at him in surprise. "He
  said exactly the same thing to me this morning," he said, "and in almost
  identical words; the poor fellow expressed his thoughts in language which
  seemed unnatural, remembering his illiteracy."</p>

  <p>"Poor soul," said Ronnie thoughtfully. "Poor lonely, lonely soul!"</p>

  <p>He took the minister's arm in his and they walked back to the prison hall.
  There was a surplice to be shed, devotional books to be packed in a little
  black bag.</p>

  <p>The condemned cell was being turned out by two men in convict's garb. One
  was using a broom, sweeping with long leisurely strokes, and his face had a
  suggestion of sadness. The other was carrying out the remainder of the
  bedding and washing the utensils which the dead man had used. All this Ronald
  noticed with a curiously detached interest.</p>

  <p>Shepherded back again to the Governor's office, there was a form to be
  signed, testifying that he had witnessed the execution which had been carried
  out in a proper and decorous manner. Ronald took the pen and hesitated a
  second before he signed. The appearance of his signature on paper interested
  him&mdash;it was unfamiliar.</p>

  <p>"You've seen these executions before, Mr. Morelle?" said the under
  sheriff.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," said Ronald quietly. "I do not think I shall come again. The
  waste of it, the malice of it!"</p>

  <p>"An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth," said the under-sheriff
  gruffly, and Ronald smiled sadly.</p>

  <p>"The Old Testament is excellent as literature, but in parts diabolical as
  a code of morals," he said, and went through the porter's lodge to the
  world.</p>

  <p>There was a small crowd, some twenty or thirty people, grouped at a
  distance from the gate. Their interest was concentrated upon the kneeling
  figure that confronted Ronnie as he walked out of the lodge. "He comes here
  very time we have a hanging," said the gate-man in Ronnie's ear. It was the
  thin man in the threadbare coat; he knelt bare-headed, his blue hands
  clasped, his voice hoarse with a cold.</p>

  <p>"...let him be the child of Thy mercies...pardon we beseech Thee, O Lord
  our God, this our brother who comes before Thy Seat of Judgement..."</p>

  <p>Ronnie listened to the husky voice. Presently, and with a final
  supplication, the man got up and dusted his knees.</p>

  <p>"For whom are you praying?" asked Ronnie gently.</p>

  <p>"For Ambrose Sault, brother," answered the man.</p>

  <p>"For Ambrose Sault?" repeated Ronnie absently. "That is very sweet." He
  looked thoughtfully at the man, and then walked away. Following the Common
  road that would have taken him to Wechester, he heard a car coming behind
  him, and presently the, glittering bonnet moved past him and stopped.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, Sir." Ronnie looked round. He did not know the chauffeur who
  was touching his cap. And yet he had seen his face. "I thought you may have
  missed the car&mdash;I had to park away from the prison."</p>

  <p>Of course! He breathed a heavy sigh as the problem was solved. It was his
  own car and the chauffeur's name was Parker. "I haven't the slightest idea
  where I was going," he laughed. "You look cold, Parker. We had better stop in
  Wechester and get breakfast."</p>

  <p>Parker could only gape. "Yes, sir," he stammered, "but don't worry about
  me, sir. I shall be all right."</p>

  <p>Ronnie was puzzling again. Then he had it. The Red Lion! There was an inn
  just outside of Wechester; he had stopped there before. Apparently Parker
  expected some such directions.</p>

  <p>They left the mists behind them at Wechester and came to the Red Lion. A
  pretty girl waitress at the hotel saw Ronnie and tossed her head. Her manner
  was cold. He couldn't remember...That was the oddness of it. He had lost some
  of his memories. They were completely blotted out from his mind. Why was this
  pretty girl so cross?</p>

  <p>He was to learn. Finishing his breakfast he strolled out into the big yard
  where the car was garaged. The chauffeur was at his breakfast.</p>

  <p>"Hi! I want to have a talk with you!"</p>

  <p>A man was approaching. He looked like a groom, wearing gaiters as he did,
  and he was in his shirt-sleeves. Moreover, his style and appearance were
  hostile. "You're the man who was staying here for the trial!" challenged the
  newcomer.</p>

  <p>"Was I?...I suppose so."</p>

  <p>"Was you?" sneered the groom savagely. "Yes, you was! Staying here with a
  young woman, and you went and interfered with my young woman. Yes,
  interfered...said things to her."</p>

  <p>His voice went up the scale until he was shouting. There was a stir of
  feet, and men and women came to the doors of outhouses and kitchens.</p>

  <p>"Doesn't it strike you that you are making the young lady feel very
  uncomfortable...if she is here?" said Ronnie seriously. "You are shouting
  what should be whispered...no, no, Parker, please do not interfere."</p>

  <p>"I'll tell you what does strike me," bellowed the groom, rolling up his
  sleeves, "that I'm going to give you the damnedest lacing you ever had...put
  'em up!"</p>

  <p>He lunged forward, but his blow did not get home. A hand gripped him by
  one shoulder and swung him round...crash! He fell against a stable door.
  Happily there was a wall for Parker to lean against. He was open-mouthed...
  incredulous. Phew! Morelle, who was ready to drop from terror at a threat,
  was standing hands on hips, surveying the bewildered fire-eater.</p>

  <p>"I'm extremely sorry you made me do that," he said almost apologetically,
  "but you really must not shout...especially about unpleasant things. If I...
  if I behaved disgracefully to the lady, I am sorry."</p>

  <p>All this in a voice that did not reach beyond his adversary. Parker heard
  the low music of it and scratched his head. Morelle's voice had changed.</p>

  <p>Later, when Ronnie was preparing to depart, Parker ventured to offer his
  felicitations. "I never saw a man go through it like that fellow
  did&mdash;and they think something of him as a fighter in these parts."</p>

  <p>"It was nothing," said Ronnie hastily, "a trick...I learnt it in New
  Caledonia from a Japanese who was in the same prison."</p>

  <p>Parker blinked. "Yes, sir," he said, and then Ronnie laughed.</p>

  <p>"What on earth am I talking about? I think we will go home, Parker."</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," said Parker, breathing hard. He had never seen his master
  drunk before, and drunk he undoubtedly was, for not only had he fought, but
  he was civil. Parker hoped he would keep drunk.</p>

  <p>In his pocket Ronnie found a gold cigarette-case, a pocket-book, a watch
  and chain, a small bill-case and a gold pencil. In his trousers pocket were a
  few silver coins and some keys. He found them literally; the seat of the car
  was strewn with his discoveries.</p>

  <p>Whose were they? The cigarette-case was inscribed: "To Ronnie, from
  Beryl'. Ronnie...Beryl? Of course they were his own properties. He chuckled
  gleefully at his amusing lapse...</p>

  <p>"No, I shan't want you again, Parker...how do I get into touch with you
  if...? Yes, of course, I 'phone you at the garage. Good morning."</p>

  <p>"Good morning." Parker was too dazed to return the politeness.</p>

  <p>Ronnie shook his head smilingly when the porter opened the gate of the
  automatic elevator. He would walk, he said, and went up the stairs two at a
  time. This exercise tired him slightly. And usually he felt so strong,
  nothing tired him. That day he lifted Moropulos and flung him on his bed.
  Moropulos had hated him ever since...</p>

  <h2><a id="chap45"
     name="chap45">CHAPTER XLV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WHAT am I thinking about?" said Ronnie Morelle aloud.</p>

  <p>Francois was not in. Ronnie had expected him to be there and yet would
  have been surprised had he seen him. There was a letter lying on the table.
  Ronnie saw it when he entered the room. He did not look at it again for some
  time. Strolling aimlessly round the library, hands in pockets, he stopped
  before the Anthony over the mantelpiece&mdash;ugly and a little unpleasant.
  He made a little grimace of disgust. Out of the tail of his eye he saw the
  letter.</p>

  <p>Why did people write to him? he wondered, troubled. They knew that he
  couldn't read, he made no secret of his ignorance. Yet picking up the
  envelope, he read his own name and was unaware of his inconsistency. The
  letter was from Francois. His brother had arrived. He had gone to the station
  to meet him and would return instantly. Would monsieur excuse? It was
  unlikely that monsieur would return before him, but if he did, would he be
  pleased to excuse? He wrote 'excuse' three times and in three different ways,
  and they were all wrong. Ronald laughed softly. Poor Francois! Poor...</p>

  <p>His face became grave, and slowly his eyes went back to the Anthony, that
  lewd painting. Poor soul! His eyes filled with tears. They rolled with the
  curious leisure of tears down his face, and dropped on the grey suede
  waistcoat.</p>

  <p>Poor soul! Poor, weak, undeveloped soul!</p>

  <p>Ronnie was sitting on the chesterfield to read the letter. Francois,
  coming in hurriedly, saw a man crying into the crook of his arm and stood
  petrified. "M'sieur!"</p>

  <p>Ronnie looked up. His eyes were swollen, his smooth skin blotchily red in
  patches.</p>

  <p>"Hello, Francois. I'm being stupid. Get me a glass of water, please."</p>

  <p>His hand was shaking so that he could hardly hold the glass to his
  chattering teeth.</p>

  <p>Francois watched and marvelled.</p>

  <p>"Did you meet your brother?" Ronnie was drying his eyes and smiling
  faintly at the valet's grotesque dismay.</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'sieur. I hope that m'sieur was not inconvenienced."</p>

  <p>Ronnie shook his head. "No...make me something. Coffee or tea anything.
  Have you brought your brother here?"</p>

  <p>"No, no, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>"You will want to see him, Francois. You may take the rest of the day
  off."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, m'sieur," said Francois, recovering himself. His services were
  seldom dispensed with until later in the day. Possibly his employer had
  excellent reason.</p>

  <p>Ronnie did not hear the bell ring, and until he caught the click of the
  lock and the sound of voices in the lobby he had no idea that he had a
  caller.</p>

  <p>Francois came in alone, secretive, low-voiced.</p>

  <p>"It is Mr. East, m'sieur. Yesterday was the day, but m'sieur forgot," he
  said mysteriously.</p>

  <p>"Yesterday was&mdash;what day?" Ronnie rubbed his chin with a knuckle. How
  stupid of him to forget! "Ask him to come in, please."</p>

  <p>Francois hesitated, but went, returning with a thin young man whose face
  seemed all angles and bosses. He was well-dressed, a little too well-dressed.
  His plastered hair was parted, and one fringe curled like a wave of black ink
  that had been petrified just as it was in the act of breaking on the yellow
  beach of his forehead. He had a way of holding back his head so that he
  looked down his nose in whatever direction his gaze was turned.</p>

  <p>"Morning," he said coldly, and cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"Good morning?" Ronnie's tone was polite but inquisitive.</p>

  <p>"I called yesterday but nobody was in," said Mr. East, gently stern.</p>

  <p>"Why did you call at all?" asked Ronnie.</p>

  <p>A look of amazement toning to righteous anger from Mr. East. "Why did I
  call at all?" he repeated. "To give you a chance of actin' the man; to
  collect what was due to a poor girl that was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"To commit blackmail, in fact?" smiled Ronnie. He was quick to smile
  today.</p>

  <p>"Eh?"</p>

  <p>"I remember...I have given you money every week, ostensibly for your
  sister. Tell her to come and see me."</p>

  <p>"What! Her come to see you? In this, what I might term, den of iniquity?
  No! I don't allow you to see the poor girl. And as for blackmail, didn't you,
  of your own free will, offer to pay?"</p>

  <p>Mr. East had grown red in the face; he was indignant, hurt, and soon would
  be pugnacious.</p>

  <p>Ronnie got to his feet, and the listening Francois heard the door open.
  "Get out, please," said Ronnie pleasantly. "I don't wish to hurt you...but
  get out."</p>

  <p>The man was speechless. "I am going to a lawyer," he blustered. "I won't
  soil my hands with you."</p>

  <p>"I think you are very wise," said Ronnie, and closed the door on him. On
  the mat outside, Mr. East stood for at least five minutes thinking, or trying
  to think. "He's been drinking!" he said hollowly, and, had he consulted
  Parker, his suspicions would have received support.</p>

  <p>Francois heard his employer's summons and came from his tiny compartment.
  "I am going out," said Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"I will telephone for the car, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>But Ronnie shook his head. "I will walk," he said. "You need not wait,
  Francois. Have I a key?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, m'sieur"&mdash;wonderingly, "it is on the chain of m'sieurs."</p>

  <p>Ronnie pulled a bunch from his pocket. "Which is it&mdash;this?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>"You need not wait," said Ronnie again. "I do not know when I shall be
  in."</p>

  <p>"Good, m'sieur."</p>

  <p>Well might Francois wonder, for Ronnie was speaking in French, the French
  of a man who had lived with French people. And Ronald Morelle, though he had
  a knowledge of that language, never spoke it, or if he did, his accent was
  bad and his vocabulary limited.</p>

  <p>It was eight o'clock at night when Ronnie returned. The flat was in
  darkness and was chilly. He turned on the lights before he closed the door
  and had a difficulty in finding the switch. It took him a longer time to
  locate the controls of the electric stove in the fireplace. They were
  skilfully hidden. In the kitchenette he lit a gas-ring, and, filling a copper
  kettle, set the water to boil.</p>

  <p>Francois, in his hurry to meet his brother that morning, had forgotten to
  dust the black writing-table. Ronnie searched for and found a duster and
  remedied his man's neglect. By the time he had finished, the kettle was
  boiling. The tea was in a little wooden box; the sugar he found on another
  shelf...there was no milk.</p>

  <p>Ronnie put on his coat, and with a jug in his hand, went out to find a
  dairy. The hall porter saw a man in a silk hat and wasp-waisted overcoat
  passing his lodge, and came out hurriedly. "Excuse me, Mr. Morelle, is there
  anything I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>"I want some milk," said Ronnie simply, "but please don't trouble; there
  is a dairy in the Brompton Road. I remember seeing the place."</p>

  <p>"They will be closed now, sir," said the porter. "If you give me the jug
  I'll get some for you." He took the vessel and made a flat-to-flat canvass
  and was successful in his quest.</p>

  <p>When he opened the door to the porter, Ronnie was in his shirt-sleeves and
  he had a broom in his hand. He explained pleasantly that he had upset a can
  of flour. Francois occasionally prepared an omelette for his master...</p>

  <p>"If you'll let me sweep it up..." began the porter, but Ronnie declined
  the offer. With a cup of tea and a slice of bread and butter he made a meal,
  cleared away the remnants of the feast and washed and dried the utensils.
  Then he sat down to pass the evening. The bookshelves were bewilderingly
  interesting. He took out a book. Greek! Of course, he read Greek and this was
  the Memorabilia; its margin covered with pencil notes in his own
  handwriting!</p>

  <p>Presently he replaced the book and tried to reduce the events of the day
  to some sort of order. The execution!</p>

  <p>What happened outside the execution shed?</p>

  <p>He had looked into the eyes of the condemned man, and suddenly the placid
  current of his mind had been disturbed as by a mighty wind. And standing
  there he had watched something being taken into the death house; whose
  uncouth body was it that hung strapped and strangled in the brick pit?
  Ambrose Sault's?</p>

  <p>He remembered a second of painful experience when he had a confused memory
  of strange people and places, queer earthquake memories. He recollected
  having being flogged by a red-haired brute of a man who wielded a strap; he
  recalled a dim-lit cell and the pale blue eyes of a clergyman who was
  pleading with him; of a woman, dark-faced and thick-lipped...his mother?...
  he remembered the past of Ambrose Sault! He had been Ambrose Sault in those
  ten seconds, with all the consciousness of Sault's life, all the passion of
  Sault's faith. And then the weighted traps had fallen with a thunderous clap
  and he was Ronald Morelle again&mdash;only different.</p>

  <p>Yet he was not wholly conscious of the difference. What a strange business
  it was! How was humanity served by that ritual of death? His heart melted
  within him as in a vivid flash he saw the blank despair of the trussed victim
  of the law shuffling forward to annihilation. He was being weak...but oh,
  God, how sad, how unutterably sad! He sobbed into his hands and was pained at
  the futility of his grief. Poor soul! Poor, mean, smirched soul! How vilely
  it had served the beautiful body which was its habitation.</p>

  <p>He looked up, frowning, his tear-stained face puckered in perplexity.
  Beautiful body? Ambrose Sault was gross, uncouth. And by all accounts a good
  man. Even Steppe admired his principles. Why should principles be admired? It
  was natural to be honest and clean...</p>

  <p>He had left the door of the pantry ajar; the shrill sound of the bell
  brought him to his feet. He waited to wipe his face, and the bell rang again
  impatiently. "My friend, you must wait," said Ronnie.</p>

  <p>A third time the bell rang before he opened the door. Steppe filled the
  doorway, the expanse of his shirt-front showed like a great white heart
  against the gloom of his evening dress.</p>

  <p>"Hello! You're in, huh? Long time in answering the bell&mdash;I suppose
  you've got somebody here."</p>

  <p>He looked around. The only light in the room was the shaded table-lamp.
  Ronnie had extinguished the others before he sat down.</p>

  <p>"The wicked love the darkness, huh, huh!" Steppe chuckled, and then,
  looking past him, Ronnie saw that he was not alone. Beryl waited at the door,
  and behind her was Dr. Merville.</p>

  <p>"Get dressed and come out," commanded Steppe noisily. "What's the matter
  with all you people, huh? Come along. We're going to a theatre. You're as bad
  as Beryl, sitting in the dark. You over-bred people think too much."</p>

  <p>"May we come in, Ronnie?" asked Beryl.</p>

  <p>It was very likely that Steppe's crude suggestion was justified. She had
  no illusions about Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"Come in. Of course you can come in," said Steppe scornfully. "Now, hurry,
  Morelle. We'll give you ten minutes&mdash;and put some lights on."</p>

  <p>"There is enough light."</p>

  <p>Ronnie's voice was calm and deep. Steppe, turning to find the switch,
  swung back again and peered at his face. "What's that?" he asked sharply. "I
  said there wasn't&mdash;what have you done to your voice? Here!"</p>

  <p>He walked across the room and ran his hand down the three switches.</p>

  <p>Ronnie screwed up his eyes to meet the painful brilliance. He saw Beryl's
  look of surprise, met the stare of the big man.</p>

  <p>"He's been crying!" bellowed Steppe in delight. "Huh, huh! Look at him,
  Beryl, snivelling!"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Steppe&mdash;Jan! How can you!"</p>

  <p>"How can I? By God, he's been snivelling! Look at his face, look at his
  eyes!" Steppe slapped his thigh in an ecstasy of joy. "So it got you, huh? I
  couldn't understand how a fellow like you could see it without curling
  up!"</p>

  <p>His coarseness, the malignity, the heartlessness of the man sickened Beryl
  Merville. But Ronnie...He was serene, unmoved by the other's taunts, meeting
  his eyes steadily.</p>

  <p>"It was dreadful...so dreadful, Steppe. To see that poor shrieking thing
  thrust forward, struggling..."</p>

  <p>"What!" shouted Steppe, and the girl gasped.</p>

  <p>"Ambrose Sault...shrieking in fear..."</p>

  <p>"You lie!" snarled Steppe. "Sault wasn't that kind. I've seen Maxton and
  he says he was without fear. You're dreaming, you fool. If it had been you...
  yes. You'd have squealed...by God! You would have raised Cain! But Ambrose
  Sault...he was a man. D'ye hear, a man. He's dead and I'm glad. But he was a
  man."</p>

  <p>He held himself in with an effort.</p>

  <p>"Get dressed and come out," he ordered roughly.</p>

  <p>"I'm so sorry, Ronnie." The girl had come to him, pity and sympathy in her
  sad face. "It was dreadful for you."</p>

  <p>He nodded. "Yes. It was dreadful. I am not coming out tonight, Beryl."</p>

  <p>She squeezed his arm gently. "Poor Ronnie!"</p>

  <p>"Poor fiddlesticks!" sneered Steppe. "Hurry, cry-baby. I'm not going to
  wait here all night. What are you afraid of? You shouldn't have seen the
  damned thing if you were going to snivel about it. You should have 'Tried the
  Luck'!" He chuckled as at a joke as he saw the swollen eyes of his victim
  wander to the bookshelf.</p>

  <p>"The Luck!" said Ronnie. He was speaking to himself, as he moved to the
  bookcase.</p>

  <p>Beryl saw him take down a worn volume and lay it on the table. He seemed
  like a man walking in his sleep. Mechanically he took up a miniature sword
  from a pin tray and held it for a moment in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Try the Luck!" scoffed Steppe. "Shall I go to the play, shan't I go to
  the play...dear Lord!"</p>

  <p>For the space of a second their eyes met and Beryl, watching, saw the big
  man start. Then the sword was thrust between the pages and the book opened.
  Ronnie looked gloomily at the close-set type...frowned. Then he read slowly,
  sonorously:</p>

  <p>"I will take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a stroke; yet
  neither shalt thou mourn nor weep; neither shall thy tears fall down."</p>

  <p>The clock on the mantelpiece struck nine. A silence, painful and intense,
  so profound that Beryl's quick breathings were audible.</p>

  <p>"I will take away the desire of thine eyes with a stroke..."</p>

  <p>"Don't read it again!" cried Steppe harshly. "I'm going...listening to
  this fool...come on, Beryl!"</p>

  <p>Turning at the door she saw him still standing at the table. His face was
  in shadow, his hands, white and shapely, outspread upon the leather-covered
  top, the open book between them.</p>

  <p>"He's drunk," said Steppe, and she made no reply.</p>

  <p>Jan Steppe was very preoccupied all that evening, but not so completely
  oblivious of realities that he did not bargain with the doctor for certain
  shares in the Klein River Mine. Just before he had left his house Steppe had
  received a code cable from Johannesburg.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap46"
     name="chap46">CHAPTER XLVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ON the morning of Ambrose Sault's execution, Evie found a
  letter awaiting her at the drug-store. Whatever natural unhappiness of
  feeling she may have had when she left her weeping mother, vanished in the
  perusal of Ronnie's long epistle. The envelope bore the St. John's Wood
  postmark, but this she would not have regarded as significant, even if she
  had noticed it, which she did not. Not a love-letter in the strictest sense;
  it was too precise and businesslike for that. It gave her certain dates to be
  cherished, certain instructions to be observed. It went to the length of
  naming Parisian dressmakers where she might be expeditiously fitted. She was
  to bring nothing, only a suitcase with bare necessities. A week's stay in
  Paris would give her all the time she needed to equip herself. It was a trial
  to her that she would not see Ronnie for a month, not until the great day...
  She caught her breath at the thought. But he had stipulated this.</p>

  <p>Ronnie was too keen a student of women to give her the opportunity of
  changing her mind. His letters could not be argued with, or questioned. And
  the month would quickly pass. Teddy Williams was a faithful attendant, and
  although he could not be compared in any respect with Ronnie, it was pleasant
  and flattering to extend her patronage to one who hung upon her words and
  regarded her as an authority upon most subjects. She had imparted her views
  on marriage to Teddy, and that young man had been impressed without being
  convinced. Ronnie's letter was to be read and re-read. She expected another
  the next day, and when it did not come, she was disappointed. Yet he had not
  promised to write; in his letter he had said: "Until you are my very own, I
  shall live the life of an anchorite'. She looked up 'anchorite' and found
  that it meant 'one who retires from society to a desert or solitary place to
  avoid the temptations of the world and to devote himself to religious
  exercises', and accepted this as a satisfactory explanation, though she
  couldn't imagine Ronnie engaging himself in religious exercises.</p>

  <p>Life ran normally at home, now that Mr. Sault was dead. Evie had felt very
  keenly the disgrace of having a lodger who was a murderer. Only the fact that
  Ronnie knew him, too, and to some extent shared in the general odium,
  prevented her from enlarging upon the scandal to her mother and Christina.
  Beyond her comprehension, was her sister's remarkable cheerfulness. Christina
  didn't seem to care whether Mr. Sault was alive or dead. She was her own
  caustic self, and the shadow of her proper woe failed to soften or sadden
  her.</p>

  <p>A week of her waiting had passed before Christina even mentioned the name
  of Ambrose Sault, and then it was in connection with the disposal of his
  room. Apparently he had paid his rent for a long period in advance, and Mrs.
  Colebrook refused to let the room again until the tenancy had expired.
  "Mother is being sentimental over Ambrose and his room," said Christina, "but
  there is no reason why you should not have the room, Evie. You've been aching
  for privacy as long as I can remember."</p>

  <p>Evie shuddered. "I couldn't sleep there. I'd be afraid he'd haunt me."</p>

  <p>"I should be afraid he wouldn't," said Christina, with a little smile. "If
  you don't like the idea, I will have my bed put in there."</p>

  <p>"No, no, please don't, Christina," begged the girl urgently. "I&mdash;I
  prefer to sleep here if you don't mind. I want to be with you as much as I
  can, and I'm out all day."</p>

  <p>"And home much earlier. Is it Ronnie or Teddy?"</p>

  <p>"I'm seeing a lot of Teddy," replied Evie primly; "he is quite a nice
  boy."</p>

  <p>"And Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>"Leave Ronnie alone." Evie turned a good-humoured smile to her. "He is too
  busy to meet me so often."</p>

  <p>"Loud cheers," said the ironical Christina. "Evie, why don't you ask him
  to call here? I should enjoy a chat with him."</p>

  <p>"Here?" Evie was incredulous. "How absurd! Ronnie wouldn't dream of coming
  here."</p>

  <p>Christina laughed. "I won't tease you any more, Evie. Does he ever say
  anything about Ambrose? He was in the prison when Ambrose was executed."</p>

  <p>Evie writhed. "I wish you wouldn't talk about it, Christina...in such a
  cold-blooded way&mdash;ugh!"</p>

  <p>"Does he?"</p>

  <p>"I haven't seen him since that...that awful day," she said, "and I'm sure
  he wouldn't talk about it." Evie hesitated. "Do you think much about Mr.
  Sault, Chris?"</p>

  <p>Christina put down her knitting in her lap and nodded. "All the time," she
  said. "He isn't out of my thoughts for a second. Not his face, I mean, or his
  awkward-looking body, but the real. Do you remember, Evie, how embarrassed I
  used to make him sometimes, and how he'd rub his chin with the back of his
  hand? I always knew when Ambrose was troubled. And how he used to sit on my
  bed and listen so seriously to all my wails and whines?"</p>

  <p>Evie looked for some evidence of emotion, but Christina's eyes were dry...
  she appeared to be happy.</p>

  <p>"Yes...Chris, do you think I ought to take these stockings back to the
  store? They laddered the first time I put them on, and I paid a terrible
  price for them."</p>

  <p>Christina took the stockings from the girl and there all talk of Ambrose
  Sault came to an end.</p>

  <p>A few afternoons later, returning from her early walk, she was met at the
  door by her agitated mother. "There's a gentleman called to see you,
  Christina; he's in the kitchen."</p>

  <p>"A gentleman?"</p>

  <p>'A gentleman' might mean anything by Mrs. Colebrook's elastic description.
  "He's a friend of Miss Merville's, named Mr. Morelle."</p>

  <p>"What?" Christina could hardly believe her ears. Ronnie Morelle? Had Evie
  conveyed her joking request to him? Even if she had, it was not likely he
  would call for the pleasure of seeing her. Mrs. Colebrook hustled her into
  the kitchen and closed the door on them. She had all the respect of her class
  for the sanctity of private conversation.</p>

  <p>Ronnie was sitting in the chair where Ambrose had so often sat, as Mrs.
  Colebrook reminded her at least three times a day. He rose as she entered and
  stood surveying her. It was the first time she had seen him close at hand,
  and her first impression was one of admiration. She had never met so
  good-looking a man, and instantly she absolved Evie for her infatuation. He
  did not offer his hand at first, and it was not until she was about to speak
  that it came out to her shyly. It was a strong hand, and the warmth of the
  grip surprised her. "Christina!" he said softly, and she felt herself go
  red.</p>

  <p>"That is my name. You are Ronnie Morelle? I have heard a great deal about
  you from Evie."</p>

  <p>"From Evie?...yes, why of course! Your mother is looking well. She works
  very hard&mdash;too hard I think. Women ought not to do such heavy work." She
  sat, tongue-tied, could only point to the chair from which he had risen. "I
  had to come to see you...but I have been rather occupied and selfish. I have
  been reading a great deal...a sheer delight. You will understand that? And
  poor Francois has had a lot of trouble&mdash;his brother developed
  appendicitis. We have had an anxious time."</p>

  <p>Ronnie Morelle! And he was talking gravely of the anxious time he had had
  because the brother of his servant&mdash;it was incredible. She never dreamt
  that he was this kind of man; all her preconceived ideas and more than half
  of her prejudice against him were swept away in a second. He was sincere; she
  knew it. Absolutely sincere. This was no pose of his. "You haven't seen
  Evie...oh yes, you have! She told you I wanted to see you, Mr. Morelle. I do,
  although I was only joking when I suggested your coming. Are you very fond of
  Evie?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, she is a nice child. A little thoughtless and perhaps a little
  selfish. Young girls are that way, especially if they are pretty. I am fond
  of young people, all young things have an appeal for me. Kittens, puppies
  chicks...I can watch them for hours."</p>

  <p>This was Ronnie Morelle. She had to tell herself all the time. He was the
  man whom Ambrose Sault had described as 'foul', and Ambrose was so charitable
  in his judgments; the man who had taken Beryl Merville.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you spoke of Evie," he went on. "She must not be hurt. At her
  age men make a profound impression and colour the whole of after-life. It is
  so easy to sour the young. It is hard to improve on the old texts"&mdash;he
  smiled. "I wonder why I try. 'As the twig is bent, so is the tree inclined.'
  I never think that it is wise to reason with a girl in love...fascinate is a
  better word. Aegrescit medendo! The disease thrives on remedies. I don't know
  where I picked up that phrase&mdash;it is Latin, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>He went red again, was painfully embarrassed. She fell back against the
  wall, white as death. Only by an effort of will did she arrest the scream
  that arose in her throat. In his distress he was rubbing his chin with his
  knuckle!</p>

  <p>"Oh, my God!" cried Christina, wide-eyed. Springing up she took both his
  hands and looked into his face. "Don't you know?" she breathed.</p>

  <p>A smile dawned slowly in the handsome face of Ronnie Morelle. "I know it
  is very good to see you, Christina," he said.</p>

  <p>Then as suddenly she released his hands and held on to the table. "Get me
  some water, please."</p>

  <p>She watched him as he went unerringly into the scullery. There were two
  taps, one connected with a rainwater cistern that her father had made; the
  other was the drinking water. He turned the right tap, found a glass where it
  was invariably hidden on a shelf behind a cretonne curtain, and brought it
  back to her. She drank greedily. "Sit down...Ronnie. I want you to tell me
  something. You went to the execution...I know it hurts you, my dear, but you
  must tell me. How did he die?"</p>

  <p>She waited, holding her breath. "It was...terrible," he said in a low
  voice; "he was so...afraid!"</p>

  <p>"Afraid!" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I don't remember much. Every thought seemed to have gone out of my mind.
  Afterwards I was so numbed...why, I didn't even recognise my own car or know
  that I had a car."</p>

  <p>"Did you touch him...look at him, then? Did you, Ronnie?" Ronald Morelle
  answered with a gesture. "Did you...?"</p>

  <p>"I looked at him, but only for a second. He was reciting a poem. Henley's.
  I was reading it today, trying to recall things. That was all. I just looked
  into his eyes, and I was feeling hateful toward him, Christina. And that was
  all. He began to moan and cry out. I was terribly distressed."</p>

  <p>She said no more. She wanted to be alone with her mad thoughts. When he
  rose to go, she was glad. "I'll come again on Wednesday," he said, but
  corrected his promise. "No, Wednesday is wash-day. Your mother will not want
  me here."</p>

  <p>"How do you know, Ronnie, that it is mother's wash-day?" She was
  addressing him as if he were a child from whom information must be
  coaxed.</p>

  <p>"I don't know...Evie may have told me...of course it is Wednesday,
  Christina!"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Yes, it is Wednesday."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook, consonant with her principles, had effaced herself so
  effectively that Christina had to seek her in her hiding-place. She was
  sitting in Sault's room, and sniffed suspiciously when the girl called
  her.</p>

  <p>"Mother, you have often told me about something Ambrose did when you were
  very ill. Will you tell me again?" Mrs. Colebrook was happy to tell,
  embellishing the story with footnotes and interpolations descriptive of her
  own impressions on that occasion.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, mother."</p>

  <p>"What did he want? I didn't like to come down whilst he was here...not in
  this old skirt. Did he know poor Mr. Sault? A la-di-da sort of fellow, but
  very polite. He quite flustered me, he was so friendly." She relieved the
  girl from the necessity for replying by supplying her own answers.</p>

  <p>At the foot of the stairs Mrs. Colebrook heard the snick of a key as
  Christina locked the door of her room. Mrs. Colebrook sighed. Christina was
  getting more and more unsociable.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap47"
     name="chap47">CHAPTER XLVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">DID Beryl know...should she know? Suppose she went to her
  and told her the crazy theory she had. Beryl would doubt her sanity. No, no
  good would come of precipitancy. She must be sure, thought Christina, lying
  on her bed, her hand a her mouth as though she feared that she might
  involuntarily cry her news aloud. No particulars of Ambrose Sault's death had
  appeared in the press. The longest notice was one which after a brief
  reference, to the execution, went on to give details concerning the crime.
  Practically all the references to the execution were similar:</p>

  <p>'Ambrose Sault was executed at Wechester Jail yesterday morning for the
  murder of Paul Moropulos. The condemned man walked with a firm step to the
  gallows, and death was instantaneous. He made no statement. Billet was the
  executioner.'</p>

  <p>The hangman always received his puff.</p>

  <p>When she had been staying with Beryl she had met Sir John Maxton; he had
  returned on the morning of the execution and had come straight to the house.
  He had said nothing that gave her any impression except that Ambrose had died
  bravely. Would he have heard anything later? She made up her mind, dressed,
  and went out.</p>

  <p>There was a telephone a block away and she got through to Sir John's
  chambers in the Temple. To her relief he answered the telephone himself. "Is
  that you, Sir John? It is Christina Colebrook...yes...I'm very well. Can I
  see you, Sir John? Any time now if you wish. I could be with you in twenty
  minutes...oh, thank you...thank you so much."</p>

  <p>A bus dropped her in Fleet Street, and she walked through the Temple
  grounds to the ugly and dreary buildings where he rented chambers. They were
  on the ground floor happily; Christina was still a semi-invalid. "You've come
  to ask me about Sault?" he said, as soon as she was announced.</p>

  <p>"Why do you think that?" she smiled.</p>

  <p>"I guessed. I suppose Ronnie has told everybody about the ghastly
  business. It seems impossible, impossible that he could have shown the white
  feather as he did," said Sir John. "I can hardly believe it is true, and yet
  when I got into touch with the deputy governor, he told me very much the same
  story&mdash;that one moment Sault was calm and literally smiling at death,
  the very next instant he was...pitiful, blubbering like a child. I hate
  telling you this, because I know you were such dear friends, but...you want
  to know?"</p>

  <p>She inclined her head. "Nothing else happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing...oh yes, there was one curious circumstance. In the midst of his
  amazing outburst Sault cried, 'Ronald Morelle of Balliol!' Did he know that
  Ronnie was at Balliol? I can only imagine that by this time he hadn't any
  idea at all what he was talking about."</p>

  <p>She rose. "Thank you, Sir John," she said quietly, "you have saved my
  reason."</p>

  <p>"In what way?" His curiosity was piqued.</p>

  <p>"There was something I had to believe&mdash;or go mad. That is cryptic,
  isn't it? But I can't be plain, for fear you think I've lost my reason
  already!"</p>

  <p>Sir John was too polite to press her, too much of a lawyer to reveal his
  curiosity. He went on to talk of Sault. "He was certainly the best man I have
  met in my life. By 'best' I particularly refer to his moral character, his
  ideal, his sense of divinity. His courage humbled me, his philosophy left me
  feeling like a child of six. I must believe what I am told, so I accept the
  story about his having made a scene on the scaffold without question. But
  there is an explanation for it, that I'll swear, and an explanation
  creditable to Ambrose Sault."</p>

  <p>Christina went home with a light heart, convinced. She had begun a letter
  to Beryl and was debating half-way through whether she would as much as hint
  her peculiar theory, when Evie burst into the room cyclonically, her eyes
  blazing. "He's been here! Mother said so...you were talking to him for a long
  time! Oh, Chris, what did he say? Wasn't it wonderful of him to come? Don't
  you think he is handsome, Chris? Own up&mdash;isn't he a gorgeous man? Did he
  ask after me? Was he very disappointed when he found I was out?"</p>

  <p>"I'll take your questions in order," said Christina, solemnly ticking them
  off on her finger. "He has been here, if He is Ronnie; he said a lot of
  things. It was certainly wonderful for me that he came. He asked after you,
  but didn't seem to be cast down to find you were out. Was that the lot? I
  hope so."</p>

  <p>"But, Christina!" She was quivering with excitement. "What do you think of
  him?"</p>

  <p>"I think he is sublime!"</p>

  <p>Evie glanced at her resentfully, suspecting sarcasm; saw that her sister
  was in earnest, and, seeing this, was confounded. "He is very nice," she
  said, less enthusiastic. "Yes...a dear. Did you really get on with him,
  Chris? How queer! And after all that you've said about him! Didn't your
  conscience prick you?"</p>

  <p>Christina sent her red locks flying in a vigorous headshake. "No, it
  wasn't conscience," she said. Evie, from being boisterously interested,
  became quietly distrait. "Of one thing I am certain," volunteered Christina,
  "and it is that he will never behave dishonourably or give you, or for the
  matter of that, mother and me, one hour's real pain."</p>

  <p>"No...I'm sure he won't," said Evie awkwardly, the more awkward because
  she was trying so hard not to be.</p>

  <p>"Such a man couldn't be mean. I am certain of that," Christina went on.
  "Evie, I am not scared about you any more...and I was, you know. Just scared!
  Sometimes when you came back from seeing Ronnie, I dared not look at you for
  fear...I didn't exactly know what I feared. Now...well, I feel that you are
  in good hands, darling, and I shall not be thinking every time you go out: 'I
  wonder if she will come back again?'"</p>

  <p>Evie's face was burning. If she had spoken she would have betrayed
  herself. She became interested in the contents of a hanging cupboard, and
  hummed a careless tune, shakily. "Are you singing or is it the hinge?" asked
  Christina.</p>

  <p>"You're very rude...I was singing...humming."</p>

  <p>"There must be music in the family somewhere," said Christina; "probably
  it goes back to our lordly ancestor&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I told Teddy about that, about Lord Fransham&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Did you tell Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>Evie wondered if she should stay. Christina was so excellently disposed
  towards him that it would be a pity to excite her resentment. "Yes...he
  laughed. He said everybody has a lord in his family if he only goes back far
  enough. Teddy thought it was wonderful and he said...you'll laugh?"</p>

  <p>"I swear I won't."</p>

  <p>"Well...he said that he knew that I had aristocratic blood by my instep,
  it is so arched. And it is, you know, Chris&mdash;just look!"</p>

  <p>"Shurrup!" said Christina vulgarly.</p>

  <p>"Well...he did. Teddy isn't half the fool you think him...I don't exactly
  mean you, Chris, but people. His father has a tremendous farm, miles and
  miles of it. He sent Teddy over here for six months. What do you think for?"
  Christina couldn't think. "To find a wife!" said Evie. "Isn't it quaint? And
  do you know that Teddy is staying at the Carlton Grand? I thought he was
  living with his aunt in Tenton Street, and I only discovered by accident that
  he was staying at a swagger hotel. He said he would write and tell his father
  about our lord." She sighed heavily. "I like Teddy awfully. He is so grateful
  or...well, for anything I can do for him, such as putting his tie straight
  and telling him about things."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you marry Teddy?"</p>

  <p>A few weeks ago Evie would have snorted scornfully. Now she was silent for
  a long time. She sighed again. "That is impossible. I'm too fond of Ronnie,
  and I believe in keeping...in keeping my word. Teddy's father is building a
  beautiful little house for him. And Teddy says that he has a quiet horse that
  a girl could ride. He believes in riding astride; so do I. I've never ridden,
  but that is the way I should: ride...through the corn for miles and miles.
  You can see the mountains from Teddy's farm. They are covered with snow, even
  in the summer. There is a place called Banff where you can have a perfectly
  jolly time&mdash;dances and all that. In the winter, when it is freezingly
  cold, Teddy goes to Vancouver, where it is quite warm. He has an orange-farm
  somewhere." For the third time she sighed.</p>

  <p>Christina, in her wisdom, made no comment.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap48"
     name="chap48">CHAPTER XLVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first"><a name="here"
     id="here"></a>EVIE usually had her breakfast alone. Christina was late,
     and Mrs. Colebrook breakfasted before her family came down, and was,
     moreover, so completely occupied in supplying the needs of her youngest
     daughter that it would have been impossible to settle herself down to a
     meal. Evie was generally down by a quarter to eight; the postman came at
     eight o'clock. Until recently, Evie had no interest in the movements of
     that official. Very few letters came to the house in any circumstances,
     and of these Evie's share was negligible. Teddy brought a new interest to
     the morning, for he was a faithful correspondent, and the girl would have
     known long before that he was an inmate of a superior caravanserai had not
     the youth, in his modesty, written on the plainest of notepaper.</p>

  <p>Not then, nor at any other time, did the mail have any thrill for Mrs.
  Colebrook. She had a well-to-do sister living in the north who wrote to her
  regularly every six months. These letters might have been published as a
  supplement to the Nomenclature of Diseases, for they constituted a record of
  the obscure ailments which afflicted the writer's family. She had a
  sister-in-law living within a mile of her whom she seldom saw and never heard
  from. Whatever letters came to the house were either for Christina or Evie,
  generally for Christina.</p>

  <p>Ambrose Sault had once presented Christina with five hundred postal cards.
  It was one of the freakish things that Ambrose did, but behind it there was a
  solid reason. Christina enjoyed a constant supply of old magazines and
  out-of-date periodicals. Evie collected them for her from her friends. And in
  these publications were alluring advertisements, the majority of which begged
  the reader, italically, to send for Illustrated Catalogue No. 74, or to write
  to Desk H for a beautiful handbook describing at greater length the wonders
  of the articles advertised. Sometimes samples were offered, samples of baby's
  food, samples of fabric, samples of soap and patent medicine, and other
  delectable products. Christina had expressed a wish that she could write, and
  Ambrose had supplied the means.</p>

  <p>Thereafter, Christina's letter-bag was a considerable one. She knew more
  about motor-cars&mdash;their advantages over one another, their
  super-excellent speeds and economies&mdash;than the average dealer. If you
  asked her what car ran the longest distance on a can of petrol, she would not
  only tell you, but would specify which was the better of the gases supplied.
  She knew the relative nutritive qualities of every breakfast food on the
  market; the longest-wearing boots and the cheapest furniture.</p>

  <p>Evie had finished her meal when the postman knocked. "A letter from Teddy
  and a sample for Christina, I suppose," speculated Mrs. Colebrook, hurrying
  to the door. She invariably ran to meet the postman, having a confused idea
  that it was an offence punishable under the penal code to keep him
  waiting.</p>

  <p>There was no mail for Christina. "Here's your letter..." Evie took the
  stout and expensive-looking envelope embossed redly with the name of the
  hotel.</p>

  <p>"Who's writing to me?" asked Mrs. Colebrook. She turned the letter over,
  examined the handwriting critically, deciphered the postmark...finally tore
  open the flap of the envelope. "Well I never!" said Mrs. Colebrook. She
  looked at the heading again. "Who is Johnson and Kennet?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The house-agents? There is a firm of that name in Knightsbridge. What is
  it, mother?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook read aloud:<br></p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Madam,<br>
  "We have been requested to approach you in regard to work which we feel you
  would care to undertake. A client of ours has a small house on the Continent,
  for which he is anxious to secure a housekeeper. Knowing, through Dr.
  Merville, that you have a daughter who is recovering from an illness, he asks
  me to state that he would be glad if your daughter accompanied you. There is
  practically no work&mdash;three servants, all of whom speak English, are
  kept&mdash;and our client wishes us to state that the grounds are extensive
  and pretty, and hopes that you will make the freest use of them and the small
  car which he will leave there. He himself does not expect to occupy the
  house, so that you will be practically free from any kind of supervision.</p>

  <p>The salary was named. It was generous.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook looked over her glasses at the wondering Evie. "Mother! How
  perfectly splendid!"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook was not so enthusiastic. Change of any kind was anathema.
  She had acted as housekeeper in her younger days, so that the work had no
  terrors for her, but&mdash;abroad! Foreign countries meant peril. Foreigners
  to her were sinister men who carried knives and were possessed of homicidal
  tendencies. They spoke a language expressly designed to conceal their evil
  intentions, and they found their recreation in plotting in underground
  chambers. There was a cinema at the end of Walter Street.</p>

  <p>"There is something written on the other side," said Evie suddenly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook turned the sheet. "The invitation extends to your younger
  daughter, if she would care to accompany you."</p>

  <p>"Well!" said Evie, and flew up the stairs to Christina's room. "Christina!
  What do you think? Mother has a letter from a house-agent
  offering&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me!" Christina interrupted. "Let me guess! They've offered her
  a beautiful house in the country rent free...no? Then they've offered...let
  me think...a house in a nice warm climate where I can bask in the sunshine
  and watch the butterflies flirting with the roses!"</p>

  <p>Evie's jaw dropped. "Whatever made you think...?"</p>

  <p>Christina snatched the letter and read, her eyes bright with excitement.
  "Oh, golly!" she said, and laughed so long that Evie grew alarmed. "No, I'm
  not mad, and I'm not clairvoyant. Mother, what do you think of it?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook had followed her daughter upstairs. "I don't know what to
  think," she said. She was one of those people who welcome an opportunity to
  show their indecision. Mrs. Colebrook liked to be 'persuaded'. Though she
  might make up her mind irrevocably, it was necessary that argument around and
  about should be offered before she yielded her tentative agreement.</p>

  <p>Nobody knew this better than Christina. She drew a long sigh of relief,
  recognising the signs. "We'll talk it over after Evie has gone to her pill-
  shop," she said, and for once Evie did not contest a description of her place
  of business, which usually provoked her to retort. "I only want to say,
  mother, that you need not worry about me. I can get lodgings at one of the
  girls' hostels. I don't think I want to go abroad. In fact, I know that I
  don't. But it would be fine for Christina. It is my dream come true. I've
  always had that plan for her&mdash;a place where she could sit in the
  sunshine and watch the flowers grow."</p>

  <p>Christina's smile was all loving kindness; she took the girl's fingers in
  her hand and pinched them softly. "Off to your workshop, woman," she ordered.
  "Mother and I want to talk about the sunny south."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that I can take it," said Mrs. Colebrook dismally. "I don't
  like the idea of living in a foreign place&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"We'll discuss that," said Christina in her businesslike way. "Did those
  linoleum patterns come?"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap49"
     name="chap49">CHAPTER XLIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no letter for Evie when she arrived at the store.
  Curiously enough she was not as disappointed as she expected to be. There was
  a chance that Ronnie would have written after his visit to the house, but
  when she found her desk bare, she accepted his neglect with equanimity. Her
  love for Ronnie was undiminished. She faced, with a coolness which was
  unnatural in her, the future he had sketched, and if at times she felt a
  twinge of uneasiness, she put the less pleasant aspect away from her. It
  would not be honourable to go back on her word, even if she wanted to do so.
  And she did not. As to the more agreeable prospect, she did not think about
  that either. It was easier to dismiss the whole thing from her mind. She told
  herself she was being philosophical. In reality, she was solving her problem
  by the simple process of forgetting it.</p>

  <p>Leaving the store at midday to get her lunch, she saw Ronnie. He was
  driving past in his big Rolls, and apparently he did not see her. Why was she
  glad?&mdash;for glad she was. That thought had to be puzzled out in the
  afternoon, with disastrous consequences to her cash balance, for when she
  made her return that night she was short the price of a hot-water bottle.</p>

  <p>But Ronnie had seen her, long before she had seen him. He was on his way
  to lunch with a man he knew, but toward whom he had for some reason conceived
  a dislike. It was rather strange, because Jerry Talbot was the one
  acquaintance he possessed who might be called 'friend'. They had known one
  another at Oxford; they had for some time hunted in pairs; they shared
  memories of a common shame. Yet when Jerry's excited voice had called him on
  the telephone that morning and had begged him to meet his erstwhile partner
  at Vivaldi's, Ronnie experienced a sense of nausea. He would have refused the
  invitation, but before he could frame the words, Jerry had rung off.</p>

  <p>Vivaldi's is a smart but not too smart restaurant, and had been a
  favourite lunching-place of Ronnie's. It was all the more unreasonable in him
  that he should descend beneath the glass-roofed portico with a feeling of
  revulsion. Mr. Talbot had not arrived, said the beaming maitre-d'hotel. Yes,
  he had booked a table. Ronnie seated himself in the lounge, and a bellboy
  brought him an evening newspaper which he did not read. Had he done so, he
  would not have waited.</p>

  <p>Half an hour passed and Ronnie was feeling hungry. Another quarter of an
  hour. "I am going into the restaurant. When Mr. Talbot comes, tell him I have
  begun my lunch." He was shown to the table and chose a simple meal from the
  card. At any rate Jerry's unpardonable rudeness gave him an excuse for
  declining further invitations.</p>

  <p>He had finished his lunch and had signalled for his bill when, looking
  round, he recognized two men at one of the window tables. He would not have
  approached them, but Sir John Maxton beckoned. Dr. Merville would gladly have
  dispensed with his presence, thought Ronnie, and wondered why he had intruded
  into an important conference. "Come and sit down, Ronnie. Lunching alone?
  That is rather unusual, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"My friend disappointed me," said Ronnie, and he saw the doctor's lip
  curl.</p>

  <p>"Did she&mdash;too bad," said Maxton.</p>

  <p>"It was a 'he'," corrected Ronnie, and knew that neither man believed him.
  He noticed Sir John glancing at his companion.</p>

  <p>"Ronnie, I wonder if you can help us. Do you remember the flotation of
  that Traction Company of Steppe's?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think it is much good asking Ronnie," the doctor broke in with a
  touch of impatience. "Ronnie's memory is a little too convenient."</p>

  <p>"I remember the flotation...in a way," admitted Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember the meeting that was held at Steppe's house when he
  produced the draft of the prospectus?" Ronnie nodded.</p>

  <p>"Before we go any farther, John," interrupted Merville, "I think it will
  be fair to Ronnie if we tell him that there is trouble over the prospectus.
  Some of the financial papers are accusing us of faking the assets. The
  question is, was I responsible, by including properties which I should not
  have included, or did Steppe, in his draft, give me the facts as I published
  them; I don't think Ronnie will remember quite so vividly if he knows that he
  may be running counter to Steppe." Ronnie did not answer.</p>

  <p>"You see what I am driving at," Sir John went on. "There may be bad
  trouble if the Public Prosecutor takes these accusations
  seriously&mdash;which, so far, he hasn't. We want to be prepared if he
  does."</p>

  <p>"I cannot remember very clearly," said Ronnie. "I am not a member of the
  Board. But I do recall very clearly Steppe showing a draft, and not only
  showing it, but reading it."</p>

  <p>"Do you remember whether in that draft he referred to the Woodside
  Repairing Shops; and if he did, whether he spoke of those as being the
  absolute property or leased property of the company?"</p>

  <p>"The absolute property," said Ronnie. "I remember distinctly, because the
  Woodside Repair Shops are on the edge of a little estate which my father left
  me&mdash;you remember, John? And naturally I was interested."</p>

  <p>Merville was dumbfounded. Never in his most sanguine moments did he
  suppose that Ronnie would assist him in this respect. Ronnie, who shivered at
  a word from Steppe, whose sycophantic servant he had been! "This may come to
  a fight," said Sir John, "and that would mean putting you in the box to
  testify against Steppe. Have you quarrelled with him?"</p>

  <p>"Good gracious, no!" said Ronnie in surprise. "Why should I quarrel with
  him? He doesn't worry me. In a way he is amusing, in another way pathetic. I
  feel sometimes sorry for him. A man with such attainments, such powers and
  yet so paltry! I often wonder why he prefers the mean way to the big way. He
  uses his power outrageously, his strength brutally. Perhaps he didn't start
  right...got all his proportions wrong. I was working it out last night... the
  beginnings of Steppe...and concluded that he must have had an unhappy
  childhood. If a child is treated meanly, and is the victim of mean tyrannies,
  he grows up to regard the triumph of meanness as the supreme end in life. His
  whole outlook is coloured that way, and methods which we normal people look
  upon as despicable, are perfectly legitimate in his eyes."</p>

  <p>"Good God!" said Sir John, aghast. It was the man, not the arguments,
  which startled him.</p>

  <p>"Children ought not to be left to the chance training which their parents
  give them," Ronnie went on, full of his subject. "But here, I admit, I am
  postulating a condition of society which will never be realized. Some day I
  will start my Mother College. It is a queer-sounding title," he said
  apologetically, "but you will understand. I want a great institution where we
  can take the illegitimate children of the country, the unwanted children.
  They go to baby farmers and beasts of that kind now. I want a college of
  babies where we will teach them and train them from their babyhood up to
  think and feel goodly, not piously. That doesn't matter. But bigly and
  generously. To have high ideals and broad visions; to..."</p>

  <p>He stopped and blushed, conscious of their interest and stupefaction;
  squirmed unhappily in his chair, and rubbed his chin nervously with the
  knuckles of his hand. Sir John Maxton leant back in his chair, his face
  twitching. A waiter was passing. "Bring me a brandy," he said hoarsely, "a
  double brandy." Christina had only wanted water.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap50"
     name="chap50">CHAPTER L</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"What flabbergasts me is Ronnie's willingness to go against
  Steppe," said the doctor, just before he dropped Sir John at his chambers. He
  had done most of the talking since they left Vivaldi's, and Maxton had been
  content that he should. "I can only suppose that Ronnie has had a row with
  Jan."</p>

  <p>"Tell me this, Merville," said Sir John, leaning his arms on the edge of
  the door and speaking into the car. "If you believe that Steppe is the rascal
  I pretty well know him to be, why are you allowing Beryl to marry him?"</p>

  <p>An awkward question for the doctor. "Oh well...one isn't sure. I may be in
  error after all. Steppe is quite a good fellow..."</p>

  <p>"Do you owe him money?" asked Maxton quietly. Close friendship has its
  privileges.</p>

  <p>"A little&mdash;nothing to speak of. You don't think I would sacrifice
  Beryl...?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, Bertram...I don't know. Why ever you took up with that
  crowd is beyond me."</p>

  <p>"By the way," said the doctor, anxious to switch to another subject, "that
  isn't an original idea of Ronnie's...the Mother College, or whatever he calls
  it. Poor Ambrose Sault had exactly the same dream. I never heard the details
  from him, but he has mentioned it. Funny that Ronnie is taking it up!"</p>

  <p>"Yes." Sir John waved his hand and went into the building. He rang for his
  clerk. "Do you remember a young lady coming to see me a few days ago&mdash;a
  Miss Colebrook? Have we any record of her address?"</p>

  <p>"No, Sir John."</p>

  <p>"H'm...put me through to Dr. Merville's house in Park Place...I want to
  speak to Miss Merville." A minute later: "Yes...John Maxton speaking. Is that
  you, Beryl? I want to know Miss Colebrook's address...thank you." He
  scribbled on his blotting-pad. "Thank you...no, my dear, only I may have to
  get in touch with her." He remembered, after he had hung up the telephone,
  that Ambrose Sault had propounded a will in which the address had appeared,
  but the will was in the hands of Sir John's own lawyers. Ambrose had left
  very little, so little that it was hardly worth while taking probate. But the
  recollection of the will gave him the excuse he wanted...</p>

  <p>"Sir John rang me up, father; he asked for Christina's address. Do you
  know why?"</p>

  <p>"No, dear. I wonder he didn't ask me. I have been lunching with
  him&mdash;and Ronnie. Rather, Ronnie joined us after lunch was through...he
  was loquacious and strange. H'm..."</p>

  <p>"How strange?"</p>

  <p>"Beryl, did you notice the other night&mdash;I agree with you, Steppe was
  brutal&mdash;how deep his voice had grown? Boys' voices change that way when
  they reach an age, but Ronnie isn't a boy. Changed...and his views on
  affairs. He held John spellbound whilst he delivered himself volubly on
  illegitimate children and the future of the race. And the curious thing is
  that Ronnie hates children. Loathes them; he makes no secret of that. Says
  that they are irresponsible animals that should be kept on the leash."</p>

  <p>"He said that today?"</p>

  <p>"No...oh, a long time ago. Now he wants a big institution where they can
  be trained...maybe it is a variation of his leash and cage theory. How did
  you get on?"</p>

  <p>Steppe had been to lunch and was in the hall about to take his departure
  when Sir John rang. "He came," she said indifferently. "It was a pleasant
  lunch. I think he enjoyed it. I had mealies for him and he wrestled with them
  happily."</p>

  <p>"Did you discuss anything?"</p>

  <p>"The happy day?" she asked ironically. "Yes&mdash;next Tuesday. Quietly.
  We go to Paris the same night. He wants the honeymoon to be spent in the
  Bavarian Alps and he is sending his car on to Paris. I think that is all the
  news."</p>

  <p>Her indifference bothered him. "Steppe, I am sure, is a man who improves
  on acquaintance," he said encouragingly.</p>

  <p>"I am sure he does," she agreed politely. "Will you tell Ronnie, or shall
  I write to him?"</p>

  <p>"I will tell Ronnie," said the doctor hastily. "I don't think I should
  encourage a correspondence with him if I were you, Beryl. Jan doesn't like
  it. He was furious about you insisting upon Ronnie coming out with us the
  other night."</p>

  <p>"Very well," said Beryl.</p>

  <p>"I think...I only think, you understand, that Steppe is under the
  impression that you were once very fond of Ronnie, or that you had an affair
  with him. He is a very jealous man. You must remember that, Beryl."</p>

  <p>"It almost seems that I am going to be happily married," she said, with a
  queer smile.</p>

  <p>She did not write to Ronnie. There was nothing to be gained by encouraging
  a correspondence&mdash;she agreed entirely with her father on that point.
  Steppe she dismissed from her thoughts just as quickly as she could. Why had
  Sir John asked for Christina's address? There was no reason why he should
  not. Perhaps Ambrose left a message...but that would have been delivered long
  ago. And...if Ambrose had left any message, it would be to her. The will
  perhaps. The doctor had told them both that Ambrose had left his few
  possessions to Christina. She was glad of that. Yes, it must be the will.
  This served at any rate to explain Sir John's call.</p>

  <p>The appearance of a title at her front door caused Mrs. Colebrook
  considerable qualms. It was her fate never to be wearing a skirt appropriate
  to the social standing of distinguished visitors. Christina was lying down.
  She had had an interview with the osteopath in the morning and he had
  insisted upon twenty-four hours in bed. "Show him up, mother. He won't faint
  at the sight of a girl in bed...lawyers have a special training in that sort
  of thing."</p>

  <p>"He doesn't look like a lawyer," demurred Mrs. Colebrook; "he's a
  sir."</p>

  <p>She conducted the counsel upstairs with many warnings as to the lowness of
  roof and trickiness of tread. Mrs. Colebrook was resigned to the character
  and number of Christina's visitors and in that spirit of resignation left
  them.</p>

  <p>"We have met," said Sir John, and looked round for a chair.</p>

  <p>"Sit on the bed, Sir John," she laughed. "Evie broke the leg of the chair
  last night."</p>

  <p>He obeyed her, looking at her quizzically. "I saw Ronald Morelle at lunch
  today," he said. "I thought it best to see you&mdash;first. And let me get
  the will off my mind. It has been proved and there is a hundred or so to come
  to you. Ambrose was not well off, his salary in fact was ridiculously small.
  That, however, is by the way. I saw Ronnie."</p>

  <p>She returned his steady, searching gaze. "Did you talk to Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>"I talked to Ronnie," he nodded, "and Ronnie talked to me. Have you ever
  seen a man who had the odd habit of rubbing his chin with the back of his
  hand? I see that you have. Ronnie for example? Yes, I thought you would have
  noticed it."</p>

  <p>"How did you know that he had been to see me?"</p>

  <p>His thin hard face softened in a smile. "Who else would he have come to
  see?"</p>

  <p>"Beryl," she answered promptly, and he looked surprised. "Beryl? I know
  nothing of how he felt in that quarter. Beryl! How remarkable! I knew he
  would come here; if you had told me that you had not seen him, I should have
  thought I was..."</p>

  <p>She nodded. "That is how I felt, Sir John. I had to shake myself hard. It
  was like the kind of dream one has where you see somebody you know with
  somebody else's face. Yes, he came here. I had to have a glass of water."</p>

  <p>"I had brandy," said Sir John gravely. "As a rule I avoid
  stimulants&mdash;brandy produces a distressing palpitation of heart. Perhaps
  water would have been better for me. That is all, I think, Miss Christina."
  He picked up his hat. "I had to see you."</p>

  <p>"Do you think anybody knows or ought to know?" she asked. It was the
  question that had disturbed her.</p>

  <p>"They must find out. I have a reputation for being a hard-headed Scotsman.
  Why the heads of Scotsmen should be harder than any other kind of heads I do
  not know. What I mean is, that I cannot risk my credit as a man of truth, or
  my judgement as a man of law, or my status as one capable of conducting his
  own affairs without the assistance of a Commissioner in Lunacy&mdash;people
  must find out. I think they will, the interested people. Beryl, you say. Was
  he...fond of her? How astounding! She is to be married very soon, you know
  that?"</p>

  <p>"Should she be told? She may not have an opportunity of discovering for
  herself, Sir John."</p>

  <p>"What can you tell her?" he asked bluntly. She was silent. She had been
  asking herself that.</p>

  <p>Having ushered the visitor from the premises, Mrs. Colebrook joined her
  daughter, for immediately following Sir John had come a grimy little boy with
  a grimy little package. Mrs. Colebrook had spent an ecstatic five minutes in
  her kitchen revelling in the fruits of authorship. "I have got something to
  show you, Christina." She held the 'something' coyly under her apron. "It was
  my own idea. I didn't expect them so soon...came just after I'd left you and
  Sir What's-his-name."</p>

  <p>"What is it, mother?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook drew from its place of concealment a double-leafed card. It
  was edged with black, and heavy Gothic type was its most conspicuous
  feature.</p>

  <p>Christina read: 'In loving memory of AMBROSE SAULT, Who departed this life
  on March 17th, 19&mdash;At the age of 53. Mourned by all who knew him. "We
  ne'er shall see his gentle smile, Or hear his voice again, Yet in a very
  little while, We'll meet him once again." Christina put down the card.</p>

  <p>"I made that up myself," said Mrs. Colebrook proudly&mdash;"all except the
  poetry, which I copied from poor Aunt Elizabeth's funeral card. I think that
  verse is beautiful."</p>

  <p>"I think it is prophetic," said Christina, and added inconsequently, as
  Mrs. Colebrook thought, "I wonder if Ronnie is coming to-day?"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap51"
     name="chap51">CHAPTER LI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RONNIE had some such idea when he parted from Maxton and the
  doctor. He went home to collect the bundle of books he had packed ready to
  take to Christina, and there discovered the reason why his absent-minded host
  had forgotten to put in an appearance. Mr. Jerry Talbot was stretched
  exhaustedly in a lounge-chair. He was a sallow young man with a large nose
  and a microscopic moustache. He had bushy eyebrows, arched inquiringly. Only
  one eyebrow was now visible. The other and the greater part of his slick head
  was hidden under black silk bandages. Looking at him, Ronnie wondered what he
  had ever seen in the man. "'Lo, Ronnie," he greeted the other feebly. "I
  tried to 'phone you but you were gone. I had a sort of faint after I spoke to
  you this morning, that's why I didn't turn up; so sorry. But look at me, old
  boy, look at me!"</p>

  <p>"How did this happen?" asked Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"Lola!" Ronnie frowned. Lola? Who...Yes, yes, Lola. He remembered. "We had
  rather a difficult time at my house last night, and Madame sent some of the
  girls along. Lola got excited, and after some argument about a brooch that
  one of my guests had lost, Lola picked up a champagne bottle and&mdash;there
  you are!"</p>

  <p>"Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"In quod," said Mr. Jerry Talbot viciously. "I gave her in charge, and
  Ronnie, she had the brooch! They found it at the police station. So I was
  right when I called her a thieving little&mdash;whatever it was I called her.
  It is an awkward business for me, old thing, but of course I'm swearing
  blue-blind that I never invited her and that she came in without...sort of
  drifted in from the street. Madame put me up to that. She's fed up with Lola,
  and so are the other girls."</p>

  <p>"Just wait a moment," said Ronnie, frowning. "Do I understand that Madame
  is going to disown this girl&mdash;this, what is her name...?"</p>

  <p>"Lola," scoffed Mr. Talbot. "Good heavens, you're not pretending that you
  don't know her! And you took her to Wechester with you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course I did," agreed Ronnie "It is rather terrible work...
  straightening out the ravel of life...Yes, I know her."</p>

  <p>"Madame is disowning her, and so are the other girls. Between ourselves,
  Ritti has cleared out everything of Lola's and sent her trunks to a baggage
  office. None of her maids will talk, and naturally none of the people who go
  to Ritti's. Lola has had a tip to shut up about Madame's, and if she is wise,
  she'll admit she's a street girl who had the cheek to walk into the party. I
  had to tell you, Ronnie, in case this infernal girl mentions you. She is
  being brought before the magistrate this afternoon."</p>

  <p>And so came Lola from the dingy cells with her evening finery looking
  somewhat bedraggled, and standing in the pen, pale and defiant, heard the
  charge of assault preferred against her. "Have you any witnesses to
  call?"</p>

  <p>"None. All my witnesses have been standing on the box committing perjury,"
  sobbed the girl, broken at last. "I was invited...Mr. Talbot sent for me...
  he sent to Madame Ritti's..."</p>

  <p>"Madame Ritti says that she hardly knows you. That with the exception of a
  few days last year, when you were staying with her, you have never been to
  the house," said the patient magistrate. "She made you leave her, because she
  found you were an undesirable."</p>

  <p>"Your worship, there is a gentleman here who wishes to give evidence,"
  said the usher. Ronald Morelle stepped to the stand, smiled faintly at the
  open-mouthed surprise of Jerry Talbot, at the shocked amazement of Madame
  Ritti, and bowed to the magistrate. He gave his name, place of living, and
  occupation.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Morelle, what can you tell us?" demanded the magistrate
  benevolently.</p>

  <p>"I know this girl"&mdash;he indicated the interested prisoner&mdash;"her
  name is Lola Prandeaux, or rather that is the name by which she is known. She
  is an inmate of a house"&mdash;he did not say 'house' and Madame Ritti almost
  jumped from her seat at his description&mdash;"maintained by Madame Ritti. I
  can also assure your worship that she is very well known to the prosecutor,
  Mr. Talbot, and to me. I have taken her away into the country on more than
  one occasion. To my knowledge she was invited last night to Mr. Talbot's
  house. There is no reason why she should steal a trumpery brooch. She has
  jewels of her own. I myself gave her the solitaire ring she is now
  wearing."</p>

  <p>The magistrate glared at Jerry Talbot. "Are you pressing this charge?" The
  man of law wrote furiously upon a paper.</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;no, your honour&mdash;worship," stammered Jerry.</p>

  <p>"You may go away, Prandeaux, you are discharged. I have heard a
  considerable amount of perjury in this case and I have heard the truth...not
  very pleasant truth, I admit. Mr. Morelle has testified for the accused with
  great frankness which I can admire...His habits and behaviour are less
  admirable. Next case!"</p>

  <p>Ronnie was the last of the party to leave the court. Lola came hurriedly
  across the waiting-room to clasp his hand. "Oh, Ronnie, you...pal! How lovely
  of you! I never thought you were such a brick! Madame looked like
  hell&mdash;she's pinched all my jewellery and now she'll have to give it
  up...Ronnie, how can I thank you?"</p>

  <p>"Lola...come to my flat, I want to talk to you." Francois, who opened the
  door to them, was not surprised. After all, one could not expect Ronald
  Morelle to improve in every respect. It was a pleasure to work for him, he
  was so considerate. Lola settled herself in the most comfortable corner of
  the settee and waited for Francois to go.</p>

  <p>"You will have some tea?" Ronnie gave the order to a servant who was no
  less surprised than Lola.</p>

  <p>"What have you done with that picture that was over the mantelpiece?"
  asked the girl, seeing a blankness of wall. "I've burnt it," said Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"But it was worth thousands, Ronnie! You told me so."</p>

  <p>"It was worth a few hundreds. If it had been a Titian I would not have
  destroyed it&mdash;it had its use in a gallery. But it was not. Worth a few
  hundreds perhaps...I burnt it. Francois cut it into strips and we burnt it in
  the furnace fire. Francois and I had a great day. He did not think the
  picture was pretty."</p>

  <p>"It was your favourite."</p>

  <p>"Was it?" He was astonished. "Well, it is burnt. It is too ugly. The
  subject...no, the figures were a little ugly. Now Lola, what are you going to
  do?"</p>

  <p>She had half made up her mind. "I shall take a flat&mdash;" He shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"In a way, I have a recollection that you told me you had relations in
  Cornwall. Was I dreaming? And you said that when you had saved enough money
  you were going to buy a farm in Cornwall and raise hackneys. Was that a
  dream?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No, that is my dream," she said, "but what is the use
  of talking about that, Ronnie. It would cost a small fortune."</p>

  <p>"Could you do it on five thousand?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"With my money and five thousand...yes."</p>

  <p>"I will lend you three thousand free of all interest, and I will give you
  two thousand. I won't give it all to you, because I want a hold on you. Easy
  money spends itself. Will you go to Cornwall, Lola?"</p>

  <p>Francois, entering, saved him from her hectic embrace. "You're just...
  wonderful." She dabbed her eyes. "I know you think I'm dirt and I
  am&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't be silly. Why should I think that? I am not even sorry for you. Are
  you sorry for the train that is derailed? You put it back on the track. That
  is what I am doing. I am one of the derailers. It amused me, it hurt you...
  oh yes, it did...I know I was not 'the first', there would be an excuse for
  me in that event. We are all dirt if it comes to that&mdash;dirt is matter in
  the wrong place. I want to put you where you belong."</p>

  <p>She was incoherent in her gratitude, awed a little by his seriousness and
  detachment, prodigiously surprised that Francois remained on duty. When, on
  her way to the hotel which was to shelter her, she read the evening
  newspaper, she could appreciate more fully just what Ronnie had done...</p>

  <p>"Read this!" said Evie tragically.</p>

  <p>Christina took the newspaper from her hands. "'A curious case'...is that
  what you mean?" The report was a full one, remembering how late in the day
  the charge had come up for hearing. "Well?" said Christina, when she had
  finished reading.</p>

  <p>"I shall write to Ronald." Evie was very stiff, very determined, sourly
  virginal. "Of course, you can't believe all that you read in the newspapers,
  but there is no smoke without fire."</p>

  <p>"And every cloud has its silver lining," said Christina. "Let us all be
  trite! What is worrying you, Evie? I think it was fine of Ronnie to look
  after the girl."</p>

  <p>"And they drove away from the court together!" wailed Evie.</p>

  <p>"Why not? It is much better to go together than by taking separate routes
  and pretending they weren't meeting when all the time they were."</p>

  <p>"I shall write to Ronnie. I must have an explanation." Evie was firm on
  this point. Christina read the account again. "I don't see what other
  explanation you can ask," she said. "He has said all that is fit for
  publication."</p>

  <p>"What is this woman Lola to him?" demanded Evie furiously. "How dare he
  stand up...shamelessly...and admit...oh, Chris, it is awful!"</p>

  <p>"It must be pretty awful for Lola, too," said Christina.</p>

  <p>"That sort of girl doesn't mind...she likes to have her name in the
  paper."</p>

  <p>"You don't know," said Christina. "I won't descend to slopping over her
  poor mother, and her innocent sisters, and I'd die before I'd remind you that
  once she was like the beautiful snow. Ambrose always said that there was a
  lot of sympathy wasted over sinners. It is conceivable that she was quite a
  decent sort until somebody came along who held artistic views about marriage;
  most of these girls start that way, their minds go first. They get full of
  that advanced stuff. Some of 'em go vegetarian and wear sandals; some of 'em
  do worse. But that is how they start: they reach the streets in their own
  way. Some get into the studio party set. They bob their hair and hate
  washing. They know people who have black wallpaper and scarlet ceilings and
  one white rose rising from a jade vase. Evie, I have been lying on the flat
  of my back ever since I can remember, and I've had a procession of sinners
  marching around my bed&mdash;literally. Mother let people come because I was
  dull. I don't know Lola. She is a little above us, but Lola's kind are bred
  around here by the score, pigging four and five in a room; they have no
  reticences, there are no mysteries. All the processes of life are familiar to
  them as children. Then one fine day along comes Mrs. So-and-So and sits on
  the end of this bed and weeps and weeps until mother turns her out. There was
  a woman in this road who broke her heart over her daughter's disgrace. And
  when they came to bury the good lady they found she had never been married
  herself! All this weeping and wailing and talking about 'disgrace' doesn't
  mean anything in this neighbourhood. It is conventional, expected of them,
  like deep mourning for widows and half mourning for aunts. We haven't
  produced many celebrities...We had a chorus girl who was in a divorce case,
  and there is a legend that Tota Belindo, the great Spanish dancer, came from
  the streets. We turn out the tired old-looking girls that you never see up
  West. The Lolas come from families that care. Nice speaking people who
  haven't been taught to write by a sign-writer. I've heard about them and met
  one. She used to drink, that is how she came to Walter Street. That kind of
  girl only pretends she doesn't care. She isn't like the hardy race of
  prostitutes we raise in Walter Street."</p>

  <p>"I think your language is terrible, Christina! I ought to know you would
  defend this perfectly awful girl. You take a very lax view, Chris; it is a
  good thing I have a well-balanced mind..."</p>

  <p>"You haven't," said Christina. "It isn't a month ago that you were
  sneering about marriage. I believe in marriage: I'm old-fashioned. Marriage
  is a wonderful bridge, it carries you over the time when, if you're not
  married, you are getting used to a strange man and comparing him unfavourably
  with your last. Besides, it is easier to divorce a man than to run away from
  him. Divorce is so easy that there is no excuse for remaining single."</p>

  <p>"I don't know whether you're being decent or not, Christina. But there are
  some people who have never married all their lives, and they've been
  perfectly happy...of course, I can't tell you who they are, it is absurd to
  ask me. Only I know that there have been such people...in history, I mean. I
  believe in marriage, but it is much worse to be married to somebody you don't
  love than to be living with a man you do love."</p>

  <p>"There are times when you remind me of Uncle Tom's Cabin," mused
  Christina. "I wonder why...oh yes, little Eva who said such damnably true
  things so very truly. She died. The book had to have a happy ending, anyway.
  Eva&mdash;Evie, I mean, I should write to your slave-master and demand an
  explanation. I'll bet you won't, though!"</p>

  <p>"Won't I?" Evie stiffened. "I have my self-respect to consider, Christina,
  and my friends...I hope Teddy hasn't read the case."</p>

  <p>She wrote a letter, many words of which were underlined, and notes of
  exclamation stood up on each page like the masts of docked shipping. Ronnie's
  answer was waiting for her next night. 'Will you come to the flat, Evie?'</p>

  <p>Evie did not consult her sister; she took a lank young man into her
  confidence. Would he escort her and wait in the vestibule of the flats until
  she came out? Evie had discovered the need for a chaperon.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap52"
     name="chap52">CHAPTER LII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">Francois opened the door and Evie walked hesitatingly into
  the lobby. Ronnie was at his table and he was writing. He got up at once and
  came to meet her with outstretched hand.</p>

  <p>"It was good of you to come, Evie."</p>

  <p>She started. His voice was so changed&mdash;his expression, too. Something
  had come into his face that was not there before. A vitality, an eagerness, a
  good humour. She was startled into, beginning on a personal note.</p>

  <p>"Why, Ronnie dear, you have changed!"</p>

  <p>She did not recognise how far she had departed from a certain programme
  and agenda she had drawn up. Item number one was not to call Ronnie
  'dear'.</p>

  <p>"Have I?" He flashed a smile at her as he pushed a chair forward and put a
  cushion at her back.</p>

  <p>"Your voice even&mdash;have you had a cold?"</p>

  <p>"No. I am getting old." He chuckled at the jest. Ronnie did not as a rule
  laugh at himself. "I had your letter about Lola. I thought it best that you
  should come. Yes, Evie, all that as in the paper was true. I know Lola."</p>

  <p>"And she has been...all that you said, to you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes." His voice was a little dreary. "Yes, all that." She sat tight-
  lipped, trying to feel more angry than she did. ('Be very angry' was item two
  on the agenda.) "I'm sorry that you had to know; you are so young, and these
  things are very shocking to a good woman. Lola has gone back to her people.
  Naturally I did not wish to appear in a police court, but there was a
  conspiracy to send this girl to prison. A late friend of mine was in it. I
  had to go to the court and tell the truth."</p>

  <p>"I think it was very fine of you." She echoed Christina's words, but was
  wanting in Christina's enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"Fine? I don't know. It was a great nuisance. I have an unpleasant feeling
  about courts." He rubbed his chin: Evie saw nothing remarkable in the
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"Of course, Ronnie," she began, labouring under the disadvantage of
  calmness, for she could not feel angry, "this makes a difference. I was
  prepared to sacrifice everything...my good name; and what people thought
  about me...It was horrible of you, Ronnie...to take that girl into the
  country when...when you knew me. I can't forgive that, Ronnie."</p>

  <p>He stood by his table, his white hand drumming silently. "Did you come
  alone?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She hesitated. "No, I brought a friend. A gentleman. I used to know him
  when I was a child."</p>

  <p>Ronnie looked at her searchingly. His eyes were soft and kind. "Evie, I
  will tell you something. From the day I first met you I intended no good to
  you. When I arranged that we should go to Italy, to Palermo, I knew in my
  wicked mind that you would grow tired of me." He put it that way, though he
  was loath to tell even so small a lie. "Since...since I saw you last, I have
  been thinking of you, thinking very tenderly of you, Evie. I have always
  liked you; Christina and I have discussed you by the hour."</p>

  <p>"But...you have never seen Christina until this week, Ronnie!"</p>

  <p>Ronnie's hand went to his chin. "Haven't I?" He was troubled. "I
  thought...let me say I have dreamt of those discussions. I dream a great deal
  nowadays. Queer, ugly dreams...I woke this morning when the clock was
  striking nine...I felt so sad."</p>

  <p>He seemed to forget her presence, for he did not speak for a time. He had
  seated himself on the edge of the desk, one polished boot swinging, and he
  was looking past her with an intensity of gaze that made her turn to see the
  thing that attracted him.</p>

  <p>Her movement roused him, and he stammered his apologies. Taking courage
  from his confusion, Evie delivered herself of the predication which she had
  not had courage to rehearse. "Ronnie, I think we've both made a great
  mistake. I like you awfully. I don't think I could like a friend more. But I
  don't feel...well, you can see for yourself that we're not the same way of
  thinking. Don't imagine I'm a prude. I'm very broad-minded about that sort of
  thing, but you can see for yourself..."</p>

  <p>He saw very clearly for himself, and held out his hand. "Friends?" he
  asked,</p>

  <p>She experienced a thrill of one who creditably performs a great
  renunciation without any distress to herself. "Friends!" she said
  solemnly.</p>

  <p>Ronnie walked round to his writing-chair and sat down. She found
  satisfaction in the tremor of the hand that opened a portfolio on his desk.
  "And you're not hurt?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"No, Ronnie."</p>

  <p>"Thank God for that," said Ronald Morelle. He was looking in the black
  case. Presently he pulled out half a dozen photographs and passed them across
  to her.</p>

  <p>"How perfectly lovely!" she said.</p>

  <p>"Yes; in some respects more lovely than Palermo. And there are no
  earthquakes and no rumblings from old Etna." She was looking at the
  photographs of a white villa that seemed to be built in the side of a hill.
  One picture showed a riotous garden, another a lawn with great shady trees
  and deep basket-chairs. "That is my house at Beaulieu," said Ronnie. "I want
  you to help me with that." She looked at him, ready to reprove. "Your mother
  is the very woman to run that house, and the garden was made for
  Christina."</p>

  <p>Her mouth opened. "Not you!" she gasped. "You aren't the man who wants a
  housekeeper! Oh, Ronnie!"</p>

  <p>"I haven't photographs of the Palermo villa. I have sent for some. An
  ideal place for a honeymoon, Evie." He came round to the back of her chair
  and dropped his hand on her shoulder lightly. "When you marry a nice man you
  shall go there for your honeymoon. God love you!"</p>

  <p>She took his hand and laid it against her cheek. For the fraction of a
  second..."I like Beaulieu, Ronnie, the house is a beauty...perhaps if I
  hurried I could go there before mother."</p>

  <p>In the hall below Mr. Teddy Williams discussed Canada with the hall
  porter. It was one of the two subjects in which he was completely interested.
  The other came down by the elevator importantly, and they went out into
  Knightsbridge together. "I've been a long time, Teddy'&mdash;she snuggled her
  arm in his&mdash;"but...well, first of all, my answer is 'Yes'." He paused,
  and in the view of revolted passers-by, kissed her. "And...Teddy, we'll go to
  Beaulieu afterwards...Mr. Morelle has promised to let us have his house."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that grand!" said Teddy. "We've got a town called Beaulieu in
  Saskatchewan..."</p>

  <h2><a id="chap53"
     name="chap53">CHAPTER LIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">WASN'T it just like Christina not to get excited with the
  great news? But really Evie was to blame, because she kept the greater news
  to the last. "I can't believe it! That young man who called on Christina? I
  really can't believe it," said Mrs. Colebrook, who could, and did, believe
  it.</p>

  <p>"Why don't you yell, Chris?" demanded her indignant sister.</p>

  <p>"I am yelling," said Christina placidly. "I've been yelling longer than
  you, for I knew that it was Ronnie's house when the letter came." But the
  announcement of Evie's engagement had an electrifying effect.</p>

  <p>"That is the first time I have ever seen Christina cry," said Mrs.
  Colebrook, with melancholy satisfaction. "There's a lot more in Christina
  than people think. If she'd only showed a little more nice feeling over poor
  Mr. Sault, I'd have liked it better. But you can't expect anything in these
  days, girls being what they are. Well, Evie, you're the first to go...I don't
  suppose Christina will ever marry. She's too hard. Canada won't seem so far
  if I'm in Bolo, Boole .. whatever they call it."</p>

  <p>Evie was sitting with her mother in the kitchen; from Christina's room
  came crooning: "My dear, oh, my dear. Have ye come from the west...?"</p>

  <p>"Why Christina sings those old-fashioned songs when she knows 'Swanee' and
  'The Bull Dog Patrol'...'Bull Frog', is it?...I can't understand." A rat- tat
  at the door made Evie jump. Mrs. Colebrook's eyes went to the faded face of a
  clock on the mantelshelf. Allowing for day to day variation, to which the
  timepiece was subject, she made it out to be past eleven. "Don't open the
  door," she said. "It may be those Haggins&mdash;they've been fighting all
  day."</p>

  <p>Evie went to the door. "Who is there?"</p>

  <p>"Beryl Merville." Evie opened the door and admitted the girl. Outside she
  glimpsed the tail-lamps of a car. "You are Evie, aren't you?" Beryl was
  breathless. "Have you any idea where I can find Ronnie?"</p>

  <p>"Is that Beryl?" It was Christina's voice; she had come down in her
  dressing-gown.</p>

  <p>"I want to find Ronnie&mdash;I have been to his flat, he is not at home. I
  must see him." She was wild with fear, Christina saw that; something had
  happened which had thrown her off her balance and had driven her, frantic, to
  Ronnie Morelle.</p>

  <p>"Come up to my room, Beryl," she said gently.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Colebrook looked at Evie as the sound of a closing door came down.
  "It looks to me like a scandal," she said profoundly. Evie said nothing. She
  was wondering whether she ought not to have been indignant at the suggestion
  that she knew the whereabouts of Ronnie Morelle. She wished she knew Beryl
  better...then she might have been asked upstairs to share the secret. After
  all, she knew Ronnie better than anybody.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am better out of it, mother," she said. "I am not sure that
  Teddy would like me to be mixed up in other people's affairs..."</p>

  <p>Christina pushed the trembling girl on to the bed. "Sit down, Beryl. What
  is wrong?"</p>

  <p>Beryl's lips were quivering. "I must see Ronnie...oh, Christina, I'm just
  cornered. That man...Talbot, I think his name is, he is a friend of Ronnie's,
  has written to father...the letter came by hand, marked 'Urgent', whilst
  daddy was out, and I opened it."</p>

  <p>She fumbled in her bag and produced a folded sheet, and Christina
  read:</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Dr. Merville, I think it is only right that you should
  know that your daughter spent a night at Ronald Morelle's flat. Miss
  Merville, at Morelle's suggestion, told you that she had been to a ball at
  Albert Hall. I can prove that she was never at the Albert Hall that night. I
  feel it is my duty to tell you this, and I expect you to inform Mr. Steppe,
  who, I understand, is engaged to your daughter.</p>

  <p>"How did he know?"</p>

  <p>Beryl shook her head wearily. "Ronald told him...about the ball. When the
  elevator was going down, the morning I left the flat, I saw a man walking up
  the stairs. He must have seen me. Ronnie told me the night before that
  Jeremiah Talbot was coming to breakfast with him. I just saw him as the lift
  passed him&mdash;he had stopped on the landing below Ronnie's and probably
  recognized me. Christina, what am I to do? Father mustn't know. It seems ever
  so much more important to me now."</p>

  <p>"When do you marry, Beryl?"</p>

  <p>"The day after tomorrow. I know Ronnie has quarrelled with the man. I read
  that story in the newspapers. It was splendid of Ronnie, splendid. It was a
  revelation to me."</p>

  <p>Christina bit her lip in thought. "I will see Ronnie&mdash;tonight. No, I
  will go alone. I have been resting all day. You must go home. Have you
  brought your car? Good. I will borrow it. Give me the letter." Beryl
  protested, but the girl was firm. "You must not go...perhaps I am wrong about
  Ronnie, but I don't think so. Sir John Maxton has the same mad dream."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>Christina smiled. "One day I will tell you."</p>

  <p>The vision of her daughter dressed for going out temporarily deprived Mrs.
  Colebrook of speech. Before she could frame adequate comment, Christina was
  gone. She dropped Beryl at her house and drove to Knightsbridge. The porter
  was not sure whether Mr. Morelle was in or out. It was his duty to be
  uncertain. He took her up to Ronnie's floor and waited until the door
  opened.</p>

  <p>"My dear, what brings you here at this hour?" He had been out, he told
  her. A Royal Society lecture on Einstein's Theory had been absorbing. He was
  so full of the subject, so alive, so boyish in his interest, that for a while
  he forgot the hour and the obvious urgency of her call. "I love lectures," he
  laughed, "but you know that. Do you remember how I was so late last night
  that your mother locked me out...no, not your mother...it must have been
  Francois." He frowned heavily. "How curious that I should confuse Francois
  with your dear mother."</p>

  <p>She listened eagerly, delightedly, forgetting, too, the matter that
  brought her. The phenomenon had no terror for her, tremendous though it
  was.</p>

  <p>He was the first to recall himself to the present. "From Beryl?" he said
  quickly. "What is wrong?"</p>

  <p>She handed him the letter and he read it carefully. "How terrible!" he
  said in a hushed voice. "How appallingly terrible! He says she is marrying
  Steppe! That can't be true, either. It would be grotesque..."</p>

  <p>She was on the point of telling him that the marriage was due for the
  second day, when he went abruptly into his room. He returned carrying his
  overcoat, which he put on as he talked. "The past can only be patched," he
  said, "and seldom patched to look like new. Omar crystallizes its
  irrevocability in his great stanza. We can no more 'shatter it to bits' than
  'remould it nearer to our heart's desire'."</p>

  <p>"Ronnie, Beryl is to be married the day after tomorrow."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" He looked at her with a half-smile, and then at the clock. It
  was a minute past midnight. "Tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>She nodded. "Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"To see Talbot. He acted according to his lights. You can't expect a
  cockerel to sing like a lark. There is no sense in getting angry because
  things do not behave unnaturally. I made him feel very badly towards me
  yesterday. I think he can be adjusted. Some problems can be solved; some must
  be scrapped. Have you a car?...Beryl's, good! Will you drop me in Curzon
  Street?"</p>

  <p>She asked him no further questions, and when in the car he held her hand
  in his, she felt beautifully peaceful and content. "Good night, Christina...
  I will see Beryl tomorrow."</p>

  <p>He closed the car door softly and she saw him knocking at No. 703 as she
  drove away.</p>

  <p>The door was opened almost immediately.</p>

  <p>"Is Mr. Talbot in, Brien?"</p>

  <p>The butler stared.</p>

  <p>"Why&mdash;why, yes, Mr. Morelle," he stammered.</p>

  <p>He had not waited at table these past two days without discovering that
  Ronald Morelle was a name to be mentioned to the accompaniment of blasphemous
  etceteras. "He is in bed...I was just locking up. Does he expect you, Mr.
  Morelle?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Ronnie. "All right, Brien, I know my way up." He left an
  apprehensive servant standing irresolutely in the hall.</p>

  <p>Jeremiah was not in bed. He was in his dressing-gown before a mirror, and
  his face was mottled with patches of grey mud&mdash;a cosmetic designed to
  remove wrinkles from tired eyes. Ronnie he saw reflected in the mirror.
  "What...what the devil do you want?" he demanded hollowly. "What are you
  doing?"</p>

  <p>"Locking the door," said Ronnie, and threw the key on to the pillow of a
  four-poster bed.</p>

  <p>"Damn you&mdash;open that door...you sneaking cad!" Mr. Talbot experienced
  a difficulty in breathing, his voice was a little beyond his control. Also
  the plaster at the corner of his mouth made articulation difficult.</p>

  <p>"I've come to see you on rather a pressing matter," said Ronnie evenly.
  "You wrote a letter to Dr. Merville, making a very serious charge against my
  friend, Miss Merville. I do not complain and I certainly do not intend
  abusing you. I may kill you; that is very likely. I hope it will not be
  necessary. If you shout or make a noise I shall certainly kill you, because,
  as you will see, being an intelligent man, I cannot afford to let you live
  until your servants come."</p>

  <p>Mr. Talbot sat down suddenly, a comical figure, the more so since the
  dried mud about his eyes and the corner of his mouth made it impossible that
  he should express his intense fear. As it was, he spoke with difficulty and
  without opening his mouth wider than the mud allowed. "You shall pay for
  this, Morelle...by God!"</p>

  <p>"I want you to write me a letter which I shall give to Miss Merville
  apologising for your insulting note to the doctor..." With a gurgle of rage,
  Talbot sprang at him. Ronnie half-turned and struck twice. The butler heard
  the thud of a falling body; it shook the house. Still he hesitated. "Get up,"
  said Ronnie. "I am afraid I have dislocated your beauty spots, Jerry, but
  you'll be able to talk more freely."</p>

  <p>Mr. Talbot nursed his jaw but continued to sit on the floor. His jaw was
  aching and his head was going round and round. But he was an intelligent man.
  When he did get up he opened a writing-bureau and, at Ronnie's dictation,
  wrote.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Jerry." Ronnie pocketed the letter. "Perhaps when I have gone
  you will regret having written and will complain to the police; you may even
  write a worse letter to the doctor&mdash;who hasn't seen your first epistle,
  by the way. I must risk that. If you do, I shall certainly destroy you. I
  shall be sorry because...well, because I don't think you deserve death. You
  can be adjusted. Most people can. Will you put a stamp on the envelope,
  Jerry?"</p>

  <p>At the street door: "Perhaps you will lose your job because you have
  admitted me, Brien. If that happens, will you come to me, please?" The dazed
  butler said he would.</p>

  <p>Ronnie stopped at a pillar-box to post the letter and walked home.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap54"
     name="chap54">CHAPTER LIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JAN STEPPE was an early riser. He was up at six; at seven
  o'clock he was at his desk with the contents of the morning newspapers
  completely digested. By the time most people were sleepily inquiring the
  state of the weather, he had dealt with his correspondence and had prepared
  his daily plan. In view of his early departure from London he had cleared off
  such arrears of work as there was. It was very little, for his method did not
  admit of an accumulation of unsettled affairs. A man not easily troubled, he
  bad been of late considerably perturbed by the erratic behaviour of certain
  stocks. He had every reason to be satisfied, on the whole, because a miracle
  had happened. Klein River Diamonds had soared to an unbelievable price. A new
  pipe had been discovered on the property and the shares had jumped to one
  hundred and twelve, which would have been a fortunate development for Dr.
  Merville, who once held a large parcel, had not Steppe purchased his entire
  holding at fifteen. He did this before the news was made public that the pipe
  had been located; before Steppe himself knew&mdash;as he swore, sitting
  within a yard of the code telegram from his South African agent that had
  brought him the news twenty-four hours before it was published.</p>

  <p>So that the doctor was in this position: he owed money to Steppe on shares
  which had brought his associate a fortune. Ronnie had had a large holding. He
  was deputy chairman of the company. The day following the execution of
  Ambrose Sault, Steppe sent him a peremptory note enclosing a transfer and a
  cheque. Ronnie put cheque and transfer away in a drawer and did not read the
  letter. For some extraordinary reason on that day he could not read easily.
  Letters frightened him and he had to summon all his will-power to examine
  them. Nearly a week passed before he got over this strange repugnance to the
  written word.</p>

  <p>In the meantime Jan Steppe had not seen his lieutenant. He never doubted
  that that transfer, signed and sealed, was registered in the books of the
  company. Ronnie was obedient; had signed transfers by the score without
  question. On this morning of March, Mr. Steppe was delayed in the conduct of
  his business by the tardy arrival of the mail. There had been a heavy fog in
  the early hours and letter distribution had been delayed, so that it was well
  after half-past eight before the mail came to him. Almost the first letter he
  opened was one from the secretary of Klein River. He read and growled.</p>

  <p>The writer was sorry that he could not carry out the definite instructions
  which he had received. Apparently Mr. Steppe was under a misapprehension. No
  shares held by Mr. Morelle had been transferred. There was a postscript in
  the secretary's handwriting: <i>'I have reason to believe that Mr. Morelle
  had been selling your stocks very heavily. He is certainly the principal
  operator in the attack upon Midwell Tractions which you complained about
  yesterday...'</i></p>

  <p>Jan Steppe, dropping the letter, pushed his chair back from the desk. A
  thousand shares in Klein River were at issue; he could not afford to tear
  bull-headed at Ronnie Morelle. So this was the bear...the seller of stock!
  Ronnie had done something like this before, and had been warned. Steppe let
  his fury cool before he got Merville on the wire. When, in answer to the
  summons, Merville arrived, Steppe was pacing the floor, his hands deep in his
  trousers pockets. "Huh, Merville? Seen Ronald Morelle lately?"</p>

  <p>"No; he hasn't been to the house for a very long time."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't, huh? Like him?"</p>

  <p>The doctor hesitated. "Not particularly; he is a distant cousin of mine.
  You know that."</p>

  <p>Steppe nodded. He was holding himself in check and the effort was a
  strain. "He's selling Midwell Tractions; you know that?" he mimicked
  savagely. "I'll break him, Merville! Smash him! The cur, the crafty cur!" He
  gained the upper hand of his tumultuous rage after a while. "That doesn't
  matter. But I sent him a cheque and a transfer&mdash;one minute!" He seized
  the telephone and shouted a number. "Yes, Steppe. Has a cheque been passed
  through payable to Ronald Morelle...I'll give you the number if you wait." He
  jerked out a drawer, found the stub of the cheque-book and turned the
  counterfoil. "There? March 17th. Cheque number L.V. 971842." He waited at the
  telephone, scowling absent-mindedly at the doctor. "Huh? It hasn't been
  presented...all right." He smashed the receiver down on the hook. "If he had
  paid in the cheque I would have got him&mdash;the swine! But he hasn't. I
  sent orders to transfer his Klein Rivers. I thought I was doing him a good
  turn&mdash;just as I thought I was doing one for you, Merville."</p>

  <p>"And he refused to allow you to make the sacrifice," said the doctor
  dryly.</p>

  <p>"I don't like that kind of talk, Merville." Steppe's face was dark with
  anger. "I want you to come with me. I'm going to see this...this Thing. And
  I'm going to get the transfer! Make no mistake about that! Call up the filthy
  hound and tell him you are coming round. Don't mention me. It will give him a
  chance of getting rid of his women." He listened to the telephone
  conversation that followed. "What was he saying?"</p>

  <p>"He asked me if there was anything wrong. It struck me that he was
  anxious&mdash;he asked me twice."</p>

  <p>"That fellow has an instinct for trouble," said Steppe.</p>

  <p>Ronnie was dressed, which was unusual for him, at this early hour. And the
  doctor noticed, could hardly help noticing, that the library was gay with
  flowers. This also was remarkable, for Ronnie disliked to have flowers in a
  room. There were daffodils, perce-neige, bowls of violets, and through the
  open casement with its curtains fluttering in the stiff breeze, Merville saw
  new window-boxes ablaze with tulips.</p>

  <p>"You're admiring my flowers, Bertram," smiled Ronnie. "I had to buy them
  ready-grown, and the gentleman who owns the flat has misgivings as to the
  wisdom of flower-boxes...he thinks they may fall on to somebody's head. Good
  morning, Steppe, you look happy." Mr. Steppe was looking and feeling quite
  the reverse. He forced his face into a contortion intended to be a smile.
  "Good morning, Ronnie. I thought I'd come along and see you about the
  transfer I sent to you. You forgot to fill it up."</p>

  <p>"Did I?" Ronnie was genuinely surprised. "I remember I had a letter from
  you..." He took a heap of papers from a drawer, and as he turned them over,
  Steppe's eyes lit up. "That's it," he said, and off-handedly, "put your name
  against the seal." Ronnie took up a pen...and paused. "I am transferring a
  thousand shares in the Klein River Diamond Mining Corporation...at twelve.
  They are worth more than that, surely? I thought I saw them quoted at a
  hundred and something?"</p>

  <p>"They were twelve when I sent you the transfer," said Steppe.</p>

  <p>"Why did you send it?...I don't remember expressing a wish to sell?"</p>

  <p>Here Steppe made a fatal mistake. He had but to say 'You agreed to sell'
  and Ronnie would have signed. There were some incidents in his past life that
  he could not remember. But the temper of the big man got the better of him.
  "You're not expected to ask!" he roared, bringing his big fist down on the
  table with a crash. "You're expected to do as you're told! Get that, Morelle!
  I sent you the transfer and a cheque..."</p>

  <p>"This must be the cheque," said Ronnie. He looked at the oblong slip and
  tore it into four pieces before he dropped the scraps into the waste-basket.
  Steppe was purple with rage, inarticulate. Then the transfer followed the
  cheque. "Don't let us have a scene," said Dr. Merville nervously. "You must
  meet Steppe in this, Ronnie."</p>

  <p>"I'll meet him with pleasure. I have a thousand shares apparently; he
  wants them&mdash;good! He can pay me the market price."</p>

  <p>"You dog!" howled Steppe, his face thrust across the table until it was
  within a few inches of Ronnie's. "You damned swindler! You're going straight
  to the office of the Klein River Company and sign another transfer. D'ye
  hear?"</p>

  <p>"How could I not hear?" said Ronnie, getting up. "As to signing the
  transfer, I will do so, on terms&mdash;if you are civil."</p>

  <p>"If I'm civil, huh? If I'm civil? I'll break you, Morelle! I'll break you!
  There's a little document in my safe that would get you five years. That
  makes you look foolish!"</p>

  <p>"Take it out of your safe," said Ronnie coolly, "which I understand the
  police have. They will be glad to see it opened. I could open it myself if...
  if I could only remember. I've tried. When I saw a paragraph in the paper
  about Moropulos it made me shiver...because I knew I could open the safe. I
  sat up all one night trying to get the word."</p>

  <p>"You're a liar...the same damned liar that you've always been! I want that
  transfer, Morelle. I'm through with you&mdash;after your appearance in the
  police court. You're a damned fine asset to a company, you and your Lola! You
  will resign from the board of my companies. Get that? And whilst I'm dealing
  with you, I'd like to tell you that if you attack my stocks I'll attack you
  in a way that will make hell a cosy corner, huh?" His hand shot out and he
  gripped Ronnie. "Come here&mdash;you! D'ye hear me? I'll..."</p>

  <p>Ronnie took the hand that grasped his collar and prised loose the fingers;
  he did this without apparent effort. The fingers had to release their hold or
  be broken. Then with a twist of his wrist he flung the hand away. "Don't do
  that, please," he said calmly.</p>

  <p>Steppe stood panting, grimacing...afraid. Merville felt the fear before he
  saw its evidence. "How did you do that?" panted Steppe. It was the resentful
  curiosity of the beaten animal.</p>

  <p>Ronnie opened his mouth and laughed long and joyously. He was, thought the
  doctor, like a boy conjurer who had mystified his elders and was enjoying the
  joke of it. Then, without warning, he became serious again and pressed a bell
  on his table. "Francois, open the door...must you go, Bertram? I wanted to
  see you rather pressingly. Steppe can find his way home, can't you, Steppe?
  One can't imagine him getting lost...and he can ask a policeman."</p>

  <p>"I'll settle with you later, Morelle. Come on, Merville." The doctor
  vacillated. "Come on!'" roared Steppe.</p>

  <p>"I'll see you this afternoon...I have an engagement now." Merville went
  hastily after the big man. Ronnie followed, overtaking them as they were
  getting into the elevator. "Will you tell Beryl that I am coming to see her
  tonight?"</p>

  <p>"She'll not see you" exploded Steppe. "No decent woman would see
  you..."</p>

  <p>"What an ape you are!" said Ronnie reproachfully. "Don't you realize that
  I'm not talking to you?"</p>

  <h2><a id="chap55"
     name="chap55">CHAPTER LV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">JAN STEPPE'S solitary lunch was served at midday, an hour
  which ensured his solitude, for he was a man who liked his meals alone. He
  was nearing the finish of his repast, his enormous appetite unimpaired by his
  unhappy experience of the morning, when two men mounted the steps of his
  Berkeley Square residence. They were unknown to one another; one had walked,
  the other had descended from a taxi, and they stood aside politely. "You are
  first, sir," said the taller and healthier of the two. Their cards went in to
  Jan Steppe together.</p>

  <p>He saw the tall man first, jumping up from the table and wiping his
  fingers on his serviette. "In the library, huh?" He looked at himself in the
  glass, pulled his cravat straight, and smoothed his black hair before he made
  his way to where the tall man, hat in hand, was waiting his pleasure. "Well,
  inspector, what do you want?" Steppe jerked open the lid of a box and
  presented its contents for approval.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir." The inspector of police chose a cigar with care. "It is
  about this Traction Company of your friends&mdash;I think I remember you
  saying that you were not in the flotation yourself?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;I bought shares. I have a large number. What about it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir," said the inspector, speaking slowly, "I am afraid that
  matters are very serious&mdash;very serious indeed. The Public Prosecutor had
  taken action and a warrant has been issued."</p>

  <p>Steppe was prepared for this. "Have you the warrant?" The officer nodded.
  "Can it be put off until tomorrow?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely impossible, sir. The best I can do is to defer its execution
  until late tonight. Even then I am taking a risk."</p>

  <p>Steppe tugged at his little beard. "Make it tonight," he said. "I'll
  undertake that he doesn't leave the country&mdash;you won't let him know, of
  course?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir."</p>

  <p>If Steppe had offered as much money as he could command to secure the
  escape of his victim, the bribe would have been rejected. But a postponement
  of arrest&mdash;that was another matter.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, inspector."</p>

  <p>"Thank you, sir; I shall put a couple of men on to watch him. I must do
  that; he will never know."</p>

  <p>Steppe went back to the dining-room very much occupied. "No, I can't see
  anybody else...order the car. Who is he?" He took up the second card. "Mr.
  Jeremiah Talbot." The man who was concerned in the case where Ronald Morelle
  had figured so ingloriously. Perhaps he could tell him something about
  Ronnie? Something to his further discredit. "Bring him in." And when the
  dapper Mr. Talbot appeared: "I can give you two minutes,
  Mr.&mdash;er&mdash;Talbot."</p>

  <p>"I've come from a sense of duty," began the injured Jeremiah. "I'm
  certainly not going to be intimidated by threats from a beast like Ronald
  Morelle..."</p>

  <p>Steppe cut him short. "Is it about Ronald Morelle? I haven't time to go
  into your quarrels."</p>

  <p>"It is about Ronnie...and Beryl Merville."</p>

  <p>Jan Steppe gazed at the man moodily, then into the fire, then back to
  Jeremiah Talbot. "Sit down," he said. "Now..." Talbot told his story plainly
  and without trimmings, save that his hatred of Ronnie led him to digress from
  time to time, "You saw; you are certain?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. I ran down the stairs. There was a fellow taking photographs
  outside, a man with a brown beard..." Moropulos! And the photograph was that
  of Beryl Merville! "Go on."</p>

  <p>"That is all. I felt it my duty to tell you. If Ronald Morelle attempts to
  browbeat me, I'll give him in charge..."</p>

  <p>"All right...you can go. Thank you." Jan Steppe had his own peculiar views
  on women in general, the relationship of Beryl with Ronnie Morelle in
  particular. Things of that kind happen. He had thought some such affair was
  possible, and was neither shocked not outraged. Beryl did not love him, he
  knew; she loved Morelle. He grinned wickedly.</p>

  <p>"The car, sir." His first call was at the registrar's office. The special
  licence had been secured a week before.</p>

  <p>"I can marry you at half-past two," said the registrar. "We like a day's
  notice, but in an exceptional case..." Steppe paid.</p>

  <p>The Mervilles had not gone in to lunch when he arrived. Beryl was in her
  room, the doctor working in his study. Steppe wondered what he was working
  at. "I want to see Miss Merville&mdash;don't disturb the doctor." She came
  down, a listless girl. Intuitively she knew that he had been told. What would
  he do? She stopped at the door of her father's study, fighting her fear.
  Should she tell him first? In the end she came to Steppe. "Well, Beryl, what
  is this I hear about Ronald Morelle and you, huh?"</p>

  <p>"What have you heard?"</p>

  <p>"That you've been his mistress&mdash;that's what I've heard. Damned fine
  news for a bridegroom, huh? Does your father know?" She shook her head. "Do
  you want him to know?"</p>

  <p>"I don't care."</p>

  <p>"You don't care, huh? Got that way now, so that you don't care. You'll
  marry me this afternoon."</p>

  <p>She looked up. "This afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"Huh. You'd better tell the doctor; you can tell him anything else you
  like about Morelle&mdash;but if you don't tell, I won't."</p>

  <p>Her hand had gone up to her cheek. "This afternoon...I can't...give me a
  day...you said it would be tomorrow. I'm not ready."</p>

  <p>"This afternoon at half-past two. Will you tell the doctor, or shall
  I?"</p>

  <p>She was trying to think. "I'll tell him. As you wish. This afternoon."</p>

  <p>Lunch went into the dining-room. Nobody touched food. Steppe had to return
  to the house to get the wedding ring, send telegrams changing the date of his
  arrival in Paris, settle such minor details of household management as the
  change necessitated. He was at the registrar's office when they
  came&mdash;Dr. Merville and the white-faced girl. In a cab behind the
  doctor's car travelled two Scotland Yard detectives.</p>

  <p>The ceremony was simple. The repetition of a few sentences and Beryl
  Merville became Beryl Van Steppe. She did not know that his name was Van
  Steppe until she saw the marriage certificate. "You can go home with your
  father. Be ready to leave by the boat-train tonight." So he dismissed
  her.</p>

  <p>All the way back to the house the doctor was talking, cheerfully,
  helpfully. She did not hear him. She was looking at the broad gold ring on
  her finger.</p>

  <p>As they were entering the house her father leaned back and scrutinised the
  street. "I'm sure I've seen those two men before...Weren't they waiting
  outside the registrar's, Beryl?"</p>

  <p>Beryl had seen only one man. A man with a black beard: a broad swarthy
  face and two eyes wherein burnt the fires of hell.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap56"
     name="chap56">CHAPTER LVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">EVIE brought the news at a run. She had been shopping with
  Teddy&mdash;the store had given her a holiday and there was some talk of
  subscribing for a wedding present. "I said to Teddy, 'Let's stop and see who
  it is'&mdash;we knew it was somebody swagger by the two cars and the cab
  outside the door. And then I thought that I knew one of the cars. I said,
  'Teddy, I'll bet it is Beryl Merville'&mdash;and it was!"</p>

  <p>Christina was pale. "She wasn't to be married until tomorrow," she
  insisted.</p>

  <p>"Well, she's married. My dear, she looked awful. Teddy says..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, damn Teddy!" snapped Christina, and was sorry. "I don't mean that,
  but I'm so used to damning your young men that I can't get out of the habit.
  Did they go away together&mdash;Steppe and she?"</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;she's gone back to the house with her father. Steppe&mdash;is he
  a man with black whiskers?&mdash;well, he went alone."</p>

  <p>Christina kicked off her slippers determinedly. "I'm going to see her,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"What do you think you can do?" asked the scornful Evie. "Take my advice,
  Christina, never interfere between man and wife. Teddy says..."</p>

  <p>"I repeat anything I have already said about Teddy," remarked Christina.
  "Chuck over my shoes, Evie." She could not tell Beryl. She could tell nobody.
  Ronnie Morelle must be interpreted by those who saw. She strode out, thanking
  God for life, and Ambrose Sault for the tingle of her soles upon the
  pavement. Spring was in the air, the park trees were studded with emerald
  buttons; some impatient bushes had even come fully into leaf before the
  season had begun. The sky was blue and carried white and majestic clouds; the
  birds were chattering noisily above her as she came through the park, and the
  earth smelt good, as it only smells in spring when the awakening of life
  within its bosom releases a million peculiar odours that combine in one
  fragrant nidar.</p>

  <p>To Beryl's eye the girl, with her peaked face and her flaming hair, was a
  vision of radiance. "So good of you..." Beryl was on the verge of a breakdown
  as Christina Colebrook put her arms about her shoulders. "So lovely of you,
  Christina...I wanted to see you...I hadn't the energy to move...or the
  heart."</p>

  <p>"Why today?"</p>

  <p>"Steppe knows everything. He insisted upon today. As well today as
  tomorrow. I am troubled about father. I feel that something dreadful is going
  to happen. He is so restless, and he has asked John Maxton to come; John was
  a great friend of my mother's. In a way, I'm almost glad that there is this
  other trouble hanging over us...that sounds cruel to poor daddy, but it does
  distract me from...thoughts."</p>

  <p>"What is this other trouble?"</p>

  <p>But Beryl shook her head. "I don't know. There has been some
  unpleasantness about a company father floated. Jan Steppe did it really;
  father is only a figurehead. He has had people to see him, people from the
  Public Prosecutor's office. He doesn't talk much about it to me, but I have a
  premonition that all is not well. But, Christina, I'm just whining and
  whining at you, poor girl!"</p>

  <p>"Whine," said Christina. "Go on whining. I should scream! Beryl, my love,
  you have to do something for me, something to relieve my heart of a great
  unhappiness. I intended seeing you today...you had my letter?...well, I'm too
  late to stop you marrying. I thought I would be in time; but not too late to
  save your immortal soul."</p>

  <p>"What&mdash;?"</p>

  <p>"Wait. I want you to promise me, by the man we hold mutually sacred, that
  you will do as I ask. No matter at what inconvenience or danger."</p>

  <p>"I will do anything you ask," said Beryl quietly.</p>

  <p>"What time do you meet this Steppe?"</p>

  <p>"I call for him at eight o'clock. The boat-train leaves at
  nine-thirty."</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock you will go to Ronnie Morelle."</p>

  <p>"No, no I can't do that..."</p>

  <p>"You promised. You will see him: go to his flat and see him. Tell him you
  are married. Tell him the truth, that you are going away with a man you hate.
  Tell him that Steppe knows."</p>

  <p>"I can't! You don't know what you're asking, Christina. I've...begged
  Ronnie before...begged him to run away with me. I can't do that again. It is
  impossible."</p>

  <p>"You need beg nothing...nothing. Just tell him." She caught the girl to
  her. "Beryl, you're going to do what I ask you, dear?"</p>

  <p>"You...you wouldn't ask me&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Out of caprice," finished Christina, "or cussedness, or a wish to try
  experiments. No. But you must go, Beryl. I...I think I should kill myself if
  you didn't."</p>

  <p>"Christina! What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I mean it is life to go and death not to go!" said Christina, with a sort
  of ferocity that staggered her companion. "That is what I mean." In a quieter
  tone: "Have you seen Ronald lately?"</p>

  <p>Beryl shook her head. "No. I saw him that night...the night they killed
  Ambrose...oh..."</p>

  <p>"Don't gulp," warned Christina.</p>

  <p>"I'm not gulping. I'm...yearning. I saw him yearning once, the dear. I am
  trying to find some of his strength now. It is a little difficult."</p>

  <p>On the way home Christina dropped into a telephone booth and paid three
  precious pennies. "Ronnie! Christina speaking. Beryl is coming to see you
  tonight. At eight. Wait for her...don't dare to be out." She cut off before
  he could ask questions.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap57"
     name="chap57">CHAPTER LVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">SIR JOHN MAXTON stayed to dinner. Beryl did not put in an
  appearance until just before eight. "Already, Beryl?" Dr. Merville scrambled
  up. His face was grey, his eyes sunken, the hands that took her by the
  shoulders shook. "My dear...I hope I have done right. I hope I have done
  right, my little girl." She tried to smile as she kissed him.</p>

  <p>"Can't I take you to Berkeley Square, Beryl?" asked Sir John.</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "No thank you, John...goodbye." They stood together,
  bareheaded, on the pavement, and saw her go. A drizzle of rain was falling,
  the dull red furnace glow of London was in the sky.</p>

  <p>Together they walked back to the dining-room, and Maxton did not break in
  upon the doctor's thoughts. "Thank God she's gone," he whispered at last.
  "John, I'm at the end, I know it. Perhaps he'll help after&mdash;I'll be
  satisfied if he makes Beryl happy."</p>

  <p>"He could help now," said John Maxton. "Why do you deceive yourself? How
  can you hope for anything from Steppe? I wish to God I had known that this
  infernal marriage was for today."</p>

  <p>"She wished it," said the doctor. "I should not have insisted, but she
  wished it. Steppe isn't a bad fellow..."</p>

  <p>"Steppe is a scoundrel, and nobody knows that better than yourself. Why
  are you in any danger from the law? Because you copied a draft prospectus
  which Steppe drew up, and issued it in your own name. Steppe had only to
  appear as a witness and tell the truth and he would find himself in your
  place&mdash;supposing this comes to a prosecution. But he won't. He could
  have saved..." He stopped.</p>

  <p>"Ambrose Sault?"</p>

  <p>"He could have saved the body of Ambrose Sault from annihilation by a
  word! The draft of the prospectus is in existence. It is in the safe that
  Sault made. Steppe could open it and ninety-nine-hundredths of your
  responsibility would be wiped out. But he won't risk his own skin."</p>

  <p>"You think they will prosecute, John?"</p>

  <p>Maxton considered. There was nothing to be gained by evasion. "I am sure
  they will," he said quietly. "If I were the Public Prosecutor I should apply
  for a warrant on the facts as I know them."</p>

  <p>The door opened. "Will you see two gentlemen from Whitehall?" the maid
  asked.</p>

  <p>It was Maxton who nodded. "Bertram...you have to meet this ordeal...
  courageously."</p>

  <p>The doctor got up as the detectives entered. "I am Detective Inspector
  Lord, from Scotland Yard," said the first of them. "You are Doctor Bertram
  Merville? I have to take you into custody on a charge of misrepresentation
  under the Companies Act."</p>

  <p>"Very good," said Dr. Merville. "May I go to my room for a moment?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," said the inspector. "I understand you keep a medicine chest in
  your room."</p>

  <p>Maxton nodded approvingly. He did not go to the police station with the
  prisoner. He went in search of Beryl...and Jan Steppe.</p>

  <h2><a id="chap58"
     name="chap58">CHAPTER LVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">RONALD MORELLE stood on the hearthrug before his electric
  radiator watching the fiery little wave that moved along the surface of the
  element. In such moments of complete detachment when his mind was free from
  the encumbrance of active thought, he received strange impressions. They were
  not memories, he told himself, any more than are those faces which grow and
  fade in the darkness just before sleeping and waking. They were wisps of
  dream that were born and dissolved in a fraction of time. He had see such
  clouds grow instantly above the lake of Geneva, and watching them from the
  terraces of Caux, had of a sudden missed them, even as he watched. So these
  impressions appeared and vanished. There was on that was distinct and more
  frequent than any other. It was of a hut, long and narrow. Two broad sloping
  benches ran down each side, and these, at night, were packed with sleeping
  men. The door to the hut was very solid and was locked by a soldier...he
  could sometimes hear the swish of the soldier's boots as he paced the gravel
  path surrounding the hut. Once a man had died...Ronnie helped to carry him
  out. It was a plague that had struck the island...Island? Yes, it was an
  island, in the tropics, for the nights were very hot and the plants
  luxurious..."There is a ring...will m'sieur require me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, stay, Francois." Ronnie jumped up and dusted his trousers. Another
  second, and he was half-way across the room. "I'm so glad that I came,
  Ronnie; it wasn't that Christina insisted; I wanted to see you, dear."</p>

  <p>How pale, how ill she looked, he thought, with a sinking heart. She was
  going away somewhere, for she was dressed for travelling. "Beryl, my dear,
  you are not well?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm well enough, Ronnie." She glanced back at the door. She expected
  that at any moment Steppe would come...he would guess. There was a train to
  be caught, too...the madness of this visit!</p>

  <p>He held both her hands in his. "Beryl, they tell me you are going to be
  married. That isn't right, Beryl, is it?" She nodded. "But, Beryl..." he
  stopped. "I saw you once and I was cruel, wasn't I?"</p>

  <p>"What is the use of talking about it? Ronnie, I hope you are going to be a
  better man than you have been. I admire you so much for defending that poor
  girl. You are trying to be different now..."</p>

  <p>"I think so."</p>

  <p>"And...I'm believing you, Ronnie. Is it easy to give up that life? Won't
  you want to go back to it again?"</p>

  <p>He smiled. "I will take away from thee the desire of thine eyes with a a
  stroke, yet neither shalt thou mourn nor weep.'"</p>

  <p>She looked at him fearfully. "Ronnie, how solemn you are...and you are so
  strong, too...I feel it. Ronnie, I am married!"</p>

  <p>He bent his head as though he had not heard her. "I was married today to
  Steppe...Oh God, it is awful, Ronnie, awful!"</p>

  <p>He put his arm about her and kissed the tearful face, and then...Crash!
  The door shook again. "I think that is your husband," said Ronnie gently.
  "Will you go into my room?"</p>

  <p>He opened the door for her and said 'Yes' with his eyes to be alarmed
  Francois.</p>

  <p>Steppe flung himself into the room. In his great fur-collared coat he
  looked a giant of a man.</p>

  <p>"Well?" said Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"Where's my wife?" The man's voice vibrated. "You swine! Where is my
  wife?...She's come here...I know, to her damned paramour. Where is she?" he
  bellowed.</p>

  <p>"She is in my room," said Ronnie, and Jan Steppe staggered back as if he
  were shot.</p>

  <p>"In your room?" He sounded as if he were being strangled. "Well... now she
  can come to my room! You called me an ape this morning. I'll show you what
  kind of an ape I can be. Beryl!" he roared.</p>

  <p>She came out, a tragic figure of despair.</p>

  <p>"So you had to come and see him, eh?"</p>

  <p>Francois had opened the door again, and a man came in unannounced.</p>

  <p>"Steppe!"</p>

  <p>It was John Maxton, and Steppe turned with a snarl. "Merville has been
  arrested."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"My father! Arrested! Jan, I must go back..."</p>

  <p>"You'll go with me, huh! I haven't married your father&mdash;or your
  lover, either."</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" demanded Maxton sternly.</p>

  <p>"Catch my train! You can't stop me..."</p>

  <p>"Steppe, for God's sake think what you are doing." Sir John Maxton was
  pleading now with a greater intensity than he had ever pleaded before a
  tribunal. "You could save Merville&mdash;you have the draft of the
  prospectus..."</p>

  <p>"In the safe! In the safe!" roared Steppe, his face inflamed with fury.
  "Come, Beryl!" He held out his hand, but she shrank back behind Ronnie.</p>

  <p>"Then open the safe," demanded Maxton.</p>

  <p>"Go to hell! All of you...don't stand up to me, Morelle, I'll kill you!
  Beryl..."</p>

  <p>"What is the word&mdash;this combination word, Steppe? You can get away
  tonight, they will find nothing until the morning..."</p>

  <p>"I won't tell you, damn you! I'll see you..."</p>

  <p>"Judas!" Ronnie Morelle stood, his finger outstretched stiffly, pointing
  at the other. "Judas...J-U-D-A-S. That is the word!"</p>

  <p>Open-mouthed, Steppe lurched towards him. "You...you..." He struck, but
  his blow went wide and then Ronnie had him by the shoulders and they looked
  into one another's eyes. Beryl, horrified, sick with fear, saw her husband's
  face go livid, saw him grimace painfully, monstrously.</p>

  <p>"I know you!" he screamed. "I know you! You're Sault! Ambrose Sault!...
  You're dead! They hanged you, blast you! Ambrose Sault..." He put out his
  huge hands as to ward off a ghastly sight. "Come along, Beryl," he mumbled,
  "you mustn't stay here...it is Sault...oh..."</p>

  <p>He went down in a heap. Beryl came forward, groping like one blind.
  "Ronnie..." She stared into his eyes, and in his agitation he put his knuckle
  to his chin. "Oh, my dear!"</p>

  <p class="first">"PERSONALLY," said Evie, "I think she should have waited six
  months. After all, Christina, even if her father was acquitted there is a
  scandal. I admit she was a wife in name only, as the pictures say, but she
  was Mrs. Steppe. Teddy quite agrees with me; he says that it isn't decent to
  marry within a week of your husband's death. Don't think I'm hurt about
  Ronnie getting married; I wouldn't be so small. It is the principle of the
  thing."</p>

  <p>Christina's mouth was bulging; Ronnie had sent her imposing quantities of
  candy.</p>

  <p>"Pass me that book about Beaulieu that you're sitting on, and don't talk
  so much," she said. "You're a jealous cat."</p>

  <p>"I'm not. I declare I'm not. I like Ronnie, I admit, but there was
  something lacking in him...soul, that's what it was, soul!"</p>

  <p>"Did Ambrose Sault have soul?"</p>

  <p>"Why...yes, I always thought he had soul."</p>

  <p>"Then shut up!" said Christina, opening her book.</p>
