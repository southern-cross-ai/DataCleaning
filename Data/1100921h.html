<h2><a id="chap1" name="chap1">I - BLACK MONDAY</a></h2>
<p class="first">THE SCRAP of paper lay on the counter of Europe, and the
honour of more than one great Power trembled in the balance. And accordingly
the greatest nation of them all would be compelled to act. Not that she had
ever hesitated; not that she would swerve one inch from the path that she had
pursued for nearly a thousand years; and perhaps because of this, from the
north to the south, and from the east to the west, anxious hearts were beating
and anxious eyes turned towards the storm centre that hung so black and
threatening over Central Europe.</p>
<p>Would Germany respect her word? Would she hold by the compact she had
entered into so many years ago? There were those who declared that she would,
that the fear of Germany was no more than the exploitation of a certain school
of journalism; but there were others who knew better than that, who knew for a
certainty that Belgium was merely a pawn in the game of chess that Germany had
played incessantly for the last 40 years. And so England waited.</p>
<p>The storm had gathered all too quickly. Seven days before, outside the
charmed circle of European diplomacy, not a score of people had seen a sign of
the gathering tempest. All England had been looking forward to its playtime,
hundreds of thousands of honest toilers in the workshops and the offices were
joyfully anticipating the holiday month. Eyes were turned eagerly towards the
sea and the moorland, and now it seemed as if all that was forgotten. There had
been trouble threatening on the Thursday and Friday, and then Black Monday had
come with the most fateful Bank Holiday since holidays had first begun. And now
to all practical purposes Germany had cynically flung her honour into the
melting pot, and already had broken her solemn promise to Belgium, and England
was at war with Germany, and the greatest conflict in the history of the world
had begun.</p>
<p>It was a strange, weird holiday the Londoners were spending, a combination
of holiday and funeral. It was as if some great nation was suddenly in the grip
of mortal plague just at the moment when work had been flung aside with no heed
for the morrow, a decorous mute festival with the shadow of some dire
misfortune looming behind it.</p>
<p>So far there had been no outbreak of passion or emotion, no waving of flags,
no outburst of patriotism from a million throats. For the thing had gone too
deep for that. Early as it was, the nation was beginning to realise the
stupendous task that lay before it. It seemed almost incredible that this
quiet, sombre-eyed London was the same capital that had gone into the Boer War
with noise and tumult, the wagging or flags, and the loud bray of brass and
cymbals. For already deep down was the feeling that this ghastly business had
been inevitable from the first, and that the future of the Empire was in
peril.</p>
<p>Some such thoughts as these were passing through the mind of Harold Bentley
as he walked through the streets of London on that Black Monday, without in the
least knowing where he was going and what end he had in view. Here were crowds
and crowds of people wandering about more or less aimlessly and discussing the
great question with bated breath. Here and there somebody laughed, and the
mirth seemed to be strangely out of place&mdash;almost an outrage. Here were
some carelessly and light-heartedly making their way into places of amusement;
some who did not understand, and probably never would understand, the full
weight of the blow that had fallen. Here and there people were gathered in
groups, and at the foot of the Nelson column a Socialist orator was raving and
ranting to a detached and uninterested audience, who listened to his poisonous
treason with a certain stolid apathy. It was one of those amazing sights only
to be seen in London; it would be impossible in any other European capital. And
that, too, under the very shadow of the Englishman who did as much as or more
than any son of the Empire to make Britain what she is to-day.</p>
<p>Bentley paused almost involuntarily. He had nothing in his pocket; he had no
object in life for the moment, except to kill the time, and he paused rather
cynically to listen to the frothy rubbish that came so glibly from the man's
lips. The speaker was a big man, heavy and red of face, and he spoke with the
hoarseness which is always suggestive of gin and fog and the beery dissipation
of the common pothouse. He was appealing for some cause, too, for there was a
collecting box at his feet, and now and again some good-natured passer-by
dropped a coin into it.</p>
<p>But it was only for a moment that Bentley listened with a smile upon his
lips. Then he edged a little closer to the speaker, and his fists clenched
instinctively. He was standing shoulder to shoulder now with the crowd,
listening without betraying the slightest emotion, and just for a moment he
felt a certain contempt for his fellow-countrymen. He did not quite realise
that their attitude was one of benevolent toleration, due to the Englishman's
instinctive love of fair play and his desire to give the meanest outcast a
chance.</p>
<p>"I tell yer it's all in our hands," the speaker vociferated. "It's all in
the hands of the working man. If you chaps like to put yer foot down you can
stop this war now. The working man of Europe could stop anything. Do you
suppose those people in the House of Commons and at Whitehall care a hang for
Belgium? D'you suppose they'd lose a moment's sleep, if Germany annexed Belgium
to-morrow? Not they, my lads. Because why? Because this is a war got up by
capitalists to put money in their pockets. It means millions and millions
dragged out of your pockets in the way of taxation, and it will be all spent on
the employers of labour, who'll be living on the fat of the land, whilst you
chaps can hardly get bread, to say nothing of beer."</p>
<p>"And you wouldn't like that, guv'nor," a voice from the crowds jeered. "Is
that wot you're collectin' for?"</p>
<p>"Ah, you can laugh," the speaker went on. "But who's going to do the
fighting? Who's going to lay down their lives on the blood-stained fields of
Europe? Why, the working man. When he finds himself without food and wages
he'll take the shilling in sheer despair and go and fight for what he calls his
country, whilst the nobs will stay at home with their champagne, wine, and
their golf and their shooting. When I see the gentlemen, as they call
themselves, coming forward to fight then I'll say no more about it. But just
let me know when you catch 'em at it. Why, there's one of 'em there
now&mdash;that chap with the blue suit as is sneering at me and you and every
other honest son of toil. There he is, him in the straw hat."</p>
<p>It seemed to Harold that every eye was turned upon him in an instant. For
the first time he was conscious of the hot anger that filled him, conscious of
the tingling in his finger-tips, and a mad desire to jump forward and dash his
fist into that red, drink-sodden face, and take the consequences. Where were
the police, that they permitted an outrage like this to exist at the very base
of Nelson's Column? And Harold was conscious, too, of the little knot of
powerful-looking loafers&mdash;friends, no doubt, of the speaker, and potential
shareholders in the collecting box at the orator's feet.</p>
<p>"Are you speaking of me?" Harold asked.</p>
<p>"Well, what if I am?" the orator demanded. "Since you put it to me like
that, I am."</p>
<p>"It's a lie," Harold said hotly. "It's as much of a lie as it is for you to
call yourself a working man. You've never done a day's work in your life."</p>
<p>"That's the style, Mr. Bentley," a hoarse voice said. "Rub it into the
swine. I'll back yer up."</p>
<h2><a id="chap2" name="chap2">II - RAGGED AND TOUGH</a></h2>
<p class="first">Harold turned a surprised glance on the speaker. He saw a
little man, short and squarely built; a man with fiery red hair, and whose
impudent face was deeply marked with orange freckles. His clothes were dingy
and dilapidated, his toes were working through his broken boots, and to all
appearance fortune had not smiled his way of late. But the impudent blue of his
eyes and the audacious swaggering smile on his lips seemed to have been born
there and ready to defy every misfortune that came his way. He might have been
any age between 19 and 25, but in the case of the typical pariah of the London
streets it is always difficult to tell. This was not the question that Harold
was asking himself&mdash;he was wondering how this ragged and tough specimen of
humanity knew him so well by name.</p>
<p>"I think I can manage all right, thank you," he said coldly.</p>
<p>"Don't you be put down, Mr. Bentley. Don't yer let 'im 'ave all 'is own way,
I'll back yer up. There's a bloke astandin' be'ind the Socialist, that cove
with the long nose. An' I don't mind tellin' yer as I'm a-dyin' ter punch
'im."</p>
<p>Harold edged the speaker on one side. By this time some of the crowd, bent
on mischief, were egging him on. The orator had ceased speaking, conscious,
perhaps, that he was getting the better of the argument, for he turned
sneeringly to Bentley, and demanded to know if he had any more to say.</p>
<p>"Only this," Harold cried hotly, "that you are no working man. Work is a
thing that loafers of your class don't believe in. In any other country but
this you would be pulled off that pedestal and drowned in the nearest fountain.
Yes, I've a great mind to save the police the trouble of hanging you."</p>
<p>The crowd tittered and then broke into a hoarse laugh. The Socialist's face
turned a deeper red.</p>
<p>"And what about yourself?" he asked. "You're one of the nobs, you are, you
of the nuts. Pap-fed at a public school, and then swaggering at Oxford College.
Oh, I know your sort. Catch you doing anything for your country! You've
enlisted, of course? Did it this morning, may be."</p>
<p>Bentley said nothing for a moment. For it was a question he had not
anticipated. He wanted to explain; he had an insane desire to tell the now
interested spectators the reason why he had passed one recruiting office after
another without a glance to the right or left. But the thing was impossible. He
could not stand up there before that little knot of fellow-creatures and
explain to them that, though the speaker's guess as to the public school was
correct, he was merely a city clerk more or less fortunate in the possession of
30s a week, and with a mother and sister entirely dependent upon him. No doubt,
later on, a grateful country would do something for those who had given up
everything to follow the flag, but meanwhile the call of those nearest and
dearest to him drowned the trumpet call of patriotism and country. And it would
have been so easy to lie to the red-faced spouter, and thus escape the jeers
and sneers of those around him.</p>
<p>"No," he said, "I have not enlisted. It is no business of yours, but I
merely tell you the truth. My father died for his country, and if
circumstances&mdash;"</p>
<p>He broke off abruptly and bit his lip. What a fool he was to lose his temper
like this, how childish to betray these sacred confidences to callous strangers
who were merely seeking a few minutes cheap recreation! He would have turned
away and edged through the crowd had not the next words of the speaker arrested
him. He pulled up quivering in every nerve.</p>
<p>"There what did I tell you? He ain't going to fight, not he. Ain't got pluck
enough. Hiding himself behind a woman's petticoats. Now, look here, young
fellow, I've had enough of you; you just hop off, else I'll come down and make
you."</p>
<p>The little man with the red hair by Harold's side chuckled joyfully. The
light of battle gleamed in his eyes.</p>
<p>"E's fairly arskin' for it, Mr. Bently," he whispered, "Now, don't yer go
an' fly in the fice o' Providence. Don't yer lose a charnce as is fairly
stickin' aht at yer. You tike 'im on, and I'll go for the melancholy bloke with
the long nose. Lor' bless yer, sir, many the time as I've stood a-watchin' yer
in the gymnasium of the old school when you've 'ed the gloves on with some o'
the other gents. Why, that left punch o' yourn't ud 'ave made a champion of yer
if you 'adn't been one of the toffs with pots o' money. I don't suppose you
remember me, sir, but at one time I was boot-boy in Mr. Seymour's 'ouse when
you was at Rugby. Nime of Ginger Smiff."</p>
<p>In a hazy way Bentley was beginning to remember. But there was little time
for questions now, for the red-faced bully, feeling more sure of his ground,
was advancing threateningly to the attack. Already Harold could feel the man's
hot breath on his face; he was conscious of the thrust-out jaw and the cruel
anger in the blurred grey eyes of his opponent. No doubt the assailant had
calculated upon the moral support at least of the crowd, for he lunged out
viciously, his one desire to hurt and maim his opponent before the arrival of
the police.</p>
<p>Harold was cool enough now. The joy of the fight was on him. Here was the
chance to let himself go, to relieve his pent-up feelings, and strike a blow
for his country, even if only an oblique one. Out of the corner of his eye he
could see the little man with ginger hair wriggling his way through the crowd
until he was face to face with the long-nosed Socialist, who promptly made a
dash for him with a stick. Bentley was conscious of the fact that Ginger
Smith's opponent was suddenly brought up all standing with a vicious body blow,
and then he went down, to rise no more, before a vigorous left on the point of
the jaw. And then Harold saw his chance, too.</p>
<p>It was a cruelly uneven contest from the very first, for the fat and flabby
Socialist was no kind of a match for two-and-twenty years of perfect condition
and muscular manhood trained fine as a star and rendered hard as nails by
outdoor exercise. In the language of the ring, Harold was all over his
opponent; it was mere child's play to him, and his one regret lay in the fact
that it was over all too soon. The man collapsed, a blubbering heap at his
feet, yelling and cursing and calling for the police. From somewhere in the
distance a whistle blew, and it was borne in upon Harold that this generous
impulse of his was likely to get him into trouble. He snatched the money-box
and crushed it in fragments under his feet. Then he scooped up the contents and
scattered them amongst the crowd. By this time Ginger Smith had completed his
work and was back by Harold's side.</p>
<p>"Come on, sir," he panted. "Let's get out of this. It's been a bit of a
beano so far, but yer don't want ter be run in and fined five pahnds fer
spilin' a swine like 'im. Come on, sir, 'ere's the bloomin' coppers
a-comin'."</p>
<p>Ginger burst his way through the crowd and darted across the square in the
direction of Whitehall. Harold was alive to the peril now, and followed
rapidly. It would never do for him to find himself figuring before magistrates
over this wretched business. His employer was a cold, austere man, a
money-grubber, and selfish bachelor, and an worshipper of the conventions, who
would have discharged him without compunction had anything of this come to his
ears. And Harold knew only too well how hard it was to earn the bread of life
in a city office.</p>
<p>He saw Ginger dart and twist under a policeman's arm and vanish down an
entry. Then he was conscious of a motor car pulling up by him alongside the
pavement.</p>
<p>"Well, this is a nice game, Harold," a cheery voice said. "I was just in
time to see the end of it. Jump in, old chap&mdash;I suppose you don't want to
find yourself in Bow-street. And now, where have you been hiding all this long
time?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap3" name="chap3">III - A FRIEND IN NEED</a></h2>
<p class="first">With a deep sigh of relief, Harold dropped back against the
luxurious cushions of the car, only too thankful to escape from the folly of
his recent adventure. It was some little time before he spoke, not indeed until
the car paused before a block of flats in Campden Hill, and the rescuer led the
way up the stairs to the first floor. Here he put his latchkey in the lock, and
a few minutes later Harold was seated in a deep armchair, with a choice Turkish
cigarette between his lips. It was the first time he had smoked for weeks.</p>
<p>"Now, what on earth do you mean by it?" his friend demanded. "What excuse
have you got to make for turning your back on your friends in this fashion? I
suppose you know it's two years since we last met? Now explain yourself."</p>
<p>"Oh, I daresay you'll think me very ungrateful, Ronnie," Harold said. "But
try to put yourself in my place, old man. When the poor old governor was killed
in that little affair on the Indian frontier we were under the impression that
we were going to be fairly well off. As a matter of fact, there wasn't a penny
left. My father had muddled everything away in all sorts of mad speculations.
Of course, my notion of going to Oxford was knocked on the head, and instead I
had to turn to and get enough money to keep my mother and sister. And weary
work it's been, too. You see, my mother is not capable of doing anything but
manage a house, though she can do that to perfection. My sister is in a fair
way to becoming a successful artist, but meanwhile she has to be kept, and I
can assure you that 30s a week doesn't go very far."</p>
<p>Ronald Kemp was duly sympathetic. He had never known what it was to lack
anything. He had a fine place of his own out Harrow way, where he spent a good
deal of time with his sister and her elderly companion, and he kept up his
luxurious flat in London as well. It was a popular fiction that he took an
active part in the great firm of which his father had been the head, but it was
seldom indeed that the handsome presence and cheery laugh of Ronnie Kemp were
ever seen and heard in the city of London. For the rest, he was a clean-limbed,
clean-lived, and healthy type of young England, as moulded by a public school,
than which the whole world can present no finer type of high-minded and
wholesome humanity. Furthermore, he was generous and large-hearted and loyal to
his friends, and there was a frown on his face as he listened to Bentley's
story.</p>
<p>"Well, at any rate, you might have come to see me," he protested. "You know
jolly well that what is mine is yours. It makes me downright mad to think that
the best pal I ever had at school should be starving on a few shillings a week,
whilst I'm literally flinging the stuff about. My dear old chap, just try and
remember that we shared the same study for three years, and never had a misword
the whole time. Here, fill your cigarette case out of that box. And, how much
do you want? Will you have a couple of hundred to go on with?"</p>
<p>"That's just like you, Ronnie," Bentley said unsteadily. "Always ready to do
a kind act. But it won't do, it won't indeed. Don't you see I can't take it?
Would you take it if you were in my place? If it wasn't for the sake of the
mater and my sister, I wouldn't care a scrap. I'd enlist like a shot. But I
can't, old man, I can't. I shall have to go about with everybody turning the
cold shoulder on me; I shall have the girls in the omnibuses handing the white
feather to me. It's infernally hard, old son, but I shall have to put up with
it. I hear already that lots of men in the city have offered men in my position
a full salary if they join the colours. But not my old blackguard, selfish old
bachelor. I put it to him on Saturday, and he told me I could go if I liked,
but if I thought he was going to do anything for the mater and Nettie I was
jolly well mistaken. Upon my word, I am worried about the thing until I'm
unable to sleep even. But what's to be done?"</p>
<p>Kemp nodded sympathetically. He was evidently turning over some project in
his mind.</p>
<p>"You want to enlist, of course?" he said.</p>
<p>"My dear chap, I'm aching to do something. I suppose I've met a score of the
old lot since Saturday, and there isn't one of 'em who isn't doing something.
And you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm all right," Kemp explained. "I joined the Hon. Company of
Musketeers as soon as I left school. On and off I've been three years in the
corps. We're all old O.T.C.'s, as you know, and I don't suppose there's one of
us who can't show a Certificate A. With any luck, we shall be at the front in a
month. And you see, without boasting, we are to all practical purposes
regulars. We're full up now, but I was down at headquarters this morning, and I
heard that they were well on towards a second battalion already. Sort of 'let
'em all come,' arrangement: 'Duke's son, cook's son, son of a millionaire.'
We're going to have the cream of London, my boy&mdash;the chaps who come first
without waiting for the call. I tell you we shall make up a brigade to be proud
of. And, what's more, I'll bet you a sovereign we're full by Wednesday morning.
Ah, well, I know it's the fashion to laugh at us and call us nuts and make fun
of our socks, and accuse us of hanging about all those dear little flappers,
but the stuff's there, my boy, it's there all right. Waterloo was won on the
playing fields of Eton, and the freedom of Europe is going to be won by the
flanneled fools and muddied oafs, and good old Rudyard Kipling will be the
first man to acknowledge it when the time comes. We're going together side by
side, the navvy and the nut and the Gaiety boy and the miner all side by side,
and we're going to win out with the old flag. We're going to show the country
what it never dreamt of; I can feel it in my bones. But what a beastly selfish
chap I must be to talk like this to you. But I've done it with a purpose.
You've got to put your beastly pride in your pocket. It isn't the time to think
of that sort of thing. You've got to come with me into the trenches; you've got
to lie down side by side with Tommy from Whitechapel and Bill from Shoreditch;
and you've got to forget that there's any difference between us, because, as
Kipling says, 'The Colonel's lady and Biddy O'Grady are sisters under their
skins.' And we're brothers under our coats, though one is cut in Bond-street
and the other is a reach-me-down sold for a tanner in Petticoat-lane. Now, I
only ask you one question&mdash;Are you coming with me, or are you not?"</p>
<p>"If I could," Bentley groaned. "Oh, Lord, if I could."</p>
<p>"Well, you can," Kemp cried. "It's as easy as kiss your hand. Now, listen.
This is all arranged by Providence. You know that my sister lives in that big
place of mine until I get married or make an ass of myself in some other way,
and that she has a kind of companion-housekeeper and chaperon who looks after
her. Now, Miss Hochkess wants to go and join her sister, who runs a big school
in Eastbourne, and needs her very badly to assist there. For nearly a year Miss
Hochkess has stayed on to oblige us, merely because we can't find anybody good
enough to take her place. Your mother would be ideal. She's a lady, and I know
how capable she is&mdash;I ought to, considering the times I've stayed at your
place. It's not a difficult post to fill. Dorothy used to be very fond of your
mother, and she and your sister were great pals till you went and hid
yourselves in that mysterious fashion. And it's a two hundred-a-year job. And
I'm dashed glad I've got that bit out. Now, what do you say? Mind you, I should
have made the same proposition if there'd been no war."</p>
<p>It was some time before Bentley could find his voice. Then he put out his
hand and murmured something under his breath.</p>
<p>"So that's settled," Kemp cried. "Hurrah for the old flag, and here's to the
King, God bless him!"</p>
<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">IV - ALL FOR THE FLAG</a></h2>
<p class="first">Kemp bustled about the room with the matter-of-fact air of one
who has settled some commonplace piece of business, but he was careful not to
look at Bentley just then. Harold was grateful enough, but he was feeling just
a little unmanned. He was disposed to blame himself for not having looked up
some of these good pals of his before; he could see now that it had been
foolish pride on his part; at the same time, he had not the slightest intention
of accepting any of Kemp's money, but this new offer was a different matter
altogether.</p>
<p>"I don't know how to thank you," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm jolly glad to hear it," Kemp laughed. "You'd have done just as much for
me. Now, look here&mdash;I'm no end anxious to get you into our first
battalion. Of course there's no chance at present for either of us to get a
commission, but there are certain to be a few vacancies in the ranks, seeing
that we are dead sure of being at the front in a month's time. A goodish few
chaps who are all right for ornamental work won't pass the doctor now, and
that's where you come in. Now, sit down and scribble a letter to your mother,
and say you won't be back till some time to-morrow. Say I'm giving you a
shakedown for to-night, and that you have got some good news for her. Then
we'll pop down to the depot early to-morrow morning and clinch this
business."</p>
<p>Kemp called down the stairs to the porter and asked if he had a messenger
in, one of the class of men who hang about big blocks of flats in want of a
job; Bentley looking up from his letter presently saw his old acquaintance
Ginger Smith standing in the doorway. There was a grin on his face, and he
appeared to be perfectly at home.</p>
<p>"I knowed you was all right, sir," he said. "I see you 'op it inter Mr.
Kemp's car, so I jest jumps on the back, an' 'ere we are! I runs lots of
errands for Mr. Kemp, and 'e's werry kind to me, 'e is. I'd do anything for
'im, I would."</p>
<p>"Except work," Kemp smiled. "Ginger is quite a handy man, but work frightens
him. He thinks nothing of walking ten miles from here to a golf club and back
and lugging half a ton of clubs round a long course, but that's because he
doesn't think it's work. I've offered to take him into my employ, but it's no
use. He'll never be good for anything."</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, 'e would," Ginger grinned. "Because 'e's got 'is charnce. I never
told you, sir, did I, as my father were a Tommy? Served seventeen year, 'e did,
an' died in the Boer War, and 'e wasn't shot in the back, neither. I was only a
bit of a nipper in them dyes, an' mostly I've storved on an' off ever since,
but 'ere in a little bag wot I carries rahnt me neck I've got three little
silver things as belonged to the ole man wot 'is country give 'im, an' I never
pawned none of 'em yet, though many a dye I've known wot it is ter go wifout a
mouthful o' grub, An' now I'm goin' ter arsk you, sir, ter give me one more
charnce. You may call me a loafer an' a wister as is good for nothin' except
sellin' pipers an' 'anging abaht a golf club, but all the sime I believe as
I've got the right stuff in me ter make a soldier. An' if you would be so kind
as ter get me in that there regiment o' your'n then I'll never forget it. An'
I'll do more'n that. I've bin caddyin' this mornin'. An' when I come in an'
drawed my money, the caddie master 'e says ter me:&mdash;'Don't let me see any
o' you chaps 'ere agin as is between the ages of eighteen and thirty-five.' O'
course, I knowed wot 'e meant, an' I say's, 'Wot o, ole pimple fice. It's me
for the flag to strike a blow for me King an' to keep a roof over the head o'
you an' yer ole missus.' Then we shakes 'ands, an' parts like two ole pals. An'
I ain't goin' back no more. An' I'll tell yer wot, sir. I knows as you wants
recruits for that second battalion o' your'n, and if you'll 'elp me to shove
meself in khaki and fight shoulder to shoulder with two gentlemen like you,
then it'll be a real proud moment for me an' the other chaps."</p>
<p>"Regular orator, isn't he?" Kemp laughed. "What other chaps are you talking
about?"</p>
<p>"Nearly all the rest o' the caddies. We come back together this evenin',
over 70 of us, an' we all made up our mind as we was out for the flag. But we
didn't jest know wot ter do till I 'as wot yer calls a Hinspiration, an' I
says, 'Leave it ter me,' I says. An' they did. An' if yer don't mind, sir, I'm
comin' rahnd ter yer 'eadquarters ter-morrow mornin', an' I'm goin' ter bring
abaht eighty more wif me. We ain't much ter look at, but you feed us up an'
treat us like men, an' you'll find as 'wot we are men. I dare say you'll think
as I'm doin' a lot o' gas wif me mawth&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Here, shake hands, Ginger," Kemp cried. "My good fellow, I'm delighted to
hear you talk like this. It's the good old British spirit bred in the stock
that Drake and Nelson and Wellington came from, and it shows that the old
country is still sound to the core. I'll go out of my way to get you into our
first battalion, and I don't mind telling you that you will be the first
working man who ever belonged to it. It may sound rather snobbish to talk like
that just now, but still&mdash;"</p>
<p>Ginger held his head high as he took Bentley's note and swaggered from the
room. In some subtle way his rags seemed to have taken on a certain dignity,
his powerful shoulders were drawn back, and there was a keen look in his
eye.</p>
<p>"Here, just half a moment!" Kemp cried. "I'll tell you what. There's plenty
of room here, and if you like to bring those pals of yours round here to
breakfast to-morrow morning I'll be proud to welcome you as my guests and shake
hands with you. Now then, off you go."</p>
<p>Ginger clattered importantly down the stairs. Through the open windows came
the cries of the newsboys yelling the very latest sensation. Belgium had
already been invaded, and there was nothing for it now but to see this thing
through.</p>
<p>"I haven't grasped it yet," Bentley said. "It only seems a few hours since I
was wondering how I was going to spend my bank Holiday. You can't get much fun
on a solitary half-crown, and my idea was to take a long country walk. And here
we are with the biggest job in history before us, and we are actually looking
forward with pleasure to-morrow morning to breakfasting with a choice
assortment of golf caddies. Now, what would you have said if anybody had told
you that a week ago?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Kemp confessed. "Advise him to go and see a doctor,
probably. And yet, by Gad, it's true! I don't mind telling you that I shall be
downright proud to march those chaps into our quadrangle to-morrow morning.
And, mind you, I don't underrate the seriousness of this job. We can see now
that the Kaiser and his gang have been getting ready for this business for over
thirty years, and many a good fellow will be down and out before we are in
sight of Berlin. The question is, shall we be in time to save Paris?
Personally, I doubt it. Those brutes will be through Belgium almost before we
can stir. In all these years Lord Roberts has been no more than a voice crying
in the wilderness. Well, I suppose we shall muddle through somehow. We always
have, and we always play the game and give the other fellow the benefit of the
doubt till the last moment. And we've paid for our generosity in blood and
tears. Half an hour ago I was going to suggest that we cheered ourselves with
an hour or so at a music hall. But in some funny way I seem to have grown about
two years older. I seem to have lost my taste for all sorts of pleasure, even
my cigarettes don't smoke quite so pleasantly. How could they, with those words
ringing in one's ears?"</p>
<p>For down below strident voices of the newsboys were pitched in another and
more ominous key.</p>
<p>"Germans across the frontier. Heavy fighting in Belgium. Dreadful slaughter,
Official."</p>
<h2><a id="chap5" name="chap5">V - SHOULDER TO SHOULDER</a></h2>
<p class="first">With the morrow and the morning's papers the full meaning of
that vile treachery was apparent to the most credulous Englishman who had ever
been fooled by the shallow pretence of German friendship. Certain German
writers had been preaching the doctrine of German world supremacy for years,
but the Kaiser had always posed as the apostle of peace. Every child knew now
what the whole thing meant. The Kaiser's pose was assumed in order to dull
fools and visionaries into a false sense of security. And he had done his work
well!</p>
<p>At the same time, it was beyond question that the participation of England
in the strife had come as a rude shock to the conspirators in Potsdam. To a
certain extent they had been visionary, too, dreamers too prone to believe what
their spies had told them: England would never come in; she would never abandon
her slothful attitude; even if she did, her pampered, over-civilised population
would never permit her to strike a blow; and, again, if she did there would be
civil war in Ireland, India would rise like one man, and South Africa would
pass away from beneath the flag.</p>
<p>But all these hopes were destined to be dashed to the ground. England had no
army, it is true, except what Germany contemptuously regarded as a handful of
paid mercenaries which would never be augmented by a real fighting force.</p>
<p>But England knew different. It was easy for Germany, with her population in
the grip of the military party, to drag her children into the firing line
whether they liked it or not, and oblige them to make a virtue of necessity.
But Germany knew little of the real sporting spirit that brought recruits by
the hundred thousand even before they had been called. At that moment business
was forgotten; nobody heeded the Stock Exchange and the City, for there were
more vital interests at stake than mere money. The streets looked different,
there was a different spirit in the air, and with it all a quiet assurance that
everything would be well when the time came. The very newspapers were
transformed. No longer was any heed taken of the trivialities of life. For the
Germans were over the Belgian frontier, and already the mighty fighting machine
had encountered its first check.</p>
<p>Every line of this was eagerly absorbed by Kemp and Bentley as they sat
waiting for Ginger Smith and his friends.</p>
<p>"It was happy chance that brought us together last night," Bentley said. "I
don't know what I should have done if I had not met you. Fancy jogging along to
the office this morning by the tube, and sitting at a desk all day adding up
columns of figures! The mere thought of it makes me shudder. I should have had
to go, and I should have been miserable. And now everything is different."</p>
<p>"What are you going to do about it?" Kemp asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm not going back if that's what you mean. I'll ring up my old patriot
on the telephone presently and tell him he can look out for another prisoner. I
hope within an hour or two to be wearing the uniform of the Musketeers."</p>
<p>Anything Kemp would have said in reply was cut short by the intrusion of the
hall porter. He seemed to be struggling between annoyance and amusement.</p>
<p>"Beg your pardon, sir," he said. "But that there Ginger Smith's jest turned
up with about a hundred wot 'e calls recruits. 'E says as you've arsked them
all ter breakfast. I should jest 'ave sent them off, only down in the 'all a
lot o' waiters from Harrod's is turned up an' a van full of provisions. Of
course, sir, you know your own business best, an' if so be as Ginger's tellin'
the truth, why, then, sir, I suppose I'd better tell that lot as they can come
upstairs. If not, it seems ter me I'd better send for the police."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right," Kemp agreed.</p>
<p>"Might 'ave come off a racecourse. Class o' stuff wot you see 'anging around
the National Sporting Club when there's a big fight on. If I was you, sir, I'd
put all them nick-nacks away."</p>
<p>"I'm ashamed of you," Kemp said solemnly. "Do you know you're libelling sons
of the Empire? Do you know that all social distinctions have been swept away,
and that to-day we are all brothers? My good man, those chaps are recruits. You
won't know them in a fortnight. Show 'em up. And tell those people from
Harrod's to get the breakfast ready in the dining-room as soon as possible. By
Jove, this is something like life, isn't it? And only last week I couldn't make
up my mind which was the least boring way of spending August."</p>
<p>They came shuffling noisily up the stairs, a ragged, unwashed and
dilapidated crowd, following more or less shyly on Ginger's heels. It was quite
evident that some of them at least regarded the whole thing as a hoax on
Ginger's part. But Ginger led the way with a cheery grin on his pleasant face,
his natural audacity not in the least abashed by his surroundings. His greasy
cap was cocked over his left eye, and with his right eye he winked familiarly
at his host.</p>
<p>"'Ere yer are, sir," he said. "Abaht seventy of us altogether. An' a nice
job I 'ad ter get 'em 'ere. It's lucky for me as they all 'ad a good dye
yesterday, an' so they was travellin' dahn ter Richmond by the nine-five
instead o' walkin' as usual. So I cops the 'ole lot. Now, chaps, was Ginger a
liar or did 'e tell yer the truth?"</p>
<p>"Beg pardon, sir," an agonised voice in the background addressed Kemp. "I
don't know if yer knows Ginger as well as we do, but 'e says as 'ow 'e know'd a
cove, wot's yerself, sir, as 'ud given us all a invitation ter breakfast. We
was goin' caddyin', but seein' as 'ow we ain't wanted any more&mdash;well, it's
like this, sir. Someone's got ter put them bloomin' German swine in their right
plice, and there ain't one of us wot isn't ready ter do 'is little bit. 'An if
you'll be good enough ter give us a bit o' bread and cheese&mdash;"</p>
<p>"My good chaps, you shall have the best breakfast that money can buy. And I
shall be proud to march with you afterwards down to the headquarters of the
Musketeers. Now make yourselves at home. There isn't over much room, but we'll
manage somehow. You'll finds some cigarettes on the table yonder, and you can
smoke till the food is ready."</p>
<p>"This is very refreshing, William," a languid drawl came from the back of
the crowd. "Who says that the spirit of romance is dead? Show me the man who
dares to say that England is a decadent nation. But yesterday, William, I
should have said that our esteemed host was a pampered son of luxury, a sort of
human lily who toils not, neither does he spin."</p>
<p>"What have you got up in the corner there, Ginger?" Kemp laughed. "Who's the
aristocrat in the flannel shirt? And the gentleman named William in the blue
serge?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, sir," Ginger said, "Two toffs, I think. They comes up to me
at the station an' arsks wot's goin' on. Then the cove in the flannel suit, 'e
says 'e was out o' work along with the war, an' 'e up an' says 'e was comin'
along. An' the other bloke 'e says ditto. 'Ope you don't mind, sir."</p>
<p>"Oh, Lord, no," Kemp exclaimed. "The more the merrier. I think I must have a
few words with William."</p>
<p>"Quite right, old chap," the man called William drawled as he screwed a
glass into his left eye. "Bit of a liberty, of course, but I didn't think you
would mind under the circumstances. Fact is, me and my friend are stockbrokers,
at least we were yesterday. To-day we are unemployed. We'd like to join those
musketeers of yours, and if a couple of pretty useful motor cars are any
assistance to you, well, they're yours. Funny sight, this, isn't it? But it's
one to be proud of all the same."</p>
<h2><a id="chap6" name="chap6">VI - THE THIN BROWN LINE</a></h2>
<p class="first">It was a strange gathering. There was almost a touch of
nightmare in it: it was like a fantasy of Stevenson's, a page from some modern
Arabian Nights, and yet it seemed the most natural thing in the world. And when
presently the motley gathering filed down the stairs, and turned in the
semblance of a company into Kensington High-street nobody laughed, and a few
people on the pavement stopped and cheered. Women waved their handkerchiefs,
full of understanding, and indeed it did not need any vast intelligence to know
that here were a handful of men anxious to do something for the flag. The man
with the eyeglass disappeared for a moment into a shop and came back presently
with his arms full of red, white, and blue ribbons, which he gravely handed out
to the caddie squad, who as gravely put them in their caps. At the head of the
procession walked the man with the eyeglass and his friend, together with Kemp
and Bentley, as if they were doing the most natural thing in the world.</p>
<p>"By Gad, it's a sort of disease," the man with the eyeglass said. "Now, if
anybody had asked me to do this a week ago, I wouldn't have said yes for a
thousand pounds. And yet here am I at the head of all these chaps, and dashed
proud of the chance. I tell you what, we'd better make a long march of this. If
we'd only got a band, we'd gather the men by the hundred. A banner wouldn't be
a bad wheeze!"</p>
<p>True enough, as the procession straggled along towards Blackfriars, where
the headquarters of the Honourable Company of Fusiliers were situated, it was
augmented by scores of other men who were merely waiting for a lead. There was
something striking in the idea, a simplicity about it and a streak of humour
that appealed to the crowd. And then one of the caddies with a natural tenor
voice struck up some familiar song that carried them on jauntily till they came
to Blackfriars Bridge. They had fed well, too, probably the best meal that any
of them had ever tasted. It was fun of the wildest, maddest type of course, the
fun that Tommy loves on the march or in the teeth of danger, but behind it all
was a grimness of purpose and tenacity of grip that was not lost upon those who
had the eye to see beyond the apparent madness of it.</p>
<p>"My word," Kemp exclaimed. "We're not the only pebbles on the beach. Why,
the quadrangle's full of men."</p>
<p>It was even as the speaker said. Here was a big open barrack square with
buildings all around, and it was packed with perspiring humanity, all eager and
anxious to be doing something for the flag. They had come from all parts of
London, knowing the reputation of the Musketeers, and all grasping the fact
that through them lay the way swiftly and surely to the front. These were not
the men who waited to be asked, not the men who required to be spurred on by
platform appeals or to be bribed to do their country's work.</p>
<p>Here and there were men in uniform, a sergeant or two keeping the surging
mob back, and inside one of the big whitewashed rooms half a dozen doctors in
shirt-sleeves, hot and perspiring as they examined one recruit after another.
At a sign from Kemp, Bentley and the other two men turned down a stone-flagged
passage and entered a room where the captain in uniform was busy writing at a
desk.</p>
<p>"Could you spare me five minutes, Crighton?" Kemp asked. "I've got three
likely recruits for you, that is, of course, providing you've got any vacancies
left. It must be in the first battalion. Now, do you happen to know what
proportion of men have been rejected by the doctors this morning?"</p>
<p>"Well, a goodish few," the captain said. "And mostly old athletes, I am
sorry to say. That's the worst of overdoing it. A man keeps himself in strict
training by violent exercise; then he drops it, and his heart goes rocky. I can
fix up your pals all right. Have you got any more?"</p>
<p>"Yes, one," Kemp said. "And a rare character he is in his way, too. But
perhaps you may object to taking an ex-golf caddie? By the way, he has managed
to get hold of over 70 recruits, and bring them down here this
morning&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Oh, that sounds good," the captain said. "I shouldn't mind making room for
one or two of that type. The fact is, we must make up a battalion to-day. If we
do, we can get right away under canvas at Harrow to-morrow and start training.
I've no doubt most of our chaps will get commissions, but that's a secondary
consideration for the moment. I've had a tip from the War Office that if we can
lick ourselves into shape, as we ought to do pretty quickly, we shall be in
France by the beginning of September. Between ourselves, we've got over 50,000
men in France already. It's the smartest bit of work that the Transport Service
ever handled. And it will be a nice little surprise for that Potsdam scoundrel
when he runs up against us. But introduce me to your friends."</p>
<p>"Name of Allen," the man with the eyeglass drawled. "Winchester and
Cambridge. Until yesterday, Stock Exchange. Now, nothing doing, or likely to
be. This is my friend Garton. Also Winchester and Cambridge. Ditto Stock
Exchange. One of the unemployed, and anxious to do his bit. And if you want a
couple of good motor-cars they are at your disposal."</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll do," the captain said approvingly. "You're the type we want. I
had a good few men round here yesterday, but too many after commissions. I
suppose you know that you'll have to rough it unless you are on the same
game."</p>
<p>The man with the eyeglass grew serious.</p>
<p>"Well, we ain't," he said, "Don't know that I'd have one even if you offered
it me. Only last week I refused a chance of joining a shooting party in
Perthshire because a man was going who always makes a point of tucking his
table napkin under his chin. That's the sort of chap I was seven days ago. But
the call is in my blood now, and something has wiped all the snobbishness out
of me. I want to go and fight those German swine, and I'm not the only one of
my kidney by the hundred thousand. In a month's time you can go all over
England, and you won't find a single one of the nuts who isn't doing his duty.
Yet a little time back, if anybody had asked me, I should have said that we'd
all got a bit flabby. Well, it would have been a lie. I'm ready at the present
moment to lie down on the bare ground with any man who can call himself an
Englishman. I don't care a brass farthing whether he comes from Cambridge or
the New Cut. We're all brothers in arms now, and one man's as good as another.
Them's my sentiments, old cocky, and you can make the best of 'em. I suppose I
shall have to salute you and call you 'sir' in an hour or two, so I'm just
going to cheek you as long as I have the opportunity. It's all made of the
right spirit."</p>
<p>The captain nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>"Oh, I quite understand," he said. "And your sentiments do you credit. I'll
just take your names and see that you are shoved well forward, and then you
must excuse me, for really I am tearingly busy. You may have to stand in that
yard for hours before you pass the doctor, but I don't think that's going to
discourage men of your stamp. You ought to get your uniforms by this evening,
and I hope we shall be able to ask you to report to-morrow at Harrow. If you
take my advice, you won't lose sight of Kemp, and he'll pull you through. And
now I must wish you all good morning."</p>
<p>"Monty, my boy," Allen exclaimed, as he smote his companion on the back, "my
prophetic soul tells me we are going to live. Hitherto, we have only existed.
We are going to lie on the bare ground, instead of rose leaves; we are going to
eat bully beef instead of Murray's famous suppers; but, by Gad, it is good to
feel that life is keeping its best for us yet."</p>
<h2><a id="chap7" name="chap7">VII - "ENGLAND, HOME, AND BEAUTY"</a></h2>
<p class="first">The long, sweating afternoon was drawing to a close, and
gradually the patient yet light-hearted crowd in the quadrangle grew less.
There had been all sorts and conditions of men there, from the gilded youth who
came rolling up in his thousand-guinea car to the ragged nomad whose lips had
tasted no food that day, and yet who was as willing and eager as the rest of
them. It was strange to see young Oxford fraternising with Whitechapel, and
exquisites of the city comparing notes with the man who yesterday had left the
morning's milk in the area of their town houses. It seemed as if in one blast
all social barriers had been blown away; it was as if a dozen streams had
intermingled to make one vast sea of eager humanity. One by one the units
passed in through those big doors, only to emerge a little later, openly
exulting or correspondingly depressed. But these eager spirits formed the cream
of the nation's manhood, and the tally of the rejected was pleasingly small.
And as the crowd, dressed indifferently in purple and fine linen and greasy
rags, grew smaller, so, almost imperceptibly, the khaki began to assert itself.
In these very early stages of the war, there was no lack of uniforms and belts
and side arms, and Harold Bentley's heart beat high as he surveyed the eager
crowd. It came to his own turn presently to face the doctor, and a quarter of
an hour later he was surveying himself in a long looking-glass, a soldier of
the King and a defender of his country.</p>
<p>Outside in the quadrangle Kemp and the other two were awaiting him. There
was a broad smile on the faces of them all, and an assumption of ease that
deceived nobody. Up to them presently swaggered Ginger Smith. The little man
was transformed almost out of knowledge. He carried himself proudly, for he was
a born mimic and an actor of humorous parts, and he might have been a veteran
by the way in which he wore his uniform.</p>
<p>"It's all O.K.," he said. "I put the 'ole o' my little lot through, and
we're to report ourselves at 'arrow in the mornin'. But we ain't done yet, no
bloomin' likely. We're goin' ter meet to-night an' march through the streets
down our way wiv a band and everything proper."</p>
<p>"Good for you, Ginger," Kemp said. "Is it the Grenadiers' or the Coldstream
Guards' band you've got hold of?"</p>
<p>"Lor, bless yer, sir," Ginger grinned. "We ain't relyin' upon that sort o'
music. Perhaps you never 'eard o' Whistler Jordan. 'E's the champion wiv a
mawth organ. We've got four of 'em down our wye wot can knock spots off any
other performer in the Sawf o' London. An' you'll see us turnin' up tomorrow
mornin' with a regular harmy."</p>
<p>There was nothing to wait for now, nothing to be done before morning, and
Bentley began to turn his thoughts homewards. Apparently Kemp could see what
was passing in his mind, for he took his friend by the arm and led him towards
the Embankment.</p>
<p>"Well, it's all good so far, isn't it?" he asked. "You've done the right
thing, and you're in the right place. And now, don't you think it would be just
as well if you allowed me to go with you and see your mother and Nettie?"</p>
<p>"I was just thinking the same thing," Bentley confessed. "I suppose after
tomorrow we shall see little or nothing of our people till we go to the front.
And I should like my mother to feel that she has nothing to worry about in the
future."</p>
<p>"Well, it'll be her own fault if she does, old chap. But come along. By the
way, where do you live?"</p>
<p>Harold and his mother occupied a sitting-room and two bedrooms in a small
house out Willesden way, in a dingy road near the station. There was something
dreary and depressing in the neighbourhood; it was so suggestive of genteel
poverty that Kemp was almost afraid that Bentley might read his feelings in the
expression of his face. But he forgot all that presently, forgot the tiny
sitting-room, with its horsehair furniture and hideous chimney ornaments, when
he found himself face to face with Nettie Bentley. It was two years since they
had last met, two years in which she had grown from a child to a beautiful
young woman. Care and privation and the stress of life had laid a light hand
upon the perfect oval of that beautifully tinted face, and the blue eyes were
soft and thoughtful, the droop of the mouth a little pathetic. But all the old
daintiness and sweetness and refinement were there, and her environment had
left Nettie herself untouched. She might live in a street of workmen's
cottages; she might travel to town early each morning in the train devoted to
the white slaves of London, but she stood out from the rest of the girls like a
thing apart. There was a dainty touch of colour in her face as she held out her
hand to Ronald Kemp.</p>
<p>"It seems a long time since we last met;" she said. "It seems years since we
left the dear old house. I suppose you have not forgotten it? Those were happy
days."</p>
<p>"They were happy days to me," Kemp exclaimed. "Do you recollect&mdash;but I
suppose I must call you Miss Bentley now."</p>
<p>"No, please don't," the girl said. "I always think of you as Ronald. And I
am so glad that you and Harold have met again. It was so silly of him to drop
all his old friends. It did not matter so much for mother and myself. But what
have you been doing? Harold, do you mean to say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"You're not displeased, Nettie, are you?"</p>
<p>"Displeased! Why, I'm proud of you! I'd rather see you in that uniform
than&mdash;well, you know what I mean. My dear boy, you could not stay away.
And I am so glad that you have not stopped to consider us. We shall manage
somehow. I feel quite sure that there will be plenty of work for women before
long. And I shall be proud to go behind the counter to take the place of a man
who has gone to the front. It will be almost as good as fighting oneself."</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, he was thinking about you," Kemp said. "Now, shut up,
Harold, shut up. This is where I come in, and I'm not going to be interrupted.
You can't make Harold really respectable, you know. What do you think he was
doing when I met him? You'll never guess. He was having a punching match with a
greasy Socialist in Trafalgar Square. I literally dragged him out of the hands
of the police and took him off to my flat, where I made him tell me everything.
Now I'm going to make a suggestion to Mrs. Bentley which I hope won't offend
her. You see, Harold has done it now, and he's got to fight, whether he wants
to or not. He's a full private in the Honourable Company of Musketeers, and
within a month's time he will be doing his little bit in France. So shall I for
that matter. But he doesn't want to leave you all alone, and I happen to have a
sister that I'm fond of, too. Unfortunately, it happens that her
housekeeper-companion-chaperon has had to leave, and I am at my wits' end to
find someone I can rely upon to take her place. That's why I regard my meeting
with Harold last night as providential. When he told me everything, I said to
myself that Mrs. Bentley was absolutely born for the part. There is not much to
do, and&mdash;and&mdash;help me out, Harold."</p>
<p>"It's a jolly well-paid job," Bentley, said curtly.</p>
<p>"Thanks, old chap. Thank goodness we've done with that part of it. Now,
Nettie, do you think your mother will be good enough to take this anxiety off
my mind? It's a nice house, and I remember that you and my sister Dorothy used
to be great chums. She's always regretting the fact that she's lost sight of
you. If this comes off, you will have plenty of time for that artistic work of
yours&mdash;"</p>
<p>Nettie's eyes were bright with tears.</p>
<p>"Oh, it will be glorious," she cried. "Mother will be more than
glad&mdash;she will be grateful. And I shall be able to do something I've been
longing to ever since the war broke out. I must&mdash;I must get to the front
as a nurse."</p>
<h2><a id="chap8" name="chap8">VIII - "TIPPERARY"</a></h2>
<p class="first">They had come from the north and south, from the east and west
in their thousands at the first sign of danger. Not that any one of them
admitted that the Empire was in peril, for such a thing was incredible. Was not
Britain the mistress of the sea, and had she not been so for centuries? And did
she not possess the finest navy that the world had ever seen? It was a hard
thing to make the typical Englishman believe that within thirty years Germany
could build up a fleet to compare with ours. To begin with, her people had not
the right blood in their veins; they had no traditions, and practically no
seaboard. Where were the men coming from, to cope with sailors who were the
sons and grandsons of the men descended from the followers of Hawkins and
Frobisher and Drake?</p>
<p>And again, at the very outbreak of hostilities, the German fleet had been
carefully shepherded in the North Sea, and driven behind the shelter of
Heligoland. If anything happened now, it would be from the fact that England
was too confident.</p>
<p>Still, he national anger was aroused, for the callous betrayal of Belgium
had sunk deep into the hearts of the people in whom the love of honour and fair
play was instilled from childhood. And England exulted in the staggering blows
which little Belgium had dealt the great bully in the early days of the
campaign. All London rocked with excitement; the name of King Albert was
cheered to the echo in every place of amusement, and the sons of Britain came
rolling in. They came so fast at first that they taxed the resources of the
authorities to the uttermost. England became one armed camp, and the tents of
the fighting men were as pebbles on the seashore.</p>
<p>A month had passed by as if it had been no more than a breath. Out Harrow
way the men of the Musketeers were working side by side without distinction.
The man who a week or two before had been in authority over scores of
fellow-creatures was now content to stand at attention before the young
subaltern who a little time ago might have been taking down his letters. But it
is all part of the great game, and even professional humorists like Ginger
Smith forgot to smile.</p>
<p>He had taken to his work as if he had been born to it. In a month he was a
smart soldier in a smart regiment, and he thrilled with secret pride as he
heard the general who inspected them pronounce them to be the equal of any line
regiment of the country. He was keen on getting recruits, too. Few days passed
without one or two of them coming along at Ginger's instigation. He had
developed, too, a certain rugged eloquence of his own, half-humorous and
half-pathetic, that went a long way at meetings where his own class were
concerned. He had rather a good voice, of which he was sufficiently proud, and
he was not modest in the use of it. He grinned from ear to ear at Kemp's
suggestion that he should motor over to the latter's place for a recruiting
meeting one evening and address a few remarks to some of the labourers in the
district, who were somewhat slow in appreciating the situation. For some little
time now Mrs. Bentley had been established at The Keep House, and Nettie
Bentley was on the high road to gratify her darling ambition.</p>
<p>"Now you come, Ginger, and give us a song," Kemp suggested. "And my sister
shall play your accompaniments for you."</p>
<p>"You does me proud, sir," Ginger said, smilingly. "Ah, I've heard the lady
play accompaniments before. A regular dab at the gime she is. Only give 'er a
charnce ter look at the music and she's on it like a bird. What shall I sing,
sir?"</p>
<p>"Well, what were you singing last night just before you turned in?" Bentley
asked. "It was something with a real lilt in it. Ripping good chorus, too."</p>
<p>"Oh, you means 'Tipperary,'" Ginger cried. "It was in last year's
pantomimes, and didn't seem ter catch on no 'ow. But it's wot the Yanks call
the goods. Cully&mdash;which I mean, sir&mdash;and no mistake abaht it. It's
the best marching song as we've 'ad for many a dye. And, you see, there's wot
them writin' blokes calls a halegory; means it's a long, long wye ter
Tipperary, which yer can call Berlin if yer like, and whilst the blokes ain't
making too light of the little job afore 'em they're goin' ter get there all
the sime. And fer all I say it as shouldn't, I can sing that little ditty a
fair treat. Me an' the lidy'll rope 'em in properly between the two of us."</p>
<p>Ginger turned out to be no false prophet. For the first time a mixed and
crowded audience heard 'Tipperary' sung as it should be with its humorously
pathetic touch, heard it sung by a British Tommy, a soldier of the King proud
of his uniform, and the task that lay before him. The song is a classic now,
and will go down to posterity as such, but it was new then, and it gripped the
audience as it has gripped the sons of the flag in every quarter of the globe
many a time since then. Long before Ginger had finished he had the sons of the
soil roaring the chorus with all the fervour of a national slogan. His voice
was just a little unsteady, but the cheery impudence of the little man never
deserted him for a moment. He turned with a friendly wink to the slim dark
beauty in evening dress who was at the piano. Ginger had a fine eye for a
dramatic effect.</p>
<p>"Don't you stop, miss," he whispered. "You go on 'ammerin' at that there
chorus for all you're worth, and I'll give yer brother the tip ter get the 'ole
bahnder in the chair to invite recruits up on the platform."</p>
<p>Dorothy Kemp nodded graciously. She could see what was uppermost in Ginger's
mind, and her fingers crashed out the inspiring chords of the chorus. Almost
before the chairman opened his mouth there was an eager rush for the platform.
It was Ginger's hour, and he knew it, the first of many triumphs he was to win
alongside those friends of his who had picked him up in the gutter and given
him the chance to show the splendid manhood that was his.</p>
<p>"That's a smart move of yours, Ginger," Bentley whispered.</p>
<p>"Yus," Ginger said modestly. "That was a bit of alright, that was. 'An if
you can get these blokes in the recruitin' offices to work 'Tipperary' for all
it's worth you'll 'ave the chaps tumblin' over one another ter 'ave a smack at
them 'Uns as yer call 'em. You leave it to us. There ain't nothin' the matter
with our little lot if you treats us the right way."</p>
<p>Down at the back of the hall a lean, brown-faced man with captain's stars on
his sleeve was watching the proceedings with deepest interest. He made his way
to the platform presently, and called Kemp and Bentley on one side.</p>
<p>"How did you three manage to get leave to-night?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's all right, sir," Kemp said. "We've got to be back at 10. The
chairman is rather a pal&mdash;I mean a friend&mdash;of the colonel's, and
therefore&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Well, never mind that," the captain said. "I want you to forget just for a
moment that I am your company officer, and that you are two of my men. I
believe your mother's here, isn't she Bentley, and I think that is Miss Kemp at
the piano? Now, would you be good enough to just go and say good-bye to them,
and ask them not to say a word about it to anybody."</p>
<p>Bentley's eyes gleamed, and Kemp caught his breath eagerly.</p>
<p>"Good man!" he whispered. "Oh, I think we understand. Here, don't be captain
just for a minute. Do you mean that we are on the move, Crighton, on the way to
the&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Steady, steady," the captain whispered. "If I am doing wrong, don't give me
away. At half-past ten to-night we start for Waterloo in the clothes we stand
up in. And by this time to-morrow we shall be&mdash;somewhere else."</p>
<p>"Off to the front," Kemp whispered. "Think of it, Harold! My aunt, what a
bit of glorious luck!"</p>
<h2><a id="chap9" name="chap9">IX - "THE GIRL HE LEFT BEHIND HIM"</a></h2>
<p class="first">The glorious news seemed almost too good to be true. It was
incredible to believe that only a month ago scores of the Musketeers had been
slaving over a desk, or at the best looking forward to a month's vapid holiday
at the seaside. Only five weeks ago their minds had been intent on socks and
tennis flannels, on golf clubs, and, in more sentimental mood, their thoughts
had been of the moon and the sea and a cosy seat at the end of the pier. Now
all this was wiped out as if a gigantic sponge had been drawn across the mind
of the nation. It all seemed so futile and so small by comparison.</p>
<p>For the great adventure had come, and some day, when the history of it is
written, the world will begin to understand the true inwardness and force of
the uprising of the young blood of the British Empire almost before the bugles
had been heard calling. Slackers there were, no doubt, but Bentley and Kemp had
seen none of them; so far as they knew, everybody had responded to the cry for
men.</p>
<p>It was glorious to think that the desk and the sweat and toil of the city
had vanished when the first shot had been fired, and that the rest would be a
breathless struggle to the end. Yet, at the same time, Harold Bentley could not
shake off a certain vague, uneasy depression. It was not fear; he was not
shrinking from what lay before him; on the contrary, the desire to be up and
doing gnawed at him like the pangs of a fierce hunger. He wondered what it was,
and why he should feel like this.</p>
<p>And then suddenly it came to him.</p>
<p>He glanced down the hall towards the doorway, where he could see Dorothy
Kemp's slim, graceful figure and the light gleaming on her dark, beautiful
features. She was talking interestedly to a thin, effeminate-looking man with
pale features, a man whose eyeglass made him look still more womanly. He was
beautifully dressed and beyond all question exceedingly good-looking. And it
seemed to Harold that those two were perhaps a little more than friendly. The
man was a stranger to him, but he was conscious of a tinge of jealousy all the
same. And in that moment he realised that there was going to be something still
more painful than the parting with his mother and Nettie. It was only a short
walk from the Musketeers' camp to The Keep House, and, in spite of a lot of
hard work, Harold had contrived to put in a good deal of time there in the
evenings. And he knew now, as if somebody had opened up a book before him, that
he had given his heart to Dorothy Kemp, without, so far, seeking anything in
return.</p>
<p>"Who is the man talking to your sister, Ronnie?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's a chap called Paul Venables," Kemp explained. "He's an American.
No end of a clever fellow, but just a bit too sarcastic for me. But, in spite
of his childish appearance, he's no end good at sport, and a splendid shot. He
seems to have plenty of money, and I understand that he represents two or three
American newspapers."</p>
<p>"Have you known him long?" Bentley asked, carelessly.</p>
<p>"About a year, I suppose. He's got a bungalow in this neighbourhood. He's
rather a favourite with Dorothy."</p>
<p>Harold would have liked to ask further questions, but wisely refrained. If
Dorothy and the American had been more than friends, Kemp would have been sure
to have mentioned it.</p>
<p>"Look here," Bentley said suddenly; "there's no reason to say good-bye here.
Let's go up to your place for half an hour, and we shall be able to tell them
quietly what's going to happen. Then we can run over to the camp in one of your
cars."</p>
<p>It was a good suggestion as far as it went, but it was not an easy matter to
shake off the American. He strolled calmly alongside Mrs. Bentley, chatting
casually to her, and he entered the house with them with the air of a man who
has no doubt on the score of his welcome. It was some little time before
Bentley contrived to detach Dorothy from the others with the suggestion that it
was too lovely a night to stay indoors. He saw Venables raise his eyebrows, and
the gesture somewhat irritated him; but he could afford to ignore it, since he
had obtained his own way and was at last alone with Dorothy in the moon-flooded
garden.</p>
<p>"Do you know, I am sure you have something to say to me," she said. "I have
never seen Ronnie so absent-minded before. I do hope there is no trouble."</p>
<p>"Well, I should hardly call it that," Harold murmured. "But the fact is, we
are going to the front."</p>
<p>It seemed to Harold that his companion's face changed a little in the
moonlight.</p>
<p>"Do you mean at once?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"Yes, to-night. It is an absolute secret, of course. That is why I was
rather sorry that your friend, Mr. Venables, came back with us. It was
impossible to get rid of him without appearing to be rude, but we were
specially cautioned not to breathe a word to anybody about it. Naturally, we
should tell you and my mother and sister, but no one else. I believe, though
the country knows nothing of it we have nearly two hundred thousand men in
France already. It has been a marvellous bit of work. And I wanted to tell you
before I told anybody else."</p>
<p>"That was very kind of you, Harold," the girl murmured. "Of course, in a way
I'm glad and proud to think that you're going, but now that the time has come
it is a terrible wrench. It makes me feel as if some weight is pressing on
me&mdash;oh, I know it sounds cowardly, but we have been such friends all these
years&mdash;"</p>
<p>Dorothy broke off abruptly, and turned her head away. On the impulse of the
moment, Bentley stooped and took her hand in his.</p>
<p>"You make me feel like a coward, too," he said. "I felt just the same when
Crighton told us just now that we were going. I did not know why at first; and
then I found out. It was because I am going to leave you."</p>
<p>"And your mother and sister. I understand."</p>
<p>"No, I don't think you do," Harold murmured. "It isn't the same thing. A man
may be very fond of his mother and sister, but there comes a time when somebody
else gets in front of them. That's what you've done, Dorothy. And I am selfish
enough to want to know before we go out whether I'm leaving behind me a friend,
or something more. Very greedy of me, isn't it? Most men would be satisfied to
be able to boast of the friendship of a glorious girl like you. They would say
it was infernally selfish to ask for anything more at a time like this. And,
really, it does seem a blackguard thing to try to tie a girl up to a man who
might never come back again, But if you understood my feelings, I am quite sure
that you would forgive me&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Stop!" Dorothy cried. She was facing Harold now, and her dark eyes were
full of tender purpose. "It would have been selfish had you not told me. Oh, my
dear boy, do you think I have not seen? Do you think any woman could be blind
to the knowledge of the love that is there before her eyes? And do you think I,
as a girl who loves my country, wouldn't really be happier to know that she has
a man out there who was risking his life and young manhood for the Empire? Why,
I should boast of it, I could not keep the knowledge to myself. I should be
sorry for other girls less fortunate than myself. And if you never came back,
and if you had never spoken at all, I should still have grieved for you as
sincerely as if&mdash;"</p>
<p>She broke off and laid her hands upon Harold's shoulders. Then she raised
herself up, and pressed her lips to his.</p>
<p>"There," she said, unsteadily. "Perhaps now you understand. And after that
I'm not going to keep you from your mother and sister for another minute."</p>
<p>And Harold followed her without another word.</p>
<h2><a id="chap10" name="chap10">X - BOOT AND SADDLE</a></h2>
<p class="first">The word had gone round the camp, and every tent there hummed
like a swarm of bees. There was no fuss or bustle or confusion, only the
knowledge that the time for action had come, and that the morrow would see the
Musketeers on the soil of France. It was some time before midnight when the
first company marched out in the direction of Harrow station. Then another and
another followed until the tents were deserted and ready for the next battalion
to come along, and it was not long past 2 when the whole regiment, in four
darkened trains, slid out or Waterloo station on its way to Southampton. There
were many units amongst them now who had come from the dockside and the
workshops on the Thames, for there had been a heavy call on the Musketeers to
find officers for the new army. Bentley and Kemp might have reckoned themselves
amongst them had they not set their face against all temptation. They were too
keen to fight for that. They knew that promotion meant many months in some
English camp whilst the rest of the battalion was upholding the honour of the
Empire in the trenches.</p>
<p>It was a hot night, and the moon was lifting high over the waters long
before Southampton was reached. With its drawn blinds and its six men crowded
on either side of the carriage, the compartment in which Kemp and Bentley found
themselves was horribly stifling. Here were all sorts and conditions of men
from the 'Varsity type to Ginger Smith squeezed up in the corner, and making
night hideous with his mouth organ. And yet they were all friends together, all
on perfect equality, no man asserting his superiority. The chaff was fast and
furious; it was more like a bank holiday crowd at Margate than a choice
selection of the cream of England's manhood going out to face the reeking hell
of war. Still, Bentley and his friend drew a breath of relief as the train
pulled up in the dock siding, and it was possible to breathe the pure
atmosphere again.</p>
<p>Just a few yards away lay the long black transport, already packed with
troops. There was hardly a man there who had more kit than he stood up in, for
all this had been promised them on the other side. In the dim distance, riding
in the water, were the half-dozen destroyers told off to accompany the
transports on their voyage.</p>
<p>It was all so new and exciting that few indeed had the slightest desire to
go down below. Soon after daybreak they would be somewhere in France, so they
lay on the deck in the moonlight, chattering to one another with the zest of
schoolboys engaged in some new adventure. Ginger Smith had procured a bucket
from somewhere, and was using it as a seat. There was a cigarette in the corner
of his mouth, and a smile of deep content on his impudent, freckled face.</p>
<p>"Now, this is what I call a bit of alright," he said. "It's very nice to
think o' the Government goin' out o' their way ter send us on a little 'oliday
trip like this. I never 'ad one before, 'cept once when I went dahn ter Morget
for the day on one o' them steamers from Tilbury dock. It was the time wot I
picked up a toff's purse on the golf links, an' 'e give me a quid for wot 'e
called me honesty."</p>
<p>"How much was in that purse, Ginger?" Bentley asked.</p>
<p>"Fifteen bob," Ginger grinned. "Per'aps if there'd 'ave bin more there
wouldn't 'ave bin so much honesty abaht. Well, I gives myself a treat, an' off
I goes 'on a beano ter Morget. An' when I gets there a cove offers me a 'ole
bathin' machine ter meself for a bob. So I bithed in style and catched a cold
as larsted me for three months. It's all wot ye're accustomed to. I don't so
much mind it now, but it was a very painful shock at the time."</p>
<p>All this with a perfectly grave face and not so much as a twinkle in
Ginger's blue eyes. He was perfectly at home, as indeed he would have been
anywhere. There were many who gathered round to listen to Ginger's nonsense and
unfailing flow of spirits that nothing could damp and nothing could undermine.
And the time was coming when his airy nonsense was destined to brighten many a
cold and bitter night, and make those in retreat before the German host forget
for the moment the bitterness of defeat. But no cloud hung over the Musketeers
just now. They were humming across the sea in the direction of the fight, and
on either side of them, like sinister shadows, the black destroyers crept
along. And so the hours passed until the dawn came and Boulogne Harbour was
reached.</p>
<p>"I suppose we shall get some breakfast presently," Kemp suggested. "Not that
I can see any sign of it."</p>
<p>But breakfast was not yet. There was a long, hot march over the hill and the
long sand dunes on the other side before an halt was called and a biscuit per
man served out. As far as the eye could reach were the rolling sands, and just
inside them long stretches of vivid green, with here and there turf still finer
and greener than the rest. On the rising ground flanked by a clump of trees
stood a long, imposing pavilion. Ginger rubbed his eyes as he lighted a
cigarette and struggled to his feet.</p>
<p>"Well, if this don't make me fair 'omesick," he said. "'Ere, you blokes, wot
d'yer think o' that? Ever see anything like it before, Bill? Konky, what's that
place yonder wif a tarpaulin roof? What price Richmond?"</p>
<p>"Why, strike me if it ain't a caddy shed!" the man addressed as Konky
exclaimed. "Fairly brings the tears in me eyes, it do. Why, I can shut me
peepers an' feel the 'arf crohns droppin' inter me fist. Two rounds an' a 'arf,
I says, an' he gives me four bob. Say, mate, it is a golf course, ain't
it?"</p>
<p>"That's right," Kemp laughed. "I suppose you've heard of Le Touquet. Well,
this is Le Touquet."</p>
<p>"Yus, an' 'Arry Vardon laid it aht," Ginger said. "Good course, ain't it,
sir? Blimme, if them bloomin' French ain't gone up in my estimation."</p>
<p>"It is a good course," Kemp said. "Probably the best on the Continent. Ever
played here, Harold?"</p>
<p>"It's little golf I've played the last few years," Bentley said. "But it
looks all right."</p>
<p>"Yes, and it is all right. I had three weeks of it at Easter, and never
played better in my life. Who would have thought then that we should be here on
such an errand now? A month or two ago golf was the only game I was really keen
on. And now, if you put a club in my hands, I wouldn't take the trouble to
drive a ball with it. I seem to have lost all my taste for that sort of thing.
But it is a good course."</p>
<p>A bugle sounded somewhere in the distance, and once more the battalion were
on the march again. They passed along in the baking sunshine over the hard, dry
roads like a piece of living machinery. They were tired and hungry, but not one
man fell out, not one dropped by the way. There were those amongst them, too,
who a few weeks before had been mere weeds, flotsam and jetsam of the great
city, half-starved, and weak and incapable of anything in the way of exertion
from the sheer need of food. And now here they were, strong and well set-up,
alert and eager, clear-eyed and clean-skinned, real live men, better for the
storm that had broken over Europe. It was quite late in the afternoon before
the battalion reached the village, where they found billets in a score or two
of barns, and lay there on the clean straw waiting the arrival of the supply
wagons. A major came along, and his eyes gleamed with satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Nothing the matter with this little lot," he said to his subaltern. "By
Gad, the old regiment is going to keep up its reputation. Not one man left
behind after a 12-mile march, and the sun at least 90 in the shade! We'll show
those chaps presently how far it is to Tipperary!"</p>
<h2><a id="chap11" name="chap11">XI - THE SHADOW OF MONS</a></h2>
<p class="first">It had been a long and bitter day, and the little force known
as the Honourable Company of Musketeers had been sorely pressed, and, though no
man confessed it, they were praying for the darkness. They had come up a week
or two before, and had been thrown directly into the firing line. It was trying
them high indeed, a terrible ordeal for young, unseasoned troops, to thrust
them headlong against the cream of the German infantry, but there had been no
help for it. Over in England, people were rejoicing in successive victories,
and some, indeed, were obsessed with the idea that the German flood was broken,
and that the crisis was past. Heaven alone knows why the authorities at home
were wrapping the people in the cotton wool of optimism, but those at the front
knew better; they knew that every man was needed; they knew that if that line
was broken Paris was doomed.</p>
<p>They knew how unprepared we were, and that France was not in much better
case than ourselves. And so a harassed general, who hardly knew which way to
turn, had welcomed the advent of the Musketeers as something like a godsend. He
did not want to do it; he hated the necessity, but there was no
alternative.</p>
<p>"It's got to be done," he told the colonel of the Musketeers. "Now, here's
the map; there are the trenches, and you have got to hold them for 24 hours.
And, what's more, you must hold them at any cost. You know what that means, and
you know your own men better than I do. Good morning."</p>
<p>"Better make it good-bye, sir," the colonel replied. "That's about what it
will come to. As you say, I do know my men, and they'll stay where they are
told till the last one is left."</p>
<p>It was no idle boast. All that day the Musketeers had stuck grimly to their
task under a hell of shot and shell and unprotected by their own artillery.
They had seen the Prussians advance to the attack again and again in close
formation, only to be mown down by the rain of lead and the hail of machine gun
fire till the grey corpses were piled up in ghastly heaps out there in the
open, and some of the Musketeers, more daring than the rest, were firing with
red-hot barrels behind a rampart of the dead. The line was thinner now by
something like 25 per cent of the battalion, but still they held on, black and
grimed and bloodshot, tortured by thirst and racked with the pains of hunger.
But they held on.</p>
<p>They were fighting now with one eye on the foe and the other on the sinking
sun. They could expect no slackening in the attack, no mouthful of food or
water for their parched lips, until darkness fell. Now and again a handful of
the foe in advance of the rest slopped over into the trench like grey foam
blown on the gale, only to find themselves bayoneted with savage thrusts and
trampled underfoot. To the left of the trench the Germans had managed to
establish a machine gun in a little hollow, half-enfilading the defenders, and
rendering some of the younger men jumpy and unsteady. And yet they held on,
these boys who only a few weeks before had been living in the soft lap of
luxury or starving in the slums. And they were up against the pick and marrow
of the Kaiser's troops. They were fighting desperately, hanging on with teeth
and eyebrows, opposite men trained to the moment, men who had played the war
game for years. It was a case of each for himself, for most of the officers
were down now, and every one of the Musketeers had only himself to think
of.</p>
<p>In the corner of the second trench Bentley and Kemp, together with Allen and
Garton, had established themselves. Ginger, crouching at their feet, had made
himself a porthole, through which he was firing grimly. Then came a shot from
that accursed machine gun and smashed the rifle in his hand; then another that
lifted his cap from his head.</p>
<p>"'Ot work, guvnors," he said. "That's wot in polite circles they used ter
call 'a little bit off the top.' 'Ot work, boys, but it's goin' ter be 'otter
where we sent them Germans to. 'As any gent got a gun 'e don't want?"</p>
<p>But there was no lack of rifles. Half a dozen lay at Ginger's feet for the
asking. He shook his head angrily, like a terrier tormented by flies, as the
machine gun bullets rattled round him; then he dropped the rifle he had
snatched up and rose to his feet.</p>
<p>"'Ere," he said, "I'm going to stop that gime. Mr. Bentley, I knows you've
got a revolver in yer pocket."</p>
<p>"I have," Bentley said. "What do you want it for?"</p>
<p>"Well, I'm goin' ter do in the bloke wot's playin' that trombone. If I don't
get 'is number 'e'll get mine. An' I'll be just as sife wrigglin' on me belly
aht yonder as doin' the livin' statuary busness 'ere."</p>
<p>There was logic in Ginger's remark, and in any case there was no officer by
to say him nay. He edged his way cautiously over the corner of the trench, and
crept along like a snake between two rows of beetroot. It was a mad action,
rash and hazardous to the verge of insanity, but there were many such that day,
and the dark days that followed, of which there is no record, and never will be
now. And none knew better than Ginger, despite his cheery optimism, that the
odds against him were as a thousand to one. But still he thrust his way forward
with a cheery smile in his eyes and the familiar grin upon his parched and
blackened lips.</p>
<p>Nearer and nearer he came till he could hear the bullets screaming like a
telephone wire in the wind over his head; nearer and nearer he came till the
discharge from the gun was hot upon his cheeks. He was fairly safe now, as far
as the maxim was concerned, but the crux of his task had yet to come. He had to
get behind that machine and take the three men working it. Inch by inch he
crept on till the muzzle of the gun actually seemed to rest on his shoulder.
Then he leapt to his feet and pushed the murderous weapon over sideways. He was
looking so close into the eyes of the gun crew that he could see the colour of
their lashes and their grinning teeth. Their rifles lay behind them, so that
they were practically at his mercy. He stifled a cry of exultation that was
bursting on his lips; then the revolver spoke three times, and three grey
corpses lay in the sandy hollow. And then Ginger went mad.</p>
<p>He simply couldn't help it. He was so full of the insanity of triumph that
he would have faced the whole of the German army at that moment. With a yell of
defiance he jumped to his feet and lifted the Maxim upon his shoulder. Then he
staggered coolly along with his burden and threw it down in the trench close to
where Bentley and his friends were standing. He dropped lightly down under
cover again, and wiped the dripping moisture from his eyes. He was absolutely
untouched; it was one of the marvels that do happen on the field of battle.</p>
<p>"'Ere,"' he gasped. "Anybody got a birfday? Cos, if they 'ave, I've got a
present for 'em."</p>
<p>"You'll hear more of this, my friend," Kemp said grimly. "I've seen some
plucky things to-day, but nothing to touch that. Here the devils come
again."</p>
<p>Once more the grey flood was beaten back; then as the darkness fell the
attack gradually died down, save for an occasional shot from a big gun in the
distance. Utterly exhausted, the Musketeers lay there waiting for the food and
drink of which they were in such dire need. It came presently in the shape of a
wagon or two and a relief of Army Service men, and with them a man in civilian
dress, a dapper man with a glass carefully screwed into his eye, at the sight
of whom Bentley gasped with astonishment. He forgot his thirst for the
moment.</p>
<p>"D'you see that?" he asked Kemp. "Now, how on earth did he get here? You see
who it is, don't you?"</p>
<p>"By Jove!" Kemp exclaimed. "Why, it's that chap Venables. Just think of the
utter cheek of it!"</p>
<h2><a id="chap12" name="chap12">XII - FOG OF WAR</a></h2>
<p class="first">The American appeared to be as much at home there as if he had
been passing weeks in the trenches. There was something almost supercilious in
the way in which he glanced about him; he might have been seeking acquaintances
in Hyde Park. Then all at once his manner changed, and he advanced with
outstretched hand in Bentley's direction. But their curiosity was fleeting,
for, now that dusk had fallen and the attack was beaten off, they were utterly
worn and weary, done to the world, and conscious only of the wild hunger
gnawing at them. They lay in the mud with their backs to the trench, with eyes
only for the little knot of men who had pushed through the precious food.</p>
<p>"How did you get here?" Kemp asked languidly.</p>
<p>"In the metaphor of my country, search me," the American said. "I am too old
a citizen of the world to be surprised at anything. But I don't mind telling
you that I am supposed to be with the German forces. I came from the lines
behind Mons with half a dozen swagger staff guides to see the contemptible
English wiped out. But something went wrong with the little programme, and all
those pretty boys found themselves mixed up with some of your Highlanders, who
were too dense, I guess, to know when they were beaten, and, when I'd sorted
myself out of the fog, I was kind of a prisoner. But they were decent boys and
quite good friends as soon as they understood what had happened. Then they got
busy again, and I drifted about till some of your A.S.C. men took me in tow,
and here I am."</p>
<p>It all sounded quite plausible, the more so as Venables dipped his hand in
the pocket of his big coat and produced half a dozen packets of cigarettes,
which he distributed with fine impartiality. He was complimentary, too, and
made no secret of the way in which his sympathies lay.</p>
<p>"Oh, you jarred them up all right," he said. "They were talking about you
chaps this morning. Couldn't make out how it was that you were holding out. I
guess they thought that, as you were little bits of recruits&mdash;"</p>
<p>Kemp and Bentley were no longer listening. They had eyes only for the beef
and biscuit which was being handed out none too liberally. A big man with his
arm in a sling and a bandage round his head limped painfully along the trench.
Bentley and Kemp struggled to their feet, but the other held up his hand.</p>
<p>"Don't get up," he said. "I have come to see how you men are getting along.
You've done splendidly to-day, and I shall see that your good work is not
forgotten. What's all this I hear about a German Maxim? Did any of you see it?
Unfortunately, you seem to have no officer left."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid that's true, sir," Kemp said. "That's the man over there, the
man with the red hair."</p>
<p>Colonel Lord Hailsham had dropped down on an empty cartridge box and
listened with a grim smile to the story of Ginger's achievement. He listened
perhaps a little suspiciously to Venables' account of his adventures.</p>
<p>"Very fine," he said. "Very fine indeed. And do you mean to say that you
haven't got a sergeant left?"</p>
<p>"I don't believe there's one, sir," Bentley replied.</p>
<p>"Really. Well, it can't be helped; you in this trench must do the best you
can with what you've got. I'm sorry to tell you that we are absolutely cut off,
with no chance so far as I can see of any relief. The other half of the
battalion may manage to force their way through, but they will be very
fortunate if they do. And there is worse than that. We are absolutely without
ammunition, either for the machine guns or the rifles. And two of our batteries
have been abandoned on the hill yonder, with all their ammunition and ours,
too. If I had a map I could show you exactly where&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Excuse me, my lord," Venables interrupted. "But I happen to know the place
you mean. I was there this morning. I saw those abandoned guns as late as at
four o'clock this afternoon. They are in the spur of a wood, and I don't
believe the Germans know a bit about them. Of course, I am a correspondent and
strictly neutral, but somehow I can't forget that a century or two ago my
ancestors lived in your old country. And, if you like, and you really want to
have a dash for those guns, well, I'm going that way, and if your men follow me
it isn't for me to go out of my way to make myself unpleasant."</p>
<p>"Is that what you want, sir?" Kemp asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"I think so. After all, it's only a question of a few hours for us. And if a
dozen or so of you could get up to those gnus and blow them up with their
ammunition and bring back some of our cartridges, well, I shan't stop you."</p>
<p>It was quiet in the trenches now, for the men had fed like wolves, and the
company there were greatly thankful for the American's cigarettes. In the dim
light their black and grimy faces were turned eagerly towards the big figure
seated there on the empty cartridge box. It was so quiet, too, that every word
he said carried all along the trench.</p>
<p>"Of course, we'll do it, sir," Kemp said. "And I am quite sure that every
man will volunteer."</p>
<p>A sudden shout went up, and in an instant the thin line of khaki was on its
feet. The colonel smiled approvingly, then he sharply commanded the men to sit
down again. But there was no annoyance on his face; nothing in him but pride
and sorrow in the knowledge that these were his boys.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's the spirit," he murmured. "Now, I believe that you two are old
O.T.C.'s. You will regard yourselves for the moment as acting lieutenants. And
that red haired man yonder who is so obviously listening to all I am saying had
better become a sergeant for the moment. Come here, Smith."</p>
<p>With his jaunty smile and ready audacity, Ginger jumped to his feet and
saluted smartly. The colonel prided himself on the fact that there was no man
in his regiment whom he did not know by name. Ginger was no exception to the
rule.</p>
<p>"I am proud of you, Smith," the colonel said. "I am proud of you all for the
matter of that. Some day perhaps you will know what you have accomplished in
the last twenty-four hours. You have managed somehow to hold up a whole German
Army Corps, and you have saved the guns. And if you had retreated nobody could
have possibly blamed you. Well, we're all in it together, and if we find
ourselves tomorrow back with our brigade it will be nothing less than a
miracle. That's all I've got to say. I suppose this gentleman won't mind my
suggesting in the circumstances that I am taking some little risk."</p>
<p>"These two men of yours know me, my lord," Venables said.</p>
<p>Kemp confirmed the statement eagerly enough. Neither he nor Bentley was
blind to the danger that lay before them; they knew well enough that the next
few hours would probably see the end of the Musketeers. It was good and sweet
to know that they and the rest of them had struck such a blow for the flag, to
know that their work would be talked about in England, and that their names
would not be forgotten by grateful countrymen. They had to die, but there was
no reason why the end should come before they had given the enemy a further
taste of their quality.</p>
<p>There was no one to lead them either. The colonel had other work to do, and
already he was making his way cautiously towards the second line of trenches.
They had to rely now on Venables' memory of the ground they had to cover, and
on the little handful of men whom it would be Kemp's duty to select. As senior
to Bentley, he was now in command of the hundred men, all that were left of
that gallant company.</p>
<p>"Well, thank the Lord I'm goin' ter be one of 'em," Ginger struck in. "You
might leave it ter me, sir, ter select the men. I knows 'em better'n you. An'
they'll do exactly wot' I tells 'em. I wouldn't be out o' this for anything.
And if we do come through all right, an' something tells me as we
will&mdash;"</p>
<h2><a id="chap13" name="chap13">XIII - AFTER THE GUNS</a></h2>
<p class="first">It was an hour later that the little knot of men following
Kemp and Bentley and Ginger, mightily conscious of his fresh importance,
climbed noiselessly out of the trench and plunged into a field of beetroot
where there was ample cover. It was not very dark, and when their eyes became
accustomed to the gloom they could make out, beyond the field, a long upward
sweep of stubble fringed away to the right by a big wood. A spur of this ran
down the hillside, and it was here, so far as Kemp could make out, that the
guns lay. In the deceptive light the spot did not seem very far away, though,
according to what Venables said, it must have been a good two miles. Below the
wood was a tangle of bracken, and it was here that the convoy bringing up
ammunition to the Musketeers' trenches had been literally blown into fragments
by the German gun-fire. Apparently the enemy had made no further attempt to
possess themselves of the damaged wagon, probably being confident that the
matter could wait, and that before morning there would not be a single English
soldier within miles of the place.</p>
<p>"It's a good thing they don't know," Kemp muttered. "If they found out that
our chaps yonder had run out of cartridges there wouldn't be one left in ten
minutes. However, they don't know, and that's in our favour. Venables, do you
mean to tell me that that hill is two miles away?"</p>
<p>Venables was absolutely sure of it. He pointed out that this was not his
first campaign by a good many, and that he himself had served in the American
army. It was he who had thrown out the suggestion that it would be just as well
to have amongst the forlorn hope one man at any rate who could speak German
fluently. Amongst a regiment of men largely recruited from London business men
this was no difficult matter. He would probably come in useful later on.</p>
<p>For a time they crawled along on hands and knees, without a solitary word
spoken. It was hot and weary work, especially to men who had hardly known what
it was to close their eyes for three successive days and nights. It was still
more dangerous work when they reached the open ground, for it was impossible to
know where the German sentries were posted, and any moment might sound the note
of alarm. It was only by spreading out on both sides and keeping along in the
shelter of hedge and ditch that the lower spur of the wood was reached at
length. Then Kemp suddenly drew back and held up his hand.</p>
<p>On the very edge of the wood two grey figures squatted in the bracken, rifle
in hand, keen and alert, and obviously ready to sound the alarm at the first
sign of the foe. It was an awkward moment, because it was impossible to proceed
any farther before these men were disposed of. No doubt the sound of a shot
could bring hordes of the enemy charging through the wood. For a few minutes
Bentley and Kemp discussed the situation in whispers. What was to be done?</p>
<p>"It seems to me," Kemp said, "that this is where our friend who speaks
German comes in. Hi, Malden. Here. I want you to crawl up to that hedge and
fall over the other side. That will attract the attention of those chaps, and
before they can put a bullet into you, you must groan for help in their own
lingo. You had better be a German spy in khaki who has been wounded. Tie his
head up with a handkerchief, Harold, and rub the handkerchief first on Ginger's
coat sleeve. There's blood on it. Then you'll have to leave the rest to
us."</p>
<p>The man called Malden grinned cheerfully. Three months before he had been a
good-natured, rather obese, city solicitor, with a timid manner and a desire to
live at peace with his neighbours. Now he was hard and lean, and only too eager
to see the Germans writhing at his feet.</p>
<p>"That'll be all right, old man, at least I mean, sir," he said. "I used to
be rather good at private theatricals. But I don't quite get the hang of it
yet. How are you going to keep 'em quiet? Not that I am thinking about
myself."</p>
<p>Kemp smiled encouragingly, for he was beginning to see his way. It was
pretty evident, too, that these were the only two Germans in the spur of the
wood, and that they had been placed there more as a matter of routine than
anything else. But, all the same, they would have to be silenced; it was
imperative that not a sound should escape them.</p>
<p>"Now, you go on," Kemp said, "and creep up as far as the fence. Hang there
till you see one stand up, and then hoist your signals of distress. Ginger, you
take three men and place yourselves two on each side of Malden, one each with a
clip in his rifle, and the other two with fixed bayonets. As soon as those
swine hang over the hedge, clap a rifle to the head of either of 'em, and
whilst they are more or less paralysed let the other two men give 'em the
bayonet without the slightest hesitation. It is not a pretty thing to do, but,
considering that the lives of about 500 of us are at stake, don't have the
least hesitation. Besides, you are not dealing with men, nothing more than
brutes and savages."</p>
<p>All this in a hurried whisper, repeated again and again so that there should
not be a misunderstanding when the critical moment arrived. Inch by inch,
slowly and coolly as if he had been performing some exercise in his own
suburban garden, Malden crept in, grinning to himself as he thought of the
artistic bandage, grimy and bloodstained, that was tied about his forehead.
There was not an atom of fear in the heart of the man who would have told
anyone three months ago that he was the last man in the world to be trusted
with a weapon. But he was hard and stern enough now, when he realised the
responsibility before which not so long ago he would have faltered and
trembled&mdash;the lives perhaps of 500 men, many of them friends of his,
rested on his coolness and courage. On and on he went, this respectable British
citizen, until at length he gained the fence and lifted his head over it. He
gave one glance to assure himself that all was well on either side of him, and
grinned as he saw the gleam of two rifle barrels and the glitter of a pair of
bayonets.</p>
<p>He could hear the Germans muttering and groaning together. Apparently they
felt perfectly secure of their position, for they made no effort to modulate
their voices, and Malden could hear every word they said. Then he turned his
head and saw that Kemp had risen to his feet. He lifted himself on the top of
the hedge, and then appeared to collapse there with a moan of pain and a
heartbreaking groan.</p>
<p>"I shall never do it," he said in German. "Also I shall never get there.
Help! Help! I am&mdash;"</p>
<p>He broke off suddenly with a feeling that his little ruse had been quite
successful. He heard the Germans jump to their feet as they made a rush towards
him. Through his half-closed eyes he could see two swarthy faces bent over him,
and two pairs of hands tugging at his limp body. Then one or two broken words
came from his lips, words of explanation, as if he were more or less delirious,
before he dropped like an empty sack.</p>
<p>He heard two hoarse exclamations, and as he struggled to his feet he saw the
Germans standing there with the muzzle of a rifle pressed to the head of
either. And after that two other forms came into the picture; there was a faint
streak of light glancing upwards out of the ditch, and the sudden clash of two
heavy bodies in the brushwood. The sentries had fallen, stabbed through the
heart, and had collapsed with no more than a sigh.</p>
<p>"By Gad, you did that well, Malden," Kemp said. "And now, with any luck, we
shall get hold of those guns."</p>
<h2><a id="chap14" name="chap14">XIV - BY TELEPHONE</a></h2>
<p class="first">Malden sat up suddenly and laughed. It was by no means a
pleasant laugh, and Venables gripped him firmly by the arm.</p>
<p>"Here, none of that," he said. "You just keep yourself in hand. I know
what's the matter with you."</p>
<p>Malden proceeded to check himself with an effort. There was a sort of
speculation in his eye as he contemplated the grey corpses lying at his
feet.</p>
<p>"I couldn't help it," he said. "Upon my word, I couldn't. It struck me all
at once as being so funny. Ghastly and horrible, I admit, but funny all the
same. Why, in the ordinary course of things I should be at home getting up my
bulbs. I'm rather fond of reading sensational literature, but I never pictured
myself doing this sort of thing. Oh, it's all right; all I want is a mouthful
of food."</p>
<p>"Well, take a cigarette instead," Venables suggested. "I have seen these
things before. I was all through the Balkan business, you know. Funny how
hysteria grips men sometimes. But when it does get hold of them they fight like
blazes."</p>
<p>But Malden was quiet enough now. The desire to laugh had left him; he was no
longer a respectable business man, but a soldier with stern work in front of
him. So far as they could make out, the spur of the wood was free of the enemy,
and it was safe enough to move on in the direction of the guns. The main idea
was to recover the lost ammunition for the men in the trenches, and then to
render the 4.7's useless for future work. This would entail something more than
the removal of breech blocks, and the scheme generally was to blow them up;
not, however, until the ammunition had been saved, and even then by a time fuse
which would enable Kemp and the rest of them to get back to their line before
the foe had realised what was talking place.</p>
<p>All the same it was necessary to push on slowly and cautiously through the
wood. It was Venables who impressed this firmly on his companions.</p>
<p>"Don't be too sure," he said. "You fellows haven't half grasped how thorough
these Germans are. I dare say you will be astonished to hear that there are at
least two underground telephone wires between the rear of your lines and the
German front. This is just the sort of place where a telephone operator could
lie snug for days. All he has got to do is to lie in a hole in the ground with
some food, and he's just as safe as if he were in his own camp. You had better
go forward as if every inch of ground contained a German. And if you do get
into trouble, then I am your prisoner."</p>
<p>"You are taking no risks?" Kemp murmured.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess you've got to trust me," the American said. "I can't tell you
everything, but I am no enemy of yours and don't you forget it. We're wasting
time."</p>
<p>Without another word the American crept forward, followed by the rest,
spread out wide enough to cover the whole of the wood. It was nervous work,
pushing along there in the darkness far away from the English lines, with just
enough light to distinguish the trunks of the trees. From somewhere in the
distance came the boom of the heavy guns, and ever and again a flare high up in
the black clouds picked out the wood clear cut as a cameo and made everything
as light as a vivid flash of lightning would have done. And presently in one of
these luminous intervals Bentley caught sight of something that caused him to
gasp and grip Kemp by the arm.</p>
<p>"I believe we've done it," he whispered. "You keep your eyes wide open for
the next flash. Up there to the left behind that big clump of trees. I could
have sworn that I saw the gleam on the muzzle of a gun."</p>
<p>Bentley was right. A searchlight playing wide in the sky dropped its beams
on the wood, picking it out half vividly much as if the moon was shining behind
the clouds. The gleaming patch indicated by Bentley might have been half a mile
away, but unquestionably what he saw were guns.</p>
<p>"Good for you," Kemp said. "The fun is about to begin. Well, as this is
likely to be our last adventure, we will make the best of it. Half a minute.
What's the matter with Venables? Isn't he signalling?"</p>
<p>The American, a little way in front, had risen as far as his knees, and with
his upraised hands was waving the rest of the company back. They dropped in the
undergrowth and lay close like partridges when there is a hawk overhead. A
second or two later Venables was back amongst them.</p>
<p>"What did I tell you?" he asked. "I've had the narrowest escape of tumbling
into a hole where a German is working his end of the field telephone. I should
say he's got two instruments in there and is transferring messages. It's the
neatest little dug-out you ever saw, covered all over with bushes, and it would
puzzle a fox to find. I should have blundered right into the chap myself if I
hadn't heard him speak. Then he was kind enough to strike a match to light his
cigarette, and I had a full view of the desirable family mansion."</p>
<p>"Did you learn anything?" Kemp asked.</p>
<p>"Well," Venables said drily, "vulgar curiosity isn't quite the suit I'm
playing just now. And I don't want to find myself an object of suspicion to the
Germans. Now, what I suggest is that I show our friend Malden where the
scientist is playing his little game and that he listens to what's going on.
It's just possible that he will pick up a little information likely to be
useful."</p>
<p>There was nothing wrong with the suggestion, and Kemp decided to avail
himself of it. A moment later Malden was listening eagerly to a conversation
that palpably was being transmitted from some other hiding place behind the
English lines to a point somewhere near the German headquarters.</p>
<p>"Yes, I got that," came the hoarse whisper from underground. "Better repeat
it again so that I shall make no mistake. So. How far do you say?"</p>
<p>Then followed a silence and a broken word or two from the signaller that
Malden failed to understand. But gradually as he lay there he began to fit the
pieces of the puzzle together, no very difficult matter to one who is really
familiar with the use of the telephone. And as Malden lay there he gasped and
thrilled with the joy of discovery. For even he, with his limited knowledge of
the wily foe, was beginning to understand that he was picking up some priceless
information. Then it became plain that the man down there in the dug-out had
finished for the moment, for he replaced his receiver and proceeded to relight
his pipe. Malden crept back to the others excitedly.</p>
<p>"Have you done any good?" Kemp asked.</p>
<p>"I rather think I have." Malden exclaimed. "I have just discovered that
there is a strong picket of Uhlans out there at the back of the wood. I should
think they are about as many as we are. They are in command of lieutenant
somebody, and their game is to push forward at daybreak to see if we are still
holding that village with the unpronounceable name."</p>
<p>"Ah," Kemp cried. "I begin to see what you are driving at. Well, we don't
hold that bridge, and directly those chaps find that out we are absolutely
done. So are the Royals for the matter of that. By jove, I've a good mind to
try it! We can't be worse off than we are at present. Now, if we can surprise
those chaps, we get hold of a score of good horses; and with those in our hands
we can haul the guns and ammunition back to the trenches. Do you see what I
mean? Now, supposing that we got hold of that Johnny in the dug-out and put
Malden in his place. What do you think of that?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap15" name="chap15">XV - SAVED!</a></h2>
<p class="first">Malden demurred strongly. His German accent was good enough,
but the whole plan might be ruined if some question were put to him that he was
not in a position to answer promptly. It would be far better to leave the
German signaller in blissful ignorance of the fact that he had been discovered,
and push on at once, with a view to taking the Uhlans by surprise, especially
as they were an isolated body and beyond the reach of help.</p>
<p>"Besides, I haven't finished," he said. "Those chaps know all about the
guns, and they haven't worried about them because they regard them as their own
absolute property. They have got the guns and the ammunition, and, what is more
to the point, they are holding more than a score of our gunners too. Of course,
it isn't for me to argue with you, but it seems a pity to risk the success of a
coup like this for the possibility of picking up a bit more information. Still,
it isn't for me to say."</p>
<p>There was a good deal of force in this suggestion, and Kemp acknowledged it
without hesitation. They were at least as strong as the Uhlans, they were well
armed and desperate, and the German horsemen would be taken by surprise. It
would be a grand thing, too, if they could recover the guns and the gunners and
get back to their trenches with the ammunition that they so sorely needed. And
it was no time to wait, no time to think of discipline or what might be the
effect of not lingering for orders. For they knew only too well that the
overwhelming pressure of Germany's might was gradually forcing them back, and
that the allies, for the time being, at least, were in full retreat. They knew
only too well, too, that every hour gained, and every tiny check, however
small, was so much gained for England and France. The time had come when they
might be forced back, such of them as were left, under the guns of the Paris
forts, but the thought did not dismay them, and now all the world knows that
the disastrous retreat was in reality the beginning of a series of glorious
victories that covered the old flag with new laurels. They knew also that every
man there was ready to do his duty and ready to die in the defence of his
country and the honour of a great people.</p>
<p>It was only in the last few days that these facts were being steadily borne
in upon them, but the knowledge of them strung them up to fresh endeavour.
Therefore to regain these guns now, and to hold those trenches for another day,
might mean more than any of them dreamt. And, while nothing of this was said,
it was in the back of the mind of every man there.</p>
<p>"We'll do it!" Kemp said. "Honestly, I believe we can do it. If we can catch
those fellows napping, as we probably shall, we'll give the people of England
something to talk about. Perhaps they will never know, but still we shall. Now,
come on, lads; let's strike another blow for the glory of the good old
Musketeers. Forward, my boys, forward!"</p>
<p>Here was something to be done: here was something to wipe out the bitterness
of the last few days. They pushed forward, a strangely mixed crowd, drawn from
the cricket field and the city and the slums, yet all bent on doing something
to show the earnestness that was in them. Inch by inch they passed through the
wood and thence to the open ground on the far side, where they could see a camp
fire. The ground was unprotected in front, but on three sides of it barbed wire
fences had been erected, and on the far side of this the horses were picketed.
It was an ideal situation from the attackers' point of view, and Kemp and the
others smiled grimly as they saw how the enemy had betrayed itself into their
hands. It needed no more than a quick, irresistible dash and a volley or two,
and the whole thing would be over.</p>
<p>"Let's be out and at 'em!" Bentley whispered.</p>
<p>"Steady on, steady on!" Kemp said. "Pity to run the risk of spoiling
everything by undue haste. There's plenty of cover, and those chaps sitting
round the fire will never spot us, for they couldn't possibly see as long as
their blaze is going on. Now, get right up within five yards of them, and don't
fire a single shot till I give you the word. Now then; forward, forward!"</p>
<p>It was a tense moment, and every man held his breath until in the silence he
could hear the blood rushing through his head, could hear the tick of the watch
on the wrist of the man next to him. They could catch the flickering sob of the
camp fire now, and hear the Germans talking. A tall officer in his smart
uniform approached the fire and took out a burning twig to light his cigar. It
would have been an easy matter to pick him off, for he was a fine mark against
the flare, and Ginger's fingers itched on his trigger as he half rose.</p>
<p>"Now, drop that," Bentley said sharply. "I understand your feelings, Ginger,
but it can't be done."</p>
<p>"Wery sad," Ginger said resignedly. "This 'ere's one o' the drawbacks o'
war. It's full o' disappointment. But there's another thing. If you cast yer
eye over to the right yonder you'll see some chaps lyin' dahn there so wery
close together as ter suggest the idea as wot they was affectionate twins. But
if you arsk me, I'm bettin' as they're our own chaps, prisoners, an' if I'm not
mistaken they're roped up together like convicts. It's a quid to a tanner as
they're our gunners."</p>
<p>Ginger appeared to be right. Fortunately the same idea had occurred to Kemp
at the same moment. He was glad now that he had not yielded to his first
impulse and attacked the foe at 200 yards distance. If he had done so, the
little knot of British prisoners would have suffered in their turn. But that
danger had been fortunately averted, and the only thing to be afraid of now was
the possibility of the rifle fire stampeding the horses. Still, there was
barbed wire behind them, and they could only break away in the direction of the
attacking force. Nearer and nearer Kemp and his little force crept, and as yet
the Uhlans were absolutely ignorant of the coming danger. It was almost
impossible to hold back any longer, and Kemp rose to his feet and gave the
order to fire. It was as if so many lead soldiers had suddenly been swept away
by the hand of a child who had tired of his martial game. The Uhlans went down
around the camp fire, they rolled over sideways, until, in less time than it
takes to tell, they were wiped out.</p>
<p>"Cease firing!" Kemp screamed. "Not another shot. Look to the horses: they
are worth their weight in gold."</p>
<p>Just for a second it looked as if the horses would break from their pickets
and tear themselves in their terror against the barbed wire. Then out of the
attacking force one man darted forward and flung himself into the midst of the
whinnying, lathering steeds. The touch of his hand and the sound of his voice
seemed to soothe them as if he spoke a language they understood.</p>
<p>"That's the beauty o' 'avin' a bit of all sorts," Ginger cried. "'E's a
'orsedealer's runner, that bloke is. 'Ot stuff where the 'iar trunks is
concerned. But, Lor' bless yer, they knows 'im as well as if 'e'd bin wif 'em
all 'is life. It takes a lot o' queer things ter make the British army."</p>
<p>Ginger spoke truly enough, for the big Flemish horses were no longer
fretting at their pickets. Then from behind them came a frantic British cheer,
and a score or more of figures in khaki struggled to their feet. They were
roped together, with wrists and ankles firmly bound; they were exhausted and
starving; but the bright light of courage was in their eyes as they held out
their hands to their rescuers.</p>
<p>"What about the guns?" one of them cried. "Don't tell us they've been done
in!"</p>
<p>"Oh, the guns are all right," Kemp said cheerfully. "The question is, can we
put our hands on the shells?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap16" name="chap16">XVI - THE LONELY FARM</a></h2>
<p class="first">The fine rapture of the moment was not dimmed by any thought
of the peril that might&mdash;nay, would&mdash;follow on the morrow. It was
enough to that little knot of Englishmen to know that they had set out on a
breathless, desperate enterprise, and that the wild adventure had been crowned
with success. And yet there was not one of them blind to the fact that it could
only be for the time being. They knew that they had been overwhelmed by the
great flood of the German invasion, and that the waters of that mighty river
had swept by them on either side. There might be a possible chance to squeeze
back, but every hour rendered retreat more and more difficult. Still, they were
doing fine work, as their fathers had done on many a stricken field before
them, and every moment gained was so much to their credit.</p>
<p>But they were not thinking of that, nor caring for the future. They cut the
bonds of the gunners, who literally fell upon their necks and blessed them. A
big sergeant sat on the grass and rubbed his swollen ankles vindictively.</p>
<p>"Oh, so you're some of the Musketeers?" he asked. "Where are we? We seem to
have been on the run now for the last two days. And, if you ask me, we are all
that's left of six batteries. I suppose they've got out guns all right? But
where's your officer?"</p>
<p>"You can call me that," Kemp said. "We haven't got one left. A company of
the Musketeers are back in a trench yonder, and about half the battalion is
trying to cut its way through to the south. You needn't worry about your guns.
They're not 200 yards away, at the bottom of the wood. Do you happen to know
where your ammunition is? Because, if you do, we can give those fellows
something to go on with tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Good iron!" the sergeant cried. "We were wondering where those guns had got
to. Suppose they felt so sure of them that they left them in the wood. Well, we
worked those guns all through the night and most of the morning till they were
red hot. We worked 'em till we were the only battery left; then they came round
from the left and cut us off altogether. It was no use going on. Some of our
chaps fairly wept but what could we do? Then they took us prisoners and tied us
up as you saw. They walked off with our ammunition wagons, and I believe they
are somewhere on a farm over yonder. But we've got a man here who can tell us
all about that. What's become of Uncle?"</p>
<p>A driver lying on the ground, pulling luxuriously at one of Venables'
cigarettes, laughed aloud.</p>
<p>"I think he's in the ditch still," he said. "It's the farmer himself, sir.
They tied the old chap up and dumped him down with us, and he's been doing
nothing but swear ever since. Plucky old man, too. He knows they are going to
try him to-morrow and shoot him for a spy, whether he's guilty or not. Here,
I'll go and fetch him."</p>
<p>The driver came back a moment or two later with an old man, white-bearded
and venerable, and clad in the blue blouse and baggy trousers of a working
farmer. The sullen frown left his face, and he beamed as he caught sight of
familiar khaki. He seemed to know instinctively that Kemp was the leader of the
party, for he hastened to embrace him with forceful gratitude.</p>
<p>"Ah, the brave English," he said. "I speak some of your language. Years ago
I stay with a countryman of mine in England. And now you come to set us free.
Eh, the Germans? They come down on my farm; they steal everything, and
ill-treat my wife and my daughter and her children; also they beat my old men
on the farm, but they do not beat the young ones, because already they 'ave
gone to fight. And then they beat me because I could not give them wine and
chickens and veal. They say if I don't they shoot me. Then, because I go to a
neighbour to help me and come back with what they need, they accuse me of being
a spy, and they shoot me in the morning. Perhaps not."</p>
<p>"Not if we can help it," Kemp smiled. "Now, listen to me, Monsieur Jean, or
whatever your name is."</p>
<p>"Jean is quite right, my captain," the Frenchman said.</p>
<p>"All right. We came here to recover our guns. And we have done that pretty
effectually, as you can see for yourself."</p>
<p>"Ah, it was a fine sight, monsieur. It is only a pity that there were not a
thousand of them, the pigs."</p>
<p>"Never mind about that for the moment, though we have every sympathy with
your indignation. We're got the guns, but the sergeant here is of opinion that
the ammunition wagons are up at your farm. It's long odds our cartridges are
there, too. Now, do you think this is correct?"</p>
<p>"But indeed yes, my captain," the Frenchman said. "There are four ammunition
wagons in one of my barns and they are all English. But in my farm are a number
of German officers and their servants. They are boastful Uhlans. And at 10
o'clock to-night they sit down in my house, and they eat chicken and duck and
veal, and they drink wine and swear at my family and my servants if they not
get waited upon. Eh, what a joy if you brave English could come in just as they
sit down and feed those pigs with lead and steel instead. It would be one great
surprise. And my old men would bury them cheerfully."</p>
<p>Kemp nodded thoughtfully. A somewhat similar idea was beginning to simmer in
his mind. If Uhlans were at the farm, it might be possible to surprise them and
wipe them out altogether. This would mean the capture of still more horses,
which later on might come in useful in a moment of retreat. There was another
part of the scheme that need not be mentioned yet.</p>
<p>"What do you say?" Kemp said, turning to Bentley. "The odds are in our
favour, and I daresay these chaps here have got a score they want to wipe out.
Well, boys?"</p>
<p>Ginger licked his lips joyfully.</p>
<p>"There ain't no cause to arsk the question, sir," he said. "As for me, the
mere thought o' wot ole 'Frenchy says about the wittles would buck me up ter
fight the 'ole bloomin' German harmy. I feel as if I ain't 'ad a mawthful o'
food since mother died. All right, sir, I'll dry up."</p>
<p>A few moments later the little band of adventurers were creeping along in
the direction of the farm. Monsieur Jean stepped out sturdily in front of them
until they passed over the brow of a little hill into a hollow below, where a
low white house with lights gleaming in the windows loomed through the
darkness. So far as Kemp could make out, no sentries had been posted, and
doubtless the few men in attendance on the Uhlan officers were busily engaged
inside waiting on their superiors. It was quite evident that the Germans were
under the impression that none of the foe lurked within miles, for they had
given themselves over to the enjoyment of the moment, as bursts of laughter and
fragments of song from the interior of the house testified. The door was open,
and inside, by the light of a lamp, Kemp could see the figure of an aged woman,
who appeared to be utterly overcome with grief.</p>
<p>"My wife," the farmer explained in a whisper. "Doubtless she thinks I am
dead. Those ruffians would probably tell her so. If I can engage her
attention&mdash;"</p>
<p>Jean crept forward and whistled gently. The woman looked up and held out her
hands. If she spoke now, all Kemp's plans might be blown to the winds. But
fortunately she hastened out into the darkness, and before she could cry out
the old man's hand was upon her lips, and he was whispering in her ear.</p>
<p>"We must get the others out of the house," he said. "Pretend that you want
everybody in the kitchen for a moment. And then these brave men will do the
rest. You understand?"</p>
<p>The old woman nodded, and a minute or two later came into the doorway and
waved her hand.</p>
<p>"Come on," Kemp said. "Come on. At all events, we shall sup in luxury
tonight."</p>
<h2><a id="chap17" name="chap17">XVII - BACK WITH THE GUNS</a></h2>
<p class="first">Twice did Kemp and Bentley walk round the house, keeping an
alert look-out for possible sentries, but nothing of the kind could be seen. By
this time the Germans, waited upon by a handful of their men, had made a start
on their supper. They appeared to be in the best of spirits; perhaps they had
indulged somewhat freely in the old farmer's wine before they sat down to
table. They shouted to one another in boastful toasts and sang snatches of
their arrogant patriotic songs. It sounded as if each had some ignoble exploit
to speak of, but the din was comprehensible only to Malden, who smiled grimly
as he listened. By this time the house was full of Musketeers. They poured in
by the front door and the back, and Kemp and Bentley looking through the open
door of the dining-room could see the lamplight glistening on brilliant
uniforms, on gold lace and stars and decorations. There was another door at the
far end of the room leading into the kitchen, where other Musketeers had been
stationed.</p>
<p>A Uhlan officer, evidently of high rank, stood up at the end of the table
with his glass in his hand and proposed a toast. He said something about
England, and then, in good enough English, drank to the speedy destruction of
French and his contemptible little army. There was a swaggering boast on his
lips as Kemp stepped into the room and coolly surveyed the brilliant
company.</p>
<p>"You can have your wish, sir," he said. "But, on the whole, you had best
take it quietly."</p>
<p>The big officer dropped his glass and stared at Kemp in amazement. Then a
revolver shot rang out and a bullet grazed Bentley as it buried itself in the
wall. The Musketeers waited for no other signal. From both doors they burst
into the room, firing as they came. It was all the work of a moment; there was
no quarter given or asked, and presently when the smoke cleared away the
Germans lay on the sanded floor beyond all power of further mischief. It was a
sufficiently ghastly bit of business. But the Germans had done their best with
their revolvers, and two or three of the Musketeers lay beyond the reach of
mortal aid. But this was war, ghastly and grim, and there was no more to be
done beyond removing the bodies of the dead Germans and throwing them hastily
in a shallow grave.</p>
<p>"Stop," Kemp cried. "Strip them of their uniforms, get every uniform you
can. I am not quite sure as yet, but we may want them presently. Where is
Venables?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Bentley said. "I expect he remained discreetly outside. This
is hardly a job for an American journalist who is supposed to be with the
German forces."</p>
<p>Kemp nodded approvingly. In the excitement of the moment he had forgotten
the point. And there were many more important things to think of. The dead had
to be buried first, and it was necessary to ascertain that the ammunition
wagons were intact. At the end of half an hour all traces of the fray had been
removed, and it had been established beyond doubt that the ammunition wagons
contained not only shells for the guns but many cases of cartridges for the use
of the Musketeers who still remained in the trenches. There were quite a number
of horses, too, which Kemp had an idea he could use later on.</p>
<p>"And now," he said, "as there is no hurry, there is no reason why we
shouldn't sit down and enjoy a good meal. More likely than not, it is the last
we shall ever eat."</p>
<p>"The sort of feed they give a man the night before his execution," Malden
grinned. "I suppose in time, if we live long enough, we shall get used to this
sort of thing."</p>
<p>And indeed it did seem strange and weird that men who so short a time ago
had been engaged in pacific pursuits, men who shrank with horror from strife or
trouble or the suggestion of bloodshed, should be sitting laughing and joking
callously here where only a few moments before a hideous slaughter had taken
place, and where the soles of their boots where wet with the blood of the
fallen Germans. Yet so it was; war had hardened these men as it had annealed
the hearts of their fathers on the field of strife any time in the last eight
hundred years. And the fact that they were just a handful in the heart and
midst of a million foes, gave zest to the food that they placed in their mouths
and the wine with which they washed it down. They sat there laughing and joking
with the easy indifference to death and the half hysterical humour which to an
English soldier is as the tempering of his steel.</p>
<p>"What do you want those uniforms for?" Bentley asked.</p>
<p>"Well, I've got an idea," Kemp murmured. "We'll get back to our trenches
with our ammunition and hold on as grimly as we can till we are wiped out. This
will give the rest of our battalion a chance to cut its way through. Then
behind the trenches we could mask our recovered guns and give the Germans socks
as long as ammunition lasts. This little dodge will probably make them think we
are stronger than we really are, and it may keep them off for an hour or two
longer. Now, if we can manage to hide those horses till tomorrow night, our
company, or what's left of them, can get into those Uhlan uniforms and ride
south with the object of pushing the German lines. You see what I mean. At any
rate, it's a chance."</p>
<p>"It sounds like a forlorn hope," Bentley said.</p>
<p>"Of course it is. But there've been some pretty useful forlorn hopes
engineered during this campaign, and I've no doubt there will be a good many
more. It all depends upon how we carry it through. My idea is to put Malden
into the uniform of that big swell who was in command here tonight. Evidently
he was a man of considerable importance, but we'll find all that out presently
when I have got time to go through his pocket-book. Malden shall lead us, and,
as he speaks German so well, he ought to be able to carry us through. I know it
all sounds like a chapter from some story, but there'll be heaps of chapters
like that before this war is finished. Don't say anything more about it at
present, and pass my plate for another slice of that veal. I could do with
another glass of wine, too."</p>
<p>The meal was finished at length, and the ammunition wagons were drawn out
and the horses fixed up. In the doorway stood the farmer and his wife with
their grandchildren and servants calling down blessings on the head of the
British.</p>
<p>"But what are you going to do?" Kemp asked the farmer. "You mustn't stay
here, you know. You'll be shot if you do. You'll never be able to keep this
business quiet."</p>
<p>The old man smiled proudly and yet sadly.</p>
<p>"I could not leave the old home, my captain," he said. "I would as soon
those pigs took me and shot me. I have lived here for close on seventy years,
and this is the second time I have seen those cursed Germans with their heel on
the neck of France. Last time I was younger, and I had a rifle in my hands. But
behold I am not afraid. It is a clean piece of work you have made to-night, and
there is not one of the Bosches alive to tell the tale. And if you think that
my life is not safe in the hands of my wife and family, and these old servants
of mine who have been with me all my life, then you are mistaken. And some day
you push the Germans back and then you will return to find a welcome here. If
not, monsieur, then farewell, for in that case we shall both of us be
dead."</p>
<p>So far as he himself was concerned, Kemp thought grimly; the prophecy was
likely to be fulfilled. But the thought troubled him not at all. His one aim
was to be back in the trenches again with the guns safely masked behind. It was
far into the night before the task was accomplished, and then with eyes heavy
with sleep and limbs sore and weary, the men dropped exhausted in the mud. Then
Kemp sat up suddenly and turned to Bentley.</p>
<p>"By the way," he asked, "where is Venables?"</p>
<p>But Venables was nowhere to be found.</p>
<h2><a id="chap18" name="chap18">XVIII - WOMEN'S WORK</a></h2>
<p class="first">The nights were growing longer and colder, and the leaves were
falling from the trees, but so far nothing of a particularly cheerful nature
had come through from the front, where the French and the contemptible little
British army were struggling against odds far greater and more overwhelming
than anyone in England realised. It was little that was permitted to pass the
firing line in those early days, and the censorship of the Boer War was as
nothing to that which was now in force. Everybody knew, of course, that Germany
was ready at the very outset, but few people outside official circles properly
appreciated what that really meant.</p>
<p>Only a few weeks before, the mere suggestion of trouble with Germany was
scouted, except by a few who were looked upon as scaremongers and lunatics, for
they were as so many voices calling in the wilderness. It was almost impossible
to grasp that at this early stage of the proceedings Germany had poured over
two millions of the flower of her manhood into Belgium and France. There were
those, of course, who took a light-hearted view of the whole proceeding, and
confidently prophesied that Germany would be a beaten foe by Christmas at the
latest. These were soldiers on paper, armchair strategists who quoted
comfortable documents from amateur critics who had proved to their own
satisfaction over and over again that Germany could not last more than three
months after the British Navy had made her command of the seas secure.</p>
<p>Well, the British Navy was mistress of the seas; the German Fleet had been
driven in behind Heligoland, there probably to remain till the end of the war,
with the exception of a few armoured cruisers which had already begun to fall
victims to our fast armed cruisers; the waterways of the world were open to
every nation except Germany and Austria; and for all practical purposes the
world's commerce was proceeding as smoothly as usual. It is almost impossible
to realise that millions of people all over the world, nations remote from the
war, and not likely to be brought within its evil influence, were earning their
daily bread and prospering as usual entirely owing to the magnificent work that
Jellicoe and his men were doing.</p>
<p>But meanwhile, day by day, the allies were being steadily pushed back until
it began to look as if the siege of Paris was only a question of time. England
only heard occasionally of the great deeds which her heroes were doing; now and
again the veil was lifted, and some brilliant exploit was revealed to the
waiting country. One or two of the papers had commented amongst other things
upon the fine work accomplished by the Musketeers, and gradually it became
known that a part of the regiment had been cut off from the rest, without much
hope of retreat.</p>
<p>There were anxious hearts in the Keep House, where Netty Bentley and Dorothy
Kemp had settled down with Mrs. Bentley. One day passed after another without a
sign, and it seemed as if Kemp and Bentley and the rest of them must have gone
down before the rush of the German host. And then out of the darkness came a
letter. It was written in a strange hand on foreign paper, and bore a Norwegian
postmark. There was no beginning to it, and no end, the writer apparently being
anxious to remain anonymous. But it was a consoling letter on the whole, and
spoke of events which had happened up to the moment when Kemp and Bentley and
the rest of them had made their raid upon the French farmhouse and got safely
away to their own trenches with the guns. There was a promise to write further
a little later on with more information, and meantime it was a great relief to
find that when the letter had been despatched, only four days ago, all those in
whom Netty and Dorothy were interested were safe.</p>
<p>"I cannot tell you," the letter ran, "who I am and what means I have used to
communicate with you. But I want you to understand that every word is
substantially true, and that I myself was present during the attack on the
farmhouse, and that I saw the lost guns safely in the British trenches. I have
every reason to believe that the scheme planned by Mr. Ronald Kemp will prove
successful, and that with average luck the little company of Musketeers are by
this time once more in touch with the British rearguard. I cannot speak too
highly of the way in which the whole plan was carried out, and I speak with all
the more confidence because I was one of them myself and had the honour of
guiding the Musketeers to the spot where the guns and ammunition were
concealed. As soon as possible I will write you further, but I want you to bear
in mind that in communicating with you I am running a great deal of risk both
to myself and to those who employ me. I am not an Englishman nor a Frenchman,
nor am I a German who feels himself under an obligation to some of your
friends.</p>
<p>"And now, there is one thing I am going to ask you to do. Directly you have
read this letter and discussed it with Miss Bentley and her mother, I want you
to destroy it and forget that you ever received it. I want you to promise me
that you will not mention it to a single soul outside the Keep House. In
conclusion, I give you my word that I am telling you no more than the truth; in
fact, it would be impossible for anybody to read what I have written here and
disbelieve a single word of it."</p>
<p>It was a sunny afternoon in the peaceful garden of the Keep House when the
letter came and was read again and again round the tea-table. There was a good
deal of it elaborated with a wealth of detail and sundry personal touches which
served to bring out all the fine heroism of the work that Kemp and the rest of
them had done. There was a long silence after the letter was finished with, and
then Dorothy tore it into fragments, and put a match to it.</p>
<p>"It goes very much against the grain," she said. "I should like to have had
the letter framed. Never in my life have I been so tempted to break a promise.
But, whoever our good friend is, he must be obeyed."</p>
<p>"No question about that," Nettie said. "I wonder who he is? He can't be one
of the Musketeers, for it would have been impossible for them to get a letter
through. It is a great pity, too, that we cannot let the sender know how we
appreciate his kindness. In fact, we can do nothing. Why can't we do some
thing, Dorothy? I feel so horribly guilty going about my work by day, and
spending my evenings in this beautiful old house, whilst all the time I feel
that we ought to be doing something. What can we do?"</p>
<p>Dorothy turned a face that was somewhat restless and discontented towards
the lawns and the flower beds, where the autumn flowers were blazing in the
sunshine; the old house seemed to sleep peacefully, as if there was no such
thing as war and suffering in the world.</p>
<p>"It is horrible!" she said. "Don't tell me that the women of England can do
nothing except sit down day after day with a ball of wool and a couple of
knitting needles in their hands. Of course, it's a good thing for us to make
all these comforts for our men, but at the same time we must be taking the
bread out of the mouths of the working women. And I for one am not going to sit
down idly any longer."</p>
<h2><a id="chap19" name="chap19">XIX&mdash;SOMETHING ATTEMPTED</a></h2>
<p class="first">Dorothy rose to her feet, and walked up and down the lawn
restlessly. Her eyes were shining with resolution.</p>
<p>"I am glad you mentioned it," she said, "because this idleness has been on
my mind for some time. I am not one of those who believe that this war will
soon be finished. I have been studying the papers, and it seems to me that we
have not begun yet. What about the time when we have a couple of million men in
the field? Who is going to look after the wounded? We are a most extraordinary
nation; we never seem to anticipate anything. We muddle on, and muddle on, and
when the big trouble comes we hold up our hands and say, 'Who would have
thought it!' For the time being, at any rate, we have done quite enough in the
way of extra comforts for the boys at the front. It's a job that wants to be
properly organised and placed in the hands of women whose husbands are at the
front, and of their children who are suffering from want of work. Don't tell me
that hundreds of thousands of educated girls like ourselves have got to sit
quietly down with their hands folded, whilst their brothers and sweethearts are
dying for their country. Take my case, for instance. I have attended hundreds
of ambulance classes, and I have all sorts of certificates, and yet so far I
have apparently wasted my time. I am quite competent to undertake nursing work,
and so are you. Before long, when the big fight begins in earnest, the wounded
will be coming over here in streams, and so far there is little accommodation
for them. Now, what I propose to do is this. I have thought the matter out
carefully, and I believe we could accommodate about a hundred wounded here. Of
course we cannot undertake very serious cases, but we could cope with those who
want careful looking after. I believe we could manage with a dozen nurses, and
I can easily raise those amongst my own friends. In fact, I have the volunteers
already. Then there are two friends of ours, doctors who have retired from
practice, but are both active and willing, and they would form our medical
staff. Of course I should have to engage a matron, but that is merely a matter
of money. Then in the big room down by the lake, which used to be a studio, I
mean to establish a creche for children whose mothers are at work all day. This
would find us plenty to do, and we should feel that we were really of some
service to the state."</p>
<p>"It would cost a lot of money," Nettie said.</p>
<p>"It will cost five or six thousand pounds," Dorothy replied, "and quite as
much to keep it up every year. But I think that can be managed. You see, I have
money of my own, and before Ronald went away he made arrangements with his
bankers by which I can draw on his account; in fact, he turned over his income
to me, and, as you know, he is quite well off. I am perfectly sure that he
would agree if he heard what I am saying now. Anyway, I am going to risk it. We
will go up to London in the morning and call at the bank and put that right.
Then we will find out the proper way to go to work and get one of my doctor
friends here to plan out the house and give the necessary orders for the beds
and all that sort of thing. Of course, we shall be amateurs to begin with, but
I have do doubt we shall get into it in time. What do you think of the
idea?"</p>
<p>"I think it's perfectly splendid!" Nettie cried. "You don't know how I have
longed to do something really big. All this knitting business strikes me as
being so futile."</p>
<p>For a long time they discussed the details eagerly, and by the morning most
of the provisional arrangements were made. The Keep House was an ideal one for
the purpose, as it stood in large grounds remote from the road and was very
quiet. There was no difficulty about the money, either; there were ample funds
for the purchase of the necessary outfit, and it was a pleasure and a joy to
the two girls to carry out all their arrangements. They were fortunate in
finding an old acquaintance of Kemp's in the War Office, for he took them by
the hand, and put them in the right way of getting everything they required. It
was he who obtained the sanction of the War Office to the scheme without which
it would have fallen to the ground; he introduced to them a sympathetic member
of the Medical Staff, who escorted them from place to place, and gave them the
benefit of an invaluable experience gained during the Boer War; and he found
the matron, a capable woman, the widow of a doctor, who had lost everything
when hostilities broke out, and who was anxious not only to get her own living
but to place her knowledge at the disposal of those who required it.</p>
<p>So gradually most of the rooms in the Keep House were stripped of their
beautiful furniture, only a few apartments being reserved for the staff, and at
the end of three weeks a hundred beds were established, and everything down to
the last detail, was ready for the wounded.</p>
<p>It was with an air of pride and satisfaction that the girls surveyed their
arrangements. They were all friends together, for every one of the nurses was
personally known to the two girls; for the most part they were old friends of
Dorothy's, girls who a few weeks before were thinking of nothing but tennis and
golf and the prospects of summer holidays. But all that was altered now. The
tennis racquets and the golf clubs had been laid aside and forgotten; the girls
were as bright and cheerful as they had ever been; but the lightness and
frivolity were gone, and a certain earnestness of purpose had taken their
place, and there was not one of them who was not anxious to do her best.</p>
<p>"All we want now are patients," Dorothy said, as she surveyed the rows of
neat beds in the cool wards. "But I suppose we shall have to wait for them. By
the way, I suppose we are not going to make any distinctions? Some people I
know who have a big place a mile or so down along the road are taking officers
only, but I don't like the idea myself."</p>
<p>"I quite agree with you," Nettie said. "It seems to me that this war ought
to destroy all social distinctions for the moment, for every man is doing his
best for the country, and the country comes first of all. If you like, we might
make the dining-room into an officers' ward, but really it does not in the
least matter. I was talking to one of the doctors this morning, and he tells me
that we may expect patients here at any time now. According to this morning's
paper there has been a big battle somewhere not far from St. Quentin, and one
or two of our regiments have been badly cut up. Amongst them, I see, were the
Musketeers, who were saved at the time when our two boys were holding up the
Germans in the trenches. I do hope, Dorothy, that we get some of them here. It
would be a splendid thing to nurse men of Harold and Ronald's regiment."</p>
<p>"I have thought of that," Dorothy said. "One of the doctors is going to
London this morning, and he might try to get some Musketeers sent here."</p>
<p>Two or three days later a telegram came from the War Office with an
intimation that between 30 and 40 wounded men were on their way to the Keep
House Hospital. Later on in the afternoon they began to arrive, pretty bad
cases most of them, but none of them requiring surgical assistance. For the
most part they could manage to get out of the motor ambulance, but there was
one of them who had to be lifted into the ward, a cheerful little man with
fiery-red hair who apologised profusely for the trouble he was causing.</p>
<p>"Do you know the name of that man?" Nettie asked a patient with his head
bound up and his arm in a sling.</p>
<p>"'Course I do, miss," he said. "That's one o' our 'eroes. P'raps you might
'a' 'eard o' Ginger Smiff?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap20" name="chap20">XX - IN CLOVER</a></h2>
<p class="first">Ginger lay at full length in his bed gazing dreamily at the
ceiling and trying to reconstruct his shattered universe and bring the world
into proper focus. He had not the least notion where he was, and there was
still enough of the casual left in him to render him utterly indifferent so far
as that was concerned. At any rate, he was alive, and that was something to go
on with. Jut for the moment when he was lifted out of the ambulance a whiff of
consciousness had come to him, and he had realised that he was amongst friends.
He had grasped the fact, too, that he was entirely out of his element, and that
he was in contact with a class of people who had hitherto been outside his
social outlook; hence his profuse apologies for the trouble he was causing.</p>
<p>He had been looking into a pair of friendly eyes, blue-grey eyes full of
sweetness and sympathy; he had been listening to a voice, very sympathetic; and
then gentle hands had lifted him from the Red Cross wagon, and he had been
placed in a cool white bed. Then a man was looking down at him, a keen-faced
man with a humorous smile and a pair of hands so gentle that Ginger could
scarcely feel them. Away somewhere in the distance a voice was speaking, and
Ginger rather gathered that he himself was the object of a discussion.</p>
<p>"I think he'll do now," the voice said. "The poor fellow has evidently been
in great pain; in fact, he is now, only he is too exhausted to show any
restlessness. What did you say? Yes, through the thigh and through the lungs.
But he is going on quite all right. I think I'll just give him a touch of
morphia to dull the pain, and then all he wants for some hours is complete
rest. After that, regular food and careful nursing will represent his cure. I
think that is all I can say for the present, Miss Kemp."</p>
<p>The name seemed to strike a familiar chord in Ginger's mind, and in his
dreamy mood he wondered where he had heard it before. He did not know that for
many hours now that he had been racked with pain, he did not even know whether
he was conscious or not, and his brain was asking him questions that he could
not answer. Then a hand touched his wrist. There was a prick, as if a needle
had stabbed him, and the pain vanished in some heavenly mysterious way that
left Ginger like a child who has fallen asleep in the shade on a summer
afternoon. He slipped into a kind of heaven, the semi-celestial paradise that
morphia brings, especially when it has been administered for the first time.
And after that Ginger slept contentedly and sweetly for many hours.</p>
<p>The light was beginning to fail as he came back to himself, still in the
same happy condition, so that he lay on his back gazing upwards, and gradually,
very gradually, he began to realise the fact that his name was Ginger Smiff,
and that he was a soldier of the King, who a week, or a month, back, or perhaps
even yesterday, was fighting for his country away in France with his friends
about him.</p>
<p>But where was he? And how had all this happened. His mind crept back inch by
inch until out of the mist the picture began to grow less muddy and indistinct.
Here was Ginger behind Harold Bentley and Ronald Kemp, together with a man
called Allen and another called Garton, working their way out of a wood behind
a battery of guns and ammunition wagons which had been rescued from a horde of
Germans in the neighbourhood of a farmhouse, and, oddly, all of them were
wearing the uniforms of German Uhlans; why this was, Ginger could not in the
least understand.</p>
<p>Then into the vision came a trench, a battered trench, blown almost out of
recognition, and inside it a hundred or so of men in khaki, who crowded round
the guns with cheers and yells. And after this, hundreds and hundreds of
Germans charging down into the trench, evidently expecting an easy prey, and on
the top of this the roar of the guns and shells bursting into the ranks of the
foe at almost point-blank range. This seemed to go on hour after hour until the
Germans melted away into heaps of blue-grey refuse lying on the open fields,
and somebody was saying that it was a narrow squeak, for there were not more
than a dozen shells left. Then the vision changed again; the guns had been
blown up and dismantled, and a handful of Musketeers in Uhlan uniform were
bursting through a German patrol and dashing along a road where someone said
that the British rearguard were only a mile or two away. Then it seemed to
Ginger that something struck him between the shoulders and he rolled off the
horse which he had been riding, and lay there on the hard road looking up at
the frosty stars.</p>
<p>Followed a long blank, and then a confused vision of himself lying on a heap
of straw in a charcoal burner's hut, with an old man bending over him and
holding a bottle to his lips. The man was telling Ginger in broken English that
the Musketeers had got clear away, and then he himself had seen them safely
into the English lines. After this came a long dream of pain and some delusion
as to a cart in which he had been placed and hidden under a thick covering of
straw. Then in time he had heard the bugles again and old, familiar voices, and
somebody was lifting him into a train. After that the rumble of engines, and
the smell of salt water, and now this.</p>
<p>Consciousness was coming back, so that Ginger's eye gradually cleared and he
could look around him. He could see a big room, in which were some 20 beds; he
could see women moving about, nurses in hospital dress, and every now and then
he heard a groan of pain from one of the adjacent beds. One of the nurses
attracted his attention. She was tall and slim, with a pleasant smile upon her
face; she had grey-blue eyes, and the fading light glistened on her fair hair.
On the walls were pictures and panels of silk, here and there, with little
ornaments on brackets.</p>
<p>"I'm in 'orspital, I am," Ginger told himself. "'Ope it ain't a German one;
not that there's much the matter wif it if it is. But that angel over yonder
ain't no German. An' if I ain't seen 'er before, call me a Dutchman. I've seen
'er playin' golf. 'Praps she'll come an' speak ter me presently."</p>
<p>Ginger turned over on one side and coughed. He was pleasantly surprised to
find that the exertion gave him no pain. The last time his cough was
troublesome it had racked him through and through with a physical anguish that
brought out the perspiration all over him. But he was still under the spell of
the powerful drug that deadened every physical sense, while it still left his
brain clear and active.</p>
<p>A moment or two later the pretty nurse approached Ginger's bedside. She bent
over him smiling.</p>
<p>"How are you feeling now?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Much as if I'd stepped straight into 'eaven," Ginger said. "I s'pose they
got me all right; not as I remembers anythin' abaht it. 'Ow did I get 'ere,
miss?"</p>
<p>"You came here by train," Dorothy said.</p>
<p>"Oh, somewhere in France, am I?"</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact, you are not far from London," Dorothy responded. "Near
Harrow, to be correct."</p>
<p>Ginger lay back for a moment or two, trying to grasp the full extent of this
miracle.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm dashed," he said. "The last thing I clearly remember is coming
dahn in a road off an 'orse. I was the only one they got, and I giv' up meself
as done for. I daresay as it'll all come back ter me later on."</p>
<h2><a id="chap21" name="chap21">XXI - GINGER'S ODYSSEY</a></h2>
<p class="first">Here was something altogether outside Ginger's outlook. He
had, of course, expected that the time would come when he would either give up
his life for his country or find himself grievously wounded, in which latter
case he had been quite prepared to make the best of it and at best lie
neglected on a heap of damp straw whilst better men than himself were
monopolising the Army Service Corps. That he should have been picked up and
waited upon hand and foot as if he had been a person of some importance struck
him almost in the light of a joke.</p>
<p>"Strike me," he said, "they must 'ave taken me for a bloomin' orficer. It
was that German uniform as done it. I was got up regardless of expense,
somethin' between a comic opera major an' a circus rider. An' I expect the army
service chaps took me for a German general at least. I wonder if yer 'appens
ter know exactly wot I am, miss."</p>
<p>"One of the Musketeers, I think," Dorothy said.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm just that," Ginger replied. "A full-blown private, though when we
got cut off from the rest of the battalion the colonel's come ter me an' tells
me as I was a sergeant. I dare say I shall get my stripes in time."</p>
<p>"Oh, so you are the man who captured the German machine gun?" Dorothy
asked.</p>
<p>"How did yer come ter know that?" Ginger demanded.</p>
<p>Dorothy bit her lip. It was impossible for her to tell Ginger whence her
information came, or to discuss that mysterious letter from the front with the
man lying there and regarding her with amazement in his eyes.</p>
<p>"'Twaren't anythin'," Ginger said. "Besides, somebody 'ad ter do it. An' if
it 'adn't bin me, it ud 'ave bin somebody else. Lor' bless yer, miss, those
things 'appen every day out yonder, and we don't think nothin' abaht 'em. Lots
o' little things as would mean Victoria Crosses in an ordinary war go on just
as regular as we 'as our breakfast, a good deal more regular than we got our
breakfast the last fortnight."</p>
<p>Something like illumination had come to Dorothy. Her mind had gone back to
the time before Harold and her brother left for France, and she recalled now
the amusing story of Ginger and how he came to join the Musketeers.</p>
<p>"I'm sure I can't be mistaken," she said. "You look so different, and yet so
familiar."</p>
<p>"I was goin' ter say the same thing abaht you, miss," Ginger replied. "But
my mind is in such a muddle that I still don't rightly know whether I'm asleep
or not. I'm afraid I shall wake presently an' find as it's all a dream. If it
wasn't for that 'orspital dress o' your'n an' I was all right in my head, like,
I wouldn't mind making a small bet as you was Miss Kemp, the sister of the man
wot made me join the army an' saved me from bein' a loafer fer the rest o' my
life. I suppose you don't 'appen ter' ave a sister, miss?"</p>
<p>"I am Mr. Ronald Kemp's sister," Dorothy said. "And you are the a man I
first heard sing 'Tipperary.' Surely you haven't forgotten the recruiting
concert we held here?"</p>
<p>Ginger hunched himself up in bed and lay there a few minutes trying to get
the whole thing clear in his mind. After all, the miracle had really happened.
In some extraordinary way he had been conveyed to England, and by the most
amazing good luck found himself amongst friends. And that they were friends in
the best sense of the word Ginger did not doubt for a moment. He held out his
hand eagerly.</p>
<p>"I shall get it presently," he said. "For three or four months now I've been
living in a land of wonders and bloomin' miracles. But this is the absolute
limit. It's a rightdown corker. It reminds me of a Drury Lane pantomime, a sort
of 'Aladdin' or some of the other 'Arabian Nights.' To think as I should be
brought over 'ere an' made such a fuss of by a lidy like you! 'Ow d'you manage
it, miss? Did yer 'ave the tip ter look after me particularly, or was it a bit
o' blind luck like 'avin' us dream abaht an outsider fer the Derby an' backin'
'im at a 'undred ter one? P'raps you got the tip from yer brother. A rare good
friend ter me 'e was. 'E show'd me 'ow ter make a man 'o meself; yus, 'e giv me
the charnce over an' over again, though I never 'ad brines enough ter tike it
till this war broke aht. An' even then 'e more or less forced me ter do
it."</p>
<p>"My brother doesn't even know that you are alive," Dorothy exclaimed. "We
had a long letter from him a day or two ago, in which he told us a good deal
about your exploits; in fact, he spoke of you in the highest possible way."</p>
<p>"Did 'e really, miss," Ginger said gratefully. "'E always were a kind'earted
gentleman. An' aht yonder we was all brothers together. The gentleman who 'ad
bin at public schools and Oxford Colleges didn't think no more abaht wot the
Sunday pipers calls social distinctions. In the trenches we was just brothers
together. There was Mr. Kemp and Mr. Bentley, likewise Mr. Garton and Mr.
Allen, and me an' the rest o' my class all sittin' dahn eatin' our grub
together as friendly as a litter 'o puppies in a kennel yard. An' only two or
three months ago 'arf a dozen of us lot was loafin' abaht the golf clubs dahn
Richmond way an' waitin' fer a job from the same gentlemen as is now fightin'
side by side wif us with numbers on their shoulder straps and rifles in their
'ands."</p>
<p>"It sounds splendid," Dorothy said. "When you are a little better I should
like to hear all about that wonderful retreat, and how your company recovered
those guns and fought in the trenches while the rest of the battalion cut their
way through to safety. I can't tell you how glad I am, Ginger, that Miss
Bentley and myself have had this opportunity to show our gratitude to you for
the splendid things you have done."</p>
<p>"That's a big word, isn't it, miss?" Ginger asked.</p>
<p>"What, gratitude? I don't think so. You don't seem to realise exactly what
you have done. And it is little by comparison that we women can do. You must
understand that this is my brother's house and that we have turned it into a
hospital which is being looked after by Miss Bentley and myself and some of my
friends. I asked the War Office to send as many Musketeers down here as
possible, but when the poor fellows arrived this afternoon I had no idea that
we were going to welcome anybody so celebrated as Private Ginger Smith. I know
you won't mind my calling you by that name."</p>
<p>"I ain't celebrated," the gratified Ginger grinned. "I ain't no more than an
ordinary Tommy doin' 'is little bit fer a shillin' a day. Not as the bob
attracted me much. You don't mean ter say as they've bin talkin' abaht me in
the pipers, do you? I ain't posin' as no 'ero."</p>
<p>"It is hardly for you to judge," Dorothy said. "At any rate, the public
think you are, and I am of the same opinion. When you feel a little stronger
and better I am going to get you to tell me the story of the Musketeers and how
your company saved the rest of the regiment."</p>
<p>"You're actually goin' ter keep me 'ere fer a bit, miss?" Ginger asked.
"Keep me 'ere and 'ave me waited upon by you lidies as if I was one 'o
yourselves?"</p>
<p>"We are under the impression that you are," Dorothy said. "And you are going
to stay here till you are well enough to go back to the front again."</p>
<p>Ginger lay back, trying to grasp the full meaning of this stupendous
promise. He wanted to apologise, to explain how sorry he was to give all this
trouble.</p>
<p>"All right, miss," he said helplessly. "I'll try an' tell you to-morrow wot
I think, only words don't come easy just fer the minute. An' I'm more tired
than wot I thought I was."</p>
<h2><a id="chap22" name="chap22">XXII - THE NEW REPUBLIC</a></h2>
<p class="first">A naturally strong constitution and a frame hardened and
toughened by exposure stood in Ginger's favour, so that from the very first he
began to mend. It was his own opinion that the end of a month would see him
back in the trenches again, a thing that he longed for with his whole heart and
soul. For Ginger had found that he had a vocation in life, and his own proper
pride told him that he was no longer a human derelict thrown from pillar to
post but a real live asset and respected as such by the state.</p>
<p>At the same time, he was extraordinarily grateful even for the smallest
kindness. He could not grasp the reason why these ladies should pay him so much
attention. Even if he had been in the same class as themselves, even if he had
been brought up amongst them and shared their instincts and traditions, they
could not have made more of him. From time to time since he had taken his
shilling and enrolled himself as a soldier of the King, he had given occasional
stray thoughts to what might happen to him if he were wounded. What the
procedure would be in that case he had the vaguest possible notions. He was
under the impression that he would be thrown into a tent or a hut somewhere,
where he would be left to recover and perhaps occasionally see a doctor who
would dress his wounds for him. In the course of his life Ginger had had one or
two illnesses, and he had fought through these in some miserable garret or
other, more or less looked after by some outcast only a little less wretched
than himself. He had not grumbled, for this kind of thing had been his lot and
seemed likely to be so for the rest of his natural life. He did not realise
that there were thousands and thousands of his own class picked up out of the
gutters by the recruiting sergeants and now in process of being moulded into
useful citizens.</p>
<p>Therefore Ginger's gratitude knew no bounds. He told himself over and over
again that if he had been what he called a bloomin' orficer he could not
possibly be any better off. And he was also getting over a certain ferocious
shyness which some people might have taken for blatant impudence. But that was
the way of his class, though he did not know it himself.</p>
<p>As strength came back to him and he began to sit up in bed, he became more
communicative, though as yet he had not told either Dorothy or Nettie the story
of the heroic defence that had saved the Musketeers from destruction.</p>
<p>There were others of the Musketeers in the same room, but at first they had
been too ill to think of anything. But as they got better and Ginger began to
assert himself, there was a good deal of gossip to which two at any rate of the
nurses listened with the deepest interest.</p>
<p>Dorothy and Nettie were happy in the work they were doing. They had the
satisfaction of feeling that they were doing some real good. The knowledge that
they were helping these modest heroes, instead of wasting their time attending
lectures or knitting comforts, brought its own reward. They were busy from
morning till night, and had little time to think or grieve. They were only two
of the many millions of English women whose hearts were full of anxiety just
then, and whose eyes were turned eagerly across the seas. But they had found
the best panacea for trouble in good and honest work.</p>
<p>There were many men there whom they liked, for they were all grateful and
only too eager to show how they appreciated the kindness shown them, but if
there was a favourite amongst them it was Ginger beyond all doubt.</p>
<p>It was at the end of the second week that Ginger found himself sitting out
in the sun in a bath-chair smoking a cigarette as if, in his own words, he had
bought the bloomin' place.</p>
<p>It was a mild, warm morning, bright and sunny, and Ginger was feeling the
joy of life coursing through his veins. Nettie established herself in a chair
by his side, and Dorothy was not far off, in close attendance on a few more
convalescents, all of whom had been in the trenches with Ginger and the two men
who occupied so much of the girls' thoughts.</p>
<p>"This is jest great," Ginger said. "If anybody'd told me six mouths ago as I
should be sittin' 'ere to-day in this beautiful garden with you two ladies
waitin' upon me, I should 'ave laughed. 'Ere we are as large as life an' twice
as natural, me wot was the nothin' more than a loafer made as much fuss of as
if I'd done something to be proud of."</p>
<p>"And so you have," Nettie smiled. "So you all have. At any rate, we are
proud to be here with you. Anybody would be for the matter of that."</p>
<p>"Do you 'ear that, you chaps?" Ginger said turning to his companions. "Why
don't you get up an' make a bow to the lidy? There's those three on the seat,
miss, grinnin' like a lot o' monkeys an' leavin' me to do all the talkin'."</p>
<p>"Nobody could do it better, Ginger," one of the men on the seat said. "You
go on an' we'll listen."</p>
<p>"All right, Joe," Ginger said. "An' 'Arry an' George'll contradict me if I
say wot ain't true. Now jest look at those three chaps, miss. They're three o'
my recruits. Four months ago they was sellin' pipers in the West End. Three
miserable weeds o' chaps as you could 'ave blown away almost. But it was only
because they didn't get enough to eat, an' slept most o' the winter out o'
doors. An' jest you look at 'em now, though they are wounded and a bit run
down. Joe yonder once lived for three days in an outlyin' trench with 'arf a
dozen biscuits an' a bottle o' water. An' because there was a man with 'im who
was wounded 'e pretended as 'e'd got 'is full rations, an' for the 'ole o'
those three odd days Joe never 'ad a mawthtul o' nothin'. An' 'e never said a
word abaht it ter nobody, an' it was only by accident we found it out."</p>
<p>"Don't you believe a word of it, miss," Joe said blushingly. "Besides, even
if it was true, there ain't nothin' in it. I'm used ter that sort o' thing.
Many's the time I've gone wifout food for three days when things was
slack."</p>
<p>"I think I know whom to believe," Nettie said gently.</p>
<p>"An' then there's George," Ginger went on. "George is the man wot climbed
out 'o the trenches one wet night an' brought in three of our wounded from
within a few yards 'o a German trench. Brought 'em on 'is back one after
another, 'e did. An' that's 'ow 'e got wounded. An' 'e said nothin' abaht it
neither. An' 'Arry, I don't jest know wot 'Arry did for the moment. Wot was it,
ole man?"</p>
<p>"Blowed if I remember," 'Arry responded.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, yer do," the man called George exclaimed. "We were short o' food
that day, for the Germans 'ad rushed a part of our trenches an' we dare not
move till the reserves came up. So 'Arry 'e volunteers ter do wot 'e could, an'
'e sets out in broad daylight with the bullets a-whizzin' around 'im, an' 'e
comes back presently with enough to go on with till dark. An' nobody says
nuffin' because all these things are in a day's work, if you lidies know wot I
mean."</p>
<p>"It all sounds splendid," Dorothy said, "It makes me wish I was a man
myself."</p>
<p>"An' I'm jolly glad you're not," Ginger said. "We should not be 'avin' the
'appy times we are if you were. There was a time not so very long ago when I
thought lidies was good fer nothin' except ter run abaht in motor cars an' play
golf an' go to theatres an' that sort o' thing."</p>
<p>"I am afraid we used to share the same opinion," Dorothy said. "But don't
forget that you promised to tell us how your company saved the Musketeers."</p>
<h2><a id="chap23" name="chap23">XXIII - IN THE VERNACULAR</a></h2>
<p class="first">"There ain't anybody could do it better," George said.</p>
<p>Subdued applause came from the other two.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll do my best," Ginger said. "You must understand, lidies, as we
was more or less cut off from the rest of the battalion. Our company was in the
advance trenches, an' it was fortunate for us as the Germans in front didn't
know jest 'ow weak we was. An' one night the colonel 'e comes to us, an' 'e
tells us exactly 'ow it was. When 'e'd finished speakin' we know'd as we was
done for. Wot we 'ad to do was to fight to the last man an' give the rest of
the battalion a chance to cut their way through an' join the division. We'd
used up all our food pretty well, an' there weren't no ammunition left, so we
was goin' to rely upon the bayonet. It was all the worse for us, 'cos we was
enfiladed on the right by a machine gun which looked like wipin' us aht
altogether. Well, we managed by a bit o' good luck to get rid o' that."</p>
<p>"'Ere, stop!" George cried. "None o' that, Ginger. I ain't much good at
tellin' a story myself, but I knows when the other chap's tellin' it wrong. An'
you promised ter tell these lidies all abaht it. Won't you make 'im tell the
truth, miss? God knows wot might 'ave 'appened to us if we 'adn't got rid o'
that machine gun."</p>
<p>"It ain't for me to speak o' that," Ginger said hotly. "If you feels as you
wants to do a bit o' gassin', I'll trouble you fer another cigarette whilst you
take up the tale."</p>
<p>"It's got ter be done, miss," George said as Ginger subsided more or less
sulkily into his chair. "Those chaps 'ad worked up that gun to the very edge o'
the trench, an' we couldn't 'ave stayed there ten minutes longer. It was too
dangerous to call for volunteers, but Ginger 'ere 'e jest 'opped along the top
o' the trench into a field o' beetroot where the machine gun was placed. Then
'e crawls along on 'is 'ands an' knees right up under the muzzle o' the gun and
upsets it. Then 'e goes for the gunner, and quicker'n I'm tellin' you does 'em
in, an' 'e's back again with the gun all in less than five minutes. An' if
Ginger says that ain't true, all I can say is 'e's a liar."</p>
<p>"Anybody could 'a' done it," Ginger growled. "It was as easy as fallin' off
the top of a 'ouse. You see, I was quite 'idden under that beetroot, an' all I
'ad to do when I'd worked myself up under the gun was to jest grab for it an'
upset the whole bag o' tricks. You never see three blokes so astonished in yer
life. Before they could do anything I was on top o' them, an' you can guess the
rest. An' now p'raps I can get on with my story without any more vulgar
interruptions."</p>
<p>"I only wanted to 'ave it right," George protested. "As the story's got to
be told, there's no reason to leave all the best parts of it out. There was
some bloomin' fine things done that night. But when we come to talk it over
afterwards amongst ourselves, we give our vote to Ginger an' that little
business with the machine gun."</p>
<p>"You're wrong there, ole man," Ginger said modestly. "To my mind, the best
bit o' work was with that German sentry. I mean when we was makin' our way into
the wood where the guns was 'idden. You see, it was like this miss. We come to
a place where we 'ad to cross a fence and get into a wood. It wouldn't 'ave bin
difficult in the ordinary way, but there 'appened to be a couple o' sentries
there, and we couldn't get another yard till they was out o' the way. O'
course, we could 'a shot 'em easily enough, for they was almost at the muzzles
of our rifles. But that would never 'ave done. As it 'appens, there was no
Germans in earshot, except those two, but we wasn't expected to know that, an'
we didn't want the 'ole o' the German army down upon us. So we jest stopped an'
'ad a bit o' a confab, an' Mr. Kemp&mdash;that's your brother, miss&mdash;'e
thought o' a little plan. You see, there was not more than twenty of us
altogether, an' we crept out o' the trenches lookin' for our captured
ammunition wagon an' the field guns that came in so useful later on, and those
German sentries absolutely blocked the way so far as we was concerned. Did I
tell you as we was a kind o' forlorn 'ope? There was only about a score o' us
altogether. Well, we 'ad to do in them sentries, and Mr. Kemp 'e asks if there
is anybody amongst us as can patter the German lingo. An' up gets a chap named
Garton, wot's a merchant in the city in peace time, an' says 'e can speak
German a treat. Mr. Garton, 'e's rather a fat chap, a jolly-lookin' man, a sort
as you'd never think could kill a fly in the ordinary way. But 'e was quite
ready, because, you see, 'e could speak the language, 'avin' spent some years
in Germany when 'e was a boy. The gime was fer 'im to crawl up the fence an'
pretend as 'e was a' wounded German lookin' fer 'is friends. 'E was to arsk
them to 'elp 'im over the fence, an 'e 'ad a chap on either side o' 'im ready
to do in them sentries as soon as ever they put out their 'ands to 'elp their
wounded comrade, as they thought 'e was. We all 'eld our breff for a minute,
but it come off all right, an' a minute or two later we was in the wood on the
track o' the guns.</p>
<p>"Oh, we found them, too, an' the ammunition, also our cartridges, and we
found something better'n that. By a bit o' sheer good luck we blundered right
into a lot o' prisoners wot turned out to be our own gunners, and then up comes
an ole Frenchy 'oo told us as 'is farm'ouse was full o' German officers, Uhlans
they was, with a few troopers waitin' on them. 'E was a proper ole chap was
that farmer, wot 'ad fought in the Franco-Prussian War, 'an' 'e gave us a
hinvite ter go along o' 'im and drop in jest as those chaps was sittin' dahn
ter supper. Well, miss, I don't mind tellin' you as the suggestion of a good
feed on roast chicken and duck sort o' appealed to us, considering as we was
livin' on abaht two biscuits a day an' 'arf a pint o' water. So far as we could
gather, there wasn't any Germans within three miles. So we turns up at the
farmhouse, jest as that little lot were openin' their wine and carvin' the
ducks, and you never see such a 'Ho wot a surprise in your life' as we marched
into that kitchen through two doors. They was plucky enough, I will say that
for them, but we took 'em quite unawares, an' in less time than it takes to
tell we 'ad 'em out in the farmyard, an' buried 'em, after which we ate their
supper an' drank their wine.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm gettin' near to the end o' my story now. Long before daylight we
was back in the trenches with those guns of ours, an' jolly useful they came
in. All the next day we mowed the Germans down with 'em till we 'adn't got any
shells left, and then we togged ourselves out in the Uhlans' uniforms an'
mounted the horses we 'ad taken from them, an' made our way to the rear. We
knew pretty well where we should run into the British again, an' for 'arf a
mile or more we rode through the German lines without bein' challenged. You
see, they took us for some o' themselves. Then something happened, I don't know
quite wot it was, but I suppose they smelt a rat, an' the next thing I remember
was a volley from their rifles; but it was too late. Most of us were through by
that time. I may be wrong, but I don't think they got anybody but me, an' I
managed to stick on to my 'orse for a few 'undred yards before I collapsed.
Afterwards, I believe, an old peasant picked me up, an' I don't recollect
anything more till I come to myself 'ere, an' you, miss, was lookin' after us
as if I'd been yer own brother. An' that's 'ow we managed to save the
Musketeers from being wiped out. An' I'm afraid it isn't much of a story after
all, is it, miss?"</p>
<p>Dorothy made no reply for a moment or two. It was the sheer simplicity of
Ginger's story and the modesty of it that appealed to her more than anything
else.</p>
<h2><a id="chap24" name="chap24">XXIV. - NEWS FROM THE FRONT</a></h2>
<p class="first">The days were going on. Already the hospital at the Keep House
had lost some of its wounded and others had taken their place. Ginger and his
own friends still remained, though they were getting strong now, and looking
forward to rejoining their comrades in the trenches. For some little time now
the story of the retreat of the Musketeers and how they had been saved by a
handful of their own regiment had been public property, and Ginger and the rest
of them were in a fair way to be made much of; but they resolutely declined to
regard their accomplishment as anything out of the common, and though more than
one resolute journalist presented himself at the Keep House, Ginger resolutely
declined to see him or open his mouth on the subject.</p>
<p>"It ain't nothin' ter make a fuss abaht," he said. "Now, what is it that
little man in the straw 'at and white spats wants me to do? 'Ave I got ter make
a speech and tell 'im all abaht it? It ain't anybody's business but our own.
Wot do you think, chaps?"</p>
<p>"You'd better see 'im and arsk 'im if 'e'd like ter come back wiv us,"
George smiled. "'E evidently tikes yer fer a celebrity. But I shouldn't wonder
if 'e's come along with an invitation for the lot of us to do a turn at the
'alls. 'Ow Ginger an' 'is pals 'eld up the German Army, and wot Bill Kaiser 'ad
ter say abaht it. Tell 'im if that's 'is gime we've already booked engigements
to appear in the leadin' music 'alls at a thousand quid a week, includin'
beer."</p>
<p>But Ginger was in no mood just then to see the humour of the situation. He
wanted to know why people came bothering him in this way. He was perfectly
happy and comfortable, and all he wanted to do was to get well so that he could
be in the firing line once more. Nettie listened absently to this suggestion on
the part of George and the rest, for the post had just come in bringing a batch
of letters for Dorothy and herself, amongst them being two from her brother and
Ronald Kemp, and she was naturally anxious to see what they had to say. For
these were the first letters which had come through since the boys had cut
their way back to the regiment, and so far the girls had had to be content with
field post cards.</p>
<p>There was a good deal on the subject of Ginger in Harold's letter to
Dorothy.</p>
<p>"I have only just heard," he said, "about your hospital scheme. I have
talked it over with Ronald, and we both think it absolutely splendid. So far as
I can see we shall lack nothing in the way of comforts this winter, and you are
much better employed nursing the soldiers than in knitting socks, which of
course ought to be organised labour in the hands of women who are accustomed to
that kind of thing. But I need not go into that. The hospital scheme is the
thing, and you two girls are doing as much good as if you were out here
fighting. Since I began to write this letter one of our subalterns who has been
home on short leave has turned up, and he tells me that he has been staying in
your neighbourhood and that your patients mostly consist of Musketeers. In that
case, I expect you have a man called Ginger Smith amongst them. If so, you'll
recollect him. He was the man who did so well at that recruiting meeting we
had. You will remember that Ronnie enlisted him out of the ranks of the
Richmond caddies. It was one of the best day's work he ever did, for Ginger is
a real good chap and a born soldier. He is always cheerful and always happy,
and he has a big hold over his mates. In fact, I don't see how we could
possibly have saved the battalion and cut our way through without him. Let me
tell you there were some pretty big things done in those days; in fact, it
would take me a week to tell you all about it. It's no use asking Ginger, he'll
only make fun of the whole thing, and pretend that he did nothing. But if you
get hold of some of the other chaps you won't find them so reticent, especially
if Ginger doesn't happen to be within hearing. Of course, he will never get a
commission or anything of that kind, because he's not that type of man, as you
never can get him to take anything seriously. But probably some day, when he
tones down a bit, he will make a good sergeant major, or perhaps a
quartermaster. I want you to keep a special eye upon Ginger, and send him back
as soon as possible."</p>
<p>There were other letters besides this, one of them in an official envelope
that caused Dorothy to gasp when she read it. It came from the secretary of a
very exalted personage, and intimated that the great Person in question and his
Consort would like to pay a short visit to the Keep House hospital and say a
few words to the wounded. This was in the earlier days of the war when private
hospitals were more or less of a novelty, so that the venture that Dorothy and
Nettie were running was still something rather out of the common.</p>
<p>"What shall we do about it?" Nettie asked.</p>
<p>"I don't see there is anything to do about it," Dorothy replied. "This
suggestion is in the nature of a command, and as our distinguished guests have
fixed their own time, the day after tomorrow, all we can do is to write to the
Palace and say that we shall be honoured by the visit."</p>
<p>Two days later the Royal party presented themselves at the Keep House. Much
to the surprise of the girls, they came in a motor just like any Great Man and
Great Lady, the Personage in khaki and the Lady as simply dressed as if she
were just doing a morning's shopping. With them were two staff officers,
distinguished generals in their day, and beyond this there was nothing to
attract the least attention. After the first moment the girls were entirely at
their ease, for the Royal visitors shook hands with them in the most simple,
unaffected way and congratulated them upon the fine work they were doing. Then
they proceeded to go over the house and into the ward where the wounded were
prepared for their coming.</p>
<p>The Great Man seemed to know exactly what to say and do; he had heard all
about Ginger's exploit, and he and the Great Lady sat down by the wounded
hero's bedside and chatted to him in a way that, as Ginger said afterwards,
made him feel that he had known them all his life. But he was obstinately shy
on the subject of his own exploit, and could not be brought to say anything
about it. It was only by judicious promptings from the neighbouring beds that
the distinguished questioner elicited the story of the machine gun and of how
Ginger's conduct on that occasion had saved the whole of the company. For the
best part of an hour the Royal party stayed there, and everybody was sorry when
they took their leave, which they did after congratulating the girls upon the
perfection of their arrangements.</p>
<p>"I suppose we can still speak to you, Ginger, can't we?" George said when at
length the room was quiet again. "When is it as you're goin' to put in a
weekend at the Palace?"</p>
<p>"'Ere, not so much of it," Ginger said. "Anybody'd think to hear you chaps
talk as I'd never spoken to Royalty before. It's the first time as I ever shook
'ands with the King and I don't suppose I ever shall again. But I ain't givin'
myself frills, because 'e did the same wiv all of us. An' I don't mind tellin'
you as I've caddied for Royalty down at Richmond more than once. But I wasn't
called anything but caddie in those days, an' I never expected as a King would
tike me by the hand an' call me sargeant and say I was a credit to me country.
This 'as bin a big day fer us, an' we ain't goin' ter forget it. We can laugh
at it, but it's something I'll be proud of to my dyin' day. Wot yer grinnin'
at? You know jolly well you're as proud as I am. An' now wot's all this talk
about goin' to the football match this afternoon?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap25" name="chap25">XXV - PLAIN WORDS</a></h2>
<p class="first">It happened to be Saturday afternoon, and a few miles away two
of the leading clubs in the first division of the League were meeting to decide
which of them should go into the next round of the Association cup. There was
not a man in the Keep House who was not anxious to be present, and perhaps half
a dozen of them were well enough to go. They were as anxious to see the match
as if they had been a lot of boys, and they had been talking about it wistfully
for the last few days.</p>
<p>At first it had not occurred to either Dorothy or Nettie that it was in
their power to give Ginger and some of the other convalescents a real treat.
Then the girls suddenly discovered that a chance had come to do so.</p>
<p>"I don't see why they shouldn't go," Dorothy said. "This war puts everything
else out of one's head. I had quite forgotten that I am a bit of an enthusiast
over football myself. Two or three years ago Ronald used to play for a league
club, and when the match was near London I generally went. I found out this
morning how keen some of our men are to see the game, and telephoned for half a
dozen stand tickets and they have just come. We will take six of them in two of
the cars, so you had better go and tell Ginger all about it. There is no
occasion to leave here before two o'clock."</p>
<p>Nettie walked into the ward where the men were having their dinner and
introduced the subject of the League match.</p>
<p>"I am going with Miss Kemp," she said.</p>
<p>Ginger's eyes gleamed and he caught his breath.</p>
<p>"Wish I was goin' along," he said. "There's George and 'Arry an' one or two
more as would give a bit to go an' cheer on the Rangers. But wot's the good o'
thinkin' abaht that?"</p>
<p>"We won't think about it," Nettie smiled; "We'll go. I've been discussing
the matter with the doctor, and he has given his permission for us to take six
of you. The car will be at the door in about a quarter of an hour."</p>
<p>"What d'you think o' that," Ginger said when Nettie had departed. "Nothin'
don't seem ter be too much trouble where we're concerned. They ain't just
lidies, they're angels as ain't 'appy unless they're doin' something for us
chaps. An' we're goin' in style, too, don't forget it. We're goin' in our car
like regular toffs, an' we shall sit on the grandstand away from all the common
lot. Who wouldn't be a soldier?"</p>
<p>On the whole it was an afternoon to be remembered. As Ginger had prophesied
they occupied seats in the centre of the grandstand, conspicuous in their blue
uniforms; they were the only wounded present, for it was still in the
comparatively early days of the war and so far the broken British had been seen
little or nothing of in their own country, so they came in for a good deal of
embarrassing attention which tried Ginger sorely.</p>
<p>"It's a pity as we didn't disguise ourselves," he growled. "In these blessed
blue togs I feel as if I was a monkey on a stick. Sort o' cheap swank, eh?"</p>
<p>But Ginger and his companions forgot all that presently in the excitement of
the play. For three-quarters of an hour, until the interval, they followed the
game breathlessly, and then Ginger began to take an interest in the crowd.</p>
<p>"They're a queer lot, ain't they," he said. "There must be fifteen thousand
here altogether, an' not a tenth o' them in uniform. Blimme, wot're they
thinkin' abaht? I could form the best part of an Army Corps out o' the chaps
loafin' abaht 'ere with cigarettes in the corners o' their mawths whilst we're
doin' our bit over yonder. It's a bit o' a shock ter me, that's wot it is. I
thought the bloomin' ole country'd woke up, but it seems to me that it ain't.
These chaps 'ere don't seem to realise wot we're up against. I ain't got much
use fer the gab, but if some body don't 'old me down I'll 'ave ter get up
presently and address the meetin'."</p>
<p>A keen-eyed man next to Ginger turned to him eagerly.</p>
<p>"Would you like to do it?" he asked. "I understand that during the interval
the member for the division is going to make an appeal for recruits from the
stand. That's him coming along now. In my opinion, if one of you chaps got up
and said a few words, it would do more good than an address from any number of
members of Parliament."</p>
<p>Ginger growled something and subsided into silence as the little procession
advanced to the front of the stand, preceded by a band of pipers. They took up
their place just in front of Ginger and his companions, and the member of
Parliament began to speak. He meant well enough, and he spoke earnestly enough,
but there was not the right ring about it. He was trite and commonplace, full
of platitudes, and when he had finished and invited recruits to step forward
there was no response and hardly a cheer from the grandstand. Then the speaker
smiled feebly and invited further comment.</p>
<p>"Get up and say a bit, Ginger," George said.</p>
<p>Ginger hung back for a moment, growling to himself, and then he rose to his
feet; he swept the ring of young active men with a contemptuous eye; he was
full of bitterness against those young fellows who seemed to have only one
single thought, and that for the game, in exclusion to everything else.</p>
<p>"I'd like to say a few words," he began. "I ain't no speaker like the
bloke&mdash;I mean the gentleman&mdash;as has just sat down; I'm just a Tommy I
am, one o' the Muskekteers wot did that little bit for the flag when we was
fallin' back before six 'undred thousand Germans. Try an' think o' that. Six
'undred thousand of them. More than double the size o' the Regular British Army
when it's on a war footin'. An' when you chaps 'ave just bitten that bit off
an' swallowed it, try an' realise as the six 'undred thousand Germans I'm
talkin' abaht is only a tenth part o' wot the Germans 'ave got in the field.
You sits quietly at 'ome 'ere, an' you pats yerself on the back becorse ye've
got three 'undred thousand men out yonder as' you goes abaht shoutin' Rule
Britannia as if the whole bloomin' thing was over. And don't you get imagin' as
one British soldier's as good as ten Germans, 'cos they ain't. I ain't sayin'
nothing abaht their manners and their customs, which is disgustin', but they
can fight an' don't you forget it. Wot's goin' to become of us if all you chaps
stays at 'ome watchin' football matches an' spendin' yer evenins in picture
palaces. That ain't the way to beat the Germans, you can take it from me. An'
now listen&mdash;"</p>
<p>Very simply, and with a rugged eloquence that appealed to the hearts of the
crowd, Ginger told the story of the Musketeers, keeping back his own part and
mentioned no names. But presently some one in the crowd seemed to guess who the
speaker was, and as the name ran from lip to lip there was a wild outburst of
cheering, far louder than anything that had followed during the time of play.
There was no forensic agility about Ginger's effort, but it came straight from
the lips of a man who had suffered himself and who knew what war meant. He
dropped into his seat presently, hot and breathless, and for some reason a
little ashamed of himself. But his words had not been wasted, for when the
recruiting sergeant in front of that stand asked for a practical response to
Ginger's appeal there was a rush to come forward, and somebody announced that
this had been so far the most successful campaign on any football field in
London.</p>
<p>"Anybody could 'ave done that," Ginger said. "The chap as spoke first didn't
understand. Wot's 'e know abaht war? 'E's never seen any of it. I 'ope you
didn't mind, miss?"</p>
<p>"It was splendid," Dorothy said. "We shall have to send you round the
country doing this sort of thing."</p>
<h2><a id="chap26" name="chap26">XXVI - THE OLD SPIRIT</a></h2>
<p class="first">The philosophy of Ginger is, generally speaking, the
philosophy of the British Army, and it is this spirit that helped largely to
break down the conspiracy which has been preparing on the other side of the
Rhine for the last forty years. Our army in Flanders may not be entirely
composed of Gingers; it may largely lack the saving sense of humour, but the
dogged spirit and indomitable will are there, and will be until the great peace
is signed in Berlin.</p>
<p>The British public has never realised, and probably never will realise, the
deadly peril of the first few weeks of the campaign in the west. We were a
nation caught absolutely unprepared, and much the same thing can be said with
regard to the French&mdash;an amazing thing concerning the warnings they have
had&mdash;but there were a few people in Europe last August who fully
appreciated the situation. In the early days at Liege it began to appear as if
the gallant little Belgians would be able to hold up the German hosts long
enough to give England and France an opportunity of saving the situation. The
Germans perished by the thousand, but they were nothing daunted and once Liege
was passed they overran Belgium like a plague of locusts. General French's army
of less than a hundred thousand men was forced back from Mons on August 23, and
for a few days the retreat threatened to degenerate into a disorderly rout.
From some cause which will probably never become known, the French supports and
reinforcements failed to materialise, and the struggle degenerated into a
soldiers' battle the like of which has never been seen since the historic field
of Inkermann. A fortnight later, on September 6, the battered and bruised
British army halted to the east of Paris, prepared to take part in the siege of
the French capital. Just for a moment it looked as if the fall of Paris was
certain. The Germans, under von Kluck, were actually in sight of the forts, and
they boasted that within a week they would be inside.</p>
<p>The wonder is that any British army was left at all. For up to a brief
breathing spell when the British army moved from its position on the Aisne to
fresh quarters farther west, it had been fighting desperately day by day and
hour by hour for the best part of two months.</p>
<p>To begin with, there had been the onslaught at Mons where the comparatively
small British force, not numbering more than two army corps altogether found
itself attacked by a hundred and sixty thousand of the foe magnificently armed
and equipped in every branch of the service, and flushed besides with what they
regarded as sure and certain victory. In addition to this, General French with
Generals Smith-Dorrien and Haig found themselves outflanked on the left by
another army corps. This discovery was followed by four days of stubborn
retreat the like of which perhaps the world has never seen. It was as if all
hell had been let loose, as if every German soldier had been not only a
fighting unit but also supported with a heavy gun of some sort. Worn out and
harassed and half dead with fatigue, the gallant British force slept when they
could, when the roar of the guns and the bursting shells allowed them. They
were so many Wellingtons praying as that great soldier prayed at Waterloo for
Blucher or night. Day by day the massed German lines four deep were thrust on
headlong and with an utter disregard for life by their own officers, only to be
mown down again and again by rifle and machine gun fire until the retreating
British were worn out by sheer slaughter.</p>
<p>But this stubborn defence was not wasted. For in it men and officers fought
side by side as if they had been brothers. For the time being all distinctions
were thrown on one side, and each fought with one single object, the honour of
the flag.</p>
<p>But it was impossible that the fight should continue at this high pressure,
and even the oncoming Germans had had nearly enough. What we lost in that
terrible conflict we know by this time; what it cost the Germans will probably
never be disclosed. Not for the first time they had been taught that attack in
mass formation can be over-costly in the face of machine guns and modern rifle
fire. Outside Liege they had left over sixty thousand of the flower of the
German army, and of the famous Bradenburg, or Iron, division only a handful of
men was left. So it came about that even against these fearful odds the British
army fought them to a standstill at the end of four days, and the Germans could
do little or nothing for the moment, though they were as four to one. It was
this precious breathing space that enabled French's men to pull themselves
together and continue the retreat, which had now become merely strategic, at
the cost of a comparatively small number of rearguard actions.</p>
<p>It was well for us that the two army corps under General French and his
lieutenants were composed of men who had learnt the art of battle in the field.
For the most part they were troops who had followed the flag to Pretoria or had
won their laurels in Indian Frontier campaigns. They were, as a matter of fact,
the only soldiers so far who had ever seen the game played in earnest. They
were disposed to resent this continuous retreat to the gates of Paris, for
tired as they were, they were still eager to be up and doing and to push the
Germans back to their original line. No one recognised this spirit better than
General French himself. He knew what he had to deal with; he had had many of
these men under him before; he went amongst them as they lay tired and weary by
the roadside and promised that their time should come later on; he mingled
freely with his troops, and he was so considerate of them that he would not
even allow them to rise to the salute. And so until September 6 it was a case
of stubbornly retiring on Paris; the same ruthless slaughter went on until
French finally called a halt, and on the night of September 6 the British army
had passed in sight of Paris and halted to the southeast of the capital, in
what looked perilously like a final stand.</p>
<p>It was a black and bitter time for the leaders of the British army. They
alone knew what the peril was, but it would have been all the same to Tommy had
he been taken into the counsel of his leaders. He had no thought of defeat or
surrender; he had cut his way through the best part of a German army corps, and
though whole regiments had been practically wiped out, the fine old spirit was
still undamped.</p>
<p>Yet certain staff officers admitted that they could see no way out of the
darkness, and that all they could hope for was a good position for a last stand
and a final opportunity for making the Germans pay as dearly as possible for
the capture of Paris.</p>
<p>But even this was not the worst. On the night of this historic September 6
Sir John French and the leaders under him lay down to sleep, only to be
awakened an hour later by a dispatch rider from the lines, who brought news
that a German force to the north had joined hands with a new army corps of
Bavarians which had appeared like a dream from somewhere to the east of the
lines. If this dread news were true, the British were cut off entirely from the
French army, and there could only be one end. Before morning the fresh
avalanche would be unloosened and the Kaiser's dream of walking over the
British army would be realised. What were the British leaders to do?</p>
<h2><a id="chap27" name="chap27">XXVII - LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS</a></h2>
<p class="first">This was the problem that faced the supreme commander of the
British Expeditionary Force and his lieutenants, Smith-Dorrien and Haig. What
they resolved upon we may know when the history of the great fight comes to be
written by those in a position to know. So far as we can tell there was no
fighting the next day, though the British were in hourly expectation of it, but
eyewitnesses say that during the morning there was a strange slackness and want
of cohesion in the German attack, and suddenly the news spread that von Kluck
had turned his front facing east and was in full retreat from Paris. This was
the welcome information that one after another of the aviators brought to
Headquarters. Then gradually it leaked out that Joffre had masked a whole army
to the east of Paris, with which, incredible as it may seem, von Kluck and his
army were almost in touch before they were even aware of its existence. It was
almost beyond credence that the German spy system should have broken down so
badly just when its information would have been of the utmost value. And thus
almost in the twinkling of an eye, the peril which had menaced the existence of
the British army resolved itself into the promise of annihilation for the
forces of von Kluck. Had he remained in ignorance of his danger for a few hours
longer a good deal of recent history would have been very different.</p>
<p>But there was no getting away from the fact that the enemy was in full
retreat all along the line, and that for the moment at any rate the menace to
France and Paris was lifted. Here was French's chance, and he took it without
the slightest hesitation. He had promised his men a fight under conditions
fairly favourable to them, and now he struck with all his might. It looked as
if the retreat from Mons was about to be followed by a big advance along the
same lines. At the same moment the French army at Paris was moving up against
von Kluck's rearguard&mdash;moved up not in the ordinary way by forced marches,
but much as the average man finds his way to a railway station. It was an army
moving in taxi-cabs and motor-cars, and moving so swiftly that within five days
the Germans were pushed back from the gates of Paris across the strong lines of
the Marne, right up to the Aisne, and from that day the reconquered plains of
France have seen nothing of them.</p>
<p>German strategy had suffered much to gratify the pride of the madman who is
responsible for plunging a whole world into a sea of blood. One of the most
useful allies our armies in the west ever had was Kaiser Wilhelm himself.</p>
<p>The western army of von Kluck that swept across France and pushed on Paris
until Uhlans that fell were buried within Paris city limits, was never intended
by the Kaiser to take Paris. This is why it lingered and why there was that
amazing slackening in the attack that General French noticed in the morning of
September 7. It was the army of the Crown Prince that was intended to march
triumphantly through the streets of Paris and accept the surrender of the
citizens. Von Kluck was to wipe out and pulverise the French and English in
front of him, and then to deploy to the left and join the Crown Prince's army
at a point somewhere between Rheims and Paris. As soon as this was done the
rest of the programme would only be a matter of time.</p>
<p>And this is just where pride had its fall. It has always been assumed, for
some reason or other, that every German leader, from the Kaiser downwards, is a
heaven-born strategist. But military genius is no exclusive privilege of
crowned heads and their offspring, and it has been made clear that the Kaiser's
heir is indebted for none to his birth; he stands revealed as a feather-headed
youth with no military capacity whatever, and since the first weeks of the war
he has never been heard of.</p>
<p>But be that as it may, there was no joining up between von Kluck and the
army of the Crown Prince. It does not follow that, from the German point of
view, von Kluck made a mistake at all. Probably he worked everything out to the
letter, probably he was outside the gates of Paris at the very moment appointed
by the Supreme Command. But something went wrong with the Crown Prince's army,
owing, possibly, to the fact that the arrogant German takes no account of what
the enemy is doing, preferring to ignore him as if he had no existence.</p>
<p>It is pretty certain too that the German General Staff entirely underrated
the power of the British army; at any rate, that is the theory entertained in
France of von Kluck's madness in ignoring or being ignorant of the fact that he
was leaving a really strong army on his flank.</p>
<p>General French realised the position. He struck at von Kluck with all his
force, and at once the whole position was changed. A few hours before the
British appeared to be in deadly peril, and Paris at the mercy of the foe. Now
the British backed up by the army of Paris, thrust rapidly forward, smashing
the foe as they went, and simultaneously the entire French line, right away
from Basle as far as Paris, using the Vosges as a pivot, moved up the whole of
its reserves and commenced a general attack. This new thrust fell heavily upon
the front of the Crown Prince's army and threatened to roll up his left flank.
There was no help for it now. Von Kluck fell back with a hastiness that almost
amounted to panic, and in three days his army was practically wiped out at any
rate for offensive purposes. In the face of this disaster it was impossible for
the Crown Prince to make any impressive show, and so in his turn he fell back
with his supporting army to the line of the Aisne.</p>
<p>The 7th September saw the beginning of the siege of Germany. It will be a
long siege yet; months will probably pass before the Kaiser's hosts are flung
back bruised and bleeding across the Rhine, and many months more before the
Russian forces have set their faces steadily in the direction of Berlin; but,
be the time long or short, the moment that French and his gallant little army
turned on von Kluck and sent him reeling back across the Aisne was the moment
in which the downfall of Germany began.</p>
<p>On September 12, only five days later, the British force had recovered all
the lost ground as far as Rheims; and there they waited and rested for the best
part of a fortnight while the French were asserting themselves and pushing back
the Crown Prince's army to the rear of Verdun. Within a week or two the long
line from Flanders to the Swiss Frontier, some four hundred miles together, was
locked securely against the Germans, and has been locked ever since. The
Germans settled down more or less permanently to defensive tactics and the
British army was free for good work elsewhere. It was on October 4 or 5 that
Sir John French's army quietly faded out of France, and settled down in
Flanders.</p>
<h2><a id="chap28" name="chap28">XXVIII - BACK TO THE FRONT</a></h2>
<p class="first">It was about this same time that Ginger and his friends said
good-bye to the Keep House and went back to what was left of their regiment.
The British force had now begun to move secretly up to the north, having
exchanged trenches with the French higher up the line in the neighbourhood of
La Bassee. On the whole they were not sorry to move, for this was their first
relief from almost continuous fighting for the best part of two months. It was
a masterly move, carried out so perfectly under the direction of Major-General
Robertson that the Germans had no idea of what was taking place until the first
of their prisoners began to fall into our hands. A Bavarian captain picked up
wounded near La Bassee could hardly believe his eyes.</p>
<p>"I cannot understand it," he said. "We were under the impression that we
were fighting French Territorials. Not a soul of us but what thought the
British were quite thirty miles away. It is a miracle."</p>
<p>But so far the British had done their work, and when things slackened
halfway along the line it began to dawn upon the German General Staff that the
Great Adventure had failed. The Kaiser and his associates had started out on
August 4 with a cut-and-dried time-table that was the result of something like
forty years' scheming and planning. Year in and year out it had been cut and
polished and studied till its authors could see no flaw in it anywhere. To
accomplish it, strategic railways had been built not only in Germany but with
German capital in Belgium as well. At various points depots had been
established for the mobilisation of troops and rapid movement of immense stores
both of food and artillery. When Germany launched her thunderbolt on August 4
it seemed to her leaders that nothing had been forgotten.</p>
<p>They knew perfectly well that France was not ready, that Great Britain had
been lulled into a sense of false security, and that Russia was wholly
unsuspicious. It did not look a very difficult matter, therefore, to keep to
the time-table. One after the other the frontier fortresses were to be overrun,
and within the month Paris would be at the feet of the foe. After that a speedy
peace with the French would be concluded, and then a rapid series of crushing
blows on the eastern frontier would serve to convince Russia of the
hopelessness of invasion.</p>
<p>It was a splendid scheme, on paper, but it entirely failed to make provision
for what the other fellow might do. It failed to take into account the entry of
Britain into the war; it failed to anticipate that wonderful mobilisation of
the British navy which drove the German fleet back to the Kiel Canal where,
with the exception of a swaggering flourish or two, always ending in disaster,
it has remained ever since; it failed to take into account the misunderstanding
which kept von Kluck's and the Crown Prince's armies apart; it failed to
forecast the movements of the great force that Joffre had gathered together
behind Paris; and, worse than all, it failed to take into account the amazing
stubbornness and stupendous fighting qualities of the British army. Never in
the history of the nation has the British soldier given such an account of
himself as he did during the retreat from Mons and the subsequent advance that
threw the foe headlong back across the Marne.</p>
<p>In that moment the Great Adventure was broken.</p>
<p>Just for the moment the British work was done. But the qualities of French's
men had been duly appreciated by our allies; their patience and stubbornness
was an asset beyond price, and it was to them that Joffre looked to hold back
the great War Cloud that threatened to burst in the north. For by this time von
Kluck had recovered from the lightning thrust that had pushed him and his
supporters back to the Aisne. He had made up his losses and filled up his gaps,
and by the middle of October was a power to be reckoned with. It was apparent
that the Germans had given up thought of forcing their way to Paris by way of
Rheims and Verdun, but there was still a wide path open to them north of La
Bassee, and it was 'up to' the Kaiser to show his people that the fall of Paris
was a secondary consideration for the moment, and that the first one was an
irresistible advance through Belgium via Dunkirk to Calais. The German public,
therefore, were fed with amazing tales of an invasion of England from the north
French coast, and the date when the Prussians would march through London was
published in the Berlin papers.</p>
<p>The danger was a real one, moreover, for between La Bassee and the sea, for
a distance of over fifty miles, the road lay actually open to Calais. There was
nothing between the German hosts and the great invasion but the comparatively
small force of the gallant Belgians. It was only the fact that Antwerp had not
fallen that restrained the German onslaught. So far as the foe could see, the
road was an open and an easy one. And to add to the difficulties of the allies,
on October 8 Antwerp fell so suddenly and unexpectedly that a division of
British troops commanded by General Rawlinson, and sent to aid the Belgians in
defending the outer forts, could not arrive until the Germans were in a
position to build in their huge siege guns and thus render the defence of the
forts a military impossibility. All that General Rawlinson could do was to join
up with what was left of the Belgian army and retreat with them along the coast
beyond Zeebrugge and Ostend. It was here that the Belgians took up their final
position on the Yser, which they have defended ever since with a gallantry and
tenacity beyond all praise. Then General Rawlinson joined forces with them on
their right, and cautiously felt his way along the left as far as Ypres.</p>
<p>And here it was that Ginger and the rest came once more in contact with
their old companions. They came up in the pouring rain into the wet and muddy
trenches, knee deep or more in water, and there they were destined to remain
for many weary months, making history as remarkable in its way as the history
they made on the banks of the Marne. It was as if they had encamped in the
tributary of some small river. A sea of mud was everywhere, a blank and gloomy
outlook, but drab as it was, nothing could repress the spirits of the British
soldier.</p>
<p>"I suppose this is wot you call 'ome sweet 'ome?" Ginger said as he and his
companions waded into the filth and surveyed their comrades wet and muddy and
grimy beyond description. "Bit of a change, boys, ain't it? I'd like to know
'ow long this gime's likely to go on."</p>
<p>A little while later Kemp and Bentley appeared.</p>
<p>"So you're all back again," Bentley said. "Well, we can do with you still.
So far as I can understand, we shall not be allowed to go to sleep here. They
seem to think that the Germans are going to try and force their way through
along this route to Paris, taking Calais by the way. You look as if you'd had a
good time over there in England."</p>
<p>"Good time ain't no word for it," Ginger said. "We was treated as if we'd
been so many princes. You don't know how good those young lidies was to us. But
we're not sorry to get back again, an' that's a fact."</p>
<p>"We can do with every man," Kemp said. "It isn't always as dull as this, as
you will find before long."</p>
<h2><a id="chap29" name="chap29">XXIX - STICKING IT</a></h2>
<p class="first">The danger was even greater than the troops in the trenches
anticipated, for this time the Germans were not hurrying matters. They had
learnt a lesson from the wild dash on Paris, and had gained a wholesome respect
for the striking power of the British army. But they had the men ready, which
in those early days could not have been said of either the English or French,
and it was only a matter of collecting them together, sufficiently supported
with the requisite artillery and, cavalry, though so far the latter arm of the
German service had not played a brilliant part in the campaign.</p>
<p>It was the French who gave their Allies the first intimation of the great
coming strife and incidentally conveyed to Paris and London certain news that
sent a chill down the spine of the authorities.</p>
<p>About the middle of October the French official communique reported that
dense masses of cavalry had appeared on the Tourcoing-Armentieres road,
screening an important new force of the enemy. The news was ominous, though so
far it had not been confirmed by the French and British airmen. But there was
no question as to its truth, and before long Sir John French realised that he
was up against a force quite six times his own strength. Then the foe began to
put pressure on the British trenches, keeping up the attack night and day until
gradually the British were forced to take new ground. For two nights and the
best part of three days the Musketeers held on as doggedly to that muddy ditch
as if they loved every inch of it; they fought on, short of ammunition and
practically without food, till very reluctantly the order was given to retire,
and what was left of the regiment found themselves not far from Ypres in the
ruins of a farmhouse.</p>
<p>It was dry here at any rate, with straw to lie on, and for the first time
for many hours the men tasted food. But that they could remain there they did
not believe for a moment. At dark they were rushed again, but through the night
they clung tenaciously to their cover, aided by half a dozen machine guns which
Bentley had brought up at a great risk to himself; by means of these they
forced the Germans back, and when the raw daylight came they were still in
possession of the farmhouse.</p>
<p>Every man had distinguished himself in some way or other; every man had done
his best, and the casualties had been very few. Not once had the Germans got
inside the outer walls, and hundreds of their dead lay on the field.</p>
<p>"Blimme, but those Bavarians are 'ot stuff," Ginger said, as he threw
himself down exhausted on a heap of straw. "I used to 'ave an idea as one
Englishman was worth ten Germans, but I've got to change me mind. I suppose
it's no use 'opin' to get a bit o' breakfast. It seems abaht a week since I 'ad
any food. An' you never know when you're well off. I was fairly fed up with
that trench of ours, but we did manage to get our grub fairly regular
there."</p>
<p>"You be thankful as you're alive, Ginger," George said. "Don't always be
thingin' abaht your inside."</p>
<p>"I don't see as there's any 'arm in thinkin' abaht it," Ginger said. "An'
thinkin' don't keep you from 'avin' your breakfast. Anybody got a fag?"</p>
<p>But apparently not a man amongst them had so much as a cigarette. They were
cut off from the rest there, and as far as they knew were in touch with no
other regiment. At any moment the attack might break out again and, tired and
worn out as they were, they would have to fight for their lives without the
slightest chance of support from outside. They were ravenously hungry, too, and
unless they had food of some kind, would be almost unable to meet a further
attack.</p>
<p>Something as near kin to despair as a British soldier ever permits himself
to feel was beginning to settle down upon them when from outside came the sound
of feet and the old barn was filled with reinforcements. They had forced their
way through the German trench on the right, taking many prisoners, and now they
had swung round the ruins with a battery or two of machine guns, for the
Musketeers had fallen back to a point of vantage and this the reinforcements
had been told to hold at all costs. A cheer greeted their appearance.</p>
<p>"They're our old friends the 55th Fusiliers," Ginger cried. "The same chaps
as fought alongside us that night when we turned back from Mons. I wonder if
they've brought anything with 'em."</p>
<p>"How are you lads off for food?" a subaltern asked.</p>
<p>"Search us, sir," Ginger said. "We've almost forgotten wot it's like. We
ain't seen any for three days."</p>
<p>But there was no further trouble as far as food was concerned. The
communications were opened up again, and down there on the straw the Musketeers
ate to their hearts' content. There was enough and to spare even for the sullen
little group of prisoners who, with a couple of scowling officers, lay in a
corner of the barn. And then some one more richly endowed than the rest
produced a case which he proceeded to tear open and disclosed a box of
cigarettes. In a moment all thought of hardship and fatigue was forgotten.
Ginger and the rest of them sat there as if there was no such thing as a German
within a hundred miles. For all this was in a day's work, mere incidents hardly
worth comment.</p>
<p>A moment or two later a dilapidated figure emerged from the little knot of
German prisoners and approached half a dozen Musketeers who were lying smoking
on the straw. He bore a familiar air to Bentley and Kemp, but they failed to
recognise him until he spoke.</p>
<p>"Would you mind giving me a cigarette?" he said. "And it wouldn't be a bad
thing if you passed a few over to those chaps in the corner. You see they
regard me as one of themselves, and though that officer with the cut on his
head declined any suggestion that I should come here cadging tobacco on his
behalf, he made no objection. The others can smoke your tobacco if they like,
but they were pretty sure that you chaps wouldn't give them any."</p>
<p>"They're wrong there," Kemp replied. "Because they don't play the game
that's no reason why we shouldn't. It's a funny little world, and I am pretty
sure I have seen that sullen-looking German before. Go and ask him if his name
isn't Echmann, and if he didn't meet a man named Kemp in the semi-final of the
gentlemen's singles at Bournemouth tennis tournament last year. I'm quite sure
it's the same man. But tell me, Venables, how the dickens did you manage to get
here?"</p>
<p>"I am supposed to be attached to the German force on behalf of my paper,"
Venables replied, for he it was. "I hope those chaps can't hear me; most of
them speak English as well as I do. If you'll send one of your men over with
some cigarettes they won't be so suspicious. They can't very well object to my
talking to you, seeing that I'm a neutral and nothing more dangerous than a war
correspondent."</p>
<p>"Rather a dangerous game you're playing," Bentley suggested.</p>
<p>"Well, perhaps it is. But they can't prevent me having my private views, all
the same. As a matter of fact, I allowed myself to be taken prisoner. But
please don't ask me any questions, because I'm afraid I can't answer them. I
want you if you can to get me a few words with your brigadier and forget
afterwards that you've ever met me before."</p>
<p>"All right," Bentley said. "Just one moment. Are the Germans in any great
force here?"</p>
<p>"They are," Venables replied. "There can't be less than six hundred thousand
of them altogether."</p>
<h2><a id="chap30" name="chap30">XXX - A MYSTERY</a></h2>
<p class="first">Bentley and Kemp listened gravely. There was something
staggering in the information that Venables had given them. It seemed almost
incredible that Germany could have amassed all those troops on so narrow a
front without the Allies being aware of the fact. And if what Venables said was
true, what was the maximum of the foe's forces in France? And how would it be
possible to prevent a headlong dash north of Ypres straight along the road to
Calais? At most the British could only muster a hundred thousand men,
supplemented by the weary Belgians and a few regiments of French territorials.
If this was substantially correct, Calais was doomed. Stubborn and resolute as
the English were, they could never hold back such a force, equipped as it was
with an overwhelming amount of artillery. As the two friends looked at one
another each read the thought that was passing through the other's mind.</p>
<p>"If what you say is correct," Bentley remarked, "that Mons business is going
to be a mere picnic in comparison with what we are up against now."</p>
<p>"I don't quite agree with you," Venables replied. "I believe you fellows
will be able to do it. I flatter myself I know a good deal about English
military history and I was all through the Boer War, on both sides of the
fighting line. You are bound to admit that the Boers were splendid fighters,
and they taught you a lesson there which a good many strategists in Europe seem
to have forgotten. I was at Modder River where the Boers, not more than ten
thousand strong, held General Methuen's men many times stronger than themselves
for nearly ten months, simply because they could shoot. It was almost
impossible in the Boer campaign to force strong positions at the point of the
bayonet, when they were held by resolute men. And that is why I feel pretty
sure that your handful of British will be able to hold the Germans now that the
line is locked as far as the sea. It will cost you more than half your force,
but all the same it will be done, and once more Kaiser Wilhelm will be
disappointed. I happen to know that he looks upon the thing as a dead
certainty, though he pays you the compliment of believing that it will take him
a fortnight; at the end of which time he is coming here with all his big bugs
to goose step his forces into Calais. I happen to know this because a few days
ago the Kaiser told me so himself."</p>
<p>"He told you?" Kemp exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Why, certainly," Venables said coolly. "He invited half a dozen of us to
lunch with him. To hear him talk anybody would think it was all over except the
shouting. And he firmly believes it, too. Oh, the man is mad beyond the shadow
of a doubt. He spoke of the Russians as if they didn't exist. But we will go
into all this later on if we get a chance. The point is that I want to see your
brigadier at once, because there are certain things that he must convey to
Headquarters. And I shall be glad afterwards if you two will kindly forget that
you have ever heard the name of Venables before."</p>
<p>"Don't you think in the meantime you had better go back to those chaps over
yonder?" Bentley suggested. "I mean, hadn't we better let them know that we
regard you more or less as a prisoner? Then, when the rest of them have gone
back under escort, you can remain here till we find the colonel."</p>
<p>This suggestion seemed to commend itself to Venables and a little later,
after the German prisoners had gone, he was brought back, and Bentley went and
searched for the colonel.</p>
<p>Lord Hailsham listened with knitted brows to what Bentley had to say.
Clearly he was puzzled.</p>
<p>"Is the fellow a German spy or what?" he asked.</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact he is not a German at all," Bentley explained. "As a
question of nationality he's a pure American and beyond doubt a representative
of an American newspaper. You know, sir, that Germany can't do too much for
America just now, and they are making no end of a fuss of the New York
correspondents. Venables says that he was lunching with the Kaiser a day or two
ago and that there are six hundred thousand men opposite us."</p>
<p>The colonel looked exceedingly grave.</p>
<p>"I knew it was bad," he said; "but I didn't know it was as bad as all that.
Now, you've been talking to this American. How does he strike you? Do you think
he is a German spy, or do you suppose that he is anxious to give us all the
information in his power? Do you happen to know anything about him? Somehow his
name seems to be familiar to me."</p>
<p>"It would be, sir," Bentley replied. "It isn't for me to say whether
Venables is playing some deep game or not, but if it had not been for him we
should have never got away in that retreat. It was Venables who appeared out of
nowhere and told us where those lost guns of ours were hidden. You will
remember he took us to the spot where the guns were concealed and helped us to
recover them and the ammunition. I am talking of the time when we bayoneted all
those chaps in the farmhouse and got back with the guns to our trenches. In
fact, Venables saved the whole situation."</p>
<p>"And what happened to him afterwards?" the colonel asked.</p>
<p>"He vanished, sir; went back to the German lines, I think. Oh, I forgot to
tell you that he is a friend of Kemp's. He was a guest of his before the war,
and I believe he and Kemp played a good deal of golf together. But if you'll
excuse me, sir, it isn't for me to say anything about it. Venables is very
anxious to see the brigadier, though he won't say a word as to the reason why.
Won't you see him, sir?"</p>
<p>"Of course I will," the colonel replied. "I'll come at once. Lead the
way."</p>
<p>Colonel Lord Hailsham failed to learn anything fresh. Venables was perfectly
polite, but apparently there was only one thing he wanted, and that was to see
the brigadier without delay. A moment or two later he vanished, and then for
the first time the handful of Musketeers were in a position to take stock of
their position and see exactly how they stood.</p>
<p>For the moment, at any rate, they were safe behind stone walls and all right
so long as the German artillery was not trained upon them. In front of them lay
sixty or seventy yards of flat open ground, and beyond that a gentle slope upon
which stood a heavy stone building which at some time or other had formed part
of an old castle. In front of this was a German trench circling round the ruin,
and in advance of this ran a small stream or rather an elbow of one of the
canals; if the Germans brought up machine guns there the position of the
Musketeers in their barn would not be tenable for many minutes. Together with
their reinforcements they were about five hundred strong, but this number would
not be nearly sufficient to hold the position in case of a determined
attack.</p>
<p>It was getting late in the afternoon now and the Germans had slackened fire.
Whether they would continue to hold themselves back or whether they would wait
till dark before they moved farther was a question that the commander of the
Musketeers would have given a good deal to be able to answer. His impulse was
to make an immediate and vigorous onslaught on the German trench and capture
the ruins of the castle, a plan which, at any rate for the moment, would have
got rid of an awkward bend in the British Front.</p>
<p>But was it worth the risk? Lord Hailsham asked himself this question over
and over again. What was the strength of the Germans holding the trench? And
were there strong reserves lying in waiting on the other side of the old castle
under the brow of the hill? And how were they off for machine guns? Darkness
found the colonel still in two moods.</p>
<h2><a id="chap31" name="chap31">XXXI - TO THE RESCUE</a></h2>
<p class="first">The more the colonel of the Musketeers debated the matter, the
more anxious he was to get something done. He knew only too well that he could
expect nothing in the way of further reinforcements, and it would be useless to
ask for further machine guns. Moreover, in case of an attack, the Musketeers
might be overwhelmed before they could fall back on their supports. If, on the
other hand, they could force the Germans out of that snug little position and
take possession of the ruin, protected as it was on the far side by the elbow
of the canal, it would be possible to hold it against all comers. It was only a
small matter by comparison, but one of those small matters that, successfully
attained, cover a regiment with glory and frequently have an important bearing
on the big engagement.</p>
<p>It was about eight in the evening when the colonel called his officers about
him and disclosed his scheme.</p>
<p>"We must push those chaps back," he said. "We are far too close to them to
be pleasant. You see, they are in a position to bring up strong reserves from
the other side of the hill without our being able to see them, and if they
attack us in the night in anything like force they might cut us to pieces. On
the other hand, it is quite useless for us to attack them until we know how
strong they are. Now, I want a few of you to volunteer to creep forward and if
possible get into the trench opposite. Those fellows haven't had time yet to
get up their barbed wire entanglements, and with a bit of luck we might be able
to spring a little surprise upon them."</p>
<p>"Might I be allowed to make a remark?" Kemp asked, when the suggestion was
being generally discussed. "You see, sir, we all realise the danger and we are
all anxious to do something. A little time ago an old Belgian peasant blundered
in as if he had dropped from the skies. None of the sentries seemed to know a
bit about where he came from, or how he managed to get here without being
spotted. So a Frenchman who happens to be with us asked him a few questions,
and the old man showed us how he managed it. You see, sir, in a very dry time
they can flood the low-lying land here, and it appears that a few yards away
there is a covered culvert running from right under our feet past the spot
where the German trenches are and round to the canal where there is a
floodgate, of which the Germans know nothing. If we could get to the floodgate,
we could blow it up, and by to-morrow morning there would be thirty or forty
yards of deep water between here and the German trenches. But we don't want
that just yet, and still less do the Germans. That culvert is quite dry now,
and there is a trap leading into it only a few yards away. I suggest that a
dozen or two of us should crawl along the culvert as far as the German
trenches, and perhaps a little beyond them, and come up one of the surface
drains; we can easily manage it, as the old man I speak of promised to show us
the way. Then we shall be able to look down into the trench and see how strong
the Germans are. There is no danger in it at all."</p>
<p>"It sounds all right," the colonel said. "At any rate, it can do no harm to
have a try. Take a score of men and see what you can do. And if you happen to
have any good luck, give us a call and we will follow you."</p>
<p>Immediately the scheme was mooted there was no lack of volunteers. It all
sounded easy enough, but when the top of the culvert was removed there was
nothing inviting about the black hole that was disclosed. It was only possible
to move in single file on hands and knees along the stuffy tube where the air
was not too fresh. In front went the pioneer, who made little or nothing of it,
for doubtless it had been his business many times to go down there to see that
the waterway was clear. The air was foul and stifling, but it was possible to
breathe, and so they crept on yard after yard on a journey that seemed to have
no end, though it was only the matter of a bowshot altogether. At the end of
what seemed to have been an hour the old Belgian rose from his knees and
lighted a match. Just where he was standing the roof of the culvert lifted
sufficiently for anybody to stand upright, and very cautiously he proceeded to
try to lift what appeared to be a wooden trap covered in overhead with earth
and grass. But this was more than the old man's strength was capable of, and
Ginger, who was close behind, offered his services.</p>
<p>"'Ere, let me 'ave a go," he said. "I ain't afraid of doin' my bit in the
daylight, but this 'ere mole business brings the sweat out on me something
crool. I don't mind bein' shot, but I abjects to bein' stifled."</p>
<p>The old man made some inarticulate sound and a gesture with his hands, which
Kemp, who was following close behind, rightly interpreted as an indication that
caution was needed. It would never do to force that wooden trap open in the
careless way that Ginger had suggested, for they had to consider the chance of
finding themselves confronted by German sentries.</p>
<p>"Not quite so fast, Ginger," Kemp suggested. "It would be a pity to spoil
the whole thing now. Just a bit at a time, my lad. And no noise, if you can
help it."</p>
<p>Very gradually, the wooden cover began to give way, until at length it was
pushed aside and a sweet cool breath of air came down, infinitely refreshing to
lungs that were beginning to pump heavily in that stagnant atmosphere. Then the
little knot of men listened eagerly for any sign of the foe. The old Belgian
smiled and nodded and said something in indifferent French that it was not easy
to understand. By dint of asking him several questions it became plain that
they were beyond the German trenches on the far slope of the hill, and this was
the reason probably why there was no sign of a sentry to be seen. One by one,
as quiet as mice, they crept out into the open and crawled up the slope till
they came to the parapet of the trench. They were behind the Germans, who were
expecting no danger from that quarter. Here and there lights were visible,
strong clear lights below the line of the trench, glowing so strongly that for
a moment the little knot of Musketeers were fairly puzzled. They crept on inch
by inch with absolute caution until the leaders could look down into the trench
itself. In the foreground lay Ginger together with his friends, closely
followed by Kemp and Bentley, and the rest.</p>
<p>It was a strange thing that lay before them, the like of which they had
never looked on before. So far a British soldier had never seen a trench like
this one. It was lined with concrete and protected on the side nearest to the
British lines by a perfect network of wire entanglements, and at intervals
along it electric lights gleamed from an insulated cable. The floor was covered
with boards, under which the water could be heard trickling. Here and there
were ingenious little dug-outs, presumably intended for officers, each fitted
with its own light, and each boasting a camp bedstead with a table and chair.
In one of these four subalterns were playing bridge, and Kemp could see the
hand of dummy laid on the table, so far as he could judge, the man whose back
was to him had just gone no trumps on a splendid hand. The whole thing was so
simple and homelike and so far remote from all struggle and strife that Kemp
could hardly restrain a smile.</p>
<p>But they were not there to see what the German would make of his hand, they
were here on stern business, nothing less than the capture of the trench. From
where Kemp lay he could command the whole length of it, and he thrilled when he
realised that it did not contain more than fifty Germans altogether.</p>
<p>"We've got them in the hollow of our hands," he said. "We can do it on our
heads if we rush it."</p>
<h2><a id="chap32" name="chap32">XXXII - "SAVOY HOTEL"</a></h2>
<p class="first">Just for a moment Bentley and Kemp and the rest of them had
forgotten the fact that they were so many units in the great struggle. For here
they had blundered upon an adventure after the heart of them all. There was a
touch of sport in it, with just enough risk to render the incident exciting.
Despite all they had gone through, and all they knew that lay before them, it
was impossible to quench in them the spirit of British light-heartedness and
contempt for danger which has always been the mainspring of British pugnacity.
For here was a gigantic spree, an unexpected lark that gladdened the heart of
them all and relieved the monotony of the deadly trench work. It is this
amazing light-heartedness which has made the British Empire what it is, though
historians would have us believe that the driving power behind it all is
something deeper and still more sacred.</p>
<p>But that is not the spirit in which the British Tommy has approached his
work in the field. Whatever he may feel deep down in his heart, he never shows
his feelings; he is ready to die for his country, but he must do it in his own
way and after his own fashion, with a jest on his lips and a cigarette in his
mouth. Probably it was much the same in the old days of the bowmen at Agincourt
and Cressy and Poitiers.</p>
<p>And that is how the Musketeers felt as they lay there on the edge of the
trench looking down into the luxurious quarters which the Germans had built for
themselves. It would have been an easy matter to slide over the shoulder of the
trench and take those men prisoners before they could realise what had
happened. At any rate, that would have been Ginger's way, and the way of most
of them who lurked behind him. But there were cool heads guiding the
expedition, and there was much to be done before they took possession of what
Ginger compared in his mind to the lounge of the Savoy Hotel. He had been there
on more than one occasion, selling his papers or calling taxis on a wet night,
and it seemed to him that here was a chance to share the luxuries of such a
place himself.</p>
<p>"Did ye ever see anything like it?" he whispered to his next-door neighbour.
"Fancy them sausage eaters livin' in a plice like this! Look at that chap over
there with the big pipe in his mouth; it's odd to me if I ain't seen 'im before
somewhere. They tells me as lots of these chaps 'ere lived in London before the
war. Come to think of it, I've carried clubs for several Germans in my time,
great fat chaps as treats you like dogs an' never thinks o' givin' you a tip.
Yus, I knew as that chap's fice was familiar. 'E used to come down to Richmond
on Saturday an' Sunday with another bloke about the sime size. I forget 'is
nime for a moment, but 'e weren't popular. 'E'd got a golf bag about as big as
a 'ouse an' when you 'adn't 'ad nothin' to eat for a couple o' days before it
was as bad as draggin' a big gun abaht. But wot are we wastin' time like this
for? Why don't they give us the word to drop in an' join the supper party?"</p>
<p>But the lieutenant in command was in no hurry to move. He knew there was a
good deal to be done yet. It would have been no difficult matter to rush the
trench and take the handful of Germans by surprise, but there was always the
chance that there were others of the foe hidden in those masses of old ruin,
and it was necessary to explore them before anything else was done. A minute or
two later a little knot of Englishmen worked their way slowly and cautiously
back in the direction of the ruin, leaving Ginger and half a dozen of the rest
to keep watch on the edge of the trench in case there was anything in the
nature of an alarm. There was another thing to be guarded against, too. If the
foe on the far side of the canal threw up any of their starlights it was long
odds that the presence of the British would be discovered. One by one they
crept round the ruin and entered it cautiously. Apparently no one was there,
and nothing was discovered with the exception of a few machine guns which had
been stored there in preparation for an attack. Evidently the attack was to
take place soon, for the level ground beyond the arm of the canal was connected
with the castle by two or three pontoons which had been laid down quite
recently. Before anything else could be done, these would have to be cut away
and sent adrift down the sluggish stream. Without any tools at hand for the
purpose this was a slow business, but it was accomplished at length, and then
the little force turned back in the direction of the German trench. They held
on the edge of it for a moment or two before the lieutenant in command gave the
word, and then they dropped down amongst the astonished Germans as if they had
fallen from the sky. There was practically no fight; the foe was taken at too
great a disadvantage for that. At the first volley they came swarming out of
their dug-outs and along the line of trench, and threw up their hands. One or
two managed to scramble over the parapet and disappear in the darkness in the
direction of the canal, but there was no escape that way, and they were rounded
up before it was possible to give the alarm.</p>
<p>"You had better come quietly," the lieutenant in command said as he looked
into the snug dug-out where the four German officers had been enjoying their
game of bridge.</p>
<p>There was no help for it, so they surrendered at discretion. The fat German
who had been pointed out by Ginger stared about him in undisguised
amazement.</p>
<p>"How did you get here?" he asked in excellent English.</p>
<p>"We walked," Ginger said. "We came in by the back door by way of
Constantinople. I suppose you don't remember me, old man. It don't seem very
long ago since you an' me was playin' golf together at Richmond. At least, you
was supposed to play, and I used to lug that old iron monger's shop o' yours
about. D'you recollect it?"</p>
<p>"Ach," the German said. "You are the caddie we used to call Ginger. Those
was happy days, and I wish they was back again. There are three or four of us
here who used to live in London, and I wish we were there once more."</p>
<p>"Don't you worry about that, old man," Ginger said. "You will be back again
soon enough. I suppose, like the rest of them, you left the missus and kids
behind you. But you ain't goin' back to that little plice of your'n in Park
Line, an' you ain't goin' to ride about in that big car o' your'n any more. Not
as I ain't sayin' as you're pretty snug in these 'ere quarters. Fancy you chaps
livin' in all this luxury while we freeborn Britons 'as got to fight up to our
waists in water! It was wery good o' you to tike all this trouble on our
account, an' now we're in this 'ere fust class 'otel we'll stick to it. Nothin'
like a change of air an' scenery."</p>
<p>By this time most of the Germans had been rounded up and word had been sent
to the British trench to the effect that the night's adventure had been crowned
with success. The rest of the battalion came swarming across the open ground to
take possession of their new quarters, which had been gained without the loss
of a single life so far. There was everything here that was needful, including
an ample supply of cigars and cigarettes and wine.</p>
<p>"I think we shall be comfortable here," Kemp smiled. "And once we have
settled down we shall take a good deal of moving. I've always heard the Germans
were pretty thorough, but this knocks spots off anything we have found so far.
We shall be quite happy here for a bit."</p>
<p>They did not know it yet, but many weary days were to pass before the
Musketeers found themselves on the other side of that canal, and much was to
happen before then.</p>
<h2><a id="chap33" name="chap33">XXXIII - A STAGGERING TASK</a></h2>
<p class="first">The mysterious Venables had spoken no more than the truth when
he had declared that the Germans had massed six hundred thousand men in the
neighbourhood of La Bassee and Ypres. Probably General French had some shrewd
idea of this fact; certainly he did not underrate the magnitude of the task
that lay before him. He knew, too, that for the moment, at any rate, he could
expect little or nothing in the way of reinforcements from England, so that in
the coming strife he would have to make the best of the little force that had
stood him in such good stead during the last two months. The big outflanking
movement was still going on, a movement by which the French were compelled to
retire the left of their line, abandoning Lille and concentrating on La Bassee,
which town itself was already practically in German hands. But it might be
possible to hold the heights behind La Bassee a little longer, and here the
French had made a stand and dug themselves in.</p>
<p>All this time the gap between La Bassee and the sea was open to the enemy,
and the allies were hard put to it to keep them back here. It was managed for a
few days by dragging out the Belgian line until it began to wear dangerously
thin like a piece of over-stretched elastic. Here, too, were French
Territorials, mostly men over forty, doing their best and fighting to the
breaking point.</p>
<p>And this breaking point was very near when in the middle of October the
pioneer regiments of the British main force detrained near St. Omar. It was a
great task that lay before them. Theoretically, it was their duty to throw lack
the advanced German forces along a given line and at the same time keep not
only in touch with the French at La Bassee, but establish communications with
the Belgians on the east and Rawlinson's division in the west. This operation,
almost impossible in the face of overwhelming odds, was assigned to General
Smith-Dorrien, in command of the second Army Corps, who lost no time in forcing
action before La Bassee. But from the very first any chance of a successful
attempt at the offensive was impossible. By the end of the following week the
British army was fighting a desultory scrambling engagement focussed on Ypres,
while at that time the Belgian army, partly re-organised and rested, was
engaged in holding the Yser at a point on the line against the sea. Over and
over again here the bridge-head of the Yser had been lost and won, and lost and
won again until it became necessary to adopt a desperate experiment which
practically meant the sacrifice of the last few yards of Belgian soil. The
dykes were cut and the country flooded, and for the first time the road to
Calais was secure. Nature had done what man had failed to do.</p>
<p>Each day, until somewhere about the last week of October, things were
getting more and more critical. At this time the main force under Sir John
French extended for some twenty-odd miles from before La Bassee to a point
north of Ypres, and each day it became more and more difficult to hold the
Germans back. Both French and English were so exhausted that they could not
keep up a successful driving movement. But, on the other hand, the line was
established. And, moreover, it was a direct and straight line, terribly
insecure perhaps, but reaching out far enough to touch that of the French and
Belgians on either side. And all this time more and more Germans were being
rushed across Belgium, with the one object of smashing through that line and
carrying everything before them in their headlong push for Calais.</p>
<p>And still French carried on, still the English held on with teeth and nails,
waiting and waiting for the reinforcements which never seemed to come. And then
one day when hope was abandoned and nothing but an ignominious retreat
threatened along the whole line, there came over the ridge towards the trenches
a solitary figure cloaked and turbaned, and looking strangely out of place on
the western field. And beyond him came the turbans of the Sikhs and their
cavalry, and up from the trenches went a mighty cheer in which the pent-up
emotion of weeks gave itself expression. It was a sorely needed relief, but
great as it was, it was no more than a drop in the great ocean of General
French's requirements.</p>
<p>So far the first British Army Corps had not come into action. While the
second and third Army Corps had been struggling through the big advance, the
first Corps under General Haig was still making its way to the appointed place
from its original position north of Rheims. It was ready now, and its presence
obliged Sir John French to ask himself a question which might possibly have a
vital influence on the autumn campaign. This was whether or not he should use
the first Army Corps to reinforce the second and third, and thereby consolidate
the ground already won.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the second and third army were really carrying out that
which all military authorities had declared to be impossible. What would Sir
John French do? The decision lay entirely in his hands, and for the moment he
decided to let the second and third corps go on doing the impossible. He sent
the first corps to the lines about Ypres, and there they settled down to a
dogged fight which went a long way to produce the result which
meant&mdash;though it was not apparent for the moment&mdash;that all the might
and strength of the German armies was not sufficient to cut its way through
that thin line down to the coast which the Kaiser coveted so much, and on the
possession of which he had built some of his fondest hopes. Day by day and hour
by hour the Kaiser flung his masses on the British lines&mdash;flung them
forward in close formation and with utter recklessness of human life which will
stamp him for ever as the most callous-hearted general who ever regarded his
fellow-countrymen as mere pawns on the chess-board of his ambition.</p>
<p>Day by day the attack was renewed, first on one part of the line and then on
another. Here ground was gained and here ground was lost, but nothing seemed to
make any impression on the British trenches, and then the Kaiser came down in
person to see the great thing done.</p>
<p>Superhuman efforts were about to be made. Each hour brought worse news to
General Haig, culminating in information brought in the raw dawn of an early
December day by an aviator who came down in the British lines with the wings of
his plane riddled with shrapnel, and reported that he had seen three fresh
German corps advancing against General Haig's front. He had seen the roads and
rail ways thick with men; he had seen fresh batteries working into position and
close behind them huge masses of men advancing to the fray in review order and
singing their patriotic songs under the eyes of the Kaiser himself. A little
later on the news was confirmed, and fresh intelligence arrived to the effect
that one of these mass attacks of German infantry had broken through the first
division near Ypres, and that the French support was retiring. It was on this
day that the Royal Scotch Fusiliers were cut off root and branch. It was on
this day, too, that the Germans, in a fresh artillery position were actually
shelling General Haig's headquarters, and a shell had burst in the house
itself. It was well that General Haig was outside at the time, for practically
every staff officer on the spot was killed or wounded.</p>
<p>This was the position then on the first of November, and there was no man
there from General French downwards would have dared to prophesy what the
morrow would bring forth. And General French's task was only beginning.</p>
<h2><a id="chap34" name="chap34">XXXIV - THE DEADLY GRIP</a></h2>
<p class="first">The first Army Corps was in deadly peril. It was impossible
for French to send any reinforcements, or do anything except encourage them by
his personal example. All that day he exposed himself to peril as freely as if
he had been the humblest recruit in any ordinary line regiment. He used his
motor freely that day, and rushed up to the line of the first division; as a
matter of fact, it was no great journey that lay before him, for the line had
retired for a distance of more than four miles. He could see quite plainly from
where he stood that his men were locked in a deadly grip with the German
infantry, who were attacking everywhere in enormous forces, and practically
unled. In the literal sense of the word it was a soldier's fight on both sides.
The English were struggling valiantly in every direction, hitting a head or
bayoneting a body wherever it presented itself. And there was not an atom of
method in all this either. Apparently there was no attempt at leadership in
this scrimmage where every man was doing his utmost and officers and men,
infantry and cavalry, were fighting side by side, and officers' servants were
loading spare rifles and handing them on until they were too hot to fire any
longer.</p>
<p>The Musketeers were in the thick of it. There were moments when their
trenches were rushed and they fought at short arm-grips, hurling the foe back
with machine gun and bayonet, for even here, guarded though they were by the
flood, they were not safe. Heedless of the danger, a German infantry regiment
had plunged into the water up to their armpits, and were making their way
across. It was a hideous and unnecessary slaughter but still they came on in
dense masses, utterly indifferent to the fire that mowed them down, until the
Musketeers were weary of throwing them back from the trenches.</p>
<p>About this time it became generally known that General French himself was
behind on foot and in the very thick of it. He gave his orders as calmly as if
on parade. Even in the midst of this deadly peril he began to see that victory
was possible. Presently he gathered up a part of the broken first division and
hurled it on the flank of a terrific German attack which seemed to be
proceeding on the assumption that the victory was won and that the English were
entirely beaten. A wounded officer fell headlong into the Musketeers' trenches
with an order that they were to form up at once and follow.</p>
<p>All this time the old, amazing cheerfulness prevailed. There was not a man
there who regarded that battle as anything but the finest sport in the world, a
great and glorious game designed especially for his benefit, and there was not
a man there who dreamt of defeat. Death might come&mdash;probably would, but no
one thought of that for the moment; indeed, the chief regret of the Musketeers
was that they were about to leave the tiny strip of Flanders which they had
come to look upon more or less in the light of a home.</p>
<p>"I wonder wot the gime is," Ginger murmured to his next door neighbour. "At
any rate, it looks as if it was good-bye to our 'appy 'ome. I expect the
General Staff's got jealous of us, an' wants this trench to themselves. Perhaps
the general is goin' to breed rabbits 'ere."</p>
<p>"Didn't you 'ear wot the officer said?" the other man asked. "It sounded as
if we'd caught the Germans badly on the flank, and if we can keep 'em on the
run now we'll be back on the original line. Come on, Ginger, ole man; don't
stop talkin' 'ere all day, unless p'raps you wants ter take the German army on
to your own cheek."</p>
<p>Still grumbling, after the way of his own kind, Ginger followed. And then it
seemed as it the miracle had really happened. The German flank had broken
before a furious attack of not half its strength, and the men that French had
rallied were pushing the foe back headlong towards Gheluvelt. For the moment,
at any rate, it looked as if the greatest attack in the history of warfare had
failed. For there was no holding the British now; they swept on with an
irresistible dash, fighting their way back to the original lines, and long
before dark they were again in the old positions.</p>
<p>From a purely technical point of view, the British had merely held their
own; in reality they had won that long battle which meant that in future the
Allies would dominate the course of the campaign in the West. But it was a
victory won at a terrible price. One regiment went into that fight twelve
hundred strong, on the evening of that fateful day they mustered seventy. Of
another regiment three hundred answered to the roll call instead of fifteen,
and practically every one of the other twelve hundred men had fallen on that
never-to-be-forgotten October 31.</p>
<p>It was much the same with the cavalry. One of our most famous brigades rode
into that action nearly five thousand strong. When they emerged they had been
decimated, but they had something to boast of. For during that long and trying
day they had succeeded in holding off the whole of a German Army Corps of over
forty thousand men. The mind staggers before the prospect of such a triumph as
this, and yet it has been done. The impossible has been achieved and the price
to pay had not been perhaps too much.</p>
<p>When the night of the 31st fell the assault on Ypres, long planned and
contrived by the German General Staff, had failed. For days and nights the
contemptible little British army, numbering a hundred and twenty thousand men,
had succeeded not only in holding at bay but actually in driving off something
like five times its number, armed and equipped as no body of troops had ever
been equipped in the history of warfare.</p>
<p>But even then the German Emperor was not satisfied. During those fateful two
or three days he must have seen at least two hundred thousand of the flower of
his army mowed down by the British rifle and artillery fire. He had the galling
experience of seeing the men he regarded as invincible wiped out of existence
without gaining so much as a single yard. He must have known in his heart of
hearts that of all the wild dreams that had ever crept into that mad brain of
his, the vision of Calais was the wildest. But the Butcher of Europe had not
shot his bolt yet.</p>
<p>Absolutely blind to the loss of life, and callous to the suffering imposed
on those who followed him so faithfully with sublime belief in the justice of
their cause, he made one more effort on the following day.</p>
<p>The British had yet to learn what it was to face the full force of the
weight of his own Prussian Guard. He did not know that in the meantime the
French had brought up reinforcements; all he could see was himself proclaiming
the annexation of Belgium in the historic Cloth Hall of Ypres. It is said that
he himself led the attack and urged his massed forces on to what proved to be
the greatest slaughter in the campaign. The Prussian Guard came back to it
again and again in sweeping waves, climbing over their own dead, but all in
vain. When night fell three-quarters of the Prussian Guard lay dead in the
woods, in ranks piled eight or ten deep one upon the top of the other, in a
holocaust that baffles all description. That night the Germans fell back
suddenly, and the battle of Ypres was finished. But at what a cost will never
be known, not even when history comes to be written.</p>
<h2><a id="chap35" name="chap35">XXXV - A CHEERFUL TOMMY</a></h2>
<p class="first">It is only by slow degrees that the true story of Ypres and
the stupendous result of the fight there is coming home to the world. For a
long time the fog of war lay over the battlefield and the curtain has been
lifted only inch by inch, despite the fact that not more than four hours
separate the scene of the combat from London itself. These are the days when
intelligence travels fast, yet weeks and months passed before the significance
of that great struggle began to get home to the British people. They knew, of
course, that fighting was going on, but they did not realise for a moment that
a mere handful of men were engaged in what was really a life and death struggle
on behalf of the Empire.</p>
<p>And yet there can be no question that the magnificent stand made at Ypres by
French and his gallant men is entitled to rank with the decisive battles of the
world, with Marathon and Cressy and Waterloo, with Moscow and Austerlitz. It
broke for ever the German dream of the possession of the North Coast of France
and the delirious idea of an onslaught upon England by way of Calais. It spoilt
the pleasant scheme which was to include Northern France within the German
Dominion and attach Belgium and her seaboard to Germany. It cost Prussia three
hundred and seventy-five thousand of her finest troops. And it enabled Russia
to concentrate and become a serious menace to the eastern frontier, so that a
division of forces was necessary. In a word, it broke up the great conspiracy
and showed the Kaiser and his friends plainly enough that the dream of half a
century was no more than a mere nightmare. They might boast and brag and
swagger as much as they liked, they could proudly point to the fact that they
held Belgium and a large slice of France and that their own territory was
intact, but at the same time they knew that the end was coming, and from that
moment idle vapourings ceased and Germany began to talk as if an honourable
peace was all that she could hope for.</p>
<p>For the time being, therefore, there was quiet on the western frontier. The
winter had set in now. November had arrived with its fogs and rain, and the
trenches were waist deep in water. The roads were becoming impossible for the
transmission of heavy artillery, and the Allies were settling down to a dogged
resistance behind their lines. Very little could happen now until the spring,
by which time France would be ready and England's new army in a position to
take the field. Russia would be able to move freely too, and the eyes of the
world were beginning to turn towards Italy.</p>
<p>The Musketeers were back again in their trench, which was now safe from
surprise for a long time to come. They were worn and battered, and of their
original number not a couple of hundred remained. But luck had been with
Bentley and Kemp and the rest of their little group, and all the familiar faces
to be seen. It was only for a day or two, however, that they remained where
they were, for orders came for them to go down to the base.</p>
<p>"Why can't they leave us alone?" Ginger grumbled. "We are 'appy enough 'ere.
We discovered this plice an' took possession of it in the nime of the British
Government. It's just as snug and comfortable as if we were at 'ome. Now I
suppose they wants to turn us out to make room for a lot o' recruities wots
never seen a shot fired."</p>
<p>"I think you're wrong there, Ginger," Bentley said. "From what I can
understand we are going down to the base for a month's rest. We've been at it
now for over three months, and we've been in the thick of it all the time."</p>
<p>"There's some people as can't be done without," Ginger said. "Where would
the British army be if it wasn't for the Musketeers? Wot's the good of us goin'
down to the base? Fat lot of good we shall do there. We come 'ere to fight, not
to make bread or to show 'em 'ow to cook."</p>
<p>"Ole Ginger ain't never satisfied," George remarked, "'e don't know when
'e's well off. We're goin' to Paris, that's wot they're goin' to do wif us.
They're goin' to shove us in a fust class 'otel an' tike us round all the
theatres. I dunno as I'm sorry as we shall be aht of it for a bit."</p>
<p>Ginger wasn't sorry either, though it was his way to grumble at the new
order of things, for to tell the truth what was left of the Musketeers were
thoroughly worn out. They had had no sleep for over a fortnight, except what
they could snatch in odd moments; they were hungry and tired, ragged and stiff
with mud, and for the most part verminous. But they had become attached to
their trench with all its solid comforts, and they were proud of it. It was the
envy of the brigade and of such visitors as came their way with orders or
ammunition.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't mind so much," Ginger said, "if we could get the brigadier to
promise us as we should come back 'ere again. It mikes my 'eart fairly ache to
think as this little grey 'ome in the west of our'n. Wot them German coves was
so kind as to make for us, should be 'anded over to a lot o' rookies as don't
know a good thing when they see it. Wot do you think, sir? Are we comin'
back?"</p>
<p>Ginger turned and addressed his remark to the lieutenant in command of his
platoon. The officer in question was doing his best to remove a fortnight's
beard with the aid of a commandeered safety razor and a bit of broken
looking-glass. There were other men lying about in the trenches engaged in
scraping the mud from their uniforms. They were a sorry-looking lot, ragged and
rough, but every man was in the pink of condition and ready to fight for his
life. It was amazing how cheerful they were, and how little they made of their
hardships. There was not a single man amongst them who would not have resented
the suggestion that he was the least bit of a hero. This same sporting air
prevailed with them all. They had been through the doors of death and into the
very gates of hell, but had not Englishmen been doing the same thing for
hundreds of years? And would not unborn generations do the same thing again?
War, and the doings of war, were the last things they thought of. For the
moment all strife was behind them, and the future mattered nothing. What they
had done in the past they could do again, and that was the beginning and the
end of it. They were just a cheery, happy, inconsequent band of brothers who
had been fighting side by side for a common end; where the newspaper boy and
the young Oxford man had respected each other and were only too ready to hold
out a helping hand to a comrade in time of distress and suffering. Despite his
growl Ginger was as happy as the rest in the prospect of going down to the base
and getting out of all this mud and misery, at any rate for the time being.</p>
<p>"I shall, be glad of it," George said. "If I don't get a change soon this
old uniform of mine will fall to pieces. You chaps may not think it, but I've
always been accustomed to me bath regular, and I ain't 'ad a wash for weeks.
Anybody got a cigarette? I ain't smoked for days."</p>
<h2><a id="chap36" name="chap36">XXVI - AT THE BASE</a></h2>
<p class="first">The Musketeers went back from the firing line with less than
two hundred of their original strength. They had, of course, been supplemented
by draughts from time to time, but this was not the same thing to those who had
been through the campaign since the middle of August. These were all known to
one another, and were banded together by ties that were almost sacred. It
mattered little or nothing whence these original men came, whether they had
been picked up in the gutter or were the finest product of the English public
schools. For all those distinctions had been sunk now, and the Musketeers were
as a band of brothers.</p>
<p>They had come out of the trenches, battered and scarred, ragged and
unshaven, but every man was as fine as a star, and as hard as a bar of steel.
They were going back to the rest which they needed a great deal more than they
were aware, for it was only when the tension relaxed that they realised what
the nervous strain of the last three months had been. There were men amongst
them who could not sleep, or who started up in the middle of the night crying
that the foe were upon them, and that the trenches were in danger. There were
men who could not write a letter, men who could not still the quivering of
their nerves or steady their hands without something to rest upon. It was only
when danger was near that they could forget all this and string themselves up
for the fight again. They had marched towards the base hardly conscious of
their limbs, and there were some amongst them who declared that for weeks past
there had been no sensation in their lower limbs whatever. It was only when
they cut away their ragged breeches and puttees, reduced to a mere strip, that
they begun to realise that they were walking upright.</p>
<p>It was not very far behind the firing line that they went. They were still
almost within reach of the German heavy guns, and it was no unusual sight to
see a German Aviatik or a Taube flying menacingly overhead. But here, at any
rate, were huts, tents, and clean bedding, to say nothing of fresh uniforms and
underclothing, and the baths that they so sorely needed. As they went along the
sense of responsibility lightened, and they swung presently into their quarters
as lighthearted as a lot of schoolboys. For the next few days, at any rate,
they would have very little to do but rest and smoke and enjoy themselves.
There was a break in the incessant rainfall just then, and it was possible to
sit out in the sunshine and enjoy an air which at any other time would have
been cold and raw. But by comparison it was as if the Musketeers had stepped
out of winter into the full beauty of the spring.</p>
<p>They were looking forward keenly now to anything in the way of enjoyment;
they did not expect much, but their hopes were raised when they caught sight of
a big tent, where there was seating accommodation for many hundreds, and
outside which was a notice to the effect that a concert party performed nightly
for the benefit of the troops.</p>
<p>"There ought to be some good local talent 'ere," said Ginger. "I did 'ear as
some of the big stars was comin' over from England. 'Oo's that chap in the soft
'at over there? Blimme, if it ain't Seymour 'Icks!" And Ginger, clothed afresh
from head to foot, warm and comfortable and well fed, with his pockets full of
cigarettes, set out to make enquiries. He came back presently from the lines of
another regiment down from the front, full of excitement.</p>
<p>"It's all right, you chaps," he said. "It wasn't a mere accident as brought
that chap over 'ere. Seems to me we've come just at the right time. 'Arf the
big bugs on the music 'all stige is over 'ere. There's a 'ole lot o' them in
the farm'ouse yonder. If we'd 'ave been 'ere last night we should 'ave 'ad a
concert as they can't get in the West End not all at once even if they pays a
guinea to sit in the stalls."</p>
<p>And Ginger proceeded to reel off a list of names that fairly staggered all
his listeners.</p>
<p>"Wot's the good o' trying to fill us up with that?" one of the listeners
scoffed. "You carn't kid me as all them swells, drawing their two or three
'undred ponds a week, is goin' to get leave to come over 'ere an' sing to a lot
o' bloomin' Tommies in a tent. You go off an' tell that story to somebody else,
Ginger. I'm too old for it."</p>
<p>"It's the truest thing I ever said in my life," Ginger said. "There's a
regular party of them. They come over 'ere to cheer up the wounded. They've
been at it for days. An' they was persuaded to come along 'ere an' give us
chaps a charnce. There's a concert on to-night as the King 'imself couldn't
better, not even if 'e was entertainin' 'is pals at Buckingham Palace. There
ain't nothin' to pay neither. If you don't believe it, you go into the tent an'
walk as far as the platform, an' you will see the nimes of the 'ole star caste
I'm talkin' abaht. Why, I've paid a shillin' many a time on a bank 'oliday
night to 'ear even one o' them."</p>
<p>One or two men kicking a football about took Ginger at his word. They
professed to believe that he was still taking advantage of their innocence, but
they hesitated no longer when Ginger produced the last sixpence in his
possession and offered to bet that coin with anybody that what he stated was
nothing but the absolute truth.</p>
<p>Presently the others came back and confirmed what Ginger had said. They had
seen the programme, and in the big tent later on in the evening a packed
audience witnessed a performance that was practically unique in the history of
the British Empire. And never before had any company of entertainers met with
so enthusiastic a reception. Their kindness was thoroughly appreciated, and
every entertainer was at his or her best. It was all over at length, and the
Musketeers went back to their quarters to talk over the amazing evening long
after lights were out.</p>
<p>"We shan't know ourselves if this sort o' thing goes on," Ginger said. "Not
as we can expect another show like this. Didn't I 'ear something said about
those chaps in the next line wanting to tike us on at football?"</p>
<p>"I did 'ear something abaht it," George said. "They calls themselves the
'Ard Nuts.' A chap in G lines told me this mornin' as they'd bin 'ere abaht
three weeks gettin' ready to go up to the front, and 'e said as they'd taken on
pretty well every battalion so far an' beaten 'em out o' sight. They've got a
lieutenant as used to play for Oxford University, an' 'e gives 'is men five
quid amongst 'em for every match they wins."</p>
<p>"Oh, 'e does, does 'e," Ginger replied. "You told Mr. Selwyn that,
George?"</p>
<p>Ginger mentioned a lieutenant in the Musketeers who, two years before, had
figured, as an amateur, of course, in the final tie of the Association Cup.
Whilst the Musketeers were still training in England the lieutenant had been
very keen on forming a football team, and the Musketeers had done exceedingly
well against all clubs who had come against them. The Musketeers were
holiday-making now in the best sense of the word. They wanted to forget as far
as possible all they had been through during the last two months, and this
football idea seemed to be as good a way as any other of achieving the desired
result.</p>
<p>George was a football enthusiast, too, and might have gone far in the game
if only in his degenerate days he had brought himself to undergo the rigours of
training.</p>
<p>"That's all right," he said. "I've got a little gime on if the lieutenant
will back me up. We'll teach them 'Ard Nuts a lesson that they won't forget in
a 'urry."</p>
<h2><a id="chap37" name="chap37">XXXVII - THE MUSKETEERS AT PLAY</a></h2>
<p class="first">This kind of thing was beyond the grasp of a foreign mind. It
was certainly a thing no German could understand. Though the Teuton has invaded
this country to his advantage and our detriment for the last fifty years, he
has never grasped, and probably never will grasp, the true inwardness of the
British spirit. He knows, of course, that England finally overthrew Napoleon at
Waterloo and freed Europe from the same menace that the Kaiser would impose
upon her now, but he could not grasp the true inwardness of Wellington's
expression that Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton.</p>
<p>The commercial German, with his nose ever pressed close to the mercantile
grindstone, cannot understand that the British Empire has been founded and
maintained by the sporting spirit. That is why there can only be one end to the
present conflict. With the German it is war all the time, it is one constant
struggle, with no relaxation at all; and that is what is going to beat him.
That the British Tommy should turn his back, even for it moment, on the foe and
indulge in one of his favourite pastimes, causes the German to sneer and speak
spitefully of a race that is utterly incapable of taking anything seriously for
many days together. But it is this very lightheartedness and optimistic spirit
that render England impervious to defeat.</p>
<p>But no such thoughts as these occupied the simple minds of Ginger and his
friends as they discussed the scheme whereby they were to reduce the proud
record of the Hard Nuts. They were thinking about football now and nothing
else, and they would go back to the fighting line presently all the better for
it.</p>
<p>"We ain't particularly strong an' that's a fact," George said. "A couple o'
months ago we would 'ave taken those chaps on wiv a very good charnce, but we
must 'ave lost at least seven or eight of our best men since then. An' those
chaps don't 'arf fancy themselves. I was talkin' to one o' them this afternoon,
their centre forward 'e is, a chap wot used to work down at Woolich, an' 'e
told me as we could get a few substitutes if we liked. 'E said as there was
about fifteen thousand men in this camp an' we could make 'em up from wherever
we liked. An' 'e wanted to know if Mr. Selwyn was good enough to back us for a
fiver. An' o' course I said as 'e was. I couldn't do nothin' else."</p>
<p>"You might 'ave arsked 'im first, George," Ginger said. "'E's a proper young
sport, but I don't suppose 'e will thank you to chuck 'is quids abaht in that
fashion."</p>
<p>"Yes, 'e will when 'e knows wot's in the back of my mind," George said
confidently. "An' don't you forget we can pick our men from wherever we like.
There ain't above five of us as are any good, but I've got my eye upon one or
two more, an' I don't care where they comes from so long as they wipes the
floor wiv them 'ere 'Ard Nuts."</p>
<p>"Where're you goin' to get 'em from?" Ginger asked.</p>
<p>"Well, I've thought o' that too," George replied. "It ain't no difficult a
matter as your think when you comes to realise as there are fifteen thousand
men in this camp. Did ye ever 'ear tell of the 5th Royals?"</p>
<p>"No, I never did," Ginger said.</p>
<p>"Well, these 'ere 5th Royals was recruited after the beginnin' o' the war by
a chap called Reynolds 'oo used to be goal-keeper for Blackburn Rovers. 'E only
played football for amusement, because you see 'e was rather a big man up there
in the cotton tride, an' when 'e couldn't play no more 'e become President o'
the Club an' is on the Council o' the league. You must 'ave 'eard of 'im,
Ginger."</p>
<p>"Nime sounds familiar," Ginger admitted. "But go on, George. I'm beginnin'
to get a bit interested."</p>
<p>"You'll be a jolly sight more interested before I'm finished," George
replied. "Well, this 'ere Reynolds wot's a very decent chap an' wot the
newspapers call universally popular, thinks as it wouldn't be a bad thing if 'e
tried to raise a battalion amongst coves wot's interested in football. You see,
e's a Territorial officer 'imself, an' 'e 'ad a natural ambition to command a
battalion of 'is own. So 'e just sets to work, an' in less than a week 'e'd got
all the men 'e wanted. Now, you know something abaht football, an' you might be
glad to 'ear of certain coves wot's joined the 5th Royals."</p>
<p>Whereupon George proceeded to reel off half a dozen names which are known
all over the world where football is played. Ginger and the rest listened with
a grin on their faces, for they began to see what their comrade was driving
at.</p>
<p>"D'you mean to say," one of them asked, "as them 'Ard Nuts don't know wot
you've just told us?"</p>
<p>"They don't," George grinned. "I was arskin' a few questions just now, an'
they're all as innocent as a lot o' kid's. You' see the Royals ain't worryin'
much abaht football now; their one idea is to get to the front as soon as
possible; but they are as 'ard as niles an' fit to play for their country. They
ain't like us who 'as come dahn to this 'ealth resort for the sike of our
nerves, an' that's why they very properly ain't troubling much abaht football.
But they wouldn't mind a gime, an' I'm quite sure, from wot one of 'em told me,
as they'd be only too pleased to 'elp us to tike down the 'Ard Nuts an' pocket
'arf a quid at the sime time. An' for their own sikes they won't say anything
abaht it. You leave it to me to see Mr. Selwyn in the mornin' an' put it
right."</p>
<p>But apparently the little scheme for getting the best of the Hard Nuts had
been discussed in the hearing of the lieutenant, for it was he who approached
George in the morning.</p>
<p>"Well, George," he said. "Are we going to have any football while we are
down here? I'll get up a list of fixtures for you if you like. We shall only be
the ghost of the team we used to be, but we can do our best. Besides, we must
do something while we are down here. It will never do for a regiment that has
got a reputation like ours to slack it as some of them appear to be doing."</p>
<p>"There's nothin' we'd like better, sor," George said. "We'd very much like
to 'ave a go at these 'ere 'Ard Nuts."</p>
<p>"So I understand," the lieutenant smiled drily. "What have you been up to,
George? I saw Colonel Reynolds of the 5th Royals last night, and he told me
that one of my men had been on to one of his with a view to getting up a team
with the laudable object of lowering the pride of the aforesaid Nuts. Can I see
your handwriting in this, George?"</p>
<p>"I ain't goin' to deny it, sir," George replied. "I'm fair sick o' the swank
o' those chaps. They wants to tike us on, an' they was good enough to say as
they don't mind us gettin' 'elp from anywhere. Their captain 'e gives them a
five pahnd note for every match they win, an' one o' their chaps 'e arsks me if
you, sir, would back us wiv a five pahnd note."</p>
<p>"It would be throwing money away, George."</p>
<p>"Not if you works it my way," George responded. "They said as they didn't
mind substitutes, so I thought as we might borrow 'arf a dozen from the 5th
Royals. Well, we could make up a 'ole International line, to say nothin' of a
man wot'd keep goal for England. An' the best o' the 'ole joke is as them 'Ard
Nuts don't even know as there's such a thing as the 5th Royals in existence.
Bacon, as used to play for Ashton Villa, told me so this mornin'. Don't say as
you're goin' to spoil the little gime, sir? It'll be somethin' to laugh at for
months."</p>
<h2><a id="chap38" name="chap38">XXXVIII - TOMMY'S LITTLE WAY</a></h2>
<p class="first">For some not very apparent reason the forthcoming football
match between the Musketeers and the battalion who had christened themselves
the Hard Nuts was occupying a good deal of attention in the base camp. It seems
almost impossible for people far remote from the scene of that awful strife to
understand how a body of men with so stern a task before them could forget the
perils and privations of their position and concentrate their attention upon a
mere game. But this is a rule that works both ways, and there are thousands of
Englishmen at home to-day who have not yet grasped, or perhaps do not want to
grasp, the true inwardness of the position. If men of military age can follow
sport at home and devote themselves almost exclusively to such a pastime as
racing when their country is in danger, every allowance should be made for the
man who has taken his share in the fighting line and is only too willing and
ready to go back to it again.</p>
<p>The Musketeers had done their share, and more; they were glad enough of the
rest and change; they had not asked for it, but now it had come their way they
meant to enjoy it to the utmost.</p>
<p>Probably the man called George had taken many people into his secret, for
there was a great deal of whispering and laughing, and when the time came there
would be a goodly company to witness the downfall of the Hard Nuts&mdash;a
certainty in the opinion of George and those in the know.</p>
<p>All arrangements had been handed over to Lieutenant Selwyn and a major of
the Hard Nuts, a sportsman to his finger tips, who, though too old himself for
such a strenuous game as football, was the leader of all games so far as his
battalion was concerned. It was upon him that Selwyn called to make the final
arrangements.</p>
<p>"Of course, I quite understand," he said. "As you are at present, your
people are not strong enough to tackle us single-handed, and you are at perfect
liberty to get a few substitutes from the other battalions here."</p>
<p>"I understood that," Selwyn said. "And we have practically made up our
team."</p>
<p>"I hope you have found something good," the major said. "I should like to
see something like a game."</p>
<p>"Oh, I think we can promise you that," Selwyn replied drily. "There's a
regiment over behind the hills yonder that is very keen on football, and they
have lent us one or two quite good men. You may have heard of the 5th
Royals."</p>
<p>Obviously the major hadn't, for he shook his head. The lieutenant smiled
with the air of a man who is pleased with himself. The plot was going on
nicely.</p>
<p>"I suppose you don't want to back your men!" the leader asked. "I am good
for a small wager."</p>
<p>"I think I would rather not," Selwyn observed. "I promised our lot a treat
if they won, which means that I shall have to give it them in any case. But I
won't back them if you don't mind. You'll know why later on."</p>
<p>Still the major suspected nothing.</p>
<p>"Have you any idea what football is like out here?" he asked. "For instance,
have you seen the ground we play on? It will be a bit of a shock for you when
you do."</p>
<p>It was. It was a football field by courtesy only. Months back it had been
prepared for defence, at the moment when it looked as if nothing in the world
could prevent the German march to Calais. There was not a blade of grass upon
it, and here and there were little pits and hollows which had been formed by
shells from the German heavy guns. All round were half-made trenches, and
almost in the centre of the ground a big house had stood at some time. In the
background were woods, partly destroyed and with roads out through them for the
passage of transport wagons. The brown faced major indicated the prospect with
a wave of his hand.</p>
<p>"There it is, and we must make the best of it," he said. "It's like making
bricks without straw. I don't suppose you know this part of the country, but I
do. You would hardly believe it, but twelve months ago I was over here pheasant
shooting. I'm on the Stock Exchange, and the man who owns this property used to
do a good deal of business through me. The poor chap's dead now; he was killed
at Bruges at the beginning of the war. He had cotton mills here. Within a few
yards of where we are standing was a beautiful old house, built at least three
centuries ago. It was surrounded by Italian gardens and a moat, where we used
to catch fish. Those woods yonder were woods in the proper sense of the word,
full of pheasants and snipe. I can't bring myself to believe that this was only
twelve months ago, but so it was. I don't think we've got anything more to talk
about know, have we?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so," Selwyn said. "At two o'clock on Friday afternoon
then."</p>
<p>It seemed strange to Selwyn that so keen a sportsman as the major had heard
nothing of the reputation of the battalion known as the 5th Royals; but the
latter had only just come up from the sea, and the Hard Nuts had been recruited
for the most part along the Thames waterways between Wapping and the Medway.
With one or two rare exceptions, they had not seen anything of first-class
football, for they were too far away from London to touch Woolwich or Tottenham
or Chelsea and their own local clubs were confined to such combinations as the
Medway League and the South Eastern Group. Therefore, George had cunningly
reckoned on the probability that practically none of the Hard Nuts had ever
seen the substitutes whom he had gathered together on any football field.</p>
<p>George grinned broadly when the lieutenant told him the gist of his
conversation with Major Brawnwood.</p>
<p>"It'll be a fine joke," he said. "They'll come to us, and we shall play with
them as if they was a lot o' little lambs. It'll be a treat to see their fices
when they come up against our first line. Why, that night as we took those
trenches of ours won't be nithin' to it. If our chaps wot's in the know'll only
keep their mouths shut, they'll 'ave the treat o' their lives."</p>
<p>"I think it will be a bit of a surprise," the lieutenant said. "But there's
one thing I want to impress upon you, George. There isn't to be any betting.
Knowing what we do, it would be something very much like a swindle."</p>
<p>George looked a little askance at the suggestion, for he and some of his
friends had anticipated some small addition to their income from the
discomforture of the Hard Nuts. But the lieutenant was perfectly firm on the
point, and George was bound to agree that he was right. There was nothing more
to be said or done now except for the Musketeers to wait with what patience
they could for the following Friday afternoon, and hope that no boasting
Musketeer who was in the know would so far forget himself as to betray the
secret preparations which had been made for the downfall of the battalion who
were beginning to regard themselves as the football champions of the British
army. It was Ginger who warned his friends against this kind of thing, and
threatened them with what would happen if they forgot themselves and went too
far.</p>
<p>"We ought not to 'ave said anything to anybody," he observed, "It's a rum
thing to me as those chaps ain't found anything out abaht the Royals. It's a
rum thing, too, as they ain't thought o' playin' a match themselves. I'm glad
as they're in camp such a long way off. I was in their lines this afternoon,
talkin' matters over with them champions o' theirs, an' they're as keen on the
joke as we are. I wouldn't miss the fun not even to be back in the trenches
again."</p>
<h2><a id="chap39" name="chap39">XXXIX - THE END OF THE GAME</a></h2>
<p class="first">The afternoon of Friday was fairly fine, with a keen wind
blowing across the ground that gave no advantages to either side. All round the
ropes soldiers from a dozen regiments were gathered, including a large number
of Indian troops, who were just as keen as the rest of the spectators, and by
no means the least critical amongst them, for most of them had played the game
at home. It was quite evident from the first that the sympathy of the crowd was
on the side of the Musketeers, who were held to have done a very sporting thing
in challenging their opponents, who had carried everything before them up to
now. But when the two sides came to a line up, and Major Brawnwood stepped out
into the field to kick off for his side, a keen-faced London territorial
whistled softly as he ran his eye over the Musketeer forwards, and turned
eagerly to a sporting comrade.</p>
<p>"Look 'ere, Bill," he said, "you're a bit of a sportsman in your way, an'
you're generally keen on a gamble. I think I'd like to back these 'ere
Musketeers. They're a scratch lot, an' I'll want a shade of odds. You lay me
half a crown to a shilln', an' as a favour I'll tike yer."</p>
<p>"It ain't like you to chuck your money away, ole man," the other responded.
"An' I don't suppose you've come aht as one of those bloomin' philanthropists.
I should say the odds are 20 to 1, but you've seen more football than I 'ave,
bein' a regular follower of Chelsea, an' I shouldn't be surprised to find aht
as you know something."</p>
<p>"But is it a bet, Bill?" the other asked.</p>
<p>"No, it ain't," his friend snapped. "I've known you now for 15 years, an'
you never risked a penny yet on anything as wasn't a dead snap, so you'll
kindly excuse me, mate. There's Ned on the other side o' you. He's a bit more
softer'n wot I am. You try an' touch 'im for 'arf a dollar."</p>
<p>The would-be sportsman gave up his effort with a sign. Indeed, he had
spotted something, but much to his grief he could see no way to make anything
out of it. All he could do, therefore, was to keep his knowledge to himself and
enjoy the coming surprise to the Hard Nuts.</p>
<p>What the baffled spectator had seen was a tall figure in goal, a figure that
he recognised at a glance as a football player who had represented his country
in at least half a dozen international matches. Then he began to recollect that
there was such a thing as a footballers' battalion, and that a great many
prominent players had joined it. And then he recollected that the name of the
same battalion was the Royals.</p>
<p>His discriminating eye could see nothing in the back division except
Lieutenant Selwyn, who, as everybody knew, had played for his university, and
Kemp, who shared the same honours. But it was the five forwards who occupied
the discriminating sportsman's attention to the exclusion of the rest. There
was not one amongst them who had not an international reputation; they had
figured at the Palace and other historic grounds; indeed, it was amazing to the
baffled capitalist that they were not recognised by scores of people round the
ground.</p>
<p>The ball was kicked off and taken with a rush down to the Musketeers' end,
where in the first minute a goal seemed to be inevitable. But the big man
between the posts fielded the ball with the greatest coolness and drove it far
down the ground. A moment or two later it was back again, for it took the
Musketeers' forwards a few minutes to find their feet. But when they did so the
centre forward threaded his way through three or four opponents, and then slung
the ball right away to the left wing, where an elusive little man with a red
head trapped it cleverly and flashed down along the line to the corner flag,
where he coolly tricked two opponents and sent it beautifully right in front of
goal. Like a flash the centre forward was through, and meeting the ball as it
fell, shot it with terrific force into the corner of the net, giving the
goalkeeper no chance whatever. It was as pretty and neat a bit of football as
any ever seen at home, and deservedly applauded. The man who wanted to make the
bet sighed deeply. It almost seemed to him that he had a grievance against
Providence. His next door neighbour turned to him and demanded to know what it
all meant.</p>
<p>"You're a nice chap," he said, "tryin' to tike advantage of a pal like this.
This is class football, this is; and the British army ain't seen nothin' like
it before. An' seein' as there is no chance of workin' yer little games on me
you might as well tell me the joke."</p>
<p>"I only spotted it when they come up on the field," the other man said.
"Stright, I did. An' then when I saw that chap in goal I begins to tumble. 'E's
an international, 'e is, an' so's all the forward line."</p>
<p>The speaker reeled off five names that made the other gasp.</p>
<p>"But wot're they doin' 're?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Why, they belongs to the 5th Royals, wot only come up a day or two ago.
Don't you see as it's a put-up job to tike down the number o' the 'Ard Nuts?
Nobody don't know as the Royals is up 'ere yet, an' they ain't been advertisin'
themselves, because you see they thought they was goin' on to the trenches. I
expect the lieutenant wot's playin' for the Musketeers found out all abaht it
an' worked the whole joke."</p>
<p>From that moment the Musketeers and their friends lost no grip of the game.
They were all over their opponents, simply playing with them, and by the time
the interval came were not less than seven goals up. It was obvious, too, that
they could easily have added to that total if they liked.</p>
<p>It was a strange scene that the spectators looked upon, 22 men struggling
there as if their whole existence depended upon it, as if the greatest struggle
in the history of the world had not come about, and as if the firing line was
not within an easy march. Even as the struggle went on the sullen booming of a
gun came from the distance, and once a shell dropped just over the farthest
ring of the spectators, and burst harmlessly in a wood. It had just about as
much effect as the discharge of a popgun or a boy's cracker on the fifth of
November. There was not a single man looking on who had eyes or ears for
anything else but the fine game which those famous forwards were playing. And
then, when the game was drawing to a close, there was a sudden fusillade quite
close at hand, and one or two of the spectators, looking up, saw that a German
aeroplane was hovering overhead.</p>
<p>"Now, I call that rotten bad taste," Ginger said. "An' somebody ought to
write to the Kaiser abaht it. Wot they want comin' 'ere for when we're enjoyin'
ourselves?"</p>
<p>The aeroplane swayed from side to side, and a cheer went up from the crowd
as one of the wings was seen to collapse and the aviator came with a rush to
the ground, just saving himself from injury as he alighted near the Musketeers'
goal post. The prevailing feeling for the moment was one of exasperation that
the game should be interrupted in such an unsportsmanlike way. Then the whistle
sounded, and there was a rush from all parts of the ground in the direction of
the aviator and his pilot. They had sustained no injury, but the plane was
wrecked, and scores of willing hands dragged it out of the way. Thrilling as
the incident was, it did not detract for a moment from the business of the
afternoon. Lieutenant Selwyn came forward and regarded the aviator with a
glance in which recognition was not wanting.</p>
<p>"Hello, Kaharn," he said. "I didn't expect to see you like this. And I
didn't think you took any interest in football. Major, shall we go on with the
game?"</p>
<p>A yell of appreciation came from all parts of the ground. For this was the
spirit in which the Englishmen fought and played.</p>
<h2><a id="chap40" name="chap40">XL - THE RED COTTAGE</a></h2>
<p class="first">There were, of course, many other sports and pastimes down
there at the base besides the historic encounter between the Musketeers and the
Hard Nuts, which had become a joke of which the troops never seemed to tire.
For instance, there was a gymkhana organised by the Indians, which in its way
was a revelation to the British Tommies, who, except for the handful of
seasoned troops that had seen service in our great Eastern Dependencies, had
never seen anything like it before. They had a wholesome respect for the Ghurka
and the Sikh, whom they knew to be magnificent fighters, but this was the first
time they saw what our coloured soldiers could do in the way of horsemanship
and feats of strength and skill.</p>
<p>There was plenty of time for all this now, for the winter had set in, the
cold, wet winter which resolved itself into a game of patience and endurance on
both sides. There would be nothing much doing before the spring, a fact in
which the German leaders sullenly acquiesced. It was a case of sitting tight in
the trenches and watching one another carefully for months. There might be
outbreaks here and there, half-hearted attacks, but beyond all doubt the
amazing defences of Ypres had reduced the Germans to a standstill for the time
being. There were plenty of reserves now, so it was possible to give the heroes
of the campaign the spells of rest that they so sorely needed. Three or four
times during the next few weeks the Musketeers were back in the trenches, but
only for a few days at a time, and then it became possible to give certain
units the opportunity of a few days' leave.</p>
<p>It was getting near Christmas, and Bentley and Kemp had begun to wonder if
they might be among the fortunate ones when they found themselves with half a
dozen of their comrades before the colonel one morning, without the remotest
idea why they had been sent for.</p>
<p>"I suppose you men know," the colonel said, "that it has been possible to
send certain of you home from time to time. Would any of you like to go?"</p>
<p>There was only one answer to a question like this.</p>
<p>"Well, I have picked certain men out," the colonel went on. "We certainly
have had a cruel time during the last three or four months, and it is no boast
to say that no regiment in the British army has done better than the
Musketeers. It is almost impossible that anything big can happen now before the
spring, and it is not a difficult matter to spare you for a few days. You had
better arrange to go down to the coast with our next draft on Saturday, and you
can tell the captain I said that you can have ten days, which ought to carry
you over Christmas. This is a bit longer than most people get, but I may say
that I am particularly pleased with your section, and I am only sorry that I
cannot send that man Smith and one or two more as well. But he had his holiday
during the time he was away wounded, if you understand what I mean. And I think
that will do."</p>
<p>Here was a bit of luck greater than Kemp and Bentley had dared to hope for.
It would not be one of the old fashioned Christmases, but it would be a fine
thing to be back home again, and they rejoiced openly in the prospect. There
was only one man amongst them who did not appear to be enthusiastic or to care
about going. He even offered to give his place up to somebody else. Then Kemp
detained him and asked the reason why.</p>
<p>"You don't want to go home?" he said. "You don't want to see your people
again, Gordon?"</p>
<p>The man called Gordon shook his head.</p>
<p>"I haven't any people," he said. "I haven't a relation in the world that I
know of. When I was quite a small boy I went out to Canada with my father and I
stayed there till he died. He never mentioned any relations; he always struck
me as a sour, disappointed man, though he was a good father enough to me. He
sent me to England to be educated. Soon after I went back to Canada my father
died, and I found myself very well off. I thought I should be happy in England,
but somehow I haven't got the knack of making friends. And when this war broke
out I hailed it as a sort of godsend to me. I wanted something to do, and I
found it. I know now that I was always meant to be a soldier, and I don't seem
to care for anything else. I think if you were me you would rather stay here
than go back."</p>
<p>"But you are coming all the same," Kemp said. "We've always got on very well
together, and you ought to have had a commission long ago. It will be your own
fault if you don't find friends in Bentley and myself. We are looking forward
to a quiet time at home, at my home, that is, for Bentley and his mother live
with my sister and myself. My sister and Bentley's sister are running a
hospital there, and I have no doubt they can make room for us all. Now, listen
to me, Gordon; I am not going to take any refusal. We both like you very much;
in fact, we have discussed you a good many times, and we have come to the
conclusion that you are much too good a fellow to be knocking about the world
all by yourself. I shall be greatly disappointed if you don't come with us. You
are one of the lonely soldiers they are making such a fuss about in the
papers."</p>
<p>Gordon's rather melancholy face lighted up with a gleam of amusement.</p>
<p>"I am that," he said. "I was ass enough to write a letter to one of the
London papers advertising the fact and inviting correspondence. That was a
month ago."</p>
<p>"And you had many replies, of course?" Bentley asked.</p>
<p>Gordon burst into a hearty laugh.</p>
<p>"I should think I had," he said. "I had no idea there was so much
spontaneous kindness in the world. I must have had at least three hundred
replies. They came from all sorts and conditions of people, and I have got
invitations to stay in houses from ducal castles downwards. I had enough
cigarettes and provisions to keep any platoon living on the fat of the land for
a month. I had to tip the man who brought up my letters. Inadvertently I have
raised an impression that I am a poor Tommy; hence all those parcels, which I
didn't want. But, mind you, it touched me very much all the same. It did me
good, because I was getting hard and cynical, which I may say is by no means my
nature. And that is why I am going to avail myself of your hospitality. I will
come with you with pleasure. The word Christmas conveys nothing to me, for my
Christmases have always been spent in lodgings, or alone in a farm miles away
from civilisation. I should like for once to sit down on Christmas Day amongst
friendly faces."</p>
<p>"That's all right," Kemp said. "We regard the matter as settled. See you
again on Saturday."</p>
<p>With that Kemp and Bentley went off to their quarters feeling like two
schoolboys just before the holidays. The way to their lines led them through
the angle of a wood where stood a small red cottage inhabited by a widow
peasant woman who had stayed there all through the trouble, and who appeared to
gain a precarious livelihood by selling such produce as was left to her by the
troops and supplying them with coffee. She appeared to be utterly indifferent
to everything that was going on around her, and for the rest her spare time was
devoted to her only child, an infant in arms, of whom she seemed to be
devotedly fond. In her way, mother Mary, as the men called her, was a
favourite. She was standing at the cottage door, as Kemp and Bentley passed,
and she wished them good afternoon.</p>
<h2><a id="chap41" name="chap41">XLI - INSIDE THE COTTAGE</a></h2>
<p class="first">She was a little woman of about middle age, picturesque,
essentially French and quiet in her manner. But it was not Mother Mary that
attracted Bentley's attention just at that moment, for down a little path
leading to the side of the cottage appeared a figure that was familiar both to
Kemp and Bentley, a figure they had not seen for some time.</p>
<p>"Why it's Venables!" Kemp cried. "What on earth are you doing here, and
where do you come from?"</p>
<p>The American offered his cigarette case.</p>
<p>"As a matter of fact," he said, "I was looking for you fellows. I want to
have a little conversation with you."</p>
<p>"You had better come over to our hut," Kemp said. "I don't suppose anybody
will be there at this time in the afternoon. Besides, the cavalry have got some
sort of a show on this afternoon, and everybody will be there. But you haven't
told me how you got here, and where you came from. To tell you the truth,
Venables, you are a bit of a mystery to us, and I'm not quite sure if I ought
not to ask you to report yourself to the authorities and explain your
movements. Mind you, I'm not suggesting that there's anything wrong with you;
and I'm not forgetting that the Musketeers owe you more than one good turn; but
you must admit that a chap who seems able to hop backwards and forwards and who
is equally friendly with both sides, is bound to be more or less an object of
suspicion."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't worry about that if I were you," Venables said. "You are at
perfect liberty to take me to Headquarters if you like, but if you do you will
only be told to mind your own business. Still, I have been intimate with one of
you at home; you have been very kind and hospitable to me, and I owe you
something like an explanation. Only you must promise me that it goes no
farther. I know you're not quite sure whether I'm an American or not, but I can
assure you that I am, and I can easily prove it if necessary. But I am
something more than a journalist. When the war broke out the Germans couldn't
do enough for the Americans, and when I applied for permission to represent my
paper in the firing line I was welcomed with open arms in Berlin. But those
people didn't know what I'm going to tell you now. They didn't know that for
five or six years I have been an agent in your Secret Service and that it is my
work to find out all about the German conspiracy to capture America. You don't
know, of course, that for years past Germany has been sending something like a
million emigrants to the States every year, and though your Foreign Office is
not suspicious, they are not blind to the fact. And this is where I came in. Of
course, those Germans are supposed to become American citizens, but once a
German always a German, and you can see where their sympathies would be. This
has been going on for years, and when I point out to you that most of those
emigrants are military-trained you can see where the danger lies. At this
moment there must be millions of trained Germans in America, a country that has
no navy, comparatively speaking, and practically no army. The German idea was
to capture America, which would have been no difficult matter if the present
campaign hadn't broken down. But there's nothing to worry about now, because
the American Government is alive to the danger, and their understanding with
the British Government is more complete than you imagine. But this isn't what I
want to talk about. I am supposed to be heart and soul in the German cause, and
those fellows have no idea of my real sentiments. They are under the impression
that I have been taken prisoner once or twice and that my native cunning has
saved me on each occasion. But that is not the fact; I have allowed myself to
be taken prisoner, I have gone out of my way to bring it about. And that's why
I was able to do you so good a turn in the big retreat."</p>
<p>"I believe he's telling the truth," Bentley said.</p>
<p>"Search me," Venables responded. "Of course I'm telling you the truth. Don't
forget what happened when I asked to see your brigadier on a certain eventful
occasion. I had no difficulty in satisfying him of my bona fides."</p>
<p>"It's a jolly dangerous game," Kemp said.</p>
<p>Venables looked serious just for a moment.</p>
<p>"You're right there," he said. "It is a dangerous game. But I love
excitement and adventure, and after all thousands are doing the same thing. If
ever I get found out they will shove me up against a wall and shoot me. But a
man can only die once, and there's an end of it. And this brings me to my
point. I have had a good deal of experience in this sort of thing lately, and I
can assure you that the foreign spy who takes his life in his hands and makes a
profession of it is nothing like as dangerous as the dirty traitor who poses as
an honest patriot and sells his country for money. There are thousands of these
about; in fact, they are the curse of every nation. And they are not always men
either. As a rule, they are the very last people to be suspected."</p>
<p>"Are you on the track of one now?" Bentley asked.</p>
<p>"I am," Venables said. "And a precious cunning one, too. Let me tell you,
you chaps are mere children compared to the Germans at this game. Now, for some
little time past, practically everything of importance that happens here has
got through to the foe. No regiment is moved up without it being known to the
German lines. And it's my business to discover how the information leaks out.
For days and nights I have watched to see if anything in the shape of a spy
came through, and nothing suspicious did I see. I was forced at last to
conclude that it was done by telephone. Long before the war began, sections of
telephone wires were laid underground all over northern France and their
position carefully noted on charts. During the last week or two I must have
spotted and cut at least a dozen of these myself. They are in houses and woods
and barns and underground drains and all that kind of thing. I think I have
located the one I am after now. I wouldn't mind betting you fifty dollars that
the instrument at this end of the telephone is in yonder little red
cottage."</p>
<p>"Impossible," Kemp cried. "The woman there is the widow of a French soldier.
I am sure she is a patriot if ever there was one. The poor woman hangs on here
because she has nowhere else to go. She makes some sort of a living by selling
odds and ends to the troops, and her coffee is the best in the neighbourhood.
She and her baby live alone there in the cottage."</p>
<p>Venables eyes twinkled shrewdly.</p>
<p>"Oh, she's got a baby, has she?" he asked. "A dear little thing that lies
quietly in its cradle on the cottage floor, all day, eh! Very sad and pathetic,
isn't it? And I suppose the unsuspecting Tommy thinks a lot of the woman, and
calls her mother and all the rest of it. If you don't mind I'd like to walk
down as far as the cottage and have a look round. I am a friend of yours, of
course, and you have been telling me all about the delicious coffee. You
understand."</p>
<p>"All right," Bentley said. "But you are after the wrong fox this time. But
come along."</p>
<p>In the door of the cottage stood the woman herself with a pitcher of freshly
made coffee in her hand. She was pleased to see the English gentlemen she said,
for they had always been her good friends. Would she make them some coffee? Of
course she would if they would only wait for five minutes till she came back;
and keep an eye upon her baby, the dear little one asleep in her cot. Directly
she had gone Venables advanced into the cottage and lifted the sleeping child
in his arms.</p>
<p>"What do you think of this?" he asked.</p>
<p>"By Jove!" Kemp cried; "a telephone receiver!"</p>
<h2><a id="chap42" name="chap42">XLII - THE HIDDEN BATTERY</a></h2>
<p class="first">A sudden change seemed to have come over Venables. He was no
longer the light-hearted, easy-going war correspondent, cheerfully taking his
life in his hands and devoted to the interests of his paper, but a keen and
eager individual with important work in hand.</p>
<p>"One of you stand in the doorway," he said, "and try and look as if you are
just hanging about there till the woman comes back. This is the thing that I
have been looking for for a long time. I suppose I have located at least a half
a dozen of these during the last week, but I knew that there was one that had
evaded me, and behold, here it is. You can see for yourselves how cleverly it
has been arranged. The wire comes up under the floor boards, and you will
notice how cunningly the instrument has been concealed in the false bottom of
this old oak cradle. The other receiver, unless I am greatly mistaken, is in a
wood not far behind the place where your trenches were. And from there again it
will go underground back to one of the German batteries. Now what we have to do
is to locate that German battery."</p>
<p>"I think I know the one you mean," Kemp said. "It is a battery that has
given us a great deal of trouble, and, try as they would, our airmen could not
find it. You don't mean to tell me that this ignorant peasant woman knows
enough to be able to communicate with those guns?"</p>
<p>"I'm not so sure she's an ignorant woman," Venables said. "I should say she
is French, beyond all doubt, and she appears to be no more than a peasant. Now
do you happen to know how long she has been here?"</p>
<p>"I haven't the slightest idea," Bentley said. "'From what I can understand
she has lived in this cottage for years. She is rather a favourite with the men
here, who regard her as being exceedingly plucky to stick to her cottage when
everybody else has gone. She is in danger here."</p>
<p>"Not she," Venables laughed. "She has no occasion to be frightened of you
chaps, and she need not fear the Germans. The only thing she has to worry about
is a chance shell. But she is probably being paid handsomely for this work, and
can afford to take the risk. Now, I don't know, of course, but I wouldn't mind
making a small bet that this woman has come into the neighbourhood during the
last year or two. You can make enquiries if you like; that is, if any of the
original inhabitants are still about. My idea is that she is a regular German
spy, and that she was placed in this cottage a few years ago for this very
purpose. There are hundreds of such creatures in Northern France. But when you
come to think of it, the whole scheme is not very difficult. Whoever dreamt two
years ago that to-day Germany would be holding the whole of Belgium, and a part
of Northern France? And who would suspect a workman who was seen digging a
trench across a field or two? People would suppose that he was putting in a
drain. Then all he has to do is to hide those wires in small pipes and have
manholes at certain places, just as you see on the ordinary sewage system. I
tell you, Germany worked this matter out to the last detail. You chaps are mere
children by comparison."</p>
<p>"We'll admit all that," Kemp said. "You see, we haven't spent all the last
forty years thinking about it. The question is, what are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"For the moment I am going to wait and watch," Venables said. "The woman
herself is a mere blind. She gives the whole thing an air of reality. But it is
not she who sends the messages. We'll just conceal ourselves in the wood yonder
and wait. And before long I'll astonish you."</p>
<p>With that Venables left the cottage, followed by the other two, and
proceeded to some undergrowth in the wood from which it was possible to keep a
close eye on the cottage. A few moments later the woman came back, apparently
quite unsuspicious, and entered the house. At the end of a quarter of an hour
the figure of a man in khaki came down the road and hailed the cottage in
excellent English. Then the woman came to the door and the man with the British
uniform went inside.</p>
<p>"Did you spot his regiment?" Venables asked.</p>
<p>"I did," Kemp said. "He is apparently one of the Grenadier Guards. You don't
mean to say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"No, I don't," Venables replied: "You can disabuse your mind of the idea
that one of your own men is in this business, and I will make you a present of
the fact that that man's English is as good as yours or mine. But all the same
he is a German, as you will see presently."</p>
<p>"But the audacity of it!" Bentley exclaimed. "The thing sounds
incredible."</p>
<p>"That's just why it's possible," Venables said coolly. "There was a man in a
Highland regiment yesterday in one of the canteens asking for hot water. I
happened to spot him, and I had him followed. He was a Bavarian in a line
regiment, and he recognised at once that the game was up. He was a brave chap,
too, and he died like a man. But we needn't trouble about that just now. Our
friend in the Grenadier Guards' uniform at the present moment is sending
certain information to the front. Now when he comes out of the cottage I want
you fellows to follow him. It is too risky for me to go, because he may have
seen me in the German lines. I think you will find that he will make his way
into the wood, where his comrade is listening at the other end of the
telephone. But here he comes. You'll have to be cautious, and I will come on
behind as near as I dare."</p>
<p>For the best part of an hour Kemp and Bentley dogged the footsteps of the
spy along the road and across the fields, until he entered the wood about a
mile or so behind the trenches where the Musketeers had fought for so long.
There was plenty of thick cover here, and it was possible to get close up
behind the German and watch his movements from a distance of a few yards. But
the man was taking no risks. For some time he looked cautiously around him, and
then he proceeded to remove a heap of dead brushwood that hid a hole in the
ground. From where they were standing Kemp and Bentley looked directly down
into the cavity. Below them was a circular hole lined with concrete, a snug
enough retreat for the man who sat there with the telephone receiver in his
hand. A moment. or two later he put down the instrument and crawled out of the
hole. He stretched himself with the air of a man who is cramped and tired.</p>
<p>"I have been waiting for you for a long time," he said in excellent English.
"I am glad you have come, for I could make nothing of your last message. I
think something has gone wrong with the transmitter."</p>
<p>This was true enough, for Venables had seen to that. It had been part of his
scheme.</p>
<p>"All right," the other man said. "I'll stay here while you go back and put
it right. Is there any news?"</p>
<p>"I think so," the other said. "I understand that the British are falling
back just here with the view to straightening out their line. If that is the
case we shall have to bring up our battery another half-mile or so."</p>
<p>The men changed places, and the one who had been working the telephone
turned his face in the direction of the British lines. He had not gone 10 yards
before Kemp and Bentley were upon him.</p>
<p>He threw up his hands and shrugged his shoulders. A quarter of an hour later
the two spies, disarmed and helpless, were being marched to the base. Once they
were in safe hands Venables appeared again.</p>
<p>"That was very smart," he said. "I know those two chaps well. They were in
America two years ago."</p>
<h2><a id="chap43" name="chap43">XLII - HOMEWARD BOUND</a></h2>
<p class="first">"What are you going to do now?" Bentley asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, the rest is easy," Venables said. "Now that I know exactly where we
stand, I am going to take the place of the man who is working the telephone,
and send information that I want to convey to the battery. I'm not quite sure,
but I think this battery is hidden in an old sandpit and our game of course is
to get them out. If they believe that we are abandoning those front trenches,
it will be useless for them to stay where they are, and once they begin to move
we can smash them all up."</p>
<p>It was an hour or two later before Venables was ready to put his plan in
execution. With his knowledge of German and the exact position it was not
difficult for him to transmit to the German battery exactly what he wished them
to believe. At the same time he could work the telephone back to the base into
the woman's cottage which had now been taken over by the British authorities,
and warn them that he had been successful in deceiving the officer in charge of
the German battery. All he wanted now was an observation on the part of the
British airmen, so that every movement of the battery could be watched and the
guns destroyed by British fire. There was no hitch, and about an hour later the
German guns that had been such a thorn in the side of the British for the past
week or two began to crawl out of their shelter, disguised as hay carts, and
made their way forward to another sheltered spot which had been carefully
prepared with a view to an advance.</p>
<p>Scarcely had they emerged into the open when a British aeroplane shot up
from the lines and hovered like a hawk over the battery. Then certain signals
were made, and almost before the Germans knew what had happened the English
field guns opened fire upon them. From the very first shot the fire was deadly.
The initial shell dropped into the centre of them, followed by another, and
another, until the German guns were scattered and broken, and not a single man
in charge of them was left. It was only one of the small incidents of war, but
it was exceedingly exciting while it lasted, especially to Kemp and Bentley,
who stood at the edge of the wood watching the whole thing with breathless
interest. It was all over and finished within less time than it takes to tell,
and there were not more than a dozen people down at the base who knew anything
about it. But it was something for Bentley and Kemp to look back upon when they
started on their holiday. Venables pointed out that there must be no discussion
of the subject amongst the Musketeers.</p>
<p>"Somebody had to know about this business," he said, "and by good luck it
happened to be you two. I don't suppose there are half a dozen people at the
base who will know what has become of that old woman. There are only one or two
people who are aware how it happened that that German battery came out into the
open. Even the aviator who spotted them does not know that he was sent up on
purpose to find the battery which was already there before he started. He is
hugging himself with the delusion that he has done an exceedingly smart piece
of work. You see, men who do what I do have to work entirely in the dark, and
if any of the people here got to know what my occupation is, more than half my
utility would be gone. Besides, there are so many spies hanging about that it
would be sure to come to their ears, and the next time I showed my face inside
the German lines I should be greeted with a bullet. So you see my life is more
or less in the hands of you two, and I'd rather trust you than any Englishmen I
know. So please be good enough to forget that you have ever seen me, and that
you know anything about this telephone business."</p>
<p>"You can rely entirely upon us," Bentley said. "And thank you for a most
exciting afternoon. It was fine to see the way we smashed up that German
battery; it was a sight that I would not have missed for anything. But what are
you going to do now? Won't you come and have some supper with us? As we're
leaving for home to-morrow, we've got rather a special spread."</p>
<p>Venables shook his head regretfully.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I can't do it," he said. "Just for the moment I have finished my
work, and I have a very delicate task in front of me. By this time to-morrow I
shall be back again in the German lines, and goodness knows when we shall meet
again."</p>
<p>He shook hands, and disappeared in the direction of the village. The others
watched him out of sight.</p>
<p>"That's a queer chap," Bentley said. "And it's a queer sort of life he's
leading."</p>
<p>"I rather envy him," Kemp replied. "You can't say his is not a strenuous
existence. I should think that Venables would be able to write a most
interesting book on his adventures. There's something fine in a man taking his
life in his hands like that. He doesn't appear to have a nerve in his body. I
hope he will come out all right. It's a queer sort of world, old chap, and
there are queer ways of getting a living. When I first met Venables and played
golf with him I never dreamt that he was leading a life such as novelists write
about."</p>
<p>It was a fine, still evening, and a lively party gathered in Kemp and
Bentley's hut to partake of a farewell supper. They were a select gathering in
a way, but Ginger and George and the rest of them were there, frankly envious
of the good fortune of their comrades.</p>
<p>"Not but wot I've 'ad my time," Ginger said. "The week or two I spent at
'ome was like a dream to me. I've read in pipers an' books all about them lucky
chaps wot's picked up in the streets an' taken to 'ospitals, where they've been
waited upon as if they'd been a lot o' bally dooks, an' then sent down to
plices like Margate and Southend to get well, but I never believed it was true;
I thought it was all a sort o' gime, made up by them chaps wot write for the
pipers. But some o' you chaps knows as wot it's true, because you've been
through it yourselves. You knows wot it is to be waited on 'and and foot by
real lidies, an' tiken to foitball matches in a motor car. It seems like a
regular dream to me, but it's a dream I don't want ter forget an' wot I'll
remember to my dying day. But George an' Joe, they knows all abaht that. An'
before we says good-bye to our mates to-night I'd like to drink the 'ealth of
Miss Kemp an' Miss Bentley an' the other lidies wot went out o' their way to
make life pleasant for us poor blokes."</p>
<p>"Regular orator, ain't 'e?" asked George.</p>
<p>"It's only becorse me 'eart's full," Ginger said. "When I think of them
angels, an' wot they did for me, I can't be grateful enough. It's all very well
to say as we're all pals 'ere, but there's a difference, an' a gentleman's a
gentleman all the world over, even though 'e does wear a number on 'is shoulder
and gets ordered abaht by a sargeant wot at one time was perhaps a groom in 'is
own stable. But it's all in the day's work, an' all for the glory of the old
flag. An' there ain't nobody who appreciates the difference more'n us blokes
round 'ere who used to caddy for them. So if you don't mind, gentlemen, perhaps
you'll give our kindest regards to the lidies. God bless 'em, and tell 'em as
we're still 'ere playin' the gime, an' we ain't forgot all their kindness to
us. There may be others 'ere as'll get wounded, an' if they do, all the 'arm I
wish 'em is that when they gets 'ome they'll find theirselves in the Keep 'Ouse
'Ospital bein' looked after by Miss Kemp an' Miss Bentley an' all the rest o'
the lidies there."</p>
<p>"There, that'll do, Ginger," Kemp said. "We'll tell the ladies what you say,
and no one knows better than we do that you mean it. And now let's join hands
and sing 'Auld Lang Syne' before they come round for lights out."</p>
<h2><a id="chap44" name="chap44">XLIV - THE NEW LONDON</a></h2>
<p class="first">The favoured Musketeers made their way slowly down to the
coast in cattle trucks and wagons attached to returning munition trains. As
they went along they picked up others here and there, until by the time Havre
was reached they numbered something like fifteen hundred altogether. It
mattered nothing that the weather was abominable and that the journey proceeded
in a perfect downpour of rain; they were used to all this; the trenches had
hardened them against weather of all sorts, and, besides, they were going home.
That word would have meant a good deal to many of them in ordinary conditions;
now it had a peculiar significance all its own. And there was not one of them
who did not feel that he was earning his holiday.</p>
<p>There were some amongst them, of course, who were fighters by instinct, men
who had served with the colours in all parts of the world, professional
soldiers to whom all countries are more or less alike so long as they draw
their pay and have sufficient to eat and drink. But there were many others,
Territorials and volunteers, who a few brief months ago had never dreamt of the
coming strife. They had come out of all walks in life; the country gentleman
from his old family home, with its almost sacred ties, leaving his dogs and his
sport and all that goes to make up most that is pleasant in life; and his
tenants and the sons of his tenants, his game-keeper and the labourers from his
estate; and others who had earned their bread by hard, monotonous labour in
workshops and factories.</p>
<p>To all of them this adventure had fallen out of the skies. They were not
soldiers by compulsion either. The call had come to them, and they had heard it
and there had been no occasion to blow the bugle twice. They were the best and
brightest that England could produce, men who had not waited for the wave of
patriotism to sweep them forward, but keen, bright spirits who had come along
in front of it. They were people to whom England would ever owe the deepest
debt of gratitude. For they were the pioneers, the leaders who showed the way
so that in the course of time three million others followed, and they had not
to be fetched.</p>
<p>And now they were going back again for a brief space, back to the mansion
and the cottage, back to the open country and the close clustering houses in
the great northern towns, every man of them a hero just as if he were carrying
the Victoria Cross on his breast. Yet there was not one of them who had a word
to say about his own particular exploits.</p>
<p>Kemp and Bentley stood on the deck of the Dog Star and watched the shores of
France receding in the distance. It was as if they had left all troubles and
dangers behind. The deck was crowded with all sorts and conditions of men, from
commanding officers downwards, all looking forward to their Christmas holiday.
There was no distinction between them there; officers and men were mixed up
together, comparing notes and exchanging experiences and all in the best of
spirits.</p>
<p>"There isn't much the matter with the old country, after all," Bentley said,
"I must confess that I had my doubts at one time. I can't recollect much about
the Boer war, but it never seemed to me that we had much to be proud of there.
There were too many 'regrettable incidents,' and too many unnecessary
surrenders. I may be wrong, but that's my reading of the history of the
war."</p>
<p>A lean, long captain in a line regiment sitting on a camp stool close by
turned in the speaker's direction. He appeared to be a man over old for
service, for his hair was grey and there were deep lines about his face. But
his eyes were keen, and there was a row of ribbons across his left breast. He
realised that the men by his side were gentlemen, and without further
hesitation he plunged into conversation with them.</p>
<p>"I was in the Boer war myself," he said. "I was there from the start till
peace was declared, and I came through without a single scratch. I was at
Ladysmith and Pardeburg; indeed, I missed very few of the big engagements. In
my opinion we never took that war seriously enough, not even when Roberts and
Kitchener went out. England knew from the first that it was a dead certainty.
But we did find some good men there and we are benefiting from the experience
now. Don't forget that a large proportion of the men out at the front at the
present moment fought under French in the Boer war. And there isn't a man who
hasn't the greatest confidence in him. They know what a born leader he is, and
how careful he is of their welfare. In my humble opinion the Boer war was an
awakening to Great Britain. On the battle fields of South Africa we found the
spirit which we had lost, or mislaid, if you like the expression better. You
mustn't forget that this is our first big experience since the Crimea; don't
forget that our first army is the only one in the world that has ever been
under fire, with the exception perhaps of the Balkan States, which by
comparison is another matter. You know what we've done; that is, if you have
been out long enough to see."</p>
<p>"We've been out since the beginning of September," Kemp said. "We are
Musketeers."</p>
<p>"Then I congratulate you," the other man said. "You know all about it."</p>
<p>"We have been in all the big engagements," Bentley observed. "I don't think
we've missed anything."</p>
<p>"Then I won't enlarge upon the topic," the man who had been through the Boer
war said. "We don't boast about it, but we know what we've done. We steadied
the French down, and bore the brunt of it until their chaps found their feet.
They are all right now, and they will cover themselves with credit, but at
first, when they were new to the game, and when the Germans came down in such
overwhelming force, it was touch and go for a few days, just like it was on
more than one occasion in South Africa. You see, it's absurd to talk about
veteran troops unless the men have been under fire. They must be supported by a
man who has been through the mill, and that is where our chaps came in so
useful when von Kluck was in front of Paris. I never thought I should fight
again, but I volunteered directly the war broke out and left my place in the
north to go and fight."</p>
<p>"Did they give you a commission?" Bentley asked.</p>
<p>"They couldn't very well help it," the other man laughed. "For a fortnight I
was in a Territorial regiment as a Tommy. I slept on bare boards the whole time
and shared their food. I thought I was too old to get a commission, but they
found me out and sent me to a depot to help train recruits. There must be
thousands like me who have gone through the same thing."</p>
<h2><a id="chap45" name="chap45">XLV - HOME, SWEET HOME</a></h2>
<p class="first">Kemp and Bentley parted from their pleasant acquaintance at
Waterloo station with a promise to meet him a day or two later and dine with
him at his club. He turned out to be a well-known North of England sportsman,
and, moreover, had been at their old school. When he mentioned his name they
recognised him as a one time captain of the cricket eleven, and a bat who had
done duty for England on more than one occasion.</p>
<p>"Fancy running up against him," Kemp said. "Now, what are we going to do?
Have you got anything in view, Gordon, before you come along with us?"</p>
<p>"Not I," Gordon said. "Of course, I must go to my bank, and I want to see my
solicitor. As soon as that's done I am entirely at your service. And of course
I shall have to pack a bag with some clothes. I suppose we shall be allowed to
get out of these uniforms for the time we are here?"</p>
<p>"I don't see why we shouldn't," Kemp said. "These clothes are all very well,
but they are not the sort of thing to dine in. Now, the first thing I'm going
to do is to go along to my club and have a Turkish bath and get a change of
linen."</p>
<p>"Do your people know that I am coming?" Gordon asked.</p>
<p>"Really, it doesn't matter whether they know or not," Kemp said. "As a
matter of fact, they don't. You needn't look so astonished. They don't know
we're coming at all so far as that goes. Bentley and myself thought it would be
a pleasant surprise. We'll just drop down after tea and take them unawares.
When we have had a change and a wash I vote we go and have lunch at the
Imperial or some other place up West. Won't it be strange to sit down to a
table again to a civilised meal!"</p>
<p>There were other things that struck the trio as strange besides the
luxurious luncheon they enjoyed a little later on. Somehow London appeared to
be different. There were the same crowds in the street, and the shops looked
much as usual, but there was an extraordinary absence of young men everywhere.
Kemp pulled up in Regent-street and remarked on the fact.</p>
<p>"Where are all the boys?" he asked. "I didn't think they'd all joined the
army. And yet, with the exception of the men in the shops, and the clerks, I
can't see any of them."</p>
<p>Almost as Kemp spoke the traffic in the street drew on one side and down the
road came a battalion connected with some new regiment, swinging along with
their heads up and fully conscious of the impression they were making. It was
quite evident that these recruits were new to their khaki, and they were
without rifles or side arms, but there was no mistake about their physique.
They were young for the most part, men between twenty and thirty, but as to
their quality there could only be one opinion. They had been in training long
enough to be welded together, and, despite the fact that they had no band, they
swung along in perfect step, as fine a twelve hundred as it would be possible
for any country in the world to produce.</p>
<p>"That's ripping good stuff," Bentley said. "Some of our Territorials out
yonder are all right, but they are not quite so fine as those chaps yonder. Who
are they?"</p>
<p>An elderly man looking on gave the desired information.</p>
<p>"Kitchener's army," he said. "I don't rightly know what regiment they belong
to, but they come from the north, and they have been training in one of the
parks here. Makes you feel proud of your fellow-countrymen, doesn't it? And
they're not the pick of the basket, either. There are millions like 'em. Mean
to say you haven't seen them before?"</p>
<p>"We haven't had a chance," Gordon said.</p>
<p>"Oh, I see, you're just back from the front, are you? Well, when you return
you can tell the men out yonder what you've seen. Say that, good as French's
army is, better is coming. Say that in three or four months' time we are going
to send you something like three million of the same pattern as those fellows
in the road there. Most of them are steady married men, who have left their
wives and families to fight for the flag. When I see a sight like that I forget
all my doubts and fears, I forget about the slackers and the fools who prate
about peace with Germany, because I know it's all right."</p>
<p>The speaker jammed his hat firmly on his head and went his way.</p>
<p>"That's very comforting," Bentley said. "I'm glad I saw that every third man
we meet is wearing uniform. This is still the good old England that we're all
so proud of, and it's evident that the heart is in the right place still. Come
on now, I shall enjoy my luncheon all the better for this."</p>
<p>They lunched luxuriously with a zest and appetite such as neither of them
had ever known before. Then they passed the afternoon at a matinee, and just
after dark made their way by taxi down to the Keep House.</p>
<p>The place was one mass of lights, and every room appeared to be occupied. As
they entered the hall Dorothy Kemp came out of what had been the drawing-room
with a tray in her hand. She nearly dropped it when she saw them standing
there.</p>
<p>"Harold!" she cried. "And Ronald, too! This is more than a surprise. What
does it mean?"</p>
<p>"It means that we have been good boys, and the head-master has sent us home
for a holiday," Kemp explained. "And, what's more, we shall be here over
Christmas. I suppose you can find room for us somewhere? This is our friend,
Ian Gordon, one of our company. He hasn't anywhere to go to, and I told him
that you would be glad to see him here."</p>
<p>There was no occasion for Dorothy to say so, for Gordon could read a welcome
in her shining eyes and in the pressure of her hand. A moment or two later Mrs.
Bentley and Nettie also appeared. There was not much said, for the occasion did
not call for words. There was not much room for them, either, for the house was
full of wounded, but, as Kemp said, any place would be good enough for them;
they could shake down in the garage or the stable, either of which would be
luxurious quarters in comparison to what they had been accustomed to.</p>
<p>"I don't think it will be as bad as that," Mrs. Bentley smiled. "We read in
the papers that occasionally some of the men at the front were allowed to come
home, and we prepared a bedroom at the top of the house for you two, and also
for a friend or two. You will find everything you want up there. And I don't
suppose you will mind dining with us and the nurses. We are very busy and very
happy here, more like brothers and sisters than anything else. And when I tell
you that Royalty has been here you can imagine how proud we are of our work.
Every nurse is a friend of one of the girls, and they are working splendidly.
You must come round and see our patients presently."</p>
<p>It was comparatively late in the evening before Bentley got a chance of a
few quiet words with Dorothy. There was a little room at the end of the
corridor used as an office, and there they sat alone.</p>
<p>"It's good to be back here like this again," Bentley said. "I can't tell you
how glad I am to see you. To-morrow I'll tell you all about our adventures, but
I don't want to talk about them tonight. I want to forget everything except
that I am back here. You are happy in your work?"</p>
<p>"Oh, indeed I am," Dorothy said. "Really, I don't know what we should have
done without it. It enables us to forget all the worry and anxiety, and when
night comes we are too tired to do anything but sleep. We are all friends here,
too; there are more than a dozen of us who a few months ago thought about
nothing but amusement. And I'm glad to say there isn't one of my friends who
wouldn't take her share in the good work."</p>
<p>"A fine work," Bentley exclaimed. "How fine, I don't believe even you people
realised."</p>
<h2><a id="chap46" name="chap46">XV - THE DEEPER MEANING</a></h2>
<p class="first">It was little that the returned Musketeers needed in the way
of amusement or recreation just now, for it was only when the bow was relaxed
that they began to realise the strain which they had gone through. The mere
fact that they had nothing to do was in itself a luxury after all that they had
gone through. It seemed strange, too, to sleep the night through and wake in
the morning to luxury and comfort. Indeed, at first, this had been rather a
difficult matter, but at the end of two or three days they were getting into
it, and it was only then that they began to discuss their past experiences.
After all, there seemed to be nothing to say, and the things that Nettie and
Dorothy followed with breathless interest had become to them the mere
commonplaces of everyday life.</p>
<p>"You see, there are so many of them doing it," Bentley told Dorothy. "If our
men out there were properly rewarded the Victoria Cross would be as common as
the Iron Cross of Germany. Occasionally some incident stands out more brightly
than the rest by reason of its dramatic surroundings. Then it gets into the
papers and everybody begins to talk about it. But the lucky man himself knows
perfectly well that he is merely one of a crowd, and takes it all for granted.
Now, I'll tell you a little thing that happened to me that did not get into the
papers, and never will now. It was about two months ago, when we were being
hard pressed one night. The Germans were absolutely on the top of us, indeed
they were in our trench, and had they been properly supported I should not be
here telling you this story at the present moment. Those chaps had taken us
entirely by surprise; they had badly cut up some of our fellows the day before
and they were wearing our uniform. They were led by a man who spoke excellent
English, and we were all utterly deceived. It was not till they were absolutely
in the trench that we discovered what was going on. Just before they charged
they threw about a dozen hand grenades into the trench, and it was that that
gave them away. One of those grenades lay right at my feet without exploding,
and I had no idea that it was there. But the man next to me stooped and picked
it up and stood there with the beastly thing in his hand. If it had exploded
then it would have blown him all into little bits. And no one knew that better
than himself. But he waited with it in his hand till a dozen or more Germans
appeared on the edge of the trench and then he threw the grenade in the middle
of them. A second or two later there wasn't one of those Germans left. The man
I am talking about, and one other, drove them back with their own bombs, and
about ten minutes later we had their trench instead of them having ours. This
doesn't sound much in cold blood, but if you'll think it over you will see that
it wants some doing."</p>
<p>Dorothy's eyes gleaned as she listened.</p>
<p>"I should like to meet that man," she said.</p>
<p>"You have met him," Bentley said quietly. "He was one of the wounded we sent
over here a month or two ago. He was the hero of that football match I was
telling you about, and he is commonly known amongst us as George. You remember
him."</p>
<p>"Oh, I do," Dorothy exclaimed. "I remember all of them. I hope some time we
shall see them again."</p>
<p>"I tell you this just as an ordinary instance of the things that happen
every day out yonder. And I can tell you another story of a man who regarded
himself as a coward. As a matter of fact he wasn't anything of the kind, but he
thought he was because he had the most vivid imagination. He was a chap who
couldn't sleep and couldn't eat, the type of man who crouches down every time
he hears a shell. But he wasn't a coward, and all of us knew it, though he must
have undergone the tortures of hell every time he went under fire. Take it one
way and another perhaps he is the bravest man I ever met. He was a gunner.
Well, one night his gun managed to blunder right into the German lines and was
abandoned there. It was left in a barn, and the Germans were shelling the barn
all the time. The driver had been killed and one of the horses too. In the
early dawn that man forced himself to go back to the barn under heavy fire and
managed to bring that gun away. He was wounded in two places, but he got back
to our lines all right. He is somewhere in England to-day, and I hope that we
may meet again."</p>
<p>All these things and more Bentley told Dorothy as they sat in the little
office discussing the future. Only four or five days remained of the holiday
now, and they were making the most of their time. Kemp was somewhere with
Nettie Bentley and Gordon had struck up more than a friendship with a little
golden-haired girl who was assistant to one of the nurses.</p>
<p>"I like your friend, Mr. Gordon," Dorothy said. "And I am so glad you
brought him here. It seems a shame that a nice man like that should have no
friends."</p>
<p>"He seems to have one now," Bentley laughed. "Like most quiet,
self-contained men, he has a good deal of feeling, and I am much mistaken if
most of those feelings are not concentrated upon your friend, Miss Nellie
Somers."</p>
<p>"So you've noticed that?" Dorothy asked.</p>
<p>"I should have been blind if I hadn't. I never saw a man more hopelessly
smitten. He went down before those blue eyes at the first glance. She's a dear
little girl, too, and will make any man a good wife. But what's the use of a
fellow thinking about that kind of thing just now? Of course I know its the
fashionable thing to do. I know that hundreds of officers have married recently
and gone to the front after a few hours' honeymoon. But is it right, is it fair
to a girl? You see, so many of them will soon be widows; indeed, a lot of them
are widows already. It doesn't strike me as playing the game to marry a girl
and leave her to her fate, so to speak, with all the future before her. But, of
course, there must be two sides to the question, and people might say that I
have no right to speak seeing that I am in no position to keep a wife myself.
Don't you agree with me Dorothy?"</p>
<p>Dorothy looked up with a demure light in her eyes.</p>
<p>"I don't think I do," she said. "It may be romantic perhaps, but I think
there is something fine in the idea of a girl giving herself to a man who is
fighting for his country. Even if he gets killed, as so many of them will, she
has always the consolation of knowing that she married a hero. And as to not
being able to keep a wife, that is rather a commonplace argument, especially in
a case like mine where I have a good deal of money of any own."</p>
<p>Bentley caught his breath sharply.</p>
<p>"Do you really mean that?" he asked.</p>
<p>Dorothy met his glance steadily.</p>
<p>"I do, Harold," she said. "It may sound audacious on my part, but I do mean
it. If this war was over to-morrow you would marry me almost at once. It
matters nothing that you have no money; what can it matter when I have enough
for two?"</p>
<p>"And you would be happier if I made you my wife before I went back to the
front?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Dorothy said. "I may be wrong, but it seems to me the right thing.
There never will be anybody else but you. And there are other questions I
cannot discuss. I know, too, that Ronald is going to ask Nettie to marry him,
and if Mr. Gordon is in earnest we might have three weddings. Are you very
angry with me for making the suggestion? Does it strike you as being bold and
unmaidenly on my part?"</p>
<h2><a id="chap47" name="chap47">XLVII - BACK TO THE FRONT</a></h2>
<p class="first">Exactly how the whole thing came about it would have been
difficult for any of the three friends to say. It seemed to be the most natural
thing in the world, and there was not a nurse in the house who did not regard
it as the proper thing. Indeed, the little girl with the golden hair frankly
declared that she had gone out of her way to propose to Ian Gordon, a
suggestion that he repudiated with great indignation. But the fact remained
that he and Nellie Somers were engaged, and that they had made up their minds
to be married before the all too brief holiday was over. It would take a day or
two to procure the special licences, and this would just permit a few hours'
honeymoon, which they had decided to spend on a short motor trip to Brighton.
There was only one of the trio who had any doubts about the wisdom of the step,
and that was Harold Bentley. The other two were rich, and could please
themselves. He, on the other hand, had no money, and from the worldly point of
view was doing exceedingly well. But he was very much in love, the glamour of
the situation was upon him, and there was nothing for it but to fall in line
with the rest.</p>
<p>There had been a good many romantic marriages since the beginning of the
war, but these three looked like being something out of the common. To begin
with, there would be three of them under one roof, and the fact that all the
brides were actively engaged in nursing the wounded, and were working a
hospital of their own, added to the glamour of it. The local papers got to hear
about it, and the story was told far and wide. Some of the wounded were
sufficiently recovered to attend the ceremony, and this added picturesqueness
to a ceremony which otherwise was practically private. It was over and done
with at length, and, the newly-married couples went their way in pursuit of a
honeymoon which would have been regarded as something a little short of madness
a few months ago. But the war had changed all that; the war had changed a good
many things and swept away many traditions that would never be worshiped
again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile matters at the front were dragging slowly along. The wet winter
had set in, days and weeks of rain, during which the opposing forces sat down
doggedly before one another, waiting with what patience they could for the
spring. For all practical purposes the great German offensive was broken. So
far had they gone that it began to seem impossible that they could go any
further. The foe could bring up men, and yet more men, guns, and yet more guns,
but they had a solid force opposite them now, and though occasionly they tried
one of their mad rushes, and exhibited their usual recklessness with regard to
human life, the front was firmly locked against them.</p>
<p>Great things were promised for the spring, but so far as the real peril was
concerned Germany had shot her bolt. She might, and probably would, call out
every available man she possessed; but even a country that has been preparing
for war as Germany had done for the best part of half a century could not
possibly keep up this high tension for ever.</p>
<p>And meanwhile England was getting stronger and stronger as the Germans began
to grow weak. Not that they were really weak, but no country can lose over two
millions of the flower of her manhood without suffering from this terrible loss
of blood. It was as if some athlete in the full flood of his powers had taken
on some big task at a moment when he was already engaged upon a labour that had
taxed him to the uttermost. And all the time that Germany was waiting there
face to face with the allies in the trenches, Britain was gathering her forces
from all parts of the globe. She already had something like three million men
under arms, and all these would be ready in the summer.</p>
<p>Bentley and Kemp and Gordon discussed the situation one sunny morning at the
end of December as they sat out on the Brighton front. They had only another 24
hours of their holiday left to them; early in the morning they would be off to
join a troopship sailing from Newhaven, and it had been arranged that their
three brides should go back to London by motor.</p>
<p>"It seems to me," Kemp said, "that we haven't begun yet. What price the
fools who said that the war would be over by Christmas and that Germany could
not stand the strain for longer than that? We have had some pretty tough
fighting so far, but nothing in comparison with what is to come."</p>
<p>"We shall have some good stuff," Bentley said. "You've only got to look
about you to see that."</p>
<p>Brighton was full of troops. They swung along down the front, they filled
the promenades; the men in khaki seemed to be everywhere. For the most part
they spoke in a tongue which was not familiar to the south, though they were
getting used to it now. There were mill and factory hands, sturdy miners and
dockers, all of whom had come down from the north at the first sound of danger,
to be led later on by French and his generals in the advance on Berlin. They
were eager and excited, and keen to get to work, but men like Kemp and his
friends, who had had four months' experience, knew only too well that many
weary months would elapse before the great forward movement could take place.
There was nothing in the papers day by day except accounts of occasional
skirmishes or the taking or losing of a trench, and certain sections of the
British public were beginning to ask themselves questions. At first it had been
assumed lightheartedly that the advance on Berlin was only a question of weeks.
Few people regarded Austria seriously; she was not ready for war; had been no
better prepared than France and England; and as for Turkey, she would be
speedily wiped off the face of the map of Europe. It was impossible,
incredible, therefore, that Germany could hope to hold out for long against the
combined forces of England and Russia and France.</p>
<p>There were three men, however, sitting on the Brighton front that bright
December morning who knew better than that. They were by no means blind to the
danger, and it would be something in the nature of a miracle if the three of
them came back safely at the end of the war.</p>
<p>They sat there for a long time, each man absorbed in his own thoughts. It
was Kemp who rose at last and shook the feeling of depression from him.</p>
<p>"Come on," he said. "Let us go across to the hotel and join the girls. This
is our last day, so let's make the best of it. Who knows when we shall have
another opportunity? We have our work to do, and they have theirs, which in its
way is quite as important as ours. We ought to be proud of what they are doing.
Now come along."</p>
<p>The following afternoon the trio were dropping out of Newhaven harbour on
their way to Dieppe. It was no time for repining, no time to think of anything
else except the stern work in front of them. Here were fresh troops going to
the front, together with men who had recovered from their wounds, and seasoned
fighters returning from their holiday. They were all in the best of health and
spirits, and all of them eager to get back to the firing line.</p>
<p>Two days later they found themselves once more in the old familiar trench
behind the ruined castle, with the canal in front and the Germans just across
the water.</p>
<p>Ginger and the rest greeted them heartily.</p>
<p>"We're all glad to see you back," he said. "We're dull enough, goodness
knows, and likely to be as far as I can see. Why didn't you say as you was
goin' to get married? We read abaht it in the pipers, and wished you all good
luck."</p>
<h2><a id="chap48" name="chap48">XLVIII - NEUVE CHAPELLE</a></h2>
<p class="first">The short days and long nights dragged on in the trenches; the
heavy rains had poured down, flooding the whole of the dreary country far and
wide, and yet the British were holding their lines with a dogged tenacity as
marvellous in its way as their more brilliant feats of arms. In all the work
the British army has done in the course of its long career there has really
been nothing greater than that dogged patience turned against the German front
during all those terrible months before Ypres. It was different from anything
that Tommy had ever done before. Hitherto he had fought to conquer; he had
learnt how to fall back doggedly when disaster threatened; but to sit quietly
down month after month, up to his knees in water, frost-bitten and starving,
was a new experience to him.</p>
<p>But he stuck it, stuck it in a way that the pleasure-loving section of the
people at home leading their lives just in the ordinary way will never know,
and will never appreciate if they do. But all this was coming to an end now.
The floods were drying up, and life was gradually becoming endurable. So far
our small army had borne all the heat and burden of the day; so far it had been
a stone wall against which the flower of the German army had flung themselves
in vain. Now it was felt that the tide had turned, and it was for the British
to make the advance, though the Germans had not realised it as yet.</p>
<p>It was Wednesday, March 10.</p>
<p>To all outward seeming it was much the same as any other day&mdash;a heavy
morning coming up sullenly through the clouds. But behind the British lines
things were moving at last, and all through the night long lines of men had
marched down the roads leading to the German position through Laventie and
Richebourg St. Vaast, heaps of ruins which had been smiling villages only a few
months ago. Here they came, regiment by regiment, the Indians, dark and
mysterious, Sikhs these, and farther down the road the Gurkhas, and with them
the Leicesters and Territorials of the Royal Fusiliers. Here could be seen the
silver crosses of the Rifle Brigade, followed by the Black Watch and the
Lincolns, these in their turn supported by the Northamptons and the Worcesters,
who, amongst others, had covered themselves with glory at Ypres.</p>
<p>French was ready for his first advance.</p>
<p>The essence of the whole thing was its complete surprise. Everything
promised well for its success. For some strange reason the German airmen had
been comparatively idle during the last few days, and so far no information had
leaked out as to what General French and his staff had in the back of their
minds. The main idea was that the Germans were to be battered with artillery
and their lines rushed before they could recover from the shock of the big
guns. And in bringing about this surprise French's men had a good clear 36
hours before them. It was calculated&mdash;a calculation that was perfectly
sound&mdash;that this much time must elapse before the German line, weakened by
the terrible weight of high explosive shell, could rush up their enforcements.
And to ensure the enemy being held down to the right and left, an attack was
planned north and south of the main advance simultaneously with a great thrust
on Neuve Chapelle.</p>
<p>It is not necessary to say much of the marvellous tenacity displayed by the
British troops in their pinning down attacks at La Bassee whilst the great main
fight was going on. The main attack on the whole German position was entrusted
to the Indian corps on the right and the 4th Army Corps on the left, and also
in the centre. But this could not be carried out until the whole of the barbed
wire entanglements had been swept away by the concentrated fire of our
artillery. It was up to them to prepare the way for the great assault on Neuve
Chapelle. An hour or so before dawn everything was ready, and exactly on the
stroke of half-past seven the most deadly concentration of fire of guns of all
calibres began that the world's wars have ever seen.</p>
<p>Without a word of warning the deep boom of the first British gun struck on
the ears of the waiting troops, all strung up for the coming fray. It was for
this moment that they had been waiting for months, for this moment that they
had patiently endured the mud, the frost, and the cold. They were going forward
now; they were making the first stride in the direction of Berlin. They were
well fed, and in spite of the cold many of the regiments had already discarded
their overcoats.</p>
<p>Close up against the Sikhs what was left of the Musketeers was standing to.
They had had a hot supper the night before, and coffee had just been served
out, though not a man amongst them had a thought for breakfast. Every passing
moment seemed like an hour as they lay there waiting for the guns. They knew
perfectly well that their time had not come yet. Before they advanced the
assembled guns would have to send their message, and for at least an hour the
deadly rain of shell would continue.</p>
<p>Then it broke loose&mdash;not one gun, but hundreds. The men in the front
trenches were deafened and dazed by the roar of the field guns pouring out
their shells at almost point-blank range, and cutting through the German barbed
wire entanglements as if they had been so much paper. The range was so short
and the trajectory of those shells so flat that in many cases they passed only
a few feet over the heads of the men who were lined up in the British trenches.
In some cases the troops were deluged in dust and dirt and spattered with blood
from the fragments of human bodies blown high in the air. It was a horrible
thirty-five minutes, and then the shells began to burst further ahead as the
gunners lengthened their fuses for the purpose of dropping their shots on to
the village of Neuve Chapelle, and thus leaving the road open presently for our
infantry to come in and finish the work that they had begun.</p>
<p>"Something like a fight, this," Ginger murmured. "This is wot I come out
for. I wouldn't 'ave missed it for worlds."</p>
<p>But nobody was listening. Every man was watching the effect of the artillery
fire. And then as suddenly as it had begun the roar of the big guns ceased,
ceased at least for the time being. After that the whistles began to blow and
the British hurriedly scrambled out of the trenches into the open. It was going
to be a soldier's battle if ever there was one, a Tommy's fight with officers
and men side by side; indeed, the officers, wearing overcoats and carrying
rifles with bayonets, looked like the rank and file themselves. From the centre
of the attacking line the assault was originally pressed home.</p>
<p>The big guns had done their work well. What half an hour before had been a
well-defined line of apparently impregnable trenches was blown out of all
recognition, and had become no more than a row of pits in the ground dotted
with dead and red with blood. As for the barbed wire, it had vanished as
completely as if it had been no more than a handful of rags. The Berkshires and
the Lincolns led the way, closely followed by the Musketeers, and their orders
were to swerve respectively to the left and right as soon as they were into the
first line of trenches, and thus clear the way for the Royal Irish Rifles and
the Rifle Brigade to rush the village.</p>
<p>There were, of course, many Germans still left in the other trenches too
dazed to fight, which is no reflection upon their courage, considering what
they had gone through, and these were only too glad to surrender. The
Musketeers were opposed just for a moment by a couple of machine guns served by
two German officers fighting with the courage of despair.</p>
<h2><a id="chap49" name="chap49">XLIX - THE EARLY MORNING</a></h2>
<p class="first">It was an annoying incident, one of those little things that
happen in war, and for a second or two the Musketeers hung back before the
deadly concentration of that fire. Another minute, and they might have been
wiped out altogether, for the experience of the war shows that one machine gun
well served may hold a whole brigade, as indeed has happened more than once in
the present campaign. There was not a man amongst the Musketeers who failed to
recognise the fine work those two German officers were doing. But even the
finest feeling of chivalry has to give way at moments such as these.</p>
<p>"We shall have to shoot them," Bentley murmured. "Can't they see that it is
quite hopeless? Why, good Lord, they're all by themselves!"</p>
<p>"They ought to be English, sir," Ginger put in. "They're wasted in the
German army. Somebody's got to do it, so here goes! That's got 'im, I
think."</p>
<p>The two heads behind the machine gun dropped out of sight, and the
Musketeers moved forward again. This little interlude had cost them something
like 30 of their men. Even in the mad excitement of the moment, when every man
was strung up to the highest tension, it was still possible to note every
incident clearly. And it pleased Bentley and Kemp to see that those two German
officers were not killed, but merely wounded.</p>
<p>"Let 'em off as easily as I could," Ginger said. "I didn't mean to do 'em
in, an' I'm glad of it. 'Ere, wot's the gime now?"</p>
<p>The regiment next to the Musketeers had swung round sharply to the right,
following up the 34th Garhwalis, who, on the right, had taken their trenches
with a rush, run over them, and were pelting hard in the direction of the
village. And this even though the artillery behind had not yet finished its
work. They had to pause for a moment while the Berks and the Lincolns were told
off to assemble the prisoners who were now trooping out of the trenches in all
directions.</p>
<p>For a moment or two the Garhwalis were actually standing out there in the
open, laughing and joking amidst the terrible din made by the huge shells and
the rattle of machine guns all along the line. And then the native regiment
went on headlong to what they knew would be the bloodiest work of the day. It
was up to them to capture Neuve Chapelle at the point of the bayonet, and to do
the foe justice they were fighting with a grim tenacity beyond all praise. They
knew only too well that in close hand-to-hand strife like this no quarter would
be given, and none was asked. For in individual resistance, haphazard and here
and there, it is impossible for attacking troops to discriminate. They must go
through their deadly work with all the ruthlessness that war entails. And they
were fighting now hand to hand and so close to the foe that it was almost
impossible at times to get the bayonet to work. And there was another thing to
think of. The enemy's resistance was not broken yet, and the British had to
think of the snipers and the chance of being enfiladed from hastily-prepared
strongholds at a score of different points.</p>
<p>The village was a sight never to be forgotten. A devastating earthquake
could have caused no greater disaster than that wrought by our big guns. The
very lines of the streets were obliterated. It was indeed a scene of desolation
into which the first of the British made their way. Apparently this honour
belonged to the Rifle Brigade. Of the church only the bare shell remained; the
little churchyard was a mass of ruin amongst which the very dead had been
plucked from their graves. Of all that once pleasant village only two things
appeared to remain intact, a pair of great crucifixes, one in the churchyard
and the other close to the chateau. The din and confusion were beyond words. A
thick pall of shell smoke lay like a cloud over the village, and every time the
veil drifted a little the Germans could be seen on all sides crawling, dazed
and confused, from their cellars and dugouts holding their hands above their
heads and slinking round the shattered houses, whilst others, with the courage
of despair, were firing from the windows of the ruined houses and even
sheltering perilously behind the few surviving tombstones. Even yet the work
had not been finished, for a perfect tornado of machine gun fire was still
pouring from the houses on the far side of the village. From a cellar presently
there emerged a huge German, his fat frame quivering with fear and his hoarse
voice screaming entreaties in excellent English that his life might be spared,
as he was a married man. This little note of comedy in the midst of that welter
of tragedy and death was the sort of thing that is never lost upon an English
Tommy in whatever part of the world he may be. So the Territorial standing
before him lowered the point of his bayonet with a retort, "The old missus
won't thank me for sending you home," and spared his life. Close by a subaltern
in the Rifle Brigade tripped over a sandbag into a German trench and scrambled
to his feet to find two officers, mere boys, with their hands above their
heads. They were horribly white and shaken, but one of them managed to stammer
out in quite good English the words, "Don't shoot, we are from London also,"
and that was the way in which their hour of trouble came to an end.</p>
<p>Immediately on the outskirts of the village there happened one of those
little incidents that can only befall those who know service with the British
army all over the world. It came about that the Rifle Brigade, smeared with
dust and blood, came in contact, quite by accident, with the 3rd Gurkhas, with
whom they had at one time seen service in India. The little men were equally
dirty and grimy, but their faces were wreathed in smiles, for they had just
been doing work after their own heart. With their knives in their hands they
had just rushed a block of houses across the road and destroyed a large party
of Germans who had been strongly entrenched there with a large number of
machine guns. Just at that moment there was a lull in the fighting, and the
riflemen and Gurkhas stood there like long-lost brothers, just reunited, each
cheering the other hoarse. This is the sort of thing that one smiles at in
fiction, but which happens every day in actual warfare.</p>
<p>But meanwhile the Germans had been taking a terrible toll, as they had done
all through the campaign, by reason of the superiority of their machine guns.
It is not that the German machine gun is a better weapon than ours; as a matter
of fact, it isn't half as good. Where they excel is in the number of them. It
was at the point called Port Arthur, and the heroic regiment was the 11th
Garhwalis, who had covered themselves with so much glory earlier in the
day.</p>
<p>They had leapt from their trenches at the first blast of the whistle, to be
almost instantly withered by the devastating fury of the machine guns. The
German trench in front was untouched, and so was its two hundred yards of
barbed wire, But the native regiment never faltered, though every officer of
the leading companies was killed in front of his men. But, though the battalion
staggered under the blast of fire, they did not waver, and after fierce
fighting with knife and bayonet rolled headlong into the German trenches. At
the same time the Leicesters on their left had gone through with a rush which
was equally fierce. Their work with the bayonet that day is spoken of still,
even though there is so much to speak of; they fought so well that after the
fight the divisional general visited their billets and specially congratulated
them. But more of this presently. It was barely 9 o'clock in the morning yet,
and so far the fringe of the work was barely touched.</p>
<h2><a id="chap50" name="chap50">L - THE GOOD YOUNG STUFF</a></h2>
<p class="first">The day was beginning to draw on, and there were thousands
there who had had enough of it. It was not that there was anything the matter
with their pluck, or that fear was gnawing at their hearts, for even the
youngest of them had long since got over that numbed feeling which comes to
every soldier, however stout his nerves may be, when for the first time he
finds himself under fire. It had become a sheer case of physical endurance now,
and the battle would go to those that were the best equipped to meet it. And
that was where the British outdoor life, the hours in the playing fields, and
sport which is second nature, were telling against the foe.</p>
<p>There were points here and there, of course, where the attack hung fire. In
so big an engagement this was inevitable. On so wide a field, trenched to the
last inch, and fortified with barbed wire entanglements, it was inevitable that
even the intensity of our artillery fire must miss some part of these defences.
This happened more than once, holding the attack up awkwardly, and causing
unnecessary loss of life. For instance, there was a place near the centre of
the line where our troops seemed to linger much to the uneasiness of those
directing the attack, for it was vital that there should be no gap in the line,
and that no trench should remain untaken.</p>
<p>"What are they doing?" Ginger muttered as his company were pulled up and
more or less delayed by a detachment of the Seaforths immediately in front of
them. "This ain't the way they gets goals. An' they're bringing up their
machine guns again. Look at the blighters there on the right."</p>
<p>Bentley and Kemp stood anxiously waiting. So did the others, for they could
not understand the delay, and they were drawing machine gun fires from more
quarters than one. Then, like magic, the Seaforths wheeled away to the right
under orders to attack some German trenches on the flank, and it became plain
what was the cause of the delay. Right in front of them lay three rows of
barbed wire entanglements, which miraculously had remained untouched by the
heavy fire of the British guns early in the day. From just inside the Seaforths
came a battalion of London Territorials, the 3rd regiment, probably their first
time under fire, and some of the older hands watched furtively to see how they
acquitted themselves. But there was no cause for uneasiness. They may have
lacked the machine-like steadiness of regular troops, but the force and fire of
their attack left nothing to be desired. From that point of view they might
have been war-worn veterans. They came with bayonets well down, cheering and
singing over ground which was strewn with their own dead and the dead of their
comrades. They dropped men, of course, as they plunged forward, but they seemed
little to heed that. Not for one moment did they forget that that fine charge
of theirs was being carried out under the eyes of the very cream of the British
army. On and on they came, to the edge of the German trench, without halt or
pause, and then the regulars on their right burst into loud and ringing cheers
as they swept right over the trench, driving the surviving Germans like chaff
before them. It was a fine thing, finely done; moreover, the gap in the line
was filled and the regulars on their flank could advance once more.</p>
<p>"Did you see that?" Bentley cried. "You know who they are, don't you?"</p>
<p>"They're Territorials, like us," Ginger, burst out. "An' wot's more, they're
made o' the same sort o' stuff. I knows 'em. They comes out o' the gutter an'
off the cab ranks and out o' the banks, an' there're scores of 'em as used at
one time to think o' nothin' else but their tennis an' their golf on a Saturday
afternoon. You ask them German chaps, and they'd say as our boys weren't
soldiers at all. But I don't know as it matters wot you call 'em. It's all the
same with that lot. An' there's about three million more of 'em to come."</p>
<p>But no one was listening to what Ginger was saying; it would have been
impossible to hear in any case. Kemp was looking anxiously ahead. So far as the
Musketeers were concerned, there was nothing more to be done until the barbed
wire was out of the way. The right hand leading company managed to skirt round
without serious loss, but 'A' Company standing there in the open, were being
cut to ribbons. They were close up against the entanglement, and they tore at
it with bleeding hands and broken nails in vain. There was nothing for it for
the moment but to lie there under a murderous machine gun fire and a deluge of
shrapnel, and wait patiently for the bomb-throwers of 'A' Company, now safely
through the defences, to make an impetuous attack upon the trench, which they
eventually did. Then the Musketeers deployed to the right, and followed up
their comrades with the bayonet, and the danger was over. They were in the
trench at length, panting, breathless, and exhausted, but they had won their
way through and the trench was theirs. But they knew that so far they had
cleared only one obstacle, and that as soon as they were out of their trench
again they would be confronted with another of those death-traps, coil upon
coil of it, and stout enough to resist anything short of heavy gun fire. There
was nothing for it but to lie down again and wait to see if it were possible to
send back a message to the effect that the attack was being held up by
entanglements, and to see if the gunners could not come to the rescue.</p>
<p>Right out there amongst his men came the colonel of the Musketeers. He was
grave and anxious, for he knew only too well the terrible danger that lay
before his beloved regiment. He crept forward and asked for volunteers to get
back behind the line and convey a message to the gunners. Half of the men leapt
to their feet at once, and two of them managed to get clear away. An anxious
quarter of an hour passed, and then once more the shrapnel began to fall in
front of the Musketeers. Only a few shots, but the barbed wire vanished as if
it had been so much hay before a devastating fire. Meanwhile, a volunteer party
with bombs had pushed their way forward, and had cleared some of the Germans
out of their environments. All this time a mob of the foe had been sniping from
some cross roads behind their trench, but directly the attack began in earnest
these threw down their arms and surrendered. Some of them, however, commenced
their fire again when they realised that the bombing party consisted only of a
lieutenant and a handful of men, but nevertheless these continued to push
forward until they pushed the traiterous foe into the open, where a machine gun
officer was waiting for them with his Maxim. There was no question of surrender
after that, for within a minute there was not one of the Germans left.</p>
<p>"That was a pretty close call," the colonel of the Musketeers said, as his
men cleared the trench and pushed forward into the open. "I am proud of you,
lads. If you had been born to the business you couldn't have done it better.
But we haven't finished yet. Our objective is that big orchard in front of us.
We've got to rush it if we can, and as quickly as possible, for my instructions
are that it is very heavily held."</p>
<p>There was no occasion to say any more, for the Musketeers dashed on as
steadily as they had begun, right across the open into the orchard, ready and
eager for the fray.</p>
<p>But they had been anticipated. The dark forms they could see there were not
those of German troops, but a regiment of the Devons, who had forestalled the
attack, and had wiped out the whole of the defending force. They welcomed the
Musketeers with a grin on their faces. The Germans lay there in heaps, and not
one of them survived to tell the tale.</p>
<h2><a id="chap51" name="chap51">LI - THE DAY'S WORK</a></h2>
<p class="first">It was a great day for the Musketeers, a great day indeed for
all the regiments engaged. On the left the Worcesters and the East Lances and
the Sherwood Foresters, and other regiments coming up in support took up the
good work and continued the attack. The Worcesters were fortunate enough to
find themselves engaged in a little contest all to themselves. They had rounded
up a mob of Germans in another orchard and driven them into a farmhouse to the
north, which, as it transpired, was about the last stronghold of the position
held by the foe. The Worcesters would not be denied. They went into the
engagement full of pluck and spirit, and once they got the foe going they
hunted them up and down those muddy fields as if they had been so many terriers
let loose in a barnyard amongst the rats at threshing-time. They hunted them
with the bayonet round and round the trees as if they had been playing some
game, and drove them into the farmhouse, where they shot them down in scores.
Many of the Germans were so panic-stricken that they attempted to force their
way up the farmhouse chimneys, only to be dragged down and taken prisoners. It
was strange that that farmhouse, more or less in the line of the German
trenches, had escaped the destruction wrought by the heavy fire of the British
guns, but so it was, and that the Germans had made good use of it was proved by
the fact that every bedroom was lined with sandbags, and every window boasted a
machine gun.</p>
<p>It still lacked a few minutes to the hour of 2 when the whole village and
its outlying houses were in the hands of the British, and even then the advance
had not been quite so quick as anticipated for the reason that here and there
certain brigades had been delayed by the barbed wire entanglements. Apart from
that, the conditions were all in favour of a further advance towards the ridge.
For the Germans were fairly on the run now, and all their iron discipline was
lost. It was in vain that their officers tried to rally them: indeed, the
mental and physical condition of the prisoners was eloquent testimony to the
complete demoralisation which had set in. It is no exaggeration to say that the
prisoners were panic-stricken. They were not old men, either, not men past the
military age, riot men of the Landsturm or Landwehr, but fine, well built and
nourished young Prussians and Bavarians, well clad and perfectly equipped.</p>
<p>On the whole it was a fine fight, and one that covered the British troops
with glory. Throughout those terrible and trying hours there had been no
incident that any one amongst them need be ashamed of; there were terrible
difficulties in the way, however, physical and natural difficulties, but for
which not only the village of Neuve Chapelle but the ridges as well would have
fallen into the hands of the all conquering Britons. It was those flat plains,
marked here and there with isolated houses, and gashed with a network of
trenches, that served to waste the precious time. For here and there the full
impetuosity of the British advance was held up by the resistance of handfuls of
Germans holding these natural points of vantage with machine guns. These were
the die-hards, who fought to the last gasp and died beside their guns rather
than surrender, thus rendering their colleagues a service impossible to
over-estimate. For the precious moments delayed here and there spelt, not
minutes, but hours altogether, and gave the Germans time to rake together
reinforcements from all over the district, and, consequently, to organise a
resistance, hurried but compact enough, to form a strong line along the road
and along the fringe of the big woods.</p>
<p>So it was nearly 4 o'clock before the general advance could proceed. And
this was the psychological moment if it had been only possible to grasp it, for
it is no exaggeration to say that the opposition was then so paralysed that the
British troops were able to form up in the open outside the village before
advancing, and not a single shot was fired against them. It was just here,
opposite the wood, that our men came out of the trenches and strolled about
defiantly and fearlessly. Then the left attacked the road again in strength,
but by this time the Germans had hurried up more machine guns, and posted them
in the houses; and thus the new attack was checked. It is true that the Gurkhas
on the right penetrated into the wood, but they found themselves enfiladed and
the advantage was lost. From 4 o'clock in the afternoon till dark practically
no further progress was made. Then the firing began to slacken down, and the
troops slept where they dropped. It had been a costly day, but the reward was
great.</p>
<p>The victory of Neuve Chapelle is not to be measured by the trenches gained
and the amount of yards lost by the Germans. It is not to be measured, either,
by the standard of bygone campaigns. There was a time, and that not long ago,
when the battle of Neuve Chapelle might have ranked amongst the decisive
conflicts in the history of warfare. By comparison with other battles in this
war it was a matter of outposts. But its moral effect is far reaching. It
matters nothing what the German point of view may be: to the British Tommy, the
child of the cottage, or the son of the palace, it came like a glorious tonic
to a man who has long lain sick and weary and who has almost given up hope of
feeling his strength and manhood again. It proved to him that he had lost
nothing of his pluck or his fine patriotism during all those long and drab
months in the trenches. It came to him as a sign that the nation was as sound
and as true to the core as it ever had been. It mattered nothing to him that
the dawn would bring up enormous German reinforcements, and that the pride of
the Teuton would not permit him to lie down without doing his utmost to wipe
out the humiliating smart of that disastrous day.</p>
<p>That night, at any rate, the Musketeers, like the rest of them, slept on the
ground that they had won. They had had their suppers, they had had their
smokes, and they were looking eagerly out for the morrow.</p>
<p>"Well, this ought to have satisfied even you, Ginger," Bentley smiled. "Do
you mean to say you haven't had enough yet? We have been wonderfully lucky. So
far as I can see, not one of our little lot has been touched."</p>
<p>It was even as Bentley had said. There was himself and Kemp, together with
Garton and George and the rest of them, all huddled up together, absolutely
worn out, and yet too excited to sleep.</p>
<p>"It was just fine," Ginger said. "Lor' bless yer, I could jump now an' 'owl
front pure delight. I feel like a chap wot's just come out o' gaol, I mean like
a chap wot's 'ad five years an' then gets loosed out by them chaps as calls
themselves the Court of Appeal. You see, I didn't realise as we wos 'arf so fit
as we are. If anybody'd told me as we could 'ave gone through a dye like this
after all them months in the trenches I'd 'ave laughed. But I didn't see a
single bloke as fell out; at any rate. I'm sure it weren't one o' the
Musketeers."</p>
<p>"Better work than caddying golf clubs," Kemp suggested.</p>
<p>"Don't you get remindin' me o' that," Ginger replied. "I wants to forget it.
An' if it wasn't for you gentlemen I might be carrying on that same gime still.
It was you two as made a man o' me an' a good many others, you an' the war
between you. An' if you only know 'ow grateful I am&mdash;"</p>
<p>But Ginger was talking to the air. He realised that his companions were all
asleep. Then he turned over on his side too, and slept the sleep he had so
justly earned.</p>
<h2><a id="chap52" name="chap52">LII - THE NEXT DAY</a></h2>
<p class="first">It was just before dawn next day that the Germans made their
initial attempt to recover the ground they had lost at Neuve Chapelle. This
first counter-attack was promptly driven off with heavy loss, and the
retreating Germans were pursued until they fell back on their machine gun
strongholds in the farmhouses on the Pietre-road. It was a costly proceeding
for the Germans, especially for the reinforcements, which were shelled heavily
by our artillery as they advanced through the wood; indeed, for days afterwards
the enemy were observed bringing out their dead from the undergrowth and
burying them in the field behind. All that day, too, the Germans heavily
bombarded the British lines, but altogether without effect. During the whole of
that day and the following night the foe was gathering reinforcements, mainly
consisting of Bavarian and Saxon regiments.</p>
<p>Dawn had not broken on March 9 when once more the British line was deluged
with high explosive shells, a sure forerunner of one of those massed attacks
which are so dear to the German heart, and which from first to last has cost
the foe upwards of two million men on the different frontiers. They came on
light-heartedly enough, blinded and fooled by their leaders, as is ever the
German way. For these doomed troops had been told that there had been a slight
accident, and that a handful of English troops had blundered into Neuve
Chapelle, and that it needed little to turn them out again. So they came on in
their usual dense formation, marching like men on the parade ground to one of
the most hideous slaughters of war. Apparently the attack had been badly timed
and planned without heed for the future. These Bavarians and Saxons had not
expected to find the British so far advanced. In front of our men the attacking
party progressed like men on a route march, their officers mounted for the most
part, with drawn swords in their hands. At one place, at any rate, a
non-commissioned officer was seen driving his men along with a whip as if he
were rounding up a flock of sheep.</p>
<p>A minute later the British rifles and machine guns opened their deadly fire.
It was not a fight; it was a hideous, revolting slaughter. Right in front of
one of the English brigades the German infantry, jogging along at an easy
double, came almost up to the muzzles of the score of machine guns in front of
our brigade. The onslaught was so great that the advancing file had no time to
fall back or steady themselves; they were absolutely wiped out of existence. In
less time than it takes to tell, a yelling, cheering multitude of men, full of
life and courage stood before the machine guns, and then a huge heap of bodies
stilled the advance. But the machine guns tired not, the British rifles never
ceased to speak, and when the grey dawn came the corpses lay so deep as to form
a rampart behind which the few that survived snatched an insufficient
cover.</p>
<p>By the time it was really daylight the attack was no more. But, on the other
hand, it was impossible for the British to advance any farther, and so for the
moment they had to content themselves with what they had won.</p>
<p>But nothing could detract from the moral effect of the victory. It gave to
our men the impetus that they so sorely needed, it restored them at once to a
fine offensive force, all the more delighted and inspiriting after the long
weary drag of the winter and the dull monotony of the trenches. And so they
held on day by day and week by week, waiting and hoping that the glorious day
might be repeated. But that time was not yet; many a day was to elapse before
the triumph of Neuve Chapelle would prove to have been the forerunner of other
victories in the same region.</p>
<p>Meantime the Germans were hurrying up their reinforcements until they had
massed something like ten army corps, with a corresponding weight of artillery,
in front of Ypres. It was evident that the Kaiser was by no means discouraged
by his futile attempts to batter a way to Calais, and that he still held the
prize cheap at treble the price of the five hundred thousand men already lost.
So here were the British, hard held again, once more fighting on the defensive
in that blood-stained region, and clinging on as grimly as they had done in the
previous winter. Day after day they climbed to their trenches, despite the fire
of those terrible mortars, and sticking to them with a dogged tenacity that
nothing could tire and nothing overcome.</p>
<p>Perhaps never in the course of history has the British infantry displayed
such high qualities as those manifested during those terrible days, more
particularly on April 25, when the bombardment reached a crescendo which marked
the maximum of effect. The whole line of our trenches was kept under a fire so
continuous and searching that it even destroyed the telephone communications
between the trenches and the batteries.</p>
<p>But, despite all this, despite the fact that our trenches were blown to
atoms, not one of them had been vacated, and the Germans hurrying to the
attack, under the impression that their artillery had done its work, and that
our defences were pulverised, found, not once, but invariably, that the British
trenches were occupied, and that the machine guns were still ready to do their
deadly work.</p>
<p>And here it was that the Territorials once more came out into the limelight.
Two regiments of these had been brought up with other reinforcements to
straighten the Canadian position. Again and again they were brought under the
most merciless fire, but they stood as solid as if they had been frozen there.
Their orders were to hold the line at any cost, and they did so. It was another
battalion of the same regiment that behaved so magnificently in front of
Zollebeke, at which point the German shell fire was absolutely continuous. This
shelling had begun at daybreak, and was continued so incessantly that it was
next to impossible to bring up reinforcements, and, indeed, it was only when
the German guns slackened for the purpose of allowing their infantry to advance
that our troops were enabled to gain cover and so help their stricken comrades.
It was here that the Royal Fusiliers dashed forward in gallant style and
brought their machine guns into action so swiftly that the foe were forced back
as if some unseen giant hand was holding them in check. And there were other
Territorials to reckon with as well, fine, well-set-up fellows from the north.
Northumberlands, Durhams, and Yorkshires, who were called upon to advance right
across the open in the teeth of a tremendous machine gun fire to make good the
retirement of the French on the left of our line.</p>
<p>In the circumstances it was a big thing to ask, but the Durham Light
Infantry were in sore need, as were also the famous Fighting Fifth, who lost
their general, who had come in person to keep in contact with his men, which he
was forced to do in consequence of the fact that every telephone wire had been
destroyed. It was a great advance that the Fighting Fifth made, and it will
never be forgotten by those whose privilege it was to see it. It was to make
good the gaps caused by these losses that the Territorials were called into
action, and right gallantly they responded. There were regiments amongst them
absolutely denuded of officers, and in a great many instances it was only a
subaltern or two who led back the remains of the battalion under cover of the
welcome darkness to billets. And so it went on day after day, until the German
attack weakened, and it was borne in upon the foe that once again they had lost
their hopes of a triumphal march to Calais. And there for the present we will
leave it&mdash;leave the line locked and barred more securely than it ever has
been before.</p>
<h2><a id="chap53" name="chap53">LIII - AND AFTER?</a></h2>
<p class="first">For perhaps the last time the German phalanx had hurled itself
regardless of cost on that small piece of ground near the town of Ypres. That
spot will never be forgotten, but will go down to posterity as the most costly
piece of ground ever struggled for in the history of the world. Month after
month Germany has struggled for it, had shed the best of her blood and lost the
bravest of her first line of troops, to say nothing of a kings ransom expended
on ammunition in a futile struggle for what appeared to be no more than a mere
heap of ruins. The Kaiser has set his heart upon Calais, just as Queen Mary
did, and with much the same result; and it may be that when history comes to
pronounce its verdict it will be found that a madman's wild ambition was the
cause of his downfall.</p>
<p>This had been going on now for months&mdash;one magnificent regiment after
another had been flung headlong against the British trenches only to be driven
back or wiped out altogether, and yet wearily dragging months saw the eagles no
nearer the end of that terrible journey. And it was much the same too in
whatever direction the greedy bird of prey turned his bloodshot eyes. He had
his successes here and there, no doubt, but each of these was at a cost that no
country can repeat many tines and live. And so it was at Ypres, until the foe
fell sullenly back, never perhaps to attempt another advance, or, on the other
hand, to recommence the hideous slaughter which hitherto had been in vain. For
May was passing, and June was at hand, and England's great armies that had been
slowly gathered together since last summer were getting ready. Indeed, hundreds
of thousands were ready now to come out and help those gallant fellow
countrymen who had done so much during all those terrible months. And goodness
knows they had earned their rest; goodness knows they had paid a big enough
price to save Europe from the fate which had threatened it.</p>
<p>Some time perhaps we shall know the real inwardness of the magnificent task
that the first British army set itself to accomplish. What we should have done
without them one shudders to think. What would have become of France? Would
France have been a second Belgium? Would the heel of the conqueror have been
pressed on the neck of Paris? It is difficult to say, but the probabilities are
that all these things would have happened. But our armies saved all that; we
may not yet have broken the back of the dragon, but we have cut his claws and
we can see the blood streaming from between the scales of the monster.</p>
<p>Daily the German assaults at Ypres grew less and less; daily it became
apparent that he reckoned himself beaten. And hourly England and France were
growing stronger. Hourly England was pouring her troops into France, and
Australia and New Zealand and Canada were hurrying up their sons to the front.
And, meanwhile, though Germany was still battering at the ruined walls of Ypres
and struggling fitfully in the direction of Warsaw, the whole nation was as
much in a state of siege as if it had been imprisoned behind the walls of a
fortress. It was all very well to argue that they held a portion of France and
Russia and the whole of Belgium; in reality this merely meant that they had
managed to extend the size of their cage before the iron bars were actually
driven home. It means a little more time, a little more patience, and the loss,
no doubt, of many more gallant lives, but really these only spell delay of the
inevitable.</p>
<p>Then, on the top of all this, another foe has raised its head, another foe
not to be despised, a splendid and united nation with some four millions of men
behind it, determined to uphold the right and shake off the fetters which
Germany and her miserable ally had hoped to forge about her feet. It is early
yet to prophesy, but Italy will do her part. And there may be others yet, so
take it all in all we have no reason to complain about the outlook for the
future. But the men at the front, such as the Musketeers, live wholly in the
present; they have their work to do, and they are doing it splendidly.</p>
<p>A week or two later, after the last German dash for Ypres had been finally
smothered, what was left of the Musketeers went back to their billets. They had
been fighting incessantly now for six weeks. They had had no rest night or day,
and human nature has its limits. There were fresh regiments now by the score to
take their places, and they were looking forward to what, by comparison, they
would call a holiday.</p>
<p>For the most part the group in which we are interested had come out of the
fray with hardly a scratch. There were rumours abroad to the effect that they
might be sent home before long either to recuperate or to remain there until
the battalion was at full strength again, and many wistful eyes turned
longingly in the direction of the coast.</p>
<p>"Do you think there is a chance of getting home?" Kemp asked his captain at
the first opportunity. "Of course we can go on fighting if necessary, but for
the present I think we have had as much as we can stand. They might give us a
chance now that so many of the new army are here."</p>
<p>"I think it's very likely," the captain replied. "I can quite understand
people at home feeling rather nervous at first as to how the young troops would
behave. But when day after day we have been watching Territorials fighting with
all the zest and keenness of old soldiers, I don't think there is any cause for
anxiety. By Jove, fancy what a reception a regiment like ours would get today
if we marched through the streets of London! And I can't imagine anything
better for recruiting. The regiment has done its work well, and we are all
proud of it. But we are tired, and there is no getting away from the fact. I
don't want to boast, but I've been out here now since the first week in
September, and I must confess that I should like to see London again. Mind you,
I don't say that we shall go, but we must have some troops at home, and what
could we have better than seasoned men like ourselves, who have been all
through the campaign from the beginning? But don't count on it, and don't be
disappointed in any case."</p>
<p>There were others, on the contrary, who were quite sure that they were going
back again. Ginger, for instance, had come to regard it as quite a settled
thing.</p>
<p>"I don't want to leave it altogether," he said. "I don't think as I could go
back to the old life now, an' I don't know as I'm good for anything but
soldiering. If I 'as any luck, an' Lord knows I've a 'ad my proper share since
September, I'll be a sergeant-major one of these days. I sha'n't never do
better than that, along o' my defective education. But, Lor', that's good
enough for me, good enough for any chap as didn't 'ope a year ago to be nothin'
more than a pore devil of a golf caddie or a cove wot sells pipers in the
streets. It seems almost impossible to imagine as I've got a fair chance to
finish up with twenty-five bob a week or more, an' a thoroughly good pension
when I'm done with. But I ain't thinkin' o' that just now, Mr. Kemp. Wot I
wants is to see London again, to 'ear the noise of the streets an' the roar of
the traffic, an' find myself a chap wot people looks at when I goes by an' to
realise for the first time in my life as I've got money in my pocket an' more
to come. D'you know, sir, as I aven't drawn a penny o' my pay since we cone
out? An' it makes my 'ead fairly swim when I think of the sprees I've got
before me."</p>
<p>"You wouldn't do anything foolish," Bentley suggested. "You've got a fine
future before you, Ginger, if you don't abuse it. It would be a thousand pities
if you did anything silly now. Now, listen to me, and be advised."</p>
<p>"I ain't goin' to do anything foolish," Ginger muttered. "But if a chap
wot's gone through wot I 'ave ain't entitled to a good spree, I don't know 'oo
is. One nice little spree along o' my pals, just for a couple o' days, an' then
to settle down to respectability afterwards. But I don't want to go unless they
can spare me. If the good ole commander-in-chief takes it to 'eart, or if 'e
feels as 'e can't whop those bloomin' Germans wifout Ginger Smiff, then 'e's
only got to 'old up 'is 'and, an' I'll take on a Staff job without a
murmur."</p>
<p>"You will always be the same, Ginger," Kemp smiled. "I don't believe
anything would change you. But if I were you I wouldn't reckon too much upon
going home. Nothing has been settled as yet, and we may have a
disappointment."</p>
<p>"Don't you want to go, sir?" Ginger asked.</p>
<p>"I couldn't tell you how much," Kemp responded. "I hardly like to think
about it. But we've got to play our part and go through it all without
murmuring. I know Tommy's a born grumbler; there are times when I believe he
would mutiny if he wasn't allowed to grouse. But there are some people who
smile and do nothing, whilst there are others who grouse and grumble and work
like blazes, Tommy's one of the last. It will always be the same as long as the
British Empire lasts."</p>
<p>And with this epitaph on the British soldier we can leave the Musketeers,
battered and weary and war-worn, and waiting anxiously and patiently for the
holiday they have so richly deserved. We can leave them and their fellows
either to go to the front again, or to come back, knowing that, whatever there
fate is, they will work till they drop and fight till they die. We can leave
them to struggle on as they have from the first, never knowing when they are
beaten or what it is to taste the bitterness of defeat. And we can leave the
womenkind to watch them and pray for them, doing their work at home cheerfully
and uncomplainingly; leave them in the hospitals, women like Nettie and
Dorothy, doing a noble work with a patience that is divine and a steadfastness
which is beyond words.</p>
<p>For the end is not yet; the final victory is still hidden in the clouds and
smoke of war.</p>
<p>Truly, it is a "Long, long way to Tipperary&mdash;"</p>
