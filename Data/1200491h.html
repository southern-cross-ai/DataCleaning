<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<p>SACKVILLE MAYNE was still sober, although it was nearly two. The marble
clock in the Mornington Arms Hotel recorded the hour and the phenomenon. Years
of vinous environment has not yet robbed Mayne of the manorial air, although
the necessary acres for the part were gone long ago.</p>
<p>Neither had Mayne quite lost the art of dining. He had done ample justice to
the dinner presented by his peripatetic host the Duke de Cavour. The wines left
nothing to be desired.</p>
<p>"I am charmed," said the Duke in quite passable English, "charmed to have
met you again. Our last foregathering in Naples was many years ago."</p>
<p>For Mayne's part he had forgotten the incident entirely. The Duke's memory
was evidently more trustworthy than his own. All Mayne knew was that he had
been in Naples at the time his noble host had mentioned. The latter, an elderly
buck with small eyes and a ludicrous pointed moustache, nodded over his
glass.</p>
<p>"Those were pleasant days," he said, "twenty years ago! Dear me! And yet
when I saw you in the billiard room last night I recognised you instantly. And
what horses you used to drive in those days!"</p>
<p>Mayne smiled. The Duke had touched him on a tender spot. As the fond mother
clings to the reprobate son who spells the family ruin, so did Mayne still love
the equine flesh which had been his destruction.</p>
<p>"I've come down in the world," he said. "Egad, how I manage to live upon my
paltry little place is a mystery even to myself. But I still continue to have a
bit of blood about me. It isn't every man who can boast of having bred and run
two Derby winners."</p>
<p>"The old Godolphin blood, I presume?" suggested the Duke.</p>
<p>Mayne nodded. There was a bond of union between himself and his host. All he
knew about the latter he had gleaned that day from the <i>Almanach de
Gotha</i>. The exclusive volume in question recorded the fact that de Cavour
was an enthusiast where racing was concerned. In a hazy kind of way, he
wondered what so great a man was doing in Mornington.</p>
<p>"You race still?" the Duke asked.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200491h-images/1200491h-1.jpg" alt="YOU RACE STILL?"></p>
<p>"Oh no, I can't afford it. I only wish I could. I've got a colt entered for
the Royal Clarendon Stakes at Oldmarket&mdash; run-off next week, you
know&mdash;but I shall have to forfeit. Bar Sinister can beat any horse in the
race bar the favourite&mdash;ay, and even beat Rialto too, if wound up."</p>
<p>"Come, my friend, you are not so poor as all that."</p>
<p>Mayne smiled into his glass. Good wine develops the philosophical side of a
man's nature. It also taps the well-springs of confidence.</p>
<p>"Indeed I am," he said; "and yet with a little capital, I think I could see
my way clear. I would sell my soul for &pound;1,000."</p>
<p>"Men are prepared to take big risks for sums like that."</p>
<p>"I know it. I am prepared to undertake anything short of manslaughter."</p>
<p>The Duke paused in the manipulation of a cigarette in his slim fingers. For
an elderly, gouty gentleman with a suggestion of apoplexy in the region of the
carotid, he had remarkably clean sinewy hands.</p>
<p>"I can show you how to make &pound;1,000 with no risk at all," he said
quietly. "All you have to do is to take the money and hold your tongue."</p>
<p>"How pleasant! And the conditions?"</p>
<p>"Nothing more than the loan of your colt Bar Sinister. You will permit me to
find the money for the stakes, and the horse will be sent up to-morrow to a
stable I shall mention, and in due course he will win the Royal Clarendon."</p>
<p>"Without a month's preparation the thing is impossible."</p>
<p>The Duke smiled. There was a strange light in his beady eyes.</p>
<p>"There is many a slip, of course," he responded. "Anyway, it matters very
little whether Bar Sinister wins or not. That is a mere detail in my scheme.
The question is, can I have the horse if I deposit the money?"</p>
<p>"Now you ask the question, of course you may."</p>
<p>"Good. Mind, this is a profound secret. The horse is to be sent to Oldmarket
to Gunter's stables to run in your name. Whether Bar Sinister wins or not
matters very little. The favourite is firmly established at even money, so if I
were you I should not back the colt."</p>
<p>Mayne nodded carelessly. It was not for him to suggest that some rascality
was afloat. He had known in his time racing dukes with no more inherent
morality than dustmen. "It's all the same to me," he said, "as long as I get
the money. By the way, on the day following the Clarendon, the cup is run for
at Silverpool. Haven't you got something starting there?"</p>
<p>"A horse of my own breeding," the Duke responded. "Confetti. No chance, I
fear. The odds are forty to one against. Only a few personal friends know I am
in England, or perhaps the odds would be a little less. You will see to this
matter at once."</p>
<p>Mayne gave the desired assurance. Then the Duke proceeded to take from his
pocket notes to the value of one thousand pounds.</p>
<p>"I am going to Oldmarket in the morning," he explained, "but not as the Duke
de Cavour. I have my reasons for being known as Mr. Smith. If you desire to
communicate with me please do so in that name <i>per</i> Gunter. Again let me
urge upon you the advantage of silence in this matter."</p>
<p>A little while later and Mayne was driving his weedy bay towards his place
which lay just outside Mornington. Meanwhile, the Duke de Cavour alias Smith
had retired to his private sitting-room. Once there he lighted a cigarette and
locked the door. With a quasi-magical sweep of his hand, he removed wig and
moustache, and stood confessed for the time being in the legitimate form of
Felix Gryde.</p>
<p>"Now let me see how I stand," he muttered, throwing himself into a chair. "I
am the Duke de Cavour. In my disguise, made up from personal inspection of the
distinguished individual in question, I could defy the noble mother of de
Cavour to tell the difference between us. For the present the genuine article
is under private restraint in Genoa. That is a fact of which the world knows
nothing. To make matters still more safe, there is no need for me to appear
personally, except at the finish to draw the money from the turf commissioners;
and nobody will know that the horse running as Confetti in the Silverpool Cup
is anything but de Cavour's colt. One way and another I ought to make
&pound;100,000 out of this business; and I deserve it, for the scheme has
occupied all my care and attention for a whole year."</p>
<p>So saying Gryde rose and proceeded to unlock a dispatch box, and took from
thence two large photographs. They were both likenesses of horses and appeared
to be taken from the same plate. Gryde regarded them long and earnestly.</p>
<p>"A wonderful resemblance." he said, "the same age to a month, the same
marks, the same everything. It's the Godolphin blood in both, I expect. Upon my
word, I don't know which is Mayne's Bar Sinister, and which is the favourite
for the Grand Clarendon, Sir George Julyan's Rialto. I wonder what Mayne would
say if he knew I had been hanging about here for six weeks to get that
photograph. And what a <i>coup</i> this is going to be!"</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<p>OLDMARKET, as everybody knows, is the headquarters of the racing world.
There are many training establishments there, from the palatial concern with
its hundreds of hands down to the tiny quarters from whence from time to time a
"dark horse" emerges, and some Tom Jones springs into sudden prominence, and
thenceforth is respectfully spoken of by equine scribes as Mr. Thomas
Jones.</p>
<p>Such an establishment was Gunter's, which boasted a tumble-down house, and a
row of ill-found stables tenanted for the most part by platers. Gunter and two
lads found themselves quite equal to the task set before them.</p>
<p>Gunter was a typical specimen of his class, sharp, dapper, and cunning, and
good enough for anything outside the pale of the law. On the night following
the little dinner at Mornington, Gunter sat in his shabby parlour, a rank cigar
in his mouth&mdash;a tumbler of gin and water before him.</p>
<p>On the other side of the table was a foxy-looking man, dressed like a stud
groom, and whom Gunter addressed with grudging civility as Mr. Smith. We have
seen him before under the guise of the Duke de Cavour.</p>
<p>"I suppose it is all right?" asked the latter.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's all right up to now" Gunter replied dubiously. "Bar Sinister came
in the dusk clothed up to the eyes, and I stored him into a loose box at once.
I took care that the lads didn't see too much."</p>
<p>"You've got them out of the way, of course?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they won't be back till morning. Your part of the business
satisfactory?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly. Don't you be afraid over me. Within a fortnight's time you will
have your pockets full of money, and I shall be back on my way to Australia
again the richer for the <i>coup</i>. You see I don't show up at
all&mdash;merely a horse of mine goes from this stable to run for the
Silverpool Cup. The Duke de Cavour is not known in English sporting circles,
and nobody takes an interest in him. It's quite safe, because there really is
such a man, and at present he is under restraint&mdash;don't you hear? It
doesn't matter what name I take in my betting against Rialto for the Grand
Clarendon on Friday so long as I have satisfied my commissioner of my <i>bona
fides</i>. I have employed a different commissioner to put my money on Confetti
for the Silverpool."</p>
<p>"And if they find out that your Confetti is really--"</p>
<p>"How can they? Confetti has never appeared in public yet. Still, the
likeness between the two horses is so wonderful that I am not particularly
uneasy. Now you have a good look at the colt? You know Rialto, of course?"</p>
<p>"What do you think? Do I know my own mother?"</p>
<p>"Very good. Then come to the stables and let us see that everything is quite
in order."</p>
<p>Gunter followed with a lantern. In one of the stalls stood a handsome dark
chestnut clothed to the eyes, the clothes, strange to say, marked in blue with
the monogram "G.J."&mdash;nothing less, in fact, than Sir George Julyan's
copyright The set had been stolen from the owner of the favourite for the Grand
Clarendon for a purpose which will be disclosed in due course.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200491h-images/1200491h-2.jpg" alt=
"A HANDSOME, DARK CHESTNUT"></p>
<p>The chestnut was stripped, and for some time Smith and Gunter stood
contemplating him from all points of view.</p>
<p>"It is a wonderful likeness to Rialto," Gunter exclaimed. "If you'd searched
the world you would not have found a better match."</p>
<p>"It has taken me nearly a year to do it," Smith replied.</p>
<p>"Well, you look like getting your money back, sir. If I could only see the
next two hours safely over, why--"</p>
<p>"Leave that to me," responded the other sternly. "Everything is ready. You
have managed to get a key to fit the back entrance to Lorrimer's stable?"</p>
<p>Gunter nodded. Lorrimer's was a big establishment close at hand where Sir
George Julyan's horses were trained, and where Rialto, the favourite for the
Grand Clarendon, lay at the present moment.</p>
<p>Then Smith addressed his colleague long and earnestly. The latter followed
every word carefully. When the hour of midnight struck the lights were put out
and the stable door gently opened. It was pitch dark then, but it made no
difference to Gunter. He could have found his way for a radius of a mile
blindfold. The turf was thick and yielding underfoot, so that the adventurers
made no noise. They were not alone, for Gunter was leading Bar Sinister by the
bridle. Silently they made their way across the heath to a spot where a clump
of trees were faintly outlined. These were not far from Lorrimer's stables. The
journey was made without a single soul being encountered.</p>
<p>The critical moment had arrived-- Smith, or to call him by his proper name,
Felix Gryde, peered into the darkness. Not more than a hundred yards away from
him he could make out Lorrimer's stables.</p>
<p>Gunter fairly shivered with excitement. Rogue and big as he was, this was
the first scheme in which had entered the element of personal danger.</p>
<p>"Now you stay here perfectly still till you hear me whistle," Gryde said
sternly; "and when I do so, bring the horse forward. Don't show up yourself,
the idea being to lead these people to believe that Rialto has found his way
out of the stable."</p>
<p>Gunter muttered something, and Gryde disappeared. He came at length to the
buildings and proceeded to skirt round them till the far side was reached. Here
he stopped and listened intently. Not a sound was to be heard from the
semi-detached building where the favourite for the Royal Clarendon was
quartered. Then Gryde stepped into the outer box, opening the door by means of
a key. There was plenty of straw littering the floor, which Gryde proceeded to
moisten with the aid of a jar of paraffin with which he had armed himself for
the purpose.</p>
<p>All remained perfectly still. No sound came from the room over the box where
the favourite lay beyond a tough snore. The head lad in charge of Rialto had
evidently dropped into a sound slumber.</p>
<p>"I hope he won't sleep too long," Gryde chuckled.</p>
<p>The next proceeding was to advance into the box devoted to the pampered
quadruped. To fix blinkers over the animal's eyes was a sufficiently delicate
job, but it was at length accomplished.</p>
<p>Then the far stable door was just opened. A match was laid to the saturated
straw and a brilliant tongue of flame shot up. In less time than it takes to
tell the whole place was roaring and crackling.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200491h-images/1200491h-3.jpg" alt=
"A MATCH WAS LAID TO THE STRAW"></p>
<p>Two minutes were allowed to lapse and then Gryde crept into the open. He
commenced to hammer on the walls and to yell "Fire" at the top of his
voice.</p>
<p>From an uneasy dream the head lad was aroused. Scared and frightened he
stumbled down the ladder and bolted out for his life. Before the occupants of
the other boxes were aroused, Gryde had passed into the stable again. There was
still room for a clear passage for the horse. It was just touch and go, but
Gryde coaxed the frightened animal out and led it away into the darkness. An
instant later and a shrill whistle rang out on the air.</p>
<p>By this time quite a small mob of helpers had arrived.</p>
<p>Buckets were procured, and amongst much noise and clatter the fire was
extinguished. But what had become of the horse? No sooner had this question
commenced to pass from lip than a pair of ears sharper than the rest discerned
the sound of hoofs.</p>
<p>"Here's the tit," yelled a voice from the darkness, "standin' here like a
lamb. Blest if I ever see such a knowing creature."</p>
<p>The head lad gave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>"Thank goodness!" he muttered. "Here, Joe, go and turn those colts out of
the far box yonder and get Rialto in at once."</p>
<p>Apparently the horse was none the worse for his adventure. He appeared to be
unhurt down to the last row of braid upon his blanket. That anything was wrong,
that the affair was anything but an accident, nobody dreamed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Gryde with his prize had slipped away to an appointed spot, where
he waited patiently till everything had passed off quietly. At the end of an
hour Gunter approached with the greatest caution.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see you've got him," he whispered.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><img src="1200491h-images/1200491h-4.jpg" alt="I SEE YOU'VE GOT HIM"></p>
<p>"Of course I have. How did you get on?"</p>
<p>"Splendidly," Gunter replied. "They never saw me at all, and they took Bar
Sinister for their own Rialto as naturally as possible; and I'll lay a wager
that not one of them will ever know the difference. In all the years I've been
in this line, I never saw such a likeness."</p>
<p>"You are right there," said Gryde.</p>
<p>"But hadn't we better get Rialto back to our own stable without further
delay?"</p>
<p>A little later, and Rialto stood in the place where Bar Sinister recently
was. The two men watched him with admiration.</p>
<p>"The finest colt in England and the best three-year-old to-day," Gryde
exclaimed. "But he isn't going to be Rialto or Bar Sinister any longer. Your
lads haven't seen him stripped, you say, so they haven't a notion what he is
like. Now then, you boast that you can 'fake' a horse better than any man in
England. Let us see you get rid of those white stockings and star, in fact turn
the finely trained Rialto into the half wound Confetti&mdash;the Confetti who
is to land me such a <i>coup</i> over the Silverpool Cup."</p>
<p>Gunter chuckled hoarsely.</p>
<p>"Don't you worry," he said. "Confetti won't gain a friend when he's pulled
out for the preliminary canter on Monday, and he'll win in a canter. Go and
smoke a cigar in my room and leave me for a couple of hours. When you come
back, I shall be able to astonish you."</p>
<p>All the same it was nearly daylight when Gunter summoned Gryde to see the
result of his handiwork. He held up the lantern with artistic pride.</p>
<p>"There," he laughed hoarsely, "what do you think of that?"</p>
<p>Gryde expressed his satisfaction, as well he might. Gone were the white
stockings and the star, gone was the sleek and glossy coat. The difference in
the appearance of the colt was wonderful. He was transformed into another
animal.</p>
<p>"Looks ragged and half trained," Gunter chuckled. "Suggests speed, but a
little thick, perhaps. They'll open their eyes a bit up yonder when he
spreadeagles his field for the Silverpool. He's simply chucked in at the
weight."</p>
<br>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>An extremely fashionable crowd had assembled at Oldmarket the following
afternoon to witness the race for the Grand Clarendon. Royalty was present, and
the stands were packed with fair women and brave men. Amongst the latter,
perfectly at home and yet apart from the rest, was a neatly attired individual,
who, had he been asked his name, would have answered to that of Smith. He
lolled over the railings in front of the enclosure, a cigarette in his
well-gloved fingers. Any sportsman of note would have passed his get-up
approvingly, and yet there was nothing about the man to attract
attention&mdash;he seemed to fit quite naturally into the picture.</p>
<p>Probably the least excited spectator present when the horses were weighed
out for the Grand Clarendon was this Smith, otherwise Gryde. Close behind him
were a lot of superb sporting dandies, conspicuous amongst them being Sir
George Julyan, the owner of Rialto. As the latter swept past the stand in the
preliminary canter, Sir George looked a little uneasy; so did his
companions.</p>
<p>"Is that horse really fit, Julyan?" asked one.</p>
<p>"I should have said emphatically yes on Monday," Julyan replied. "So you
notice the difference, eh? Seems short, and inclined to lather. Just my luck if
Rialto got a cold on the night of the fire."</p>
<p>Those of the public who knew a horse when they saw one shared the
uneasiness. The favourite dropped a point or two in the betting.</p>
<p>As the kaleidoscope of brilliant jackets flashed out in a streaming band
from under the eye of the starter Rialto dropped to fourth place, and so
continued until at length the horses came into the home stretch.</p>
<p>"Rialto is coming, I see," remarked one of the group behind Gryde.</p>
<p>The latter stole a glance at Sir George's face. The latter was perfectly
calm and collected, but his lips flickered like a tongue of flame in a
fire.</p>
<p>"I don't think so," he said. "Ribton is riding him."</p>
<p>Just an instant the favourite shot out only to drop back again. Then amidst
a perfect babel a rank outsider challenged, Rialto made a desperate effort, and
finally was beaten by half a length.</p>
<p>The ring cheered to the echo; everybody else was ominously silent. With a
click Sir George snapped his race glasses together.</p>
<p>"Well, they can't say Rialto didn't run a game horse," he said. "Egad, the
burning of that bundle or two of straw cost me &pound;40,000."</p>
<p>"Precisely the sum I have won," Gryde told himself. "The pseudo Rialto was a
game horse; indeed, a little later on it may be that I have provided Sir George
with a better animal than his own. No use staying here any longer. And now we
shall see what kind of a turn the real Rialto will do me on Monday.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<p>AT TWENTY minutes past three on the following Monday afternoon a
ragged-looking colt with a fine turn of speed flashed along between the white
posts fencing off thousands of turfites, and once more the ring was rejoicing
in the pleasing and remunerative pastime of "skinning the lamb."</p>
<p>Outsiders frequently win big races, but the spectacle of a horse absolutely
unknown striding twenty lengths ahead of anything else past the judge's chair
is not quite so common. Until the numbers went up, nobody knew who had won the
Silverpool.</p>
<p>There was a good deal of raucous mirtn in the ring. But one or two Napoleons
of the pencil were observed to look grave. The owner of the fortunate Confetti
was supposed to be somewhere on the course, but nobody had seen him.</p>
<p>After the jockey had weighed in, Gunter and "Mr. Smith" discussed the matter
calmly.</p>
<p>"You are perfectly satisfied?" asked the latter.</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think?" exclaimed the delighted Gunter. "I've made ten
thousand clear. And a prettier plant, a plant more worthy of 'Awley Smart, I
never heard tell of. I expect you've done better."</p>
<p>"A trifle," Gryde said drily. "You know what to do next. It seems a pity,
but it's the only way to keep the thing from creeping out. Rialto, otherwise
Confetti, must never run another race."</p>
<p>Gunter winked knowingly.</p>
<p>"It does seem a pity," he said, "but I'll do exactly as you tell me."</p>
<p>The confederates shook hands and parted. It was the last time they were
likely to meet: a piece of information Gryde did not deem it necessary to
impart to Gunter. And as the former sat <i>in propria persona</i> and entirely
shorn of disguise in his club, he was calmly reading as follows in the special
<i>Globe</i>:</p>
<blockquote>THE SILVERPOOL CUP<br>
DEATH OF THE WINNER<br>
<br>
The sensational victory of the rank outsider Confetti in the Silverpool Cup
to-day is followed by a no less tragic sequel. It appears that whilst the
animal was being personally rubbed down by Gunter, his trainer, the colt burst
a blood vessel, and died a few minutes later. Confetti had no other engagements
this season, but all the same the Duke de Cavour is to be condoled with on his
loss.</blockquote>
<p>Gryde smiled as he lay back smoking a thoughtful cigar.</p>
<p>"Really," he told himself, "this has been a very pretty piece of business.
And they say there cannot be anything new in the way of a racing fraud. Not
only have I proved the contrary, but also I have hit upon a scheme which will
never be found out. First I find a horse so like Rialto that I exchange one for
the other without fear of detection. Even the Grand Clarendon defect is
naturally accounted for. I make a pile of money laying against Rialto&mdash;a
certainty this. Then the real Rialto, artistically faked, runs as Confetti.
This means still more money. And as the Duke is safely out of the way, where he
is likely to see no English papers, with friends who don't know a horse from a
halter, that avenue of detection is closed. The rest of my money I can safely
draw on Monday, and then "Mr. Smith's" place will know him no more. A pity to
destroy Rialto, but it was necessary. The course taken renders everything
absolutely safe.</p>
<p>"And as to Sackville Mayne? Well, Mr. Mayne is not likely to open his mouth.
He has had a thousand pounds for his horse, knowing perfectly well that some
swindle was afloat, and though he may wonder, the last thing he will do will be
to ask questions. You can always, buy that class of man. Perhaps I ought to
have had Bar Sinister, now passing as Rialto, poisoned, but that is a mere
detail. And how easy it has all been! Really, next time I must try something
with an element of danger in it. Wonder if there is anyone in the
billiard-room. I should like a bit of excitement after this humdrum
business."</p>
