  <h2><a id="ch1">CHAPTER I</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN the outer office of the Maggersfont Diamond Company the
handful of
  clerks worked steadily on with that ease and smoothness that always
  characterises a perfectly organised and smoothly running business. They were
  lady typists, for the most part, under the able supervision of a forewoman,
  and because they both admired and respected their employer, Sir Samuel Oscar,
  there was very little slacking in Bishopsgate-street. Because Sir Samuel was
  not only a great man and a South African magnate of the first importance, but
  a most kindly and considerate employer besides. Though when he spoke or
  directed then everybody under him knew that he meant exactly what he
  said.</p>

  <p>An inner room leading out of the clerks' apartment was devoted to the
  requirements of the great man's personal secretary, and her name&mdash;Miss
  Stella Ravenhill&mdash;appeared in black letters on the ground glass in the
  upper part of the door. Rather an unusual development, perhaps, in a city
  office, but then Stella Ravenhill stood, more or less, in a class of her own,
  and it was a peculiar psychological fact that, though she had been in the
  employ of her firm for less than three years, she had gone easily and
  smoothly over the heads of the other lady clerks, and, strangely enough,
  there was not one of them who resented her presence or was in the least
  disposed to question her authority.</p>

  <p>Perhaps they liked her all the better because they recognised from the
  first that she was a lady. Not that the rest failed to claim an equal
  distinction, but then there was a difference, and they all had admitted it
  from the first moment when Stella Ravenhill came in all her calm beauty and
  serene assurance, to say nothing of her undoubted ability, and at once took
  her place which Nature had ordained for her from the moment of her birth.</p>

  <p>And now she was Sir Samuel's confidential secretary. She took down his
  letters in shorthand and very frequently typed them herself. Nobody knew who
  she was or where she came from, though there were legends in the office as to
  her high birth and station, and as to what position in society she had
  occupied before the force of circumstances had compelled her to get her own
  living. She took no share in the simple pleasure and amusements of the rest,
  and yet she had always a word of sympathy for such of the girls who chose to
  confide their troubles to her, and very frequently her purse was at their
  disposal.</p>

  <p>Of course it was not for the body of clerks to know that Stella had been
  what is familiarly known as born to the purple. There had been a time, and
  not so very long ago, when she had lived at home with her extravagant,
  easy-going father in the old place called Ravenswood, where the Ravenhills
  had lorded it for centuries. And then the last of the race had died, leaving
  his affairs in inexplicable confusion. When everything was settled and wound
  up there was practically nothing left for the only daughter of the house, so
  that she was forced to go out into the world and get her own living.</p>

  <p>She might have become dependent upon the charity of her friends, she might
  even have made a brilliant marriage, for she had birth and beauty and brains
  besides. But that was not Stella Ravenhill's way. She was a woman, gentle and
  refined to her finger-tips, and, sooth to say, with most of the prejudices of
  her class. At the same time, there was a certain streak of modernity in her,
  and she much preferred to struggle for herself rather than throw herself upon
  the resources of her relatives. She would go out and earn her own living.</p>

  <p>She learnt to type and write shorthand, she graduated amazingly soon in
  the London School of Economics, and then, when she was in the possession of a
  weapon with which to carve out her future, she had her first piece of good
  fortune. So far the grand old house in which she had been born and its
  surrounding acres had not been sold, so she had gone down there for the last
  time, previous to the auction, to gather together certain belongings of small
  value, but of sentimental interest, and there, in the great hall, she had
  come face to face with Sir Samuel Oscar. So they had fallen more or less
  naturally into conversation, and, almost before she was aware of the fact,
  Stella had told most of her simple, tragic story to the man who was destined
  to become her employer.</p>

  <p>He was down there, as he told her, with a view to becoming the owner of
  the property.</p>

  <p>Not only did that happen, but, all unknown to Stella, Sir Samuel had
  slightly increased his offer to the trustees so that she found herself
  unexpectedly in the possession of a few hundred pounds which she might find
  very useful in case of a rainy day. So, eventually, Sir Samuel became master
  of Ravenswood and all its ancient glories, and Stella took her position in
  Bishopsgate-street.</p>

  <p>And never had Sir Samuel regretted that queer sort of partnership from the
  first moment that Stella came into his office. There is no sentiment in
  business and Sir Samuel offered none. He placed Stella, to begin with,
  exactly on a level with the rest, and she won her way into the confidence of
  the big man by sheer force of quality. He was an elderly man and a bachelor,
  with few relations in the world, so that he devoted himself almost entirely
  to business, though there were times when he look his ease and entertained
  lavishly at Ravenswood. It was not known in the office that on more than one
  occasion Stella had visited her old home as a guest under the hoary roof of
  Ravenswood, and this she never mentioned. On these occasions employer and
  employed were on terms of absolute equality, but once behind those mahogany
  doors in Bishopsgate-street the footings changed, though, even in the inner
  sanctum where Sir Samuel transacted his big business there were moments when
  the mask was dropped and the two were more like father and daughter.</p>

  <p>There was an atmosphere something like this one fine morning when, in
  response to her employer's bell, Stella entered the inner office. There was a
  smile on her lips when she came in, but that quickly faded as she noted the
  grave, preoccupied look on Sir Samuel's rather stern features. He was one of
  those iron-grey men, big and lean and clean shaven, with a humorous droop in
  the corners of his clear-cut lips and a twinkle in an eye that belied its
  severity. But not this morning.</p>

  <p>"Oh, here you are, Miss Ravenhill," he said. "Will you have the goodness
  to take a seat?"</p>

  <p>Stella slipped into the chair by her employer's desk, fully conscious of
  the fact that here was something decidedly out of the common. She waited a
  moment for Oscar to speak.</p>

  <p>"I wanted to talk to you on a little matter that has given me a great deal
  of anxiety the last month or so," he said. "Miss Ravenhill, I am going to
  trust you implicitly."</p>

  <p>"I hope you have always done so, Sir Samuel."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course, of course," the great man said, almost abruptly. "A queer
  thing, but there is not a single man of my acquaintance, including my own
  partner and my fellow-directors, whom I trust as thoroughly as I do you. And
  yet there was a time when I always declared that no woman could keep a
  secret. I was wrong. And I cannot pay you any higher compliment."</p>

  <p>"Shall we get on with the business, Sir Samuel?" Stella asked.</p>

  <p>"Quite right, my dear, quite right. Well, it's like this. For some
  considerable time past there has been a serious leakage in stones from the
  Maggersfont mines. I have said nothing about this to the board, neither do I
  intend to, at least not for the present. But it has got to be stopped."</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure of your facts, Sir Samuel?" Stella asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh dear, yes. It is a mere question of averages. Nobody knows better than
  myself how regular and steady the output has been from Maggersfont. It has
  hardly varied a dozen carats for over two years. And now, for the last three
  months or more, we have been down to the extent of something like &pound;5000
  every four weeks. Of course, I am going on the returns from our manager out
  yonder. And this morning I had a confidential letter from him in which he
  seems to have come to some sort of conclusion. It is a most startling one and
  has disturbed me considerably. I will show you the letter presently. And that
  is not all the trouble. From what Washburn says, I gather that a stone of
  outstanding value has been smuggled out of the mine. Washburn has nothing
  definite to go on, except gossip amongst the native boys working in the blue
  dust, but it is common talk amongst them that a huge stone, which they call
  the King Diamond in their vernacular, was found by one of the Kafirs and
  smuggled out of the compound. Perhaps I had better tell you that this King
  Diamond is a sort of legend amongst the Kafirs, and they have been searching
  for it ever since diamonds were first discovered at Kimberley ages ago. A
  sort of myth, you understand. Of course, there may not be anything in it at
  all; on the other hand, it may be absolutely true. Anyhow, Washburn tells me
  that one of the Kafirs has been in a state of partial intoxication for days,
  and that he is known to have a big roll of Treasury notes in his possession.
  Evidently he has talked or boasted amongst his compatriots and the story has
  got back to Washburn's ears."</p>

  <p>"I may say that he, Washburn, is absolutely convinced that we have been
  robbed of one of the biggest diamonds in the world."</p>

  <p>"But I thought it was impossible," Stella said.</p>

  <p>"So it would be in ordinary circumstances. No Kafir could have got away
  with a stone like that without being detected. He could not have left the
  compound with that diamond in his possession. I don't say that he didn't find
  it, neither do I say that it was impossible for him to hide it, whilst
  awaiting a chance to get clear away with his booty. Washburn is of opinion
  that the man had a confederate, and that his confederate took the stone away
  and got clear off with it."</p>

  <p>"But that sounds equally impossible," Stella pointed out. "Any man who is
  on terms of that sort with Kafir workmen would never have been allowed in the
  compound at all."</p>

  <p>"Not in ordinary circumstances," Sir Samuel admitted. "But let us suppose
  that the visitor was a man beyond suspicion. For instance, he might have been
  a statesman, or a great scientist, or something of that kind, and a man who
  had the run of the compounds as a matter of courtesy. Naturally enough,
  Washburn would never suspect an individual of that kind. I shouldn't myself.
  There are hundreds of men all over the world whom I would trust to visit the
  compound at any time."</p>

  <p>At this point Sir Samuel paused as if almost afraid to continue. Stella
  waited for him to speak.</p>

  <p>"And now we are coming to the point," he went on. "I know you have met a
  great many distinguished people in your time, Miss Ravenhill. Now, amongst
  them, did you ever come in contact with a famous ethnologist called Sir
  Hercules Slaney?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," Stella cried. "The greatest living authority on matters
  concerning ethnology and ethnography living to-day. He has made the black
  belt in Africa his hunting ground for years. I don't suppose there is anybody
  living who knows as much about the dark races. And I have heard it said that
  he can speak no less than ninety different dialects."</p>

  <p>"All of which is absolutely true," Oscar agreed. "But I asked you if you
  had ever met him."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Stella said. "He used to stay occasionally with some friends of
  his near Ravenswood before my father died. A strange sort of man. Very tall
  and very spare, but as hard as Iron and supple as whipcord. A man with a
  great, bald head and a long straggling beard. Very eccentric and undoubtedly
  mad on some points. But there can be no question as to his intellect. I
  suppose you know that he is in London?"</p>

  <p>"The devil he is," Sir Samuel exclaimed. "Perhaps you will kindly inform
  me how you know that."</p>

  <p>Stella changed colour slightly. The question was one that she found rather
  difficult to answer, because it involved certain private matters which she
  would have preferred not to discuss even with Sir Samuel himself. Still,
  there could be no holding back now, and she would have to speak freely.</p>

  <p>"Well, I haven't seen him since he got back, if that is what you mean,"
  Stella explained. "But, you see, I happen to know his right-hand man very
  well. He is the son of an old neighbour of ours whose history, in a way, is
  very like mine. He found himself, after the war, compelled to get his own
  living, and, as he had spent two or three years amongst the Congo natives, he
  was glad of an opportunity of joining Sir Hercules in his varied expeditions.
  You may have heard of Lionel Bly."</p>

  <p>Sir Samuel nodded gravely. He had heard of Lionel Bly, whose family
  property, or late family property rather, marched with the ancestral acres at
  Ravenswood. And all he had heard of that young man was distinctly in his
  favour. He shot a quick glance at Stella and noticed her rising colour.</p>

  <p>"Is that all you have got to tell me, young lady?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh well," Stella laughed, "you always take me into your confidence, so
  why shouldn't I take you into mine? I have known Lionel Bly ever since I can
  remember. He was my hero when I was a tomboy and he was at Eton. He is six or
  seven years older than I am, but I never saw anybody else that I wanted to
  marry."</p>

  <p>"And you are of the same mind, now, eh?"</p>

  <p>Stella nodded two or three times emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Then he is a dashed lucky young fellow, that is all I have to say," Sir
  Samuel said, with a hearty smile.</p>

  <p>"I think we are both lucky in that respect," Stella said. "But otherwise
  this little romance of ours is likely to last until we are both middle-aged.
  You see, I have no money, and he has none, and there&mdash;well, there we
  are, don't you know. But don't you think we are getting sentimental, Sir
  Samuel?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course, of course," Oscar said with a mock severity. "Most
  reprehensible, especially in business hours. But it is rather a strange thing
  that this young man of yours&mdash;I beg your pardon, this Mr. Bly should be
  a sort of confidential assistant to the very man we suspect."</p>

  <p>"Suspect?" Stella cried. "Do you mean to say that you suspect Sir Hercules
  Slaney?"</p>

  <p>"That is what it comes to," Oscar said grimly. "Washburn goes even farther
  than that. He said he is perfectly certain that for some considerable time
  past Sir Hercules has been buying diamonds belonging to the Maggersfont
  Company through one of the Kafirs employed in the mines. Three or four months
  ago Sir Hercules came down from the Congo with your friend Mr. Bly and his
  baggage-bearers, and spent a lot of time at Maggersfont, ostensibly studying
  the natives. He used his great influence in his letters of introduction to
  impress Washburn and asked our manager for an opportunity to observe the
  Kafirs when they were actually at work. Even then Washburn hesitated. He
  cabled to me for instructions, and, after consulting one or two of Slaney's
  colleagues in London, I gave my consent without much hesitation. However, you
  had better read the letter for yourself."</p>

  <p>Stella took up the sheets and read them carefully. They formed a long and
  anxious communication from the manager of the mines, in which, under the seal
  of secrecy, he laid all his suspicions and certain rather slender proofs
  before his chief. He had made exhaustive inquiries, he said. At first he had
  been loth to fasten suspicion upon so distinguished a scientist, whose name
  was a household word on both sides of the Atlantic. But the farther he had
  gone the more mistrusting he became of the great man. To begin with, he had
  elicited the fact that Sir Hercules Slaney was exceedingly short of ready
  money. His hotel bill in the house where he was staying near Maggersfont had
  not been paid for many weeks, and even his servants had been clamouring for
  their wages. And then, suddenly, the trouble had ceased, and Slaney appeared
  to be in ample funds again. Then there was the strange case of the particular
  native who had suddenly ceased work, and who was in a state of partial
  intoxication for days together. Moreover, this individual was proved to be
  swaggering about the various native quarters with a roll of Treasury notes on
  his person. He had changed one or two of these, and Washburn had traced them
  directly to Sir Hercules Slaney. It was clear to him that Slaney was acting
  as the agent for some daring firm of illicit diamond buyers, and that, in all
  probability, he was sharing the spoil with them. And then just as Washburn
  was proving his case, Sir Hercules had vanished, together with his private
  secretary, leaving no trace behind him. The most significant fact of all:
  this disappearance had taken place about the time when the native quarters
  were buzzing with rumours as to the finding of the traditional great King
  Diamond. Had Slaney got away with it in his possession? Had he returned to
  London, and how was he living? Did he appear to be in the possession of ample
  funds, or was he passing through a period of temporary impecuniosity.</p>

  <p>"Well, now you know all about it," Oscar said when Stella had finished the
  letter. "What do you think?"</p>

  <p>Stella appeared to be a little troubled.</p>

  <p>"Such things have happened before now," she said. "It is not the first
  time that a great man has yielded to temptation. It was absolutely necessary
  that Sir Hercules should have the command of a lot of money because his
  expenses must have been enormous. You cannot travel all over the world as he
  did without a long purse, and I have heard it said more than once that his
  resources were exceedingly limited. At the same time I am afraid if Mr.
  Washburn's suspicions are correct that some of the suspicion must fall upon
  Lionel Bly. You see&mdash;oh, dear, I hardly know how to put it. What are you
  going to do, Sir Samuel?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I haven't quite made up my mind," Oscar replied. "Of course, you
  can't sit down to a loss like this, and if there is any truth in the story of
  the King Diamond and Slaney has got away with it, then I shall have to
  consult someone else. We can't let the man off scot-free."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course you can't," Stella admitted. "Do you know, Sir Samuel, I
  almost wish you hadn't told me this. If I hadn't known&mdash;well if I hadn't
  loved Lionel Bly, or if I had not known him even, things would be very
  different. But he is in London now, and, naturally, he likes to see as much
  of me as he can.</p>

  <p>"Mind you, he has never asked me to marry him. What you might call a word
  of love has never passed between us. Lionel is the last man in the world to
  tie a woman up to him unless he could see some prospect of giving her a home,
  and that is a very remote contingency at present. But we quite understand one
  another, and if at some future time&mdash;Oh dear, here I am, in business
  hours, talking sentiment again. I have done my best, but I don't see how I
  can keep away from it."</p>

  <p>"Of course you can't," Sir Samuel agreed pleasantly. "My dear child, the
  British Empire was built up on sentiment. Now, don't you get worrying that
  pretty head of yours about that very nice young man. No suspicion attaches to
  him and probably none ever will. From what I can gather from inquiries I have
  made Sir Hercules Slaney is not the type of man who confides in anybody. Men
  who have a queer kink in their brain like he has always kept their own
  secrets. It is a case of great wits to madness nearly are akin. The village
  idiot is just the same. What I mean is that he likes to hoard things up. They
  always do. And I am quite sure that Sir Hercules is a man of the same type.
  Mind you, I quite appreciate your difficulty, and if you hadn't been so open
  and candid about that Admirable Crichton of yours, I should have known what
  to do. But as it is, I see that I shall have to move on another line. Of
  course, it is pretty hard upon you that you should have to be constantly
  meeting this young man and hearing him talk of Sir Hercules, whom he
  doubtless regards as a sort of hero, when all the time we know that he is
  little less than a cunning thief. It is going to be very difficult for you,
  my dear. I think the best thing I can do is to go round to Scotland Yard and
  consult the authorities there. Meanwhile, I want you to take that letter from
  Washburn and answer it in accordance with these notes I have made. Tell him
  that no sort of blame attaches as far as he is concerned, and that I am
  taking steps at this end to verify his suspicions. Type that letter out
  yourself in the private letter-book and post it personally. You can sign it
  if I am not back in time. And I think that is all for the present. Good
  morning."</p>

  <p>Stella went back to her room with her mind in a whirl. An hour before she
  was just the mere business girl on terms of strict commercialism with her
  employer, and here she found herself suddenly plunged into a whirl of
  intrigue and romance, and that in Bishopsgate-street, of all places in the
  world. She was glad on the whole that her employer, at the last moment of
  their interview had assumed the strict manner of the employer towards the
  employed. In a way it made it easier for her.</p>

  <p>She typed the letter presently, made a copy of it in the private
  letter-book and locked the volume away. Then she put on her hat and went out
  to her modest lunch, grateful for the opportunity of a quiet hour in which
  she could reduce her mind to its proper logical level. But it was not to be,
  because directly she stepped out in the sunshine on the pavement she found
  that Lionel Bly was there eagerly awaiting her.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch2">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR the moment, at any rate, the office in Bishopsgate-
street with all its
  responsibilities was forgotten. There and then in the sunshine on the crowded
  pavement Stella could see nothing but the young man before her and a dim
  background of pleasant memories with which he was intimately connected. The
  fields and the woods and the light falling on old-world gardens and pleasant
  intimacies in the ancient rooms where the Ravenhills and the Blys had
  foregathered for centuries.</p>

  <p>Quite a presentable young man, too. Just a typical Englishman to his
  finger-tips, with that clean and wholesome look that goes with the better
  brand of Briton the world over. Not dressed after the manner of Bond-street
  on a summer morning, but with a certain air of distinction that is at once so
  marked and yet so absolutely indescribable. Not handsome, either, but with
  the brand of sterling integrity and a pair of eyes that looked everybody
  smilingly and bravely in the face.</p>

  <p>And what he saw was a young woman in the first flush of her beauty. Rather
  tall, not too fashionably slim, but eminently what she appeared to be. And in
  her eyes was a smile of welcome and on her cheek a flush that was not due to
  the perfection of health entirely. And that glorious smile of hers seemed to
  light up the whole dingy thoroughfare.</p>

  <p>"Lionel," Stella cried. "This is quite unexpected. And yet none the less
  welcome. But what is the meaning of this? Have you taken a day off?"</p>

  <p>"Well, not exactly that," Bly laughed. "As a matter of fact my old man is
  busy on some important experiment, so I am free for an hour or two. That is
  why I came round here this morning, knowing that you always had your lunch at
  1 o'clock, in the hope that I might take you to lunch at the Ritz."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is quite impossible," Stella said. "I always go as far as
  Oxford-street and take my modest repast at Pagani's. You see, I am so
  important a person that my employer must know where to find me, even when I
  lunch. It isn't often he disturbs me, but that is our arrangement. I go by
  tube to Oxford Circus, because I feel that the little change does me good and
  the lunch-time music at Pagani's is excellent."</p>

  <p>Bly responded eagerly to the effect that it was all the same to him so
  long as Stella and himself were alone together, and, a few moments later,
  they found themselves seated in the famous restaurant at a little table laid
  for two which an infatuated waiter usually retained for Stella. And there
  they sat for half an hour, listening to the music and discussing their modest
  lunch, so absorbed in themselves that they might have been absolutely alone
  so far as the rest of the company were concerned.</p>

  <p>It was only when they were sipping their coffee and Stella was enjoying
  the one cigarette she allowed herself during the course of the day that it
  began to dawn upon her that Bly was unusually silent and preoccupied. So
  different to his usual flow of sparkling and enlivening conversation.</p>

  <p>"There," Stella said. "That is the second time I have asked you a question
  you haven't answered. I hope you haven't got anything on your mind,
  Lionel."</p>

  <p>"Well, I have and I haven't. All the same, I did want to consult you about
  something. To tell you the truth, I am rather worried about my old man."</p>

  <p>Stella was all attention at once. She was faintly conscious of some vague
  trouble in the air, something connected with the story that Sir Samuel had
  told her that morning. And now, here was Lionel Bly, more or less leading up
  to the same subject.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand you," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps I ought not to tell you," Bly went on. "But then, I always
  tell you everything. I suppose Sir Samuel does, for that matter? Being his
  confidential secretary, I dare say you learn many things that the public
  would be glad to know."</p>

  <p>"I am absolutely in my employer's confidence and proud of the fact,"
  Stella said. "Why, only this morning&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She checked herself and broke off abruptly. But Bly was too absorbed in
  his own thoughts to notice.</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't matter," he said thoughtfully, "if it didn't affect my future
  to a great extent. And when I say my future, I mean ours. He is a wonderful
  man in many respects, is Sir Hercules, and in certain circles he carries
  tremendous weight. That is one of the reasons why I have stuck to him so
  long. He has always promised to do something big for me one of these days and
  I believed him. But now I am not so sure. The last few months I can't make
  him out at all. He dragged me down from the Congo Belt, where we were making
  the most important investigations, and insisted upon settling down close to
  those diamond mines at Maggersfont. By the way, isn't Sir Samuel Oscar one of
  the big noises in connection with that mine?"</p>

  <p>Stella suppressed a start. Here was Bly, absolutely ignorant of the really
  startling story she had heard from her employer's lips that morning, actually
  leading up to another variant of the same amazing narrative. And yet he could
  not possibly know, even in a small degree, anything connected with the matter
  which had reached Bishopsgate-street from South Africa that morning. Neither
  could Stella give him a lead. She could trust him of course, and trust him
  implicitly, but then to do that would be to betray an almost sacred
  confidence. It was with a feeling of some uneasiness and discomfort that
  Stella sat there waiting to hear what her companion was going to say. And,
  whatever he told her, and whatever light his information would throw upon the
  mystery of the Maggersfont mine, her lips were sealed. She must listen to all
  he had to say without response. It seemed almost like treachery, but she had
  no alternative.</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me if you don't want to," she said. "Perhaps you are unduly
  worrying yourself."</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Bly muttered. "You see, it is like this. I could not
  for the life of me understand why Sir Hercules suddenly turned his back on
  the Congo. He was getting on splendidly and his enthusiasm was like that of a
  schoolboy. He has got some queer ideas, amongst the rest being that he can
  turn a nigger into a white man in two generations. I mean that in the course
  of thirty or forty years the coloured races of the world will
  disappear&mdash;so far as their outward appearance is concerned. Of course,
  it might be all nonsense, but, on the other hand, I have seen with my own
  eyes three generations of pure black African rats turned into white ones. And
  not in the tropics, either, but here in London, within a mile of where we are
  seated. Perhaps I ought not to have told you that, and I shouldn't unless I
  felt sure that you will never breathe a word of this to a soul. You will see
  where it comes in presently."</p>

  <p>Again that feeling of uneasiness swept over Stella. She might be wrong, of
  course, but it seemed to her that she ought not to listen to these
  confidences, without being able to return them and that she could not do so
  long as she was bound to respect the interests of her employer.</p>

  <p>"Do you actually mean that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly I do," Bly replied. "Mind you, I am no scientist, and I have
  only obtained the information I am giving you by keeping my eyes open. I
  don't suppose Sir Hercules realises that I have taken so much interest in his
  scientific research. You see, my business is to look after the camps, and
  give orders to the bearers, and all that sort of thing. I know enough native
  dialect for that, and I picked up most of it during the three years I was
  serving with the S.A. Forces in the Great War. Otherwise, I should not be
  with Sir Hercules at all. I dare say you will think I am a long time getting
  to my point, but I am coming to it now. Just as everything was going
  splendidly in the Congo Sir Hercules suddenly made up his mind to chuck
  everything, and go down to Maggersfont. When I asked him why, he told me to
  mind my own business. And, of course, a hint like that was good enough for
  me. When we got to Maggersfont Sir Hercules spent most of his time there in
  pottering about the diamond mines. He got a permit giving him permission to
  watch the Kafirs at work in the compounds, and he was there almost day and
  night. And all that time he was in a state of extraordinary nervous
  irritability. It was all very difficult for me, because I was practically in
  command of the expedition, and when I discovered that there was absolutely no
  money in the exchequer I began to get really worried. You see, there were all
  sorts of people to pay, and there was our hotel bill running on until the
  landlord began to be quite nasty about it. I hardly knew what to do, because
  every time I mentioned it to Sir Hercules, he would fly off the handle, and
  behave in the most extraordinary way. And then, all at once, money began to
  flow in from some mysterious source. My dear girl, I was more worried than
  over. Where had that cash come from out of nowhere? I knew that Sir Hercules
  had precious little of his own, and that he had borrowed every cent he could
  from his scientific and other friends. So long as we were up in the Congo it
  didn't matter, but when we were in the limits of civilisation then it was
  another question altogether. And then I began to hear extraordinary rumours.
  Rumours of the mysterious disappearance of diamonds from the compounds.
  Rumours of Kafirs who were swaggering about with their pockets full of money.
  There was one great buck nigger called M'Papo&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bly looked up suddenly, as Stella uttered a little cry and then glanced
  down demurely at her feet. For the life of her she could not suppress the
  exclamation, because in the letter she had read that morning from Washburn he
  had mentioned the name M'Papo as being that of the man who was so shrewdly
  suspected of being in league with the diamond thieves.</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's nothing," Stella said hurriedly. "Go on, Lionel, you have no
  idea how interested I am."</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, there is not much more to tell you," Bly
  concluded rather lamely. "But Sir Hercules has been a different man ever
  since. He was always inclined to be secretive and suspicious, but now his
  manner is almost unbearable."</p>

  <p>"But you really don't suggest&mdash;" Stella hinted.</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do. You see, I have all the accounts through my hands and most
  of the correspondence, and if that money had come through an ordinary
  channel, I must have known it. And, mind you, Sir Hercules is a man who
  brooks no opposition whatever. He allows nothing to stand in his path where
  research concerned and, honestly, I don't believe would stop at murder if he
  thought it necessary. My idea is that he took advantage of his high position
  and his great name to get inside the diamond compounds with the deliberate
  intention of corrupting the Kafirs. And don't forget that he knows their
  habits inside out, and can speak their language like a native. Moreover, he
  has a wonderful reputation as a medicine man. There are millions of natives
  in Africa who regard him as a great witch-doctor, I don't suppose you have
  ever heard of a native legend called the King Diamond&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Stella was prepared this time, and made no sign. Horribly guilty as
  she felt in listening to these confidences, she was powerless to speak. She
  would listen on to the end, even if some of these early days the one man in
  the world she really cared for accused her of something like black
  treachery.</p>

  <p>"Go on," she murmured, looking down and not daring to meet his eyes. "It
  sounds like a page out of 'King Solomon's Mines.'"</p>

  <p>"Yes, by Jove, it isn't far off it. I can't tell you the legend now,
  because it would take too long, but I heard just before we came
  home&mdash;which we did as abruptly as we had left the Congo&mdash;that this
  wonderful legendary diamond had been found and mysteriously smuggled out of
  the country by a native. If that is true, then I am sure that Sir Hercules is
  at the bottom of it. He is spending money right and left now. Why, his flat
  in Devonshire Mansions costs him over three hundred a year. And before we
  left England he was trying to sell the lease of it. And now he has ordered
  the most elaborate apparatus from all over Europe, stuff running into
  thousands of pounds, and, what is more paying cash for it. And for the first
  time since I have been with him he has locked up all his private papers, so
  that I can look at practically nothing. And then he goes off on mysterious
  errands for hours at a time, and comes back in the vilest of tempers. There
  is something very wrong, Stella, and I feel most uncomfortable about it. I
  don't want to get mixed up in any trouble, and that is why I am thinking of
  chucking my job."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mustn't do that," Stella cried. "At least, not just yet. I mean
  that it would be very foolish of you to do so unless you have something else
  in view. You see&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped suddenly as a messenger boy came drifting through the room
  shouting her name aloud.</p>

  <p>"Miss Ravenhill," he cried. "Miss Ravenhill. Wanted at the telephone, if
  you please."</p>

  <p>"That is my employer," Stella explained as she rose to her foot. "I won't
  keep you a moment now."</p>

  <p>She hurried off into the sound-proof box at the end of a corridor, and
  took down the receiver.</p>

  <p>"Stella Ravenhill speaking," she said. "Who is that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, that you, Miss Ravenhill," came the familiar voice. "No, I don't want
  to interrupt you, because there is no occasion for you to hurry back. As a
  matter of fact, I am going to Paris this afternoon to see the French Foreign
  Minister in connection with those Waterhouse Concessions. I am flying from
  Croydon Aerodrome at 4 o'clock, and I expect to get back on Friday night or
  early Saturday morning. I have notified the staff, and I leave you to carry
  on the private business in my absence. But what I really rang you up for is
  this. I want you to arrange for a house party at Ravenswood for this
  week-end. I have already notified Lady Margaret Severn, and she will go down
  to Ravenswood on Friday. Also, she will get the house party together."</p>

  <p>Stella murmured something appropriate. There was no reason for her to
  inquire who Lady Margaret Severn was, because she had known that popular
  society lady for years. And she it was who had invariably acted as hostess
  for Sir Samuel whenever he had a social gathering in the house where Stella
  was born.</p>

  <p>"So that's that," the voice went on at the other end of the wire. "And now
  I come to the most important part of what I have to say. I have managed to
  get in touch with Sir Hercules Slaney over the telephone and he has promised
  to come down for the weekend. A sort of lion, if you understand me. Of
  course, he could not very well refuse after everything I did for him in
  Maggersfont, and I need not tell you that I have my own reasons for asking
  him down. In fact, I arranged the party on purpose. And I want you to ask
  that young man of yours to come as well. I daresay you can easily get in
  contact with him."</p>

  <p>"Quite," Stella said demurely. "In fact, I am lunching with him at the
  present moment."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the deuce you are! Then I don't think there will be much difficulty
  in persuading that young man to become one of the gathering. What's that? Oh,
  yes, quite so. I think that is about all. Here, stop a moment. I was actually
  forgetting one of the most important points. I have just had a cable in code
  from Washburn to the effect, that M'Papo, that is the Kafir who is the rogue
  in the play, disappeared twelve or fourteen days ago, and is believed to be
  on his way to England in a Cape liner. Washburn has good reason to believe
  that he is working his passage in the stokehold. This bit of information may
  or may not have some significance, but I thought perhaps you would like to
  know it. And now you can go back to your lunch."</p>

  <p>Stella returned to her seat in thoughtful mood. It was almost amazing how
  these incidents were piling up one on the top of the other, and how
  sensationally events had begun to develop out of nothing, just as a
  thunderstorm piles up in a summer sky.</p>

  <p>She would have dearly liked to say something about all this to Lionel Bly,
  but then, in the circumstances, it was impossible. And in any case, if Sir
  Hercules Slaney was the scoundrel he appeared to be, then it would be nothing
  short of criminal if she dropped any hint which would give the eminent
  scientist a loophole by which he might escape the consequences of his
  criminality. No, she must be forced back upon a policy of silence, though,
  later on, that policy might, in a measure, recoil on her own head.</p>

  <p>But there was nothing on her face to show these feelings as she went back
  to her seat again. Lionel was sitting moodily there, gazing into space.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong, I hope?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing whatever," Stella smiled. "In fact, I can give you a little
  longer time than usual. But I have an invitation for you. Sir Samuel thought
  it would please me if you were invited to be his guest for the week-end at
  Ravenswood."</p>

  <p>"Ask me?" Bly cried. "My dearest girl, there is nothing I should like
  better in the world. It would be better than a fortnight at the seaside to
  see dear old Ravenswood again, to say nothing of the sight of the property
  that used to belong to my reprehensible ancestors. But I am afraid it is out
  of the question. Sir Hercules would never let me go."</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, Sir Hercules is going himself," Stella
  explained. "It appears that Sir Samuel got in contact with him over the
  telephone, and asked him down, and&mdash;well, he consented. And I suppose
  Sir Samuel thought it would please me if you had an invitation too. Sir
  Samuel is something more than an employer&mdash;he is my very dear friend.
  But he knows all about us and how well we understand one another. I thought
  it was exceedingly kind of him."</p>

  <p>"So it was," Lionel agreed heartily, "and I am most grateful. A week-end
  under the same roof as you! It seems almost too good to be true. Only I hope
  there won't be a big mob down there. I would rather not run into the old
  set."</p>

  <p>"Oh, there will be no mob there," Stella explained. "Not more than half a
  dozen altogether. And Lady Margaret Severn always acts the hostess, and you
  know how perfectly she fulfils that role. She is an absolute dear, and
  nothing would please me better than to see a match between those two."</p>

  <p>"But Sir Samuel is an old man."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind, my dear boy. He is barely sixty, and as active as a
  boy. And Lady Margaret must be at least fifty herself. I think it would be
  most suitable."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch3">CHAPTER III</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THAT eminent man of science and savant with a reputation
extending over
  the whole of the civilised world occupied, in the intervals between his
  expeditions, what ought to have been a luxurious flat in Devonshire Mansions.
  With a fine suite of rooms adapted eminently to social purposes, the place
  had been turned into something little better than a rabbit warren. There was
  a kitchen devoted to such casual cookery as was called for from time to time,
  and the smallest bedroom in the house where Sir Hercules slept on a straw
  mattress was practically the only living-room in the flat. The rest was given
  over entirely to collections of various kinds of curiosities from all over
  the world, whilst the drawing-room and dining-room were devoted to research
  work. Out of one of these led a small room which was lined throughout from
  floor to ceiling with cages filled with rats of various colours, ranging
  through the spectrum from white to jet black. These Sir Hercules looked after
  himself, and nobody was allowed to touch them; indeed, there was no one to
  touch them, because it was the great scientist's whim to live in his flat
  entirely by himself&mdash;even Bly had been obliged to obtain a temporary
  lodging somewhere near at hand.</p>

  <p>It was here, then, that Sir Hercules worked when he was in London. What
  food he needed he obtained from a little restaurant hard by, and if he were
  engaged upon something more intriguing than usual he would cook something for
  himself over the gas stove in the kitchen and eat it standing. It was his
  regular habit to shut himself up in the flat after a frugal dinner and refuse
  to answer the door even to the most pressing of callers. Moreover, he would
  take the telephone receiver from its hook, so that he lived behind his stout
  outer oak in a state of total seclusion, much as if he had lived in the
  centre of a desert.</p>

  <p>He was a tall, thin man, hard as iron and tough as whipcord, and capable
  of an endurance which would have shamed the average athlete who was a third
  of his age. He had a great bald head and a straggly beard, both of which were
  strangely at variance with an absolutely perfect set of teeth, which,
  somehow, seemed to detract from the coming burden of years. He possessed,
  too, certain attributes which are supposed to belong to the lower animal
  kingdom. For instance, he had an amazing sense of smell and a hearing so
  acute that, at times, it must have been absolutely painful. These were
  secrets that he had learnt from nature and a constant contact with almost
  aboriginal tribes with which it had been his custom to mingle all his life.
  On the whole, an extraordinary man, with a marvellous, almost uncanny
  intellect, so that most people were afraid of him. Not that Sir Hercules
  troubled in the least what anyone thought so far as he was concerned.</p>

  <p>It was a little after 10 o'clock in the morning and Sir Hercules was just
  beginning his day's work. He was absolutely alone in the flat, for Bly had
  not yet arrived, nor was he expected for half an hour or more. Meanwhile, the
  scientist had disposed of his hasty breakfast, cooked over a gas stove, and
  was now in the room in which he kept his small army of rodents. The cages
  entirely covered the wall, small, brass cages, each containing so many of the
  rather repulsive little creatures, with, here and there, other cages where it
  was necessary that the sexes should be divided. Sir Hercules slouched into
  the room, his big head on one side and an almost fatherly smile on his
  otherwise heavy features. He looked rather like a parody of a fond parent who
  has just joined his children in the nursery. He made a peculiar clicking
  noise with his mouth, and, immediately, the rats set up a shrill screaming
  which might almost have been heard in the street outside. It was evident that
  every one there recognised and welcomed his or her master.</p>

  <p>"Oho, my children," Sir Hercules chuckled. "Glad to see me this morning,
  eh? Had a good breakfast, all of you? Yes, I see you have, for most of the
  dishes are empty."</p>

  <p>An ingenious arrangement of sliding doors and little traps enabled the
  occupants of every cage to draw their own food much as a grain hopper works
  in connection with the filling of a cargo. So that those tiny, intelligent
  creatures with strange acumen and cunning could draw their supplies as they
  needed them and even raise their own water by means of an automatic bucket
  from a miniature well. Then two or three of the cage doors were opened and,
  immediately, the rats scuttled all over the floor and swarmed up the legs and
  round the shoulders of the professor, uttering little cries of delight as he
  fondled them. There was something almost parental in all this and yet, at the
  same time, rather repulsive. But not to the Professor, who fondled the little
  creatures much as if he loved them, which, undoubtedly, he did.</p>

  <p>"Ah, my pretties," he went on, in that harsh, husky voice of his that
  suggested chronic asthma. "Ah, my little ones. You go back again because
  father is going to be busy."</p>

  <p>It was strange to see how the rats of all colours and sizes immediately
  ceased their cries and immediately returned to their cages again as if they
  understood exactly what was said to them. Then the doors were closed, and the
  man of science went back to what in different circumstances would have been
  the drawing-room, but which was now fitted as a laboratory.</p>

  <p>The whole place was in a stale of dusty disorder. Only the tables in the
  centre of the room, on which stood retorts and other mysterious instruments,
  were reduced to something like tidiness. There were several tables, piled
  high with the various appliances, and in one corner of the room a smaller
  table on which were piled up numerous packs of cards. There were patience
  cards diminutive in size, and on the table itself was set out what appeared
  to be a patience problem. This was one of the professor's minor hobbies, and
  at such times as he came up against some abtruse problem he found change and
  relaxation in turning away to what seemed to be an innocent pastime. Even as
  he sat at work with knitted brow and concentrated frown he would turn every
  now and then to the card table, and mechanically move one or two of the
  pasteboards lying there.</p>

  <p>Then, presently, he rose and stretched himself, and smiled with the air of
  a man who is not displeased with himself. It was in one of these moments of
  unbending that the door opened and Bly quietly entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Ah, here you are," Sir Hercules said, in his husky whisper. "I wish you
  would look over those accounts for me. When you have checked them, I want you
  to go round into Regent-street and pay those people. They are always
  bothering me for money."</p>

  <p>"Shall I draw a cheque, sir?" Bly asked.</p>

  <p>"No, boy," Sir Hercules said shortly. "No more cheques for me. I am going
  to pay everything in cash for the future. What is the good of banks? They
  never help me. They cringe and fawn before me when I have a balance, but when
  I overdraw my account, to use their own jargon, they refuse to cash my
  cheques and thus cause me endless trouble. No, my boy, when you have checked
  those accounts I will give you the cash to pay them."</p>

  <p>Bly rose to his feet presently, and, crossing the room, laid a sheet of
  paper covered with figures before his employer. Sir Hercules gave it a
  careless glance and handed it back again, as if he were no longer concerned
  in the matter.</p>

  <p>"They are pretty heavy figures, sir," Bly pointed out. "They embrace all
  the new appliances which you ordered from Germany, Over &pound;2000
  altogether."</p>

  <p>Sir Hercules shrugged his shoulders impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Well, what of it?" he demanded. "What is money in comparison with my
  great work? And yet I must have money&mdash;everything would stand still
  without it. The State ought to see to those things. It ought to be their
  privilege to place ample funds at my disposal. Am I not doing a great work on
  behalf of humanity? Am I not on the verge of solving the American colour
  problem? I tell you the American problem is a standing menace to the peace
  and progress of the world. I can see the day coming when it will be a fight
  for life itself between black and white. And yet the solution lies in the
  hollow of my hand. I could go on&mdash;but why continue the subject?"</p>

  <p>The speaker rose and opened a safe in the wall. From this he took a great
  handful of notes and tossed them over to his assistant as if they had been
  waste paper.</p>

  <p>"Here you are," he said. "Help yourself."</p>

  <p>Bly obeyed discreetly enough, but strange thoughts were flashing through
  his mind. He was anxious and uneasy and wondering vaguely where all this
  money came from. He could see that it was in crisp Bank of England notes in
  value to a far greater extent than the amount of the bills he had to pay, and
  he knew that only a few days before that Slaney had been absolutely at his
  wit's end to know how to pay his rent. Moreover, he had just discovered on
  his desk a letter from the agent who managed the flats enclosing a receipt
  for the overdue amount. The money appeared to have come out of nowhere. All
  Bly's dark doubts and suspicions were once more aflame. His mind went back to
  those days at Maggersfont and the strange things that had happened there.</p>

  <p>And yet, he told himself, this was no business of his. All he had to do
  was to follow instructions, knowing full well that if he asked any indiscreet
  questions or ventured upon the least objection, he would speedily find
  himself without occupation. And that, just now, was the last thing in the
  world he wanted.</p>

  <p>He took the notes that he required and replaced the balance in the safe.
  There was nothing more to be said or done, and already Sir Hercules was
  watching him frowningly.</p>

  <p>"Do you want me to go round at once, sir," he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course," Sir Hercules said curtly. "And I don't know that you
  need return, at least not to-day. I have reached the crisis of one of my
  experiments, I am on the verge of a stupendous discovery and I must not be
  disturbed. You quite understand that, Bly; I must not be disturbed on any
  account. It matters nothing who wants to see me. But stop just a moment. You
  might as well take the week-end off, because on Saturday I am going down to a
  place called Ravenswood, which is the country beat of Sir Samuel Oscar, the
  head of the Maggersfont Diamond Corporation. He has very kindly asked me to
  spend the Saturday and Sunday with him and I have consented. That sort of
  thing is quite out of my line, but I have reasons which I need not go into.
  Therefore, you need not return till Monday afternoon."</p>

  <p>"That is rather a strange thing, sir," Bly said guardedly. "Because I have
  been asked to join the same party myself."</p>

  <p>Sir Hercules darted a suspicious glance at his subordinate.</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed, and how did that come about? Does Sir Samuel happen to be a
  friend of yours?"</p>

  <p>As lightly and casually as he could, Bly explained the circumstances. Nor
  did he fail to mention the fact that he knew Ravenswood in his boyhood, and
  that Sir Samuel's private secretary happened to be an old friend of his own.
  He saw the suspicion and the heavy cloud gradually disperse from the massive
  features of his employer, and those wonderful teeth of his expand in
  something that might have passed for a friendly grin.</p>

  <p>"If that is all, sir," he suggested.</p>

  <p>Sir Hercules waved him impatiently aside, and Lionel left the flat,
  carefully closing the heavy oak doors behind him. He heard the latch click as
  he walked down the stone staircase, his mind given over to the problem which
  had preoccupied him during the last quarter of an hour. And then, as he
  turned into the street, he found himself confronted with a strange
  apparition.</p>

  <p>He saw before him an enormous buck nigger. It was impossible to judge
  exactly to what nationality the man belonged; probably there was all sorts of
  native blood in his veins. But his prominent features were strongly Central
  African, with a dash of the Kafir. Anyway, all native as Bly well knew from
  his long experience of the African tropical belt. This black and polished
  individual was clad in the height of fashion&mdash;glossy top hat, well-cut
  morning coat, and cashmere trousers with patent leather boots and white
  spats. He wore a big flower in his buttonhole and in his tie was a diamond
  pin which, to Bly's experienced eye, was worth a considerable sum. It was a
  gorgeous vision altogether, so that Bly smiled as he took it in. But he was
  considerably astonished when the man pulled up before him and addressed him
  in quite fair English with an easy familiarity that caused Lionel's fingers
  to itch and his right toe to shoot out menacingly.</p>

  <p>"Morning to you, sah," the dusky man said. "You Mr. Lionel Bly, I think.
  But you not know me now."</p>

  <p>"I certainly have not the pleasure," Lionel said readily.</p>

  <p>The nigger did not seem displeased. On the other hand, there was something
  in his manner that suggested a certain satisfaction in the knowledge. The
  stranger beamed down upon him and displayed his teeth in a flashing
  smile.</p>

  <p>"No, you not know me," he said. "Nobody know me. I am an African gentleman
  who has made his own fortune. And I come to England to spend it. Loyal
  subject of the King and all that. As good as white man any day. Specially as
  I have money. But if you not know me, I know you and all about you, and I
  come this morning to pay my respects to Sir Hercules. You tell me where he
  lives, yes? And you go tell him that African gentleman wish see him. And you
  go now, yes?"</p>

  <p>"Look here," Lionel said. "I suppose you mean well, but if you want to be
  kicked from here all round Regent Quadrant, you are making a successful
  effort to achieve that end. If you take my advice, you will reconsider your
  position. I don't suppose you know what that means, but you can guess."</p>

  <p>The big man ceased to grin; indeed, he ceased to be a gentleman
  altogether. There was something subtly sinister and menacing in his attitude,
  so that the amiable atmosphere entirely vanished and the beginning of an
  electrical disturbance commenced to loom threateningly overhead.</p>

  <p>"You insult me, sah," the native said. "You mean say that Sir Hercules he
  not see me?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Bly said curtly. "I am quite certain he won't. He never sees
  anybody except by appointment, and even I dare not go near him when he tells
  me he wants to be alone. Still, if you are particularly anxious to be thrown
  down a flight of stone stairs, enter that door yonder and go up to the second
  floor. Right in front of you you will see a small brass plate with Sir
  Hercules' name upon it. Knock on that door two or three times, and I will
  wait down here to pick up the pieces. I am rather at a loose end this morning
  and a bit of excitement of that sort would not be unwelcome Sir Hercules is
  an elderly man, but I assure you not to be trifled with. Now, go on."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch4">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no atmosphere of suspicion or trouble in the calm
serenity of
  Ravenswood. The great house seemed to sleep in the sunshine, the lawns and
  rose gardens and the great elms behind appeared to be just as they had been
  any time in the last five hundred years, and, inside that fine old
  Elizabethan mansion, it was as if nothing had been touched since the days of
  the Restoration. The same old pictures, the same old furniture, and the same
  suggestion of refinement and mellowness. For Sir Samuel had been wise enough
  to take over Ravenswood exactly as it stood, and touched nothing. It was to
  this small corner of an earthly paradise that he welcomed his guests on the
  following Saturday afternoon. It was quite a small party&mdash;Lady Margaret
  Severn and her daughter, two prominent city magnates who do not concern the
  story at all, together with Sir Hercules and his secretary, and last but not
  least, Stella Ravenhill.</p>

  <p>It seemed strange to Stella to stand once more in the great hall with its
  lantern roof, and the walls adorned with portraits of her own ancestors, but
  that was not a feeling that she was disposed to encourage. It was
  emphatically no time for sentimental reminiscences, because she knew only too
  well that, in all probability, Ravenswood was about to see most of the most
  remarkable happenings that had ever taken place in its long and eventful
  history. It was the custom there, as it always had been, to take tea in the
  great hall during the warmer months, and there Stella was seated with Lady
  Margaret at the moment when Sir Hercules, accompanied by his secretary,
  arrived.</p>

  <p>She had seen him more than once before, but she had never studied that
  great gaunt figure with the interest that lighted up her eyes as he came
  shambling into the hall, and, not ungraciously, paid his respects to his
  hostess.</p>

  <p>"This is quite an honour, Sir Hercules," Lady Margaret said in her
  pleasant way. "I was always told that you never went anywhere. And yet you
  might not do better than spend a few days relaxing in such a glorious house
  as Ravenswood."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Sir Hercules agreed. "My friend Sir Samuel assured me that I
  should not be asked to play the sedulous ape in society surroundings. Not
  that I don't know a good deal about apes, because they are one of my special
  studies."</p>

  <p>This was by way of humour, and Lady Margaret smiled accordingly. She
  indicated Stella, who sat by her side.</p>

  <p>"I don't think you have met Miss Ravenhill," she said.</p>

  <p>Sir Hercules regarded Stella as if she had been some specimen that had
  hitherto eluded his attention.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is the young woman who used to live here, is it?" he asked. "A
  friend of my secretary's, unless I am mistaken. How do you do? One of these
  modern young women, aren't you? Business and all that kind of thing. Queer
  tribe altogether. Doing a man's work and keeping him out of a job. When I
  have the time to spare I am going to study what those foolish papers call the
  sex-war problem. Stop the modern trend if I can, because woman was only made
  for one purpose."</p>

  <p>"And what is that," Lady Margaret asked demurely.</p>

  <p>"Look after the house and have children," came the unexpected reply.
  "Those ancestors of ours weren't such great fools as people take them for. I
  suppose that is what you would call a rude remark. You take my advice, young
  woman&mdash;throw over your ledgers and get married to some decent young
  fellow as soon as you can. And put some more clothes on."</p>

  <p>With that he turned his back upon Stella and ignored her entirely until
  the light meal was finished. All the time Lionel had been standing fuming in
  the background waiting his chance to detach Stella from the rest and lure her
  into the grounds. He managed to achieve this elementary diplomacy after a
  time, and breathed more freely when he found himself in the garden with
  Stella smiling by his side.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of the old brute?" he asked. "Nice old gentleman,
  isn't he?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose that is what you call the eccentricity of genius," Stella
  laughed. "But let us forget all about him. I don't suppose he will look at me
  again. I suppose he really is as clever as everybody says. But his manners
  are certainly not engaging. And yet he strikes me as being simple enough as
  far as worldliness is concerned. Not at all the type of man who would go out
  robbing hen roosts."</p>

  <p>"I suppose that is a polite way of speaking of diamond mines," Bly
  suggested. "I see you are still thinking of what I told you when we were
  having luncheon a day or two ago."</p>

  <p>"Of course I am," Stella said. "That is not the sort of thing one would
  forget especially as I am so interested through my employer. But perhaps you
  are wrong."</p>

  <p>"I wasn't," Bly said. "I am more convinced than ever. Now, within the last
  eight-and-forty hours I have had more striking proof. I ought not to tell
  you, but I have said so much that I cannot very well draw back now. I told
  you that Sir Hercules had no money. I told you he had exhausted all his
  credit, and that of his friends. When I saw you last he had been threatened
  with a distraint for a year's rent. And now that rent is paid, not with a
  cheque, as is the custom, but in notes, which Sir Hercules sent himself to
  the landlord's agent. He doesn't know that I am aware of the fact because
  when the receipt came he threw the letter on one side, and I had to open it.
  There was a letter enclosed with the receipt duly acknowledging &pound;300 in
  Bank of England notes. Of course, it probably never occurred to Sir Hercules
  that the fact that it had been paid in notes would be mentioned, or possibly
  he forgot the matter entirely. He is like that. Most clever and brilliant,
  but apt, as outstanding criminals often are, to be careless with regard to
  details. I am not suggesting that he is an outstanding criminal, but it
  struck me as rather strange that he should have paid his rent himself in that
  fashion instead of leaving it to me as usual. And that is not the only thing.
  The day before yesterday there were some heavy accounts to pay, and I was
  sent with the money to wipe out the debt. Again in notes&mdash;running into
  four figures. Sir Hercules took them out of a safe in his room and more or
  less chucked them at my head. I am quite sure that there was at least four
  times that amount under the elastic band. But it was not for me to say
  anything, so I handed them back without comment. I don't like it, Stella, I
  don't like it a bit. There is something very wrong going on here, and if I
  could get another job to-morrow I should jump at it. Then there is another
  thing. Why did Sir Samuel Oscar ask Slaney to come down here? I can
  understand him asking you, and, through you, me. But Sir Hercules is not
  exactly a social ornament and when he gets excited his conversation is apt to
  be slightly Rabelasian. I mean, he is not adapted for the drawing-room at
  all. Socially speaking, he is a Yahoo. Then why was he asked down here? Do
  you suppose that Sir Samuel smelt a rat? I mean, does he suspect something in
  connection with Slaney and the loss of those diamonds?"</p>

  <p>It was a direct question and Stella was utterly at a loss to know how to
  answer it. Because she knew perfectly well what was in the back of her
  employer's mind when he extended his hospitality to the great scientist.</p>

  <p>It was impossible that she should mention anything of this to Lionel, and,
  just for a moment or two, she was silent. Then she saw the way.</p>

  <p>"I couldn't tell you," she said. "You must see that for yourself, Lionel.
  When I flatter myself that I am in Sir Samuel's confidence, I couldn't go so
  far as to say that he tells me everything. Nobody ever does tell other people
  everything. What a strange world it would be if husbands and wives told each
  other all their thoughts. It is just possible that Sir Samuel has something
  in his mind, just as you have something in yours. But even if he told me what
  it was, I couldn't pass it on to you."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is quite right old lady," Bly agreed cheerfully. "I am not
  trying to pump you, and even if I were, I am sure that you would not tell any
  tales out of school. What I want you to feel is that there is something wrong
  going on here and I am very uneasy about it. And I am quite sure that Sir
  Samuel has got his own ideas on the subject. However, we won't say anything
  more about it. Let's have a turn across the park for half an hour before I go
  back and attend to the old man's correspondence. He has an enormous post-bag,
  a great deal of it rubbish, but I have to go through it most evenings to see
  if there is anything in the bushel of chaff that calls for attention."</p>

  <p>"I never saw anybody quite like him," Stella said. "At one moment he might
  be little more than a child, especially with those blue eyes and wonderful
  teeth of his. And then he changes. It is only a glance or an alteration of
  expression, but there is something about him that frightens me. I am quite
  sure he would stick at nothing to gain his own ends."</p>

  <p>"You are right there," Bly agreed. "You see, he lives for one thing alone,
  and that is the regeneration of the dark races. He is quite convinced that,
  in the course of time, the whole world will be inhabited by
  whites&mdash;there will not be any Chinese or Japs even. A few months ago he
  began to speak as if he regarded himself as another Messiah, ordained to
  bring about that wonderful change. I am not quite sure that he doesn't think
  so still. And then, though he is mild enough when he is working out his
  problems, he has the most extraordinary outbursts of Berserk rage. Coming
  down in the train, for instance, he flew out at me like a madman because I
  had forgotten to bring his newspapers with me. I thought he was going to
  strike me when I told him I hadn't got the Times. And the first thing he did
  when he got to the house was to ask for it. Of course, by pure bad luck. Sir
  Samuel doesn't take the Times. It all meant nothing, but it was very
  uncomfortable for me, and all the more so because&mdash;oh well, never mind.
  Let us talk about something else. I must be back in the house in half an
  hour. Let us hope that there won't be any outbursts to-morrow, and then I
  shall be able to call the day my own."</p>

  <p>For some little time the two were immersed in their own affairs, and then,
  very reluctantly, Bly dragged himself back to the house again. He went alone,
  because Stella wanted to ramble about the woods that surrounded the park, and
  renew her acquaintance with many romantic spots which were full of the happy
  memories of her childhood. It was getting towards 7 o'clock when, at length,
  she turned her face to the house, passing through a large spinney with a
  swing gate at either end, and a grass path running down the middle. It was
  here, as she very well remembered, that she had shot her first pheasant, and
  she lingered for an instant where the track bent sharply to the right under
  the very tree where she had stood when she brought her bird down.</p>

  <p>And then she had something in the nature of a shock. Just ahead of her she
  could make out the long, thin figure of Sir Hercules Slaney. He was not alone
  either, for facing him was a big, black man, almost grotesquely attired in a
  full morning suit, including the conventional silk hat. It was not so much
  the dress of the man as its absurdity in those sylvan surroundings that so
  held Stella's attention. There was very little comedy here, as she was not
  long in discovering. The two men were quarrelling violently in a dialect that
  conveyed nothing to Stella, though their heated voices carried far. She saw
  the black man raise his fist in a threatening manner, and, almost instantly,
  Sir Hercules was upon him. It was strange to see the elderly scientist with
  his almost fragile figure handle the big native as if he had been little more
  than a child. Sir Hercules lifted him off his feet and swung him crashing
  into a heap of undergrowth, where he lay without attempting to move. After
  that, Slaney walked on, just as if he had merely removed some crawling
  reptile from his path, giving it no further thought. Not in the least wanting
  to be discovered, Stella turned in her tracks and made her way back to the
  house by another route.</p>

  <p>The whole thing was so strange and unexpected that it seemed almost like
  the fragment of a dream. There was no opportunity to mention the matter to
  Bly till dinner was past and done with and a move from the table was made.
  Just at that moment the butler came into the dining-room and with every sign
  of agitation whispered something in his master's ear.</p>

  <p>"Impossible, Jenkins," Sir Samuel said. "Who brought this extraordinary
  story? Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"It's Rawson, the head keeper, sir," Jenkins went on. "He found the man in
  the Leg of Mutton spinney quite dead. What am I to do about it, sir?"</p>

  <p>Sir Samuel ignored the speaker for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Here's a pretty story," he said, turning round and addressing his guests
  in general. "Jenkins says that a nigger has been found dead in the Leg of
  Mutton spinney."</p>

  <p>"Oh," Stella cried, carried away on the impulse of the moment. "Why,
  before dinner I saw&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She checked herself and stopped. It would be just as well, it occurred to
  her, to say nothing for the moment. She was congratulating herself on the
  fact that nobody had heard her speak when she caught Sir Hercules' eye upon
  her. Just for a flash, the look on his face was positively murderous in its
  baffled rage. And then, as instantaneously as if it had been a flash of
  summer lightning, his whole aspect changed and the mild blue eye and the
  flashing white teeth might have belonged to an innocent boy.</p>

  <p>It was Sir Hercules himself who broke the silence. He spoke smoothly and
  evenly and as if Sir Samuel had announced something of the most trivial
  importance.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything so wonderful about that, Sir Samuel?" he asked blandly.
  "I mean, is there anything so wonderful in the fact that a coloured man
  should be in the neighbourhood?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," Oscar agreed. "But when it comes to a dead nigger lying in
  one of my plantations, then I think you must agree that the thing does assume
  a sensational aspect. All the more especially as you are my guest."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see what you mean," Slaney said with a smile that showed his
  flashing teeth. "All sorts of natives come and see me. Even when I am in
  London I am not free from them, and nearly always they have some sort of a
  grievance. As a matter of fact, I must have seen the man you are speaking of.
  I was wandering about the park after my secretary came in to look after the
  letters and, sure enough, I found myself being followed by one of those
  fellows. He must have actually tracked me down from London. And, of course,
  he had a grievance. When I told him to be gone, he became very insolent, and
  I had to punish him. I threw him into a bed of brushwood and left him there.
  I only hope I didn't seriously hurt him. Did he appear to be hurt?"</p>

  <p>Sir Hercules turned swiftly to the butler as he put the question. All this
  time Stella was watching him closely. She knew in her heart of hearts that if
  she had not given Sir Hercules a certain lead when that cry broke from her
  lips he would never have volunteered that information he had given to his
  host.</p>

  <p>"That is the strange part about it, sir," Jenkins responded. "Rawson says
  he does not appear to be hurt in the least. There are no marks of violence on
  the body and no signs of a blow. Just as if the man had lain down and died
  there."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't see why we should worry about it," Sir Hercules said
  coolly. "Here, Bly, perhaps you had better take this matter in hand. It is
  just possible that we might know where the man came from and who he is. See
  if there are any papers in his possession. I suppose that the keeper had
  sense enough to send for the nearest doctor."</p>

  <p>"I did that, sir," Jenkins said. "I sent Rawson for the doctor at once. We
  brought the body in and it is now lying in a room over the garage. Dr.
  Masefield is there now."</p>

  <p>Bly, who had not said a word during the strange conversation, rose to his
  feet and followed Jenkins out. In a sort of empty loft over the garage under
  the strong rays of the electric light he found the local general practitioner
  bending over the dead body which lay on a pile of sacking. Bly hailed the
  doctor cheerfully, for they were old friends, and, indeed, in the bygone
  days, had been at school together.</p>

  <p>"I have just been hearing all about it, Masefield," Bly said. "What do you
  make of the business?"</p>

  <p>"Well, to tell you the truth, I can't make anything of it at all,"
  Masefield replied. "Look here, do you know anything about this chap? You have
  been mixing with niggers during the last few years and that wonderful old
  chief of yours knows all the African races inside out. And this chap is
  African beyond the shadow of a doubt. Kafir, I should say, and probably he
  followed your learned boss down here."</p>

  <p>"I should think there is not the slightest doubt about that," Bly agreed.
  "In fact, Sir Hercules as good as said so. The man accosted him only an hour
  or two ago and, according to Sir Hercules, was inclined to be insolent. So
  the old man tossed him aside as if he had been a baby, and thought no more
  about it. Oh, you can smile, my boy, but though Sir Hercules is quite sixty
  and looks like a lath, he has the physical strength of half a dozen men.
  What's that? No, I have never seen the man before, and Sir Hercules says the
  same thing."</p>

  <p>As Bly spoke he bent down to examine the body. Then his whole aspect
  changed.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, I am wrong," he said. "I have seen this chap before. A day or
  two ago I met him outside Devonshire Mansions, where he approached me. He
  wanted to see Sir Hercules, and I persuaded him not to. He went off, very
  dissatisfied, and I didn't give the matter another thought. But this is the
  fellow right enough. I recognise him by his clothes. Quite the Bond-street
  get-up. And yet there is something lacking. I suppose that is his topper over
  there. Yes, that's all right. Soames, of Bond-street&mdash;quite the best
  people. And the patent leathers are correct enough. But the coat is one of
  those ready-to-wear ones. Not at all bad style, but certainly never came from
  Savile Row. Here you are, look at the tab, Israels and Co., the Strand. That
  chap no doubt arrived in London a day or two ago, and lost no time in rigging
  himself out in all that splendour. Probably he was in a hurry. All this
  doesn't help us much, Masefield. The question is, what did the man die
  of?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there you have me guessing," the doctor admitted. "There is no sign
  of violence anywhere. Just a few scratches here and there, but, beyond that
  no evidence of violence. And you will notice that the scratches though fairly
  deep on the back of the right hand, are bloodless. I mean that no blood has
  flowed at all. No bones are broken, there is nothing to suggest a blow, and I
  am sure there is nothing wrong internally. What beats me is the amazing
  rigidity of the body. According to the evidence of your chief that man must
  have been alive up to a couple of hours ago, which means that rigor mortis
  can have barely set in. And yet the corpse is as stiff as if it had just been
  taken out of a refrigerator. I never saw anything quite like it before. I may
  be altogether wrong, but it looks to me like a case of poisoning. I don't
  mean a poison that is known to the British Pharmacopoeia. There are many
  poisons of which we know nothing. Native drugs and all that sort of thing.
  But I can't say anything until I can get in touch with London. There will
  have to be an inquest following a post mortem, after which I propose to send
  certain portions of the body to Spilsbury or one of those swells. Altogether
  a most mysterious case. However, I will get in touch with the coroner and try
  and arrange for an inquest to take place here some time in the course of
  Monday."</p>

  <p>"Then you think there has been foul play here?"</p>

  <p>But Masefield would not commit himself so far.</p>

  <p>"I don't say that," he replied. "But there are certain circumstances here
  that call for investigation."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't wonder if you are right," Bly said. "I have heard a good deal
  of those mysterious poisons from time to time, though I never saw an actual
  case. Still, I know that such things do exist, and perhaps when I come to
  talk the matter over with Sir Hercules he may be able to tell me more."</p>

  <p>Bly was about to turn away when his attention was attracted to the fact
  that the dead man had his right hand tightly clasped, whilst the left was
  open. In view of the rigidity of the body, this struck him as strange, and he
  called Masefield's attention to it. The latter took the rigid digits in his
  own.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it is rather strange." he said. "By Jove, I believe he has got
  something in the palm of his hand."</p>

  <p>With that, he manipulated the stiff fingers until they yielded, and
  something that resembled a tiny pebble fell out on the floor. Masefield gave
  a grimace of disappointment.</p>

  <p>But not so Bly. He pounced upon the stone and held it between thumb and
  forefinger to the light.</p>

  <p>"This is a diamond," he said. "And quite a good one, too. Now, I wonder,
  Masefield, if you will do me a favour. I would not ask unless I had urgent
  reasons for doing so. Would you very much object if I asked you to keep this
  little discovery of mine a secret. You can tell the police if you like, but I
  think you will be interfering with the course of justice if you allow this
  find to come out at the inquest. What do you say?"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch5">CHAPTER V</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR once in a way the tragedy in the Leg of Mutton spinney
attracted but
  little attention. There was local interest, of course, but nothing in the
  case calculated to appeal to the sensational Press, and certainly nothing out
  of which the artists on such periodicals could base an arresting story. It
  was merely that some wandering coloured man had been found dead in the
  plantation and that an inquest had been held upon him as a mere matter of
  form. The gamekeeper who found the body gave evidence, and so also did Sir
  Hercules Slaney. And the latter had very little to say. He was under the
  impression that the Kafir had followed him down to Ravenswood to lay some
  grievance before him. Considering the fact that he was so well known among
  the native races in Africa there was nothing strange in this. The man had
  been too excited to be coherent, and when he began to grow abusive the
  witness had merely thrown him into a pile of undergrowth and had gone his
  way, thinking no more about it.</p>

  <p>All this sounded commonplace enough, as did the evidence of Masefield who
  followed. Masefield testified to the fact that he could find no signs of
  violence whatever, though he was rather puzzled to account for the cause of
  death, and therefore he must decline to give a certificate until he could
  have the opinion of pathologists in London. Therefore, as a mere matter of
  form, he would like to have the inquest adjourned, say, for a month. This
  course was promptly agreed to, and, so far as Ravenswood was concerned, there
  was an end to the matter. And nobody knew except the police about the diamond
  which had been discovered in the clenched hand of the dead man and nobody was
  likely to know unless sensational events followed. Even the police were
  unaware of the reason why Bly had more or less insisted on their keeping the
  story of the diamond so profound a secret.</p>

  <p>It was late on Monday afternoon before Bly found himself back with his
  employer in the flat once more. Nor was he particularly annoyed when he was
  told almost as soon as they arrived at Devonshire Mansions that he would be
  required to travel as far as Berlin the following afternoon with a view to
  obtaining certain delicate apparatus from some learned professor there which
  was so fragile that Sir Hercules was not disposed to trust it through the
  post. On the whole, Bly was glad to be from under the keen eye of his
  employer for he had much to occupy his thoughts and he wanted to see his way
  before he took the next step.</p>

  <p>One thing he noticed, and that was the eagerness with which Sir Hercules
  tumbled out of the train on its arrival at Victoria Station and hurried off
  to the bookstall, where he asked quite excitedly for a copy of that day's
  'Times.' He folded this and thrust it into his overcoat pocket as if it had
  been something precious. It was the merest, most casual incident, but it was
  to come back to Bly with considerable force before long.</p>

  <p>"Now, you can go off as soon as you like," Sir Hercules said in his most
  abrupt manner, once he found himself inside the flat again. "Oh, I suppose
  you want some money. Here is the key of the safe. You had better take thirty
  pounds, and you need not hurry back if Professor Koch is not quite ready for
  you. That is all. Never mind about the correspondence."</p>

  <p>With that, Sir Hercules turned his back upon his assistant, and Bly went
  his way. He was at a loose end now for an hour or two, but he would go down
  to Harwich by a later train and take the night boat to the Hook of Holland.
  It was 8 o'clock as he stepped into his seat on board the train.</p>

  <p>Shortly after 8 on the following morning the postman climbing the stairs
  at Devonshire Mansions paused in front of the stout oaken outer door of No.
  16 and rang the bell. He rang again and again without reply, and then
  hammered on the door until the staircase rang with the noise of the attack.
  But there was no response from within, so that presently the postman, after
  delivering the rest of his letters, went down again into the vestibule and
  accosted the hall porter.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Joe," he said. "I have got a registered letter for the old
  bloke in No. 16, and though I have pretty well hammered the place down, I
  can't get any response from the tenant. Do you know if he is away from
  home?"</p>

  <p>"No, 'e ain't," the porter said. "He come in last night about 9, it would
  be, and spoke to me as 'e went up the steps. 'Adn't been out more than an
  hour, either, 'cos I see 'im go. A most unusual thing for Sir 'Ercules. Most
  regular man 'e is, specially at night's. 'E 'as 'is dinner sent in on a tray
  about 7 and 'e never goes out no more. But last night 'e did. But not for
  more than an hour, as I tell you. Then back 'e comes and up 'e goes and bangs
  'is door, and 'e doesn't come down again. I knows that, because I was 'ere
  till after midnight and on duty this morning again before 7. 'E must be
  in."</p>

  <p>"Well, all I got to say is as there's something wrong if 'e is," the
  postman responded. "You just come along o' me."</p>

  <p>"I don't think," the porter said. "If this is a case o' trouble, I ain't
  goin' to shove my 'ead into it. Best thing to do is to call in the nearest
  policeman."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later the postman and the porter, together with the policeman
  off the nearest point, were hammering on the door of the flat. Then the man
  in blue went down to the office and telephoned to an inspector, and, a little
  later on, the outer door of the flat was forced and an entry effected.</p>

  <p>In the big room, in the midst of its confusion and dirt and dust and
  medley of strange appliances, Sir Hercules was discovered on the floor quite
  dead, his body was strangely twisted and contorted, eloquent testimony to the
  fact that he had died in intense pain. A few moments later a police surgeon
  was on the spot and making a comprehensive examination of the body.</p>

  <p>"Poison," he said curtly. "The man has been poisoned. Whether by himself
  or by somebody else it is impossible to say. Speaking off hand, I should
  suggest a big dose of arsenic. The symptoms are all those of arsenical
  poisoning. But look here, inspector, from what I have heard of Sir Hercules,
  he would be the last man in the world to take his own life. I was only
  reading an appreciation of him the other day in a medical journal. He was on
  the verge of a stupendous discovery, which was going to revolutionise the
  coloured-race menace all over the universe. You don't suppose a man who
  believes he can do that is going to commit suicide? He has been
  poisoned."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean deliberately?" the inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"Most assuredly," the doctor said emphatically.</p>

  <p>"Well, I am not going to say you are wrong at this stage of the
  proceedings," the inspector smiled. "But how do you account for the fact that
  this outer door was bolted and barred when we broke it open? It is impossible
  for anybody to have entered the flat except in the ordinary way, seeing that
  it is on the top floor and there is no fire escape. You are not going to
  suggest that somebody came in and poisoned him and went away again, are you?
  No, it's deeper than that."</p>

  <p>With that the inspector turned sharply to the porter. But the latter's
  statement was not to be shaken. Sir Hercules had been out between 8 and 9 and
  the porter had seen him both going and coming. They had even exchanged a few
  words, so that there was no doubt on this point, and the janitor was equally
  positive that Sir Hercules had not gone out, and that nobody had paid him a
  visit between the hours of 9 and midnight. At that time he had gone off duty
  and his assistant had taken his place. Where was the assistant, the inspector
  would like to know? The latter was asleep in his bedroom in the basement,
  and, when aroused, was positive that nobody had gone upstairs in one of the
  upper flats between midnight and 7 in the morning when the relieving porter
  came on duty. And he was also prepared to swear positively that nobody had
  either entered or quitted the block of flats at any moment.</p>

  <p>"Um, certainly very strange," the inspector murmured. "I suppose you could
  not tell us, doctor, exactly when Sir Hercules died. We have it on quite
  reliable evidence that he was alive at about 9 o'clock, and that nobody had
  disturbed him. About what hour do you think he passed away?"</p>

  <p>"Well that is rather difficult to say," the doctor replied. "But somewhere
  between 9 and midnight. Rigor mortis must have set in some hours
  ago&mdash;say five. Beyond that I am not prepared to go, but I don't think I
  am far wrong."</p>

  <p>"Then you think it is a case of suicide?"</p>

  <p>"I am not going to say that," the doctor said cautiously. "Fact is, I
  don't see how it can possibly be."</p>

  <p>The inspector was decidedly of the same opinion. He made a careful
  examination of the room and the apartments beyond without finding the
  slightest possibility whereby a second party could have made an entrance to
  the flat and got away without being seen, the more especially as when the
  front door was forced the key had been unmistakably turned in the lock and
  both bolts shot.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," the Inspector said thoughtfully, "that this is going to
  be a big affair. The mere fact that Sir Hercules had a world-wide reputation
  is bound to add to the public interest. The man himself was more or less of a
  mystery, I understand, living for one purpose alone, which purpose he had not
  as yet achieved. But as far as I know, he was on the verge of it. I don't
  take much interest in such matters, but there has been so much talk lately
  that even the man in the street has been discussing Sir Hercules' wonderful
  discovery. But surely Sir Hercules had friends or am I to understand that he
  lived here alone?"</p>

  <p>"That he did, sir," the porter interrupted. "Never did he have a
  servant&mdash;not even a charwoman. 'E did for 'imself and cooked most of 'is
  own meals."</p>

  <p>"But surely he had a secretary or something like that?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir. Mr. Lionel Bly. Very nice gentleman, too. Been in foreign
  parts a lot, I am told. You see, he travelled with Sir Hercules everywhere,
  and always went abroad with him. Only just come back. At least, only a few
  days."</p>

  <p>"And you have seen no suspicious people hanging about?"</p>

  <p>The porter shook his head vigorously.</p>

  <p>"Not one, sir," he declared emphatically. "Sir 'Ercules 'e come back
  yesterday afternoon along o' Mr. Bly, and 'e goes straight up to 'is flat,
  and there 'e stays until 'e goes out at about 8 o'clock. And, as I told you
  before, 'e comes back about 9 o'clock full o' beans and walking like a young
  man, and then I 'ears 'im bang 'is door be'ind 'im."</p>

  <p>"And what about this Mr. Bly?" the inspector asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, sir. Mr. Bly was with Sir 'Ercules when they comes back
  yesterday afternoon, and I suppose 'e'd be in the flat about an hour. Then 'e
  comes down cheerful enough, and whistling and passes the time o' day with me.
  A rare pleasant gentleman 'e is, and always a good word for everybody."</p>

  <p>"Did anything pass between you?"</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, it did, now I comes to think of it," the porter went on. "'E
  says to me, 'e says, 'If you sees any suspicious people knocking about 'ere,
  keep an eye on 'em, especially coloured men or foreigners.' And, of course, I
  said I would. And 'e goes on to say 'e was on 'is way to Berling, and
  wouldn't be back for a day or two. That was why 'e wanted me to keep my eyes
  open and see that Sir 'Ercules was not disturbed."</p>

  <p>With that the porter had no more to say. There was nothing more for it,
  therefore, than to lock up the flat and seal the outer door, pending an
  inquest, which the inspector said would in all probability take place the
  next day. Then he went away in a thoughtful mood and face to face with a
  problem which was as strange and intricate as anything he had come across in
  five and twenty years' experience. It was so big a thing and so important
  that he went off, at once, to Scotland Yard to lay all the information that
  he had obtained before his superiors.</p>

  <p>And then, in that strange mysterious way in which the Press contrives to
  got hold of such sensational items, the mystery of Devonshire Mansions began
  to loom large in the earlier editions of the evening papers. They had
  naturally made the most of it, so that by afternoon the one topic of
  conversation, even in business circles, was the strange death of that
  mysterious scientist, Sir Hercules Slaney.</p>

  <p>The information percolated into the offices of the Maggersfont Diamond
  Company about half-past 3. Outside the newsboys were heard shouting the
  headlines of the latest tragedy. Seated at his desk, Sir Samuel Oscar heard
  the name mentioned, and at once sent out a clerk for an evening paper. He
  read the column or so of sketchy details, and, once he had mastered these, he
  rang his bell and Stella immediately entered.</p>

  <p>"Have you seen anything of this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Evidently Stella had heard nothing, so Sir Samuel threw the paper across
  the table to her and asked her to read. Once having done so, she waited for
  Sir Samuel to speak.</p>

  <p>"A most remarkable affair, my dear," he said. "Unless I am greatly
  mistaken, there is much more here than meets the eye. Here we have, first of
  all, the mysterious death of that nigger at Ravenswood, after he had been
  seen talking to Sir Hercules, and now within a few hours Sir Hercules shares
  the same fate. And the queer part is that both these people have died
  mysteriously, and in somewhat similar circumstances. You have not forgotten,
  of course, that Dr. Masefield refused to certify the cause of that negro's
  death. You remember that, don't you?"</p>

  <p>"Why, of course," Stella said. "Dr. Masefield said the man had died of
  some mysterious poison which was not known to our toxicologists. I wonder if
  Sir Hercules met his death through the same mysterious drug?"</p>

  <p>"That is the very question I am asking myself," Sir Samuel said. "The
  papers can say what they like, but that man never committed suicide. He is
  the very last man in the world to do so. Why should he, when he was on the
  verge of a stupendous discovery and just when he was about to crown the work
  of a lifetime? You may depend upon it, my dear child, that when proper
  investigations come to be made it will be proved that Sir Hercules and the
  nigger died from the same irritant. Of course, it is just possible that Sir
  Hercules was trying some dangerous experiment, but it is very doubtful. I
  feel quite convinced that this diamond smuggling is at the bottom of the
  whole thing. We have Sir Hercules' own testimony to the fact that this
  coloured man followed him down to Ravenswood and that they had words. But he
  never told us what those words were. Now, my dear child, can you throw any
  light on the matter?"</p>

  <p>Stella hesitated just for a moment. Should she or should she not tell her
  employer all she knew? Would such a course be loyal to Lionel Bly? And then,
  all at once, the mist cleared away she saw the way plainly before her.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I think I can," she said. "I am going to tell you everything. You
  know the relationship in which I stand to Lionel Bly. I don't want to do him
  any harm, but, at the same time I don't want to hold anything back. Now,
  Lionel told me certain things. Strangely enough, he had the same opinion
  about Sir Hercules as you have. He was quite sure that Sir Hercules made his
  way into the compound of the diamond fields with the intention of robbing the
  Corporation in any way that proved to be possible. You see Sir Hercules was
  exceedingly short of money, in fact, he was on the verge of bankruptcy. He
  owed some thousands of pounds, and when he got back to London he was
  expecting at any moment that his landlord would put an execution into the
  flat for a years rent. And then, suddenly, he became the possessor of
  thousands of pounds. There was a considerable sum of money locked up in his
  safe."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed. Did Bly tell you that?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly he did," Stella said candidly. "It was this fact that worried
  Lionel. He was quite convinced that Sir Hercules could never have obtained
  that money honestly. And Sir Hercules was not the man to stop at anything
  where his life's work was concerned. No doubt he was absolutely standing
  still for money when temptation came in his way. Lionel thinks that the
  temptation was offered to Sir Hercules by some brilliant international crook,
  who handled the stolen stones and passed his share over to Sir Hercules. That
  is, of course, after the stones had been disposed of. The idea would be for
  Sir Hercules to use his great influence to get into the compound, and there
  bribe certain of the Kafir workers, which would not be a difficult matter.
  And then Sir Hercules would walk out with the stones in his pocket and hand
  them over to his confederates, who, no doubt, knew exactly what to do with
  them. That is Lionel's idea."</p>

  <p>"And, by Jove, Bly is not far wrong," Sir Samuel said. "There is no other
  way of explaining how Sir Hercules found himself in possession of all that
  money. Now, I wonder if that unfortunate black who died so suddenly at
  Ravenswood was one of the Kafirs in the Maggersfont Mine?"</p>

  <p>"But that would hardly be possible," Stella pointed out. "The man M'Papo,
  who is probably in England by this time, would hardly be the class of native
  capable of arraying himself in Bond Street fashions such as the dead black
  did."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know about that," Sir Samuel smiled. "Some of those Kafirs
  are fairly well educated. I know that because I have been out in South Africa
  more than once. Lots of them speak quite good English, and many of them
  nowadays live in houses of their own. I know Kafirs who are well off, and
  they are passionately fond of fine clothes. There is nothing they love better
  than rigging themselves up like an Englishman. Of course, I don't know
  anything about this particular man M'Papo, but if he had been down to
  Capetown, or even to Kimberley, like a good many others of the clan, he might
  possibly have seen an official turned out in top hat and all the rest of it
  on a ceremonial occasion, and fallen in love with his kit. Do you know,
  Stella, I am beginning to have a very shrewd suspicion that the dead man at
  Ravenswood and M'Papo are one and the same."</p>

  <p>"Oh, impossible," Stella cried.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady, why impossible? The more I think of it, the more
  probable it seems. And he had plenty of time to get here. Moreover, we know
  that he was in possession of ample funds. Washburn's letter confirms that.
  Now, for some reason or another, it was absolutely necessary for M'Papo to
  see Sir Hercules. How he traced him down to Ravenswood I don't know, but that
  would be comparatively easy. Anyway, he did trace Sir Hercules down there and
  they had a quarrel. And it wasn't a quarrel over a grievance, either, I am
  inclined to think that the quarrel related to the King Diamond."</p>

  <p>"But no one has ever seen the King Diamond," Stella protested. "The whole
  thing is no more than a tradition."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps so. But then, don't forget that rumours were running all round
  the compound to the effect that a huge stone which the natives called the
  King Diamond had been found. If so, what became of it? Where is it at the
  present moment? Just as a mere theory I suggest that M'Papo brought it to
  England with him, having smuggled it out of South Africa, and that he had got
  it on his person when he met Sir Hercules in the wood and they had their
  quarrel. It might have changed hands then."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better tell you everything," Stella said.</p>

  <p>With that, she went on to describe the scene she had witnessed in the
  spinney on the edge of Ravenswood Park and exactly what had happened in the
  dining-room after dinner. She described in detail how she had betrayed
  herself and how quickly Sir Hercules had realised the fact that she had
  witnessed the quarrel.</p>

  <p>"And that is about all," she concluded. "But it seems to bear out exactly
  what you think."</p>

  <p>"I am quite in agreement with you," Sir Samuel said. "I am sure the whole
  business is connected with the King Diamond. A day or two ago, I was disposed
  to regard the story as a myth, but now I am not so sure. My idea is that the
  King Diamond is somewhere, but not in Sir Hercules' flat."</p>

  <p>"But why shouldn't it be?" Stella asked.</p>

  <p>"Because it has been stolen," Sir Samuel said crisply. "It was stolen by
  the man who murdered Sir Hercules. How that murder was done we shall probably
  never know, but in my considered opinion, the big thief behind the whole
  conspiracy managed in some way to get into the flat and did Sir Hercules to
  death."</p>

  <p>"But why?" Stella asked.</p>

  <p>"Because he knew that Sir Hercules had the King Diamond and because he
  wanted to gain possession of it and keep the whole proceeds to himself. That
  is why. The sort of man, evidently, who plays the game with his partner in
  crime up to a certain point and then, when the big temptation comes, puts him
  out of the way. What the police want to do is to look out for a man who has a
  big diamond to dispose of. Now, my dear child, you know an well as I do that
  great stones are not so easy to dispose of. A sale of a diamond of that
  description is bound to be talked about, and though the King Diamond couldn't
  be traced to the Maggersfont or any other mine, it certainly labels the man
  who possesses it. I think that I will put on my hat and go as far as Scotland
  Yard."</p>

  <p>With which, Sir Samuel had a taxi called and drove off at once to the
  headquarters of the police.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch6">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was just on the hour of six on Wednesday evening that
Stella, coming
  down into Bishopsgate-street, was surprised to see Bly on the pavement
  awaiting her.</p>

  <p>"Lionel," she cried. "I thought you were away in Germany. How did you get
  back so quickly."</p>

  <p>"Well, that wasn't very difficult," Bly said.</p>

  <p>"You see, I read all about this dreadful business in one of the German
  papers when I was having my breakfast yesterday morning. The 'Tageblatt,' I
  believe it was. There was quite a lot about Sir Hercules, including an
  obituary. You see, he being a great scientist, the Germans would naturally be
  interested. Anyway, I packed up my bag and came back as quickly as possible.
  And I went to Berlin to get some appliances and some test tubes containing a
  certain bacteriological cult. But I forgot all about those,
  and&mdash;well&mdash;here I am. Let us go somewhere where we can talk."</p>

  <p>So saying, Bly hailed a taxi and whirled Stella off in the direction of
  the West End, and there over an early dinner, they discussed the tragic
  events of the last few days.</p>

  <p>"Do you know, Lionel, I am afraid I have acted rather treacherously
  towards you," Stella confessed. "When you told me how disturbed you were with
  regard to Sir Hercules and all that money I actually knew all about it. But I
  could not say anything at the time, because it would be betraying
  confidence."</p>

  <p>"What exactly do you mean by that?" Bly asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, because Sir Samuel had exactly the same ideas as you. He was quite
  convinced&mdash;indeed, he had practically proved&mdash;that Sir Hercules was
  abusing his hospitality over the diamond mines and actually corrupting the
  natives. We had that from our manager, and subsequent events have proved it.
  So when this dreadful affair happened, I felt it my positive duty to tell Sir
  Samuel the story that you confided in me. I hope you don't mind. And, anyway,
  it doesn't matter now that Sir Hercules is dead."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is right enough," Bly said moodily. "I dare say we shall be able
  to save the poor old man's memory. What strikes me as being so remarkable is
  the fact that the nigger and Sir Hercules should have died within a few hours
  of one another. It looks to me as if some evil power existed in the
  background of which nobody knows anything at present."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what Sir Samuel believes," Stella went on. "He is quite
  sure that some international scoundrel lured Sir Hercules on to commit
  himself for the sake of the money he needed to carry out his experiments, and
  that there is still a bigger prize in the way of an immense diamond which
  this shadowy thief has managed to get away with."</p>

  <p>"You don't mean the King Diamond?" Bly smiled. "Of course I heard all
  about that legend yonder."</p>

  <p>"Indeed I do," Stella said earnestly. "Sir Samuel is now convinced that it
  actually exists and that it was in Sir Hercules' possession at the time of
  his death. It was indirectly the cause of his death."</p>

  <p>"You mean he was murdered on account of it?"</p>

  <p>"That is Sir Samuel's impression. He may be wrong, of course, but the
  theory is at least ingenious. I told Sir Samuel all you told me, and he has
  been to Scotland Yard. What happened there I don't know. I dare say he will
  tell me in time, but so much he did say. He said that he thought you might be
  able to help. He would like to see you some time to-morrow. I think the best
  time would be just after lunch. Knowing all about Sir Hercules's affairs, as
  you did, and having been with him all the time that diamond thieving was
  going on, Sir Samuel is under the impression that you might be able to do a
  good deal. He wants to punish the murderer, and get that stone back again. He
  is quite sure the stone exists, and he has brought me round to the same
  opinion. It isn't that he is so anxious to get it back as to probe the
  mystery to the bottom, and prevent anything of the sort occurring again. What
  he said was this&mdash;if you can manage to solve the problem and recover the
  King Diamond, he is prepared to divide the proceeds with you. Oh, Lionel, if
  you could do anything like that what a wonderful thing it would be."</p>

  <p>"It would indeed," Bly laughed bitterly. "But do you realise, my dearest
  kid, that you and I are further apart than ever?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" Stella faltered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think you know," Bly went on. "Anyway, I am out of a job now, and
  it is going to take me all my time to find another one. It was a comfortable
  enough post, and fairly well paid, but not enough to keep a wife on. And now
  I have nothing. You wouldn't like me to live on your salary, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Stella laughed, but none too happily.</p>

  <p>"It would be quite sufficient, with economy," she said demurely. "Now,
  don't look at me like that, Lionel, I was only joking. And I have seen too
  much of the world to build up any hopes on the strength of the King Diamond.
  It would be all very well in a romance, but then our little romance has been
  on rather the sordid side up to now. Still, such things do happen, even in
  this prosaic world, and you might have a stroke of luck."</p>

  <p>"I might," Bly agreed. "But since your employer has consulted the police,
  and probably told them all about Sir Hercules's little peccadilloes, my
  chance of bringing off anything spectacular has become an exceedingly slender
  one. All the same, I will come round to-morrow afternoon and see Sir
  Samuel."</p>

  <p>Accordingly, Bly presented himself to Bishopsgate-street the following
  afternoon, where he was received by Sir Samuel, who immediately led up to the
  matter in hand.</p>

  <p>"Very glad you have come, Bly," he said. "I badly wanted to have a chat
  with you on this unfortunate matter. There is no occasion to waste time in
  preliminary talk, since Miss Ravenhill tells me that your suspicions and mine
  are in line. Now, do you think that you can help me?"</p>

  <p>"In what particular way?" Bly asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, in getting to the bottom of this extraordinary complication. I
  don't doubt for a moment that the nigger was murdered any more than I doubt
  that Sir Hercules was the victim of foul play. They were both got out of the
  way by a third person whose interest it was to steer them from his path. I am
  sure, if we could get any evidence of identity, that the dead man down at
  Ravenswood is none other than that scoundrel M'Papo. Did you ever happen to
  see him in Africa?"</p>

  <p>"No, I am sorry to say I didn't," Bly explained. "One nigger in his native
  garb is very much like another, but the man lying at Ravenswood is the same
  native I encountered in London a few days ago. But I suppose Stella told you
  all about that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Sir Samuel said. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, let us assume for a moment that it is M'Papo who is no more and
  that he followed Sir Hercules down to Ravenswood with the intention of having
  something out with him. Let us take that for granted, because everything
  points that way. And, before I go any further, let me tell you another thing
  which even Stella doesn't know, or Scotland Yard, either, for the matter of
  that. At least, I presume not. When Masefield was making an examination of
  the body I noticed that the right hand was closely clasped, whilst the left
  was open and rigid. I suggested to Masefield that there was something in the
  palm of the hand and he manage to coax the fingers apart. And, surely enough,
  there we found a diamond which must have been worth at least &pound;100. The
  stone was handed over to the police with the suggestion that they should say
  nothing about it, and the fact was not mentioned at the inquest. But it
  struck me as a very significant discovery."</p>

  <p>"By Jove, you are right there," Sir Samuel cried. "It seems to prove my
  contention up to the hilt. Now, look here, Bly, I am going to get to the
  bottom of this and I am not going to rest until I am assured that there is no
  truth in the story of the King Diamond or otherwise. And you are going to act
  as my agent in the matter. I will give you an entirely free hand, and if you
  think it is necessary for you to go out to South Africa and make
  investigations, then I shall be quite ready to foot the bill. But that is
  entirely for you to say. I will give you the same salary that you had with
  Sir Hercules, plus any out-of-pocket payments that you may have to make. And,
  more than that, if you recover the King Diamond, then we divide the proceeds
  between us. Now, what do you say to my offer?"</p>

  <p>There was only one thing to be said and Bly promptly said it.</p>

  <p>"No occasion to thank me," Sir Samuel interrupted with a characteristic
  wave of his hand. "It is a business transaction altogether. I needed a man
  for a certain purpose, and you happen to be just the individual I require to
  fill the vacancy."</p>

  <p>"Very likely," Bly said. "But I don't think I should have been so lucky if
  it hadn't been for Stella."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps not. You see, I have the highest regard for that young
  woman. She is as clever as she is beautiful and well-bred enough for both.
  Oh, you need not blush, my boy, I know all about it. And if I was twenty
  years younger I would see you hanged before I put this chance in your way.
  Now then! Get on with it and don't come near me again until you have
  something to report. When I say that, I mean I don't want to be interrupted
  with all sorts of trivial details."</p>

  <p>Bly went away much easier in his mind. It was a big task that he had
  before him and probably an impossible one. But, at any rate, the immediate
  future was provided for and he was the last man in the world to meet trouble
  half-way. Still, he was looking for something which might not even exist and,
  in the end, failure might crown his efforts.</p>

  <p>The first thing was to obtain admission to the flat in Devonshire Gardens,
  and for this purpose he would have to apply to the authorities at Scotland
  Yard. Still, in the circumstances, this part ought to prove fairly
easy.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch7">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS was only to be expected, the tragic death of Sir
Hercules Slaney caused
  a tremendous sensation in certain circles. To the ordinary man in the street
  it read more as a case of suicide on the part of a distinguished and
  brilliant man of science. But there were others who held a contrary view. But
  as to that the general public would have to wait. There had been a more or
  less informal inquiry on the day following the discovery of Sir Hercules's
  body, but this had been adjourned sine die at the request of the police.</p>

  <p>No evidence beyond the finding of the corpse and its identification had
  been tendered at the opening proceedings, so that when Bly came to scan the
  papers with a view to obtaining certain information, he gleaned little for
  his pains. He was rather surprised that the police had made no attempt to
  discover his whereabouts, seeing that he was the one man in the world who
  knew all about the inner life of the deceased, so next morning he went down
  to Scotland Yard, and, after handing in his card, asked to see the individual
  who had the case in hand. A few minutes later he found himself in a plainly
  furnished office, sitting with Inspector James Paradine and Chief Constable
  Edgar Morrit, who informed him that they had the case in hand.</p>

  <p>"We are very pleased to see you, Mr. Bly," Paradine said. "Of course, we
  should have looked you up before this had we been less busy concerning
  certain details which have come to our knowledge. You were Sir Hercules's
  private secretary, were you not?"</p>

  <p>Bly replied in the affirmative. He did not want to tell these men too
  much, and yet, at the same time, he had no desire to conceal material facts.
  In a certain sense these men were his opponents. If there was any truth in
  the story of the King Diamond, then they might have heard the legend, in
  which case they would be as keen on finding the great stone as he was
  himself. And if so, then his reward would vanish into thin air. It seemed to
  him that he would have to feel his way very carefully.</p>

  <p>"I have been with Sir Hercules for some years now," he said. "Mind you,
  gentlemen, I am no scientist myself, so I can tell you very little about the
  great experiment Sir Hercules was working on at the time of his death."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we know all about that," Morrit said. "Wasn't it some crazy idea of
  eliminating the coloured races by turning them into whites? At least, that is
  what we gather from a conversation we have had with some of the learned
  professors at London University. It might have been the dream of a madman, or
  it might have been practical politics. But, for the moment, we are not
  concerned with that. What we have to do is to find out the enemy who murdered
  Sir Hercules for some reason of his own. Sir Samuel Oscar, who has consulted
  us in another connection more or less embraced by the same case, has a theory
  that the murder was the result of a quarrel between Sir Hercules and some
  unknown person with regard to some diamonds which were stolen from the
  Maggersfont Diamond Corporation."</p>

  <p>"Oh, Sir Samuel told you that, did he?" Bly asked. "Well, to be quite
  candid with you, that is my own opinion. Did Sir Samuel happen to mention
  some particular diamond?"</p>

  <p>"No, he didn't," Paradine struck in. "He spoke generally to the effect
  that Sir Hercules had abused his confidence and had trafficked with the
  natives with a view to obtaining funds to carry on with his experiments. Now
  you would know, Mr. Bly. Was Sir Hercules really short of money?"</p>

  <p>Bly breathed a little more easily. Up to a certain point, Sir Samuel had
  confided in the authorities, but so far he had made no mention of the King
  Diamond. And Bly saw no reason why they should be enlightened, at least, not
  at this stage of the proceedings. It might be necessary to do so in the
  interests of Justice later on, but, meanwhile, there was no reason whatever
  why that secret should not remain his own.</p>

  <p>"Well, at the actual time of his death, Sir Hercules was in funds," he
  said, readily enough. "But for some time previous he hardly knew where to
  turn for money. This I know, because I was constantly with him, not only in
  South Africa, but when we were in London. Sir Hercules was being hard pressed
  by his creditors, especially during the last week or two, and then, all at
  once, he seemed to be in the possession of thousands."</p>

  <p>"Where did they come from?" Morrit asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah that I cannot tell you. You see, for all I handled Sir Hercules's
  correspondence, I was never at his flat early enough in the morning to open
  the first delivery of letters. I mean those that arrive at about 8 o'clock.
  My idea is that Sir Hercules received that money in notes a day or two before
  his death, and that they came by registered post. You can find out if the
  postman delivered that registered letter some time early last week better
  than I can."</p>

  <p>"We have already done so," Paradine smiled. "Your supposition is quite
  correct. But, unfortunately, we have no idea whatever where the letter came
  from and what the postmark was. The postman says it was a bulky package in a
  large folio envelope."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is right," Bly said. "You may depend upon it the envelope in
  question contained a number of bank notes. You will find the rest of them in
  Sir Hercules's safe."</p>

  <p>"We have already done so," Morrit said. "There must have been over
  &pound;5000 in big notes. Now, Mr. Bly, where do you suppose those notes came
  from?"</p>

  <p>"Of that I have not the slightest idea," Bly said. "But I would suggest
  that they were sent by the confederate who helped Sir Hercules to smuggle
  those diamonds out of the mine. It is a dreadful accusation to make against a
  dead man, but I should be deceiving you if I didn't speak my mind. Sir
  Hercules was a monomaniac on the subject of discovery. I don't believe he
  would have stopped at murder to obtain the necessary funds with which to
  complete his life's work. And now, gentlemen, I am here to help you as far as
  I can. I don't want you to tell me anything you are averse to discussing with
  me, but I should like to get to the bottom of this business, and possibly I
  may be able to help you. Have you any idea as to how Sir Hercules died? I
  mean, how did he come to meet with his death?"</p>

  <p>The two detectives exchanged glances. Then Paradine nodded his head and
  Morrit took up the conversation.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason why we should not tell you that much," he said. "It
  will come out at the inquest, I mean the adjourned inquest, and I think we
  can trust you, Mr. Bly. A post-mortem examination of the body disclosed the
  fact that Sir Hercules died of an overdose of arsenic. He had taken enough of
  that poison to kill a dozen men. At least, the police surgeon says so, and
  there is no reason to doubt the correctness of his statement."</p>

  <p>"Most remarkable," Bly exclaimed. "I suppose the theory is that Sir
  Hercules committed suicide?"</p>

  <p>"Well, on the face of it," Paradine smiled, "we could come to no other
  conclusion. Here is a man found dead in his flat, the outer door, which
  appears to have been specially fitted&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It was," Bly interrupted. "Sorry."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I quite understand," the detective went on. "He did not want to he
  interrupted. Well, that door was burst open. It was bolted, top and bottom,
  and the latch was down. Moreover, it was the only possible way in which
  anybody could get into the flat, otherwise than by the front door. The
  mystery is further complicated by the evidence of the hall porter and his
  assistant. The hall porter saw Sir Hercules go out at somewhere about eight
  o'clock, and come back somewhere round nine, apparently in the best of health
  and spirits. Both the porters are prepared to swear that Sir Hercules had no
  visitor between the time he got hack and the hour the body was discovered on
  the following morning. In the face of evidence like that, I don't see how a
  jury could bring in any verdict besides suicide."</p>

  <p>"But you don't believe it was suicide," Bly said shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"No, we don't," Morrit said. "Taking all the circumstances of the
  situation, we are of opinion that suicide is out of the question. A man who
  is about to startle the world with an epoch-making discovery would scarcely
  take his own life just as the very moment that he had achieved a
  triumph."</p>

  <p>"Yes, and more than that," the other officer put in. "We have a piece of
  evidence that knocks the suicide theory endways. Here, I will show it to
  you."</p>

  <p>With that, the speaker unlocked a desk and produced a sheet of paper which
  he passed over to Bly.</p>

  <p>"I think you have seen that writing before," he said.</p>

  <p>"Undoubtedly," Bly responded. "That is Sir Hercules's handwriting. It is
  on his own paper with the Devonshire Mansions heading. And from the date,
  appears to have been written on the very night that he died."</p>

  <p>"Quite correct, Mr. Bly. Perhaps you will read the letter, and tell us
  what you think of it."</p>

  <p>With almost breathless interest Bly read the score or more lines which
  made up the communication in question. It was addressed formally to the
  Editor of the 'Times,' and visioned a stupendous discovery, which was going
  to revolutionise the world. The writer spoke enthusiastically of his years of
  effort, and how, at length, he had solved the colour problem which in the
  course of time, threatened the peace of the whole world. At the bottom of the
  first sheet the letter ended abruptly, with the words "therefore, sir, I
  propose&mdash;" and after that no more.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of that?" Paradine asked when Bly had read the
  letter for the third time. "I ask you, does that look like a man who intended
  to commit suicide? It was evidently the beginning of what was intended to be
  a long letter for insertion in our premier journal. Sir Hercules had reached
  the point where the letter breaks off and then something happened, something
  unexpected and tragic that prevented the letter from ever being
  finished."</p>

  <p>"But what did happen?" Bly asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that we have to decide," Morrit said. "It is quite evident that Sir
  Hercules was sitting down writing the letter when the blow fell. And what
  sort of a blow it was we may never discover. One fantastic idea that occurs
  to me is that Sir Hercules was strangled or partially strangled by some one
  in the flat who was working with a pair of padded gloves. The sort of things
  that leave no mark. Then, when the victim was more or less unconscious, a
  capsule containing a fatal dose of arsenic was forced down his throat. Of
  course, the idea was to convey positive evidence of suicide."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but&mdash;" Bly interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know what you are going to say. What about the bolted and barred
  door, and how did the man who had hidden himself in the flat succeed in
  getting away when the porter was downstairs? You see, he would have to get
  upstairs and down again. We have examined the porter and his assistant, and
  there is no shaking their evidence on that point. We both feel convinced that
  Sir Hercules was murdered, despite evidence to the contrary, and we base our
  supposition on that letter. Now, Mr. Bly, is there any way in which you can
  help us?"</p>

  <p>"That," said Bly, "is what I am here to find out. I have to thank you for
  so candidly taking me into your confidence and I need hardly say that I will
  do everything in my power to assist you. In fact, I came here for that
  purpose. Perhaps if I could have a few hours by myself in the flat and the
  opportunity of thoroughly overhauling Sir Hercules's papers, I might hit upon
  something. Still, if you object to that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Once more the two detectives exchanged glances.</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Morrit said at length. "So far as I am concerned, you
  can have the key and the run of the flat for as long as you like. We have
  taken away all we want for the present, and we have had the front door of the
  flat properly repaired. You probably have a latchkey of your own."</p>

  <p>"Certainly I have," Bly explained. "I was under the impression that you
  had sealed up the flat. But, seeing that you no longer have your seal on it,
  I think I will go and have a look round. I suppose I can go in and out as I
  like."</p>

  <p>With this assurance, Bly went his way, and a little while later found
  himself within those dark and dingy rooms at the top of Devonshire Mansions.
  He proceeded to pull up the blinds and let in the sunshine so that he could
  see everything about him, and, at the same time, dissipate the sinister
  atmosphere that hung over the place like a cloud. And then there arose a
  hideous clamour that fairly startled him for a moment.</p>

  <p>"By Jove, the rats!" he exclaimed. "I expect the poor brutes are
  starving."</p>

  <p>He pushed his way into the small inner room and opened the window to let
  out the appalling smell that suffocated him like a gas attack. The sinister
  little creatures were climbing up and down the bars of their cages in a state
  of frantic hunger. It was some time before Bly could fill up the food troughs
  and the little water wells, after which the clamour subsided so that he could
  go back to the scene of the tragedy and begin his investigations. For a long
  time there was nothing to reward his intimate search. For the best part of
  three hours he pored over piles of correspondence and scores of letters, none
  of which threw the slightest light on the tragedy.</p>

  <p>Here was everything, just as Sir Hercules had left it. His papers on the
  desk, a litter of apparatus all over the big table in the centre of the room,
  on the mantelshelf a pile of unopened packs of patience cards. On a little
  table between two windows more cards set out in the form of a problem. Bly
  noted vaguely that there was a complete pack of them, and that they were
  arrayed neatly in rows upon the table. There was nothing in this, because, as
  Bly very well knew, Sir Hercules had been in the habit of seeking relaxation
  in a game of patience whenever he found himself up against some knotty
  problem in his experiments. It was just a letting down of nervous tension,
  and Bly had seen his late employer sometimes for hours together playing with
  the diminutive cards as if his whole future depended upon it. Then suddenly
  he would cast them on one side and rush back to the big table again under
  stress of some sudden inspiration.</p>

  <p>For some minutes Bly stood gazing moodily down upon the series of pictures
  that lay before him. Then, for the first time, he noticed something that he
  had never seen before.</p>

  <p>All the cards were numbered!</p>

  <p>In the corner of the whole fifty-two of them were the numerals from one to
  the full number and then again a printed letter in the left-hand top corner
  of each which letter had been placed just above the numbers. In other words,
  the whole alphabet twice over. There was nothing in this at the first sight
  to attract attention until Bly remembered that he had never seen such
  numbering and lettering on a patience problem before. It was just possible,
  he thought, that Sir Hercules had been spending his spare moments in
  inventing a new problem. And yet, on reflection, that scarcely seemed
  possible, as Sir Hercules had been in the habit of obtaining his problems
  from a sort of club, nor was he the kind of man who would waste his time
  inventing problems when he could buy as many as he liked for a few pence
  each. No, it was quite evident that those numbers and letters had some real
  significance.</p>

  <p>Bly wandered across from the little table to the desk and there, for the
  first time, he noticed a copy of Monday's 'Times.' It was folded again and
  again as if to place in an overcoat pocket. Beyond doubt, it was the copy of
  the premier journal which Sir Hercules had bought with such frenzied
  eagerness at Victoria Station on the previous Monday afternoon when he and
  his secretary had got back to London following the inquiry into the death of
  the mysterious negro whose body had been found in the Leg of Mutton spinney
  at Ravenswood. And then, half unconsciously, it flashed across Bly's mind
  that this eagerly sought newspaper might conceal some clue to the
  mystery.</p>

  <p>He switched on the lights overhead, and spread out the paper on one corner
  of the big table. There was nothing in the inner sheets, but the outer page
  was stained with some sort of acid. And just above this stain was an
  announcement in the Agony Column written entirely in cipher. Bly ran his eye
  down this in a vague, uncertain way, then pulled up with a start.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" he exclaimed, "I wonder if this has got anything to do with it.
  The very day of the tragedy, too! I must go into this. But it isn't going to
  be easy."</p>

  <p>The point that had attracted his attention lay in the fact that at the
  beginning of the cipher, which was entirely in figures, were the words 'White
  Rat,' and at the end of it another single word, 'Patience.' Just that, and
  nothing more.</p>

  <p>It might be nothing and it probably was. Yet it seemed a strange thing
  that somebody under the pseudonym of 'White Rat' should be corresponding with
  another person using the appellation of 'Patience' through the Agony Column
  of 'The Times.' Because here in the flat itself was a patience problem
  numbered and lettered, and, under the same roof at least, half a dozen cases
  of white rats in various stages of adolescence. He might be wrong, Bly
  thought, but, at any rate, it seemed to him that here was a matter that was
  well worthy of investigation. Once more he went back to the small table,
  where the whole pack of cards was laid out, and then he noticed for the first
  time that they were lying there in suits, beginning from the top with clubs,
  ranging from ace to two and then just on in the same order with spades,
  followed by diamonds and hearts. No doubt, they had been placed in this order
  so that Sir Hercules could read 'The Times' cipher all the more easily, and
  Bly was confirmed in his opinion by the numbers on the cards and the
  corresponding letters of the alphabet over them.</p>

  <p>No sooner had this dawned upon him than he had another idea. He searched
  about until he found a pile of four or five copies of 'The Times' in sequence
  neatly placed one upon the other on the floor. This bit of neatness on Sir
  Hercules' part was so unlike the distinguished scientist that it struck Bly
  as being little more than significant. He turned over the pile carefully
  until he came on a copy of the paper dated three or four days before in which
  he discovered another of the ciphers. And this was headed exactly as the
  later one save that the words at either end were transposed. That is to say,
  not 'White Rat' and 'Patience' this time, but 'Patience' and 'White Rat.'
  Moreover, the first cipher was much shorter than the other, and not half the
  length, and ended with a note of interrogation.</p>

  <p>It needed no great intelligence to grasp the fact that cipher number one
  contained a query addressed to some unknown individual, and that cipher
  number two was an answer to that question. Then it seemed only logical to
  deduce that there was somebody asking a question or making an assignation,
  the reply to which appeared in Monday's issue of the journal. Moreover, Bly
  knew now that Sir Hercules had gone out on Monday night for an hour or so,
  which was entirely contrary to his usual custom; indeed, he had never known
  him to do such a thing before ever since they had been together in
  London.</p>

  <p>So far, the matter was encouraging enough, but there was a long road to
  hoe before Bly could feel that he was on the track of something likely to be
  of the least importance.</p>

  <p>And then he had another inspiration. There were twenty-six cards on the
  table which corresponded with the twenty-six letters of the alphabet.
  Evidently, then, each card represented a distinct letter. But then why were
  there fifty-two cards on the table? The solution when it flashed upon Bly's
  mind was so simple that he could have kicked himself.</p>

  <p>Of course, half the the cards represented the capitals, and the other half
  the small letters. Once this was established, Bly began to see his way. By
  referring to the letters and numerals he could see that he was on the right
  path. Then he sat down to work out the puzzle in grim earnest.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch8">CHAPTER VIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">BUT though Bly worked unceasingly until his head ached and
his eyes began
  to grow tired, he could not get to the bottom of the cipher. He was puzzled
  again and again at different points, more especially when figures took the
  place of words like Ace and King, and then reverted again to numerals.
  Finally, he gave up the task, and contented himself with a little scheme of
  his own. He took a couple of packs of unopened patience cards from the pile
  on the mantelpiece, and put them in his pocket. Then, very carefully, on a
  sheet of notepaper, he made a list of the cards in exactly the same order as
  they lay on the table, with the numbers and letters in the corners. Here he
  had a facsimile of the patience problem for his own private delectation, so
  that he could go on with his investigations in the quietude of his rooms. He
  made a note of the date of the two copies of the 'Times' that contained the
  puzzling cipher with the intention of ordering duplicates from his
  newsagent.</p>

  <p>At any rate, he would disturb absolutely nothing in the room, but it was
  long odds that the police would attach no significance to the cards on the
  little table, nor, in all probability, would they trouble to search the files
  of the 'Times.' It might be necessary later on in the interests of justice to
  tell the police what he had discovered, but, meanwhile, there was nothing to
  gain by conveying such scrappy information as he had gathered to the people
  at Scotland Yard. They might or might not lay their hands eventually upon the
  man who had murdered Sir Hercules, that is if he was murdered at all, but
  that would not aid in the finding of the King Diamond. And the discovery of
  that more or less mythical stone meant such a lot to Bly and the woman be
  loved. He would put the thing out of his mind till tomorrow. Nothing was to
  be gained by hurry, and now that he was no longer concerned with Sir
  Hercules's affairs he had all the time he needed before him. He replaced
  everything exactly as he had found it, and then, having succeeded in getting
  hold of Paradine on the flat telephone, and telling that individual that his
  labours had been in vain&mdash;which was no more than the truth&mdash;he
  closed the door of the flat, and went back to his lodgings.</p>

  <p>It was just after lunch on the following day when he called at
  Bishopsgate-street and asked to see Sir Samuel in regard to some small matter
  connected with the case. Sir Samuel was in his private room, and would see
  him at once.</p>

  <p>"Well, anything to report?" the latter asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, so far," Bly replied. "But I don't mind telling you that I have
  got hold of a clue. It is a very slender one at present, and, if you don't
  mind, sir, I would rather not discuss it with you until I am more sure of my
  ground."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite right, quite right," Sir Samuel agreed. "All the same, I am
  glad you came round, because I have got a little thing here which I think may
  be of assistance to you. Very strange how the most trivial circumstances
  often turn out of the utmost importance. I was dining with some friends last
  night, and the mystery of Slaney's death cropped up. Very naturally in the
  circumstances; people are talking of little else. My hostess had never seen
  Slaney, and wanted to know all about him. I gave her the best description I
  could, and drew a picture of the man and his peculiar habits. Whilst we were
  talking, my hostess' daughter said that a few days ago she had seen a
  snapshot of the great man in the 'Daily Photo.' One word led to another, and
  the butler was asked if he thought it possible to obtain a copy of the issue
  containing that photograph. The man thought he could, because he knew that
  one of the housemaids took the paper in regularly for the sake of the serial
  story. Well, to cut it short, the paper was produced, and there, sure enough,
  was a life-like picture of Sir Hercules, just as he came out of the hall
  leading from his flat. Now, it occurred to me that other people must have
  seen that snapshot besides the woman I am speaking of."</p>

  <p>"Millions, probably," Bly said casually.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but that is not the point. Now, we know that your late employer left
  the flat on the night of his death, and was away for an hour or so. Where did
  he go and whom did he see in that time? Surely you must realise the
  importance of that question. If we could ascertain Sir Hercules's whereabouts
  for that precious hour, where he went, and whom he was with, we should be a
  long way on the road to the solution of the mystery. He went out for some
  particular purpose, and he must have seen somebody. I mean, he must have been
  in the company of some one. It might merely have been the man from whom he
  bought the arsenic. That is, of course, if he did purchase the stuff. But
  during the time between eight o'clock and nine on Monday night Sir Hercules
  must have had more than one companion. Isn't it a most significant thing that
  no one has come forward who is in a position to tell us in whose company Sir
  Hercules passed that hour. Here is a big sensation, that must have been read
  by everybody who is capable of reading a newspaper. And yet nobody comes
  forward. Why?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I quite see your point," Bly agreed. "I must have been very stupid
  not to have noticed it before. You mean that there is a person, or persons,
  here in London who could explain how that vital hour was spent."</p>

  <p>"Of course I do. And it is absolutely certain that the person or persons
  are deliberately keeping in the background. The question is, how are we going
  to bring them into the open?"</p>

  <p>Bly went away with this new weight on his mind. But he was back again
  shortly after five, with the intention of meeting Stella and taking her out
  to tea.</p>

  <p>Once they were established in a cosy corner of the exclusive little shop
  in South Molton-street, he proceeded to tell her of the arrangement he had
  made with Sir Samuel. And if this great scheme came off, then there would be
  nothing to worry about so far as the future was concerned.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid the end is a long way distant," Stella sighed gently. "To
  begin with, you are looking for a thing that may not even exist."</p>

  <p>"I have thought of that," Bly said. "Still, I believe there is something
  in it after all. I believe that as firmly as I do that Sir Hercules was
  murdered. You may say that the circumstances surrounding the case make it
  impossible that Sir Hercules did not take his own life. The bolted door, the
  only entrance to the flat. The evidence of those two porters. The fact that
  Sir Hercules came back after 9 o'clock in the best of health and spirits. And
  the more important fact still that when he was stricken down, he was just
  writing a letter to the editor of the 'Times.' And men who are doing that
  sort of thing don't commit suicide. What's that? How did the murderer get
  into the flat? Well, of course, that is a terrible snag. But I am convinced
  that he did get in and out again. And I believe he was murdered by his
  confederate whom we will call X. Now, this X was the man who first conceived
  the idea of stealing diamonds from the Maggersfont Mine through Sir Hercules.
  He probably found out that the poor old chap was at his wits' ends for money
  and that he was prepared to do anything so long as he could lay his hands
  upon a substantial amount. Hence all that business with the natives in the
  mine and the subsequent following of Sir Hercules to London by M'Papo. Of
  course, M'Papo was a rascal who stole the stones and handed them over to Sir
  Hercules, knowing that he could smuggle them out of the mine without fear of
  detection. A very good scheme and one that seems to have been absolutely
  successful. You see, up to a point, this mysterious X played the game. It was
  he, of course, who disposed of the stones and handed Sir Hercules his share
  of the plunder."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but why should he, so to speak, kill the goose that laid the golden
  eggs?" Stella asked shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I was coming to," Bly went on. "And that is where
  the King Diamond comes on the scene. M'Papo, or some other Kaffir in the
  mine, found that stone, hence all the talk about it just before we left South
  Africa. You remember I told you how the compound was fairly buzzing with the
  story. There is never smoke without fire, and I am firmly convinced that a
  really magnificent diamond was found at about that time. It was probably
  handed over by M'Papo to Sir Hercules, who, I should say, refused to part
  with it. You see, by that time he had got all the ready money he required and
  more than enough to last him for quite a long time. Also, to do him justice,
  he was no money grubber. Also, if he had enough for his immediate wants, he
  did not worry about to-morrow. But it is just possible that when the King
  Diamond found its way into his hands he had his own reasons for keeping it.
  But probably Mr. X discovered the whereabouts of the treasure and the
  prospect of a huge fortune was too much for him. So he made up his mind not
  only to get hold of the King Diamond, but to deprive his partner in crime of
  his share of the proceeds. Hence the tragedy."</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary idea," Stella exclaimed. "And yet more remarkable
  things have happened. But Sir Hercules and Mr. X were in constant
  communication, wouldn't it have been far easier for X to have stolen the
  stone and then declared that he knew nothing whatever about it. If he had
  done that, Sir Hercules would never have dared to make the matter public. You
  see what I mean, Lionel?"</p>

  <p>"I see what you mean quite clearly," Bly replied. "But those two were not
  in constant communication. All their business was done through secret
  hiding-places, and in connection with ciphers, in the local South African
  papers. It would never have done for those two to have been seen together. My
  dear girl, you don't know the risks of I.D.B. in South Africa. Very few
  criminals indeed slip through the fingers of the Cape police. And if they do,
  they have extraordinary luck. No. Sir Hercules came back home with that stone
  in his possession, and knew it. Besides I have got hold of the cipher."</p>

  <p>"You really mean that?" Stella cried.</p>

  <p>"Well, I have got it by the tail, anyway. It may slip through my fingers
  in the end, but my grasp is fairly firm. I know that Sir Hercules was in
  communication with some confederate, through a code in 'The Times.' Even now,
  the man X is taking no chances. My idea is that on the night of his death Sir
  Hercules went out to meet him. Probably because they had come to terms, and
  very likely with a view to transferring the King Diamond to X for disposal.
  But all that is in the air as yet. At any rate I have the cipher in my
  pocket, and I am the only man who attaches any significance to it. As a
  matter of fact, just before I came here I called at Scotland Yard and saw one
  of their big men there who has the case in hand. I mean Inspector James
  Paradine. He can find nothing in the flat that gives him the slightest clue
  to the mystery. I took a certain risk when I mentioned patience cards but he
  only looked at me solemnly and asked me what I meant. As a matter of fact, I
  meant a great deal, but I could see that he only regarded my question as a
  trivial one and then began to talk about other things. But, all the same,
  behind a patience problem that lies on the poor old gentleman's table in his
  flat is the key of the puzzle."</p>

  <p>"It all sounds very exciting," Stella said. "Won't you tell me what you
  have got at the back of your mind?"</p>

  <p>Whereupon Bly proceeded to explain. It was rather a vague explanation and
  it left Stella more puzzled than she had been when Bly had finished his
  story.</p>

  <p>"But I can't make head or tail of it, my dear boy," she said.</p>

  <p>"Neither can I for the moment," Bly confessed. "But I shall before long. I
  am going to spend the whole evening working this matter out, and if I can't
  get to the bottom of it before to-morrow I shall go round to the British
  Museum and consult one of their experts there. There are people yonder who
  make a business of solving cryptograms and those sort of things, and I know
  that they are frequently consulted by the police. Perhaps when we meet here
  to-morrow evening I shall be able to tell you something really worth knowing.
  Meanwhile we must wait."</p>

  <p>It was after dinner that evening that Bly sat himself down in real earnest
  to tackle the strange jumble of words and figures that made up the cipher.
  First of all, he took the copy of 'The Times' that held the smaller
  puzzle&mdash;the one ending with a note of interrogation. Here, in all
  probability, was the first part of the contract asking a question, and in the
  copy of 'The Times' for the following Monday the response was given at some
  length, more than double the length of the first message. And the first
  message ran something like this:&mdash;</p>

  <p>PATIENCE. 5,7,10,10,10. Ace. ace, 10, 5,7,10, ace. WHITE RAT.</p>

  <p>There the first cipher ended.</p>

  <p>The second cipher was more complicated.</p>

  <p>Thus:</p>

  <p>WHITE RAT. (C) 2,10,10,8. 2,10. 2. King, Ace, Jack, Ace, 3. 3,ace,9,10,10.
  10,6,8,7,8. 7,King,8,10,3. 3,10,8,Ace,8,6. King,3. Jack.
  Ace,10,3,2,Ace,2,King. 10, Ace. PATIENCE.</p>

  <p>Just that, and nothing more. Over these figures and words pored Bly until
  gradually he began to grasp certain outstanding facts. He had the patience
  cards on the table before him in the same order as those lying in the flat so
  that there could be no possible mistake and, after trying all sorts of
  combinations he established at length the fact that clubs and spades
  represented the capital letters and that diamonds and hearts, in exact
  rotation, the small or lower case letters. And then it dawned upon him that
  the numerals so frequently used in the ciphers represented not so much
  figures as letters, and that the spaces in the ciphers were merely breaks
  between certain words. The mere fact that there was no such thing as the
  figure one in either cipher helped him presently to arrive at certain logical
  conclusions. He knew beyond the shadow of a doubt now that the first cipher
  which began with the word 'Patience' and ended with 'White Rat' had been Sir
  Hercules calling and that the response, beginning with 'White Rat' and ending
  with 'Patience,' was the echo to the call. And, this being taken as a basis,
  facilitated further progress.</p>

  <p>And now, with the information he had worked out, Bly began to piece the
  words together. It was a little past 12 o'clock when he wrote down the first
  cipher, translated into plain English. And this is what he saw before
  him:</p>

  <p>PATIENCE. When and where? WHITE RAT.</p>

  <p>A few minutes later and the cryptogram was plain for any man to see who
  was capable of reading at all.</p>

  <p>WHITE RAT. Meet me Monday after eight Hotel Legation. Carl Zambra.
  PATIENCE.</p>

  <p>Bly lit a cigarette and drew in a long whiff of smoke with a sigh of
  relief. He had something at last to go upon, something that he could follow
  up in the hope of something like a solution in the near future. Beyond the
  shadow of a doubt the first message had been inserted in 'The Times' by Sir
  Hercules, and the response in the next Monday's issue&mdash;that being the
  day of Sir Hercules death&mdash;the reply had come from the anonymous and
  mysterious Mr. X. who, apparently, was an individual whose real name was Carl
  Zambra. Though the name itself had been covered by the cipher, it had
  evidently been inserted so that the reader it was intended for, in other
  words, Sir Hercules, might not be led away on a false trail.</p>

  <p>And other things began to grow clear besides. This mysterious X or Zambra,
  whoever he was, was the go-between whom Sir Hercules had employed when he
  wanted to get rid of the spoil which he had looted from the Maggersfont Mine.
  No doubt they had been using the same sort of cipher ever since the
  conspiracy was first hatched. There did not seem to be much doubt, either,
  that Carl Zambra was a real name. It conveyed nothing to Bly, but he was not
  worrying about that for the moment. He was too happy in the knowledge of his
  new born information to the effect that Sir Hercules had gone out on that
  fatal Monday night to keep an assignation with one Carl Zambra at the Hotel
  Legation. And that, no doubt, was where he had passed the hour between eight
  and nine, after which he had returned home in more than his usual health and
  spirits. No doubt, he had done a successful stroke of business regarding the
  King Diamond with this man Zambra, and had come back to his flat feeling
  assured that his money troubles were permanently at an end. It was more than
  possible that he had parted with the King Diamond during the short time he
  was at the Hotel Legation, and that the same stone reposed, at the present
  moment, in the possession of Carl Zambra.</p>

  <p>And then in some amazing and inexplicable way had come the tragedy which
  had put an end to Sir Hercules' career. Bly did not doubt for a moment that
  Zambra had managed to murder his confederate and that, at the present moment,
  he was lying low somewhere in London, carrying a fortune about in his pocket
  until such time as he could dispose of it to the best advantage. Nor was it
  the kind of jewel that any man could sell in the open market without
  immediately attracting attention. In the end it would probably cross the
  water and be sold to some American multi-millionaire in circumstances that
  did not call for publicity. So there was the King Diamond somewhere in
  London, and likely to remain there perhaps for a month. So far, Bly had not
  been wasting his time, and he went to bed presently, happy in the knowledge
  that a potential fortune lay before him.</p>

  <p>He was down early, and after breakfast strolled round to the Hotel
  Legation. It was not one of those mammoth establishments but a comparatively
  small building, with rather a select clientele and a big lounge on the ground
  floor. Here Bly sat for some time as if awaiting the coming of a friend.
  Presently he accosted one of the waiters and entered into conversation with
  him. It was fortunate, perhaps, that the man in question sported the Mons
  ribbon on his waistcoat, and this gave Bly an opening. It was early yet, and
  very few customers about, so that the waiter was not busy. Very gradually,
  with what was more or less a service talk, Bly led up to what was at the back
  of his mind.</p>

  <p>"I am looking for a friend," he said. "I don't know whether he stays here
  or not, though I know he has been here more than once. Do you happen to know
  a Mr. Zambra?"</p>

  <p>The waiter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I don't," he said. "You see, so many business gentlemen make
  appointments in the lounge here that I don't remember half of them. What is
  your friend like, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Oh I don't think that will help," Bly said hastily. "I know he was here
  on Monday night between 8 and 9. Did you happen to be on duty then?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir, not exactly," the man responded "That is, it was my early night
  off, and, after changing downstairs, I left the hotel about ten minutes past
  8."</p>

  <p>"Were there many people in the lounge at the time?'</p>

  <p>"No, not many, sir. You see, most of our people were dining and very few
  had finished."</p>

  <p>"Then you didn't notice anybody coming in particularly."</p>

  <p>"I can't say I did, sir. Oh, no I am wrong. There was one gentleman. Tall
  and very thin with a straggling beard and the most wonderful set of teeth I
  ever see in a man of his age. In a way he looked like a boy, and another
  minute like a very old gentleman. But carried himself like an athlete he
  did."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed?" Bly said with assumed carelessness, though his breath came a
  little more quickly. "I suppose you didn't happen to know who the visitor
  was?"</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I did, sir. He was that poor gentleman who
  committed suicide, or who was murdered in the flat in Devonshire Mansions.
  Perhaps you knew him, sir?"</p>

  <p>Bly was so taken aback that he could hardly reply for a moment.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, I did," he managed to say in a voice that he hoped
  did not betray his agitation. "You mean Sir Hercules Slaney. How did you come
  to know him?"</p>

  <p>"'I didn't know him, sir," the waiter replied. "I recognised him in a
  photograph that appeared in the 'Daily Photo' not very long ago. You couldn't
  forget him once you had seen those peculiar features of his. He passed me as
  close as you are to me now sir, but I didn't see any more of him because, as
  I just told you, it was my night off and I was in a hurry to get away."</p>

  <p>Evidently there was no more to be gleaned, at least not for the moment so
  that Bly strolled off casually presently and made his way as far as
  Bishopsgate-street. Sir Samuel was not particularly busy and was ready to see
  him at once.</p>

  <p>"Well," the latter said. "Any news?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite a lot," Bly smiled. "I don't propose to tell you everything I
  have discovered, Sir Samuel, but if Sir Hercules was murdered, I have learnt
  the name of the man who committed the crime. I think that is worth
  knowing."</p>

  <p>"God bless my soul!" Sir Samuel cried. "Do you mean to say you have found
  that out already? Have you been near Scotland Yard, because it seems to me
  that they ought to know. However, that is your business. What is the fellow's
  name?"</p>

  <p>At that moment a clerk came into the room with a visiting card in his
  hand. He held this towards his employer.</p>

  <p>"Who is it, Watkins?" Sir Samuel asked.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman to see you at once, sir," the clerk replied. "His name is Mr.
  Carl Zambra."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch9">CHAPTER IX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"NEVER heard of the man," Sir Samuel said curtly.</p>

  <p>Bly stood there absolutely amazed. The startling coincidence between his
  recent discoveries and the sudden appearance of the man whom he wanted to see
  above all others had absolutely deprived him of the power of speech. It was
  time to act and act quickly. Behind the clerk's back, he made signs to Sir
  Samuel which the latter interpreted correctly.</p>

  <p>"What's his business?" the big man went on. "Why does he come here like
  this without an appointment?"</p>

  <p>"He's apologised for that, sir," the clerk said. "But he hopes you will
  see him for a few moments, as his business is vital. At least, that is what
  he told me."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Sir Samuel replied. "Show him in here in just five minutes.
  That is all, Watkins."</p>

  <p>The clerk vanished and Sir Samuel turned on Bly.</p>

  <p>"Now then, young fellow," he said. "What's all this about? Why those
  pantomimic gestures? Do you know anything about this fellow? Don't you want
  me to see him?"</p>

  <p>"More than I want anything at the present moment," Bly smiled. "I will
  explain in due course. What I want to do, if you will give me the opportunity
  is to hear what this man has to say without being seen by him. Is there
  anywhere where I can hide and listen and watch at the same time?"</p>

  <p>"Well, there you are," Sir Samuel said, indicating a folding screen lying
  against a wall. "Just rig that up, I use it in the cold weather to keep the
  draught out. If you hide behind that you can both see and hear. But what
  manner of man is this that you are so interested in?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," Bly explained. "Because I have never seen him. But he is a
  scoundrel anyway."</p>

  <p>It might have been as Bly said, but the man who presented himself
  presently certainly gave no outward indication of rascality. On the contrary
  he was a fair little man, with a hesitating manner and the faint suspicion of
  a lisp. His boyish features and the monocle in his right eye suggested the
  stage more than anything else, and Bly, regarding him through a crack in the
  screen, was frankly astonished.</p>

  <p>"Well, what can I do for you, Mr. Zambra?" Sir Samuel opened the
  interview. "I am very busy this morning, and I shall be obliged if you will
  cut the conversation as short as possible."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Zambra said in his high pitched voice. "I won't
  detain you more than a minute. The fact is, I am just back from South Africa
  and only landed from the Union Castle liner Dover Castle last night. I have
  come to you without wasting any time. I wanted to speak to you in connection
  with the trouble you have had lately with your Maggersfont mine workers."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," Sir Samuel said guardedly. "And what do you know about that?
  Are you acquainted with Maggersfont?"</p>

  <p>"I may say without boasting that I know the whole of South Africa like an
  open book," Zambra replied. "I have lived there for years, in fact, I was one
  of the English Secret Service representatives during the Great War and spent
  half my time with the British forces in German East Africa. The other half I
  was across the border with the enemy. But that was an exciting chapter of my
  life which I need not go into now. I am not at liberty to tell you where I
  derived my information from, but I know that you have been robbed for months
  past by a cunning native who calls himself M'Papo."</p>

  <p>"But M'Papo is dead," Sir Samuel exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," Zambra said casually. "But he is not the only one. There
  are others."</p>

  <p>Sir Samuel frowned thoughtfully. He was wondering what this man was after
  and how it was he had come to make such an extraordinary slip. For if he had
  only landed the night before from South Africa, how could he possibly have
  known of that queer tragedy in the Ravenswood copse which had taken place
  during the time time Zambra was on the high seas? Sir Samuel allowed this to
  pass and it was obvious to him that Zambra had not noticed how damaging a
  step he had taken.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know all about M'Papo," Sir Samuel suggested</p>

  <p>"Oh, dear, yes. And his methods, too. He was not a badly educated man, and
  businesslike beyond most of his tribe. He must have been quite well off,
  which would be natural considering that he was robbing you in connection with
  a man you would never have suspected. But you will never guess who that
  is."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think so," Sir Samuel smiled. "You are talking about Sir Hercules
  Slaney. It is very good of you to come here and bring me all this
  information, but you have been anticipated."</p>

  <p>Zambra looked disconcerted for a moment, then his natural buoyancy
  reasserted itself.</p>

  <p>"Dear me, dear me," he said with a shake of his head. "You know, Sir
  Samuel, I hesitated a long time before I came here this morning. One doesn't
  make accusations against a man like Sir Hercules Slaney without very careful
  consideration. And you actually know all about it. That being so of course, I
  have no more to say and can only apologise for taking up your time."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know Sir Hercules is dead?" Oscar asked.</p>

  <p>Zambra threw up his hands in amazement.</p>

  <p>"You don't say?" he cried. "Dead? How is it I have never heard anything
  about this shocking event?"</p>

  <p>"I don't see you could," Sir Samuel said drily. "Especially as you say you
  have only just landed on the Dover Castle."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that would of course account for it," Zambra murmured. "Please tell
  me all about it&mdash;but no, I won't occupy your time. I can read it all for
  myself in the papers. It appears that mine has been a wasted errand, but I
  hope Sir Samuel, you will give me credit for the best intentions."</p>

  <p>Whereupon, after the exchange of a few further compliments, Zambra
  vanished down the office stairs and Bly came out into the room from his place
  of concealment.</p>

  <p>"Well, were you satisfied?" Sir Samuel asked.</p>

  <p>"Not altogether," Bly admitted. "I am amazed at the audacity of that man
  daring to turn up and, so to speak, beard the lion in his den in such an
  insolent fashion. Oh, he looks mild and innocent enough, but that man must
  possess courage in the highest degree, and, if I am any judge of physique,
  there is plenty of virility under a soft exterior. And now I am going to
  astonish you, Sir Samuel. The meek and mild individual you have been talking
  to was the man who killed Sir Hercules Slaney."</p>

  <p>Sir Samuel gazed in open-mouthed astonishment.</p>

  <p>"You can absolutely prove that?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>"No I can't," Bly confessed. "I have a long way to go and the police have
  a long way to go before we can fit the crime on that scoundrel, but, all the
  same, I am absolutely convinced that I have made no mistake. We have an
  exceedingly cunning and daring criminal to deal with, but even these are
  guilty of a little slip sometimes. Did you notice one he made just now?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Sir Samuel smiled. "It ran off his tongue before he was aware
  of it, in fact. I don't think he was aware of it at all. And, of course, I
  did not remind him. He said he knew that M'Papo was dead, but if he was
  telling the truth about the Dover Castle I should like to know how he knew
  that."</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Bly agreed. "I know for a fact that Zambra was in London the
  night that Sir Hercules died. I don't want to bother you with my proofs now,
  but they will be all ready when the time comes."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think we had better nail that lie down to the counter at once,"
  Sir Samuel said.</p>

  <p>With that, he rang his bell, and the clerk appeared.</p>

  <p>"I want you to go round as far as the offices of the Union Castle
  Company," Oscar said. "I think you will find that the Dover Castle was
  berthed yesterday. Ask the manager to give you a copy of the
  passengers&mdash;I mean their names. Tell him you come from me, and give him
  my compliments. No, we need not go as far as that. Ask to search the files,
  and see if you can find the name of Carl Zambra amongst them. Now, go at
  once, and be back as soon as possible."</p>

  <p>Twenty minutes later the clerk returned with information to the effect
  that the ship's register contained no such name.</p>

  <p>"All right, Watkins, you can go," Sir Samuel said, with a wave of his
  hand. Then he turned to Bly.</p>

  <p>"Well, there you are," he went on. "I think that dates our friend Zambra.
  But, tell me, why are you so particularly interested in that elusive man's
  movements?"</p>

  <p>"Well, because I am quite certain he killed my late employer and, also, I
  have a shrewd notion that the King Diamond is at present in his possession.
  That is only a theory, of course, but I shall be greatly mistaken if it does
  not turn out to be correct. I think that Sir Hercules had that stone in his
  possession on the Monday night when he left his flat. He went out at 8
  o'clock to keep an appointment at the Hotel Legation and returned to
  Devonshire Mansions somewhere about 9. When he went out, he had the King
  Diamond in his possession and when he came back it had been transferred to
  the individual you were just talking to. I shouldn't wonder if he had it in
  his pocket all the time you were chatting together."</p>

  <p>"But you can't prove this," Sir Samuel challenged.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," Bly agreed. "But I hope to. I am saying nothing till I have got
  my facts in absolute array. Meanwhile, I am going to see a man who will tell
  me all about Zambra and his activities during the war."</p>

  <p>"Do you really suppose he was there?" Sir Samuel asked. "Might not that
  statement have been mere camouflage?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Bly said thoughtfully. "But I shall know all about
  that before I sleep to-night."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch10">CHAPTER X</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HALF an hour later, Bly turned in to a general sports
emporium in
  Windover-street. Over the door in neat letters was printed the name of one
  Martin Cotswold, and in the big cavernous shop that individual himself was
  attending to an aristocratic customer. For Cotswold was a mighty hunter
  himself and had killed big game all over the world, indeed, there was hardly
  a pastime in the realm of sport in which he did not shine as an expert.</p>

  <p>He had started his business in Windover-street soon after the war and,
  with a reputation, like his, speedily built up a prosperous and
  wide-spreading business. He was a man not particularly conspicuous looking,
  spare and clean-shaven, and slightly grey about the temples. A man who would
  not be noticed in a crowd, which fact Cotswold had frequently discovered to
  be an asset, because, during the Great War, he had been engaged in the
  Intelligence Department of his Majesty's Forces operating against the enemy
  in German East Africa.</p>

  <p>It was he who had discovered the mysterious source through which the
  German forces were drawing their supplies, particularly in the way of
  ammunition and mountain batteries. His record in the War Office stood high,
  though he was utterly unknown to the public and desired to remain so. Had he
  chosen to place his experiences on paper Cotswold could have written a book
  that was bound to cause widespread sensation.</p>

  <p>But Martin Cotswold was not that sort of man. He was quite content, now
  that the war was over, to work for a modest competence and enjoy the
  confidence of his host of friends. He finished with his customer presently,
  and turned to Bly.</p>

  <p>"Hello," he said. "Where have you been all this long time? I haven't seen
  you for a couple of years. Still at the old game, eh? Oh, I forgot, you were
  with that queer old bird Slaney, weren't you? Chap who committed suicide the
  other day."</p>

  <p>"More or less correct," Bly smiled. "I was with Slaney and now I am
  generally at a loose end. Fact is, old chap, I have got a job as a private
  inquiry agent."</p>

  <p>"Very appropriate," Cotswold smiled. "You always had a bent that way. Do
  you remember a certain occasion down yonder when we crossed the enemy's lines
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind that for the present," Bly said a little impatiently. "I
  am going to tell you a big story later on, but that story isn't complete, and
  I don't think it ever will be until I enlist your aid. Fact is, I want to
  know if you can tell me anything of a man called Carl Zambra."</p>

  <p>Cotswold sprang to almost rigid attention.</p>

  <p>"Carl Zambra," he cried. "Lord bless the man, I should think I could. Come
  along into my office. Mr. Barton, will you attend to anybody who comes in and
  say I am busy for half an hour."</p>

  <p>The military-looking assistant gave the desired assurance, and together
  the two friends entered the office. It was a spacious room in which Cotswold
  evidently passed a good deal of his time, for, in the jargon of the
  auctioneer, it was replete with every comfort. The door was closed, silver
  cigarette-box produced, together with a spirit stand and a syphon of
  soda.</p>

  <p>"Now then, take a pew and help yourself," Cotswold directed. "Light up and
  tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>As far as he could and without betraying confidence. Bly told his old
  friend all that he ought to know. He dwelt particularly upon the recent
  interview between Zambra and Sir Samuel and the little slips the former had
  made.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," Cotswold said thoughtfully. "Those chaps often do give
  themselves away in little things. At any rate, it is quite clear from what
  you tell me that Zambra has been in England for some days. In that case, what
  had he to gain by lying to Sir Samuel? What's that? Yes, I'm sorry; you
  didn't come here to answer questions, but to ask them. You want to know what
  I have to say about Zambra and his past. Well, to begin with, he is a dead
  wrong 'un. As clever as a monkey and as relentless as a tiger. Any amount of
  real courage and audacity, and afraid of nothing that walks on two legs, or
  four for the matter of that. Been living on his wits all his life. I don't
  know what nationality he is, but he calls himself a Swede. I shouldn't wonder
  if that is true, probably the only true thing about him. But, undoubtedly, he
  belongs to a more than respectable family, and is extremely well educated. He
  speaks four or five languages fluently. The sort of chap who, if he had gone
  straight, might have attained almost any position. But then that type of man
  never does go straight, and always comes to grief in the end. You will have
  to be very careful. It you push him into a tight place he won't hesitate to
  murder you. And he will do it with a smile on his lips, and with no malice in
  his heart. You think he murdered Sir Hercules Slaney and I should think it is
  exceedingly likely that you are right. The question is, why?"</p>

  <p>Bly knew why, but he refrained from saying. He had taken Cotswold into his
  confidence up to a certain point, but, so far, he had said nothing with
  regard to the King Diamond.</p>

  <p>"There might have been a dozen reasons," he said cautiously. "I have
  already told you that those two were in partnership over the diamond
  robberies, and there might have been an extra valuable parcel of stones,
  quite big enough in value to induce Zambra to play false with his
  accomplice."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I should think that is exceedingly probable," Cotswold agreed. "I
  should say you are right, Bly, that that parcel changed hands in the lounge
  of the Hotel Legation. But here am I, wandering from the point again. You
  came here to find out all I knew about Zambra. Well, he was a spy and I found
  out that he was what you might call a double spy. Professing to be a zealous
  friend of England's and telling the Germans the same thing as far as they
  were concerned. That chap was too cosmopolitan to care for either country. He
  was only intent upon feathering his own nest, which he must have done pretty
  effectually. Still he had his uses; there was no end to his audacious courage
  and he was a consummate actor to boot. He was on the stage for a good many
  years, where, I believe, he would have done well if he could only settle down
  to anything. Of course, after I found out what he was doing, I took precious
  good care that he learnt nothing authentic on our side, and, when he did
  cross no-man's land on his visit to the German lines, he was always carefully
  oiled up with a lot of stuff that was calculated to do the enemy more harm
  than good. And I must say he did bring us some fine information from time to
  time. All the same, we knew that he was utterly unreliable and we should
  probably have shot him in the end, only he vanished one fine day and never
  returned. Now you see he has bobbed up in connection with a mysterious
  crime."</p>

  <p>"Most assuredly he has," Bly said.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is just what I should have expected of him. I can give you his
  history, chapter and verse, if you want it. But there is one thing you have
  to be careful about. If you want my assistance in this matter, you must keep
  me out of Zambra's way. If he sees us together he will be certain to smell a
  rat. Give me a day or two to jot a few notes down and I will show you the
  stuff that Carl Zambra is made of. And now, fill up your glass and let us
  talk about other things. How have you been getting on all this long time? Do
  you ever go near the old place? Do you ever see a certain young lady
  now?"</p>

  <p>Bly laughed a little uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose you mean Stella Ravenhill," he said. "As a matter of fact,
  she is Sir Samuel Oscar's private secretary. Funny how all these things come
  together, isn't it? Who would have thought, ten years ago, when the three of
  us were at Ravenswood together, that we should come to meet like this."</p>

  <p>"Ah, who indeed," Cotswold echoed. "I see the old attraction still
  remains. Anyway, I am glad to hear that my old friend Stella is doing quite
  well, in spite of the family misfortunes. I always knew there was the right
  stuff in that kid&mdash;I beg your pardon, old chap, but she was a kid in
  those days compared with us. I should like to see her again. She must have
  grown into a most beautiful and attractive woman."</p>

  <p>"She has," Bly said a little curtly. "And I am quite sure she would be
  just as pleased to see you."</p>

  <p>"Then we will meet," Cotswold declared emphatically. "Do you happen to be
  doing anything to-morrow night?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing out of the ordinary," Bly admitted.</p>

  <p>"Well, why not come and dine with me at a little place in Regent-street
  that I know of. We can get the best of everything there, and they always keep
  a snug little table for me in an alcove at the back of the restaurant. I
  shall be highly honoured if Miss Ravenhill would join us at eight o'clock. If
  you happen to see her in the meantime you might convey my humble compliments,
  and ask her to grace the board with her presence."</p>

  <p>"I will," Bly said emphatically. "We generally go somewhere together for
  tea, and I will ask her this afternoon. It will be quite a nice little change
  for her."</p>

  <p>As Bly anticipated, Stella was quite agreeable to fall in with the
  suggested arrangement. She had no other engagement; in fact, her evening
  engagements were few and far between.</p>

  <p>"That is very kind of Martin," she said. "I suppose I can call him Martin,
  considering that I used to do so years ago. I shall be only too
  delighted."</p>

  <p>"Good," Bly cried. "I will come and pick you up."</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the sort," Stella laughed. "Your idea of picking
  me up is a taxi both ways, and there is no occasion whatever for it in this
  warm weather. Besides, I couldn't encourage you in such extravagance. I can
  find my way to Regent-street without a convoy. You seem to forget that I am a
  working girl, getting her own living."</p>

  <p>"I wish I could," Bly sighed. "I wish I could take you out of it
  altogether. Perhaps I shall some of these days."</p>

  <p>"Not through the medium of King Diamonds," Stella laughed. "Don't you
  begin counting on that. Remember your Dickens. Remember what happened to Dick
  Jarndyce."</p>

  <p>It was just before 8 o'clock when Stella came into the restaurant and
  joined the two men, who were awaiting her in a secluded little alcove behind
  a big palm at the far end of the spacious rooms. It was more or less crowded
  with diners, for the place was becoming known to those learned in such
  matters, so that it was almost uncomfortably full. Stella moved up the
  gangway in that smooth, unconscious way of hers, quite oblivious of the
  sensation she was causing, and took her seat smilingly with her back to the
  room.</p>

  <p>"Well here I am, Martin," she said. "And only too glad to meet you again.
  It is almost like old times&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Cotswold was paying no attention. He laid a hand on Bly's knee and
  indicated two people who were just coming in through the swinging doors.
  Noting the gesture, Stella half turned as Cotswold spoke once more.</p>

  <p>"Look who it is," he whispered. "Carl Zambra."</p>

  <p>"So that is Zambra," Stella said. "Who is she?"</p>

  <p>"Don't you know her?" Cotswold asked. "That is the famous, or rather
  infamous, film star who calls herself Cleopatra. I doubt if she ever had
  another name, which is just as well."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch11">CHAPTER XI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FROM where she was seated, Stella could command a good view
of the woman
  who bulked so largely in the columns of the popular Press, especially those
  portions devoted to the stage and the cinema. She saw a personage of
  remarkable charm and attraction, a small, perfectly formed blonde with the
  rare combination of fair hair and almost black eyes. Not too young, and yet
  giving the impression of being hardly in the full bloom of her exotic
  loveliness. The mouth was small, perhaps a little too small, and not in the
  least sensual. At the same time the corners of it were hard and resolute, and
  in the brown-black eyes a keenness that spoke of a worldly knowledge beyond
  the common. But a very beautiful woman and one who, when she smiled, caused
  the onlooker to lose his sense of proportion and forget any critical faculty
  that be might happen to possess.</p>

  <p>"She is very lovely," Stella murmured.</p>

  <p>"Oh, she is," Cotswold said. He had rapidly changed places with Bly so
  that he could be seated in such a position that his face was turned away from
  the new-comers. "It would never do for those two to see me sitting with you,
  Lionel."</p>

  <p>"By Jove, I had almost forgotten that," Bly said. "I suppose we shall have
  to stay here now till they go."</p>

  <p>"I am not worrying about that particularly," Cotswold replied. "They will
  clear out long before we have finished our dinner. You see, Cleopatra is one
  of the restless lot, and never stays anywhere very long. I suppose that is
  what you call temperament."</p>

  <p>"It is a wonderful face," Stella murmured. "I don't wonder at the
  sensation she is creating. Do you happen to know who she is, Martin? Where
  does she come from?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I can tell you all about that," Cotswold volunteered. "I had it from
  Carlton, of the Frivolity Theatre. You wouldn't think, to look at her, that
  she came from the dregs of the population. And yet she did. Her father was a
  Spaniard, who dealt in the prosaic onion, and her mother was born in a
  circus. She lived in Pennyfields until she was twelve. Just a lovely flower
  on a refuse heap. A beautiful butterfly, bred of garbage and filth. Her
  earlier years are more or less wrapped in mystery, but when she was fifteen
  she managed to get in the chorus of a travelling theatrical company, after
  which she disappeared till three years ago, when she seems to have taken
  Hollywood by storm. If she hadn't quarrelled with all the managers there she
  would have made a fortune. Mind you, she is a woman who takes very good care
  of herself, very little of the night club and cocktail business for
  Cleopatra. They say she has no brains whatever, and I know from my own
  experience that she can't act for nuts. But that does not prevent her from
  getting engagements with big money. At the present moment she is rehearsing
  for a sketch at the Colidrome. You know the sort of thing. Written mainly to
  show off her charms and display of personal beauty, in addition to that, she
  is acting with a film company in a play which is a jumble of 'She' and 'King
  Solomon's Mines.' But a dangerous woman in spite of her brainlessness."</p>

  <p>"I should like to know what she is doing with Zambra," Bly murmured. "I
  should have thought she would be playing for higher game than that. Certainly
  he has no money."</p>

  <p>"No, I suppose not, from what you say," Cotswold smiled. "Still, he is a
  useful sort of chap."</p>

  <p>Bly said nothing for the moment. In the back of his brain an idea had
  crept, one of those little flashes of inspiration that often lead to great
  results. From where he was seated, he had a perfect view of the newcomers,
  who had now taken their seats and were settling down to their meal. He could
  see that the woman was sublimely indifferent to the man and that he, on the
  other hand, was absolutely infatuated. The fact was plain for the whole room
  to see.</p>

  <p>So Bly wondered. Here was a creature who lived for the moment and,
  moreover, lived entirely for herself and what the world in any shape or form
  could give her. She made no attempt to hide the patent truth that her dinner
  companion interested her not in the slightest degree. And yet, here she was
  with him when half the young men in London of birth and family would have
  given their heads to be seen in public entertaining so fascinating a
  personality as Cleopatra. Why then, was she wasting her time in this
  comparatively secluded little restaurant whilst she might have been queening
  it at the Ritz or Carlton?</p>

  <p>Bly answered his own question almost before he had asked it. Cleopatra
  knew all about the King Diamond. Yes, that would account for her presence
  here to-night. At any rate, it was a theory worth following up, and it might,
  eventually, lead to great results. And if Cleopatra really was aware of the
  existence of the King Diamond and where it lay at the present moment, then
  she would never rest until she had it in her possession.</p>

  <p>Bly sat there playing with his food abstractedly whilst Stella and
  Cotswold chatted gaily. Then there came another idea which he could discuss
  openly with Cotswold.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said "I have something in the way of a brain-wave. It only
  came to me just now as I was watching those two. You will remember my telling
  you about the waiter at the Hotel Legation and how he recognised my late
  employer from a photograph in the 'Daily Photo.'"</p>

  <p>"I have not forgotten that," Cotswold said.</p>

  <p>"Well that photograph was very useful. It established the fact that Sir
  Hercules was in the Hotel Legation lounge between eight and nine o'clock on
  the night of his death. But so far, I am quite at a loss to prove whom he
  went to see. Of course, I really do know, but I can't be definite enough,
  that is, definite enough for a court of justice."</p>

  <p>"But you know that he went to see Zambra."</p>

  <p>"Yes, of course I do. But that is not good enough for a Judge and jury.
  Not even if I produce my code when the time comes shall I be able to place my
  finger unerringly upon the right man."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I quite see that," Cotswold agreed. "Still, you have got an
  idea. What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, a photograph of Zambra. My waiter man who told me all about Sir
  Hercules would not be in a position to identify Zambra, but, no doubt, the
  other waiters on duty would. Now, old chap, you might exercise an ingenious
  brain. How am I going to obtain the photograph that I so urgently
  require?"</p>

  <p>"Easiest thing in the world," Cotswold said coolly. "Do you see that
  rather dandified-looking man over there with the long nose and the eyeglass?
  If you will step over to him and say that Martin Cotswold wants to speak to
  him he will come at once. And he is the man we want."</p>

  <p>"Who is he?" Stella asked eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, he is Jimmy Clissold, of the 'Daily Picture
  Maker.' A freelance journalist who is responsible for the personal column of
  that lively journal. The man who writes those little paragraphs beginning 'as
  I was lunching yesterday with the Duchess of Dulwich'&mdash;you know."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Stella gurgled. "And ends up by saying 'she was, of course, a
  Plantagenet.'"</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Cotswold smiled. "And you must not forget the 'of course,'
  because it makes the paragraph so intimate. Well, Jimmy is the man for us. I
  bet you he is wondering now who it is that Cleopatra has got hold of."</p>

  <p>Cotswold was unerringly correct in his forecast. For directly the
  beautifully turned out young man with the eyeglass presented himself at the
  table in the alcove and bowed profoundly over Stella's hand, he asked
  Cotswold at once who the fellow was who was dining with the famous
  Cleopatra.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is exactly why I sent for you," Cotswold explained. "I felt
  pretty sure you didn't know the man. And knowing your natural appetite for
  the personal, I thought I would do you a good turn by giving you the
  information."</p>

  <p>"That is awfully good of you," Clissold drawled. "I am not generally at
  fault, but I can't place that chap anyhow. Fact is, I have never been here
  before, and I shouldn't be here now if I hadn't followed Cleopatra in. Seems
  a nice little place and perhaps worth writing up. However, for the moment I
  am not concerned with that. Who is the man with Cleopatra?"</p>

  <p>"Fellow of the name of Zambra," Cotswold explained. "Carl Zambra&mdash;a
  famous traveller and explorer. Played rather an important part with the
  British forces in German East Africa during the war. Bit of a mystery man,
  too. Just the type to write an interesting paragraph about. They tell me that
  he and Cleopatra have a secret understanding."</p>

  <p>Clissold fairly beamed through his eyeglass.</p>

  <p>"Ah, another romance," he cried. "Stage romance. You know the hoary old
  headings we always put under photographs of celebrities who are about to
  commit matrimony."</p>

  <p>"But you haven't got a photograph," Cotswold pointed out.</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is an easy matter. I will make a note of it, and get one of our
  chaps to follow Zambra and take a snap of him. If he can get the two
  together, so much the better."</p>

  <p>"Here, stop," Cotswold protested. "None of that, my boy. I don't want to
  get myself into trouble. I am only telling you what rumour says and I
  strongly object to having my name dragged into it. You be content, for the
  moment, at any rate, by getting the photograph of Zambra. You know how to
  work it better than I do. 'The latest picture of Carl Zambra, the famous
  explorer and scout, whose name rumour has connected with that of a famous
  film actress, whose pseudonym suggests the serpent of old Nile.' All that
  sort of thing. But you know more about it than I do."</p>

  <p>Clissold strolled away a few minutes later with a murmured word or two of
  thanks for the information.</p>

  <p>"Well, I think I put him all right," Cotswold smiled. "Our literary
  Autolycus will not let the grass grow under his feet. You will see a
  photograph of Zambra in his paper before the week is out. Then you can go to
  the Hotel Legation with it and get your waiter man to find out if his
  colleagues have ever seen the original before. And, unless you have very bad
  luck indeed, you ought to be able to establish the fact that Sir Hercules and
  Zambra met in the lounge of the hotel on the night of the former's death. And
  that ought to help you a whole lot."</p>

  <p>"It might," Bly admitted to himself. "And yet, on the other hand, it might
  not."</p>

  <p>It would certainly be of considerable importance to the police, but, just
  then, he was not particularly concerned with the authorities at Scotland
  Yard. Sooner or later, he would have to put his cards upon the table and,
  indeed, he had every intention of doing so, but not until he had exhausted
  all his efforts in connection with the discovery of the missing diamond. The
  very last thing he wanted was for the police to get hold of that stone and
  thus deprive him of the splendid reward which Sir Samuel Oscar had promised
  for its recovery.</p>

  <p>"I am certainly very much obliged to you," Bly said. "And you are making
  my task a good deal easier. By Jove, you are right, Martin. Those people are
  moving."</p>

  <p>As Bly spoke, Zambra and his companion rose and faded out of the
  restaurant. Cleopatra led the way, Zambra following her as if he had been no
  more than her little dog.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch12">CHAPTER XII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FOR the next week or two, Bly was destined to see the name
of Cleopatra
  looming very largely in the popular Press. Her name was everywhere, she was
  seen here and there, always magnificently dressed and always in the forefront
  of the picture. She was going to appear at the Colidrome in a sketch
  specially written for her by a famous dramatist and supported by a company of
  actors and actresses who had been tempted to so far efface themselves by the
  big fee they were obtaining for appearing on the same stage with one who was
  at once the most beautiful woman and the worst actress in the world. She was
  going to make a tremendous sensation presently in a new British romantic film
  which was going to cost at the very least &pound;100,000. Indeed, it seemed,
  for the moment, as if Cleopatra had eclipsed the rest of creation.</p>

  <p>All of which Bly read with a quiet smile on his face. It had been a week
  or two before he had seen the picture he was waiting for in the popular
  pictorial which Clissold represented, but on the seventeenth day it appeared
  with an appropriate outline underneath, and, so far as Bly could judge, was
  an exceedingly fine likeness of that rascally adventurer.</p>

  <p>Then, one evening a day or two later, he went as far us the Hotel Legation
  with the photograph in his pocket. In the lounge he was fortunate enough to
  find his particular waiter on duty. He seated himself and signalled the man
  to approach. He came up smiling and stood waiting for orders.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, sir," he said. "Is there anything I can do for you?
  Anything I can get, sir?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, presently," Bly said. "Meanwhile, you can put this pound note in your
  pocket and keep your mouth shut. If you are discreet, there will be other
  Fishers to follow."</p>

  <p>"Oh, thank you, sir, I am much obliged, sir," the waiter said gratefully.
  "I am sure anything in the world, sir&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, of course," Bly interrupted impatiently. "Now, look at this. It
  is a photograph, as you see. Tell me, have you ever met the man whose
  features are delineated there?"</p>

  <p>The waiter glanced long and earnestly at the cutting and then, with
  obvious regret, shook his head with the asseveration that he had never seen
  the gentleman before.</p>

  <p>"Oh well, I was quite ready to hear you say that," Bly replied. "There are
  reasons why you shouldn't. But I do know that the man I am looking for, in
  other words, this man, was here one night nearly a month ago. In fact, the
  very night that you were off duty. I think Monday is your night off, isn't
  it?"</p>

  <p>"That is right, sir," the waiter replied. "I am always away on Monday
  night at a few minutes past eight."</p>

  <p>"And somebody else takes your place, of course. Now, where can I find the
  waiter who comes on duty here on Monday night, and looks after the lounge
  when you are relaxing?"</p>

  <p>"You mean Walter, sir," the waiter suggested. "He is somewhere on the
  premises now. Would you like me to fetch him, sir? I think he is having his
  supper. You have just come at the right time, sir, because he will be going
  in about another quarter of an hour. I will fetch him now, sir."</p>

  <p>"No, you need not do that. Tell him to wait outside for me. And inform him
  that there is a tip waiting for him whether he can help me or not."</p>

  <p>A few minutes later and Bly and the man Walter were seated in a little
  house of call at the corner of the street. Bly lost no time in taking the
  photograph from his pocket and handing it to his companion, together with a
  couple of half-crowns.</p>

  <p>"I want you to have a good look at that," he said. "And when you have done
  so, I shall be very much obliged if you can tell me whether you have ever
  seen the gentleman before. Take your time over it. If you are the good waiter
  I take you to be, you have a memory for faces. You may have seen that man
  only once, and, on the other hand, you may never have seen him at all. But I
  rather think you have."</p>

  <p>Quite anxiously, with an outward air of carelessness, Bly watched the
  waiter's face. He saw the puzzled astonishment on it, and then, after a
  longish interval, the light of intelligence beginning to dawn in the man's
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have seen him before," he said. "But I can't think where and when.
  You see, sir, we have so many men of that class coming in and out of the
  hotel, society people looking for friends and all that sort of thing. But,
  somehow or another, that face is mixed up in my mind with trouble. Some sort
  of bother. I shall remember presently.... Yes, I've got it. The night that
  our Italian cook went off the deep end, if you don't mind my using the word,
  sir, and tried to stab one of the waitresses. Been carrying on with him, she
  had. Matters of jealousy. I was down in the kitchen and saw it all. It was
  just before I came on duty. About eight o'clock it would be."</p>

  <p>"Do you come on duty at eight o'clock every night?" Bly asked.</p>

  <p>"No, sir, I don't," the latter responded. "It is only on Mondays that I
  take the other man's place in the lounge."</p>

  <p>"Then it must have been a Monday night," Bly suggested.</p>

  <p>"Of course it was, sir. Three weeks last Monday as ever was."</p>

  <p>"You are absolutely sure of that?"</p>

  <p>The waiter had no sort of doubt with regard to the date or the hour. It
  could easily be proved he said, because the cook had been before the
  magistrates and a reference to any file of newspapers would show the day on
  which he had stood in the dock and had been remanded for three weeks in
  custody.</p>

  <p>"So far, so good," Bly smiled. "Then you are perfectly certain you saw the
  gentleman whose photograph you have in your hand in the lounge of the hotel
  between eight and nine o'clock on the evening of Monday three weeks."</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest doubt about it, sir," the man said with confidence. "It
  was a very quiet night for us and I don't suppose I served more than half a
  dozen customers altogether. I know I am right about the gentleman, because of
  the way in which he played with his eyeglass and then again by his squeaky
  voice. Of course, I don't mean, sir, as there is any squeaky voice in the
  photograph, but it is those little things taken together that impress
  themselves on one's mind. And then when sometimes the police come asking
  questions it pays a waiter to have a good memory, if you take my meaning,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I quite understand," Bly smiled. "Now, do you happen to remember who
  the gentleman was with?"</p>

  <p>"Only one other gentleman," the waiter said. "I have never seen him before
  or since. He was an old man with a straggly beard, and an enormous big, bald
  head. I noticed him because he had such clear blue eyes for an old gentleman,
  and a wonderful set of teeth that I could see wasn't false. I served them
  with a couple of whiskies-and-sodas each and then, about nine, the old
  gentleman went away and him with eyeglass stayed about another ten minutes,
  and then he goes too and I never set eyes on them from that day to this."</p>

  <p>To all of which Bly listened with rapt attention. He had no further
  questions to ask, because he was already satisfied that there was nothing
  further to learn, so he drifted off presently more than satisfied with the
  interview.</p>

  <p>He was not going to say anything of this to Sir Samuel Oscar for the
  present, but when he met Stella on the following evening for an early dinner
  in a little restaurant, he told her all that he had discovered, at the same
  time laying stress upon its grave importance. And Stella was not slow to see
  the risk he was taking in keeping this back from the police.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know that," Bly admitted. "But I don't want to do that till the
  very last moment. I have been most confoundedly lucky, so far, and I am
  inclined to back that luck. It may lead us right to the King Diamond. If it
  doesn't, then I must in common honesty consult the Yard."</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps you are right," Stella admitted. "We can do no more for the
  moment. And now do you remember what you promised me for this evening?"</p>

  <p>"Of course, I do," Bly said promptly. "I promised to get tickets for the
  new performance at the Colidrome for this evening, and here they are in my
  pocket. All the same, I don't know why you particularly wanted to see
  Cleopatra showing the nobility and gentry of the British Isles how not to
  act. But so long as I am with you, my dear, I am happy anywhere."</p>

  <p>With which sincere compliment, Bly paid his bill and the two left the
  restaurant on their way to the Colidrome. They were just a little late in
  taking their seats, by which time the great building was crammed to its
  utmost capacity.</p>

  <p>"What an audience," Stella whispered. "I should think half the rank and
  fashion of London is here. And yet if it were anything worth seeing the
  stalls would be empty."</p>

  <p>Before Bly could reply, there came a loud burst of applause as Cleopatra
  flashed on the stage in all her dazzling beauty. Stella gasped with amazement
  and admiration as she sat half dazzled by the costume that Cleopatra was
  wearing.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful, wonderful," she murmured. "And those jewels. Did you ever see
  anything like them?"</p>

  <p>"Paste," Bly said cynically "Paste."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort, my dear boy," Stella replied. "I have seen too many
  jewels in my time to be deceived. And just look at that single stone
  suspended round her neck on a platinum chain. Oh, it must be the finest in
  the world."</p>

  <p>Bly half started from his seat and then dropped back again breathing
  heavily between tightly pressed lips. He had seen something that had escaped
  Stella's attention.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest doubt of it," he whispered. "My dear Stella, that stone
  is the King Diamond."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">FROM a literary or artistic point of view, the
entertainment provided for
  the patrons of the Colidrome was absolutely negligible. It was a poor story,
  without wit or point, and intended obviously merely to show off the amazing
  charms of the leading actress. With this the audience were fain to be
  content, and, indeed, they had come for no other purpose. They saw one of the
  most beautiful women in the world attired in various achievements of the
  modiste's art, more especially a daring creation in vivid red, which brought
  rounds of applause from the shallow-pated spectators.</p>

  <p>It was shortly after ten o'clock when Cleopatra literally fought her way
  through a double row of open-mouthed admirers and climbed into a car, which
  was, in itself, an advertisement. The chauffeur wheeled round in front of the
  great building itself and there picked up Zambra, who was waiting patiently
  on the pavement for the heroine of the evening.</p>

  <p>"Where away now?" he said, as he closed the door behind him. "Which
  particular restaurant is it to be?"</p>

  <p>"None at all," Cleopatra responded. "I don't feel in the mood to-night. I
  am tired, and the last week has tried me to the limit. I am going home, my
  boy."</p>

  <p>"But you promised," Zambra protested.</p>

  <p>"My dear man, did you ever know me to keep a promise when I didn't want
  to? I must live up to my reputation. I am going home. And you can come with
  me if you like. Just a quiet little supper and then to bed, because I am dog
  tired. I have not been so tired since the old days when I was the drab and
  drudge in a travelling circus."</p>

  <p>Zambra's solemn mood changed to one of frank and almost boyish delight.
  This woman could play upon his feelings as a maestro plays on a favourite
  instrument. It was her mood to tease and torment him and then chase away his
  dark moments as if he had been a child offered a piece of chocolate.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said. "You can come with me, because I have something to talk
  to you about. I will give you a much better supper than you could get in any
  restaurant and a bottle of champagne that came from Baron Steiner's own
  cellar. There! What do you think of that as a present for a good boy?"</p>

  <p>The luxurious car stopped at length before a small house in Green-street,
  and in a room garishly ornate, despite the treasures it contained, Zambra sat
  down presently to a meal that left him in the best of spirits and good
  humour. It was only when he was sipping his coffee and smoking a cigarette
  that he began to lead up to what he had to say.</p>

  <p>"Well, it was a great evening, wasn't it?" he began.</p>

  <p>"Was it?" Cleopatra asked indifferently. "Oh, I don't know. It was a
  rotten show, any way, but I suppose it served its purpose. But go on. What is
  still troubling you?"</p>

  <p>With a gesture Zambra indicated the great diamond that still blazed on
  Cleopatra's throat. The thin platinum chain was almost invisible in the
  shaded light, so that the gem might actually have grown on the soft velvety
  flesh.</p>

  <p>"That is it," he said. "Now, look here. I was a great fool ever to tell
  you anything about that stone, and, whilst we are about it, you might just as
  well tell me how you came to know that I had anything of the kind."</p>

  <p>"Ah, now you are asking questions," Cleopatra laughed. "My dear boy, I
  also have my secret service department, just the same as you had years ago in
  Africa. There is precious little goes on in the underworld to which you
  undoubtedly belong which I don't hear of sooner or later."</p>

  <p>"Then you refuse to tell me?" Zambra asked.</p>

  <p>"I refuse to tell you," Cleopatra echoed with one of her most dazzling
  smiles. "Why should I? Besides, in a sort of a way you told me yourself. For
  the best part of three months you have been hinting at a mysterious fortune
  which you more or less carried about in your pocket. You talked about King
  Solomon's Mines and the jewels of Asia and all sorts of sentimental nonsense.
  And then, though I have no doubt you have forgotten, you began to speak of a
  wonderful diamond&mdash;the King Diamond, in fact."</p>

  <p>Zambra moved about uneasily in his chair.</p>

  <p>"I will swear I never mentioned the word King Diamond," he said. "I
  remember telling you that I was interested in South African mines, but the
  big word was never even suggested. Who was it who told you that the King
  Diamond existed?"</p>

  <p>But Cleopatra smilingly declined to say.</p>

  <p>"Oh, what does it matter?" she asked. "I suppose you have forgotten that
  in my circus days I travelled all over the world. I suppose I was about 15 or
  16 when we were in South Africa. And I heard all sorts of strange things
  there. And then, when you showed me that uncut stone a mouth or two ago I
  guessed what it was. And I persuaded you to have it cut. And you did. And
  then, I couldn't rest till I had worn it in public. And I never shall rest
  until it belongs to me."</p>

  <p>Zambra smiled broadly at the ingenuous suggestion.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I thought that was what you were driving at," he said. "I suppose
  you brought me round here to-night to try and induce me to part with a
  fortune like that. My dear child, be reasonable. I have been knocking about
  the world for the last fifteen years in a more or less unsuccessful attempt
  to obtain money and now, at last, I have that which represents a handsome
  fortune. I suppose that bit of flashing glass at your throat means in hard
  cash something like &pound;200,000. Enough to make me a rich man for life.
  And you can share that money if you like. But not in England, my child, not
  in England. Somewhere abroad if you like, say South America. I am getting
  tired of knocking about the world, and with you at my side&mdash;"</p>

  <p>It was Cleopatra's turn to smile.</p>

  <p>"And give up the life I am leading," she cried. "Never! My dear boy, to me
  publicity is the very breath of life. I worship the glitter and the colour
  and the adulation more than I value my beauty itself. But I must have that
  stone. You will have to give it to me, Carl."</p>

  <p>"And the conditions?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know what you are driving at. You want me to marry you. And yet you
  don't even give me your confidence. You would never have produced the King
  Diamond or allowed me to wear it unless as a bribe to become your wife. I
  don't want to marry anybody. I am not that sort of woman."</p>

  <p>"I am quite aware of it," Zambra said savagely. "You never had a particle
  of heart. You never cared for anybody but yourself, and you never will."</p>

  <p>"That is perfectly true," Cleopatra said coolly. "But whose fault is that.
  I should like to know? Not your's or Tom's or Dick's or Harry's, but your sex
  as a whole. I never had a home or even a kind word until I was big enough to
  fight for my own hand, and contact with the world told me that there was only
  one thing worth fighting for. That is money. I want all I can get and I shall
  never have enough if I live to be a hundred."</p>

  <p>"But you must marry sometime," Zambra urged.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose I shall. But I am in no hurry and I can pick and choose
  where I like. But don't let's quarrel, Carl. If you won't give me the
  diamond, at any rate you might let me have the use of it for a few
  weeks."</p>

  <p>Even knowing the danger that he was deliberately playing for, Zambra
  hesitated. He had been almost criminally weak over the matter of the great
  stone and, indeed, as he sat there weighing up the chances, he was wondering
  why he had been mad enough to take Cleopatra more or less into his
  confidence. He did not even know the extent of his infatuation for her. The
  woman blinded and dazzled him, she could twist him round her little finger
  and make him forget everything in the world so long as they were together,
  and yet that cold, worldly eye of his was open widely enough to her hard and
  mercenary nature. It was one of those wild infatuations that have often
  proved destructive to much greater men that Zambra, as the history of nations
  proves.</p>

  <p>He rose almost passionately to his feet. His entire expression had changed
  so that he was no longer a mild-looking cherub surveying a complacent world
  through his eyeglass, but a man whose face was deeply lined with wrinkles and
  in whose blazing eyes was an expression of mingled hatred and fear.</p>

  <p>"Come, let us have no more nonsense," he said. "Give me that stone, I say.
  You have done mischief enough."</p>

  <p>Cleopatra shook herself free from his grasp and dropped languidly into a
  chair. Whatever her faults might be, she did not lack the element of personal
  courage.</p>

  <p>"We don't want any melodrama," she said lightly. "Still, if you will have
  it, let me ask you a question. How did you manage to put Sir Hercules Slaney
  out of the way?"</p>

  <p>Zambra seemed to freeze where he stood. Just for an instant the colour
  faded from his face and on it instead was a ghastly shade of ashen grey. And
  even then he did not lose the self-possession that was his greatest
  asset.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow you," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I think you do," Cleopatra said in a low voice. "I read all about it
  in the papers. It was wonderfully well done, and reflects the greatest credit
  on you. You have the police guessing and everybody wondering whether that
  queer old gentleman was murdered or committed suicide. Personally, I have my
  own opinion. I dare say you may ask what all this has to do with the question
  at issue, but you are not so blind as not to understand that I hold a card or
  two in the game."</p>

  <p>"Card," Carl Zambra stammered. "What card?"</p>

  <p>"Well, that is a figure of speech, isn't it? Now, look here, Carl, I am
  not going to marry you, and you are not going to take away that stone
  to-night as you anticipate. Oh, you need not be afraid I shall pawn it or
  give it away or anything of that sort, because I dote on jewellery, and,
  besides, I have all the money that I need for some time to come. But you are
  going to leave the King Diamond with me for the present at any rate."</p>

  <p>It seemed for the moment as if Zambra would break out again, then his
  manner changed as swiftly back to the normal and he laughed as he helped
  himself to a fresh cigarette.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose you must have your own way," he said. "But everybody is
  not as fortunately disposed as you are with regard to money. Personally, I am
  getting towards the end of my tether. I shall want a big sum before long and
  I was going to get it by the sale of that diamond in the States. You can have
  it for a week or two, but when I ask you again&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He broke off and paused significantly. He did not look in the least like a
  man who was disturbed and shaken to the depths by the touch of melodrama
  which Cleopatra had added to the conversation. He would have done anything in
  reason to call this wonderful woman his own, and as she smiled up into his
  eyes he could feel all those mad emotions at work within him.</p>

  <p>But he was not altogether devoid of prudence or caution. It would never
  do, he thought, to quarrel with Cleopatra at this juncture. Nor did he want
  to have any misunderstanding with her. That would be far too dangerous. In
  the back of his mind the savage was uppermost, and he would have given a
  great deal for the necessary primitiveness to take this woman by the throat
  and drag that blazing stone from the velvet of her skin. No, he must proceed
  in a much more diplomatic fashion than that.</p>

  <p>"We won't dispute that," Cleopatra cried, triumphantly. "And now, my dear
  boy, you won't be very much annoyed if I ask you to go, will you? You can let
  yourself out&mdash;the servants must have gone to bed long ago."</p>

  <p>Quite coolly, Zambia slipped into his overcoat and bent over the hand
  which Cleopatra held out to him. Then he slipped from the room and closed the
  door behind him.</p>

  <p>He was in danger, a danger that he had brought upon himself by his madness
  and infatuation for a woman who would not have lifted the little finger to
  save him. And the danger was no less stark because he had brought it upon
  himself. Every time Cleopatra appeared in public with that blazing gem about
  her throat was a moment fraught with dire peril for the man who had
  deliberately placed this weapon in her hands. He must get that stone back by
  any means short of murder.</p>

  <p>But how? And then he saw the way.</p>

  <p>It was hanging on a nail right in front of him in the shape of a latchkey.
  Not one latchkey but three, which he knew gave entrance to the flat. He
  glanced cautiously over his shoulder and slipped one of those into his
  pocket, knowing that it would not be missed. Then he made his way into the
  street.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch14">CHAPTER XIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">ZAMBRA made his way thoughtfully along the streets until he
came, at
  length, to a small house in a thoroughfare that led out of Grosvenor Place.
  Here he rang the bell and presently a footman in a sombre livery opened the
  door and admitted him. He hung up his hat and coat in a tastefully furnished
  hall and then, with the air of a man who is thoroughly at home, walked up the
  broad, thickly carpeted stone stairs into a big room at the back where a
  score or two of men and women were seated at a number of bridge tables. They
  were well-known society people for the most part, some of whom were
  personally known to Zambra, so that his entrance excited no comment.</p>

  <p>There was an air of quiet serenity and refinement about the whole room
  which would have struck a stranger as appropriate directly he entered. No
  suggestion whatever of a gambling-den, because it lacked all the appliances
  that usually go with that type of establishment. Nothing but seven or eight
  small, green-baize tables at which a number of society people were passing
  the evening over a quiet rubber of bridge. There was not even so much as a
  coin to be seen anywhere.</p>

  <p>And yet those people were gambling and that in downright earnest. In other
  words, they were playing for five-pound points, which meant that the loss or
  winning of a rubber averaging three hundred points represented the gain, or
  otherwise, of something like &pound;1500. In other words, it was a
  respectable bridge club, and, as such, outside the reach of the law. For
  bridge is essentially a game of skill and in case of a raid or other trouble
  of that kind, there was nothing outwardly to prove how heavy the gambling
  was. Nothing beyond the intense silence that prevailed and the pallor on the
  faces of the players.</p>

  <p>Over this establishment there presided one Colonel Mint, late of his
  Majesty's Indian Army, an astute, hawk-like individual, who provided the
  necessary accommodation and appliances at the moderate charge of one percent,
  on the amount of business done during a sitting. A modest enough sum
  outwardly, but one that represented in the Colonel's case a steady income
  that ran into thousands a year. Moreover, the Colonel was a man well known
  and actually respected in social circles and was welcome everywhere. It was
  felt that in a fashion he was catering for a longfelt want. He was no player
  himself, being content to move softly from table to table, ministering to the
  needs of his friends and seeing that they were provided with necessary
  refreshment which was generously found by the management himself.</p>

  <p>The Colonel, a dapper little man with a heavy cavalry moustache and a most
  pleasant and agreeable manner, moved across to Zambra directly the latter
  entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Ah, here you are, Zambra," he said genially. "Just in time. Where have
  you been lately? If you will wait a minute or two you can cut in at the table
  at the corner. Sir John is going after this rubber and there is nobody to
  take his place. In the meantime, can I get you anything?"</p>

  <p>"Not at present, thanks," Zambra said "I have turned up this evening to
  see if I can't get a bit of my own back."</p>

  <p>With that, he moved across to a table in the far corner of the room from
  which a tall man with a strikingly handsome face had just risen more or less
  reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"Well, I must be going," he said. "What do you want, Gregory? Seven-fifty,
  is it? And you, Lady Joan. Oh, the same, eh? I will just write out a cheque,
  then I must be going."</p>

  <p>The speaker filled up two slips from his cheque book at a little
  writing-table, and, as he vanished from the room, Zambra slipped into his
  vacant place. He found himself cutting with a well-known man about town who
  was reputed to be the owner of immense wealth, and then they sat down to play
  in earnest.</p>

  <p>But it was not what Zambra would have called his night out. From the very
  first the cards seemed to run against himself and his partner. Even when they
  held good hands that imp of the perverse that makes bridge so maddening and
  fascinating a game scorned to enjoy bringing about a series of complications
  that defeated calls most of which were more than promising.</p>

  <p>The game went on for an hour or two with quick rubbers for the most part
  and a constant change of partners. But whoever Zambra cut with, the result
  was invariably the same. For a long time he played coolly and carefully
  enough, but as luck rolled up more and more swiftly against him, he grew a
  little wild, until a rash call of three no trumps which was doubled brought
  about a result of five hundred down, which, multiplied by five, meant that
  that one call alone had left him the poorer by &pound;2500.</p>

  <p>"Bad luck," murmured one of his opponents, a youth in the Guards who was
  enjoying the freedom that followed long minority, and was spending his money
  with a rashness that was causing his friends considerable anxiety. "Bad luck,
  old man. Now who would have expected that you would find the queen on your
  left hand? In ninety-nine times out of a hundred that finesse would have come
  off. If it had, you would have made your contract and two tricks over."</p>

  <p>"All in the run of the game," Zambra said cavalierly. "Come on, let us
  have one more. Things can't be any worse than they are now. Give me a chance
  to get a bit of it back."</p>

  <p>And this rubber was not so bad. But it did not bring Zambra the change he
  had hoped for, and at the end of the game, which was played in two hands, he
  looked up with a forced smile and proclaimed the fact that on the evening he
  was nearly five thousand pounds down. He took his cheque-book from his pocket
  and was about to rise when somebody who had just come into the room crossed
  over and laid a hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"That is not your game, Zambra," the stranger murmured. "Far better for
  you if you would stick to poker."</p>

  <p>Zambra never moved, nor did his flesh quiver under the pressure of the
  stranger's hand on his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that you Hawker?" he asked. "I don't even want to turn and look at
  you. I should know that voice anywhere. Where have you been all this long
  time? If you will wait a minute or two while I discharge by liabilities to
  these amiable robbers we will have a chat over old times."</p>

  <p>With that, Zambra sauntered across to the writing-table, and with an
  indifferent countenance and his heart aflame with rage and malice and
  something approaching murder, filled up the cheques in a neat, firm
  handwriting, and handed them over to the fortunate winners. After that he
  left the room with the man he called Hawker sauntering casually behind. Once
  they were out in the street, Zambra's manner underwent a change.</p>

  <p>"Now then, what is it?" he asked. "I don't know how you managed to get
  into the house just now, but you always had the cheek of the devil, and I
  suppose that pulled you through. How did you know I was there, and what do
  you want?"</p>

  <p>"Does it matter?" the man called Hawker asked, his rather saturnine
  features twisted in an ugly smile. "I have been looking for you for some
  time, and I only got on your trail by accident. Hit you pretty hard to-night,
  didn't they?"</p>

  <p>"You may say that," Zambra snarled. "When those cheques are met I shan't
  have a fiver in the bank. And, what is more, I don't know where to turn for
  the next. I suppose you couldn't, eh? You know what I mean."</p>

  <p>"Well, as a matter of fact, I could," Hawker said suavely. "But at a
  price, my boy, at a price. I have had quite a good time out yonder, and I
  don't think I should have come back from Capetown quite so hurriedly if I
  hadn't anticipated trouble with those C.I.D. people out there. Of course,
  they have been after me for years, but they haven't got Jim Hawker yet. I
  shan't go out again until the trouble has blown over, and in the meantime I
  have not done too badly. Question is, how much do you want? Five thousand do?
  Yes, you can have that, but on terms. And I ain't going to trust you a yard
  further than you would trust me. Come, is it a deal?"</p>

  <p>"On what sort of security?" Zambra asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, you have only got one, as far as I know," Hawker smiled in his
  sinister way. "And if I had had the luck I expected the senility would have
  been mine and not yours."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Zambra burst out.</p>

  <p>"What do I mean? The King Diamond, of course."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch15">CHAPTER XV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THOUGH Bly had no reason to be disappointed with his rate
of progress with
  regard to the search for the King Diamond there were one or two points that
  troubled him sorely. He had located the Great Stone or thought he had, and
  his knowledge of human nature told him that it would be a long time before
  Cleopatra consented to part with the treasure, the value of which she no
  doubt appreciated to the last farthing. It was good at any rate to know where
  the King Diamond was to be found, but to obtain possession of it without
  exposure or scandal was going to prove something in the way of a problem.</p>

  <p>For this was no melodramatic business, no dark affair of the cloak and
  dagger or the more modern application of the tenets of the sensational school
  of fiction, but one unquestionably calling for finesse and diplomacy in the
  highest degree. And yet at the same time it was just possible that the big
  stone that Cleopatra had been wearing on the night of her first appearance at
  the Colidrome was not the King Diamond at all. But so far Bly failed to see
  that it could be anything else. Surely there was not a brilliant like that
  outside a State museum or the Crown jewels of some reigning monarch. And,
  strange to say, the class of journal that chronicled Cleopatra's movements so
  carefully had made no mention of the great diamond she was wearing on the
  first night of her appearance at the Colidrome. So far, that was all to the
  good. As long as that particular gem was not discussed Bly was not disposed
  to worry.</p>

  <p>Still there was the matter of Scotland Yard. It was all very well for him
  to go to work with the prospect of an immense reward in front of him, to
  devote himself to the recovery of the King Diamond to the exclusion of
  everything else, but, on the other hand, he was keeping back certain material
  facts from the authorities and holding them up in their search for the man
  responsible for Sir Hercules Slaney's death. After thinking the matter over
  for a day or two he resolved to take Sir Samuel Oscar into his confidence and
  invite his advice. So he called upon the big man and told him everything.</p>

  <p>"What do you think I had better do, Sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, upon my word, I hardly know what to say," Sir Samuel replied, "It
  is a remarkable story you have told me, and I am inclined to think that you
  are right in your supposition that this woman Cleopatra is at present in
  possession of the King Diamond. But how are you going to prove it?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, there, for the moment, I am utterly at sea," Bly said. "But I think
  you will agree with me that Cleopatra got that stone from Carl Zambra. I
  cannot see how else it would come into her possession. And yet you would
  hardly believe that a clever man could be such an utter fool."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," Sir Samuel smiled. "There is no knowing what a man
  will do when he becomes completely infatuated with a beautiful woman. Look at
  Marc Antony and Julius Caesar, for instance. Mixed up with another Cleopatra,
  by the way. And then there was Ninon de L'Enclos and Madame Pompadour, both
  of whom could do anything they pleased with the cleverest men in France. I
  don't suppose that Zambra is any wiser than some of these historic
  characters. I think you will find, later on, that Cleopatra wormed the story
  out of Zambra and that she persuaded him to have the stone cut, and borrowed
  it for that State occasion at the Colidrome. I don't suppose for a moment
  that Zambra gave it to her, but if I know anything of that class of woman, it
  will be a long time before he gets it back."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I quite appreciate that, sir," Bly said. "But the point is, shall I
  go to Scotland Yard and tell them all I know, or shall I go on for the
  present as I am doing?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I think, on the whole, I should wait a day or two," Sir Samuel
  advised. "If there is any trouble, you can tell the Scotland Yard people that
  you have confided in me, and that ought to help you. You don't want it to
  appear that you are deliberately holding back information."</p>

  <p>With which Bly went away a little easier in his mind. But he did not fail
  to tell Stella all that he had found out a day or two later when they met as
  usual in the evening with a view to one of those intimate little dinners of
  theirs.</p>

  <p>"Where are we going to-night?" Stella asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, I thought of going as far as the Hotel Legation," Bly said. "It is
  a quiet place, and we can talk freely there. Besides, I want to have a word
  or two with that waiter friend of mine. You know the man I mean, the man to
  whom I gave that picture of Zambra taken from one of the illustrated papers.
  It is just possible that the man who takes the waiter's place on the Monday
  night might have seen Zambra again and found out some more about him. At any
  rate, we must not leave any stone unturned."</p>

  <p>"But you don't suppose that Zambra would be so foolish as to go to the
  Legation again, do you?" Stella asked. "I should think that that would be the
  last thing in the world he would do."</p>

  <p>"So should I," Bly said. "But then you can never tell. There might be some
  urgent reason for his doing so. Or, on the other hand, he may be so
  absolutely sure of his ground that he can afford to take all sorts of risks.
  You see, he had probably made that assignation on the fatal Monday night,
  using the Hotel Legation for the first time in his life. Naturally, he would
  not be known there, and he was only on the premises about an hour altogether.
  After the interview was over, Sir Hercules went away and died. The odds are a
  million to one against anyone knowing anything about that meeting."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right," Stella said thoughtfully. "Do you think that
  Zambra knew that Sir Hercules was going to die that night? Do you think it is
  possible&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know what to think," Bly said a little petulantly. "All I
  know, and that is merely conjecture, is that Sir Hercules was lured into the
  Hotel Legation for some definite purpose. And a very sinister purpose at
  that."</p>

  <p>"But the two men parted," Stella pointed out. "And Sir Hercules walked
  home. He was all right when he entered his flat, because we have the evidence
  of the hall porter to that effect. I was wondering if Zambra had managed to
  administer some sort of subtle poison to Sir Hercules."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know what is in your mind," Bly said. "You are thinking of what
  happened to M'Papo at Ravenswood. There is little doubt how that unfortunate
  native came by his end, and also little doubt in my mind that Sir Hercules
  deliberately got M'Papo out of the way. The man in all probability was
  threatening him and demanding money under the menace of exposing the whole
  disgraceful story of the Maggersfont Diamond robberies. But then, you see, we
  happen to know that Sir Hercules died from an overdose of arsenic. I don't
  quite see how you are going to connect Zambra with that significant
  fact."</p>

  <p>Stella abandoned her line of argument.</p>

  <p>"It is all extraordinarily mysterious," she said. "And I am beginning to
  believe that nobody will ever know the exact circumstances in which Sir
  Hercules died. Hadn't we better leave all that to the police and concentrate
  our energies on getting the diamond back? I shouldn't mind stealing it. I
  mean, it doesn't belong to Zambra and still less to that dreadful Cleopatra
  woman, so that I should have no scruple."</p>

  <p>Stella spoke excitedly and her eyes sparkled as she thought of the
  possibilities that lay before her and the man who was walking by her side.
  She was still thinking of this when they turned into the hotel and took their
  seats in the restaurant, which was fairly well filled when they got there.
  Stella sat down with the same thoughtful frown on her forehead and the same
  grim determination in the lines of her mouth.</p>

  <p>"Still harping on the same subject," Bly asked with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, yes, I am. I think it is a great shame that those two awful
  creatures should get away with the King Diamond. And they will get away with
  it if you don't do something before long."</p>

  <p>"But what can we do?" Bly asked.</p>

  <p>Stella shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," she said. "Something desperate, I suppose. Now, I have
  been discussing this matter with Sir Samuel and he doesn't mind what I do. He
  has even offered to give me all the time off that I require. I was just
  wondering if I could not manage to meet this woman Cleopatra and gain her
  confidence. That sort of people are always changing their servants and if she
  happened to want a maid&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Melodrama," Bly interrupted. "Sheer melodrama, my dear,"</p>

  <p>"Oh, nonsense. There is nothing melodramatic about it. The same scheme has
  been adopted over and over again by the police. How often do they contrive to
  get one of their lady detectives into a suspect house? Of course, I am only
  throwing this out as a tentative suggestion."</p>

  <p>Though Bly smiled at Stella's notion, he was not altogether disposed to
  brush it lightly aside. He knew perfectly well that anything in the way of
  violence was out of the question, and that if the King Diamond was to be
  recovered it must he achieved through some clever ruse on his part and not by
  anything in the nature of sheer brutal force. Nor would he have had the
  slightest hesitation in taking advantage of any accident or stroke of luck
  that brought the King Diamond within his reach. There was no shadow of doubt,
  of course, that the stone had come from the Maggersfont Mine, and that it was
  in very truth the property of Sir Samuel Oscar. At least, it was the property
  of the Maggersfont Diamond Corporation, in which Sir Samuel held the bulk of
  the shares.</p>

  <p>He was turning the problem over more or less incoherently in his mind when
  his thoughts were switched into a different direction altogether by the sight
  of two men, who, at that moment, came side by side past the table where he
  was sitting and made their way up to the top of the room, where they took
  their places in a window a little apart from the rest of the diners. Stella
  did not fail to see that Bly was a little moved.</p>

  <p>"What has happened?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, nothing," Bly said. "Except that that man who has just come in is
  Carl Zambra."</p>

  <p>"Why, so it is," Stella cried. "Do you happen to know who the other man
  is? Evidently a foreigner by the look of him, and certainly of Jewish
  extraction."</p>

  <p>"No, I never saw him before," Bly said. "But that is Zambra all right. I
  wonder What he is doing here?"</p>

  <p>"Sheer audacity," Stella suggested. "He must feel very sure of his ground,
  to come here like this. He evidently has not the lightest idea that he has
  been recognised as the man who was with Sir Hercules on the night of his
  death. I would give a great deal to know what those two are doing here."</p>

  <p>"Well, don't watch them quite so intently," Bly suggested. "I suppose you
  don't realise how you are staring at them."</p>

  <p>Stella averted her eyes immediately.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry," she said. "It is very stupid of me. But isn't it a most
  extraordinary thing that they should come here when there are fifty other
  places they could go to? Won't it be as well if you follow them presently.
  Oh, Lionel, I would give half I possess to hear what they are talking
  about."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch16">CHAPTER XVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THE two men at the top of the room had their heads close
together and
  appeared to be deeply engrossed in some absorbing topic that rendered them
  oblivious to what was going on around. Then the man with the sinister smile
  and the slightly hooked, Semitic nose, turned to Zambra with a smile on his
  face.</p>

  <p>"Now," he said. "Tell me all about it. We could not go into the matter the
  other night when I followed you into that swell gambling-joint of yours. And
  anyhow, I have been too busy since to follow up the business of the King
  Diamond. Now, where is that little bit of glass at the present moment?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, we will come to that presently," Zambra said evasively. "The point
  is, are you prepared to find that money?"</p>

  <p>"What money?" the man called Hawker asked.</p>

  <p>"Just as if you don't know. They cleared me out the other night and I
  hardly know where to turn for a sovereign. I have had the most frightful run
  of luck the last week or two and there is big money waiting for me over in
  the States if I can only put my hand on the necessary expenses. I must have
  at least five thousand of the best, and you are the man to find it."</p>

  <p>"Oh, am I indeed?" Hawker sneered. "You talk as if five thousand were so
  many pence. I am always ready to join in a flutter if the game is worth the
  candle, and if you can justify what you are asking for, why the cash is here
  right now. But where do I come in, dear boy, where do I come in?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I will give you your share," Zambra muttered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, but what share? You and I have been in some big things together and
  we have run some big risks. But that don't mean that we go about with our
  arms round one another's necks like two brothers who have been nicely brought
  up and who know nothing of the wickedness of the cruel world. We just trust
  one another as far as we are obliged to and no further."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, if you put it like that&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My soul of honour, there is no other way of putting it," Hawker said
  cynically. "You have had the good luck over that diamond and I have had the
  bad. Don't you forget that I was up to my neck in that I.D.B. business before
  you ever thought of it. And I was working certain natives on the outskirts of
  the Maggersfont Mine long before you and Slaney got hold of that unfortunate
  man M'Papo and robbed Sir Samuel Oscar of thousands. I know that the King
  Diamond was found over a year ago. I know how and where M'Papo put his hand
  on it and how it was hidden in the mine all those months before it was
  considered safe to smuggle it out of the compound. And, eventually, it was
  smuggled out, but it didn't fall into Sir Hercules's hand, because it was you
  who met M'Papo outside the compound and paid him a hundred and fifty pounds
  in Treasury notes as a first instalment of his share."</p>

  <p>Zambra looked just a little white and uneasy.</p>

  <p>"A wonderful chap, ain't you?" he scoffed.</p>

  <p>"Not half so wonderful as you think yourself," the other retorted. "My
  boy, you are a bit too clever and always were. It doesn't pay to be over
  clever, as you will find out one of these days. Anyway, you got off with the
  big stone and you came to England some months ago with it in your possession.
  And you never carried out your contract with M'Papo and left him in the
  lurch, thinking that he was just a poor nigger that you need not trouble any
  more about. And that is just where you made a mistake, my boy. Our friend
  M'Papo had a great deal more brain than you gave him credit for. He followed
  Sir Hercules to England and he died mysteriously. I read all about that in
  the papers, and that is what put me on the scent, because I don't mind
  admitting that I had lost sight of you altogether. But for that business at
  Ravenswood, I should probably never have found you again. But I did find you,
  and now that Sir Hercules is dead, I propose to divide the proceeds of that
  King Diamond with you on the terms of fifty fifty."</p>

  <p>"Oh, do you?" Zambra asked. "I like your nerve."</p>

  <p>"Well, so do I," Hawker showed his teeth in an ugly smile. "I don't know
  how you managed it and I don't care, but I do know this. I do know that you
  managed in some infernally clever way to get rid of Sir Hercules so that you
  could keep the proceeds of the King Diamond for yourself and retire to some
  foreign part, where you could set up as a big swell on the proceeds. Not that
  I care twopence what happened to Sir Hercules, but I do care what happens to
  the King Diamond, because we are partners in this business. Now, look here.
  You want a considerable sum of money pretty badly, and I am in a position to
  find it. You can't get the cash from anybody else, and you can't afford to
  wait. What are you going to do with that champion sparkler?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose that is my business," Zambra snapped.</p>

  <p>"Well, to a certain extent, yes, but it is also my business, as you will
  find to your cost if you play any tricks with me. My dear chap, I have got
  you in the hollow of my hand, and the sooner you acknowledge the fact and
  come to terms the better it will be for all parties concerned. After all, you
  wouldn't have had more than half the proceeds of the stone if Sir Hercules
  had not been&mdash;beg your pardon&mdash;had not died."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that?" Zambra demanded..</p>

  <p>"Oh, what is the use of carrying on in this way?" Hawker asked. "You won't
  gain anything by it. And what on earth possessed you to give, or lend, the
  King Diamond to Cleopatra? I don't suppose I should ever have known where it
  really was if I had not seen her wearing it the other night at the
  Colidrome."</p>

  <p>Zambra flushed a deep, sullen red.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," he said. "Why does a man do those idiotic things where
  a woman is concerned?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, ask me an easy one. You have been hanging about Cleopatra now for the
  last four years. You are absolutely mad about her, and she doesn't care a
  scrap for you and never will. She is one of those beautiful creatures without
  a particle of heart or feeling, born to batten upon men who walk into her net
  blindly, knowing that she will suck them dry without the least remorse. The
  sort of woman who ought to have been strangled at her birth."</p>

  <p>"I know all about that," Zambra confessed moodily. "But it has always been
  the same ever since I saw her three years ago at Capetown, riding round a
  circus ring on a piebald horse. I made that woman, Hawker, I rescued her from
  captivity. I introduced her to the film people in America and she has never
  looked back since. I am not myself when I am in her presence. She can twist
  me round her little finger as if I were made of wax. Dash it, I had that
  stone cut on purpose to oblige her, though I wanted to take it to the States
  because I know a multimillionaire over there who would have bought it without
  asking a single question. And then she wheedled it out of me a month ago to
  wear on the night of her first appearance at the Colidrome, and I let her
  have it like the weak fool I was, knowing the risk I was running."</p>

  <p>"And now she refuses to part with it," Hawker sneered.</p>

  <p>"Of course she does. I am to have it back next week or next year, or some
  time like that. And I haven't strength of mind enough to tear it from her
  neck and tell her to go to where she rightly belongs."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but there are other ways," Hawker pointed out.</p>

  <p>A queer smile crossed Zambra's face. He winked as he significantly tapped
  the breast pocket of his dinner jacket.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know that," he said. "Cleopatra is banking on the fact that I dare
  not make any fuss, and if I tried violence she would have called in the
  police and accused me of stealing my own property. You don't know the limits
  of that woman's audacity. At any rate, that is what she would have done, and
  she would have bluffed it through, too. So I just walked out of the flat and
  left her in possession of the stone. But not for long, my boy, not for long.
  There is another way."</p>

  <p>"Oho," Hawker laughed. "Then you have got it back? It is in your pocket at
  the present moment."</p>

  <p>Zambra winked once more broadly.</p>

  <p>"That is about the size of it, my dear boy," he said. "As I was leaving
  the flat, I noticed two or three latch keys hanging on the hook behind the
  front door, and I borrowed one. I knew it would never be missed. You know it
  is the custom to have two or three latchkeys to a flat, so I thought I might
  just as well have one, and I put it in my pocket. Then I waited my
  opportunity until late last night, when both Cleopatra and her maid were out,
  I made bold to enter the flat in search of the diamond."</p>

  <p>"And you found it? Then I suppose you were lucky enough to discover the
  key of that beautiful bloodsucker's safe?"</p>

  <p>"Safe," Zambra said contemptuously. "Do you suppose that sort of woman
  ever worries about safes? The diamond was lying open on her dressing table.
  She hadn't troubled to even put it in its case, to say nothing of her drawer.
  So I picked it up and put it in my pocket, and here it is now."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that certainly was a bit of all right," Hawker grinned. "Now we
  shan't be long. You hand that over to me and I will give you a cheque for
  what you want at once."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, you don't," Zambra said cunningly. "That diamond is going to be
  deposited in a bank, some branch of a foreign bank, in our joint names. You
  can look at the stone if you like."</p>

  <p>With that, he slid the little morocco case across the table, and Hawker
  furtively examined it by the aid of one of the shaded lamps on the table.
  Then the expression on his face changed entirely as he pitched the case back
  again.</p>

  <p>"What do you think you are playing at?" he demanded. "Playing on the
  finest judge of a diamond in London. Put that rubbish back in your pocket and
  be hanged to you."</p>

  <p>"Rubbish," Zambia echoed. "Rubbish!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly. Paste, and none too good at that."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch17">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"PASTE!" Zambra stammered. "Paste."</p>

  <p>Hawker smiled in a pitying sort of way that Zambra found infinitely more
  galling than any outburst of anger or contempt would have done. It was as if
  some mere boy had been trying to get the better of a man of the world.</p>

  <p>"I said it," Hawker went on. "What do you think you are playing at? Fancy
  trying to work such a dodge on an old hand like me. Here, take the thing
  away."</p>

  <p>"But it must be all right," Zambra breathed heavily.</p>

  <p>"All right; all right! The thing is Parisian paste. I will bet you a
  thousand pounds to a threepenny bit, which is pretty fair odds, that I am
  right. And you needn't take my word for it, either. Show that rotten sham to
  any diamond merchant in Hatton Garden and he will laugh at you."</p>

  <p>Zambra sat there absolutely incapable of collecting his thoughts. It was
  impossible to disbelieve what Hawker was saying, especially as the latter
  knew a diamond as well as he knew his own hand. And yet here, to all
  appearances, was the very gem he handed over to Cleopatra for her delectation
  and delight. It must have been about a month, he thought, since Cleopatra had
  finally wheedled the King Diamond out of his possession with a half promise
  that she would not display it in public. And, indeed, she had kept her word
  up to the night of her first appearance at the Colidrome. She ought, really,
  to have refrained from gratifying her lust for adulation and acclaim on that
  occasion, and no one was more perturbed than Zambra when, from his seat in
  the stalls, he had seen the great jewel flashing in the centre of that
  milk-white throat. He realised the danger of a proceeding like that, and he
  would have given a great deal to have recalled the folly and insane
  infatuation which had led up to a peril so deadly. Still, the mischief had
  been done, and Zambra had seen to it that it should not occur again. There
  was no great harm, so long as Cleopatra had the brilliant gem to play with
  and admire in the solitude of her dressing-room, but when she came to blazon
  it in public, that was a different matter altogether. She could have it to
  toy with and, as a matter of fact, she had had it to toy with for two or
  three weeks, though Zambra was in a cold sweat whenever he thought about it.
  In his cooler moments, he was almost amazed at his own stupendous folly in
  ever mentioning the King Diamond to Cleopatra, or, at any rate, in letting
  her know that the great stone had come into his possession. And when finally
  he had laid his hands on it again in the surreptitious manner which he had
  described to Hawker he was perfectly certain in his own mind that Cleopatra
  would never see it again. All this troubled him as he sat there, gazing open
  mouthed at Hawker, not knowing what to do next.</p>

  <p>"Well?" the famous diamond thief said presently. "Well? What are you going
  to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"What can I do about it?" Zambra asked miserably. "Somebody has played an
  infernally clever trick upon me, and I am not going to rest till I get to the
  bottom of it. I can only tell you this. The King Diamond was in my possession
  up to about a month ago. I brought it away from South Africa with me after it
  had been handed over by&mdash;well, you know who by, and subsequently I took
  it to Amsterdam and had it cut. After that, the stone was set in platinum and
  made in the form of a necklet with a thin chain. That was my folly, and I did
  it to please Cleopatra. Mind you, Sir Hercules knew all about it."</p>

  <p>"What, knew that you were going to lend it to Cleopatra? That be hanged
  for a tale. Who are you getting it?"</p>

  <p>"No, I don't mean quite that," Zambra explained. "I am so absolutely
  knocked out for the time that I hardly know what I am talking about. I mean
  that Sir Hercules knew I had the stone. He gave it me himself."</p>

  <p>"Yes, but that won't do," Hawker said, with a sinister smile. "You told me
  that M'Papo handed it over to you."</p>

  <p>"When?" Zambra asked. "Oh yes, I believe I did say something of the sort,
  but at that moment I was not prepared to trust you all that way,
  and&mdash;and there were other reasons."</p>

  <p>"Connected with Sir Hercules' death, I suppose," Hawker suggested
  meaningly. "Is that what you mean?"</p>

  <p>Zambra changed colour and just for an instant showed signs of confusion
  and distress.</p>

  <p>"You can please yourself as far as that goes," he said, a little
  defiantly. "But the honest truth is that Sir Hercules handed that stone over
  to me in Maggersfont because he knew that I could smuggle it into this
  country a great deal better than he could. And so I did. I showed it to
  him&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"On the night of his death, what?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind when," Zambra said, wriggling about uneasily. "I showed it
  to him not long before he died, if you want to know."</p>

  <p>"How long before he died?" Hawker demanded.</p>

  <p>"Well, say a month," Zambra lied fluently. "But what has all this got to
  do with it? The stone was trusted to me to treat as I chose. I was to have it
  cut instead of selling it in the rough, because we wanted to know its exact
  value. But all this is so much beating in the air. We had better meet again
  in a day or two and, meanwhile, I will try and find out how it is that I have
  been crossed in this way. And I suppose I must wait till then for my
  money."</p>

  <p>"You can gamble on that," Hawker said curtly.</p>

  <p>They parted a few minutes later, and Zambra went back thoughtfully to the
  obscure little hotel in the neighbourhood of the Strand where, for the
  moment, he had his pied-a-terre. And there he sat down to think matters
  over.</p>

  <p>With a cigarette between his lips he retraced the events of the past day
  or two. He saw himself once more with the latchkey of Cleopatra's flat in his
  pocket making his way through the quiet streets very late at night in the
  direction of the huge block of buildings where Cleopatra had established
  herself. For a woman of her position in the film and theatrical world it was
  not what might be called an ultra-fashionable neighbourhood, and the flat was
  by no means a large one. There were about a score of these altogether, and
  they were given over, for the most part, to people connected with the stage.
  This was rather a fortunate circumstance so far as Zambra's projected
  adventure was concerned, because it meant that people were going up and down
  the stairs half the night and, therefore, it was not likely that he would be
  noticed as he approached the door of the film star's flat.</p>

  <p>It was well after one in the morning when he swaggered into the hall with
  his hat on one side and his expanse of white shirt front prominently
  displayed, so that he made a passingly good figure of the man about town who
  was about to call upon some actress or actor at so late an hour&mdash;at
  least, it would have been a late hour in any other social circle&mdash;and
  Zambra was pleased that the hall porter didn't even favour him with a glance.
  He did not take the lift, but sauntered up the stone stairs until he came to
  the door of the flat. He had every reason to believe that neither Cleopatra
  nor her maid was at home, though that would have made little difference
  either way. In the presence of a noisy little group on the landing he coolly
  took the latchkey from his pocket and opened the front door, which he
  proceeded to close behind him very quietly, and then, taking a small torch
  from his pocket, he flashed a beam of light round the hallway.</p>

  <p>So far, so good. There was not a sound in the flat, and no sign of a light
  anywhere. Beyond doubt, Cleopatra had not yet returned. And if he were
  correct in this supposition, then it would be some time before she came back.
  No doubt she was supping with somebody or dancing at one of the numerous
  night clubs which she affected, from which she would probably emerge some
  time before daylight. And, knowing something of the domestic habits of the
  flat, the intruder felt assured that Cleopatra's maid would not be back much
  before her mistress.</p>

  <p>This meant, of course, that he had the flat to himself. And unless
  Cleopatra was wearing the King Diamond, which was exceedingly improbable,
  then it would be in his possession before many minutes had elapsed. Neither
  did he expect that he would be compelled to resort to the finer arts of
  burglary. So far as he knew, Cleopatra had no safe, and he had seen for
  himself how careless she was where her jewellery was concerned. He would
  probably find the object of his search either lying on the dressing-table or
  carelessly thrust into a drawer.</p>

  <p>Half an hour or more and the peril which he had deliberately hung round
  his neck would be finally lifted. And he would take precious good care that
  he never ran the same risk again. Cleopatra could do and say what she liked,
  but she had worn the King Diamond for the very last time.</p>

  <p>Zambra chuckled as he thought of it. He thought of his expedition to
  Amsterdam and that secret interview in a little back shop with a queer old
  Fagin-like gentleman, who had been growing rich for years past, cutting
  stones that had been brought to him under cover of the darkness from all
  parts of the world by all kinds and conditions of shady individuals. And he
  could see how the little man's eyes gleamed and sparkled when they first
  lighted on the King Diamond. But old Aaron van Light was wise in his day and
  generation and said nothing. It was not for him to ask questions or raise any
  sort of trouble which might bring him into dispute with his patrons, and thus
  interfere with the flow of his remunerative occupation. He had cut the stone
  in the course and handed it back to Zambra, with the comment that it was a
  wonderfully good stone, and that he should think that it was exceedingly
  valuable. And, after that, in the full flush of his infatuation, Zambra had
  spent quite a lot of money in having the diamond set according to Cleopatra's
  instructions.</p>

  <p>He put all that, however, out of his mind as he crept noiselessly into the
  woman's bedroom. All was dark there, though the blinds were not drawn, so
  that Zambra had to be exceedingly careful with his torch in case any flash of
  light should show in the streets outside. He could dimly make out the shade
  of the luxurious bed with its half-drawn silken curtains as he felt his way
  across to the dressing table, and allowed just one faint gleam to shine on
  its glittering contents.</p>

  <p>Ah, here it was, the very thing. Lying right in the middle of the table,
  just as if it had been no more than a glass bead belonging to some little
  factory girl. With a quicker beating of his heart, Zambra retraced his
  footsteps and emerged on to the empty landing. With characteristic cunning he
  placed the latchkey in the door and left it there, so as to convey the
  impression that someone with a duplicate key had entered from the outside.
  Then he vanished into the street.</p>

  <p>Almost immediately the bedroom was flooded with light, and Cleopatra stood
  in the centre of the room, clad in yellow satin pyjamas, and a smile on her
  face.</p>

  <p>"A wonderful man," she said to herself. "So very clever and yet so very
  simple. But then, they are all alike when they are in love. And I am very
  much afraid that Carl's passion for me has seriously affected his brilliant
  intellect."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch18">CHAPTER XVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">AS a matter of hard, prosaic fact, the woman known as
Cleopatra was not so
  inordinately rich as the popular journals would have their readers believe.
  It was true that she made an almost princely income, but, on the other hand,
  she was more than recklessly extravagant, and, like most of her class,
  exceedingly generous and open-handed. With her it was emphatically a case of
  easy come, easy go, so that there were times when she was more or less short
  of ready money.</p>

  <p>It might be urged that she was obtaining ready money every week-end; this,
  indeed, was true. But then Cleopatra was as ambitious as she was
  unscrupulous, and looked forward to the time when she would have a fine place
  of her own in the country, where she could entertain her friends with that
  lavish display and splendour which were in accord with the best traditions of
  Hollywood. She wanted a mansion, some fine old castellated place, with a long
  history behind it, plus a yacht and a villa on the Riviera, to say nothing of
  a grouse moor in Scotland. And all this she might have attained but for the
  really criminal way in which she threw her money about.</p>

  <p>Still, there was another way of achieving the desired end. There always is
  another way where women of Cleopatra's temperament are concerned, always some
  Golconda in sight for those who have the courage and the necessary brains to
  enter it. And, in Cleopatra's case this mine of Ophir was the Stock
  Exchange.</p>

  <p>It was only natural that a woman in her position should have the privilege
  of knowing a great many members of that famous money mart. There was one
  stockbroker in particular in whose hands Cleopatra had been for a long time.
  And, according to his sanguine estimate, there were huge sums of money to be
  picked up before long in the city by those who had the courage to buy and
  hold certain depreciated shares which the man had specified and in which
  Cleopatra had invested many thousands of pounds. Within three months, unless
  the bold young stockbroker was altogether wrong, the golden sheaves were
  coming back a thousandfold. It was only a question of time.</p>

  <p>It was a letter to this effect that Cleopatra was reading in her own
  little sanctum three or four days later when she was interrupted by her
  maid.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Zambra would like to see you, miss," she said.</p>

  <p>Cleopatra looked up from her letter impatiently.</p>

  <p>"What, at this time of the morning?" she asked. "I have hardly finished my
  breakfast and, really, I am not fit to be seen. Tell him to come again at tea
  time."</p>

  <p>But Zambra was not to be put off. He must see Cleopatra at once on the
  most important business. The spoilt beauty shrugged her shoulders and gave
  the necessary order. A minute later Zambra entered the room with his usual
  expression of admiration on his face. Cleopatra had been using a mere figure
  of speech when she said she was not fit to be seen. She was clad in some sort
  of kimono affair opened at the throat and showing a thin filmy foam of lace
  and silk beneath that that was only a shade whiter than her exquisitely fair
  skin. That wonderful amber hair of hers was plaited in a thick, shining rope
  and hung negligently over her shoulder to the waist.</p>

  <p>"Well, my dear boy," she smiled. "And what extraordinary catastrophe has
  brought you here at this early hour of the day? At first I declined to see
  you. No man, even a woman's husband, has any right to intrude upon her at 11
  o'clock in the morning. You must think me a perfect fright."</p>

  <p>"Ah, you will never be that," Zambra said gallantly.</p>

  <p>There was no trace of agitation or anger about him. He had come there
  schooled for that almost vital interview, and he was not going to show his
  hand until circumstances compelled him.</p>

  <p>"Very nice of you," Cleopatra murmured. "But, my dear boy, what are you
  doing here at this time of the morning?"</p>

  <p>"I don't wonder at your being astonished," Zambra said half
  apologetically. "But the fact of the matter is I want that diamond. I must
  have it."</p>

  <p>"But what on earth for?" Cleopatra asked innocently. "I hope you don't
  think that it isn't safe in my hands."</p>

  <p>"Well, is it?" Zambra retorted smilingly. "Do you ever lock it up? But of
  course you don't. You keep it lying about on your dressing-table ready for
  any thief who comes along."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that, is true," Cleopatra, sighed dolefully.</p>

  <p>"Well, I want it," Zambra said with just a shade of impatience in his
  tone. "You shall have it back later on, but for the moment I am bound to
  raise money. The fact of the matter is that when I left here the other night,
  I went on old Mint's and I had the most infernal luck with the cards. They
  fairly skinned me out. For the time being I am broke to the world. Honestly,
  Cleopatra, I don't know where to put my hand on a five-pound note. There is
  more coming from America, but that will not be much this side of Christmas. I
  hate to borrow from women, but unless you can find me five thousand pounds
  spot cash&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Zambra paused significantly, knowing perfectly well that Cleopatra could
  do nothing of the kind. He was quite well aware of her financial position,
  and, indeed, on the whole, he would have been intensely disappointed if the
  woman seated opposite to him had answered him in the affirmative.</p>

  <p>"I am most dreadfully sorry, Carl," Cleopatra said. "But I am up the
  financial pole myself. I have had some pretty heavy deals on the Stock
  Exchange lately, and all my spare cash is locked up. Otherwise I should have
  been delighted."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that's all right," Zambra said cheerfully. "I will take the will for
  the deed, and, in any case, I could not borrow money from you. That sort of
  thing is not done."</p>

  <p>"Not in circles where the code is so honourable as it is amongst us,"
  Cleopatra smiled maliciously. "Still, you do want money. How are you going to
  get it?"</p>

  <p>"I thought I had already told you," Zambra went on. "I am going to pawn
  that diamond. I know where I can place it safely without any awkward
  questions being asked and, anyway, it will only be for a month or two. Would
  you mind fetching it?"</p>

  <p>Cleopatra looked up lazily from her chair. There was not the slightest
  sign of uneasiness or agitation about her.</p>

  <p>"Very sorry, old chap," she said coolly. "But I can't give it to you. I
  know it will come as a great shock, but that diamond is no longer in my
  possession. Stolen, my boy stolen."</p>

  <p>"What," Zambra cried with a fine show of indignation. "Stolen! You sit
  quietly there and tell me one of the finest diamonds in the world has been
  stolen with less feeling than you would display if some loafer had walked off
  with your little dog. But what do you mean by stolen? Explain."</p>

  <p>"I knew it would be a bit of a nasty jar for you," Cleopatra said. "But
  the stone was stolen two or three nights ago. And I am afraid I am not quite
  blameless. It is like this. You know how careless I am over little things and
  how I lose them out of my bag and all that. Well, last Tuesday night I
  happened to notice that one of my latchkeys was missing. Of course, I thought
  I had taken it out with me and dropped it in the street or something equally
  silly. Anyway, it was gone, and I didn't give it another thought. Then on
  Wednesday I came back from the Colidrome after having a mouthful of supper at
  the Ritz, and I went to bed not long after twelve."</p>

  <p>"You went to bed as early as that?" Zambra cried. "Then you must have been
  in bed when&mdash;I mean that was most extraordinarily early for you, wasn't
  it? Anything the matter?"</p>

  <p>"No, nothing except that I was feeling very tired and bored with the world
  in general. So I came home as I have said and went straight to bed. I slept
  well, and in the morning my maid came to me and said that I must have
  forgotten my key the night before because she found it outside the door, left
  in the lock."</p>

  <p>"And did you leave it there," Zambra asked, knowing perfectly well that
  Cleopatra had done nothing of the kind.</p>

  <p>"Of course I didn't, my dear boy. It was lying on my dressing-table when I
  got up. And the third key was on the hook, and is there still. When the girl
  told me that, I knew that somebody had picked up that key and used it to get
  into the flat in the dead of the night. So I had a good look round."</p>

  <p>Zambra stood there cursing his over-cleverness under his breath. He saw
  quite clearly now that it would have been far wiser to have taken the key
  away with him and thrown it into some place where it would never be seen
  again.</p>

  <p>"Well," he demanded impatiently. "And what was missing."</p>

  <p>"Only one thing," Cleopatra sighed. "And that was the diamond necklet. I
  didn't wear it to the Colidrome, but left it on the dressing-table instead. I
  saw it when I got into bed, but when I got up in the morning it was
  missing."</p>

  <p>For, some time no sound came from Zambra. He hardly knew what to say or
  do. He did not know whether this woman was bluffing or not. He must have time
  to reconsider his position and decide upon some course of action. Rarely, if
  ever, in the course of his long and successful criminal career had he been
  faced with such a terrible impasse as this.</p>

  <p>"And you did nothing," he cried. "You didn't even let me know. I should
  like to know why."</p>

  <p>"Oh, didn't I?" Cleopatra flared up. "I rang up Scotland Yard and told
  them all about it and they are making inquiries. Meanwhile, they advised me
  to say nothing, and above all things, to avoid what they call publicity."</p>

  <p>Zambra stood almost frozen in his tracks, for the very last thing in the
  world he wanted had happened.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch19">CHAPTER XIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IN all the course of his tortuous, twisted life, Zambra had
never been
  more bewildered and puzzled than he was at that moment. He knew, of course,
  that fate had played some amazing trick upon him, but how far the smiling
  beauty opposite him was responsible for this last misfortune it was
  impossible for him to say with any degree of certainty.</p>

  <p>And now Cleopatra had done the last thing in the world that he wanted.
  Knowing full well where the missing diamond came from, and being alive to all
  the circumstances that surrounded that magnificent stone, she had actually
  had the audacity to place that matter in the hands of the police and that
  without consulting the party most deeply concerned in the business.</p>

  <p>He was shaking with inward rage. He would like to have grasped Cleopatra
  by the throat and choked the teeth out of her. But he could not do that, he
  would have to play a different game altogether. Moreover, she was not in the
  least afraid of him. She sat there in all her exotic and glowing beauty
  smiling into his face as if the tragedy was no more than the loss of some
  silver trifle from her dressing table. And the more she smiled through those
  wonderful eyes of hers, and the cooler she became, so did Zambra rage and
  boil proportionately.</p>

  <p>"What fiendish trick have you played upon me," he demanded furiously. "You
  have robbed me."</p>

  <p>"My dear Carl," Cleopatra said meaningly. "Pray be reasonable. Of course,
  you cannot expect me to be as upset over this business as you are, because I
  have lost practically nothing. At the same time, I am very sorry and I very
  much regret now that I didn't send the diamond to the bank."</p>

  <p>But there was no particular regret in Cleopatra's voice. On the contrary,
  there was a subtle smile on her face and a sort of veiled defiance in her
  eyes that puzzled Zambra and, at the same time, filled him with vague alarm.
  It was not for him to know that Cleopatra was aware of the fact that it was
  he himself who had spirited away the King Diamond. Nor was it for him to
  guess that Cleopatra was enjoying this bit of quasi-comedy immensely.</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is all very well," he said. "But that does not give me back my
  lost property. You actually mean to tell me that somebody came into your room
  and took the diamond off the dressing-table when you were in bed?"</p>

  <p>"Who said anything about bed?" Cleopatra asked. "I didn't. I said that the
  burglar managed to get hold of the latchkey I lost or mislaid and stole the
  diamond. Where on earth did you get the idea about my being in bed at the
  time?"</p>

  <p>The woman was mocking him and Zambra knew it. And yet it was impossible
  for him to know why. He turned the conversation into another channel.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that for the moment," he said. "What I want to know is
  why you were mad enough to call in the police. It would have been best a
  thousand times to have lost the stone and said nothing about it. Don't you
  see that inquiries will be made and that I shall be dragged into it. Do you
  suppose that Sir Samuel Oscar doesn't know that he has been robbed of
  thousands of pounds worth of stones? And don't you suppose he is aware of the
  fact that Sir Hercules was at the bottom of it. Now they will be after me
  asking questions. Upon my word, Cleopatra, you have brought a fine hornet's
  nest about my head. And here am I with this trouble hanging over me and not a
  five-pound note to call my own. You will have to help. You will have to let
  me have a thousand or two in the next few hours."</p>

  <p>"But I can't do it," Cleopatra smiled. "I have got to find a whole lot of
  money before many hours are over or forfeit all my investments. I am very
  sorry, Carl, but I don't see what I can do to help you. If you can wait a
  week or two, I dare say I could manage to scrape&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, shut up," Zambra snarled. "There are half a dozen men in London you
  could go to now and get as much as you like. Those swell hangers-on of yours,
  gilded youths who would give half they possess to be seen dining alone with
  you in some swagger restaurant. You have only to hoist the distress signal
  and they will be after you like wasps round a honey-pot, with their
  cheque-books burning holes in their pockets."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I dare say," Cleopatra said coolly. "But I have never played that
  game and I am not going to begin now. I am no better than I ought to be, and
  I don't profess to live up to any high moral standard, but when I do borrow
  money, it will be from my own husband and nobody else. So you will have to do
  the best you can, my boy. And don't you show any of that ugly temper to me,
  because, if you do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>For Zambra had risen to his feet menacingly, and had made a step in
  Cleopatra's direction. Apparently he thought better of it and strode
  furiously from the room, banging the door behind him as he went. He wanted to
  be alone to think, to puzzle out the extraordinary complication in this
  business and get at the bottom of the scheme by which Cleopatra had deprived
  him of the plunder to obtain which he had taken such terrible risks.</p>

  <p>Cleopatra lay back in her chair and laughed gently to herself. She was
  still turning the matter over in her mind when her maid came in with an
  announcement to the effect that Inspector James Paradine of Scotland Yard
  wanted to see her.</p>

  <p>"Ask him to come in," Cleopatra said calmly.</p>

  <p>Paradine entered more or less apologetically. He would not trouble
  Cleopatra long, but there were a few questions that he would like to ask her.
  He was smooth and respectful in his manner and never betrayed for a moment
  that he had taken over this case because it had come casually to his notice
  at the Yard, and it had struck him that here might be some development of the
  mystery which Sir Samuel Oscar had outlined when he had consulted the
  authorities with regard to all the trouble out there at the Maggersfont Mine.
  It was just possible, therefore, that the bother in South Africa was in some
  way mixed up with Cleopatra and her missing gem, so that Paradine was only
  too pleased to find the case left in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Anything you like to ask, Inspector," Cleopatra said sweetly. "Of course,
  I am terribly distressed over my loss."</p>

  <p>Paradine took leave to himself to doubt it. No woman who had lost so
  valuable a gem would possibly have taken the matter so calmly. He knew
  precisely the type of character she was, and, moreover, he was well aware
  that the adventuress clan did not forfeit a treasure like that without some
  outward and visible sign of anger or disappointment. Bitter rage or floods of
  tears he had expected, but not a calm philosophy like this.</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course," he said. "Naturally. Do I understand that you actually
  saw the burglar?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Cleopatra replied. "He came into my room as I lay in bed. He
  had a flashlight torch in his hand and I could see every movement
  perfectly."</p>

  <p>"You cried out, of course," Paradine murmured.</p>

  <p>"Well, no, I did nothing of the sort," Cleopatra said. "You see, I was
  petrified with terror. And I suppose after the man had gone away I fainted.
  And there I lay till morning absolutely afraid to move. Of course I ought to
  have rung you up on the telephone at once, but it is so easy to be wise
  afterwards."</p>

  <p>To all of which Paradine listened with some doubt. He did not see a woman
  with Cleopatra's perfect nerve and poise lying paralysed with fear whilst she
  was being bereft of something in the nature of a king's ransom.</p>

  <p>"I was mortally afraid," Cleopatra went on. "You see, he might have
  murdered me."</p>

  <p>"Yes, he might," Paradine agreed. "Are there any suspicious circumstances.
  Your maid, for instance&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My maid is beyond reproach," Cleopatra replied. "She has been my friend
  and companion for years. She would do anything for me. I think you can rule
  her out."</p>

  <p>"Then about this latchkey. I understand that the burglar actually left it
  in the door after he had been in the flat."</p>

  <p>"That is perfectly correct, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea how he got hold of it?"</p>

  <p>Cleopatra shook her head. She had probably taken the key herself from the
  hook in the hall and lost it. But, on the other hand, some thief might
  possibly have extracted it from her bag. She was in the habit of leaving her
  bag lying about in the theatre dressing-room, and, more than once, she had
  left it in the ladies' cloak-room of some hotel. Some daring thief with the
  idea of robbing her in his mind might have been dogging her for weeks, with
  the intention of getting hold of the latchkey. She could think of no other
  way. The Inspector knew that that sort of thing often happened, to which
  Paradine inclined his head.</p>

  <p>"More than likely," he said. "I should think on the whole you are right.
  And now a little bit further, madam. How long had that necklace been in your
  possession?"</p>

  <p>As Paradine spoke, he looked straight into the eyes of his companion. It
  was only for an instant that she showed signs of hesitation, but they were
  not lost on Paradine.</p>

  <p>"Oh, some considerable time," she said.</p>

  <p>"And you bought it in London?"</p>

  <p>"N-no," Cleopatra stammered. "I didn't buy it at all. It was a present to
  me from a very dear friend who is now dead. I cannot tell you any more,
  Inspector, because it would be violating confidence and perhaps lead to
  something like a family scandal. You see, a great name is involved."</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite so, quite so," Paradine agreed. "In any case, it is not a
  matter of vital importance."</p>

  <p>He saw the look of relief that crept into Cleopatra's eyes and made a
  mental note of it accordingly. The woman was lying to him and he knew that as
  well as if she had gone down on her knees and made a full confession. And he
  knew, too, that, for the moment, at any rate, he was not likely to get any
  more information from Cleopatra as to the original owner of the stone. That
  it had been handed to her in a moment of weakness by some well known public
  character he did not credit. But, naturally, he was not going to tell
  Cleopatra anything of his thoughts. He asked a few questions and then went
  his way not altogether dissatisfied with the interview.</p>

  <p>When she was alone again Cleopatra breathed a little more easily. She was
  playing a magnificent game of bluff, though possibly she was overdoing her
  part. It would have been just as well, perhaps, if she had waited a little
  longer. But then she had been so anxious to score off Zambra and get away
  with the stone with which she had never intended to part that she had not
  altogether weighed up the consequences. Still, she was under the impression
  that she had thrown sufficient dust in Paradine's eyes to blind the trail
  and, meanwhile, there were other and more pressing things to occupy her
  attention.</p>

  <p>She put the matter out of her mind for the moment and turned to her
  correspondence. The usual letters from her admirers she tore open and flung
  contemptuously into the fireplace. There were others of trivial import, and
  then one that caused her to knit her brows in a frown and pace about the room
  in none too amiable frame of mind. It was a letter directly to her by her
  stockbroker from his office in Bishopsgate-street and asking her to call upon
  him without delay as he had something of great importance to say to her. The
  letter was not typed, but had been written privately by the writer himself
  and was plainly intended for Cleopatra's eye alone.</p>

  <p>The contents were entirely disturbing. There had been something like a
  slump in the city and the Stock Exchange hardly knew whether it stood on its
  head or on its heels. Shares were falling in all directions and the
  particular group in which all Cleopatra's hopes were centred were suffering
  on the whole rather worse than the rest. Would Cleopatra come down at once
  and make arrangements to find another few thousand pounds or, on the other
  hand, would she telephone him and give him instructions to cut the loss and
  get out at once.</p>

  <p>The light of battle flared in Cleopatra's eyes as she read this missive.
  Like all adventuresses, she was a born gambler with no lack of courage, and
  if the situation was to be saved then she was prepared to meet it as far as
  possible. She noted that the letter conveyed the impression that the slump
  was only temporary, and that if Cleopatra could only carry over that two or
  three weeks would see the ship not only in fair water again, but in sight of
  the promised land.</p>

  <p>A few moments' thought and Cleopatra had made up her mind. From the back
  of her wardrobe behind a secret panel she took a small packet which she
  placed carefully in her bag and then drove a few minutes later into
  Bishopsgate-street. A beautifully-turned-out young man with a keen black eye
  and a rather predatory nose, who rose to meet her, was the junior partner in
  the firm, by name, Mark Bliss. To all practical purposes he was alone in the
  business, for his chief had been for the best part of a year in the south of
  France recovering from a nervous breakdown, so that Mark Bliss practically
  was the business.</p>

  <p>"I am very glad to see you," he said. "Now, look here, Madame Cleopatra,
  My letter explained itself. What are you going to do? I am not blaming myself
  for getting you into this mess, because nobody could have foreseen what was
  happening. The greatest financier in the city would say the same thing. It is
  for you to decide. Shall I sell out for you for what the stuff will fetch or
  are you prepared to carry on. For myself, if I had the ready money, I should
  buy and buy and buy. Also, I should be prepared to pay the calls on these
  shares of yours which are sure to be made in a day or two. But I am not going
  to advise you. Perhaps, you had better go to your bankers and ask their
  opinion. I am accepting no responsibility, merely telling you what I should
  do in the same circumstances."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that is all right, Mr. Bliss," Cleopatra said with one of her most
  dazzling smiles. "I am not going to squeal, as they say in America, and I am
  certainly not going to cut my loss. How much have I got to find?"</p>

  <p>"That is the spirit," Bliss applauded. "I wish all my clients were as cool
  and collected as you are. I should think, on the whole, that ten thousand
  would do."</p>

  <p>Bliss spoke of ten thousand as if it had been a handful of marbles. At the
  same time he glanced keenly at Cleopatra, and saw that she had not
  flinched.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," she said. "I can't give it to you in money, because I
  never seem to have any ready cash. I have no doubt I could raise a whole lot
  on my contracts, but that means keeping me short of my daily needs, and I
  don't want to do that. But I have got something here which represents the
  same thing. What do you say to a piece of jewellery?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well," Bliss smiled. "If the jewellery is worth the money I can do
  the rest easily enough. It would not be the first time I have acted for a
  client who wanted to raise a loan on what Mr. Wemmick called portable
  property. I am a bit of a connoisseur of that sort of thing myself. If you
  will send the stuff round to me I will see to it."</p>

  <p>"There is no occasion to do that," Cleopatra said, "I have got it here in
  my bag."</p>

  <p>With that she unfolded a tiny case and took from it a blazing gem that
  made Bliss fairly gasp. Hard man of the world as he was, his eyes blinked in
  its liquid fire.</p>

  <p>"My word, some stone," he exclaimed. "Yes, I suppose that is the diamond
  you were wearing on the night when you opened your show at the Colidrome. You
  want me to dispose of it?"</p>

  <p>"Oh no, I don't," Cleopatra laughed. "I want you to raise ten thousand
  pounds on it. I suppose you can do that without publicity or any questions
  being asked by some pawnbroker."</p>

  <p>"Oh, that will be all right," Bliss assured her. "I have got a man round
  the corner, so to speak, who is good for any amount. They do all kinds of
  business, but they call themselves general merchants. Now, if you will just
  sit down and give me an authority to deal with this property, I will proceed
  at once to raise the necessary funds."</p>

  <p>Whereupon, Bliss scribbled a few lines on a sheet of the office notepaper
  and Cleopatra appended her scrawl of a signature. Five minutes later, Bliss
  bowed her out of his office with many compliments and then returned coolly
  enough to his desk, though he was shaking from head to foot so that he
  consumed three matches in an attempt to light a cigarette. But once this was
  finished he put on his hat and walked along Bishopsgate-street until he came
  to a little alleyway about half-way down, into which he plunged and finally
  disappeared into a gloomy building which bore a brass plate to the effect
  that here were the offices of Messrs. Eli Putress and Son, general
  merchants.</p>

  <p>In the clerk's office Bliss asked for Mr. Mark Putress and a moment later
  was seated in that individual's dark and none-too-savoury den. The little man
  with the beady eyes and close curly hair and decidedly Semitic case of
  countenance proffered his cigar box and asked Bliss his business. The latter,
  without the slightest hesitation, produced the diamond from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of that, Mark?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The eyes of Mr. Mark Putress shone almost as brightly as the stone
  itself.</p>

  <p>"Ach, what a beauty," he said. "The finest stone I have ever seen. I don't
  want to ask no awkward questions, Mr. Bliss, but I think I have seen that
  diamond before."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have no doubt you have," Bliss said hastily, but none too pleased
  to hear what the little Jew had to say. "But never mind about that. What I
  want to know is what you are prepared to advance upon it."</p>

  <p>"Well, that depends," the other said cautiously. "Have you got any
  authority to deal with it?"</p>

  <p>Bliss thrust his authority across the table.</p>

  <p>"Oh, there you are if you must know," he said. "But I think you might have
  trusted me."</p>

  <p>"I trust nobody," the Jew said. "And when it comes to dealing with a stone
  like that I have to be cautious. And there won't be any talk, either. Why,
  we've got half the jewels of the aristocracy in our bank. So there is no
  cause to make a fuss about the pretty actress. What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, not a lot," Bliss said. "Ten thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, you can have that," the other remarked. "You can have that or
  five times the amount. Still, naturally, we don't want to advance more than
  people ask for. Will you take a cheque or would you prefer notes?"</p>

  <p>"Notes," Bliss said curtly, and the other smiled. "Just as well not to
  have too much on record."</p>

  <p>Putress summoned a clerk, who came back presently with a cheque-book and
  at the end of a further ten minutes the notes appeared, and Bliss placed them
  carefully in his pocketbook. He took a sort of formal receipt for the
  diamond, and, after a few moments, left the office on his way back to his
  own. On the whole he had done a splendid morning's work and he was more than
  satisfied with it. But the tense look was still upon his face and his hands
  were still trembling as he sat down a little later on before his desk and
  began to write slowly. It was a long letter which he proceeded to make up
  into a sort of parcel when the door of his office opened and a clerk came
  in.</p>

  <p>"A gentleman to see you, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>The clerk laid a card on the table, and stood waiting for instructions.
  Bliss glanced at the name, Chief Constable Edger Morrit, Scotland Yard, and
  gasped as he read. His voice was steady enough, however, as he told the clerk
  to invite the gentleman to come upstairs. Still, his face was deadly white,
  and he wiped a bead of perspiration from his forehead as Morrit came into the
  room.</p>

  <p>"And what do you want with me?"</p>

  <p>"I have a warrant for your apprehension, sir," Morrit said. "Forgery and
  fraud. I will read it over to you if you like, and I give you the usual
  warning. Will you come quietly, or would you prefer to call a taxi? One of my
  men is waiting downstairs, and I will hand you over to him."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Bliss said quietly. "I have nothing to say. Oh, yes, I am
  ready to go now."</p>

  <p>In the street, a plain-clothes policeman and a taxi were waiting. Morrit
  gave Bliss into the charge of this stolid-looking officer, with the necessary
  instructions. Then he turned away himself, racing westwards, and, a second
  later, found himself face to face with Sir Samuel Oscar.</p>

  <p>"Just the man I wanted to see," the latter said. "Oh yes, I saw that
  business, and I am not a bit surprised."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch20">CHAPTER XX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MORRIT preserved an aspect of wooden immobility.</p>

  <p>"I don't quite follow, Sir Samuel," he said.</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," Sir Samuel laughed. "Your attitude is quite correct, but
  you must not imagine that we in the city go about with our eyes shut. As a
  matter of fact, that young man Mark Bliss was at one time more or less a
  protege of mine, and if he had listened to reason&mdash;however, he would go
  off on his own account, and there was an end of him as far as I was
  concerned. Brilliantly clever, but just a little bit too anxious to get rich
  quick. I have been expecting something of that sort for some little time. If
  you have five minutes to spare, I wish you would look in at my office. I mean
  now."</p>

  <p>"Half a minute, Sir Samuel," Morrit said. "As you have seen so much, I
  don't mind admitting to you that I have just arrested Bliss on a charge of
  fraud and forgery. It looks like being a sensational case, but I need not go
  into that. I must just run back upstairs and put my seals on the outer door
  of the man's private office, and then I will be with you."</p>

  <p>Five minutes later, Morrit was seated in a chair in Sir Samuel's private
  office with a choice cigar.</p>

  <p>"Now, sir," he said. "I can give you just about a quarter of an hour and
  then I must be off back to the Yard."</p>

  <p>"That will be quite sufficient," Sir Samuel said. "Now, touching that
  matter of Sir Hercules Slaney and the little story I told Paradine and
  yourself. Have you got any further?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no, we haven't," Morrit returned. "As a matter of fact, it is more
  Paradine's case than mine. To tell the truth, we are absolutely fogged. We
  don't even know how Sir Hercules met with his death, and as to that diamond
  smuggling you are so interested in, it still has us guessing. As I came into
  your office, I was wondering if you could give us a pointer or two."</p>

  <p>"Well, I can't," Sir Samuel confessed. "But I rather think that one of my
  bright young men can. I have been talking it over with him and he was coming
  to see you in a day or two. He will not be back in London before Friday, and
  when he returns I will ask him to run round as far as the Yard."</p>

  <p>"And who might he be?" Morrit asked.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Lionel Bly. Lately Sir Hercules's private secretary, and now in my
  employ. I should have thought that you would have taken him into your
  confidence before."</p>

  <p>"But what could he have told us? I understand from the few words we did
  have with him that he was not a scientist, and that he was not deeply in Sir
  Hercules's confidence."</p>

  <p>"I believe that to be correct," Sir Samuel agreed. "Slaney was a queer,
  secretive creature, and I am firmly under the impression that he was quite
  mad towards the last. But, all the same, I think you will find that Mr. Bly
  has something interesting to talk about. I persuaded him to come and see you,
  only there was a little matter of business to clear up first, and when he
  comes back he shall certainly call upon you."</p>

  <p>Having gone so far, Sir Samuel was not inclined to further confide in
  Morrit. It was not for the latter to know anything about the King Diamond, at
  least, not at present. Nor that Sir Samuel had given Bly his emphatic opinion
  to the effect that in keeping certain information to himself he ran the risk
  of finding a good deal of trouble later on. This, however, Sir Samuel did not
  mention, neither was he going to.</p>

  <p>It was three days later when Bly found himself in Scotland Yard. He first
  saw Morrit, who passed him on to Paradine, and left the latter with a free
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Bly," Paradine said. "I understand that you have certain
  information. At the same time, if you know anything you ought to have come to
  us before."</p>

  <p>"I dare say I ought," Bly said coolly. "But there were reasons why I
  didn't. To begin with I must tell you that I was not in Sir Hercules's
  confidence. I was a secretary and go-between in his dealings with the
  natives, because, you see, I know a lot about that type of humanity and I can
  speak several dialects. My business was to take care of Sir Hercules's
  correspondence and write his letters. Beyond that, I knew little or nothing
  of his inner life. So you see that, whatever I have discovered has been
  through my own efforts. Still, I can do nothing practical so long as we are
  here. If you have the time to spare I should like you to run round as far as
  Devonshire Mansions with me and then I can show you something
  interesting."</p>

  <p>Paradine was nothing loth. They went off at once and came at length to the
  late Sir Hercules's flat. There had been no attempt to reduce things to
  order, no effort to remove the dust and dirt though the big room certainly
  showed signs of human occupation within a short time.</p>

  <p>"Who has been here?" Paradine asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"Nobody but myself, I can assure you," Bly said. "And only that with your
  permission. In my spare time, I have been arranging my late employer's papers
  because my idea is to hand them on to some prominent man of science who will
  see whether Sir Hercules's extraordinary claims have any basis in fact.
  Personally I believe such to be the case, but that is only my idea."</p>

  <p>Paradine suddenly pricked up his ears.</p>

  <p>"What is that extraordinary whining noise," he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, those are the rats," Bly explained.</p>

  <p>"Oh yes, of course," Paradine said. "Sir Hercules's faculty of coloured
  rats. I remember seeing them the first day we were here. What on earth are
  they for?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, scientific investigations, inoculation, and all that sort of thing.
  Vivisection, all the peculiar mysteries that men of science indulge in. There
  are rats of all kinds and colours here, and it is through cross-breeding them
  that Sir Hercules hoped to obtain his serum for changing the coloured races
  into white. There was one family of black rats that he treasured more than he
  did his own life, so I have made it my business to look after them and see
  that they are properly fed so that Sir Hercules' successor may be able to
  carry on exactly where my late employer left off. But never mind that,
  inspector. What you want to know is how Mr Hercules met with his death."</p>

  <p>"Well, I have some curiosity that way," Paradine said dryly.</p>

  <p>"I am going to tell," Bly said. "Because I am perfectly convinced that the
  poor old gentleman was murdered."</p>

  <p>"Very Possibly," Paradine admitted guardedly. "But there is absolutely
  nothing to point to that conclusion. If we could discover where Sir Hercules
  spent the hour between eight and nine on that fatal Monday night, we might
  get a little bit further, but all the best brains in the Yard have failed to
  throw any light on the mystery behind those vital sixty minutes. And that is
  not all. We have it on sound and honest evidence that the poor old gentleman
  came back at nine o'clock in unusually good spirits. He went up to his flat
  and barred himself in, and when the postman called in the morning the flat
  was in the nature of a fortress. Moreover, nobody had been up the stairs
  after nine o'clock except people that the porter knew, and nobody could have
  been concealed in the flat and got away when the front door was forced. And I
  will tell you something more. It has been established by medical evidence
  that Sir Hercules died of an overdose of arsenic. Certain newspapers are
  blaming us for doing nothing, and in one of those sheets I read an ingenious
  theory to the effect that the murderer was concealed in the flat, and that
  after half suffocating the victim by choking him with a hand in a soft glove,
  contrived to pour that arsenic down his throat, and thus convey an impression
  of suicide. You are not going to suggest, Mr. Bly, that there could be
  anything in a theory like this?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Bly agreed. "And, moreover, I am absolutely convinced of
  the fact that there was nobody in this flat either before or after the crime.
  But Slaney was murdered all the same. Now I have been making inquiries among
  scientists, and I have made certain discoveries. The amazing thing to me is
  that your experts have not hit upon the idea before."</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it, Mr. Bly?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that, for the moment, I am not going to tell you. But I don't mind
  giving you the name of the murderer and telling you where it was that Sir
  Hercules spent that fatal hour."</p>

  <p>"You actually know that." Paradine exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Most assuredly I do. Sir Hercules went out to keep an appointment that
  precise Monday night at 8 o'clock in the lounge of the Hotel Legation, and
  the man he arranged to meet is called Carl Zambra. And that I can prove by
  credible witnesses and a photograph of the man himself taken for one of the
  picture papers. In fact, a friend of mine engineered that photograph. And, if
  that is not sufficient, then I can produce the waiter who was on duty in the
  lounge of the Hotel Legation on the night of the murder. More than that, I
  can tell you all about this Zambra. I have never met him myself, but I am
  familiar with his sinister history, and a friend of mine can tell you even
  more than I. He is here in London at the present moment, and his address can
  be ascertained easily."</p>

  <p>"But how on earth did you got hold of all this?" Paradine asked. "And why
  haven't you come to us before?"</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps I ought to have done so," Bly admitted. "I intended to,
  sooner or later, and nothing has been lost by the delay. You know all about
  the leakage of stones from the Maggersfont Diamond Mine because Sir Samuel
  Oscar consulted you in this direction. But I don't suppose he told you about
  one particular stone of stupendous value which was smuggled out of the mine.
  You see, I happen to be interested in that, I have more than a shrewd idea
  where that diamond is and it is practically the object of my life to get it
  back again. If I do, then my reward will be a fortune in itself, but if it
  comes back to its proper owners through the police, then I get nothing. That
  is why I have kept my own counsel until the present moment, when I realise
  that it is my duty to tell you all I know. But we will leave the diamond
  business out of it if you don't mind, because that is a separate issue, and,
  for the moment, we will concentrate on the crime connected with Sir
  Hercules's death. Now, inspector, how many letters are there in the
  alphabet?"</p>

  <p>"Pulling my leg?" Paradine asked curtly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," Bly smiled. "If you will answer my question, I am
  going to show you something."</p>

  <p>"Well, there are twenty-six," Paradine murmured.</p>

  <p>"Precisely, twenty-six capitals and twenty six small letters. Now, how
  many cards are there in a pack?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, fifty-two, of course. What the deuce&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, please don't interrupt. Well, here we are. Having admitted that the
  alphabet consists of fifty-two letters, counting large and small, and that
  there are the same number of cards in a pack, let me tell you that my late
  employer was exceedingly fond of a game of patience. He found it a wonderful
  relaxation when his brain was overtaxed. On the little table yonder you will
  see a problem laid out&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I noticed that before," Paradine said impatiently.</p>

  <p>"So I expected," Bly went on. "And yet it conveyed nothing to you. You
  didn't see any significance in those fifty-two cards laid out in their
  numerical order or in the numbers in the corner of each? No, I can see you
  didn't. And yet the answer to the riddle is there. Mind you, I should never
  have found it out myself had it not been for a childish outburst on the part
  of Sir Hercules during the Saturday before his death when we were down at
  Ravenswood staying with Sir Samuel Oscar. As a matter of fact, I had quite
  forgotten to take a copy of Saturday's 'Times' with me, and Sir Hercules was
  dreadfully upset about it. When we reached Victoria on the Monday afternoon
  he fairly raced to the bookstall for that day's issue of the paper in
  question. I didn't notice it at the time, but when you gave me the run of the
  flat, it all came back to my mind. Now, here are the two copies of the
  'Times' we want. And here are the ciphers in the agony column, the key to
  which lies in those patience cards. But perhaps I had better explain."</p>

  <p>With the two copies of the 'Times' before him placed by the little table
  where the patience cards lay, Bly proceeded to dilate at length upon his
  discovery. Then, when he had convinced Paradine that he had made a discovery
  of tremendous importance the latter jumped to his feet and walked excitedly
  about the room.</p>

  <p>"Upon my word, I must congratulate you," he said. "This is really
  something to go on at last. We know now exactly what Sir Hercules was doing
  on that Monday night between eight and nine. He was, of course, at the Hotel
  Legation, meeting this man Zambra. But why all this secrecy?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, if you knew as much about I.D.B. as I do you would not be surprised
  at that," Bly smiled. "You will find when you come to go thoroughly into this
  matter that Carl Zambra is the man who acted as the go-between in connection
  with the diamonds which Sir Hercules personally smuggled out of the
  Maggersfont Mine. You see, the poor old gentleman was bound to have an
  accomplice. He knew nothing whatever about business, and if he had got away
  himself with a handful of stones he would not have had the remotest idea of
  how to got rid of them. And that is where Zambra came in. I believe Zambra
  suggested the whole business. He managed to scrape acquaintance with Sir
  Hercules, and it didn't take him very long to discover that the latter was
  desperately short of money. He was bound to have money for his expensive
  experiments, because they called for all sorts of delicate instruments. When
  we came back to England, I don't think that Sir Hercules had five pounds in
  the world. And yet, within a day or two, he had notes in his safe worth
  thousands. I am perfectly certain that he got them from Zambra, and that they
  represented the last raid on the Maggersfont Mine. It was a very cunning idea
  of Zambra's to more or less pave the way for Sir Hercules to obtain the
  entree to the mines with the excuse that he wanted to study the natives
  there, whilst, all the while he was within the compound where a Kafir called
  M'Papo was busily employed in hiding such stones as had been selected for the
  purpose, so that a man of Sir Hercules's high reputation could convey them
  outside without anybody having the slightest suspicion of his integrity. And
  now I will tell you something else, Inspector. Did you happen to read
  anything in the local Press about the mysterious death of a Kafir in the
  neighbourhood of Ravenswood at the time we were staying there? To dot the
  'i's' and cross the 't's,' the thing happened on the very evening we reached
  Ravenswood. The nigger accosted Sir Hercules and they had words. After that
  the man was found dead, and in the palm of his hand Dr. Masefield and myself
  found quite a valuable diamond. That fact the police have not as yet
  mentioned, at least, not in public, because we particularly requested them
  not to do so. But, at any rate, they will confirm my story. And that native
  was M'Papo."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm dashed!" Paradine exclaimed. "Do you think that this fellow
  followed Sir Hercules to England?"</p>

  <p>"I am absolutely certain of it," Bly said. "I spoke to him in the street
  and warned him not to go near Sir Hercules, whose address he asked me to give
  him. And I suppose he took my advice, because he sheered off. But I presume
  he didn't go very far, probably he was hanging about the neighbourhood and
  followed Sir Hercules and myself to Victoria station. I didn't realise it was
  M'Papo at the time and I couldn't actually prove it now, but there is very
  little doubt in my mind that I am right."</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure you are," Paradine said emphatically. "Now, Mr. Bly, why
  did those two men meet at the Hotel Legation and what was the necessity for
  the cipher? They could have communicated by telephone and the mere fact of
  them being seen together in London would have had no particular
  significance."</p>

  <p>"You never can tell," Bly said. "Of one thing I can assure you. It would
  never have done for those two men to have met in South Africa anywhere.
  Zambra was known to the police as a cunning trafficker in illicit stones,
  though they never could lay him by the heels, and if Sir Hercules had been
  seen with him only once, then the little game of the Maggersfont Mine would
  have been burked. Of course the police knew that there was a leakage of
  stones there and I expect they kept a pretty close eye on Zambra. That is why
  the cipher was invented. I have been into Fleet-street to the offices of one
  or two South African dailies and searched their files. In one of
  them&mdash;the 'Kimberley Morning Post'&mdash;I actually found a pair of
  those messages and translated them. One was from Sir Hercules and the other a
  reply from Zambra. They were to much the same effect as those ciphers in the
  'Times.' And now I think you know pretty well all about it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I am infinitely obliged to you," Paradine said. "And I must
  compliment you on some exceedingly good work. But, at the same time, I still
  think you are keeping something back, something in connection with that
  diamond. Now, we have nothing whatever to do with that and I will not get in
  your way if I can possibly help it. Have you any sort of idea where that
  wonderful stone is concealed at the present moment?"</p>

  <p>Before Bly could reply, Morrit came into the room.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am sorry to interrupt you," he said. "But I must have a word or two
  with you, Paradine, with regard to that Bliss case. If Mr. Bly will kindly
  excuse us&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, please don't get up, Mr. Bly," Paradine said. "Go on, Morrit. Mr. Bly
  is more or less one of us and I don't suppose he will say anything of what he
  hears."</p>

  <p>"Well, in any case, it is mere routine," Morrit said. "You know, of
  course, that when Bliss was searched at the police station, ten thousand
  pounds in notes were found in his possession. When I came to search the
  office, I found a lot of evidence, pointing to an early departure on the
  prisoner's part. I have had no chance to search his papers or his desk until
  this morning, but when I did I lighted on this."</p>

  <p>With that, Morrit handed a sheet of note-paper across the table to his
  colleague, who read it with a slow smile dawning on his face as he did
  so.</p>

  <p>"Now this is a most extraordinary coincidence," he said. "But then, we
  police live on coincidences. I rather think this will interest you, Mr. Bly.
  It is a receipt for a magnificent diamond pledged by Bliss on the very
  morning of his arrest with the firm of Eli Putress and Co. for ten thousand
  pounds. Here is a rough description of the stone and its weight. I should not
  in the least wonder if this were not your diamond."</p>

  <p>"But who is Bliss?" Bly asked. "And who are Putress and Co., and what have
  they to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can explain that," Morrit struck in. "You see, I had been
  watching Mark Bliss for several days. I knew that he was up to his neck in
  difficulties, and before the warrant was issued I had instructions to keep my
  eye on that gentleman. So practically everybody who called upon him was known
  to me. Amongst his callers and within an hour of his arrest was that
  beautiful and famous actress Madame Cleopatra."</p>

  <p>"What!" Bly shouted. "What!" Then he turned suddenly to Paradine. "That
  woman was in possession of the diamond I am seeking. It seems pretty plain to
  me that, for some reason or another, she handed the stone over to Bliss."</p>

  <p>"To pawn," Morrit said significantly. "Stock Exchange speculations and all
  that sort of game. Just the sort of thing a woman of that type would do. No
  doubt she handed over that diamond to Bliss shortly before I arrested him,
  for he took it straight round to Putress with the object of raising money. He
  did raise the money, and we found it in his pocket. An hour or two more and
  he would have been on his way to the Continent. However, I will soon settle
  that matter. I will run down to the office of Putress and Co., and see Mr.
  Ben, who signed this receipt."</p>

  <p>"Would you mind if I came along?" Bly asked.</p>

  <p>Paradine raised no objection. This strange affair was growing more and
  more complete. There jumped to his mind the recollection that Cleopatra had
  consulted him when the diamond was missing, and now here she was apparently
  conniving at the pawning of the very jewel which she alleged had been stolen.
  But for the moment Paradine did not allude to that.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ben Putress was quite ready to receive his visitors, but his gay and
  easy manner changed as Morrit disclosed his business and requested that the
  pawned diamond should be handed over to the police as it was required for
  their investigations. He rubbed his moist palms nervously together and wiped
  a pale and clammy face with a hand that was none too steady.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I am awfully sorry," he stammered. "Most unfortunate. But you see
  I have unfortunately lost it."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch21">CHAPTER XXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"LOST it!" Morrit echoed. "Do you mean stolen, sir?"</p>

  <p>The little man wriggled about uneasily. He was cutting a rather sorry
  figure and he painfully realised it.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly," he stammered, "not exactly." He seemed to be swallowing
  something hard. "But perhaps I had better explain. The stone you are alluding
  to came into my&mdash;or rather I should say the firm's possession&mdash;in
  unfortunate circumstances. I mean it was deposited with us
  by&mdash;by&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No occasion to hesitate, sir," Morrit said. "It was pledged for
  &pound;10,000 by one Mark Bliss who at the present moment is in custody on a
  charge of fraud and forgery. In fact, I arrested him myself, and when I did
  so the money I speak of was actually found in his possession. It was in notes
  and those notes came from your bank. Is not that so?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am not denying it," Putress said. "It is no uncommon thing for us
  to advance large sums on personal security if we know anything about the
  people we are dealing with. I need hardly say that I never suspected Mr.
  Bliss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Morrit swept the suggestion on one side.</p>

  <p>"Ah, of course, of course," he said. "But that is not the point, Mr.
  Putress. We have every reason to believe that Bliss raised that large sum of
  money on a security that did not belong to him. I don't think you are
  prepared to deny that the stone in question was worth very much more than the
  amount that you loaned on it&mdash;in fact it was a diamond almost unique
  outside recognised historic stones."</p>

  <p>"Yes, that is right enough," Putress sighed. "Of course, if there is
  anything wrong we shall have to make it good. It the owner will come forward
  and give us some idea of its full value we can talk matters over. And I need
  not tell you that we are good for any amount. If the stone was worth half a
  million we should be able to. And that without unduly crippling the resources
  of the establishment. I am not boasting."</p>

  <p>Morrit knew that perfectly well. He knew that Putress and Co. were a firm
  with branches all over the world and that very few big international
  financial transactions took place without their having a hand in it.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I quite admit that, Mr. Putress," he said. "The people who really own
  the diamond know perfectly well that they are going to suffer no loss. But,
  as I pointed out to you before, that is not the real issue. It is the stone
  itself that we want to recover and we are looking to you to help us. What do
  you mean by saying you have lost it?"</p>

  <p>"Well, it was like this," the little man went on. "It was a beautiful
  stone, the finest I have ever seen. I should not like to say what it is
  worth, but in America it might fetch anything up to a quarter of a million or
  more. It was mounted as a necklet on a thin platinum chain. Really a lovely
  piece of work and I admired it immensely. I ought to have deposited it
  straight in the bank, but I wanted to show it to a friend of mine, so I put
  it in my pocket and I suppose I must have lost it on the way home. Anyway, it
  has gone and I am quite prepared to face the consequences."</p>

  <p>The little man looked defiantly at Morrit as he finished. And Morrit knew
  that the speaker was lying. Why he should lie in the circumstances was a
  mystery, but the detective was absolutely sure that Putress was not telling
  the truth.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," he said, "I don't think I need waste your time any
  longer. You admit having had the diamond, which means that you admit
  liability."</p>

  <p>Putress was almost abject in his eager desire to meet Morrit's wishes. He
  was ready to do anything, he said, especially if there was to be no
  publicity. He was at the disposal of Scotland Yard whenever they liked to see
  him, and he apologised over and over again until Morrit and Bly vanished.</p>

  <p>"Well, what do you think of it?" Bly asked.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe a word he was saying," Morrit smiled. "Still, he admits
  his liability, and that is something to the good. It looks to me, Mr. Bly, as
  it you would never see your diamond again."</p>

  <p>Bly shook his head sadly. All this had been a bitter blow to him, the more
  so as half an hour back he seemed to have that precious possession
  practically in his grasp.</p>

  <p>"I can't make it out at all," he said. "Why should a man in Putress'
  position behave like that? And why should he say be had lost the stone when,
  obviously he had done nothing of the sort? Can you make anything of it?"</p>

  <p>Morrit shook his head, and together, in silence, the two made their way
  back to Scotland Yard, and there reported their want of success to Paradine.
  It was clear that the big man was just as puzzled as his subordinate had
  been.</p>

  <p>"I can't make head or tall of it," he admitted. "There is no question
  whatever that Bliss got hold of what Mr. Bly here calls the King Diamond in
  some sort of mysterious manner and pawned it for a large sum of money. He
  wanted that money to clear out of the country with and he would have done so
  if Morrit had not been too quick for him. When Madame Cleopatra came to me
  and told me that she had been robbed&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What!" Bly cried, "Cleopatra came to you and actually told you that she
  had lost a most valuable diamond?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly she did. She told me a story that bore the stamp of truth. Some
  burglar managed to get hold of one of the latchkeys to her flat and actually
  took away the diamond in its platinum setting as she lay in bed."</p>

  <p>"And she never cried out," Bly said. "Unless I am greatly mistaken, that
  is not the Cleopatra I have heard so much about. The woman has any amount of
  pluck and courage and she certainly would not have been robbed without a
  protest."</p>

  <p>"Well, that is the story she told me, anyway," Paradine took up the tale.
  "It was rather a convincing narrative, and I am not sure that it wasn't
  strictly true."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm not," Morrit said curtly. "I believe that Madame Cleopatra
  humbugged you, just as Putress was trying to humbug me little time ago. I
  have been making inquiries the last day or two, and my man who was doing the
  shadowing business tells me that Madame Cleopatra was in Bliss's office less
  than an hour before he was arrested. She was smiling when she went into the
  office and she looked just as pleased with herself when she came out. At
  least, so the man tells me."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you made no mistake in identity?" Bly suggested.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no. We don't make mistakes, especially when public characters are
  concerned. Practically the whole of London knows Cleopatra by sight. She
  walked all along Cheapside with my man close behind her."</p>

  <p>"Oh, did she!" Bly cried. "That isn't much like Cleopatra. She never walks
  a yard if she can help it. It is evident that she didn't want to be
  recognised. Now, I wonder if you will laugh if I suggest that she visited
  Bliss on purpose to give him the stone and that he pledged it with her full
  consent."</p>

  <p>"Now, I should think that is more than likely," Morrit said. "Some Stock
  Exchange speculation, probably. No doubt the woman was short of ready money,
  as most of her class always are, and presumably Bliss was putting her on to
  some wonderfully good thing, or said he was, though all the time he meant to
  use those notes for his own purpose. See what I mean?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I do," Paradine agreed. "But fancy the amazing cheek of that
  woman in actually coming to Scotland Yard and telling me that she had been
  robbed of a valuable diamond when it was in her possession all the time.
  Why!"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that we have to find out," Morrit said. "And probably we shall do so
  when we have laid that man Zambra by the heels. The whole thing is mixed up
  together. I think I will run round as far as Cleopatra's flat and have a few
  words with her."</p>

  <p>"Not just yet if I were you," the more cautious Paradine suggested. "And
  don't forget that that part of the case is in my hands, not yours. Cleopatra
  will keep."</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, utterly unconscious of the trouble that was brewing for her,
  Cleopatra had worries enough of her own. To begin with, there was the arrest
  of Bliss and the end of all her dreams so far as those famous speculations
  were concerned, it needed no financial genius to tell her that she had lost
  all her money, and that even her depreciated securities had been disposed of
  by Bliss before his intended flight. In her usual careless way she had left
  them all in the hands of the defaulter, and she had paid the penalty of her
  carelessness. Everything had gone. Including the money raised on the King
  Diamond, and all that she had poured so lavishly into Bliss's lap had
  disappeared. Nor could she say anything. In the face of what she had told
  Paradine it would be almost a farce to go to him and tell him that Bliss had
  got away with her most precious possession when she had already assured
  Paradine that it was no longer in her keeping. She had managed to bluff
  Zambra for the time being, but she could not see herself getting away with it
  in the same fashion with the detective.</p>

  <p>For once in her life she had over-reached herself. It was no use to grieve
  or worry or work herself up into one of those tremendous passions of hers
  because all that would be futile. She had lost practically all she possessed,
  beyond her magnificent salary, and the great dream of a big country house and
  herself playing the gracious hostess to society would have to be delegated to
  the Greek Kalends at least for some years to come. And it was characteristic
  of the woman that, after her first outburst, she settled down to the normal
  again. Still, she decided to give Zambra as wide a berth as possible until
  she could think out some plausible story that might or might not satisfy that
  very suspicious individual. Meanwhile she would not allow this trouble to
  interfere with her normal butterfly life.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch22">CHAPTER XXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CLEOPATRA left the Colidrome a night or two later more or
less at a loose
  end. For once in a way she had no one to take her out to supper, and she was
  in no mood just then to go back to the flat at a time of night when London,
  as she understood it, was just beginning to enjoy itself. She stepped into
  her luxurious car, and hesitated just a moment when the chauffeur asked for
  his orders. Then she made up her mind.</p>

  <p>She would go as far as the Babylon Club. She would get all the excitement
  she required there, to say nothing of a mixed and somewhat sinister company,
  for the Babylon was not exactly noted for its exclusiveness so much as its
  cosmopolitan membership. There were those who said that two-thirds of the
  international scoundrels of the world belonged to the institution, and this
  was no great exaggeration. Still, certain members of society ventured there
  at their own risk, and the fact that they were rubbing shoulders with the
  underworld merely added a spice of excitement to the dubious pleasures of the
  evening.</p>

  <p>Into the almost garishly decorated supper room Cleopatra made her way. She
  swept her fine eyes round, and was more glad than she cared to admit when she
  had assured herself that Zambra did not figure in the well dressed crowd. All
  sorts and positions in life, from the pretty shop girl seeing life under the
  wing at the man about town to a flamboyant princess with an unsavoury
  European reputation. It was all very flashy and meretricious, with, that
  forced air of gaiety and hectic excitement which is the mark of the beast
  where most night clubs are concerned, though Cleopatra was not much intrigued
  by that. There were scores of people there that she knew, and who would
  gladly have welcomed the chance of a seat at her table or a dance later on.
  But for the moment, at any rate, Cleopatra gave no sign as she sat over her
  supper in an atmosphere of cold haughtiness, that kept everybody at a
  respectful distance.</p>

  <p>Then, when she had reached her liqueur and cigarette her quick eye caught
  sight of something that brought the blood to her face and a quicker beat to
  her heart. Outwardly, there was nothing in the couple dancing just in front
  of her to cause this feeling&mdash;merely an exceedingly pretty girl in the
  first flush of her beauty and evidently enjoying herself to the full. She was
  one of those small, fragile-looking blondes with the face of a Madonna and a
  pair of appealing eyes that looked out under a broad, low forehead that was
  crowned with a mass of fair hair parted more or less severely in the middle.
  Her partner was a young man about town whom Cleopatra knew by name, merely
  one of those harmless well-bred young fellows who have more money to spend
  than is good for them and who waste much time in a suffocating atmosphere of
  dance halls, when by nature and inclination they are intended for out-door
  lives.</p>

  <p>Moreover, Cleopatra knew the little Madonna with the dove-like eyes and
  sweet pleading expression. That is to say, she knew her by sight and name,
  because she happened to be a very junior member of the chorus in the
  Colidrome revue where Cleopatra herself queened it as the star. And
  Cleopatra, with her worldly and intimate knowledge of her own sex, was
  perfectly well aware that Cora Lee, as she called herself, was by no means so
  sweetly innocent as she professed to be, and that her saintly expression was
  one of the girl's chief assets.</p>

  <p>Cleopatra sat there for some time breathing heavily and waiting for her
  opportunity. She had herself well in hand now, and the smile on her face
  indicated one who is at peace with all the world and satisfied with life as
  she finds it. But, all the same, her eyes never left the thin platinum chain
  around the young girl's neck and the King Diamond that blazed in the centre
  of it. She had not the slightest doubt it was the King Diamond, but how it
  came there, and how Cora Lee had obtained possession of it was a mystery she
  was determined to solve before she slept. Not that she was going to spoil the
  scheme that was forming in her mind by any foolish haste.</p>

  <p>The chance came presently, when the dancing couple parted and the
  fair-haired child passed directly in front of Cleopatra.</p>

  <p>"Cora," the film star cooed gently. "It is Cora, isn't it? Yes, of course.
  What are you doing here?"</p>

  <p>The girl flushed and smiled, flattered by the attention she had never
  hoped to gain from so great a personage as the leading lady in the Colidrome
  revue. Some day she was going to be a Cleopatra herself, but that was a long
  way off, and, meanwhile, she was no more than an extremely pretty little girl
  in the back row of the chorus. She had never spoken to Cleopatra before, nor
  had she hoped for such an honour. But here it was now, and she was going to
  make the best of it. There were other members of the company on the dancing
  floor who would notice and envy Cora her little moment of triumph.</p>

  <p>"Yes, Madame Cleopatra," she said meekly. "You see, I had a ticket given
  me. I have never been here before and I could not afford to come on my own,
  anyway."</p>

  <p>"What a shame," Cleopatra smiled. "My dear child, come and sit down by me.
  I am not in a dancing mood to-night, and I can't be bothered with people.
  That is why I am sitting here all alone when I ought to be comfortably in
  bed."</p>

  <p>This was Cleopatra in her most gracious and kindly mood, and the little
  chorus girl appreciated it accordingly. She slipped timidly into her seat and
  waited.</p>

  <p>"Take a cigarette," Cleopatra said in her kindliest manner. "I am not
  going to offer you anything to drink, because I don't believe in young girls
  doing that sort of thing. I have many failings, my dear, but one of them is
  not drinking between meals. If you take my advice, you will never give way to
  that sort of thing. You are a very beautiful child, but your beauty is rather
  of a frail nature so that you will have to be exceedingly careful if you
  don't want to lose it. Let me tell you that beauty is the finest asset a
  woman can possess. Never mind about brains, my dear, they don't count on the
  variety stage, and they count still less on the screen. And that is where
  your future lies, unless I am greatly mistaken. Yours is a perfect screen
  face. You ought to be earning at least a hundred pounds a week."</p>

  <p>"Oh, how kind of you," the girl said, flushing rosy red under this stream
  of compliments. "But no one seems to trouble anything about me, and I can't
  push myself."</p>

  <p>"No, yours is not the type that does. You want some one like myself to
  take a motherly interest in you. You must come round and have tea with me say
  to-morrow afternoon at 4 o'clock. I will get a man to meet you who will put
  you in the right way. If he is attracted, then he will see that you have all
  you require and&mdash;but perhaps I am putting foolish ideas into your head.
  Anyway, don't fail to come round to-morrow afternoon."</p>

  <p>Cora murmured her thanks as best she could. Already she was beginning to
  see visions of future glory.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you need not thank me," Cleopatra said. "It is a pleasure. And now I
  am going to say something serious to you. Don't you think you are rather
  foolish to let men give you jewellery?"</p>

  <p>"I don't quite understand," the girl stammered.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I think you do. Now, though you may not think it, it is quite
  plain to me that you made your own frock. It is a very pretty frock, and
  reflects great credit on you, but any woman in my position would recognise it
  for home-made at once. And your stockings are not real silk, neither did you
  buy your shoes in Bond-street. And yet you are wearing a diamond which is
  obviously of very considerable value."</p>

  <p>"But indeed it isn't mine," the girl protested. "I know it is a great
  stone because the man who lent it me told me so. And I believe there is a
  private detective in the room at the present moment seeing that I come to no
  harm. Just for once in my life I wanted to&mdash;to&mdash;well cut a dash. I
  wanted to impress all the other girls when I came down to the theatre
  to-night. But at the last moment I hadn't the courage to wear it, and I only
  slipped it on when I got here. Isn't is lovely?"</p>

  <p>"It is indeed," Cleopatra agreed. "Won't you take me into your confidence,
  and tell me where you got it from?"</p>

  <p>The younger woman fell into the trap.</p>

  <p>"You swear you won't tell anyone?" Cora said in her absolutely childish
  way. "There is a gentleman who is very fond of me."</p>

  <p>"And you are fond of him, eh?"</p>

  <p>"Well, no," Cora said with round eyes. "I don't think I am. He is not a
  Christian to begin with. And he is small and thin, and has a horrible hooked
  nose. He is dreadfully rich. Now, what would you do, Madame Cleopatra, if you
  were me? I am all alone in the world, with nothing to live on except the few
  shillings a week I get in the chorus. Sometimes when I have clothes to buy I
  hardly have enough to eat. It is all very well for you to talk about what
  might happen in the future," the girl went on with a touch of worldly
  shrewdness, "but then, you never know. It might be years before I earn the
  salary you were talking about just now. And I am not quite sure that the man
  does actually want to marry me. Still, he is infatuated, if you know what I
  mean, and ready to do anything for me."</p>

  <p>"I am not surprised," Cleopatra smiled. "But what has all this got to do
  with that big diamond?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am coming to that. He was telling me all about a wonderful stone
  that had come into his hands in the course of business. He told me that the
  night of the day when he got the stone, in fact, he showed it to me when we
  were having tea together. And he asked me if I would like to have it. Of
  course, I said yes. And then something put it in my mind to try and see if he
  was really in earnest. I said if he really cared for me he would not mind
  lending me the diamond to wear for just one night. Also, I told him if he
  didn't I would never speak to him again. And then I realised my power over
  him. It's a lovely thing when a girl finds that she can do anything with a
  man, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"So I realised years ago," Cleopatra said archly. "But, go on, my dear. I
  am most interested."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, Mr. Putress&mdash;did I say his name was Ben
  Putress?&mdash;said I could have the stone for this evening, if I didn't mind
  one of his men following me about. And that is all."</p>

  <p>Cleopatra listened smilingly as if she were faintly interested. She knew
  the name of Putress well enough as that pleasure-loving young man who some
  day would be the head of one of the greatest financial firms in the world.
  But she did not say so. She merely held out her hand and asked to see the
  diamond. When she had it in her grasp, she dropped it coolly into her
  bag.</p>

  <p>"I will take care of this," she said. "Now, don't make a fuss. If you
  attempt to create a scene I shall tell everybody the story you have just told
  me. You may not believe it, but that big diamond is mine and I have no
  intention of parting with it. Now, what are you going to do&mdash;call the
  management and start a flaming scandal or take it quietly? Because, if you
  don't, you will regret it till the last hour of your life."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch23">CHAPTER XXIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">HAD Cleopatra only realised the damning evidence that Bliss
had left in
  his desk for Morrit to find in the shape of the receipt for the pledging of
  the King Diamond and how that same sheet of paper was destined to be used
  within a space that might be measured by hours, she would have hesitated
  before she adopted those tactics with the little chorus girl. She would have
  waited for a less hazardous opportunity. As it was, she glanced at Cora to
  see if she would put up anything in the nature of a fight.</p>

  <p>But there was no spirit of combat in Cora for the moment. She was borne
  down by sheer weight of metal.</p>

  <p>"This is dreadful," she murmured with gathering tears. "I don't know what
  to do. I don't even know whether to believe you or not. I shall go to
  gaol."</p>

  <p>"You will do nothing of the kind, you silly child," Cleopatra smiled.
  "Tell that little Jew boy exactly what has happened and he will take it lying
  down. At least he will not blame you&mdash;much. If he turns nasty, send him
  to me. He has got to see me in any case, and the sooner the better."</p>

  <p>Cora abandoned the hopeless encounter. Cleopatra seemed to be such a
  towering force with that majestic beauty of hers and the calm assumption of
  one who regards mere man as an instrument of her sovereign will. The thought
  of creating a scene there was one that Cora's timid soul shrank from. She was
  not without native shrewdness and audacity, but she had not yet reached the
  time when she could rely upon her personal fascination to help her out in
  moments of spectacular trouble.</p>

  <p>"I think you are very unkind," she whimpered. "And suppose you are telling
  me lies?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I am telling you no lies," Cleopatra said with some toleration. "Why
  should I? If this were a case of sheer robbery you would only have to call up
  that detective man and give me in custody. Then I should spend a very
  unpleasant night in the police cell and probably end up by getting six months
  for an impudent attempt at robbery. As a matter of fact, this stone really
  belongs to me, and Mr. Putress will probably admit it. He won't resign
  himself to the loss uncomplainingly, but I think you can leave me to deal
  with him. Are you going to stay here or would you like to come with me as far
  as my flat?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't," Cora bleated. "I am so dreadfully distressed, I don't
  know what to do or think."</p>

  <p>Cleopatra rose leisurely to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," she said. "And mind, I meant every word I said just now
  as to your future. On the whole, perhaps you had better not come round
  to-morrow afternoon. Let us say next Monday, when I may have some good news
  for you."</p>

  <p>With that, Cleopatra moved off, leaving the little chorus girl in an
  agitated state of mind. She did not know what to do or what to think, and
  above all things she shrank from creating a scene in a place where she had
  never been before. She would go straight away to her own humble quarters, and
  there think out what was to be done for the best. As she passed out of the
  dancing room into a hall a heavily-built man in an ill-fitting suit of
  evening clothes accosted her.</p>

  <p>"Beg pardon, miss," he said. "But I suppose you know that the necklace is
  no longer in its place."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know that," Cora contrived to say more or less coherently. "You
  see, I&mdash;I took it off and put it in my bag for safety. I thought
  possibly I might be robbed of it as I was walking borne. It is a fine
  night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is, miss," the detective agreed. "And perhaps you are right to put
  that gem in your bag as you are walking, but I had particular instructions
  not to lose sight of you until you were back home, so you won't mind if I
  follow at a respectful distance. You see, it's the gentleman's orders."</p>

  <p>Cora raised no objection, indeed, she was only too pleased to get off so
  cheaply. She turned presently into the solitary room which she rented in a
  sort of hostel, and there sat down to think over the events of the evening.
  It was not yet late so far as the London social world was concerned, so that
  she made up her mind in a few moments to get Ben Putress on the telephone,
  and inform him what had happened. She knew where he was, she knew he was to
  be found in a big house in the West End where he was attending an evening
  party, so she went down into the hall of the hostel, and, after a great deal
  of trouble, managed to secure Putress's attendance at the other end of the
  wire. She had not given her name, and she could judge by the tone of the
  other's voice that he was not too pleased at this interruption.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said. "Who are you and what do you want? And why didn't you
  give your name to the footman?"</p>

  <p>"It's me, Ben," Cora said in a small voice. "A most dreadful thing has
  happened. I can't tell you what it is now, but I must see you to-morrow.
  Can't we meet somewhere for lunch?"</p>

  <p>Apparently Putress had not grasped the extent of the catastrophe, for the
  suggestion seemed to please him.</p>

  <p>"Oh, very well," he said. "I will be at Mariani's at one o'clock sharp. I
  daresay we shall be able to settle that little bother of yours. Good-night,
  my dear."</p>

  <p>Mariani's was a little place off Regent-street, where the two occasionally
  met, and where they could have a little alcove to lunch all to themselves. It
  was just on the stroke of one when Putress, smart and immaculate as usual,
  swaggered into the place and greeted Cora with an insolent smile.</p>

  <p>"Well, here we are," he said, cheerfully "I 'phoned Mariani this morning
  to give us something special in the way of lunch in the little alcove which,
  no doubt, is awaiting us."</p>

  <p>He led the way to a secluded corner, and presently dismissed the waiter.
  Then he turned almost paternally to Cora.</p>

  <p>"Now then," he said. "What is the trouble? Money, of course. Or have you
  managed to get the sack?"</p>

  <p>"Neither," Cora said. "And if it were money I should not come to you like
  this. I know you would give it to me if I asked, but I shall never do that,
  as you know quite well. It is much worse than that. Far worse."</p>

  <p>Putress changed colour. A dreadful doubt was dawning in his mind, and
  there crept into his eyes a sudden spark of anger that Cora did not fail to
  note.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said harshly. "Let's have the worst. Tell me that you have
  lost that diamond."</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I have done," Cora said, with a sudden spurt of
  bravery. "At least, it was stolen from me. But perhaps I had better tell you
  all about it."</p>

  <p>"It would be just as well," Putress said grimly.</p>

  <p>Thus dubiously encouraged. Cora told her story without omitting a single
  detail. She was surprised and rather pleased to see that Putress was taking
  it so well.</p>

  <p>"And you actually mean to tell me that that woman had the audacity to loot
  the necklace and walk off with it as if it had been a mere bit of glass?" he
  asked. "And what was the man I sent to watch you doing all the time? But, of
  course, you managed to throw dust in his eyes. So Cleopatra says that stone
  belongs to her, does she? She may be telling the truth to a certain extent,
  but the diamond belongs to me. It came into my hands in the ordinary way of
  business, and I was an absolute fool ever to part with it. But then men will
  do these foolish things where women are concerned. Still, we need not go into
  that. I shall come into this business later, but there is something I want
  you to do first. You must go round and see this woman. Go and tell her that I
  bought that diamond, or, at any rate, I advanced money on it, and remind her
  that if I like I can have her arrested at any moment. Tell her she must get
  the stone at once, or I will not answer for the consequences. Then meet me
  here at 5 o'clock for tea, and, if you can't manage to make that woman see
  common sense, then I will tackle her myself."</p>

  <p>Cora was fortunate in finding Cleopatra at home, and, without waste of
  time, told her exactly what had happened in the morning, ending up with a
  request for the stone.</p>

  <p>"My poor dear child," Cleopatra said coolly, "do you suppose that I am
  quite as simple as all that? You go back to young Benjamin and tell him I
  refuse to do anything of the kind. Remind him that if he hadn't been a fool
  this would never have happened. Not that he is as abject an idiot as he
  appears. I suppose you are under the impression that he lent you that diamond
  out of sheer kindness of heart, or because he was so infatuated he could
  refuse you nothing. Nothing of the sort. I know why he lent it to you and I
  shall tell him presently. Go back to him as I suggest and tell him that I
  shall be here till seven o'clock if he wants to see me."</p>

  <p>There was nothing for it but for Cora to retire gracefully and spend a
  miserable afternoon waiting for the moment to arrive when she could see
  Putress again. It was a relief to her that he took her information so calmly.
  He had not the slightest doubt, in his own mind, that once he came face to
  face with Cleopatra the trouble would be settled in a few moments. No woman
  had ever got the best of him yet, and none was likely to, or at least, so, in
  his conceit, he imagined. For Ben Putress was a bit of a lady killer in his
  way and a little apt to forget that the length of his purse and his
  reputation for wealth were powerful factors where the smiles of the fair sex
  were concerned. Not that he underrated that advantage, still they were not
  everything and, hitherto, he had had no cause to change his opinion as
  regarded his own personal charm.</p>

  <p>"You are not very angry with me?" Cora pleaded.</p>

  <p>"Well, I suppose I am not," he admitted. "You are such a dear, sweet,
  fascinating little thing that no man could possibly be angry with you for
  long. You know that there is nothing in the world I would not do for you and,
  after all, that business last night was sheer highway robbery."</p>

  <p>"Will it be a very serious loss to you?" Cora asked.</p>

  <p>"It is not going to be any loss to me at all," Putress boasted. "Of
  course, you realise that I don't want anything in the way of publicity. No
  scandal or talk or anything that is likely to get into the papers. And, above
  all, no police proceedings. Cleopatra bluffed you out of that necklet and I
  am going to bluff her. After all, I don't mind admitting that I am the party
  who is most to blame, because I ought never to have listened to what you had
  to say. I only brought that necklet to show you, because you are so fond of
  pretty trifles, but when you pleaded so nicely and you were so sweet to me, I
  hadn't the heart to refuse you. And that is how the whole trouble came about.
  But I can assure you, my dear, that Cleopatra is going to find me quite a
  different proposition. Now, wipe your eyes and come along and have your tea
  and try and forget all about it."</p>

  <p>Cora was only too pleased to let it go at that. She had expected a
  different reception altogether, but now the thing had been taken out of her
  own hands and concerned her no longer.</p>

  <p>"You are awfully good, Ben," she said gratefully. "And I shan't forget it.
  China tea for you, isn't it?"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch24">CHAPTER XXIV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">MEANWHILE, Cleopatra was awaiting Putress's call. She had
no doubt
  whatever that he would come round and see her and she would be ready for him
  when the fateful moment arrived. All the same, she wanted an hour or two to
  herself to settle her plan of campaign. She knew the type of man she had to
  deal with, she knew his tenacious nature and what a fight he would put up for
  the recovery of the King Diamond. But she had not the least intention of
  parting with it, knowing full well that Putress valued his newly acquired
  social status too highly to take any steps that were likely to lead to
  publicity.</p>

  <p>And there was another thing&mdash;by her own cleverness she had
  overreached herself. She had told Paradine only half the truth when she said
  that the King Diamond had been stolen from her flat by some unknown burglar
  whose operations she had actually watched whilst, all the time, she had the
  stone in her possession. She had taken it in a light-hearted spirit of
  adventure to Bliss, who had raised the necessary funds upon it with which to
  carry the flag flying in her campaign of speculation. She had never guessed
  for a moment that she had placed herself and her financial affairs in the
  hands of a scoundrel who was up to his neck in crime and duplicity and one
  who, moreover, was actually on the verge of flight. It angered Cleopatra
  almost to madness to think that, with all her cleverness and cunning, she had
  been an innocent tool in this man's hands, and had actually provided him with
  the means of getting out of the country. She almost wished now that he had
  got out of the country, beyond the reach of the police, because in that case
  a great many awkward questions looming ominously on the horizon would not
  have required an answer. So far as she knew Paradine had guessed nothing of
  actual events and so long as the missing diamond could not be traced to Bliss
  by the police then she was comparatively safe.</p>

  <p>She did not anticipate for a moment that Putress would consult Scotland
  Yard even if she managed to call his bluff in connection with the ravished
  stone. On the whole, therefore, it seemed as if the matter would be entirely
  between Putress and herself.</p>

  <p>She smiled as the maid announced Mr. Benjamin Putress.</p>

  <p>"Ask him in," she said.</p>

  <p>"Ah, Mr. Putress, we have never had the pleasure of meeting before, but I
  know a great deal about you. A patron of the theatre, I think. Am I wrong in
  supposing that you are behind the new show at the Jollity?"</p>

  <p>Putress bowed in his very best fashion.</p>

  <p>"Don't you think that sort of talk is a little beside the mark?" he asked.
  "And may I remind you this is no ordinary afternoon call? All that society
  chatter is very well in its way, but I am not, for the moment at any rate, a
  young man about town, who has dropped in to discuss Shakespeare and the
  musical glasses with that famous film star, Madame Cleopatra."</p>

  <p>"Oh, just as you like," Cleopatra smiled sweetly. "If you prefer
  bludgeons, I am quite agreeable. Personally, I have a weakness for the
  fencing-foils myself. More in the spirit of comedy, don't you think? But be
  as candid as you please, I am quite used to it. I wasn't always in my present
  position."</p>

  <p>"So I understand," Putress said with a sneer.</p>

  <p>"No," Cleopatra went on, quite unperturbed. "I was once a bare-footed
  child, hardly knowing where to turn for a meal. But it was good training. It
  taught me what the world was worth, and how to estimate miserable little rats
  like yourself at their proper value. Now, go on, the next blow is yours. Hit
  as hard as you like, I shan't mind."</p>

  <p>"So be it," Putress grinned. "Now, would you be good enough to return to
  me the diamond that you stole last night?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Cleopatra smiled. "I suppose it was a theft in a way. But the
  stone doesn't belong to you."</p>

  <p>"The law would take a different view."</p>

  <p>"Would it? I am not worrying about what the law thinks. The stone is mine.
  I gave it to Mr. Bliss because he told me that if I didn't find ten thousand
  pounds at once I should lose every penny I had invested in the city. Of
  course, I didn't know at the time that he was simply robbing me and using my
  jewel to raise funds for fleeing the country. He came to you, knowing that it
  was the most likely quarter in which he could obtain what he needed. But he
  didn't sell you the stone."</p>

  <p>"That is true enough," Putress was fain to admit. "He pledged it for the
  amount in question."</p>

  <p>"Yes, which is about a fiftieth of its value. I suppose if I said nothing
  and Bliss had said nothing when he came for trial you would have observed
  absolute silence, and congratulated yourself upon doing a very fine
  deal."</p>

  <p>This arrow was so near the mark that Putress could only accept it in
  silence. Such a thought had occurred to him, but he had not expected that
  Cleopatra would see it so shrewdly.</p>

  <p>"You admit that," the woman went on. "I suppose some evidence exists
  somewhere to show the contract. But we need not worry about that for the
  moment. You were so pleased with your bargain and so much in love with that
  stone that you felt bound to show it to Cora Lee. Why did you show it to
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, well, I thought it would please the child. Like all the rest of your
  sex, she adores jewellery."</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the kind," Cleopatra flared up. "You wanted to dazzle that
  poor little soul. You dangled it before her eyes as evidence of what you
  could give her if she only said the word. And that simple child actually
  thinks you want to marry her."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps she is right," Putress retorted.</p>

  <p>"And perhaps she is wrong&mdash;in fact, I am sure she is. You are nothing
  but a miserable philanderer, a Jew Faust playing up to your own
  Mepbistopheles. Oh, I know you and all your tribe. I have not lived all these
  years in a hard, struggling world for nothing. She is a dear child, and she
  will go a long way if she gets in the proper hands. And some day, probably
  she will make a brilliant marriage. But, never as Mrs. Benjamin Putress. I
  dare say she thinks I treated her very badly last night, and so I did. But
  there is something about her that appeals to me, and I am going to see that
  she has her fair chance. I dare say you are very fond of her, I dare say you
  even think you are in love with her. But not in a way any decent girl has a
  right to expect. You made an utter fool of yourself when you lent her that
  diamond, and now you are going to pay for your folly."</p>

  <p>"You mean you refuse to give it up," Putress demanded.</p>

  <p>"Decidedly so. You are wasting your time."</p>

  <p>"No, I am not," Putress snarled. "I can have you arrested. I can go to the
  authorities straight from here and lay information against you. You shall
  know what it is to spend at least one night in gaol. Come, hand it over."</p>

  <p>Cleopatra lay back in her chair and laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear fool," she said. "Do you think you are going to bluff me like
  that? You dare not take proceedings. You dare not let the world know that the
  great firm of Putress and Co. are not above acting as pawnbrokers. And you
  dare not let the world know that you have been insane enough to trust one of
  the most valuable gems in the world in the custody of a little chorus girl so
  that she could wear it at a night club. No, because that would mean a lovely
  scandal for the cheap Press. And what would Lady Edna Wickenstead say when it
  came to her ears."</p>

  <p>"What has she to do with it?" Putress stammered.</p>

  <p>"Well, aren't you going to marry her? Yes, I know it is a secret up to
  now, but one of the little birds who carry such things whispered it in my
  ear. You are going to found a family, you are going to regild the ancient
  coronet of the Marquess of Stainforth. And in a generation or so people will
  forget that the man who calls himself Ben Putress to-day is the same Angus
  Montagu who married into that distinguished family. Alas, for the hopes of
  poor little Cora Lee."</p>

  <p>"And that is your last word?" Putress said.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. And another thing. You won't lose much by keeping your mouth
  shut. Which is best, to have a blazing scandal or lose ten thousand pounds?
  Oh, come, my dear little man, I don't think you are going to hesitate."</p>

  <p>Apparently Putress was not, for he left the flat a few minutes later,
  absolutely downcast and crestfallen and consumed by an impotent rage that
  almost choked him. Cleopatra had beaten him all along the line and it
  positively hurt him to acknowledge the fact. From one of the windows of her
  sitting-room, Cleopatra watched him dejectedly walking down the street, then
  she threw herself into her chair and lighted a cigarette.</p>

  <p>So that was that, she told herself. She had emerged triumphantly from a
  very tight corner, she had recovered her precious diamond, and, best of all,
  no awkward questions were likely to be asked. She had utterly fooled Carl
  Zambra and now found herself in the possession of a gem which was, in itself,
  worth a fortune. The great mansion was not very far off.</p>

  <p>She was still contemplating this rosy picture when there came another
  interruption in the shape of Inspector Paradine. He would only detain
  Cleopatra for a minute or two if she would be good enough to see him.</p>

  <p>"Ask him to come up at once," she said.</p>

  <p>Paradine came and, without delay, came to the point.</p>

  <p>"I want you to explain one little matter," he said. "You will remember
  telling me all about the robbery here not so very long ago. I mean the loss
  of a valuable diamond. Now, Madame Cleopatra, if you were correct, how do you
  account for the fact that the same stone was subsequently handed over by you
  to Mr. Mark Bliss with the object of raising a large sum of money? As a
  matter of fact, that stone was pledged with Putress and Co., and the receipt
  was found in Mr. Bliss's desk."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch25">CHAPTER XXV</a></h2>

  <p class="first">CLEOPATRA flared out into a tornado of passion. That wild,
ungoverned
  temperament of hers had got the better of her for the moment, and she was
  hardly aware of the fact that she was no longer alone in the room.</p>

  <p>"That cursed Zambra," she hissed.</p>

  <p>Then she stopped suddenly. In a flash, she had herself in hand again and
  was smiling into Paradine's face. He never moved so much as a muscle, and
  outwardly, at any rate, he conveyed the impression that the name of Zambra
  meant nothing to him. But he had not failed to draw his own conclusions.</p>

  <p>"Hadn't you better sit down," Cleopatra said in her sweetest manner. "It
  is very good of you to take all this trouble over that wretched affair of
  mine, but I dare say I have only myself to blame. If I were you I should
  think no more about it. Let the diamond go&mdash;I don't want it."</p>

  <p>"That is rather strange," Paradine said. "Great theatrical stars have lost
  jewels before now and occasionally recovered them, but I never knew one who
  let the opportunity pass for obtaining something in the way of an
  advertisement. And besides, madam, you have not answered my question."</p>

  <p>"Really, I don't know what you are talking about," Cleopatra replied. "You
  are not suggesting that I am keeping anything back from you? Why should
  I?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is just what I have to find out," Paradine said.</p>

  <p>"But I don't understand," Cleopatra murmured. "Mr. Bliss? Oh yes, my
  stockbroker. Are you suggesting that I gave him a diamond a few days ago
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"A diamond in a platinum setting, with a thin chain. In fact, just the
  same sort of diamond that was stolen from this flat not so very long ago. You
  gave the gem to Mr. Bliss with a view to raising money on it. I mean that you
  were deeply engaged in Stock Exchange speculations and needed a large sum of
  money, or otherwise you would have been faced with a serious loss. Not to
  make a long story of it, the receipt for the diamond was found in Bliss's
  desk, and it is in my possession."</p>

  <p>Cleopatra lay back in her chair, outwardly calm and smiling in the face of
  her tormentor. She wanted to impress him with the fact that she was not in
  the least disturbed and that she was looking upon this more in the light of a
  pleasant experience than anything else. But all the time her mind was working
  with lightning rapidity. How much did this man know? So far, he was on the
  right track, but whether or not he had found the authority that Cleopatra had
  given Bliss to part with the stone was something that she had yet to
  discover. There was only one way for it, and that to bluff. And if Paradine
  finally cornered her, then she would admit that she had been merely amusing
  herself at his expense.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know your own business," she said. "But don't you think you
  are adopting a strange method in dealing with one who is practically your
  client. You actually believe that I gave Mr. Bliss a diamond to pawn?"</p>

  <p>"I came here with that impression," Paradine said guardedly.</p>

  <p>"Then, my dear good Inspector, you are absolutely wrong," Cleopatra lied
  boldly. "I did nothing of the kind. If I had done so, why should I make a
  mystery of it? Oh, I see what is passing through your mind. You have
  discovered the fact that I have had considerable dealings on the Stock
  Exchange, and that Mr. Bliss was my broker. I have never made a secret of the
  fact. And I dare say that, on going through that unfortunate individual's
  papers, you have come across a record of my transactions. But let me ask you
  one very pertinent question. Now, if I had done as you say and the diamond
  had been pawned, no doubt you know where it was pledged. In other words,
  Inspector Paradine, where is the diamond ornament you speak about?"</p>

  <p>For a moment Paradine was utterly at a loss for a reply. It was all very
  well to say that it had been traced to Mark Putress, but then that individual
  was emphatic in his declaration that the diamond had been lost, and Paradine
  saw no reason to doubt the truth of that statement. The firm of Putress and
  Co. was of too high a repute to be suspected of anything in the way of pure
  business chicanery. It appeared to be perfectly true that Putress had dropped
  the stone out of his pocket, or it had been extracted by some clever thief,
  and Paradine had accepted the statement without the slightest hesitation.
  There was nothing for it, therefore but to prevaricate for the moment.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that is a comparatively important point," he said. "I don't know
  where the diamond is, but I shall know before very long."</p>

  <p>"And suppose I deny that it is mine?"</p>

  <p>Paradine felt himself lifted on surer ground now. Without knowing exactly
  what she was doing, Cleopatra had opened another line of argument
  altogether.</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose I should have to believe you," Paradine smiled. "But then
  you see, madam, it is our business not to believe any statement unless we
  have absolute proof of it. Now, let me tell you a little story, or shall we
  say a little parable. There was once an exceedingly clever woman who obtained
  a valuable piece of jewellery by illicit means. I don't suppose you have ever
  read a story by a writer called Edgar Allen Poe, which story was called 'The
  Purloined Letter.'"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I have," Cleopatra smiled. "I am passionately fond of
  sensational fiction, and there are few writers of that class whose works are
  not familiar to me. But go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, this woman was a famous actress in her way. She managed to get hold
  of that piece of jewellery, knowing full well that she would have to return
  it sooner or later, which was the very last thing in the world she wanted to
  do. So she adopted a very pretty little scheme. She hadn't much time to do it
  in, but just sufficient if she did not waste her opportunities. So she went
  over to Paris with that gem in her possession and had it faithfully copied in
  paste by a famous firm. I know all this because I had the case in hand
  myself. When she came back she had two gems in similar settings, one genuine
  and the other false. When the time came, she handed over the false to its
  owner and kept the original. And you may believe me or not, but it was not
  until the owner had actually died and the necklet went to a famous firm of
  auctioneers that the fraud was discovered. I am not suggesting anything, but
  there is the story."</p>

  <p>Cleopatra was smiling no longer. She was beginning to see now what a force
  she was up against.</p>

  <p>"Very interesting," she said carelessly. "But I don't quite see how it
  applies to the present case."</p>

  <p>"Well, it does, in a way," Paradine smiled. "I am supposing that was what
  happened in the present instance. And, mind you, to-day it is much easier to
  get to Paris and back than it was when my story took place. For instance,
  either of us could fly to Paris and back in the course of a day and no one
  even know we had left the country if we took the proper precautions."</p>

  <p>"A lovely city, I am told," Cleopatra murmured. "I hope to spend a holiday
  there some of these days."</p>

  <p>"By which I infer you have never been to Paris," Paradine said. "In which
  case, you have never heard of an eminent firm of jewellers called Manquet et
  Cie, who have an establishment in the Rue de Calais. They are well-known
  people."</p>

  <p>Paradine had shaken Cleopatra now, though she affected the same easy smile
  and air of bewilderment.</p>

  <p>"So you see how easy it is," Paradine went on casually. "Just to run down
  to Croydon aerodrome one morning, thence across to Paris, and, after a couple
  of hours there, back in London in time for tea. I don't mind telling you that
  on three occasions within the last five or six weeks a certain film star was
  not at Walton-on-Thames, in the studio of the Umpire United Film Company,
  when she was supposed to be there. Also, it is not difficult to obtain
  information with regard to passengers from Croydon to Paris. We have an
  understanding with the authorities there, because we recognised from the
  first how this aviation business would play into the hands of certain clever
  criminals. Now my suggestion is that the trick I told you about had been
  played in the case of the missing diamond."</p>

  <p>"What," Cleopatra cried. "You dare to insinuate that I made a fugitive
  visit to Paris, and called on the firm you mention with the intention of
  getting a copy of the necklace made!"</p>

  <p>"I have not said so," Paradine remarked coolly. "I wonder if you have
  heard of a great French aristocrat called the Marquise de Cavaliera? She is a
  very great lady, and she lives on her own estates somewhere in Brittany."</p>

  <p>"Oh, indeed," Cleopatra murmured.</p>

  <p>"Yes. And she is supposed to have called on Marquet et Cie to have certain
  stones copied. At least, that is my information. But when the Paris police
  came to inquire a couple of days ago at my request, they discovered that the
  Marquise has been at her villa in Algiers for the last six months. She
  certainly called upon the firm of jewellers, or, at least, somebody more or
  less disguised as her did. Unfortunately for the masquerader, she was wearing
  a peculiar ring in the form of an emerald snake by which we hope to identify
  her. Just such a ring madam, as you are wearing at the present moment."</p>

  <p>Paradine said no more. Indeed, there was no occasion for him to speak, for
  Cleopatra's face and the way in which she tried to hide her left hand was
  eloquent testimony enough to the fact that Paradine's words had shaken her to
  her soul.</p>

  <p>She looked up suddenly with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Ah, you are too clever for me altogether," she said. "Perhaps I had
  better tell you the truth. I got that stone from a friend of mine some weeks
  back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Shall we call him Zambra?" Paradine suggested.</p>

  <p>"You really are a wonderful man," Cleopatra said admiringly. "I suppose
  you know all about Zambra?"</p>

  <p>"Well, practically. That is, if anybody does know all about an
  international criminal of that type. As a matter of fact, the South African
  police are after him at the present moment. But I beg your pardon, I am
  interrupting you."</p>

  <p>"Well, Zambra gave me the diamond," Cleopatra went on. "At least, I
  wheedled it out of him. If you want to know where he obtained it, I will tell
  you. It was stolen from the Maggersfont mine by a native named
  M'Papo&mdash;the man who mysteriously died at a place called Ravenswood not
  so very long ago. But I dare say you know all about that."</p>

  <p>Paradine nodded curtly and Cleopatra resumed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I won't waste your time. You see, Zambra is infatuated with me, and
  I can twist him round my little finger. He told me all about that stone which
  was going to make our fortunes and I got him to have it cut in
  Amsterdam."</p>

  <p>"I can guess where," Paradine remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well, the stone was cut and handed over to my care. It was only lent,
  mind you. I wanted to wear it in the first night of my show at the Colidrome,
  and I did. And then the thought came to me that I might keep it altogether if
  I wanted to, because I don't mind telling you that I hadn't the faintest
  intention of marrying Zambra. Moreover, I told you a lie just now when said I
  had never been in Paris. I know the city intimately. And that is why I went
  there by aeroplane, taking the necklet with me and had a copy made. I did
  pose as the Marquise, because I was not taking any risks and if I hadn't been
  fool enough to wear this emerald ring, I should have got away with it.
  However, I was a fool, and I am going to pay for my folly. A week or so later
  I crossed to Paris again in the same way and came back with the real necklet
  and the imitation in my possession. I did that to deceive Zambra. And it did
  deceive him, too. At the present moment, he doesn't know what to think, and I
  don't mind telling you that when he burgled my flat that night and got away
  with the sham stone I recognised him though I told you before that I didn't.
  And that is the truth, Inspector."</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure of it," Paradine said with an air of conviction. "If you
  had told me that before it would have saved me a great deal of trouble, and
  saved you probably from an unpleasant exposure. You see now you will have to
  tell the story in an open court, which you will find most trying."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't think, I shall," Cleopatra said flippantly. "It will make a
  topping advertisement and mean that I shall be able to demand my own figure
  when I go over to Hollywood. They are not so particular there as they are in
  London."</p>

  <p>Paradine went his way presently, on the whole not disappointed with the
  result of his visit. He was on the track of the truth now, though he was
  bound to confess that he was just as far off the recovery of the King Diamond
  as ever. Not that he was worrying much about that, because it was more Bly's
  business than his own. But he had established a strong connecting link
  between the great stone and the man Carl Zambra. Here was, at any rate, the
  shadow of motive for the murder of Sir Hercules Slaney. No doubt that crime
  had been the direct result of a desire on Zambra's part to keep the proceeds
  of the diamond to himself. Meanwhile, he would keep a close eye upon that
  cunning criminal.</p>

  <p>Still, Paradine was ignorant of one outstanding fact, and that was that
  the diamond, the genuine diamond, was actually still in Cleopatra's
  possession. And Cleopatra, at that moment, was chuckling to herself and happy
  in the knowledge that at last she had successfully hidden the treasure.</p>

  <p>In ignorance of this, Paradine went his way, though he was certain enough
  of the fact that the real diamond had been pledged with Putress and Co. It
  was not humanly possible that Ben Putress with his intimate knowledge of
  precious stones could be deceived by a counterfeit, though where the stone
  was at the present moment was a mystery with which Paradine was not
  particularly concerned. His chief object in life just now was to lay Zambra
  by the heels.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch26">CHAPTER XXVI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">STILL, from a strictly legal point of view, that was more
easily said than
  done. He might arrest Zambra on a charge of burglary at Cleopatra's flat, but
  there were many and obvious reasons why he should not adopt such a course at
  the present moment. He felt in the back of his mind that Zambra was
  responsible for the death of Sir Hercules Slaney, but in the face of the
  evidence of the two porters in Devonshire Mansions such a line of action
  might defeat its own ends. He knew all about the ciphers in the agony column
  of 'The Times,' and that Zambra and Sir Hercules had met in the lounge of the
  Hotel Legation on that fatal Monday night. But this was not sufficient.</p>

  <p>The two men had parted at the end of an hour, apparently on terms of
  friendship, and Sir Hercules had walked home to his flat in the best of
  health and spirits, after which he had closed and secured the outer door
  behind him. There was no getting away from the evidence of the two porters
  that nobody had been near Sir Hercules after 9 o'clock on the Monday night,
  and that there was no one in the flat when the door was forced on the
  following morning. Moreover, the lock and bolts were intact. In the face of
  evidence like this it was hard to know what to do for the best. And yet
  Paradine did not doubt that there had been foul play of some kind. It was the
  most baffling and mysterious case that he had come across in the course of
  his career.</p>

  <p>There was only one thing to do now, and that was to see Ben Putress again.
  Possibly he might have something to say that would shed a light on the
  missing diamond. Perhaps he was telling only half the truth, in which case a
  little judicious bullying might lead to a definite result.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Putress," Paradine said when he had cornered the latter in his
  office, "I want to speak to you very seriously indeed. Without betraying
  official secrets, I may tell you that that diamond which has been the cause
  of so much unpleasantness is closely bound up with the death of Sir Hercules
  Slaney. Yes, I know he was supposed to have committed suicide by poisoning
  himself with arsenic, but we have reasons to believe otherwise. And if the
  truth ever comes out, which it probably will, then the story of that diamond
  and the part it played in the murder will have to be told. This will mean, of
  course, that you will be dragged into it. I need not remind you how
  unpleasant it will be for you. Your name will be in all the
  papers&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"No, but it must not be," Putress cried in panic. "That must never be.
  There are reasons."</p>

  <p>"Yes, so I anticipated," Paradine said dryly. "And I suppose a certain
  noble lady is one of them. Now, if you will genuinely help me to trace the
  lost diamond, then I will promise you that your name shall not appear."</p>

  <p>Whereupon Putress made a clean breast of it. He told Paradine how he had
  taken the stone with the intention of dazzling the little chorus girl and how
  he had allowed himself to be persuaded to lend it to her for one evening.
  Then he went on to describe the pitiful story that Cora Lee had poured into
  his ear after that night at the Babylon Club.</p>

  <p>"Ah, now we shan't be very long," Paradine said. "It is a great pity you
  didn't tell me this before, because it would have saved a good deal of
  unnecessary trouble. If you will give me the address of your little actress
  friend, I will go round to her and hear her side of the business. But one
  thing I must impress upon you, Mr. Putress. Not a word of this must pass your
  lips. I will impress the same thing upon Miss Lee. I want you both to behave
  as if nothing had happened, and let Cleopatra imagine that she has got away
  with the plunder and I will see that she hands it over to the proper quarter
  when the time comes."</p>

  <p>Paradine went away, leaving Putress looking very small and foolish but, at
  the same time, considerably easier in his mind. If the worst came to the
  worst, the firm would have to pay, but the firm could stand that and anything
  was better than a public scandal for an ambitious young man who was just
  beginning to climb his way into really exalted society.</p>

  <p>It was quite an easy job that Paradine had with Cora Lee. He had only to
  proclaim his name and business to have her sobbing bitterly as she told all
  that happened on that dramatic evening in the Babylon Club. Her tale was so
  straightforward and convincing that Paradine believed every word of it.</p>

  <p>"I hope this will be a lesson to you," he said in conclusion. "Now, there
  is one thing you must do, or rather, one thing you must not do. You must not
  say a word of this to anybody. Go on as if nothing had happened and if you
  meet Cleopatra, behave to her just as usual. That is all."</p>

  <p>It was an hour or two later that Lionel Bly walked into Paradine's office
  at Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>"Well, is there any further news," he asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, quite a lot," Paradine said. "Not that I am much further with regard
  to the Slaney business, but I do know where the missing diamond is, and all
  the mysterious adventures that stone has had during the last few weeks."</p>

  <p>"The deuce you do," Bly said. "Have you got it?"</p>

  <p>"No, I haven't," Paradine said. "But Cleopatra has."</p>

  <p>"What, again?" Bly exclaimed. "That is a most amazing woman. Tell me all
  about it."</p>

  <p>Paradine related the story of the last few days, to which Bly listened
  with close attention. At any rate, they knew where the stone was now and
  where to put their hands upon it when the psychological moment arrived.</p>

  <p>"I think we can leave it where it is," Bly said. "Now, what about the
  Slaney side of the business? Have I convinced you at last that the poor old
  man was murdered?"</p>

  <p>"I am coming round to that view," Paradine confessed. "So much so that I
  am seriously contemplating taking out a warrant for Zambra's arrest on the
  off-chance of forcing a confession out of him. There is plenty of evidence to
  justify me in so doing. But where is the proof and how was it done?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know, but I almost think I can tell you," Bly said. "I have been
  talking the matter over with a medical friend of mine and he has given me
  some startling information. And yet quite a simple solution of the problem. I
  suppose there is no chance of us being overheard here."</p>

  <p>Paradine gave the desired assurance and Bly spoke earnestly for a few
  crisp moments. Then Paradine jumped to his feet and smote his flat vigorously
  on the table.</p>

  <p>"The very thing," he cried. "You've got it! There is only one link and we
  ought to be able to supply that. I will take out a warrant for Zambra's
  arrest this very afternoon."</p>

  <p>But though Paradine duly carried out his decision and obtained his warrant
  in the course of an hour or so, seek high, seek low, Zambra was nowhere to be
  found.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch27">CHAPTER XXVII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">THERE was no question that Zambra had vanished in a neat
and artistic
  manner which left Paradine fairly guessing. Probably the man had slipped out
  of the country by some obscure route. Jersey for example; at any rate he was
  nowhere to be found, and the authorities were left to make the best of the
  problem. So far as Paradine could see, there was no reason whatever why
  Zambra should disappear just at that particular moment. Indeed, on the
  contrary, he had every inducement to remain in England, because Paradine
  could not see a criminal of Zambra's type quietly allowing the King Diamond
  to remain in Cleopatra's possession. There was no process out against him
  either, and it was impossible that Zambra could have had even the smallest
  inkling of the net which the police were busily engaged in weaving around
  him.</p>

  <p>Possibly if Paradine had gone to Cleopatra, she might have told him
  something useful. On the other hand, again, she might not. Paradine was
  shrewd enough to see that it was greatly to Cleopatra's interest to have
  Zambra out of the way. She had got the King Diamond back with every intention
  of keeping it. And so long as Zambra was hanging about, there was always a
  chance of her failing to retain her hold on the treasure. But if she could
  once drive Zambra out of the country and make it too hot to hold him, then
  she could snap her fingers at the master criminal so long as she remained in
  England. It was just likely, with her intimate knowledge, that she had
  dropped a hint to somebody of whom Zambra stood in mortal dread and thus
  force him to seek shelter and safety a long way off.</p>

  <p>And in this Paradine was not far wrong. Cleopatra, happy in the knowledge
  that she had regained possession of the great stone, and feeling that nobody
  would ever learn how she had achieved the desired end, had not failed to
  realise the peril in which she stood so long as Zambra remained in London.
  With her intimate knowledge of his past, it was not difficult for her to drop
  a hint in a certain quarter which she proceeded to do by means of an
  anonymous letter. She knew that within an hour or two the information would
  be conveyed to certain people in London who were in touch with the South
  African police, and, once this was done, she felt easier in her mind.</p>

  <p>She had little or no ready money and her salary was already more or less
  mortgaged. But on the other hand, she had the King Diamond, so that the loss
  of all the cash invested in city speculations was a matter of no great
  moment. She had rid herself of the peril that hung over her, so she put
  Zambra out of her mind with an easy conscience. She had done with him for
  ever and hoped that she might never hear of him again.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Zambra had had a warning from another and altogether unexpected
  quarter. It so happened that about the time that Cleopatra had posted her
  anonymous letter, Zambra was partaking of a modest meal in an obscure
  restaurant, which fitted in with his present limited resource's. He had
  nearly finished when a shabby-looking individual slid furtively into the
  place, and came up to the table where the adventurer was seated. Zambra
  looked up with a scowl of anger on his face.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "what do you want? Clear out of this at once. I cannot
  afford to be seen even here with a scarecrow like you. And if you want money,
  Lurcher, you can't have it. You ought to know that you wouldn't find me in a
  place like this if I had as much an a five-pound note in my pocket."</p>

  <p>"Oh, all right," the man addressed as Lurcher said sullenly. "I wouldn't
  have taken the trouble to run you down here if I had not wanted to do you a
  good turn. Now, look here, Zambra, if I give you a piece of valuable
  information, are you prepared to pay for it? If you say you are short of
  money I am sure you are, but you can't be as hard driven as I am. I haven't a
  bean on me or the prospect of a bed to-night. Give me something to eat and a
  sovereign, and I will tell you something you will be glad to know. Leastwise,
  you may not be glad, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, sit down," Zambra growled. "Order what you like. And if you have
  something really good to tell me, then the quid is yours. Now then, get it
  off your chest."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's like this," Lurcher said. "Somebody has given you away. It is
  over that Kimberley business three years ago. The South African police are in
  touch with their agents in London, and within a few hours a warrant will be
  out for your arrest. I only found it out quite by accident, but you can take
  it from me that it is gospel. Now, is that worth a quid?"</p>

  <p>A quarter of an hour later Zambra was on his way to the little hotel where
  he was staying. He paid his bill and had his modest belongings hoisted on to
  a taxi and drove as far as King's Cross Station. There he deposited
  everything but his suitcase in the luggage office, and then, carrying the
  suitcase in his hand, slid modestly out of the station into Grey's Inn Road,
  where he managed to secure a bed and sitting-room. Once having done this, he
  sat down to think things over.</p>

  <p>He had only a few shillings left now, so that the prospect of getting out
  of the country was reduced to vanishing point. He must get money in some way
  or another, and that before many hours had passed over his head. There was a
  certain mysterious individual living at Hampstead who might be good for a
  hundred or so, but the interview with the apparently respectable receiver of
  stolen goods would take time, and time just then was exceedingly precious. He
  could only think of one way out, and that was to seek an interview with
  Cleopatra.</p>

  <p>The more he thought over her, the more deep and bitter did his anger
  become. It seemed to him that he owed most of his misfortunes to his
  connection with the beautiful adventuress, for otherwise he would have been
  out of the country with the King Diamond long ago. He ground his teeth as he
  thought how Cleopatra had fooled him in connection with that valuable gem,
  which he felt sure was still in her possession. True, she had defied him over
  it, but in his hour of desperate need he would not have been particularly
  nice as to how it came back into his custody once more. If he could only get
  Cleopatra quietly by herself, then something might be done.</p>

  <p>The more he brooded over this, the more desperate he grew. In a hastily
  assumed disguise, he spent most of the next day in hanging about the
  neighbourhood of Cleopatra's flat, and asking questions of various people as
  to her movements. Then it seemed as if luck was playing into his hands. It
  was late in the evening when Cleopatra's maid went out, obviously bound for
  some dance, and, therefore, it was not likely that she would return to the
  flat before the small hours of the morning.</p>

  <p>After that began the game of patience. It was just past one o'clock in the
  morning when Cleopatra drove up to the entrance to the flats and ran lightly
  up the stairs. Almost like a shadow Zambra followed her. She was hardly
  inside the door before Zambra had his hand at her throat, and a whisper in
  her ear that if she tried to cry out he would murder her. But Cleopatra was
  not afraid. She managed to switch on the light in the hall and lead the way
  into the sitting-room. There she turned and confronted Zambra, and, for the
  first time in her life, a thrill of genuine alarm shook her from head to
  foot.</p>

  <p>For here was a Zambra she had never seen before. She knew his moods, she
  knew that he would stick at nothing so far as his desires were concerned, and
  she knew, too, that he was as was in her hands. But not the Zambra who was
  looking at her with a glow akin to madness in those dark, sinister eyes of
  his.</p>

  <p>He crossed the room, turned the key in the lock, and dropped it in his
  pocket. Then he proceeded to cut the wires of the telephone before he turned
  and spoke.</p>

  <p>"So I have you to thank for this, you Jezebel," he said in a voice hoarse
  with passion. "Oh, you needn't smile, you know what I mean. There is only one
  person in the world who could have put the police on me over that Kimberley
  affair. I learnt about it last night quite by accident. Now, look here, I
  have no money, a warrant is out for my arrest, I have to get out of the
  country without delay. What are you going to do about it?"</p>

  <p>"You think it is my fault?" Cleopatra asked.</p>

  <p>"I am absolutely sure of it," Zambra said. "And that is why I have been
  dogging your footsteps and watching you for the last twenty-four hours. And
  now I have you to myself, you cold-blooded devil. Where is the diamond you
  robbed me of? Oh, I know you thought you had fooled me with that infernal
  substitute you had made somewhere or another. But I lay low, waiting my time.
  And now that time has come. You have got to give me the diamond and all the
  money you have in the flat as well. Also, a few of your own jewels."</p>

  <p>"And a very nice proposition," Cleopatra laughed. "You have got the
  diamond yourself. You robbed me of it here in the flat. Oh, I recognised you.
  I lay in my bed and laughed when I saw you take that sham from my dressing
  table. And I was so sure of my ground that I put the matter in the hands of
  the police. Do you think I am afraid of you, Carl Zambra?"</p>

  <p>They were brave words, superbly carried through, but for once in her life
  Cleopatra was genuinely alarmed. It was going to take all her charm and all
  her beauty and all her wiles to bring this man grovelling at her feet
  again.</p>

  <p>"It matters very little if you are afraid or not," Zambra said. "I am
  going to have that diamond. And because I can't handle it here in London, you
  are going to give me all the money you have and something I can safely pawn
  into the bargain. Now then, come along. This is business. So far as
  love-making is concerned, you and I have finished."</p>

  <p>"But I have no money to give you," Cleopatra protested. "Honestly, I have
  not five pounds in the world at the present moment. I have spent a whole
  month's salary in advance, and I can't get any more. That is why I went round
  to Attenborough's this afternoon and raised a loan on everything I had. And I
  had to pay all that away at once. If you will wait a week or two I dare say I
  can manage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Zambra burst out in a hoarse laugh.</p>

  <p>"A week or two," he cried. "What is the woman thinking about? Very well,
  give me the diamond."</p>

  <p>"But I haven't got it," Cleopatra protested.</p>

  <p>Zambra strode across the room and took the speaker by the throat. He held
  her until she grew faint and limp and black in the face. Then he flung her on
  one side and stood over her with clenched fists and murder in his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Give it me," he panted. "Give it me, or I will kill you and find it for
  myself. I tell you I am desperate."</p>

  <p>Cleopatra tottered to her feet, beaten at last. From behind a Venetian
  frame over the mantelpiece she took a small morocco case and handed it over
  to Zambra.</p>

  <p>"There, you devil!" she gasped. "Take it."</p>

  <p>Zambra almost tremblingly opened the case and glanced eagerly inside.
  There in its setting lay the King Diamond in all its flashing beauty, once
  more his very own.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch28">CHAPTER XXVIII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was in the daily Press two days later that Bly read all
about the
  mysterious outrage in Cleopatra's flat. The cheaper journals were full of it.
  The famous film star and actress had been followed home by some dangerous
  miscreant, who had forced himself into her presence in the temporary absence
  of her maid, and had compelled her with brutal violence to hand over to him
  certain valuables, including a diamond which the unfortunate woman had
  greatly valued. But, strangely enough, Cleopatra had been unable to give any
  account of her assailant. She had been found lying practically senseless
  within a few moments of the criminal's escape by her maid, who had
  immediately called in the police. And to the authorities Cleopatra had told a
  story of a masked man who was quite a stranger to her.</p>

  <p>All of which Bly read with the greatest interest. He could give a pretty
  shrewd guess as to what had happened, and was sure in his own mind that the
  thief was not masked and that, for some reason best known to herself,
  Cleopatra was desperately anxious that the police should not know who it was
  who had got away with her favourite stone. He did not doubt for a moment that
  it was Zambra himself who had carried out the robbery.</p>

  <p>It was all very disheartening and disappointing and none the less because
  he had regarded the King Diamond as being as good as in his possession. His
  idea had been that when the proper moment came he and Paradine should call
  upon Cleopatra and demand the great stone at her hands. And now it had
  vanished again and might be seen no more. Still, it was plain enough now that
  Zambra was still hiding in London, nor would it be possible for him to raise
  any considerable amount of cash on the elusive gem, because, doubtless, by
  this time, a description of it had been supplied through the 'Police Gazette'
  to every pawnbroker in the metropolis. There was nothing for it, then, but to
  wait in patience until the police could lay their hands upon Zambra, who
  would probably be found with the King Diamond in his possession.</p>

  <p>And, meanwhile, there were other things to do. To begin with, the time had
  come when all the late Sir Hercules's papers and the records of his
  discoveries must be handed over to the learned professor who had undertaken
  to carry on the great work. He was anxiously waiting to take possession of
  the various documents, and Bly had promised to hand them over in the course
  of the next few days. Also, the professor was taking over the flat for the
  time being so that he could carry on his experiments with the rats that
  Slaney had valued so highly.</p>

  <p>It was within an hour or two of reading the sensational story in the daily
  Press that Bly made his way to Devonshire Mansions for a final look round.
  The next morning the learned professor would be in attendance and Bly would
  feel that his side of the task was completed. He let himself into the flat
  with his latchkey and began to look about him. Here were all the papers and
  documents neatly piled with the index on the top of them, here were all the
  costly scientific apparatuses cleaned and polished and ready for immediate
  use. It was only necessary to feed the rather repulsive little rodents and
  then for Bly to turn his back on the flat for the very last time.</p>

  <p>And then, suddenly, he noticed something. The pack of patience cards laid
  out on the little table had vanished. So also had the copies of the 'Times'
  through which he had arrived at the solution of the mysterious ciphers.
  Strange indeed that these had disappeared. It was, of course, just possible
  that Paradine had taken all these proofs away with him, but Bly could not see
  any logical reason for such an act. And if Paradine had not done so, then
  some third person had found his way into the flat and carried the cards and
  papers away.</p>

  <p>But why? Why should any outsider adopt a course like that? Was it possible
  that here was the sinister hand of Zambra once more? Because beyond Paradine
  and Bly himself nobody but Zambra was in the secret of those ciphers. It was
  all very puzzling, but Bly put it out of his mind until he had an opportunity
  of discussing the matter with Paradine himself.</p>

  <p>At the same time this discovery led Bly's thoughts into another channel.
  He was mentally going back over past events, back to that eventful Saturday
  at Ravenswood, when the body of M'Papo had been found in the coppice. In the
  light of recent events it began to be clear that M'Papo had not died by
  accident, indeed, the evidence of the doctor proved that. The man had
  succumbed to a subtle poison, which had been administered to him through some
  mysterious source, but what that source was Bly hesitated to decide. Sir
  Hercules himself, perhaps. No doubt M'Papo had followed Sir Hercules down to
  Ravenswood with the idea of extracting money from him, having come to the end
  of his financial resources. A personal struggle had followed, in which the
  Kafir had suffered severely. But then his injuries had not been sufficient to
  account for his death. Possibly the poison had been administered as M'Papo
  had lain there half stunned in the undergrowth. It was a far-fetched theory,
  but by no means outside the bounds of possibility.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Bly murmured. "I wonder."</p>

  <p>He turned into the late owner's bedroom and threw the contents of the
  wardrobe on the floor. Here was the shabby blue serge suit that Sir Hercules
  had been wearing on the occasion of his visit to Ravenswood. And here in an
  upper waistcoat pocket was a tiny steel tube with a screw top. As Bly very
  carefully twisted the screw apart from the case, he saw that a needle was
  attached to it, a needle not unlike the type used in hypodermic syringes. But
  whether it was hollow or not Bly could not quite make out. The top half of
  the needle was bright as silver, but towards the point it was stained and
  dull, as if a coat of something like varnish had been applied to it. Holding
  this very carefully in his hand, Bly made his way to the little room where
  the rats were running about their cages. One of the tiny creatures whined and
  came scratching at the bars. With the point of the needle Bly pricked the
  rodent lightly on the nose.</p>

  <p>The effect was instantaneous. The rat raced once round the cage, then lay
  down on its side and died. It stiffened perceptibly before Bly's astonished
  eyes. Then as carefully he screwed the cap on the needle again and, leaving
  the flat, made his way without delay in the direction of Scotland Yard.</p>

  <p>He was fortunate enough to find Paradine in. In a few words he told the
  latter exactly what had happened and, at the same time, handed the steel case
  over to him.</p>

  <p>"You had better be careful with that," he suggested. "The point of the
  needle is undoubtedly poisoned, and a sharp prick with it would mean death to
  any man. It ought to be handed over to your scientific investigators."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will see to that," Paradine murmured. "I am rather glad because it
  all helps to clear up the mystery surrounding the King Diamond. And, in any
  case, we know now how M'Papo came by his death. I think your theory is quite
  correct. That man was pestering Sir Hercules for money, and the professor
  coolly got him out of the way through that mysterious poison."</p>

  <p>"No doubt about that," Bly said. "But you won't mind my saying that I am
  not particularly intrigued over my discovery. What I want to do is to find
  that King Diamond."</p>

  <p>"Well, that ought not to be difficult," Paradine said. "We know now where
  the King Diamond is."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you think as I do, then," Bly asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, if you are of the opinion that Cleopatra's murderous assailant was
  Zambra, we are in accord," Paradine replied. "I never doubted it for a
  moment, and that statement about the man being masked was all rubbish.
  Cleopatra knows perfectly well who robbed her, but since she has been robbed
  and she has no chance whatever of getting the King Diamond back again, she is
  not going to make any more trouble for herself by recognising the man who
  assaulted her. She doesn't want to spend days in the police court, and I
  don't blame her. Of course, it is very disappointing to you, because we could
  easily have got the diamond out of Cleopatra when the time came, but we know
  who has it now and it won't be long before we lay him by the heels. One of my
  men thought he had him yesterday in a small lodging-house off the Grey's
  Inn-road. But something alarmed the bird, and he had flown. Still, it is only
  a question of time. We shall have him yet."</p>

  <p>"Ah, that reminds me of something," Bly said.</p>

  <p>Whereupon, he proceeded to tell Paradine the story of the cards and the
  missing copies of 'The Times' newspapers. The inspector listened with a blank
  expression on his face.</p>

  <p>"I know nothing whatever about it," he said. "But it certainly seems as if
  the hand of Zambra is in this. Still, it seems rather impossible that be
  could have got into the flat."</p>

  <p>"It seems hardly possible that he could have murdered Sir Hercules, but he
  did," Bly retorted. "But perhaps you would like to come round to Devonshire
  Mansions and go over the place so as to verify what I say."</p>

  <p>To this suggestion Paradine agreed, though it would be quite late in the
  evening before he was free to get as far as the flat. It was therefore well
  after eleven when he met Bly in the street and the two of them proceeded up
  the stairs and stood outside the front door whilst Bly took out his key.</p>

  <p>Then he stopped suddenly. He laid his hand on Paradine's arm and drew him
  to the top of the stairs again.</p>

  <p>"Do you notice anything?" he whispered. "There is a light in the flat.
  Somebody is inside. Zambra!"</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch29">CHAPTER XXIX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"ZAMBRA!" Paradine exclaimed. "The deuce&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bly drew the speaker a few paces backwards, and pointed to the bottom of
  the doorway. And there, surely enough, was a thin pencil of light showing
  that there was some sort of illumination inside the late professor's
  flat.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see what you mean." Paradine whispered. "Somebody's there at any
  rate. But what makes you think it is Zambra?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, merely because I know something of the man. It is just the sort of
  brilliant inspiration he would have. And where would he be safer? No doubt he
  spotted that he was being shadowed and came here as soon as the coast was
  clear. He could remain hidden in the flat for a day or two and nobody any the
  wiser. Even if either of us had occasion to visit the place, he could bolt
  upstairs into the cistern room and hide there till we had gone. Oh, he is on
  the other side of that door all right, and he will remain until he can obtain
  the necessary money to clear out of the country. And there is another thing,
  Inspector. Zambra has got hold of the King Diamond."</p>

  <p>"We can't prove that, mind you," Paradine said.</p>

  <p>"No, but it is a very fair inference. The man in the mask was Zambra all
  right. Cleopatra knows it. She may think it wise to keep her mouth shut, but
  Zambra managed to get away with the treasure he was seeking, and unless I am
  greatly mistaken, it is in his possession at the present moment."</p>

  <p>"I shouldn't wonder," Paradine agreed. "Yes, it is not so difficult, now I
  come to think of it. Besides, that is a very simple lock on the door, and an
  expert like Zambra could pick it in a few minutes. Come on; let's tackle
  him."</p>

  <p>They advanced to the door of the flat and rang the bell loudly. No
  response came, and suddenly the rim of light under the door vanished,
  Paradine switched back the flap of the letter-box. He stooped with his mouth
  to the opening.</p>

  <p>"No good, my friend," he called. "We know you are there. You might just as
  well open the door and save us the trouble of forcing it. Now, then, hurry
  up."</p>

  <p>In response the hall was flooded with light and the bolts inside the door
  were slowly drawn. Then in the doorway Zambra stood, pale, but showing not
  the least sign of fear.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said coolly. "Well, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>Paradine, followed by Bly, pushed his way inside and closed the door
  behind him.</p>

  <p>"I want you," he said. "In fact, I have a warrant for your arrest in
  connection with the death of Sir Hercules Slaney. At the same time, it is my
  duty&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You can cut all that out," Zambra said. "I know exactly what you mean.
  Everything I say will be used in evidence against me, and all that. Very
  well. And what next?"</p>

  <p>Paradine shepherded his prisoner into the sitting-room, where, apparently,
  the man had been cooking himself a meal. There was a small gas stove in the
  corner of the room, and on this was a frying-pan with a piece of steak
  sizzling in it. One corner of the table had been cleared to make room for a
  plate and a loaf of bread, flanked by a bottle of whisky. From the small
  inner room, where the rat cages were, came a series of shrill little shrieks
  as if the repulsive rodents were fighting amongst themselves. But in the
  excitement of the moment Bly hardly noticed those signs of conflict, because
  his mind was entirely fixed upon the problem of the recovery of the King
  Diamond.</p>

  <p>"Now, what's all this about?" Zambra demanded. "What connection can there
  be between the death of Sir Hercules and myself? I am not going to deny that
  I knew the old gentleman quite well in South Africa and that we did a certain
  amount of business together. But for the last three months, at any rate, I
  never set eyes upon Sir Hercules and I defy you to prove it."</p>

  <p>"Quite naturally," Paradine said. "But you see, that is where we join
  issue. I suppose you won't deny how strange it is that you should be hiding
  in the old gentleman's flat."</p>

  <p>"That," Zambra said, "is neither here nor there. I shall be able to tell a
  logical story when the time comes."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I dare say," Paradine said a bit impatiently. "But I am not here to
  bandy words with you. You are my prisoner and I am going to see you into safe
  custody."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Zambra said composedly. "Give me two or three minutes in the
  bedroom so that I can&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not a second out of my sight!" Paradine said sternly. "Now, come along
  and don't waste any more time."</p>

  <p>Zambra shrugged his shoulders resignedly, and preceded Paradine down the
  stairs. There Paradine hailed a taxi and the three of them drove off in the
  direction of Bow-street Police Station. Once arrived, Paradine gave Bly a
  sign to wait and disappeared down a long corridor with his prisoner. He came
  back a little later on and shook his head doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know the question you are going to ask me," he said to Bly. "You
  want to know if we found any trace of the King Diamond. No, I am sorry to say
  we didn't. Zambra was thoroughly searched by our experts, but all in
  vain."</p>

  <p>There being nothing further to detain Bly for the moment, he went off
  rather crestfallen in the direction of his rooms. It was a sorry story that
  he had to tell Stella when they met as usual at tea time the following
  afternoon.</p>

  <p>"But I feel quite sure you are right," the girl said. "And I feel equally
  sure that when Zambra left Cleopatra's flat after that brutal assault he had
  the King Diamond in his possession. Now, what do you suppose he managed to do
  with it?"</p>

  <p>"Ah, that I can't say," Bly said sorrowfully.</p>

  <p>"We took him quite by surprise and, but for an accident, he might have got
  away altogether. But though he was so thoroughly searched nothing was found
  on him. You see, it is just possible that he might has deposited the diamond
  in safe custody or passed it on to one of those receivers of stolen goods who
  traffic in such things. He had plenty of time to do that."</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose he had," Stella agreed. "Oh, my dear boy, what a
  complicated business it all is. Two or three times you have had a fortune in
  your grasp and yet, on every occasion, it has eluded you. I almost wish we
  had never heard of it. But it is all my fault."</p>

  <p>"Oh, you mustn't talk like that," Bly said. "Your fault indeed. Why, my
  dearest girl, you gave me the opportunity of becoming a rich man and living
  happily ever afterwards quite in the approved story book style with the girl
  of my choice. I am not going to give up yet. We shall find it when we least
  expect to. So don't be too despondent."</p>

  <p>Stella forced a smile to her lips.</p>

  <p>"I only hope you are right," she sighed.</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch30">CHAPTER XXX</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was only natural that the arrest of Carl Zambra on a
charge of
  murdering Sir Hercules Slaney should cause a widespread sensation, especially
  in the cheap Press. The police had been worried and badgered by the whole
  tribe of sensational journalists for their want of acumen with regard to the
  case, and when it became known that Zambra was to appear before the
  magistrate at Bow Street there was a rush on behalf of the brethren of the
  notebook to the scene of the forthcoming drama.</p>

  <p>Zambra stood in the dock, pale, but defiant and with an easy manner. To
  judge from his outward appearance, he had little to fear at the hands of his
  enemies the police. He merely asked if he might have a seat in the dock and
  this was granted in view of the fact that the hearing was likely to be a
  protracted one. The first witness to step forward was Lionel Bly.</p>

  <p>He began by testifying to the fact that he had acted for some considerable
  time as private secretary to the late Sir Hercules Slaney and had spent two
  or three years with the professor in various parts of South Africa.</p>

  <p>"You are not a scientist, I understand, Mr. Bly," the K.C. who appeared
  for the prosecution asked.</p>

  <p>"No, I am not, Sir Charles," Bly answered. "I know a great deal about the
  natives and their ways and I can speak several dialects, which is the reason
  why I was selected by Sir Hercules to act in the capacity of private
  secretary. But I knew nothing of his experiments and the wonderful results
  that he expected to obtain when he had finished his labours."</p>

  <p>"And you returned from South Africa with him?"'</p>

  <p>"Yes, we came back together and settled down, as is usual when we are in
  England, in Devonshire Mansions."</p>

  <p>"Does that mean that you lived on the premises?"</p>

  <p>"No, it doesn't," Bly replied. "I had lodgings outside and it was my duty
  to call round every morning to see to the correspondence and deal with all
  the letters. Also I had to pay the bills and order certain apparatus. At the
  time of Sir Hercules's death I was in Berlin obtaining appliances for my
  employer, and I only learnt what had happened through a Berlin daily
  newspaper. Then I came home at once."</p>

  <p>"Quite so. Did you form any opinion as to the cause of death? I mean, did
  you think Sir Hercules committed suicide!"</p>

  <p>"I was absolutely certain from the very first that he didn't," Bly said
  emphatically. "He was the last man in the world to do anything of the sort.
  Besides, he was on the verge of what he believed to be a startling discovery.
  It was nothing less than a serum or injection or something of that kind by
  which, in the course of a generation, he could turn black men into white. It
  is not for me to say whether it was the dream of a madman or a practical
  proposition, but Sir Hercules firmly believed that he could do so. And that
  is why I felt sure that my employer had met with foul play."</p>

  <p>"You had the run of the flat, or course?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I had my own latchkey, and, after the murder, the authorities
  allowed me to make such search in the flat as suggested itself. I had an
  entirely free hand."</p>

  <p>"And that search? Was it successful?"</p>

  <p>"To a great extent," Bly explained. "I discovered that my late employer
  had been in close contact with the prisoner through the medium of a cipher.
  That cipher appeared at intervals in the agony column of 'The Times.'"</p>

  <p>"We are to understand that you solved it?"</p>

  <p>"I did," Bly said. "And with the permission of the Court, I am going to
  show you how."</p>

  <p>For the first time, the prisoner in the dock showed signs of interest in
  the proceedings. He leant eagerly forward as Bly proceeded to take a pack of
  patience cards from his pocket and lay them out on a large sheet of cardboard
  which he had procured for the purpose. After the cards had been spread out,
  the sheet was handed up to the magistrate on the bench. From another pocket
  Bly produced the front page of 'The Times' for the Saturday on which he had
  gone down to Ravenswood, together with a similar page from the Monday's issue
  of the leading Journal.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I had better explain, your Worship," he went on. "If I might be
  allowed to come and stand beside you on the Bench and point out exactly how I
  arrived at my conclusions."</p>

  <p>Amidst a breathless silence, Bly availed himself of the invitation to come
  up to the table. And there as he explained bit by bit and almost word by word
  how he had solved the cipher, there was something like a sensation in the
  crowded court. As he finished at length and went back to his place, the
  magistrate read the translation of the two ciphers aloud. Down below, in the
  well of the court, the sensation deepened and the reporters in front of the
  solicitors' table scribbled away furiously, for here was one of the most
  dramatic scenes that had ever happened in a court of justice.</p>

  <p>There were only a few more questions and then Bly stepped out of the
  witness-box, satisfied that he had left little unsaid. He gave one glance at
  Zambra, who had slipped back into his indifferent attitude again, though Bly
  could judge from the way in which the prisoner had locked his hands together
  that he was badly shaken. Then another witness stepped forward. It was the
  waiter whom Bly had first encountered when he was making his inquiries in the
  lounge of the Hotel Legation.</p>

  <p>"You are a waiter at a certain hotel, I understand," counsel asked. "Is
  not that so?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the witness said. "I am at the Hotel Legation and it is part
  of my duty to wait on customers in the lounge. That is in the evenings,
  sir."</p>

  <p>"Then you know most of those customers by sight."</p>

  <p>"The regular ones, sir. Of course, we have strangers from time to time,
  and I generally notice them, because, you see, it sometimes pays a waiter to
  remember faces."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," counsel smiled. "Now I want you to cast your memory back to
  the night some weeks ago, a Monday night&mdash;in fact, the night that Sir
  Hercules Slaney died. Is that date particularly fixed upon your memory?"</p>

  <p>"It is, sir," the waiter said confidently.</p>

  <p>"Did you see Sir Hercules on that night?"</p>

  <p>"I did, sir. He came into the lounge at about 8 o'clock. Just about the
  time I was going off duty. It was my night out, sir. But I stayed long enough
  to see the gentleman come in."</p>

  <p>"But why did you particularly notice him?"</p>

  <p>"Well, sir, I was very much struck by the gentleman's appearance. He was
  so tall and thin. He had such an enormous head, and, although he seemed old,
  I was impressed by his wonderfully clear blue eyes and teeth. Beautiful teeth
  they were, and anybody could see that they were real."</p>

  <p>"Any further confirmation of identity?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir, a photograph I saw after in one of the papers. Sir Hercules sat
  down as if waiting for somebody, and that was the last I saw of him. I
  couldn't tell you any more, sir."</p>

  <p>With that the witness was allowed to depart. His place was immediately
  taken by the second waiter from the Hotel Legation.</p>

  <p>"Now, listen to me," counsel said. "As the prisoner is not legally
  represented, I want to be as fair to him as I can. I understand, witness,
  that, after your colleague left the lounge, you took up his duties instead.
  You did? Very good. Did you notice Sir Hercules Slaney?"</p>

  <p>"Not to know him by name, sir," the witness replied. "At least, not just
  then. I saw him sit down and wait, and then a few minutes later another
  gentleman came in and they sat in a corner by themselves talking very
  earnestly."</p>

  <p>"Did you supply them with anything to drink?"</p>

  <p>"I did, sir. They had two whiskies-and-sodas each, and about 9 o'clock the
  gentleman that my colleague recognised as Sir Hercules Slaney got up and left
  the hotel."</p>

  <p>"I suppose you overheard nothing of their conversation?"</p>

  <p>"Not to understand it, sir, because they were speaking in a foreign
  language. It wasn't one of the ordinary European languages or I should have
  recognised it. It sounded to me more like some sort of a dialect."</p>

  <p>"I don't think we need go into that," counsel said. "Did you recognise Sir
  Hercules's companion?"</p>

  <p>"I did, sir," the witness said promptly. "It was the man standing there in
  the dock."</p>

  <p>Followed another sensation and a shout from those assembled in court that
  might have been heard outside. When silence had been restored counsel resumed
  his examination.</p>

  <p>"You have no doubt whatever about that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not the slightest, sir," the witness went on emphatically. "I had never
  seen him before and only once since, and that was one night when he was
  dining in the grill room with a friend, whom I think he addressed as Hawker,
  but I won't be quite certain about that, because Mr. Hawker was a stranger to
  me, and, so far as I know, he has not been in our place since. But I am
  positive as to the identity of the prisoner."</p>

  <p>With which the witness stood down amidst a hum of excitement from the
  deeply interested listeners.</p>

  <p>"I should like to ask a question," Zambra said from the dock. "I am not
  represented by counsel as yet, and I hope that the learned magistrate will
  give me every latitude."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," the magistrate said. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"Well, what I was going to ask is how all this tends to prove my guilt? I
  am not prepared to deny that I was the man who invented those ciphers and
  that Sir Hercules and myself were in the habit of using them frequently.
  There were reasons which have nothing to do with the case why it was just as
  well that Sir Hercules and myself should not be seen together. The same
  remark applies to the time when they were both in South Africa. Mr. Bly has
  told you in evidence how he had searched the files of certain South African
  journals and discovered similar ciphers in their columns. I make the Court a
  present of this statement. But it does not in the least connect me with the
  mystery of Sir Hercules's death. Two witnesses have just told you that they
  saw Sir Hercules and myself meet and part again within an hour. Subsequently
  Sir Hercules was found dead behind bolted and barred doors, and, if I have
  time, I will bring witnesses to prove that I could not possibly have seen my
  old friend again between the time that he left me in the lounge of the Hotel
  Legation and, the time when he was found dead in his flat."</p>

  <p>"All this, or course," the magistrate said, "we can go into later on. As
  far as I can judge, the hearing will have to be adjourned, and, in the
  meantime, I hope the prisoner will take steps to be properly represented at
  the next hearing. Now, Inspector Paradine, will you kindly proceed."</p>

  <p>"Very good, your Worship," Paradine said. "Call the next witness. Call Dr.
  Israel Forbes."</p>

  <p>A thin, scholarly-looking man, with pale features and eyes hidden behind
  tinted glasses, emerged timidly from the throng and stepped as if unwillingly
  into the box.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Forbes, I believe," counsel said suavely. "Now, Doctor, will you
  kindly tell us something that is likely to throw a light on this remarkable
  case."</p>

  <p>"I will do my best, sir," the little man said. "I really have nothing to
  do with the case, and I never spoke to Sir Hercules Slaney in my life.
  Neither have I seen the prisoner in the dock until the last few moments. My
  friend Mr. Bly, one of the previous witnesses, introduced me to Inspector
  Paradine with a view to expounding a theory which seems to have been entirely
  overlooked. In fact, my evidence is entirely theory."</p>

  <p>'"Then you can't tell us anything?" counsel asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, I think I can, Sir Charles. I was very interested in the case. I
  read all about it in the papers, especially with regard to the fact that Sir
  Hercules was found dead behind locked doors. I came to the conclusion that he
  was the last man in the world to commit suicide and I am still of the same
  opinion."</p>

  <p>"Then how did he die?" counsel asked.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that I cannot definitely tell you. We know that he came to his end by
  arsenical poisoning. And the inference is that that poison was
  self-inflicted. To all outward appearance, such was the case when we realise
  that nobody was in the professor's flat after he had locked the door on that
  eventful Monday night. The thing looks an absolutely baffling mystery. But
  let us suppose for a moment that the poison was administered to Sir Hercules
  between the hours of 8 and 9 on that Monday night, the hour that he was
  actually in the Hotel Legation."</p>

  <p>"But do you mean that he was poisoned there?" counsel cried.</p>

  <p>"Well, at any rate, it is a plausible theory," witness smiled. "It has
  been proved that the professor had two whiskies-and-sodas and each of those
  might have been strongly impregnated with arsenic. You might suggest that he
  would have noticed the taste, but then he was an absent-minded old gentleman
  and talking excitedly at the time. If I am correct, then it would have been
  quite possible for the professor to have walked home from the Hotel Legation
  to his flat before the poison began to take effect. Any toxicologist will
  bear me out in what I say."</p>

  <p>Once again the court swayed with excitement at this amazing and unexpected
  evidence. Paradine, standing by Bly's side, and himself absolutely unmoved,
  indicated the man who was standing a few yards behind him.</p>

  <p>"See that fellow?" he said. "I mean the man in the brown overcoat. The man
  with the grey moustache."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Bly said. "What has he to do with it?"</p>

  <p>"Only this," Paradine said with a grim smile. "He is the chemist who sold
  the arsenic to Zambra."</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch31">CHAPTER XXXI</a></h2>

  <p class="first">"WHEN did you find that out?" Bly asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, only an hour or two ago," Paradine explained. "Ever since you made
  that suggestion to me, which your doctor friend has confirmed, our men have
  been hunting high and low for anyone from whom Zambra was likely to have
  bought the stuff. Well, they found one at last in a back street behind
  Charing Cross-road. Of course, we had that photograph of Zambra and Cleopatra
  to help us, and the chemist was quite sure he recognised the man in it. When
  he came into court just now he was certain. Just a minute&mdash;he is going
  to give his evidence."</p>

  <p>The chemist stepped into the box and was immediately asked a pointed
  question by the prosecution.</p>

  <p>"You are here at the instigation of the police," counsel suggested. "You
  are a chemist, I believe."</p>

  <p>"That is right, sir," the man in the box said.</p>

  <p>"And you sell all sorts of drugs. Poisons of various sorts, and so forth,
  I presume."</p>

  <p>"In the course of business, quite so, sir."</p>

  <p>"Now, will you look at the prisoner in the dock," counsel went on. "Have
  you ever seen him before?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir," the witness replied with great promptitude.</p>

  <p>"Very good. In that case will you be good enough to tell the Court when
  you saw the prisoner and how."</p>

  <p>"Well, he came into my shop, sir. It would be some weeks ago, but I have
  the date with me and will produce it. It was about two o'clock in the
  afternoon when the prisoner came into my shop and asked for an ounce of
  arsenic. It was supplied to him, and I entered the transaction in my poison
  book. And that is about all I can tell you, sir."</p>

  <p>"You've no doubt as to the prisoner's identity?"</p>

  <p>"Not in the least, sir. I could have picked him out anywhere from the
  photograph the detectives showed me. In fact, I saw the photograph myself
  because it happened to be in my favourite picture paper. The prisoner was
  taken by a Press photographer, together with the famous actress, Madame
  Cleopatra."</p>

  <p>A few words more, and the witness was allowed to depart. It was not so
  much what the chemist said as the gist of his evidence, which left little
  doubt in the minds of the spectators that the police had established an
  almost perfect case. As the witness stepped from the box, Bly whispered a few
  quick, excited words into the ears of his companion, Paradine.</p>

  <p>"That is a bit of an inspiration, Mr. Bly," the latter said. "I will see
  to the matter at once."</p>

  <p>With that, Paradine made his way as far as the solicitor's table and spoke
  hurriedly to the distinguished barrister who was appearing on behalf of the
  Crown.</p>

  <p>"That is practically my case, your worship," counsel said. "But before I
  address the Court, I should like to have the second waiter from the Hotel
  Legation recalled for a moment. I wish to ask him a few further
  questions."</p>

  <p>The waiter who had attended to the wants of Zambra and Slaney on the night
  of the latter's death came forward.</p>

  <p>"I will not keep you more than a minute or two," counsel said. "On that
  particular Monday night, you waited upon the prisoner and Sir Hercules.
  According to your statement, you took them a whisky-and-soda each on two
  occasions. Did you, at the same time, supply them with anything else?"</p>

  <p>"No, sir," the witness said. "Oh, yes, I did. I had quite forgotten. The
  prisoner asked for a small plate of ham sandwiches. At least, he didn't ask
  for himself, because it was Sir Hercules who suggested it. I was to get about
  three or four sandwiches which were to be well seasoned."</p>

  <p>"That will do, I think," counsel said.</p>

  <p>The witness sat down, to the obvious disappointment of the listeners, who
  had evidently expected something dramatic in connection with the prosecution.
  Then the eminent barrister went on to address the Bench.</p>

  <p>"That is my case, your Worship," he said. "I may say that when I came into
  court this morning I did not expect to be able to produce the chemist who
  sold arsenic to the prisoner and positively identified him. Not only that,
  but from his book he verified the date of the sale. It was a suggestion from
  an individual in court who knows a good deal about Sir Hercules' habits who
  wished the waiter to be recalled because the gentleman I am speaking about
  knew that Sir Hercules was never in the habit of partaking of spirituous
  liquor between meals unless he had at least a biscuit with it. There are many
  scientific men who advocate this course, and perhaps it is a sound one. At
  any rate, that was what happened on the night of the death of Sir Hercules
  Slaney. Now, it is my contention that the prisoner, knowing Sir Hercules as
  intimately as he did, was perfectly aware of this habit. In fact, he looked
  for it as a matter of course. He knew when he ordered the whisky-and-soda
  that Sir Hercules would ask for something, however slight, in the way of
  food. And he knew, moreover, that the highly seasoned ham sandwich which, I
  take it, implies a good deal of mustard would have been more than sufficient
  to hide the acrid taste of the arsenic. I suggest that when those two men
  were talking earnestly together one or more of the sandwiches were
  surreptitiously removed from the plate and, under cover of the table, the
  arsenic was dusted on the ham and the upper slice of bread and butter
  replaced. Such a piece of dexterous juggling would be quite easy to so bold
  and clever a man as the prisoner. And that is as far as I am prepared to go
  this morning."</p>

  <p>The magistrate on the bench looked over his spectacles.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," he said judicially, "that something like a prima facie
  case has been made out. I don't know whether the prisoner will like a remand,
  or whether he would prefer to reserve his defence and be properly represented
  later on at the Central Criminal Court."</p>

  <p>The magistrate glanced to the dock as he spoke. Zambra shrugged his
  shoulders with perfect indifference.</p>

  <p>"Just as your Worship pleases," he said. "I am not guilty of this charge
  and if you like to commit me for trial I have no objection. Later on I will
  instruct counsel."</p>

  <p>"Very well," the magistrate said briefly. "You are committed for trial at
  the next sessions."</p>

  <p>It was all over and the great majority of the spectators left the court.
  Paradine detained Bly as the latter was making his way out into
  Tavistock-street.</p>

  <p>"I think that will be about the end of Carl Zambra," he said. "That was a
  very happy suggestion of yours with regard to those sandwiches. It has got us
  out of rather a tight place. If you had not thought of such a thing, I could
  see a clever barrister making fine play with our contention that Sir Hercules
  was poisoned by arsenic in the lounge of the hotel. You see, we should have
  had to have pinned ourselves to the insinuation that the powder was
  introduced into the whisky-and-soda, which would be anything but easy to do.
  I suppose that Sir Hercules always did eat something when he drank
  spirits?"</p>

  <p>"Invariably," Bly said. "As a matter of fact, the old gentleman was rather
  partial to a drop of fine old Scotch. He had a wonderful constitution and
  could drink anything at any time and any amount of it. But he always
  attributed his immunity from harm to the habit of eating even a small biscuit
  with every drink he partook of. I never knew him to forget it."</p>

  <p>"Well, from our point of view, it was an excellent habit. Now if you will
  walk with me as far as the Yard&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Can't be done," Bly said briefly. "I am late for an important appointment
  as it is. I must get back to Devonshire Mansions as quickly as possible to
  meet Professor John Everdine there. I have put him off twice. You see he is
  the great scientific authority who has undertaken to carry on the work that
  poor old Sir Hercules had in hand. And indeed he has made arrangements to
  retain the flat so that he can work there without having all the bother of
  moving everything. I have to meet him this morning and hand over everything.
  But I can call in at any time after three o'clock."</p>

  <p>Bly hurried off to Devonshire Mansions, where he found the learned
  professor impatiently awaiting him on the doorstep. Then followed an hour or
  two during which Bly laid all the papers and documents before Dr. Everdine,
  who went through them with meticulous care to the very finish.</p>

  <p>"I think that is all, Mr. Bly," he said. "You may not be a scientist, but
  you certainly have a fine mathematical mind. I only wish I could find
  somebody to keep my papers in the same perfect order. I can see my late
  friend's scheme with absolute clearness now. Um&mdash;yes," he mumbled to
  himself. "Most fascinating. Probably nothing in it when you come to practical
  results, but then, where scientists are concerned you never can quite tell.
  Now, as to the lease of the flat."</p>

  <p>"I don't think you need worry about that, doctor," Bly said. "The lease
  has some two years to run yet. I have seen the landlord's agent, and told him
  what you propose to do, and he has no objection to accepting you as the
  tenant. If it will save you trouble I will have all the necessary documents
  prepared, after which you will sign the transfer and the flat will be as much
  yours as it was Sir Hercules'."</p>

  <p>"Now, that is very good of you, young man,"' Everdine said, "I hate all
  that sort of thing, because it always bothers me and in business matters I am
  no more than a child. There is only one more little thing."</p>

  <p>"And what is that?" Bly asked smilingly.</p>

  <p>"Well, the matter of those rats. Of course, I am quite accustomed to
  experimenting on animals in a perfectly humane way, but it so happens that I
  have a particular aversion to rats. I don't understand the creatures. How do
  you feed them and what do they eat? If you will give me some details in that
  respect I dare say I can get my chauffeur to see to the rest. You might jot
  the details down on paper. Then I will come back here in half an hour and
  relieve you of further responsibility."</p>

  <p>"I will do that with pleasure," Bly said. "It is a very simple matter,
  after all."</p>

  <p>Dr. Everdine ambled off in his absent-minded way, leaving Bly in
  possession of the flat. Everything was now in order and there was nothing to
  be done except make a kind of schedule with regard to the rats' feeding on
  the typewriter. Once this was done, Bly went into the inner room, where the
  rodents were disporting themselves in their cages. At the sight of him a
  score or so of the little creatures rushed to the bars and began to clamour
  in their insatiable way for food. Like their cousins, the guinea pigs, they
  never seemed to have enough to eat, and Bly smiled as he recognised the
  inevitable symptoms.</p>

  <p>He filled up the ingenious automatic arrangements by which, at intervals,
  the rodents received a regular supply of grain, and saw that the water tanks
  in each case were replenished. There were rats of all kinds and colours, from
  pure white to raven black. It was these ebony-coloured creatures that always
  engaged Sir Hercules' closest attention. They were in a cage by themselves
  apart from the rest, and for the last time Bly cast an eye over them. It was
  in so doing that he noticed something that immediately claimed his earnest
  attention.</p>

  <p>On the floor of one compartment of the cage which had been barred from the
  rest three dead rats lay. They were so small that their eyes were not yet
  open, and they were absolutely devoid of hair. It seemed as if they had
  fallen out of the nest, which was under the roof of the cage and approached
  by a sort of sliding platform. How they got there it was impossible for Bly
  to say. Then he recollected that clamour made by the repulsive little
  creatures on the night when Zambra had been discovered in the flat, and a
  sudden thought flashed like lightning through his mind.</p>

  <p>With a trembling hand he pulled back the top of the cage and looked down
  into the nest from which the baby rats had fallen. The nest was empty, but
  something closely coiled up lay inside it&mdash;something that gleamed and
  glittered.</p>

  <p>Bly lifted the object from its bed of down, and stood there half dazed
  with the King Diamond in his hand!</p><hr>

  <h2><a id="ch32">CHAPTER XXXII</a></h2>

  <p class="first">IT was a week later and a small party had gathered at
Ravenswood. It
  consisted of Sir Samuel Oscar, together with Stella and Bly. There were no
  other guests invited for the week-end and Sir Samuel had had his own ends in
  view when he had arranged this meeting under the roof where Stella had been
  born. He was in one of his best and kindliest moods and happy in the
  knowledge that a problem which had been sorely troubling him for a long time
  had now been practically solved.</p>

  <p>He sat at the luncheon table, fairly exuding geniality and good nature. He
  beamed on his two guests in his best fatherly fashion, and, indeed, it was
  hard to believe that this was the great man who held so firm a sway in
  Bishopsgate-street.</p>

  <p>"Well, here we are," he said. "With all our troubles and worries behind us
  for the next eight-and-forty hours at least. Now, I dare say you young people
  want to know why I have asked you down here. Perhaps Bly can guess."</p>

  <p>"I dare say I can, sir," Bly replied. "You want to hear the full story of
  the King Diamond."</p>

  <p>"Well, amongst other things," Sir Samuel admitted. "You see, I know
  practically nothing. I promised you that you should receive half the value of
  that stone if you got it back, and I am not going to break my word. To tell
  you the honest truth, I never believed that there really was a King Diamond.
  I am not the sort of man who has made a large fortune chasing rainbows, and I
  am too old to begin now. I didn't go further than to believe that there might
  have been some basis of truth in that legend, but never in my wildest dreams
  did I expect to see on my office table the wonderful stone that my young
  friend Bly produced for my inspection the day before yesterday. And he
  wouldn't tell me where he got it from or how he found it. Now what do you
  think of that for a servant, my dear?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, Lionel was always very headstrong," Stella laughed. "He wouldn't tell
  me till I actually dragged it out of him."</p>

  <p>"Just listen to her," Bly said. "Can you imagine Stella badgering anybody
  out of anything? She just smiled sweetly with a look of resignation in those
  lovely eyes of hers and said with a gentle sigh that she supposed she must
  wait."</p>

  <p>"And then you told her all about it," Sir Samuel interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Of course I did. Anybody would," Bly responded.</p>

  <p>"Very well," Sir Samuel said. "Now tell me."</p>

  <p>"Really, there is very little to tell," Bly said. "Of course, I knew that
  the King Diamond existed, though I was not absolutely certain till I saw it
  blazing on the neck of Cleopatra the first night she appeared at the
  Colidrome. Stella was with me, and she will tell you what a sensation that
  lovely woman created. But we were not so much interested in her as in the
  diamond at her throat. And it didn't take us long to guess, either, that she
  was wearing the fabulous King Diamond. Of course, she got it from Zambra. Sir
  Hercules had smuggled it out of the Maggersfont mine, after it had been
  handed over to him by M'Papo. Then there is no doubt that Sir Hercules met
  Zambra somewhere and transferred the stone to him The meeting was arranged
  through one of those ciphers in a Kimberley paper. In fact, I have seen the
  files of the newspaper in question and actually traced the cipher making the
  appointment. That was after I was lucky enough to get hold of the clue to the
  messages in 'The Times.' But I have told you all about that, Sir Samuel."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes," Sir Samuel said eagerly. "You kept me posted up to a certain
  point, and it is only quite lately that you have been so mysterious. But, go
  on, my boy."</p>

  <p>"You see, I had to be very careful," Bly said. "I was so dreadfully afraid
  that the police would find that diamond, and if they had then I should have
  had all my trouble for my pains."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, you wouldn't," Sir Samuel chuckled.</p>

  <p>"Well, at any rate, I should have had no claim to a reward. When Zambra
  was arrested the other night in Devonshire Mansions I made sure that the
  diamond would be found in his possession. I was positive that he was the
  alleged burglar who had robbed Cleopatra, and I felt as sure as fate that
  when he came to be searched the big stone would be found on him. And I don't
  know whether I was disappointed or relieved to find that it wasn't."</p>

  <p>"You are making rather a long story of it, aren't you," Sir Samuel asked
  impatiently. "As a matter of fact, I have been following this business a
  great deal more carefully than you are aware of. I knew, for instance, that
  the police were after Zambra. Paradine kept me posted, as naturally he would,
  seeing that I consulted him in the matter. And of course I read all about
  that burglary of Cleopatra's flat in the papers. Like you, I came to the
  conclusion that Zambra was the man. But what I want to know is how you found
  the diamond, and where."</p>

  <p>"I found it in Sir Hercules's flat."</p>

  <p>"In Sir Hercules's flat? Oh, I begin to see. You mean to say that when
  Zambra realised that his audacious hiding-place was discovered, he hid the
  diamond in the flat."</p>

  <p>"That is precisely what I do mean," Bly smiled. "I knew he must have it on
  him and that he was merely waiting for some confederate to find him the
  necessary money to get out of the country, after which he would have had no
  difficulty in disposing of the gem to some American or Argentine millionaire.
  But I had not the slightest idea where to look for the missing diamond."</p>

  <p>"Um, fairly sound," Sir Samuel muttered. "But if Zambra had left the
  diamond in the flat, how do you think he expected to get it back again? To
  begin with, he was in the hands of the police."</p>

  <p>"Granted, sir. But the police had a long row to hoe before they could
  convict him. And there was always the chance of his getting off. If he had
  succeeded in so doing, he would have found some excuse for calling on Dr.
  Everdine and recovering the stone. A man so diabolically clever would
  certainly have found a way to recover what he regarded as lost property."</p>

  <p>"But where was the diamond hidden?" Sir Samuel demanded.</p>

  <p>"You will never guess," Bly laughed. "He put it in a rat's nest in one of
  the cages. If it hadn't been for a providential idea that filtered into my
  mind I should never have found it. But listen and I will tell you just how it
  happened."</p>

  <p>With that, Bly told the rest of the story, to which Sir Samuel listened
  with marked approval on his jovial face.</p>

  <p>"Well, I congratulate you," he said. "It was a fine piece of work all
  round, and you are entitled to all I promised. When that diamond comes to be
  sold half the proceeds belong to you. You will be a comparatively rich man,
  free to settle down in the country as an independent gentleman."</p>

  <p>"I have already selected my house," Bly said.</p>

  <p>Sir Samuel lay back in his chair and laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"Oh, evidently one of those 'do it now' young men," he chuckled. "But I
  don't see you settling down to a country life. Why not put a large share of
  that money into my business? It will bring you in four or five times as much,
  and one of these days you will be virtually the Maggersfont Diamond
  Corporation. And one of these days the dear child who is sitting by your side
  will be mistress of her old home once more. I have very few relations and
  most of them have more than they want already. We will talk this over next
  week if you like."</p>

  <p>Bly began to stammer his thanks, but Sir Samuel cut him short.</p>

  <p>"Oh, never mind about that," he said. "And never mind about me, either,
  for the moment. Take Stella out and show her the roses and the hay and the
  lambs playing in the field, and all that sort of thing. Make her happy and
  you will make me happy, for she is a real good girl and I don't want to lose
  sight of her if I can help it. Directly I get a secretary who is worth her
  salt some young fool must come along and marry her. Now, be off before I get
  really angry."</p>

  <p>"Now, isn't he a darling?" Stella said once they were out in the open.
  "Isn't he wonderful?"</p>

  <p>"'I know a nicerer,'" Bly quoted gaily. "It's all right Stella darling,
  now, isn't it?"</p>
