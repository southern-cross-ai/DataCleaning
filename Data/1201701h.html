<h2>I</h2>

<p class="first">DRENTON DENN stood watching the points of flame
dragging along the Cuban coast. Under the cloak of the night
rottenness and corruption lay hidden. The cat was still playing
with the mouse, and concrete humanity had grown jaded with the
spectacle. The whole thing had mattered little to Europe so long
as wheat was down firm at 40s. again.</p>

<p>But it mattered a great deal to Drenton Denn, seeing that he
was a war correspondent of mark. Copy lay yonder back beyond the
sandhills, facing Port Indigo--copy palpitating with new horrors
and sensations. Slowly the Spaniards were being starved into
submission, chaos and worse reigned in Port Indigo, and Denn
meant to sketch the crimson horrors of it on his note-book,
despite the rigid regulations forbidding the landing of a single
man from the American fleet there.</p>

<p>For strange stories had come like fugitives across the bay to
the blockading fleet. The infamous Don Macdona had made his
headquarters in Port Indigo. He was holding high court there with
the scum of the island. Sooner or later this hybrid tyrant and
bloodsucker would fall into the hands of Uncle Sam, and be shot
out of hand. Being a fatalist and a sybarite, he was plucking the
flowers that time allowed to him.</p>

<p>Carpe diem. This picturesque polyglot reeked in the nostrils
of a continent. Of all the gaudy insects born of the refuse heap
there were none more gaudy than Macdona. Who he was or whence he
came nobody knew or cared. Certainly he throve from the Cuban
miasma. He had established himself in the deserted palace of the
Cagas at Port Indigo, and there he had gathered a choice
selection of adventurers and, incidentally, adventuresses about
him.</p>

<p>All these things and more had Drenton Denn gathered from a
native who had swum out to the Maryland battleship and there died
the next morning, incontinently babbling o' strange things.
Yellow moths and Macdona! And why yellow moth? In some way a
yellow moth seemed to be mixed up with the new scourge
devastating Port Indigo.</p>

<p>Under cover of the darkness lay some of the finest material
that ever made the future of journalistic enterprise. Obviously
Denn's duty pointed thither. For authority and service
regulations your born correspondent cares nothing. Denn was going
to see those yellow moths, the heralds of a new and strange
disease, for himself.</p>

<p>Hang the sharks! And it was but a bare half-mile to the
sandhills. Denn slipped over the forechains and dropped
noiselessly into the oily tide. In the crown of his helmet was
his note book and revolver. With any luck he could get all he
required and be back again before daylight with Admiral Saxon not
a penny the wiser.</p>

<p>So this wiry little Vermonter, lithe and lean and spare like
the wild cat that he was, struck out for the sandhills. The
object of sharks was uppermost in his mind. "Tragic death of a
well-known war correspondent." A good headline, that. By the time
Denn was settled the 'scare heads' setting out his own premature
demise, his toes scraped the sand.</p>

<p>Port Indigo at last! No European has set foot there for years.
Here was a fresh mine of iniquity, and never a rival on the
premises.</p>

<p>Denn pushed boldly on into the town. The place was darkness,
and desolation. A handful of fireflies darted and glistened. From
one or two houses a shaft of light fell like a spear across the
road. In one of these lanes of light lay something that seemed to
palpitate. It bore an odd repulsive resemblance to a human
corpse. It seemed to be cased in something yellow, that trembled
as trees do on a hazy summer afternoon.</p>

<p>With some little tendency to nausea, Denn touched the mass
with his foot. At once the shimmering yellow rose like a cloud
and fluttered round Denn's head. A soft rhythmic beat filled the
stagnant air.</p>

<p>Denn fell back with a shuddering cry. He stood in a veritable
cloud of yellow moths, small furred insects with greasy bodies
and protruding eyes. In the light of his new knowledge there was
something peculiarly horrible in the sight. Every word uttered by
the babbling fugitive of the Maryland came back to Denn now with
a scorching lightning force.</p>

<p>The new scourge of Port Indigo was preceded by the yellow
moth. The same fearsome insect was at once the victim's prophet
and his pall. The moths fell like a cloud upon the object at
Denn's feet.</p>

<p>The next moment he saw the door of a house open and a woman's
figure standing out black against the light. With her hands
uplifted she screamed despairingly for aid.</p>

<p>Denn crossed the road and in his best Spanish proffered his
assistance. As the woman turned and entered a room somewhat
handsomely furnished, Denn followed.</p>

<p>Standing in the centre of the room, apparently thrashing empty
air with his arms, was a man of some forty years. His handsome
features were knitted into a despairing terror.</p>

<p>"Is this some sudden madness?" Denn asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, no," the woman moaned. "The moth--cannot you see the
yellow moth? One came this morning, and we knew the message. Not
a door, not a window has been opened since morning, and yet here
they are."</p>

<p>Once more Denn felt the old horror creeping over him. The room
seemed to be filled with the little sulphur moths, the doomed man
fought them down with his hands, a mass of smashed saffron formed
a ring about his feet. And yet Denn could hardly see across the
room for them.</p>

<p>"Can nothing be done?" Denn asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing. His sufferings will be over in a few minutes. Oh, my
God!"</p>

<p>The Spaniard's courage seemed to suddenly fail him. The
grotesque horror of it turned his soul to water. With a yell he
dropped his hands by his sides and bolted for the street like a
hare.</p>

<p>Denn quickly followed. He had not far to run, for the Spaniard
had hardly propelled himself a dozen paces before he pitched
headlong to the ground and lay there like a dog. As Denn turned
the prostrate figure over he found the limbs already cold. The
Spaniard was dead.</p>

<p>Almost instantly the yellow cloud had swarmed all over him.
Denn turned to the woman, but she had already vanished. Beside
herself with terror, she fled into the heart of the night, and
Denn saw her no more.</p>

<p>A moment later a hand was laid on Denn's arm.</p>

<p>"You are American," a soft voice murmured in his ear.
"Therefore you are a brave signor. I pray you to grant me your
assistance."</p>

<hr>

<h2>II</h2>

<p class="first">A LANCET of light streaming from a distant
window fell athwart the speaker's face. The features were
strikingly beautiful, glowing with the flush of youth and health.
The girl too, was handsomely attired, yet there was something in
the face, lovely as it was, that repelled Denn while it attracted
him.</p>

<p>"Are you in danger?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," came the reply, "what danger I cannot tell
you."</p>

<p>"And yet I should gather that you are a resident of the
place."</p>

<p>"That is the truth, Signor. Still I am quite alone here. All
that were near and dear to me have gone down before the yellow
death. And I am afraid, I am sorely afraid, of Macdona."</p>

<p>"I quite understand," Denn said grimly, "also I have heard of
the gentleman. What would you have me do for you?"</p>

<p>"The signor is an officer from a warship yonder in search of
adventure?"</p>

<p>"I am in search of adventure," Denn responded drily, "and I
must confess that my widest expectations have been fully
realised. But I am not an officer--I am nothing more than a war
correspondent."</p>

<p>"Could you smuggle me on one of the ships?"</p>

<p>Denn temporised. He knew perfectly well he could do nothing of
the kind.</p>

<p>The stranger's name, it appeared, was Donna Inez Castalo, and
she had a plan to propose provided that Signor Denn was willing
to assist her.</p>

<p>"It is not safe to stand here," she said. "The spies of
Macdona are everywhere. You will come to my poor home, and I will
make you known to my old gouvernante, Donna Bella. Is it not
so?"</p>

<p>"I follow you," said Denn.</p>

<p>A short walk brought the pair to a gateway leading to what
seemed a house of some pretensions.</p>

<p>The place appeared to be furnished to the last degree of
extravagance. Under the flare of many lamps the room was wild and
bizarre to a degree. From somewhere in the distance came the
sound of mad revelry.</p>

<p>Denn turned suspiciously to his companion.</p>

<p>"What does this pantomime mean?" he asked.</p>

<p>Donna Inez laughed.</p>

<p>"It means," she said, "that you are a guest of Don Macdona.
You will pardon my leaving you alone for a time."</p>

<p>The opposite door closed with a click, and Denn knew that he
was a prisoner.</p>

<p>A few moments later four stalwart half-breeds, fully armed,
came in. That they were capable of anything in the way of
picturesque criminality Denn saw at a glance.</p>

<p>"Don Macdona wishes to see you. Follow us," said the leader of
the party.</p>

<p>Denn followed his guides along a flagged corridor and in the
direction of the chamber came sounds of wild revelry. Then a door
was flung open, and a dazzling scene burst upon the gaze of the
American prisoner.</p>

<p>The spectacle was a striking one.</p>

<p>Some two score of people of both sexes lounged about a table,
at the head of which sat a little man with an enormous head and
diabolically clever face. Such was Macdona.</p>

<p>As Denn entered, he rose with a gesture of politeness.</p>

<p>"Welcome to our poor house and board," he said. "Donna Inez
has prepared us for your coming. Are we right in assuming that
you are the correspondent Drenton Denn? If so, you have been
pleased to describe certain little inventions of mine, and as a
return for your kindness I have saved up one of the neatest for
yourself. In the meantime make yourself at home."</p>

<p>Denn poured himself out a glass of wine with a steady
hand.</p>

<p>He was fully conscious of the strength of his nerves and the
trustworthiness of his revolver. There was just a chance for him
yet.</p>

<p>A moment or two later laughing and chattering broke out again,
and a wild Spanish dance was in progress.</p>

<p>Denn sat at the table watching the graceful gyrations.
Doubtless it had been exploited in his honour. The prisoner had
one eye upon the whirling kaleidoscope, the other on the exits
from the room.</p>

<p>"Escape is out of the question," whispered a voice in his
ear.</p>

<p>A flaming Spanish beauty had dropped into a vacant seat on
Denn's right hand. Her face was hard as marble, yet there was
something of a friendly light in those liquid eves.</p>

<p>"I gather that you would help me if you could," said Denn.</p>

<p>"If only you could get as far as the door without being
noticed! A plan may yet occur to you. If it does, make for the
door, and I shall be there. Let us dance. Macdona is regarding us
suspiciously."</p>

<p>Denn promptly flung himself into the mad humour of the thing.
He was as a man dancing on the lips of a volcano, a veritable
dance of death. Then above the revelry came the clang of
midnight.</p>

<p>Denn paused involuntarily and glanced at Macdona. Had the
latter forgotten his promise or did he desire to prolong the
agony? At any rate he made no sign, and the dance continued.</p>

<p>Madder, wilder, noisier it grew. Denn was actually carried
away by the spirit of the dance. He forgot everything else for
the moment, until a pair of arms cast about his neck from behind,
brought him, panting, to a standstill, and held him there like a
vice.</p>

<p>Denn fought like a dozen wild cats, but his unseen antagonist
had him at a terrible disadvantage. Then a softer, whiter arm
stole across his lips, and a handkerchief drenched with some
sweet pungent liquid was pressed over his mouth and nostrils.
Denn held his breath grimly; he kept his lips sealed until his
brain reeled and his heart seemed to be bursting his ribs
asunder. Flesh and blood could stand it no longer, and Denn
gasped and gurgled for air. Then he fell, like a tired child,
into a sweet and placid slumber.</p>

<p>When Denn returned to consciousness he found himself trussed
up with fine Manila ropes, like a fowl ready for the spit. He was
still sick and hazy with the aftermath of the chloroform, but all
the same he had no cause to grumble at the paucity of interest in
the surroundings. On a stand in the centre of the room stood a
glass case in the shape of a huge coffin. The crystal sides were
heavily clamped with brass, and the whole thing was attached to
the floor. There was a smile on Macdona's face as he indicated
the singular machine.</p>

<p>"I dare say you are wondering what that thing is," he said. "I
am going to tell you. It is a steaming apparatus. We are going to
place you in there, and clap the lid on so that by means of
certain mechanism you will gradually steam. The top of the
concern is perforated so as to admit of a certain amount of air,
thus preventing anything like a sudden despatch of the victim. In
that trap you will have just room to stand upright, and from
below the glass you will be able to judge what effect your
performance will have on your audience. Pretty material for your
journal, eh? Unfortunately, your graphic pen will not be in a
position to describe it."</p>

<p>At the sign of Macdona two of the gang raised Denn aloft, and
deposited him in the coffin, then the heavy lid was screwed down.
Almost instantly a warm air seemed to fill the confined space.
Denn's brain thickened for a moment, then as suddenly clarified
again.</p>

<hr>

<h2>III</h2>

<p class="first">"FOR the next half hour," said Macdona, "the
experiment is likely to be somewhat monotonous. Meanwhile, we can
enjoy ourselves."</p>

<p>The whole party gathered round the table, and Denn appeared to
have been forgotten.</p>

<p>With one or two elastic motions he freed himself of his cords.
Then he pressed with all his force against the sides of the
coffin. Any attempt to escape that way was out of the question,
for the prisoners had absolutely no leverage, and the sheets of
glass were thick.</p>

<p>Through the grating overhead he could imagine queer figures
carved on the roof. It seemed to him that something was floating
like a sunbeam there. It was a little butterfly surely.</p>

<p>The butterfly came lower and lower, until it passed into the
uplifting blast of hot air rising from the coffin. Then the tiny
gauzy wings shrivelled up, and the insect came through the
grating and fluttered quivering down at Denn's feet. He took it
gently in his hand.</p>

<p>With a mighty effort he restrained the wild scream that rose
to his lips. He did not fear the advent of the scourge of Port
Indigo for himself--he had not breathed his vitiated atmosphere
long enough. But that for some member of the company death was at
hand he felt certain. For on the palm of his quaking hand lay a
yellow moth!</p>

<p>He was terribly, awfully frightened. Beyond the sides of his
crystal prison house he could see that something had happened to
check the flow of gaiety.</p>

<p>The picturesque group with one accord had stopped
conversation. They seemed to be watching something. High up in
the roof was a tiny, tangled yellow skein, alternately rising and
falling, and gradually becoming more vivid.</p>

<p>"The yellow moth," Macdona muttered, "whence came they?"</p>

<p>Nobody replied, because nobody knew.</p>

<p>Still, they were face to face with the yellow messengers at
last. A score of white faces were turned upwards. The Saffron
skin had broken like the bursting of a rocket, and the roof was
alive with ten thousand pairs of humming sulphur wings.</p>

<p>Two of the insects fell on Macdona's arm. With a shuddering
scream he jumped to his feet and shook them off.</p>

<p>"Dear heaven!" he yelled, "not that. Anything but that."</p>

<p>Macdona plunged forward, then fell headlong on the floor. He
seemed to be literally smothered with the deadly insects.</p>

<p>With a superhuman effort Macdona, thrashing wildly, freed
himself from his tormentors for a moment. In that short space of
time his features had undergone a strange transformation. His
face was black in vivid contrast to the pallid blue of his
lips.</p>

<p>Then, with one final yell like a chorus of despair from the
bottomless pit, Macdona fell forward on his face and moved no
more. A convulsive shudder ran through the assembly. The
fascinating horror of the situation rendered it deaf and blind to
anything short of cataclysm.</p>

<p>It was Denn's time, and seizing his revolver, he fired two
shots.</p>

<p>The glass crashed in a million fragments, and strange as it
may seem, the incident passed unnoticed. Denn saw that his fair
friend had made her way to the door. Like the rest of them, she
was awfully, horribly frightened, but some scattered grains of
wit yet remained. Denn crept over in her direction.</p>

<p>"See, I have opened the door," she whispered. "Go."</p>

<p>"And you?" Denn demanded.</p>

<p>The woman smiled bitterly, and pointed upwards.</p>

<p>"I must stay," she said. "If I am marked for a victim, I must
die. If not, I am safe here as anywhere else. Outside you may
find a guard or so who will bar your exit; if so, shoot them
down. Look."</p>

<p>Denn did look. As the woman spoke the room appeared to be
absolutely filled with a dense yellow smoke. There were millions
upon millions of the descending moths. It seemed that the whole
of that infamous company were destined to be exterminated. Denn
could hear an inferno of yells and cries, but nothing could be
seen but the saffron cloud.</p>

<p>Flesh and blood could stand it no longer. He groped his way
blindly to the door, and darted like a hare along the
corridor.</p>

<p>A few seconds later Denn was alone in the deserted street. He
could see the lights of the Maryland down in the harbour. Then he
noticed two little sulphur spots upon his coat.</p>

<p>They were two of the yellow moths. Denn promptly emptied a
match-box, and placed the tiny insects therein, then placed them
in his hat.</p>

<p>All the same, he sped down the deserted street, filled with a
desire to change Port Indigo for the gleaming deck of the
Maryland. Not till he was up to his neck in the sea did he feel
quite himself again. But fortune was kind, and a little later
Denn crept into his cabin.</p>

<p>It was late in the afternoon before he bethought himself of
the matchbox containing the yellow months. Sooner or later he
would want to produce those gruesome little curiosities. Denn
took them from his despatch-box, where he had placed them for
safety, and slid back the lid.</p>

<p>The box was absolutely empty! There was just a queer odour and
a suspicion of saffron powder, but that was all. Had these moths
been real, or were they a temporary miasma bred by the presence
of the yellow death? Denn did not feel called upon to decide.</p>

<p>"At any rate," he muttered, "when I come to tell this yarn I
shall get one distinction out of it. I shall be known as the boss
liar of the universe."</p>
