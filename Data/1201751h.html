<h3>I. The Shieling Of Farawa</h3>
<p>It was with a light heart and a pleasing consciousness of holiday that I set
out from the inn at Allermuir to tramp my fifteen miles into the unknown. I
walked slowly, for I carried my equipment on my back&mdash;my basket, fly-
books and rods, my plaid of Grant tartan (for I boast myself a distant kinsman
of that house), and my great staff, which had tried ere then the front of the
steeper Alps. A small valise with books and some changes of linen clothing had
been sent on ahead in the shepherd's own hands. It was yet early April, and
before me lay four weeks of freedom&mdash;twenty-eight blessed days in which to
take fish and smoke the pipe of idleness. The Lent term had pulled me down, a
week of modest enjoyment thereafter in town had finished the work; and I drank
in the sharp moorish air like a thirsty man who has been forwandered among
deserts.</p>
<p>I am a man of varied tastes and a score of interests. As an undergraduate I
had been filled with the old mania for the complete life. I distinguished
myself in the Schools, rowed in my college eight, and reached the distinction
of practising for three weeks in the Trials. I had dabbled in a score of
learned activities, and when the time came that I won the inevitable St. Chad's
fellowship on my chaotic acquirements, and I found myself compelled to select
if I would pursue a scholar's life, I had some toil in finding my vocation. In
the end I resolved that the ancient life of the North, of the Celts and the
Northmen and the unknown Pictish tribes, held for me the chief fascination. I
had acquired a smattering of Gaelic, having been brought up as a boy in
Lochaber, and now I set myself to increase my store of languages. I mastered
Erse and Icelandic, and my first book&mdash;a monograph on the probable Celtic
elements in the Eddie songs&mdash;brought me the praise of scholars and the
deputy-professor's chair of Northern Antiquities. So much for Oxford. My
vacations had been spent mainly in the North&mdash;in Ireland, Scotland, and
the Isles, in Scandinavia and Iceland, once even in the far limits of Finland.
I was a keen sportsman of a sort, an old-experienced fisher, a fair shot with
gun and rifle, and in my hillcraft I might well stand comparison with most men.
April has ever seemed to me the finest season of the year even in our cold
northern altitudes, and the memory of many bright Aprils had brought me up from
the South on the night before to Allerfoot, whence a dogcart had taken me up
Glen Aller to the inn at Allermuir; and now the same desire had set me on the
heather with my face to the cold brown hills.</p>
<p>You are to picture a sort of plateau, benty and rock-strewn, running
ridge-wise above a chain of little peaty lochs and a vast tract of inexorable
bog. In a mile the ridge ceased in a shoulder of hill, and over this lay the
head of another glen, with the same doleful accompaniment of sunless lochs,
mosses, and a shining and resolute water. East and west and north, in every
direction save the south, rose walls of gashed and serrated hills. It was a
grey day with blinks of sun, and when a ray chanced to fall on one of the great
dark faces, lines of light and colour sprang into being which told of mica and
granite. I was in high spirits, as on the eve of holiday; I had breakfasted
excellently on eggs and salmon-steaks; I had no cares to speak of, and my
prospects were not uninviting. But in spite of myself the landscape began to
take me in thrall and crush me. The silent vanished peoples of the hills seemed
to be stirring; dark primeval faces seemed to stare at me from behind boulders
and jags of rock. The place was so still, so free from the cheerful clamour of
nesting birds, that it seemed a temenos sacred to some old-world god. At my
feet the lochs lapped ceaselessly; but the waters were so dark that one could
not see bottom a foot from the edge. On my right the links of green told of
snakelike mires waiting to crush the unwary wanderer. It seemed to me for the
moment a land of death, where the tongues of the dead cried aloud for
recognition.</p>
<p>My whole morning's walk was full of such fancies. I lit a pipe to cheer me,
but the things would not be got rid of. I thought of the Gaels who had held
those fastnesses; I thought of the Britons before them, who yielded to their
advent. They were all strong peoples in their day, and now they had gone the
way of the earth. They had left their mark on the levels of the glens and on
the more habitable uplands, both in names and in actual forts, and graves where
men might still dig curios. But the hills&mdash;that black stony amphitheatre
before me&mdash;it seemed strange that the hills bore no traces of them. And
then with some uneasiness I reflected on that older and stranger race who were
said to have held the hill-tops. The Picts, the Picti&mdash;what in the name of
goodness were they? They had troubled me in all my studies, a sort of blank
wall to put an end to speculation. We knew nothing of them save certain strange
names which men called Pictish, the names of those hills in front of me&mdash;
the Muneraw, the Yirnie, the Calmarton. They were the corpus vile for learned
experiment; but Heaven alone knew what dark abyss of savagery once yawned in
the midst of the desert.</p>
<p>And then I remembered the crazy theories of a pupil of mine at St. Chad's,
the son of a small landowner on the Aller, a young gentleman who had spent his
substance too freely at Oxford, and was now dreeing his weird in the Backwoods.
He had been no scholar; but a certain imagination marked all his doings, and of
a Sunday night he would come and talk to me of the North. The Picts were his
special subject, and his ideas were mad. 'Listen to me,' he would say, when I
had mixed him toddy and given him one of my cigars; 'I believe there are
traces&mdash;ay, and more than traces&mdash;of an old culture lurking in those
hills and waiting to be discovered. We never hear of the Picts being driven
from the hills. The Britons drove them from the lowlands, the Gaels from
Ireland did the same for the Britons; but the hills were left unmolested. We
hear of no one going near them except outlaws and tinklers. And in that very
place you have the strangest mythology. Take the story of the Brownie. What is
that but the story of a little swart man of uncommon strength and cleverness,
who does good and ill indiscriminately, and then disappears. There are many
scholars, as you yourself confess, who think that the origin of the Brownie was
in some mad belief in the old race of the Picts, which still survived somewhere
in the hills. And do we not hear of the Brownie in authentic records right down
to the year 1756? After that, when people grew more incredulous, it is natural
that the belief should have begun to die out; but I do not see why stray traces
should not have survived till late.'</p>
<p>'Do you not see what that means?' I had said in mock gravity. 'Those same
hills are, if anything, less known now than they were a hundred years ago. Why
should not your Picts or Brownies be living to this day?'</p>
<p>'Why not, indeed?' he had rejoined, in all seriousness.</p>
<p>I laughed, and he went to his rooms and returned with a large leather- bound
book. It was lettered, in the rococo style of a young man's taste, 'Glimpses of
the Unknown,' and some of the said glimpses he proceeded to impart to me. It
was not pleasant reading; indeed, I had rarely heard anything so well fitted to
shatter sensitive nerves. The early part consisted of folk-tales and
folk-sayings, some of them wholly obscure, some of them with a glint of
meaning, but all of them with some hint of a mystery in the hills. I heard the
Brownie story in countless versions. Now the thing was a friendly little man,
who wore grey breeches and lived on brose; now he was a twisted being, the
sight of which made the ewes miscarry in the lambing-time. But the second part
was the stranger, for it was made up of actual tales, most of them with date
and place appended. It was a most Bedlamite catalogue of horrors, which, if
true, made the wholesome moors a place instinct with tragedy. Some told of
children carried away from villages, even from towns, on the verge of the
uplands. In almost every case they were girls, and the strange fact was their
utter disappearance. Two little girls would be coming home from school, would
be seen last by a neighbour just where the road crossed a patch of heath or
entered a wood, and then&mdash;no human eye ever saw them again. Children's
cries had startled outlying shepherds in the night, and when they had rushed to
the door they could hear nothing but the night wind. The instances of such
disappearances were not very common&mdash;perhaps once in twenty
years&mdash;but they were confined to this one tract of country, and came in a
sort of fixed progression from the middle of last century, when the record
began. But this was only one side of the history. The latter part was all
devoted to a chronicle of crimes which had gone unpunished, seeing that no hand
had ever been traced. The list was fuller in last century; in the earlier years
of the present it had dwindled; then came a revival about the 'fifties; and now
again in our own time it had sunk low. At the little cottage of Auchterbrean,
on the roadside in Glen Aller, a labourer's wife had been found pierced to the
heart. It was thought to be a case of a woman's jealousy, and her neighbour was
accused, convicted, and hanged. The woman, to be sure, denied the charge with
her last breath; but circumstantial evidence seemed sufficiently strong against
her. Yet some people in the glen believed her guiltless. In particular, the
carrier who had found the dead woman declared that the way in which her
neighbour received the news was a sufficient proof of innocence; and the doctor
who was first summoned professed himself unable to tell with what instrument
the wound had been given. But this was all before the days of expert evidence,
so the woman had been hanged without scruple. Then there had been another story
of peculiar horror, telling of the death of an old man at some little lonely
shieling called Carrickfey. But at this point I had risen in protest, and made
to drive the young idiot from my room.</p>
<p>'It was my grandfather who collected most of them,' he said. 'He had
theories,[*] but people called him mad, so he was wise enough to hold his
tongue. My father declares the whole thing mania; but I rescued the book had it
bound, and added to the collection. It is a queer hobby; but, as I say, I have
theories, and there are more things in heaven and earth&mdash;' But at this he
heard a friend's voice in the Quad., and dived out, leaving the banal quotation
unfinished.</p>
<p>[* In the light of subsequent events I have jotted down the materials to
which I refer. The last authentic record of the Brownie is in the narrative of
the shepherd of Clachlands, taken down towards the close of last century by the
Reverend Mr. Gillespie, minister of Allerkirk, and included by him in his
'Songs and Legends of Glen Aller'.</p>
<p>The authorities on the strange carrying-away of children are to be found in
a series of articles in a local paper, the Allerfoot Advertiser', September and
October 1878, and a curious book published anonymously at Edinburgh in 1848,
entitled 'The Weathergaw'. The records of the unexplained murders in the same
neighbourhood are all contained in Mr. Fordoun's 'Theory of Expert Evidence',
and an attack on the book in the 'Law Review' for June 1881. The Carrickfey
case has a pamphlet to itself&mdash;now extremely rare&mdash;a copy of which
was recently obtained in a bookseller's shop in Dumfries by a well-known
antiquary, and presented to the library of the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.]</p>
<p>Strange though it may seem, this madness kept coming back to me as I crossed
the last few miles of moor. I was now on a rough tableland, the watershed
between two lochs, and beyond and above me rose the stony backs of the hills.
The burns fell down in a chaos of granite boulders, and huge slabs of grey
stone lay flat and tumbled in the heather. The full waters looked prosperously
for my fishing, and I began to forget all fancies in anticipation of sport.</p>
<p>Then suddenly in a hollow of land I came on a ruined cottage. It had been a
very small place, but the walls were still half-erect, and the little moorland
garden was outlined on the turf. A lonely apple-tree, twisted and gnarled with
winds, stood in the midst.</p>
<p>From higher up on the hill I heard a loud roar, and I knew my excellent
friend the shepherd of Farawa, who had come thus far to meet me. He greeted me
with the boisterous embarrassment which was his way of prefacing hospitality. A
grave reserved man at other times, on such occasions he thought it proper to
relapse into hilarity. I fell into step with him, and we set off for his
dwelling. But first I had the curiosity to look back to the tumble-down cottage
and ask him its name.</p>
<p>A queer look came into his eyes. 'They ca' the place Carrickfey,' he said.
Naebody has daured to bide there this twenty year sin'&mdash;but I see ye ken
the story.' And, as if glad to leave the subject, he hastened to discourse on
fishing.</p>
<br>
<h3>II. Tells Of An Evening's Talk</h3>
<p>The shepherd was a masterful man; tall, save for the stoop which belongs to
all moorland folk, and active as a wild goat. He was not a new importation, nor
did he belong to the place; for his people had lived in the remote Borders, and
he had come as a boy to this shieling of Farawa. He was unmarried, but an
elderly sister lived with him and cooked his meals. He was reputed to be
extraordinarily skilful in his trade; I know for a fact that he was in his way
a keen sportsman; and his few neighbours gave him credit for a sincere piety.
Doubtless this last report was due in part to his silence, for after his first
greeting he was wont to relapse into a singular taciturnity. As we strode
across the heather he gave me a short outline of his year's lambing. 'Five pair
o' twins yestreen, twae this morn; that makes thirty-five yowes that hae lambed
since the Sabbath. I'll dae weel if God's willin'.' Then, as I looked towards
the hill-tops whence the thin mist of morn was trailing, he followed my gaze.
'See,' he said with uplifted crook&mdash;'see that sicht. Is that no what is
written of in the Bible when it says, "The mountains do smoke".' And with this
piece of apologeties he finished his talk, and in a little we were at the
cottage.</p>
<p>It was a small enough dwelling in truth, and yet large for a moorland house,
for it had a garret below the thatch, which was given up to my sole enjoyment.
Below was the wide kitchen with box-beds, and next to it the inevitable second
room, also with its cupboard sleeping-places. The interior was very clean, and
yet I remember to have been struck with the faint musty smell which is
inseparable from moorland dwellings. The kitchen pleased me best, for there the
great rafters were black with peat-reek, and the uncovered stone floor, on
which the fire gleamed dully, gave an air of primeval simplicity. But the walls
spoiled all, for tawdry things of to-day had penetrated even there. Some
grocers' almanacs&mdash;years old&mdash;hung in places of honour, and an
extraordinary lithograph of the Royal Family in its youth. And this, mind you,
between crooks and fishing-rods and old guns, and horns of sheep and deer.</p>
<p>The life for the first day or two was regular and placid. I was up early,
breakfasted on porridge (a dish which I detest), and then off to the lochs and
streams. At first my sport prospered mightily. With a drake-wing I killed a
salmon of seventeen pounds, and the next day had a fine basket of trout from a
hill-burn. Then for no earthly reason the weather changed. A bitter wind came
out of the north-east, bringing showers of snow and stinging hail, and lashing
the waters into storm. It was now farewell to fly-fishing. For a day or two I
tried trolling with the minnow on the lochs, but it was poor sport, for I had
no boat, and the edges were soft and mossy. Then in disgust I gave up the
attempt, went back to the cottage, lit my biggest pipe, and sat down with a
book to await the turn of the weather.</p>
<p>The shepherd was out from morning till night at his work, and when he came
in at last, dog-tired, his face would be set and hard, and his eyes heavy with
sleep. The strangeness of the man grew upon me. He had a shrewd brain beneath
his thatch of hair, for I had tried him once or twice, and found him abundantly
intelligent. He had some smattering of an education, like all Scottish
peasants, and, as I have said, he was deeply religious. I set him down as a
fine type of his class, sober, serious, keenly critical, free from the bondage
of superstition. But I rarely saw him, and our talk was chiefly in
monosyllables&mdash;short interjected accounts of the number of lambs dead or
alive on the hill. Then he would produce a pencil and notebook, and be immersed
in some calculation; and finally he would be revealed sleeping heavily in his
chair, till his sister wakened him, and he stumbled off to bed.</p>
<p>So much for the ordinary course of life; but one day&mdash;the second I
think of the bad weather&mdash;the extraordinary happened. The storm had passed
in the afternoon into a resolute and blinding snow, and the shepherd, finding
it hopeless on the hill, came home about three o'clock. I could make out from
his way of entering that he was in a great temper. He kicked his feet savagely
against the door-post. Then he swore at his dogs, a thing I had never heard him
do before. 'Hell!' he cried, 'can ye no keep out o' my road, ye britts?' Then
he came sullenly into the kitchen, thawed his numbed hands at the fire, and sat
down to his meal.</p>
<p>I made some aimless remark about the weather.</p>
<p>'Death to man and beast,' he grunted. 'I hae got the sheep doun frae the
hill, but the lambs will never thole this. We maun pray that it will no
last.'</p>
<p>His sister came in with some dish. 'Margit,' he cried, 'three lambs away
this morning, and three deid wi' the hole in the throat.'</p>
<p>The woman's face visibly paled. 'Guid help us, Adam; that hasna happened
this three year.'</p>
<p>'It has happened noo,' he said, surlily. 'But, by God! if it happens again
I'll gang mysel' to the Scarts o' the Muneraw.'</p>
<p>'0 Adam!' the woman cried shrilly, 'haud your tongue. Ye kenna wha hears
ye.' And with a frightened glance at me she left the room.</p>
<p>I asked no questions, but waited till the shepherd's anger should cool. But
the cloud did not pass so lightly. When he had finished his dinner he pulled
his chair to the fire and sat staring moodily. He made some sort of apology to
me for his conduct. 'I'm sore troubled, sir; but I'm vexed ye should see me
like this. Maybe things will be better the morn.' And then, lighting his short
black pipe, he resigned himself to his meditations.</p>
<p>But he could not keep quiet. Some nervous unrest seemed to have possessed
the man. He got up with a start and went to the window, where the snow was
drifting, unsteadily past. As he stared out into the storm I heard him mutter
to himself, 'Three away, God help me, and three wi' the hole in the
throat.'</p>
<p>Then he turned round to me abruptly. I was jotting down notes for an article
I contemplated in the 'Revue Celtique,' so my thoughts were far away from the
present. The man recalled me by demanding fiercely. 'Do ye believe in God?'</p>
<p>I gave him some sort of answer in the affirmative.</p>
<p>'Then do ye believe in the Devil?' he asked.</p>
<p>The reply must have been less satisfactory, for he came forward, and flung
himself violently into the chair before me.</p>
<p>'What do ye ken about it?' he cried. 'You that bides in a southern toun,
what can ye ken o' the God that works in thae hills and the Devil&mdash;ay, the
manifold devils&mdash;that He suffers to bide here? I tell ye, man, that if ye
had seen what I have seen ye wad be on your knees at this moment praying to God
to pardon your unbelief. There are devils at the back o' every stane and hidin'
in every cleuch, and it's by the grace o' God alone that a man is alive upon
the earth.' His voice had risen high and shrill, and then suddenly he cast a
frightened glance towards the window and was silent.</p>
<p>I began to think that the man's wits were unhinged, and the thought did not
give me satisfaction. I had no relish for the prospect of being left alone in
this moorland dwelling with the cheerful company of a maniac. But his next
movements reassured me. He was clearly only dead-tired, for he fell sound
asleep in his chair, and by the time his sister brought tea and wakened him, he
seemed to have got the better of his excitement.</p>
<p>When the window was shuttered and the lamp lit, I set myself again to the
completion of my notes. The shepherd had got out his Bible, and was solemnly
reading with one great finger travelling down the lines. He was smoking, and
whenever some text came home to him with power he would make pretence to
underline it with the end of the stem. Soon I had finished the work I desired,
and, my mind being full of my pet hobby, I fell into an inquisitive frame of
mind, and began to question the solemn man opposite on the antiquities of the
place.</p>
<p>He stared stupidly at me when I asked him concerning monuments or ancient
weapons.</p>
<p>'I kenna,' said he. 'There's a heap o' queer things in the hills.'</p>
<p>'This place should be a centre for such relics. You know that the name of
the hill behind the house, as far as I can make it out, means the "Place of the
Little Men." It is a good Gaelic word, though there is some doubt about its
exact interpretation. But clearly the Gaelic peoples did not speak of
themselves when they gave the name; they must have referred to some older and
stranger population.'</p>
<p>The shepherd looked at me dully, as not understanding.</p>
<p>'It is partly this fact&mdash;besides the fishing, of course&mdash; which
interests me in this countryside,' said I, gaily.</p>
<p>Again he cast the same queer frightened glance towards the window. 'If tak
the advice of an aulder man,' he said, slowly, 'yell let well alane and no
meddle wi' uncanny things.'</p>
<p>I laughed pleasantly, for at last I had found out my hard-headed host in a
piece of childishness. 'Why, I thought that you of all men would be free from
superstition.'</p>
<p>'What do ye call supersteetion?' he asked.</p>
<p>'A belief in old wives' tales,' said I, 'a trust in the crude supernatural
and the patently impossible.'</p>
<p>He looked at me beneath his shaggy brows. 'How do ye ken what is impossible?
Mind ye, sir, ye're no in the toun just now, but in the thick of the wild
hills.'</p>
<p>'But, hang it all, man,' I cried, 'you don't mean to say that you believe in
that sort of thing? I am prepared for many things up here, but not for the
Brownie,&mdash;though, to be sure, if one could meet him in the flesh, it would
be rather pleasant than otherwise, for he was a companionable sort of
fellow.'</p>
<p>'When a thing pits the fear o' death on a man he aye speaks well of it.'</p>
<p>It was true&mdash;the Eumenides and the Good Folk over again; and I awoke
with interest to the fact that the conversation was getting into strange
channels.</p>
<p>The shepherd moved uneasily in his chair. 'I am a man that fears God, and
has nae time for daft stories; but I havena traivelled the hills for twenty
years wi' my een shut. If I say that I could tell ye stories o' faces seen in
the mist, and queer things that have knocked against me in the snaw, wad ye
believe me? I wager ye wadna. Ye wad say I had been drunk, and yet I am a God-
fearing temperate man.'</p>
<p>He rose and went to a cupboard, unlocked it, and brought out something in
his hand, which he held out to me. I took it with some curiosity, and found
that it was a flint arrow-head.</p>
<p>Clearly a flint arrow-head, and yet like none that I had ever seen in any
collection. For one thing it was larger, and the barb less clumsily thick.
More, the chipping was new, or comparatively so; this thing had not stood the
wear of fifteen hundred years among the stones of the hillside. Now there are,
I regret to say, institutions which manufacture primitive relics; but it is not
hard for a practised eye to see the difference. The chipping has either a
regularity and a balance which is unknown in the real thing, or the rudeness
has been overdone, and the result is an implement incapable of harming a mortal
creature. But this was the real thing if it ever existed; and yet&mdash;I was
prepared to swear on my reputation that it was not half a century old.</p>
<p>'Where did you get this?' I asked with some nervousness.</p>
<p>'I hae a story about that,' said the shepherd. 'Outside the door there ye
can see a muckle flat stane aside the buchts. One simmer nicht I was sitting
there smoking till the dark, and I wager there was naething on the stane then.
But that same nicht I awoke wi' a queer thocht, as if there were folk moving
around the hoose&mdash;folk that didna mak' muckle noise. I mind o' lookin' out
o' the windy, and I could hae sworn I saw something black movin' amang the
heather and intil the buchts. Now I had maybe threescore o' lambs there that
nicht, for I had to tak' them many miles off in the early morning. Weel, when I
gets up about four o'clock and gangs out, as I am passing the muckle stane I
finds this bit errow. "That's come here in the nicht," says I, and I wunnered a
wee and put it in my pouch. But when I came to my faulds what did I see? Five
o' my best hoggs were away, and three mair were lying deid wi' a hole in their
throat.'</p>
<p>'Who in the world&mdash;?' I began.</p>
<p>Dinna ask,' said he. 'If I aince sterted to speir about thae maitters, I
wadna keep my reason.'</p>
<p>'Then that was what happened on the hill this morning?'</p>
<p>'Even sae, and it has happened mair than aince sin' that time. It's the most
uncanny slaughter, for sheep-stealing I can understand, but no this pricking o'
the puir beasts' wizands. I kenna how they dae't either, for it's no wi' a
knife or ony common tool.'</p>
<p>'Have you never tried to follow the thieves?'</p>
<p>'Have I no?' he asked, grimly. 'Hit had been common sheep-stealers I wad hae
had them by the heels, though I had followed them a hundred miles. But this is
no common. I've tracked them, and it's ill they are to track; but I never got
beyond ae place, and that was the Scarts o' the Muneraw that ye've heard me
speak o'.'</p>
<p>'But who in Heaven's name are the people? Tinklers or poachers or what?'</p>
<p>'Ay,' said he, drily. 'Even so. Tinklers and poachers whae wark wi' stane
errows and kill sheep by a hole in their throat. Lord, I kenna what they are,
unless the Muckle Deil himsel'.'</p>
<p>The conversation had passed beyond my comprehension. In this prosaic hard-
headed man I had come on the dead-rock of superstition and blind fear.</p>
<p>'That is only the story of the Brownie over again, and he is an exploded
myth,' I said, laughing.</p>
<p>'Are ye the man that exploded it?' said the shepherd, rudely. 'I trow no,
neither you nor ony ither. My bonny man, if ye lived a twalmonth in thae hills,
ye wad sing safter about exploded myths, as ye call them.'</p>
<p>'I tell you what I would do,' said I. 'If I lost sheep as you lose them, I
would go up the Scarts of the Muneraw and never rest till I had settled the
question once and for all.' I spoke hotly, for I was vexed by the man's
childish fear.</p>
<p>'I daresay ye wad,' he said, slowly. 'But then I am no you, and maybe I ken
mair o' what is in the Scarts o' the Muneraw. Maybe I ken that whilk, if ye
kenned it, wad send ye back to the South Country wi' your hert in your mouth.
But, as I say, I am no sae brave as you, for I saw something in the first year
o' my herding here which put the terror o' God on me, and makes me a fearfu'
man to this day. Ye ken the story o' the gudeman o' Carrickfey?'</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>Weel, I was the man that fand him. I had seen the deid afore and I've seen
them since. But never have I seen aucht like the look in that man's een. What
he saw at his death I may see the morn, so I walk before the Lord in fear.'</p>
<p>Then he rose and stretched himself. 'It's bedding-time, for I maun be up at
three,' and with a short good night he left the room.</p>
<br>
<h3>III. The Scarts Of The Muneraw</h3>
<p>The next morning was fine, for the snow had been intermittent, and had soon
melted except in the high corries. True, it was deceptive weather, for the wind
had gone to the rainy south-west, and the masses of cloud on that horizon boded
ill for the afternoon. But some days' inaction had made me keen for a chance of
sport, so I rose with the shepherd and set out for the day.</p>
<p>He asked me where I proposed to begin.</p>
<p>I told him the tarn called the Loch o' the Threshes, which lies over the
back of the Muneraw on another watershed. It is on the ground of the Rhynns
Forest, and I had fished it of old from the Forest House. I knew the merits of
the trout, and I knew its virtues in a south-west wind, so I had resolved to go
thus far afield.</p>
<p>The shepherd heard the name in silence. 'Your best road will be ower that
rig, and syne on to the water o' Caulds. Keep abune the moss till ye come to
the place they ca' the Nick o' the Threshes. That will take ye to the very
lochside, but it's a lang road and a sair.'</p>
<p>The morning was breaking over the bleak hills. Little clouds drifted athwart
the corries, and wisps of haze fluttered from the peaks. A great rosy flush lay
over one side of the glen, which caught the edge of the sluggish bog- pools and
turned them to fire. Never before had I seen the mountain-land so clear, for
far back into the east and west I saw mountain-tops set as close as flowers in
a border, black crags seamed with silver lines which I knew for mighty
waterfalls, and below at my feet the lower slopes fresh with the dewy green of
spring. A name stuck in my memory from the last night's talk.</p>
<p>'Where are the Scarts of the Muneraw?' I asked.</p>
<p>The shepherd pointed to the great hill which bears the name, and which lies,
a huge mass, above the watershed.</p>
<p>'D'ye see yon corrie at the east that runs straucht up the side? It looks a
bit scart, but it's sae deep that it's aye derk at the bottom o't. Weel, at the
tap o' the rig it meets anither corrie that runs doun the ither side, and that
one they ca' the Scarts. There is a sort o' burn in it that flows intil the
Dule and sae intil the Aller, and, indeed, if ye were gaun there it wad be from
Aller Glen that your best road wad lie. But it's an ill bit, and ye'll be sair
guidit if ye try't.'</p>
<p>There he left me and went across the glen, while I struck upwards over the
ridge. At the top I halted and looked down on the wide glen of the Caulds,
which there is little better than a bog, but lower down grows into a green
pastoral valley. The great Muneraw still dominated the landscape, and the black
scaur on its side seemed blacker than before. The place fascinated me, for in
that fresh morning air the shepherd's fears seemed monstrous. 'Some day,' said
I to myself, 'I will go and explore the whole of that mighty hill.' Then I
descended and struggled over the moss, found the Nick, and in two hours' time
was on the loch's edge.</p>
<p>I have little in the way of good to report of the fishing. For perhaps one
hour the trout took well; after that they sulked steadily for the day. The
promise, too, of fine weather had been deceptive. By midday the rain was
falling in that soft soaking fashion which gives no hope of clearing. The mist
was down to the edge of the water, and I cast my flies into a blind sea of
white. It was hopeless work, and yet from a sort of ill-temper I stuck to it
long after my better judgment had warned me of its folly. At last, about three
in the afternoon, I struck my camp, and prepared myself for a long and toilsome
retreat.</p>
<p>And long and toilsome it was beyond anything I had ever encountered. Had I
had a vestige of sense I would have followed the burn from the loch down to the
Forest House. The place was shut up, but the keeper would gladly have given me
shelter for the night. But foolish pride was too strong in me. I had found my
road in mist before, and could do it again.</p>
<p>Before I got to the top of the hill I had repented my decision; when I got
there I repented it more. For below me was a dizzy chaos of grey; there was no
landmark visible; and before me I knew was the bog through which the Caulds
Water twined. I had crossed it with some trouble in the morning, but then I had
light to pick my steps. Now I could only stumble on, and in five minutes I
might be in a bog-hole, and in five more in a better world.</p>
<p>But there was no help to be got from hesitation, so with a rueful courage I
set off. The place was if possible worse than I had feared. Wading up to the
knees with nothing before you but a blank wall of mist and the cheerful
consciousness that your next step may be your last&mdash;such was my state for
one weary mile. The stream itself was high, and rose to my armpits, and once
and again I only saved myself by a violent leap backwards from a pitiless green
slough. But at last it was past, and I was once more on the solid ground of the
hillside.</p>
<p>Now, in the thick weather I had crossed the glen much lower down than in the
morning, and the result was that the hill on which I stood was one of the
giants which, with the Muneraw for centre, guard the watershed. Had I taken the
proper way, the Nick o' the Threshes would have led me to the Caulds, and then
once over the bog a little ridge was all that stood between me and the glen of
Farawa. But instead I had come a wild cross-country road, and was now, though I
did not know it, nearly as far from my destination as at the start.</p>
<p>Well for me that I did not know, for I was wet and dispirited, and had I not
fancied myself all but home, I should scarcely have had the energy to make this
last ascent. But soon I found it was not the little ridge I had expected. I
looked at my watch and saw that it was five o'clock. When, after the weariest
climb, I lay on a piece of level ground which seemed the top, I was not
surprised to find that it was now seven. The darkening must be at hand, and
sure enough the mist seemed to be deepening into a greyish black. I began to
grow desperate. Here was I on the summit of some infernal mountain, without any
certainty where my road lay. I was lost with a vengeance, and at the thought I
began to be acutely afraid.</p>
<p>I took what seemed to me the way I had come, and began to descend steeply.
Then something made me halt, and the next instant I was lying on my face trying
painfully to retrace my steps. For I had found myself slipping, and before I
could stop, my feet were dangling over a precipice with Heaven alone knows how
many yards of sheer mist between me and the bottom. Then I tried keeping the
ridge, and took that to the right, which I thought would bring me nearer home.
It was no good trying to think out a direction, for in the fog my brain was
running round, and I seemed to stand on a pin-point of space where the laws of
the compass had ceased to hold.</p>
<p>It was the roughest sort of walking, now stepping warily over acres of loose
stones, now crawling down the face of some battered rock, and now wading in the
long dripping heather. The soft rain had begun to fall again, which completed
my discomfort. I was now seriously tired, and, like all men who in their day
have bent too much over books, I began to feel it in my back. My spine ached,
and my breath came in short broken pants. It was a pitiable state of affairs
for an honest man who had never encountered much grave discomfort. To ease
myself I was compelled to leave my basket behind me, trusting to return and
find it, if I should ever reach safety and discover on what pathless hill I had
been strayed. My rod I used as a staff, but it was of little use, for my
fingers were getting too numb to hold it.</p>
<p>Suddenly from the blankness I heard a sound as of human speech. At first I
thought it mere craziness&mdash;the cry of a weasel or a hill-bird distorted by
my ears. But again it came, thick and faint, as through acres of mist, and yet
clearly the sound of 'articulate-speaking men.' In a moment I lost my despair
and cried out in answer. This was some forwandered traveller like myself, and
between us we could surely find some road to safety. So I yelled back at the
pitch of my voice and waited intently.</p>
<p>But the sound ceased, and there was utter silence again. Still I waited, and
then from some place much nearer came the same soft mumbling speech. I could
make nothing of it. Heard in that drear place it made the nerves tense and the
heart timorous. It was the strangest jumble of vowels and consonants I had ever
met.</p>
<p>A dozen solutions flashed through my brain. It was some maniac talking
Jabberwock to himself. It was some belated traveller whose wits had given out
in fear. Perhaps it was only some shepherd who was amusing himself thus, and
whiling the way with nonsense. Once again I cried out and waited.</p>
<p>Then suddenly in the hollow trough of mist before me, where things could
still be half discerned, there appeared a figure. It was little and squat and
dark; naked, apparently, but so rough with hair that it wore the appearance of
a skin-covered being. It crossed my line of vision, not staying for a moment,
but in its face and eyes there seemed to lurk an elder world of mystery and
barbarism, a troll-like life which was too horrible for words.</p>
<p>The shepherd's fear came back on me like a thunderclap. For one awful
instant my legs failed me, and I had almost fallen. The next I had turned and
ran shrieking up the hill.</p>
<p>If he who may read this narrative has never felt the force of an
overmastering terror, then let him thank his Maker and pray that he never may.
I am no weak child, but a strong grown man, accredited in general with sound
sense and little suspected of hysterics. And yet I went up that brae-face with
my heart fluttering like a bird and my throat aching with fear. I screamed in
short dry gasps; involuntarily, for my mind was beyond any purpose. I felt that
beast-like clutch at my throat; those red eyes seemed to be staring at me from
the mist; I heard ever behind and before and on all sides the patter of those
inhuman feet.</p>
<p>Before I knew I was down, slipping over a rock and falling some dozen feet
into a soft marshy hollow. I was conscious of lying still for a second and
whimpering like a child. But as I lay there I awoke to the silence of the
place. There was no sound of pursuit; perhaps they had lost my track and given
up. My courage began to return, and from this it was an easy step to hope.
Perhaps after all it had been merely an illusion, for folk do not see clearly
in the mist, and I was already done with weariness.</p>
<p>But even as I lay in the green moss and began to hope, the faces of my
pursuers grew up through the mist. I stumbled madly to my feet; but I was
hemmed in, the rock behind and my enemies before. With a cry I rushed forward,
and struck wildly with my rod at the first dark body. It was as if I had struck
an animal, and the next second the thing was wrenched from my grasp. But still
they came no nearer. I stood trembling there in the centre of those malignant
devils, my brain a mere weathercock, and my heart crushed shapeless with
horror. At last the end came, for with the vigour of madness I flung myself on
the nearest, and we rolled on the ground. Then the monstrous things seemed to
close over me, and with a choking cry I passed into unconsciousness.</p>
<br>
<h3>IV. The Darkness That Is Under The Earth</h3>
<p>There is an unconsciousness that is not wholly dead, where a man feels
numbly and the body lives without the brain. I was beyond speech or thought,
and yet I felt the upward or downward motion as 'the way lay in hill or glen,
and I most assuredly knew when the open air was changed for the close
underground. I could feel dimly that lights were flared in my face, and that I
was laid in some bed on the earth. Then with the stopping of movement the real
sleep of weakness seized me, and for long I knew nothing of this mad world.</p>
<p>Morning came over the moors with bird-song and the glory of fine weather.
The streams were still rolling in spate, but the hill-pastures were alight with
dawn, and the little seams of snow glistened like white fire. A ray from the
sunrise cleft its path somehow into the abyss, and danced on the wall above my
couch. It caught my eye as I wakened, and for long I lay crazily wondering what
it meant. My head was splitting with pain, and in my heart was the same
fluttering nameless fear. I did not wake to full consciousness; not till the
twinkle of sun from the clean bright out-of-doors caught my senses did I
realise that I lay in a great dark place with a glow of dull firelight in the
middle.</p>
<p>In time things rose and moved around me, a few ragged shapes of men, without
clothing, shambling with their huge feet and looking towards me with curved
beast-like glances. I tried to marshal my thoughts, and slowly, bit by bit, I
built up the present. There was no question to my mind of dreaming; the past
hours had scored reality upon my brain. Yet I cannot say that fear was my chief
feeling. The first crazy terror had subsided, and now I felt mainly a sickened
disgust with just a tinge of curiosity. I found that my knife, watch, flask,
and money had gone, but they had left me a map of the countryside. It seemed
strange to look at the calico, with the name of a London printer stamped on the
back, and lines of railway and highroad running through every shire. Decent and
comfortable civilisation! And here was I a prisoner in this den of nameless
folk, and in the midst of a life which history knew not.</p>
<p>Courage is a virtue which grows with reflection and the absence of the
immediate peril. I thought myself into some sort of resolution, and lo! when
the Folk approached me and bound my feet I was back at once in the most
miserable terror. They tied me all but my hands with some strong cord, and
carried me to the centre,' where the fire was glowing. Their soft touch was the
acutest torture to my nerves, but I stifled my cries lest some one should lay
his hand on my mouth. Had that happened, I am convinced my reason would have
failed me.</p>
<p>So there I lay in the shine of the fire, with the circle of unknown things
around me. There seemed but three or four, but I took no note of number. They
talked huskily among themselves in a tongue which sounded all gutturals. Slowly
my fear became less an emotion than a habit, and I had room for the smallest
shade of curiosity. I strained my ear to catch a word, but it was a mere chaos
of sound. The thing ran and thundered in my brain as I stared dumbly into the
vacant air. Then I thought that unless I spoke I should certainly go crazy, for
my head was beginning to swim at the strange cooing noise.</p>
<p>I spoke a word or two in my best Gaelic, and they closed round me
inquiringly. Then I was sorry I had spoken, for my words had brought them
nearer, and I shrank at the thought. But as the faint echoes of my speech
hummed in the rock-chamber, I was struck by a curious kinship of sound. Mine
was sharper, more distinct, and staccato; theirs was blurred, formless, but
still with a certain root-resemblance.</p>
<p>Then from the back there came an older being, who seemed to have heard my
words. He was like some foul grey badger, his red eyes sightless, and his hands
trembling on a stump of bog-oak. The others made way for him with such
deference as they were capable of, and the thing squatted down by me and
spoke.</p>
<p>To my amazement his words were familiar. It was some manner of speech akin
to the Gaelic, but broadened, lengthened, coarsened. I remembered an old
book-tongue, commonly supposed to be an impure dialect once used in Brittany,
which I had met in the course of my researches. The words recalled it, and as
far as I could remember the thing, I asked him who he was and where the place
might be.</p>
<p>He answered me in the same speech&mdash;still more broadened, lengthened,
coarsened. I lay back with sheer amazement. I had found the key to this
unearthly life.&mdash;</p>
<p>For a little an insatiable curiosity, the ardour of the scholar, prevailed.
I forgot the horror of the place, and thought only of the fact that here before
me was the greatest find that scholarship had ever made. I was precipitated
into the heart of the past. Here must be the fountainhead of all legends, the
chrysalis of all beliefs. I actually grew light-hearted. This strange folk
around me were now no more shapeless things of terror, but objects of research
and experiment. I almost came to think them not unfriendly.</p>
<p>For an hour I enjoyed the highest of earthly pleasures. In that strange
conversation I heard&mdash;in fragments and suggestions&mdash;the history of
the craziest survival the world has ever seen. I heard of the struggles with
invaders, preserved as it were in a sort of shapeless poetry. There were bitter
words against the Gaelic oppressor, bitterer words against the Saxon stranger,
and for a moment ancient hatreds flared into life. Then there came the tale of
the hill-refuge, the morbid hideous existence preserved for centuries amid a
changing world. I heard fragments of old religions, primeval names of god and
goddess, half-understood by the Folk, but to me the key to a hundred puzzles.
Tales which survive to us in broken disjointed riddles were intact here in
living form. I lay on my elbow and questioned feverishly. At any moment they
might become morose and refuse to speak. Clearly it was my duty to make the
most of a brief good fortune.</p>
<p>And then the tale they told me grew more hideous. I heard of the
circumstances of the life itself and their daily shifts for existence. It was a
murderous chronicle&mdash;a history of lust and rapine and unmentionable deeds
in the darkness. One thing they had early recognised&mdash;that the race could
not be maintained within itself; so that ghoulish carrying away of little girls
from the lowlands began, which I had heard of but never credited. Shut up in
those dismal holes, the girls soon died, and when the new race had grown up the
plunder had been repeated. Then there were bestial murders in lonely cottages,
done for God knows what purpose. Sometimes the occupant had seen more than was
safe, sometimes the deed was the mere exuberance of a lust of slaying. As they
abbled their tales my heart's blood froze, and I lay back in the agonie of
fear. If they had used the others thus, what way of escape was op n for myself?
I had been brought to this place, and not murdered on the spot. Clearly there
was torture before death in store for me, and I confess I quailed at the
thought.</p>
<p>But none molested me. The elders continued to jabber out their stories,
while I lay tense and deaf. Then to my amazement food was brought and placed
beside me&mdash;almost with respect. Clearly my murder was not a thing of the
immediate future. The meal was some form of mutton&mdash;perhaps the shepherd's
lost ewes&mdash;and a little smoking was all the cooking it had got. I strove
to eat, but the tasteless morsels choked me. Then they set drink before me in a
curious cup, which I seized on eagerly, for my mouth was dry with thirst. The
vessel was of gold, rudely formed, but of the pure metal, and a coarse design
in circles ran round the middle. This surprised me enough, but a greater wonder
awaited me. The liquor was not water, as I had guessed, but a sort of sweet
ale, a miracle of flavour. The taste was curious, but somehow familiar; it was
like no wine I had ever drunk, and yet I had known that flavour all my life. I
sniffed at the brim, and there rose a faint fragrance of thyme and heather
honey and the sweet things of the moorland. I almost dropped the thing in my
surprise; for here in this rude place I had stumbled upon that lost delicacy of
the North, the heather ale.</p>
<p>For a second I was entranced with my discovery, and then the wonder of the
cup claimed my attention. Was it a mere relic of pillage, or had this folk some
hidden mine of the precious metal? Gold had once been common in these hills.
There were the traces of mines on Cairnsmore; shepherds had found it in the
gravel of the Gled Water; and the name of a house at the head of the Clachlands
meant the 'Home of Gold.'</p>
<p>Once more I began my questions, and they answered them willingly. There and
then I heard that secret for which many had died in old time, the secret of the
heather ale. They told of the gold in the hills, of corries where the sand
gleamed and abysses where the rocks were veined. All this they told me, freely,
without a scruple. And then, like a clap, came the awful thought that this,
too, spelled death. These were secrets which this race aforetime had guarded
with their lives; they told them generously to me because there was no fear of
betrayal. I should go no more out from this place.</p>
<p>The thought put me into a new sweat of terror&mdash;not at death, mind you,
but at the unknown horrors which might precede the final suffering. I lay
silent, and after binding my hands they began to leave me and go off to other
parts of the cave. I dozed in the horrible half-swoon of fear, conscious only
of my shaking limbs, and the great dull glow of the fire in the centre. Then I
became calmer. After all, they had treated me with tolerable kindness: I had
spoken their language, which few of their victims could have done for many a
century; it might be that I found favour in their eyes. For a little I
comforted myself with this delusion, till I caught sight of a wooden box in a
corner. It was of modern make, one such as grocers use to pack provisions in.
It had some address nailed on it, and an aimless curiosity compelled me to
creep thither and read it. A torn and weather-stained scrap of paper, with the
nails at the corner rusty with age; but something of the address might still be
made out. Amid the stains my feverish eyes read, 'To Mr. M&mdash;Carrickfey, by
Allerfoot Station.'</p>
<p>The ruined cottage in the hollow of the waste with the single gnarled
apple-tree was before me in a twinkling. I remembered the shepherd's shrinking
from the place and the name, and his wild eyes when he told me of the thing
that had happened there. I seemed to see the old man in his moorland cottage,
thinking no evil; the sudden entry of the nameless things; and then the eyes
glazed in unspeakable terror. I felt my lips dry and burning. Above me was the
vault of rock; in the distance I saw the fire-glow and the shadows of shapes
moving around it. My fright was too great for inaction, so I crept from the
couch, and silently, stealthily, with tottering steps and bursting heart, I
began to reconnoitre.</p>
<p>But I was still bound, my arms tightly, my legs more loosely, but yet firm
enough to hinder flight. I could not get my hands at my leg-straps, still less
could I undo the manacles. I rolled on the floor, seeking some sharp edge of
rock, but all had been worn smooth by the use of centuries. Then suddenly an
idea came upon me like an inspiration. The sounds from the fire seemed to have
ceased, and I could hear them repeated from another and more distant part of
the cave. The Folk had left their orgy round the blaze, and at the end of the
long tunnel I saw its glow fall unimpeded upon the floor. Once there, I might
burn off my fetters and be free to turn my thoughts to escape.</p>
<p>I crawled a little way with much labour. Then suddenly I came abreast an
opening in the wall, through which a path went. It was a long straight rock-
cutting, and at the end I saw a gleam of pale light. It must be the open air;
the way of escape was prepared for me; and with a prayer I made what speed I
could towards the fire.</p>
<p>I rolled on the verge, but the fuel was peat, and the warm ashes would not
burn the cords. In desperation I went farther, and my clothes began to singe,
while my face ached beyond endurance. But yet I got no nearer my object. The
strips of hide warped and cracked, but did not burn. Then in a last effort I
thrust my wrists bodily into the glow and held them there. In an instant I drew
them out with a groan of pain, scarred and sore, but to my joy with the band
snapped in one place. Weak as I was, it was now easy to free myself, and then
came the untying of my legs. My hands trembled, my eyes were dazed with hurry,
and I was longer over the job than need have been. But at length I had loosed
my cramped knees and stood on my feet, a free man once more.</p>
<p>I kicked off my boots, and fled noiselessly down the passage to the tunnel
mouth. Apparently it was close on evening, for the white light had faded to a
pale yellow. But it was daylight, and that was all I sought, and I ran for it
as eagerly as ever runner ran to a goal. I came out on a rock-shelf, beneath
which a moraine of boulders fell away in a chasm to a dark loch. It was all but
night, but I could see the gnarled and fortressed rocks rise in ramparts above,
and below the unknown screes and cliffs which make the side of the Muneraw a
place only for foxes and the fowls of the air.</p>
<p>The first taste of liberty is an intoxication, and assuredly I was mad when
I leaped down among the boulders. Happily at the top of the gully the stones
were large and stable, else the noise would certainly have discovered me. Down
I went, slipping, praying, my charred wrists aching, and my stockinged feet wet
with blood. Soon I was in the jaws of the cleft, and a pale star rose before
me. I have always been timid in the face of great rocks, and now, had not an
awful terror been dogging my footsteps, no power on earth could have driven me
to that descent. Soon I left the boulders behind, and came to long spouts of
little stones, which moved with me till the hillside seemed sinking under my
feet. Sometimes I was face downwards, once and again I must have fallen for
yards. Had there been a cliff at the foot, I should have gone over it without
resistance; but by the providence of God the spout ended in a long curve into
the heather of the bog.</p>
<p>When I found my feet once more on soft boggy earth, my strength was renewed
within me. A great hope of escape sprang up in my heart. For a second I looked
back. There was a great line of shingle with the cliffs beyond, and above all
the unknown blackness of the cleft. There lay my terror, and I set off running
across the bog for dear life. My mind was clear enough to know my road. If I
held round the loch in front I should come to a burn which fed the Farawa
stream, on whose banks stood the shepherd's cottage. The loch could not be far;
once at the Farawa I would have the light of the shieling clear before me.</p>
<p>Suddenly I heard behind me, as if coming from the hillside, the patter of
feet. It was the sound which white hares make in the winter-time on a noiseless
frosty day as they patter over the snow. I have heard the same soft noise from
a herd of deer when they changed their pastures. Strange that so kindly a sound
should put the very fear of death in my heart. I ran madly, blindly, yet
thinking shrewdly. The loch was before me. Somewhere I had read or heard, I do
not know where, that the brutish aboriginal races of the North could not swim.
I myself swam powerfully; could I but cross the loch I should save two miles of
a desperate country.</p>
<p>There was no time to lose, for the patter was coming nearer, and I was
almost at the loch's edge. I tore off my coat and rushed in. The bottom was
mossy, and I had to struggle far before I found any depth. Something plashed in
the water before me, and then something else a little behind. The thought that
I was a mark for unknown missiles made me crazy with fright, and I struck
fiercely out for the other shore. A gleam of moonlight was on the water at the
burn's exit, and thither I guided myself. I found the thing difficult enough in
itself, for my hands ached, and I was numb with my bonds. But my fancy raised a
thousand phantoms to vex me. Swimming in that black bog water, pursued by those
nameless things, I seemed to be in a world of horror far removed from the
kindly world of men. My strength seemed inexhaustible from my terror. Monsters
at the bottom of the water seemed to bite at my feet, and the pain of my wrists
made me believe that the loch was boiling hot, and that I was in some hellish
place of torment.</p>
<p>I came out on a spit of gravel above the burn mouth, and set off down the
ravine of the burn. It was a strait place, strewn with rocks; but now and then
the hill turf came in stretches, and eased my wounded feet. Soon the fall
became more abrupt, and I was slippingdown a hillside, with the water on my
left making great cascades in the granite. And then I was out in the wider vale
where the Farawa water flowed among links of moss.</p>
<p>Far in front, a speck in the blue darkness shone the light of the cottage. I
panted forward, my breath coming in gasps and my back shot with fiery pains.
Happily the land was easier for the feet as long as I kept on the skirts of the
bog. My ears were sharp as a wild beast's with fear, as I listened for the
noise of pursuit. Nothing came but the rustle of the gentlest hill-wind and the
chatter of the falling streams.</p>
<p>Then suddenly the light began to waver and move athwart the window. I knew
what it meant. In a minute or two the household at the cottage would retire to
rest, and the lamp would be put out. True, I might find the place in the dark,
for there was a moon of sorts and the road was not desperate. But somehow in
that hour the lamplight gave a promise of safety which I clung to
despairingly.</p>
<p>And then the last straw was added to my misery. Behind me came the pad of
feet, the pat-patter, soft, eerie, incredibly swift. I choked with fear, and
flung myself forward in a last effort. I give my word it was sheer mechanical
shrinking that drove me on. God knows I would have lain down to die in the
heather, had the things behind me been a common terror of life.</p>
<p>I ran as man never ran before, leaping hags, scrambling through green
well-heads, straining towards the fast-dying light. A quarter of a mile and the
patter sounded nearer. Soon I was not two hundred yards off, and the noise
seemed almost at my elbow. The light went out, and the black mass of the
cottage loomed in the dark.</p>
<p>Then, before I knew, I was at the door, battering it wearily and yelling for
help. I heard steps within and a hand on the bolt. Then something shot past me
with lightning force and buried itself in the wood. The dreadful hands were
almost at my throat, when the door was opened and I stumbled in, hearing with a
gulp of joy the key turn and the bar fall behind me.</p>
<br>
<h3>V. The Troubles Of A Conscience</h3>
<p>My body and senses slept, for I was utterly tired, but my brain all the
night was on fire with horrid fancies. Again I was in that accursed cave; I was
torturing my hands in the fire; I was slipping barefoot among jagged boulders;
and then with bursting heart I was toiling the last mile with the cottage
light&mdash;now grown to a great fire in the heavens&mdash;blazing before
me.</p>
<p>It was broad daylight when I awoke, and I thanked God for the comfortable
rays of the sun. I had been laid in a box-bed off the inner room, and my first
sight was the shepherd sitting with folded arms in a chair regarding me
solemnly. I rose and began to dress, feeling my legs and arms still tremble
with weariness. The shepherd's sister bound up my scarred wrists and put an
ointment on my burns; and limping like an old man, I went into the kitchen.</p>
<p>I could eat little breakfast, for my throat seemed dry and narrow; but they
gave me some brandy-and-milk, which put strength into my body. All the time the
brother and sister sat in silence, regarding me with covert glances.</p>
<p>'Ye have been delivered from the jaws o' the Pit,' said the man at length.
'See that,' and he held out to me a thin shaft of flint. 'I fand that in the
door this morning.'</p>
<p>I took it, let it drop, and stared vacantly at the window. My nerves had
been too much tried to be roused by any new terror. Out of doors it was fair
weather, flying gleams of April sunlight and the soft colours of spring. I felt
dazed, isolated, cut off from my easy past and pleasing future, a companion of
horrors and the sport of nameless things. Then suddenly my eye fell on my books
heaped on a table, and the old distant civilisation seemed for the moment
inexpressibly dear.</p>
<p>'I must go&mdash;at once. And you must come too. You cannot stay here. I
tell you it is death. If you knew what I know you would be crying out with
fear. How far is it to Allermuir? Eight, fifteen miles; and then ten down Glen
Aller to Allerfoot, and then the railway. We must go together while it is
daylight, and perhaps we may be untouched. But quick, there is not a moment to
lose.' And I was on my shaky feet, and bustling among my possessions.</p>
<p>'I'll gang wi' ye to the station,' said the shepherd, 'for ye're clearly no
fit to look after yourself. My sister will bide and keep the house. If naething
has touched us this ten year, naething will touch us the day.'</p>
<p>'But you cannot stay. You are mad,' I began; but he cut me short with the
words, 'I trust in God.'</p>
<p>'In any case let your sister come with us. I dare not think of a woman alone
in this place.'</p>
<p>'I'll bide,' said she. 'I'm no feared as lang as I'm indoors and there's
steeks on the windies.'</p>
<p>So I packed my few belongings as best I could, tumbled my books into a
haversack, and, gripping the shepherd's arm nervously, crossed the threshold.
The glen was full of sunlight. There lay the long shining links of the Farawa
burn, the rough hills tumbled beyond, and far over all the scarred and distant
forehead of the Muneraw. I had always looked on moorland country as the
freshest on earth&mdash;clean, wholesome, and homely. But now the fresh uplands
seemed like a horrible pit. When I looked to the hills my breath choked in my
throat, and the feel of soft heather below my feet set my heart trembling.</p>
<p>It was a slow journey to the inn at Allermuir. For one thing, no power on
earth would draw me within sight of the shieling of Carrickfey, so we had to
cross a shoulder of hill and make our way down a difficult glen, and then over
a treacherous moss. The lochs were now gleaming like fretted silver, but to me,
in my dreadful knowledge, they seemed more eerie than on that grey day when I
came. At last my eyes were cheered by the sight of a meadow and a fence; then
we were on a little byroad; and soon the fir-woods and cornlands of Allercleuch
were plain before us.</p>
<p>The shepherd came no farther, but with brief good-bye turned his solemn face
hillwards. I hired a trap and a man to drive, and down the ten miles of Glen
Aller I struggled to keep my thoughts from the past. I thought of the kindly
South Country, of Oxford, of anything comfortable and civilised. My driver
pointed out the objects of interest as in duty bound, but his words fell on
unheeding ears. At last he said something which roused me indeed to
interest&mdash;the interest of the man who hears the word he fears most in the
world. On the left side of the river there suddenly sprang into view a long
gloomy cleft in the hills, with a vista of dark mountains behind, down which a
stream of considerable size poured its waters.</p>
<p>'That is the Water o' Dule,' said the man in a reverent voice. 'A graund
water to fish, but dangerous to life, for it's a' linns. Awa' at the heid they
say there's a terrible wild place called the Scarts o' Muneraw,&mdash;that's a
shouther o' the muckle hill itsel' that ye see,&mdash;but I've never been
there, and I never kent ony man that had either.'</p>
<p>At the station, which is a mile from the village of Allerfoot, I found I had
some hours to wait on my train for the south. I dared not trust myself for one
moment alone, so I hung about the goods-shed, talked vacantly to the porters,
and when one went to the village for tea I accompanied him, and to his wonder
entertained him at the inn. When I returned I found on the platform a stray
bagman who was that evening going to London. If there is one class of men in
the world which I heartily detest it is this; but such was my state that I
hailed him as a brother, and besought his company. I paid the difference for a
first-class fare, and had him in the carriage with me. He must have thought me
an amiable maniac, for I talked in fits and starts, and when he fell asleep I
would wake him up and beseech him to speak to me. At wayside stations I would
pull down the blinds in case of recognition, for to my unquiet mind the world
seemed full of spies sent by that terrible Folk of the Hills. When the train
crossed a stretch of moor I would lie down on the seat in case of shafts fired
from the heather. And then at last with utter weariness I fell asleep, and woke
screaming about midnight to find myself well down in the cheerful English
midlands, and red blast-furnaces blinking by the railway-side.</p>
<p>In the morning I breakfasted in my rooms at St. Chad's with a dawning sense
of safety. I was in a different and calmer world. The lawn-like quadrangles,
the great trees, the cawing of rooks, and the homely twitter of
sparrows&mdash;all seemed decent and settled and pleasing. Indoors the oak-
panelled walls, the shelves of books, the pictures, the faint fragrance of
tobacco, were very different from the gimcrack adornments and the accursed
smell of peat and heather in that deplorable cottage. It was still vacation-
time, so most of my friends were down; but I spent the day hunting out the few
cheerful pedants to whom term and vacation were the same. It delighted me to
hear again their precise talk, to hear them make a boast of their work, and
narrate the childish little accidents of their life. I yearned for the childish
once more; I craved for women's drawing-rooms, and women's chatter, and
everything which makes life an elegant game. God knows I had had enough of the
other thing for a lifetime!</p>
<p>That night I shut myself in my rooms, barred my windows, drew my curtains,
and made a great destruction. All books or pictures which recalled to me the
moorlands were ruthlessly doomed. Novels, poems, treatises I flung into an old
box, for sale to the second-hand bookseller. Some prints and water- colour
sketches I tore to pieces with my own hands. I ransacked my fishing- book, and
condemned all tackle for moorland waters to the flames. I wrote a letter to my
solicitors, bidding them to go no further in the purchase of a place in Lorne I
had long been thinking of. Then, and not till then, did I feel the bondage of
the past a little loosed from my shoulders. I made myself a night-cap of
rum-punch instead of my usual whisky-toddy, that all associations with that
dismal land might be forgotten, and to complete the renunciation I returned to
cigars and flung my pipe into a drawer.</p>
<p>But when I woke in the morning I found that it is hard to get rid of
memories. My feet were still sore and wounded, and when I felt my arms cramped
and reflected on the causes, there was that black memory always near to vex
me.</p>
<p>In a little, term began, and my duties&mdash;as deputy-professor of Northern
Antiquities&mdash;were once more clamorous. I can well believe that my hearers
found my lectures strange, for instead of dealing with my favourite subjects
and matters, which I might modestly say I had made my own, I confined myself to
recondite and distant themes, treating even these cursorily and dully. For the
truth is, my heart was no more in my subject. I hated&mdash;or I thought that I
hated&mdash;all things Northern with the virulence of utter fear. My reading
was confined to science of the most recent kind, to abstruse philosophy, and to
foreign classics. Anything which savoured of romance or mystery was abhorrent;
I pined for sharp outlines and the tangibility of a high civilisation.</p>
<p>All the term I threw myself into the most frivolous life of the place. My
Harrow schooldays seemed to have come back to me. I had once been a fair
cricketer, so I played again for my college, and made decent scores. I coached
an indifferent crew on the river. I fell into the slang of the place, which I
had hitherto detested. My former friends looked on me askance, as if some
freakish changeling had possessed me. Formerly I had been ready for pedantic
discussion, I had been absorbed in my work, men had spoken of me as a rising
scholar. Now I fled the very mention of things I had once delighted in. The
Professor of Northern Antiquities, a scholar of European reputation, meeting me
once in the parks, embarked on an account of certain novel rings recently found
in Scotland, and to his horror found that, when he had got well under weigh, I
had slipped off unnoticed. I heard afterwards that the good old man was found
by a friend walking disconsolately with bowed head in the middle of the High
Street. Being rescued from among the horses' feet, he could only murmur, 'I am
thinking of Graves, poor man! And a year ago he was as sane as I am!'</p>
<p>But a man may not long deceive himself. I kept up the illusion valiantly for
the term; but I felt instinctively that the fresh schoolboy life, which seemed
to me the extreme opposite to the ghoulish North, and as such the most
desirable of things, was eternally cut off from me. No cunning affectation
could ever dispel my real nature or efface the memory of a week. I realised
miserably that sooner or later I must fight it out with my conscience. I began
to call myself a coward. The chief thoughts of my mind began to centre
themselves more and more round that unknown life waiting to be explored among
the unfathomable wilds.</p>
<p>One day I met a friend&mdash;an official in the British Museum&mdash; who
was full of some new theory about primitive habitations. To me it seemed
inconceivably absurd; but he was strong in his confidence, and without flaw in
his evidence. The man irritated me, and I burned to prove him wrong, but I
could think of no argument which was final against his. Then it flashed upon me
that my own experience held the disproof; and without more words I left him,
hot, angry with myself, and tantalised by the unattainable.</p>
<p>I might relate my bona-fide experience, but would men believe me? I must
bring proofs, I must complete my researches, so as to make them incapable of
disbelief. And there in those deserts was waiting the key. There lay the
greatest discovery of the century&mdash;nay, of the millennium. There, too, lay
the road to wealth such as I had never dreamed of. Could I succeed, I should be
famous for ever. I would revolutionise history and anthropology; I would
systematise folk-lore; I would show the world of men the pit whence they were
digged and the rock whence they were hewn.</p>
<p>And then began a game of battledore between myself and my conscience.</p>
<p>'You are a coward,' said my conscience.</p>
<p>'I am sufficiently brave,' I would answer. 'I have seen things and yet
lived. The terror is more than mortal, and I cannot face it.'</p>
<p>'You are a coward,' said my conscience.</p>
<p>'I am not bound to go there again. It would be purely for my own
aggrandisement if I went, and not for any matter of duty.'</p>
<p>'Nevertheless you are a coward,' said my conscience.</p>
<p>'In any case the matter can wait.'</p>
<p>'You are a coward.'</p>
<p>Then came one awful midsummer night, when I lay sleepless and fought the
thing out with myself. I knew that the strife was hopeless, that I should have
no peace in this world again unless I made the attempt. The dawn was breaking
when I came to the final resolution; and when I rose and looked at my face in a
mirror, lo! it was white and lined and drawn like a man of sixty.</p>
<br>
<h3>VI. Summer On The Moors</h3>
<p>The next morning I packed a bag with some changes of clothing and a
collection of notebooks, and went up to town. The first thing I did was to pay
a visit to my solicitors. 'I am about to travel,' said I, 'and I wish to have
all things settled in case any accident should happen to me.' So I arranged for
the disposal of my property in case of death, and added a codicil which puzzled
the lawyers. If I did not return within six months, communications were to be
entered into with the shepherd at the shieling of Farawa&mdash;post-town
Allerfoot. If he could produce any papers, they were to be put into the hands
of certain friends, published, and the cost charged to my estate. From my
solicitors, I went to a gunmaker's in Regent Street and bought an ordinary six-
chambered revolver, feeling much as a man must feel who proposed to cross the
Atlantic in a skiff and purchased a small life-belt as a precaution.</p>
<p>I took the night express to the North, and, for a marvel, I slept. When I
woke about four we were on the verge of Westmoreland, and stony hills blocked
the horizon. At first I hailed the mountain-land gladly; sleep for the moment
had caused forgetfulness of my terrors. But soon a turn of the line brought me
in full view of a heathery moor, running far to a confusion of distant peaks. I
remembered my mission and my fate, and if ever condemned criminal felt a more
bitter regret I pity his case. Why should I alone among the millions of this
happy isle be singled out as the repository of a ghastly secret, and be cursed
by a conscience which would not let it rest?</p>
<p>I came to Allerfoot early in the forenoon, and got a trap to drive me up the
valley. It was a lowering grey day, hot and yet sunless. A sort of heathaze
cloaked the hills, and every now and then a smurr of rain would meet us on the
road, and in a minute be over. I felt wretchedly dispirited; and when at last
the whitewashed kirk of Allermuir came into sight and the broken-backed bridge
of Aller, man's eyes seemed to have looked on no drearier scene since time
began.</p>
<p>I ate what meal I could get, for, fears or no, I was voraciously hungry.
Then I asked the landlord to find me some man who would show me the road to
Farawa. I demanded company, not for protection&mdash;for what could two men do
against such brutish strength?&mdash;but to keep my mind from its own
thoughts.</p>
<p>The man looked at me anxiously.</p>
<p>'Are ye acquaint wi' the folks, then?' he asked.</p>
<p>I said I was, that I had often stayed in the cottage.</p>
<p>'Ye ken that they've a name for being queer. The man never comes here forbye
once or twice a-year, and he has few dealings wi' other herds. He's got an ill
name, too, for losing sheep. I dinna like the country ava. Up by yon
Muneraw&mdash;no that I've ever been there, but I've seen it afar off&mdash; is
enough to put a man daft for the rest o' his days. What's taking ye thereaways?
It's no the time for the fishing?'</p>
<p>I told him that I was a botanist going to explore certain hill-crevices for
rare ferns. He shook his head, and then after some delay found me an ostler who
would accompany me to the cottage.</p>
<p>The man was a shock-headed, long-limbed fellow, with fierce red hair and a
humorous eye. He talked sociably about his life, answered my hasty questions
with deftness, and beguiled me for the moment out of myself. I passed the
melancholy lochs, and came in sight of the great stony hills without the
trepidation I had expected. Here at my side was one who found some humour even
in those uplands. But one thing I noted which brought back the old uneasiness.
He took the road which led us farthest from Carrickfey, and when to try him I
proposed the other, he vetoed it with emphasis.</p>
<p>After this his good spirits departed, and he grew distrustful.</p>
<p>'What mak's ye a freend o' the herd at Farawa?' he demanded a dozen
times.</p>
<p>Finally, I asked him if he knew the man, and had seen him lately.</p>
<p>'I dinna ken him, and I hadna seen him for years till a fortnicht syne, when
a' Allermuir saw him. He cam doun one afternoon to the public-hoose, and begood
to drink. He had aye been kenned for a terrible godly kind o' a man, so ye may
believe folk wondered at this. But when he had stuck to the drink for twae
days, and filled himsel' blind-fou half-a-dozen o' times, he took a fit o'
repentance, and raved and blethered about siccan a life as he led in the muirs.
There was some said he was speakin' serious, but maist thocht it was juist
daftness.'</p>
<p>'And what did he speak about?' I asked sharply.</p>
<p>'I canna verra weel tell ye. It was about some kind o' bogle that lived in
the Muneraw&mdash;that's the shouthers o't ye see yonder&mdash;and it seems
that the bogle killed his sheep and frichted himsel'. He was aye bletherin',
too, about something or somebody ca'd Grave; but oh! The man wasna wise.' And
my companion shook a contemptuous head.</p>
<p>And then below us in the valley we saw the shieling, with a thin shaft of
smoke rising into the rainy grey weather. The man left me, sturdily refusing
any fee. 'I wantit my legs stretched as weel as you. A walk in the hills is
neither here nor there to a stoot man. When will ye be back, sir?'</p>
<p>The question was well-timed. 'To-morrow fortnight,' I said, 'and I want
somebody from Allermuir to come out here in the morning and carry some baggage.
Will you see to that?'</p>
<p>He said 'Ay,' and went off, while I scrambled down the hill to the cottage.
Nervousness possessed me, and though it was broad daylight and the whole place
lay plain before me, I ran pell-mell, and did not stop till I reached the
door.</p>
<p>The place was utterly empty. Unmade beds, unwashed dishes, a hearth strewn
with the ashes of peat, and dust thick on everything, proclaimed the absence of
inmates. I began to be horribly frightened. Had the shepherd and his sister,
also, disappeared? Was I left alone in the bleak place, with a dozen lonely
miles between me and human dwellings? I could not return alone; better this
horrible place than the unknown perils of the out-of-doors. Hastily I
barricaded the door, and to the best of my power shuttered the windows; and
then with dreary forebodings I sat down to wait on fortune.</p>
<p>In a little I heard a long swinging step outside and the sound of dogs.
Joyfully I opened the latch, and there was the shepherd's grim face waiting
stolidly on what might appear.</p>
<p>At the sight of me he stepped back. 'What in the Lord's name are ye daein'
here?' he asked. 'Didna ye get enough afore?'</p>
<p>'Come in,' I said, sharply. 'I want to talk.'</p>
<p>In he came with those blessed dogs,&mdash;what a comfort it was to look on
their great honest faces! He sat down on the untidy bed and waited.</p>
<p>'I came because I could not stay away. I saw too much to give me any peace
elsewhere. I must go back, even though I risk my life for it. The cause of
scholarship demands it as well as the cause of humanity.' 'Is that a' the news
ye hae?' he said. Weel, I've mair to tell ye. Three weeks syne my sister Margit
was lost, and I've never seen her mair.' My jaw fell, and I could only stare at
him.</p>
<p>'I cam hame from the hill at nightfa' and she was gone. I lookit for her up
hill and doun, but I couldna find her. Syne I think I went daft. I went to the
Scarts and huntit them up and doun, but no sign could I see. The folk can bide
quiet enough when they want. Syne I went to Allermuir and drank mysel'
blind,&mdash;me, that's a God-fearing man and a saved soul; but the Lord help
me, I didna ken what I was at. That's my news, and day and nicht I wander thae
hills, seekin' for what I canna find.'</p>
<p>'But, man, are you mad?' I cried. 'Surely there are neighbours to help you.
There is a law in the land, and you had only to find the nearest police- office
and compel them to assist you.'</p>
<p>'What guid can man dae?' he asked. 'An army o' sodgers couldna find that
hidy-hole. Forby, when I went into Allermuir wi' my story the folk thocht me
daft. It was that set me drinking for&mdash;the Lord forgive me!&mdash;I wasna
my ain maister. I threepit till I was hairse, but the bodies just lauch'd.' And
he lay back on the bed like a man mortally tired.</p>
<p>Grim though the tidings were, I can only say that my chief feeling was of
comfort. Pity for the new tragedy had swallowed up my fear. I had now a
purpose, and a purpose, too, not of curiosity but of mercy.</p>
<p>'I go to-morrow morning to the Muneraw. But first I want to give you
something to do.' And I drew roughly a chart of the place on the back of a
letter. 'Go into Allermuir to-morrow, and give this paper to the landlord at
the inn. The letter will tell him what to do. He is to raise at once all the
men he can get, and come to the place on the chart marked with a cross. Tell
him life depends on his hurry.'</p>
<p>The shepherd nodded. 'D'ye ken the Folk are watching for you? They let me
pass without trouble, for they've nae use for me, but I see fine they're
seeking you. Ye'll no gang half a mile the morn afore they grip ye.'</p>
<p>'So much the better,' I said. 'That will take me quicker to the place I want
to be at.'</p>
<p>'And I'm to gang to Allemuir the morn,' he repeated, with the air of a child
conning a lesson. 'But what if they'll no believe me?' 'They'll believe the
letter.'</p>
<p>'Maybe,' he said, and relapsed into a doze.</p>
<p>I set myself to put that house in order, to rouse the fire, and prepare some
food. It was dismal work; and meantime outside the night darkened, and a great
wind rose, which howled round the walls and lashed the rain on the windows.</p>
<br>
<h3>VII. In tuas manus, Domine!</h3>
<p>I had not got twenty yards from the cottage door ere I knew I was watched. I
had left the shepherd still dozing, in the half-conscious state of a dazed and
broken man. All night the wind had wakened me at intervals, and now in the
half-light of morn the weather seemed more vicious than ever. The wind cut my
ears, the whole firmament was full of the rendings and thunders of the storm.
Rain fell in blinding sheets, the heath was a marsh, and it was the most I
could do to struggle against the hurricane which stopped my breath. And all the
while I knew I was not alone in the desert.</p>
<p>All men know&mdash;in imagination or in experience&mdash;the sensation of
being spied on. The nerves tingle, the skin grows hot and prickly, and there is
a queer sinking of the heart. Intensify this common feeling a hundredfold, and
you get a tenth part of what I suffered. I am telling a plain tale, and record
bare physical facts. My lips stood out from my teeth as I heard, or felt, a
rustle in the heather, a scraping among stones. Some subtle magnetic link
seemed established between my body and the mysterious world around. I became
sick&mdash;acutely sick&mdash;with the ceaseless apprehension.</p>
<p>My fright became so complete that when I turned a corner of rock, or stepped
in deep heather, I seemed to feel a body rub against me. This continued all the
way up the Farawa water, and then up its feeder to the little lonely loch. It
kept me from looking forward; but it likewise kept me in such a sweat of fright
that I was ready to faint. Then thenotion came upon me to test this fancy of
mine. If I was tracked thus closely, clearly the trackers would bar my way if I
turned back. So I wheeled round and walked a dozen paces down the glen.</p>
<p>Nothing stopped me. I was about to turn again, when something made me take
six more paces. At the fourth something rustled in the heather, and my neck was
gripped as in a vice. I had already made up my mind on what I would do. I would
be perfectly still, I would conquer my fear, and let them do as they pleased
with me so long as they took me to their dwelling. But at the touch of the
hands my resolutions fled. I struggled and screamed. Then something was clapped
on my mouth, speech and strength went from me, and once more I was back in the
maudlin childhood of terror.</p>
<p>In the cave it was always a dusky twilight. I seemed to be lying in the same
place, with the same dull glare of firelight far off, and the same close
stupefying smell. One of the creatures was standing silently at my side, and I
asked him some trivial question. He turned and shambled down the passage,
leaving me alone.</p>
<p>Then he returned with another, and they talked their guttural talk to me. I
scarcely listened till I remembered that in a sense I was here of my own
accord, and on a definite mission. The purport of their speech seemed to be
that, now I had returned, I must beware of a second flight. Once I had been
spared; a second time I should be killed without mercy.</p>
<p>I assented gladly. The Folk, then, had some use for me. I felt my errand
prospering.</p>
<p>Then the old creature which I had seen before crept out of some corner and
squatted beside me. He put a claw on my shoulder, a horrible, corrugated,
skeleton thing, hairy to the finger-tips and nailless. He grinned, too, with
toothless gums, and his hideous old voice was like a file on sandstone.</p>
<p>I asked questions, but he would only grin and jabber, looking now and then
furtively over his shoulder towards the fire.</p>
<p>I coaxed and humoured him, till he launched into a narrative of which I
could make nothing. It seemed a mere string of names, with certain words
repeated at fixed intervals. Then it flashed on me that this might be a
religious incantation. I had discovered remnants of a ritual and a mythology
among them. It was possible that these were sacred days, and that I had
stumbled upon some rude celebration.</p>
<p>I caught a word or two and repeated them. He looked at me curiously. Then I
asked him some leading question, and he replied with clearness. My guess was
right. The midsummer week was the holy season of the year, when sacrifices were
offered to the gods.</p>
<p>The notion of sacrifices disquieted me, and I would fain have asked further.
But the creature would speak no more. He hobbled off, and left me alone in the
rock-chamber to listen to a strange sound which hung ceaselessly about me. It
must be the storm without, like a pack of artillery rattling among the crags. A
storm of storms surely, for the place echoed and hummed, and to my unquiet eye
the very rock of the roof seemed to shake!</p>
<p>Apparently my existence was forgotten, for I lay long before any one
returned. Then it was merely one who brought food, the same strange meal as
before, and left hastily. When I had eaten I rose and stretched myself. My
hands and knees still quivered nervously; but I was strong and perfectly well
in body. The empty, desolate, tomb-like place was eerie enough to scare any
one; but its emptiness was comfort when I thought of its inmates. Then I
wandered down the passage towards the fire which was burning in loneliness.
Where had the Folk gone? I puzzled over their disappearance.</p>
<p>Suddenly sounds began to break on my ear, coming from some inner chamber at
the end of that in which the fire burned. I could scarcely see for the smoke;
but I began to make my way towards the noise, feeling along the sides of rock.
Then a second gleam of light seemed to rise before me, and I came to an
aperture in the wall which gave entrance to another room.</p>
<p>This in turn was full of smoke and glow&mdash;a murky orange glow, as if
from some strange flame of roots. There were the squat moving figures, running
in wild antics round the fire. I crouched in the entrance, terrified and yet
curious, till I saw something beyond the blaze which held me dumb. Apart from
the others and tied to some stake in the wall was a woman's figure, and the
face was the face of the shepherd's sister.</p>
<p>My first impulse was flight. I must get away and think,&mdash;plan, achieve
some desperate way of escape. I sped back to the silent chamber as if the gang
were at my heels. It was still empty, and I stood helplessly in the centre,
looking at the impassable walls of rock as a wearied beast may look at the
walls of its cage. I bethought me of the way I had escaped before and rushed
thither, only to find it blocked by a huge contrivance of stone. Yards and
yards of solid rock were between me and the upper air, and yet through it all
came the crash and whistle of the storm. If I were at my wits' end in this
inner darkness, there was also high commotion among the powers of the air in
that upper world.</p>
<p>As I stood I heard the soft steps of my tormentors. They seemed to think I
was meditating escape, for they flung themselves on me and bore me to the
ground. I did not struggle, and when they saw me quiet, they squatted round and
began to speak. They told me of the holy season and its sacrifices. At first I
could not follow them; then when I caught familiar words I found some clue, and
they became intelligible. They spoke of a woman, and I asked, 'What woman?'
With all frankness they told me of the custom which prevailed&mdash;how every
twentieth summer a woman was sacrificed to some devilish god, and by the hand
of one of the stranger race. I said nothing, but my whitening face must have
told them a tale, though I strove hard to keep my composure. I asked if they
had found the victims. 'She is in this place,' they said; 'and as for the man,
thou art he.' And with this they left me.</p>
<p>I had still some hours; so much I gathered from their talk, for the
sacrifice was at sunset. Escape was cut off for ever. I have always been
something of a fatalist, and at the prospect of the irrevocable end my
cheerfulness returned. I had my pistol, for they had taken nothing from me. I
took out the little weapon and fingered it lovingly. Hope of the lost, refuge
of the vanquished, ease to the coward&mdash;blessed be he who first conceived
it!</p>
<p>The time dragged on, the minutes grew to hours, and still I was left
solitary. Only the mad violence of the storm broke the quiet. It had increased
in violence, for the stones at the mouth of the exit by which I had formerly
escaped seemed to rock with some external pressure, and cutting shafts of wind
slipped past and cleft the heat of the passage. What a sight the ravine outside
must be, I thought, set in the forehead of a great hill, and swept clean by
every breeze! Then came a crashing, and the long hollow echo of a fall. The
rocks are splitting, said I; the road down the corrie will be impassable now
and for evermore.</p>
<p>I began to grow weak with the nervousness of the waiting, and by-and-by I
lay down and fell into a sort of doze. When I next knew consciousness I was
being roused by two of the Folk, and bidden get ready. I stumbled to my feet,
felt for the pistol in the hollow of my sleeve, and prepared to follow.</p>
<p>When we came out into the wider chamber the noise of the storm was
deafening. The roof rang like a shield which has been struck. I noticed,
perturbed as I was, that my guards cast anxious eyes around them, alarmed, like
myself, at the murderous din. Nor was the world quieter when we entered the
last chamber, where the fire burned and the remnant of the Folk waited. Wind
had found an entrance from somewhere or other, and the flames blew here and
there, and the smoke gyrated in odd circles. At the back, and apart from the
rest, I saw the dazed eyes and the white old drawn face of the woman.</p>
<p>They led me up beside her to a place where there was a rude flat stone,
hollowed in the centre, and on it a rusty iron knife, which seemed once to have
formed part of a scythe-blade. Then I saw the ceremonial which was marked out
for me. It was the very rite which I had dimly figured as current among a rude
people, and even in that moment I had something of the scholar's
satisfaction.</p>
<p>The oldest of the Folk, who seemed to be a sort of priest, came to my side
and mumbled a form of words. His fetid breath sickened me; his dull eyes,
glassy like a brute's with age, brought my knees together. He put the knife in
my hands, dragged the terror-stricken woman forward to the altar, and bade me
begin.</p>
<p>I began by sawing her bonds through. When she felt herself free she would
have fled back, but stopped when I bade her. At that moment there came a noise
of rending and crashing as if the hills were falling, and for one second the
eyes of the Folk were averted from the frustrated sacrifice.</p>
<p>Only for a moment. The next they saw what I had done, and with one impulse
rushed towards me. Then began the last scene in the play. I sent a bullet
through the right eye of the first thing that came on. The second shot went
wide; but the third shattered the hand of an elderly ruffian with a cruel club.
Never for an instant did they stop, and now they were clutching at me. I pushed
the woman behind, and fired three rapid shots in blind panic, and then,
clutching the scythe, I struck right and left like a madman.</p>
<p>Suddenly I saw the foreground sink before my eyes. The roof sloped down, and
with a sickening hiss a mountain of rock and earth seemed to precipitate itself
on my assailants. One, nipped in the middle by a rock, caught my eye by his
hideous writhings. Two only remained in what was now a little suffocating
chamber, with embers from the fire still smoking on the floor.</p>
<p>The woman caught me by the hand and drew me with her, while the two seemed
mute with fear. 'There's a road at the back,' she screamed. 'I ken it. I fand
it out.' And she pulled me up a narrow hole in the rock.</p>
<p>How long we climbed I do not know. We were both fighting for air, with the
tightness of throat and chest, and the craziness of limb which mean
suffocation. I cannot tell when we first came to the surface, but I remember
the woman, who seemed, to have the strength of extreme terror, pulling me from
the edge of a crevasse and laying me on a flat rock. It seemed to be the depth
of winter, with sheer-falling rain and a wind that shook the hills.</p>
<p>Then I was once more myself and could look about me. From my feet yawned a
sheer abyss, where once had been a hill-shoulder. Some great mass of rock on
the brow of the mountain had been loosened by the storm, and in its fall had
caught the lips of the ravine and swept the nest of dwellings into a yawning
pit. Beneath a mountain of rubble lay buried that life on which I had thought
to build my fame.</p>
<p>My feeling&mdash;Heaven help me!&mdash;was not thankfulness for God's mercy
and my escape, but a bitter mad regret. I rushed frantically to the edge, and
when I saw only the blackness of darkness I wept weak tears. All the time the
storm was tearing at my body, and I had to grip hard by hand and foot to keep
my place.</p>
<p>Suddenly on the brink of the ravine I saw a third figure. We two were not
the only fugitives. One of the Folk had escaped.</p>
<p>The thought put new life into me, for I had lost the first fresh
consciousness of terror. There still remained a relic of the vanished life.
Could I but make the thing my prisoner, there would be proof in my hands to
overcome a sceptical world.</p>
<p>I ran to it, and to my surprise the thing as soon as it saw me rushed to
meet me. At first I thought it was with some instinct of self-preservation, but
when I saw its eyes I knew the purpose of fight. Clearly one or other should go
no more from the place.</p>
<p>We were some ten yards from the brink when I grappled with it. Dimly I heard
the woman scream with fright, and saw her scramble across the hillside. Then we
were tugging in a death-throe, the hideous smell-of the thing in my face, its
red eyes burning into mine, and its hoarse voice muttering. Its strength seemed
incredible; but I, too, am no weakling. We tugged and strained, its nails
biting into my flesh, while I choked its throat unsparingly. Every second I
dreaded lest we should plunge together over the ledge, for it was thither my
adversary tried to draw me. I caught my heel in a nick of rock, and pulled
madly against it.</p>
<p>And then, while I was beginning to glory with the pride of conquest, my hope
was dashed in pieces. The thing seemed to break from my arms, and, as if in
despair, cast itself headlong into the impenetrable darkness. I stumbled
blindly after it, saved myself on the brink, and fell back, sick and ill, into
a merciful swoon.</p>
<br>
<h3>VIII. Note In Conclusion By The Editor</h3>
<p>At this point the narrative of my unfortunate friend, Mr. Graves of St
Chad's, breaks off abruptly. He wrote it shortly before his death, and was
prevented from completing it by the shock of apoplexy which carried him off. In
accordance with the instructions in his will, I have prepared it for
publication, and now in much fear and hesitation give it to the world. First,
however, I must supplement it by such facts as fall within my knowledge.</p>
<p>The shepherd seems to have gone to Allermuir and by the help of the letter
convinced the inhabitants. A body of men was collected under the landlord, and
during the afternoon set out for the hills. But unfortunately the great
midsummer storm&mdash;the most terrible of recent climatic
disturbances&mdash;had filled the mosses and streams, and they found themselves
unable to proceed by any direct road. Ultimately late in the evening they
arrived at the cottage of Farawa, only to find there a raving woman, the
shepherd's sister, who seemed crazy with brain-fever. She told some rambling
story about her escape, but her narrative said nothing of Mr. Graves. So they
treated her with what skill they possessed, and sheltered for the night in and
around the cottage. Next morning the storm had abated a little, and the woman
had recovered something of her wits. From her they learned that Mr. Graves was
lying in a ravine on the side of the Muneraw in imminent danger of his life. A
body set out to find him; but so immense was the landslip, and so dangerous the
whole mountain, that it was nearly evening when they recovered him from the
ledge of rock. He was alive, but unconscious, and on bringing him back to the
cottage it was clear that he was, indeed, very ill. There he lay for three
months, while the best skill that could be got was procured for him. By dint of
an uncommon toughness of constitution he survived; but it was an old and feeble
man who returned to Oxford in the early winter.</p>
<p>The shepherd and his sister immediately left the countryside, and were never
more heard of, unless they are the pair of unfortunates who are at present in a
Scottish pauper asylum, incapable of remembering even their names. The people
who last spoke with them declared that their minds seemed weakened by a great
shock, and that it was hopeless to try to get any connected or rational
statement.</p>
<p>The career of my poor friend from that hour was little short of a tragedy.
He awoke from his illness to find the world incredulous; even the countryfolk
of Allermuir set down the story to the shepherd's craziness and my friend's
credulity. In Oxford his argument was received with polite scorn. An account of
his experiences which he drew up for the 'Times' was refused by the editor; and
an article on 'Primitive Peoples of the North,' embodying what he believed to
be the result of his discoveries, was unanimously rejected by every responsible
journal in Europe. Whether he was soured by such treatment, or whether his
brain had already been weakened, he became a morose silent man, and for the two
years before his death had few friends and no society. From the obituary notice
in the 'Times' I take the following paragraph, which shows in what light the
world had come to look upon him:</p>
<p>'At the, outset of his career he was regarded as a rising scholar in one
department of archaeology, and his Taffert lectures were a real contribution to
an obscure subject. But in after-life he was led into fantastic speculations;
and when he found himself unable to convince his colleagues, he gradually
retired into himself, and lived practically a hermit's life till his death. His
career, thus broken short, is a sad instance of the fascination which the
recondite and the quack can exercise even on men of approved ability.'</p>
<p>And now his own narrative is published, and the world can judge as it
pleases about the amazing romance. The view which will doubtless find general
acceptance is that the whole is a figment of the brain, begotten of some
harmless moorland adventure and the company of such religious maniacs as the
shepherd and his sister. But some who knew the former sobriety and calmness of
my friend's mind may be disposed timorously and with deep hesitation to another
verdict. They may accept the narrative, and believe that somewhere in those
moorlands he met with a horrible primitive survival, passed through the
strangest adventure, and had his finger on an epoch-making discovery. In this
case they will be inclined to sympathise with the loneliness and
misunderstanding of his latter days. It is not for me to decide the question.
That which alone could bring proof is buried beneath a thousand tons of rock in
the midst of an untrodden desert.</p>

<h2><a name="story2" id="story2">THE FAR ISLANDS</a></h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, November 1899</h3>
<p class="poem">"Lady Alice, Lady Louise,<br>
Between the wash of the tumbling seas&mdash;"</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>When Bran the Blessed, as the story goes, followed the white bird on the
Last Questing, knowing that return was not for him, he gave gifts to his
followers. To Heliodorus he gave the gift of winning speech, and straightway
the man went south to the Italian seas, and, becoming a scholar, left many
descendants who sat in the high places of the Church. To Raymond he gave his
steel battle-axe, and bade him go out to the warrior's path and, hew his way to
a throne; which the man forthwith accomplished, and became an ancestor in the
fourth degree of the first king of Scots. But to Colin, the youngest and the
dearest, he gave no gift, whispering only a word in his ear and laying a finger
on his eyelids. Yet Colin was satisfied, and he alone of the three, after their
master's going, remained on that coast of rock and heather.</p>
<p>In the third generation from Colin, as our elders counted years, came one
Colin the Red, who built his keep on the cliffs of Acharra and was a mighty
sea-rover in his day. Five times he sailed to the rich parts of France, and a
good score of times he carried his flag of three stars against the easterly
vikings. A mere name in story, but a sounding piece of nomenclature well
garnished with tales. A master-mind by all accounts, but cursed with a habit of
fantasy; for, hearing in his old age of a land to the westward, he forthwith
sailed into the sunset, and three days later was washed up, a twisted body, on
one of the outer isles.</p>
<p>So far it is but legend, but with his grandson, Colin the Red, we fall into
the safer hands of the chroniclers. To him God gave the unnumbered sorrows of
story-telling, for he was a bard, cursed with a bard's fervours, and none the
less a mighty warrior among his own folk. He it was who wrote the lament called
"The White Waters of Usna," and the exquisite chain of romances, "Glede-red
Gold and Grey Silver." His tales were told by many fires, down to our
grandfathers' time, and you will find them still pounded at by the folklorists.
But his airs&mdash;they are eternal. On harp and pipe they have lived through
the centuries; twisted and tortured, they survive in many songbooks; and I
declare that the other day I heard the most beautiful of them all murdered by a
band at a German watering-place. This Colin led the wanderer's life, for he
disappeared at middle-age, no one knew whither, and his return was long looked
for by his people. Some thought that he became a Christian monk, the holy man
living in the sea-girt isle of Cuna, who was found dead in extreme old age,
kneeling on the beach, with his arms, contrary to the fashion of the Church,
stretched to the westward.</p>
<p>As history narrowed into bonds and forms die descendants of Colin took Raden
for their surname, and settled more firmly on their lands in the long peninsula
of crag and inlets which runs west to the Atlantic. Under Donald of the Isles
they harried the Kings of Scots, or, on their own authority, made war on
Macleans and Macranalds, till their flag of the three stars, their badge of the
grey-goose feather, and their on-cry of "Cuna" were feared from Lochalsh to
Can-tire. Later they made a truce with the King, and entered into the royal
councils. For years they warded the western coast, and as king's lieutenants
smoked out the inferior pirates of Eigg and Toronsay. A Raden was made a Lord
of Sleat, another was given lands in the low country and the name Baron of
Strathyre, but their honours were transitory and short as their lives. Rarely
one of the house saw middle age. A bold, handsome, and stirring race, it was
their fate to be cut off in the rude warfare of the times, or, if peace had
them in its clutches, to man vessel and set off once more on those mad western
voyages which were the weird of the family. Three of the name were found
drowned on the far shore of Cana; more than one sailed straight out of the ken
of mortals, One rode with the Good Lord James on the pilgrimage of the Heart of
Bruce, and died by his leader's side in the Saracen battle. Long afterwards a
Raden led the western men against the Cheshire archers at Flodden, and was
slain himself in the steel circle around the king.</p>
<p>But the years brought peace and a greater wealth, and soon the cold stone
tower was left solitary on the headland, and the new house of Kinlochuna rose
by the green links of the stream. The family changed its faith, and an
Episcopal chaplain took the place of the old mass- priest in the tutoring of
the sons. Radens were in the '15 and the '45. They rose with Bute to power, and
they long disputed the pride of Dundas in the northern capital. They
intermarried with great English houses till the sons of the family were Scots
only in name, living much abroad or in London, many of them English landowners
by virtue of a mother's blood. Soon the race was of the common over-civilised
type, graceful, well-mannered, with abundant good looks, but only once in a
generation reverting to the rugged northern strength. Eton and Oxford had in
turn displaced the family chaplain, and the house by the windy headland grew
emptier and emptier save when `grouse and deer brought home its fickle
masters.</p>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>A childish illness brought Colin to Kinlochuna when he had reached the
mature age of five, and delicate health kept him there for the greater part of
the next six, years. During the winter he lived in London, but from the late
northern spring through all the long bright summers he lived in the great
tenantless place Without company&mdash;for he was an only child. A French nurse
had the charge of his doings, and when he had passed through the formality of
lessons there were the long pinewoods at his disposal, the rough moor, the
wonderful black holes with the rich black mud in them, and best of all the bay
of Acharra, below the headland, with Cuna lying in the waves a mile to the
west. At such times his father was busy elsewhere; his mother was dead; the
family had few near relatives; so he passed a solitary childhood in the company
of seagulls and the birds of the moor.</p>
<p>His time for the Leach was the afternoon. On the left as you go down through
the woods from the house there runs out the great headland of Acharra, red and
grey with mosses, and with a nimbus always of screaming sea-fowl. To the right
runs a low beach of sand, passing into rough limestone boulders and then into
the heather of the wood. This in turn is bounded by a reef of low rocks falling
by gentle breaks to the water's edge. It is crowned with a tangle of heath and
fern, bright at most seasons with flowers, and dwarf pine-trees straggle on its
crest till one sees the meaning of its Gaelic name, "The Ragged Cock's-Comb?"
This place was Colin's playground in fine weather. When it blew rain or snow
from the north he dwelt indoors among dogs and books, puzzling his way through
great volumes from his father's shelves. But when the mild west-wind weather
fell on the sea, then he would lie on the hot sand&mdash;Am&egrave;lie the
nurse reading a novel on the nearest rock&mdash;and kick his small heels as he
followed his fancy. He built great sand castles to the shape of Acharra old
tower, and peopled them with preposterous knights and ladies; he drew great
moats and rivers for the tide to fill; he fought battles innumerable with
crackling seaweed, till Am&egrave;lie, with her sharp cry of "Colin, Colin,"
would carry, him houseward for tea.</p>
<p>Two fancies remained in his mind through those boyish years. One was about
the mysterious shining sea before him. In certain weathers it seemed to him a
solid pathway. Cuna; the little ragged isle, ceased to block the horizon, and
his own white road ran away down into the west, till suddenly it stopped and he
saw no farther. He knew he ought to see more, but always at one place, just
when his thoughts were pacing the white road most gallantly, there came a
baffling mist to his sight, and he found himself looking at a commonplace sea
with Cuna lying very real and palpable in the offing. It was a vexatious
limitation, for all his dreams were about this pathway. One day in June, when
the waters slept in a deep heat, he came down the sands barefoot, and lo! there
was his pathway. For one moment things seemed clear, the mist had not gathered
on the road, and with a cry he ran down to the tide's edge and waded in. The
touch of water dispelled the illusion, and almost in tears he saw the cruel
back of Cuna blotting out his own magic way.</p>
<p>The other fancy was about the low ridge of rocks which bounded the bay on
the right. His walks had never extended beyond it, either on the sands or
inland, for that way lay a steep hillside and a perilous bog. But often on the
sands he had come to its foot and wondered what country lay beyond. He made
many efforts to explore it, difficult efforts, for the vigilant Am&egrave;lie
had first to be avoided. Once he was almost at the top when some seaweed to
which he clung gave way, and he rolled back again to the soft warm sand.
By-and-by he found that he knew what was beyond. A clear picture had built
itself up in his brain of a mile of reefs, with sand in bars between them, and
beyond all a sea-wood of alders slipping from the hill's skirts to the water's
edge. This was not what he wanted in his explorations, so he stopped till one
day it struck him that the westward view might reveal something beyond the
hog-backed Cuna. One day, pioneering alone, he scaled the steepest heights of
the seaweed and pulled his chin over the crest of the ridge. There, sure
enough, was his picture&mdash;a mile of reefs and the tattered sea-wood. He
turned eagerly seawards. Cuna still lay humped on the waters, but beyond it he
seemed to see his shining pathway running far to a speck which might be an
island. Crazy with pleasure he stared at the vision, till slowly it melted into
the waves, and Cuna the inexorable once more blocked the sky-line. He climbed
down, his heart in a doubt between despondency and hope.</p>
<p>It was the last day of such fancies, for on the morrow he had to face the
new world of school.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>At Cecil's Colin found a new life and a thousand new interests. His early
delicacy had been driven away by the sea- winds of Acharra, and he was rapidly
growing up a tall, strong child, straight of limb like all his house, but
sinewy and alert beyond his years. He learned new, games with astonishing
facility, became a fast bowler with a genius for twists, and a Rugby
three-quarters full of pluck and cunning. He soon attained to the modified
popularity of a private school, and, being essentially clean, strong, and
healthy, found himself a mark for his juniors' worship and a favourite with
masters. The homage did not spoil him, for no boy was ever less self-possessed.
On the cricket-ground and the football-field he was a leader, but in private he
had the nervous, sensitive manners of the would-be recluse. No one ever accused
him of "side"&mdash;his polite, halting address was the same to junior and
senior; and the result was that wild affection which simplicity in the great is
wont to inspire. He spoke with a pure accent, in which lurked no northern
trace; in a little he had forgotten all about his birthplace and his origin.
His name had at first acquired for him the sobriquet of "Scottie," but the
title was soon dropped from its manifest inaptness.</p>
<p>In his second year at Cecil's he caught a prevalent fever, and for days lay
very near the brink of death. At his worst he was wildly delirious, crying
ceaselessly for Acharra and the beach at Kinlochuna. But as he grew
convalescent the absorption remained, and for the moment be seemed to have
forgotten his southern life. He found himself playing on the sands, always with
the boundary ridge before him, and the hump of Cuna rising in the sea. When
dragged back to his environment by, the inquiries of Bellew, his special
friend, who came to sit with him, he was so abstracted and forgetful that the
good Bellew was seriously grieved. "The chap's a bit cracked, you know," he
announced in hall. "Didn't known. Asked me what looter' meant when I told him
about the Bayswick match, and talked about nothing but a lot of heathen Scotch
names."</p>
<p>One dream haunted Colin throughout the days of his recovery. He was
tormented with a furious thirst, poorly assuaged at long intervals by watered
milk. So when he crossed the borders of dreamland his first search was always
for a well. He tried the brushwood inland from the beach, but it was dry as
stone. Then he climbed with difficulty the boundary ridge, and found little
pools of salt water, while far on the other side gleamed the dark black
bog-holes. Here was not what he sought, and he was in deep despair, till
suddenly over the sea he caught a glimpse of his old path running beyond Cuna
to a bank of mist. He rushed down to the tide's edge, and to his amazement
found solid ground. Now was the chance for which he had long looked, and he ran
happily westwards, till of a sudden the solid earth seemed to sink with him,
and he was in the waters struggling. But two curious things he noted. One was
that the far bank of mist seemed to open for a pinpoint of time, and he had a
gleam of land. He saw nothing distinctly, only a line which was not mist and
was not water. The second was that the water was fresh, and as he was drinking
from this curious new fresh sea he awoke. The dream was repeated three times
before he left the sick-room. Always he wakened at the same place, always he
quenched his thirst in the fresh sea, but never again did the mist open for
him, and show him the strange country.</p>
<p>From Cecil's he went to the famous school which was the tradition in his
family The Head spoke to his house-master of his coming. "We are to have
another Raden here," he said, "and I am glad of it, if the young one turns out
to be anything like the others. There's a good deal of dry-rot among the boys
just now. They are all too old for their years and too wise in the wrong way.
They haven't anything like the enthusiasm in sports they had twenty years ago
when I first came here. I hope this young Raden will stir them up." The
house-master agreed, and when he first caught sight of Colin's slim, well-knit
figure, looked into the handsome kindly eyes, and heard his curiously diffident
speech, his doubts' vanished. "We have got the right stuff now," he
told-himself, and the senior for whom the new boy fagged made the same
comment.</p>
<p>From the anomalous insignificance of fagdom Cohn climbed up the School,
leaving everywhere a record of honest good- nature. He was allowed to forget
his cricket and football, but in return he was initiated into the mysteries of
the river. Water had always been his delight, so he went through the dreary
preliminaries of being coached in a tub-pair till he learned to swing steadily
and get his arms quickly forward. Then came the stages of scratch fours and
scratch eights, till after a long apprenticeship he was promoted to the dignity
of a thwart in the Eight itself. In his last year he was Captain of Boats, a
position which joins the responsibility of a Cabinet Minister to the rapturous
popular applause of a successful warrior. Nor was he the least distinguished of
a great band. With Colin at seven the School won the Ladies' after the closest
race on record.</p>
<p>The Head's prophecy fell true, for Cohn was a born leader. For all his
good-humour and diffidence of speech, he had a trick of shutting his teeth
which all respected. As captain he was the idol of the school, and he ruled it
well and justly. For the rest, he was a curious boy with none of the ordinary
young enthusiasms, reserved for all his kindliness. At house "shouters" his was
not the voice which led the stirring strains of "Stroke it all you know,"
though his position demanded it. He cared little about work, and the
School-house scholar, who fancied him from his manner a devotee of things
intellectual, found in Colin but an affected interest. He read a certain amount
of modern poetry with considerable boredom; fiction he never opened. The truth
was that he had a romance in his own brain which, Willy nilly, would play
itself out, and which left him small relish for the pale second-hand inanities
of art. Often, when with others he would lie in the deep meadows by the river
on some hot summer's day, his fancies would take a curious colour. He adored
the soft English landscape, the lush grasses, the slow streams, the ancient
secular trees. But as he looked into the hazy green distance a colder air would
blow on his cheek, a pungent smell of salt and pines would be for a moment in
his nostrils, and he would be gazing at a line of waves on a beach, a ridge of
low rocks, and a shining sea-path running out to&mdash;ah, that he could not
tell! The envious Cuna would suddenly block all the vistas. He had constantly
the vision before his eyes, and he strove to strain into the distance before
Cuna should intervene. Once or twice he seemed almost to achieve it. He found
that by keeping on the top of the low rock-ridge he could cheat Cuna by a
second or two, and get a glimpse of a misty something out in the west. The
vision took odd times for recurring, once or twice in lecture, once on the
cricket-ground, many times in the fields of a Sunday, and once while he paddled
down to the start in a Trials race. It gave him a keen pleasure: it was his
private domain, where at any moment he might make some enchanting
discovery.</p>
<p>At this time he began to spend his vacations at Kinlochuna. His father, an
elderly ex-diplomat, had permanently taken up his abode there, and was rapidly
settling into the easy life of the Scotch laird. Colin returned to his native
place without enthusiasm. His childhood there had been full of lonely hours,
and he had come to like the warm south country. He found the house full of
people, for his father entertained hugely, and the talk was of sport and sport
alone. As a rule, your very great athlete is bored by Scotch shooting. Long
hours of tramping and crouching among heather cramp without fully exercising
the body; and unless he has the love of the thing ingrained in him, the odds
are that he will wish himself home. The father, in his new-found admiration for
his lot, was content to face all weathers; the son found it an effort to keep
pace with such vigour. He thought upon the sunlit fields and reedy watercourses
with regret, and saw little in the hills but a rough waste scarred with rock
and sour with mosses.</p>
<p>He read widely throughout these days, for his father had a taste for modern
letters, and new books lay littered about the rooms. He read queer Celtic tales
which he thought "sickening rot," and mild Celtic poetry which he failed to
understand. Among the guests was a noted manufacturer of fiction, whom the
elder Raden had met somewhere and bidden to Kinlochuna, He had heard the tale
of Colin's ancestors and the sea headland of Acharra, and one day he asked the
boy to show him the place, as he wished to make a story of it. Colin assented
unwillingly, for he had been slow to visit this place of memories, and he did
not care to make his first experiment in such company. But the gentleman would
not be gainsaid, so the two scrambled through the sea-wood and climbed the low
ridge which looked over the bay. The weather was mist and drizzle; Cuna had
wholly hidden herself, and the bluff Acharra loomed hazy and far. Colin was
oddly disappointed: this reality was a poor place compared with his fancies.
His companion stroked his peaked beard, talked nonsense about Colin the Red and
rhetoric about "the spirit of the misty grey, weather having entered into the
old tale."</p>
<p>"Think," he cried; "to those old warriors beyond that bank of mist was the
whole desire of life, the Golden City, the Far Islands, whatever you care to
call it." Colin shivered, as if his holy places had been profaned, set down the
man in his mind most unjustly as an "awful little cad," and hurried him back to
the house.</p>
<p>Oxford received the boy with open arms, for his reputation had long preceded
him. To the majority of men he was the one freshman of his year, and gossip was
busy with his prospects. Nor was gossip disappointed. In his first year he
rowed seven in the Eight. The next year he was captain of his college boats,
and a year later the O.U.B.C. made him its president. For three years he rowed
in the winning Eight, and old coaches agreed that in him the perfect seven had
been found. It was he who in the famous race of 18&mdash;caught up in the last
three hundred yards the quickened stroke which gave Oxford victory. As he grew
to his full strength he became a splendid figure of a man&mdash;tall, supple,
deep-chested for all his elegance. His quick dark eyes and his kindly
hesitating manners made people think his face extraordinarily handsome, when
really it was in no way above the common. But his whole figure, as he stood in
his shorts and sweater on the raft at Putney, was so full of youth and strength
that people involuntarily smiled when they saw him&mdash;a smile of pleasure in
so proper a piece of manhood.</p>
<p>Colin enjoyed life hugely at Oxford, for to one so frank and well equipped
the place gave of its best. He was the most distinguished personage of his day
there, but, save to school friends and the men he met officially on the river,
he was little known. His diffidence and his very real exclusiveness kept him
from being the centre of a host of friends. His own countrymen in the place
were utterly non-plussed by him. They claimed him, eagerly as a fellow, but he
had none of the ordinary characteristics of the race. There were Scots of every
description around him&mdash;pale-faced Scots who worked incessantly,
metaphysical Scots who talked in the Union, industrious Scots who played
football. They were all men of hearty manners and many enthusiasms,&mdash;who
quoted Burns and dined to the immortal bard's honour every 25th of January; who
told interminable Scotch stories, and fell into fervours over national sports,
dishes, drinks, and religions. To the poor Colin it was all inexplicable. At
the remote house of Kinlochuna he had never heard of a Free Kirk, or a haggis.
He had never read a line of Burns, Scott bored him exceedingly, and in all
honesty he thought Scots games inferior to southern sports. He had no great
love for the bleak country, he cared nothing for the traditions of his house,
so he was promptly set down by his compatriots as "denationalised and
degenerate?"</p>
<p>He was idle, too, during these years as far as his "schools" were concerned,
but he was always very intent upon his own private business. Whenever he sat
down to read, when he sprawled on the grass at river picnics, in chapel, in
lecture&mdash;in short, at any moment when his body was at rest and his mind at
leisure&mdash;his fancies were off on the same old path. Things had changed,
however, in that country. The boyish device of a hard road running over the
waters had gone, and now it was invariably a boat which he saw beached on the
shingle. It differed in shape. At first it was an ugly salmoncoble, such as the
fishermen used for the nets at Kinlochuna. Then it passed, by rapid
transitions, through a canvas skiff which it took good watermanship to sit, a
whiff, an ordinary dinghy, till at last it settled itself into a long rough
boat, pointed at both ends, with oar-holes in the sides instead of row-locks.
It was the devil's own business to launch it, and launch it anew he was
compelled to for every journey; for though he left it bound in a little rock
hollow below the ridge after landing, yet when he returned, lo! there was the
clumsy thing high and dry upon the beach.</p>
<p>The odd point about the new venture was that Cuna had ceased to trouble him.
As soon as he had pulled his first stroke the island disappeared, and nothing
lay before him but the sea-fog. Yet, try as he might, he could come little
nearer. The shores behind him might sink and lessen, but the impenetrable mist
was still miles to the westward. Sometimes he rowed so far that the shore was a
thin line upon the horizon, but when he turned the boat it seemed to ground in
a second on the beach. The long laboured journey out and the instantaneous
return puzzled him at first, but soon he became used to them. His one grief was
the mist, which seemed to grow denser as he neared it. The sudden glimpse of
land which he had got from the ridge of rock in the old boyish days was now
denied him, and with the denial came a keener exultation in the quest.
Somewhere in the west, he knew, must be land, and in this land a well of sweet
water&mdash;for so he had interpreted his feverish dream. Sometimes, when the
wind blew against him, he caught scents from it&mdash;generally the scent of
pines, as on the little ridge on the shore behind him.</p>
<p>One day on his college barge, while he was waiting for a picnic patty to
start, he seemed to get nearer than before. Out on that western sea, as he saw
it, it was fresh, blowing weather, with a clear hot sky above. It was hard work
rowing, for the wind was against him, and the sun scorched his forehead. The
air seemed full of scents&mdash;and sounds, too, sounds of far-away surf and
wind in trees. He rested for a moment on his oars and turned his head. His
heart beat quickly, for there was a rift in the mist, and far through a line of
sand ringed with snow-white foam.</p>
<p>Somebody shook him roughly,&mdash;"Come on, Colin, old man. They're all
waiting for you. Do you know you've been half asleep?"</p>
<p>Colin rose and followed silently, with drowsy eyes. His mind was curiously
excited. He had looked inside the veil of mist. Now he knew what was the land
he sought.</p>
<p>He made the voyage often, now that the spell was broken. It was short work
to launch the boat, and, whereas it had been a long pull formerly, now it
needed only a few strokes to bring him to the Rim of the Mist. There was no
chance of getting farther, and he scarcely tried. He was content to rest there,
in a world of curious scents and sounds, till the mist drew down and he was
driven back to shore.</p>
<p>The change in his environment troubled him little. For a man who has been an
idol at the University to fall suddenly into the comparative insignificance of
town is often a bitter experience; but Colin, whose thoughts were not
ambitious, scarcely noticed it He found that he was less his own master than
before, but he humbled himself to his new duties without complaint Many of his
old friends were about him; he had plenty of acquaintances; and, being
"sufficient unto himself," he was unaccustomed to ennui. Invitations showered
upon him thick and fast. Match-making mothers, knowing his birth and his
father's income, and reflecting that he was the only child of his house,
desired him as a son-in-law. He was bidden welcome everywhere, and the young
girls, for whose sake he was thus courted, found in him an attractive mystery.
The tall good-looking athlete, with the kind eyes and the preposterously
nervous manner, wakened their maidenly sympathies. As they danced with him or
sat next to him at dinner, they talked fervently of Oxford, of the north, of
the army, of his friends. "Stupid, but nice, my dear," was Lady Afflint's
comment; and Miss Clarissa Herapath, the beauty of the year, declared to her
friends that he was a "dear boy, but so awkward." He was always forgetful, and
ever apologetic; and when he forgot the Shandwicks' theatre- party, the
Herapaths' dance, and at least a dozen minor matters, he began to acquire the
reputation of a cynic and a recluse.</p>
<p>"You're a queer chap, Col," Lieutenant Bellew said in expostulation.</p>
<p>Colin shrugged his shoulders; he was used to the description.</p>
<p>"Do you know that Clara Herapath was trying all she knew to please you this
afternoon, and you looked as if you weren't listening? Most men would have
given their ears to be in your place."</p>
<p>"I'm awfully sorry, but I thought I was very polite to her."</p>
<p>"And why weren't you at the Marshams' garden-party?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I went to polo with Collinson and another man. And, I say, old chap,
I'm not coming to the Logans tomorrow. I've got a fence on with Adair at the
school."</p>
<p>Little Bellew, who was a tremendous mirror of fashion and chevalier in
general, looked up curiously at his tall friend.</p>
<p>"Why don't you like the women, Col, when they're so fond of you?"</p>
<p>"They aren't," said Colin, hotly, "and I don't dislike 'em. But, Lord! they
bore me. I might be doing twenty things when I talk nonsense to one of 'em for
an hour. I come back as stupid as an owl, and besides there's heaps of things
better sport."</p>
<p>The truth was that, while among men he was a leader and at his ease, among
women his psychic balance was so oddly upset that he grew nervous and returned
unhappy. The boat on the beach, ready in general to appear at the slightest
call, would delay long after such experiences, and its place would be taken by
some woman's face for which he cared not a straw. For the boat, on the other
hand, he cared a very great deal. In all his frank wholesome existence there
was this enchanting background, this pleasure-garden which he cherished more
than anything in life. He had come of late to look at it with somewhat
different eyes. The eager desire to search behind the mist was ever with him,
but now he had also some curiosity about the details of the picture. As he
pulled out to the Rim of the Mist sounds seemed to shape themselves on his
lips, which by-and-by grew into actual words in his memory. He wrote them down
in scraps, and after some sorting they seemed to him a kind of Latin. He
remembered a college friend of his, one Medway, now reading for the Bar, who
had been the foremost scholar of his acquaintance; so with the scrap of paper
in his pocket he climbed one evening to Medway's rooms in the temple.</p>
<p>The man read the words curiously, and puzzled for a bit. "What's made you
take to Latin comps so late in life, Colin? It's baddish, you know, even for
you. I thought they'd have licked more into you at Eton."</p>
<p>Colin grinned with amusement "I'll tell you about it later," he said. "Can
you make out what it means?"</p>
<p>"It seems to be a kind of dog-Latin or monkish Latin or something of the
sort," said Medway. "It reads like this:</p>
<p>"'<i>Soles occidere solent</i>' (that's cribbed from Catullus, and besides
it's the regular monkish pun)... <i>qua</i>... then <i>blandula</i> something.
Then there's a lot of Choctaw, and then <i>illae insulae dilectae in quas
festinant somnia animulae gaudia</i>. That's pretty fair rot. Hullo, by George!
here's something better&mdash;<i>Insula pomorum insula vitae</i>. That's
Geoffrey of Monmouth."</p>
<p>He made a dive to a bookcase and pulled out a battered little calf-bound
duodecimo. "Here's all about your Isle of Apple-trees. Listen. 'Situate far out
in the Western ocean, beyond the Utmost Islands, beyond even the little Isle of
Sheep where the cairns of dead men are, lies the Island of Apple-trees where
the heroes and princes of the nations live their second life.'" He closed the
book and put it back. "It's the old ancient story, the Greek Hesperides, the
British Avilion, and this Apple-tree Island is the northern equivalent?"</p>
<p>Colin sat entranced, his memory busy with a problem. Could he distinguish
the scents of apple-trees among the perfumes of the Rim of the Mist. For the
moment he thought he could. He was roused by Medway's voice asking the story of
the writing.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's just some nonsense that was running in my head, so I wrote it down
to see what it was."</p>
<p>"But you must have been reading. A new exercise for you, Colin?"</p>
<p>"No, I wasn't reading. Look here. You know the sort of pictures you make for
yourself of places you like."</p>
<p>"Rather! Mine is a Devon moor with a little red shooting-box in the heart of
it."</p>
<p>"Well, mine is different. Mine is a sort of beach with a sea and a lot of
islands somewhere far out. It is a jolly place, fresh, you know, and blowing,
and smells good. 'Pon my word, now I think of it, there's always been a scent
of apples?"</p>
<p>"Sort of cider-press? Well, I must be off. You'd better come round to the
club and see the telegrams about the war. You should be keen about it."</p>
<p>One evening, a week later, Medway met a friend called Tillotson at the club,
and, being lonely, they dined together. Tillotson was a man of some note in
science, a dabbler in psychology, an amateur historian, a ripe genealogist.
They talked of politics and the war, of a new book, of Mrs. Runnymede, and
finally of their hobbies.</p>
<p>"I am Writing an article," said Tillotson. "Craikes asked me to do it for
the 'Monthly? It's on a nice point in psychics. I call it 'The Transmission of
Fallacies,' but I do not mean the logical kind. The question is, Can a
particular form of hallucination run in a family for generations. The proof
must, of course, come from my genealogical studies. I maintain it can. I
instance the Douglas-Ernotts, not one of whom can see straight with the left
eye. That is one side. In another class of examples I take the Drapiers, who
hate salt water and never go on board ship if they can help it. Then you re
member the Durwards? Old Lady Balcrynie used to tell me that no one of the lot
could ever stand the sight of a green frock. There's a chance for the romancer.
The Manorwaters have the same madness, only their colour is red."</p>
<p>A vague remembrance haunted Medway's brain.</p>
<p>"I know a man who might give you points from his own case. Did you ever meet
a chap Raden&mdash;Colin Raden?" Tillotson nodded. "Long chap&mdash;in the
Guards? 'Varsity oar, and used to be a crack bowler? No, I don't know him. I
know, him well by sight, and I should like to meet him tremendously&mdash;as a
genealogist, of course."</p>
<p>"Why?" asked Medway.</p>
<p>"Why? Because the man's family is unique. You never hear much about them
nowadays, but away up in that northwest corner of Scotland they have ruled
since the days of Noah. Why, man, they were aristocrats when our Howards and
Nevilles were green-grocers. I wish you would get this Raden to meet me some
night."</p>
<p>"I am afraid there's no chance of it just- at present," said Medway, taking
up an evening paper. "I see that his regiment has been ordered to the front.
But remind me when he comes back, and I'll be delighted."</p>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>And now there began for Colin a curious divided life,&mdash;without, a
constant shifting of scene, days of heat and bustle and toil,&mdash;within, a
slow, tantalising, yet exquisite adventure. The Rim of the Mist was now no more
the goal of his journeys, but the starting- point. Lying there, amid cool,
fragrant sea-winds, his fanciful ear was subtly alert for the sounds of the dim
land before him. Sleeping and waking the quest haunted him. As he flung himself
on his bed the kerosene-filled air would change to an ocean freshness, the old
boat would rock beneath him, and with clear eye and a boyish hope he would be
waiting and watching. And then suddenly he would be back on shore, Cuna and the
Acharra headland shining grey in the morning light, and with gritty mouth and
sand-filled eyes he would awaken to the heat of the desert camp.</p>
<p>He was kept busy, for his good-humour and energy made him a willing slave,
and he was ready enough for volunteer work when others were weak with heat and
despair. A thirty-mile ride left him unfired; more, he followed the campaign
with a sharp intelligence and found a new enthusiasm for his profession.
Discomforts there might be, but the days were happy; and then&mdash;the cool
land, the bright land, which was his for the thinking of it.</p>
<p>Soon they gave him reconnoitring work to do, and his wits were put to the
trial. He came well out of the thing; and earned golden praise from the silent
colonel in command. He enjoyed it as he had enjoyed a hard race on the river or
a good cricket match, and when his worried companions marvelled at his zeal he
stammered and grew uncomfortable. "How the deuce do you keep it up, Colin?" the
major asked him. "I'm an old hand at the job, and yet I've got a temper like
devilled bones. You seem as chirpy as if you were going out to fish a
chalk-stream on a June morning?'</p>
<p>"Well, the fact is&mdash;" and Cohn pulled himself up short, knowing that he
could never explain. He felt miserably that he had an unfair advantage of the
others. Poor Bellew, who groaned and swore in the heat at his side, knew
nothing of the Rim of the Mist. It was really rough luck on the poor beggars,
and who but himself was the fortunate man?</p>
<p>As the days passed a curious thing happened. He found fragments of the Other
world straying into his common life. The barriers of the two domains were
falling, and more than once he caught himself looking at a steel-blue sea when
his eyes should have found a mustard- coloured desert. One day, on a
reconnoitring expedition, they stopped for a little on a hillock above a jungle
of scrub, and, being hot and tired, scanned listlessly the endless yellow
distances.</p>
<p>"I suppose yon hill is about ten miles off," said Bellew with dry lips.</p>
<p>Colin looked vaguely. "I should say five?'</p>
<p>"And what's that below it&mdash;the black patch? Stones or scrub?"</p>
<p>Cohn was in a day-dream. "Why do you call it black? It's blue, quite
blue?'</p>
<p>"Rot," said the other. "It's grey- black?'</p>
<p>"No, it's water with the sun shining on it. It's blue, but just at the edges
it's very near sea-green?"</p>
<p>Bellew rose excitedly. "Hullo, Col, you're seeing the mirage! And you the
fittest of the lot of us! You've got the sun in your head, old man!"</p>
<p>"Mirage!" Colin cried in contempt. He was awake now, but the thought of
confusing his own bright western sea with a mirage gave him a curious pain. For
a moment he felt the gulf of separation between his two worlds, but only for a
moment. As the party remounted he gave his fancies the rein, and ere he reached
camp he had felt the oars in his hand and sniffed the apple-tree blossom from
the distant beaches.</p>
<p>The major came to him after supper.</p>
<p>"Bellew told me you saw the mirage to-day, Colin," he said. "I expect your
eyes are getting a bit bad. Better get your sand-spectacles out?"</p>
<p>Colin laughed. "Thanks. It's awfully good of you to bother, but I think
Bellew took me up wrong. I never was fitter in my life."</p>
<p>By-and-by the turn came for pride to be humbled. A low desert fever took
him, and though he went through the day as usual, it was with dreary lassitude;
and at night, with hot hands clasped above his damp hair, he found sleep a hard
goddess to conquer.</p>
<p>It was the normal condition of the others, so he had small cause to
complain, but it worked havoc with his fancies. He had never been ill since his
childish days, and this little fever meant much to one whose nature was poised
on a needlepoint. He found himself confronted with a hard bare world, with the
gilt rubbed from its corners. The Rim of the Mist seemed a place of vague
horrors; when he reached it his soul was consumed with terror; he struggled
impotently to advance; behind him Cuna and the Acharra coast seemed a place of
evil dreams. Again, as in his old fever, he was tormented with a devouring
thirst, but the sea beside him was not fresh, but brackish as a rock-pool. He
yearned for the apple-tree beaches in front; there, he knew, were cold springs
of water, the fresh smell of it was blown towards him in his nightmare.</p>
<p>But as the days passed and the misery for all grew more intense, an odd hope
began to rise in his mind. It could not last, coolness and health were waiting
near, and his reason for the hope came from the odd events at the Rim of the
Mist. The haze was clearing from the foreground, the surf-lined coast seemed
nearer, and though all was obscure save the milk-white sand and the foam, yet
here was earnest enough for him. Once more he became cheerful; weak and
light-headed he rode out again; and the major, who was recovering from
sunstroke, found envy take the place of pity in his soul.</p>
<p>The hope was near fulfilment. One evening when the heat was changing into
the cooler twilight, Colin and Bellew were sent with a small picked body to
scour the foothills above the river in case of a flank attack during the
night-march. It was work they had done regularly for weeks, and it is possible
that precautions were relaxed. At any rate, as they turned a corner of a hill,
in a sandy pass where barren rocks looked down on more barren thorn thickets, a
couple of rifle shots tang out from the scarp, and above them appeared a line
of dark faces and white steel. A mere handful, taken at a disadvantage, they
could not hope to disperse numbers, so Colin gave the word to wheel about and
return. Again shots rang out, and little Bellew had only time to catch at his
friend's arm to save him from falling from the saddle.</p>
<p>The word of command had scarcely left Colin's mouth when a sharp pain went
through his chest, and his breath seemed to catch and stop. He felt as in a
condensed moment of time the heat, the desert smell, the dust in his eyes and
throat, while he leaned helplessly forward on his horse's mane, Then the world
vanished for him... . The 'boat was rocking under him, the oars in his, hand.
He pulled and it moved, straight, arrow-like towards the forbidden shore. As if
under a great wind the mist furled up and fled. Scents of pines, of
apple-trees, of great fields of thyme and heather, hung about him; the sound of
wind in a forest, of cool waters falling in showers, of old moorland music,
came thin and faint with an exquisite clearness. A second and the boat was
among the surf, its gunwale ringed with white foam, as it leaped to the still
waters beyond. Clear and deep and still the water lay, and then the white
beaches shelved downward, and the boat grated on the sand. He turned, every
limb alert with a strange new life, crying out words which had shaped
themselves on his lips and which an echo seemed to catch and answer. There was
the green forest before him, the hills of peace, the cold white waters. With a
passionate joy he leaped on the beach, his arms outstretched to this new earth,
this light of the world, this old desire of the heart&mdash;youth, rapture,
immortality.</p>
<p>Bellew brought the body back to camp, himself half-dead with fatigue and
whimpering like a child. He almost fell from his horse, and when others took
his burden from him and laid it reverently in his tent, he stood beside it,
rubbing sand and sweat from his poor purblind eyes, his teeth chattering with
fever. He was given something to drink, but he swallowed barely a mouthful.</p>
<p>"It was some d-d-damned sharpshooter," he said. "Right through the breast,
and he never spoke to me again. My poor old Colt He was the best chap God ever
created, and I do-don't care a dash what becomes of me now. I was at school
with him, you know, you men."</p>
<p>"Was he killed outright?" asked the Major hoarsely.</p>
<p>"N-no. He lived for about five minutes. But I think the sun had got into his
head or he was mad with pain, for he d-d- didn't know where he was. He kept
crying out about the smell of pine-trees and heather and a lot of pure nonsense
about water."</p>
<p>"<i>Et dulces reminiscitur Argos</i>," somebody quoted mournfully, as they
went out to the desert evening.</p>
<h2><a name="story3" id="story3">THE WATCHER BY THE THRESHOLD</a></h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Atlantic Magazine</i>, Christmas 1900</h3>
<p>A chill evening in the early October of the year 189&mdash;found me driving
in a dogcart through the belts of antique woodland which form the lowland
limits of the hilly parish of More. The Highland express, which brought me from
the north, took me no farther than Perth. Thence it had been a slow journey in
a disjointed local train, till I emerged on the platform at Morefoot, with a
bleak prospect of pot stalks, coal heaps, certain sour corn lands, and far to
the west a line of moor where the sun was setting. A neat groom and a
respectable trap took the edge off my discomfort, and soon I had forgotten my
sacrifice and found eyes for the darkening landscape. We were driving through a
land of thick woods, cut at rare intervals by old long- frequented highways.
The More, which at Morefoot is an open sewer, became a sullen woodland stream,
where the brown leaves of the season drifted. At times we would pass an ancient
lodge, and through a gap in the trees would come a glimpse of chipped crowstep
gable. The names of such houses, as told me by my companion, were all famous.
This one had been the home of a drunken Jacobite laird, and a king of north
country Medmenham. Unholy revels had waked the old halls, and the devil had
been toasted at many a hell-fire dinner. The next was the property of a great
Scots law family, and there the old Lord of Session, who built the place, in
his frouzy wig and carpet slippers, had laid down the canons of Taste for his
day and society. The whole country had the air of faded and bygone gentility.
The mossy roadside walls had stood for two hundred years; the few wayside
houses were toll bars or defunct hostelries. The names, too, were great: Scots
baronial with a smack of France,&mdash;Chatelray and Riverslaw, Black Holm and
Fountainblue. The place had a cunning charm, mystery dwelt in every, cranny,
and yet it did not please me. The earth smelt heavy and raw; the roads were red
underfoot; all was old, sorrowful, and uncanny. Compared with the fresh
Highland glen I had left, where wind and sun and flying showers were never
absent, all was chilly and dull and dead. Even when the sun sent a shiver of
crimson over the crests of certain firs, I felt no delight in the prospect. I
admitted shamefacedly to myself that I was in a very bad temper.</p>
<p>I had been staying at Glenaicill with the Clanroydens, and for a week had
found the proper pleasure in life. You know the house with its old rooms and
gardens, and the miles of heather which defend it from the world. The shooting
had been extraordinary for a wild place late in the season; for there are few
partridges, and the woodcock are notoriously late. I had done respectably in my
stalking, more than respectably on the river, and creditably on the moors.
Moreover, there were pleasant people in the house&mdash;and there were the
Clanroydens. I had had a hard year's work, sustained to the last moment of
term, and a fortnight in Norway had been disastrous. It was therefore with real
comfort that I had settled myself down for another ten days in Glenaicill, when
all my plans were shattered by Sibyl's letter. Sibyl is my cousin and my very
good friend, and in old days when I was briefless I had fallen in love with her
many times. But she very sensibly chose otherwise, and married a man
Ladlaw&mdash;Robert John Ladlaw, who had been at school with me. He was a
cheery, good-humoured fellow, a great sportsman, a justice of the peace, and
deputy lieutenant for his county, and something of an antiquary in a mild way.
He had a box in Leicestershire to which he went in the hunting season, but from
February till October he lived in his moorland home. The place was called the
House of More, and I had shot at it once or twice in recent years. I remembered
its loneliness and its comfort, the charming diffident Sibyl, and Ladlaw's
genial welcome. And my recollections set me puzzling again over the letter
which that morning had broken into my comfort. 'You promised us a visit this
autumn,' Sibyl had written, 'and I wish you would come as soon as you can.' So
far common politeness. But she had gone on to reveal the fact that Ladlaw was
ill; she did not know how, exactly, but something, she thought, about his
heart. Then she had signed herself my affectionate cousin, and then had come a
short, violent postscript, in which, as it were, the fences of convention had
been laid low. 'For Heaven's sake, come and see us,' she scrawled below. 'Bob
is terribly ill, and I am crazy. Come at once.' To cap it she finished with an
afterthought: 'Don't bother about bringing doctors. It is not their
business.'</p>
<p>She had assumed that I would come, and dutifully I set out. I could not
regret my decision, but I took leave to upbraid my luck. The thought of
Glenaicill, with the woodcock beginning to arrive and the Clanroydens imploring
me to stay, saddened my journey in the morning, and the murky, coaly, midland
country of the afternoon completed my depression. The drive through the
woodlands of More failed to raise my spirits. I was anxious about Sibyl and
Ladlaw, and this accursed country had always given me a certain eeriness on my
first approaching it. You may call it silly, but I have no nerves and am little
susceptible to vague sentiment. It was sheer physical dislike of the rich deep
soil, the woody and antique smells, the melancholy roads and trees, and the
flavor of old mystery. I am aggressively healthy and wholly Philistine. I love
clear outlines and strong colors, and More with its half tints and hazy
distances depressed me miserably. Even when the road crept uphill and the trees
ended, I found nothing to hearten me in the moorland which succeeded. It was
genuine moorland, close on eight hundred feet above the sea, and through it ran
this old grass-grown coach road. Low hills rose to the left, and to the right,
after some miles of peat, flared the chimneys of pits and oil works. Straight
in front the moor ran out into the horizon, and there in the centre was the
last dying spark of the sun. The place was as still as the grave save for the
crunch of our wheels on the grassy road, but the flaring lights to the north
seemed to endow it with life. I have rarely had so keenly the feeling of
movement in the inanimate world. It was an unquiet place, and I shivered
nervously. Little gleams of loch came from the hollows, the burns were brown
with peat, and every now and then there rose in the moor jags of sickening red
stone. I remembered that Ladlaw had talked about the place as the old Manann,
the holy land of the ancient races. I had paid little attention at the time,
but now it struck me that the old peoples had been wise in their choice. There
was something uncanny in this soil and air. Framed in dank mysterious woods and
a country of coal and ironstone, at no great distance from the capital city, it
was a sullen relic of a lost barbarism. Over the low hills lay a green pastoral
country with bright streams and valleys, but here, in this peaty desert, there
were few sheep and little cultivation. The House of More was the only dwelling,
and, save for the ragged village, the wilderness was given over to the wild
things of the hills. The shooting was good, but the best shooting on earth
would not persuade me to make my abode in such a place. Ladlaw was ill; well, I
did not wonder. You can have uplands without air, moors that are not health-
giving, and a country life which is more arduous than a townsman's. I shivered
again, for I seemed to have passed in a few hours from the open noon to a kind
of dank twilight.</p>
<p>We passed the village and entered the lodge gates. Here there were trees
again&mdash;little innocent new-planted firs, which flourished ill. Some large
plane trees grew near the house, and there were thickets upon thickets of the
ugly elderberry. Even in the half darkness I could see that the lawns were trim
and the flower beds respectable for the season; doubtless Sibyl looked after
the gardeners. The oblong whitewashed house, more like a barrack than ever,
opened suddenly on my sight, and I experienced my first sense of comfort since
I left Glenaicill. Here I should find warmth and company; and sure enough, the
hall door was wide open, and in the great flood of light which poured from it
Sibyl stood to welcome me.</p>
<p>She ran down the steps as I dismounted, and, with a word to the groom,
caught my arm and drew me into the shadow. 'Oh, Henry, it was so good of you to
come. You mustn't let Bob think that you know he is ill. We don't talk about
it. I'll tell you afterwards. I want you to cheer him up. Now we must go in,
for he is in the hall expecting you.'</p>
<p>While I stood blinking in the light, Ladlaw came forward with outstretched
hand and his usual cheery greeting. I looked at him and saw nothing unusual in
his appearance; a little drawn at the lips, perhaps, and heavy below the eyes,
but still fresh-colored and healthy. It was Sibyl who showed change. She was
very pale, her pretty eyes were deplorably mournful, and in place of her
delightful shyness there were the self-confidence and composure of pain. I was
honestly shocked, and as I dressed my heart was full of hard thoughts about
Ladlaw. What could his illness mean? He seemed well and cheerful, while Sibyl
was pale; and yet it was Sibyl who had written the postscript. As I warmed
myself by the fire, I resolved that this particular family difficulty was my
proper business.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>The Ladlaws were waiting for me in the drawing-room. I noticed something new
and strange in Sibyl's demeanor. She looked to her husband with a motherly,
protective air, while Ladlaw, who had been the extreme of masculine
independence, seemed to cling to his wife with a curious appealing fidelity. In
conversation he did little more than echo her words. Till dinner was announced
he spoke of the weather, the shooting, and Mabel Clanroyden. Then he did a
queer thing; for when I was about to offer my arm to Sibyl he forestalled me,
and clutching her right arm with his left hand led the way to the dining room,
leaving me to follow in some bewilderment.</p>
<p>I have rarely taken part in a more dismal meal. The House of More has a
pretty Georgian paneling through most of the rooms, but in the dining room the
walls are level and painted a dull stone color. Abraham offered up Isaac in a
ghastly picture in front of me. Some photographs of the Quorn hung over the
mantelpiece, and five or six drab ancestors filled up the remaining space. But
one thing was new and startling. A great marble bust, a genuine antique,
frowned on me from a pedestal. The head was in the late Roman style, clearly of
some emperor, and in its commonplace environment the great brows, the massive
neck, and the mysterious solemn lips had a surprising effect. I nodded toward
the thing, and asked what it represented.</p>
<p>Ladlaw grunted something which I took for 'Justinian,' but he never raised
his eyes from his plate. By accident I caught Sibyl's glance. She looked toward
the bust, and laid a finger on her lips.</p>
<p>The meal grew more doleful as it advanced. Sibyl scarcely touched a dish,
but her husband ate ravenously of everything. He was a strong, thickset man,
with a square kindly face burned brown by the sun. Now he seemed to have
suddenly coarsened. He gobbled with undignified haste, and his eye was
extraordinarily vacant. A question made him start, and he would turn on me a
face so strange and inert that I repented the interruption.</p>
<p>I asked him about the autumn's sport. He collected his wits with difficulty.
He thought it had been good, on the whole, but he had shot badly. He had not
been quite so fit as usual. No, he had had nobody staying with him. Sibyl had
wanted to be alone. He was afraid the moor might have been undershot, but he
would make a big day with keepers and farmers before the winter.</p>
<p>'Bob has done pretty well,' Sibyl said. 'He hasn't been out often, for the
weather has been very bad here. You can have no idea, Henry, how horrible this
moorland place of ours can be when it tries. It is one great sponge sometimes,
with ugly red burns and mud to the ankles.'</p>
<p>'I don't think it's healthy,' said I.</p>
<p>Ladlaw lifted his face. 'Nor do I. I think it's intolerable, but I am so
busy I can't get away.'</p>
<p>Once again I caught Sibyl's warning eye as I was about to question him on
his business.</p>
<p>Clearly the man's brain had received a shock, and he was beginning to suffer
from hallucinations. This could be the only explanation, for he had always led
a temperate life. The distrait, wandering manner was the only sign of his
malady, for otherwise he seemed normal and mediocre as ever. My heart grieved
for Sibyl, alone with him in this wilderness.</p>
<p>Then he broke the silence. He lifted his head and looked nervously around
till his eye fell on the Roman bust.</p>
<p>'Do you know that this countryside is the old Manann?' he said.</p>
<p>It was an odd turn to the conversation, but I was glad of a sign of
intelligence. I answered that I had heard so.</p>
<p>'It's a queer name,' he said oracularly, 'but the thing it stood for was
queerer, Manann, Manaw,' he repeated, rolling the words on his tongue. As he
spoke, he glanced sharply, and, as it seemed to me, fearfully, at his left
side.</p>
<p>The movement of his body made his napkin slip from his left knee and fall on
the floor. It leaned against his leg, and he started from its touch as if he
had been bitten by a snake. I have never seen a more sheer and transparent
terror on a man's face. He got to his feet, his strong frame shaking like a
rush. Sibyl ran round to his side, picked up the napkin and flung it on a
sideboard. Then she stroked his hair as one would stroke a frightened horse.
She called him by his old boy's name of Robin, and at her touch and voice he
became quiet. But the particular course then in progress was removed,
untasted.</p>
<p>In a few minutes he seemed to have forgotten his behavior, for he took up
the former conversation. For a time he spoke well and briskly. 'You lawyers,'
he said, 'understand only the dry framework of the past. You cannot conceive
the rapture, which only the antiquary can feel, of constructing in every detail
an old culture. Take this Manann. If I could explore the secret of these moors,
I would write the world's greatest book. I would write of that prehistoric life
when man was knit close to nature. I would describe the people who were
brothers of the red earth and the red rock and the red streams of the hills.
Oh, it would be horrible, but superb, tremendous! It would be more than a piece
of history; it would be a new gospel, a new theory of life. It would kill
materialism once and for all. Why, man, all the poets who have deified and
personified nature would not do an eighth part of my work. I would show you the
unknown, the hideous, shrieking mystery at the back of this simple nature. Men
would see the profundity of the old crude faiths which they affect to despise.
I would make a picture of our shaggy, sombre-eyed forefather, who heard strange
things in the hill silences. I would show him brutal and terror-stricken, but
wise, wise, God alone knows how wise! The Romans knew it, and they learned what
they could from him, though he did not tell them much. But we have some of his
blood in us, and we may go deeper. Manann! A queer land nowadays! I sometimes
love it and sometimes hate it, but I always fear it. It is like that statue,
inscrutable.'</p>
<p>I would have told him that he was talking mystical nonsense, but I had
looked toward the bust, and my rudeness was checked on my lips. The moor might
be a common piece of ugly waste land, but the statue was inscrutable,&mdash; of
that there was no doubt. I hate your cruel heavy-mouthed Roman busts; to me
they have none of the beauty of life, and little of the interest of art. But my
eyes were fastened on this as they had never before looked on marble. The
oppression of the heavy woodlands, the mystery of the silent moor, seemed to be
caught and held in this face. It was the intangible mystery of culture on the
verge of savagery&mdash;a cruel, lustful wisdom, and yet a kind of bitter
austerity which laughed at the game of life and stood aloof. There was no
weakness in the heavy-veined brow and slumbrous eyelids. It was the face of one
who had conquered the world, and found it dust and ashes; one who had eaten of
the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and scorned human wisdom. And at
the same time, it was the face of one who knew uncanny things, a man who was
the intimate of the half-world and the dim background of life. Why on earth I
should connect the Roman grandee[*] with the moorland parish of More I cannot
say, but the fact remains that there was that in the face which I knew had
haunted me through the woodlands and bogs of the place&mdash;a sleepless,
dismal, incoherent melancholy.</p>
<p>[* I have identified the bust, which, when seen under other circumstances,
had little power to affect me. It was a copy of the head of Justinian in the
Tesci Museum at Venice, and several duplicates exist, dating apparently from
the seventh century, and showing traces of Byzantine decadence in the scroll
work on the hair. It is engraved in M. Delacroix's Byzantium, and, I think, in
Windscheid's Pandektenlehrbuch.]</p>
<p>'I bought that at Colenzo's,' Ladlaw said, 'because it took my fancy. It
matches well with this place?'</p>
<p>I thought it matched very ill with his drab walls and Quorn photographs, but
I held my peace.</p>
<p>'Do you know who it is?' he asked. 'It is the head of the greatest man the
world has ever seen. You are a lawyer and know your Justinian.'</p>
<p>The Pandects are scarcely part of the daily work of a common-law barrister.
I had not looked into them since I left college.</p>
<p>'I know that he married an actress,' I said, 'and was a sort of all-round
genius. He made law, and fought battles, and had rows with the Church. A
curious man! And wasn't there some story about his selling his soul to the
devil, and getting law in exchange? Rather a poor bargain!'</p>
<p>I chattered away, sillily enough, to dispel the gloom of that dinner table.
The result of my words was unhappy. Ladlaw gasped and caught at his left side,
as if in pain. Sibyl, with tragic eyes, had been making signs to me to hold my
peace. Now she ran round to her husband's side and comforted him like a child.
As she passed me, she managed to whisper in my ear to talk to her only, and let
her husband alone.</p>
<p>For the rest of dinner I obeyed my orders to the letter. Ladlaw ate his food
in gloomy silence, while I spoke to Sibyl of our relatives and friends, of
London, Glenaicill, and any random subject. The poor girl was dismally
forgetful, and her eye would wander to her husband with wifely anxiety. I
remember being suddenly overcome by the comic aspect of it all. Here were we
three fools alone in the dank upland: one of us sick and nervous, talking out-
of-the-way nonsense about Manann and Justinian, gobbling his food and getting
scared at his napkin; another gravely anxious; and myself at my wits' end for a
solution. It was a Mad Tea-Party with a vengeance: Sibyl the melancholy little
Dormouse, and Ladlaw the incomprehensible Hatter. I laughed aloud, but checked
myself when I caught my cousin's eye. It was really no case for finding humor.
Ladlaw was very ill, and Sibyl's face was getting deplorably thin.</p>
<p>I welcomed the end of that meal with unmannerly joy, for I wanted to speak
seriously with my host. Sibyl told the butler to have the lamps lighted in the
library. Then she leaned over toward me and spoke low and rapidly: 'I want you
to talk with Bob. I'm sure you can do him good. You'll have to be very patient
with him, and very gentle. Oh, please try to find out what is wrong with him.
He won't tell me, and I can only guess.'</p>
<p>The butler returned with word that the library was ready to receive us, and
Sibyl rose to go. Ladlaw half rose, protesting, making the most curious feeble
clutches to his side. His wife quieted him. 'Henry will look after you, dear,'
she said. 'You are going into the library to smoke.' Then she slipped from the
room, and we were left alone.</p>
<p>He caught my arm fiercely with his left hand, and his grip nearly made me
cry out. As we walked down the hall, I could feel his arm twitching from the
elbow to the shoulder. Clearly he was in pain, and I set it down to some form
of cardiac affection, which might possibly issue in paralysis.</p>
<p>I settled him in the biggest armchair, and took one of his cigars. The
library is the pleasantest room in the house, and at night, when a peat fire
burned on the old hearth and the great red curtains were drawn, it used to be
the place for comfort and good talk. Now I noticed changes. Ladlaw's
bookshelves had been filled with the Proceedings of antiquarian societies and
many light-hearted works on sport. But now the Badminton library had been
cleared out of a shelf where it stood most convenient to the hand, and its
place taken by an old Leyden reprint of Justinian. There were books on
Byzantine subjects of which I never dreamed he had heard the names; there were
volumes of history and speculation, all of a slightly bizarre kind; and to
crown everything, there were several bulky medical works with gaudily colored
plates. The old atmosphere of sport and travel had gone from the room with the
medley of rods, whips, and gun cases which used to cumber the tables. Now the
place was moderately tidy and somewhat learned, and I did not like it.</p>
<p>Ladlaw refused to smoke, and sat for a little while in silence. Then of his
own accord he broke the tension.</p>
<p>'It was devilish good of you to come, Harry. This is a lonely place for a
man who is a bit seedy.'</p>
<p>'I thought you might be alone,' I said, 'so I looked you up on my way down
from Glenaicill. I'm sorry to find you feeling ill.'</p>
<p>'Do you notice it?' he asked sharply.</p>
<p>'It's tolerably patent,' I said. 'Have you seen a doctor?'</p>
<p>He said something uncomplimentary about doctors, and kept looking at me with
his curious dull eyes.</p>
<p>I remarked the strange posture in which he sat, his head screwed round to
his right shoulder, and his whole body a protest against something at his left
hand.</p>
<p>'It looks like a heart,' I said. 'You seem to have pains in your left
side.'</p>
<p>Again a spasm of fear. I went over to him and stood at the back of his
chair.</p>
<p>'Now for goodness' sake, my dear fellow, tell me what is wrong. You're
scaring Sibyl to death. It's lonely work for the poor girl, and I wish you
would let me help you.'</p>
<p>He was lying back in his chair now, with his eyes half shut, and shivering
like a frightened colt. The extraordinary change in one who had been the
strongest of the strong kept me from realizing his gravity. I put a hand on his
shoulder, but he flung it off.</p>
<p>Tor God's sake, sit down!' he said hoarsely. 'I'm going to tell you, but
I'll never make you understand.'</p>
<p>I sat down promptly opposite him.</p>
<p>'It's the devil,' he said very solemnly.</p>
<p>I am afraid that I was rude enough to laugh. He took no notice, but sat,
with the same tense, miserable air, staring over my head.</p>
<p>'Right,' said I. 'Then it is the devil. It's a new complaint, so it's as
well I did not bring a doctor. How does it affect you?'</p>
<p>He made the old impotent clutch at the air with his left hand. I had the
sense to become grave at once. Clearly this was some serious mental affection,
some hallucination born of physical pain.</p>
<p>Then he began to talk in a low voice, very rapidly, with his head bent
forward like a hunted animal's. I am not going to set down what he told me in
his own words, for they were incoherent often, and there was much repetition.
But I am going to write the gist of the odd story which took my sleep away on
that autumn night, with such explanations and additions I think needful. The
fire died down, the wind arose, the hour grew late, and still he went on in his
mumbling recitative. I forgot to smoke, forgot my comfort&mdash;everything but
the odd figure of my friend and his inconceivable romance. And the night before
I had been in cheerful Glenaicill!</p>
<p>He had returned to the House of More, he said, in the latter part of May,
and shortly after he fell ill. It was a trifling sickness,&mdash;influenza or
something,&mdash;but he had never quite recovered. The rainy weather of June
depressed him, and the extreme heat of July made him listless and weary. A kind
of insistent sleepiness hung over him, and he suffered much from nightmare.
Toward the end of July his former health returned, but he was haunted with a
curious oppression. He seemed to himself to have lost the art of being alone.
There was a perpetual sound in his left ear, a kind of moving and rustling at
his left side, which never left him by night or day. In addition, he had become
the prey of nerves and an insensate dread of the unknown.</p>
<p>Ladlaw, as I have explained, was a commonplace man, with fair talents, a
mediocre culture, honest instincts, and the beliefs and incredulities of his
class. On abstract grounds, I should have declared him an unlikely man to be
the victim of an hallucination. He had a kind of dull bourgeois rationalism,
which used to find reasons for all things in heaven and earth. At first he
controlled his dread with proverbs. He told himself it was the sequel of his
illness or the light-headedness of summer heat on the moors. But it soon
outgrew his comfort. It became a living second presence, an alter ego which
dogged his footsteps. He grew acutely afraid of it. He dared not be alone for a
moment, and clung to Sibyl's company despairingly. She went off for a week's
visit in the beginning of August, and he endured for seven days the tortures of
the lost. The malady advanced upon him with swift steps. The presence became
more real daily. In the early dawning, in the twilight, and in the first hour
of the morning it seemed at times to take a visible bodily form. A kind of
amorphous featureless shadow would run from his side into the darkness, and he
would sit palsied with terror. Sometimes, in lonely places, his footsteps
sounded double, and something would brush elbows with him. Human society alone
exorcised it. With Sibyl at his side he was happy; but as soon as she left him,
the thing came slinking back from the unknown to watch by him. Company might
have saved him, but joined to his affliction was a crazy dread of his fellows.
He would not leave his moorland home, but must bear his burden alone among the
wild streams and mosses of that dismal place.</p>
<p>The 12th came, and he shot wretchedly, for his nerve had gone to pieces. He
stood exhaustion badly, and became a dweller about the doors. But with this
bodily inertness came an extraordinary intellectual revival. He read widely in
a blundering way, and he speculated unceasingly. It was characteristic of the
man that as soon as he left the paths of the prosaic he should seek his
supernatural in a very concrete form. He assumed that he was haunted by the
devil&mdash;the visible personal devil in whom our fathers believed. He waited
hourly for the shape at his side to speak, but no words came. The Accuser of
the Brethren in all but tangible form was his ever present companion. He felt,
he declared, the spirit of old evil entering subtly into his blood. He sold his
soul many times over, and yet there was no possibility of resistance. It was a
Visitation more undeserved than Job's, and a thousandfold more awful.</p>
<p>For a week or more he was tortured with a kind of religious mania. When a
man of a healthy secular mind finds himself adrift on the terrible ocean of
religious troubles he is peculiarly helpless, for he has not the most
rudimentary knowledge of the winds and tides. It was useless to call up his old
carelessness; he had suddenly dropped into a new world where old proverbs did
not apply. And all the while, mind you, there was the shrinking terror of
it&mdash;an intellect all alive to the torture and the most unceasing physical
fear. For a little he was on the far edge of idiocy.</p>
<p>Then by accident it took a new form. While sitting with Sibyl one day in the
library, he began listlessly to turn over the leaves of an old book. He read a
few pages, and found the hint to a story like his own. It was some French Life
of Justinian, one of the unscholarly productions of last century, made up of
stories from Procopius and tags of Roman law. Here was his own case written
down in black and white; and the man had been a king of kings. This was a new
comfort, and for a little&mdash;strange though it may seem&mdash;he took a sort
of pride in his affliction. He worshiped the great Emperor, and read every
scrap he could find on him, not excepting the Pandects and the Digest. He sent
for the bust in the dining room, paying a fabulous price. Then he settled
himself to study his imperial prototype, and the study became an idolatry. As I
have said, Ladlaw was a man of ordinary talents, and certainly of meagre
imaginative power. And yet from the lies of the Secret History and the
crudities of German legalists he had constructed a marvelous portrait of a man.
Sitting there in the half-lighted room, he drew the picture: the quiet cold man
with his inheritance of Dacian mysticism, holding the great world in fee,
giving it law and religion, fighting its wars, building its churches, and yet
all the while intent upon his own private work of making his peace with his
soul&mdash;the churchman and warrior whom all the world worshiped, and yet one
going through life with his lip quivering. He Watched by the Threshold ever at
the left side. Sometimes at night, in the great Brazen Palace, warders heard
the Emperor walking in the dark corridors, alone, and yet not alone; for once,
when a servant entered with a lamp, he saw his master with a face as of another
world, and something beside him which had no face or shape, but which he knew
to be that hoary Evil which is older than the stars.</p>
<p>Crazy nonsense! I had to rub my eyes to assure myself that I was not
sleeping. No! There was my friend with his suffering face, and it was the
library of More.</p>
<p>And then he spoke of Theodora,&mdash;actress, harlot, devote, empress. For
him the lady was but another part of the uttermost horror, a form of the
shapeless thing at his side. I felt myself falling under the fascination. I
have no nerves and little imagination, but in a flash I seemed to realize
something of that awful featureless face, crouching ever at a man's hand, till
darkness and loneliness come, and it rises to its mastery. I shivered as I
looked at the man in the chair before me. These dull eyes of his were looking
upon things I could not see, and I saw their terror. I realized that it was
grim earnest for him. Nonsense or no, some devilish fancy had usurped the place
of his sanity, and he was being slowly broken upon the wheel. And then, when
his left hand twitched, I almost cried out. I had thought it comic before; now
it seemed the last proof of tragedy.</p>
<p>He stopped, and I got up with loose knees and went to the window. Better the
black night than the intangible horror within. I flung up the sash and looked
out across the moor. There was no light; nothing but an inky darkness and the
uncanny rustle of elder bushes. The sound chilled me, and I closed the
window.</p>
<p>'The land is the old Manann,' Ladlaw was saying. 'We are beyond the pale
here. Do you hear the wind?'</p>
<p>I forced myself back into sanity and looked at my watch. It was nearly one
o'clock.</p>
<p>'What ghastly idiots we are!' I said. 'I am off to bed.'</p>
<p>Ladlaw looked at me helplessly. 'For God's sake, don't leave me alone!' he
moaned. 'Get Sibyl.'</p>
<p>We went together back to the hall, while he kept the same feverish grasp on
my arm. Some one was sleeping in a chair by the hall fire, and to my distress I
recognized my hostess. The poor child must have been sadly wearied. She came
forward with her anxious face.</p>
<p>'I'm afraid Bob has kept you very late, Henry,' she said. 'I hope you will
sleep well. Breakfast at nine, you know.' And then I left them.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Over my bed there was a little picture, a reproduction of some Italian work,
of Christ and the Demoniac. Some impulse made me hold my candle up to it. The
madman's face was torn with passion and suffering, and his eye had the pained
furtive expression which I had come to know. And by his left side there was a
dim shape crouching.</p>
<p>I got into bed hastily, but not to sleep. I felt that my reason must be
going. I had been pitchforked from our clear and cheerful modern life into the
mists of old superstition. Old tragic stories of my Calvinist upbringing
returned to haunt me. The man dwelt in by a devil was no new fancy, but I
believed that science had docketed and analyzed and explained the devil out of
the world. I remembered my dabblings in the occult before I settled down to
law&mdash;the story of Donisarius, the monk of Padua, the unholy legend of the
Face of Proserpine, the tales of succubi and incubi, the Leannain Sith and the
Hidden Presence. But here was something stranger still. I had stumbled upon
that very possession which fifteen hundred years ago had made the monks of New
Rome tremble and cross themselves. Some devilish occult force, lingering
through the ages, had come to life after a long sleep. God knows what earthly
connection there was between the splendid Emperor of the World and my prosaic
friend, or between the glittering shores of the Bosporus and this moorland
parish! But the land was the old Manann! The spirit may have lingered in the
earth and air, a deadly legacy from Pict and Roman. I had felt the uncanniness
of the place; I had augured ill of it from the first. And then in sheer disgust
I rose and splashed my face with cold water.</p>
<p>I lay down again, laughing miserably at my credulity. That I, the sober and
rational, should believe in this crazy fable was too palpably absurd. I would
steel my mind resolutely against such harebrained theories. It was a mere
bodily ailment&mdash;liver out of order, weak heart, bad circulation, or
something of that sort. At the worst it might be some affection of the brain,
to be treated by a specialist. I vowed to myself that next morning the best
doctor in Edinburgh should be brought to More.</p>
<p>The worst of it was that my duty compelled me to stand my ground. I foresaw
the few remaining weeks of my holiday blighted. I should be tied to this
moorland prison, a sort of keeper and nurse in one, tormented by silly fancies.
It was a charming prospect, and the thought of Glenaicill and the woodcock made
me bitter against Ladlaw. But there was no way out of it. I might do Ladlaw
good, and I could not have Sibyl worn to death by his vagaries.</p>
<p>My ill nature comforted me, and I forgot the horror of the thing in its
vexation. After that I think I fell asleep and dozed uneasily till morning.
When I woke I was in a better frame of mind. The early sun had worked wonders
with the moorland. The low hills stood out fresh-colored and clear against a
pale October sky; the elders sparkled with frost; the raw film of morn was
rising from the little loch in tiny clouds. It was a cold, rousing day, and I
dressed in good spirits and went down to breakfast.</p>
<p>I found Ladlaw looking ruddy and well; very different from the broken man I
remembered of the night before. We were alone, for Sibyl was breakfasting in
bed. I remarked on his ravenous appetite, and he smiled cheerily. He made two
jokes during the meal; he laughed often, and I began to forget the events of
the previous day. It seemed to me that I might still flee from More with a
clear conscience. He had forgotten about his illness. When I touched distantly
upon the matter he showed a blank face.</p>
<p>It might be that the affection had passed; on the other hand, it might
return to him at the darkening. I had no means to decide. His manner was still
a trifle distrait and peculiar, and I did not like the dullness in his eye. At
any rate, I should spend the day in his company, and the evening would decide
the question.</p>
<p>I proposed shooting, which he promptly vetoed. He was no good at walking, he
said, and the birds were wild. This seriously limited the possible occupations.
Fishing there was none, and hill-climbing was out of the question. He proposed
a game at billiards, and I pointed to the glory of the morning. It would have
been sacrilege to waste such sunshine in knocking balls about. Finally we
agreed to drive somewhere and have lunch, and he ordered the dogcart.</p>
<p>In spite of all forebodings I enjoyed the day. We drove in the opposite
direction from the woodland parts, right away across the moor to the coal
country beyond. We lunched at the little mining town of Borrowmuir, in a small
and noisy public house. The roads made bad going, the country was far from
pretty, and yet the drive did not bore me. Ladlaw talked incessantly&mdash;
talked as I had never heard man talk before. There was something indescribable
in all he said, a different point of view, a lost groove of thought, a kind of
innocence and archaic shrewdness in one. I can only give you a hint of it, by
saying that it was like the mind of an early ancestor placed suddenly among
modern surroundings. It was wise with a remote wisdom, and silly (now and then)
with a quite antique and distant silliness.</p>
<p>I will give instances of both. He provided me with a theory of certain early
fortifications, which must be true, which commends itself to the mind with
overwhelming conviction, and yet which is so out of the way of common
speculation that no man could have guessed it. I do not propose to set down the
details, for I am working at it on my own account. Again, he told me the story
of an old marriage custom, which till recently survived in this
district&mdash;told it with full circumstantial detail and constant allusions
to other customs which he could not possibly have known of. Now for the other
side. He explained why well water is in winter warmer than a running stream,
and this was his explanation: at the antipodes our winter is summer,
consequently, the water of a well which comes through from the other side of
the earth must be warm in winter and cold in summer, since in our summer it is
winter there. You perceive what this is. It is no mere silliness, but a genuine
effort of an early mind, which had just grasped the fact of the antipodes, to
use it in explanation.</p>
<p>Gradually I was forced to the belief that it was not Ladlaw who was talking
to me, but something speaking through him, something at once wiser and simpler.
My old fear of the devil began to depart. This spirit, the exhalation, whatever
it was, was ingenuous in its way, at least in its daylight aspect. For a moment
I had an idea that it was a real reflex of Byzantine thought, and that by
cross-examining I might make marvelous discoveries. The ardor of the scholar
began to rise in me, and I asked a question about that much-debated point, the
legal status of the apocrisiarii. To my vexation he gave no response. Clearly
the intelligence of this familiar had its limits.</p>
<p>It was about three in the afternoon, and we had gone half of our homeward
journey, when signs of the old terror began to appear. I was driving, and
Ladlaw sat on my left. I noticed him growing nervous and silent, shivering at
the flick of the whip, and turning halfway round toward me. Then he asked me to
change places, and I had the unpleasant work of driving from the wrong side.
After that I do not think he spoke once till we arrived at More, but sat
huddled together, with the driving rug almost up to his chin&mdash;an eccentric
figure of a man.</p>
<p>I foresaw another such night as the last, and I confess my heart sank. I had
no stomach for more mysteries, and somehow with the approach of twilight the
confidence of the day departed. The thing appeared in darker colors, and I
found it in my mind to turn coward. Sibyl alone deterred me. I could not bear
to think of her alone with this demented being. I remembered her shy timidity,
her innocence. It was monstrous that the poor thing should be called on thus to
fight alone with phantoms.</p>
<p>When we came to the House it was almost sunset. Ladlaw got out very
carefully on the right side, and for a second stood by the horse. The sun was
making our shadows long, and as I stood beyond him it seemed for a moment that
his shadow was double. It may have been mere fancy, for I had not time to look
twice. He was standing, as I have said, with his left side next the horse.
Suddenly the harmless elderly cob fell into a very panic of fright, reared
upright, and all but succeeded in killing its master. I was in time to pluck
Ladlaw from under its feet, but the beast had become perfectly unmanageable,
and we left a groom struggling to quiet it.</p>
<p>In the hall the butler gave me a telegram. It was from my clerk, summoning
me back at once to an important consultation.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Here was a prompt removal of my scruples. There could be no question of my
remaining, for the case was one of the first importance, which I had feared
might break off my holiday. The consultation fell in vacation time to meet the
convenience of certain people who were going abroad, and there was the most
instant demand for my presence. I must go, and at once; and, as I hunted in the
time-table, I found that in three hours' time a night train for the south would
pass Borrowmuir which might be stopped by special wire.</p>
<p>But I had no pleasure in my freedom. I was in despair about Sibyl, and I
hated myself for my cowardly relief. The dreary dining room, the sinister bust,
and Ladlaw crouching and quivering&mdash;the recollection, now that escape was
before me, came back on my mind with the terror of a nightmare. My first
thought was to persuade the Ladlaws to come away with me. I found them both in
the drawing-room&mdash;Sibyl very fragile and pale, and her husband sitting as
usual like a frightened child in the shadow of her skirts. A sight of him was
enough to dispel my hope. The man was fatally ill, mentally, bodily; and who
was I to attempt to minister to a mind diseased?</p>
<p>But Sibyl&mdash;she might be saved from the martyrdom. The servants would
take care of him, and, if need be, a doctor might be got from Edinburgh to live
in the house. So while he sat with vacant eyes staring into the twilight, I
tried to persuade Sibyl to think of herself. I am frankly a sun worshiper. I
have no taste for arduous duty, and the quixotic is my abhorrence. I labored to
bring my cousin to this frame of mind. I told her that her first duty was to
herself, and that this vigil of hers was beyond human endurance. But she had no
ears for my arguments.</p>
<p>'While Bob is ill I must stay with him,' she said always in answer, and then
she thanked me for my visit, till I felt a brute and a coward. I strove to
quiet my conscience, but it told me always that I was fleeing from my duty; and
then, when I was on the brink of a nobler resolution, a sudden overmastering
terror would take hold of me, and I would listen hysterically for the sound of
the dogcart on the gravel.</p>
<p>At last it came, and in a sort of fever I tried to say the conventional
farewells. I shook hands with Ladlaw, and when I dropped his hand it fell
numbly on his knee. Then I took my leave, muttering hoarse nonsense about
having had a 'charming visit,' and 'hoping soon to see them both in town.' As I
backed to the door, I knocked over a lamp on a small table. It crashed on the
floor and went out, and at the sound Ladlaw gave a curious childish cry. I
turned like a coward, and ran across the hall to the front door, and scrambled
into the dogcart.</p>
<p>The groom would have driven me sedately through the park, but I must have
speed or go mad. I took the reins from him and put the horse into a canter. We
swung through the gates and out into the moor road, for I could have no peace
till the ghoulish elder world was exchanged for the homely ugliness of
civilization. Once only I looked back, and there against the sky line, with a
solitary lit window, the House of More stood lonely in the red desert.</p>

<h2><a name="story4" id="story4">THE OUTGOING OF THE TIDE [*]</a></h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Atlantic Monthly</i>, January 1902</h3>
<p class="footnote">[* From the unpublished Remains of the Reverend John
Dennistoun. Sometime Minister of the Gospel in the Parish of Caulds, and
<i>Author of Satan's Artifices against the Elect</i>. ]</p>
<p class="quote" style="text-align: center">'Between the hours of twelve and
one, even at the turning of the tide.'</p>
<p>Men come from distant parts to admire the tides of Solway, which race in at
flood and retreat at ebb with a greater speed than a horse can follow. But
nowhere are there queerer waters than in our own parish of Caulds, at the place
called the Sker Bay, where between two horns of land a shallow estuary receives
the stream of the Sker. I never daunder by its shores and see the waters
hurrying like messengers from the great deep without solemn thoughts, and a
memory of Scripture words on the terror of the sea. The vast Atlantic may be
fearful in its wrath, but with us it is no clean open rage, but the deceit of
the creature, the unholy ways of quicksands when the waters are gone, and their
stealthy return like a thief in the night watches. But in times of which I
write there were more awful fears than any from the violence of nature. It was
before the day of my ministry in Caulds, for then I was a tot callant in short
clothes in my native parish of Lesmahagow; but the worthy Dr. Chrystal, who had
charge of spiritual things, has told me often of the power of Satan and his
emissaries in that lonely place. It was the day of warlocks and apparitions,
now happily driven out by the zeal of the General Assembly. Witches pursued
their wanchancy calling, bairns were spirited away, young lassies selled their
souls to the Evil One, and the Accuser of the Brethren, in the shape of a black
tyke, was seen about cottage doors in the gloaming. Many and earnest were the
prayers of good Dr. Chrystal, but the evil thing, in spite of his wrestling,
grew and flourished in his midst. The parish stank of idolatry, abominable
rites were practiced in secret, and in all the bounds there was no one had a
more evil name for the black traffic than one Alison Sempill, who bode at the
Skerburnfoot.</p>
<p>The cottage stood nigh the burn, in a little garden, with lilyoaks and
grosart bushes lining the pathway. The Sker ran by in a line among rowand
trees, and the noise of its waters was ever about the place. The highroad on
the other side was frequented by few, for a nearer-hand way to the west had
been made through the lower Moss. Sometimes a herd from the hills would pass by
with sheep, sometimes a tinkler or a wandering merchant, and once in a long
while the laird of Heriotside on his grey horse riding to Gledsmuir. And they
who passed would see Alion trupling in her garden, speaking to herself like the
ill wife she was, or sitting on a cutty-stool by the doorside, with her eyes on
other than mortal sights. Where she came from no man could tell. There were
some said she was no woman, but a ghost haunting some mortal tenement. Others
would threep she was gentrice, come of a persecuting family in the west, who
had been ruined in the Revolution wars. She never seemed to want for siller;
the house was as bright as a new preen, the yaird better delved than the manse
garden; and there was routh of fowls and doos about the small steading, forbye
a whee sheep and milk-kye in the fields. No man ever saw Alison at any market
in the countryside, and yet the Skerburnfoot was plenished yearly in all proper
order. One man only worked on the place, a doited lad who had long been a
charge to the parish, and who had not the sense to fear danger or the wit to
understand it. Upon all others the sight of Alison, were it but for a moment,
cast a cold grue, not to be remembered without terror. It seems she was not
ordinarily ill-famed, as men use the word. She was maybe sixty years in age,
small and trig, with her grey hair folded neatly under her mutch. But the sight
of her eyes was not a thing to forget. John Dodds said they were the een of a
deer with the Devil ahint them; and indeed, they would so appal an onlooker
that a sudden unreasoning terror came into his heart, while his feet would
impel him to flight. Once John, being overtaken in drink on the roadside by the
cottage, and dreaming that he was burning in hell, awoke and saw the old wife
hobbling toward him. Thereupon he fled soberly to the hills, and from that day
became a quiet-living, humble-minded Christian. She moved about the country
like a ghost, gathering herbs in dark loanings, lingering in kirkyairds, and
casting a blight on innocent bairns. Once Robert Smellie found her in a ruinous
kirk on the Lang Muir, where of old the idolatrous rites of Rome were
practiced. It was a hot day, and in the quiet place the flies buzzed in clouds,
and he noted that she sat clothed in them as with a garment, yet suffering no
discomfort. Then he, having mind of Beelzebub, the god of flies, fled without a
halt homewards; but, falling in the coo's loan, broke two ribs and a collar
bone, the whilk misfortune was much blessed to his soul. And there were darker
tales in the countryside, of weans stolen, of lassies misguided, of innocent
beasts cruelly tortured, and in one and all there came in the name of the wife
of the Skerburnfoot. It was noted by them that kenned best that her cantrips
were at their worst when the tides in the Sker Bay ebbed between the hours of
twelve and one. At this season of the night the tides of mortality run lowest,
and when the outgoing of these unco waters fell in with the setting of the
current of life, then indeed was the hour for unholy revels. While honest men
slept in their beds, the auld rudas carlines took their pleasure. That there is
a delight in sin no man denies, but to most it is but a broken glint in the
pauses of their conscience. But what must be the hellish joy of those lost
beings who have forsworn God, and trysted with the Prince of Darkness, it is
not for a Christian to say. Certain it is that it must be great, though their
master waits at the end of the road to claim the wizened things they call their
souls. Serious men&mdash;notably Gidden Scott in the Bach of the Hill, and
Simon Wanch in the Sheilin of Chasehope&mdash;have seen Alison wandering on the
wet sands, dancing to no earthy musick, while the heavens, they said, were full
of lights and sounds which betokened&mdash;the presence of the Prince of the
Powers of the Air. It was a season of heart-searching for God's saints in
Caulds, and the dispensation was blessed to not a few.</p>
<p>It will seem strange that in all this time the Presbytery was idle, and no
effort was made to rid the place of so fell an influence. But there was a
reason, and the reason, as in most like cases, was a lassie. Forbye Alison
there lived at the Skerburnfoot a young maid, Ailie Sempill, who by all
accounts was as good and bonnie as the other was evil. She passed for a
daughter of Alison's&mdash;whether born in wedlock or not I cannot tell; but
there were some said she was no kin to the auld witch wife, but some bairn
spirited away from honest parents. She was young and blithe, with a face like
an April morning, and a voice in her that put the laverocks to shame. When she
sang in the kirk, folk have told me that they had a foretaste of the musick of
the New Jerusalem, and when she came in by the village of Caulds old men
stottered to their doors to look at her. Moreover, from her earliest days the
bairn had some glimmerings of grace. Though no minister would visit the
Skerburnfoot, or, if he went, departed quicker than he came, the girl Ailie
attended regular at the catechising at the mains of Sker. It may be that Alison
thought she would be a better offering for the Devil if she were given the
chance of forswearing God, or it may be that she was so occupied in her own
dark business that she had no care of the bairn. Meanwhile, the lass grew up in
the nurture and admonition of the Lord. I have heard Dr. Chrystal say that he
never had a communicant more full of the things of the Spirit. From the day
when she first declared her wish to come forward to the hour when she broke
bread at the table, she walked like one in a dream. The lads of the parish
might cast admiring eyes on her bright cheeks and yellow hair, as she sat in
her white gown in the kirk, but well they knew she was not for them. To be the
bride of Christ was the thought that filled her heart; and when, at the fencing
of the table, Dr. Chrystal preached from Matthew nine and fifteen, 'Can the
children of the bridechamber mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them?' it
was remarked by sundry that Ailie's face was liker the countenance of an angel
than of a mortal lass.</p>
<p>It is with the day of her first communion that this narrative of mine
begins. As she walked home, after the morning table, she communed in secret,
and her heart sang within her. She had mind of God's mercies in the past; how
he had kept her feet from the snares of evil doers which had been spread around
her youth. She had been told unholy charms like the Seven South Streams and the
Nine Rowand Berries, and it was noted, when she went first to the catechising,
that she prayed, 'Our Father which wert in heaven,' the prayer which the ill
wife Alison had taught her; meaning by it Lucifer, who had been in heaven, and
had been cast out therefrom. But when she had come to years of discretion, she
had freely chosen the better part, and evil had ever been repelled from her
soul like gled water from the stones of Gled brig. Now she was in a rapture of
holy content. The Druchen Bell&mdash;for the ungodly fashion lingered in
Caulds&mdash;was ringing in her ears as she left the village, but to her it was
but a kirk bell and a goodly sound. As she went through the woods where the
primroses and the whitethorn were blossoming, the place seemed as the land of
Elim, wherein there were twelve wells and threescore and ten palm trees. And
then, as it might be, another thought came into her head, for it is ordained
that frail mortality cannot long continue in holy joy. In the kirk she had been
only the bride of Christ, but as she came through the wood, with the birds
lilting and the winds of the world blowing, she had mind of another lover; for
this lass, though so cold to men, had not escaped the common fate. It seems
that the young Heriotside, riding by one day, stopped to speir something or
other, and got a glisk of Ailie's face which caught his fancy. He passed the
road again many times, and then he would meet her in the gloaming, or of a
morning in the field as she went to fetch the kye. 'Blue are the hills that are
far away,' is an owercome in the countryside, and while at first on his side it
may have been but a young man's fancy, to her he was like the god Apollo
descending from the skies. He was good to look on, brawly dressed, and with a
tongue in his head that would have wiled the bird from the tree. Moreover, he
was of gentle kin, and she was a poor lass biding in a cot house with an ill-
reputed mother. It seems that in time the young man, who had begun the affair
with no good intentions, fell honestly in love, while she went singing about
the doors as innocent as a bairn, thinking of him when her thoughts were not on
higher things. So it came about that long ere Ailie reached home it was on
young Heriotside that her mind dwelled, and it was the love of him that made
her eyes glow and her cheeks redden.</p>
<p>Now it chanced that at that very hour her master had been with Alison, and
the pair of them were preparing a deadly pit. Let no man say that the Devil is
not a cruel tyrant. He may give his folk some scrapings of unhallowed pleasure,
but he will exact tithes, yea, of anise and cummin, in return, and there is aye
the reckoning to pay at the hinder end. It seems that now he was driving Alison
hard. She had been remiss of late&mdash;fewer souls sent to hell, less zeal in
quenching the Spirit, and, above all, the crowning offense that her bairn had
communicated in Christ's kirk. She had waited overlong, and now it was like
that Ailie would escape her toils. I have no skill of fancy to tell of that
dark collogue, but the upshot was that Alison swore by her lost soul and the
pride of sin to bring the lass into thrall to her master. The fiend had bare
departed when Ailie came over the threshold to find the auld carline glunching
over the fire.</p>
<p>It was plain she was in the worst of tempers. She flyted on the lass till
the poor thing's cheek paled. 'There you gang,' she cries, 'broking wi' thae
wearifu' Pharisees o' Caulds, whae daurna darken your mither's door! A bonnie
dutiful child, quotha! Wumman, hae ye nae pride, or even the excuse o' a
tinkler-lass?' And then she changed her voice and would be as saft as honey:
'My puir wee Ailie, was I thrawn till ye? Never mind, my bonnie. You and me are
a' that's left, and we maunna be ill to ither.' And then the two had their
dinner, and all the while the auld wife was crooning over the lass. 'We maun
'gree weel,' she says, 'for we 're like to be our lee-lane for the rest o' our
days. They tell me Heriotside is seeking Joan o' the Croft, and they're sune to
be cried in Gledsmuir's kirk.'</p>
<p>It was the first the lass had heard of it, and you may fancy she was struck
dumb. And so with one thing and other the auld witch raised the fiends of
jealousy in that innocent heart. She would cry out that Heriotside was an
ill-doing wastrel, and had no business to come and flatter honest lassies. And
then she would speak of his gentle birth and his leddy mother, and say it was
indeed presumption to hope that so great a gentleman could mean all that he
said. Before long Ailie was silent and white, while her mother rimed on about
men and their ways. And then she could thole it no longer, but must go out and
walk by the burn to cool her hot brow and calm her thoughts, while the witch
indoors laughed to herself at her devices.</p>
<p>For days Ailie had an absent eye and a sad face, and it so fell out that in
all that time young Heriotside, who had scarce missed a day, was laid up with a
broken arm and never came near her. So in a week's time she was beginning to
hearken to her mother when she spoke of incantations and charms for restoring
love. She kenned it was sin, but though not seven days syne she had sat at the
Lord's table, so strong is love in a young heart that she was on the very brink
of it. But the grace of God was stronger than her weak will. She would have
none of her mother's runes and philters, though her soul cried out for them.
Always when she was most disposed to listen some merciful power stayed her
consent. Alison grew thrawner as the hours passed. She kenned of Heriotside's
broken arm, and she feared that any day he might recover and put her stratagems
to shame. And then it seems that she collogued with her master and heard word
of a subtler device. For it was approaching that uncanny time of year, the
festival of Beltane, when the auld pagans were wont to sacrifice to their god
Baal. In this season warlocks and carlines have a special dispensation to do
evil, and Alison waited on its coming with graceless joy. As it happened, the
tides in the Sker Bay ebbed at this time between the hours of twelve and one,
and, as I have said, this was the hour above all others when the Powers of
Darkness were most potent. Would the lass but consent to go abroad in the
unhallowed place at this awful season and hour of the night, she was as firmly
handfasted to the Devil as if she had signed a bond with her own blood; for
then, it seemed, the forces of good fled far away, the world for one hour was
given over to its ancient prince, and the man or woman who willingly sought the
spot was his bondservant forever. There are deadly sins from which God's people
may recover. A man may even communicate unworthily, and yet, so be it he sin
not against the Holy Ghost, he may find forgiveness. But it seems that for the
Beltane sin there could be no pardon, and I can testify from my own knowledge
that they who once committed it became lost souls from that day. James Denchar,
once a promising professor, fell thus out of sinful bravery and died
blaspheming; and of Kate Mallison, who went the same road, no man can tell.
Here indeed was the witch wife's chance; and she was the more keen, for her
master had warned her that this was her last chance. Either Ailie's soul would
be his, or her auld wrunkled body and black heart would be flung from this
pleasant world to their apportioned place.</p>
<p>Some days later it happened that young Heriotside was stepping home over the
Lang Muir about ten at night, it being his first jaunt from home since his arm
had mended. He had been to the supper of the Forest Club at the Cross Keys in
Gledsmuir, a clamjamphry of wild young blades who passed the wine and played at
cartes once a fortnight. It seems he had drunk well, so that the world ran
round about and he was in the best of tempers. The moon came down and bowed to
him, and he took off his hat to it. For every step he traveled miles, so that
in a little he was beyond Scotland altogether and pacing the Arabian desert. He
thought he was the Pope of Rome, so he held out his foot to be kissed, and
rolled twenty yards to the bottom of a small brae. Syne he was the king of
France, and fought hard with a whin bush till he had banged it to pieces. After
that nothing would content him but he must be a bogle, for he found his head
dunting on the stars and his legs were knocking the hills together. He thought
of the mischief he was doing to the auld earth, and sat down and cried at his
wickedness. Then he went on, and maybe the steep road to the Moss Rig helped
him, for he began to get soberer and ken his whereabouts.</p>
<p>On a sudden he was aware of a man linking along at his side. He cried a fine
night, and the man replied. Syne, being merry from his cups, he tried to slap
him on the back. The next he kenned he was rolling on the grass, for his hand
had gone clean through the body and found nothing but air.</p>
<p>His head was so thick with wine that he found nothing droll in this. 'Faith,
friend,' he says, 'that was a nasty fall for a fellow that has supped weel.
Where might your road be gaun to?'</p>
<p>'To the World's End,' said the man, 'but I stop at the Skerburnfoot.' 'Bide
the night at Heriotside,' says he. 'It's a thought out of your way, but it's a
comfortable bit.'</p>
<p>'There's mair comfort at the Skerburnfoot,' said the dark man.</p>
<p>Now the mention of the Skerburnfoot brought back to him only the thought of
Ailie, and not of the witch wife, her mother. So he jaloused no ill, for at the
best he was slow in the uptake.</p>
<p>The two of them went on together for a while, Heriotside's fool head filled
with the thought of the lass. Then the dark man broke silence. 'Ye 're thinkin'
o' the maid Ailie Sempill,' says he.</p>
<p>'How ken ye that?' asked Heriotside.</p>
<p>'It is my business to read the hearts o' men,' said the other. 'And who may
ye be?' said Heriotside, growing eerie.</p>
<p>'Just an auld packman,' says he, 'nae name ye wad ken, but kin to mony
gentle houses.'</p>
<p>'And what about Ailie, you that ken sae muckle?' asked the young man.</p>
<p>Naething,' was the answer,&mdash;'naething that concerns you, for ye'll
never get the lass.'</p>
<p>'By God and I will!' says Heriotside, for he was a profane swearer. 'That's
the wrong name to seek her in, ony way,' said the man.</p>
<p>At this the young laird struck a great blow at him with his stick, but found
nothing to resist him but the hill wind.</p>
<p>When they had gone on a bit the dark man spoke again. 'The lassie is thirled
to holy things,' says he; 'she has nae care for flesh and blood,&mdash;only for
devout contemplation.'</p>
<p>'She loves me,' says Heriotside.</p>
<p>Not you,' says the other, 'but a shadow in your stead.'</p>
<p>At this the young man's heart began to tremble, for it seemed that there was
truth in what his companion said, and he was owerdrunk to think gravely.</p>
<p>'I kenna whatna man ye are,' he says, 'but ye have the skill of lassies'
hearts. Tell me truly, is there no way to win her to common love?'</p>
<p>'One way there is,' said the man, 'and for our friendship's sake I will tell
you it. If ye can ever tryst wi' her on Beltane's E'en on the Sker sands, at
the green link o' the burn where the sands begin, on the ebb o' the tide when
the midnight is by, but afore cockcrow, she'll be yours, body and soul, for
this world and forever.'</p>
<p>And then it appeared to the young man that he was walking his love up the
grass walk of Heriotside, with the house close by him. He thought no more of
the stranger he had met, but the word stuck in his heart.</p>
<p>It seems that about this very time Alison was telling the same tale to poor
Ailie. She cast up to her every idle gossip she could think of. 'It's Joan o'
the Croft,' was aye her owercome, and she would threep that they were to be
cried in kirk on the first Sabbath of May. And then she would rime on about the
black cruelty of it, and cry down curses on the lover, so that her daughter's
heart grew cauld with fear. It is terrible to think of the power of the world
even in a redeemed soul. Here was a maid who had drunk of the well of grace and
tasted of God's mercies, and yet there were moments when she was ready to
renounce her hope. At those awful seasons God seemed far off and the world very
nigh, and to sell her soul for love looked a fair bargain; at other times she
would resist the Devil and comfort herself with prayer; but aye when she awoke
there was the sore heart, and when she went to sleep there were the weary eyes.
There was no comfort in the goodliness of spring or the bright sunshine
weather, and she who had been wont to go about the doors lightfoot and blithe
was now as dowie as a widow woman.</p>
<p>And then one afternoon in the hinder end of April came young Heriotside
riding to the Skerburnfoot. His arm was healed, he had got him a fine new suit
of green, and his horse was a mettle beast that well set off his figure. Ailie
was standing by the doorstep as he came down the road, and her heart stood
still with joy. But a second thought gave her anguish. This man, so gallant and
braw, would never be for her; doubtless the fine suit and the capering horse
were for Joan o' the Croft's pleasure. And he, in turn, when he remarked her
wan cheeks and dowie eyes, had mind to what the dark man said on the muir, and
saw in her a maid sworn to no mortal love. Yet his passion for her had grown
fiercer than ever, and he swore to himself that he would win her back from her
phantasies. She, one may believe, was ready enough to listen. As she walked
with him by the Sker water his words were like musick to her ears, and Alison
within doors laughed to herself and saw her devices prosper.</p>
<p>He spoke to her of love and his own heart, and the girl hearkened gladly.
Syne he rebuked her coldness and cast scorn upon her piety, and so far was she
beguiled that she had no answer. Then from one thing and another he spoke of
some true token of their love. He said he was jealous, and craved something to
ease his care. 'It's but a small thing I ask,' says he, 'but it will make me a
happy man, and nothing ever shall come atween us. Tryst wi' me for Beltane's
E'en on the Sker sands, at the green link o' the burn where the sands begin, on
the ebb o' the tide when midnight is by, but afore cockcrow. For,' said he,
'that was our forbears' tryst for true lovers, and wherefore no for you and
me?'</p>
<p>The lassie had grace given her to refuse, but with a woeful heart, and
Heriotside rode off in black discontent, leaving poor Ailie to sigh her love.
He came back the next day and the next, but aye he got the same answer. A
season of great doubt fell upon her soul. She had no clearness in her hope, nor
any sense of God's promises. The Scriptures were an idle tale to her, prayer
brought her no refreshment, and she was convicted in her conscience of the
unpardonable sin. Had she been less full of pride, she would have taken her
troubles to good Dr. Chrystal and got comfort; but her grief made her silent
and timorous, and she found no help anywhere. Her mother was ever at her side,
seeking with coaxings and evil advice to drive her to the irrevocable step. And
all the while there was her love for the man riving in her bosom, and giving
her no ease by night or day. She believed she had driven him away, and repented
her denial. Only her pride held her back from going to Heriotside and seeking
him herself. She watched the road hourly for a sight of his face, and when the
darkness came she would sit in a corner brooding over her sorrows.</p>
<p>At last he came, speiring the old question. He sought the same tryst, but
now he had a further tale. It seemed he was eager to get her away from the
Skerburnside and auld Alison. His aunt, Lady Balerynie, would receive her
gladly at his request till the day of their marriage; let her but tryst with
him at the hour and place he named, and he would carry her straight to
Balerynie, where she would be safe and happy. He named that hour, he said, to
escape men's observation, for the sake of her own good name. He named that
place, for it was near her dwelling, and on the road between Balerynie and
Heriotside, which fords the Sker Burn. The temptation was more than mortal
heart could resist. She gave him the promise he sought, stifling the voice of
conscience; and as she clung to his neck it seemed to her that heaven was a
poor thing compared with a man's love.</p>
<p>Three days remained till Beltane's E'en, and throughout this time it was
noted that Heriotside behaved like one possessed. It may be that his conscience
pricked him, or that he had a glimpse of his sin and its coming punishment.
Certain it is that if he had been daft before, he now ran wild in his pranks,
and an evil report of him was in every mouth. He drank deep at the Cross Keys,
and fought two battles with young lads that had angered him. One he let off
with a touch on the shoulder; the other goes lame to this day from a wound he
got in the groin. There was word of the procurator fiscal taking note of his
doings, and troth, if they had continued long he must have fled the country.
For a wager he rode his horse down the Dow Craig, wherefore the name of the
place has been the Horseman's Craig ever since. He laid a hundred guineas with
the laird of Slofferfield that he would drive four horses through the
Slofferfield loch, and in the prank he had his bit chariot dung to pieces and a
good mare killed. And all men observed that his eyes were wild and the face
grey and thin, and that his hand would twitch, as he held the glass, like one
with the palsy.</p>
<p>The Eve of Beltane was lower and hot in the low country, with fire hanging
in the clouds and thunder grumbling about the heavens. It seems that up in the
hills it had been an awesome deluge of rain, but on the coast it was still dry
and lowering. It is a long road from Heriotside to the Skerburnfoot. First you
go down the Heriot water, and syne over the Lang Muir to the edge of
Mucklewhan. When you pass the steadings of Mirehope and Cockmalane, you turn to
the right and ford the Mire Burn. That brings you on to the turnpike road,
which you will ride till it bends inland, while you keep on straight over the
Whinny Knowes to the Sker Bay. There, if you are in luck, you will find the
tide out and the place fordable dryshod for a man on a horse. But if the tide
runs, you will do well to sit down on the sands and content yourself till it
turn, or it will be the solans and scarts of the Solway that will be seeing the
next of you. On this Beltane's E'en, the young man, after supping with some
wild young blades, bade his horse be saddled about ten o'clock. The company
were eager to ken his errand, but he waved them back. 'Bide here,' he says,
'and boil the wine till I return. This is a ploy of my own on which no man
follows me.' And there was that in his face, as he spoke, which chilled the
wildest, and left them well content to keep to the good claret and the saft
seat, and let the daft laird go his own ways.</p>
<p>Well and on he rode down the bridle path in the wood, along the top of the
Heriot glen, and as he rode he was aware of a great noise beneath him. It was
not wind, for there was none, and it was not the sound of thunder; and aye as
he speired at himself what it was it grew the louder, till he came to a break
in the trees. And then he saw the cause, for Heriot was coming down in a
furious flood, sixty yards wide, tearing at the roots of the aiks and flinging
red waves against the drystone dykes. It was a sight and sound to solemnise a
man's mind, deep calling unto deep, the great waters of the hills running to
meet with the great waters of the sea. But Heriotside recked nothing of it, for
his heart had but one thought and the eye of his fancy one figure. Never had he
been so filled with love of the lass; and yet it was not happiness, but a
deadly, secret fear.</p>
<p>As he came to the Lang Muir it was gey and dark, though there was a moon
somewhere behind the clouds. It was little he could see of the road, and ere
long he had tried many moss pools and sloughs, as his braw new coat bare
witness. Aye in front of him was the great hill of Mucklewhan, where the road
turned down by the Mire. The noise of the Heriot had not long fallen behind him
ere another began, the same eerie sound of burns crying to ither in the
darkness. It seemed that the whole earth was overrun with waters. Every little
runnel in the bay was astir, and yet the land around him was as dry as flax,
and no drop of rain had fallen. As he rode on the din grew louder, and as he
came over the top of Mirehope he kenned by the mighty rushing noise that
something uncommon was happening with the Mire Burn. The light from Mirehope
Sheilin twinkled on his left, and had the man not been dozened with his fancies
he might have observed that the steading was deserted and men were crying below
in the fields. But he rode on, thinking of but one thing, till he came to the
cot house of Cockmalane, which is nigh the fords of the Mire.</p>
<p>John Dodds, the herd who bode in the place, was standing at the door, and he
looked to see who was on the road so late.</p>
<p>'Stop!' says he,&mdash;'stop, Laird Heriotside! I kenna what your errand is,
but it is to no holy purpose that ye're out on Beltane E'en. D' ye no hear the
warring o' the waters?'</p>
<p>And then in the still night came the sound of Mire like the clash of
armies.</p>
<p>'I must win over the ford,' says the laird quickly, thinking of another
thing.</p>
<p>'Ford!' cried John, in scorn. 'There'll be nae ford for you the nicht unless
it was the ford o' the river Jordan. The burns are up and bigger than man ever
saw them. It'll be a Beltane's E'en that a' folk will remember. They tell me
that Gled valley is like a loch, and that there's an awesome heap o' folk
drouned in the hills. Gin ye were ower the Mire, what about crossin' the Caulds
and the Sker?' says he, for he jaloused he was going to Gledsmuir.</p>
<p>And then it seemed that that word brought the laird to his senses. He looked
the airt the rain was coming from, and he saw it was the airt the Sker flowed.
In a second, he has told me, the works of the Devil were revealed to him. He
saw himself a tool in Satan's hands; he saw his tryst a device for the
destruction of the body as it was assuredly meant for the destruction of the
soul; and there came black on his mind the picture of an innocent lass borne
down by the waters, with no place for repentance. His heart grew cold in his
breast. He had but one thought,&mdash;a sinful and reckless one: to get to her
side, that the two might go together to their account. He heard the roar of the
Mire as in a dream, and when John Dodds laid hands on his bridle he felled him
to the earth. And the next seen of it was the laird riding the floods like a
man possessed.</p>
<p>The horse was the grey stallion he aye rode, the very beast he had ridden
for many a wager with the wild lads of the Cross Keys. No man but himself durst
back it, and it had lamed many a hostler lad and broke two necks in its day.
But it seems it had the mettle for any flood, and took the Mire with little
spurring. The herds on the hillside looked to see man and steed swept into
eternity; but though the red waves were breaking about his shoulders, and he
was swept far down, he aye held on for the shore. The next thing the watchers
saw was the laird struggling up the far bank and casting his coat from him, so
that he rode in his sark. And then he set off like a wildfire across the muir
toward the turnpike road. Two men saw him on the road, and have recorded their
experience. One was a gangrel, by name McNab, who was travelling from Gledsmuir
to Allerkirk with a heavy pack on his back and a bowed head. He heard a sound
like wind afore him, and, looking up, saw coming down the road a grey horse
stretched out to a wild gallop, and a man on its back with a face like a soul
in torment. He kenned not whether it was devil or mortal, but flung himself on
the roadside and lay like a corp for an hour or more, till the rain aroused
him. The other was one Sim Doolittle, the fish hawker from Allerfoot, jogging
home in his fish cart from Gledsmuir fair. He had drunk more than was fit for
him, and he was singing some light song, when he saw approaching, as he said,
the pale horse mentioned in the Revelation, with Death seated as the rider.
Thought of his sins came on him like a thunderclap; fear loosened his knees. He
leaped from the cart to the road, and from the road to the back of a dyke;
thence he flew to the hills, and was found the next morning far up among the
Mire Craigs, while his horse and cart were gotten on the Aller sands, the horse
lamed and the cart without the wheels.</p>
<p>At the tollhouse the road turns inland to Gledsmuir, and he who goes to the
Sker Bay must leave it and cross the wild land called the Whinny Knowes, a
place rough with bracken and foxes' holes and old stone cairns. The toll-man,
John Gilzean, was opening the window to get a breath of air in the lower night,
when he heard or saw the approaching horse. He kenned the beast for
Heriotside's, and, being a friend of the laird's, he ran down in all haste to
open the yen, wondering to himself about the laird's errand on this night. A
voice came down the road to him bidding him hurry; but John's old fingers were
slow with the keys, and so it happened that the horse had to stop, and John had
time to look up at the gast and woeful face.</p>
<p>'Where away the nicht sae late, laird?' says John.</p>
<p>'I go to save a soul from hell,' was the answer.</p>
<p>And then it seems that through the open door there came the chapping of a
clock.</p>
<p>Whatna hour is that?' asks Heriotside.</p>
<p>'Midnicht,' says John, trembling, for he did not like the look of
things.</p>
<p>There was no answer but a groan, and horse and man went racing down the dark
hollows of the Whinny Knowes.</p>
<p>How he escaped a broken neck in that dreadful place no human being will ever
ken. The sweat, he has told me, stood in cold drops upon his forehead; he
scarcely was aware of the saddle in which he sat, and his eyes were stelled in
his head so that he saw nothing but the sky ayont him. The night was growing
colder, and there was a small sharp wind stirring from the east. But hot or
cold, it was all one to him, who was already cold as death. He heard not the
sound of the sea nor the peeseweeps startled by his horse, for the sound that
ran in his ears was the roaring Sker water and a girl's cry. The thought kept
goading him, and he spurred the grey horse till the creature was madder than
himself. It leaped the hole which they call the Devil's Mull as I would step
over a thristle, and the next he kenned he was on the edge of the Sker Bay.</p>
<p>It lay before him white and ghaistly, with mist blowing in wafts across it
and a slow swaying of the tides. It was the better part of a mile wide, but
save for some fathoms in the middle, where the Sker current ran, it was no
deeper even at flood than a horse's fetlocks. It looks eerie at bright midday,
when the sun is shining and whaups are crying among the seaweeds; but think
what it was on that awesome night, with the Powers of Darkness brooding over it
like a cloud! The rider's heart quailed for a moment in natural fear. He
stepped his beast a few feet in, still staring afore him like a daft man. And
then something in the sound or the feel of the waters made him look down, and
he perceived that the ebb had begun and the tide was flowing out to sea.</p>
<p>He kenned that all was lost, and the knowledge drove him to stark despair.
His sins came in his face like birds of night, and his heart shrunk like a pea.
He knew himself for a lost soul, and all that he loved in the world was out in
the tides. There, at any rate, he could go, too, and give back that gift of
life he had so blackly misused. He cried small and saft like a bairn, and drove
the grey out into the water. And aye as he spurred it the foam should have been
flying as high as his head, but in that uncanny hour there was no foam; only
the waves running sleek like oil. It was not long ere he had come to the Sker
channel, where the red moss waters were roaring to the sea,&mdash;an ill place
to ford in midsummer heat, and certain death, as folk reputed it, at the
smallest spate. The grey was swimming; but it seemed the Lord had other
purposes for him than death, for neither man nor horse could droun. He tried to
leave the saddle, but he could not; he flung the bridle from him, but the grey
held on as if some strong hand were guiding. He cried out upon the Devil to
help his own; he renounced his Maker and his God: but whatever his punishment,
he was not to be drouned. And then he was silent, for something was coming down
the tide.</p>
<p>It came down as quiet as a sleeping bairn, straight for him as he sat with
his horse breasting the waters; and as it came the moon crept out of a cloud,
and he saw a glint of yellow hair. And then his madness died away, and he was
himself again, a weary and stricken man. He hung down over the tide and caught
the body in his arms, and then let the grey make for the shallows. He cared no
more for the Devil and all his myrmidons, for he kenned brawly he was damned.
It seemed to him that his soul had gone from him, and he was as toom as a hazel
shell. His breath rattled in his throat, the tears were dried up in his head,
his body had lost its strength, and yet he clung to the drouned maid as to a
hope of salvation. And then he noted something at which he marvelled dumbly.
Her hair was drookit back from her clay-cold brow, her eyes were shut, but in
her face there was the peace of a child; it seemed even that her lips were
smiling. Here, certes, was no lost soul, but one who had gone joyfully to meet
her Lord. It may be in that dark hour at the burn-foot, before the spate caught
her, she had been given grace to resist her adversary and fling herself upon
God's mercy. And it would seem that it had been granted; for when he came to
the Skerburnfoot, there in the corner sat the weird wife Alison, dead as a
stone.</p>
<p>For days Heriotside wandered the country, or sat in his own house with
vacant eye and trembling hands. Conviction of sin held him like a vice: he saw
the lassie's death laid at his door; her face haunted him by day and night, and
the word of the Lord dirled in his ears, telling of wrath and punishment. The
greatness of his anguish wore him to a shadow, and at last he was stretched on
his bed and like to perish. In his extremity worthy Dr. Chrystal went to him
unasked, and strove to comfort him. Long, long the good man wrestled, but it
seemed as if his ministrations were to be of no avail. The fever left his body,
and he rose to stotter about the doors; but he was still in his torments, and
the mercy-seat was far from him. At last in the back end of the year came Mungo
Muirhead to Caulds to the autumn communion, and nothing would serve him but he
must try his hand at the storm-tossed soul. He spoke with power and unction,
and a blessing came with his words: the black cloud lifted and showed a glimpse
of grace, and in a little the man had some assurance of salvation. He became a
pillar of Christ's kirk, prompt to check abominations, notably the sin of
witchcraft; foremost in good works, but with it all a humble man who walked
contritely till his death. When I came first to Caulds I sought to prevail upon
him to accept the eldership, but he aye put me by, and when I heard his tale I
saw that he had done wisely. I mind him well as he sat in his chair or
daundered through Caulds, a kind word for every one and sage counsel in time of
distress, but withal a severe man to himself and a crucifier of the body. It
seems that this severity weakened his frame, for three years syne come
Martinmas he was taken ill with a fever of the bowels, and after a week's
sickness he went to his account, where I trust he is accepted.</p>

<h2><a name="story5" id="story5">5. FOUNTAINBLUE</a></h2>
<h3>First published in <i>Blackwood's Magazine</i>, August 1901</h3>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>ONCE upon a time, as the story-books say, a boy came over a ridge of hill,
from which a shallow vale ran out into the sunset. It was a high, wind- blown
country, where the pines had a crook in their backs and the rocks were scarred
and bitten with winter storms. But below was the beginning of pastoral. Soft
birch-woods, shady beeches, meadows where cattle had browsed for generations,
fringed the little brown river as it twined to the sea. Farther, and the waves
broke on white sands, the wonderful billows of the West which cannot bear to be
silent. And between, in a garden wilderness, with the evening flaming in its
windows, stood Fountainblue, my little four-square castle which guards the
valley and the beaches.</p>
<p>The boy had torn his clothes, scratched his face, cut one finger deeply, and
soaked himself with bog-water, but he whistled cheerfully and his eyes were
happy. He had had an afternoon of adventure, startling emprises achieved in
solitude; assuredly a day to remember and mark with a white stone. And the
beginning had been most unpromising. After lunch he had been attired in his
best raiment, and, in the misery of a broad white collar, despatched with his
cousins to take tea with the small lady who domineered in Fountainblue. The
prospect had pleased him greatly, the gardens fed his fancy, the hostess was an
old confederate, and there were sure to be excellent things to eat. But his
curious temper had arisen to torment him. On the way he quarrelled with his
party, and in a moment found himself out of sympathy with the future. The
enjoyment crept out of the prospect. He knew that he did not shine in society,
he foresaw an afternoon when he would be left out in the cold and his hilarious
cousins treated as the favoured guests. He reflected that tea was a short meal
at the best, and that games on a lawn were a poor form of sport. Above all, he
felt the torture of his collar and the straitness of his clothes. He pictured
the dreary return in the twilight, when the afternoon, which had proved, after
all, such a dismal failure, had come to a weary end. So, being a person of
impulses, he mutinied at the gates of Fountainblue and made for the hills. He
knew he should get into trouble, but trouble, he had long ago found out, was
his destiny, and he scorned to avoid it. And now, having cast off the fear of
God and man, he would for some short hours do exactly as he pleased.</p>
<p>Half crying with regret for the delights he had forsworn, he ran over the
moor to the craggy hills which had always been forbidden him. "When he had
climbed among the rocks awe fell upon the desolate little adventurer, and he
bewailed his choice. But soon he found a blue hawk's nest, and the possession
of a coveted egg inspired him to advance. By-and-by he had climbed so high that
he could not return, but must needs scale Stob Ghabhar itself. With a quaking
heart he achieved it, and then, in the pride of his heroism, he must venture
down the Grey Correi where the wild goats lived. He saw a bearded ruffian, and
pursued him with stones, stalking him cunningly till he was out of breath. Then
he found odd little spleenwort ferns, which he pocketed, and high up in the
rocks a friendly raven croaked his encouragement. And then, when the shadows
lengthened, he set off cheerily homewards, hungry, triumphant, and very
weary.</p>
<p>All the way home he flattered his soul. In one afternoon he had been hunter
and trapper, and what to him were girls' games and pleasant things to eat? He
pictured himself the hardy outlaw, feeding on oatmeal and goat's-flesh, the
terror and pride of his neighbourhood. Could the little mistress of
Fountainblue but see him now, how she would despise his prosaic cousins! And
then, as he descended on the highway, he fell in with his forsaken party.</p>
<p>For a wonder they were in good spirits so good that they forgot to remind
him, in their usual way, of the domestic terrors awaiting him. A man had been
there who had told them stories and shown them tricks, and there had been
coconut cake, and Sylvia had a new pony on which they had ridden races. The
children were breathless with excitement, very much in love with each other as
common sharers in past joys. And as they talked all the colour went out of his
afternoon. The blue hawk's egg was cracked, and it looked a stupid, dingy
object as it lay in his cap. His rare ferns were crumpled and withered, and who
was to believe his stories of Stob Ghabhar and the Grey Correi? He had been a
fool to barter ponies and tea and a man who knew tricks for the barren glories
of following his own fancy. But at any rate he would show no sign. If he was to
be an outlaw, he would carry his outlawry well; so with a catch in his voice
and tears in his eyes he jeered at his inattentive companions, upbraiding
himself all the while for his folly.</p>
<br>
<h3>II</h3>
<p>The sun was dipping behind Stob Ghabhar when Maitland drove over the ridge
of hill, whence the moor-road dips to</p>
<p>Fountainblue. Twenty long miles from the last outpost of railway to the
western sea-loch, and twenty of the barest, steepest miles in the bleak north.
And all the way he had been puzzling himself with the half-painful, half-
pleasing memories of a childhood which to the lonely man still overtopped the
present. Every wayside bush was the home of recollection. In every burn he had
paddled and fished; here he had found the jack-snipe's nest, there he had
hidden when the shepherds sought him for burning the heather in May. He lost
for a little the burden of his years and cares, and lived again in that old
fresh world which had no boundaries, where sleep and food were all his thought
at night, and adventure the sole outlook of the morning. The western sea lay
like a thin line of gold beyond the moorland, and down in the valley in a bower
of trees lights began to twinkle from the little castle. The remote mountains,
hiding deep corries and woods in their bosom, were blurred by twilight to a
single wall of hazy purple, which shut off this fairy glen impenetrably from
the world. Fountainblue the name rang witchingly in his ears. Fountainblue, the
last home of the Good Folk, the last hold of the vanished kings, where the last
wolf in Scotland was slain, and, as stories go, the last saint of the Great
Ages taught the people, what had Fountainblue to do with his hard world of
facts and figures? The thought woke him to a sense of the present, and for a
little he relished the paradox. He had left it long ago, an adventurous child;
now he was returning with success behind him and a portion of life's good
things his own. He was rich, very rich and famous. Few men of forty had his
power, and he had won it all in fair struggle with enemies and rivals and a
niggardly world. E[e had been feared and hated, as he had been extravagantly
admired; he had been rudely buffeted by fortune, and had met the blows with a
fighter's joy. And out of it all something hard and austere had shaped itself,
something very much a man, but a man with little heart and a lack of kindly
human failings. He was master of himself in a curious degree, but the mastery
absorbed his interests. Nor had he ever regretted it, when suddenly in this
outlandish place the past swept over him, and he had a vision of a long avenue
of vanished hopes. It pleased and disquieted him, and as the road dipped into
the valley he remembered the prime cause of this mood of vagaries.</p>
<p>He had come up into the north with one purpose in view, he frankly told
himself. The Etheridges were in Fountainblue, and ever since, eight months
before, he had met Clara Etheridge, he had forgotten his ambitions. A casual
neighbour at a dinner-party, a chance partner at a ball, and then he had to
confess that this slim, dark, bright-* eyed girl had broken in irrevocably upon
his contentment. At first he hated it for a weakness, then he welcomed the
weakness with feverish ecstasy. He did nothing by halves, so he sought her
company eagerly, and, being a great man&mdash;in his way, found things made
easy for him. But the girl remained shy and distant, flattered doubtless by his
attention, but watching him curiously as an intruder from an alien world. It
was characteristic of the man that he never thought of a rival. His whole aim
was to win her love; for rivalry with other men he had the contempt of a
habitual conqueror. And so the uneasy wooing went 'on till the Etheridges left
town, and he found himself a fortnight later with his work done and a visit
before him to which he looked forward with all the vehemence of a nature whose
strong point had always been its hope. As the road wound among the fir-trees,
he tried to forecast the life at Fountainblue, and map out the future in his
usual business-like way. But now the future refused to be thus shorn and
parcelled: there was an unknown quantity in it which defied his efforts.</p>
<p>The house-party were sitting round the hall-fire when he entered. The
high-roofed place, the flagged floor strewn with rugs, and its walls bright
with the glow of fire on armour, gave him a boyish sense of comfort. Two men in
knickerbockers were lounging on a settle, and at his entrance came forward to
greet him. One was Sir Hugh Clanroyden, a follower of his own; the other he
recognised as a lawyer named Durward. From the circle of women Miss Etheridge
rose and welcomed him. Her mother was out, but would be back for dinner;
meantime he should be shown his room. He noticed that her face was browner, her
hair a little less neat, and there seemed something franker and kindlier in her
smile. So in a very good humour he went to rid himself of the dust of the
roads.</p>
<p>Durward watched him curiously, and then turned, laughing, to his companion,
as the girl came back to her friends with a heightened colour in her
cheeks.</p>
<p>"Romeo the second," he said. "We are going to be spectators of a comedy. And
yet, heaven knows! Maitland is not cast for comedy."</p>
<p>The other shook his head. "It will never come off. I've known Clara
Etheridge most of my life, and I would as soon think of marrying a dancing-girl
to a bishop. She is a delightful person, and my very good friend, but how on
earth is she ever to understand Maitland? And how on earth can he see anything
in her? Besides, there's another man."</p>
<p>Durward laughed. "Despencer! I suppose he will be a serious rival with a
woman; but imagine him Maitland's rival in anything else! He'd break him like a
rotten stick in half an hour. I like little Despencer, and I don't care about
Maitland; but all the same it is absurd to compare the two, except in love-
making."</p>
<p>"Lord, it will be comic," and Clanroyden stretched his long legs and lay
back on a cushion. The girls were still chattering beside the fire, and the
twilight was fast darkening into evening.</p>
<p>"You dislike Maitland?" he asked, looking up. "Now, I wonder why?"</p>
<p>Durward smiled comically at the ceiling. "Oh, I know I oughtn't to. I know
he's supposed to be a man's man, and that it's bad form for a man to say he
dislikes him. But I'm honest enough to own to detesting him. I suppose he's
great, but he's not great enough yet to compel one to fall down and worship
him, and I hate greatness in the making. He goes through the world with his
infernal arrogance and expects everybody to clear out of his way. I am told we
live in an age of reason, but that fellow has burked reason. He never gives a
reason for a thing he does, and if you try to argue he crushes you. He has
killed good talk for ever with his confounded rudeness. All the little
sophistries and conventions which make life tolerable are so much rubbish to
him, and he shows it. The plague of him is that he can never make believe. He
is as hard as iron, and as fierce as the devil, and about as unpleasant. You
may respect the sledge-hammer type, but it's confoundedly dull. Why, the man
has not the imagination of a rabbit, except in his description of people he
dislikes. I liked him when he said that Layden reminded him of a dissipated
dove, because I disliked Layden; but when Freddy Alton played the fool and
people forgave him, because he was a good sort, Maitland sent him about his
business, saying he had no further use for weaklings. He is so abominably cold-
blooded and implacable that every one must fear him, and yet most people can
afford to despise him. All the kind simple things of life are shut out of his
knowledge. He has no nature, only a heart of stone and an iron will and a
terribly subtle brain. Of course he is a great man in a way, but at the best he
is only half a man. And to think that he should have fallen in love, and be in
danger of losing to Despencer! It's enough to make one forgive him."</p>
<p>Clanroyden laughed. "I can't think of Despencer. It's too absurd. But,
seriously, I wish I saw Maitland well rid of this mood, married or cured. That
sort of man doesn't take things easily."</p>
<p>"It reminds one of Theocritus and the Cyclops in love. Who would have
thought to see him up in this moorland place, running after a girl? He doesn't
care for sport."</p>
<p>"Do you know that he spent most of his childhood in this glen, and that he
is keen about sport? He is too busy for many holidays, but he once went with
Burton to the Caucasus, and Burton said the experience nearly killed him. He
said that the fellow was tireless, and as mad and reckless as a boy with
nothing to lose."</p>
<p>"Well, that simply bears out what I say of him. He does not understand the
meaning of sport. When he gets keen about anything he pursues it as carefully
and relentlessly as if it were something on the Stock Exchange. Now little
Despencer is a genuine sportsman in his canary-like way.</p>
<p>He loves the art of the thing and the being out of doors. Maitland, I don't
suppose, ever thinks whether it is a ceiling or the sky above his august head.
Despencer&mdash;"</p>
<p>But at the moment Clanroyden uncrossed his legs, bringing his right foot
down heavily upon his companion's left. Durward looked up and saw a young man
coming towards him, smiling.</p>
<p>The newcomer turned aside to say something to the girls round the fire, and
then came and sat on an arm of the settle. He was a straight, elegant person,
with a well-tanned, regular face, and very pleasant brown eyes.</p>
<p>"I've had such an afternoon," he said. "You never saw a place like
Cairnlora. It's quite a little stone tower all alone in a fir-wood, and nothing
else between the moor and the sea. It is furnished as barely as a prison,
except for the chairs, which are priceless old Dutch things. Oh, and the silver
at tea was the sort of thing that only South Africans can buy nowadays. Mrs
Etheridge is devoured with envy. But the wonder of the house is old Miss
Elphinstone. She must be nearly seventy and she looks forty-five, except for
her hair. She speaks broad Scots, and she has the manners of a <i>marquise</i>.
I would give a lot to have had Raeburn paint her. She reminded me of nothing so
much as a hill-wind with her keen high-coloured old face. Yes, I have enjoyed
the afternoon."</p>
<p>"Jack has got a new enthusiasm," said Durward. "I wish I were like you to
have a new one once a week. By the way, Maitland has arrived at last."</p>
<p>"Really!" said Despencer. "Oh, I forgot to tell you something which you
would never have guessed. Miss Elphinstone is Maitland's aunt, and he was
brought up a good deal at Cairnlora. He doesn't take his manners from her, but
I suppose he gets his cleverness from that side of the family. She disapproves
of him strongly, so of course I had to defend him. And what do you think she
said? 'He has betrayed his tradition. He has sold his birthright for a mess of
pottage, and I wish him joy of his bargain!' Nice one for your party,
Hugh."</p>
<p>Miss Etheridge had left the group at the fire and was standing at
Despencer's side. She listened to him with a curious air of solicitude, like an
affectionate sister. At the mention of Maitland's name Clanroyden had watched
her narrowly, but her face did not change. And when Despencer asked, "Where is
the new arrival?" she talked of him with the utmost nonchalance.</p>
<p>Maitland came down to dinner, ravenously hungry and in high spirits. Nothing
was changed in this house since he had stared at the pictures and imagined
terrible things about the armour and broken teacups with childish impartiality.
His own favourite seat was still there, where, hidden by a tapestry screen, he
had quarreled with Sylvia while their elders gossiped. This sudden flood of
memories mellowed him towards the world. He was cordial to Despencer, forebore
to think Durward a fool, and answered every one of Mr Etheridge's many
questions. For the first time he felt the success of his life. The old house
recalled his childhood, and the sight of Clanroyden, his devoted follower,
reminded him of his power. Somehow the weariful crying for the moon, which had
always tortured him, was exchanged for a glow of comfort, a shade of
complacency in his haggard soul... And then the sight of Clara dispelled his
satisfaction. Here in this cheerful homely party of friends he found himself
out of place. On state occasions he could acquit himself with credit, for the
man had a mind. He could make the world listen to him when he chose, and the
choice was habitual. But now his loneliness claimed its lawful consequences,
and he longed for the little friendly graces which he had so often despised.
Despencer talked of scenery and weather with a tenderness to which this man,
who loved nature as he loved little else, was an utter stranger. This elegant
and appropriate sentiment would have worried him past endurance, if Miss Clara
had not shared it. It was she who told some folk-tale about the Grey Correi
with the prettiest hesitancy which showed her feeling. And then the talk
drifted to books and people, flitting airily about their petty world. Maitland
felt himself choked by their accomplishments. Most of the subjects were ones no
sane man would trouble to think of, and yet here were men talking keenly about
trifles and disputing with nimble-witted cleverness on the niceties of the
trivial. Feeling miserably that he was the only silent one, he plunged
desperately into the stream, found himself pulled up by Despencer and deftly
turned. The event gave him the feeling of having been foiled by a kitten.</p>
<p>Angry with the world, angrier with his own angularity, he waited for the end
of the meal. Times had not changed in this house since he had been saved by
Sylvia from social disgrace. But when the women left the room he found life
easier. His host talked of sport, and he could tell him more about Stob Ghabhar
than any keeper. Despencer, victorious at dinner, now listened like a docile
pupil. Durward asked a political question, and the answer came sharp and
definite. Despencer demurred gently, after his fashion.</p>
<p>"Well, but surely"&mdash;and a grimly smiling "What do you know about it?"
closed the discussion. The old Maitland had returned for the moment.</p>
<p>The night was mild and impenetrably dark, and the fall of waters close at
hand sounded like a remote echo. An open hall-door showed that some of the
party had gone out to the garden, and the men followed at random. A glimmer of
white frocks betrayed the women on the lawn, standing by the little river which
slipped by cascade and glide from the glen to the low pasture-lands. In the
featureless dark there was no clue to locality. The place might have been
Berkshire or a suburban garden.</p>
<p>Suddenly the scream of some animal came from the near thicket. The women
started and asked what it was.</p>
<p>"It was a hill-fox," said Maitland to Clara. "They used to keep me awake at
nights on the hill. They come and bark close to your ear and give you
nightmare."</p>
<p>The lady shivered. "Thank Heaven for the indoors," she said. "Now, if I had
been the daughter of one of your old Donalds of the Isles, I should have known
that cry only too well. Wild nature is an excellent background, but give me
civilisation in front."</p>
<p>Maitland was looking into the wood. "You will find it creep far into
civilisation if you look for it. There is a very narrow line between the warm
room and the savage out-of-doors."</p>
<p>"There are miles of luxuries," the girl cried, laughing. "People who are
born in the wrong century have to hunt over half the world before they find
their savagery. It is all very tame, but I love the tameness. You may call
yourself primitive, Mr Maitland, but you are the most complex and modern of us
all. What would Donald of the Isles have said to politics and the Stock
Exchange?"</p>
<p>They had strolled back to the house. "Nevertheless I maintain my belief,"
said the man. "You call it miles of rampart; I call the division a line, a
thread, a sheet of glass. But then, you see, you only know one side, and I only
know the other."</p>
<p>"What preposterous affectation!" the girl said, as with a pretty shiver she
ran indoors. Maitland stood for a moment looking back at the darkness. Within
the firelit hall, with its rugs and little tables and soft chairs, he had
caught a glimpse of Despencer smoking a cigarette. As he looked towards the
hills he heard the fox's bark a second time, and then somewhere from the black
distance came a hawk's scream, hoarse, lonely, and pitiless. The thought struck
him that the sad elemental world of wood and mountain was far more truly his
own than this cosy and elegant civilisation. And, oddly enough, the thought
pained him.</p>
<br>
<h3>III</h3>
<p>The day following was wet and windy, when a fire was grateful, and the
hills, shrouded in grey mist, had no attractions. The party read idly in arm-
chairs during the morning, and in the afternoon Maitland and Clanroyden went
down to the stream-mouth after sea-trout. So Despencer remained to talk to
Clara, and, having played many games of picquet and grown heartily tired of
each other, as tea-time approached they fell to desultory comments on their
friends. Maitland was beginning to interest the girl in a new way. Formerly he
had been a great person who was sensible enough to admire her, but something
remote and unattractive, for whom friendship (much less love) was impossible.
But now she had begun to feel his power, his manhood. The way in which other
men spoke of him impressed her unconsciously, and she began to ask Despencer
questions which were gall and wormwood to that young man. But he answered
honestly, after his fashion.</p>
<p>"Isn't he very rich?" she asked. "And I suppose he lives very plainly?"</p>
<p>"Rich as Croesus, and he sticks in his ugly rooms in the Albany because he
never thinks enough about the thing to change. I've been in them once, and you
never saw such a place. He's a maniac for fresh air, so they're large enough,
but they're littered like a stable with odds and ends of belongings. He must
have several thousand books, and yet he hasn't a decent binding among them. He
hasn't a photograph of a single soul, and only one picture, which, I believe,
was his father. But you never saw such a collection of whips and spurs and
bits. It smells like a harness room, and there you find Maitland, when by any
chance he is at home, working half the night and up to the eyes in papers. I
don't think the man has any expenses except food and rent, for he wears the
same clothes for years. And he has given up horses."</p>
<p>"Was he fond of horses?" Miss Clara asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, you had better ask him. I really can't tell you any more about
him."</p>
<p>"But how do his friends get on with him?"</p>
<p>"He has hardly any, but his acquaintances, who are all the world, say he is
the one great man of the future. If you want to read what people think of him,
you had better look at the <i>Monthly</i>."</p>
<p>Under cover of this one ungenerous word Despencer made his escape, for he
hated the business, but made it the rule of his life "never to crab a fellow."
Miss Clara promptly sought out the <i>Monthly</i>, and found twenty pages of
superfine analysis and bitter, grudging praise. She read it with interest, and
then lay back in her chair and tried to fix her thoughts. It is only your
unhealthy young woman who worships strength in the abstract, and the girl tried
to determine whether she admired the man as a power or disliked him as a brute.
She chose a compromise, and the feeling which survived was chiefly
curiosity.</p>
<p>The result of the afternoon was that when the fishermen returned, and
Maitland, in dry clothes, appeared for tea, she settled herself beside him and
prepared to talk. Maitland, being healthily tired, was in an excellent temper,
and he found himself enticed into what for him was a rare performance, talk
about himself. They were sitting apart from the others, and, ere ever he knew,
he was answering the girl's questions with an absent-minded frankness. In a
little she had drawn from him the curious history of his life, which most men
knew, but never from his own lips.</p>
<p>"I was at school for a year," he said, "and then my father died and our
affairs went to pieces. I had to come back and go into an office, a sort of
bank. I hated it, but it was good for me, for it taught me something, and my
discontent made me ambitious. I had about eighty pounds a year, and I saved
from that. I worked too at books incessantly, and by-and-by I got an Oxford
scholarship at an obscure college. I went up there, and found myself in a place
where every one seemed well-off, while I was a pauper. However, it didn't
trouble me much, for I had no ambition to play the fool. I only cared about two
things horses and metaphysics. I hated all games, which I thought only fit for
children. I daresay it was foolish, but then you see I had had a queer
upbringing. I managed to save a little money, and one vacation when I was
wandering about in Norfolk, sleeping under haystacks and working in harvest
fields when my supplies ran down, I came across a farmer. He was a good fellow
and a sort of sportsman, and I took a fancy to him. He had a colt to sell which
I fancied more, for I saw it had blood in it. So I bought it for what seemed a
huge sum to me in those days, but I kept it at his farm and I superintended its
education. I broke it myself and taught it to jump, and by-and-by in my third
year I brought it to Oxford and entered for the Grind on it. People laughed at
me, but I knew my own business. The little boys who rode in the thing knew
nothing about horses, and not one in ten could ride; so I entered and won. It
was all I wanted, for I could sell my horse then, and the fellow who rode
second bought it. It was decent of him, for I asked a big figure, and I think
he had an idea of doing me a kindness. I made him my private secretary the
other day."</p>
<p>"You mean Lord Drapier?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes&mdash;Drapier. That gave me money to finish off and begin in town. Oh,
and I had got a first in my schools. I knew very little about anything except
metaphysics, and I never went to tutors. I suppose I knew a good deal more than
the examiners in my own subject, and anyhow they felt obliged to give me my
first after some grumbling. Then I came up to town with just sixty pounds in my
pocket, but I had had the education of a gentleman."</p>
<p>Maitland looked out of the window, and the sight of the mist-clad hills
recalled him to himself. He wondered why he was telling the girl this story,
and he stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>"And what did you do in town?" she asked, with interest.</p>
<p>"I hung round and kept my eyes open. I nearly starved, for I put half my
capital on a horse which I thought was safe, and lost it. By-and-by, quite by
accident, I came across a curious fellow&mdash;Ransome; you probably have heard
his name. I met him in some stables where he was buying a mare, and he took a
fancy to me. He made me his secretary, and then, because I liked hard work, he
let me see his business. It was enormous, for the man was a genius after a
fashion; and I slaved away in his office and down at the docks for about three
years. He paid me just enough to keep body and soul together and cover them
with clothes; but I didn't grumble, for I had a sort of idea that I was on my
probation. And then my apprenticeship came to an end."</p>
<p>"Yes," said the girl.</p>
<p>"Yes; for you see Ransome was an odd character. He had a sort of genius for
finance, and within his limits he was even a great administrator. But in
everything else he was as simple as a child. His soul was idyllic: he loved
green fields and Herrick and sheep. So it had always been his fancy to back out
some day and retire with his huge fortune to some country place and live as he
pleased. It seemed that he had been training me from the first day I went into
the business, and now he cut the rope and left the whole enormous concern in my
hands. I needed every atom of my wits, and the first years were a hard
struggle. I became of course very rich; but I had to do more, I had to keep the
thing at its old level. I had no natural turn for the work, and I had to
acquire capacity by sheer grind. However, I managed it, and then, when I felt
my position sure, I indulged myself with a hobby and went into politics."</p>
<p>"You call it a hobby?"</p>
<p>"Certainly. The ordinary political career is simply a form of trifling.
There's no trade on earth where a man has to fear so few able competitors. Of
course it's very public and honourable and that sort of thing, and I like it;
but sometimes it wearies me to death."</p>
<p>The girl was looking at him with curious interest. "Do you always get what
you want?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Never," he said.</p>
<p>"Then is your success all disappointment?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I generally get a bit of my ambitions, which is all one can hope for in
this world."</p>
<p>"I suppose your ambitions are not idyllic, like Mr Ransome's?"</p>
<p>He laughed. "No, I suppose not. I never could stand your Corot meadows and
ivied cottages and village church bells. But I am at home in this glen, or used
to be."</p>
<p>"You said that last night, and I thought it was affectation," said the girl;
"but perhaps you are right. I'm not at home in this scenery, at any rate in
this weather. Ugh, look at that mist driving and that spur of Stob Ghabhar! I
really must go and sit by the fire."</p>
<br>
<h3>IV</h3>
<p>The next day dawned clear and chill, with a little frost to whiten the
heather; but by mid-day the sun had turned August to June, and sea and land
drowsed in a mellow heat. Maitland was roused from his meditations with a pipe
on a garden-seat by the appearance of Miss Clara, her eyes bright with news. He
had taken her in to dinner the night before, and for the first time in his life
had found himself talking easily to a woman. Her interest of the afternoon had
not departed; and Despencer in futile disgust shunned the drawing-room, his
particular paradise, and played billiards with Clanroyden in the spirit of an
unwilling martyr.</p>
<p>"We are going out in the yacht," Miss Clara cried, as she emerged from the
shadow of a fuchsia-hedge, "to the Isles of the Waves, away beyond the Seal's
Headland. Do you know the place, Mr Maitland?"</p>
<p>"Eilean na Cille? Yes. It used to be dangerous for currents, but a steam-
yacht does not require to fear them."</p>
<p>"Well, we'll be ready to start at twelve, and I must go in to give orders
about lunch."</p>
<p>A little later she came out with a bundle of letters in her hands. "Here are
your letters, Mr Maitland; but you mustn't try to answer them, or you'll be
late." He put the lot in his jacket pocket and looked up at the laughing girl.
"My work is six hundred miles behind me," he said, "and to-day I have only the
Eilean na Cille to think of&mdash;"</p>
<p>And, as she passed by, another name took the place of the Eilean, and it
seemed to him that at last he had found the link which was to bind together the
two natures his boyhood and his prime.</p>
<p>Out on the loch the sun was beating with that steady August blaze which is
more torrid than midsummer. But as the yacht slipped between the horns of the
land, it came into a broken green sea with rollers to the north where the
tireless Atlantic fretted on the reefs. In a world of cool salt winds and the
golden weather of afternoon, with the cries of tern and gull about the bows and
the foam and ripple of green water in the wake, the party fell into a mood of
supreme contentment. The restless Miss Clara was stricken into a figure of
contemplation, which sat in the bows and watched the hazy blue horizon and the
craggy mainland hills in silent delight. Maitland was revelling in the loss of
his isolation. He had ceased to be alone, a leader, and for the moment felt
himself one of the herd, a devotee of humble pleasures. His mind was blank, his
eyes filled only with the sea, and the lady of his devotion, in that happy
moment of romance, seemed to have come at last within the compass of his
hopes.</p>
<p>The Islands of the Waves are low green ridges which rise little above the
highest tide-mark. The grass is stiff with salt, the sparse heather and rushes
are crooked with the winds, but there are innumerable little dells where a
light wild scrub flourishes, and in one a spring of sweet water sends a tiny
stream to the sea. The yacht's company came ashore in boats, and tea was made
with a great bustle beside the well, while the men lay idly in the bent and
smoked. All wind seemed to have died down, a soft, cool, airless peace like a
June evening was abroad, and the heavy surging of the tides had sunk to a
distant whisper. Maitland lifted his head, sniffed the air, and looked uneasily
to the west, meeting the eye of one of the sailors engaged in the same
scrutiny. He beckoned the man to him.</p>
<p>"What do you make of the weather?" he asked.</p>
<p>The sailor, an East-coast man from Arbroath, shook his head. "It's ower lown
a' of a sudden," he said. "It looks like mair wind nor we want, but I think
it'll haud till the morn."</p>
<p>Maitland nodded and lay down again. He smiled at the return of his old sea
craft and weather-lore, on which he had prided himself in his boyhood; and when
Miss Clara came up to him with tea she found him grinning vacantly at the
sky.</p>
<p>"What a wonderful lull in the wind," she said. "When I was here last these
were real isles of the waves, with spray flying over them and a great business
to land. But now they might be the island in Fountainblue lake."</p>
<p>"Did you ever hear of the <i>Ocean Quiet</i>?" he asked. "I believe it to be
a translation of a Gaelic word which is a synonym for death, but it is also a
kind of natural phenomenon. Old people at Cairnlora used to talk of it. They
said that sometimes fishermen far out at sea in blowing weather came into a
place of extraordinary peace, where the whole world was utterly still and they
could hear their own hearts beating."</p>
<p>"What a pretty fancy!" said the girl.</p>
<p>"Yes; but it had its other side. The fishermen rarely came home alive, and
if they did they were queer to the end of their days. Another name for the
thing was the Breathing of God. It is an odd idea, the passing from the
wholesome turmoil of nature to the uncanny place where God crushes you by His
silence."</p>
<p>"All the things to eat are down by the fire," she said, laughing. "Do you
know, if you weren't what you are, people might think you a poet, Mr Maitland.
I thought you cared for none of these things."</p>
<p>"What things?" he asked. "I don't care for poetry. I am merely repeating the
nonsense I was brought up on. Shall I talk to you about politics?"</p>
<p>"Heaven forbid! And now I will tell you my own story about these isles.
There is a hermit's cell on one of them and crosses, like Iona. The hermit
lived alone all winter, and was fed by boats from the shore when the weather
was calm. When one hermit died another took his place, and no one knew where he
came from. Now one day a great lord in Scotland disappeared from his castle. He
was the King's Warden of the Marches and the greatest soldier of his day, but
he disappeared utterly out of men's sight, and people forgot about him. Long
years after the Northmen in a great fleet came down upon these isles, and the
little chiefs fled before them. But suddenly among them there appeared an old
man, the hermit of the Wave Islands, who organised resistance and gathered a
strong army. No one dared oppose him, and the quarrelsome petty chiefs forgot
their quarrels under his banner, for he had the air of one born to command. At
last he met the invaders in the valley of Fountainblue, and beat them so
utterly that few escaped to their ships. He fell himself in the first charge,
but not before his followers had heard his battle-cry of 'Saint Bride,' and
known that the Hermit of the Isles and the great King's Warden were the
same."</p>
<p>"That was a common enough thing in wild times. Men grew tired of murder and
glory and waving banners, and wanted quiet to make their peace with their own
souls. I should have thought the craving scarcely extinct yet."</p>
<p>"Then here is your chance, Mr Maitland," said the girl, laughing. "A little
trouble would make the hut habitable, and you could simply disappear, leaving
no address to forward your letters to. Think of the sensation, 'Disappearance
of a Secretary of State,' and the wild theories and the obituaries. Then some
day when the land question became urgent on the mainland, you would turn up
suddenly, settle it with extraordinary wisdom, and die after confiding your
life-story to some country reporter. But I am afraid it would scarcely do, for
you would be discovered by Scotland Yard, which would be ignominious."</p>
<p>"It is a sound idea, but the old device is too crude. However, it could be
managed differently. Some day, when civilisation grows oppressive, Miss Clara,
I will remember your advice."</p>
<p>The afternoon shadows were beginning to lengthen, and from the west a light
sharp wind was crisping the sea. The yacht was getting up steam, and boats were
coming ashore for the party. The deep blue waters were flushing rose- pink as
the level westering sun smote them from the summit of a cloud-bank. The
stillness had gone, and the air was now full of sounds and colour. Miss Clara,
with an eye on the trim yacht, declared her disapproval. "It is an evening for
the cutter," she cried, and in spite of Mrs Etheridge's protests she gave
orders for it to be made ready. Then the self-willed young woman looked round
for company. "Will you come, Mr Maitland?" she said. "You can sail a boat,
can't you? And Mr Despencer, I shall want you to talk to me when Mr Maitland is
busy. We shall race the yacht, for we ought to be able to get through the S
cart's Neck with this wind."</p>
<p>"I am not sure if you are wise, Miss Clara," and Maitland pulled down his
brows as he looked to the west. "It will be wind in a very little, and you
stand the chance of a wetting."</p>
<p>"I don't mind. I want to get the full good of such an evening. You want to
be near the water to understand one of our sunsets. I can be a barbarian too,
you know."</p>
<p>It was not for Maitland to grumble at this friendliness; so he followed her
into the cutter with Despencer, who had no love for the orders but much for her
who gave them. He took the helm and steered, with directions from the lady,
from his memory of the intricate coast. Despencer with many rugs looked to Miss
Clara's comfort, and, having assured his own, was instantly entranced with the
glories of the evening.</p>
<p>The boat tripped along for a little in a dazzle of light into the silvery
grey of the open water. Far in front lay the narrow gut called the Scart's
Neck, which was the by-way to the loch of Fountainblue. Then Maitland at the
helm felt the sheets suddenly begin to strain, and, looking behind, saw that
the Isles of the Waves were almost lost in the gloom, and that the roseate
heavens were quickly darkening behind. The wind which he had feared was upon
them; a few seconds more and it was sending the cutter staggering among
billows. He could hardly make himself heard in the din, as he roared directions
to Despencer about disposing of his person in another part of the boat.</p>
<p>The girl with flushed face was laughing in pure joy of the storm. She caught
a glimpse of Maitland's serious eye and looked over the gunwale at the
threatening west. Then she too became quiet, and meekly sat down on the thwart
to which he motioned her.</p>
<p>The gale made the Scart's Neck impossible, and the murky sky seemed to
promise greater fury ere the morning. Twilight was falling, and the other
entrance to the quiet loch meant the rounding of a headland and a difficult
course through a little archipelago. It was the only way, for return was out of
the question, and it seemed vain to risk the narrow chances of the short cut.
Maitland looked down at his two companions, and reflected with pleasure that he
was the controller of their fates. He had sailed much as a boy, and he found in
this moment of necessity that his old lore returned to him. He felt no mistrust
of his powers: whatever the gale he could land them at Fountainblue, though it
might take hours and involve much discomfort. He remembered the coast like his
own name; he relished the grim rage of the elements, and he kept the cutter's
head out to sea with a delight in the primeval conflict.</p>
<p>The last flickering rays of light, coming from the screen of cloud,
illumined the girl's pale face, and the sight disquieted him. There was a hint
of tragedy in this game. Despencer, nervously self-controlled, was reassuring
Clara. Ploughing onward in the blackening night in a frail boat on a wind-
threshed sea was no work for a girl. But it was Despencer who was comforting
her! Well, it was his proper work. He was made for the business of talking soft
things to women. Maitland, his face hard with spray, looked into the darkness
with a kind of humour in his heart. And then, as the boat shore and dipped into
the storm, its human occupants seemed to pass out of the picture, and it was
only a shell tossed on great waters in the unfathomable night. The evening had
come, moonless and starless, and Maitland steered as best he could by the
deeper blackness which was the configuration of the shore. Something loomed up
that he knew for the headland, and they were drifting in a quieter stretch of
sea, with the breakers grumbling ahead from the little tangle of islands.</p>
<p>Suddenly he fell into one of the abstractions which had always dogged him
through his strenuous life. His mind was clear, he chose his course with a
certain precision, but the winds and waves had become to him echoes of echoes.
Wet with spray and shifting his body constantly with the movement of the boat,
it yet was all a phantasmal existence, while his thoughts were following an
airy morrice in a fairyland world. The motto of his house, the canting motto of
old reivers, danced in his brain&mdash;"<i>Parmi ceu haut bois conduyrai
m'amie</i>"&mdash;"Through the high wood I will conduct my love"&mdash;and in a
land of green forests, dragon-haunted, he was piloting Clara, robed in a quaint
medieval gown, himself in speckless plate-armour. His fancy fled through a
score of scenes, sometimes on a dark heath, or by a lonely river, or among
great mountains, but always the lady and her protector. Clara, looking up from
Despencer's side, saw his lips moving, noted that his eyes were glad, and for a
moment hoped better things of their chances.</p>
<p>Then suddenly she was numb with alarm, for the cutter heeled over, and but
that Maitland woke to clear consciousness and swung the sheet loose, all would
have been past. The adventure nerved him and quickened his senses. The boat
seemed to move more violently than the wind drove her, and in the utter
blackness he felt for the first time the grip of the waters. The ugly cruel
monster had wakened, and was about to wreak its anger on the toy. And then he
remembered the currents which raced round Eilean Righ and the scattered isles.
Dim shapes loomed up, shapes strange and unfriendly, and he felt miserably that
he was as helpless now as Despencer. To the left night had wholly shut out the
coast; his one chance was to run for one of the isles and risk a landing. It
would be a dreary waiting for the dawn, but safety had come before any comfort.
And yet, he remembered, the little islands were rock-bound and unfriendly, and
he was hurrying forward in the grip of a black current with a gale behind and
unknown reefs before.</p>
<p>And then he seemed to remember something of this current which swept along
the isles. In a little&mdash;so he recalled a boyish voyage in clear
weather&mdash;they would come to a place where the sea ran swift and dark
beside a kind of natural wharf. Here he had landed once upon a time, but it was
a difficult enterprise, needing a quick and a far leap at the proper moment,
for the stream ran very fast. But if this leap were missed there was still a
chance. The isle was the great Eilean Righ, and the current swung round its
southern end, and then, joining with another stream, turned up its far side,
and for a moment washed the shore. But if this second chance were missed, then
nothing remained but to fall into the great sea-going stream and be carried out
to death in the wide Atlantic. He strained his eyes to the right for Eilean
Righ. Something seemed to approach, as they bent under an access of the gale.
They bore down upon it, and he struggled to keep the boat's head away, for at
this pace to grate upon rock would mean upsetting. The sail was down,
fluttering amidships like a captive bird, and the gaunt mast bowed with the
wind. A horrible fascination, the inertia of nightmare, seized him. The motion
was so swift and beautiful; why not go on and onward, listlessly? And then,
conquering the weakness, he leaned forward and called to Clara. She caught his
arm like a child, and he pulled her up beside him. Then he beckoned Despencer,
and, shrieking against the din, told him to follow him when he jumped.</p>
<p>Despencer nodded, his teeth chattering with cold and the novel business.
Suddenly out of the darkness, a yard on their right, loomed a great flat rock
along which the current raced like a mill-lade. The boat made to strike, but
Maitland forced her nose out to sea, and then as the stern swung round he
seized his chance. Holding Clara with his left arm he stood up, balanced
himself for a moment on the gunwale, and jumped. He landed sprawling on his
side on some wet seaweed, over which the sea was lipping, but undeniably on
land. As he pulled himself up he had a vision of the cutter, dancing like a
cork, vanishing down the current into the darkness.</p>
<p>Holding the girl in his arms he picked his way across the rock pools to the
edge of the island heather. For a moment he thought Clara had fainted. She lay
still and inert, her eyes shut, her hair falling foolishly over her brow. He
sprinkled some water on her face, and she revived sufficiently to ask her
whereabouts. He was crossing the island to find Despencer, but he did not tell
her. "You are safe," he said, and he carried her over the rough ground as
lightly as a child. An intense exhilaration had seized him. He ran over the
flats and strode up the low hillocks with one thought possessing his brain. To
save Despencer, that of course was the far-off aim on his mind's horizon, but
all the foreground was filled with the lady. "<i>Parmi ceu haut bois</i>"
&mdash;the old poetry of the world had penetrated to his heart. The black night
and the wild wind and the sea were the ministrants of love. The hollow shams of
life with their mincing conventions had departed, and in this savage out-world
a man stood for a man. The girl's light tweed jacket was no match for this
chill gale, so he stopped for a moment, took off his own shooting-coat and put
it round her. And then, as he came over a little ridge, he was aware of a
grumbling of waters and the sea.</p>
<p>The beach was hidden in a veil of surf which sprinkled the very edge of the
bracken. Beyond, the dark waters were boiling like a cauldron, for the tides in
this little bay ran with the fury of a river in spate. A moon was beginning to
struggle through the windy clouds, and surf, rock, and wave began to shape
themselves out of the night. Clara stood on the sand, a slim, desolate figure,
and clung to Maitland's arm. She was still dazed with the storm and the
baffling suddenness of change. Maitland, straining his eyes out to sea, was in
a waking dream. With the lady no toil was too great, no darkness terrible; for
her he would scale the blue air and plough the hills and do all the lover's
feats of romance. And then suddenly he shook her hand roughly from his arm and
ran forward, for he saw something coming down the tide.</p>
<p>Before he left the boat he had lowered the sail, and the cutter swung to the
current, an odd amorphous thing, now heeling over with a sudden gust and now
pulled back to balance by the strong grip of the water. A figure seemed to sit
in the stern, making feeble efforts to steer. Maitland knew the coast and the
ways of the sea. He ran through the surf-ring into the oily-black eddies,
shouting to Despencer to come overboard. Soon he was not ten yards from the
cutter's line, where the current made a turn towards the shore before it washed
the iron rocks to the right. He found deep water, and in two strokes was in the
grip of the tides and borne wildly towards the reef. He prepared himself for
what was coming, raising his feet and turning his right shoulder to the front.
And then with a shock he was pinned against the rock-wall, with the tides
tugging at his legs, while his hands clung desperately to a shelf. Here he
remained, yelling directions to the coming boat. Surf was in his eyes, so that
at first he could not see, but at last in a dip of the waves he saw the cutter,
a man's form in the stern, plunging not twenty yards away. Now was his chance
or never, for while the tide would take a boat far from his present place of
vantage, it would carry a lighter thing, such as a man's body, in a circle
nearer to the shore. He yelled again, and the world seemed to him quiet for a
moment, while his voice echoed eerily in the void. Despencer must have heard
it, for the next moment he saw him slip pluckily overboard, making the cutter
heel desperately with his weight. And then&mdash;&mdash;it seemed an age
&mdash;a man, choking and struggling weakly, came down the current, and,
pushing his right arm out against the rush of water, he had caught the swimmer
by the collar and drawn him in to the side of the rock.</p>
<p>Then came the harder struggle. Maitland's left hand was numbing, and though
he had a foothold, it was too slight to lean on with full weight. A second
lassitude oppressed him, a supreme desire to slip into those racing tides and
rest. He was in no panic about death, but he had the practical man's love of an
accomplished task, and it nerved him to the extreme toil. Slowly by inches he
drew himself up the edge of the reef, cherishing jealously each grip and
foothold, with Despencer, half-choked and all but fainting, hanging heavily on
his right arm. Blind with spray, sick with sea-water, and aching with his
labours, he gripped at last the tangles of sea-weed, which meant the flat
surface, and with one final effort raised himself and Despencer to the top.
There he lay for a few minutes with his head in a rock-pool till the first
weariness had passed.</p>
<p>He staggered with his burden in his arms along the ragged reef to the strip
of sand where Clara was weeping hysterically. The sight of her restored
Maitland to vigour, the appeal of her lonely figure there in the wet brackens.
She must think them all dead, he reflected, and herself desolate, for she could
not have interpreted rightly his own wild rush into the waves. When she heard
his voice she started, as if at a ghost, and then seeing his burden, ran
towards him. "Oh, he is dead!" she cried. "Tell me! tell me!" and she clasped
the inert figure so that her arm crossed Maitland's. Despencer, stupefied and
faint, was roused to consciousness by a woman's kisses on his cheek, and still
more by his bearer abruptly laying him on the heather. Clara hung over him like
a mother, calling him by soft names, pushing his hair from his brow, forgetful
of her own wet and sorry plight. And meanwhile Maitland stood watching, while
his palace of glass was being shivered about his ears.</p>
<p>Aforetime his arrogance had kept him from any thought of jealousy; now the
time and place were too solemn for trifling, and facts were laid bare before
him. Sentiment does not bloom readily in a hard nature, but if it once comes to
flower it does not die without tears and lamentation. The wearied man, who
stood quietly beside the hysterical pair, had a moment of peculiar anguish.
Then he conquered sentiment, as he had conquered all other feelings of whose
vanity he was assured. He was now, as he was used to be, a man among children;
and as a man he had his work. He bent over Clara. "I know a hollow in the
middle of the island," he said, "where we can camp the night. I'll carry
Despencer, for his ankle is twisted. Do you think you could try to walk?"</p>
<p>The girl followed obediently, her eyes only on her lover. Her trust in the
other was infinite, her indifference to him impenetrable; while he, hopelessly
conscious of his fate, saw in the slim dishevelled figure at his side the lost
lady, the mistress for him of all romance and generous ambitions. The new
springs in his life were choked; he had still his work, his power, and, thank
God, his courage; but the career which ran out to the horizon of his vision was
black and loveless. And he held in his arms the thing which had frustrated him,
the thing he had pulled out of the deep in peril of his body; and at the
thought life for a moment seemed to be only a comic opera with tragedy to shift
the scenes.</p>
<p>He found a cleft between two rocks with a soft floor of heather. There had
been no rain, so the bracken was dry, and he gathered great armfuls and
driftwood logs from the shore. Soon he had a respectable pile of timber, and
then in the nick of the cleft he built a fire. His matches, being in his jacket
pocket, had escaped the drenchings of salt water, and soon with a smoke and
crackling and sweet scent of burning wood, a fire was going cheerily in the
darkness. Then he made a couch of bracken, and laid there the still feeble
Despencer. The man was more weak than ill; but for his ankle he was unhurt; and
a little brandy would have brought him to himself. But this could not be
provided, and Clara saw in his condition only the sign of mortal sickness. With
haggard eyes she watched by him, easing his head, speaking soft kind words,
forgetful of her own cold and soaking clothes. Maitland drew her gently to the
fire, shook down the bracken to make a rest for her head, and left a pile of
logs ready for use. "I am going to the end of the island," he said, "to light a
fire for a signal. It is the only part which they can see on the mainland, and
if they see the blaze they will come off for us as soon as it is light." The
pale girl listened obediently. This man was the master, and in his charge was
the safety of her lover and herself.</p>
<p>Maitland turned his back upon the warm nook, and stumbled along the ridge to
the northern extremity of the isle. It was not a quarter of a mile away, but
the land was so rough with gullies and crags that the journey took him nearly
an hour. Just off the extreme point was a flat rock, sloping northward to a
considerable height, a place from which a beacon could penetrate far over the
mainland. He gathered brackens for kindling, and driftwood which former tides
had heaped on the beach; and then with an armful he splashed through the
shallow surf to the rock. Scrambling to the top, he found a corner where a fire
might be lit, a place conspicuous and yet sheltered. Here he laid his kindling,
and then in many wet journeys he carried his stores of firewood from the
mainland to the rock. The lighting was nervous work, for he had few matches;
but at last the dampish wood had caught, and tongues of flame shot up out of
the smoke. Meantime the wind had sunk lower, the breakers seemed to have been
left behind, and the eternal surge of the tides became the dominant sound to
the watcher by the beacon.</p>
<p>And then, it seemed to him, the great convulsions of the night died away,
and a curious peace came down upon the waters. The fire leaped in the air, the
one living thing in a hushed and expectant world. It was not the quiet of sleep
but of a sudden cessation, like the lull after a great flood or a snowslip. The
tides still eddied and swayed, but it was noiselessly; the world moved, yet
without sound or friction. The bitter wind which chilled his face and stirred
up the red embers was like a phantom blast, without the roughness of a common
gale. For a moment he seemed to be set upon a huge mountain, with the world
infinitely remote beneath his feet. To all men there come moments of loneliness
of body, and to some few the mingled ecstasy and grief of loneliness of soul.
The child-tale of the Ocean Quiet came back to him, the hour of the Breathing
of God. Surely the great silence was now upon the world. But it was an evil
presage, for all who sailed into it were homeless wanderers for ever after. Ah
well! he had always been a wanderer, and the last gleam of home had been left
behind, where by the firelight in the cold cranny a girl was crooning over her
lover.</p>
<p>His past, his monotonous, brilliant past, slipped by with the knotless speed
of a vision. He saw a boy, haunted with dreams, chafing at present delights,
clutching evermore at the faint things of fancy. He saw a man, playing with the
counters which others played with, fighting at first for bare existence and
then for power and the pride of life. Success came over his path like a false
dawn, but he knew in his heart that he had never sought it. "What was that
remote ineffable thing he had followed? Here in the quiet of the shadowy waters
he had the moment of self-revelation which comes to all, and hopes and dim
desires seemed to stand out with the clearness of accomplished facts. There had
always been something elect and secret at the back of his fiercest ambitions.
The ordinary cares of men had been to him but little things to be played with;
he had won by despising them; casting them from him, they had fallen into the
hollow of his hand. And he had held them at little, finding his reward in his
work, and in a certain alertness and freshness of spirit which he had always
cherished. There is a story of island-born men who carry into inland places and
the streets of cities the noise of sea-water in their ears, and hear
continually the tern crying and the surf falling. So from his romantic boyhood
this man had borne an arrogance towards the things of the world which had given
him a contemptuous empire over a share of them. As he saw the panorama of his
life no place or riches entered into it, but only himself, the haggard,
striving soul, growing in power, losing, perhaps, in wisdom. And then, at the
end of the way, Death, to shrivel the power to dust, and with the might of his
sunbeam to waken to life the forgotten world of the spirit.</p>
<p>In the hush he seemed to feel the wheel and the drift of things, the cosmic
order of nature. He forgot his weariness and his plashing clothes as he put
more wood on the beacon and dreamed into the night. The pitiless sea, infinite,
untamable, washing the Poles and hiding Earth's secrets in her breast, spoke to
him with a far-remembered voice. The romance of the remote isles, the homes of
his people, floating still in a twilight of old story, rose out of the
darkness. His life, with its routine and success, seemed in a moment hollow, a
child's game, unworthy of a man. The little social round, the manipulation of
half-truths, the easy victories over fools surely this was not the task for
him. He was a dreamer, but a dreamer with an iron hand; he was scarcely in the
prime of life; the world was wide and his chances limitless. One castle of
cards had already been overthrown; the Ocean Quiet was undermining another. He
was sick of domesticity of every sort of town, of home, of civilisation. The
sad elemental world was his, the fury and the tenderness of nature, the peace
of the wilds which old folk had called the Breathing of God. "<i>Parmi ceu haut
bois conduyrai m'amie</i>"&mdash;this was still his motto, to carry untarnished
to the end an austere and beautiful dream. His little ambitions had been but
shreds and echoes and shadows of this supreme reality. And his love had been
but another such simulacrum; for what he had sought was no foolish, laughing
girl, but the Immortal Shepherdess, who, singing the old songs of youth, drives
her flocks to the hill in the first dewy dawn of the world.</p>
<p>Suddenly he started and turned his head. Day was breaking in a red windy
sky, and somewhere a boat's oars were plashing in the sea. And then he realised
for the first time that he was cold and starving and soaked to the bone.</p>
<br>

<h3><i>Mr Henry Durward to Lady Claudia Etheridge.</i></h3>
<p>"... Things have happened, my dear Clo, since I last wrote; time has passed;
to-morrow I leave this place and go to stalk with Drapier; and yet in the
stress of departure I take time to answer the host of questions with which you
assailed me. I am able to give you the best of news. You have won your bet.</p>
<p>Your prophecy about the conduct of the 'other Etheridge girl' has come out
right. They are both here, as it happens, having come on from Fountainblue,
both the hero and the heroine, I mean, of this most reasonable romance. You
know Jack Despencer, one of the best people in the world, though a trifle given
to chirping. But I don't think the grasshopper will become a burden to Miss
Clara, for she likes that sort of thing. She must, for there is reason to
believe that she refused for its sake the greatest match&mdash;I speak with all
reverence&mdash;which this happy country could offer. I know you like Maitland
as little as I do, but we agree in admiring the Colossus from a distance. Well,
the Colossus has, so to speak, been laid low by a frivolous member of your sex.
It is all a most romantic tale. Probably you have heard the gist of it, but
here is the full and circumstantial account.</p>
<p>"We found Maitland beside the fire he had been feeding all night, and I
shall never forget his figure alone in the dawn on that rock, drenched and
dishevelled, but with his haggard white face set like a Crusader's. He took us
to a kind of dell in the centre of the island, where we found Clara and
Despencer shivering beside a dying fire. He had a twisted ankle and had got a
bad scare, while she was perfectly composed, though she broke down when we got
home. It must have been an awful business for both, but Maitland never seems to
have turned a hair. I want to know two things. First, how in the presence of
great danger he managed to get his dismissal from the lady, for get it he
assuredly did, and Despencer at once appeared in the part of the successful
lover; second, what part he played in the night's events. Clara remembered
little, Despencer only knew that he had been pulled out of the sea, but over
all Maitland seems to have brooded like a fate. As usual he told us nothing. It
was always his way to give the world results and leave it to find out his
methods for itself...</p>
<p>"Despencer overwhelmed him with gratitude. His new happiness made him in
love with life, and he included Maitland in the general affection. The night's
events seemed to have left their mark on the great man also. He was very quiet,
forgot to be rude to anybody, and was kind to both Clara and Despencer. It is
his way of acknowledging defeat, the great gentleman's way, for, say what we
like about him, he is a tremendous gentleman, one of the last of the
breed...</p>
<p>"And then he went away two days later. Just before he went Hugh Clanroyden
and myself were talking in the library, which has a window opening on a
flower-garden. Despencer was lying in an invalid's chair under a tree and Clara
was reading to him. Maitland was saying good-bye, and he asked for Despencer.
We told him that he was with Clara in the garden. He smiled one of those odd
scarce smiles of his, and went out to them. When I saw his broad shoulders
bending over the chair and the strong face looking down at the radiant Jack
with his amiable good looks, confound it, Clo, I had to contrast the pair, and
admit with Shakespeare the excellent foppery of the 'world. Well- a-day!
'Smooth Jacob still robs homely Esau.' And perhaps it is a good thing, for we
are most of us Jacobs, and Esau is an uncomfortable fellow in our midst.</p>
<p>"A week later came the surprising, the astounding news that he had taken the
African Governorship. A career ruined, every one said, the finest chance in the
world flung away; and then people speculated, and the story came out in bits,
and there was only one explanation. It is the right one, as I think you will
agree, but it points to some hidden weakness in that iron soul that he could be
moved to fling over the ambitions of years because of a girl's choice. He will
go and bury himself in the wilds, and our party will have to find another
leader. Of course he will do his work well, but it is just as if I were to give
up my chances of the Woolsack for a county-court judgeship. Ho will probably be
killed, for he has a million enemies; he is perfectly fearless, and he does not
understand the arts of compromise. It was a privilege, I shall always feel, to
have known him. He was a great man, and yet intellect, power, character, were
at the mercy of a girl's caprice. As I write, I hear Clara's happy laugh below
in the garden, probably at some witticism of the fortunate Jack's. Upon which,
with my usual pride in the obvious, I am driven to reflect that the weak things
in life may confound the strong, and that, after all, the world is to the
young... "</p>
<br>
<h3>VI</h3>
<h3><i>Sir Hugh Clanroyden to Mr Henry Durward. Some years later.</i></h3>
<p>"... I am writing this on board ship, as you will see from the heading, and
shall post it when I get to the Cape. You have heard of my appointment, and I
need not tell you how deep were my searchings of heart before I found courage
to accept. Partly I felt that I had got my chance; partly I thought an
inconsequent feeling that Maitland, if he had lived, would have been glad to
see me in the place. But I am going to wear the Giant's robe, and Heaven knows
I have not the shoulders to fill it. Yet I am happy in thinking that I am in a
small sense faithful to his memory.</p>
<p>"No further news, I suppose, has come of the manner of his death? Perhaps we
shall never know, for it was on one of those Northern expeditions with a few
men by which he held the frontier. I wonder if any one will ever write fully
the history of all that he did? It must have been a titanic work, but his
methods were always so quiet that people accepted his results like a gift from
Providence. He was given, one gathers, a practically free hand, and he made the
country four years' work of a man of genius. They wished to bring his body
home, but he made them bury him where he fell&mdash;a characteristic last
testament. And so he has gone out of the world into the world's history.</p>
<p>"I am still broken by his death, but, now that he is away, I begin to see
him more clearly. Most people, I think, misunderstood him. I was one of his
nearest friends, and I only knew bits of the man. For one thing and I hate to
use the vulgar word he was the only aristocrat I ever heard of. Our classes are
three-fourths of them of yesterday's growth, without the tradition, character,
manner, or any trait of an aristocracy. And the few, who are nominally of the
blood, have gone to seed in mind, or are spoilt by coarse marriages, or, worst
of all, have the little trifling superior airs of incompetence. But he, he had
the most transcendent breeding in mind and spirit. He had no need for self-
assertion, for his most casual acquaintances put him at once in a different
class from all other men. He had never a trace of a vulgar ideal; men's
opinions, worldly honour, the common pleasures of life, were merely degrees of
the infinitely small. And yet he was no bloodless mystic. If race means
anything, he had it to perfection. Dreams and fancies to him were the
realities, while facts were the shadows which he made dance as it pleased
him.</p>
<p>"The truth is, that he was that rarest of mortals, the iron dreamer. He
thought in aeons and cosmic cycles, and because of it he could do what he
pleased in life. We call a man practical if he is struggling in the crowd with
no knowledge of his whereabouts, and yet in our folly we deny the name to the
clear-sighted man who can rule the crowd from above. And here I join issue with
you and everybody else. You thought it was Miss Clara's refusal which sent him
abroad and interrupted his career. I read the thing otherwise. His love for the
girl was a mere accident, a survival of the domestic in an austere spirit.
Something, I do not know what, showed him his true desires. She may have
rejected him; he may never have spoken to her; in any case the renunciation had
to come. You must remember that that visit to Fountainblue was the first that
he had paid since his boyhood to his boyhood's home. Those revisitings have
often a strange trick of self-revelation. I believe that in that night on the
island he saw our indoor civilisation and his own destiny in so sharp a
contrast that he could not choose but make the severance. He found work where
there could be small hope of honour or reward, but many a * chance for a hero.
And I am sure that he was happy, and that it was the longed-for illumination
that dawned on him with the bullet which pierced his heart.</p>
<p>"But, you will say, the fact remains that he was once in love with Miss
Clara, and that she would have none of him. I do not deny it. He was never a
favourite with women; but, thank Heaven, I have better things to do than study
