<p class="first"><i>FOR motor traffic, between Melbourne and
Adelaide, the route for many miles lies along the fringe of the
great Ninety-Mile Desert, between the desert and the waters of
the Coorong.</i></p>

<p><i>The Coorong is a long, sinuous lake running for sixty miles
parallel with the coast and separated from the sea only by a
narrow chain of sand hummocks.</i></p>

<p><i>To the traveller, this part of the Adelaide-Melbourne route
has always been the one most dreaded&mdash;because of its
drifting sands, its loneliness, and the absence of all help
should help be required.</i></p>
<br>
<hr>

<h2><a id="ch1"></a>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class="first">THE sun had set a good four hours, but night
hung heavy, like a smouldering furnace, over the sandhills of the
Coorong.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty degrees in the shade had been
registered during the day, and even now, with the hour well on
towards midnight, the temperature had fallen to only just below
the century.</p>

<p>Not a breath of air stirred anywhere, and the dead black
waters of the Coorong seemed hardly stiller than were the just
faintly lapping waves of the hot sea itself.</p>

<p>A ghostly silence brooded over everything. Sea, land, and air
lay wrapt in torpor, and only the myriad stars of an Australian
summer night peeped through and twinkled with any signs of
life.</p>

<p>But still, late as the hour was and desolate as was at most
times the long Coorong track, to-night it was not altogether
deserted by humankind.</p>

<p>Almost at its wildest part, and about thirty-five miles from
the township of Meningie, was drawn up a small, black touring
car.</p>

<p>The car lay just off the track itself, and round a bend where
the curve was sharp, between two huge sand hummocks.</p>

<p>There was no one visible in the car.</p>

<p>Close near, however, and upon a high sandhill were two men,
and, although motionless and outstretched at full length upon the
sand, they were evidently not asleep, for their attitudes were
not those of rest or repose.</p>

<p>They were watching.</p>

<p>One of them, a tall, big man, was clutching a pair of large
binoculars, and, his arms supported upon his elbows, he never for
one moment took his eye off the windings of the Coorong track. He
looked always, however, in the direction of Melbourne.</p>

<p>He breathed hard, and every now and then his hands
trembled.</p>

<p>His companion, a man of small physique and with a pair of
ferrety little eyes set deeply in his head, was obviously, too,
ill at ease, for he kept swallowing as if he had a lump in his
throat, and from time to time he sighed heavily.</p>

<p>For a full hour the two men had exchanged no word, and,
although so close together, so uncommunicative were they, it
might almost have been assumed that each was actually unaware of
the other's presence.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the man with the binoculars jerked up his
head and spoke.</p>

<p>"Here he is!' he exclaimed, with a catch in his voice.
"There's a car coming over the swamp."</p>

<br>

<a id="pic1"></a>

<p class="caption">"Here he is!' he exclaimed, "There's a car coming over the swamp."</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>The little man shivered violently, and his teeth began to
chatter like castanets.</p>

<p>The big man turned on him with a snarl.</p>

<p>"Pull yourself together," he exclaimed savagely. "What are you
afraid of, you fool? There's no danger if you do as you're told."
He gritted his teeth menacingly. "But, by God, I tell you, it'll
be the end of you if you mess it up. You'll pay for it first if
anything goes wrong, and you just take that in."</p>

<p>"All right, all right," replied the little man testily. "I'm
not afraid, but this long waiting's got on my nerves. It's three
hours nearly since we came up here, and it's enough to make
anyone feel bad. But I won't mess it up. I know what to do. I'll
go and get the lamp now."</p>

<p>"No, you just wait," growled the other. "It'll be a long while
before he gets here yet, and we must be sure it's him in the
car."</p>

<p>He turned back to his binoculars, and again there was silence
between the two men, only this time the smaller one remained
standing up.</p>

<p>Far away, a faint spot of light had appeared, very faint at
first, and visible only through the binoculars. It moved like a
glow-worm, trailing languidly along by the edge of the lake.</p>

<p>"He can't come fast," muttered the big man. "The going's bad,
and he'll be in low gear all the way."</p>

<p>Gradually, however, the light waxed stronger, and in a few
minutes the two men from their high vantage point could plainly
trace each foot of its journey as a big motor car made its
laborious way along the winding track in and out among the
sandhills.</p>

<p>"It's an eight-cylinder Jehu, right enough," whispered the big
man in tense, hoarse tones, "and it's a hundred to one it'll be
him. But we'll have to be quick now. You know where to wave the
lamp."</p>

<p>He snapped his glasses together with a click, and, rising
quickly to his feet, without further comment followed his
companion in a slouching run down the high hummock side towards
the waiting motor car.</p>

<p>Eli Barton, the wealthy cattle king, and the owner of vast
properties in the Commonwealth, was motoring from Melbourne to
Adelaide to see his great horse, Abimeleck, run in the Christmas
Cup.</p>

<p>Strong and active in spite of his age, and strenuous alike
both in his work and in his pleasure, he had left Melbourne in
the very early hours of the previous morning. The five hundred
and eighty odd miles that separate the two cities he expected to
cover, as he had often done before, in two days. As usual, he was
bringing no chauffeur with him, but was driving the car himself.
The long journey was nothing to him, and it was well known to be
his constant habit to negotiate it quite alone. He liked to go
alone, he always told his friends, for so full was every hour of
his busy life that it was only when motoring, he averred, that he
could be entirely free from business worries and quit of the
eternal weighing up of the value of other people's ideas.</p>

<p>So, whenever occasion offered, he took the
Melbourne&mdash;Adelaide journey alone, and drove his mighty
eight-cylinder Jehu with all the speed that the roughness and the
danger of the track allowed.</p>

<p>But on this particular journey it so happened that he was not
unaccompanied. A very old friend had arrived unexpectedly from
the United States, and, breaking his usual procedure, Eli Barton
had brought him as a companion.</p>

<p>The two occupants of the car were both drowsy, apparently from
the heat, but maybe, also, it was the good dinner they had just
eaten that made them disinclined to talk. At any rate, it was a
long ten miles before either of them spoke, and then it was Eli
Barton who first broke the silence.</p>

<p>"Eighty-two miles to go, yet, my boy," he remarked, "before we
get to Meningie and, with not a house to pass, it's a million to
one we don't meet a soul."</p>

<p>"But isn't the heat awful?" went on Eli. "I'd give almost
anything now for a good downpour of rain."</p>

<p>"Good gracious! Not to-night, I hope. We don't want it
here."</p>

<p>Eli Barton laughed. "Don't get nervous, Sam," he replied.
"We're not likely to get it, but it was of Abimeleck I was
thinking, not of ourselves." His voice dropped into anxious
tones. "I don't know even now if I shall run him on Saturday. The
going will be like iron, I am afraid, and, as I've told you, I'm
a bit worried about his legs. He's done a lot of racing this
year, and I'm not going to risk anything now, even for the
Adelaide Christmas Cup. He's far too valuable to me for that, and
if there's the slightest suspicion of anything wrong, I tell you,
I shall scratch him to-morrow, directly I arrive."</p>

<p>"There'll be an awful howl, Eli, won't there, if you do?"</p>

<p>Eli Barton set his face in that determined frown which all his
life his enemies had known so well.</p>

<p>"I can't help it if there is," he replied decisively. "I shall
be a greater sufferer than anybody if he doesn't run. I had
another thousand on him last week, and the public have made him
so hot that I only got two's. Two's mind you, and he's got ten
stone four to shoulder over a mile and three-quarters, and with
some clinking good horses in the race, too." He smiled proudly.
"But I shan't scratch him if I can possibly help it, for I want
to show the Adelaide folks what a really good horse can do. He's
the best horse I've ever owned and, with all his weight, I
believe he'll romp home."</p>

<p>A silence fell again upon the occupants of the car and, as old
Barton had prophesied, he had soon to drop on to low gear.</p>

<p>Eli looked round and then smiled to himself.</p>

<p>"Dear old Sam, like me, he's getting old," he muttered. "I
suppose now he'll sleep right on to Meningie."</p>

<p>But he was mistaken.</p>

<p>The big Jehu was ploughing its way through a particularly deep
drift of sand, when suddenly, to his great astonishment, he saw a
light being waved ahead, and a few seconds later the headlights
of the car brought into view a smallish-looking man standing in
the middle of the track and gesticulating wildly. The track
sloped up sharply behind where the man stood, curving abruptly
between huge sandhills on either side.</p>

<p>Eli Barton brought the car gently to a standstill. They were
in the middle of a sort of sand ravine and the headlights,
because of the bend, illuminated the track only for about thirty
yards.</p>

<p>"Don't come on," shouted the man with the lantern. "The
track's blocked and you can't get through. There's been an
accident."</p>

<p>"Good Lord! what a place," ejaculated Eli. "Anybody hurt?"</p>

<p>"Yes, one of them's killed," replied the man, and he shielded
his eyes with his hand. "Oh! Oh!" he muttered instantly to
himself, "he's got some one with him. There'll be two of them
now."</p>

<p>Eli Barton sprang out of the car, and was followed promptly by
his now thoroughly awakened companion.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five miles from Meningie, Sam," said Eli, "and no help
for them until they get there. How did it happen?" he called to
the man. "Was there a collision?"</p>

<p>But the man with the lantern made no reply. He stood
hesitating, as if uncertain what to do. He made no attempt to
move back to the scene of the accident.</p>

<p>Eli repeated his question.</p>

<p>"Was it a collision?" he asked sharply. "Here, you fellow,
have you lost your tongue?"</p>

<p>The man seemed to bring himself together with an effort. "Yes,
there was a collision," he replied, and at once he made to
shamble back along the track.</p>

<p>But the two travellers were close upon his heels when the bend
was reached.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Eli Barton flashed an electric torch. "Hullo!
Hullo!" he exclaimed suspiciously. "The track's not blocked and
there's only one car. Where was the collision?"</p>

<p>But the man with the lantern only muttered something
indistinctly, and Eli, losing patience, caught him roughly by the
arm.</p>

<p>"What's your game?" he asked sharply. "Turn round and let's
look at your face," and he flashed the torch full upon him.</p>

<p>Instantly the man ducked his head, and at the same time,
jerking away his arm, he started to run.</p>

<p>"Look out, Sam," shouted Eli. "Catch the beggar, quick,
there's something fishy here. Shoot if he doesn't stop. Shoot, I
tell you, quick."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="first">THEY were the last words Eli Barton ever spoke.
There was a sudden flash of fire from behind the small car in the
shadows&mdash;the loud crack of a revolver fired at close range,
and the great cattle king dropped lifeless upon the sands of the
Coorong with a bullet in his brain.</p>

<p>With a cry of rage Sam Gover sprang forward and the man with
the lantern went down under a fierce blow upon the head.</p>

<p>The lantern was extinguished in his fall.</p>

<p>Instantly Sam Gover darted to seize him, but the man was too
quick, and, springing to his feet, he dashed off towards the
small car.</p>

<p>Then the big revolver cracked again, but this time obviously
without effect, for it was answered at once by the snapper and
much sharper bark of a little automatic pistol.</p>

<p>Old Sam Gover had not passed half his life out West for
nothing, and he could size up a situation as quickly as any
man.</p>

<p>Three times the little automatic barked and there was a shrill
squeal of pain from the man who had waved the lantern. Unhappily
for him, he had not been quite quick enough in getting into
cover, and with the bone of an arm shattered he subsided, a faint
and huddled heap, upon the sands.</p>

<p>Then followed long moments of dreadful silence, the hard,
tense silence of men waiting&mdash;with the angel of death
hovering near.</p>

<p>All in an instant, as it were, a spirit of dark evil had
descended on the place, and into the peace and stillness of the
night had avalanched a hell of furious strife.</p>

<p>The smoke from the revolver clung like a funeral pall upon the
track, and the acrid reek of powder, like incense in some
horrible temple of pain, hung sickeningly upon the air.</p>

<p>Sam Gover had flung himself flat upon the sands, and, although
his heart beat like a piston, his mind was deadly cold and
clear.</p>

<p>He was making no mistake about the peril he was in. That they
had fallen into a carefully prepared ambush he was sure, but what
exactly was the strength of it he did not attempt to guess.</p>

<p>Eli Barton was most probably already dead, and he himself was
in the worst predicament possible. Within a few yards of an
assassin with a revolver, he was lying right out in the open air
with no cover at all. The slightest sound and it would betray
where he was.</p>

<p>He began to wriggle stealthily back along the sand.</p>

<p><br>
Suddenly, however, there was a sharp click, and he was blinded
in a ghostly glare. The man with the revolver had switched on the
spot-light of his car.</p>

<p>Realising instantly the peril that now faced him. Sam Gover
sprang to his feet and fired rapidly at the light, but for the
third time the revolver spoke, and immediately the automatic
dropped from his grasp. He tottered and half fell, but without
mercy the revolver was fired again, and the old man, with no
attempt now to recover himself, dropped bloody and unconscious
upon the sands.</p>

<p>A moment later, and the man with the revolver stepped out from
behind the light, walking warily, and ready upon the instant to
fire again.</p>

<p>But that it was unnecessary was at once apparent, for Sam
Gover lay quite motionless and his eyes were closed.</p>

<p>With his teeth chattering, the man turned quickly to the body
of Eli Barton, and he shuddered when he saw the bullet-hole in
the very centre of the forehead. He bent down, however, and tore
violently at the dead man's coat, abstracting a thick wallet from
the breast pocket. His eyes glistened as he noted the
contents.</p>

<br>

<a id="pic2"></a>

<p class="caption">He bent down and tore violently at the dead man's coat.</p>
</div>

<br>

<p>Then, all at once, it seemed as if for the first time he had
become afraid, and sweat burst out upon his forehead in big
drops. He looked round wildly in every direction, and then,
almost as if some one was actually pursuing him, ran to the top of
the big sandhill near, and breathlessly regarded the outlook from
every side.</p>

<p>But there was nothing to occasion any alarm. He could see
nothing but the lights of Eli Barton's car behind the hummocks,
the dim blackness everywhere upon the sands, and the bright stars
peeping overhead.</p>

<p>He ran back to his own car.</p>

<p>"Look here," he exclaimed breathlessly to the small man who
was lying on the sands and moaning faintly, "both of them are
dead, and we shall be hanged for it if we don't look out."</p>

<p>"I shall say I didn't do it," wailed the other; "my arm's
broken, and I'm bleeding to death."</p>

<p>"We shall be hanged, I tell you," went on the big man
excitedly, and, jerking his head in the direction of the bodies
lying out in the glare of the light. "We must get rid of them,
quick, and their car, too. We haven't a second to spare. Someone
may come by any moment. Do you hear?"</p>

<p>But the small man only shook his head. "I'm done with," he
groaned. "I'm fainting with pain."</p>

<p>The voice of the big man hardened into rage. "Pull yourself
together, you whining fool," he exclaimed furiously. "It's all
your fault that you were hit at all. You oughtn't to have stopped
them when you saw there were two in the car, and then you muddled
everything by starting to run. You're not much hurt,
anyhow&mdash;it's only a scratch."</p>

<p>He snapped viciously at the spot light, and turned it round so
that its rays fell full upon the wounded man. Then his jaw
dropped in dismay. The face of his companion was ghastly white,
his right arm lay at a dreadful angle, and he was drenched in
blood.</p>

<p>The big man cursed deeply. "Now, what are we to do, with you
like this?" he asked desperately. "We must get their car off the
track at once. It must be hidden 20 miles in the bush before we
shall be safe." His breath came in trembling gasps. "The black
trackers will be put on, if anything's found here." His voice
broke to a sob. "The black trackers, do you understand? And
there'll be the bloodhounds, too."</p>

<p>But the small man only shook his head again. "I can't do
anything," he moaned. "I shall faint if I move. I believe I'm
going to die."</p>

<p>For a long minute the big man stood speechless in his fears,
but then, suddenly resolved upon some course of action, he ran at
full speed to the big Jehu car.</p>

<p>It was barely 50 yards away, but he was panting hard when he
reached it.</p>

<p>He jumped in, and, starting the engine, drove fiercely through
the heavy sand. Arriving where the bodies lay he pulled up, and,
springing out bundled them both into the back of the car. Then,
without an instant's further delay, he drove on again, and as
furiously as the big Jehu could plough its way, proceeded along
the track in the direction of Meningie.</p>

<p>But he did not drive that way very far.</p>

<p>A couple of hundred yards, at most, and he turned off sharply
at right angles to the track. The ground was very heavy, but by
putting the car on to its lowest gear he managed to make headway,
although at times the wheels were buried almost to their axles in
the sand.</p>

<p>Soon he was well away from the Coorong track and deep among
the sandhills. His surroundings were now as desolate and lonely
as the mind of any human being could conceive, but for all that
he kept on looking round as if he were expecting any moment to
encounter some one.</p>

<p>All at once he saw that he was passing close to a small gully,
and after a moment's indecision he stopped the car abruptly and
lugging out the body of Sam Gover dragged it to the gully-side,
and rolled it in. He was about to do the same to Eli Barton,
when, on the still night air, there came up the distant barking
of a fox.</p>

<p>He knew at once that it was only a fox, but the suddenness of
the sound startled him, and, with an oath of terror, he dashed
round the car and switched off both the engine and the
lights.</p>

<p>Then, holding his breath, he stood motionless. His face had
taken on a dreadful hunted look and his eyes were strained and
bulged with fear. He listened.</p>

<p>But there was now no sound to be heard anywhere. The stillness
of a dead world and the silence of the grave encompassed him.</p>

<p>Pulling himself together with an effort, and with no care any
longer for the car and its ghostly burden, he dashed off at a
feverish run, back along the way he had just come.</p>

<p>And all the time he was thinking hard.</p>

<p>He had killed two men and he was faced starkly with the
consequences of his crime. He was in danger, great danger, for he
could not now, he saw, effectively cover up all traces of the
murders, hampered as he was with a wounded man.</p>

<p>If only he could have driven the car away to where he had
intended, he would have felt quite safe, he told himself, for
exactly what had happened to Eli Barton might then never have
become known.</p>

<p>Out in the loneliness of the great Ninety-Mile Desert there
were places that he knew of where no one ever came, and, given
there to the winds and the sands, the car with its contents would
soon have become impenetrably hidden from all human eyes. It
could never have been proved then with any certainty that,
whatever had occurred to the two men, their fate had overtaken
them upon the track of the Coorong.</p>

<p>No one would have ever been sure that the two travellers had
not successfully negotiated the whole length of the Coorong, and
vanished in some other part of the State of South Australia.</p>

<p>But now everything was different.</p>

<p>He had been able to take the car only a short distance away,
because every yard he had driven it into the desert he had had to
retrace himself on foot, for with his companion helpless there
was no one to follow behind with the second car. And so the big
Jehu was lying close at hand as damning evidence within a
half-mile of the track itself.</p>

<p>Then what would happen when, within a few hours, the hue and
cry was raised for the missing man? Eli Barton was an important
person in the Commonwealth, and, once the sinister nature of his
disappearance was suspected, the police of South Australia would
be turned hot-foot upon the trail.</p>

<p>The Coorong would, of course, become at once the starting
point for all investigations, for the last thing definitely known
of the travellers would be that they had taken the track from
Kingston. So search parties would be rushed down, and the
vicinity of the Coorong track would be combed from end to
end.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch3"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class="first">AT latest the car would be found in a few days,
and then it would be known definitely how Eli Barton and his
friend had met their deaths. Then would follow inquiries and
investigations in every direction, and how&mdash;how would he be
able to account for the condition of the wounded man?</p>

<p>The very nature of the wound itself would be suspicious. And
once any questioning began, how could he be certain either that
his companion would not show the white feather and give
everything away? In any case a satisfactory explanation would be
difficult to find.</p>

<p>He cursed deeply again at his predicament. Then suddenly a
cruel and dreadful expression crossed his face, and the sweat
that dropped from his forehead was not now the sweat only of his
laboured pace.</p>

<p>Abruptly his running was slowed down and, approaching the
small car, he dropped all at once to a slow and stealthy walk.
Then&mdash;it might almost have been said that he was creeping
forward on his toes. He seemed, too, to be holding in his breath,
and his right hand had slipped back to the pocket on his hip.</p>

<p>Without a sound he crept up to where the wounded man lay and
then&mdash;suddenly there came a loud report. The man with the
ferrety eyes was in suffering no more. His brains had been blown
away.</p>

<p>So that night there were three men sleeping by the dark track
of the Coorong.</p>

<p>One was tucked huddled in a shallow grave beneath the sands; a
second there was who stiffened and grew cold in the tonneau of
the big Jehu car, while, close by, a third lay ghastly and
uncovered to the sky.</p>

<p>Towards this last, as dawn was breaking, a fox came slouching
up.</p>

<p>Perhaps the animal was only inquisitive or perhaps&mdash;he
sniffed the smell of blood.</p>

<p>He crept up close and&mdash;he turned suddenly and scampered
off. Something had frightened him.</p>

<p><br>
IT was the Christmas Cup day at Adelaide, and long before the
time when the first race was due to be run an enormous crowd was
gathering on the racecourse at Cheltenham.</p>

<p>A good programme of events had been arranged, but on all sides
the great attraction was the Cup race itself. In addition to a
gold cup, it was for the fine stake of &pound;3000, and there
were some first-rate performers down to run. Indeed, the very
cream of South Australian thoroughbreds would line up before the
starter, and so well had the handicapper done his work that no
one particular horse among the home State entries stood out
prominently in the public favour. But, at the same time, few
could have said that it promised to be a good betting race.</p>

<p>Everything was overshadowed by the presence of an Inter-State
horse from across the border.</p>

<p>Eli Barton, the wealthy stockowner from Victoria, had sent his
great horse, Abimeleck, to throw down the gauntlet to the equine
aristocracy of South Australia, and the general opinion was that
they would all go down before him in the lists.</p>

<p>It was true the handicapper had by no means forgotten the
distinguished visitor, and had given him the steadier of ten
stone four, or sixteen pounds more than had been allotted to the
next horse below him, but then Abimeleck, as everyone knew, was
in a class quite by himself.</p>

<p>A son of Judah out of Sweetness, he was a magnificent specimen
of a four year-old, and had well earned every ounce of the big
weight that had been allotted to him.</p>

<p>A great horse, he had not been beaten since his two-year-old
days, and in his last eight races he had never been really
extended. Carrying top weight always, he had won, it seemed, with
effortless ease.</p>

<p>So, directly the acceptances had been published, he had been
seized upon by the public as a good thing and 'fours' had been
the greatest odds at any time offered against him.</p>

<p>Even 'fours' would certainly not have been obtainable had
there not been for some time suspicions of trouble in one of his
legs. It was true the suspicion was only a very slight one, but
his owner, unwilling to run risks, had twice at the last moment,
on that account, withdrawn him from an engagement.</p>

<p>It was this uncertainty, this slight element of doubt, that
had enabled the horse's admirers to obtain the extended odds, and
up to the very morning of the race they had been all on the best
terms with themselves.</p>

<p>Everything had seemed propitious for the champion's success, A
week previously he had arrived safely in Adelaide, and his
subsequent performance on the track had been all that his
admirers could have desired.</p>

<p>He had gone splendidly at exercise, he had taken his food
well, and his trainer, who had accompanied him, had been observed
as wearing always a most confident and happy smile.</p>

<p>So things had been right up to this the very morning of the
race, and then, all suddenly, the presentiment of some impending
misfortune had come to his backers, and as the crowds gathered
upon the racecourse side this uneasy feeling was soon everywhere
apparent.</p>

<p><br>
What exactly was happening no one knew, and on the face of it,
the apprehension seemed absurd.</p>

<p>The horse had actually arrived upon the racecourse and, the
centre of a big admiring crowd, he was now duly standing in his
allotted stall in the paddock. (His admirers noticed with a pang,
however, that the number of the stall was thirteen.) The jockey,
too, who was to ride him was actually on the spot&mdash;Pat
O'Connor, the famous Sydney crack. Lots of people had seen him
drive up to the racecourse in a car. So everything was
satisfactory there.</p>

<p>Still, however, the public were uneasy, and long before the
time when the first race was due to be run rumours began to
crystallise and take on ugly forms.</p>

<p>An anxious consultation was being held between Tom Sellick,
the trainer of Abimeleck, young Stanley Barton, the nephew of Eli
Barton, and the secretary of the Port Adelaide Racing Club.</p>

<p>It was being held in the secretary's room, and it was evident
that those taking part were moved by some strong emotion. The
trainer's face was grave, that of the young nephew of Eli Barton
was frowning, and that of the secretary was flushed and
angry.</p>

<p>"No," Tom Sellick was saying, doggedly, "I can't bring him
out, sir. If I did, it would be directly contrary to the orders
that I have received."</p>

<p>"But the animal's perfectly fit and well to run, isn't he,"
insisted the Secretary.</p>

<p>"As far as my opinion goes, yes," replied the trainer, slowly.
He shook his head determinedly. "But that's nothing to do with
his running. I tell you I'm not the owner. I'm only the trainer.
I've just got to obey orders. Mr. Barton employs me, and his last
words to me were: 'Mind, I shan't decide about his running until
I go over him myself.'"</p>

<p>"But look at the crowds here," pleaded the secretary, "and
think of the way he's been backed. It'll be a dreadful take-down
for the public if he doesn't run."</p>

<p>Tom Sellick looked straight before him. "It's not my horse,
sir," he said firmly, "and, I tell you again, I've nothing to do
with his running. Nothing at all."</p>

<p>The secretary turned impatiently to young Stanley Barton. "I
suppose you have no authority, Mr. Barton? You can't help us in
any way?"</p>

<p>The young man shook his head grimly. He was a good-looking
young fellow, between four and five and twenty and, although the
general expression of his face was frank and boyish, there were
lines of determination about his mouth and chin that would have
made an observant stranger chary of antagonising the forces that
he saw there.</p>

<p>"Mr. Sellick is quite right," he said slowly, "and if I were
in his place, although I grant you it's unpleasant, I should take
the same stand. He can't up-saddle till my uncle tells him
to."</p>

<p>"But where on earth is your uncle?" queried the secretary
irritably, "and why is it he isn't here?"</p>

<p>The young man eyed his interrogator very gravely.</p>

<p>"If we could tell you that, Mr. Secretary, we should be much
easier in our minds than we, at present, are." He shrugged his
shoulders and went on slowly. "Neither Mr. Sellick here nor I can
think of the slightest reason for my uncle not being here now. He
left Melbourne for Adelaide in his car early on Wednesday
morning. That I know for certain, for I myself saw him start. He
can't have been taken ill for he had a friend with him, who would
certainly have let us know. His car can't have broken down
either, for I followed after him twenty-four hours later, exactly
along the same way he must have come. I heard of him all the way
as far as Kingston, and then no one mentions his having passed."
He shook his head very solemnly. "I tell you, I don't like it,
for it's not my uncle's way to let people down."</p>

<p>A couple of minutes later young Barton and the trainer,
leaving the secretary's room, almost ran into a tall, middle-aged
man, and a pretty dark eyed girl, who were standing just
outside.</p>

<p>The trainer started to apologise, and then suddenly his
worried, anxious face broke into a smile.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Jim," he said to the tall man, "nearly knocked you
over that time, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Yes, you did, Tom," replied the latter smiling, too. "But
I'll forgive you if you never do worse to me than that."</p>

<p>"Who was he?" whispered Stanley, when a moment later they had
passed on.</p>

<p>"He's called Dice," replied the trainer. "He's got a station
down the south-east. I used to know him, however, years ago in
Victoria. He was in the Light Horse with my brother during the
Boer War. He is a very decent chap, but always a very unlucky
one. He's got a horse running in the Cup to-day. Black Wolf, but
it's not got the ghost of a chance."</p>

<p>"Who's the girl?" asked Stanley, carelessly.</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the trainer, the worried look
beginning to cloud over his face again. "His wife perhaps. She
doesn't look like his daughter. He was a widower, I remember, a
couple of years ago."</p>

<p>A few minutes later and up went the number for the Cup. All
doubts about the favourite were at once dispelled, for it was now
seen for certain that he was not going to run. His number was
absent from the frame.</p>

<p>A flutter of dismay ran through the crowd, a long murmur of
disappointment, and then a perfect babel of inquiry buzzed round.
It was undoubtedly a great set-back for the public, but it spoke
well for the reputation of Eli Barton that there was no
suggestion anywhere of shady reasons for the sudden withdrawal of
the horse.</p>

<p>The Victorian owner was far too well known for that, and it
was realised everywhere there must be some very good reason why
Abimeleck was not to run, and the only query was&mdash;what was
it?</p>

<p>But no definite answer was forthcoming, and, reconciling
themselves to the inevitable, most people had soon given up
conjecturing, and for the moment were philosophically settling
down to make the best of things as they were.</p>

<p>And after all, there was no doubt that the absence of
Abimeleck made the race for the Christmas Cup, in some ways, a
much more interesting one.</p>

<p>Quite a fair number of the runners now undoubtedly had
chances, and no less than five of them were at once made almost
co-equal favourites in the totalisator.</p>

<p>The money began to pour into the machine.</p>

<p>With the betting settling down Gay Hussar began to advance
strongly in public favour&mdash;no doubt, however, because
Wilkie, the Adelaide crack, was riding him&mdash;and by the time
&pound;3000 had been invested he was leading by near &pound;100.
Next to him came Wattle Day, and then much farther away followed
Rattlesnake, The Bloater, and Lord Burke, all in a bunch. Quite
low down and almost neglected were Pretty Boy and Black Wolf. For
quite a long time the investments on the last-named totalled
under &pound;20.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch4"></a>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p class="first">THE weighing out was accomplished quickly, and
the candidates were soon parading before the stands. There were
eighteen runners, and not a few of them were as magnificent
specimens of the thoroughbred as one could wish to see.</p>

<p>Gay Hussar was now top weight, and, carrying nine stone two,
he led the procession. He was a fine, upstanding roan, and he
looked trained to the hour.</p>

<p>"There goes the winner," said a man on the rails as he passed
by. "He'll put paid to everything in the last hundred yards."</p>

<p>"Not he," said another man disdainfully. "He'll never last
with nine stone two in a fast run race, and old Rattlesnake'll
make the pace a cracker. You see if he doesn't with Muggins
up."</p>

<p>"Blow Muggins," returned the first man. "He's a bad finisher.
There's always too much jumping about when he starts using his
whip. He unbalances his mounts every time."</p>

<p>"Wattle Day'll win," remarked a woman. "It's a good thing
to-day, and they're trying. The milkman told my cook so,
thismorning."</p>

<p>There was a guffaw from those standing round, and the woman
got very red.</p>

<p>"Hullo," called out some one a moment later, "look at that one.
His jockey's got a handful there."</p>

<p>A big and unprepossessing black horse was just passing, and he
was evidently not appreciating the proximity of the crowd. He
edged along sideways, and kept showing the whites of his rather
evil-looking eyes. His jockey had got him hard held.</p>

<p>"That's Black Wolf," replied a horsey man, "trained by James
Dice, over near the Coorong."</p>

<p>"Well, he doesn't stand an earthly," remarked his friend, "and
yet I see they've got the cheek to declare six pounds
over-weight."</p>

<p>"So they have," said the horsey individual, glancing
thoughtfully upon his card. "Six thirteen, instead of six seven.
Now what does that mean, I wonder?" He looked up again and craned
his neck to get another view of the horse. "Well, I don't agree
with you, old man," he went on the next moment, "that he's got no
chance. From all his looks, he seems to me to have a darned good
chance. He's ugly for sure, and I don't like his forelegs, but
look at his long, deep quarters and the way he's muscled up. He's
workmanlike, and a stayer, and by cripes I'll have a dollar on
him, anyhow. He'll pay fifties if he'll pay a penny," and off the
speaker hurried towards the tote.</p>

<p>But the horsey-looking man was not by any means the only one
who was discussing the possibilities of Black Wolf.</p>

<p><br>
Two men on the trainers' stand, amongst others, were speaking
about them at that very moment.</p>

<p>"Anything in it, do you think, Fred?" asked one of them,
cocking his eye very shrewdly. "I asked Dice just now and he said
he'd got a tenner on him."</p>

<p>The other pursed his lips sceptically. "And that's about all
he could have, Bob," he replied. "I heard last month he was dead
broke and on the rocks. No, I don't think his brute is any good
at all in this company, although I admit I was a bit taken with
the look of him just now in the paddock."</p>

<p>"But I've heard rumours, I tell you, Fred," persisted the
other. "Months ago, I heard a tale that old man Dice had got a
rough 'un on his station quite out of the ordinary. He was
keeping it very dark, they said, but one day he was going to rip
everything up. Ugly as the devil his horse was, but could go like
the wind."</p>

<p>His friend shrugged his shoulders and smiled. "Well," he
remarked, "he would have hardly chosen to-day to bring off his
big trick, now would he? With Abimeleck running, he would have
known his chance was hopeless, and we all thought Abimeleck a
fairly certain runner, until up to a couple of hours ago. But
come on, we'll go and look at the tote."</p>

<p>The starting bell had just rung and the horses were preparing
to line up. The two men reached the totalisator building, in
front of which the usual crowd was thronging to watch the last
moments of the betting.</p>

<p>With the withdrawal of the great Abimeleck, it was undoubtedly
turning out to be a good race for speculation, and the figures on
the indicator were mounting briskly at every moment.</p>

<p>Already over &pound;8000 had been invested in the machine, and
Gay Hussar was now easily the first public choice. He carried
over &pound;1500. Next to him were Wattle Day with &pound;1235
and Lord Burke with just over a thousand. Rattlesnake had nearly
&pound;350 to his credit, and there was a big drop then to The
Wowser, with one hundred and five.</p>

<p>Right down at the bottom, &pound;35/10/ had been entrusted to
Black Wolf, and &pound;15 only to Pretty Boy.</p>

<p>"Look, Bob," laughed the man whom his companion had called
Fred. "If Black Wolf wins, James Dice will have the scoop of his
life. It'll pay not far off two hundred, I should say."</p>

<p>But the other was intently watching the crowd, and for the
moment it seemed he did not hear what his friend was saying.</p>

<p>Then he turned round suddenly. "I say," he said quickly. "I'm
going to have a fiver on Black Wolf, anyhow. No, I don't care
what you say," as the other laughed, "I'm going to have it on.
Look here," and he dropped his voice to an impressive whisper.
"I've just been watching Dice. There he is. Quick&mdash;standing
by that girl in the grey hat. Look at his face now, and look at
his sneering smile. I tell you, Fred, he's exactly like a man
who's keeping in some tremendous secret, and if he's only got a
tenner on as he says, I'll swear all the same he believes he's
going to win. I'm going to row in with him anyhow, on the chance.
So there now."</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool, Bob," said his companion contemptuously.
"Here, give me the fiver. I'll take on the bet."</p>

<p>"No, you don't, and I'm not a fool either. There's not a
better judge of a horse in all Australia than James Dice, and now
you just wait for me here while I go and put my fiver on."</p>

<p>They were not far from the &pound;5 window, and, his money
invested, the man was back again in less than a minute. His
friend was still standing where he had been left, and greeted his
return with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"I saw your fiver go up right enough," he remarked, "and it
makes &pound;40/10/ now on the brute,
but&mdash;hullo&mdash;hullo, what the devil's happening now?"</p>

<p>He pointed in astonishment to the totalisator index, and,
looking up, the other gasped in astonishment, too. The figures
above Black Wolf had suddenly become animated into a giddy whirl.
Up, up they went, one, two, five, ten, twenty, forty, fifty.</p>

<p>"Great Scot!" ejaculated the one who had taken the ticket.
"Someone's just put fifty on. Now, where's old Dice?"</p>

<p>But the question was never answered There was the clang of a
bell, a mighty shout&mdash;"They're off!" and everyone rushed to
get some point of vantage for the viewing of the race.</p>

<p><br>
The start had been an excellent one, and, whatever should
eventuate, there could certainly be no grumbling on that
score.</p>

<p>All had got away together, and for the first few yards it
almost seemed that they were running in a straight line. Then
Rattlesnake shot out his bony head in front, and, as the clever
ones had predicted, at once proceeded to make the pace a cracker.
Two furlongs from the start, and he was out a good three lengths
by himself, with the field already becoming an extended one. Gay
Hussar was running second, and his backers noticed with
satisfaction that he had secured a good position on the rails.
Close behind the favourite came a little group of four, with Lord
Burke the most prominent of these.</p>

<p>"Rattlesnake's going too fast," remarked a thin,
flashily-dressed woman in the front row of the grandstand. "I
never did like Muggins&mdash;he's got such ugly teeth."</p>

<p>"Hush, Mother," reprovingly whispered a young girl who looked
like her daughter. "Do be careful what you say."</p>

<p>"Well," insisted the thin woman obstinately. "He is riding
Rattlesnake very badly, and I wish to goodness your father had
never told us to back him. I'd have much rather had the
half-crown on Wattle Day."</p>

<p>Rattlesnake was still going like the wind, and with half of
the journey covered he was still in front. Wattle Day, however,
was not far behind him now, and, in the bunch of horses that
followed Gay Hussar was the most prominent, still running on the
rails. Several of the others, however, were also close up, with
the big Black Wolf lurching furtively along on the outside. The
latter's action was certainly not pretty, for he ran too low on
the ground to please most people, but his method of progression
was at any rate effective, and he reached out well with every
stride.</p>

<p>"Rattlesnake's tiring," said a man on the flat, peering
through an antiquated pair of glasses. "His jockey's moving on
him with his hands."</p>

<p>"I like Gay Hussar as well as anything," said another. "So
far, at any rate. Wilkie's had an arm-chair ride."</p>

<p>All this while young Stanley Barton had been standing at the
back of the grandstand, but mechanically only was he taking in
the incidents of the race. He was much too worried about his
uncle to be really concerned as to what was happening on the
course and, in a bored, indifferent sort of way, he was idly
taking stock of the people near him. Suddenly his eyes fell upon
the girl whom he had seen with the owner of Black Wolf. She was
only a few yards from him, and instantly he was interested. For
some reason, she vibrated some strange chord in him. She was
certainly very pretty. Looking about one or two and twenty, she
was of medium height, with a well rounded and beautifully
proportioned figure. She had fine, clear-cut features and a
wealth of rich, dark brown hair. Her eyes, he thought, were
lovelier than any he had ever seen.</p>

<p>He meditatively regarded the man who stood with her, the man
who owned Black Wolf, and the latter struck him at once as of an
unusual personality. He was tall and fine looking, with a strong,
self-reliant pose. The face was handsome, but marred a little by
a certain hardness and contemptuous arrogance of expression. He
looked like a man who would always have a good opinion of
himself, and be always quite confident that his ideas were the
only ones to be considered.</p>

<p>Young Barton wondered rather jealously what was the nature of
the man's relation to the girl, and his query was, in part,
answered almost at once.</p>

<p>The girl put up a shapely little hand to adjust her hat. The
hand was her left one and it was ungloved. She wore neither
wedding nor engagement ring.</p>

<p>The young man smiled to himself, but in whatever channel his
thoughts might then have wandered they were turned back suddenly
to the happenings on the course.</p>

<p>A great storm of shouting had arisen, for the race was now
approaching its critical stage. The horses were well into the
straight for home, and to the great joy of his supporters it was
seen that the favourite was leading, well in front.</p>

<p>For the moment it seemed actually that he was coming home
alone, but by the one furlong post he began to falter, and in a
few yards three horses flashed up level with him, almost
simultaneously together. They were Wattle Day, Lord Burke, and
the early pace-maker, Rattlesnake&mdash;the last, to the great
surprise of many, now coming great guns again.</p>

<p>"Wattle Day wins," roared the crowd. "No, its Rattlesnake.
Good old Rattlesnake; come on now."</p>

<p>But then, as so often upon the racecourse side, the unexpected
happened.</p>

<p>Something big and gaunt was seen to loom up on the
outside&mdash;a horse that came suddenly from nowhere and that no
one had considered before. A low-running, black animal that was
going twice as fast as anything and galloping like the wind.</p>

<p>"Why, it's Black Wolf!" roared a man in amazement, "and he'll
win as he likes."</p>

<p>And there was no doubt about it. Black Wolf was running like a
racehorse incarnate.</p>

<p>He passed Gay Hussar and Wattle Day almost as if they were
standing still; he shook off Lord Burke in a couple of strides,
and, when the gallant Rattlesnake, for just one fraction of a
second, seemed to hold him, his jockey lifted his whip once, and
the tiring son of Venom was left instantly behind.</p>

<p>The farther Black Wolf ran the farther he was in front, and he
passed the judge's box, hard held, three lengths to the good. The
amazed crowd just gasped in their surprise.</p>

<p>"By jove," swore one disgusted owner under his breath, "but
what a certainty to bet on if we had only known."</p>

<p>In their astonishment the crowd seemed at first quite unable
to take it in, and then with envious faces they thronged round
the totalisator, curious to see what dividends the horses would
pay.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch5"></a>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p class="first">VERY quickly the totalisator figures came up:
Black Wolf &pound;63/17/, Rattlesnake &pound;5 (for each pound
invested). &pound;8740 had altogether been invested on the race.
&pound;90/10/ had gone on Black Wolf, and &pound;382/10/on
Rattlesnake.</p>

<p>The owner of Black Wolf came down off the grandstand looking
unruffled and unconcerned. He smiled when he was congratulated,
and when asked if he had expected Black Wolf to win he replied
inscrutably: "Well, I thought he was pretty good."</p>

<p>But the girl with him, it was easy to see, was greatly
excited. She was flushed and animated, and coming suddenly face
to face with her, young Barton thought again, with a strangely
quickening pulse, how delightfully pretty she was.</p>

<p>He was with Sellick, the trainer, and the latter stopped at
once to congratulate James Dice.</p>

<p>"I hope you had a good win, Jim. Your gelding ran a splendid
race."</p>

<p>The owner of Black Wolf smiled pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Not so bad, old man, thank you," he replied, "but it was
perhaps a good thing for me Abimeleck wasn't there."</p>

<p>"You can bet your life on that," said Tom Sellick, looking
very serious, "for, however good your animal is, I don't think
the forty odd pounds Abimeleck had to give him would have brought
the two together, and young Mr. Barton here will, I am sure,
agree with me."</p>

<p>"Introduce me, Sellick," broke in Stanley, smiling. "I have
not met this fortunate gentleman yet."</p>

<p>"This is Mr. Stanley Barton, Jim," began the trainer, "Mr.
Eli's nephew. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But old Sellick stopped, for he saw that James Dice was not
listening. The owner of Black Wolf had turned right round and he
was staring hard into the crowd. He had suddenly become pale, and
it looked almost as if he were trying to master some great
emotion.</p>

<p>"Uncle, uncle!" exclaimed the girl at his side in a reproving
tone, "don't you hear? This gentleman is speaking to you," and
she pulled him by the arm.</p>

<p>The big man turned round instantly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I beg your pardon," he apologised in confusion, "I'm so
very sorry, but I recognised a man just then whom I had believed
was dead. It gave me quite a shock." He passed his hand shakily
across his forehead. "But you were saying&mdash;you were
saying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I was introducing you to Mr. Stanley Barton," replied the
trainer, smiling, "Mr. Eli Barton's nephew."</p>

<p>James Dice shot a quick glance at young Barton, and then
lifted his hat politely. "Very pleased, I am sure." He went on
speaking rapidly. "And this is my niece, Miss Bevan. Margaret,
this is Mr. Sellick." He smiled quite easily now&mdash;"I knew
him years ago in Victoria, before I came over here."</p>

<p>The girl shook hands with Mr. Sellick and young Stanley, and
the four stood chatting for some minutes.</p>

<p><br>
Young Stanley had his eyes the whole time upon the girl, and a
slight flush seemed to deepen the radiancy of her face when at
length they said good-bye.</p>

<p>"Very decent fellow, that Dice," remarked the trainer,
directly they were out of earshot, "and I'm glad his horse won.
But I don't suppose he's got much out of it, except the stake.
The dividend was too large for any one to have helped himself
liberally. He couldn't have had much hope of his horse anyhow,
and I expect Black Wolf's win was just one of those flukes that
come to racing men, sometimes. They've had a cast-iron certainty
in their hands, and yet they've not known it, until too
late."</p>

<p>Trainer Sellick was quite convinced that he had sized up the
situation pretty accurately, and undoubtedly for the first few
minutes after the race the public generally held much the same
opinion.</p>

<p>The outsider's win was quite unexpected, they told one
another, and the owner-trainer had had only a few pounds on. He
had missed the chance of a life-time and would be kicking himself
about it until the very day that he died. It had been a 'skinner'
too, for the city bookmakers; none of them, probably, had ever
had Black Wolf's name in his books.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;somehow these ideas began all at once to
undergo a subtle change, and very quickly quite different notions
took possession of the knowing ones upon the course.</p>

<p>No, it had not been an unexpected win, they now said. The
owner had gone solidly for his animal, and nearly all the money
paid out from the totalisator had been on his investment alone.
He had been seen himself drawing nearly &pound;5000 in notes from
the paying-out window.</p>

<p>Rumours swept round like eddies in a stream, and then surmises
began to crystallise out into solid facts.</p>

<p>Black Wolf had been heavily backed away from the course, and
the city bookmakers had been hard hit. In fact, they had been
most methodically tapped all round. Pete Maloney, the biggest
bookmaker in the State, admitted it frankly and without any
ill-feeling. He said so openly on the grandstand. It was true, he
explained, that not large sums had been invested on Black Wolf
but, at the odds offered against the horse on the previous day
quite a small bet would soon have taken all the stuffing out of
any turf accountant's book. He himself had given James Dice a
thousand to ten, and taken the bet twice, while his friend,
Walter Hind, had been let in for exactly the same amount.</p>

<p>The owner of Black Wolf, moreover, had shown himself a great
strategist in placing his commissions. The previous afternoon, it
appeared, he had approached bookmaker after bookmaker, and had
secured bets with them all. None of his wagers was for a large
amount, such was the cleverness of his plan, but he had been laid
the odds to tens and fives and in some cases even to only threes
and twos. Nearly always he had been accommodated at a hundred to
one, and he had betted fearlessly, making no place bets but going
always for an outright win.</p>

<p>The racing crowd generally, with their first disappointment
over, were intensely interested in the big coup that had
seemingly been brought off and, although all losers themselves,
they were not chary of expressing their admiration for the pluck
that the owner of Black Wolf had shown.</p>

<p>"A mad thing to do, though," remarked a prominent racing man
scornfully, "but a devilish plucky one all the same. Just fancy
going like that for an outright win, with Abimeleck in the
acceptances! Dice must have been off his chump at the time."</p>

<p><br>
But long before the afternoon had waned people were not quite
so sure that James Dice had indulged in so reckless a gamble as
had at first been assumed. A remarkable story began to get
about.</p>

<p>A man in the half-crown Derby enclosure, so it was said, had
had five pounds on Black Wolf. Quite a number of people had
watched him draw the dividend afterwards, and they had crowded
curiously round to find out what had made him back the horse.
But, at first, the man would offer no explanation and, beyond the
cock-sure assertion, many times repeated, that he had known all
the while that he was 'on a cert.' no one could get anything out
of him. A few long beers judiciously administered, however, had
soon loosened his tongue, and an interesting tale he had then
proceeded to tell. According to him, Black Wolf had been anything
but the despised and untried animal that people had imagined.
Instead, he had been put through as good a test as anyone could
wish, and he had been asked a very searching question before
being even entered for the Christmas Cup. He had beaten a no less
useful performer than the well known Basil's Pride, in a stripped
gallop over a mile and a half, with a stone the worse of the
weights, and everyone would remember that Basil had won the
Kidman Cup at the Port, not two months ago. Oh yes, the man
averred, he knew what he was talking about, and was quite as well
aware as anyone that Basil had been sold for fifteen hundred
guineas to Mr. French, of Melbourne. He knew that, but he knew
also what other people did not know, and that was that French was
a relation of James Dice and had lent him Basil for a week. The
horse when he had been sold had not been taken straight to
Melbourne, as people thought, but the journey had been broken
somewhere, he would not say where, and the trial he referred to
had then taken place. It had all been kept very secret, and
Basil's Pride had been altered in appearance, so that none of
Dice's station hands should recognise him. He had been hog-maned
for one thing, and the white marks on his forehead coloured out
for another. Oh, yes, it had all been beautifully arranged, and
they deserved every dollar they had won.</p>

<p>Such was the man's story, and much further interesting
information would doubtless have been elicited but for the
potency of more long beers. The narrator had then became
pugnacious, and, mainly, no doubt, to prevent his being robbed of
his winnings, a kind-hearted sergeant of police had shut him up
in the police room for the remainder of the afternoon.</p>

<p>The public were, of course, greatly interested, and a
representative of the Press endeavoured to get in touch with
James Dice and find out how much of the story was true. But the
owner of Black Wolf was nowhere to be encountered. He had left
the racecourse, so it was said, an hour before.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch6"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p class="first">THE following morning, with still no news
forthcoming of his uncle, or Sam Gover, Stanley Barton
interviewed the Chief Commissioner of the South Australian
Police, and, laying everything before him, asked that the
authorities should at once take some steps to find out where the
missing men were.</p>

<p>He insisted that, nothing having now been heard of them for
nearly three days, there appeared, under the peculiar
circumstances, to be a most sinister significance about their
silence.</p>

<p>He told the Commissioner how they had set out from Melbourne
en route for Adelaide on the previous Wednesday morning; how they
had arrived at Kingston on Thursday evening; how they had left
there again that night with the expressed intention of getting as
far as Meningie; how they had never been heard of at the latter
place, and how they had vanished as utterly as if the earth had
swallowed them up.</p>

<p>He emphasised the importance of his uncle's journey from
Melbourne, in view of the Christmas Cup in Adelaide on the
Friday, and how greatly his interest had, in all probability,
suffered by the withdrawal of his horse, Abimeleck, from the
race. He impressed upon the Commissioner that Eli Barton was a
most methodical man in all his actions, and he insisted that his
uncle's absence at the present juncture was in every respect
foreign to the latter's general mode of life.</p>

<p>The Commissioner had been at first inclined to treat the
matter very lightly, but the convincing way in which the young
man marshalled his facts soon moved the official to
thoughtfulness, and in the end, from the expression on his face,
he seemed to regard the matter in much the same light as his
visitor.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment when young Barton had finished,
and then the Chief Commissioner pulled a writing block before
him.</p>

<p>"You did quite right in coming to me, Mr. Barton," he said
gravely, "for the matter does not look healthy, I agree. But
let's get everything shipshape and see exactly how we stand." He
took up his pen. "Now you have already made every inquiry, you
say, as far as possible, to find out if they have stopped
anywhere on their way&mdash;I mean, of course, since leaving
Kingston?"</p>

<p>"I have almost lived on the telephone during the last
twenty-four hours," replied young Barton, "and have inquired in
every conceivable direction on the chance of anybody knowing
anything about them. But I can learn nothing&mdash;nothing at
all. Nothing has been seen or heard of them."</p>

<p>"Well, let us begin right at the beginning," said the
Commissioner. "Now, you yourself saw them start off from
Melbourne last Wednesday morning, and you know definitely, you
tell me, that they got as far as Kingston on Thursday
evening?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Stanley. "I saw them start off myself, and, as
I tell you, I followed with a friend exactly twenty four hours
after getting to Kingston in time for lunch on Friday. We had our
meal at the Hotel of the Broken Bough, and we learnt then that
they had dined there the previous evening. We were expecting they
would have called there in passing, for Helling, the proprietor
of the Broken Bough, is an old crony of ours, and in consequence
none of us ever goes through Kingston without pulling up to have
a word with him. He is a useful man to motorists, for he always
knows the conditions prevailing along the Coorong track."</p>

<p>"What time exactly did they leave the hotel, then, after
dinner on Thursday?" asked the Commissioner.</p>

<p>"Helling said it was just before ten," replied young
Barton.</p>

<p>"Well," went on the Commissioner, making a note, "they left
for the Coorong a little before ten on Thursday night, and that
is the last thing you have heard of them, the very last?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's the dreadful part of it." Young Barton spoke very
slowly. "They are known positively to have entered the Coorong
track, but no one ever saw them leave it. They left Kingston but
they never reached Meningie, and yet Meningie is the only outlet
from the track this end, the only way they could have come."</p>

<p>The Commissioner frowned. "But why are you so positive they
never reached Meningie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because," replied young Barton emphatically, "no one saw or
heard them. Their only way from the Coorong track lay right
through the township, and even in the dead of night no car could
have slipped by there without being noticed or heard by some one.
Nearly everyone was sleeping outside, and the hotel people there
have made exhaustive inquiries. Menzies himself, the hotel
proprietor, was sleeping out on his front veranda and, being a
very light sleeper, he is certain that he, for one, would have
heard them."</p>

<p>The Commissioner rose from his chair and attentively regarded
a large map of South Australia that was hanging on the wall.</p>

<p>"Hum!" he observed after a long pause. "Ninety-two miles from
Kingston to Meningie and, with the route to Keith impassable, no
turning off the main track the whole time. Therefore the track
along the lake from Kingston leads only to Meningie, and, once
upon it, a car can only go forward or go back." He turned round
to the young man.</p>

<p>"And I suppose there is no possibility of your uncle for some
reason having suddenly altered his mind and returned back towards
Melbourne?"</p>

<p>"None whatever," was the reply, "and if he'd wanted to he
couldn't have done it without its being known. The Broken Bough
at Kingston is right on the Coorong track, almost the last house,
in fact, and an eight-cylinder Jehu doesn't creep through a
township like a ghost. No, the car could no more have passed back
unnoticed through Kingston than it could have gone forward
unnoticed through Meningie.</p>

<p>"Their intention was, you say, to have slept at Meningie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Helling telephoned on for them to the hotel there,
saying they would probably arrive about two in the morning, and
their beds had been got ready for them."</p>

<p>"Didn't you find out then that they hadn't slept there, when
you yourself passed through Meningie, the next day?"</p>

<p>Young Barton shook his head. "Unfortunately," he relied, "we
didn't pull up. We came straight on to the city from Kingston
without a stop."</p>

<p>The Chief Commissioner took a different line.</p>

<p>"Does your uncle generally carry much money on him?"</p>

<p>"Well, always a fair amount when he goes racing. He supports
his own horses freely, and he likes betting through the
totalisator."</p>

<p>"I suppose it was well known in sporting circles, your uncle
being such a public character, that he was coming to Adelaide
last week?"</p>

<p>"Most certainly it was. It was mentioned in the Press and,
besides, all racing people know how he hardly ever races a horse
anywhere without himself being present to see it run. Last week,
especially, he was interested to see what his cup horse,
Abimeleck, would do."</p>

<p>"He often comes to Adelaide, doesn't he?" asked the
Commissioner.</p>

<p>"Yes, three or four times a year, at least."</p>

<p>"And it's well known he always comes in his car?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he never comes by train, except in very bad weather,
when the Coorong track was quite impassable."</p>

<p><br>
There was a long pause then, and the Commissioner went
carefully through his notes. Presently, however, he looked up and
intently took in the handsome face of the young fellow opposite
to him.</p>

<p>"Now look here, Mr. Barton," he said quietly. "As I take it,
the matter in a nutshell stands like this. Your uncle, a
well-known, well-to-do man, and probably carrying a good sum of
money with him, sets out on a six hundred mile motor journey and
is now, say, forty-eight hours late for an important engagement
here in the city. This in itself would not be in any way
significant, excepting for the peculiar circumstances surrounding
and ensuing upon his non-arrival. To take the latter first, he is
probably financially a great loser by his unpunctuality. His
horse was a non-runner for the Cup, and apart from the value of
the stake, if he had won, at any rate he has now to pay up for
all the antepost wagers that he may have made.</p>

<p>"These facts stand out plainly, and so we can assume,
therefore, as you say, that he would not lightly have broken his
engagement. Now touching one other set of circumstances:
Two-thirds of the six hundred mile journey are known to have been
accomplished safely. Then comes the mysterious part of the
affair. Your uncle enters upon the great Coorong track&mdash;a
blind alley except where Meningie is concerned. He enters it at
night. A long, lonely track, practically uninhabited throughout
its whole length. Not a hamlet or a township along the whole
eighty-odd miles and only a couple of sheep stations with their
boundaries any where near. I say, he enters on this road and
there&mdash;the story ends." The Commissioner bent forward over
his desk and his voice became very grave.</p>

<p>"Now, we may well ask what has happened to your uncle and his
friend. As you say, they can't have mistaken the way, for there
was only one track for them to follow. They can't have broken
down, for apart from your own journey on Friday, quite a score of
cars must have come along the Coorong during the daytime in the
last twenty-four hours." He shrugged his shoulders. "So, if they
didn't ever pass Meningie&mdash;then, what has happened to
them?"</p>

<p>There was again a silence and then the Commissioner spoke very
slowly. "Well, Mr. Barton," he said, "of course, we'll help you
all we can, and the matter shall be at once taken up officially,
as you wish." He smiled pleasantly. "Still, still, I'm not quite
convinced yet, I may tell you, that the car didn't pass through
Meningie. It's public knowledge, of course, that Mr. Eli Barton
is a man of masterful character and if he thought it good to
alter his plans in any way, then"&mdash;the Commissioner shrugged
his shoulders&mdash;"from all I have heard of him, he would do it
and be answerable for the consequences only to himself. However,"
and the Commissioner took up his pen again, "now give me, please,
most accurate descriptions of the car and the missing men. As I
say, I'll set everything going. In two hours every police station
in South Australia will have been notified and inquiries will be
pushed in every direction." He smiled again. "At any rate I'm
sanguine we'll have located the Jehu before evening, that is of
course if it's anywhere in South Australia and has not been
purposely hidden away. But keep in touch with me please from time
to time during the day so that I can give you the news speedily
if it comes along."</p>

<p>But no news came along, and the big Jehu was not located
anywhere, as the Commissioner had so hopefully expected. So the
following morning, just before noon, found Stanley Barton again
closeted with the head of the South Australian Police.</p>

<p>"It's no good denying it," the latter said ominously; "we're
up against something that requires explaining badly. The
inhabited parts of the whole State were combed thoroughly
yesterday." He shook his head. "But as I say, nothing about your
uncle was brought to light. One thing, however, we did learn.
What you told me yesterday about their having entered the Coorong
track from Kingston on Thursday night was confirmed. A rabbit
trapper camping four miles out from the township saw them passing
along the track soon after ten that night. At any rate, a big car
with two men in it passed him. He was asleep about a hundred
yards away from the track, but the noise awoke him, and he is
quite sure about there being two men in the car. Also, another
item of importance: One of the night nurses of the Meningie
Hospital was on duty on the front veranda all night, and she is
positive no car went by between midnight and eight o'clock. So
much for that, but now I want to ask you"&mdash;the Commissioner
looked keenly at young Barton&mdash;"who is this Mr. Gover who
was with your uncle?"</p>

<p>In spite of his anxiety Stanley smiled. "He is a very old
friend of my uncle, and they have known each other for over forty
years. He is about sixty-five years of age. As sane and
level-headed a man as you would meet anywhere, and, besides that,
a very rich man, too." Stanley spoke dryly. "So no suspicion on
that account, anyhow."</p>

<p>The Commissioner smiled in his turn. "Well, we have to know
everything," he remarked, "for our calling makes us naturally
suspicious of everyone." He became grave and decisive. "Now, we
must have the Coorong searched straight away, or as much of the
Coorong, I mean, as lays just off the track." He pointed to the
map of South Australia on the wall. "An army of soldiers could
hardly search all those miles of bush and desert. But, still, an
army of soldiers will not be needed, or, as I look at it, if your
uncle and his friend have come to any harm on the Coorong, the
Jehu car cannot be very far away. If it was diverted from the
track it would soon get held up somewhere by the gullies in the
sand." He leant over and touched a bell. "Now I'll introduce you
to Harker. He's one of the best detectives in this State, and,
luckily for us, knows the Coorong well. He was born in the
south-east. I'll send five other picked men with you, and a black
tracker, and they'll be ready in two hours. You'd better stop at
Meningie to-night and start in the Coorong directly morning
breaks. You've a big business before you, tackling those
ninety-two miles, and&mdash;" he shook his head
doubtfully&mdash;"I'm not certain you'll find anything, if,
indeed, there's anything to be found."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch7"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="first">FOR the ensuing two days the search party worked
energetically, but with no success, along the Coorong track. Bad
fortune met them at the very onset of their quest. A strong
southerly wind sprang up in the early hours of the first morning,
and, almost before light had come, sand was masking over
everything on the track. Wherever sand could gather, every mark
of every foot-fall and every wheel track was obliterated.</p>

<p>"There goes our greatest chance of marking any deviation from
the track," said Harker, the detective ruefully. "If they have
wandered from the track, we did at any rate stand some chance of
finding from where they started, before this blarmed wind came to
cover everything up."</p>

<p>Harker, the man whom the Chief Commissioner had spoken of as
knowing the Coorong, was in charge of the expedition, and it
annoyed young Barton that the detective from the very first
expressed himself as being in no way sanguine as to the success
of their search. Indeed, he seemed quite sceptical about the
whole business.</p>

<p>"You see, Mr. Barton," he said, "although I certainly agree,
after our inquiries on the spot last night in Meningie, that your
uncle and his friend probably never reached the township, still I
cannot bring myself to believe that they are now anywhere about
the Coorong at all." He shook his head emphatically. "No, I've
been over the Coorong scores and scores of times and, knowing it
as I do, I can't possibly imagine how anyone could have lost his
way here. With the track running close along the lake, you have
only to keep alongside the water and you're bound to go
right."</p>

<p>"I know all that, as well as you do," replied young Barton
sharply, "but I know also that my uncle was seen definitely to
enter the Coorong and there is no evidence that he ever left it.
Between here and Kingston something happened to them, and I
believe they are about the track still. Everything points to
it."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked the detective argumentatively, "they can't
have run into the lake, that's certain. There are no high,
overhanging banks anywhere, and the water is shallow wherever
they could possibly have gone over, all the way along the sides.
A car plunging in would be stopped dead by the mud long before it
could get into water deep enough to be covered up from
sight."</p>

<p>"I realise that," said Stanley. "It isn't on the lake side of
the road that we must look for them. It's on the other side away
from the water that they'll be."</p>

<p>The detective shrugged his shoulders. "And what chance do you
think we stand there?" he asked dubiously. "How shall we know
where their car first turned off the track into the sandhills or
the Ninety-Mile Desert? We must have a starting point, remember,
and think what a desolate place this is. Miles and miles of
sandhills and behind them more sand, and then miles and miles of
uninhabited bush. How are we to search a thousandth part of the
place?&mdash;and yet, until every part is gone through, the
search will be incomplete and we may anywhere be missing the
car." He dropped his voice sympathetically. "I don't want for a
moment to discourage you, sir, but I'm afraid you're building too
much on the certainty of finding them if they are here, and I'm
only pointing out the difficulties that face us."</p>

<p>But if the detective had only known it, there was nothing of
certainty in young Barton's mind. He was in a state of great
depression about everything now, although he was obsessed every
moment, as he had been from the very first, that among the dark
sandhills of the Coorong lay the secret of his uncle's fate.</p>

<p>For the first day, travelling very slowly, the search party
made their way along the whole length of the Coorong, reaching
Kingston only just as night had fallen. It had been a very tiring
day for all. In accordance with a settled plan they had stopped
continuously and had searched diligently for any sign of a car
having left the track.</p>

<p>But no success had in any way rewarded their efforts, and the
farther they proceeded the more apparent became the uncertainty
of their quest.</p>

<p>As Harker had said, they had no definite starting point. If,
for some unexplainable reason, the big Jehu had been deliberately
driven off away from the track&mdash;then, until they were able
to determine the exact point from where the car had started upon
its clandestine journey, it was sheer madness to leave the track
anywhere haphazard, on the million to one chance that the missing
trail could be picked up in a blindfold and happy-go-lucky sort
of way.</p>

<p>Young Barton had come to realise this fully before they had
gone many miles upon their journey, and, by the time they reached
Kingston, he frankly admitted to the detective that he was almost
as pessimistic as the former himself as to the ultimate result of
the search.</p>

<p>"But still," he went on doggedly, "they must be here. You
heard what we were told at Meningie this morning&mdash;that night
or day no car could pass through the township without its being
seen, and you heard them say over and over again that no car came
through after midnight on Thursday. Now you'll hear what the
people tell us at Kingston and then make of the two stories what
you can."</p>

<p>With the arrival of the party at the hotel of the Broken
Bough, the proprietor was put through a most searching
cross-examination by the detectives, but he was positive to the
point of anger that Eli Barton had gone on the Meningie road, and
he laughed to scorn any idea that the car could by any
possibility have doubled back and returned towards Melbourne in
the night.</p>

<p>"Impossible," he said roughly. "Why, everyone sleeps outside
on these hot nights, and I and all the family are out on the
front verandah here, right over the road. Not even a dog could go
by without some of us hearing him, let alone a big Jehu car," and
he snorted in disgust.</p>

<p>"Tell me, Mr. Helling," asked Harker presently, when for a
moment he had got the proprietor alone. "What do you make of this
business? I tell you honestly I didn't think much of it yesterday
when we left the city, but after what I've heard, first at
Meningie and now here from you. I admit I'm beginning to feel a
bit puzzled. What could have happened to them, do you think?"</p>

<p>The landlord regarded his questioner with troubled eyes. He
looked round to make sure that they were alone, and then put his
mouth close near to the detective's ear.</p>

<p>"I don't like it at all," he whispered, "but I haven't told
young Barton so. I believe some evil's happened to them. I had a
long talk with the Meningie people over the 'phone to-day.
Menzies, the landlord there, is a friend of mine and a very
shrewd fellow. He'll stake his life the car never reached
Meningie, and upon my soul I believe him. He was out on his front
verandah, just like I was all night long, and he swears the car
couldn't possibly have gone by."</p>

<p>"Then what the devil has happened?" asked the detective with a
frown&mdash;"if they're still on the Coorong, where are
they?"</p>

<p>The landlord shook his head. "I believe they're dead," he said
seriously. "I can think of nothing else."</p>

<p>"And why?" said the detective brusquely. "Who'd want to kill
them?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch8"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Detective Harker brusquely asked the
landlord of the hotel at Broken Bough who would want to kill
Barton and Gover, the landlord shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Eli Barton was a rich man," he said stubbornly, "and his
habits were well known. Anyone would guess he'd be carrying a bit
of money with him, and he'd be worth holding up, any night."</p>

<p>"But who was going to know, man," asked the detective sharply,
"that they would be taking the Coorong track, at night. You
yourself told us just now that they said they only made up their
minds at midday on Thursday."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the landlord nodding his head, "I've thought of
that point right enough." He looked at the detective rather
contemptuously. "But who would know? Why, lots of people might
have known, of course. The telephone people had been informed,
and anyone in the bar here may have heard me talking on the
'phone. Anyone, too, may have caught the message at the other end
at Meningie." He shook his head in scorn. "There are always
plenty of ears about when the telephone's being used, and some one
may have accidentally picked up the information and then got
ready to act on it at once." He shrugged his shoulders. "Yes,
they've both probably been murdered, and the Jehu's been driven
off and hidden somewhere in the sandhills or among the scrub. I
hope to blazes I'm not right, but I know I've never felt easy at
any time when I've seen old Barton going that way alone."</p>

<p>The two men continued to discuss the matter, and in the end
the landlord's misgiving undoubtedly in part communicated
themselves to the detective, for when the party left the township
the next morning upon their return journey he was most
sympathetic in his attitude towards young Barton.</p>

<p><br>
The return search was conducted upon much the same lines as
upon the previous day, except that upon several occasions the
party explored much deeper among the sandhills.</p>

<p>But, as before, they met with no success at all, and darkness
found them, dispirited and disheartened, returning to
Adelaide.</p>

<p>Hoping against hope, Stanley looked for news upon their
arrival in the city, but beyond the information that the mystery
of his uncle's disappearance was now public property, there was,
unhappily, nothing to record.</p>

<p>The next day the matter was the sole topic of conversation
everywhere, and the newspapers made every effort to ensure that
their readers were duly informed as to everything that was taking
place.</p>

<p>There was no need, however, for secrecy, and, realising the
help that the Press might possibly give him, young Stanley made a
candid avowal of all the anxiety he was in.</p>

<p>In an interview with a representative of the Times of Adelaide
he explained exactly what had happened, and emphatically gave it
as his opinion that it seemed now only possible to explain his
uncle's disappearance by foul play.</p>

<p>The public were generally of the same opinion, too, and as day
upon day went by without any news coming to hand, uncomplimentary
references were made everywhere as to the capacity of the South
Australian police.</p>

<p>Two men certainly, the public commented, might easily be
murdered, and their bodies hidden away. Dreadful as the idea was,
yet that could be readily understood in the knowledge of the
sparsely inhabited condition of many parts of South Australia,
but for a motor car to get hidden, and a huge, uncommon car like
a Jehu at that&mdash;well, at any rate some explanation was
required there. A car had more or less all the time to keep to
roads and tracks, and surely something ought to have been
discovered when it was known fairly accurately where it had been
last seen.</p>

<p>The Commissioner of the Police swore under his breath, and
wondered angrily how many of his critics had been near the
Coorong.</p>

<p>A Government aeroplane from Seaton Park was brought into
requisition, and for two days, at some little risk to the
aviator, it cruised low down, backwards and forwards, over the
Ninety-Mile Desert, but nothing eventuated, and no sign of the
missing car was seen.</p>

<p>So was everything in complete darkness until the Saturday
morning, and then suddenly light came.</p>

<p>It came in a horrible and ghastly manner, and a shudder
rippled through the great Commonwealth of Australia.</p>

<p>The big Jehu car was found, with the dead body of Eli Barton
in it, and it was known that the old man had been murdered.</p>

<p>The discovery was made in this way:</p>

<p>Two young clerks from the Bank of Adelaide were holidaying in
the Coorong, and in a small boat had set out to sail down the
whole length of the lake. Taking things easily and amusing
themselves by fishing as they went along, they had pulled up the
boat each evening and camped out upon the sands.</p>

<p>The third day out from Goolwa, towards noon, they found
themselves about mid-way across the lake. And the wind suddenly
dropping altogether, rather than take to the oars in the
oppressive heat, they decided to land and explore among the
sandhills on the chance of getting a rabbit or two for the
evening meal.</p>

<p>Accordingly, they pulled their boat well up and, taking their
rifles with them, set out upon a voyage of discovery.</p>

<p>Their progress was slow, for they soon tired in the heavy
going. One minute they would be in a deep gully and the next they
would be toiling laboriously up the slope of a miniature
mountain, with their feet always ankle deep in the yielding
sand.</p>

<p>Presently they sat down to rest on the summit of one of the
hummocks.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, one of them rose interestedly to his feet.
"Now, what's that over there?" he asked quickly&mdash;"something
bright that keeps on catching the sun. On the other side of that
gully, over to the left."</p>

<p>His companion looked in the direction indicated and then he,
too, stood up at once.</p>

<p>"Funny!" he ejaculated, "but it looks like the radiator of a
motor car." There was a moment's silence and then he burst out.
"And, by Jove, I believe it is." His voice rose to a delighted
shout. "Come on, quick. Here's something interesting at
last."</p>

<p>All thoughts of their fatigue forgotten, they raced down the
hummock side and very quickly were within a few yards of the
object that had caught their eyes.</p>

<p>Then one of them clutched the other by the arm. "It's a car
that's been drifted over by the sand," he said hoarsely, his
voice trembling, "and there's somebody dead there, too."</p>

<p>They both halted, and, with frightened faces, stared into each
other's eyes.</p>

<p>A dreadful taint was borne towards them on the air.</p>

<p>"Eli Barton!" came an awed whisper. "The two missing men."</p>

<p>A moment's hesitation and they fearfully approached nearer.
There was no doubt about it. A big car lay in front of them, but
three parts of it were buried in the sand. Against the back and
all one side the sand was piled higher than the hood. The wheels
and running boards were all covered over, and even on the exposed
side of the car only the very tops of the mudguards were
discernable.</p>

<p>Holding their breath, they peeped into the car, and then both,
as with one movement, darted back.</p>

<p>A man's leg was protruding from the sand that nearly filled
the tonneau.</p>

<p>The faces of the two boys went chalk-white in horror and,
under the burning sun, they shivered. For the first time in their
lives they were in the presence of Death, and the dread majesty
of it struck at them like a blow.</p>

<p>"But why did they bring the car here?" whispered one. "And how
did they come to die? They must have gone mad or else"&mdash;his
voice trailed away almost to nothing&mdash;"or else, they were
murdered."</p>

<p>For a minute neither of them spoke, and then the elder
gathered his wits together.</p>

<p>"Well, it's no good our touching anything," he said huskily.
"We must go and get help. We must get back to the boat."</p>

<p>Climbing breathlessly upon a high sandhill to get their
bearings, they debated in jerky sentences what they must do. That
they must get in touch with the police at once was the one idea
in their minds, but the difficulty was&mdash;how were they going
to do it?</p>

<p>It was nearly forty long miles along the track to Meningie,
and to return to Goolwa along the lake, as they had come, would
take the best part of two days.</p>

<p>Then another idea seized them. They would wait where they were
until some motorist came along. The Melbourne&mdash;Adelaide
track, they knew, ran by the edge of the lake, and no car could
pass by except within a few yards of where their boat was drawn
up. There was some risk, of course, in waiting for anyone coming,
but they reckoned that at that season of the year some one would
be sure to pass by long before the time when they could reach
Meningie on their own.</p>

<p>So, confident that they were doing the right thing, they put
up their tent, and proceeded to wait with what patience they
could for help.</p>

<p>But it was a weary and trying afternoon that followed.</p>

<p>The heat got worse and worse, and, after a scrappy and
unrelished meal, discarding everything but their hats, they
reclined in more or less discomfort in the hot and shallow water
at the edge of the lake. Towards five o'clock, and just when they
were beginning to despair of anyone coming along that evening, to
their almost frenzied delight they heard the unmistakable
<i>chug-chug</i> of a motor bicycle coming from the direction of
Kingston.</p>

<p>Hastily throwing on a few garments, with palpitating hearts
they placed themselves in the middle of the track so that by no
chance could they possibly be unseen.</p>

<p><br>
A motor bicycle appeared round the bend and with one accord
they waved frantically for it to stop.</p>

<p>A moment's hesitation and the rider pulled up. He kept his
distance however. He was a tall, spare man, and he was heavily
goggled.</p>

<p>"Well, what do you want?" he asked sharply. "What's up?"</p>

<p>"There's a motor car with a dead body in it," called out one
of the clerks, "just over in the sandhills here, and we think
it's Mr. Eli Barton. It's a Jehu car."</p>

<p>The man took off his goggles. He showed a keen alert face and
he frowned.</p>

<p>"What is it, you say," he asked, "a dead body? Where?"</p>

<p>The clerks told him and related shortly how they had chanced
upon the car. "But who are you?" asked the man brusquely.</p>

<p>"We are officers of the Bank of Adelaide," replied one of the
clerks, "and we are on holiday here. That is our boat there and
we came along the lake from Goolwa."</p>

<p>The stranger kicked the stand under his motor bicycle and
proceeded methodically to take off his gloves. He smiled
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"Well, your luck's in for once, young men," he said, "for I
happen myself to be a doctor. Dr. Stark, of Meningie, at your
service. Lead the way and we'll soon see what your find is. About
half a mile, you say?"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch9"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p class="first">WALKING quickly this time, in a few minutes they
reached the derelict car, and with none of the qualms that the
young men had exhibited, the doctor proceeded at once to make an
investigation.</p>

<p>"Hum," he remarked, "quite right&mdash;a Jehu car and our
friend inside has been dead a good many days, I should say. Now,
let's see a little more of him. No, you needn't help. Keep away;
I'm used to such things."</p>

<p>Quickly, but with great care, he scooped away the sand from
inside the tonneau and in a few seconds there came into view
first the trunk and then the head and face of the dead man.</p>

<p>"Whew!" whistled the doctor, "not pretty to look at certainly,
and&mdash;ah! a wound. A bullet wound or I'm much mistaken. A
hole in the middle of the forehead." He spoke very gravely. "This
man was murdered, my lads, and by all tokens, as you guessed,
he's the missing Eli Barton." His eyes searched quickly round.
"But there were two of them lost, and where's the other body." He
shook his head. "But no; it's no good our getting busy. We'll
leave everything now to the police." He took out his watch.
"Nearly half-past five. Well, ten minutes back to my motor
bicycle and then, say an hour and three-quarters to get to
Meningie. By 7.30 the police will have been notified in Adelaide,
and by midnight&mdash;&mdash;" he shrugged his shoulders. "No,
you mustn't expect them at all to-night. The darkness would be no
good to them, and so you'll have to keep your vigil by yourselves
until the morning. Go back to your tent, boys, and don't think
too much about this poor chap here. To-morrow you'll be
famous."</p>

<p>It was a troubled night then for the two young officers of the
Bank of Adelaide, and, when the scanty moon came up, to the
fervid imagination of youth the silvered sands of the Coorong
were peopled everywhere with ghosts of the murdered dead.</p>

<p>Hour after hour the boys sat huddled and dry-eyed in their
tent, and it was not until dawn was almost breaking that they
sank into a fitful sleep. Then, hardly had they closed their
eyes, it seemed, when they were awakened by the roar of a big
motor car, and two minutes later big, burly police officers were
questioning them before their tent.</p>

<p>Three cars in all arrived, the last one being driven by a
white-faced young man, whom they learned later was the nephew of
Eli Barton.</p>

<p>Then followed a hurried procession through the sandhills, a
silent grouping round the derelict car, and a few words whispered
as some of them looked inside.</p>

<p>Then a cry of fury came, a cry of dreadful anger that ended in
a sob.</p>

<p>Stanley Barton had identified his uncle, and the murder of the
old man was established without doubt.</p>

<p><br>
Two days later and all that was known as to the murder of Eli
Barton was made public, and in the subsequent twenty-four hours
the Commonwealth generally was treated to a perfect orgy of
sensationalism.</p>

<p>Not only was everything told of the finding of the car and the
body, but the authorities made no secret either of their opinion
as to what had become of the other missing man.</p>

<p>The latter had been murdered, too, they were quite sure, but
they were frankly puzzled, they admitted, at not finding any
trace of the body. They never gave a moment's credence, however,
to the idea that sprang at once to many minds that it was Sam
Gover who had murdered his friend and was now in consequence
hiding himself away.</p>

<p>Apart from the great improbability of Sam Gover having
suddenly gone out of his mind and shot his friend&mdash;and that
would be the only explanation for his taking on the role of
murderer&mdash;there were other things that stood out sharply to
negative entirely the entertainment of any such idea.</p>

<p>To begin with, Sam Gover was an old man and built rather on a
small scale, whereas Eli Barton was big and heavy, and weighed
over fifteen stone. It was quite impossible, therefore, the
police considered, for any but a very strong man to have lifted
the body of Eli Barton and deposited it in the position in which
it was found upon the floor of the car. It had been thrown into
the tonneau head downward, and with such violence that one of the
fittings of the foot-rest had deeply indented the top of the
skull. Also, there was one very significant thing to be noticed
upon the back cushion of the car. There was evidence of much more
blood there than could be accounted for by the presence of the
body of Eli Barton on the floor of the tonneau.</p>

<p>The medical evidence was that Eli Barton had been killed by a
revolver bullet of large calibre, that he had died instantly, and
that from the very manner of his death there would have been very
little haemorrhage from the wound. The heart would have ceased
functioning instantly, and there would have been no great gush of
blood from the ruptured vessels of the brain.</p>

<p>But upon the back cushions had been found quite a quantity of
blood, proving that a wounded and not a dead man had been lying
there. Also there were blood-stains across the top of the
door-side, as if a bleeding body had been dragged over it.</p>

<p>So the idea of Sam Gover having any complicity in the murder
of his friend had never been entertained, and strenuous efforts
had been made to discover a second body in the vicinity if the
derelict car.</p>

<p>A whole army of detectives had been rushed down to the Coorong
and, working with the energy of a pack of hounds, they had dug
and probed in every likely-looking place within several hundred
yards of the car.</p>

<p>But nothing had eventuated, and in due time they had been all
withdrawn back to the city and the Coorong left as lonely and as
silent as before.</p>

<p>The tragedy, however, still continued to occasion tremendous
sensation, the uppermost feeling being everywhere one of intense
indignation that such a ghastly crime should have been committed
and the perpetrator allowed to get clear away.</p>

<p>On the fourth day, following upon the discovery of the body of
Eli Barton, the special Commissioner of the Times of Adelaide,
returning from a tour of investigation in the Coorong, gave it
reluctantly as his opinion that, in all human probability, the
perpetrators of the murder would now never be discovered. They
had had too long a time of immunity, he considered, and
everything had been in their favour to enable them to cover up
their traces and escape.</p>

<p>He doubted also that the body of Eli Barton's companion would
ever be found either.</p>

<p>He pointed out the vastness of the wilderness of the Coorong,
and he dwelt forcibly on the silence and loneliness of these
great waste spaces that might hide, untroubled, a thousand guilty
secrets and, like the shark-infested seas of Australasia, never
give up their dead.</p>

<p><br>
The article in the Times of Adelaide made a great impression,
but within twenty-four hours of its appearance one part, at
least, of the Commissioner's prophecy was proved to be
untrue.</p>

<p>Sam Gover was produced alive and very much in the flesh.</p>

<p>The first intimation, strangely enough, came from Mr. James
Dice, the owner of Black Wolf. He 'phoned up to the Adelaide
police, from his sheep station, Mundulla, about fifteen miles
distant from Meningie.</p>

<p>Six days before, one of his boundary riders, he told them, had
come across a man wandering in the bush. The man was in the last
stages of exhaustion and, almost delirious, could give no account
of himself. He was on the verge of starvation, and was suffering
also from injuries to his side and right arm.</p>

<p>The boundary rider had carried the man to his hut, and so
serious had been the latter's condition that for a while he had
been afraid to leave him and make for the station to obtain
help.</p>

<p>Ultimately, however, the man had been brought in a waggon to
the station, and with due care and attention he had revived and
been enabled to tell his story.</p>

<p>To everyone's amazement he had then made himself known as Sam
Gover, the companion of the ill-starred Eli Barton, and ample
proof was immediately to hand that he was speaking the truth.</p>

<p>Again there was a lightning exodus of the heads of the police
to Meningie, and then, there being as before no occasion for
secrecy, Gover's story was very quickly made known. And an
extraordinary and almost incredible one at first it was.</p>

<p>Eli Barton had been held up and murdered in a style and manner
in every way reminiscent of the wild days of the early
sixties.</p>

<p>Sam Gover had seen him shot down before his very eyes, and he
himself had been wounded twice, experiencing, the latter time, an
almost miraculous escape from death.</p>

<p>Without the slightest doubt whatever, the two travellers had
fallen into a carefully prepared and arranged ambush.</p>

<p>They had left Kingston, Sam Gover said, on the Thursday
evening, and for a while everything had gone well. The night had
been terribly hot, and not a breath of air had been stirring
anywhere. Just as they were passing the twelfth milestone he
remembered he was almost on the point of dropping to sleep, and
after that nothing more seemed to happen until he had been
suddenly awakened by the abrupt stopping of the car.</p>

<p>Eli Barton had pulled up because there had suddenly appeared
on the road in front of them a man waving a light.</p>

<p>Approaching the car, the man had called out that there had
been an accident just round the near hummock of sand, and he had
warned them not to bring their own car any farther because the
track was blocked.</p>

<p>At once Eli Barton and he had got out of the car and,
following the man with the light, they had hurried towards the
spot where the supposed accident had taken place.</p>

<p>There, to their surprise, they had seen no sign of any
accident at all. The place was not blocked, and there was only
one car, standing back off the track and away in the shadows.</p>

<p>They had at once become suspicious that something was wrong,
and Eli Barton had tried to seize hold of the man who had waved
the light. But the man had dropped his lantern and dashed away,
and a second later Eli Barton himself had been shot down by some
one who was firing from behind the stationary car.</p>

<p>Realising instantly the murderous nature of the attack that
was being launched against them, Sam Gover had drawn his
automatic and had succeeded, he was sure, in at least wounding
one of their assailants.</p>

<p>Then he had thrown himself prone upon the sand to make as
small a mark as possible for the man with the revolver behind the
car, but the latter had suddenly switched on the car lights, and,
exposed in the glare, Sam Gover had speedily been hit twice.</p>

<p>The first time a bullet had passed through the fleshy part of
his right arm, and the second time he had been struck in the
side. The second bullet, however, had almost missed him, but it
had ploughed a furrow about four inches in length in his thigh
and had occasioned considerable loss of blood.</p>

<p>All he remembered then was falling on his back, with
everything fading away.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch10"></a>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="first">SAM GOVER told the police that he had no idea
how long it was before he became conscious again, but he dimly
remembered being carried somewhere in a car and then being flung
out violently on to the sand.</p>

<p>When he seemed to wake up fully again the sun was high in the
sky and, everything coming back to him, he had tried to find his
way on to the road. But he was hopelessly lost, and, all efforts
to find it proving futile for three days and nights he had
wandered despairingly in the bush with death facing him nearer
and nearer every hour.</p>

<p>Then, just when he was finally giving up all hope, he had been
found by the boundary-rider of Mr. Dice and in great suffering
from his thirst and his wounds, had lost consciousness again.</p>

<p>Such was his story, and there was no doubt, from the
subsequent medical examination, that, as with the murdered Eli
Barton, his injuries had been occasioned by a revolver bullet of
large size.</p>

<p>Questioned as to what the men who had attacked him were like,
although he had a lively recollection of everything that had
taken place as long as he was conscious, unhappily he could throw
very little light indeed upon the personalities of their
assailants.</p>

<p>About the man who had been firing with the revolver he could
say absolutely nothing at all, for he had never once caught a
glimpse of him. About the other man, however, the man with the
lantern who had acted as the decoy, he could certainly give a
little more information. He described him as being thin and
rather small and spare; also the man had seemed hesitating in his
manner and slow of speech. Of the facial appearance, however, he
could say nothing.</p>

<p>The revelations of Sam Gover created something almost like
consternation in not a few parts of South Australia. There was on
all sides an uneasy feeling that the ambush and the murder were
the work of a criminal gang, and people in lonely and outlying
parts of the State began to ask themselves how soon it would be
before their turn to be attacked became due.</p>

<p>They asked one another, too, what the police were doing to
discover the murderers, and they gave it as their opinion that
the matter was too complicated and too involved for the Adelaide
authorities alone. The Commonwealth, generally, should be
consulted, they insisted, and help obtained from the Melbourne
and Sydney police.</p>

<p><br>
And then the obsession began suddenly to get about everywhere
that one man in particular should be called in, namely Larose,
the great detective of New South Wales.</p>

<p>Larose, it was declared, was the man to solve the mystery.
Larose had never been beaten yet. He was a master of every trick
of the underworld, and a very prince among the trackers of
crime.</p>

<p>But, unhappily, it appeared, the services of Larose were not
available, for barely a month previously, following upon a
disagreement with a high official, he had severed all connection
with the police.</p>

<p>The public were greatly disappointed, for, with his many
successes behind him, Gilbert Larose was in their eyes almost a
hero of romance.</p>

<p>A man still under thirty, he was by far the greatest detective
that the Commonwealth had ever known, and his personality was
undeniably a most unusual and interesting one. Considered
generally to be almost a genius in his particular calling, upon
first sight, however, in appearance he seemed quite conventional,
and, indeed, almost commonplace. He was just a simple,
merry-hearted fellow to look at, with a happy boyish face, and
with eyes bright like a bird's. He might easily have been
mistaken anywhere for an ordinary every-day clerk, working in
some office, or a young fellow serving, perhaps, behind the
counter of some shop, and it needed a keen judge of character to
discern the great forces that lay behind the very ordinary,
though pleasing, exterior.</p>

<p>It was no exaggeration to say that his intellect was one of
the most subtle kind, and in addition he was well educated, of
wide knowledge, and of a most profound imagination. In his ideas
he was a poet, an artist, and a dreamer&mdash;in fact, he was
almost the last man one would have associated in any way with
crime, yet crime in all its phases was the study and obsession of
his life.</p>

<p>He studied criminals as another would study venomous reptiles.
They were his hobby as well as his profession. He collected them,
so to speak, and when he had got them cased, and had withdrawn
their poison fangs, it became almost a grief to him that the law
should snatch them away.</p>

<p>Tireless in his pursuit of them, he had almost an affection
for those who had occasioned him the most trouble, and he was
never spiteful or bitter when the throw of the cards went against
him.</p>

<p>Neglectful of nothing that would help him in the pursuit of
his profession, he was a mighty master in the art of disguise,
and, given a case to follow up, while never for one second
leaving the trail, he would seem nevertheless sometimes to fade
completely away from it, as if, in fact, he had turned the whole
thing up.</p>

<p>For weeks or months, perhaps, he would be unheard of and
unseen, and then he would appear suddenly, and some astonished
malefactor would find himself laid by the heels, through the
disclosures, perhaps, of his bosom friend, or of the very man he
had trusted most.</p>

<p>It was said that his disguises were impenetrable, and that
once he had actually served unrecognised part of a term of
imprisonment, rather than disclose his identity to the
authorities, at a particularly critical moment.</p>

<p>A man of originality, he held very unorthodox views as to
crime generally, and views that were not always approved by those
in high places.</p>

<p>Crime, he insisted, was the natural instinct of all mankind,
and everyone, he averred, was criminally inclined.</p>

<p>It was just natural for man to take what he wanted, and it was
fear or custom only that kept everyone within the law.</p>

<p>All criminals he divided into two classes&mdash;those who
broke the law because they were weak, and those who broke it
because they were strong, and he argued that once he was brought
in contact with a suspect it was always possible to surmise as to
his probable guilt or innocence very quickly.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" he would say, "that man is no thief. He hasn't got the
right atmosphere about him to steal. He is too conventional," and
he would forthwith dismiss him from his inquiries, as if he did
not exist.</p>

<p>"Now that fellow," he would say another time, "is worth
watching. He is a capable, resourceful man, and chin and forehead
both show that he possesses courage and brains enough to pit
himself successfully against the law."</p>

<p>He was held in great respect by the criminal classes, and
several times attempts had been made to bring him to a violent
end. He had had many hair's-breadth escapes from death, but he
was a dead shot with an automatic, and hitherto had been always
found with the trump card.</p>

<p>Such then was the man whom the public were now deciding was
the only one in the Commonwealth capable of handling the Eli
Barton case, and it was not the public only who were anxious for
him to be called in.</p>

<p>Sam Gover and young Stanley Barton were both just as
insistent, too, that he should be the man of the hour.</p>

<p>Sam Gover was still an honoured if, at the same time, a rather
reluctant guest at the station of James Dice. Young Stanley
Barton was also a guest there, but it must be admitted at once
that there was no reluctance at all about his stay. He was more
than ordinarily interested in Dice's niece, pretty Margaret
Bevan, and as far as he was concerned there was no anxiety that
their visit should come to an end.</p>

<p>For a fortnight Sam Gover was much too ill to be moved, and
James Dice was kindness itself in his consideration for the
invalid. A great friendship had sprung up between the two. James
Dice was all pity and compassion for the terrible ordeal the
other had been through, and Sam Gover, apart from the natural
gratitude that he felt for the care that was being given him, had
come to admire greatly the fine and self-reliant character of the
owner of Black Wolf.</p>

<p>"I'm glad, man," he said to him one day, "that some decent
chap at any rate got something good out of all the ghastly
business."</p>

<p>James Dice smiled his easy, pleasant smile. "Well, it was luck
for me there at any rate, my friend, wasn't it? As Tom Sellick
said, I shouldn't have stood much chance with the great Abimeleck
in the way, should I?"</p>

<p>Sam Gover was much longer than he should have been in getting
well, but, as Dr. Stark told him bluntly, he retarded his
convalescence not a little by grieving so continually over the
failure of the police to uncover any traces of the man who had
killed his friend.</p>

<p>"I can't help it, doctor," the old man replied. "I can't get
out of my mind the way poor old Eli died." He ground his teeth
savagely together. "The very moment I'm off this bed I'll hustle
things up. I'll spend every penny I've got to find the devil who
killed him. What are the police doing? I tell you they should
call in Larose. He is the only man with the brains to discover
the murderers."</p>

<p>And young Stanley Barton, with all his interest in pretty
Margaret, was just of the same opinion.</p>

<p><br>
At length Sam Gover was well enough to be brought to Adelaide,
and his arrival there reanimated again all the interest in the
dead Eli Barton.</p>

<p>The public were exasperated more than ever that nothing had
yet been discovered, and one began to hear everywhere again the
question&mdash;"Where is Larose?"</p>

<p>The man in the street asked it; the people in the hotels asked
it; they asked about it in private homes. The City magnates
discussed it frowningly over their coffee in the luncheon hour;
in the shops and warehouses it seemed almost for the moment the
sole topic of conversation, and the very police themselves
whispered about it when their superiors were not near.</p>

<p>The Press in no uncertain tones voiced the matter, too, but it
was given to the Times of Adelaide first to take the matter up
openly in the way the public wished.</p>

<p>Three days after Sam Gover's arrival in the City, it surprised
its readers with the announcement, in big type upon the front
page, that on its own initiative it was sending for Larose and
that, in the public interest, it was prepared to pay any fee that
the great detective might demand for his services.</p>

<p>A delightful chorus of approval went up everywhere, and the
answer to the telegram that the Times had dispatched to Sydney
was awaited with intense eagerness by the good citizens of the
beautiful city of the plains.</p>

<p>But the Times of Adelaide was mistaken in imagining that it
had been the first in the field.</p>

<p>Sam Gover and Stanley Barton themselves had already sent for
Larose, offering to pay all his expenses, and the handsome
consideration of a thousand guineas in addition, if he were
successful in discovering the murderers. They had sent off their
letter two days before the announcement by the Times of Adelaide,
and the very morning when that journal made its intention known
they were hoping to receive a reply at any minute.</p>

<p>But no reply came to them on that day or the next. Nor was the
Times of Adelaide able to announce to its readers that the
services of the great detective had been obtained on their
behalf.</p>

<p>A chilling and disappointing silence reigned in both
quarters.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch11"></a>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p class="first">BUT the matter was certainly not going to be
allowed to rest there, and on the third day urgent telegrams were
dispatched again to Larose.</p>

<p>Again, however, no replies were forthcoming, and those behind
the scenes began to believe that the correct address of Larose
could not have been obtained and that in all likelihood he must
have left the Commonwealth.</p>

<p>But on the fourth morning the silence was broken suddenly, and
it was apparent at once that all the communications had reached
Larose.</p>

<p>To the Times of Adelaide he wired: "Offer declined with
thanks. Refuse definitely to have anything to do with case. Have
retired.&mdash;Larose."</p>

<p>His telegram to Sam Gover and Stanley Barton was much the
same, only couched perhaps in a little less peremptory tone:</p>

<p>"Greatly regret unable to help. Am declining all private
investigations.&mdash;Larose."</p>

<p>Almost a groan of dismay went up in Adelaide when the contents
of the telegram became known, and the detective attracted not a
little censure, and in some places actual abuse.</p>

<p>Sam Gover and young Barton were bitterly disappointed. They
had built so much upon obtaining the help of Larose, and his
abrupt refusal struck at them both, and at the elder man
especially, as a cruel and unexpected blow.</p>

<p>They seemed now to be facing a blank wall, and what their next
step was going to be neither of them could in any way
determine.</p>

<p>On the evening of the day when the news of Larose's definite
refusal had been published in the Times and adversely commented
upon all over the city, they were sitting despondently in a
private room upon the first floor of the Australasian Hotel.</p>

<p>They were not speaking, and the elder man was considering for
perhaps the hundredth time the telegram received that morning
from the detective.</p>

<p>"Damn him!" he muttered bitterly. "Instinct tells me he would
have found out everything, if he had only come."</p>

<p>There was a sudden knock upon the door, and in response to Sam
Gover's "Come in!" one of the hall porters entered the room.</p>

<p>"A man to see you, sir," he announced. "He says he's come from
the garage about your car."</p>

<p>"Oh, tell him I'm busy," replied Sam Gover irritably. "Ask him
to come another time."</p>

<p>"Very well, sir," replied the porter, at once retiring from
the room.</p>

<p>He was back again, however, almost immediately.</p>

<p>"He tells me it's very important he should see you, sir," he
said apologetically. "It's something about the repairs to the
car, and they can do nothing until you've been spoken to. He's
brought a note."</p>

<p>Sam Gover frowned angrily.</p>

<p>"What the devil's up now?" he asked. "There's nothing wrong
with our car. It must be some mistake. It's not us he wants."</p>

<p>"He gives your name, sir, and Mr. Stanley Barton's, too. He
says it's very urgent, if you want the car tomorrow."</p>

<p>Sam Gover looked at young Barton, but the latter shook his
head.</p>

<p>"I know nothing about it," he remarked, "but perhaps we had
better see him and find out what he means."</p>

<p>The porter went out again, and a minute later the insistent
caller was admitted into the room. He was a rather oily-looking
individual, with a black smutted face, and a mop of dark, greasy
hair.</p>

<p>He stood respectfully twiddling a very dirty cap in a pair of
even dirtier hands.</p>

<p>"Well," asked Sam Gover, sharply. "What is it you want? What's
this about our car?"</p>

<p>But the man seemed to be in no hurry at all. He slowly
produced a crumpled-looking envelope from his pocket and handed
it solemnly across the table.</p>

<p>"Read that, sir," he said gruffly. "It tells you all about
it."</p>

<p>The porter, seeing he was not needed, retired quietly, closing
the door behind him.</p>

<p>The man with the letter looked round, as if to see that the
door were shut.</p>

<p>Still frowning, Sam Gover opened the envelope. In it there was
a small, twice-folded piece of paper. He unfolded it hesitatingly
as if for some unexplainable kind of reason he were expecting a
hoax. There were just a few words on the paper, lightly scrawled
in pencil.</p>

<p>"It is vital," he read, "that no one should know I am
here."</p>

<p>Twice Sam Gover went through the message, and then without a
word, but with a gesture of resigned annoyance, pushed the paper
across the table to young Stanley, who was sitting at the other
end. He knew his nerves were not in good order, and he would not
trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>Evincing but very little interest, Stanley Barton picked up
the paper and let his eyes fall casually upon the words that were
written there. "It is vital that no one should know I am
here."</p>

<p>For a moment it appeared that, like Sam Gover, he failed to
make any meaning out of the words, and then a startled and almost
incredulous expression crossed his face. His mouth hardened and
his eyes grew set and stern. He rose abruptly from his chair and
faced their visitor.</p>

<p>"Who are you?" he asked sharply. "Remember we are not children
here."</p>

<p>The man from the motor garage smiled a pleasant easy smile. He
passed one hand carelessly up to his face, and then with a quick
movement he jerked off a greasy wig and deposited it upon the
table. He straightened himself up. His eyes took on a different
expression, and his features seemed to alter and lengthen out. He
spoke and his voice was quiet and gentle.</p>

<p>"I'm Larose," he answered simply. "Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>For a moment there was a hushed and breathless silence in the
room, and then, before either Sam Gover or Young Barton could
recover from their astonishment, Larose picked up his wig again
and carefully readjusted it upon his head.</p>

<p>"We can't afford to take any chances," he said quietly, "and I
don't want to be recognised if any one should come in. Now, Mr.
Gover," he went on briskly, "will you be well enough to take
another motor journey, say, about the middle of next week? I
shall want Mr. Barton here to drive the car."</p>

<p>But Sam Gover did not answer for a moment. He was looking
fixedly at the detective, and he had all the appearance of a man
who had had to pull himself suddenly together. He was frowning
angrily and there was more than a trace of resentment in his
eyes.</p>

<p>"You say you are Larose," he asked very slowly, at length. He
leant back and continued dryly, "How do we know it, pray?"</p>

<p>"Good," replied the detective admiringly. "We shall get on
capitally together, you and I. A most proper question to ask." He
paused for a moment. "How are you to know I am Larose?" He
shrugged his shoulders. "Well, I certainly carry no cards on me,
and every stitch of clothing I have on is marked J. Bunting." His
face broke into a smile. "I think I may be able to convince you,
however. Listen. Your names are Samuel&mdash;Andrew Gover. You
are sixty-three years of age, and you were born in Glasgow. You
came out to Australia when you were fifteen years of age. Just
before you were thirty you went to the United States. You are an
engineer by profession, but your interests now are wholly
commercial. Your home is in New York City. You are chairman of
the Bonzo Oil Company, managing director of Hespers Ltd., and on
the board of the South West Grain Trust. You are over here on
holiday, and you arrived in Sydney on December the 3rd. You came
over on the Nerbudda, and your cabin number was 26. You gave
&pound;10 to the chief steward on leaving the boat, &pound;5 to
your table steward, and &pound;5 to the bath steward. Your chief
associates on the voyage over were Colonel Mackinnon, of
Brisbane, Mr. Harold Notley, of Broken Hill, and a Mrs. Selwyn
Fleming. The day after your arrival in Sydney you took the lady
to the Grand Theatre to see Passing Pain; the next day you sent
her a basket of flowers from Villier's, the florist, and the day
following&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right, all right," broke in Sam Gover, looking rather
uncomfortable. "I believe you are Larose all right, but why the
deuce you've taken all this trouble about me I don't pretend to
understand." A rather sly expression crossed the old man's face.
"I suppose you know all, too, about Mr. Barton here, and
everything he's done since he was a boy."</p>

<p>"At 9.25 this morning," replied the detective monotonously,
and as if he were repeating a lesson, "Mr. Stanley Barton left
this hotel. He proceeded at once to Harrups' confectionery store
and purchased there a large box of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thank you, thank you," interrupted young Barton hurriedly,
and looking, in his turn, a trifle red, "but I don't need any
more of that. I know you're Gilbert Larose. I recognise you from
the photos I've seen in the newspapers. So you needn't trouble
any more on that score." He went on quickly, "Was it at your
instigation then that those telegrams were sent saying you
couldn't come?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I arranged for them," he replied coolly. "There are
particular reasons why I wish that no one should know I am on the
case, and I am looking, too, to you gentlemen to keep faith with
me there." He dropped his voice to a whisper, and it became very
stern. "Not a soul must know&mdash;not even your greatest
friends." He looked intently at young Barton. "Mind, no man, nor
woman neither."</p>

<p>"All right," said Stanley coldly, "we quite understand. Now go
ahead."</p>

<p>Larose appeared satisfied. He took out a battered gun-metal
watch. "I allowed myself ten minutes here," he remarked, "and
eight of them are already gone. Any longer might perhaps look
suspicious."</p>

<p>He turned to Sam Gover, "Well, sir," he went on, "are you well
enough to motor again, say one day next week?"</p>

<p>"Quite well enough," replied the old man sturdily. "It's only
doing nothing that makes me feel bad now."</p>

<p>"All right then," said the detective. "Now please listen
carefully to what I'm going to say. You'll have to help me a lot
in this business, but I don't want to ask you any questions now.
I know everything that's been made public so far. I've been
interested in the case from the beginning. Another time, I want
to hear all your story from your own lips, and I want you also to
take me over the place where everything occurred." He paused for
a moment as if to think, and then went on rapidly. "Now this is
what I want you to do. Remain here at this hotel until I send for
you. Never go far away. Be ready to leave at any time at a
moment's notice. I shall want you to meet me somewhere, but I
don't exactly know where yet. At any rate it will be a good many
miles from Adelaide, and you must come there in a hired car. I
don't want your own to be recognised. No one must know where you
are going, and up to the last minute your going away must not be
disclosed." His voice dropped into a stern, hard whisper, "You
understand, no one must know&mdash;no one&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a knock upon the door, and the porter appeared
again.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dice and a lady to see you, sir," he said addressing Sam
Gover. "Shall I show them in?"</p>

<p>The old man received a lightning glance from Larose, and the
latter at once nodded his head.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," came gruffly from the motor mechanic, as if
he had just received some orders. "It shall be done exactly as
you say," and he made as if he were about to leave the room.</p>

<p>But the porter had gone off to show up the visitors, and it
was Larose in his own person who turned to issue his final
orders.</p>

<p>"Now mind," he hissed sharply, and almost as if he was
addressing his subordinates, "not a word, not a whisper to anyone
that you have seen me or are going to meet me. If it gets out, I
tell you quite half my chances are taken away.
Remember&mdash;quite half."</p>

<p>Footsteps were heard in the corridor, and instantly the
imperious detective was merged back into the obsequious
workman.</p>

<p>The door opened, and it was Margaret Bevan who entered first.
She blushed prettily when she saw young Barton. Mr. James Dice
came in looking spruce and trim. He was advancing to Sam Gover,
when the motor mechanic caught his eye. The owner of Black Wolf
glanced casually at him for just one second, and then perhaps for
a fraction of another second looked back again.</p>

<p>"H'm," muttered the detective, as he edged out of the room and
closed the door behind him, "so that's Mr. James Dice is it? So
far the only person that we know of who made anything out of this
business." He shook his head thoughtfully as he went down the
stairs. "No&mdash;it's too easy to be true. Still&mdash;still,
why did he look at me twice?" The expression on the detective's
face was a thoughtful one, but a couple of minutes later he was
walking up the street as if, for him at any rate, there was not a
care nor a mystery in all the world.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch12"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="first">ON the Monday week following upon their brief
interview with Larose, in the very early morning, Sam Gover and
young Barton left the Australasian Hotel. Acting under the
instructions they had received, they had informed no one of their
intended departure, and up to within a few minutes of their going
no one in the hotel was aware of it.</p>

<p>Carrying only a hand valise each, they made their way to a
distant garage, and a few minutes later were driving away in a
hired car from the city. Their destination was to be the town of
Goolwa, about 60 miles away.</p>

<p>Sam Gover was excited and hopeful but young Barton was pensive
and rather sad. The old man was quite certain now that everything
would go well. He had unbounded faith in Larose, and the
masterful way in which the detective had taken possession of
everything and issued his orders was balm and comfort to the big
business man, who all his life long had commanded others and
understood the satisfying content, whatever might eventuate, of
serving under a decisive master mind.</p>

<p>But Stanley was thinking of the pretty Margaret. She and her
uncle were still in Adelaide, and he had promised himself a
continuance of some delightful adventures with the girl before
she returned home. Now, he had had to tear himself suddenly away
and, worse still, he had not been able even to tell her that he
was going. What would she be thinking of him, he wondered, and
why on earth hadn't he been able to give her an inkling of what
was happening?</p>

<p>But Sam Gover had been adamant in that respect, although he
himself had had to exercise a lot of self-restraint in not
mentioning anything at all to his new friend, James Dice.</p>

<p>He had, however, given his word to Larose and with that, for
him, the matter ended, though he held privately to the opinion
that, knowing the whole Coorong district as he did, James Dice
should have been the very man of all others to be called in and
consulted as to the best method of their quest.</p>

<p>They made for Goolwa in a very round-about way, and, as
instructed, did not arrive at the Bush hotel until a few minutes
before six o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>Putting up their car in the garage, they proceeded into the
office to engage rooms. They found then, however, to their great
dismay, it being in the height of the summer season, the hotel
was full, and no rooms were for the moment available. Sam Gover
was almost apoplectic in his disappointment, and strenuously
insisted that accommodation must be found for them somewhere. The
young woman in the office, however, reiterated that it was quite
impossible, but the head waiter, happening to pass at that
moment, quickly took in the situation and a short whispered
colloquy took place between the two. The engagement book of the
hotel was produced and gone through.</p>

<p>Then to the great relief of the travellers, and not a little
to their surprise, too, the girl suddenly became all smiles, and
thought she could just manage it. The waiter bowed deferentially,
a smart chambermaid was at once summoned, and very quickly Sam
Gover and young Barton were being shown into a large and
well-appointed room upon the ground floor.</p>

<p>"Good man, that waiter," enunciated old Gover, when they were
alone. "He's got the sense to see we're people worth looking
after, and he shall have a good tip for it when we go. I always
like to deal with folks who use their brains. It was certainly
lucky for us though that he came upon the scene just when he
did."</p>

<p>A few minutes later at dinner, too, their good luck seemed
certainly to be continuing. Although the dining saloon was
packed, they were provided with two of the best seats, just under
an electric fan, and at the cool end of the room. Their friend,
the head-waiter, also kept a solicitous eye upon them the whole
time, and saw to it that the small army of menials under him
provided them quickly with everything they wanted.</p>

<p>He was so attentive that Sam Gover soon became quite
enthusiastic about him, but really it was no more than the man
deserved, for there was no doubt about his being a most efficient
head-waiter. Even the most unobservant visitor to the hotel could
not have failed to be impressed with the way he carried out his
duties. He was here, there and everywhere at the same time, and
his attention was seemingly focussed on each individual person,
in their own particular turns. He had an eye for everything. Was
there a fork missing, and he noticed it. Was the cruet not
handy&mdash;and he was there to put it in his place. Had anyone
not been asked if they would be taking wine, and he seemed to
know it. Altogether, he was like a great strategist making sure
that no single item of the dinner campaign should miscarry or go
wrong.</p>

<p>There were between fifty and sixty other diners, and, with the
edge off his appetite, Sam Gover began to take stock of them.</p>

<p>"I don't see anyone here like Larose," he whispered presently,
"but from what he wrote I hardly think he'll be here for a day or
two, and then I expect he'll turn up in some new disguise."</p>

<p>"Most probably he will," sniffed Stanley Barton, who was
thinking of Margaret Bevan, and objected to his thoughts being
interrupted. "Our good friend, Larose, has certainly always had
the reputation of being gifted with strong histrionic talent, and
no doubt, in due course, he will spring upon us another surprise.
Perhaps even now he is watching us somewhere from another table."
A dry smile crossed the young man's face. "Perhaps he's that big,
fat woman opposite us," he whispered. "I notice she keeps on
looking at you."</p>

<p>"Don't be ridiculous, Stanley," frowned old Gover, "you're
only annoyed because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;" he hesitated,
and then smiled in his turn&mdash;"because I've dragged you away
from the City. Bless your heart, my boy, I was your age
once."</p>

<p>Stanley laughed good-naturedly. "Yes, and by Jove from what
Larose told us you're by no means old yet. What about that affair
of yours on the boat? What about those&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Coffee, sir?" broke in a voice at his elbow, and he turned to
find the headwaiter standing deferentially behind.</p>

<p>Sam Gover frowned a warning glance, and the two friends
subsided into silence. When they spoke again it was about the
weather.</p>

<p><br>
For nearly a week the two remained at the Bush Hotel and,
although they were most impatient for the coming of Larose, time,
nevertheless, did not hang heavy on their hands.</p>

<p>Situated as Goolwa is, near the mouth of the great Murray
River and handy to the entrance of the Coorong, there is always
plenty of life and interest there in the summer time. The
township becomes the Mecca of the boating and the yachting world,
and a good number of motor-boat folk are always to be found
there.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of the head-waiter, who took a most
respectful interest in the two friends, Sam Gover had
requisitioned a small motor-boat himself, and daily excursions
were made up the Murray and along the great lake of the
Coorong.</p>

<p>The holidays and rest were obviously doing the old man a lot
of good, and young Stanley, too, would have been almost happy
except for thinking of the absent Margaret.</p>

<p>Still, neither of them could forget the purpose that had
brought them to Goolwa and, as day after day went by and neither
sign nor sound came to them of Larose, they began at last to
chafe at the delay and wonder what could have happened.</p>

<p>"I don't understand it," said old Gover mournfully on the
morning of the sixth day as they were going in to breakfast, "and
I hope to goodness no illness has come upon the man. The worst of
it is we are cut off from everything and can't communicate with
him. Larose seems to have made a mistake there."</p>

<p>They sat down to their table, and, as was his custom, the
head-waiter at once glided up to take their orders.</p>

<p>"Fish, sir?" he asked Sam Gover. "The Murray cod is excellent
this morning."</p>

<p>Old Gover nodded his head. "You're quite a prince of waiters,
Fenton," he remarked, smilingly, "and I shall be really sorry
when you're not near to tell me what to have. Indeed I'm half
inclined to steal you away from the hotel, when we leave."</p>

<p>The man smiled back as if pleased with the compliment, but
there was not the slightest trace of familiarity about his
appreciation, and he moved quickly away to continue unconcernedly
his other duties.</p>

<p>The two friends dawdled over their breakfast, and most of the
other guests had already disappeared from the room when they, in
turn, rose from the table.</p>

<p>Immediately then the head-waiter again glided up and, with a
low bow, presented a paper on a salver to Sam Gover.</p>

<p>"What's this?" asked the old man in some surprise.</p>

<p>"Your bill, sir," replied the waiter quietly. "You'll be
leaving this afternoon after lunch."</p>

<p>"Leaving!" ejaculated Sam Gover. "What the
devil&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the words died suddenly upon his lips, and he drew in a
deep breath. The waiter was looking at him fixedly and intently,
and there was no appearance now of servility on his face.</p>

<p>"Take up your bill," he said, very sternly. "You'll find a
note underneath it. I'm Larose, Gilbert Larose."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch13">CHAPTER XIII.</a></h2>

<p class="first">SAM GOVER gasped in amazement, and young Barton
set his face hard to conceal his surprise. With hands that shook,
the old man picked up the bill and the folded paper underneath.
Then, upon a sign from Larose, he put both into his pocket.</p>

<p>The detective moved off, and it was the obsequious waiter
again who was attending to the wants of a young couple at an
adjoining table.</p>

<p>Two minutes later and, secure in their rooms, Sam Gover and
young Barton breathlessly opened the letter.</p>

<br>

<p><i>"I am sorry you have been kept in the dark,"</i> they read,
<i>"but it was best for the end we have in view. I will explain
later. I have a billet here for a month, but I have got a day off
from this afternoon. I want to go up the Coorong with you
tonight. The conditions will be just right. Take the motor boat
and get in some provisions. Leave the landing-stage exactly at
three o'clock, and pick me up about a mile down. If anybody asks
where you are going, say up towards Murray Bridge. You can return
to the City to-morrow afternoon."</i></p>

<p><br>
"Well I'm darned!" explained Sam Gover enthusiastically.
"Nothing will surprise me now. Not even if Larose turns out to be
one of the beggars who held us up."</p>

<p><br>
"Yes," said Larose that afternoon when their little motor boat
was rapidly chug-chugging along the Coorong, "I saw they were
advertising for a head waiter at the Bush Hotel, and I applied
for the post and got it. I was afraid at first there might have
been a little difficulty about a reference upon such short
notice, but"&mdash;and here he coughed modestly behind his
hand&mdash;"a little visit to the writing room in the
Australasian Hotel and the difficulty was soon got over. Most
people," he went on meditatively, "are surprisingly unsuspicious
until their suspicions are in the first instance aroused, and
that is what, unfortunately, makes roguery profitable and so
easy. How did I know about waiting?" He laughed as if in great
amusement, to himself. "Why, bless you, I've been affiliated for
years to the Sydney Waiters' Union, and I can tell you I've found
it very useful sometimes. People often talk most openly before
waiters, even the most reserved people, too, and in my work I've
picked up many a good piece of information when handing round the
dishes and the plates. This week, for instance, I've learnt
several things that may be useful and help us on. One thing in
particular was interesting." He looked curiously from one to the
other of his companions. "Did you know the local folks at
Meningie and Kingston have established a sort of patrol over the
Coorong? At least, whenever a car passes through either township
to take the track, its number is secretly noted and news
telephoned on at once to the other end. Your friend, Mr. Dice, is
the head of the movement, I understand, and they all take it in
turn to keep watch. That's why we've had to come by boat
to-night."</p>

<p>"No," replied Sam Gover, speaking for them both. "We knew
nothing about it, but still I don't see why that should have
prevented us going by car. Mr. Dice might have been a great help
to us there."</p>

<p>The detective looked thoughtfully into the water. "Well, it's
always been a life rule of mine," he remarked, "to have as few
hunting in a pack as possible. The most unlikely people are often
the very ones to give you away."</p>

<p>It was not far off seven o'clock when they began to draw near
to their destination. For several miles the Coorong track had
been winding at the edge of the lake, and they had been able to
note the figures upon the mile posts. Thirty-two miles from
Meningie, thirty-three, and then thirty-four. Conversation
dragged, and then finally dropped altogether. They were all,
however, silent for different reasons.</p>

<p>Young Barton was thinking of the uncle he had loved, and then
later of the foul and dreadful thing that had lain huddled in the
tonneau of the car; Sam Gover was un-nerved and shaking with the
memory of the agonies that so recently had been his upon those
burning sands, and Larose&mdash;well, Larose was just holding
himself in. To all outward appearances by far the calmest of the
three, in reality he was hot and eager as a bloodhound, straining
to be unleashed upon the trail.</p>

<p>It was he who broke the silence first "Well, here we are," he
said softly. "The thirty-fifth mile post at last. Now, Mr.
Barton, if you'd just turn the boat in, please."</p>

<p>Stanley switched off the engine and with a turn of the tiller
the boat glided to the shore. The detective stepped out, and made
fast with the anchor into the sand.</p>

<p>"Now, I think we'll have our meal first," he said in brisk and
businesslike tones. "There's an hour yet to darkness, and I don't
want to do anything before then. You see, Mr. Gover," he went on,
"I have not really asked you anything as yet about the death of
your friend, and I have purposely refrained from doing so because
I want to obtain your answers with all the surroundings of the
murder exactly before your eyes. I mean, I want to question you
under the best conditions possible to stimulate your memory.
Tonight I want the darkness, the smell of the hot sand, and the
limited area of visibility as will be given by our lights.
To-morrow at dawn I want you in that gully where you returned to
consciousness again, and I want you to recall then the first
thoughts that came to you when you rose up from the sands." The
detective's voice was grave and earnest. "Remember, we are up
against cunning and resourceful minds, or perhaps one cunning and
resourceful mind, and it is only on the assumption that they or
he made a mistake somewhere that we have any chance at all." He
shrugged his shoulders. "At present I have no idea where to begin
my search, but any moment when we are going over the actual scene
of the happenings you may tell me something that will provide me
with the initial clue. But now for something to eat first."</p>

<p>Darkness had well fallen when the three men were pacing the
sand ravine where the big Jehu had been held up. Larose was
carrying a powerful acetylene lamp, and Stanley Barton an oil
hurricane lantern.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Gover," said the detective, briskly, "this is about
where Mr. Barton pulled up his car. You will remember, you said
he remarked to you at that moment that you were thirty five miles
from Meningie, and this is the only place, nearby, where the
track runs between two high sandhills as you described."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Sam Gover huskily. "It was here we pulled up
and the hurricane lantern was waved over by the bend there. It's
quite clear to me. I remember it distinctly."</p>

<p>"Well," went on the detective. "Mr. Stanley and I will remain
here, but I want you to walk on now with the hurricane lantern
and do exactly as the man who stopped you did. Do exactly as he
did, mind. This acetylene lamp here will act for the Jehu car.
Wave the lantern as you think the man did, then come forward and
call out your message and then turn back, all exactly as he
did."</p>

<p>With a nervous smile Sam Gover walked off until he had
proceeded for about a hundred paces, and then he turned and
jerkily swung the hurricane lantern to and fro, calling out at
the same time. Then he walked forward until he almost reached the
light, and then stood stock-still shading his eyes with his
hand.</p>

<p>"Well, say something," said Larose sharply. "The man didn't
stand there as if he were struck dumb, did he?"</p>

<p>"But he hesitated," replied Sam Gover, "he seemed uncertain
about something." The old man spoke testily. "You told me to do
exactly as he did."</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh!" exclaimed Larose most interested. "He hesitated, did
he? He was uncertain, eh? Well, go on, go on. When you turn back
we'll follow, without the light."</p>

<p><br>
At once Sam Gover turned round, and at a much quicker pace
than when he had approached them made for the bend where the
track came out from between the two sandhills.</p>

<p>"Keep close to me," he called out. "We were right on the
beggar's heels here." He swallowed a lump in his throat. "Now,
this is where Eli flashed his torch."</p>

<p>There was a click and a ray of light stabbed the darkness.
Larose had come prepared for everything.</p>

<p>"That's where their car was," exclaimed Sam Gover excitedly.
"It stood in front of that bush. That's where Eli fell when they
shot him and this is just about where I lay on the sands." He
ground his teeth savagely together. "Oh! the devils! if only I'd
got the one behind the car."</p>

<p>"But you hit the other?" queried the detective. "You are sure
of that?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly," replied Sam Gover. "I heard him yell."</p>

<p>"But you didn't see him fall?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"No, it was too dark for that. You see, the lantern had gone
out and there was then no light at all. But I hit&mdash;I hit
him, for he shrieked out, 'Oh my arm.' It was with my second
shot, too, I am sure. The first shot I had fired at random, and
in the second shot I think I must have been guided by what I saw
in the flash of the first. I remember getting a lightning glimpse
of a figure running towards the car."</p>

<p>"And he called out instantly as if hurt?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Yes, he shrieked several times."</p>

<p>"You didn't mortally wound him? You think it was only his
arm?"</p>

<p>Sam Gover shook his head.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Sam Gover, relating to Larose on the spot,
the details of the shooting that ended in Eli Barton being
murdered and one assailant wounded, was asked did he kill the
bandit, Gover shook his head.</p>

<p>"No, I am sure I didn't kill him," he said. "Too much squeal
about him for anyone vitally hurt. I don't believe even that I
hit him anywhere except in one of his limbs." The old man paused
for a moment and then went on thoughtfully. "It's like this.
Whenever I have thought things over since it always seems to me
that I must have hit a bone somewhere, because the man was
instantly in pain. He cried out just as a man often does when
he's hit that way."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Larose, as if surprised, "then you've been in some
fighting before this?"</p>

<p>The old man laughed slily. "Certainly, sir. You're not by any
means the only man who's had adventure in his life. As a matter
of fact, I've seen quite a lot of fighting in my time, and
amongst other scraps I was in the Boer War. I've often had men
hit beside me, and the other night when this chap squealed out I
remember thinking subconsciously to myself: 'Well, I've broken a
bone of him, anyhow.' Broken a bone, mind you, no vital hit.
That's how it struck me at the time, thinking automatically as it
were."</p>

<p>"Very interesting, Mr. Gover," commented Larose, "and very
well explained, too. But the police tried hard to follow up upon
your idea and looked everywhere for a wounded man. They made
inquiries of every doctor and every chemist in the State. Nothing
however came of it, as you know, and they were completely at a
dead end. Now, just one more thing. Point out to me exactly where
their car stood and I want you to be very particular here."</p>

<p>"It was exactly over there," said Sam Gover, indicating the
position with his hand. "I remember that bank behind it, and on
the top that bush."</p>

<p>"And it was the spot-light he turned on you? Not the headlights of the car?"</p>

<p>"Yes, it was the spot-light," replied the old man
emphatically, "and he deliberately turned it round until it fell
on me."</p>

<p>"How far did he have to turn it then?" asked the detective
sharply.</p>

<p>"A good half-turn, I should say, but it was done very quickly,
and I was immediately blinded in the light."</p>

<p>"Which way did he turn it?" said Larose quickly. "Do you
happen to remember?"</p>

<p>"This way," replied Sam Gover waving his arm, "from left to
right."</p>

<p>The detective was silent for a moment and then he switched off
his torch. "A last question, Mr. Gover," he said, "and then we'll
go back to the boat. In your opinion, and speaking as a man who
knows something of firearms, what was the nature of the weapon
the man used?"</p>

<p>"A revolver, firing a bullet of large calibre," said Sam Gover
promptly, "old fashioned and probably pinfire. It was using black
powder, for when the spot-light was switched on the light came
through a haze of murky smoke. There was a smell of gunpowder,
too. Yes, it was old fashioned certainly, and banged like the
cavalry revolvers we used in the Boer War."</p>

<p>"Well, thank you, Mr. Gover," said the detective, "and now
we'll go back and get some sleep. We must be up at sunrise
to-morrow and you'll talk to us next in the gully where you were
probably thrown out." He smiled approvingly on the old man.
"Really, you're a most satisfactory person to deal with, and
you've helped me quite a lot just now."</p>

<p>The following morning, and before five o'clock, Sam Gover was
standing in the little gully from where, so short a time ago, he
had commenced his dreadful wanderings across the Ninety-Mile
Desert.</p>

<p><br>
Stanley Barton had led them to the spot where the Jehu car had
been found and the gully was within a few yards, at the side.</p>

<p>"Whew," whistled Sam Gover disgustedly, "and I was so near the
car the whole time. This is the spot right enough, for I remember
climbing up over the bank there. If only I had climbed up this
other side. You see," he went on, "I was so dazed and so confused
when I came to that I couldn't think at all, or I might have
judged pretty well where the track was by the position of the
sun. As it was, I went off in exactly the wrong direction, and
all my troubles began." His voice became hard and bitter. "Do you
realise, Mr. Larose, the hell that I went through then? Three
days and nights of pain and awful thirst. If it had not been for
the little whisky and water that I had in my flask I should have
died sure enough before I was found."</p>

<p>"Well," replied the detective, "you were at any rate lucky
there, but come, Mr. Gover, are you sure you remember nothing,
absolutely nothing, of anything that happened between the time
you were shot down on the track and the time you became conscious
again next day when, as you say, the sun was up?'"</p>

<p>"I've told you," said Sam Gover slowly, "that I was conscious
of being carried somewhere in a car. I felt the jolts distinctly,
and then after I had been thrown out, and was lying on the sand,
I remember I groaned."</p>

<p>"Lucky the wretch who threw you out didn't hear you then, or
he'd have finished you off at once."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't think I groaned then, but I remember coming
partly to some time and groaning because of my other arm. It must
have got twisted under me when I was thrown out, and the cramp
had made it more painful for the time being even than the wounded
one."</p>

<p>"Is that all you remember, everything?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can think of nothing more."</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Gover," persisted the detective, "if you were
conscious enough to remember that you groaned, surely you must
remember other things. What did you think had happened to you,
for instance? You must have been wondering where you were."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied the old man promptly, "I remember I thought
for a moment that I was back in the Boer War. I knew well enough
I was wounded, and&mdash;I heard firing, too."</p>

<p>"You heard firing," jerked out the detective sharply, "when
you were lying in the gully there? What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well," said Sam Gover very slowly. "At least I think now that
I did." He looked in a puzzled way at his interrogator. "Yes, I
seem to remember that I did somehow. By Jove," he went on, more
positively, after a moment, "yes, I'm sure I did, and it was that
big revolver, too, that was cracking again. It all comes back to
me now. It roused me up, and I wondered where the stretcher
bearers were."</p>

<p>He suddenly stopped speaking, and with his lips parted, stood
staring into the shadows of the little gully where he had once
lain. His face was white and drawn, and he had the appearance of
a man in mental pain. The memories of that black night had been
stirred in him, and he was recalling to his mind the long hours
of agony he had endured upon the sands.</p>

<p>The detective eyed him anxiously and for the moment was
obviously afraid to break into the reverie. When he did at length
speak, it was slowly and very softly, as if he were addressing
some one who was walking in his sleep.</p>

<p>"How many times did you hear this firing?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! only once," replied Sam Gover, with a long drawn
sigh.</p>

<p>"And how soon was it after you were thrown in the gully, do
you think?" continued the detective, his voice still almost in a
whisper.</p>

<p>"I don't know, but I don't think it could have been very long,
for it was the bang that woke me up, and I remember at once
starting to spit the sand out of my mouth, before I lost
consciousness again. I expect I must have fallen face downwards
when I was pulled out of the car."</p>

<p>Larose asked one more question only.</p>

<p>"Did the bang sound quite close or very far away?"</p>

<p>"Neither," replied Sam Gover. He hesitated for a moment. "It
might easily have come from the very place where we had been held
up."</p>

<p>An hour later, and proceeding quickly back along the lake,
Larose appeared to take his companions fully into his confidence.
At least, that was, at any rate, the impression that he gave
them, as no doubt he intended to.</p>

<p>"Now let us see exactly where we are," he commenced briskly.
"I don't think our little expedition has by any means been
wasted, and time may show that we have really found the beginning
of the trail. Only one thing I must impress upon you, on your
honours. Not a whisper of where we have been must get about.
Neither of you must tell a soul that you have ever seen me." His
tones became most grave and serious. "When you say good-bye to me
at Goolwa to-night, forget that you have seen me. I shall drop
out of your lives for a little while and Larose must mean nothing
more to you than just the name of the man of whom you have heard.
You have never met me. I never called upon you. I wired refusing
your offer and there the matter ended. See?" His voice became
almost menacing in its insistence. "Remember, it is vital. It is
vital that no one should know I am at work. I have hopes, I have
great hopes, of laying hands upon the actual murderer, but I
shall only get him if he thinks that the pursuit has all died
down. I must catch him off his guard." The detective shrugged his
shoulders and his face broke into a smile. "When you get back to
the city, just say you have been to Goolwa for a rest. Now I can
depend on you both, can I not?"</p>

<p>"All right," said Sam Gover rather testily, and young Barton
nodded as if the matter needed no discussion.</p>

<p>"Well," resumed the detective as if quite satisfied, "and how
does the position stand, I say? What is the extent of our exact
knowledge and what more may we reasonably surmise?" He paused for
a moment and then went on in brisk and businesslike tones.
"Listen, two men made up their minds to waylay and murder your
uncle. There were almost certainly not more than two men
involved. Quite apart from what Mr. Gover has told us, I gained
the impression right from the very beginning that it was only a
two man affair. Moreover, one thing stands out to me quite
clearly. Whoever they were, they were not habitual criminals, at
any rate in the assassination line." The detective sniffed
contemptuously. "They were amateurs and bunglers all along, and
at the critical moment, too, the master mind of the two lost his
head, as witness the fact, for instance, that Mr. Gover is alive
here to-day."</p>

<p>Larose paused again. "The murder was not a haphazard one," he
continued. "They were not out to murder any chance traveller on
the Coorong that came along. It was Mr. Eli Barton sure enough
that they were after, and it was him only they were expecting to
come. Surely it would be incredible to conceive that any
assassins would be waiting at midnight, in the very loneliest
part of the Coorong, on the off-chance that some stray car might
come along?" He shrugged his shoulders. "For one thing they would
not be able to know beforehand if what they were ambushing were
worth the very serious risk of the capital charge, and moreover
they would be quite ignorant when a car did arrive as to what
exactly they were taking on. It might have turned out to be only
a lorry with a load of empty petrol tins, or again it might have
been a car with five or six passengers in it. What good to them,
pray, would either of these have been? No, they knew what to
expect&mdash;they knew the car they were waylaying would be Mr.
Eli Barton's. They were sure of that."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch15"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="first">DETECTIVE LAROSE, having heard all Sam Gover
could remember of the night he and Eli Barton were held up and
shot near the Coorong Lake, and having deduced that the banditry
had been carefully planned, turned again to Gover. "Then how did
they come to expect that Mr. Eli would be passing at midnight
through the Coorong? Was it his habit to do so?" He shook his
head. "No, we know he had never done so before. Plenty of
daylight passings, but never by night, never once. Well, how did
they know?"</p>

<p>"We didn't know it ourselves until about midday, as I've told
you," broke in Sam Gover, "and it was I who suggested it first.
Then we telephoned to the Broken Bough and asked them to pass the
message through to Meningie."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said the detective, "and therefore the idea of
holding up Mr. Barton could never have come into the murderers'
heads until the afternoon of that very day. They might of course
have guessed that he would be travelling to Adelaide through the
Coorong, because his horse was running in the Christmas Cup, but
they would never have dared to molest him in broad daylight. It
would have been too dangerous with the almost certain passing of
other cars in both directions. They might have shot him, of
course, but their presence on the Coorong track, either before or
after the shooting, would certainly have been noticed by some
one, and, as I say, the risk of everything would have been too
great. So we may take it for granted that the information the
murderers acted upon so promptly was picked up by them by chance.
And we may reasonably assume, also, that they didn't acquire it
themselves at first hand. I mean they were not actually present
themselves when the message came through to the Kingston or
Meningie Hotels. They probably heard some one else say: 'Oh, Eli
Barton is coming through the Coorong to-night. I heard them
talking over the telephone about it.' What makes me think this is
they obviously didn't seem to know Mr. Barton was to have a
companion with him as they would have done if they had themselves
heard the conversation over the phone." Larose spoke very
emphatically. "It is too much to believe they would have dared to
attack two men, and I am sure they thought Mr. Barton was coming
alone. One thing specially inclines me to this view. Note the
marked hesitation of the man with the lantern when Mr. Gover as
well as Mr. Barton stepped out of the car. He was glib enough
when he was calling upon the car to stop, but when he saw two
passengers alight instead of one he was tongue tied at once and
did not know what to say or do. Now, the man with the lantern was
undoubtedly the subordinate criminal to my mind, acting under
instructions, and the orders he had received only pertained to
the decoying of one victim, not of two. So he lost his head
straight away and started to run, thus arousing at once the
suspicion of Mr. Eli and immediately bringing down upon your
friend the fatal shot."</p>

<p>Larose stopped speaking, and turning from his companions,
allowed his eyes to wander for a moment upon the sandhills across
the lake. Very soon, however, he took up his argument again.</p>

<p>"Well, who now," he asked solemnly, "were these men who that
night set out deliberately upon this quest of murder? Were they
just chance travellers like yourselves, passing through the
Coorong, or were they local men who lived about here." He looked
questioningly at Sam Gover. "What about that lantern they
used&mdash;does nothing strike you there?"</p>

<p>The old man shook his head. "It was a hurricane lantern, like
the one we used last night," he said slowly. "I am sure of that,
for I can see the shadows now that it cast upon the track as the
man went on in front of us."</p>

<p>"Well," the detective sharply, "and is a hurricane lantern,
pray, included in the ordinary equipment of the usual touring
car? No, no," he went on, at once answering the question for
himself, "and that is why I so insist that nothing of our journey
here should get known. The assassins we are looking for are local
men. They live somewhere near here, and that hurricane lantern
they used is no doubt still seeing service on some near station
or outlying farm." He looked at Sam Gover again. "And is nothing
significant to you either, from the way in which they had parked
their car? Can you gather nothing from the way the spot-light had
to be turned round so that it should focus upon you as you lay
upon the sand? From left to right you said. Well, that meant
surely that the car itself was facing towards Meningie, for you
had approached from the direction of Kingston, and only in that
case would the spot-light need to be swung back, from left to
right, to pick you out."</p>

<p>"But it was," said Sam Gover. "It was all done in a second, of
course but I remember distinctly it was turned back."</p>

<p>"And so with their car facing towards Meningie," continued the
detective "That was, of course, the direction in which they
intended to go, directly after they had finished with Mr. Barton,
for it stands to all reason and common sense that they would have
made all preparations for a quick getaway directly the matter was
finished. Their car would have been all ready in position for
them to bolt away at once."</p>

<p>"But no car passed through Meningie that night," broke in
Stanley Barton. "We are sure of that."</p>

<p>"Pooh! pooh!" answered Larose, "and who said one did?" He
frowned at the young man. "Is it not feasible that, having
removed all traces of any crime from the track, the murderers
could have driven almost as far as Meningie during the night but
not have actually entered the township until the sun was well up?
Knowing every foot of the Coorong as they most probably did, they
could easily have hidden just off the track somewhere and waited
until they could pass through Meningie without their presence
exciting any comment, or perhaps even being remembered
afterwards." The detective shook his head emphatically. "You see,
Mr. Barton, everything points to the probability that the men who
murdered your uncle knew the Coorong well, and worked, too, from
this end of the track. The place they chose for the ambush was
the one ideal on the Meningie side. There was that convenient
bend in the track between those big hummocks, and from one of the
hummocks they could watch him coming for over seven miles,"
Larose laughed slily. "Oh! yes, I myself know some parts of this
Coorong of yours pretty well now, I spent three days and three
nights here three weeks ago."</p>

<p>"Before you wired to us?" frowned Sam Gover. "Then you had
already taken up the case?"</p>

<p>"Well, not, exactly," smiled Larose, "but it happened I was
holidaying in Adelaide; and the case interested me and gave me
something to do." The smile died quickly from his face. "But I
tell you once again, it is vital no one should know I have been
here. Everything depends upon it. You understand?"</p>

<p>Sam Gover and young Barton nodded. "Then do you think," asked
the former, "that you'll have any success in the end? Have you
any idea at all as to what kind of men they were who held us
up?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Gover," said Larose very solemnly, "the death of your
friend was accomplished by two very ordinary and commonplace men
and novices, too, in the shedding of blood. They were not
habitual criminals in any way in that respect, and they just took
to murder in this instance upon the particular urge of some fixed
motive that to me, at all events, is not yet clear." He regarded
the old man with very thoughtful eyes. "Was it for robbery alone,
do you think, that they planned this crime, and did they really
expect to find upon Mr. Barton money enough to compensate them
for the risk of being hanged?" He shook his head. "No, I am
puzzled there, I am puzzled. Remember, they were not
down-and-outs. They were not men without resources of any kind,
as witness they were in the position of being able to requisition
a motor car. As I say, I am puzzled, very puzzled."</p>

<p>He stopped speaking, and it seemed as if his thoughts had gone
voyaging again, upon their own, but in a moment he turned and
resumed in business-like tones.</p>

<p>"Well, we'll leave that for the present and try now to think
what the assassins originally intended to do when they had shot
down and robbed Mr. Barton. They would not have just driven off,
would they? They would not have left the body and the car for the
first passer-by to find, do you think?" Larose clenched his hands
emphatically. "No, a thousand times no. All their safety lay in
hiding what had happened, quite as much as in hiding that they
were the perpetrators of the crime. They wouldn't want the crime
to be discovered at all, or if it had to be discovered, they
would want that discovery to be so retarded and so belated that
people would have forgotten altogether by that time all the
doings of their neighbours about the date when the crime was
committed. Jones wouldn't remember then that Smith had been away
ostensibly on a fishing expedition that night, and Black would
have no recollection that he had passed White in his car just
before dawn was up, on that fateful day. And so on and so on. So
what had these miscreants intended to do? Why, very much what
they did do, but in a much more efficient and thorough manner.
They would have driven the Jehu not a bare miserable half-mile or
so into the bush, but 20 or perhaps 30 miles there, and the
probability is then that the body of Eli Barton would have
remained undiscovered for ever."</p>

<p>Larose stretched out his arm and pointed towards the
Ninety-Mile Desert. "Yes," he went on, "a dozen miles off that
track and there are places, perhaps, where no man has ever been.
An army could be hidden there, let alone a car and one dead
man."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p class="first">DETECTIVE LAROSE continued his reconstruction of
the crime. He turned to Sam Gover. "Try to visualise now what
exactly did take place after you and Eli Barton were struck
down," he said.</p>

<p>"We take it for granted, as we have no reason to believe
otherwise, that the hold-up was carried out by only two men.
Well, you had wounded one and he was probably too sick forthwith
to be interested in what was going on. But the other man would be
very much interested. He had to be, for he had just committed, as
he thought, two murders, and hanging is not for anyone a pleasant
thing. So he proceeded to dispose of the bodies, and the
assumption is that he dealt with Mr. Eli Barton's first. It looks
like it anyhow, for undoubtedly his body, from the position it
was found in the car, was the one thrown in first. It lay huddled
down upon the floor, whereas you, from the blood marks, were
pitched in afterwards and reclined, at any rate partly, upon the
back seat. And here one thing stands out as most significant to
me. The man searches Mr. Barton, but he does not search you. He
tears out Mr. Eli's wallet from the inside vest pocket and tears
it out so violently that he pulls off the safety-button and slits
the pocket itself as well. He was in such a desperate hurry that
he hadn't time to unbutton the pocket but, as I say, he just tore
the wallet out. But you&mdash;he never searched you, and missed,
as you informed the the police, over &pound;300 in good
Australian bank notes. He never apparently examined you in any
way, or he would have seen at once you were not dead. Now, what
does all that mean?" Larose leant over and tapped Sam Gover upon
the arm. "Panic, my friend, panic. The man was suddenly in
desperate fear, and he had lost his head. He was no longer the
man of steady aim who could hit Mr. Eli in the centre of the
forehead with his first shot, the man who had coolly switched on
the spotlight when he was himself under fire, the man who had
been able to think and act collectedly when the bullets from your
automatic were pinging round his car. No, he was quite a
different man now and his actions show he had completely lost his
nerve."</p>

<p>Larose puckered his eye-brows.</p>

<p>"Now, I ask you why had he got so flurried? If, as I have
surmised he had found he had two bodies to get rid of instead of
one, that is not sufficient, in any way, to account for it. All
cars going through the Coorong carry as we know, a spade
and&mdash;goodness gracious&mdash;there is sand enough here for
many times a million graves. Then what was the trouble, and why
was he so suddenly put out?"</p>

<p>The detective looked from one to the other of his companions,
but neither of them spoke. "Well, I'll tell you what I think," he
went on slowly. "The man was in some sort of panic about the
cars. You see, the farther away that the big Jehu was removed
from the actual place of the hold-up, if it were found, the most
difficult would be the picking up of any actual clues, and if it
were never found at all the position of the malefactors would
have been absolutely secure. Mr. Barton would then have simply
vanished, and it would never have been proved that his
disappearance had occurred upon the Coorong. Notwithstanding all
we have heard to the contrary, it would never have been certain
that he had not doubled back through Kingston during the night or
slipped through Meningie in the hours just before the dawn. No, I
am sure that the wretches counted upon getting the car hidden so
far away in the desert or the bush somewhere that it would never
have been found. Now, if that be so, then what had upset their
plans?"</p>

<p>Larose looked solemnly at Sam Gover. "It was you who had upset
them, Mr. Gover. You had wounded the man with the lantern and
there were now two cars with only one man able to drive
them."</p>

<p>The detective smiled. "Then, just think in what a quandary the
man with the revolver was. He had to act with the greatest
despatch possible, for every second he delayed only added to his
danger. But&mdash;if he bolted straight away and left the Jehu
and the bodies where they were, the hue and cry would be raised
next day and with the interest and curiosity that would be
everywhere aroused how could he satisfactorily account for the
bullet wound of his companion? Explanations would have to be
forthcoming, and he no doubt realised it was more than possible,
with any suspicion falling on them, that certain other and more
damning facts might come out and point to them directly as the
murderers. So, he couldn't leave the car on the track to be found
where it was, and it had to be driven away somewhere. But the
devil of it was, he couldn't drive it far, for he had, of course,
to return to the other car on foot. So he just drove it, as we
know, to the spot where we went last night, less than a mile off
the track, and left it as it was afterwards found. And it's quite
clear to me that all the time the man was working in a perfect
frenzy of fear. You, Mr. Gover, were just picked up anyhow; you
were unsearched, and you were just flung in and pulled out with
no caution at all. Something, too, must have suddenly accentuated
his fears the moment after he had pitched you down that gully,
for why was not the body of Mr. Barton flung out too? No,
everything was done in a frenzied hurry as if his only thought
uppermost was to get away. It was panic, I tell you, panic, and
there&mdash;there for the moment our surmises must almost
end."</p>

<p>Larose stopped speaking and, folding his arms, leant back
against the side of the boat. It seemed as if he had suddenly
become tired, for he sighed heavily and half closed his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well," said Stanley Barton breaking into the silence, "and do
you think we shall ever know who the wretches were?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, I do," replied Larose emphatically, and at once
reopening his eyes. "It requires time and patience; that is
all."</p>

<p>"But that wounded man," said Sam Gover, "I am always wondering
how he was hidden away. If only we could have discovered
him."</p>

<p>"Don't worry," replied the detective grimly, "I shall find
him. Soon I shall come back here to look. He is not far away." He
spoke very solemnly. "He lies buried somewhere under these
sands." Sam Gover and young Barton stared incredulously. "Yes,"
went on Larose, "his companion killed him because of his wound,
and that was his death-shot that you heard when you thought you
were back in the Boer War. Yes, he lies buried here."</p>

<p>That evening Sam Gover and young Barton left Goolwa upon their
return journey to the city, and Fenton, the popular and efficient
head-waiter, resumed for a time his duties at the Bush Hotel.</p>

<p><br>
One morning, just a week after the visit of Sam Gover and
Stanley Barton to the Coorong, a man with all the obvious
appearance of a holiday-maker could have been observed leaving
the railway station at Goolwa, immediately following the arrival
of the midday-train. He had brought quite a fair amount of
luggage with him in addition to his large rucksack, and a porter
was trundling a portmanteau on a barrow. A gun-case and a
fishing-rod were also much in evidence.</p>

<p>The holiday-maker had not come quite alone, for he had brought
a dog with him; an ugly-looking customer, half terrier and half
spaniel, and a critical observer would have surmised at once that
the animal was quite a recent purchase. He was undeniably
restive, and he and his possessor seemed by no means, as yet, on
good terms with one another. He was held in by a stout chain,
attached to a strong collar, and that both were necessary was
evidenced more than once, even before they had gone 50 yards from
the railway station by the determined efforts he made to break
away.</p>

<p>But the man was always good tempered about it, and by
alternate coaxing and pulling he managed to get the brute
along.</p>

<p>The party duly arriving at the Bush Hotel, the dog and the
luggage were deposited for the moment in a place of safety, and,
the porter being paid and dismissed, the man himself proceeded
into the hotel to partake of luncheon.</p>

<p>He thoroughly enjoyed the meal, notwithstanding the bad
service and the long waits between the courses.</p>

<p>"I am extremely sorry, sir," was the whispered apology of the
hotel proprietor, when, not until the third course had been
served, could the holiday maker obtain anything to drink, "but
we're all at sixes and sevens just now. I lost my head-waiter
suddenly only a couple of days ago. Taken ill, and had to go to
Adelaide at once. Such a good man, and everything's been
disorganised since he went."</p>

<p>The holiday-maker smiled good-naturedly.</p>

<p>"Bad luck, I'm sure," he commented sympathetically, "but
you'll soon be getting another one, anyhow."</p>

<p>The proprietor shook his head. "Not like the last one, sir,
never. He was a wonderful man. He wasn't here long but I never
met anyone like him. He knew what everyone wanted, and everyone's
business, too, before they had been in the hotel half an hour. He
was a marvel."</p>

<p>The holiday-maker leant back and appreciatively sipped his
wine. Then crossed, however, over his face what might easily have
been taken for an amused and gratified smile.</p>

<p>Finishing his lunch, he lighted a cigarette and strolled
leisurely round to the kitchen door. He seemed, as it were by
instinct, to have a knowledge of where all the offices of the
hotel were. He begged some bones for his dog from the head-cook,
and opining, again apparently by instinct, that the latter
gentleman was a racing enthusiast, gave him a couple of tips for
the races the next afternoon, and then smiled him into making a
neat little parcel of the food that had been sorted out.</p>

<p>Then he walked down to the Quay and after a lot of bargaining,
in which he certainly did not come off second best, hired a nice
roomy sailing boat for a week.</p>

<p>Then behold him, a couple of hours later sailing slowly away
from Goolwa his luggage bestowed methodically about the boat, the
ugly looking dog squatting disgustedly upon an old sack that had
been allotted to him in the bow, and he himself lying contentedly
back in the stern with a cigarette between his lips.</p>

<p>For a long while then there was silence. The dog shuffled
uneasily on his sack, and pricked his ears anxiously at the
gurgling of the water on the boat's sides. He contemptuously
ignored however, the man opposite him, and also a juicy-looking
bone that lay in close proximity to the sack. Indeed, so studied
was his attitude of indifference to everything pertaining to food
or master that, had he been a human being, it might have been
said that he was in the sulks.</p>

<p>Presently the man laughed. He leant forward and snapped his
fingers in the dog's face.</p>

<p>"Make it up, Swipes," he coaxed persuasively. "It's no good,
old man, I've bought you for two pound twelve and six, and until
I've done with you I'll be the only pal you're going to have."
Then he seemed to eye the animal rather dubiously. "But you
certainly don't look up to much old chap," he remarked, "although
your late master is not a born liar you are indisputedly the most
intelligent mongrel at present in South Australia, and a regular
pocket bloodhound when you're put upon the trail." He pushed the
bone nearer to the dog. "Well don't, if you don't want to. The
flies can have a tuck in first. You'll be glad of it to-morrow,
anyhow, or I'm a poor prophet and my name's not Gilbert
Larose."</p>

<p>Two evenings later a happy and now quite sociable couple were
encamped among the sandhills on the Coorong. A meal was in the
course of preparation and the detective was roasting a nice fat
rabbit upon a cleverly contrived spit, before a roaring fire. A
delicious aroma filled the air and the impatient cook kept
smacking his lips expectantly and prodding the rabbit with a fork
to see if it were done.</p>

<p>The dog was equally interested and never for a moment took his
eyes off the spit. His ears were cocked intelligently and he
watched all the proceedings with such an air of wisdom and
understanding that Larose, observing him, congratulated himself
and felt amply justified in his expenditure of two pounds twelve
and six.</p>

<p>"You really now look worth the money, Swipes," he commented
admiringly. "Well, we'll both have a rattling good dinner and
then, directly it gets dark, we'll get to business." His face
grew hard and stern. "Someone, perhaps, is going to swing from
tonight's work."</p>

<p><br>
They were camped only about two hundred yards from the place
where Eli Barton had met his death, and Larose had already spent
the greater part of the afternoon making himself acquainted with
the ground.</p>

<p>Time after time he had set off from exactly where the two
travellers had been struck down. He had wandered round the
sandhills, he had inspected all the little gullies, and he had
noted all the undulations and the drifted banks of sand. He had
climbed up all the hummocks within a radius of several hundreds
of yards, and had walked methodically down every ditch that could
be found. But always he had returned to the place he had started
from, and always for a long time upon his return had stood
thoughtfully gazing back upon the way he had just come.</p>

<p>His movements to any observer would have seemed very
mysterious, and a casual passer-by would at once have wondered
what on earth was happening. If anyone had been told the
detective was looking for a body, they would certainly then have
thought he was going about it in a very queer and unsatisfactory
manner. He made absolutely no attempt to probe the ground
anywhere and, although he had a dog with him the whole time, he
never once spoke to him or encouraged him to sniff about.</p>

<p>Then, just before he returned to the camp to prepare the
evening meal, his proceedings would have seemed even more
mysterious and inscrutable than ever.</p>

<p>He cut down about a dozen tall reeds and to the ends of each
of them he tied a small piece of white rag. The whole bundle he
then hid by the bank of the lake, covering them lightly over with
a little sand.</p>

<p>The last proceeding over, he seemed then suddenly to become
all at once a different man. He threw off his preoccupation; he
started humming a lively tune; he whistled to the dog, and then
finally doffing his clothes, raced down the sands and had a long
refreshing bathe in the lake.</p>

<p>It was just after eight that night and Larose, the great
Sydney detective, was standing exactly on the spot where, nearly
six weeks before, had been parked the small black car from behind
which some one had fired the fatal bullet that had struck down Eli
Barton.</p>

<p>Dusk was falling rapidly, but Larose was waiting for the exact
moment when it would be quite dark. To the top of a stout pole,
about five feet in height and thrust deep into the sand behind
him was lashed an acetylene lamp, but the lamp was as yet unlit.
At his feet lay the bundle of reeds that he had cut that
afternoon, and also a large ruck-sack, stuffed out roughly to the
shape of a man.</p>

<p>If he had been quiet and restrained earlier in the day, there
was certainly nothing like that about him now. He was trembling
violently, and his heart was pumping as if he had been running
hard. Indeed, it was plain that he was in a state of great
expectancy and excitement. But he had good reason anyhow, he
would have told anybody, for this condition.</p>

<p>A profoundly critical moment had arrived, and he was about to
put to the test all the elaborate theories that he had been
working out. He was staking everything upon what would eventuate
from the happenings of the next half-hour, for, if his reasoning
were correct, he would have located by then a body hidden
somewhere in the sands.</p>

<p>He was quite confident about it, however, for no matter how
hot and eager he was now, had not everything, he continually
reminded himself, been reasoned and thought out when his mind was
calm and icy cold.</p>

<p>He believed with certainty that a hidden body was quite near,
and he argued to himself that he would find it, because he was
about to surround himself with exactly the same set of
circumstances that had surrounded the murderer when he had shot
his victims down.</p>

<p>He was acting on the idea that all men, with certain
allowances for temperament, would act in exactly the same way
under the influences of panic or fear, and he was believing he
would be able to track every step of the murderer by the very
footprints he would make himself.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch17"></a>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p class="first">DETECTIVE LAROSE looked round into the
blackness. Darkness had at last fallen with all the suddenness of
an Australian night. He lit the acetylene lamp and a long beam of
light shot out across the sands.</p>

<p>The supreme moment had arrived.</p>

<p>"Now let me think," he muttered hoarsely; "let me put myself
exactly in his place. I am in deadly fear. I have just run nearly
a mile over heavy sands. I have killed a man and I must hide his
body and get away quick. I must bury him, of course. I must drag
him away somewhere. No, I must not drag him, I must leave no
trail. I must carry him, but I must be careful for he is dripping
with blood. I shall have to hold him at arm's length. I cannot
carry him far, for I am in a desperate hurry, and I have also to
burden myself with a spade. Now in which direction shall I go?
Away from the track, of course, and out of sight of it, too. I
know how the sand is blown about when the winds come, and
therefore I must bury him where the winds are least likely to
expose the grave. I must be quick for I have very little time.
Now, here goes."</p>

<p>Hurriedly he picked up the rucksack and one of the reeds that
he had ornamented only a few hours previously with the pieces of
white rag. He held his burden at arm's length, and, stumbling
heavily, made his way as if in desperation across the sands.
Fifty yards, a hundred, and he had rounded the base of a big
hummock that loomed black and sinister against the sky. He was
out of sight of the track now, and there was desolation
everywhere. He looked round sharply from side to side as he ran.
Ah! here was a likely spot, just where the sand began to rise
again. It lay in the dip between two hills. It would be in
shelter, no matter from which way the winds would blow, and it
was sown over here and there with tufts of coarse sea-grass that
would keep the sand from drifting far.</p>

<p>Without a second's, pause he dropped the ruck-sack and quickly
drove in one of the reeds he carried to mark the spot.</p>

<p>Then, with the sack again in his arms, he returned at a run to
the place from where he had first started. He picked up another
reed, and, with his breath now coming jerkily from his exertions
recited part of the same formula that he had used just before. "I
am in deadly fear. I have run nearly a mile over heavy sands. I
have killed a man and I must hide his body and get away
quick."</p>

<p>Then off he ran as he had just done before, but this time in
quite a different direction. In about three minutes he was back
again. He gave himself a moment's rest, picked up another reed,
and then again the blackness of the night swallowed him up. Five
times he repeated his manoeuvre and then, with every pore of his
body dripping with perspiration, threw himself down exhausted
upon the sands to rest.</p>

<p>"Now have I gone everywhere likely?" he panted. "I have marked
six places and I can think of nowhere else where he can possibly
have gone. Let me reason again calmly."</p>

<p>"Here, where I am now lying, is the centre of the circle, and
in whatsoever direction the body is hidden it cannot be farther
away than, say, a hundred and fifty yards. I am sure of it, for
he dared not have waited here too long." He was silent for a
minute.</p>

<p>"No, no," he muttered, slowly shaking his head. "I cannot be
making a mistake. I cannot be going wrong. It is incredible he
can have driven the body away with him in his own car, for then
his cushions would have been drenched with blood."</p>

<p>He stood up and stared round into the night. One by one he
ticked off the directions in which he had gone, and gradually the
hard tension of his features relaxed.</p>

<p>"Well," he remarked at last with a sigh, "that's all for the
present, I think, and directly it gets light it'll be Master
Swipes who'll have to do his bit. If there's any virtue in that
two-twelve-six, it'll have to show up then."</p>

<p>Throwing the ruck-sack over his shoulder and picking up the
remainder of the reeds, he gave one last look round and was about
to move away. Then a thought seemed suddenly to strike him, and
an amused smile crossed upon his face.</p>

<p>"Ah," he remarked with a laugh. "But now I was leaving out the
most unlikely of the likely spots. The Centre of the circle
itself. Of course, of course," and he drove a reed, the seventh
one, deep into the sand just where he stood.</p>

<p>He returned leisurely to where he had made his camp, and was
welcomed boisterously and with all evidences of delight by the
mongrel, Swipes. The dog had been left behind to mount guard over
his master's belongings, but his duties and responsibilities had
evidently been of an enforced nature, for he had been attached
securely by his chain to the tent pole.</p>

<p>"All right, old man," smiled the detective genially. "So I'm
better than no one now, am I, and that little affair of the two
pounds twelve and six is all passed over, is it? Well, well,
to-morrow we'll see what sort of dog you really are, and if the
money was just thrown away or, after all, well spent."</p>

<p>The following morning it was barely light when the detective
left his camp. He carried a spade with him and this time he was
accompanied by his mongrel companion. Neither had had anything to
eat and the dog was sniffing anxiously about, as if he, at all
events, could have done with a good meal.</p>

<p>Approaching the nearest of the seven places which on the
previous evening he had marked with his reeds, without even a
moment's delay the detective commenced to dig. Although the hour
was still so early, the sand was hot, but it was loose and easy,
and with wide sweeping movements he worked strenuously to clear
it away.</p>

<p>"Find it, Swipes. Good dog, find it now."</p>

<p>The animal was interested at once, and scratched and sniffed
as vigorously as the most exacting master could have desired. He
whined in great excitement ran backwards and forwards, and in a
few minutes was panting hard from the energy of his
exertions.</p>

<p>"Steady, old man," reproved Larose. "We may have a long way to
go yet, and I don't want you tired out at the beginning. Go easy
now."</p>

<p><br>
For a good half-hour the spade was plied vigorously round the
spot, and a wide circle of tumbled sand at length spoke
eloquently of Larose's work.</p>

<p>Then the detective paused and looked round, frowningily at the
havoc he had made.</p>

<p>"He can't have dug very deep," he muttered. "A couple of feet,
at most, is all I give him, and even allowing for the drifting,
Swipes would have smelt anything if it had been here."</p>

<p>He shook his head disappointedly and sighed.</p>

<p>"No, no, we've drawn blank so far, that's certain, but it
would have been too lucky to find things first go, so now for
spot number two."</p>

<p>He moved off about fifty yards, and the same process was gone
through in the vicinity of another reed.</p>

<p>But nothing eventuated there, either, and disappointment
awaited them also at reeds three and four.</p>

<p>By this time the sun was high up in the sky and the heat had
become very trying. Larose was drenched in perspiration, and the
dog was suffering too. He lay panting by his master, and his
lolling tongue and heaving sides told of the distress and
discomfort he was in.</p>

<p>"Come, come old chap," said the detective rather sadly. "I
think we'll both have a rest, and I guess a bit of a swim
wouldn't be a bad thing for you."</p>

<p>Shouldering his spade he moved off in the direction of the
lake, coming out upon the track just where the travellers had
been held up upon that eventful night.</p>

<p>The dog, with no ceremony, plunged at once into the water, and
his master, forgetting for the moment his disappointment, sat
down upon the bank and enviously regarded the animal's
relief.</p>

<p>Very soon, however, his thoughts were dragged back to the
search he had been making in the sand, and from the expression of
his face there could have been no doubt but that he was
crestfallen and uneasy at his lack of success.</p>

<p>He had been so certain that his grasp of the whole matter was
secure, and that his reasoning had been almost infallibly
mathematical and exact, that even at the half-stage of the
proceedings his failure puzzled him and in spite of the hope and
optimism of his nature, made him apprehensive and uneasy.</p>

<p>He was sure he could not be wrong and yet, and yet&mdash;his
eyes roved round and fell suddenly upon the last reed he had
planted the previous evening.</p>

<p>"Ah," he ejaculated thoughtfully, "the seventh reed&mdash;the
centre of the circle itself."</p>

<p>For a moment he looked at it listlessly and then, with a
startled exclamation of surprise, he rose abruptly to his feet.
He stood like a statue carved in stone, with his mouth wide open
and his eyes fixed. His hat was tilted back upon his head and the
scorching sun beat down unheeded on his face.</p>

<p>Suddenly he drew in a deep breath. He snapped his fingers
derisively.</p>

<p>"Gilbert, Gilbert," he exclaimed, "you're a fool. You're
nothing but a baby yet. The light! you never thought of that. Oh,
what an ass you've been!"</p>

<p>He shakily resumed his seat. "Now, let me think," he muttered.
"Yes, I quite forgot about the light and above all things I ought
to have remembered that. There was no moon. It was only a starlit
night, and in the darkness he could not have seen to bury the
body. He had to have light, for even in the frenzy of his haste
he would know he would have to do the burial with some care.</p>

<p>"Well, now, what lights had he? The hurricane lantern we know
had been overturned and probably all the oil in it was spilled.
Besides, too, in any case, he would probably have been too
flurried to relight it. No, I can rule that out. Then there was
Eli Barton's electric torch. Sam Gover said it was only a little
pocket one, and we don't know what happened to it when Eli fell.
Certainly it went out, for we know the place was in darkness
again until the spot-light was switched on. It is probable then
that he stopped to find it, and is it probable again, if he did,
that it would have answered his purpose? No again, both times
here. His haste was his obsession then, and Sam Gover tells us
there was light only from the torch when the finger was pressing
on the catch. So it would have been no good in any case, and
therefore the only lights that could have been of service to him
were the lights of his own car." The detective paused for a
moment, and, with the forefinger of his right hand outstretched,
solemnly elaborated his points. "Now let me be quite clear," he
went on. "I must make no mistake this time. He wanted light to
bury his third man that he had shot, and what surely would be
more natural than that he should use the lights of his own car?
He was in a desperate hurry, as we know, and the lights were all
handy there. Well supposing that were so, would he move the car
anywhere to a more secluded spot. No, I don't think so. It would
mean taking up more time, and apart from that it would mean also
handling a body fouled with dripping blood. Well, if he used his
car lights, then it is obvious he would bury the body within a
few yards of where the car stood."</p>

<p>Larose closed his eyes and thought.</p>

<p>"Yes, just near where the car stood," he muttered. "Just near
where the car stood."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch18">CHAPTER XVIII.</a></h2>

<p class="first">HE sprang up and became all animation again.
Every sign of his fatigue had passed and the anxiety that had
before possessed him had given way, once more, to confidence and
trust.</p>

<p>He whistled to the dog and ran quickly to where, on the
previous night, he had planted the seventh reed.</p>

<p>He was close to a bank of sand about three feet high.</p>

<p>"Yes, this must be the spot," he muttered. "Somewhere about
here," and he commenced to dig feverishly.</p>

<p>"Fetch him, Swipes. Good dog! Fetch him now," he cried.</p>

<p>Refreshed and invigorated by his bathe, the dog was eager,
too, and he nosed into the sand with all the expectation of being
close upon his prey.</p>

<p>Larose dug feverishly in a circle round the reed, but, as
before, he contented himself with shovelling away the sand for
about two feet in depth. The dog followed every movement of the
spade as if his very life depended upon what was going to happen
next. He sniffed and scratched excitedly wherever his master dug,
whining plaintively all the while.</p>

<p>Suddenly, however, the animal paused, and for a moment all the
haste and fury seemed to have passed completely out of him.</p>

<p>He stood stock still, with his head outstretched, and with one
front paw uplifted. Only his nostrils quivered, and they were
widely dilated. He looked fixedly into a hole Larose had just
made.</p>

<p>Then with a low growl he sprang forward, and commenced to
scratch furiously into the sand. A moment later, and he was
yelping in a perfect frenzy of excitement. A whole cascade of
sand was thrown out, and then, as if jerked up by the releasing
of a spring, there came into view&mdash;a dried and blackened
human hand.</p>

<p>Larose stood staring as if petrified, and then, as the dog
tugged out first an arm and then a shoulder, he sprang into the
hole and seizing the animal by his collar dragged him roughly
away.</p>

<p>But it was not without a struggle that Swipes would relinquish
his find, and the detective's boot had several times to be
brought into requisition before the dog could be made to
understand that, at any rate for the time, his services would be
no longer required.</p>

<p>Then, the animal disposed of, Larose, holding his breath in
his excitement, knelt down and very carefully proceeded to expose
the rest of a body.</p>

<p>As he had surmised, it had been interred only about two feet
below the surface of the sands. It was fully clothed, and at
first glance was obviously that of an adult man. There were no
signs of putrefaction, however, although all the same it was by
no means a pleasant thing to handle.</p>

<p>The detective realised instantly what had happened. No rain
had fallen on the Coorong for more than five months, and with no
moisture reaching it the body had become mummified by the intense
heat upon the sands. It was dry and shrivelled, and the flesh was
almost black in colour. The clothes hung on to it as if they were
many sizes too big.</p>

<p>Very gently Larose lifted it out, and laid it on the sands,
and then, for quite a long while he knelt over it and regarded it
without making a sound.</p>

<p>The dog had slunk away and was taking a bathe again.</p>

<p>"Hum," muttered Larose presently, with a grim smile. "Not the
slightest doubt about it, it's the man we want&mdash;and there's
not the slightest doubt, either, as to how he met his death." He
gently lifted up the dreadful-looking head. "Large bullet hole in
occipital region: that's what killed him, of course. Bullet came
out again, too, through parietal bone. Brain blown away by
revolver fired from close behind." He lifted one of the arms.
"Left elbow shattered&mdash;old Sam Gover's doing here. Coat and
shirt well soaked with blood all down left side, showing clearly
elbow-wound bled for long time before second shot was fired.
Quite probably half an hour. Now for the gentleman's pockets. I
may perhaps find something there!"</p>

<p>But to Larose's disappointment, the pockets yielded almost
nothing. A half-empty packet of cigarettes, a box of matches, an
old pocket knife, seven shillings in silver, and that was
all.</p>

<p>"Nothing doing," grumbled the detective, and then he grinned
amusedly to himself, "but still one could hardly expect he would
be carrying his visiting cards upon an expedition like that." He
looked disgustedly at the mummy. "And now, I suppose, I shall
have to strip him, but I think&mdash;I think I'll have a picture
first." He took out his watch. "But I must be quick," he added.
"Anyone may be coming along now."</p>

<p>He whistled up the dog, and together they ran hurriedly to the
tent. Swipes was evidently of opinion that there was more sport
in view, but was speedily disillusioned, and it was a very
disgusted animal that was made fast to the tent pole. Then Larose
fished out quite a fair sized camera from his portmanteau, and
unstrapping it as he ran, was soon back again by the body.</p>

<p><br>
Without wasting a moment, he quickly and methodically adjusted
his horrible find to the position he required.</p>

<p>He stretched out the shrivelled limbs, and to the dreadful
looking head he gave a pillow of sand. He was most particular to
get everything exactly as he wanted it, and then once satisfied,
without an instant's delay, he rapidly obtained three
impressions.</p>

<p>Next he took off his coat, and baring his arms to the elbows,
proceeded, not, however, without a certain expression of
repugnance, to go carefully over the body.</p>

<p>He stripped off all the clothing and laid the articles
carefully to one side. The body looked more hideous than ever
when naked, but Larose appeared now to have forgotten his
feelings of disgust. He was far too interested in his
examination.</p>

<p>"Small, spare man," he muttered thoughtfully, "undersized as
Sam Gover told us. Oval, narrow face, eyes set rather close
together. Nothing peculiar about the mouth, but front teeth very
prominent. Nose irregular, and appears to have been broken. Clean
shaven, hair brown, rather scanty at the temples. Probably man
about 35 to 40. Now, let me look at his hands. Hum&mdash;rather
interesting here. Small, almost refined. No particular manual
work. Skin of right forefinger thickened at one side. Accustomed,
evidently, to ride a good deal. Ah! Let me look at his boots.
Been driving a car, too. Yes, but did a lot of riding and rode
with a very short stirrup, I should say. Now, what does that
mean?" He shook his head and returned again to the body. He
passed his hands inquisitively round the blackened shoulders and
the neck. "Ah!" he muttered after a moment, "both collar bones
been broken sometime or other." He paused and went on
significantly. "At least once." He examined the limbs. "Bone of
right arm thickened in two places, as well. Good Lord, he's had a
leg broken some time too." A startled note of triumph swelled
into his voice. "Of course, of course," he exclaimed joyfully.
"He's been a jockey. Just the very build, no doubt about it, none
at all. I ought to have seen it at once. That's why he rode with
a short stirrup, of course."</p>

<p>He stood up and smiled as happily as a boy. "This will make it
much easier, Gilbert," he remarked. "You ought to have very
little difficulty now. You're really quite a clever fellow. But
we must have a couple more photographs quick, and
then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused in his congratulations and looked thoughtfully
round. His face dropped into cold hard lines again, his eyes
narrowed, and it was evident that he was thinking hard. "No, no,"
he murmured presently, "I can do as I think best now. I'm not a
policeman any more. I'm just on my own, the freelance, Gilbert
Larose."</p>

<p>He looked back on the body and his voice became very stern.
"There lies the one who can tell me everything," he said, "and in
good time I will make him speak, but for the present I shall have
to bury him again. Yes, it's best," he went on. "Publicity would
only warn the murderer, and might ruin everything just now."</p>

<p>He picked up the spade and, slightly deepening the hole, in a
few minutes had returned the mummy to its grave. Then he smoothed
over the sand about the place and, satisfied that no trace of his
work remained, picked up the clothing he had stripped from the
body, and, rolling it into a small bundle, returned quickly to
the tent.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, and with all despatch, he was sailing back
towards Goolwa.</p>

<p><br>
It was on the Monday that Larose had made the discovery of the
mummy under the sands.</p>

<p>On the following Thursday a pebble was thrown violently into
the pool of what constituted the daily and usually monotonous
life of Police Constable Abel Black, of the small township of
Meningie, South Australia.</p>

<p>A most zealous, capable officer of the law was Policeman
Black, and always on the alert for misdemeanours of every kind,
but so quiet and law-abiding was the district under his charge
that nothing ever seemed to happen that could give scope and
activity to the undoubted qualities that he possessed.</p>

<p>He was a very disappointed man.</p>

<p>In vain he studied the records of crime in South Australia; in
vain he kept himself well posted and up to date in all the
criminal happenings of the other States, in vain he looked for
evil-doers close at hand. Nothing, unhappily, seemed ever to
eventuate and his memoranda and reports to headquarters were
perforce colourless and tame in the extreme.</p>

<p>It was true the trouble over Eli Barton had stirred things up
a little, but there, too, his evil star had been in the
ascendant, and absolutely nothing of the case had passed directly
through his hands. Owing to its importance it had all been
conducted entirely from the headquarters of the police in
Adelaide, and he had been left completely out in the cold.</p>

<p>He was bicycling slowly along about a mile out of the
township, when suddenly a man stepped out from behind a tree at
the side of the road, and peremptorily called upon him to
halt.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch19"></a>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p class="first">POLICE CONSTABLE Abel Black pulled up at once
and then, without a word stood quietly by his machine and
critically regarded the individual who had accosted him. His
impressions were not prejudiced in the latter's favour.</p>

<p>In spite of the confident way in which the man had addressed
him there was nothing imposing or important about his appearance.
He wore dirty black overalls and looked, if anything, like a
motor mechanic. A straw hat, which, to say the least of it, was
old, served him for head covering, and his boots, the policeman
noticed, were well worn and had undoubtedly seen good service on
the tramp.</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you, please," reiterated the man, and then
he, in his turn, stared hard at the policeman, as if he were
examining him critically.</p>

<p>"Well," replied the policeman brusquely, at last, "what is it
you want?" He did not somehow like the way the man was addressing
him, for in spite of his general shabby appearance there seemed a
note of easy familiarity, and almost authority, in his tones.</p>

<p>"You can help me," went on the man smilingly. "You can give me
some information, if you will, please." He looked up and down the
road and then, quickly doffing his hat, he took off a small black
wig. He pulled himself erect, the smile dropped away from his
eyes, and stern hard lines formed about the corners of his
mouth.</p>

<p>"I'm Larose," he said tersely, "Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>The policeman opened his eyes very wide. He stared very hard
and took in a deep breath.</p>

<p>The man readjusted his wig, replaced the old straw hat, and
again smiled in a pleasant, easy way.</p>

<p>"You are Police Constable Abel Black," he continued. "You have
been in this neighbourhood for about three years, and therefore
you should be able to give me all the information I want. I have
made inquiries about you, and you are a man to be trusted. I
should not have dared to make myself known to you if you were not
so."</p>

<p>The policeman continued to stare very hard, but he made no
attempt to speak. He just stared and stared as if he would read
the fellow through. There was quite a minute's silence.</p>

<p>"Good," remarked Larose. "I see you're the man I want. Thought
before speech&mdash;that's the ticket every time."</p>

<p>The policeman looked coldly at him, but he spoke at last.</p>

<p>"What sentence did Barton get," he said very slowly, "for
shooting Sergeant McHains?"</p>

<p>"Ten years," replied Larose promptly, "and he'd have been a
lifer if we could have proved that it was his automatic that
fired the particular shot."</p>

<p>"Who defended Strangways in the Spinnet Vale murder case?"</p>

<p>"Pudson, K.C. Blackler was his junior."</p>

<p>"Show me your arm."</p>

<p>With a grin that was a delighted one, Larose bared his left
arm. "Excellent," he exclaimed brightly, "you should rise high in
the force, I see. It's a positive treat to meet anyone like you."
He thrust his arm under the policeman's eyes. "Yes, that's where
Rider hit me. The bullet passed through the flesh only and missed
the radial artery by a tenth part of an inch. You remember he
fired twice, and his second shot just grazed my shoulder. Like to
see that place, too?"</p>

<p>"No, no," replied the policeman, hastily, and now very red in
the face, "I am quite satisfied, sir, and I apologise for
questioning you, but you see&mdash;&mdash;" He drew himself up to
attention and saluted.</p>

<p>"Of course, I see," exclaimed Larose with enthusiasm, "and I
have the greatest admiration for your caution. I tell you, man,
you're not the ordinary policeman by a long chalk, and if ever
chance comes to you you'll go up on a wave. I'm sure of it. I,
Larose, say it, and you know I've had hundreds of you chaps under
me, in my time."</p>

<p>Policeman Black flushed deeper than ever in his delight, and
he eyed the great detective with all the devotion of a disciple
for his master.</p>

<p>"Now, Black," went on Larose confidingly, "I've left the Force
as you know, lad, and I'm here working on my own. It isn't very
much of you I want, just now, but it may lead to big things, and
I won't forget you, you may be sure, if it does." He paused for a
moment as if exactly to weigh his words. "What I want to know now
is this: Has anyone gone away from here lately, from about this
district I mean, say six or seven weeks ago&mdash;a medium sized,
rather spare man, about forty I should think, wears an old grey
coat, blue shirt, cord riding breeches and pig-skin leggings?
Rides with a very short stirrup, has been a jockey once, and can
drive a motor car."</p>

<p>"Yes, Sid Ferris," said the policeman promptly, and without a
moment's hesitation, "stable man and lad to Mr. Dice. Mr. Dice
lives at Mundulla and is the Chief Magistrate here."</p>

<p>"Ah," ejaculated the detective deeply, but as if he were not
at all surprised.</p>

<p>"They trained Black Wolf," went on the policeman, "for the
Christmas Cup. They skinned half the bookies in the State and won
a fortune over it, so everyone says."</p>

<p>"When did this Ferris leave here then?" asked the detective
meditatively, with a faraway look in his eyes.</p>

<p>Black thought for a moment. "Can't say for certain, but I know
he's not been back at all since the Cup was run, and that was on
Boxing Day." He sniffed rather grimly. "There are lots of people
here who've been wanting a word with him over that Cup affair.
Mr. Dice and he knew they had a fair snip for the race in Black
Wolf, and yet Ferris swore all along the horse was no good. He
put off everyone here from backing it." The policeman warmed up
in his indignation. "Why, only two days before the race, he told
everyone in the hotel here he couldn't understand why his master
was running the horse. He said it has no chance at all if it
ran."</p>

<p>"Oh," said Larose quickly, and with an intent gleam in his
eyes. "So he was in the hotel two days before the race, was
he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied, the policeman gloomily, "he was there just
before the dinner time. I happen particularly to remember it
because I was calling there myself about an application the
proprietor was making for extension of his licence. There was
going to be a dance there on Boxing Day and he wanted a late wine
permit. Ferris was in the bar at the time, and as I say, warned
everyone not to have a penny on Black Wolf. The liar! I should
have had a bit on myself, but for him."</p>

<p>"And when do you say this Ferris left the neighbourhood?"</p>

<p>The policeman shook his head. "I don't know that at all, but
I'm sure he's not been back since the Cup, or I should have heard
of it. As I say lots of folk were anxious to have a word with
him."</p>

<p>"Did he go to the Cup meeting himself, do you think?"</p>

<p>Black laughed sarcastically. "Sure he did. Why, everyone knows
they won a fortune over it, and Ferris had had all the riding of
the horse in his gallops. He wouldn't have missed the race for
worlds."</p>

<p>Larose was silent a long time.</p>

<p>"What sort of a reputation has this Mr. Dice got?" he asked
presently.</p>

<p>The policeman spoke deliberately. "Well respected and liked,
too, before this Black Wolf affair. He's the chief magistrate
here, as I say. He's proud and very reserved, and keeps himself
very much to himself. We never see him much about here, except on
session days, but his niece often comes to the township."</p>

<p>"What's she like?" asked Larose.</p>

<p>"Very nice and very pretty," replied the policeman. "A real
little lady if ever I saw one."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Dice well-to-do, do you think?"</p>

<p>"Plenty of money now since the race, but on the rocks before
that, if there's truth in all the rumours that were about. It is
believed generally that he was in Queer Street until his win on
Black Wolf pulled him through."</p>

<p>"Was the Black Wolf business kept purposely dark, do you
think?"</p>

<p>The policeman sniffed contemptuously. "Not a doubt about it,"
he replied. "The horse was a cast-iron certainty. He was just
kept bottled up for months. We know now he had been tried
secretly to beat Basil's Pride, and they just timed the training
to the very hour. Bah," he exclaimed bitterly, "they knew what
they were about, and they arranged it to get a hundred to
one."</p>

<p>"How long has Ferris been with Mr. Dice, do you know?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't know that. Donkey years, I believe. I understand
they knew one another long before Dice came here."</p>

<p>"Has Dice been on sheep all his life?"</p>

<p>"The greater part, I think, but he went soldiering once. He
was wounded in South Africa, they say&mdash;in the Boer War."</p>

<p>"He's a big man, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes, as big and strong as a bull."</p>

<p>Again a deep and expressive "Ah," from Larose, and then again
a long silence.</p>

<p>"What motor car has he got?"</p>

<p>"He has a Punic now, but he had only a Kent before."</p>

<p>"Did Ferris drive the car often?"</p>

<p>"No, only every now and then. When he came into the township
he generally hacked it on Mr. Dice's grey mare."</p>

<p>"How did he dress?"</p>

<p>"Always the same as you described. Old slouch hat, old grey
jacket, blue shirt, and breeches and leggings. Always untidy and
looked as if he had never had a wash. He used to ride all hunched
up and with a short stirrup, too, as you say."</p>

<p>"Well," said Larose meditatively after a pause. "I think
that's all just now, and thank you very much." He looked
significantly at Abel Black. "I needn't, of course, ask you not
to let a soul know I have spoken to you or have been anywhere
about here." The policeman nodded his head. "Oh, one thing more,
please. I suppose you don't happen to know if there is any job
going about anywhere that I could take as an excuse for hanging
about the township. That chap Ferris might come back any day you
see, and I want to get a look at him to make certain he's the man
I want."</p>

<p>The policeman grinned. "They want a waiter at the hotel," he
replied, "if that's at all in your line, and I believe a cook as
well."</p>

<p>Larose smiled back as if in amusement, too. "Oh, I make a very
excellent waiter, my friend," he laughed, "and at a pinch I'm a
bit of a cook, too. But both those jobs would tie me down too
much and keep me too much indoors. I want something more outdoors
so that I can keep an eye on people as they pass through the
township."</p>

<p>"Well," said the policeman promptly, "they want an odd man at
the garage, I know. Travers is very hard pushed just now, and
he's advertised several times for a man, and can't get one, but
it's some one who understands cars they want," and he looked
doubtfully at Larose.</p>

<p>"The very thing," replied the detective gaily. "I'm a
first-class mechanic in the motor line."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch20"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<p class="first">"I'M going straight off to apply for that garage
job," Larose told Constable Black, "and if I get it please don't
come near me at all when I'm there. I'll have another yarn,
maybe, in a day or two. In any case, I'll see you before I leave
the place, and you shall know how I've got on."</p>

<p>A few days later and Travers, the proprietor of the Meningie
Motor Works was almost hourly congratulating himself upon the
very excellent mechanic he had recently acquired. An intelligent,
hardworking, and pleasant man, his new employee seemed to give
satisfaction everywhere. He was quick, capable, and obliging, and
thoroughly understood his work. It is true he had all along given
out that Punic cars were his speciality, but his acquaintance
with all cars in general was surprising, and he was seldom long
at fault in locating any trouble or dealing with any difficult
and intricate repair.</p>

<p>He seemed, too, to have the gift of pleasing everyone, and
quickly made friends everywhere. Bert Tullock, the chauffeur of
Mr. James Dice, was one of the very first to come under his
spell.</p>

<p>In the ordinary way Tullock was a surly, uncommunicative sort
of man, with never a good word for anyone. He had no friends, for
no one seemed to be able to get on with him.</p>

<p>But Beeton, for such was the new mechanic's name, was most
cordial to him upon the very first occasion that he came into the
township and, a small job to Mr. Dice's car having being got over
a friendly suggestion had been put forward for a quiet
adjournment for a drink.</p>

<p>And it was not one only that was stood the chauffeur. There
was no meanness anywhere about Beeton, and Tullock went off
thinking what a fine fellow he had struck.</p>

<p>After that Tullock always made an excuse to call in at the
garage when ever he came into Meningie, which he did almost every
day, and his friend, however busy as he was, somehow always found
time for a few minutes' chat. Soon Tullock was confiding all his
troubles to him, and no one could have been kinder or more
sympathetic than Beeton was.</p>

<p>Tullock, it appeared, had come from Brisbane, and he badly
wanted to get back there because of a girl. But he had not the
money for the expensive journey, and the devil of it was, he
wailed, he could never get enough out of his wages to save.</p>

<p>Then an idea came suddenly one day to Beeton, and with no
beating about the bush he at once advanced it to the chauffeur.
He would lend Tullock the money, he said; he had got &pound;20
saved up, but it was upon certain conditions, of course.</p>

<p>First he must swear to pay him back and second he must put
him, Beeton, in the way of getting his, Tullock's job.</p>

<p>Tullock opened his eyes wide at his friend's generosity, and
inwardly he marvelled at the simplicity of the chap, but agreeing
on the spot to both conditions he screwed up his face violently
and swore fearful oaths upon the matter of paying back.</p>

<p>It was soon all arranged. At Beeton's instigation Tullock was
to clear out suddenly without notice, but before doing so he was
to tamper with the magneto of Mr. Dice's car and do certain other
little disarrangements that Beeton carefully pointed out.</p>

<p>So, it came to pass that Mr. Dice awoke one morning minus a
chauffeur, and, when he went to get his car out&mdash;behold, the
wretched thing would not go.</p>

<p>In great annoyance he rang up the Meningie garage with the
request that some one should be sent out at once, and it was the
mechanic Beeton, of course, because of his special knowledge of
Punic cars, who was immediately despatched.</p>

<p>The man was most respectful in his demeanour, and it was
evident he was not a little over-awed by the importance of being
brought in personal contact with the Chief Magistrate of the
district, but he at once set about going over the car in a
methodical and workmanlike way.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid it's been tampered with," remarked Mr. Dice
quietly. "It was quite all right when I came in yesterday, and,
if anyone has misused it, it's that man, Tullock, who, for some
reason has taken himself away." His voice hardened perceptibly as
he spoke.</p>

<p>For the moment the mechanic made no reply. He appeared to be
entirely engrossed with the car and, his professional instincts
aroused, he seemed to have no thought now for anything else.</p>

<p>Mr. Dice watched him critically. "Quite a good man," was his
mental comment. "He knows his work and he'll soon find out what's
wrong."</p>

<p>There certainly may have been no doubt that the mechanic knew
his work, but, in those particular seconds, it happened that he
was not actually thinking about the car at all. It was the
personality of James Dice that was alone occupying all his
thoughts.</p>

<p>Larose was saturating himself in the atmosphere of 'a
suspect,' and, with every sense upon the alert, was endeavouring
to grip something of the psychology of the man who was standing
by his side.</p>

<p>"Hum," he muttered to himself. "Yes, decidedly a possibility.
A man of strong character, no doubt; strong and very determined.
Bold, too, and proud. A secretive man, and, as Black said, very
reserved. Perhaps quite kind generally, but a hard man probably
when crossed. Undoubtedly capable and enterprising, but rather
hasty, I should say, in his decisions."</p>

<p>"You won't be long, do you think?" here broke in Mr. Dice with
a frown. "I am going to Stratalbyn to-day."</p>

<p>"Ah," thought on Larose, "fidgety is he, and apt to get
flurried. Now that's his weakness, I suspect&mdash;not a well
balanced mind."</p>

<p>The mechanic looked up. "Nothing much wrong, I think, sir.
There's a short circuit somewhere, but I'll soon have it right.
Still, it's a good thing I came up anyhow. The radiator wants
tightening a lot; the nuts are quite loose at the bottom
there."</p>

<p>Mr. Dice's face lost its frown. "Good," he said, "and the
quicker you are the better, for I'm very late as it is."</p>

<p>In a quarter of an hour at most, the mechanic had got
everything right and, looking very pleased with himself, he drove
the car out of the garage and round to the front door. He assured
Mr. Dice that there would now be no more trouble.</p>

<p>"You've been very quick," remarked the magistrate
pleasantly.</p>

<p>The mechanic smiled with pride. "Well, I know every bolt and
nut of this model, sir, and I can tell in a second where anything
is wrong. I've had to do with Punics now for years."</p>

<p>Mr. Dice regarded the man thoughtfully. "I suppose," he said,
"I suppose you are not keen on a chauffeur's job, are you?"</p>

<p>"But I am, sir," replied the mechanic eagerly. "It's just what
I do want. I've only been with Mr. Travers a little while, and he
knows that I'm only there temporarily. I've got a weak chest and
the doctors tell me I must be as much as possible in the open
air."</p>

<p>Mr. Dice looked pleased. "Well, I shall be in Meningie
to-morrow," he said at once, "and I'll call round then and see
Mr. Travers. You may be just the very man I want."</p>

<p>Two days later, and Gilbert Larose had taken up his duties as
handy-man and chauffeur to James Dice, Esq., Senior Magistrate of
the District of Meningie.</p>

<p><br>
James Dice was by no means a repulsive type of man. On the
contrary, he had quite a pleasant face, and, as his physiognomy
denoted, in disposition he was neither cruel or unkind. He was
undeniably good looking. He held his head up high, and there was
a quiet dignity about him that suggested strength and purpose and
a temper well under control. In manner, he was proud and
reserved.</p>

<p>As chairman of the bench of magistrates, he occupied an
important position in the district, and if he did not trouble to
form any friendships he was still well respected by all who were
brought in contact with him. He was considered a stern and just
man, but one who was taciturn and unsociable by nature and who
preferred to be left alone.</p>

<p>But there was a side to his character that the public never
saw, nor even suspected that he possessed.</p>

<p>Temperamentally he was not a normal man.</p>

<p>Twenty and odd years before, he had received a bad head injury
in the Boer war and he had never afterwards been the same man. He
suffered from violent headaches, and in times of excitement or
great mental stress he would become almost unbalanced in his
mind. Then he would altogether lose the right perspective of
things, and would consider everything that he did himself as
perfectly necessary and right.</p>

<p>And he had been very much in this condition just prior to the
running of the Adelaide Christmas Cup.</p>

<p>He had been in desperate straits financially, and almost at
the very end of his tether. He had been gambling heavily on the
Stock Exchange, and everything he had touched had gone wrong. His
station was mortgaged up to the very hilt, and he was in dire
need of ready money.</p>

<p>Ruin had been staring him in the face, and the breaking up of
his home had been imminent, and a matter seemingly only of
weeks.</p>

<p>In all his troubles there had been only one bright
spot&mdash;his gelding, Black Wolf.</p>

<p>Here it seemed he had been served by an almost miraculous
chance for, with a life's experience of horses, he was sure he
had never possessed such a good one before, and he believed that
it was quite possible all his losses might yet be retrieved by
one great gamble upon the turf.</p>

<p>Secretly he had tried out the gelding to be a marvel of
stamina and speed. He had bought him as a foal running with his
mother, and he had got him almost for a mere song. Unbroken until
nearly three years old, it had only been intended then that the
gelding should be used as a hack. The horse was quite commonplace
to look at, and it was some time before Dice had become aware of
what a treasure he possessed. Indeed, it was almost by accident
that it was discovered how very much out of the ordinary the
animal was. His master's suspicions being once aroused, however,
it was soon realised that Black Wolf could go like the wind and,
pitted against other horses on the station he had simply
smothered them with the greatest of ease. Recourse being then
made to the clock, it was found he could negotiate long gallops
in almost record time.</p>

<p>Hardly still believing that it could be his good fortune to
possess such a potential champion, Dice had secretly borrowed
Basil's Pride, a notable performer in both States, from a cousin
of his in Melbourne, quickly to find that his most rosy
expectations were confirmed.</p>

<p>Black Wolf, at even weights, could leave the Pride almost as
if the latter were standing still.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch21"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<p class="first">APPALLED then by the magnitude of the
possibilities that might lie before him, with such a horse as
Black Wolf, Dice had not breathed a word to any outsiders, and
indeed only one of his station hands, Sid Ferris, had been a
complete sharer of the secret with him.</p>

<p>With little time to spare, the gelding had been entered for
the forthcoming Adelaide Christmas Cup, and, getting in at the
featherweight of six stone seven, his success had seemed
absolutely assured.</p>

<p>Of only one of the other horses entered had they any fear.
Abimeleck, the inter-State horse, alone, they thought, could by
any possibility upset their calculations. But Abimeleck, they
were certain, would never run. Dice had received secret
information about him from his cousin in Melbourne, and he had
been advised that the crack's legs had given out.</p>

<p>So they had not worried about Abimeleck, and had slept their
sleeps in peace, dreaming happily of the great fortune that was
so surely coming to them both.</p>

<p>Then, like a bomb, had come the news that Abimeleck had been
put on rail for Adelaide, and was an almost certain runner for
the Cup.</p>

<p>Dice thought and dreamt of Abimeleck and Eli Barton day and
night long, and the brooding over his seemingly lost fortune
became an absolute obsession with him. He grew positively
ill.</p>

<p>Then, two days before the race, Sid Ferris had gone into
Meningie, and at the hotel there had heard some one saying that
Eli Barton was coming through the Coorong that night. He had
rushed back to his master with some wild idea in his mind about
kidnapping the old man and preventing him from getting to
Adelaide. It was notorious what a martinet old Barton was about
his horses, and that under no circumstances would Abimeleck be
allowed to start until he had been inspected by the owner himself
just prior to the running of the race.</p>

<p>James Dice had at first received with great contempt the very
idea that they could successfully kidnap Eli Barton and not
afterwards be found out, and then, suddenly, the dreadful thought
had flashed through him that it might be quite possible to get
rid of the old man altogether.</p>

<p><br>
For a moment he had put away the idea as bordering on madness,
but the deep straits that he was in had forced it back again and
again, into his mind, and at last, in less even than an hour from
its first conception, he was feverishly making preparations for
its execution.</p>

<p>What then happened we already know. He had shot both Eli
Barton and Sam Gover, and then, in dreadful panic to cover up his
tracks, he had shot Ferris, too. At the time he had been almost
mad with terror, but the drive home had calmed and steadied him,
and reaching his station just before the dawn his old confidence
began to take hold of him again.</p>

<p>He had brought death to three men but he would never be found
out, he told himself, for he had left no traces behind. He had
only to sit tight and the whole night's doings would be only like
the memory of some dreadful dream. Hopeful, therefore, in his
expected certain immunity, he very quickly pulled himself
together and when, only two days later, Black Wolf so gallantly
headed the Christmas Cup field there was practically no more
delighted man in all Australia.</p>

<p>All his money troubles were over at last. Life was all rosy
again, and so secure did he feel himself that not even the
subsequent discovery of Eli Barton's body, and the astonishing
resurrection, too, of Sam Gover, caused him much uneasiness or
alarm.</p>

<p>There was, however, one little fly in his ointment; just one
little misgiving when he allowed himself to dwell on the
happenings of that dreadful night. One little possibility that
somehow or other he might one day be found out.</p>

<p>He had a morbid fear of the possible activities of the Sydney
detective, Gilbert Larose. Of course the idea was all
foolishness, he told himself repeatedly, but somehow or other he
could never completely shake it off. It was impressed by peculiar
circumstances deep into his subconscious mind.</p>

<p>Some years before two men sitting near him had been conversing
about a murder that had just then occurred in a back street in
one of the slums of Sydney, and one of them had remarked that the
perpetrator of the crime would certainly never be found out, for
he had not left behind him even the very ghost of a clue. But the
other man had shaken his head emphatically and warned the first
speaker not to be too sure, for Larose, he said, had been put
upon the case. Larose, he went on to insist, would be certain in
time to discover everything, for Larose had got powers and senses
that no one else possessed. Larose could reason backwards much
easier than other people could reason forward, and, as for clues,
well&mdash;Larose would see things that had been invisible to
every one else, and he could mark even the shadow that a murderer
had left upon the wall.</p>

<p>So, when later he had learnt of the strenuous efforts that
both Sam Gover and the Times of Adelaide were making to get hold
of Larose, he had not been without decided qualms of uneasiness,
but he had been comforted and reassured again when he had heard
of their lack of success, and with the quiet passing of the weeks
he had begun calmly to believe that the whole inquiry had died
down.</p>

<p>He had smiled grimly to himself that he should so strangely
have got to know Sam Gover and young Barton, and for the elder
man he had soon acquired quite a liking. As for Stanley Barton,
it amused him considerably when he noticed the young man's
admiration for pretty Margaret, and in his own mind he thought it
would not be at all a bad thing if the affair became serious.</p>

<p>But of Larose, what of Larose? What were the detective's hopes
and intentions when he had so manoeuvred that he had been taken
into the employ of James Dice? We may say at once that he was
supremely confident of nothing. He certainly believed that Dice
had been concerned in the murder. He was almost sure of it.
Indeed, everything was pointing that way. But still, for too long
Larose had been associated with crime to allow his mind to jump
hastily to any unestablished conclusion. There was nothing
absolutely definite, as yet, to link up Dice with the murder.
There was no actual proof that after all he had been the other
man by the car. Sid Ferris might have had an entirely different
accomplice and been acting quite independently of his master.
Larose had no evidence as yet, he knew, that would incriminate
James Dice, in a Court of Law, and so like a wise old dog he was
prepared to nose on farther along the trail.</p>

<p><br>
He was sure that a man who was not an habitual criminal and
yet who had suddenly committed two murders could not possibly
pass on through his life quite unaltered. To the experienced eye
he would at times be certain to exhibit the undoubted signs that
are inseparable from a watchful attitude.</p>

<p>Also Larose thought that if James Dice were really the man he
wanted, he might pick up some definite clue in James Dice's house
itself. For one thing, he badly wanted the revolver that the
murderer had used, and he believed that there was no reason why
it should have been made away with. It would be a big,
old-fashioned one, he knew, of large calibre. Just such a one as
might have been used twenty years back in the Boer War, in South
Africa, where James Dice had been. Then there was the hurricane
lantern he would expect to find. Not that he could make very much
of that, for hurricane lanterns, he knew, were plentiful on
stations and farms, but still it would help him and encourage him
to go on. Also, he wanted to learn what the station hands thought
of Sid Ferris, and what their explanation was for the man's
sudden going away. It was possible, too, he thought, that he
might diplomatically ferret out something which would throw light
upon Dice's movements on the night of the murder. The night would
probably be remembered, because of its being so near to the
actual day of the Christmas Cup race.</p>

<p>So Gilbert Larose entered upon his services at Mundulla
Station with both the hope and the expectation of finding
something that might lead him nearer to the end, and, with all
the thoroughness of his nature, he proceeded at once to carry out
all his duties so pleasantly and so efficiently that he became a
general favourite almost within a few hours.</p>

<p>He kept his eyes and his ears open every time, and he absorbed
information like a sponge.</p>

<p>But with the master, James Dice&mdash;with the man he had come
to shadow, it could not truthfully be said that at first he made
much progress. He had just been bidden good morning, been given
his orders, been asked to do this and do that, and nothing
more.</p>

<p>From the very beginning, the detective was puzzled. There was
certainly no sign of any uneasy watchfulness about James Dice. No
appearance that he had any worry on his mind. He was just a
quiet, thoughtful, and reserved man, and that was all.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch22"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<p class="first">WHEN Larose had been on Dice's station a full
week he had reluctantly to admit that so far, but for two things,
he had drawn absolutely blank, and of the value of those two
things even he could not be very sure.</p>

<p>Firstly, he had found the hurricane lamp, or, to be exact, he
had found two hurricane lamps. But there was no mystery or secret
about them at all. They were both openly in use every night. The
kitchen had one and the stable had another. The latter he had
examined most carefully, but there were no signs of accident or
ill-usage about it, and both lamps were the very spit of one
another.</p>

<p>"Not much to go on here," he remarked thoughtfully to himself,
"but still&mdash;still, finding them at all is certainly better
than their not being here."</p>

<p>The second discovery, however seemed much more important, and
made him think a lot. James Dice had bought a book on Medical
Jurisprudence. It had come by post from Adelaide. Larose had
brought it up himself with the letters from Meningie, and he had
taken the liberty to stop en route and unwrap it to see what kind
of book it was.</p>

<p>Now what on earth could Dice be wanting a book on Medical
Jurisprudence for, he asked himself, and in the intervals of
reading it why was he always so particular to put it in his
pocket and not leave it about? One morning when Dice was having
his bath Larose slipped like a shadow into his bedroom and saw
the book by the bedside. He balanced it for a moment on the palm
of his open hand, and then with a quick jerk allowed the book to
open itself. It opened right in the middle of a chapter on
'gun-shot wounds.' Holding his breath, he shut it up and tried it
again. It opened on exactly the same page. With a low whistle,
but tempting fortune no farther, he replaced the book and stole
noiselessly from the room.</p>

<p>Now here was certainly something very odd, he told himself,
when a few seconds later he had gained the sanctuary of the
garage, and was apparently intent only on the car. Why should
Dice be interested in gun-shot wounds, or why, indeed, in Medical
Jurisprudence at all? He went back in his mind over the
temperament and character that he believed the murderer of Eli
Barton and Sid Ferris could undoubtedly possess. Bold, strong,
and forceful to a point, and then&mdash;then with a streak of
weakness in him that would give him in a lightning flash
completely over to panic and to fear.</p>

<p>Did James Dice answer accurately to this supposed temperament?
He shrugged his shoulders. He must wait and see.</p>

<p>On the eighth day after Larose's arrival at the station he
drove Miss Bevan and her uncle into Meningie. The girl had some
shopping to do, and Mr. Dice some business of his own too, in the
township. It was a bright pleasant morning, with a cool breeze
tempering the air. Margaret was in the happy mood so usual to
her, and chatted gaily to her uncle as they drove along. The
latter seemed in wonderfully good spirits, too, and several times
Larose heard him laugh at something the girl was saying. The
detective frowned as he listened to them. Surely things for him,
at any rate, were not fitting in at all too well.</p>

<p>They pulled up at the Post Office and the uncle and niece went
in. A minute or so later, just as they were coming out, they
almost ran into a tall, professional-looking man.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Doctor!" exclaimed James Dice genially, "and how's the
world serving you?"</p>

<p>"Excellently," smiled back the local medical man, taking off
his hat admiringly to Miss Bevan, "at least from my point of
view. There's quite a little sickness about just now."</p>

<p>They chatted lightly for a few moments, and then the doctor
made ready to go.</p>

<p>"Oh, by the by," he remarked, as if in an afterthought, "poor
Black's very seriously ill."</p>

<p>"Policeman Black?" asked Miss Bevan interested at once. "Why
what's the matter with him?"</p>

<p>"He's got double pneumonia," replied Doctor Stark gravely,
"and if I'd seen you yesterday I should have said he was going to
die. This morning, however, he's a shade better, and it's
possible now he may pull through."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry," exclaimed the girl. "He's always so very
polite to us, and everyone likes him, too."</p>

<p>"Yes, he's quite a decent sort, isn't he? But as I say the
poor chap's very bad now. He's been delirious for two days." The
doctor turned to James Dice. "Extraordinary thing, delirium, Mr.
Dice," he went on. "When these poor old brains of ours go wrong
we get some really wonderful fancies into our minds. We live in
new worlds all so very different from those of our real own. For
example, there's this poor old Black here. He's just, as you
know, a very commonplace policeman, and when he's well his life's
probably as drab and colourless as anyone's could be. He has
quite a boring time then, I expect, but now&mdash;now that he's
ill he's an individual of a very different degree. Wonderful
things are happening to him all day long, and he's mixing with
the very top-notchers of his profession. He keeps on thinking
that he's holding a conversation with that Sydney detective,
Gilbert Larose. 'Very proud to meet you, Mr. Larose,' he's been
saying. 'Very pleased, indeed, to help you in any way. Yes, I'll
tell you about every person in the neighbourhood that you want to
know. We'll find out everything, we will, for we are men who
think, you and I.' Very pathetic, isn't it? For, as I say, in
reality old Black's one of those cold, stodgy men who are just
town-stuck policemen, from top to toe. He'll never be anything
better, or anything worse."</p>

<p>"Poor man," exclaimed Miss Margaret. "I am so sorry, but does
he know how ill he is, Doctor Stark?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, young lady," smiled back the doctor. "I tell you
he's quite happy at present, and in the seventh heaven because he
imagines he's working with Larose."</p>

<p>And all this while, Beeton, the chauffeur, was standing close
beside them with the cold and deferential pose of a well-trained
gentleman's servant. He had no interest, of course, in the
conversation of his betters&mdash;no, not he. He was just an
automaton at so much wage per week, and what his employers said
or thought was only of as much moment to him as what was then
happening in Jerusalem or far off Timbuctoo. So he did not, of
course, see the strong face of his master blanch and harden, he
did not notice the quick movement of the eyebrows, he did not
hear the sharp intake of breath, and the embarrassed cough, as of
a man who had been abruptly startled into confusion. No, he
noticed none of these things for was he not just an ordinary and
commonplace chauffeur, with his mind obsessed only with thoughts
of bolts and nuts.</p>

<p>Dr. Stark lifted his hat and smilingly bade them good-bye;
Miss Bevan went about her shopping, and Mr. Dice, after a
moment's hesitation, walked slowly into the Meningie Hotel.</p>

<p><br>
Beeton garaged the car, and then, being free for half an hour,
himself turned into the hotel bar to get something to drink.</p>

<p>"Morning. Beeton," said the landlord, "and how are you getting
on in your new place?"</p>

<p>"Very nicely, thank you, sir," replied the chauffeur. "I'm
getting on fine."</p>

<p>The landlord jerked his thumb over his shoulder. "What's the
matter with the governor?" he whispered. "He's had a couple of
brandies just now, and that's not like him."</p>

<p>"Oh," replied Beeton indifferently. "He's quite all right that
I know."</p>

<p>There were certainly two very disturbed men going home that
morning in the car, but certainly neither of them showed it.
James Dice had pulled himself together very quickly, and there
was outwardly no trace of the dismay that had surged into his
heart. It had jarred him terribly, for the moment, when Dr. Stark
had told them of the policeman and Larose, for he divined
instantly what had happened. The policeman was betraying in his
delirium that Larose was in the neighbourhood, and that he and
the great Sydney detective had met.</p>

<p>Now the master of Mundulla station was anything but a stupid
man, and there were no doubts whatever in his mind as to why the
detective had come. He was there after the destroyer of Eli
Barton, and he was believing that in the vicinity of Meningie the
murderer would be found. But how was it, James Dice considered
anxiously, that they had managed to get hold of the detective
after all, and on whose behalf was he now taking up the case?</p>

<p>Was it through the Times of Adelaide, or through old Gover
that the man had come down? In any case, surely he ought to have
heard of it, for, of course, Sam Gover must know. Sam Gover was
his friend&mdash;he smiled in grim amusement here&mdash;and it
was a shabby thing that he had been kept in the dark.</p>

<p>Then he fell to weighing up what possible danger could
threaten him, even if Larose were in Meningie on the case. Surely
there was nothing that could possibly be discovered now to
connect him with the murder. Then why on earth should he be
afraid?</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch23"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="first">WELL before the return journey was accomplished,
the master of Mundulla had lulled himself into a state of
confidence again and by the time they finally reached home and
Beeton was deferentially holding open the car door, there was no
trace at all of any unusual emotion upon his normally placid
face.</p>

<p>But if James Dice had been successful in masking the disturbed
conditions of his mind, so also had Larose been successful in
concealing his. His face was equally as calm and impressive as
his master's, although in his mind, too, gaunt fears had taken
shape.</p>

<p>For the moment, when he heard the doctor speaking, he had been
absolutely appalled that Dice should have been so unluckily put
on his guard. It was the worst thing that could have happened, he
swore to himself, for he would be dealing now with a man wary and
suspicious at every turn. All his investigations would be
hampered, and he would get no chance whatever of making the quiet
searches over the house that he had intended. His trump card all
along had been that if Dice were really the guilty party he would
be so lulled into security by the passing of the weeks that he
would be less likely to conceal evidence that might become vital
and conclusive to connect him with the crime. Yes, the whole
business was a terrible setback to all his chances of success,
and he was certainly working under an unlucky star. And then it
came to him, on the other side of the account, that it might not
be such an unfortunate thing after all. At any rate, he knew now
that he was not wasting his time, and that he was absolutely on
the right track.</p>

<p>James Dice was the guilty party sure enough, and it would be
only the question of bringing things home to him now. He, Larose,
need no longer have any misgivings. He could go straight forward
in absolute confidence now. He must concentrate, he must reason,
he must force himself to uncover the traces that, surely, could
not possibly be all hid.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was another thing, and he felt quite elated
here. He had proved definitely that his estimation of the
murderer's character was quite correct. All along he had
believed, in spite of the apparently bold and fearless manner in
which the crime had been carried out, that the perpetrator of it
had a white streak somewhere.</p>

<p>That evening Mr. Dice was giving a small dinner party to some
men friends of his, and Beeton, the chauffeur, was called upon to
help carry the dishes to the dining-room door. From time to time
he heard a lot of the conversation that was going on, and once,
to his amusement, they were talking about the great Sydney
detective, Larose.</p>

<p>"But I tell you, man," he heard a protesting voice say,
"Larose never gives up a case until he's absolutely pulled off
from it, like a terrier from a rat. He'll hang on to it for
months and months, and nothing discourages him or puts him off.
Every case he's put on to becomes an absolute mania with him, and
he's then really a sort of madman himself. I've met him several
times in Court, and know exactly what he's like."</p>

<p><br>
The chauffeur, Beeton, swore gently under his breath. "I
really must be a devil of a fellow," he muttered, "but I wonder
now who is this fine gentleman here."</p>

<p>After dinner Mr. Dice sent for his chauffeur to explain to
them some point about the gearing of the Punic car, and Beeton
answered so intelligently that the guests afterwards
congratulated their host upon the acquisition he had got.</p>

<p>Trundle, a well-known barrister from New South Wales, was most
emphatic in his praise. "But what's his name, Dice?" he asked
suddenly, as if in an afterthought.</p>

<p>"Beeton," replied his host. "Christian name, Thomas, I
believe, but why do you want to know?"</p>

<p>"Well," said the barrister slowly, "when he was speaking to
you just now I had a peculiar feeling somehow that I had met him
somewhere before. Beeton, Beeton," he muttered and then he shook
his head. "No, his name's not in any way familiar. It must have
been his voice that reminded me of some one else, but I can't
remember who the deuce it was now."</p>

<p>Now no one could possibly have made a greater mistake than did
James Dice when he imagined so fondly that, as far as the
detective Larose was concerned, his feelings henceforth would be
at worst only those of contemptuous and indifferent
annoyance.</p>

<p>Directly he was alone by himself again, he began to worry, and
the very next day following upon his visit to Meningie with his
niece, he realised, to his disgust, that he was thinking of the
detective to the exclusion of everybody and everything else.</p>

<p>In spite of the seeming impossibility of any discoveries being
made by Larose, even if he were in the neighbourhood and hot upon
his trail, it came most unpleasantly home to the master of
Mundulla that all his one-time certainty of security nevertheless
was lost, and that his peace of mind hung now only by a very
frail and insecure thread.</p>

<p>He wondered suddenly also whether he were not already being
shadowed, and the very horror of this last idea was quite
unnerving. It gripped him like a palsy, as, with his waking
moment, he first thought of it.</p>

<p>He instantly got out of bed, and, snatching out his race
glasses from a drawer, went out on to the veranda just as he was,
and took a good sweeping view round. He was really not expecting
to see anything unusual, and there was certainly nothing in sight
that should have disturbed him, but still he noticed not without
considerable uneasiness, from how many different places a hidden
man could be keeping watch over the house.</p>

<p>Turning round, he saw that Beeton, the chauffeur, was looking
at him. The man was busy cleaning the car just by the open garage
door, but directly he noticed his master observing him he touched
his cap respectfully before going on with his work.</p>

<p>"Ah," thought James Dice suddenly, "now if anything ever
happens, that man might be of great use to me." He strolled over
to the garage.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Beeton," he said pleasantly. "Mind now and
always look carefully over the tyres for thorns. There are always
plenty about here."</p>

<p>"I always do, sir," replied the chauffeur. "I found two in
them yesterday."</p>

<p>"That's right," replied his master, "They gave a lot of bother
this time last year. By-the-bye," he went on casually, after a
moment's pause, "did you notice a strange man up on the road a
little while ago? I thought I saw some one there by the far fence, but he doesn't appear to have come up to the house."</p>

<p>"No, sir," replied Beeton, slowly, shaking his head. "There's
been no one on the road since I've been here, and that must have
been more than an hour now."</p>

<p>"Oh, well," commented James Dice lightly, "I must have been
mistaken, then, but I certainly thought I saw some one there. You
see, Beeton," he went on, dropping his voice, "as a magistrate
here I have necessarily to administer the law." He shrugged his
shoulders and smiled dryly. "And that doesn't always tend to make
one popular, now does it?"</p>

<p>Beeton grinned back intelligently, as if he quite
understood.</p>

<p>"So," his master went on, "it is always possible that there
may be people about willing to do me a bad turn." He shaded his
eyes with his hand for a few moments and stared intently down the
track that led from the station towards the main road. "If you
should ever see any strange man," he continued slowly, "lurking
about as if he didn't want to be seen, just let me know at once,
will you? Tell me immediately wherever I am, you understand?"</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said Beeton, as if very much impressed.
"I'll keep my eyes open and tell you at once. I'll keep a look
out all day."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about firearms?" asked his master
presently.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty quick with a shot-gun, sir," replied the
chauffeur, "but I've not had much experience with a rifle."</p>

<p>"Not got a pistol, eh?"</p>

<p>Beeton smiled as if he were rather amused, and shook his
head.</p>

<p>"A spanner's more in my line, sir, I think, but
still"&mdash;and his open honest face beamed with
enthusiasm&mdash;"I could soon get accustomed to a pistol I
think, if I had one."</p>

<p>The chauffeur's heart beat very quickly. Was fate dealing him
the ace of trumps so soon?</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I used to have a pistol somewhere," said his master,
hesitatingly, "but it's got mislaid somehow, and I can't remember
where it is." He thought for a moment. "Anyhow," he jerked out
quickly, "I'll buy a couple of automatics to-morrow. We might
want them sometime, and they'll be always handy to have about the
place."</p>

<p>The chauffeur's hopes sank instantly to zero.</p>

<p>"Not yet, my child," he murmured sadly, as his master moved
away. "Not yet, not yet."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch24"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<p class="first">A COUPLE of days later and it was plain to
everyone that the master of Mundulla Station was not in a happy
state of mind.</p>

<p>He was fidgety and restless, and his one-time calm and placid
face was clouded always now with a worried frown.</p>

<p>He was irritable and bad-tempered, too, and the slightest
thing upset him. Quite trivial matters seemed to annoy him, and
he was moody and very short of speech.</p>

<p>No one knew better than himself the change that had come over
him, and the very knowledge of it annoyed and worried him to a
degree. He was anything but a coward, and up to a certain point
his nature was as strong and self-reliant as could be.</p>

<p>Yet there was a peculiarity about his courage, for it was of
the cold and calculating type.</p>

<p>He was a man who in the actual presence of a danger he had
anticipated would be bold and unflinching to the bitter end. He
would have no fear of his enemies, and if defeat came in him he
would accept things calmly and without repining. He would stand
then in the eyes of the world as a strong and absolutely fearless
type of man, but, in order to exhibit these qualities, he must
never be rushed into anything. He must never be startled into
situations with no time given him to make up his mind, and,
again, to be at his best, he must be seeing definitely from what
direction the danger was about to come. He could not stand
uncertainty and suspense, and that was the trouble that was
eating his heart out now.</p>

<p>If he were only sure that Larose was on his track, if he had
only some idea as to how much the latter guessed or thought he
knew, if he had only some inkling as to how Larose was going to
appear, then, in a way, he would have worried very little, and
just prepare himself to meet the whole thing as if he did not
fear or care at all.</p>

<p>But he was in the dark everywhere, he was suspicious of
everything, and the poison of suspense began to sink into the
marrow of his bones.</p>

<p>Within a week, then, it followed that he began to alter all
his usual habits, and, instead of riding energetically about the
station, as had been his wont, he gave out that he was not
feeling well, and passed most of the time sitting out upon the
verandah.</p>

<p>He read nearly all day long, or at any rate made a pretence of
reading, for the chauffeur noticed that more often than not his
eyes were gazing out towards the road rather than being turned
upon the book.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, it was to the chauffeur himself, the latest
comer to the station, that he was the most communicative, and
quite often he crossed the yard to the garage, and had a chat
with the man.</p>

<p>At times, then, he seemed for the moment to shake off the cold
reserve of his nature and unloosen his restraint.</p>

<p>"Know Sydney, Beeton?" he asked suddenly, one morning.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the chauffeur. "I've passed most of my
life there."</p>

<p>"Beautiful city," went on James Dice, "but too rough and noisy
for me. Give me the quietness of country like this, every
time."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," agreed the chauffeur, "not much peace in Sydney,
night or day."</p>

<p>"What did you do there?" asked his master. "You were in the
motor line?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I drove for a doctor, sir," replied Beeton.</p>

<p>"Oh," remarked James Dice, "then you know the city well?"</p>

<p>"Almost every street and road in it, sir, as well as I know
this yard now."</p>

<p>There was silence for a minute, and then Dice spoke again. "I
suppose," he said, as if quite casually, "I suppose there really
are some very rough districts in Sydney. There are a lot of bad
characters about, I mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir, Sydney has always some of the wickedest people
in the world in it, they say."</p>

<p>"Are the police pretty good there?"</p>

<p>The chauffeur nodded his head emphatically. "They have to be,
sir. There's always such a lot for them to do."</p>

<p>"What about their detectives?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the detectives! Well, sir, some of them are very good.
One or two of them are supposed to be the best any country's ever
known."</p>

<p>James Dice got up from the box where he had been sitting, and
slowly stretched his arms. It seemed as if he were beginning to
get bored.</p>

<p>"Ever heard," he asked, stifling a yawn, "ever happen to hear
of a chap they've got there called&mdash;called Larose?"</p>

<p>Beeton drew himself up straight with a jerk, and his face
beamed over with pride and enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, sir," he exclaimed. "Everyone who's lived in Sydney
has heard of Larose. He's a long way the best detective they've
got. We were always hearing about him. He's said to be really
wonderful."</p>

<p>James Dice seemed to be stifling another yawn. He was
obviously getting bored now, and it was quite a sneering face
that he turned upon his chauffeur.</p>

<p>"What's wonderful about him?" he asked contemptuously. "Is he
so different, then, from other men?"</p>

<p>Beeton hesitated. "Well, sir, it's like this," he replied.
"People believe he can bring back to himself whatever's happened
in any place. He can stand, say, where a man's been murdered and
he'll just close his eyes and be able to see the very face of the
person who killed him."</p>

<p>"Bosh," said Dice angrily.</p>

<p>"I know, sir, it does seem absurd," went on the chauffeur in
an ashamed sort of way, "but then he's done it, time after time.
Why, when they found the policeman's body in that cellar in Jury
Street last year no one could make head or tail of it until
Larose was called in. Then within an hour or two he'd found it
all out, and they got hold of the man straight
away&mdash;although no one ever came to know exactly how Larose
had done it."</p>

<p>James Dice mopped his face vigorously with his handkerchief.
He looked white and sickly with the heat.</p>

<p>"What's Larose like?" he asked rather huskily. "Have you ever
seen him?"</p>

<p>"No, sir, and there's something very funny about that, too.
Lots of photographs of him have been published, but he looks a
different person every time. They say he can change his face just
as he wants to by screwing up his eyes and stretching the muscles
of his cheeks."</p>

<p>"You're a fool, Beeton," commented his master with a sneer
again. "I didn't think you could be such an ass." He took out his
watch. "Bring the car round in ten minutes," he went on
brusquely. "I shall be going into Meningie this morning."</p>

<p>He walked leisurely across the yard back into the house,
humming casually to himself as he went along and no one, from his
outward appearance would have guessed for a moment the agitation
that was in his mind. With shaking hands he mixed himself a stiff
brandy and soda, and again he had to have recourse to his
handkerchief to clear his face of sweat.</p>

<p>"Damn," he swore savagely. "What makes me think of it at all?
There's not one chance in a million of anything coming out, but
if I go on like this I shall become really mad. I must pull
myself together and be a man. If I face things boldly there is
absolutely nothing to worry about."</p>

<p>But it was a different tale again when he was in bed that
night and a very different tale, too, the next morning when he
rose, tired and unrefreshed, from snatches only of broken sleep.
All his fears and gloomy forebodings were back, and in spite of
all his reasoning he could not shake them off. Over and over
again he told himself he was a fool, that his position was
impregnable, and that he had only to sit tight and, Larose or no
Larose, all would be well.</p>

<p>But, do all he would, he could not convince himself, and, as
day followed upon day, although outwardly he had managed to
school himself to more self-control, inwardly there was the
continual piling up in his mind of the cumulative effect of worry
and strain.</p>

<p>The thought of Larose had by then become absolutely to obsess
him, and in some guise or other he was expecting the detective at
every hour of the day.</p>

<p>He scrutinised every tradesman or caller that came up the
road, and, although they were quite unaware of it, each one of
them before they finally reached the house had been under his
binoculars for many hundreds of yards.</p>

<p>He thought, too, that Larose might be hiding in almost every
place. Larose was in the gullies, he was in the ditches, he had
scooped himself a hole in the sand hummock tops. Larose was
walking round the house at night, he was skulking in the wood
shed, he was peering through the fly-proof windows directly it
got dark&mdash;in fact, he was ubiquitous; he was everywhere all
at once.</p>

<p>It could not be denied, however, that James Dice had got some
very good reasons for believing that he was being shadowed. One
morning he had found distinct marks of a tool upon the frame of
his bedroom window outside, and Beeton, the chauffeur, being
whisperingly called into consultation, had at once given it as
his opinion that they were the marks of a chisel. Some one, he
said, must have been trying to force the window during the
night.</p>

<p>Dice went almost green with apprehension, and his horror was
redoubled when the chauffeur reluctantly admitted that twice
lately he had thought he had heard some one prowling about the
place in the dark.</p>

<p>"Then why the hell didn't you tell me at once?" snarled his
master desperately, between his teeth. "I told you to keep a look
out."</p>

<p>"But I wasn't sure, sir," pleaded the chauffeur, "and perhaps
now I was mistaken, because the dog never barked."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch25"></a>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="first">"AH! the dog!" ejaculated Dice. "I thought
yesterday he looked dull and sleepy. Perhaps he's been doped.
Keep him on his chain in future, and then we shall know where we
are. And don't let anyone give him any food but yourself."</p>

<p>"I ought to have got those pistols I spoke about the other
day," he went on. "I'll phone up for them to Adelaide straight
away. In the meantime you shall have one of the shot guns, and
just keep a couple of cartridges always handy by your bed. I'll
keep half a dozen by mine, and by James," he ground his teeth
viciously together, "by James, I'll give anyone hell if I catch
them prowling round." He looked determinedly at Beeton. "Fire
instantly, man, when you see anyone, and you can't miss with a
shot gun, you know. I'm a magistrate, remember, and I'll take all
the blame."</p>

<p>"What ho!" whistled Larose thoughtfully, when a few minutes
later he was back again by himself in the motor shed. "Things are
certainly moving on now. Still, I don't quite like the idea of
these shot-guns, and I'll have to attend to those cartridges of
his before to-night. I don't want to be going to my own funeral
just yet, and in the mood he's now in he isn't safe. Now, if only
he'd produce that pistol he's got. I'm sure it's hidden
somewhere, and it would make all the evidence click.
Still&mdash;still, I really think we're getting on. Yes, we're
getting on."</p>

<p>So the confined and intense drama on Mundulla station
proceeded for a few more days, and then the curtain was rung down
suddenly in a manner totally different from that expected by both
principal actors, and in a way certainly most disconcerting to
one.</p>

<p>James Dice became suddenly of the opinion that his chauffeur
was&mdash;Larose!</p>

<p>It happened like this. Everything had seemed to be going well
for Larose, and day by day he had been getting more and more into
his victim's confidence. Besides being the chauffeur, he had now
become the valet of his master as well. He had pressed his
clothes for him, he had sharpened his razors, and he had looked
after his boots. He had been the first one to call him in the
morning, and the last one to see that he had got all he wanted at
night.</p>

<p>James Dice had opened his mind and confided in him, and he had
told him plainly that he believed that there was some one hiding
about the station who was wishing to do him harm. As Beeton, the
chauffeur, Larose had been all sympathy and offers of help, and,
with the opportunities of his new position, he had made not a few
little discoveries most interesting to himself.</p>

<p>He had found, for one thing, a coat at the back of the
wardrobe with dark stains on it all down the front, that might
well have been those of blood, and, most significant, too, was a
letter in the inside pocket of the coat with a postmark on the
envelope of the very date upon which Eli Barton had met his
death. Undoubtedly it suggested that James Dice had been wearing
the coat on the exact day of the murder.</p>

<p>Then, too, Larose had had several peeps among James Dice's
private papers when the latter was having his bath, and he had
looked through his bank pass-book as well. He saw there had been
actually less than &pound;20 to his credit in the bank on the day
before Black Wolf had won the Christmas Cup; also, from some
letters he had hastily run over, it was plain James Dice had been
hard pressed for money at that time, with several summonses
actually on the point of being issued. The week after the race,
however, no less than &pound;13,700 had been paid into the bank,
and taking everything altogether the cumulative evidence to the
detective seemed very black.</p>

<p>So things had been one morning when they had all started off
in the car for a picnic jaunt on the banks of the River Murray,
near to the township of Wellington. Margaret Bevan had got two
girl friends staying with her and, worried and anxious about her
uncle, she had persuaded him that a day's outing would do him
good. So off they had all driven with a well-packed hamper
strapped on to the side of the car.</p>

<p>James Dice had occupied the front seat next to his chauffeur,
and the two, in low tones, had discussed the possible advent of
the mysterious visitor that at least one of them was expecting
imminently.</p>

<p>"We'll see him soon enough," said Dice with absolute
confidence, "and between us both he ought to get a warm
reception."</p>

<p>"I'll pepper him right enough, sir," replied Beeton with
enthusiasm, "and afterwards it'll be easy to explain that I
thought it was a rabbit." He grinned with great amusement. "When
we've both done with him, sir, I don't suppose he'll be feeling
healthy enough to raise many awkward questions."</p>

<p>His master smiled back, and for the thousandth time thought
what a gem of a servant he had got.</p>

<p>Lunch was taken on a high knoll just overlooking the
river.</p>

<p>But the master of Mundulla station did not enjoy his meal at
all. His uneasiness was with him as much as ever, and he was
looking round all the time and wondering if they had been
followed.</p>

<p>There was a man fishing from a boat about a quarter of a mile
away, and it took many long stares through the binoculars before
he was quite satisfied that they were not being watched from that
quarter.</p>

<p>He was, however, satisfied there, at length, but do all he
would he could not shake off the obsession that some time, sure
as death, Larose was going to spring up before him, in some
strange and totally unexpected guise. Perhaps, he thought, he
would appear like some one he knew very well, like one of his
brother magistrates for instance, maybe even like the policeman,
Abel Black. Perhaps&mdash;but here he cursed himself for his
folly and, more to divert his thoughts than from any prospect of
enjoyment, he opened his case and took out a cigarette.</p>

<p>He took a few deep puffs, and then, looking wearily round, his
eyes fell languidly upon his chauffeur, only a few yards
away.</p>

<p>Beeton, at any rate, he saw, was enjoying his meal with gusto.
He was seated by himself, a little apart from the others, just by
the foot of a tree, and he had all the appearance of a man who
was taking life well. He was eating slowly and with appreciation,
and he took his wine slowly, too, as if it were a nectar to be
sipped caressingly, and not a beverage to be savagely gulped
down.</p>

<p>His master, idly watching him, thought suddenly what nice
table manners the man had, and how like a gentleman he took his
food. He broke his bread with both hands, he took small
mouthfuls, and he emptied his mouth every time before he drank.
Why, he might really pass as a gentleman anywhere! He might be
anybody but a common chauffeur. He might&mdash;Ah!... A thought
shrieked into James Dice's mind, an idea positively leaped at
him, and then a shock of sheer amazement seemed absolutely to
freeze the very marrow in his spine. He leant back sick and
giddy, and he felt his very heart stand still. His eyes grew
dazed, and the happy voices near him sounded faint and far
away.</p>

<p>Beeton&mdash;the chauffeur! No, he was Larose, he was Larose!
The name was caught up into his brain, and whirled round and
round like the eddies of some fierce, imprisoned wind.</p>

<p>Larose! Larose! Yes, it was Beeton who was Larose!</p>

<p>James Dice went cold as death. Every sense in him seemed to
become numb, and then a sort of faintness seized him, and his
mind refused to think of anything at all. He was like a man
stricken with paralysis, and he just lay quiet and held his
breath.</p>

<p>Then gradually, very gradually, a realisation of everything
came back. He knew again what was happening, and, with an effort,
he turned his face sideways so that his agitation should not be
seen. Presently he found that he could begin to think clearly
again, and his thoughts became instantly most bitter ones. Oh,
what a fool he'd been, and what a dupe in Larose's hands! He had
just walked into the trap the latter had set for him, with his
eyes wide open, and a child even could not have been more easily
taken in. Of course Beeton was Larose; there was not the
slightest doubt of it when he thought of everything now.</p>

<p>Beeton's recent appearance in the neighbourhood, the
mysterious flitting away of the old chauffeur, and the artful way
in which Beeton had so manoeuvred as to get himself taken on in
the missing man's place. The complete way in which his new
servant had discharged all his duties, his ingratiating manner,
and the superior intelligence he had always shown! The very
appearance of the man, now he came to think of it
critically&mdash;all, all pointed to something very, very
different from an ordinary and common chauffeur. He bore the
stamp of refinement and education, and was obviously much too
good and capable a man to be working for so small a wage, in a
situation like that at Mundulla. If motoring were really his line
he would be earning a good salary in the city.</p>

<p><br>
Then James Dice's thoughts ran on. But if Beeton were Larose,
why had he come to Mundulla at all? Why had he, the chief
magistrate, been singled out for suspicion?</p>

<p>Bah! It was gossip, of course. Gossip. Just because Black Wolf
had won the Christmas Cup. Larose had merely followed up the
easiest lines of suspicion, and had come down to Mundulla on the
chance that, if James Dice were really the murderer, then he,
Larose, would be dealing only with some raw country bumpkin, with
hayseeds in his hair.</p>

<p>James Dice sneered contemptuously. Larose was no miracle
worker. The fellow was a fool after all, and he must be realising
now that he had been very much mistaken. He had been at Mundulla
nearly a month and he had found out nothing, absolutely nothing.
All he had done had been to put in four weeks of hard work as a
common servant, and make a few chisel marks outside his master's
bedroom window.</p>

<p>James Dice ground his teeth together viciously here and grew
hot with shame. Yes, the fool had frightened him&mdash;there was
no doubt about that. Damn him, and his lies about the wonderful
Larose. He'd give him Larose. The boot was on the other foot now,
and it was hell and torment for Larose instead. He'd toy with
him, he'd lead him on&mdash;an evil smile curved round James
Dice's lips, and he nodded significantly to himself.</p>

<p>The master of Mundulla pulled himself up straight. He was
quite himself again. He picked up his binoculars and shut them in
their case with a snap.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch26"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<p class="first">LAROSE heard the snap. He was just in the act of
putting a piece of cheese into his mouth.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Hullo!" he thought. "What's happening now? Something
decisive. His royal highness has made up his mind about
something. Now what on earth can that be?"</p>

<p>James Dice turned to his niece. "Do you know, Margaret," he
said smiling. "I think I'll have a piece of ham after all. I feel
quite hungry again now."</p>

<p>"Hullo! Hullo!" thought Larose again. "What does it mean?
Something's happened for sure. Eating ham now, is he? I must look
out. I must take care."</p>

<p>All that afternoon and during the long drive home James Dice
seemed to Larose, who missed nothing, to have become quite a
different man. He appeared to have thrown off all the depression
of the morning and to be entirely free of worry. He laughed and
joked quite a lot with the girls, and was as pleasant and
confidential as ever to his chauffeur; indeed, towards the latter
it seemed almost as if he were unusually anxious to be nice.</p>

<p>"You really do drive splendidly, Beeton," he remarked once,
"and you never seem to get tired." Then he added interestedly:
"Did you have many long journeys to make when you drove for that
doctor you told me about, in Sydney?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied Larose, who sensed somehow that more lay
behind the simple question than, at any rate, seemed outwardly to
be the case. "He was often called into the country, and then we
had long distances to go."</p>

<p>"Well," smiled James Dice, "it made you an excellent driver,
and you could hold a situation anywhere."</p>

<p>When they reached home and Dice was enjoying a cool shower
bath, preparatory to the evening meal, he congratulated himself
that he had acted very well, and that no inkling of any suspicion
could possibly have entered his chauffeur's mind.</p>

<p>But he would not have been quite so certain about it if he
could have seen into his chauffeur's mind when he, too, was
partaking of his evening meal.</p>

<p>The latter was in his little room, by himself, just off the
garage, and he was very thoughtful. He knew something had
happened, and he was puzzling as to what it was.</p>

<p>It was well on towards midnight before Larose gave up trying
to puzzle the problem out, and it was a very uneasy detective who
finally undressed and got into bed.</p>

<p>He had missed something somewhere, he told himself, and he
grunted disgustedly at the thought that, in consequence, he would
now be forced straightaway to alter his whole plan of
campaign.</p>

<p>Incidentally, he had meant to go out that very night in order
to make some mysterious foot-prints in the flower bed under James
Dice's bedroom window, for the due attention of that gentleman
directly he awoke.</p>

<p>But now he judged it better to remain in bed, and had he only
known he would have rejoiced at the wisdom of his caution.</p>

<p>James Dice was waiting up for him until past two in the
morning. He was hoping for more chisel marks upon the
window-frame, and he was nursing a loaded shot-gun across
his knees.</p>

<p><br>
The next day was one of some unpleasant surprises for Larose,
and, as far as he and the master of Mundulla were concerned, he
soon found that the tables were now completely turned.</p>

<p>It was he himself who was now being watched. He half thought
it the very first thing in the morning after he had thrown open
the garage doors and started to attend to the car. The idea was
strengthened after breakfast, and by mid-day he was as sure of it
as of anything he had ever been in all his life.</p>

<p>His master never seemed to take his eyes far from him the
whole time. Not that James Dice ever appeared to be actually
watching him openly. The master of Mundulla sat as usual on the
verandah, with his book, and with the binoculars close handy upon
his knee. He read a page or two and then he lazily picked up his
glasses and made the usual sweep round. He focussed them, as he
had always done, first on one place and then on another, but
Larose soon noticed, and with a growing uneasiness, too, that
they always ended up by being focussed straight on him.</p>

<p>Then again, when James Dice did appear for a moment to be
absorbed in his book, if Larose made even the very slightest
change in his position when working on the car, if he moved only
from one side to the other, he saw that his master looked up at
once, and kept a ready eye on the scene below.</p>

<p>"Hum!" muttered Larose, "this wants some more thinking out. I
don't like the look of things at all."</p>

<p>By the time evening came, however, it was quite clear to
Larose that his employer had indeed outflanked him, and that the
snug security of his chauffeur-pose had passed.</p>

<p>How it had exactly come about he had not the faintest idea,
but there was no glossing over the fact that the man had somehow
stumbled upon the truth.</p>

<p>Everything in his manner pointed to it, and his whole line of
conduct was now exactly what the detective would have expected,
in a person of his temper and disposition, under such
circumstances.</p>

<p>All his one-time restlessness had disappeared, and all his
quiet confidence had returned, as if in the actual presence of
the danger he had once so feared he had become cool and
collected, and had in every way recovered his nerve.</p>

<p>Larose sighed deeply to himself when he thought of it, but he
understood what it was. James Dice had dreaded him terribly in
the spirit but, brought face-to-face with him in the flesh, his
fear had been completely lifted.</p>

<p>For a long while the detective debated with himself what he
had best now do. At first he was almost inclined to pack up his
traps and take his departure without delay, but then, he reasoned
to himself, his continued presence at Mundulla station was not,
even now, without a certain element of strength.</p>

<p>James Dice might know who he was, but he was certainly not
aware that he, Larose, was in the possession of the knowledge
that had come his way. He would not have so openly shown such
interest in him, his chauffeur, if that were so, and he would not
so obviously have tried to draw him out and trip him up with
questions, as had been the case, at intervals, the whole day
long.</p>

<p>Then, too, there was another point to consider. James Dice
might be absolutely confident to-day that in the chauffeur,
Beeton, he had unmasked the detective Larose, but it was quite
possible that by to-morrow his complete confidence might have
somewhat abated. After all, he could have no proof positive that
Beeton was Larose, and there was always the chance that, with no
strengthening of the conviction, the pendulum might soon swing
back the other way, and once again the murderer's mind be in that
condition of flux and uncertainty which, in some unguarded
moment, might give the whole game away.</p>

<p>So Larose took heart again, and, remembering how often his
adventurous career victory had come to him from the very ashes of
defeat, he smiled confidently to himself, and prepared to carry
on his investigations to the end.</p>

<p><br>
For two days James Dice was supremely happy in the absolute
conviction that he was playing with Larose, and then all suddenly
his mood underwent yet another change.</p>

<p>The ghost of grey fear crept subtly into his heart and he
found himself in the grip of worry once again.</p>

<p>If Beeton were actually the detective Larose&mdash;and he was
quite sure of it&mdash;why on earth then, he asked himself, was
the man so content to remain on now at the station, as if he were
still expecting to find something out?</p>

<p>It would be childish, of course, even in the face of his
present blunderings, to under-estimate the fellow's ability. His
reputation in the Commonwealth was so wide and so broad-based
that there must be something in him to have deserved it. He could
not be such a simple-minded fool as to keep on dangling about
Mundulla Station unless he had some hope definitely in view. Then
what on earth was it?</p>

<p>James Dice swore savagely to himself and then decided that it
was time for him to act. He was getting tired of this
hide-and-seek business, he told himself, and besides, in some way
or other, Larose might prove dangerous after all. The fellow must
be cleared out, he must be taught a lesson, he must be injured in
some way&mdash;at any rate he must be dealt with promptly before
any suspicions that his ruse had failed came into his mind.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch27"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<p class="first">LAROSE sensed very quickly that something had
happened. He noted that his employer had suddenly stopped coming
over to the garage for a chat, and that now he was hardly spoken
to at all. Upon several occasions, too, he found he was being
regarded with a very ugly frown.</p>

<p>"Hullo," he asked himself grimly, "but what's his lordship up
to now?"</p>

<p>And it was not very long before he began to find out. On the
fourth afternoon following upon the day of the picnic, James Dice
suddenly announced that he should be wanting the car to go into
Meningie at three o'clock sharp. Then at the last moment, and
just as Larose was about to bring the car round, his master sent
him across the paddocks with a message to one of the station
hands, who was working on some fencing about a mile away.</p>

<p>Larose thought it strange at the time that he should have been
detailed as a messenger, and he regarded as peculiar also the
manner in which his employer bustled him so quickly off. He gave
his instructions without looking at the detective, and the latter
was sure that he deliberately avoided his eye.</p>

<p>Larose was gone about half an hour, and then, upon his return,
his employer was all hurry and impatience to get away in the
car.</p>

<p>Larose turned quickly into the garage and something there
struck him as remarkable at once. Schafer, the dog, was stretched
half-asleep upon some old sacks in the corner.</p>

<p>Now the dog, Larose knew, was a very companionable sort of
animal, and never remained anywhere alone by himself if he could
possibly help it. He never, for instance, by any chance entered
the garage unless some one was there at the time.</p>

<p>"Hullo," thought the detective, directly he saw the dog, "some
one's been here and stopping in here, too, or Schafer wouldn't be
lying down, the governor for sure; now what's he been up to, I
wonder?"</p>

<p>He looked quickly and searchingly round, but there appeared to
be nothing unusual about the garage and nothing was apparently
out of place.</p>

<p>Very puzzled, he jumped on to the car and proceeded to operate
the self-starter. But nothing happened. The self-starter was as
dead as a door nail. He tried again, but with the same
result.</p>

<p>Then the shadow of his master loomed up and James Dice stood
suddenly before the garage door.</p>

<p>"Be quick," he exclaimed sharply. "I'm in a hurry,
please!"</p>

<p>"The self-starter won't work, sir," explained Larose. "I can't
get it to go."</p>

<p>"Then start it with the handle," replied James, Dice
irritably. "I don't want to be kept here, all day."</p>

<p>Without a word, the detective got down and prepared to swing
the handle. There was nothing unusual in the command, and he had
often swung it before. The Punic was a big, high powered car, but
it always started easily and, with the magneto as he knew it was,
the swinging was quite safe.</p>

<p>In quite a matter-of-fact way, then he pressed in the handle,
and was just preparing to swing carelessly when suddenly his deep
subconscious self flashed him a lightning signal of alarm.
"Something unusual going on," it warned him. "Your master's
watching you very queerly. Look out, danger ahead." Larose was on
the qui vive at once, and, as with him no precaution was ever too
trivial to be neglected, he very warily proceeded now to swing
the handle with the maximum amount of care,
when&mdash;crack!&mdash;and with a vicious and violent back-fire
it was jerked out of his hand.</p>

<p>"Ah!" ejaculated Larose, "so he's starting his tricks is he?
The brute's altered the timing. He wanted me to break my arm,"
and, without a word to his master, he lifted up the bonnet of the
car.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later a secretly amused Larose and an openly
sullen and morose James Dice were speeding along the road towards
Meningie. Their minds were both full of thought, but they neither
of them said a word.</p>

<p>The next morning the chauffeur had just fetched his breakfast
from the kitchen.... It was a plate of curry and, as usual, he
was going to partake of it by himself in his own little room, off
the garage. He had just sat down, when his master called to him
to fetch a cucumber from the garden. He was not gone two minutes,
but upon resuming his seat before his yet untasted breakfast it
came to him suddenly that he could sense the smell of cigars. Not
the smell of a cigar that was being smoked, but just the faint
tinge of heavily cigar-impregnated clothes, the aroma that hangs
about a coat whose owner has smoked boxes and boxes of cigars
while wearing it.</p>

<p>"Whew," whistled Larose after a good sniff round into the air,
"my friend the enemy again. More tricks now, I suppose."</p>

<p>He looked very searchingly upon his breakfast, spread upon the
tray. The bread was certainly all right, likewise the butter, the
jam also had not been disturbed. The tea in the teapot was
doubtful, and the curry&mdash;ah, the curry looked as if it had
been stirred!</p>

<p>Larose pursed up his lips and stared hard at the contents of
the plate before him.</p>

<p>"It seems fanciful," he mused, "but it is quite on the cards
after all. As friend James most truthfully remarked the other
day, any kind of accident here would be easily explained away. He
is a magistrate, and above reproach. No, I won't risk it."</p>

<p>He made quite a satisfactory breakfast upon the bread and
butter and some cheese that he fetched from his cupboard. Then,
awaiting a favourable opportunity, he carried out his plate of
curry and presented it to two ducks who were foraging in the
grass at the back of the garage.</p>

<p>They were both very greedy, and quickly gobbled it up. He then
proceeded about his usual morning's work of attending to the car.
He whistled cheerfully to himself as if he had not a care in all
the world. Presently, out of the corner of his eye, he noticed
that his master was watching him.</p>

<p>All that day James Dice never came near the garage, and the
services of Beeton were never once required.</p>

<p>He had found two dead ducks that evening by the creek. Their
feathers were all mired and ruffled, and there was all evidence
from where they lay that they had flapped their wings many times
in the agonies of some dreadful form of death.</p>

<p>"Weed-killer most likely," had sighed Larose. "The usual kind
of handy family poison. Most reliable, too, if you only use
enough. But I must be careful now, very careful. Do you know,
Gilbert, I really think you are beginning to get afraid."</p>

<p>The next day things were very much the same. James Dice quite
ignored his chauffeur, and did not call for his services even
once. He had apparently given up watching, too, and Larose saw
nothing of him, either on the veranda or in the yard.</p>

<p>It was terribly hot all day, and towards evening Margaret
Bevan came out and suggested to Larose that he should take the
dog down to the creek, about half a mile distant, and give the
animal a bathe.</p>

<p>The detective was delighted with the opportunity of getting
away from the house for an hour or so, and gladly compiled. So he
whistled to Schafer, and the two made their ways leisurely across
the paddocks.</p>

<p>The dog enjoyed his bathe immensely, even though there was not
much water in the creek and what there was of it at that was hot
and very muddy.</p>

<p><br>
Larose sat smoking on the high bank and enviously regarded the
animal swimming round.</p>

<p>"After all, old chap," he sighed, "I really believe that you
are happier than I. You're not supposed to have a soul, but you
don't get any worry, and there's no one thirsting for your
blood."</p>

<p>His thoughts reverted again to James Dice, and he wondered
what his master was up to at the moment.</p>

<p>"I must be careful. I must be very careful," he mused. "Our
friend has clearly got to the homicidal stage and anything may
happen if I don't look out. But what do I get at all by remaining
on here now? I'm half inclined to think I shall have to take my
leave and yet, somehow, I don't like to say 'good-bye.'" He
smiled in amusement to himself. "Nice comfortable place this,
Gilbert, my boy. You'd be quite sorry to leave it, wouldn't you?
Highly moral master, justice of the peace&mdash;wages very
fair&mdash;meals, especially the curries, very
good&mdash;hours&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His meditations were interrupted suddenly by a loud explosion
just behind him. At the same instant his hat was lifted roughly
from his head and whirled up into the air, to several yards away.
Then, before he could take in what was happening or had even time
to move a limb, there was a second report, equally loud, and this
time he felt a sharp blow upon his left shoulder.</p>

<p>He sprang like lightning to his feet and, turning round, saw
James Dice standing not 10 yards away. He was holding a still
smoking gun in his hands, and there was a look of absolute
amazement upon his white and startled face.</p>

<p>There was the sound of voices from a little way down the
creek, and two men came running quickly up. They had heard the
firing and had come to see what had been shot.</p>

<p>Larose saw they were two of the station hands, and, realising
now that he was quite safe, he made no attempt to disarm James
Dice. The latter was trembling violently, and his face was
dripping with sweat.</p>

<p>In an instant the detective had made up his mind. He saw that
nothing was to be gained by accusing James Dice, and that the
best plan would be to pretend he thought the shooting was an
accident.</p>

<p>But James Dice could hardly speak; he still eyed Larose as if
something altogether incredible and impossible had happened.</p>

<p>"I thought, I thought," he muttered hoarsely, "that it was a
rabbit up there. Your hat looked just like one against the sky.
It was a miracle you weren't hit."</p>

<p>But the detective knew it was no miracle at all. He had
escaped injury simply because James Dice had been using
cartridges that had been tampered with by Larose.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch28"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p class="first">LATE that night Larose made up his mind finally
that it was time for him to leave Mundulla station.</p>

<p>"It's no good remaining on," he told himself, "for one thing,
because it's too dangerous now. Dice would do anything in his
present mood, and that shooting this evening was as cool a piece
of impudence as I've ever known. The beast just openly followed
me down and didn't even take the trouble to make sure there was
no one else about." He scowled angrily to himself. "But my
gentleman's not done with me yet. I've still one or two good
cards to play if only I manage to get out of this place all
right."</p>

<p>The next morning the cook called across to the garage for
Beeton to come and fetch his breakfast but she got no response,
and, after a moment's waiting, she ran over and rapped upon the
garage door.</p>

<p>But there was silence still, and when she looked both into the
garage and the chauffeur's room, adjoining, she found them both
empty and no sign of the man anywhere.</p>

<p>Meeting Miss Bevan as she was returning to the kitchen, she
asked her if Beeton had gone out upon some errand, for, she said,
she had not seen him at all as yet that morning. Miss Bevan said
she didn't know, and a moment later, running up against her uncle
as he was coming out of the bathroom, she passed on the
inquiry.</p>

<p>"Sent Beeton anywhere?" asked her uncle suspiciously.</p>

<p>"No, certainly not. Isn't he anywhere about?" and then,
hearing what the cook had said, he walked at once over to the
garage and threw open both the doors.</p>

<p>"Ha," he muttered in tones of mingled satisfaction and
annoyance, "and has the bird really flown?"</p>

<p>As he entered the garage an envelope conspicuously placed upon
the bonnet of the car immediately caught his eye.</p>

<p>It was addressed <i>"James Dice, Esq.,"</i> and he tore it open quickly.</p>

<br>

<p><i>"Respected Sir,"</i> he read. <i>"Will you
please forgive me going away for a few days? I don't feel very
well, and the accident yesterday has got on my nerves. I have
left my things and I will come back directly I am better. I hope
I shall not have to stay away long. Please excuse the
inconvenience I am causing,</i></p>

<p><i>"From your obedient servant,</i></p>

<p><i>"<span class="smcap">Thomas Beeton</span>.</i></p>

<p><i>"P.S.&mdash;Everything in the car is all right and the tank is full."</i></p>

<p><br>
"Ah!" sneered the master of Mundulla, "so I've frightened you,
my dear Larose, have I, but you'll return, will you?" James Dice
curled his lips in great contempt. "Not on my life, I'll swear to
that. You have been taught a lesson here, at any rate, you damned
fool," and, crushing the letter in his hand, he returned into the
house.</p>

<p>After lunch James Dice came into the garage again and himself
fetched out the car. His niece mounted up beside him, and a
couple of minutes later anyone upon the station, who had happened
to be interested, would have marked the sounds of the engine
getting fainter and fainter, as the big Punic proceeded briskly
on its way.</p>

<p>And certainly one person, at all events, was most
interested.</p>

<p>The moment all sounds of the car had definitely passed away
there was a distinct movement from the direction of a bundle of
old sails suspended from some planks that rested among the
rafters of the garage. One end of the sails seemed gradually to
unwind and then, very cautiously, the head of a man was thrust
out. Anyone on the station would have sworn at once that it was
the head of the chauffeur, Beeton. And they would have been quite
right, too, for a moment later the chauffeur of Mr. Dice appeared
bodily from the sails, and, with a circumspect glance all round,
to make sure that there was nobody at hand, dropped softly upon
the ground.</p>

<p>"Good," muttered Larose, luxuriously stretching his cramped
limbs, "and now to see that Martha is not about."</p>

<p>He tiptoed quietly to the garage door, and for a long while
stood watching to find out if the coast were clear. Then,
suddenly, he heard the cook singing in the kitchen, and, knowing
then definitely where she was, he darted like an arrow across the
yard, and in a few seconds was safely ensconced in the master of
Mundulla's own particular room.</p>

<p><br>
He lost no time in preliminaries, and producing a small wedge
from his pocket thrust it under the door, and at once proceeded
to make a thorough search of the room.</p>

<p>He had been in it alone many times before, but never for more
than a few minutes at a time, and the searches he had been able
to make had been only lightning-like and casual in their nature.
Now he reckoned that if he made no noise he would have at least a
couple of hours.</p>

<p>He turned his attention first to the big Cutler desk, and
found it, as he had expected, locked, but some cunningly shaped
pieces of stout wire soon got over that difficulty, and in less
than five minutes he was methodically going through the contents
of drawer after drawer.</p>

<p>At first it was only for a bulky object that he was looking.
He wanted the big revolver that Eli Barton had been shot with,
and he had reckoned confidently that it would be there. But
complete disappointment, at any rate in that respect, awaited
him, and there was no sign of any weapon at all. He made no
pause, however, in his work, and proceeded most carefully to
examine the other contents of the drawers. Everything they
contained, he reasoned, had been kept for a purpose, and it was
with the purpose of James Dice's mind that he had to deal.</p>

<p>Nothing was too small for him to examine, and paper after
paper was subjected to quick scrutiny. James Dice was
business-like and methodical in his way, and everything in the
desk was arranged neatly. But Larose found nothing bearing on the
tragedy of Eli Barton until he came to a drawer devoted entirely
to matters connected with racing. Here there were racing
programmes, calendars, and newspaper cuttings almost without end,
and finally he fished out a small bundle of letters of
comparatively recent date. One from Melbourne immediately caught
his eye. It was from <i>"Your affectionate, cousin, Thomas
French,"</i> and was dated the previous December 5.</p>

<br>

<p><i>"<span class="smcap">My dear Jim</span>,"</i> it commenced,
<i>"I don't want to dishearten you, but just you make up your
mind straightaway that&mdash;however good your nag may
be&mdash;he doesn't stand an earthly if old Eli decides to run
his. Abimeleck could give the Pride a couple of stone and then
beat him easily by twenty lengths. So just you put that in your
pipe, old man, and smoke it for all it is worth,"</i> and then
followed three closely-written pages of reasons for the writer's
so emphatic opinion.</p>

<br>

<p>"I'll take this," muttered Larose, nodding his head. "Yes and
it was this chatty, innocent letter that was probably
responsible, later, for Eli Barton's death. Black Wolf was to
have an easy run at any price&mdash;but, as I live, here is a
photograph of the animal himself!" He picked up a photograph
about three inches square, and, from its mounting, evidently the
work of an amateur. It was an excellent photograph, nevertheless,
and depicted a big, awkward-looking horse, just stripped for a
gallop, with his rider ready astride him.</p>

<p>"Fine big eyes," mused Larose, "sprightly cocked ears,
head&mdash;Hullo, hullo"&mdash;he drew in his breath with a low
whistle&mdash;"why, why, as I live again, it's that poor wretch,
Ferris, who's got the mount."</p>

<p>Stealthily he tiptoed to the window and held up the photo to
the light.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he murmured, "it's Master Ferris right enough. The
low, brutal forehead, the eyes close together, the weak,
self-indulgent chin. Yes, it's the mummy of the sands." He put
the photo in his pocket. "A nice picture for my gallery of
crime&mdash;Black Wolf and his trainer. Beast of Prey. I'll keep
this."</p>

<p>He turned back to the desk, but nothing of much interest
further rewarded his search until he suddenly lighted upon a
badly-scrawled and ill-written letter. His eyes gleamed when he
saw it was signed <i>"Sid Ferris,"</i> but to his disappointment
there was nothing particular in it. It was written from Adelaide
about six months previously, and was just a short business note
about some parts for a pump that Dice had evidently been
ordering.</p>

<p>"Hum. I'll keep that too, I think," remarked the detective.
"It may come in useful, perhaps." An amused smile crossed upon
his face. "Really, an idea is growing in my mind. Maybe, I'll
surprise you yet, Mr. James Dice."</p>

<p>He went rapidly through the remaining papers, and then, just,
as he was about to close the desk, a book marked 'Wages' caught
his eye. He turned over the pages until he came to some entries
under 'Ferris.'</p>

<p>"Two ten a week," he remarked to himself. "So that was what
the man got, was it? Paid every fortnight was it, too, and the
last payment on December 12th. Hum&mdash;so Master Ferris was
owed ten days' when he died, was he? Yes, and, I see, fifteen
shillings for some expenses as well. Now that gives me another
idea. I'll just tear out that page, I think." He shook his head.
"No, I won't. It's not necessary, and Dice might notice it,
perhaps."</p>

<p>He closed and re-locked the desk, and then turned his
attention to the wardrobe. There something worse almost than
disappointment awaited him. The jacket with the dark stains upon
it had been taken away. Three times he went over each garment
before he was sure and then he scowled disgustedly.</p>

<p>"That looks bad," he muttered, "very bad for me. The wretch
has taken precautions, just as I feared. He's got rid of it
somehow, for certain. Most likely he burnt it when they lit the
copper the other day. I thought then the wood smelt very rank." A
worried frown came over his face. "Gilbert, Gilbert," he went on,
"I believe you're losing grip!" He sighed deeply. "But I should
so like to nail the wretch. There's not a shadow of doubt but
that James Dice is a double murderer. But he's artful&mdash;he's
devilish artful now."</p>

<p>A few minutes later he was back again in the garage, and then,
long, long before the reverberant hum of its engine announced the
return of the big Punic car, he was only a faint black speck
among the sandhills far away from the station of Mundulla.</p>

<p>Dice had never wavered for one moment from the idea that his
late chauffeur was the detective, and he was confident now that
for all practical purposes he had done with the man.</p>

<p>Now his chief interest in Larose was just the speculation as
to what exactly would be the report that the discomfited
detective would be now making to his disappointed employers.</p>

<p>Indeed, he had thought a lot about the latter aspect of the
case, and, finally, had arrived at the conclusion that at any
rate neither Sam Gover nor young Barton knew anything about the
matter.</p>

<p>"It's the Times of Adelaide," the master of Mundulla sneered.
"It's that beastly rag that sent the fellow here." He wreathed
his face into a mocking smile. "Well, it's to be hoped they paid
him handsomely, for he certainly got some nasty shocks here, and
they couldn't have been too good for his nerves."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch29"></a>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>

<p class="first">ONCE more James Dice settled down into quite an
easy frame of mind, with the comfortable satisfaction that he had
proved more than a match even for the great Sydney detective,
Gilbert Larose.</p>

<p>The first intimation of any trouble came one morning from one
of the boundary riders on the station.</p>

<p>"So I see you've got Sid Ferris back, Mr. Dice," remarked the
man, "but he's certainly given himself a good holiday this
time."</p>

<p>"Sid Ferris," queried James Dice, as if not quite taking it
in, "why, what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, he's back here, isn't he?"</p>

<p>The master of Mundulla appeared to be amused.</p>

<p>"It's the first I've heard of it," he replied with a smile,
"and if it were so I should probably get to know of it at least
as soon as anybody else."</p>

<p>The man looked rather puzzled. "Well, I saw him last night,
and of course I thought he had returned here to work."</p>

<p>"Where did you see him?" asked Dice, but without much interest
in his voice.</p>

<p>"Down by the creek," replied the man. "He was riding old
Stumpy."</p>

<p>James Dice looked at him sarcastically.</p>

<p>"Stumpy," he remarked quietly, "never left the paddock all day
yesterday, and he was round by the house gate most of the
evening. Miss Margaret was feeding him with carrots after
tea."</p>

<p>"Well," said the boundary rider. "I couldn't swear to the
horse, because I wasn't near enough, but it being a grey one I
naturally thought it was Stumpy."</p>

<p>"Could you swear to the man, then?" asked James Dice very
dryly. The man seemed surprised at the question being asked.</p>

<p>"Oh yes&mdash;it was Ferris, without the slightest doubt.
Schafer was with me and he recognised him at once, too. He swam
across the creek and jumped up to him, barking all the time. He
was very excited, and followed after him as he rode away."</p>

<p>"Where did the man go then?" asked Dice, with a frown.</p>

<p>"Out away over the sandhills. I shouted to him, but he didn't
look up. I thought that was funny, I admit."</p>

<p>Dice shrugged his shoulders. "Well, I know nothing about it,"
he said. "He's certainly come nowhere near the house," and he
walked away as if he had no more interest in the matter at
all.</p>

<p>During all the rest of that day, however, in spite of his
certain knowledge that the man the boundary rider had seen could
not possibly have been Sid Ferris, Dice felt uneasy and
uncomfortable. He was restless, and kept harking back to what the
man had said.</p>

<p>Ever since it had come to him suddenly that afternoon upon the
bank of the river that his chauffeur, Beeton, was the detective,
Larose, his mind had been, so to speak, in an analytical phase,
and about every question that came now before him he had
automatically got into the habit of weighing up all the pros and
cons, as if he himself were a detective following up upon some
trail.</p>

<p>Why had Schafer, the dog, jumped up and been so friendly with
the strange man? What did it mean?</p>

<p>There was nothing in it, of course, he told himself, but still
it was certainly peculiar. Schafer, of all dogs he had known, was
not a friendly dog, and all the time he had been on the station
the animal had always consistently hated strangers, and had never
got on friendly terms quickly with anyone,
except&mdash;except&mdash;and the master of Mundulla remembered
it suddenly with a sort of pang&mdash;that damned brute,
Larose.</p>

<p>Larose!&mdash;Larose! Was the wretch going to worry him again?
he asked himself, and then he dismissed the idea at once as
preposterous.</p>

<p>What had Ferris to do with Larose? Larose had probably never
heard of the man, and there could be no possible link between the
two.</p>

<p>James Dice cursed himself for an idiot. Sid Ferris was dead.
With his own eyes he had seen the top of the head blown away, and
the very bones even would be picked white and clean by now. He
would not give the idea another thought.</p>

<p>The next day one of the station hands said he had seen Sid
Ferris. He told the cook so, and she repeated it to Margaret
Bevan, who in turn passed the news on to her uncle at
breakfast.</p>

<p>The man had passed Ferris, he said, the previous evening on
the Meningie road. Ferris was riding a grey horse, and he was
looking very ill. His head was bandaged, his face was ghastly
white, and he had got one arm in a sling. He had taken no notice
when he had been spoken to, but had just ridden straight on,
without even turning his head.</p>

<p>James Dice went grey with horror when his niece came out with
it at the meal, but fortunately she was too occupied with pouring
out the tea to notice her uncle's face.</p>

<p>He pretended, however, to be not much interested, and
suggested the man must have been drinking. Of course, Ferris
would have come at once up to the station if he had been anywhere
near.</p>

<p>He certainly got through the breakfast very well, but again by
himself, in his own room, his mouth became dry with fear. "What
the hell is happening now?" he asked himself. "It
couldn't&mdash;it couldn't be Ferris, but&mdash;good
God&mdash;the bandaged head and the broken arm!"</p>

<p>He sat down in his armchair and tried to think things calmly
over. Was there the chance&mdash;was there the remotest chance
that Sid Ferris was not dead after all? If the man were alive it
would be a terrible thing for him, for he would be completely in
his power.</p>

<p>But it was impossible, he told himself, absolutely impossible.
He went back in his mind over all that had happened that night on
the Coorong. He had seen Sid Ferris with his left arm hanging
free, then he had seen him with the top of his skull blown away,
and then he had buried him a good two feet under the sand. He
couldn't possibly have lived, even if the wounds had not been
mortal. He would have suffocated in a few seconds.</p>

<p>James Dice drew in a deep breath of relief. No, it was
ridiculous, but then&mdash;who was this man now riding about? He
was interrupted by his niece coming in to remind him that he was
taking her into the township that morning, and a few minutes
later he had, in part, thrown off his worry, in listening to her
bright conversation as she sat next to him in the car. But his
thoughts were thrown back into their unpleasant groove again
directly they arrived in Meningie.</p>

<p><br>
Almost immediately a friend he met mentioned Sid Ferris, and
remarked casually that the ex-jockey was looking "damned
bad."</p>

<p>James Dice choked back some sort of lump in his throat, and
asked his friend where he had seen Ferris.</p>

<p>"Last night," was the reply, "he passed me at the end of the
township, on the grey. He looked like a ghost, I thought, all
done up like that. What's the beggar been up to? Has he had a
fall, or been in a fight?"</p>

<p>But the master of Mundulla only remarked that Ferris was
always a drunken beast, and then turned the conversation to
another channel. He did not feel equal to going into
explanations, and, besides, he knew he had no explanations to
give.</p>

<p>He returned to the station in great despondency, and as an
excuse explained to his niece that he was not feeling very well.
That night he slept very badly, and long before morning came he
had to admit to himself that all his worries and anxiety had
returned.</p>

<p>As before, he was fighting against the unknown, and the
uncertainty as to whether he was in any danger or not took all
the courage out of him, and made him as limp as a rag.</p>

<p>On the morning but one following upon his visit to Meningie
with his niece he had another shock.</p>

<p>Just before eight o'clock he heard the telephone ring, and a
minute later the cook knocked at the bedroom door with a message
for him.</p>

<p>"It was Ferris, sir," she explained when her master had bidden
her to come in. "He'll be coming back in a day or two, he says,
but he's been very ill. In the meantime he asked me to remind you
that there's ten days' wages owing to him, and fifteen shillings
for expenses as well, and would you please send them to him at
the Post Office at Meningie. He said something else, sir, but his
voice was very low and weak, and I couldn't make out what it
was."</p>

<p>Dice made some sort of grunt that gave the cook to understand
he had received the message properly, and she at once retired
from the room.</p>

<p>For some minutes then there was no sound at all from the
occupant of the bed, and it might almost have been supposed that
he had dropped again to sleep. But the supposition would have
been very far from a right one, for James Dice was choking with
terror, and a muck sweat was drenching him from head to foot.</p>

<p>So Ferris was alive after all&mdash;the impossible had
happened, and somehow, like Sam Gover, he had risen from the
dead!</p>

<p>There was no getting away from it now, for who but Ferris
himself would possibly have known there were ten days' wages
owing to him and fifteen shillings for expenses besides?</p>

<p>Then, what would happen next? He shook with the terror as it
came to him suddenly that there must be some one else in the
secret now, besides Ferris himself. Ferris must have been found
and nursed somewhere, for with his dreadful wounds he could not
have revived by himself. Where had he been, too, all this time,
and how had he been hidden, when the police were searching high
and low for a wounded man?</p>

<p>Then, what was Ferris thinking himself? What was his attitude
of mind now? Could it possibly be that he had lost his memory,
and had no recollections of the happenings of that night? Had he
no idea as to who had shot him and subsequently buried him
beneath the sand? Had he no thought of vengeance? No, apparently
he could not have, for his message was that he was coming back.
But why, then, had he not returned before? If he had no ill-will
against his master why had he stayed away, and why had he been
haunting the station without coming near the house?</p>

<p>All that day James Dice sat on the veranda, brooding and
wondering what was going to happen next, and by nightfall he had
worked himself into a perfect torture of dreadful anticipation.
It was as if some deadly poison had entered into his mind. His
nerves were strung up to their highest pitch, and he started at
every sound about the house. The clicking of a door even, or the
rattling of a plate, brought great drops of perspiration to his
face.</p>

<p>He gave no thought at all to Larose now. The detective had
passed right out of his life again, and it was the bloody face of
Sid Ferris that was rising always before his eyes.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch30"></a>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>

<p class="first">THE next day, however, he had to pull himself
together somehow, for, as senior magistrate of the district, it
was his duty to preside over the sitting of the Court.</p>

<p>He told himself it was imperative that he should be there, for
the more he kept himself in the public eye, he had sense enough
to see, the stronger and more unassailable would be his position
if any suspicion should be raised about him later.</p>

<p>If it ever became a question of his word against Ferris's, it
would be well, he argued, that his should be supported by all the
weight of his important and responsible public position in the
district.</p>

<p>So he went into Meningie outwardly is if nothing had happened,
cold, proud and reserved, and as if he were the incarnation of
rectitude itself.</p>

<p>He presided with dignity over the sitting, and then, as usual,
adjourned to the hotel with his brother magistrates and some
friends for conversation and light refreshments, until the time
came for them to separate upon their several ways.</p>

<p>One part of the balcony upon the first floor was always kept
reserved for them upon these occasions, and, reclining on
comfortable chairs, and with long, cool drinks beside them, they
could, for the time, forget the arduous duties of the day.</p>

<p>For the moment James Dice had thrown off his depression and,
enlivened by the cheerful conversation of his companions, was
inclined to take quite a hopeful view of things again.</p>

<p>But his peace of mind, even there, was destined to be of short
duration, for suddenly one of his friends called out
interestedly:</p>

<p>"Here you are, Dice, here's that old, bad egg of yours again,"
and the speaker leant over the balcony and looked down the
street.</p>

<p>At first Dice had no idea what his friend meant but, turning
his eyes round in the direction in which everyone was now gazing,
they fell upon a horseman, about a hundred yards away. The man
was riding a grey horse, and he was coming slowly up the street
towards them.</p>

<p>It was Sid Ferris!</p>

<p>Dice's heart thumped like a piston, and his legs shook under
him. His mind was gripped in dreadful fear, and with hard, set
lips he stared at the advancing horseman as if he were regarding
an apparition from the dead. He wetted his dry lips with his
tongue, and he clenched his hands so tightly that the nails dug
into the flesh.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it. It was the ex-jockey that he
thought he had killed, and he was dressed in exactly the same
clothes that he had worn that night upon the Coorong.</p>

<p>A dirty red neck-cloth, a shabby old grey coat, tattered
riding breeches, of a faded brown, and wrinkled pigskin leggings.
He was wearing a battered old felt hat, low down upon his
forehead, and not much of the upper part of his face could be
seen, but here was no mistaking that stubbly little moustache and
the narrow peaked chin. He looked weak and ill, and his skin was
of a peculiar deathly white. He carried his left arm in a sling,
and there was a broad bandage over the back of his head. He rode
all hunched up with his feet high in the stirrups. He was on the
other side of the road, away from the hotel.</p>

<p>"Nice looking chap, that lad of yours," banteringly remarked
the man who had spoken before. "A most respectable looking
individual for our Senior Justice to be employing. Upon my soul,
Dice," he went on, "you ought to give the beggar six months. He'd
do with a wash as well."</p>

<p>But Dice took no notice of the remarks. His eyes were glued
upon the approaching figure, and every faculty he possessed was
concentrated to take in the meaning of it all.</p>

<p>The horse came slowly on, in a slow ambling trot. The rider
was gazing straight out before him, and he rode like a man in a
dream. He drew level with the hotel veranda.</p>

<p>"By Jove, but how ill he looks," commented the facetious man.
"Too much Scotch wine, I expect. No prohibitionist there!"</p>

<p>But no one followed up his remarks. They were only mildly
interested, and, if the Senior Justice himself were disinclined
to make any comments about his servant, then politeness forbade
any further curiosity at all.</p>

<p><br>
Slowly the horse and its rider passed before the hotel, but,
when about 10 yards beyond, a big lorry was suddenly backed out
of a side street, and the horseman was obliged in consequence to
pull his mount up sharply.</p>

<p>The horse swerved a little under the bit, and, turning
half-sideways, brought the back of his rider in a clear
straight line with the veranda of the hotel.</p>

<p>Dice was still staring with the intensity of one held
spellbound. The bunched up figure on the horse, he knew, meant
ruin and perhaps death for him, and his mind, alert and quickened
by the menace, took in feverishly the minutest details of the
man.</p>

<p>How often had he not seen that shabby hat and coat before! How
often had his eyes been offended with the dirty neck-cloth that
the fellow wore! How many times&mdash;but suddenly another memory
flashed up strangely to his mind. What freak of recollection was
it that touched him now?</p>

<p>Where had he seen that neck before, that neck and those
well-shaped ears? The recollection of them seemed later and much
more recent than that of the other points about the man. No, they
didn't remind him of Sid Ferris at all; they struck quite a
different chord in his memory, and he was sure he had seen them
many times before.</p>

<p>They seemed&mdash;ah! he knew what they reminded him of now.
They were just like those of Beeton, the chauffeur. He had not
sat behind Beeton for hundreds of miles for nothing, and so many
times he had noticed those ears.</p>

<p>Yes, they were Beeton's, not Ferris's. He was sure of it. They
were not Ferris's at all.</p>

<p>Beeton? He half rose from his chair, and, quick as lightning,
another thought flashed through him, too.</p>

<p>Larose! Of course it was Larose again!</p>

<p>He bent forward over the balcony, but the horseman had
disappeared. A motor was passing, and for the moment everything
was obscured in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p>With an oath he sprang to his feet, resolved to run down into
the street, but a second's reflection, and he subsided again into
his seat.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders contemptuously. What did it matter
if he knew for certain that the rider was Larose? He would be
only making a fool of himself if he ran after the man, and he was
not exactly sure what he could do if he did catch him up. No, he
must be careful. There was something in this he did not
understand. Why was Larose now masquerading, as he believed, as
the dead Sid Ferris? What did Larose know of Sid Ferris, and who
had helped him to disguise himself as the dead man? There must be
more than one in the plot now.</p>

<p>The sweat of fear again spread over Dice's forehead, and all
the exultant triumph of a few seconds back died down in the
horrible torment of uncertainty.</p>

<p>Many, many times, during the next twenty-four hours Dice
wished that, danger or no danger, he had kept his first resolve
and run after the man on the grey horse.</p>

<p>He felt now that the uncertainty of everything was killing
him. Again he expected danger at every turn, and the torment of
it was that he had no idea from what direction it would come.</p>

<p>He was sure of nothing now, and his mind felt drugged. He was
absolutely bewildered.</p>

<p>He was not certain any longer, even, that the horseman, after
all, was not Sid Ferris.</p>

<p>The confident conviction he had first formed that the neck and
ears belonged to Larose had gradually grown weak and thin, and he
had cursed himself over and over again that he had not followed
the horseman and made sure. Then, at any rate, he would have
known where he was.</p>

<p>Finally, he told himself that things could not go on any
longer as they were, and that he must get some peace of mind at
any price. It would be very simple to clear up everything if he
had only got the nerve.</p>

<p>He remembered to a foot where he had buried Sid Ferris, and
nothing would be easier for him, he was sure, than just to scrape
away a little of the sand and see if the body were still
there.</p>

<p>Yes, he would do it straightaway.</p>

<p>That night he announced his intention of going fishing the
next day, and he asked his niece to arrange for some sandwiches
to be got ready for him early next morning. He patted the girl
affectionately on the cheek. No, he preferred to go alone, for
once. He would be glad of the solitude, for he had a lot of
business matters to think over.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch31"></a>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>

<p class="first">IT had often been insisted by the admirer's of
Larose that the great detective was never seen to better
advantage than when his fortunes were apparently at their lowest
ebb.</p>

<p>Confronted with a failure that it seemed absolutely impossible
to avoid, and seemingly overwhelmed by difficulties from which
there was no escape, he would complacently turn off from his
original course, only to reappear in a few days or weeks with
victory well in sight.</p>

<p>His powers of recovery were wonderful. He was never long
discouraged, for it was always his belief that success in
everything came rather to the patient rather than to the
strong.</p>

<p>And so it was now in the case of James Dice. Larose had been
deeply chagrined at having to leave Mundulla without achieving
his end, and it had been not a small blow to his pride that its
master had succeeded in unmasking him.</p>

<p>He had been so certain of success at one time and so sure that
he was actually on the very point of linking up James Dice with
the destroyer of Eli Barton.. ..</p>

<p>And then, just when everything had seemingly been going on so
well, had come the man's sudden and unaccountable change of
manner, his ill-disguised contempt for the chauffeur, Beeton; his
vicious desire to do his servant harm, and, finally, the open and
murderous attack that evening upon the bank of the creek.</p>

<p>Yes, it had certainly been very unfortunate, and Larose had
sighed deeply when trudging wearily back in the darkness that
night to Meningie, but, still&mdash;still, he had thought, all
was not lost yet. He would just have to work in other ways. That
was all.</p>

<p>And James Dice had soon come to experience what those other
ways were. Larose had sought out Abel Black again, and, to his
delight, had found that the policeman was not only willing but
well enough and free to help him.</p>

<p>Black was now convalescing from his illness, and had been
given a month's leave by the authorities to recover his health
completely.</p>

<p>Larose had confided in him, or at any rate, had confided in
him as much as he had thought fit, and between them both they had
brought the dead Ferris back to life.</p>

<p>Larose had a different object in view. If he had failed in
linking up James Dice with Eli Barton, well, he would try now to
link him up with Sid Ferris, for, he rightly argued that if he
could establish his guilt as the murderer of Sid Ferris, then by
circumstantial evidence it could certainly be brought home that
he was the murderer of Eli Barton, also.</p>

<p><br>
So Sid Ferris was to be the bait now, and it was Larose's
object to make Dice betray the fact that he knew the ex-jockey
had been murdered, and knew also where the body lay.</p>

<p>Dice must be lured back somehow to the grave he had dug by the
thirty-fifth mile post on the Coorong, and there must be
witnesses to prove that he had returned there.</p>

<p>And the witnesses Larose was choosing were Abel Black and the
camera.</p>

<p>The next morning if any stranger had been leaning against the
thirty-fifth mile post, he would have been quite certain that he
was all alone in that vast wildernesses of sand, and that for the
moment, at all events, he was free from the inquisitive peering
of human eyes. There was not a sign of habitation, not a sign of
any human being, anywhere&mdash;only the sea and the sand and the
sky.</p>

<p>Behind a sand hummock, less than a hundred yards away, there
was parked a small light car, and close behind it was erected
quite a comfortable-looking little bell tent. More than that, not
even 50 yards distant from where he would have stood, a small pit
had been dug, and in it were two men.</p>

<p>It was the trap of Larose.</p>

<p>The mouth of the pit had been carefully screened over with a
length of canvas of exactly the same colour as the surrounding
sand, and hidden among some high tufts of coarse grass was the
top of a good sized camera, the lens of which had been most
carefully focussed upon one particular spot.</p>

<p><br>
Larose, the detective, was setting his trap with all the
scrupulous attention to detail that he had learnt from long years
of association with the tracking of crime.</p>

<p>"Now, Black," he said impressively, "if we have measured
things up correctly, within forty-eight hours at most some one
will come and start digging by that bank over there, and we've
got to get his picture directly he begins turning the sand. We
shall have plenty of warning of his coming, for unless a strong
wind blows up we shall hear his car at least a couple of miles
away. He'll come in the day-time, too, for there will be no moon
up to-night, and apart from that he'd know his car would be more
likely to attract notice, both leaving and returning home, if he
travelled by night. So he'll come by day, I say, and I expect
early, too, to avoid any meeting with other cars. But we must
leave nothing to chance, and every moment, day and night, one or
other of us must be on the watch. If he doesn't put in an
appearance today, then to make certain we'll have to take it in
turns to watch for him to-night."</p>

<p>The policeman assented joyfully, for surely in all Australia
there was no happier man now than Abel Black. Was he not working
in harness, he kept on reminding himself, with the great Larose?
Was he not going to make history, and would he not remember these
days for all the remainder of his life? He was indeed a fortunate
man.</p>

<p>It was true he did not quite understand what was going on, and
that he had no idea at all who exactly was the person the
detective was expecting to come and dig, but then those, he told
himself, were quite minor considerations when he remembered that
he was acting as the colleague of Larose.</p>

<p>All that day, save for a few minutes when they each, in turn,
made for the tent to snatch a little food, they sat watching on
the sandhill. But there was no sign of the Punic at all. Three
other cars passed, at long intervals. They were all going towards
Adelaide, and Larose began wondering uneasily if by any chance
their appearance had frightened James Dice away, and that the
latter had thought better of his project and turned back.</p>

<p>But then Larose remembered how correct hitherto had been his
estimate of James Dice, and he consoled himself with the thought
that he had every reason to expect the man to come.</p>

<p>By seven in the evening it was almost dark and, according to
the arrangements they had made, Black turned in to the tent to
get some sleep. He was to be free for six hours, and he wanted
rest badly. In the excitement of the previous night they had
neither of them really had any sleep, and the policeman was now
beginning to feel quite done up. He was still weak after his
illness.</p>

<p>So, directly he lay down, he dropped into heavy sleep, and
when Larose called him at one o'clock in the morning the poor
fellow wished devoutly that he could have had six hours
more.</p>

<p>But if the policeman had been able to sleep every moment of
his time, it was very different with Larose, who could not sleep
at all. He had a splitting headache and his limbs were
aching&mdash;so much so that he believed he had caught a chill.
He tossed and turned and turned and tossed, and when dawn at last
came was quite relieved for an excuse to get up.</p>

<p><br>
He made himself a cup of strong coffee and then, feeling a
little better, joined Black at the top of the sandhill.</p>

<p>"Now, my boy," he said with a great air of vivacity, "the
critical time is coming. Between now and say ten o'clock our bird
will walk into the net. You see if he doesn't."</p>

<p>The policeman rubbed his hands together with a feeling of joy
in his heart. Like Larose, he was feeling dead tired, but
expectation of the triumph to come made him for the moment forget
everything, except, yet once more, that he was the colleague of
this great man.</p>

<p>"You see," went on Larose impressively, "the camera will catch
him in the very act and, for the time being, he need have no idea
at all that he has been seen. The picture will be the last link
in the chain of evidence that we have forged."</p>

<p>Black simply thrilled with ecstasy at the sound of the word
"we."</p>

<p>"Of course," went on Larose, "we could shoot him down at once
instead of taking his photograph, but we should hardly be
justified in that. Instead, we will just quietly arrest him in a
day or two's time, and it will be you who will execute the
warrant."</p>

<p>Black rubbed his hands together again in his joy, and nodded
his head, too overcome to speak.</p>

<p>The sun rose hot and coppery, with all prospects of another
scorching day, but towards eight o'clock the sky clouded over
quickly and a soft breeze began sighing up from the sea.</p>

<p>"Cool change coming," muttered Larose, "and by to-night the
sand will be whirling all over the place, I bet."</p>

<p>The detective was beginning to get really anxious. He had
believed so confidently that James Dice would fall into the trap,
and in his own mind he had calculated almost to the very hour
when the man was most likely to appear.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch32"></a>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>

<p class="first">THAT very morning it would be, he had told
himself, and at about nine o'clock.</p>

<p>He reckoned Dice would leave Mundulla Station very early, and
that about three hours' driving, at most, would bring him to the
spot.</p>

<p>But nine o'clock came, and nothing happened. Ten
o'clock&mdash;eleven, and then twelve.</p>

<p>Larose was quite sick with disappointment then, and faint
almost for want of sleep.</p>

<p>"This will never do," he told himself. "I am failing at the
very critical moment of the whole business. At all events I must
get some rest." He turned to Abel Black. "Look here, old man," he
said wearily, "I'm feeling a bit crook and think I'd better go
and lie down a little while. I shan't go to sleep and I shall
hear any motor just as quickly as you, but still, if you hear
anything coming, give me a shout at once," and with steps that
were stumbling and unsteady he turned off towards the tent.</p>

<p>With every muscle in him aching, he stretched himself upon the
ground sheet and, with his head upon the rug that he had folded
for a pillow, shut his eyes and devoutly hoped for some
relief.</p>

<p>But he soon got more than that. Sleep, that had denied herself
to him when, in the night, he had courted her so ardently, now
flung herself brazenly upon him and would accept no repulse. In
two minutes he was drowsy and in five he was fast asleep.
Everything was forgotten&mdash;Eli Barton and James Dice, Sid
Ferris and Policeman Black, the crime and all its consequences,
the slayer and the slain. All, all were drugged to sweet oblivion
in the opiate of gentle sleep.</p>

<p>Half an hour later Abel Black peeped into the tent and smiled
affectionately when he saw the detective sleeping.</p>

<p>"Wonderful man," he muttered, "and just like a little child.
He unravels everything as if he were just playing with a box of
bricks. But, thank the Lord, he's getting some sleep now."</p>

<p>The policeman returned to his watch upon the sandhill, and,
stretching at full length, pillowed his own head luxuriously upon
his arm.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's bonzer to lie down," he murmured, "and there's
nothing nicer in all the world than a good old sleep. I'll have
one presently, too, when my turn comes." His thoughts ran on.
"But I do wish this damned motor car would turn up. Larose can't
be wrong." He yawned wearily&mdash;a great big yawn, and then
shut his eyes for a moment to feel how it would be if he himself
were free to sleep. He opened them reluctantly in a moment, and
looked lazily round. Nothing in sight, of course. He slowly shut
them again, and, half a minute later&mdash;he too was fast
asleep.</p>

<p><br>
Poor Larose, poor Policeman Black! They were both so tired,
and they could fight Nature no more. Exhaustion had made them
weak; and their slumbers were deep and holding.</p>

<p>So it happened that neither of them, about an hour later,
heard the faint hum of a distant motor car, neither of them saw
it ploughing its way laboriously through a stretch of heavy sand
about a quarter of a mile away, neither noticed the sudden
stopping of the engine, less even, than a couple of hundred yards
away, and neither of them saw a man running breathlessly in their
direction, with a spade upon his shoulder and with his eyes and
mouth agape with fear.</p>

<p>No&mdash;they saw none of those things, for their sleep
encompassed them and their world was, for the time, a world only
of heavy and never to be remembered dreams.</p>

<p>It was nearly six o'clock in the evening before Larose awoke.
The wind had freshened to a stiffish breeze, and it was the
flapping of the tent door that first aroused him. He blinked his
eyes dreamily and then, suddenly realising where he was, jumped
instantly to his feet, and in a second was out of the tent. He
stared in horrified surprise. The sun was quite low in the sky,
and the sandhills were casting long shadows over the Coorong.</p>

<p>He looked at his watch; in five minutes it would be six
o'clock. He gasped in disappointment. So nothing had happened and
the day was gone. Abel Black had allowed him to sleep for six
hours.</p>

<p>He felt weak and tottery, but some dreadful apprehension
suddenly seized him and lent him strength. He ran round the
sandhill to where he had left his companion. Abel Black was fast
asleep.</p>

<p>For a second the detective stood gazing stonily upon the
policeman, too chagrined and too angry even to speak. Then his
eyes roamed round and they fell suddenly upon the spot where the
mummified body of Sid Ferris had lain just beneath the sand. The
sand was all disturbed.</p>

<p>For a moment he stood gaping with his mouth wide open, and
then with a low cry of despair he rushed furiously over towards
the bank.</p>

<p>Yes, some man had been there. There were footprints all over
the place. He had been digging with a spade&mdash;he had&mdash;Oh
Heavens! there was a great hole in the sand. The body had been
taken away!</p>

<p>In the barest fraction of a second he saw it all and then in
another fraction, automatically as it were, his agony of mind was
giving place to the life-long instinct of the detective on the
trail.</p>

<p>His eyes flashed round to see from what direction the
footsteps had come, and instantly they showed him much more than
that.</p>

<p>Some one had been dragging a burden over the sands, and there
was a strange peculiarity about the marks it had left in its
track.</p>

<p>"He was dragging it by one heel," hoarsely exclaimed the
detective, "and those are the impressions of the head and the
broken arm."</p>

<p>His eyes followed up the markings in the sand, and then,
forgetful of his weakness and fatigue, he ran feverishly to see
where they would end.</p>

<p>He had not very far to go. A hundred yards&mdash;another fifty
and then just before him on the track was a stretch of drifted
sand. The stretch was about twenty yards broad, and then, on the
farther side, the track was firmer and there was only just a
little sand.</p>

<p>The detective gave almost a cry of pain. The impression of the
dragged body ended there, and it ended just where there were
signs that a big motor car had been turned round. With his heart
beating like a piston, he bent down over the impression of the
wheels. The south wind was slowly filling them with sand, but
they were not quite obliterated yet.</p>

<p>"The tyres of the Punic," he groaned. "I knew it, I knew
it."</p>

<p>It was easy to see what had happened.</p>

<p>The driver of the car, seeing the deep drift of sand across
the track and knowing he was so near the place that he was
wanting to reach, had not taken the risk to drop on lowest gear
and plough through it. Instead, he had just turned the car round,
and completed his journey on foot.</p>

<p>For a long minute Larose stood weighing up everything in his
mind. It would be hopeless to try and follow up the car. It might
have come and gone hours and hours ago; the very effects of the
wind on the sand showed that a pretty considerable time must have
passed since it left. James Dice had been the man, of course, and
the reason for his snatching the body was quite plain. He would
have seen at once that it had been meddled with and the clothes
stripped off and taken away, and he had judged that safety lay
best in hiding the body again, so that whatever happened it could
not be produced in evidence against him.</p>

<p>And where had he re-buried it?</p>

<p>Tears almost came into Larose's eyes when he thought of the
thirty-five miles of lonely road with sand everywhere on either
side; with the thousand upon thousand of little gullies which
might safely hide almost a million bodies, let alone a single
one.</p>

<p>The wind, too, was dead against him now. Blowing up as it was,
it would obliterate in less even than half an hour all footsteps
of any person turning off the track.</p>

<p>No&mdash;it was no good; all further search was hopeless
now.</p>

<p>He had failed&mdash;and failed just at the last moment,
because, instead of relying upon himself, he had relied upon
Policeman Black. Ah!&mdash;Policeman Black! He would choke the
fellow. He would just tell him what a clod he was. The wretch
should suffer for it now and all his life. His mind should rankle
with the thought of how he had betrayed his trust. He, Larose,
knew how to punish him. He knew how to make him wince. He had not
been blind to the fellow's hero worship. He had seen all along
that the fool was in the seventh heaven because they had been
working side by side. Well, he would loose a scathing tongue upon
him now, and would gall his feelings to the very quick.</p>

<p>Full of this idea of punishment, Larose strode quickly back.
The policeman was just where he had been left, still asleep.
Larose bent down to shake him roughly by the collar, but then
something, strangely, made him stay his hand.</p>

<p>The man was smiling in his sleep. He was smiling like a little
child. His chest rose and fell ever so softly, and there was
about his whole pose the abandon of perfect peace and rest.</p>

<p>Larose sneered to himself. "He's quite happy anyhow; he's
dreaming that he's a great detective perhaps&mdash;he
thinks"&mdash;but the sneer died suddenly from the detective's
face, and a great pity surged there in its stead. "Poor chap," he
muttered huskily, "how pale and thin he looks. No, no, I can't
blame him. It's all my fault for not remembering he'd been ill. I
expected too much. I made no allowance for the state of weakness
he's still in. I'm the duffer every time," and the detective
crept quietly away.</p>

<p>Half an hour later and a loud honking from the little car
brought Policeman Black abruptly to his feet. He looked guiltily
round and, to his amazement, found it was beginning to get
dark.</p>

<p>"By gosh," he stuttered, "I must have been asleep&mdash;and
all the afternoon, too! My God!"</p>

<p>He rubbed his knuckles vigorously into his eyes and, pulling
his cap hard down upon his head, strode round the back of the
sandhill to the tent.</p>

<p>There was a bright fire burning and Larose was just sugaring a
large billy of freshly steaming tea.</p>

<p>"Come on, old man," called out the detective heartily. "I
thought you'd hear the bell, and you must be just about ready for
a good tea now. We've had nothing much all day."</p>

<p>The policeman looked with great relief at his companion. So it
was all right, and Larose didn't know. He took a hunk of bread
and cheese and with great relish began to eat.</p>

<p>"Bad luck," went on Larose cheerfully. "I'm afraid the beggar
won't come now." He smiled whimsically. "I expect his car must
have broken down."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch33">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>

<p class="first">A FEW days after the return of Larose and
Policeman Black from the Coorong, a dapper and well-dressed man
inquired at the bureau of the Australasian Hotel, in Adelaide,
for Mr. Gover. He was informed that that gentleman had left the
city, and for the present was staying along with his friend, Mr.
Stanley Barton, at Mundulla, near Meningie, on the station of a
Mr. James Dice.</p>

<p>The stranger thanked the clerk for his information, and at
once left the hotel.</p>

<p>The following day just before noon, the telephone rang at
Mundulla, and some one with a deep, rich voice inquired if he
could speak for a moment to Mr. Samuel Gover.</p>

<p>Mr. Gover happened to be close by, and almost at once was
handling the receiver.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Mr. Gover?" came the rich, deep voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply, "Mr. Gover speaking."</p>

<p>"Don't make any remark, then," came a sharp reply, in quite a
different voice. "Don't say a word, please, don't speak until I
tell you. I'm Larose, Gilbert Larose."</p>

<p>There was a tense silence for a moment, and then Larose went
on: "Now answer me in monosyllables, please. Just a plain yes or
no. Are you quite alone in the hall?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Is there anyone about? Speak more quietly, please."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Dice in the house?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Has he gone out then?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I mean, has he gone quite away from the place?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"He's out on the station?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"All right then, you can be more explicit. When is he expected
back?&mdash;but continue to speak quietly, please."</p>

<p>"Not until this evening, just before dinner, I think."</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Stanley in the house with you?"</p>

<p>"No, he's gone out for a walk with Miss Bevan. I was here
alone, writing letters, when the telephone rang."</p>

<p>"Good. Then I want to see you at once."</p>

<p>"Where are you ringing from?"</p>

<p>"From Meningie. But now listen. I can be out in a little over
an hour. I won't come up to the house, for a reason that I'll
explain later. Meet me at the turning on the Meningie road, at
two o'clock. You'll have just about a mile to walk, that's all,
and I'll be waiting for you in a biscuit-coloured car. Don't
mention a thing to any one. Not even to Mr. Stanley. You
understand. Make the excuse you are going to have a pot at the
rabbits."</p>

<p>"All right, but you're very mysterious, my friend."</p>

<p>"I shan't be so long," and the telephone bell rang off.</p>

<p>Some minutes before two Sam Gover, with a small rifle over his
shoulder, turned off from the station track into the Meningie
Road, and, almost before he had had time to look round, was met
by a biscuit-coloured car.</p>

<p>"Jump-in," said its driver quickly. "It's not wise to talk
here."</p>

<p><br>
For about three miles the car proceeded on its journey, and
then, skirting round the base of a high sandhill, Larose, who was
the driver, slowed down.</p>

<p>"We'll pull in here, just off the track," he announced. "Then
if any one goes by they'll either miss us altogether or else
think we are here after duck. Now, let's get out and have a quiet
talk."</p>

<p>They walked about fifty yards away from the car and sat down
upon a bank of sand. Sam Gover took out his case and began
puffing nervously at a cigarette. Somehow, he sensed an
unpleasant surprise approaching.</p>

<p>The detective looked at him very solemnly, and came at once
straight to the point.</p>

<p>"James Dice killed your friend," he said quietly. "He was the
murderer, without a doubt."</p>

<p>"Ah," from the old man. He sat up, stiff as a rock, and glared
incredulously at Larose. His face got very pale, and dark shadows
came under his eyes.</p>

<p>"Yes," went on Larose, "James Dice was the murderer, but
unhappily we have not got the legal proof."</p>

<p>The old man found his tongue.</p>

<p>"You're a fool," he burst out impulsively. "The thing's
impossible."</p>

<p>"It's a fact though," said Larose quietly. "James Dice killed
Eli Barton, and the small man who decoyed you, too. He was called
Sid Ferris, and was in Dice's employ."</p>

<p>Sam Gover leant back and drew in a deep breath.</p>

<p>"Man, man, it's not true," he exclaimed. "It's too horrible. I
don't believe it. Prove it to me." His voice became angry and
resentful. "But you say you've got no proof. What do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"No legal proof," corrected the detective. "Unhappily, I
haven't evidence enough to make him hang, but I'll convince you
that I'm right in ten minutes. Now listen."</p>

<p>"And I'll want some convincing, I tell you," said the old man
fiercely. "I'll want convincing proof."</p>

<p>Larose took a large envelope out of his breast pocket, but,
without opening it, laid it across his knees.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Gover," he said, in brisk and business-like tones,
"I'll put all the cards upon the table and tell you frankly where
I succeeded and where I failed."</p>

<p>Larose leant forward and his voice became low and stern. "I
found the body of the small man who had swung the hurricane
lantern that night when you were held up. It lay buried close
near where you showed me the little car had been."</p>

<p>"Good God!" gasped Sam Gover. "But I didn't kill him. I'm sure
of that."</p>

<p>"No, you didn't kill him, you only shattered his elbow with
your shot. Dice killed him because he couldn't be hampered with a
wounded man. He realised the wound would require more explaining
than he could give, and with any inquiries being made, things
might get dangerous for him. So he just blew out the man's brains
with the same revolver that he used upon your friend. But now,
please, look at these photographs here. The first one is of the
body I dug up."</p>

<p>With shaking hands Sam Gover took the photo that the detective
held out, and at once his face went white to the lips.</p>

<p>But the picture was terrible enough to nauseate anyone. It
showed a shrivelled, naked body outstretched upon some sand. A
body ape-like and unhuman. Its skin was black and wrinkled, and
its face had dreadful sockets where the eyes had been. Its mouth
was bared and snarling over big protruding teeth, and its
forehead was all fouled with stains of mottled jet black blood.
Its limbs hung stiff, like sticks of wood.</p>

<p>"But, how did you find it?" whispered Sam Gover through his
dry white lips.</p>

<p>"I took a dog with me," replied Larose, "and went back to the
place where I had been with you and Mr. Stanley that night. I was
quite certain that a body was hidden near." The detective
shrugged his shoulders. "We soon found it. It had become
mummified by the absence of moisture, and the intense heat under
the sands."</p>

<p>"But how do you know," asked old Gover shakily, "that this
body is that of the man who waved the lamp that night? That this
was the man I shot?"</p>

<p>The detective passed over another photograph. "Well, look at
this&mdash;it's an enlargement of the left arm. You can see the
wound plainly, just on the elbow. That's where you hit him. See
the sharp, clear wound that your little automatic made, and now
look at this third photo&mdash;one this time of the head and
face, enlarged. See the hole here which the bullet that killed
him made. Notice how large the hole is, and how it bulged the
plate of bone as it came out again. A big revolver was used
there, and fired almost at point blank range."</p>

<p>"A .455 most likely," muttered old Gover. "The old cavalry
type, last used in the Boer War."</p>

<p>"Exactly," said Larose dryly, "and you remember that James
Dice was out there too. Now, look at this next photo, and you
must examine it very carefully, please. It's of the body, just as
I found it and before I stripped off the clothes. See the grey
jacket and the old baggy riding breeches and look at the shape of
those leggings. Notice how the bottoms curl up over the boots.
They look to me at least a dozen years old. Now for quite a
different photograph, photograph number five."</p>

<p>This time the photograph the detective held out was roughly
mounted on cardboard, and showed a man astride a rather
ugly-looking, black horse. But the animal had a beautiful head,
and right in the middle of his forehead was a big,
irregular-looking, white star. The rider was looking straight
into the camera.</p>

<p>"Now," said Larose briskly, "we'll just compare two of these
photographs, side by side. The one of the enlarged head and face
of the mummy and the other of the face of the man on the horse.
Look at them together, and tell me what you see."</p>

<p>For a minute there was silence and the old man intently
regarded the photographs upon his knee.</p>

<p>"I know what you mean," he said very slowly, after a
while&mdash;"they're both of the same man. They're both wearing
the same clothes."</p>

<p>"Not a doubt about it," said Larose. "There can be no mistake
there. Look at the peculiarly-shaped oval face, look at the low
forehead and above everything notice the narrow space between the
eyes. It doesn't want two glances to see that they are the same
man. Now for my last picture, and it's a Press photo this time."
His voice became very grave and solemn. "It's a picture from The
Times of Adelaide of Black Wolf, the winner of the Adelaide
Christmas Cup."</p>

<p>Sam Gover took the paper with hands that trembled. He knew
what was coming, for he had already recognised the horse in the
mounted photograph as Black Wolf. To a man with a keen eye for
horses there could be no mistaking the fine black head and the
irregular-shaped white star upon the forehead.</p>

<p>"Now read what it goes on to say underneath," said Larose
briskly. "'Black Wolf,' etc., etc., 'was trained privately by his
fortunate owner, Mr. James Dice, at Mundulla, but it must not be
forgotten that he has all along had the valuable assistance of
the one time crack jockey, Sid Ferris, of New South Wales. To the
present generation the name of Sid Ferris will recall no
memories, but five and twenty years ago there was no finer nor
more promising lightweight than the pilot of Hornet's Beauty in
the Caulfield Cup.'"</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch34"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>

<p class="first">"NOW, Mr. Gover," said Detective Larose quietly,
"have I fully established in your mind the connection between the
man you shot and the man who helped James Dice in the training of
Black Wolf?"</p>

<p>"Go on," said Sam Gover gruffly, without replying to the
question. "Let's hear the rest."</p>

<p>The detective carefully replaced all the photographs in the
envelope and then proceeded to light a cigarette.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, after a short pause, "at the time I dug up
that body I hadn't the remotest idea whose it was. I only knew,
from what I had learnt from you, that it must be one of the men
who had held you up, and I was sanguine that we should get to his
companion through it. After I had taken the photographs you have
just seen I reburied the body in the same place. I had no mind to
take anybody into my confidence just then, least of all the
police. I wanted no publicity. I have no official position now,
as you know, and my inquiry was quite a private one, on your
behalf. I work in my own way, and it was my trump card that the
double murderer should have no inkling that the body of his
second victim had been found. So, I just covered up all my traces
and came away. Then I started at once to find out who the dead
man was, and believing, as I have told you, that the hold-up had
been a hurriedly arranged local affair, I of course tried
Meningie first of all. I had something very definite to go upon,
however, from the general appearance of the body for I was sure
the dead man had been a jockey at some time or other. He had had
bones broken all over him, and in some places they had been
broken several times. Also, I saw from the markings on the soles
of his boots that he was accustomed to ride with high stirrups,
as jockeys always do. Well, as I say, I began prospecting at
Meningie, and I struck oil at once. I disclosed my identity to
the township policeman, and I asked him if he knew of the absence
of anybody from the neighbourhood since about last Christmas. I
added that the man I wanted to find out about had been a jockey
once. The police was able to tell me instantly." Larose looked
intently at Sam Gover, and almost whispered his next words, "Mr.
Dice's station-hand, Sid Ferris, had not been seen in the
township since December 22."</p>

<p>"How did he remember the date?" asked the old man sharply, but
with his eyes averted from the detective's face.</p>

<p>"Because he had to go to the hotel that morning, on the 22nd,
to interview the proprietor about his licence. He remembered that
the man Ferris was in the bar, because he heard him telling
people not to back Black Wolf. The incident was all the more
impressed upon his mind because when the horse afterwards won, a
lot of people were on the lookout for Ferris, to give him a bit
of their minds. The time, too," added Larose significantly, "was
just before one o'clock, which would about coincide, wouldn't it,
with the message from you and Eli Barton that was passed on from
the hotel at Kingston?"</p>

<p>"Go on," said Sam Gover still gruffly. "Go on&mdash;you're a
long way from the end yet."</p>

<p>"Well," continued Larose, "the information that the policeman
gave me, of course, at once made me think hard about Ferris's
master, James Dice. In common with everybody else, I had heard
Dice had been a big winner over Black Wolf, but that in itself
had had no particular significance for me as regards the murder
of Mr. Barton, and I had hardly given the connection a second
thought. After all, it is still only supposition that Abimeleck
would have won had he been in the race, and it would certainly
have been ridiculously far-fetched to have suspected the owner of
Black Wolf simply because he had benefited by the absence of Mr.
Barton's horse that day.</p>

<p>"So, as I say, the fact that Dice had brought off a big coup
with Black Wolf had not suggested to my mind any complicity in
the murder of Mr. Barton. It was in no way significant by itself,
but"&mdash;Larose paused for a moment here and his voice was
deadly now&mdash;"it became very significant when I learnt that
one of the two men who had held you up that night on the Coorong
was a man in Mr. Dice's employ. It had an ugly look&mdash;a very
ugly look, I tell you."</p>

<p><br>
Sam Gover made no remark; indeed, it might almost have been
said he was not listening. He was looking straight out before
him, over the sands, and there was no particular expression on
his face. The detective went on. "Well, I made it my business at
once to get in touch with James Dice. No matter how I managed it,
but Dice's chauffeur left in a hurry, and I got taken on in his
place."</p>

<p>"What, at the station?" asked Sam Gover turning round sharply
and in an incredulous tone of voice.</p>

<p>"Yes, at Mundulla. I was five weeks there. I was Beeton, the
chauffeur."</p>

<p>"Good God!&mdash;and he never found you out?"</p>

<p>The detective looked embarrassed. He blushed
uncomfortably.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, Mr. Gover, but he did find me out. I don't know
how it happened. I haven't the remotest idea. But, from being
most confidential and friendly, he suddenly became exactly the
reverse, and I tell you I had a very unpleasant time." Larose
stamped his foot angrily. "Bah! I made a mistake somewhere. I
gave myself away. I did something foolish, and it will worry me
all the rest of my life." He smiled whimsically at the old man.
"I am vain, Mr. Gover, you know, very vain in some ways, and it
annoys me most of all that I cannot find out yet the false step
that I must have made. It puzzles me a lot. But, to return to
what I was telling you&mdash;I got taken on as I say, as his
chauffeur, and I found my master very much the type of man you
would judge him to be from his face. He was cold and reserved,
very reserved at first, but quite a good master to work for and
not a man anyone would think capable of a crime.</p>

<p>"He was well liked by his men, very fond himself of his niece,
and the whole atmosphere of the station was just ordinary and
commonplace. No mysteries at all, and nobody seemed to have
anything to hide. There appeared to be no curiosity, either,
about Ferris. He had taken himself off, I was told, two days
before the races at Adelaide, and it was generally supposed that
he had had such a good win over Black Wolf that he was giving
himself a holiday in some other State. No one thought anything
about it, for it was accepted as a matter of course that he was
just that sort of irresponsible and unreliable kind of man.</p>

<p>"Well, for more than a week I only saw this one side of James
Dice's character&mdash;the strong, quiet, reserved man, and then
suddenly the other side was revealed to me. The Meningie
policeman, Abel Black, to whom I had made myself known, fell very
ill with pneumonia and, becoming delirious, he gave the game away
about me. He talked of my being in the township and of our having
met. The doctor who was attending him mentioned about it casually
to the Dice party when I was with them in the car. James Dice was
dreadfully upset, and I saw him go white as a ghost. From that
moment he was a changed man. He believed that I was hot upon his
trail. He began to brood and worry, and in a few days I was the
obsession of his mind. I, Larose the detective I mean&mdash;not
I, Beeton, the chauffeur. He altered all his habits, and all day
long was sweeping the station round with his binoculars to see me
come. He took me, the chauffeur, a lot into his confidence, and
warned me repeatedly to be on the look-out for a prowling man. I
was to shoot on sight and, in his capacity of Chief Magistrate,
he was going to make it all right with the authorities. It was to
pass as an accident, he said." Larose shook his head
thoughtfully. "Yes, I tell you, he was very much afraid then. He
was in deadly fear. I saw the naked savage in the man, and the
wretch who would stop at nothing when the blinding panic gripped
his brain. He was exactly in that condition of mind that he must
have been that night when he dumped you down in the gully
thinking you were dead. He was like a bullock driven mad by fear.
Well, everything was going on swimmingly for me, and I was
expecting every day to pick up the final evidence I was just
waiting for, when&mdash;something happened. Somehow, as I have
told you&mdash;he found me out. His whole manner suddenly
altered, and he absolutely lost all fear. He became quietly and
contemptuously confident again. He was exactly like a man who had
shaken a millstone from his neck.</p>

<p>"He stopped having anything to do with me, and I caught him
glaring at me whenever he thought I wasn't looking. Then he got
vicious and tried to injure me. He put poison in my food and,
finally, he brazenly fired point blank at me with a shot gun. It
was one evening by the creek and I wasn't ten yards away."</p>

<p>"He shot at you?" ejaculated Sam Gover. "He shot at you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, with both barrels, and the wads of both cartridges hit
me, one, too, on the shoulder. It would have been the end of
everything if the cartridges had had any shot in them, but I had
seen to it that they were harmless some days before. There was
only sand and paper behind the wads." The detective sighed
deeply. "Well, after that, I had to leave. It wasn't so much that
I was afraid, but I realised I could do no good by waiting on. So
I cleared out next day, but not quite so soon as Mr. James Dice
thought I did."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Sam Gover sharply.</p>

<p>"He thought I left in the morning," said Larose dryly, "but I
didn't really go until the afternoon. I was hiding up in the
rafters of the garage under an old sail. I waited for him to go
out in the car, and then made a last search in his room. But I
didn't get much out of it, and not the main thing I was looking
for&mdash;the revolver that he used that night on you and Mr.
Barton. I am convinced he's still got it, however, hidden away
somewhere."</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," said the old man testily, "but what absolutely
have you got to identify him with the man who fired at us that
night?"</p>

<p>"Nothing absolute," replied the detective firmly. "I told you
I had no proof that would satisfy a court of law, but there were
scores of little things that, taken altogether, pointed to him
conclusively as the murderer. Listen, for I've not finished yet
by a long way."</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch35"></a>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>

<p class="first">"DURING the time I was with Dice, I was able to
make two searches in his room," Larose told Sam Gover. "One a
very quick and hurried one, but the other a very thorough one.
The first time I examined his clothes, and, tucked away right at
the back of the wardrobe, I found a coat with dark stains all
down the front and on the inside of both sleeves. They looked to
me like those of old blood." Larose shrugged his shoulders. "Of
course they may have not been blood&mdash;they may have been
paint or anything, but"&mdash;he looked peculiarly at Sam
Gover&mdash;"their significance to me became very deadly when I
found an empty envelope in the coat addressed to James Dice and
dated December 22nd." He paused for a moment, and then asked
quietly: "You remember that date, don't you, Mr. Gover? Well,
doesn't that look as if he had worn the coat on the very night
the tragedy occurred?" His voice became hard and emphatic. "But
that isn't all. I saw that coat the first time I searched the
room. Dice had no suspicions of me then, and I was searching
hurriedly when he was having his bath." He lowered his voice
again and rapped out his words slowly and one by one. "The second
time I searched his room the coat was not there. He had got rid
of it as damaging evidence because he had found out who I
was."</p>

<p>"But good God! man," broke in Sam Gover, "why didn't you take
the coat when you had the chance. You could have proved
everything then."</p>

<p>Larose shook his head. "No, no, sir. It was proof to me
because I myself found the envelope there, and it will be proof
to you because you believe me. But it would be no proof to a jury
because I might have found it somewhere else and put it there to
strengthen my case." He took a letter out of his pocket. "Now
look at this, Mr. Gover. I got this from Dice's desk, and it
helps materially to show where the motive comes in. It's from
Dice's cousin, Mr. Thomas French, and I can tell you Mr. French
is recognised everywhere as one of the shrewdest judges of a
horse in the whole Commonwealth. He is one of the shining lights
of the racing world, and perhaps the most prominent member of the
Victorian Jockey Club. Listen to what he says&mdash;it is dated
December 5th last.</p>

<br>

<p class="letter">"My dear Jim, I don't want to dishearten you,
but just you make up your mind straight away that&mdash;however
good your nag may be&mdash;he doesn't stand an earthly if old Eli
decides to run his. Abimeleck could give the Pride a couple of
stone and then beat him easily by twenty lengths. So just you put
that in your pipe, old man, and smoke it for all it is
worth."</p>

<p><br>
Larose stopped reading abruptly. "Now, Mr. Gover," he said,
"what do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"Horrible, horrible," ejaculated Sam Gover brokenly. "My dear
old friend!&mdash;to think he should have been murdered just so
that some wretched horse might win some paltry race." He clenched
his hands together violently. "But the brute shall suffer, the
brute shall hang."</p>

<p>"Listen to the end, Mr. Gover," said the detective. <i>"I've
the strangest part yet to tell. But first, what do you think was
James Dice's financial position a fortnight after he had received
that letter from his cousin French?"</i> Again he paused for a
moment, as if to emphasise the words he was about to
say&mdash;then he spoke very slowly and very solemnly as once
before. <i>"He had less than &pound;20 to his credit in the
bank&mdash;less than &pound;20, Mr. Gover, and yet the week after
Black Wolf had won the Christmas Cup he had &pound;13,000 odd
lying there. Now what do you think of that? What do you think of
that?"</i></p>

<p>The detective leant forward to drive his argument in.
"Believing what an extraordinary horse he had in Black Wolf,
can't you see what was in the fellow's mind, and how, to him, it
was life or death if Abimeleck were absent&mdash;or were allowed
to run in the Christmas Cup?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Gover," he went on, "directly I left the station I set a
trap for the man&mdash;I set a trap for the murderer of Eli
Barton." His voice deepened in its intensity. "A trap that only
the murderer himself could be ensnared in. A trap the place of
which could only possibly be known to two men&mdash;to me, who
set it, and to the murderer of Eli Barton, for whom it was
intended to be sprung."</p>

<p><br>
The detective ceased speaking abruptly, and for the moment, of
the two there, he was now the more emotional.</p>

<p>"I set the trap," he went on after a moment, very slowly, "and
I baited it with the dead body of the jockey, Ferris. James Dice
walked into it, in broad daylight, as I thought he would,
and&mdash;he walked out of it, dragging the body with him,
because we who should have been watching for him&mdash;were
asleep&mdash;just asleep."</p>

<p>"Damn," said Sam Gover explosively: "Then you bungled when at
last you had him in your hands."</p>

<p>Larose smiled very sadly. "Yes," he said quietly, "I
bungled&mdash;I was wanting at the critical moment. The murderer
came, but, I tell you, I was asleep."</p>

<p>"You see, I had not been all those weeks in Dice's company for
nothing, and I knew unerringly where the man's weakness lay. He
could not stand worry and uncertainty. They crumpled him up. I
had seen them sap all his strength of character and make him like
a baby in anyone's hands. So I thought I would prey on his mind
with Sid Ferris. By disguising myself I would resurrect the
ex-jockey before his eyes and so worry and bewilder him that he
would be wondering if the man he had buried were actually come to
life again. He would be always remembering, I knew, how you had
returned from the dead, and in a very little time I was sure he
would be thinking the same of the other man. At any rate, I
thought I could work him up to the pitch of going back to where
he had buried the body to make sure it was still there. I would
lure him again to the scene of his crime. And then I would catch
him, I thought. I would be ready with witnesses by the
thirty-fifth mile post. I would be waiting for him with a hidden
camera. I would snap him directly he started digging at the
grave. We would catch him red-handed and, as far as the murder of
Ferris was concerned, the chain of evidence would be complete.
Then I would lay everything before the authorities, and the
arrest would follow as a matter of hours."</p>

<p>Larose stopped for a minute and lit another cigarette. His
voice had lost all his sadness and he was like a man telling a
good tale.</p>

<p>"Well," he went on presently, "at first everything went well.
I got Abel Black, the policeman, of Meningie, who was
convalescent from his illness, to help me. I told him something
of my plans but never mentioned that the man I wanted was the
Senior Magistrate, James Dice. With the help of the policeman I
got myself up to a very fair resemblance of the dead Sid Ferris."
The detective shuddered whimsically. "I even wore his clothes. He
was a smaller man than I, but, as I was only seen when on
horseback, I managed by hunching myself up to get along without
too much discomfort. At first I only perambulated round Mundulla,
taking care that some of the station hands should see me. I never
let them get too near me, however, and they only saw me in the
distance. I knew it would get to Dice's ears, and it would set
him worrying at once. Then one day I telephoned up as Sid Ferris
and asked for some wages due to me. I asked that the money should
be sent to the post office at Meningie. Finally, I rode openly
through the township, and right past the Meningie hotel when I
knew Dice would be on the veranda there. Then, thinking I had
done enough, and that he would certainly be strung up now to
fever pitch, I hurried with the policeman Black, to the
thirty-fifth mile post on the Coorong, and together we secreted
ourselves there and waited for the wretch's coming. For a day and
a half we kept watch, and then I was taken ill." Larose spoke
very hurriedly here as if anxious to get this part of his story
told. "The weather had suddenly turned cold and I had got some
sort of chill. I had had no sleep for two days. I lay down for a
few minutes' rest and&mdash;I fell asleep and slept for over six
hours. I slept like a dead man." The detective was silent for a
moment; he sighed deeply, and his face was the very picture of
sadness and bitter thought. "When I woke up," he went on
chokingly, "when I woke up, I found Abel Black had been sleeping
too. I rushed over to the grave; the sand was all disturbed, the
body had been dug up and taken away." Larose could hardly speak
now in his emotion, but with an effort he steadied his voice and
went on.</p>

<p>"I could see plainly where it had been dragged along over the
sand. A couple of hundred yards or so away there were the wheel
marks of a big car. The wind had risen and they were being fast
filled in by the blowing sand, but I could recognise them as the
tyres of Dice's car, for there were patches in them that I had
vulcanised myself. It was plain to me what had happened. Dice had
come, as I had thought he would to see if the body were still
there, and, finding it stripped of its clothes (I had taken them
all away), he had instantly suspected something, and to make
himself secure had driven away with the body to hide it somewhere
else."</p>

<p>Larose laughed bitterly. "And that Mr. Gover, almost ends my
tale. The next day I was back in Meningie and, finding that Dice
was in the township, as Beeton the chauffeur I rang up the cook
on the station and incidentally asked her where her master had
been the previous day. She told me he had been away by himself
all day fishing, but he had come back with no fish, although his
boots and leggings were mudded up to right above the knees. I
guessed where he had been. In one of the thousand and one creeks
off the Murray he had got rid of the body and buried it so that
it will never be found again." Larose shrugged his shoulders and
his voice took on a brisk and business-like tone. "That finishes
my report, Mr. Gover," he said. "Dice is, without doubt, the
murderer of Mr. Barton, but, as I say, there is no evidence to
convict him in a court of law. He must go free."</p>

<p>"I don't know so much about that," said Sam Gover very
quietly, after a long pause. He drew in a deep breath. "At any
rate you've convinced me that our friend, Mr. James Dice, is the
guilty party, and I shall make it my duty, I shall make it my
duty, I say"&mdash;he spoke very slowly, and there was a slight
tremor in his voice&mdash;"to see that he meets with his just
reward."</p>

<p>"But you can do nothing, sir," said Larose, shaking his head
sadly. "All the evidence that I had has slipped through by
fingers, and at best there could be only suspicion now. What can
you do?"</p>

<p>"I shall kill him," said the old man emphatically. "I shall
kill him myself."</p>

<p>A frown crossed over the detective's face. "No, Mr. Gover, we
must have none of that. You would hang or at best get
imprisonment for life."</p>

<p>"But I shall kill him," repeated Sam Gover, like a man talking
to himself in a dream. "I shall kill him directly I see him." He
turned savagely on Larose. "What do you think, man? Is that brute
to go free when we know how he served my poor friend?" His voice
became choked with tears. "Poor Eli, poor old Eli&mdash;he never
did a soul in this world any harm. He was as kind and good a man
as ever lived. He was so full of life and so happy even growing
old. He had still so much to live for. Ah!" The old man spat
viciously on the ground. "I'll kill his murderer if I have to
throttle him with my bare hands."</p>

<p>Larose swore softly under his breath. He had made yet another
mistake, he told himself. He had been so full of proving his case
against James Dice that he had not calculated at all what the
effect would be on Eli Barton's old friend. He had totally
forgotten that. He ought not to have disclosed anything until he
had got Sam Gover away from the station. Then there would have
been time for the old man to cool down, and he could have been
brought to reason before he had had time to do anything rash.
Now&mdash;now, things might very easily get into a dreadful mess,
and a lot of tact would be required to keep Sam Gover in
hand.</p>

<hr>

<h2><a id="ch36"></a>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>

<p class="first">SUDDENLY, a sharp metallic noise struck upon
their ears. It sounded like a horse champing his bit, and it came
from close near, behind a small hummock of sand.</p>

<p>They both turned curiously to see what it was, and a moment
later a horseman appeared over the rise. He was a big, tall man,
and he was leisurely walking his mount.</p>

<p>He had a gun slung by a broad strap over his shoulders, and he
was followed closely by a big dog.</p>

<p>"My God," gasped Sam Gover, "it's James Dice!"</p>

<p>"Hullo! Sam," he called out genially, "and what the dickens
are you doing here? Who's your friend?"</p>

<p>"Is your rifle loaded?" Larose whispered hoarsely to Sam
Gover.</p>

<p>"No," groaned the old man, "and the cartridges even are not
undone."</p>

<p>"Then drop it," snapped Larose, "and whatever happens don't
let him suspect anything or he'll shoot without a second's
warning. I know him&mdash;he'll go mad. Let him get close up.
That's our only chance, so that he can't use his gun. Now, pull
yourself together quick or there'll be more murder done. Act,
man," he hissed, "and don't glare at him like that."</p>

<p>"Damn," swore Larose under his breath, "the old fool's going
to ruin everything. I'll&mdash;&mdash;" but the detective stopped
suddenly, and, composing his face to calm, stretched down his
hands, and began playing idly with the sand.</p>

<p>Dice sauntered up quite slowly and then, stopping a little way
away, proceeded to light his pipe.</p>

<p>For the moment Dice was too busy with his pipe to notice the
silence, but, with the pipe alight, he looked up at the old man,
and a rather puzzled expression came at once into his face.</p>

<p>"What's up, Sam?" he remarked. "You look as if you'd got the
blues; but who's your friend, here?" and he glanced for the first
time since dismounting at Larose.</p>

<p>It was quite a casual glance, but he at once frowned slightly,
as if some disagreeable memory had been stirred up in his mind.
He could not, however, see the detective very plainly, for the
latter had got his hat jammed down over his eyes, and his face,
too, was half-averted. He was still playing with the sand.</p>

<p>Dice looked back again to Sam Gover, and immediately then took
his pipe out of his mouth. There could be no failing, now, to
notice the expression on the old man's face.</p>

<p>"You vile beast," he shouted. "You murderer, James
Dice&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was a moment, then, of dreadful silence, with James Dice
standing stiff and motionless, as if all suddenly he had turned
to stone. His jaw had dropped to an expression of horrible
surprise, his face was ashen grey, and he stared incredulously at
Sam Gover for all the world as if the old man were an apparition
from the dead.</p>

<p>For perhaps five seconds nothing happened, and then Larose
rose stealthily to his feet. His action would probably have
passed quite unnoticed but for the interest his movement at once
aroused in Dice's dog.</p>

<p>His manifest interest in Sam Gover's companion drew the
attention of James Dice, and in a subconscious sort of way the
latter, too, turned his eyes upon Larose. At first there was no
obvious inquiry in his gaze, but then something seemed to quicken
in him, and a tense expression crossed his face.</p>

<p>Suddenly Dice gave a gasp of amazement, his eyes widened to
their fullest extent, and in a flash he had whipped the gun off
his shoulder and was pointing it straight at Larose.</p>

<p>"Hands up," he shouted hoarsely, "hands up, Larose. Hands up
or I fire," and his voice vibrated to a lightning note of furious
and triumphant hate.</p>

<p>There was no mistaking the savagery of the command, and
Larose, who in his life had heard the twang of every string upon
the harp of human passion, realised upon the instant that he was
very near to death.</p>

<p>So he lifted up his hands without a second's hesitation, and
with them high above his head stood motionless before James Dice.
His face had taken on a deathly pallor, but it was yet still calm
and stony.</p>

<p>Dice stepped back a pace and, swinging round his gun, had now
both the detective and Sam Gover covered.</p>

<p>"Two barrels, gentlemen," he sneered mockingly, "and this time
neither of the cartridges has been tampered with." His voice
became again savage in his fury. "You won't get off now, like you
did last time, you damned policeman swine, with your sand and
bits of paper. Oh, you fool!&mdash;Just to think I shouldn't spot
you." He laughed contemptuously. "I recognised your neck and ears
the moment I caught sight of you. Beeton, the chauffeur! The fool
who tried to masquerade as Sid Ferris. The wonderful Gilbert
Larose! Oh, you ass."</p>

<p>"But you don't deny then that you killed Eli Barton," called
out Sam Gover in a voice that shook with rage. "You can't deny
it, for we know everything about you."</p>

<p>"Oh," sneered James Dice, "the great Gilbert Larose again, of
course?"</p>

<p>"You murdered your man, Ferris, too," went on the old man.
"That was the second murder that you did that night."</p>

<p>Dice gave a violent start, and the gun he was pointing wobbled
unsteadily, from side to side. His face grew grey again, and an
expression of terror came into his eyes. He looked searchingly at
Larose.</p>

<p>"Everything has come out," continued Sam Gover recklessly,
"through you murdering Ferris. We've found out everything through
that."</p>

<p>Dice glared in deadly hatred at Larose. "You little beast," he
hissed. "So you've been sneaking round me again, have you?" His
voice hardened in its savagery.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Larose, now Gilbert Larose, get ready; say your
prayers. I'm going to count sixty and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He closed his words with a snap, and for a moment there was
silence&mdash;then, "One&mdash;two&mdash;three," he began....</p>

<p><br>
Larose was standing motionless with his hands still high above
his head. His eyes had narrowed to two little slits, and his
forehead was picked out in beads of sweat.</p>

<p>He believed he was close to death, but promised as he was only
a few seconds more to live, the expression on his face was still
not one of fear, nor indeed, despair. Instead, he looked watchful
and alert, as if he had not yet even lost hold of the game.</p>

<p>"Thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven," went on James Dice,
"thirty-eight, thirty-nine," and then&mdash;something
happened.</p>

<p>A seagull alighted on the sands less than ten yards distant
from where they stood.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was that the gull was curious because they were all
so still, or perhaps the bird was hungry and believed there might
be scraps of food about.</p>

<p>At any rate, it swooped down boldly to the ground.</p>

<p>Larose saw it just out of the tail of his eyes, but Schafer,
the dog, instantly had both eyes fully turned upon it.</p>

<p>The animal rose promptly to his feet and growled.</p>

<p>The seagull was not frightened for, with its bird-instinct, it
knew that distance made it safe, but the effect of the growl on
James Dice was very different. He had not seen the bird at all,
for it had alighted on the sand behind him, and, not knowing
therefore what had disturbed the dog, he was seized instantly
with alarm. He knew the dog would not growl for nothing, and he
began at once to conjecture wildly what it was.</p>

<p>Still keeping his eyes upon the detective, and the gun pointed
directly towards the latter's breast, he edged back sideways for
a couple of yards, and then, for one fleeting second, half-turned
his head. It was only for the very briefest moment that he looked
away, but it was sufficient for Larose.</p>

<p>The detective's arms shot forward in a lightning stroke, his
fingers opened and spread out, and two handfuls of sand struck
James Dice straight in the face.</p>

<p>There was a fierce oath, a splutter of rage, and, releasing
one hand from his gun, Dice strove wildly to clear his eyes.</p>

<p>But the sand had hit him squarely, and for the moment he was
blinded. He heard the gasp of a sharp intake of breath; a snarl,
as from some savage animal, and he was seized violently by the
throat. His legs were knocked viciously from under him, and as he
fell backwards some one pulled hard to wrench away his gun. But he
was strong and muscular, and, his surprise over, he not only
retained the gun but with his free arm gripped his adversary as
he fell and brought him stumbling to the ground.</p>

<p>A breathless struggle followed, lasting perhaps for five
seconds, and then&mdash;a deafening report burst up upon the
air.</p>

<p>There was a yelp from the dog, a long-drawn sigh from the
master of Mundulla, as if he were very tired, and then&mdash;a
death-like silence fell upon the place.</p>

<p>The seagull had flown away.....</p>

<p>"It was an accident," wailed old Gover, almost in tears, when
a minute or two later he and the detective were capable of
coherent conversation again. "It was an act of God, Larose."</p>

<p>"Yes, an act of God," sighed the detective wearily. "Still, it
was well my finger found the trigger when it did."</p>

<p>He got up shakily from the sand, and stood over the prostrate
figure of what had at one time been the proud master of Mundulla.
The latter had died instantaneously, for the greater part of his
face had been blown away.</p>

<p>"Bah!" muttered the detective bitterly, "his death was much
too merciful. He ought to have been hanged." He turned to Sam
Gover. "Look here," he said sharply, "it's we who are in the soup
now." He pointed to the body. "What are we going to do about
that?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I suppose everything will have to come out now," replied
the old man weakly. "At any rate, I can be witness as to how he
died."</p>

<p>Larose spoke roughly. "Aren't young Barton and the girl
sweethearts?" he asked.</p>

<p>Sam Gover sat up with a jerk. "My God!" he exclaimed brokenly,
"I never thought of that, and she's a real good girl, too."</p>

<p>"Pull yourself together," said Larose sharply, "and everything
will be all right yet. The man's death shall be made appear as
the result of an accident. It shall look as if his gun had gone
off and killed him as he was unfastening the gate. Take off your
coat, now, and roll up your sleeves." He took out his watch.
"Quick, we must be quick. We have no time to lose. The mailman
passes here every day, just after four, and it's half-past three
already. He shall be the one to discover the body, and we needn't
be mixed up in it at all. Steady now, and be sure and don't get
any blood on your clothes."</p>

<p>Things happened very much as Larose had arranged, and the
unfortunate accident to the master of Mundulla aroused great
interest in the district, and was the occasion of much sympathy
for all the friends and relatives concerned. It was a dreadful
shock, people said, particularly to Mr. Samuel Gover, who was on
a visit to the station, and for over a week the old man was
obliged to keep to his bed. Fortunately, however, for the
household at Mundulla, the chauffeur, Beeton, had returned to his
duties, and in the versatility of his accomplishments he had at
once taken over the role of nurse and attendant to the sick
man.</p>

<p>Three months later all interest in the affair had died down,
and the pretty Margaret Bevan was married very quietly, in
Adelaide to young Stanley Barton.</p>

<p><br>
Winter had passed and spring had come again. It was a Saturday
afternoon, and the race for the great Viceroy Cup was being run
at Flemington.</p>

<p>The mighty horse, Abimeleck, was the popular favourite, and it
was generally conceded that none of the 23 other runners held an
outstanding chance. The distance was two miles, and Abimeleck was
carrying 9.12.</p>

<p>Amongst the others running was an ex-Adelaide horse&mdash;one
Black Wolf. He had recently been bought out of South Australia by
a Victorian sportsman. He had been allotted 7.7.</p>

<p>The start was an excellent one, and the field got off together
in almost a straight line.</p>

<p>At the six furlong post the far-striding Abimeleck took
command. Five furlongs from home and he was leading by three
lengths. Suddenly a black horse was seen to dart out from the
ruck behind.</p>

<p>Black Wolf was actually passing the favourite!</p>

<p>At the three-furlong post he was a length ahead; a furlong
farther and he was two lengths to the good, with Abimeleck now
being hard ridden under the whip. A hundred yards from home and
the advantage was still greater, and finally the Adelaidian ran
past the judge's box the easiest of winners by about five
lengths.</p>

<p>"Oh! Fate, Fate," muttered a man among the crowd, "and why did
you so uselessly throw away three lives?"</p>

<p>"You mocked at James Dice and maddened him that he played
foul, when all along you knew that it was he who held the trump
card. Oh, if he had only known it, too!"</p>

<p>He moved off among the crowd.</p>

<p>It was Gilbert Larose.</p>
