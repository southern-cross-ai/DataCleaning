<h4>Published in The Mail, Adelaide, S.A., Saturday 17 March, 1945.</h4>
<hr>
<p>For many years Reuben Leyden had been one of the best-known diamond dealers
in Hatton Garden and it was said that, almost fabulous sums of money had at
times, in the course of a few minutes, changed hands in his modest suite of
rooms. Of a shrewd and intellectual countenance, he was a rather frail-looking
small man of slight physique. He had a peculiar melodious voice, with just the
trace of Dutch accent in his speech. His office staff consisted of three girl
clerks and a burly pugilistic attendant. This latter was always well within
call.</p>
<p>One morning two new clients called at Leyden's place of business. Both men
were about middle age.</p>
<p>One was tall and aristocratic looking, smartly, and even foppishly dressed,
and sporting a large monocle. The other, of much heavier build, was
well-dressed, too, his right arm, however, with the hand swathed in a thick
bandage, was carried in a sling.</p>
<p>"I want to see Mr. Leyden," drawled the tall man to the pugilistic attendant
who had come forward. "I'm Sir Francis Bessington," and he handed over his
visiting card. The attendant looked questioningly at the second man. "Major von
Swartz," snapped the latter in gutteral tones. "We are friends."</p>
<p>The card was taken into the inner office, and, a few seconds later, the two
visitors were ushered into Reuben Leyden, who was seated behind a big table
desk. The attendant followed them, and, after pushing to the door, but not
closing it, seated himself down at a small desk in a corner of the room, and
began busying himself with some papers. He had an automatic pistol in his
pocket. Leyden never took any chances with strangers.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the dealer's good morning with a curt nod, Sir Francis
produced a fair-sized diamond from some cotton-wool in a small box and handed
it across the desk.</p>
<p>"I want to know what you'll match this stone for," he said.</p>
<p>Leyden motioned them both to chairs, and proceeded to examine the diamond
under a powerful magnifying glass. "It is a goot stone," he remarked presently,
"quite a goot stone."</p>
<p>"Of course it is," snapped the men with the bandaged hand, "and I know
something about diamonds, as I lived in Johannesburg for a couple of years." He
added rudely, "I've come here with my friend to make sure he pays no
extortionate price."</p>
<p>Leyden smiled. "No one pays me an extortionate price," he said gently. "I'm
quite a fair dealer," and pulling a glass case containing some fine scales
before him, he proceeded to weigh the diamond carefully. "Yes, I can match it,"
he said, and rising from his chair, he passed out of sight into a small inner
room leading out of his office.</p>
<p>Returning very quickly with a small cardboard box in his hand, from some
tissue paper he spilled about a dozen glittering stones on to a small square of
black velvet, which he had taken from a drawer in the desk. After some
consideration, he picked out one and placed it side by side with the one Sir
Francis had brought with him. "It will cost you &pound;110," he said. "As I
told you, yours is a goot stone, but mine is even a little better."</p>
<p>"Too much," snapped the German. "You must take off &pound;20." He turned to
Sir Francis and spoke rapidly in his own tongue. "The price is quite
reasonable, but we must beat him down. I'll do all the arguing because you are
always such a fool in making a bargain."</p>
<p>"Ja, ja," nodded Sir Francis.</p>
<p>He could not have continued the conversation further in German as 'Ja' and
'Nein' were the only words he knew.</p>
<p>Von Swartz turned back to the dealer. "Yes, we offer you &pound;90."</p>
<p>The dealer shook his head. "But I cannot sell at that price. You are getting
goot value at &pound;110, the best of values."</p>
<p>"Let's have your magnifying glass," said the German. "It's a bit awkward for
me with this poisoned hand." He examined the stone carefully, and then asked,
"Been all your life in diamonds, I suppose?"</p>
<p>"All my life," nodded the dealer. "And my family, for four generations, have
been all cutters or dealers." He spoke proudly. "It was my father who cut the
great Cullinan diamond for His Majesty King Edward VII. He was more than two
years on the work."</p>
<p>Von Swartz looked more amiable, and finally it was agreed to pay the sum
asked.</p>
<p>The two then took their leave, with the intimation that they might be
returning in a day or two for some more stones, as Sr Francis was intending to
make up a necklace. The attendant was asked to call a taxi, and given half a
crown as a tip.</p>
<p>Driving away, the German, speaking now in much less gutteral tones, asked
rather anxiously. "Well, do you think you can do it, Matt?"</p>
<p>"Sure, after a little practice at home," grinned the other, and he added in
a good imitation of the dealer's voice, "It is a goot stone, and I cannot sell
for less." He laughed. "But do you think he understood what you said in
German?"</p>
<p>"Of course he did," replied von Swartz. "I tell you I know for certain he
lived for some time in Stuttgart and that his wife's a German."</p>
<p>He nodded. "What I said then would convince him we were just ordinary
buyers."</p>
<p>The following day the two returned again, and with the attendant a witness
of the transaction, bought another diamond, this time paying &pound;130 for a
slightly bigger one.</p>
<p>They seemed much more friendly now, and as if they no longer thought they
were going to be cheated. "And some time within the next month or so," drawled
the man who was passing himself off as Sir Francis Bessington, "I may be
bringing you the necklace for which I am wanting these new stones." He sighed
heavily. "The ladies are deuced expensive, particularly the extra pretty
ones."</p>
<p>Out in the street again, the man who had called himself von Swartz said
confidently, "Now, next time I shall be very surprised if the old devil keeps
that ugly brute of an attendant in the room. Jews are naturally secretive, and
he won't like the man seeing too much of what business he is doing and guessing
at the big profits he must be making."</p>
<p>He shook his head vexatiously. "Still, until he is cleared out we can't do a
thing."</p>
<p>Two days later they were back in the dealer's office, and they cursed deeply
when the attendant prepared to take up his accustomed seat. However, Leyden
made a slight adjustment to the position of the ink well upon his desk, and,
that being an arranged signal, to the great relief of the two visitors, the man
at once proceeded to leave the room. Still, he only pulled the door to and did
not quite close it.</p>
<p>Very soon quite a good assortment of diamonds were spread out upon the
dealer's little square of black velvet, and he was pointing out their beauty
and value. The German had moved up closer to the desk table to get a better
view.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, von Swartz's injured hand slipped from its bandage and,
quick as the strike of a snake, had shot out over the desk and gripped the
dealer fiercely by the throat. The latter had not had the very fraction of a
second's warning, and he uttered no cry and made no sound as the German threw
himself over the desk and lifted him bodily out of his chair. The strange
thing, however, was that it seemed the dealer was still talking, and even in
slightly louder tones than before.</p>
<p>"But they are goot stones," came his melodious voice, "and the best that
money can buy."</p>
<p>With the Jew black in the face, and now quite unconscious, von Swartz laid
him noiselessly upon the floor and, slipping on a pair of gloves, darted into
the little inner room where the precious stones were always kept.</p>
<p>"But you must really knock off &pound;100, Mr. Leyden," came the slow,
drawling voice of Sir Francis, "and then we'll call it a deal." And the voice
of the dealer answered back that he could not possibly reduce his price.</p>
<p>Then for some minutes an imaginary conversation was carried on, with the
rumble of the voices clearly audible in the adjoining room.</p>
<p>The dual speaker had nerves of steel, and his voice never trembled, but for
all that, his face had blanched a horrid sickly colour, and his forehead was
pricked out in little beads of sweat. Success or failure was now balanced on
the razor's edge, and everything depended upon what happened in the next few
minutes.</p>
<p>There&mdash;uncovered for all to see&mdash;was the dreadful face of the
throttled dealer, while a bare 10 yards away, and with an unclosed door between
sat the all unconscious office staff.</p>
<p>Another caller arriving to see the dealer, a message for him on the phone,
and dammit! It would mean death on the scaffold for them both! That fool, Bert,
had such a heavy hand, and it was any odds the Jew was dead!</p>
<p>The German reappeared at last, patting his pockets significantly, and his
voice was now heard in the brief conversation which ensued.</p>
<p>It seemed a bargain was quickly struck and the money passed over. Leyden was
heard bidding his customers good-bye, and von Swartz came smilingly into the
outer office. Sir Francis, however, lingered for half a minute or so at the
open door of the dealer's room, laughingly chiding Leyden for having extorted
so much good money for a few paltry stones.</p>
<p>Then came the critical moment as Sir Francis pulled to Leyden's door, and
the two companions prepared to leave the building. As once before, the
attendant was asked to call a taxi, and it happened a disengaged one was found
close by. Another half-crown tip was passed over, and the attendant stood on
the pavement watching them drive away.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour passed, and then one of the girls went in to her
employer to inquire if she could now go out for her lunch. What she saw when
she entered the room, however, quite took away all desire for food.</p>
<p>* * * *</p>
<p>One morning some three weeks later the Chief Commissioner of Police was
talking to one of the head detective-inspectors of Scotland Yard.</p>
<p>The latter seemed in a very despondent mood. "And as far as I can see, sir,"
he said, "there seems little hope now of picking up any clue. Beyond that the
murderers must have been in close touch with Sir Francis Bessington, as
evidenced by their making use of one of his stolen visiting cards the very
morning after he had left Southampton for the United States we have found out
practically nothing. We have uncovered no trace of any foreigner he knew whose
description would answer to that of the supposed Major von Swartz, and the
identity of the other killer is equally as unknown. Yes, we are completely at a
dead end."</p>
<p>"It's unfortunate," sighed the Commissioner, "as the newspapers are so very
vicious and clamouring for our blood."</p>
<p>Now it happened that at that very moment when this disconsolate conversion
was taking place at Scotland Yard two men had just arrived at Euston to catch
the Scotch express. They had booked for Glasgow and looked just ordinary men,
tourists it might have been, off upon a holiday. One was tall and slim, and the
other of much stouter build.</p>
<p>Just from force of habit, perhaps, they glanced round quickly, as they
entered a first-class carriage.</p>
<p>No one appeared to be interested in them, and no one, apparently, gave them
a second thought.</p>
<p>Taking two corner seats opposite each other by the window, it seemed they
were going to have the compartment to themselves, but a minute or two before
the train started an elderly and rather distinguished-looking old gentleman
with white hair entered hurriedly and took possession of a corner seat on the
corridor side.</p>
<p>He was followed immediately by another man, obviously his servant and
probably his butler, in ordinary clothes. This latter placed a small suitcase
upon the rack, handed his master a small handbag and a rug, and mouthed rather
than asked if he could do anything more.</p>
<p>The old gentleman shook his head and, taking a magazine out of his bag, at
once proceeded to read. Whereupon his servant turned to the other two occupants
of the carriage and said most respectfully:</p>
<p>"My master is stone deaf, gentlemen, and could not hear if a gun were fired
off right under his ear. So, if anyone comes to see his ticket will you very
kindly explain to the collector that he must nudge him to attract his
attention."</p>
<p>The two men said smilingly that they would.</p>
<p>The train started upon its long journey without anyone else coming into the
carriage and the two companions, evidently in high spirits and thinking it a
good joke, began to chip the deaf old gentleman.</p>
<p>They called him 'Old Snoozer,' and asked him where he'd left his best girl.
Then they addressed him by names which were by no means polite, suggesting that
his parentage, at any rate upon his mother's side, was a matter he would no
doubt like to forget. They remarked, too, that he looked 'a hardened old
whats-er-name,' and shook with merriment at their own wit.</p>
<p>Getting tired of their play at last, they left him alone and talked between
themselves.</p>
<p>The old gentleman read on for some time, and then, probably for a change of
occupation, put down his magazine and, taking a pad out of his bag, proceeded
to write.</p>
<p>The whole time he never once lifted his eyes or took the very slightest
notice of the two men. At Crewe the inspector came to examine the tickets, and
it seemed that the old gentleman was not only deaf, but also very stupid, as
for a long time he could not remember where he had put his ticket.</p>
<p>At last, however the inspector found it for him among the muddled-up papers
in his bag. The old gentleman then handed over a tip with a pleasant word of
thanks.</p>
<p>Later on more passengers entered the compartment, but nothing out of the
ordinary happened until Carlisle was reached, and then, before even the train
had been brought to a standstill, a police inspector had swung himself on board
and, followed by three men in plainclothes, had hurried along the corridor
straight to the compartment containing the old gentleman.</p>
<p>Taking no notice of him, however, he pushed his way in straight up to the
two men who had also come on the train at Euston. "I want a word with you two
gentlemen," he said sharply, "so will you please come to the stationmaster's
office with me at once."</p>
<p>The men gasped in consternation, and then the right hand of the shorter of
them darted back to his hip-pocket, but the inspector threw himself upon him
and jerked out the hand again which was now seen to be clutching to an
automatic. A fierce but brief struggle ensued before the man was secured and
carried out.</p>
<p>His companion, as white as death, gave no trouble, and was taken out, too.
It was all over very quickly, and, in a few minutes the journey northwards was
resumed in the usual way.</p>
<p>The evening of the following day the Chief Commissioner of Police left
Scotland Yard in an obviously most cheerful frame of mind.</p>
<p>"Yes, my dear," he said to his wife after dinner, "of course it was a most
wonderful piece of luck."</p>
<p>"Though all the credit of their arrests will come to us, every bit of it
belongs to old Lord Barnstable."</p>
<p>"But what on earth had it to do with him?" asked his wife.</p>
<p>"Everything," laughed the Commissioner, "for it was he who landed them high
and dry into our net. It was like this:</p>
<p>"It appears that when upon a train journey the old boy has a perfect horror
of being drawn into boring conversations with other travellers, and so, when
his man had fixed him up in a seat he has orders to tell anyone else in the
carriage that his master is stone deaf, and will they very kindly explain that
to any ticket collector who comes round."</p>
<p>"This happened yesterday, when his lordship took his seat in the Scotch
Express. His man told the tale to two men, the only other passengers in the
carriage. Then when the train had started upon its journey, these men, as a
vulgar sort of joke, began abusing his lordship and calling him all sorts of
unpleasant names, quite sure, of course, that he wouldn't hear a word.</p>
<p>"Presently, the joke beginning to wear a bit thin, they took to discussing
their own affairs, and his lordship pricked up his ears when they began talking
about the Hatton Garden murder. In a few minutes he was quite certain the crime
had been their work, and that they were then actually carrying the diamonds on
them. They even mentioned the name of the fence in Glasgow they were taking
them to."</p>
<p>"But how could they have been so stupid!" exclaimed his wife.</p>
<p>The Commissioner laughed. "We learnt later they had shared a large bottle of
champagne at the refreshment buffet at Euston before getting on the train, and
it was that, no doubt, which was making them so lively. At any rate, to go on
with the story, his lordship stopped reading and started writing letters. He
wrote three as a blind.</p>
<p>"Then when the ticket inspectors came round at the Crewe, His Lordship
pretended to be very muddled and unable to find his ticket, and it ended in the
inspector helping him to go through the bag.</p>
<p>"There&mdash;right on the top of some papers&mdash;the man saw an envelope
addressed to the stationmaster at Crewe and marked in big letters,
'Urgent&mdash;very urgent. Deliver instantly.'</p>
<p>"Fortunately, in bending over the bag, the inspector had had his back turned
to the two men at the other end of the carriage, and in consequence they did
not see him pick up the envelope. Within five minutes the stationmaster was
phoning us at the Yard. Lord Barnstable's word was good enough for us, and we
got ready to arrest the men at Carlisle."</p>
<p>He chuckled. "And now, as His Lordship refuses to allow the part he played
to become known, as I say, we shall get all the credit, and the public may
never learn how we were helped."</p>
<p>"But who were the men?" asked his wife.</p>
<p>"One was a fourth-rate provincial actor, and the other whom we believe to
have been the actual killer because of his strength, was the cloakroom
attendant at the Ormonde, Sir Francis Bessington's favourite club."</p>
<p>The Commissioner frowned. "Ah, but for one little false step at that club we
should have been right on the bullseye, and perhaps have uncovered the wretches
ourselves.</p>
<p>"Our mistake there was that we looked for a German who would have known Sir
Francis was going to America, instead of trying to find a man who SPOKE German.
This cloakroom fellow had been a prisoner in Germany for nearly four years
during the last war, and spoke the language almost like a native."</p>
<p>His face cleared. "Never mind, all's well that ends well, and I may even get
a knighthood out of this, with any luck."</p>
