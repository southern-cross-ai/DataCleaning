<h2>The Martyr on the Land<br>
by<br>
Arthur Gask</h2>
<hr>
<h4>Published in The Advertiser, Adelaide, S.A., Monday 4 February, 1935.</h4>
<hr>
<p>In this arresting article, a former city dweller, who once cherished the
comfortable belief that farming is a charming and profitable occupation, tells
how he has learned the truth, and what bitter reflections it has engendered in
his mind.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<p>BEFORE me, upon my desk, lies a purchase-docket from one of the largest
firms of cream-buyers in South Australia. It is dated December 18 last, and
reads:&mdash;"Weight of cream, 25 lb.; cheque enclosed, 7/7." And this docket
is symptomatic of the whole life story of the farmer of today.</p>
<p>Up to a year ago, living always in the cities, I regarded the plight of the
farmer as being wholly due to his want of foresight and lack of business
ability. Fair weather or foul, said I, he was always complaining; and, if he
were now impoverished and in financial straits, it was because, among all
classes of the community, he, least of all, had accommodated himself to the
changed conditions of the times. He should count his blessings, I thought. He
lived a free and glorious life in the open air; he was spared the strain and
nervous tension of the city; he had the best of things to eat at his very door;
and if, in the pursuit of his calling, he did occasionally meet with adverse
conditions, then the good seasons must make up for the bad, and he must be
thankful that he was in any employment at all!</p>
<p>That was a year ago. Since then, having lived with farmers, and with farmers
only, I have changed my mind; and, indeed, have come to marvel at the man upon
the land as a very patient, and, in the main, ungrumbling individual struggling
manfully beneath a burden that it seems quite hopeless he will ever be able to
bear.</p>
<p>At no time is there an occupation that offers more uncertain reward than the
farmer's; and now the margin between profit and loss is so very small that his
days are one continual round of harassing anxiety, with but the remotest chance
of things coming out on the right side of the ledger at the end of the
year.</p>
<p>The dweller in the city does not realise that from seed time unto harvest
the farmer never knows from day to day what calamity may befall him, being
never sure that in one short hour, almost, he will not lose the fruit of a
whole year's labor.</p>
<p>Sun, wind, and rain out of due season mean only a passing inconvenience to
those in the city; but to the farmer they may, and very often do, spell
absolute disaster.</p>
<p>Take that Black Monday of last month, for instance&mdash;December 17, the
day of the most terrible dust storm within living memory. Adelaide folk,
absorbing their iced drinks, could not know that in many districts it was being
fatal to thousands of acres of unreaped oats, shaking out all the grain and
leaving nothing but the empty stalks.</p>
<h2>SEED TIME AND HARVEST</h2>
<p>"While the earth remaineth, seed time and harvest shall not cease," says
Holy Writ; but that surely does not apply to the farmer in Australia.
Seed-time, if you like. Seed-time with all the long days of heavy and patient
toil that precede it: the ploughing, the harrowing, the cultivating and the
cultivating again, but the harvest&mdash;ah, that is quite a different matter.
The farmer is never certain, until the grain is actually in his barn, that
there is going to be any harvest at all.</p>
<p>On that morning of December 17, a farmer near me was reaping a small crop of
seven acres of oats that he sows every year as feed for his horses. His normal
harvest from this little patch is 70 bags. The first time he went round with
the harvester, he got two bags; then up came the wind, and he had to go round
ten times to obtain the next two bags. In all, that day he harvested 10 bags of
oats instead of the usual 70.</p>
<p>And that happening is just a very ordinary instance of the uncertainty of
the farmer's life, for he is always at the mercy of the caprices of the
elements. Drought, frost, hail, tempest, and the blast of the hot north wind,
are for ever threatening him; and it is just a gamble that at least one of them
does not injure him in some way or other during the course of each year.</p>
<p>After a good rain he may hopefully sow his seed. A light rain may then
follow, and after that a drying wind may sweep down and bake the surface of the
ground so hard that the sprouting grain will not be able to push its way
through, so that the whole sowing will have to be done all over again. Or a dry
spell may follow upon the seeding, and the seed malt and become useless.</p>
<p>Once more, the crop may come up and show all the promise of a good harvest.
Then, just as it is maturing, a hard frost may ensue and kill the flower, and
the whole crop be lost. Or, when the grain is in the head, a hailstorm may come
and break all the heads off. Then, in sandy soils, a succession of hot winds
may destroy everything, or, in heavier soils, so pinch the grains that they
will become light and totally useless for making into flour.</p>
<h2>LIFE OF HAZARDS</h2>
<p>Yet again, if the reaping of the ripened crop be retarded by days of
continuous rain&mdash;as, indeed, has happened in many districts this
year&mdash;the grain will become bleached, and, with the gluten washed out, of
much poorer quality. Sometimes, even a total loss may follow by the grain
starting to grow in the heads. Also, the winds may so flatten down the stalks
that up to 50 per cent. of the crop may not be able to be gathered in the
harvester. Much of the grain, too, may then have been shaken out, and, as we
have seen in the case of oats, the whole of the crop may thus be lost.</p>
<p>Despite all this, I have by no means exhausted the hazards of a farmer's
calling or the misfortunes that are continually befalling him. This year, in
particular, has been a most unhappy one. Owing to the drought, there was no
green feed for stock right up to the end of the winter; and, although a farmer
might hand-feed his sheep with the wheat that he could so ill spare, many of
the ewes became so weak that when they dropped their lambs they had no milk for
them, and, in consequence, morning after morning, the paddocks were strewn with
the bodies of the dead. Then, after the drought, came the plague of
grasshoppers; and, in those districts where they arrived too late to ruin all
the crops, they stripped bare the precious lucern and played havoc with the
other kinds of feed, so that today in many places the farmers have already had
to draw upon their winter stores of hay.</p>
<h2>WHAT DOES HE GET?</h2>
<p>And even when all things are propitious from a seasonal point of view, what
does the ordinary so-called mixed farmer get out of everything? Seven shillings
and seven pence for 25 lb. of cream; 6d. a pound for butter; anything up to 5d.
or 6d. a dozen for his eggs; and perhaps 2/ for a good fat fowl. He may feed a
pig twice and even three times a day for six or seven months, and maybe think
himself lucky if he collects 50/, or even only a couple of pounds. He will sell
a calf as big as a Newfoundland dog, and perhaps get only 27/6 or 30/; and for
a prime fat young sheep he may get anything from 15/ up to &pound;1. As for his
wheat, well, all the world knows what he gets for that; but how many people
realise what its low price means to the man who produces it?</p>
<p>It is upon the wheat crop that the farmer depends mainly for his livelihood,
and he labors all the year round to obtain it. Suppose he farms, as we do, in
the lower north, and wheat is quoted at 2/6 a bushel, delivered at Port
Adelaide. That means 7/6 for a bag of three bushels, or, deducting 7&frac12;d.
for the one-twelfth he has used as seed, he will be receiving only
6/10&frac12;. it has cost him from 8d. to 9d. to buy each wheat bag, and,
roughly, he has spent another 6d. upon the super he has had to use to obtain
the three bushels. That brings the 6/10&frac12; down to 5/7&frac12;. Deduct,
then, another 4d. for the upkeep of his horses or his tractor, and it leaves
him with 5/3&frac12;. After he has had the expense of carting the bag of wheat
to the Burra railway station, he has to pay one shilling more for the freight
charge to Port Adelaide, so, in the end, making no allowance for the ageing of
his horses or the depreciation on his tractor or the repairs and replacements
to his implements, he nets 4/3&frac12; upon each bag, and, assuming that he
averages six bags to the acre, which is a good average for good land up here,
he receives the magnificent sum of 25/9 upon each acre.</p>
<h2>THE WITHERED ARM</h2>
<p>If he has harvested 200 acres under the best of possible conditions, and has
escaped all the disasters I have enumerated, the money he will receive for his
entire crop will be only &pound;257 10/, or, if the price of wheat keeps up to
2/9 a bushel, just over &pound;300. Consider, too, that to reap 200 acres of
wheat each year upon a mixed farm, the acreage of the farm must be at least 500
acres. Then think, quite apart from the &pound;600 to &pound;700 that he has
expended upon his plant and implements, what he must have paid for 500 acres of
good farming land. Almost certainly, at least &pound;6,000; and, if that be so,
it is more than probable that there is a mortgage running of &pound;4,000, with
&pound;200 to pay each year in interest.</p>
<p>Then how can it be expected, at current prices, that he will ever be able to
live and pay his way? Moreover, upon all sides he sees shrinking markets and a
glutted world; a world that does not want his produce, and, indeed, could not
pay for it if it did. Can it be that, instead of being the backbone of the
Commonwealth, the farmer has become now its withered arm, needing constant and
expensive treatment from the Treasury to support him upon the sick list? In any
case, he is the victim of circumstances over which no one, and he least of all,
has had any control; and it is not his fault if he stands today, a pathetic
figure, silhouetted against the dusk of the one-time prosperity of the
world&mdash;the martyr on the land.</p>
