<h2 style="page-break-before: always"><a id="pref" name="pref">PREFACE</a></h2>
<p class="first">THIS fifth volume deals with one of the most tremendous
episodes in history, when the vigour of the German attack and the desperate
resistance of the British both on the Somme and in Flanders, held an awestruck
world in suspense. A million men released from the Russian front, rolled across
Europe and, swelling that great tide which was already banked up before the
British breakwater, it washed over all the front line barriers and threatened
at one time to sweep down to the sea. The account of how the British Army, upon
which incomparably the greater pressure fell, rose to the occasion and first
slowed and then held the terrific flood is one of the most wonderful of
military epics. At the same time every credit must be given to the loyalty of
the French commanders who, while guarding their own extended lines, endeavoured
to spare all possible help to their hard-pressed Allies. This volume carries
the story of the German attack to its close. The next and final one will
describe the enormous counter-attack of the Allies leading up to their final
victory.</p>
<p>The Chronicler has been faced by many obstacles in endeavouring to preserve
both accuracy and historical proportion while writing contemporary history. He
would gratefully acknowledge that his critics in the press have shown a kindly
indulgence, which arises, no doubt, from an appreciation of these difficulties.
There has, however, been one conspicuous exception to which he would desire to
call attention, since a large question of literary etiquette is involved. From
the beginning a series of unflattering and anonymous articles have appeared in
<i>The Times Literary Supplement</i>, commenting adversely upon each volume in
turn, and picking out the pettiest details for animadversion. Upon enquiry,
these articles&mdash;in whole or part&mdash;are admitted to have been written
by the Hon. J.W. Fortescue, who is himself the official historian of the War.
On being remonstrated with, this gentleman could not be brought to see that it
is not fitting that he should make anonymous attacks, however <i>bona fide</i>,
upon a brother author who is working upon the same subject and is therefore in
the involuntary position of being a humble rival.</p>
<p>Having stated the facts they may be left to the judgment of the public.</p>

<h2><a id="chap1" name="chap1">I.<br>
EVENTS UPON THE BRITISH FRONT</a><br>
UP TO MARCH 21, 1918</h2>
<p class="chaphead">The prospects of the Allies&mdash;Great dangers from the
Russian collapse&mdash;State of the British line&mdash;Huge German
preparations&mdash;Eve of the Great Offensive</p>
<p class="first">THE New Year of 1918, the fourth of the world war, opened with
chequered prospects for the Allies. Upon all subsidiary fields of action the
developments were good. In Palestine, General Allenby, the victor of Arras, had
shown himself to be a fine soldier upon the larger scale, and. had fought his
way up the old highway of history which leads from Egypt by Gaza to Jerusalem.
Homely crusaders in tattered khaki stood where once Godfrey de Bouillon and his
chivalry had worshipped before the shrine of religion, and the cavalry of
Australia, the yeomen of the Shires, and the infantry of London won once more
the ground which Richard of the Lion Heart with his knights and bowmen had
contested in the long ago. Surely in all the strange permutations and
combinations of the world war there could be none more striking than that! By
April the British force covered all the northern approaches to the city and
extended its right wing to the Jordan, where our Arab allies in the land of
Moab were pushing the Turks back along the line of the Damascus railway.</p>
<p>On another road of world conquest, that from Bagdad to Nineveh, the British
and Indian columns were also both active and victorious. The knightly Maude had
perished from cholera contracted by his own courtesy in drinking a proffered
cup of village water. His successor, General Marshall, formerly his Chief of
Staff, and as such conversant with his aims and his methods, carried on both
one and the other, moving his men north until the spectator who compared their
numbers with the immensity of the spaces around them, was appalled at the
apparent loneliness of their position. By May his raiding cavalry were not far
from the Turkish supply depot of Mosul, where the barren mounds, extending over
leagues of desert, proclaim both the greatness and the ruin of Nineveh.
Salonica continued in its usual condition of uneasy and malarial somnolence,
but gratifying reports came of the belated rally of the Greeks, who, acting
with the French, won a smart little victory against their Bulgarian enemies
upon May 31. German East Africa had at last been cleared of German forces, but
General Lettow-Vorbeck, to whom we cannot deny remarkable fortitude and
leadership, wandered with his piebald commands in the depths of the forests and
marshes of Mozambique, still evading his inevitable capture, and master only of
the ground on which he camped.</p>
<p>But these distant campaigns had only a remote and indirect effect upon the
war in Europe. Here the late winter and the early spring of 1918 saw the
balance tilted against the British and their comrades in the West; through
causes over which they had no control. Russia had completely broken down. In
her case, with a rapidity which made it difficult to realise the situation,
autocracy had changed to liberty, liberty to license, and license to chaos. The
absolute dissolution of all fighting power was partly due to national folly and
partly to deliberate treachery. The leaders of the extreme party had arrived
from Switzerland with a free pass granted by the German authorities. Instantly
they set to work to subvert the comparatively sane government with which the
name of Kerensky is chiefly associated. Lenin and his associates seized the
reins of power and guided their mad team up to and over the precipice. It was
clear to any observer that such a frenzy of insanity must have its reaction,
and great pity was felt for those more honourable Russians who were compelled
to look on at the degradation of their country. The new super-democracy began
its career by repudiating its debts of honour, and by betraying all the other
democracies of the world. Such conditions could not last; but meanwhile the
Germans overran the country at their pleasure, practically annexed both Finland
and the Ukraine, and helped themselves to harvests, warships, or anything else
they might desire. Chivalrous little Romania, with the foe in front and the
traitor in the rear, was compelled to make such hard terms as she might &mdash;
surely one of the most bitter tragedies of history.</p>
<p>As a result of this huge defection the whole force of Germany and of
Austria, together with a good deal of captured Russian artillery, was available
for the Western war, and from November to March an endless succession of troop
trains were bearing the divisions which had extended from the Baltic to the
southern frontiers of Russia, in order to thicken the formidable array already
marshalled across France. A great Austrian army assembled on the line of the
Piave, where the Italians had formed their new front, while a second force in
the mountains upon their flank seemed to hang suspended like an avalanche,
ready at any instant to crash down into the valleys. In spite of this imminent
danger the situation was so threatening in France that half of the British and
French force in Italy had to be recalled, while the gallant Italians actually
sent some divisions of their own best troops to aid the Allies in the more
vital theatre of war. It was not only the vast concentration of infantry which
formed the immediate menace, but it was the addition to the German gun power,
in which the Austrians greatly assisted. The enemy was acting also upon
internal lines and with excellent radiating communications, so that by
assembling large bodies in certain central points he could hurl them against
any portion of a long arc of the Allied line and depend upon several days of
battle before the reinforcements could intervene. This, as it proved, was a
very great advantage. He had also used his Russian experiences to initiate and
improve a new form of attack by which he was confident, with a confidence which
proved to be well justified, that he could certainly make a deep impression
upon the Allied line, and turn the war, for a time at least, into one of open
movement. Such was the very favourable position of the German army at the
opening of the tremendous campaign of 1918, which was enhanced by the fact that
they had reduced to slavery the population in their rear, and had thus gained a
very solid present advantage at the cost of a universal hatred and execration
of which no man now living will see the end. In the hope of being a nation of
victors they took steps which will brand them as a nation of monsters so long
as history is read&mdash;a nation with modern minds but with worse than
mediaeval souls.</p>
<p>The Allies were not without their consolations, though they lay rather in
the future than in the present. Their veteran armies, though somewhat
outnumbered, had done so well in the offensive of the year before that they had
good reason to believe that, acting upon the defensive, they would either hold
the German onslaught, or at worst inflict such losses that they would gradually
bring them to an equilibrium. Neither France nor Britain had called upon its
last reserves to the same extent as Germany, and behind both was the mighty
power of America. Up to date the American forces landed in France had not been
sufficiently trained or numerous to influence the course of events, but from
the spring onwards there was a steady flow, and hardly a day elapsed without
one or more transports laden with troops arriving in the British or French
ports. The men were of splendid spirit and physique, and the mere sight of them
revived the weary souls of those who had fought the hard fight so long. It was
the knowledge of these reinforcements and the constant drafts from Britain
which stiffened men's courage and steeled their breasts in the desperate days
to come.</p>
<p>Turning our eyes now from the general prospect and concentrating our
attention upon the dispositions of the British army, it may be said that the
ranks had been filled once more after the very expensive fighting of the
autumn. Divisions were, however, weaker than before for, following the German
model, one battalion had been taken out of each brigade, so that in future a
division consisted of nine ordinary units and one pioneer. Of the six divisions
lent to Italy three had been brought back in view of the German menace. The
line still ran from Houthulst Forest and Passchendaele in the north along the
familiar curve by La Bass&eacute; and Lens to the east of Vimy Ridge, and
thence along the first Hindenburg Line, with the one six-mile breach in front
of Cambrai. The Third Army, under Sir Julian Byng, covered the ground between
Arras and Cambrai, whilst the Fifth, under Sir Hubert Gough, carried it south
from that point. His junction with the French was an indeterminate one and was
twice moved to the south, the second move on February 15 carrying his right
wing across the Oise as far south as Barisis, eight miles beyond La
F&egrave;re. There is no doubt that in lengthening his line to this extent Sir
Douglas Haig took on more ground than his troops could be reasonably expected
to hold, and that General Gough was given a hard task. It was done, as was
shown in a subsequent debate, against the better judgment of the British at the
urgent behest of M. Clemenceau. We must remember, however, that our Allies had
frequently taken risks in order to help us, and that it was for us to
reciprocate even though it might occasionally, as in this instance, lead to
trouble. There was a tendency at the time for soldiers and politicians to put
the blame upon each other, whereas all were equally the victims of the real
cause, which was the crushing burden placed upon us by the defection of our
Ally. It is easy to be wise after the event, but it was impossible to tell with
any certainty where the impending blow might fall, and M. Clemenceau was very
naturally anxious about the French line in Champagne, which was strengthened by
this extension of the British flank. There is in truth no need for mutual
reproach, as everyone acted for the best under the almost intolerable
circumstances imposed by the new conditions.</p>
<p>Before referring in detail to the tremendous storm which was visibly banking
up in the East, and which broke upon March 21 along the British lines from the
Scarpe to the Oise, some allusion should be made to one or two sharp German
attacks in the extreme north, by which the enemy endeavoured to draw the
attention of the Allies away from the district in which their first real attack
was planned. In the first of these, delivered upon March 8 to the south of
Houthulst Forest, in the area formerly occupied by the Second Army, the German
stormers, attacking on a mile of front, gained a footing in the advanced
trenches over a space of 500 yards, but were driven out again and past their
own front line by a spirited counter-attack. The losses of the Thirty-sixth
Reserve Division, who carried out the operation, were considerable, and their
gains were nil. The second attack was made upon the same evening in the
neighbourhood of Polderhoek Ch&acirc;teau, to the south of the Ypres front.
Here again some trench elements were secured in the first rush, but were
entirely regained by the 10th K.R.R. and 13th Fusiliers of the 111th Brigade,
who restored the line. Neither attempt was serious, but they were operations on
a considerably larger scale than any others during the winter. These attacks
were delivered upon the front of Jacob's Second Corps, which belonged to
Rawlinson's Fourth Army, but within a few days Plumer had returned from Italy,
and he, with the Second British Army, took over this sector once again.</p>
<p>We must now turn to the long stretch from in the north to La F&egrave;re in
the south, a front of fifty miles, upon which the great German blow was about
to fall. It is said that after a tour of the whole line General Ludendorff
determined upon this as being the most favourable region for a grand attack.
Granting that for general motives of policy the assault should be on the
British rather than on the French army, it is clear that he could have come to
no other decision since Flanders at that time of year might have been a morass,
and the rest of the line was to a large extent upon commanding ground. On the
other hand the desolate country which had been already occupied and abandoned
by the Germans was in front of their new advance, and it was likely that this
would act as a shock-absorber and take the momentum off a victorious advance
before it could reach any point of vital strategic importance. The German Staff
scepis, however, to have placed great confidence upon their secrecy, their
numbers, and their new methods. Their ambitious plan was to break right through
to Amiens, to seize the line of the Somme so as to divide the Allied armies,
and then to throw their weight to right or to left as might seem best, the one
movement threatening the Channel ports and the other Paris. Their actual
success, though it was considerable, fell so far short of their real intentions
that disappointment rather than triumph must have been their prevailing
emotion. Looking first upon their side of the line one can appreciate in a
general way the efficient methods which they took to ensure success. The troops
had been exercised in the back areas during the whole winter in the new arts of
attack, which will be more fully indicated when the battle opens. They were
then assembled at various railway junctions, such as Valenciennes, Maubeuge,
Wassigny, and Vervins, sufficiently far from the front to escape direct
observation. Then for seven nights in successive marches the troops were
brought forward, finally reaching the front lines on the night before the
attack, while the guns, the mine-throwers, and the munition dumps had already
been prepared. The whole affair was upon a gigantic scale, for sixty divisions,
or half a million of infantry, were thrown into the battle upon the first day,
with half as many in immediate reserve. Secrecy was preserved by every possible
precaution, though the British aeroplanes, casting down their flare lights upon
crowded roads, gave few hopes that it could be sustained. Three of the most
famous generals in the German service were in immediate charge of the
operations. General Otto von Below, the victor of the Italian disaster, with
the Seventeenth Army in the north; General von Marwitz, who had distinguished
himself at Cambrai, with the Second Army in the centre; and General von Hutier,
the conqueror of Riga and the inventor of the new tactics, with the Eighteenth
Army in the south. It was to the last, which was under the nominal command of
the Crown Prince, that the chief attack was allotted. Forty divisions, with
large reserves, were placed under his command for an assault upon General
Gough's lines between Cambrai and the Oise, while twenty divisions, with
corresponding reserves, were thrown against the British Third Army, especially
that section of it opposite Croisilles and Bullecourt. Never in the history of
the world had a more formidable force been concentrated upon a fixed and
limited objective. The greatest possible expectations were founded upon the
battle, which had already been named the "<i>Kaiser- Schlacht</i>," while the
day chosen had been called Michael's day, or the day of Germany's revenge.</p>
<p>We shall now turn from the German preparations and examine that British
position upon which the attack was about to fall. It was divided into two
sections, a point north of Gauche Wood upon the Cambrai front being roughly the
point of division between the Third and the Fifth Armies. These armies were of
equal strength, each having twelve divisions of infantry in the line or in
immediate support. These divisions with their respective positions and varying
experiences will presently be enumerated. For the moment it may be stated that
the Third Army consisted of four cOrps, the Seventeenth (Fergusson) in the
Arras&mdash;Monchy sector, the Sixth (Haldane) carrying the line past
Bullecourt, the Fourth (Harper) continuing it to near the Cambrai district, and
the Fifth (Fanshawe) covering that important point where the gap in the
Hindenburg Line seemed to make an attack particularly Likely. The Fifth Army in
turn consisted of the Seventh Corps (Congreve) in the southern part of the
Cambrai district, the Nineteenth Corps (Watts) from south of Ronssoy to
Maissemy, the Eighteenth Corps (Maxse) in front of St. Quentin, and the Third
Corps (Butler) covering the great frontage of 30,000 yards from Urvillers,
across the Oise, down to Barisis, eight miles south of La F&egrave;re. This
long curve of fifty miles chapter was strongly fortified throughout its whole
length, but the position was stronger in the north where the British had been
in their lines for a year or more. In the southern sector the new ground which
had been taken over was by no means so strongly organised as its defenders
desired, either in the portion formerly held by the British or in the French
sector, where only two lines existed. In the north a system of successive lines
had been adopted, called respectively the forward line, the corps line, and the
army line. In the south there was less depth to the defence, but every possible
effort was made to improve it, the work proceeding night and day, and the
soldiers being tied to it to an extent which gave little time for military
exercises. In this work the cavalry and special entrenching battalions gave
valuable help. As a result, by the third week of March the south was as well
prepared as the number of men available would allow. There were not enough to
man continuous lines of trenches over so great a front. A system was adopted,
therefore, by which there was an advanced zone, consisting of a thin line of
infantry supported by numerous small redoubts, each of which contained several
machine-guns and a company of infantry. These were to take off the edge of the
assault, and it was hoped, as half a mile separated the two armies, and the
fields of fire were good, that before reaching the position at all the enemy
would suffer severely. A thousand yards behind the 'advance zone was the true
battle zone, where the main body of the infantry lay behind barbed wire with
the support of isolated forts. Beyond these again was a third zone, 2000 yards
farther to the rear, but this had not yet been completed. Behind the whole
position in the southern part of the line was the great bend of the River
Somme, which was also being organised as a reserve line, but was very
incomplete. It should be emphasised that these deficiencies were in no way due
to the British command, which was so assiduous in its preparations that it
rather raised the ridicule of certain unimaginative people upon the spot who
cannot see a danger until it actually materialises in front of them. The fact
that General Gough had been a cavalry general, and that his actions in the war
had been aggressive rather than defensive, gave a false impression at the time
in certain quarters. It is certain that nothing was neglected in the way of
defence which skill could devise or industry carry out.</p>
<p>The general situation then upon the night of March 20, when the German
preparations were complete, was that along the whole front the Germans were
crouching for their spring, and that their first line consisted of sixty
divisions, or more than half a million infantry, against the twenty-four
divisions, or about 200,000 infantry, who awaited them. The odds were greatly
increased by the fact that the Germans held some thirty divisions in immediate
reserve, whereas the British reserves, especially in the south of the line,
were few and distant. The German concentration of gun power was more than twice
that of the British. The published account of a German officer claims it as
fourfold, but this is probably an overstatement. In describing the results of
this great attack we shall deal first with the sequence of events in the sector
of the Third Army in the north, and then turn to those connected with the Fifth
Army in the south.</p>

north</p>
<p class="first">TAKING the account of this great action upon March 21 from the
north, we shall begin with Sir Julian Byng's Third Army. The left of this force
joined the Thirteenth Corps, which formed the flank of the First Army, to the
north of Fampoux, while the extreme right touched the left of the Seventh
Corps, the northern unit of the Fifth Army to the east Metz-en-Couture opposite
to Cambrai.</p>
<p>The Seventeenth Corps consisted of the Fifteenth and Fourth Divisions with
the Guards Division in reserve. They extended as far south as the Sens&eacute;e
River, and were not seriously engaged upon March 21, though exposed to heavy
shelling. We may for the time leave them out of the narrative. It was
immediately to the south of them, upon the Sixth Corps commanded by General
Haldane, that the storm burst in its full fury. Nothing can exaggerate the
concentrated weight of the blow which fell upon this and the next portion of
the line. The divisions from the north were the old fighting Third upon the
Sens&eacute;e section, the Thirty-fourth to Third the south of it, and the
Fifty-ninth North Midland Territorials on the right. The Fortieth Division was
in close support. These were the devoted units who upon that terrible day had
to bear the heavy end of the load in the northern half of the line. Let us turn
first to the arduous experiences of the Third Division. This veteran division,
still commanded by General Deverell, had all three brigades in the line, the
76th upon the left, the 8th in the centre, arid the 9th upon the right, the
battalions in the advanced line being the 2nd Suffolks, 2nd Royal Scots, and
1st Northumberland Fusiliers. The front covered was 8000 yards from Croisilles
to the Arras-Cambrai road in the north, both inclusive. This front had been
strengthened by every device which experience could suggest, and was organised,
as already explained upon three lines, which may be called the front, support,
and reserve lines. Its backing of artillery was formidable, its moral high, and
it offered a solid barrier to any enemy, however numerous.</p>
<p>The preliminary bombardment here as elsewhere broke out shortly after five
in the morning, and contained a large proportion of gas-shells which searched
the rear lines and battery positions as well as the front defences. So far as
the 76th Brigade in the north was concerned no serious infantry attack
followed, and save for some sporadic advances which were easily shot to pieces,
there was no organised attempt upon their sector. The same applies, though in a
less degree, to the central unit, the 8th Brigade. Here there were continual
blasts of heavy fire during the day which decimated but were unable to shake
the Royal Scots in the front trenches. Several times the enemy infantry made
what was rather a menace than an attack, but on each occasion it dissolved into
nothing. It is clear that nothing serious was intended and that these
demonstrations were to hold the troops to their ground. On the right, however,
in front of the 9th Brigade, the attempts were far more deadly and earnest. The
first of these lasted from 7:30 till 10, and gained a footing in the front
trenches, but failed before a determined attack by bombing parties of the
Northumberland Fusiliers. In the afternoon the intermittent shelling became
very severe, the trench mortar fire upon the front lines being so heavy as to
knock them to pieces and stop all lateral communication. It was a
nerve-shattering ordeal to the garrisons of these posts, crouching hour after
hour in the midst of these terrible explosions. The bravest man on earth may
find his spirit wilt under such conditions. Finally, about half-past three,
there came a forward surge of grey infantry from Fontaine Wood which reached
and occupied the front line, or the irregular hummocks where the front line had
been. Every effort to extend this advantage was crushed almost before it could
get started. There was complete stability here, but it was known that things
were not altogether well with the Thirty-fourth Division upon the right, and
masses of German infantry were seen moving down the Cherisy valley in that
direction, a fair mark for the heavy guns. The 4th Royal Fusiliers were brought
forward to reinforce their old comrades of Northumberland, and the line on the
right was thrown back to get touch with the 11th Suffolks of the The 101st
Brigade. In this support position they were solidly linked with the units to
right and left, so that the close of the day found the whole of this portion of
the front absolutely intact, save for the loss of the obliterated front
line.</p>
<p>We shall now turn to the fortunes of the next unit upon the right, the
Thirty-fourth Division, a composite hard fighting body composed of
Northumbrians, Scots, and East Anglian troops. General Nicholson, commanding
this division, had learned from a prisoner that the coming German attack would
begin at Bullecourt and then turn to the north. Such incidents make one
doubtful of the wisdom of that policy of "teaching men to take an intelligent
interest in the operations" which is so often advocated. In this case flank
defences were arranged and all due preparation was made.</p>
<p>The blow fell even as had been foretold, but the portion of the line which
was crushed in was on the front of the Fifty-ninth Division, to the right of
the Thirty-fourth. The result was, however, that after the capture of
Bullecourt, which occurred about ten, the German stormers began to work round
the right rear of the 102nd Brigade, the nearest unit of the Thirty-fourth
Division. The flanking line of defence was manned by the 22nd Northumberland
Fusiliers and strengthened by many Lewis guns, so that it took heavy toll from
the masses of German infantry who were moving across. This flanking line was
thickened by the 25th Northumberland Fusiliers and by the 1st East Lancashires.
The heavy blow had forced back the Fifty-ninth Division, and by one o'clock
Ecoust also was in the hands of the enemy, bringing them considerably to the
rear of the fourth. Up to 4:30 in the afternoon the Germans were attacking the
102nd Brigade from the flank, but up to that hour they had not succeeded in
shifting the solid Tynesiders who held the improvised line. Nevertheless the
heavy and constant shelling reduced the strength of the defenders, who in many
cases were quite cut off, and had to hold their positions with bombs and rifles
as best they could. Farther south the Germans, passing Noreuil in their western
advance, had turned in considerable numbers to the north, well to the rear of
the flanking line, so that the British in reserve found themselves facing
south-west, but fought on none the less, the 22nd, 23rd, and 25th
Northumberland Fusiliers in a mixed line holding firmly to their ground at the
imminent risk of being cut off, while the 160th Brigade R.F.A. were firing at
ranges of 800 yards. As the German flood rolled on it engulfed these guns, but
the gunners withdrew the blocks and retired slowly, fighting in line with the
infantry. This movement in turn affected the British garrisons of the more
forward trenches, who in any case were very severely pressed by the German
bombers, so that there was a general retirement towards the north in the
direction of Croisilles. Outside this village the remains of the 101st and
102nd Brigades formed a line, and with the aid of the 10th Lincolns and 9th
Northumberland Fusiliers of the 103rd Brigade held the enemy off from occupying
it. The Fortieth Division was, as will be shown, coming up to fill the gap, and
thus, although the Thirty-fourth had been curled backwards as if a huge steel
plough had driven a furrow to the south of them, there was still no absolute
fracture of the Towards evening patrols of the enemy had succeeded in filtering
through into the village of Croisilles, but General Haldane had already seen
that his corps front needed reorganisation in view of what had occurred to the
south. Orders were given, therefore, to the 15th Royal Scots, who were still
holding on near Croisilles, to abandon the village and take up new positions to
the west of it. With the help of the 119th Brigade of the Fortieth Division
these changes were made, and a line built up in front of Henin Hill for the
next day's battle. The general result, therefore, of the day's fighting was, so
far as the Thirty-fourth Division was concerned, that the left flank was still
in touch with the Third Division in the northern support line, but that the
right and centre had to hinge back upon it on account of the break through to
the south of them, and had been compelled to uncover Croisilles and abandon it
to the enemy. The casualties had been high, especially in the 102nd Brigade
upon the defensive flank. Of these, about 1200 out of a total trench strength
of 1800 were lost, some being cut off but the greater number injured by the
bombardment. Three companies of the 25th Northumberland Fusiliers were engulfed
in the German tide and submerged, as were the field-guns already mentioned,
which were fought by their crews until the very last instant. The 11th Suffolks
upon the left flank of the 101st Brigade held absolutely fast all day, and by
their fire gave great help to the Third Division to their north.</p>
<p>The next unit upon the line was the Fifty-ninth North Midland Division
(Romer) which had a front of over 5000 yards. They covered the important
Chapter villages of Bullecourt, Ecoust, and Noreuil, the former being in the
very front line. The 178th Brigade of Sherwood Foresters were upon the right
and the 176th of Staffords upon the left, with the 177th of Lincolns and
Leicesters in reserve. In the southern section of this position was the long
shallow slope of the Noreuil valley, the nearer half of which came within the
Fifty-ninth area, while the farther was held by the Sixth Division. It was
speedily apparent by the intensity of the bombardment and by the rumoured
concentration of the infantry that this was the centre of danger. About ten
o'clock a demonstration was made against the 2/6 Sherwood Foresters upon the
left, but the real attack came later when on the right centre a heavy mass of
the enemy surged through the outpost line and established itself within the
support line. At about the same hour the German infantry struck in great force
up the channel of the Noreuil valley, and having pushed their way as far as the
western edge of Noreuil turned to the north-west, working along a hollow road
between Noreuil and Longatte. Two companies of the 2/5 Sherwoods, together with
the 470th Field Company R.E., were caught between the pincers of this double
German attack, and were entirely destroyed on the Noreuil-Ecoust road, only one
officer and six sappers making their way safe to Vraucourt. The 2/5 Lincolns of
the supporting brigade, moving up to the support of their comrades, were
themselves involved in the tragedy and three companies were practically
annihilated. This rapid German advance, with the heavy British losses, had all
taken place by 11 A.M., and created the situation which reacted so unfavourably
upon the Thirty-fourth in the north. The Germans having got so far forward in
the south were able to assail the flank of the 176th Brigade in the north,
which threw out a defensive line as far as Ecoust and defended itself strongly.
Their position, however, was an almost impossible one, and when later in the
day the enemy took Ecoust and swung round to their rear these battalions,
already much reduced, were overwhelmed by the attack, the survivors joining up
with the Thirty-fourth Division in their retreat. The machine-guns, so long as
they were in action, caused heavy casualties to the enemy, but the latter were
swarming on all sides, and eventually the guns had either to withdraw or were
captured.</p>
<p>With the two front brigades destroyed and the whole position occupied, the
Germans may well have thought that a long advance was within their power, but
in this they were soon undeceived. The support brigade, the 177th, still barred
their way, and it had been strengthened by Headquarters staffs, bands,
transport men and others, and very especially by the pioneer battalion, the 6/7
Scots Fusiliers. These men occupied the third defence line, and from the Hog's
Back on which it was sited, they defied every effort of the Germans to get
forward from Ecoust. This position was well covered by artillery and supported
by machine-guns. So strong was the defence that the enemy were beaten back
three times, and on the last occasion, late in the afternoon, fairly took to
their heels. Shortly afterwards the 120th Brigade from the Fortieth Division
came into support, and the situation was saved for the day. How terrific had
been the strain upon the Fifty-ninth Division may be reckoned from the fact
that their losses were close upon 5000 out of a ten-battalion unit. It is true
that they had been driven by vastly superior numbers out of their two front
lines with the attendant villages, but evening found them still defiant, and,
for the time, victorious, with their right still linked up with the Sixth
Division and their left with the Thirty-fourth. There could not have been a
finer recovery under more arduous circumstances. It was the last of the
Fifty-ninth Division, however, for many a day to come, for the Fortieth
(Ponsonby) taking charge in this sector, gathered to itself the fifteen
field-guns still left of the artillery and the only remaining brigade. It was
as well, for they would need every gun and every rifle in the dark days to
come. Four German divisions, the 111th, 221st, 6th Bavarian, and 2nd Guards
Reserve, had been engaged in the attack. Even admitting that some of these
divisions were concerned also with the attack upon the Thirty-fourth Division,
the latter had the 234th and some smaller units in front of it, so that it is
within the mark to say that five German had attacked two British divisions, and
by the aid of a vastly superior light and heavy artillery equipment had pushed
them back to their reserve line, but had failed to break them. It was not a
fight of which either nation need be ashamed.</p>
<p>This completes a superficial view of the experiences of the Sixth Corps upon
March 21. In order to get the full picture one should understand that the Sixth
Division upon the right had also been driven from their sector, including
several important villages. For the sake of continuity of narrative it will be
best to merely indicate this fact for the moment, and to continue to follow the
fortunes of Haldane's Corps during the fateful days which followed, casting a
glance also to the north where the Seventeenth Corps was gradually involved in
the fight. We shall bear in mind, then, the long slanting front from the old
positions on the left to Henin Hill and the Hog's Back upon the right, and we
shall return to the Third Division at the northern end of the line.</p>
<p>The night had been quiet along the whole corps front, which seemed to imply
some exhaustion of the attack. In the morning this lull still continued in the
region of the Third Division, which had up to now been just outside the track
of the storm. During the morning and afternoon of March 22 no serious attack
was made upon this point, but in the evening the enemy, having made a lodgment
upon Henin Hill in the south-west, was able to make a powerful onslaught from
the flank which met with very little success. Its first onrush pushed back the
20th K.R.R., pioneer battalion of the division, in the trench called Hind
Avenue, but the ground was regained by the 13th King's Liverpool, while the 4th
Royal Fusiliers loosened the German grip of another small corner of trench. Up
to nightfall the attempts continued, alternating with bombardments, but no
progress was made, the 9th Brigade beating down every new advance.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock at night orders reached the division that as the
Seventeenth Corps were falling back for strategic reasons to the west of Monchy
on the north, while the Thirty-fourth were also retreating upon the south, the
Third Division must retire in conformity with them. It was no easy task under a
heavy shell-fall and with an elated enemy in close contact. It was of
importance that the telephoned orders should not be tapped, and it is
suggestive of the world-wide services of the British soldier that they were
sent over the wires in Arabic and Hindustani. Before morning the weary troops
had been quickly withdrawn without confusion or mishap, and all were safely
aligned in their new positions. Their defence of their battleground had been a
splendid one, and though they had no huge mass attack to contend with, such as
had dashed the line of the Fifty-ninth to pieces, still they had constant
severe pressure and had withstood it completely.</p>
<p>We left the Thirty-fourth Division upon the evening of March 21 still
holding its reserve lines, with its three brigades in line, the 103rd on the
right in touch with the Fortieth Division, and the 101st on the left where the
Third Division joined it. A spirited little body, the J Special Company R.E.,
had joined the fighting line of the Thirty-fourth, and did good work with it.
About 8 A.M. upon March 22nd the enemy attacked the 102nd Brigade in the
Croisilles sector, but two attempts had no result, though the general British
line was now 500 yards west of the village. About ten o'clock a misfortune
occurred, for a heavy column of the enemy, moving up through a dense mist,
broke through the 101st Brigade and carried the greater part of Henin Hill, a
most important strategic point. The possession of the hill was, however,
contested most strongly by the Fortieth Division machine-gun company and by the
11th Suffolks, who by their valiant resistance prevented the enemy from gaining
the whole crest, though they could not stop them from extending north and
south, which turned the line of the troops at the flanks and caused them to
fall back. The troops to the south, the 15th and 16th Royal Scots, withdrew
slowly to a new position west of Boyelles; the remains of the 102nd Brigade (it
was but 500 strong at the beginning of the action) fell back upon the supports;
while the valiant men of Suffolk, aided by Colonel Roberts' machine-guns, still
fought stoutly upon the top of the incline, though entirely isolated upon the
right flank. Finally the shattered remains of this staunch battalion withdrew
towards the north-west, their slow retreat being covered by Lieutenant Woods,
who met his death in the venture, and by a handful of machine-gunners.</p>
<p>The chief evil result from the capture of Henin Hill was in the south, where
it enabled the enemy by a joint frontal and flank attack at the junction of the
Thirty-fourth and Fortieth Divisions, to push back the 9th Northumberland
Fusiliers and 13th Yorkshire, and to get possession of the village of St.
Leger. The 103rd Brigade moved back to Judas' Farm to the west of St. Leger,
while the 119th Brigade prolonged the line to the south. A few machine-guns,
with their feed blocks removed, were lost on Henin Hill, but otherwise no booty
was obtained by the enemy. On the evening of the 22nd the infantry of the
Thirty-first Division was rushed to the front, and the Thirty-fourth Division
after their two days of desperate and honourable battle, were drawn back for a
rest. During March 22 the 103rd Brigade held on to St. Leger and St. Leger
Wood, and so blocked the valley of the Sens&eacute;e.</p>
<p>To the south of the Thirty-fourth Division the Fifty-ninth Division had now
been entirely replaced by the Fortieth, save for the 177th Brigade, the
artillery, and machine-guns, some of which rendered splendid service during the
day. There was little fighting in the morning of March 22, but about mid-day it
was found that some hundreds of Germans s with a profusion of machine-guns
("many bullets but few men" was the key-note of the new advanced tactics) were
close to the divisional front in the region of St. Leger Wood. These were
driven back, and fourteen of their guns taken, after some confused but vigorous
fighting, in which Lieutenant Beal captured four guns himself before meeting a
glorious death. Several times the enemy pushed strong patrols between the Sixth
and Fortieth Divisions in the Vaux-Vraumont sector, but these were always
expelled or digested. Shortly after mid-day, however, a very strong attack
broke upon this line, pushing back the left of the Sixth Division and causing
heavy losses to the Highlanders of the 120th Brigade upon the right of the
Fortieth Division. The 14th Argyll and Sutherlands, with the 10/11 Highland
Light Infantry, were the units concerned, and they restored their line, which
had been bent backwards. Finding, however, that they had lost touch with the
Sixth Division to the south, they fell back until communication was restored.
All day groups of German machine-gunners could be seen rushing forward, their
crouching figures darting from cover to cover, while all day also the guns of
the division observed and shattered the various nests which were constructed.
Major Nesham distinguished himself in this work. Towards evening of the 22nd it
was known that Vraumont to the south was in German possession, and orders were
given to withdraw to the new general line which this change and the Capture of
Henin Hill must entail. In the new position the Fortieth was still in close
touch with the Sixth in the neighbourhood of Beugnatre, the general line of the
withdrawal being in a south-westerly direction. The losses had been heavy
during Sixth the day, and included Colonel Eardley-Wilmot of the 12th
Suffolks.</p>
<p>The line of the Seventeenth and of the Sixth Corps, upon the morning of
March 23, stretched from the south of Fampoux, west of Heninel.and of St. Leger
down to Mory. The Seventeenth Corps had not yet been seriously attacked. We
shall continue with the record of the Sixth Corps, which now consisted of the
Third Division in the north, parts of the Guards Division, which had formed up
to their right, the Thirty-first Division north of Mory, and the Fortieth
Division to the west of Mory, with outposts in the village. We shall again
trace the events from the northern flank. No serious movement occurred during
the day in front of the Third Division or of the Guards, but there was a report
of concentrations of infantry and other signs which indicated that the storms
of the south would soon spread upwards in that direction. The Thirty-first
Division, the well-tried Yorkshire unit, still retained two of its old
brigades, but had an additional 4th Brigade of Guards, cut from the old Guards
Division by the new system of smaller units. General Bridgford had taken over
command just before the battle and would be the first to admit that the
splendid efficiency of his troops was due to General Wanless 0'Gowan, who had
been associated with them so long. They carried a high reputation into this
great battle and an even higher one out of it. On the morning of March 23 the
division faced the Germans to the north of Mory Copse, having the 4th Guards
Brigade upon the right and the 93rd Brigade upon the left. Two German divisions
which had already been engaged, the 111th and the 2nd Guards Reserve, tried to
break this fresh line and were each in turn broken themselves, as were the
German batteries which pushed to the front and found themselves under the
double fire of the Thirty-first and Thirty-fourth divisional artillery.
Prisoners taken in this repulse gave the information that the Germans were
already a full day behind their scheduled programme in this quarter. All
attacks upon the Thirty-first met with the same fate during the day, but the
enemy, as will be shown, had got a grip of Mory for a time, and pushed back the
Fortieth in the south. Instead of a retirement the 92nd Brigade was brought
from reserve and placed upon the exposed flank, while the Guards and
Yorkshiremen still stood firm. In the evening the general line extended from
north of Ervillers, where the 92nd Brigade was on watch, to the region of
Hamelincourt, where the 93rd had their line.</p>
<p>The heaviest work of the day had fallen upon the Fortieth Division, which
had dug itself in west of Mory and of Mory Copse, with strong posts in the
village itself. The enemy attacked in the morning of March 23 in great force
and got complete possession of Mory. A splendid counter-attack, however, by the
13th East Surreys and 21st Middlesex at 2:30 P.M. regained the village. A deep
cutting ran up to Mory from Vraucourt in the south-east, and along this the
Germans sent their reinforcements, but the artillery of the British got the
range of it and caused heavy losses. The village was held all day, under the
local direction of Colonel Warden of the Surreys, and was violently attacked by
the enemy after dark, with the result that desultory hand-to-hand fighting went
on among the houses during the whole night. At one time the British had won to
the eastern edge, and then again they were forced back to the centre. When one
remembers that these men had been fighting for three days, with little food and
less sleep, it was indeed a fine performance. One small post of the 18th Welsh
under Sergeant O'Sullivan was isolated for nearly two days and yet cut its way
out, the gallant Irishman receiving a well-deserved honour. The morning of
March 24 found little change along the line of the corps. If the Germans were
already a day behind they showed no signs of making up their time. The 40th
Machine-gun Battalion had done particularly fine work during the day. As an
example of the gallantry which animated this unit it may be recorded that two
of the guns having been rushed by the Germans near Ervillers, Lance-Corporal
Cross volunteered to recover them single-handed, which he did in such fashion
that seven German prisoners appeared carrying them and marching at the point of
his revolver, an exploit for which he was decorated.</p>
<p>March 24 was marked by considerable activity in the Mory district, but no
strong attack developed to the north of it. On the front of the Thirty-first
and Fortieth Divisions, however, the battle raged with great intensity. The
enemy had full possession of Mory by 9 A.M., and was attacking the depleted
battalions opposed to them along the, whole divisional front so that they were
compelled to fall slowly back, and by the late afternoon held a line about half
a mile east of the Arras-Bapaume road. The situation to the south had been such
that the Fourth Corps had to arrange to withdraw to the west of Bapaume, so
that in any case the Sixth Corps would have been compelled to throw back its
right flank. The Sixth Division on the immediate right had been relieved by the
Forty-first, but touch had been lost and a gap formed, the enemy pushing on to
Favreuil. The Forty-second Division was on the march up, however, in order to
relieve the Fortieth, and two brigades of this formed a defensive line covering
Gomiecourt.</p>
<p>These events had their reaction upon the Thirty-first Division to the north.
When the enemy were seen in Mory at 9 A.M. they were upon the flank of the 4th
Guards Brigade, which at the same time could see heavy columns massing to the
east of St. Leger. The Guards at once dug in a new support switch line towards
Ervillers and so kept touch with the Fortieth in its new position. The 93rd
upon the left was in the meanwhile heavily attacked in front, the enemy coming
on again and again with a powerful support from trench mortars. These attacks
were all beaten back by the stout Yorkshire infantry, but nothing could prevent
the enemy from working round in the south and occupying Behagnies and
Sapignies. The British artillery was particularly masterful in this section,
and no direct progress could be made by the Germans.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon of the 24th the Germans made a new and violent attack
upon the exhausted Fortieth Division and upon the 4th Guards Brigade on the
right of the Thirty-first. In this attack the enemy succeeded in forcing their
way into Ervillers, while the Fortieth reformed upon the west of it, so as to
cover Hamelincourt and Moyenneville. The situation in the morning of March 25
was exceedingly critical for the two advanced brigades of the Thirty-first, the
Guards and the 93rd, who had not budged from their position. The enemy were now
to the right rear, and if they advanced farther northwards there was imminent
danger that the defenders would be cut off. As usual the best defence of a
dashing commander is an attack, so the reserve brigade, the 92nd, was ordered
to advance upon Ervillers, which had already been consolidated by the 91st
German Infantry Regiment. The 10th East Yorkshires led the attack and seized
the village once again, but the situation was still critical, for the enemy
were round the south-west, so that they enveloped the whole right wing of the
division, which was stretched to cracking point with every man in the line.
Touch had for the moment been lost with the troops on the right. As the Germans
poured past the right wing of the Thirty-first they presented a menace for the
future, but a most tempting mark for the present, and ten machine-guns were
kept in continuous action for three hours upon ideal targets ranging from 300
to 1500 yards. The enemy losses upon this occasion were undoubtedly very heavy,
but with fine persistency they kept upon their way, as one-idea'd and
undeviating as a swarm of ants in a tropical, forest. A thick trail of their
dead marked their westward road.</p>
<p>There had been comparative quiet at the north of the line so that the
narrative may still concern itself with the situation which centred round the
Thirty-first Division. The relief of the Fortieth upon the right was now long
overdue, and the men had been worked to the bone, but the fact that
Solly-Flood's Forty-second Division had been deflected to chapter the south
withheld their succours. The Forty-first (Lawford), however, was gradually
coming into action and thickening their shredded lines. Sapignies in the
extreme south of the corps area had been taken by the Germans, but was
recaptured in the morning of March 25 by parts of the 120th Brigade working
with the 127th Brigade of the Forty-first Division. Strong German
reinforcements came up, however, and the British line was pushed back in this
quarter to the north-west until it crossed the high ground east of Gomiecourt.
This southern sector was handed over before noon from the Sixth Corps to the
Fourth, and in the evening the remains of the Fortieth Division were finally
drawn out, having finished a splendid spell of service. The strain upon General
Ponsonby, and upon his three Brigadiers, Crozier, Campbell, and Forbes, had
been enormous, but under the most extreme pressure their units had always
maintained the line. Part of the 126th Brigade of the Forty-second Division was
now on the immediate right of the Thirty-first Division, the 10th Manchesters
connecting up with the 11th East Yorks and doing great work in covering that
flank.</p>
<p>It has already been recorded how the 92nd Brigade, all of East Yorkshire,
had beaten the 91st Prussian Regiment out of the village of Ervillers. A second
regiment of the 2nd Guards Reserve Division, the 77th, essayed the adventure of
turning the Yorkshiremen out, but met with a bloody repulse. "It was a sight to
see," says one who was present. "We were only a battalion, probably 800 strong,
while he had massed artillery and many thousands of infantry. They came over to
us in columns, and they kept coming. They swarmed towards us, but they made no
progress, and we could not shoot fast enough. For three and a half hours they
came, and for three and a half hours we knocked them out. They were falling
like ripe corn before the reaper. As fast as they fell others took their
places, but they could not move the East Yorks." The 2nd Guards Reserve were
worn out by this experience, and it must be admitted that their service in the
battle had been long and arduous. They were relieved by the 16th Bavarians and
the 239th Division, so that there was no surcease in the endless pressure.</p>
<p>At 1:15 the 93rd West Yorkshires upon the left of the line were attacked,
but could no more be shifted than their brother Tykes in the south. The German
stormers never reached the line, partly owing to the excellent barrage and
partly to the steady rifle-fire. After a long interval of following false gods,
such as bombs and rifle grenades, the British soldier was reasserting himself
once more as the best average shot of all the forces engaged, though it must be
admitted that the specialised German snipers with their weapons of precision
were of a high excellence. All day the division stood its ground and hit back
hard at every attack, but by evening the salient had become so extreme that it
was necessary to readjust the line. They fell back, therefore, the 92nd
covering the operation, and took up the line from Moyenneville to
Ablainzeville, where they faced round on the morning of March 26, the 92nd on
the right of the line, the 93rd upon the left, and the 4th Guards in reserve.
On their north lay the division of Guards, on their south the Forty-second
Division.</p>
<p>It was on this morning that an incident occurred leading to the loss of a
village, but also to a singular instance of military virtue. It is the episode
of Moyenneville and of the 15th West Yorkshire Battalion. It appears that an
officer in a state of concussion from the explosion of a shell, sent an order
to the left of the line that they should retire, The Guards and other observers
were surprised to see two British battalions walking back with sloped arms
under no pressure from the enemy. By some chance the mistaken order did not
reach the 15th West Yorkshires, who remained isolated in their position, and
Colonel Twiss refused to follow the brigade until a positive command should
arrive. In their loneliness they extended each flank in search of a friend, and
finally stretched their left into Moyenneville village, which they found
already strongly occupied by the Germans. To many minds this would have
appeared to be an excellent excuse for retirement, but its effect upon the
Yorkshire temperament was that they instantly attacked the village and drove
the intruders out. One considerable body of Germans was driven down into a
hollow and pelted with bullets until the survivors raised the white flag. Very
large numbers of German wounded lay in and around the village, but it was not
possible to send them to the rear. The enemy attacked Moyenneville again, but
the battalion covered the western exits and denied all egress. For the whole of
that day, the whole night, and up to the afternoon of March 27, this heroic
body of infantry held their . ground, though shot at from every side and nearly
surrounded. Not one yard backwards would they budge without a definite written
order. Not only did they hold their own front but their machine-guns played
upon nine successive waves of Germans advancing from Courcelles to Ayette, and
sorely hampered their movements to the south. They covered 2000 yards for
thirty-six hours and relieved the front of the Thirty-first Division from
pressure during that time. When at last the survivors made their way back only
four officers and forty men represented that gallant battalion. Colonel Twiss
was among the missing. "This battalion," says the official record, "by its
brave action relieved the pressure on our front throughout the whole day and
gave the division time to establish its position near Ayette." It was as well
that this pressure should have been taken off, for both upon the 26th and the
27th the ammunition question had become serious, and disaster might have
followed a more extended action.</p>
<p>If we continue to follow the fortunes of the Thirty-first Division, so as to
bring them to their natural term, we find it now covering the line from Ayette
in the south to Ablainzeville. The enemy were driving up on the right of the
division between Courcelles and Ablainzeville, a space which was covered by the
92nd Brigade, who were fighting as brilliantly as ever. Touch had been lost
with the Forty-second upon March 27. The East Yorkshires lost their outpost
line four times this morning and four times they cleared it with the bayonet.
Colonel Rickman, the senior officer on the spot, fought for every inch of
ground as he retired before the ever-increasing pressure. Finally the 92nd,
worn to rags, were ordered to reform behind the 4th Guards Brigade at Ayette,
but so high was their spirit that when during the night there was word that the
Guards were themselves hard pressed they eagerly sent help forward to them,
while the Guards, with equal chivalry of spirit, strictly limited the number
who should come. About six in the evening the Guards threw out a line to the
south and joined up with the 10th Manchesters of the Forty-second Division to
the west of Ablainzeville, so that the line was once more complete.</p>
<p>March 28 found the battle still raging in front of the division, which had
now been engaged for four days without a break and had beaten off the attacks
of five separate German divisions. Two attacks were made, the one upon the 93rd
Brigade, the other upon the Guards. Each attack got into the line and each was
pitchforked out again. So broken was the enemy that they were seen retiring in
crowds towards the north-east under a canopy of shrapnel. The British barrage
was particularly good that day, and many assaulting units were beaten into
pieces by it. The division was terribly worn, and the men could hardly stand
for exhaustion, and yet it was a glad thought that the last glimpse which their
weary and bloodshot eyes had of their enemy was his broken hordes as they
streamed away from the front which they had failed to break. So thin were the
ranks that the pioneer battalion, the 12th Yorkshire Light Infantry, was
brought up to form the line. The Guards had taken their position somewhat to
the west of Ayette, and some of the enemy from the south filtered into the
village, but they were shortly afterwards put out again by Shute's
Thirty-second Division, which had come up for the relief. There was no attack
upon the 29th, and upon the 30th the Thirty-first was able to withdraw, having
established a record which may have been equalled but cannot have been
surpassed by any division in this great battle. Five German divisions, the
111th, 2nd Guards Reserve, 239th and 16th Bavarians, and 1st Guards Reserve,
had been wholly or partially engaged with the Thirty-first. Both sides had lost
heavily and were exhausted. It was here, near Ervillers, that a German war
correspondent has described how he saw the long line of German and British
wounded lying upon either side of the main road.</p>
<p>It has been stated that the Thirty-second Division carried Ayette after this
unit had relieved the Thirty-first Division, and the operation may be treated
here to preserve continuity of narrative. It was of more than local importance,
as it was one of the earliest indications that the British army was still full
of fight and that in spite of every disadvantage it meant to hit back at every
opportunity. On taking over his section of the front. General Shute found
before him the village of Ayette, which was strongly held, but was on the
forward slope of a hill so that it could obtain little help from the German
guns. He at once determined to attack. The 10th Highland Light Infantry of the
14th Brigade were directed upon the village on the night of April 2, while the
96th Brigade continued the attack to the south. The result was a very
heartening little success. Three companies of the Highlanders, numbering under
300 in all, carried the village, though it was held by a German battalion. On
the right, the 16th Lancashire Fusiliers made the attack, and in spite of one
check, which was set right by the personal intervention of General Gird wood of
the 96th Brigade, the objectives were reached. The two attacks were skilfully
connected up by the 5/6th Royal Scots, while a party of sappers of the 20Gth
Field Company under Lieutenant Cronin followed on the heels of the infantry and
quickly consolidated.</p>
<p>Whilst these stirring events had been in progress in the south, the north of
the line had slowly drawn back in order to preserve conformity. The Seventeenth
Corps, as already stated, were to the west of Monchy, and the left of the Sixth
Corps was on the line of Henin, where the Third Division occupied a strong
defensive position. This was strongly attacked upon the forenoon of March 24,
especially on the 8th Brigade front, which was the right of the line, the
Germans swarming up from the south-east of Henin and trying hard to work up the
Henin-Neuville-Vitasse road. This attack fell particularly upon the 1st Scots
Fusiliers, and it was completely repulsed with heavy losses, though it was
facilitated by the sunken roads which converged upon Henin. The Germans in
their retirement had to pass along a slope where once again they lost
heavily.</p>
<p>Shortly after noon the left of the Third Division was also attacked, and the
enemy obtained a temporary footing between the 1st Gordons and 8th Royal
Lancasters of the 76th Brigade. From this he was very soon ejected, and though
many bombing attacks were pushed with great resolution they had no results.
March 25 was quiet upon the front of the Third Division, though the right of
the Guards Division to the south near Boyelles was subjected to one heavy
unsuccessful attack. That evening both the Guards and the Third Division had to
make some retraction of their line in order to conform to the situation already
described in the south, but March 26 passed without an attack, the soldiers
listening with anxious impatience to the roar of battle on their right, unable
to see the fight, and yet keenly conscious that their own lives might depend
upon its results. The 27th was also a day of anxious expectancy, and
culminating upon the 28th in a very severe battle, which was the greater test
coming after so long a period of strain. All three brigades were in the line,
the 8th upon the right, 9th in the centre, and 76th in the north. Still farther
to the north was the 44th Highland Brigade of Reed's Fifteenth Division upon
which the storm first burst.</p>
<p>This brigade at 6:45 was assailed by a bombardment of so severe a character
that its trenches were completely destroyed. The German infantry pushed home
behind this shattering fire and drove back the front line of the Highlanders.
This enabled them to get behind the left flank of the 2nd Suffolks and nearly
surround them, while at the same time they pierced the front of the 1st
Northumberland Fusiliers on their right. The front line of the 8th Royal
Lancasters had also been penetrated, and the British infantry were pushed back
and split up into various small squads of men, intermingled in the north with
Highlanders of the 44th Brigade, and all fighting desperately with the enemy
swarming thickly upon them. By 9:45 the whole front was in German hands. Enemy
field-guns were lining Wancourt Ridge, and as the shattered formations tried to
form a new line they were heavily shelled by them. The loss in officers and men
was very heavy, Colonel James of the Royal Lancasters being among the dead. The
withdrawal was made to the reserve line, which the 44th Brigade had already
occupied in the north. This included the village of Neuville Vitasse which
became untenable from shell-fire, and into the northern portion of which the
enemy was able to push, but in the main the reserve system was occupied, the
movement being covered by some of the 1st Gordons. At this point an equilibrium
was attained and the enemy held after as desperate a conflict as any troops
could be called upon to endure.</p>
<p>On the right of the 76th Brigade the 9th Brigade had also been fighting very
hard, and been compelled to yield some ground before the overpowering weight of
the attack, especially that of the preliminary trench-mortar fire. The first
enemy advance in the morning was completely beaten off with great loss. A
second attack had driven in the 8th Brigade on the right, which enabled the
Germans to get behind the two companies of the 13th King's Liverpool who were
in the front line. These men fought to the end and were last seen standing on
the parapet without a thought of surrender. At the same time a company of the
Northumberland Fusiliers on their left shared their fate, save for one officer
and twelve men who survived. The front line of the 8th Brigade had now ceased
to exist, but the reserve line still held. An attack upon the 7th Shropshires
who, with the remains of the other battalions, held on to it, was successfully
shattered, even the battalion headquarters being brought into the desperate
battle, while the guns on each side fought as hard as the infantry, barrage and
attack succeeding each other with mechanical accuracy, and being answered by an
equally efficient barrage and defence, for the British guns were
extraordinarily well handled that day. About mid-day the enemy got a lodgment
on the right of the reserve line, but the Fusiliers, whose Colonel, Moulton
Barrett, had been hit, and the 13th King's still fought furiously for what was
left, and retained their ground until dusk, when they were drawn back into the
reserve line in order to conform with the 76th Brigade.</p>
<p>The 8th Brigade upon the extreme right of the division had also endured
heavy losses in men and some loss in ground. The front line was held by
companies of the 1st Scots Fusiliers and of the 7th Shropshires. The enemy,
after an unsuccessful attempt, got into the trenches of the latter and bombed
their way along them, clearing that section of the front. It was bomb against
rifle. in the tortuous ditches, and the bomb proved the more handy weapon. The
Scots Fusiliers, who were the next to be assailed, made shift with
rifle-grenades, but these also ran short, and they were forced back, so that
the survivors of the two front companies were driven across the Arras-Bapaume
road. Finally, as in the case of the other brigades, the reserve line was
successfully maintained until evening.</p>
<p>No soldiers could have fought with greater bravery and skill than did the
Third Division on March 28. They were assailed by at least three German
divisions and by a crushing artillery, but they disputed every inch of ground,
and finally fought their formidable adversary to such a complete standstill
that he could not, with several hours of daylight at his disposal, and
disorganised ranks before him, continue his attacks. It is true that he secured
Henin and Neuville Vitasse, but he paid a rich price in blood. So broken were
the enemy that the British wounded came back through their ranks without let or
hindrance. A strong counter would have swept them out of the ground that they
had gained, but neither the Third nor the Fifteenth, which had endured an equal
attack upon the left, was in a condition to advance, while the Guards had been
already withdrawn in accordance with the situation on their right, sixth The
blow which the Germans had received was shown even more clearly by their
failure to attack upon the next day. On March 30 the Third Division was
relieved by the Second Canadians. Their record was a great one, and their
losses, 139 officers and 3500 men, were a measure of their services. In nine
days, before a vastly superior force, they had only gone back 7000 yards, most
of which was strategic withdrawal. Well might General Byng say, "By their
conduct they have established a standard of endurance and determination that
will be a model for all time."</p>
<p>This desperate German attack on March 28 to the north of the British line
had spread right across the face of the Fifteenth Scottish Division through the
line of Orange Hill and on to Telegraph Hill, finally involving the Fourth
Division on the other side of the Scarpe, and the right-hand unit of the
Thirteenth Corps on their left, so that Horne's First Army was now drawn into
the fray, which reached as far north as Oppy and Gavrelle. Along the whole of
this long front there was constant fighting, which in the case of the Fifteenth
Division was as desperate as that of the Third. All three brigades were in the
line, each of them having two battalions in front and one in reserve. Never has
the grand tough Scottish fibre been more rudely tested than on this terrible
day of battle, and never has it stood the strain more splendidly. General
Reed's men undoubtedly saved Arras and held up at least six German divisions
which broke themselves on that rugged and impenetrable line, formed in the
first instance by the 7th Camerons upon the right, the 13th Royal Scots in the
centre, the 9th Black Watch and 7/8 Scots Borderers on the left. As already
told, the shattering bombardment destroyed a large part of the right front,
burying the garrison amid the ruins of their trenches, near their junction with
the Third Division. Some fifty Camerons, under Colonel MacLeod, fought most
desperately round their headquarters, and then fell back slowly upon the 8/10
Gordons, who were holding the Neuville Vitasse trench behind them. This was
about 6 A.M. By 7.40 the whole front line, shot to pieces and with their right
flank gone, readjusted their line to correspond, winding up near the Feuchy
road. There was no rest nor respite, however, for the whole German plan of
campaign depended upon their getting Arras, so they poured forward their waves
of attack regardless of losses. It was a really desperate battle in which the
Scots, lying in little groups among the shell-holes and ditches, mowed the
Germans down as they swarmed up to them, but were themselves occasionally cut
off and overpowered as the stormers found the gaps and poured through them. The
pressure was very great on the front of the Black Watch, north of the Cambrai
road, and there General Reed determined upon a counter-attack, for which he
could only spare a single company of the 10th Scottish Rifles. In spite of the
small numbers it was carried out with such dash, under the personal lead of
Colonel Stanley Clarke, that the front was cleared for a time, and the Germans
thrown back east of Feuchy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Germans had made some advance to the north of the Scarpe, and
the 7/8 Scots Borderers on the left wing had to fall back to preserve the line.
At 11 A.M. the enemy were raging in the centre of the line, and the 6th
Camerons, north of the Cambrai road, were forced backwards, the enemy piercing
their front. Up to 1:45 the weight of the attack was mostly in the north, and
ended by all three brigades moving back, with the enemy still striving with the
utmost fury and ever fresh relays of men to burst the line. At 3 P.M. the
German stormers had won the Bois des Boeufs, but were driven out again by the
9th Black Watch and by the 11th Argylls, who had lost their CO., Colonel
Mitchell. The division was worn to a shadow, and yet the moment that the German
attack seemed to ease both they and the Fourth Division on their north advanced
their front. In this single bloody day the Fifteenth Division lost 94 officers
and 2223 men, but there can be no doubt that their action, with that of the
Third Division and the Fourth on either side of them, was the main determining
factor in the whole of this vast battle. General Reed (a V.C. of Colenso) with
his Brigadiers, Hilliard, Allgood, and Lumsden, might well be proud of the way
they held the pass.</p>
<p>North of the Scarpe all three brigades of the Fourth Division were exposed
to a furious attack, and lost the village of Roeux, which was defended
literally to the death by the 2nd Seaforths of the 10th Brigade, but the 1st
Hants in the front line of the 11th Brigade and the 2nd Essex of the 12th stood
like iron, and in a long day's fighting the enemy was never able to make any
serious lodgment in the position, though the rushes of his bombing parties were
said by experienced British officers to have been extraordinarily determined
and clever. Very little ground was gained by the Germans, and of this a section
upon the left flank near Gavrelle was regained by a sudden counter-attack of
the Fourth Division. Of the attack to the north of the Third Army in the
Bailleul and Oppy district, it should be noted that it fell upon the
Fifty-sixth London Territorial Division, who for once had the pleasant
experience of being at the right end of the machine-gun. They took every
advantage of their opportunity, and there are few places where the Germans have
endured heavier losses with no gains to show in return. The Westminsters and
L.R.B.'s of the 169th Brigade were particularly heavily engaged, and a party of
the former distinguished themselves by a most desperate defence of an outlying
post, named Towy Post, near Gavrelle, which they held long after it was passed
by the enemy, but eventually fought their way to safety. The attack lasted from
seven in the morning till six at night, and the Londoners had full vengeance
for their comrades of July 1916 or August 1917, who had died before the German
wire even as the Germans died that day.</p>
<p>It was a successful day for the British arms, so successful that it marked
the practical limit of the German advance in that quarter, which was the vital
section, covering the town of Arras. There is no doubt that the attempt was a
very serious one, strongly urged by six divisions of picked infantry in front
and four in support, with a very powerful concentration of artillery, which was
expected to smash a way through the three divisions chiefly attacked. The
onslaught was whole-hearted and skilful, but so was the defence. The German
losses were exceedingly high, and save for a strip of worthless ground there
was really nothing to show for them. It was the final check to the German
advance in this quarter of the field, so that the chronicler may well bring his
record to a pause while he returns to the first day of the battle and
endeavours to trace the fortunes of the Fourth and Fifth Corps, who formed the
right half of the Third Army. We have fixed the northern sector of the
battle-field from Bailleul in the north right across the Scarpe and down to the
Cojeul in its position, from which it was destined to make no change for many
months to come. It was the first solidification of the lines, for to the south
all was still fluid and confused.</p>
<p>A word should be said before one finally passes from this portion of the
great epic, as to the truly wonderful work of the Army Medical Corps. In spite
of the constant fire the surgeons and bearers were continually in the front
line and conveying the wounded to the rear. Many thousands were saved from the
tortures of a German prison camp by the devotion which kept them within the
British lines. It may be invidious to mention examples where the same spirit of
self-sacrifice animated all, but one might take as typical the case of the
Fortieth Division, some details of which are available. Colonel M'Cullagh and
his men conveyed to the rear during five days, always under heavy fire, 2400
cases of their own or other divisions, the whole of the casualties of the
Fortieth being 2800. M'Carter, a British, and Berney, an American surgeon, both
had dressing-posts right up to the battle-line, the latter being himself
wounded twice. Wannan, a stretcher-bearer, carried thirty cases in one day, and
ended by conveying a wounded friend several miles upon his shoulders. Private
M'Intosh, attacked by a German while binding an injured man, killed the
cowardly fellow with his own bayonet, and then completed his task. It is hard
to work detail into so vast a picture, but such deeds were infinitely
multiplied along that great line of battle. Nor can one omit mention of the
untiring work of the artillery, which was in action often for several days and
nights on end. Occasionally in some soldier's letter one gets a glimpse of the
spirit of the gunners such as no formal account can convey: "Our battery fired
two days and nights without ceasing until spotted by the German observers. They
then kept up a terrible fire until the British guns were silenced in
succession. One officer was left standing when I was wounded. He shook my hand
as they carried me away. I went, leaving him with about seven men and two guns,
still carrying on as if nothing had happened. This is only one battery among
hundreds which showed as great pluck and tenacity as we did."</p>

<p class="first">TO the immediate south of the Sixth Corps the front line upon
March 21 was held by Harper's Fourth Corps, which consisted of the Sixth
Division (Harden) opposite to Lagnicourt with the Fifty-first Highland Battle
Division to the right of them, which famous unit was now under the command of
General Carter-Campbell, whose name has been recorded in a previous volume as
the only officer left standing in his battalion after the action of Neuve
Chapelle. To the south of the Fourth Corps was the Fifth Corps (Fanshawe) with
the Seventeenth Division (Robertson) on the left, the Sixty-third (Lawrie) in
the centre, and the Forty-seventh (Gorringe) on the right covering the whole
Cambrai salient from Flesqui&egrave;res in the north to the point near
Gouzeaucourt Wood where the Third Army met the left flank of the Fifth. The
line took a considerable bend at this point, marking the ground gained at the
battle of Cambrai, and it was part of the German scheme to break through to the
north and south, so that without attacking the Fifth Battle Corps they would
either cause it to fall back or else isolate and capture it. Had their advance
been such as they had hoped for, they would certainly have placed it in great
peril. Even as it was, it was necessary to withdraw the line, but without undue
haste or confusion. Great pressure was laid upon the Fifth Corps in later
stages of the battle, but beyond a considerable shell-fall and demonstration
there was no actual attack upon March 21. It was by holding certain sections of
the line in this fashion that the Germans were able to pile up the odds at
those places which were actually attacked.</p>
<p>It will be possible to describe the sequence of events with considerably
less detail in this and other sectors of the line, since the general conditions
of attack and defence may be taken as similar to that already described. Here
also the bombardment began with its full shattering force of high explosive,
blue cross invisible gas, mustard gas, phosgene, and every other diabolical
device which the German chemist has learned to produce and the British to
neutralise. In the case of the British infantry, many of them had to wear their
gas masks for eight hours on end, and the gunners were in even worse plight;
but these appliances, which will no doubt find a place in the museums of our
children, were of a surprising efficiency, and hampered the experienced soldier
far less than would have been thought.</p>
<p>The infantry advance was at 9:45, the Germans swarming in under the cover of
Nature's smoke barrage, for here, as in several other parts of the line, a
thick morning mist greatly helped the attack and screened the stormers until
they were actually up to the wire, which had usually been shattered in advance
by the trench-mortars. The line from Flesqui&egrave;res to Dernicourt in the
region of the Fifty-first Division was less seriously attacked, and remained
inviolate, but the northern stretch from Dernicourt to Lagnicourt was struck
with terrific impact, and gave before the blow to very much the same extent as
the divisions to the immediate north. The 71st Brigade in the Lagnicourt sector
was especially hard hit, and was very violently assailed by a strong force of
Germans, which included the 1st Prussian Guard. This famous regiment was at one
time all round the 9th Norfolks, who succeeded at last in fighting themselves
clear, though their Colonel, Prior, and the great majority of the officers and
men in the battalion were killed or wounded. Even these wounded, however, were
safely carried off, thanks to the devotion of Captain Failes and a handful of
brave men. In this desperate struggle the whole brigade was decimated. The 16th
and 18th Brigades had also suffered severely, but the division, in spite of its
losses, was splendidly solid, and fell back slowly upon the support of the 75th
Brigade of the Twenty-fifth Division, which had hastened up to the danger
point. By evening, the Germans, advancing in great numbers and with fine
resolution, had occupied the four villages of Doignies, Boursies, Louverval,
and Lagnicourt, their total penetration from Boursies in the south to Ecoust in
the north, a stretch of seven miles, averaging about 3000 yards. This advance
had completely turned the left wing of the Fifty-first, which was compelled to
fall back in consequence, after stopping several attacks from across the Canal
du Nord. All three brigades of the Fifty-first Division were in line, and of
the three the left and centre had been seriously engaged, the enemy entering
the front line of both before mid-day, and finally reaching the second system
between Louverval and Lagnicourt, so that the defence lay along the
Beaumetz&mdash;Morchies line. The Nineteenth Division was in general support in
this quarter, and the 57th Brigade became practically the right of the
Fifty-first Division. About 7 P.M. in the evening two battalions of it, the 8th
Gloucesters and 10th Worcesters of the 57th Brigade, tried to turn the tide of
fight by a counter-attack, with the aid of tanks, against the village of
Doignies. This attack was successful in retaking half the village, but in the
course of the night it was found necessary to withdraw before the increasing
pressure of the enemy, who brought many machine-guns into the village. During
the night it was arranged that the Fifth Corps should fall back from its
dangerous position in the Cambrai salient, and by eleven next day the divisions
which composed it were ranged from Highland Ridge, through Havrincourt and
Hermies, in touch with the Fourth Corps in the north and with the left of the
Fifth Army in the south.</p>
<p>Whilst this very heavy attack had been made upon the Fourth Corps,
Bainbridge's Twenty-fifth Division had been in close support of the two
divisions in the front line. While the 75th Brigade, as already stated, was
pushed up under very heavy fire to strengthen the Sixth Division in their
desperate resistance, the 74th was allotted to the Fifty-first Division, which
was in less serious need of help during the day. Griffin's 7th Brigade remained
in reserve in front of Morchies, where upon the following morning its presence
was invaluable as a solid unshaken nucleus of resistance. Eight German
divisions were identified that day among those which attacked the two British
divisions in the front line of the Fourth Corps.</p>
<p>There was no attack during the night, but the Germans thickened their
advanced line and were all ready for another strenuous day, while the British,
though hustled and overborne by the tremendous onslaught which had pushed them
back, were still within their battle positions and as doggedly surly as British
infantry usually are in hours of stress and trial. Three strong attacks were
made in the morning and early afternoon between Hermies and Beaumetz, all of
which were driven back. There is no method of gauging the losses of the enemy
upon such occasions, but when one knows that the machine-guns fired as many as
9000 rounds each, and that a single Lewis gun discharged 30,000 bullets, one
can say with certainty that they were very heavy. These attacks fell upon the
Highlanders on the right, the 7th Brigade in the centre, and the remains of the
Sixth Division upon the left. Unhappily, a chain of defence is no stronger than
its weakest link, which finds itself so often at points of juncture. Upon this
occasion the Germans, continually filtering forward and testing every possible
orifice, found a weakness between the 120th Brigade of the Fortieth Division in
the north and the Sixth in the south. This weak point was to be mended by the
Forty-first Division, which had been hurried up from Favreuil, but the time was
too short, or the rent was too wide, so that the Germans pushed rapidly through
and seized the village of Vaulx-Vraumont, separating the Fourth Corps from the
Sixth. It was an anxious moment, and coupled with the German success at Henin
Hill in the north it might have meant the isolation of the Sixth Corps; but the
necessary changes were rapidly and steadily effected, so that before evening
the Highlanders of the 120th Brigade feeling out upon their right and fearing
all would be void, joined hands suddenly with the 15th Hampshires of the
Forty-first Division in the neighbourhood of Beugnatre. Before night had fallen
upon March 22 the line had been restored and built up once more, though some
five thousand yards westward of where it had been in the morning. That evening
the Sixth Division was drawn out, weak and dishevelled, but still full of
fight. With all the hammering and hustling that it had endured, it had saved
its heavy guns and nearly all its field batteries. The Forty-first Division
took its place, and incorporated for the time the 7th Brigade, a unit which had
endured hard fortune, for it had held its ground splendidly with little loss
until, after the fashion of modern war, events upon the other side of the
horizon caused it to get the order to retire, an order which could not be
obeyed without complete exposure and very heavy casualties, including Colonel
Blackall of the 4th South Staffords. Each day of arduous battle was followed by
a no less arduous night, during which, under heavy fire and every conceivable
difficulty the various divisions were readjusted so that the morning light
should show no impossible salients, no outlying indefensible positions, no
naked flanks, and no yawning gaps. How easy are such exercises over a map upon
a study table, and how difficult when conducted by dazed, overwrought officers,
pushing forward their staggering, half-conscious men in the darkness of a
wilderness of woods and fields, where the gleam of a single electric torch may
mean disaster to all! And yet, as every morning dawned, the haggard
staff-captain at the telephone could still report to his anxious chief that all
was well, and his battle-line still intact between the Hun and his goal.</p>
<p>On the morning of the battle the general disposition of the Fifth Corps had
been that the Seventeenth Division (Robertson) was in the line on the left, the
Sixty-third Naval Division (Lawrie) in the centre, and the Forty-seventh
Division (Gorringe) on the right, being the southern unit of the Third Army, in
close liaison with the Ninth Division, the northern unit of the Fifth Army. Two
divisions were in close reserve, the Second (Pereira) on the right, and the
Nineteenth (Jeffreys) on the left.</p>
<p>The Forty-seventh Division was in a particularly important position, since
it was the flank unit and the liaison between the two armies depended upon it.
It had only come into line the day before the battle, taking the place of the
Second Division, which was now in immediate support. On March 21 the 140th
Brigade covered the right of the divisional front, and the 141st the left, the
sector being that of La Vacquerie. In view of the menacing attitude of the
enemy both the 142nd Brigade and the 4th Welsh Fusiliers Pioneer Battalion were
brought nearer to the front line. So heavy was the gas bombardment in the
morning that the front battalion of the 140th Brigade, the 17th London, had to
evacuate some advanced trenches and to wear their gas masks for hours on end.
The front line trenches were blown to fragments, and so also were many of their
garrison. The following infantry advance, however, though vigorously conducted,
had no great weight, and seems to have been the work of two battalions carrying
out a subsidiary attack. By a counter-attack of the 19th London they were
driven out once more.</p>
<p>Whilst this partial attack had been made upon the Forty-seventh Division,
similar assaults had been made upon the Sixty-third in the centre, and upon the
Seventeenth in the northern sector of the Fifth Corps. None of them made more
than petty gains, but in each case the bombardment was formidable, chiefly with
trench-mortar bombs and with gas. In the case of the Forty-seventh Division
there was a considerable interval between the front brigades, because a number
both of the 18th and 17th London had been absolutely destroyed, together with
their trench. There were several other partial attacks during the day, but the
pressure was never extreme, and the withdrawal to Highland Ridge after dusk was
carried out on account of the general tactical position. All wounded men were
carried back, and no booty left to the enemy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the left flank of the Fifth Corps had been covered by the 58th
Brigade of the Nineteenth Division, the 9th Welsh Fusiliers being heavily
engaged. During March 22, Havrincourt, Hermies, and the Beaumetz-Hermies line
were held by the Seventeenth, Nineteenth, and Fifty-first divisions against
repeated German attacks, and in the evening the Nineteenth was in touch with
the Forty-first on its left and with the Second on its right.</p>
<p>On this night of March 22 the principal change was this movement backwards
of the whole Fifth Corps. The retirement of the Fifth Corps continued during
the day of March 23, and was caused by the necessity of conforming with the
Seventh Corps to the south of it which, after valiant exertions, soon to be
described, had lost Nurlu, so placing the enemy upon the right rear of the
divisions in the north. Fins had also been taken in the same neighbourhood. The
Fifth Corps was now heavily pressed in its retreat, all five divisions enduring
considerable losses and having the menace of the enemy constantly upon their
right flank. At noon the general line was east of Equancourt, and this line was
held for a time, but the enemy was still thundering on in the north, his fresh
divisions rolling in like waves from some inexhaustible sea. At 1:30 they were
pushing their attack most desperately upon the weary fringes of riflemen and
groups of tired machine-gunners, who formed the front of the Forty-first
Division between Beugny and Lebucqui&egrave;re. In all, this division, with the
Nineteenth and Fifty-first upon their right, sustained five strong attacks in
the afternoon of this day, most of them from Vaulx-Vraumont. Eventually
Lebucqui&egrave;re was taken, the enemy breaking their way at this point
through the line of the exhausted Fifty-first Division, who had fought with
splendid resolution. This German success placed the Nineteenth Division south
of Beaumetz and at Beugny in a very serious position, as the enemy infantry got
behind the 9th Welsh Fusiliers and 6th Wiltshires, who were only saved from
total destruction by the staunch support of the 9th Welsh at Beugny, who held
on desperately until the remains of the 58th Brigade could get back to them.
These remains when the three battalions were reunited were only a few hundred
men.</p>
<p>The case of the 57th Brigade, which was fighting a hard rearguard action all
afternoon, was little better, and both the 8th Gloucesters and 10th Worcesters
were almost overwhelmed by the swarms of Germans who poured up against their
front and flank. A splendid stand was made by this brigade north-east of Velu,
in which the men of Gloucester especially distinguished themselves. Captain
Jones of A Company receiving the V.C. for his heroic resistance. Colonel Hoath
of the 10th Warwicks conducted this arduous retreat, and his own battalion
shares in the honours of a fight which was tragic in its losses, but essential
for its effect upon the fortunes of the army. Captain Gribble of this battalion
also received the V.C, his D Company falling to the last man after the best
traditions of the British army. The 5th Brigade of the Second Division, upon
the right of the Nineteenth Division, shared in the honours of this desperate
business, the 2nd Oxford and Bucks being very heavily engaged. After the
prolonged action the final line of the Nineteenth Division ran west of
Bertincourt, the movement of retreat being to the south-west. So confused had
been the fighting of the last two days that the Nineteenth Division which had
been on the right of the Fifty-first was now upon their left. Still keeping a
closely-knit line and their faces to the foe, the Third Army stretched that
night from Sailly in the south to the west of Henin and Monchy. The Fourth
Corps, which had been so badly mauled, was strengthened that evening by the
inclusion of the Forty-second Division. The towers of Bapaume in the rear
showed how far across the ravaged and reconquered land the British line had
retreated.</p>
<p>The pressure here described had been upon the left of the Fifth Corps, but
the situation upon its right flank had also been very awkward. The terrific
weight thrown upon the Ninth Division had, as will be described, driven them
farther westward than their left-hand companions of the Forty-seventh Division.
The result was a most dangerous gap which exposed the whole rear of the Third
Army. The 99th Brigade in the Equancourt district endeavoured after the fall of
Fins to fill this front, but they were not nearly numerous enough for the
purpose. The result was that the Forty-seventh Division, which moved back on
the night of March 22 from Highland Ridge to the Metz-Dessart Wood line, had to
reach out more and more upon the right in order to save the situation. In this
operation two battalions, the 4th Welsh Fusiliers Pioneers and the 23rd London,
sustained most of the attack and suffered very heavily upon March 23, while in
the preliminary fighting upon March 22 the 18th London had many losses. By the
morning of March 24, the Forty-seventh, beating off all attacks and keeping
their position in the unbroken line, had fallen back to a new position, the
142nd Brigade, which formed the rearguard, fighting hard in its retreat, and
having to brush aside those groups of Germans who had slipped in at the
rear.</p>
<p>The morning of March 24 found the German March 24. torrent still roaring
forward in full spate, though less formidable than before, since the heavier
guns were far to the rear. Their light artillery, trench-mortars, and
machine-guns were always up with the storming columns, and the latter were
relieved in a manner which showed the competence of their higher command. It
was a day of doubt and difficulty for the British, tor the pressure was
everywhere severe, and the line had frayed until it was very thin, while
officers and men had reached the last limits of human endurance. At 8:30 in the
morning the enemy was pressing hard upon the Seventeenth and Forty-seventh
Divisions in the region of Bus and Le Mesnil, where they were endeavouring to
keep in touch with the worn remains of the heroic Ninth Division on the left of
the Seventh Corps. Sailly Saillisel was still clear of the enemy, but the tide
was flowing strongly towards it. The 51st Brigade of the Seventeenth Division
occupied this village and threw out its left to the Londoners on the north of
them. Bertincourt, which had become a dangerous salient, was evacuated, and the
line now ran east of Haplincourt and Rocquigny, the three brigades of the
Seventeenth Division occupying this latter village, Barastre, and
Villers-au-Flos. On their north were two brigades of the Forty-seventh, the
remaining brigade being south of Le Transloy. North of the Forty-seventh
Division the Sixty-third Naval Division and the Second Division carried the
line on to the junction with the Fourth Corps, where the exhausted Nineteenth
Division lay across the Cambrai road, with the even more shattered Fifty-first
Division at Riencourt to the north of them. There was some very furious
fighting in front of Rocquigny about mid-day, in which the 12th Manchesters of
the Seventeenth Division, and the three battalions (18th, 19th, 20th London) of
the 141st Brigade made a very desperate resistance. The fighting was continued
until the defenders found themselves in danger of being surrounded, when they
were withdrawn. The 140th Brigade, under Colonel Dawes, also did great service
that day in holding the Germans from getting behind the line. The enemy was so
far round that there was the greatest difficulty in clearing the transport,
which was only accomplished by the fine rearguard work of the 4th Welsh
Fusiliers, aided by the 11th Motor Machine-gun Battery, and 34th Brigade
R.F.A.</p>
<p>It was, however, to the south, where the Third and Fifth Armies were
intermittently joined and vaguely interlocked, that the danger chiefly lay.
About noon, the enemy, finding the weak spot between the two armies, had forced
his way into Sailly Saillisel in considerable force, and pushed rapidly north
and west from the village. So rapid was the German advance upon the right rear
of the Fifth Corps that Rancourt and even Combles were said to have fallen. In
vain the Seventeenth Division overstretched its wing to the south, trying to
link up with the Seventh Corps. Early in the afternoon Morval and Les Boeufs
had gone, and the troops were back upon the mud-and-blood areas of 1916. For
the moment it seemed that the British line had gone, and it was hard to say
what limit might be put to this very serious advance. By midnight the enemy
were north of Bapaume, and had reached Ervillers, while in the south they had
taken Longueval, the key village of Delville Wood. It was indeed a sad relapse
to see all that the glorious dead had bought with their hearts' blood reverting
so swiftly to the enemy. In the north, however, as has already been shown in
the story of the Sixth Corps, the enemy's bolt was shot, and in the south his
swift career was soon to be slowed and held.</p>
<p>In the Favreuil, Sapignies, and Gomiecourt district, north of Bapaume, the
advance was mainly accomplished through the pressure of fresh German forces
upon the exhausted and attenuated line of the Forty-first Division, which still
struggled bravely, and in the end successfully, against overwhelming odds. In
the effort to hold a line the divisions which had been drawn out as too weak
for service turned back once more into the fray like wounded men who totter
forward to strike a feeble blow for their comrades in distress. The Sixth
Division was led in once more, and sustained fresh and terrible losses. Its
left fell back to Favreuil, exposing the right wing of the Fortieth Division.
The Twenty-fifth Division to the east of Achiet found itself also once more
overtaken by the battle. By evening the line had been built up again in this
quarter, and the dead-weary British infantry snatched a few hours of sleep
before another day of battle. The Nineteenth Division, reduced to 2000 rifles,
lay from Le Barque to Avesnes, with the Second upon their right and the
Forty-first upon their left, while the whole of this difficult retreat had been
covered by the weary but indomitable Highlanders of the Fifty-first.</p>
<p>The really serious situation was to the south of Bapaume upon the old Somme
battle-field, where the Germans had made sudden and alarming progress. Their
temporary success was due to the fact that the losses in the British lines had
contracted the ranks until it was impossible to cover the whole space or to
prevent the infiltration of the enemy between the units. The situation required
some complete and vigorous regrouping and reorganisation if complete disaster
was to be avoided. Up to this point the British Higher Command had been unable
to do much to help the two hard-pressed armies, save to supply them with the
scanty succours which were immediately available. Now, however, it interfered
with decision at the vital spot and in the vital moment. To ensure solidity and
unity, Congreve's Seventh Corps, which had been the northern unit of the Fifth
Army, became from this time onwards the southern unit of the Third Army,
passing under the command of General Byng. With them went the First, Second,
and Third Cavalry Divisions, which had been doing really splendid service in
the south. Everything north of the Somme was now Third Army. At the same time
the three fine and fresh Australian Divisions, the Third, Fourth, and Fifth,
were assembling near Doullens in readiness to strike, while the Twelfth British
Division was also hurried towards the place of danger. The future was dark and
dangerous, but there were also solid grounds for hope.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 25 the line of the Third Army, which had defined
itself more clearly during the night, ran from Curlu near the Somme, east of
Bazentin, west of Longueval, east of Martinpuich, through Ligny Thilloy,
Sapignies, Ervillers, and hence as before. The enemy, whose cavalry were well
up and in force, at once began his thrusting tactics in the southern section of
the field, and may have expected, after his advance of the day before, to find
some signs of weakening resistance. In this he was disappointed, for both the
47th Londoners in front of Contalmaison and the Second Division at Ligny
Thilloy beat off several attacks with very great loss to the assailants. The
units were much broken and mixed, but the spirit of the individuals was
excellent. The pressure continued, however, to be very great, and in the
afternoon the line was once more pushed to the westwards. There was severe
fighting between Bapaume and Sapignies, where mixed and disorganised units
still held the Germans back, but in the late afternoon three distinct gaps had
appeared in the line, one between the Seventh and Fifth Corps, one in the Fifth
Corps itself in the Pozi&egrave;res area of the Sixty-third Division, and one
between the Fifth and the Fourth Corps. Fortunately, the resistance had been so
desperate that by the time the Germans had their opportunity they were always
so bedraggled themselves that they could not take full advantage of it. The
general order of divisions in this area, counting from the south of
Contalmaison, was Seventeenth, Forty-seventh, Sixty-third, Second, upon the
morning of March 25.</p>
<p>The Seventh Corps, the previous adventures of which will be described under
the heading of the Fifth Army, had now become the right wing of the Third Army.
It had been strengthened by the advent of the Thirty-fifth Division, and this
unit now covered from west of Curlu to east of Maricourt, where it touched the
right of the Ninth Division&mdash;if the thin ranks of that gallant band can be
dignified by so imposing a title. The Highlanders covered the front to
Montauban, where they touched the First Cavalry Division, but beyond that the
enemy were pouring round their flank at Bernafoy and Mametz Woods. It was under
these trying conditions that the Twelfth Division was ordered up, about noon,
to secure the left of the Seventh Corps and entirely stopped the dangerous
gap.</p>
<p>Another had formed farther north. The Seventeenth Division, who were on the
right of the Fifth Corps, held from Mametz to Contalmaison. Thence to
Pozi&egrave;res was held by the Forty-seventh. A gap existed, however, upon
their left, between them and the Sixty-third Division, who were gradually
falling back upon Courcelette. The left of the Naval Division was also in the
air, having lost touch with the right of the Second Division who were covering
Le Sars. North of them the Nineteenth Division extended from the west of
Grevillers to the south of Bihucourt. The 57th Brigade in the north, under the
local command of Colonel Sole, fought a fine rearguard action as the enemy
tried to debouch from Grevillers. Considering how terribly mauled this brigade
had been a few days before, this was a really splendid performance of these
brave Midlanders, and was repeated by them more than once during the day. From
their left flank to the north stretched a new division, Braithwaite's
Sixty-second, which had upheld the honour of Yorkshire so gloriously at
Cambrai. Their line ran west of Sapignies and joined the Forty-second Division
at the point where they touched the Sixth Corps, east of Ervillers.</p>
<p>The front of the Sixty-second stretched from Bucquoy to Puisieux. The enemy
kept working round the right flank, and the situation there was very dangerous,
for everything to the immediate south was in a state of flux, shreds and
patches of units endeavouring to cover a considerable stretch of all-important
country. South of Puisieux there was a gap of four or five miles before one
came to British troops. Into this gap in the very nick of time came first the
4th Brigade of the Second Australian Division, and later the New Zealand
Division in driblets, which gradually spanned the vacant space, It was a very
close call for a breakthrough without opposition. Being disappointed in this
the Germans upon March 26 spent the whole afternoon in fierce attacks upon the
Sixty-second Division, but got little but hard knocks from Braithwaite's
Yorkshiremen. The 186th Brigade on the right threw back a flank to Rossignol
Wood to cover the weak side.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the enemy had made a spirited attempt to push through between the
Seventh Corps and the Fifth. With this design he attacked heavily, bending back
the thin line of the Ninth Division, who were supported by the Twenty-first
Division, numbering at this period 1500 men. At four in the afternoon the
German stormers got into Maricourt, but they were thrust out again by the
Thirty-fifth Division. They had better success farther north, where in the late
evening they got round the left flank of the Forty-seventh Division and
occupied Pozi&egrave;res. The Londoners threw out a defensive line to the north
and awaited events, but the general position between the Fifth and Fourth Corps
was serious, as the tendency was for the gap to increase, and for the Fourth
Corps to swing north-west while the other turned to the south-west. The Twelfth
Division was transferred therefore from the Seventh to the Fifth Corps, and was
given a line on the west bank of the Ancre from Albert to Hamel. This move
proved in the sequel to be a most effective one. In the evening of this day,
March 25, the line from Bray to Albert exclusive was allotted to the Seventh
Corps, which was directed to leave a covering party as long as possible on a
line from the River Somme to Montauban, in order to safeguard the retirement of
the Fifth Army. Then came the Twelfth Division covering Albert, then the
remains of the Forty-seventh and of the Second from Thiepval to Beaumont Hamel,
all moving across the Ancre. It is said that during the retreat from Moscow an
officer having asked who were the occupants of a certain sledge, was answered:
"The Royal Regiment of Dutch Guards." It is in a somewhat similar sense that
all mentions of battalions, brigades, and divisions must be taken at this stage
of the battle. The right of the Fourth Corps was threatened by an irruption of
the enemy at Pys and Irles, who threatened to get by this route round the flank
of the Sixty-second Division, but found the Twenty-fifth Division still had
vitality enough left to form a defensive flank looking south. At the same time
the Forty-second Division had been driven back west of Gomiecourt, and was out
of touch with the right of the Sixth Corps. Things were still serious and the
future dark. Where was the retreat to be stayed? Was it destined to roll back
to Amiens or possibly to Abbeville beyond it? The sky had clouded, the days
were mirk, the hanging Madonna had fallen from the cathedral of Albert, the
troops were worn to shadows. The twilight of the gods seemed to have come.</p>
<p>It was at that very moment that the first light of victory began to dawn. It
is true that the old worn divisions could hardly be said any longer to exist,
but the new forces, the Yorkshiremen of the Sixty-second in the north, the New
Zealanders and the Twelfth in the centre, and very particularly the three
Splendid divisions of Australians in the area just south of Albert, were the
strong buttresses of the dam which at last held up that raging tide. Never
should our British Imperial troops forget the debt which they owed to Australia
at that supreme hour of destiny. The very sight of those lithe, rakish
dare-devils with their reckless, aggressive bearing, or their staider
fresh-faced brethren with the red facings of New Zealand, was good for tired
eyes. There was much still to be done before an equilibrium should be reached,
but the rough outline of the permanent positions had even now, in those hours
of darkness and danger, been traced across the German path. There was but one
gap on the morning of March 26, which lay between Auchonvillers and
H&eacute;buterne, and into this the New Zealand Division and one brigade of the
Second Australians were, as already stated, hurriedly sent, the New Zealanders
supporting and eventually relieving the Second British Division, while the
Australians relieved the Nineteenth. The line was attacked, but stood firm, and
the New Zealanders actually recaptured Colincamps.</p>
<p>The chief fighting both of this day and of the next fell upon Scott's
Twelfth Division, which lay before Albert, and was occupying the western side
of the railway line. So vital was the part played by the Twelfth in this
quarter, and so strenuous their work, that a connected and more detailed
account of it would perhaps not be out of place. The 37th Brigade was in the
north-east of Mesnil and Aveluy Wood, the 36th in the centre, and the 35th on
the west bank of the Ancre, with outposts to cover the crossings at Albert and
Aveluy. The men were fresh and eager, but had only their rifles to trust to,
for they had neither wire, bombs, rifle-grenades. Very lights, or signals,
having been despatched at the shortest notice to the battlefield. Their orders
were to hold their ground at all costs, and most valiantly they obeyed it. It
is only when one sees a map of the German forces in this part of the field,
with the divisions marked upon it like flies upon fly-paper, that one
understands the odds against which these men had to contend. Nor was the
efficiency of the enemy less than his numbers. "The Germans scouted forward in
a very clever manner, making full use of the old chalk trenches," says an
observer. In the north upon the evening of March 26 the enemy crept up to
Mesnil, and after a long struggle with the 6th Queen's forced their way into
the village. Shortly after midnight, however, some of the 6th Buffs and 6th
West Kents, together with part of the Anson battalion from the Sixty-third
Division, won back the village once more, taking twelve machine-guns and a
number of prisoners. The other two brigades had not been attacked upon the
26th, but a very severe battle awaited them all upon March 27. It began by a
heavy shelling of Hamel in the morning, by which the garrison was driven out.
The Germans then attacked southwards down the railway from Hamel, but were held
up by the 6th West Kents. The pressure extended, however, to the 9th Royal
Fusiliers of the 36th Brigade upon the right of the West Kents, who had a long,
bitter struggle in which they were assisted by the 247th Field Company of the
Royal Engineers and other elements of the 188th Brigade. This brigade, being
already worn to a shadow, was withdrawn, while another shadow, the 5th Brigade,
took its place, one of its battalions, the 24th Royal Fusiliers, fighting
stoutly by the side of the West Kents. There was a time when the pressure was
so great that all touch was lost between the two brigades; but the and line was
held during the whole of the day and night of the 27th and on into the 28th. At
eleven o'clock in the morning of this day a new attack by fresh troops was made
upon the West Kents and the 7th Sussex, and the men of Kent were at one time
driven back, but with the aid of the 24th Royal Fusiliers the line was entirely
re-established. The whole episode represented forty-eight hours of continual
close combat until, upon March 29, this front was relieved by the Second
Division. Apart from the heavy casualties endured by the enemy, this gain of
time was invaluable at a crisis when every day meant a thickening of the
British line of resistance.</p>
<p>The fight upon the right wing of the 36th Brigade had been equally violent
and even more deadly. In the fight upon March 27, when the Royal West Kents and
9th Fusiliers were so hard pressed in the north, their comrades of the 5th
Berks and 7th Sussex had been very heavily engaged in the south. The Germans,
by a most determined advance, drove a wedge between the Berkshires and the
Sussex, and another between the Sussex and the Fusiliers, but in each case the
isolated bodies of men continued the desperate fight. The battle raged for a
time round the battalion headquarters of the Sussex, where Colonel Impey,
revolver in hand, turned the tide of fight like some leader of old. The losses
were terrible, but the line shook itself clear of Germans, and though they
attacked again upon the morning of March 28, they were again beaten off, and
heavily shelled as they plodded in their sullen retreat up the hillside to La
Boisselle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the 35th Brigade had also been fighting for its life to the
south. Albert had fallen to the Germans, for it was no part of the plan of
defence to hold the town itself, but the exits from it and the lines on each
side of it were jealously guarded. At 7 P.M. on March 26 the Germans were in
the town, but they had practically reached their limit. Parties had crossed the
Ancre, and there were attacked by the 7th Norfolks, who were supported in a
long fight upon the morning of the 27th by the 9th Essex and the 5th Northants
Pioneer Battalion. The line was held, partly by the aid given by the 51st
Brigade of the Seventeenth Division, who numbered just 600 men and were led by
Major Cubbon. Whilst the line was held outside Albert, the Germans in the town
had a very deadly time, being fired at at short ranges by the 78th and 79th
Brigades Royal Field Artillery. The 7th Suffolks were drawn into the infantry
fight, which became a more and more desperate affair, involving every man who
could be thrown into it, including two battalions, the 1st Artists and 10th
Bedfords from the 190th Brigade of the Sixty-third Division. These latter units
suffered very heavily from machine-gun fire before ever they reached the
firing-line. At 8 A.M. upon March 28 the Germans were still pouring men through
Albert, but were utterly unable to debouch upon the other side under the
murderous fire of the British. A single company of the 9th Essex fired 15,000
rounds, and the whole slope which faced them was dotted with the German dead.
The town of Albert formed a covered line of approach, and though the British
guns were still pounding the buildings and the eastern approaches, the Germans
were able to assemble in it during darkness and to form up unseen in great
numbers for the attack. At ten in the morning of the 28th another desperate
effort was made to get through and clear a path for all the hordes waiting
behind. The British artillery smothered one attack, but a second broke over the
7th Norfolks and nearly submerged them. Both flanks were turned, and in spite
of great work done by Captain Chalmers with his machine-guns the battalion was
nearly surrounded. The losses were terrible, but the survivors formed up again
half a mile to the west, where they were again attacked in the evening and
again exposed to heavy casualties, including their commanding officer. Few
battalions have endured more. Late that night the 10th West Yorkshires of the
Seventeenth Division came to their relief. The whole of the Twelfth Division
was now rested for a time, but they withdrew from their line in glory, for it
is no exaggeration to say that they had fought the Germans to an absolute
standstill.</p>
<p>We shall now return to March 26, a date which had been darkened by the
capture of Albert. Apart from this success upon the German side, which brought
them into a town which they had not held for years, the general line in this
quarter began to assume the same outline as in 1916 before the Somme battle, so
that H&eacute;buterne and Auchonvillers north of Albert were in British hands,
while Serre and Puisieux were once more German. The existence of the old
trenches had helped the weary army to hold this definite line, and as already
shown it had received reinforcements which greatly stiffened its resistance.
The dangerous gap which had yawned between the Fourth and Fifth Corps was now
successfully filled. In the morning of March 27 all was solid once more in this
direction. At eleven on that date, an inspiriting order was sent along the line
that the retreat was over and that the army must fight out the issue where it
stood. It is the decisive call which the British soldier loves and never fails
to obey. The line was still very attenuated in parts, however, and it was fated
to swing and sway before it reached its final stability.</p>
<p>The fighting upon the front of the Sixty-second Division at Bucquoy upon
March 27 was as heavy as on the front of the Twelfth to the south, and cost the
Germans as much, for the Lewis guns had wonderful targets upon the endless grey
waves which swept out of the east. The 5th West Ridings, east of Rossignol
Wood, were heavily engaged, the Germans bombing their way very cleverly up the
old trenches when they could no longer face the rifle-fire in the open. There
were three separate strong attacks on Bucquoy, which covered the slopes with
dead, but the persistent attempts to get round the right wing were more
dangerous. These fell chiefly on the 2/4 Yorks Light Infantry between Rossignol
Wood and H&eacute;buterne, driving this battalion in. A dangerous gap then
developed between the British and the Australians, but a strong counter-attack
of the 5th Yorkshire Light Infantry after dark, with the Australians and four
tanks co-operating, recovered nearly all the lost ground.</p>
<p>On March 28 there was again a very heavy attack upon the 1 86th Brigade. The
stormers surged right up to the muzzles of the rifles, but never beyond them.
Over 200 dead were found lying in front of one company. One isolated platoon of
the 5th West Ridings was cut off and was killed to the last man. Farther to the
right there were several determined attacks upon the 187th Brigade and the 4th
Australian Brigade, the latter being under the orders of the Sixty-second
Division. These also were repulsed in the open, but the bombing, in which the
Germans had the advantage of a superiority of bombs, was more difficult to
meet, and the 5th Yorkshire Light Infantry were driven from Rossignol Wood and
the ground which they had so splendidly captured the night before.</p>
<p>About 11 A.M. on this day the Forty-first Division had been ordered up to
man the east of Gommecourt. A brigade of this division, the 124th, co-operated
with the 8th West Yorkshires and some of the Australians in a fresh attack upon
Rossignol Wood, which failed at first, but eventually, after dark, secured the
north end of the wood, and greatly eased the local pressure. On March 29 and 30
the positions were safely held, and the attacks less dangerous. On the evening
of the latter date the Sixty-second Division was relieved by the
Thirty-seventh.</p>
<p>Whilst these events had occurred upon the front of the Sixty-second
Division, Russell's New Zealanders were holding the line to the south in their
usual workmanlike fashion. From March 26 they held up the Germans, whose main
attacks, however, were north and south of them, though March 27 saw several
local advances against the Canterburys and the Rifles. On March 30 the New
Zealanders hit back again at La Signy Farm, with good results, taking 295
prisoners. It was a smart little victory at a time when the smallest victory
was indeed precious.</p>
<p>Reverting now to the general situation upon March 27, the weak point was
north and south of the Somme to the south of Albert. Between the river and
Harbonni&egrave;re the left wing of the Fifth Army had been broken, as will be
told when we come to consider the operations in that area. The German advance
was pouring down the line of the river with the same fierce rapidity with which
it had recently thundered forward over the old Somme battlefields. Having
annihilated the local resistance on the left bank of the river, where Colonel
Horn and 400 nondescripts did all that they could, they were pushing on from
Cerisy to Corbie. General Watts of the Nineteenth Corps, whose defence was one
of the outstanding features of the whole operations, was hard put to it to
cover his left wing, so in loyal co-operation the Third Army north of the river
detached the hard-worked Cavalry Corps, who were always called upon at moments
of supreme crisis, and who never failed to answer the call. It was actually
engaged to the north of the river at the time, but disengaged itself in part,
though the enemy was holding Cerisy and Chipilly and had got a bridge across
the river which would enable them to get to the rear of General Watts' Corps.
The means by which this very dangerous German move was kept within bounds comes
within the history of the Fifth Army. Suffice it to say that the cavalry passed
over the river and that the Seventh Corps, north of the river, extended to
cover the wider front, throwing out a defensive flank along the north bank from
Sailly-le-Sec to Aubigny.</p>
<p>Along the whole line to the north the pressure was great all day upon March
27, but the attacks upon the Fourth Corps, which were particularly severe, were
repulsed with great loss at Beaumont Hamel, Bucquoy, north of Puisieux, and at
Ablainzeville. Near Bucquoy the Sixty-second Division in these two days
repelled, as already narrated, eight separate German attacks. This fighting has
to be fitted in with that recounted in the previous chapter near Ayette, in
connection with the Thirty-first Division, in order to get a complete view of
the whole German effort and the unbroken British line. Hamel was the only fresh
village to the north of Albert which was taken by the Germans that day.</p>
<p>March 28 was remarkable for the very desperate engagement upon the front of
the Sixth and Seventeenth Corps, which has been already described, and which
marked the limit of the whole German advance in the northern area. The Fourth
Corps farther south had its own share of the fighting, however, as already told
in connection with the defence of Bucquoy by the Sixty-second Division. The
line was held, however, and save for a small strip of Rossignol Wood, no gain
at all came to solace the Germans for very heavy losses.</p>
<p>All through these operations it is worthy of note that an important part was
played by reorganised bodies of men, so mixed and broken that no name can be
assigned to them. Officers stationed in the rear collected these stragglers,
and led them back into gaps of the line, where their presence was sometimes of
vital importance. A divisional general, speaking of these curious and irregular
formations, says: "There was no panic of any kind. The men of all divisions
were quite willing to halt and fight, but as the difficulty of orders reaching
them made them uncertain as to their correct action, they came back slowly and
in good order. Once they received some definite orders they fell into line and
dug themselves in at once." At one point 4000 men were collected in this
fashion.</p>
<p>In the Australian area the enemy occupied Dernancourt, but otherwise the
whole line was intact. It was still necessary, however, to keep a defensive
line thrown back along the north bank of the Somme, as the situation to the
south, especially at Marcelcave, was very dangerous. Thus, the Seventh Corps
covered this flank from Corbie to Sailly, and then ran north to Treux on the
Albert&mdash;Amiens Railway. The arrival of the cavalry to the south of the
river had spliced the weak section, so that on the morning of March 29 the
British commanders from north to south had every cause to be easier in their
minds. An inactive day was the best proof of the severity of the rebuff which
the Germans had sustained the day before, nor were matters improved from their
point of view when upon March 30 they attacked the Australians near Dernancourt
and lost some thousands of men without a yard of gain, or when the New
Zealanders countered them, with the capture of 250 prisoners and many
machine-guns.</p>
<p>This small chronicle of huge events has now brought the southern half of the
Third Army to the same date already reached in the previous chapter' by the
northern half. The narrative has by no means reached the limit of the fighting
carried on by this portion of the line, but equilibrium has roughly been
attained, and if the story be now continued it leaves too wide a gap for the
reader to cross when he has to return to the history of the Fifth Army upon the
21st of March. Therefore we shall leave the Third Third Army for the time and
only return to it when we have followed the resistance of the Fifth Army up to
the same date.</p>
<p>Before starting upon this new epic, it would be well to remind the reader of
the general bearing of the events already described, as it is very easy in
attention to detail to lose sight of the larger issues. The experience of the
Third Army then, put in its briefest form, was that the attack upon March 21
fell with terrific violence upon the two central corps, the Sixth and Fourth;
that these, after a most valiant resistance, were forced to retire; that the
strategical situation thus created caused the Seventeenth Corps in the north
and the Fifth Corps in the south to fall back, and. that both of them were then
pressed by the enemy; that for six days the army fell slowly back, fighting
continual rearguard actions against superior numbers; that this movement
involved only a short retreat in the north, but a longer one in the south,
until in the Albert region it reached its maximum; that finally the Germans
made a determined effort upon March 28 to break the supple and resilient line
which had always faced them, and that this attempt, most gallantly urged,
involved the Corps in the north as well as the whole line of the Third Army.
The result of this great battle was a bloody defeat for the Germans, especially
in the northern sector, where they made hardly any gain of ground and lost such
vast numbers of men that their whole enterprise was brought to a complete
standstill and was never again resumed in that quarter.</p>
<p>The losses of the Third Army during that week of desperate fighting when, in
spite of the heroic efforts of the Medical Corps, the wounded had frequently to
be abandoned, and when it was often impossible to get the guns away intact,
were very severe. Many divisions which numbered their 9000 infantry upon March
21 could not put 1500 in the line upon March 28. These losses were not,
however, so great as they might appear, since the constant movement of troops,
carried on very often in pitch darkness, made it impossible to keep the men
together. An official estimate taken at the time and subject to subsequent
revision put the loss of guns at 206, only 23 of which were above the 6-inch
calibre. Forty three others were destroyed. The casualties in the Third Army
during the period under review might be placed approximately at 70,000, divided
into 10,000 killed, 25,000 missing, and 35,000 wounded. The heaviest losses
were in the Fifty-ninth Division, which gave 5765 as its appalling total, but
the Sixth Division was little behind it, and the Forty-second, Forty-seventh,
and Fifty-first were all over 4000. The Thirty-fifth Division had also a most
honourable record, enduring very heavy losses in which the numbers of missing
were comparatively small. Its work, however, was chiefly done at a later date
than that which closes this chapter. In the estimate of losses there has to be
included practically the whole personnel of the devoted battalions who held the
forward line upon the first day of the German attack. In connection with the
large number of stragglers, who were afterwards gathered together and showed by
their conduct that they had no want of stomach for the fight, it is to be
remembered that the men had been accustomed to the narrow routine of trench
operations, that most of them had no idea of open warfare, and that when they
found themselves amidst swift evolutions over difficult country, carried on
frequently in darkness, it was very natural that they should lose their units
and join the throng who wandered down the main roads and were eventually
rounded up and formed into formations at the river crossings or other places
where they could be headed off. Among the casualties were many senior officers,
including General Bailey of the 142nd Brigade.</p>

<h2><a id="chap4" name="chap4">IV. THE SECOND BATTLE OF THE SOMME</a><br>
Attack upon the Fifth Army, March 2</h2>
<p class="chaphead">The Fifth Army front&mdash;The story of a Redoubt &mdash;
Attack upon Congreve's Seventh Corps&mdash;Upon Watts' Nineteenth
Corps&mdash;Upon Maxse's Eighteenth Corps&mdash;Upon Butler's Third
Corps&mdash;Terrific pressure&mdash;Beginning of the Retreat&mdash;Losses of
Guns</p>
<p class="first">IN dealing with the German attack upon the Fifth Army, the
first point which should be emphasised is, that heavy as the fighting was in
the north, still it was this southern advance which was the main one. The
official account of the disposition of the German forces brings this fact out
very clearly. From the Sens&eacute;e River to the Bapaume-Cambrai road they are
stated to have had nine divisions in line and eight in close reserve, covering
a front of nine miles. In the eight miles from Cambrai road to La Vacquerie
they had four divisions. In the southern area from La Vacquerie down to La
F&egrave;re they had twenty-three divisions in the line and seventeen in
reserve, covering a front of over forty miles. This front was defended by
eleven British divisions, with three divisions of infantry and three of cavalry
in reserve. So far as infantry was concerned the odds were 40 to 14, while the
German guns numbered about 3500 to 1300 on the British line. These odds were
serious enough if directed equally along the whole area, but when thrown in on
special sectors they became more crushing. To add to the total picture of
German strength, it should be added that twenty-five fresh divisions were
thrown into the fight during the first week, nine upon Scarpe front, three
between the Ancre and the Somme, seven between the Somme and Montdidier, and
six between Montdidier and the Oise. Against these have to be set British
reinforcements, and the influx of French from the south. It was only on the
first five days of battle that the odds were so overpoweringly with the
Germans.</p>
<p>In this chapter we shall endeavour to gain a superficial view of the general
course of events upon the whole front of the Fifth Army upon the fateful March
21. We shall then be in a position to appreciate the situation as it was in the
evening and to understand those decisions on the part of General Gough and his
subordinates which influenced the subsequent operations.</p>
<p>The front of the Fifth Army extended from its junction with the Third Army
in the neighbourhood of La Vacquerie to Barisis, a village some miles south of
the Oise, the total frontage being nearly forty miles. This was occupied by
four corps. The northern was the Seventh, under General Congreve, a well-known
soldier, whose V.C. and shattered arm proclaimed his past services to the
Empire. This corps covered the southern part of the dangerous Cambrai salient
and extended to the region of Ronssoy. From this point to Maissemy the line was
held by General Watts with the Nineteenth Corps. Upon his right, extending as
far as north of Essigny, was General Maxse with the Eighteenth Corps. From
thence to Barisis lay, the Third Corps under General Butler. All four were
soldiers of wide experience, their leader, General Gough, had never failed in
any task to which he had laid his hand, and the troops in the line comprised
some of the flower of the British army, so that in spite of all disparity of
numbers there was a reasonable hope for success. Arrangements had been made by
which the French or British could send lateral help to each other; but it must
be admitted that the liaison work proved to be defective, and that the succours
were slower in arriving, and less equipped for immediate action, than had been
expected.</p>
<p>The fortifications along the front of the Fifth Army were of various degrees
of strength, depending upon the nature of the ground and upon the time that it
had been in British possession, the north being stronger than the south. The
Oise, which had been looked upon as an obstacle, and the presence of which had
seemed to justify the extraordinarily long sector held by the Third Corps, had
to some extent dried up and had ceased to be a real protection. In the main,
the defences consisted of a forward line, a chain of small redoubts, each with
four machine-guns and all connected by posts; a battle-line which was strongly
wired and lay about 3000 yards behind the forward line; and a rear zone, the
fortifications of which were not complete. If anything were wanting in the
depth of the defences it has to be remembered that we are speaking of a vast
tract of country, and that to dig a serviceable trench from London, we will
say, to Guildford, furnishing it with sandbags and wire, is a mighty task.
There were no enslaved populations who could be turned on to such work. For
months before the attack the troops, aided by the cavalry and by several
special entrenching battalions, were digging incessantly. Indeed, the remark
has been made that their military efficiency was impaired by the constant navvy
work upon which they were employed. There is no room for criticism upon this
point, for everything possible was done, even in that southern sector which had
only been a few weeks in British possession.</p>
<p>Before beginning to follow the history of March 21, it would be well to
describe the position and number of the reserves, as the course of events
depended very much upon this factor. Many experienced soldiers were of opinion
that if they had been appreciably more numerous, and considerably nearer the
line, the positions could have been made good. The three infantry divisions in
question were the Thirty-ninth, which was immediately behind the Seventh Corps,
the Twentieth, which was in the neighbourhood of Ham, and was allotted to the
Eighteenth Corps, and the Fiftieth, which was in general army reserve, and
about seven hours' march from the line. The First Cavalry Division was in the
rear of the Nineteenth Corps, while the Second Cavalry Division was on the
right behind the Third Corps. The Third Cavalry Division was in billets upon
the Somme, and it also was sent to the help of the Third Corps. Besides these
troops the nearest supports were at a distance of at least three days' journey,
and consisted of a single unit, the Eighth Division.</p>
<p>The German preparations for the attack had not been unobserved and it was
fully expected upon the morning of the battle, but what was not either expected
or desired was the ground mist, which seems to have been heavier in the
southern than in the northern portion of the line. So dense was it that during
the critical hours when the Germans were pouring across No Man's Land it was
not possible to see for more than twenty yards, and the whole scheme of the
forward defence, depending as it did upon machine-guns, placed in depth and
sweeping every approach, was completely neutralised by this freak of nature,
which could not have been anticipated, for it was the first time such a thing
had occurred for two months. Apart from the machine-guns, a number of isolated
field-guns had been sown here and there along the front, where they had lurked
in silence for many weeks waiting for their time to come. These also were
rendered useless by the weather, and had no protection from the German advance,
which overran and submerged them.</p>
<p>The devastating bombardment broke out along the line about five o'clock, and
shortly after ten it was known that the German infantry had advanced and had
invaded the whole of the forward zone, taking a few of the redoubts, but in
most cases simply passing them in the fog, and pushing on to the main British
line. As it is impossible to give the experiences of each redoubt in detail,
the story of one may be told as being fairly typical of the rest. This
particular one is chosen because some facts are available, whereas in most of
them a deadly silence, more eloquent than words, covers their fate. The Enghien
redoubt was held by Colonel Wetherall with a company of the 2/4 Oxford and
Bucks Light Infantry upon the front of the Sixty-first Division. The redoubt
formed the battalion headquarters, and was connected to brigade headquarters by
a cable buried eight feet deep. In front were two companies of the battalion in
the outpost line; behind was the fourth company ready for counter-attack. Early
in the morning heavy trench-mortar fire was raining bombs upon the redoubt, and
the wire was flying in all directions. At 6 the redoubt was so full of gas that
even the masks could not hold it out, so the men were ordered below and put up
gas blankets to fend it off. This could be safely done, as when gas is so thick
it is not possible for the stormers to advance. At 6:15, what with fog and gas
and blurred respirators, it was hardly possible to see anything at all. At 7:30
the gas cleared and there was a shower of high explosive shells with shattering
effect. At 9:30 the barrage lifted and the garrison rushed up from their
shelters and manned their posts, but the fog rolled white and thick across
their vision. The cloud banked right up to their wire, while from behind it
came all the noises of the pit. So nerve-shaking was the effect that some of
the outlying men came creeping into the redoubt for human company. At 9.40 the
whizzing of bullets all around showed that the infantry was on the move. The
garrison fired back into the mist, whence came vague shoutings and tramplings.
A request was cabled back for a protective barrage, but the inadequate reply
showed that the British guns had suffered in the shelling. Suddenly the mist
darkened at one point; it broke into running figures, and a wave of men rushed
forward, scrambled through the broken wire, and clambered into the redoubt. The
Oxfords rushed across and bombed them back into the mist again. There was a
pause, during which the attack was reorganised, and then at 11 o'clock the
German stormers poured suddenly in from three sides at once. The garrison stood
to it stoutly and drove them out, leaving many bodies on the broken wire. The
fort was now entirely surrounded, and there was a fresh attack from the rear
which added fifty or sixty more to the German losses. At 11:45 there was some
lifting of the fog, and Colonel Wetherall endeavoured to get across to the
village, 300 yards behind him, to see if help could be obtained. He found it
deserted. Stealing back to his fort he was covered suddenly by German rifles,
was dragged away as a prisoner, but finally, late in the evening, escaped and
rejoined the main body of his own battalion. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Cunningham
had taken over the defence of Enghien redoubt, assisted by Lieutenant Richards
with the machine-guns. Hour after hour fresh attacks were repelled, but showers
of bombs fell in the confined space, and the garrison were continually thinned
out. Despairing messages&mdash;"What shall we do? What shall we do?"&mdash;were
sent back over the cable, but nothing could be done, for these outliers are the
<i>enfants perdus</i> of the army, marked from the first for destruction.
Finally, at 4:30, the great deep all around them sent one heavy wave to
submerge them, and the cable was for ever silent.</p>
<p>Such is the typical history of a redoubt. Some succumbed more readily, some
survived until the afternoon of the next day; but the difference may sometimes
have depended upon the various degrees of severity of attack, which was by no
means the same upon all sectors. The total effect was the complete destruction
of the eleven gallant battalions which held the advanced line of the Fifth
Army, and the loss of all material therein. One can but hope that the enemy
paid a full price. Occasionally a sudden rise of the mist gave the defence a
splendid opening for their machine-guns. On one occasion such a chance exposed
a German officer standing with a large map in his hand within thirty yards of
the fort, his company awaiting his directions beside him. Few of them
escaped.</p>
<p>We shall now follow the line of the Fifth Army from the north. The Seventh
Corps upon the left consisted of the Ninth (Tudor), the Twenty-first
(Campbell), and the Sixteenth (Hull) Divisions in the order named, and it
carried the line down as far as Ronssoy, where it joined on to Watts'
Nineteenth Corps. The Ninth Division had two brigades in the line, and all the
battalions both of the Twenty-sixth and of the South Africans were in the
forward zone and exposed to the usual devastating losses. Their front joined
that of the Forty-seventh Division at Fifteen Ravine in the north, and the
Twenty-first at Chapel Hill in the south. About eleven o'clock the main advance
of the Germans struck up against this front. There was no action upon the left
between Gauche Wood and the canal, though the bombardment was exceedingly
heavy. On the right in the neighbourhood of Gauche Wood the fighting was very
severe all day, and the stormers were able to make little progress, although
they attacked again and again with the utmost resolution. This attack fell
mainly upon the South African Brigade, who held on with the same firm courage
which they had shown at Delville Wood, and proved once more that there are no
better soldiers in all the vast army of the Empire. It was only at this point,
however, near the junction with the Twenty-first Division that the Ninth
Division was attacked, for the German infantry was crushed by the artillery
fire upon the left in front of Gonnelieu, so that the total losses of the Ninth
upon this murderous day were probably less than those of other divisions in the
Fifth Army. Gauche Wood was continually attacked, but the Quentin redoubt to
the immediate north of it was left alone during the whole day. It was the 2nd
or Natal South African regiment which held the extreme front, and after a very
fine resistance they were driven through the wood, until at 11:30 the Germans
held it all, but the Africans still clung to the system of Chapel trenches to
the immediate west and south of it. To this they held all day, being much
helped by a local rise in the mist about eleven, which enabled the guns in
Quentin redoubt to see their targets in the south. Finally, the Germans were
compelled to dig in in Gauche Wood, and give up the attempt to get farther. No
other point was gained upon the Ninth Divisional front.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the enemy had pressed their attack with great violence upon the
immediate right, where it fell with special strength upon the 2nd Lincolns of
the Twenty-first Division. At 12 they were well behind the right rear of the
Africans, who were compelled to throw back a flank. The Lincolns held on
splendidly, however, and the danger was arrested. At 3:30 a new concentration
of the enemy developed in front of Vaucelette Farm, and was heavily shelled by
the British guns. At 5 o'clock the fight was very desperate upon Chapel Hill on
the southern limit of the South African area, where the Lincolns were still
holding out but were being gradually pressed back. The 4th South African
Regiment (South African Scots) was therefore ordered to counter-attack in this
direction, which was done with great dash, the position upon Chapel Hill being
re-established. Such was the general situation when at 8:15 orders were issued
for the withdrawal of all units to the rear zone. This was done during the
night, the general line of retirement being towards Sorel and Heudicourt, while
the Scottish Brigade kept position upon the left. The order to retire came as a
complete surprise, as all was well upon the immediate front, but the reason
given was the penetration of the line at other points.</p>
<p>Upon the right of the Scots and South Africans of the Ninth Division the
line was held by Campbell's Twenty-first Division, consisting of the Leicester
Brigade and two brigades of North Country troops, all of them the veterans of
many battles. They covered the ground from south of Gauche Wood in the north to
Epehy in the south. Two brigades were in the line, the 62nd in the north and
the 110th in the south, and were exposed all day to a very severe attack which
they held up with great steadiness and resolution. Heudicourt, Peizi&egrave;re,
and Epehy were the scenes of particularly severe fighting. In the evening these
places, and the whole line through Quentin Ridge and east of Gouzeaucourt, were
still firmly held by the defenders. It may truly be said that along the whole
fifty-mile front of battle there was no point where the enemy met with a more
unyielding resistance than in the area of the Twenty-first Division. During the
long day three German divisions essayed the task of forcing Epehy and
overcoming the defence of Chapel Hill, but as the night drew in all three lay
exhausted in front of their objectives, and there would certainly have been no
British retirement had it not been for the movements in the other sections of
the line. Only at one seventh post had the enemy made any lodgment, namely at
Vaucelette Farm, and here he could have been thrown out by a counter-attack had
the general situation permitted it. The Leicesters and the Northumberland
Fusiliers upheld the fame of their historic regiments on this day of battle,
but two of the outstanding exploits in the fight lie to the credit of the
Lincolns, who kept an iron grip upon Chapel Hill, and to the 15th Durhams, who
made a dashing counter-attack which swept back the German advance when it tried
to penetrate between Epehy and Chapel Hill. The village of Peizi&egrave;re was
held by the 7th Leicesters of the 110th Brigade, who fought as this brigade has
always fought and held the Germans out. Once with the help of flame-throwers
they gained a lodgment among the houses, but the brave Midlanders came back to
it and threw them out once more. It was a party of this same Leicester regiment
which held the farm of Vaucelette, and fought it out to the very last man
before they suffered it to pass from their keeping.</p>
<p>The fighting upon Chapel Hill was particularly severe, and was the more
important as this eminence, lying almost upon the divisional boundary,
enfiladed the Ninth Division to the north. There was a trench in front of the
hill, called Cavalry Trench, and a farm behind called Revelon Farm, and the
battle swung and swayed all day, sometimes the British holding all the ground,
and sometimes being pushed back as far as the farm. The 1st Lincolns gained
great honour that day, but they could not have held the hill were it not for
the co-operation of the South Africans, who twice helped to retake it when it
had been temporarily lost. The 11th Royal Scots from the Ninth Division Reserve
Brigade struck in also with effect when the enemy filtered round the north edge
of the hill and worked to the rear of it. They had got as far as Genin Copse
when the Royal Scots attacked and hunted them back once more. The weak point of
the Twenty-first Division lay upon their right where they had to throw out a
defensive flank 3000 yards deep. They had not troops enough to cover this
ground, and it was only the splendid work of the batteries of the 94th Brigade
R.F.A. which prevented a disaster.</p>
<p>The Sixteenth Irish Division (Hull) lay upon the right of the Twenty-first
Division, carrying the line to the south of Ronssoy. This division had two
brigades in the line, the 48th to the left and the 49th to the right, and it
appears to have sustained an attack which was of a peculiarly crushing nature.
It cannot be denied that the wretched parochial politics which tear Ireland in
two, and which are urged with such Celtic extravagance of language, cannot have
a steadying effect upon national troops, but none the less every soldier will
admit that the men who carried Guillemont and breasted the slope of the
Messines Ridge have proved themselves to be capable of rising to the highest
exercise of military virtue. If, therefore, they gave way upon this occasion
while others stood, the reason is to be sought rather in the extra severity of
the attack, which had the same crushing effect upon other divisions both in the
north and in the south of the line. All these brigades were desperately engaged
during the day, as was the 1 1 6th Brigade of the Thirty-ninth Division which
came to the help of the Irish, while the other two brigades of this supporting
division endeavoured to strengthen the line of defence in the rear zone with a
switch line from Saulcourt to Tincourt Wood. On the right the attack was too
severe to be withstood, and not only the advance line but the battle position
also was deeply penetrated, the Germans pouring in a torrent down the Catelet
valley and occupying Ronssoy and Lempire, by which they turned the flanks both
of the Twenty-first in the north and of the Sixty-sixth Division in the south.
Especially fierce was the resistance offered by the 48th Brigade in the north,
some units of which were swung round until they found themselves sharing with
the Twenty-first Division in the defence of Epehy. The 2nd Munsters lived up to
their high reputation during a long day of hard fighting, and were for the
third or fourth time in the war practically destroyed. Colonel Ireland was hit
about 10:30 in the morning, and one company, which counter-attacked near
Malassise Farm, was annihilated in the effort; but the survivors of the
battalion were undismayed, and under Major Hartigan they continued to oppose
every effort of the stormers. One of the features of the battle in this area
was the fight maintained all day by C Company scattered in little parties over
Ridge Reserve and Tetard Wood. Lieutenant Whelan was the soul of this fine
defence, contesting every bay of his trench, and continuing to rally and lead
his dwindling band until noon of the next day. A road ran past this position,
and it was all-important for the enemy to move their artillery down it in order
to press the retreat; but the Irishmen shot down the horse teams as they came
up until the passage was blocked with their bodies. Finally, all the scattered
bands rallied near Epehy village where, under Captain Chandler, who was killed
in the contest, they fought to the last, until in the late evening their
cartridges gave out, and the gallant Hartigan, with the headquarter staff of
the battalion, was overwhelmed. Lieutenant Whelan, meanwhile, held his post
near Epehy until noon of March 22, when he and his men fired their last round
and threw their last bomb before surrender. The defence of Malassise Farm by
Lieutenant Kidd and his men was also a glorious bit of fighting to the last man
and the last cartridge.</p>
<p>The general situation upon the front of the Seventh Corps on the night of
March 21 was that the Sixteenth Division, reinforced by the 116th Brigade, held
the main battle positions, save on the extreme right, as far north as St.
Emilie. Thence the line followed approximately the railway round and east of
Epehy, in the region of the Twenty-first Division. East of Chapel Hill and
Chapel Crossing it entered the holding of the Ninth Division, and passed west
of Gauche Wood, through Quentin redoubt and so to the original line. Behind
this indented position the 118th and 117th Brigades with the Sappers and
Pioneers of the Thirty-ninth Division were hard at work upon the switch line,
which should form a cover for retreat or a basis for reorganisation.</p>
<p>Upon the right of the Seventh Corps lay Watts' Nineteenth Corps, which had
two divisions in the line, the Sixty-sixth Lancashire Territorial Division
(Malcolm) in the north, and the Twenty-fourth Division (Daly) in the south.
They covered a front from south of Ronssoy to south of Maissemy. The Lancashire
Division, the same which behaved so splendidly in the mud battle of
Broodseinde, had all three brigades in the front, covering 4000 yards, and were
exposed all day to a most terrific assault. From the north they were in the
order 197th, 199th, 198th. To the south of them an even more strenuous attack
was launched upon the Twenty-fourth Division, which had two brigades in the
line. These were the 17th upon the left and the 72nd upon the right, with the
1st North Staffords, 8th West Kents, 1st Rifle Brigade, and 8th Queen's in
front. About 11 o'clock the news came that the enemy was pushing through at the
point of junction with the Eighteenth Corps upon the right, where there seems
to have been a gap of some hundreds of yards between divisions, and later that
they had penetrated into the village of Hargicourt in the rear of the
Sixty-sixth Division. There was heavy fighting all day, and by evening the
whole forward zone held by the 2/3 Lanes Fusiliers, East Lancashires, and
Manchesters had passed into the hands of the enemy. Colonel Stokes-Roberts of
the former battalion being among the casualties. The twelve redoubts which
constituted the main defences of the. battle zone held out stoutly all day, all
three brigades fighting with great valour. The Germans were continually pushing
in, however, upon the right of the Twenty-fourth Division and enlarging their
gains in that direction, so that the First Cavalry Division was called up, and
the Pioneer Battalion of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade was thrown in on the right of
the Sixty-sixth Division near Roisel to form a defensive flank. By 1 o'clock
the battle zone of the Twenty-fourth Division was seriously compromised. The
72nd Brigade upon the right had been turned and the village of Maissemy had
been taken by the Germans. Stone's 17th Brigade Corps held a tight grip,
however, upon the hamlet of Le Verguier, and though many assaults were made
upon it the place remained untaken in the evening. In the area of the
Sixty-sixth Division the enemy was still gaining ground, however, and they had
pushed on from Hargicourt to Templeux, where a counter-attack by the 6th
Lancashire Fusiliers held them for a time. The fighting continued to be very
bitter until late in the evening, for though the Germans had infiltrated all
the ground between the redoubts, they were unable to overcome their resistance,
or to take possession of their gains. At 10:15 the order from General Watts was
that there should be no retreat, and that however great the odds against
them&mdash;and it was manifest that they were indeed very great&mdash;the two
divisions should prepare for a fight to a finish. Meanwhile, the Fiftieth
Division (Stockley) in army reserve had been ordered, after a march of seven
hours, to support the line of the Nineteenth Corps, taking up a position in the
rear from the Omignon River to the Cologne River, upon a front which had been
partly wired. With the early morning of March 22 there came a renewed German
attack which forced back the left of the Sixty-sixth, who were always much
handicapped by the deep incursion the enemy had made into the area of the
Sixteenth Division to the north, which continually endangered their flank and
even their rear.</p>
<p>The battle was soon general along the whole front, and everywhere the
resistance was most desperate, though the troops were gradually pressed back by
the ever-increasing weight of the attack as Hindenburg's legions came rolling
in from the east. Many a bitter curse went up that day from overwrought men
against the perjured traitors on the Russian front, who to ease their own
burden had thrown a double weight upon those who had helped and trusted them.
At 11:30 in the morning the post of Le Verguier, which had been held so long
and so gallantly by the 8th West Surreys, was at last carried by storm and its
brave garrison destroyed or taken, though Colonel Peirs, who had been the soul
of this defence, dashed out, revolver in hand, at this last moment, and got
away in the mist. The whole line of the Twenty-fourth Division was shaken by
the gap thus created. The pressure was very great also at Roisel, and the 151st
Brigade from the Fiftieth Division had to be hurried up in order to hold back
the advance down the valley of the Cologne, which would have turned the right
flank of the Lancashire men to the north. The 9th Sussex was heavily engaged in
this quarter and suffered severely. About noon a valiant attempt was also made
by some tanks and dismounted troopers . to turn the tide by recapturing the
village of Hervilly, which had some temporary success. The German penetration
had been too deep, however, and there was very pressing danger of isolation
unless the corps fell back. This they did in the late afternoon and evening,
passing through the ranks of the Fiftieth Division behind them. "They were
nearly all gassed and dead weary," said one who observed them as they passed.
The 11th Hussars and 19th Entrenching Battalion most gallantly covered the
retreat. The enemy were close at their heels, however, in great force and most
aggressive mood, as the Fiftieth Division soon discovered. This unit will be
remembered as the famous Yorkshire Territorial division who helped to turn the
tide at the second battle of Ypres, and have shown their worth upon many
fields; but on this occasion the odds were too heavy, though they held the
enemy for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>The lower half of the line between the Omignon and the Cologne rivers was
held by Riddell's 149th Brigade of Northumberland Fusiliers, while the northern
half was held by Rees' 150th Brigade of Yorkshiremen. Against this thin wall
dashed the full tide of the German advance as it swept on in the wake of the
Nineteenth Corps. It was a long and hard fight in which the enemy had heavy
losses, especially in front of Poeuilly, where considerable sheets of wire lay
in front of the position of the 6th Northumberland Fusiliers. It was a most
gallant affair&mdash;gallant on both sides. Their Colonel, Robinson, laid out
his machine-guns in the long grass upon each side of this wire and enfiladed
the German line with most murderous results. In the south the 4th
Northumberland Fusiliers were attacked in front and on the right flank, and the
pressure was so great that they had to abandon Caulaincourt, which was then
recaptured and again abandoned by the 6th Northumberland Fusiliers from the
supporting line. The enemy, with his usual wile, telephoned from the mausoleum,
a central building, that reinforcements be sent to that point. Upon asking the
name of the officer and getting no reply, General Riddell, in local command,
turned on five batteries of 18-pounders and blew the mausoleum to pieces. At
Poeuilly also there had been two successful counter-attacks, but the enemy was
swarming round the southern flank in great numbers, and the river, which is not
more formidable than an average South of England trout stream, was of little
use as a protection. An important point named Nobescourt Farm, lying near the
junction of brigades, had fallen into the hands of the enemy, and the village
of Poeuilly was also taken. By evening the Fiftieth Division had done its work,
however, as it had held up the pursuit and enabled the Nineteenth Corps to
reach the line of the Somme without severe pressure. That night they received
orders to withdraw, which were carried out in the morning of March 23, Martin's
149th Brigade in the south making a show of fighting in order to cover the
movements of their companions in the north who were moving over a perfectly
flat plain from Mons to Brie. Finally, General Riddell destroyed Tertry bridge
and dropped back to St. Christ. During all these operations the German infantry
were moving slowly forward in successive lines of skirmishers, about a thousand
yards from the British, who retired in leisurely fashion, continually turning
and holding them up, so that the whole spectacle was exactly that of a
well-ordered field-day. When the main body had reached the bridges, a single
company of the 10th Northumberland Fusiliers lay out in the higher ground,
under the leadership of Captain Proctor, who received the D.S.O. for his able
conduct of the operation. This company held up a brigade for two hours, and
then, their comrades being safely across, they withdrew in their turn, leaving
half their number behind them. Every one being across, both the St. Christ and
Brie bridges were blown up. The latter was a brand-new construction and was in
charge of an American officer of engineers who distinguished himself by his
cool courage, starting out alone, and bringing across the river a train full of
ammunition which lay upon the farther side. The Twenty-fourth Division had
crossed at Falvy, the rearguard action being fought by the depleted battalions
of the 72nd Brigade. Colonel Pope of the 1st North Staffords, Colonel Charlton
of the 4th Yorks, and Colonel Le Fleming of the 9th East Surreys were among
those who had fallen.</p>
<p>The Nineteenth Corps was now covering a total front of 20,000 yards along
the western bank of the stream, which is shallow and marshy in these reaches.
Their line was from Rouy-le-Crane in the south to near Peronne, with some small
outposts to the east of the river. The Eighth Division (Heneker) had come up on
the morning of March 23, and occupied the southern end of the line, with the
remains of the Twenty-fourth, the Sixty-sixth, and the Fiftieth extending to
the north. There we shall leave them while we return to the history of the
front line upon March 21.</p>
<p>On the right of the Nineteenth Corps was Maxse's Eighteenth Corps covering
the ground from the Omignon valley to a point just west of St. Quentin, with
three divisions in the line. These were the Sixty-first on the left, the
Thirtieth in the centre, and the Thirty-sixth in the south. The Sixty-first
Division, under General Colin Mackenzie, was one of those fine second-line
Territorial units which have done so well in the later stages of the war. All
three brigades were in the line, the 183rd Brigade of Scottish troops in the
north, the 184th in the centre, and the 182nd in the south, both of the last
being from the South Midlands. The 2/4th Oxfords, 2/5th Gordons, and 2/8th
Worcesters were the devoted battalions which held the forward line, and so
fierce was their defence that the battle-line was able to maintain itself along
the whole divisional front, in spite of very valiant efforts upon the part of
the German stormers, who showed absolute contempt of death in their efforts to
cut the wire at those points where their artillery had failed to do so.</p>
<p>The story of the Enghien redoubt and its devoted defence has already been
told, but belongs to the record of this division. The battle zone ran in the
main along the eastern edge of the Bois d'Holnon, and this was desperately
defended from morning to night. In the afternoon the high ground south of
Maissery, in the left rear of the division and outside their area, had been
captured, and the 2/4th Berkshires endeavoured to help the Twenty-fourth
Division in their counter-attack. The Berkshires lost heavily in this venture,
and their gallant Colonel, Dimmer, who had won the V.C. in the early days of
the war, was shot through the head leading his men on horseback to the very lip
of a trench full of Germans. Horse and groom fell before the same volley. The
Sixty-first resumed its line after this action in the north, and it maintained
it intact until evening, the three divisions of the German attack being
practically held up by the three heroic battalions in the front line, so that
the full weight of attack never reached the main line. It was as solidly
established in the evening as in the morning. The position of the enemy on
their left rear had become more and more menacing, as after taking Maissemy
they had pressed on to Villescholes. This led to dangerous attacks from the
north on the early morning of March 22, in the course of which the 183rd
Brigade had to fight desperately to preserve the flank of the division. The
weight of this fighting fell chiefly upon the 8th Argyll and Sutherlands, who
counter-attacked most valiantly, aided by the remains of the gallant 2/4
Berkshires, who had suffered so severely the day before. Colonel M'Alpine
Downie of the Argylls was wounded, and died next day. Even when the enemy had
got as far westward as Vermand, the Sixty-first Division was still rooted to
its ground, and the Highlanders on the left flank recovered by a spirited
advance nine guns which had been overrun by the German advance between Maissemy
and Villescholes. The 9th Royal Scots extended their line to the westward, and
facing north presented an unbroken front to the constant hordes of Germans who
were moving down the northern slopes of the Omignon valley in the direction of
Caulaincourt. It was not until late in the afternoon of March 22 that the
Sixty-first Division retired, still fighting, to a prepared position north of
Vaux.</p>
<p>Next to the Sixty-first Division was the Thirtieth under General Williams.
This division had two brigades&mdash;the 21st (Goodman) and the 90th (Poyntz)
&mdash; in the line, the latter officer being known to all sportsmen as the
famous Somerset batsman. The front of 4000 yards was from the immediate west of
St. Quentin to the Somme, and included two notable strong points, Manchester
Hill and the &Eacute;pine du Dallon. The 89th Brigade under General Stanley was
in the immediate rear. It was not used as a unit during the day, but the three
fine battalions of the King's Liverpool Regiment, the 17th, 18th, and 19th,
were dispersed in the evening to reinforce three separate units.</p>
<p>The fighting along the front of the Thirtieth Division was of a very
desperate character. The forward battalions were the 2nd Wilts and the 16th
Manchesters. Rushing through the gaps in their line of defence, the Germans
flung themselves upon the battle zone, where after long fighting which lasted
into the afternoon they gained possession of the two posts already mentioned,
and worked into the main battle-line at Savy. Both brigades lost very heavily
during these attacks, but the addition of the 18th and 19th King's from
Stanley's brigade helped them to carry on under most trying conditions. Both
these reinforcing battalions came in for severe fighting in the evening, and
the 18th King's, which joined in a counter-attack by the 21st Brigade, was
particularly hard hit, while the 19th had hardly an officer left, the colonel
falling at the head of his men. As a final result of the day's battle both the
brigades were somewhat driven in upon the front, but each held its . line and
was ready to renew the battle next morning. The 2nd Bedfords particularly
distinguished themselves during this day of incessant fighting, making no less
than six successful counter-attacks in order to clear their sector when it was
partly occupied by the Germans. Up to 4 o'clock in the afternoon of March 22
the Thirtieth were still firm in their positions, and it was only the general
situation of the Army which finally compelled them to abandon them. They
dropped back upon the general line of Ham, where the three scattered battalions
of the 89th Brigade had been ordered to form one unit once more. Of the
Manchester men in the front rank upon the day of battle hardly a man ever got
away, and their splendid Colonel Elstob lay dead with the greater part of his
battalion around him. He had said: "The Manchesters will defend Manchester Hill
to the last," and he lived and died true to his word. A superior officer
reporting upon this episode said: "At about 11 o'clock Colonel Elstob informed
me that the Germans had broken through and were swarming round the redoubt. At
about 2 P.M. he said that most of his men were killed or wounded, including
himself; that they were all getting dead beat, that the Germans had got into
the redoubt and hand-to-hand fighting was going on. He was still quite cheery.
At 3:30 he was spoken to on the telephone and said very few were left and that
the end was nearly come. After that no further answer could be got."</p>
<p>On the right of the Thirtieth Lancashire Division was the Thirty-sixth
Ulster Division under the command of General Nugent, one of the many good
soldiers who were trained by South Africa for this greater ordeal. That
scrambling and difficult campaign has, though its lessons were most imperfectly
apprehended, proved to be an invaluable preparation for the leaders in the
world's war of the future. The Ulster division had all three brigades in the
line, the 109th (Ricardo) to the north, the 107th (Witteycombe) in the centre,
and the 108th (Griffiths) in the south. The three outlying battalions were the
12th and 15th Irish Rifles and the 2nd Inniskilling Fusiliers, which suffered
the common fate of all who held that post of danger. Not a man returned, save a
few of the Irish Rifles, who swam down the canal that night.</p>
<p>The front held by the Ulstermen was from the Somme on the left to the
neighbourhood of Urvillers Battle on the right, a distance of 6000 yards. Three
German divisions attacked upon this frontage, but the edge of their onslaught
was blunted by the splendid resistance of the three doomed battalions in the
van. None the less, it surged with great violence all along the edge of the
battle zone, but it was everywhere held save only at the hamlet of Contescourt,
where the Germans obtained a lodgment. The whole defence of the division was
imperilled, however, by the fact that the Germans had bitten deeply into the
British line to the south of the 108th Brigade, getting as far as Essigny on
their right rear, with the effect that a deep defensive flank had to be thrown
back in this direction, which used up all the reserves of the division. Thus,
when the Germans late that day and in the following morning pressed their
advantage at Contescourt, and were stopped by the magnificent resistance of the
1st Inniskilling Fusiliers at the neighbouring village of Fontaine-les-Clercs,
they should have been permanently held, as they were driven back in twelve
successive attacks. As there were no reserves available for a counter-attack,
however, the defence was gradually worn down by a great disparity of numbers,
so that by March 22 the Germans had advanced into the sector of the line which
ran down the course of the rivulet which is dignified by the name of the
Somme.</p>
<p>Such, in brief, was the experience of the three divisions which held the
line of the Eighteenth Corps on March 21. The Twentieth Division in reserve was
not employed during the day, nor were its services needed, for Maxse's Corps,
though attacked by eight German divisions, was able to hold its ground, thanks
largely to the splendid resistance of the shock-absorbing battalions in the
front-line. Up to 4 P.M. of March 22 the enemy had made no permanent advance
into the battle zone, but at that hour both flanks of the Corps had been turned
at Maissemy in the north and at Essigny in the south, and the alternative was
retirement or absolute isolation and destruction. It may then briefly be said
that, thanks to the resolute resistance of the battalions in the forward zone,
and to the solidity of those in the battle zone, the Eighteenth Corps was able
to maintain its ground until it was ordered to leave it, and that save for some
indentation of its front, especially at Contescourt, its main positions
remained inviolate.</p>
<p>Upon the right of the Eighteenth Corps lay the Third Corps, which covered
the enormous front of 30,000 yards. Of the nine brigades in the corps, eight
were in the line and only one in reserve, so that between the tenuity of the
line and its want of support it was an extremely tempting mark for the German
assault, especially as by ignoring the two brigades south of the Oise they
could concentrate their whole force upon the six brigades in line in the north.
It is true that the wide marshes of the Oise offered an impediment which
covered part of the British line, but as already remarked, the waters were
exceedingly low for the time of year, and the Germans very cleverly overcame
whatever obstacle was left.</p>
<p>The three divisions which formed Butler's Third Corps were the Fourteenth
Light Division (Cowper), which extended as far south as Moy, the Eighteenth
Division (Lee) covering the ground between Moy and Travecy, and finally the
Fifty-eighth Division (Cator) extending to Barisis, five or six miles south of
the Oise. As usual, we will take them from the north, confining the narrative
to the point at which the fighting in the front line came to an end.</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Division had all three brigades in the line, their order
being 41st, 42nd, and 43rd from the north. This division, composed entirely of
light infantry battalions, has had more than its share of desperate adventures
during its service in France. Again and again, notably in the fire-attack
before Ypres in 1915, in the third battle of Ypres, and upon the present
occasion, they have been exposed to ordeals of the most tremendous kind. Their
frontage was 5500 yards, which was not excessive as compared with that of other
divisions, and it contained some high ground north of Essigny which should have
been valuable for observation and defence, but none the less the attack was so
severe and so concentrated that it rapidly made an impression upon the defence,
which became more serious as the day wore on. The three outlying battalions
were the 8th and 9th King's Royal Rifles and the 6th Somerset Light Infantry,
and these, as usual, were sacrificed almost to a man. The enemy then stormed in
upon the line, making his advance here, as elsewhere, with a systematic skill
which showed how thoroughly he had been drilled and exercised behind the line.
This process of infiltration by which small bodies here, there, and everywhere
extend their advance where they find a cranny into which to push and establish
machine-gun posts which, unless they be instantly rooted out, soon grow into
formidable positions, shows the remarkable adaptability of the German
soldier&mdash;a quality with which, it must be admitted, the world had not
credited him in the past.</p>
<p>It may also be admitted that we yielded too easily to such tactics, and that
there was a tendency, as Third was pointed out in a memorandum from the Higher
Command, to consider a position as untenable because it was outflanked, instead
of closing in upon the intruders and pressing each side of the nut-crackers
against the intrusive nut. In many cases this was done, but in others small
bodies of daring men with a few machine-guns were able to dislodge whole lines
which they had managed to enfilade. On this occasion the Germans pushed in upon
both flanks of the Fourteenth Division, but their most serious gains occurred
about mid-day, when they captured Manufacture Farm north of Essigny, and
.shortly afterwards the weighbridge west of that village. The 41st Brigade on
the left were driven out of their headquarters, while the 43rd on the right
were pushed back to the Gibercourt road. A very weak point was evidently
developing, so General Butler hurried up part of the Second Cavalry Division
(Greenly), and also his only spare infantry brigade, the 54th (Sadleir-Jackson)
in order to make a line of resistance at the switch line between Camas and
Lizerolles. About 1:30 the Germans had got in between Essigny and Benay and
taken Lambay Wood. In view of their accelerating advance and the ominous
reports which were also coming in from the 173rd Brigade on the right. General
Butler continued to build up his rear line, putting into it not only all three
brigades of the Second Cavalry and the 54th Infantry Brigades, but also the
12th and Entrenching Battalions, thus covering the whole rear zone of the
corps. Isolated parties of the 41st Brigade were holding out in the main
position upon the left, but Hinacourt had also fallen and the line was slowly
rolling westward, so that by evening the Fourteenth Division had practically
lost its hold of the whole of its battle position.</p>
<p>Things were going better, however, with the Eighteenth Division, which held
9000 yards of front in the centre of the Third Corps. As this great frontage
was maintained by only two brigades, the 53rd (Higginson) in the north and the
55th (Wood) in the south, it must have been very thinly held, and even
admitting that the pressure was less than on either of the wing divisions, it
was none the less a fine achievement to keep a grip on so wide an area. Three
battalions were in the forward zone, the 8th Berks on the left, the 7th West
Kents in the centre, and the 7th Buffs on the right, all of whom did
splendidly, so that the defence of Fort Vendeuil, Cork, Cardiff, Durham, and
other redoubts upon this point form a whole series of epics. Besides the
infantry, the 79th Company Royal Engineers shared in the peril and the glory of
this defence. The wires connecting up these forward garrisons were speedily
cut, and no news came back all day, save the rattle of their rifle-fire. The
first definite tidings of the German advance came back through the fog about 12
o'clock, when some gunners emerged from its folds and announced that the
advanced guns had been overrun by the enemy. Soon after came a runner with a
message from Colonel Crosthwaite of the West Kents to say that his headquarters
was surrounded, and asking for a barrage on one side of it. A second message
arrived from him: "Still holding, 12:30 P.M. Boche all round within fifty The
yards except rear. Can only see forty yards, so it is difficult to kill the
blighters." It was the last word.</p>
<p>At 1:30 the enemy had closed in on the battle zone, and the high ground at
Cerisy in the area of the 53rd Brigade had been lost. On the front of the 55th
Brigade at the same hour strong parties of the enemy who had pushed between the
redoubts in the fog had occupied Vendeuil, while a section of guns in Ronquenet
Wood had been rushed by them. The reserve company of the Buffs in front of the
battle zone fought desperately against these intruders, while near the Dublin
redoubt Captain Dennis fought his guns till 5 P.M., inflicting heavy losses
upon the Germans, who collected in masses in front of the wire at this point.
Eventually his gun-pits were rushed, all the gunners being killed or taken. The
main weight of the attack fell upon the 53rd Brigade upon the left, and by the
middle of the afternoon all the redoubts upon this front had gone, while the
55th was still well covered. The battle zone, however, was still intact, though
the enemy massed heavily in front of Moulin Farm and opposite the switch line
from Vendeuil to Ly-Fontaine. They came forward several times, but the mist had
risen and the rifle-fire was accurate so that they made no progress. At Caponne
Farm there was also a brisk attack, but the 10th Essex, the only battalion left
in the brigade, held firmly to its position, though much plagued by low-flying
aeroplanes who skimmed their very heads, while the British Headquarters was
equally disturbed by a captured anti-tank gun with which the Germans kept up a
point-blank fire. To ease the pressure upon this wing, General Lee put in the
8th East Surreys from divisional reserve to thicken the line in the
neighbourhood of Remigny.</p>
<p>At 3:30 the covering forts upon the front of the 55th Brigade were still
holding out. Fort Vendeuil had made a particularly fine defence and broke up a
heavy attack. There was lamp signalling from this fort till 6 P.M., when the
lamp went out for ever. The 7th Buffs, who had charge of all this portion of
the battle front, did a magnificent day's work, and the famous regiment to
which this battalion belongs has won no prouder laurels in all the centuries.
Little is known of their fate save the pregnant facts that the front was
screened all day, that repeated messages for help were received up to 8:30 in
the evening, and that rifle-fire was heard from their posts till midnight. Bald
words&mdash;and yet to him who can see they convey a sure picture of fading
light, dwindling cartridges, and desperate men, baited from all sides and dying
with clenched teeth amid the ever-flowing German hordes.</p>
<p>About 4 o'clock the Germans had not only penetrated deeply into the battle
zone of the Fourteenth Division to the north, but had also dented that of the
Fifty-eighth in the south, so that both wings of the Eighteenth were in a
perilous state. The East Surreys were pushed forward, therefore, into the
switch line from Gibercourt to Ly-Fontaine. Two regiments of dismounted cavalry
from the Second Division were sent also to form a defensive flank upon the
right of the 55th Brigade. At 6 P.M. the attack upon the battle zone of the
Eighteenth had ceased, but it was being pushed hard upon the two wing
divisions, and the Fifty-eighth had lost both Quessy and Fargniers. Orders were
then issued to get behind the Crozat Canal after dark, this having always been
chosen as the second line of defence. The 64th Brigade, which behaved with
great steadiness, was directed to cover the retirement of the Fourteenth
Division, and the guns were withdrawn first, so as to cover the infantry at the
canal crossings. A few of the outlying posts were gathered up and brought back
in safety. The East Surreys covered the withdrawal of the poor remains of the
53rd Brigade, while the 3rd Hussars covered the 55th Brigade on the right. It
was a most difficult and delicate operation with a victorious and elated enemy
swarming upon the rear, but it was successfully carried out, and by 6 A.M. the
Third Corps were all across the canal, and the bridges in that sector had been
destroyed.</p>
<p>The performance of the Eighteenth Division had been a very fine one, and- it
was one of the units which could boast that on the evening of that terrible day
they still held the main position which they had covered in the morning. The
main German attack seems to have been conducted by four divisions, the
Thirty-fourth, Thirty-seventh, One hundred and third, and Two hundred and
eleventh, while four more were identified as either partly engaged or in
immediate reserve. The direction of the attack was mainly from the north and
came upon the front and flank of the 53rd Brigade, which could hardly call
itself a battalion in the evening. The gunners had to fire by guess until the
mist lifted, after which time they did great execution, and stuck to their
pieces to the last moment. A particularly notable performance was that of
Captain Haybittle of C Battery, 83rd Brigade Royal Field Artillery, whose guns,
just south of Benay, were rushed in the mist at noon. He and his crews removed
the blocks and held a neighbouring position with their rifles, directing at the
same time the fire of two guns in the rear which played upon the German masses
as they debouched from Lambay Wood. Afterwards he and his men fell back upon
these guns and fought them until late in the evening, when both of them were
knocked out. Nineteen hundred rounds were fired, and this stubborn defence did
much to hold the northern flank of the battle zone.</p>
<p>It only remains now to give some account of the events upon the front of the
173rd Brigade (Worgan) of the Fifty-eighth London Division (Gator) upon the
extreme right, in order to complete this rapid bird's-eye view of the events of
March 21 upon the front of the Fifth Army. This brigade, which filled the space
between Travecy on the left and the Oise upon the right, had the 2/1 Londons in
the forward zone, the 2/4 Londons in the battle zone opposite La F&egrave;re,
and the 2/3 Londons in the rear zone upon the Crozat Canal.<font color=
"#FF0000">*</font> The single battalion in front was attacked by the impossible
odds of three German divisions, but held out for a long time with great
constancy. Their brave Colonel, Richardson, was last seen surrounded by the
enemy, but still fighting with his headquarters troops around him.</p>
<p class="footnote"><font color="#FF0000">*</font> When two numbers are given
to a Territorial battalion, for instance 2/4 Londons, it means that the 4th
Londons have two battalions and that this is the second of them.</p>
<p>The Germans stormed forward to the battle zone, but there on the high ground
across the Oise they also met with a very vigorous resistance from the 4th
Londons, aided by some sappers and a company of pioneers. It was indeed a great
achievement of Colonel Dann and his men to hold up the attack with such
disparity of numbers, for according to the official German account several
divisions took part in the attack. Finally, as the afternoon wore on the enemy
obtained a lodgment in the left of the position, and before evening they
occupied Travecy and part of Fargniers, winding up by the capture of Quessy.
The 2/3 Londons had been drawn into the fight, and now the 2/8 Londons from the
174th Brigade were brought north and placed in reserve along the line of the
Crozat Canal, across which the troops were now ordered to fall back. This
battalion with the 18th Entrenching Battalion guarded the whole canal line from
Condren Crossing on the right to the junction with the Eighteenth Division on
the left. By 5 A.M. all troops were across and the bridges had been destroyed.
The 2/4th Londons succeeded in removing all their stores and munitions, and
their remarkable achievement in holding the high ground of La F&egrave;re
against ten times their numbers for as many hours, during which they inflicted
very heavy losses upon their assailants and repulsed six separate attacks, was
among the outstanding military feats of that difficult day.</p>
<p>It is needless to say that the losses in men were very heavy on March 21,
though it is difficult to separate them from the general losses of the retreat,
which will be recorded later. Among senior officers of note who died for their
country that day, besides those already mentioned, were Colonels Acklom of the
Northumberland Fusiliers, Thorne of the North Staffords, Wrenford of the East
Lancashires, and Stewart of the Leicesters.</p>

<p class="first">THE reader is now in a position to form some conception of the
situation of the Fifth Army upon the evening of March 21, and to understand the
problems which confronted its commander. He was of opinion, and the opinion was
shared by some at least of his corps commanders, that had he had four or five
Fifth divisions of reserves within easy call, he could unquestionably have held
the line. He had, however, to deal with the situation as it stood, and no man
could have had a more difficult and responsible task. His own reserves were
already practically engaged. On the other hand, both his air service and the
reports of prisoners assured him that those of the enemy were numerous and
near. His line had been deeply dented in four places: in the sector of the
Sixteenth Division at Ronssoy, in that of the Twenty-fourth Division at
Maissemy, in that of the Fourteenth Division at Essigny, and in that of the
Fifty-eighth Division opposite La F&egrave;re. These various points are, it
will be observed, almost equidistant along the line, which tends to show that
the German attack was conducted upon a plan which threw such forces upon
limited areas that the result was almost a certainty, whatever troops might be
holding them. It was the misfortune and not the fault of these gallant
divisions that their thin ranks were in the very places which huge hordes of
the enemy had marked in advance as their objectives.</p>
<p>It must have been clear to General Gough and to his corps commanders that a
second day of battle, with the German reserves pouring up, would certainly mean
a penetration of the line at these various weak points, and that the enemy
would then be in a position to cut off large portions of the force. These
units, be they divisions or corps, would no doubt fight to the last, but the
end must surely be annihilation. In that case the general situation would have
been an appalling one. It might indeed have been decisive for the whole war.
There was nothing between the Germans and Amiens. Pouring westwards they would
have destroyed all reserves almost before they could have alighted from their
trains or their motors, and within a few days would have entirely cut off the
British from the French, with the estuary of the Somme between the two armies.
Any hesitation would have been fatal. An immediate decision was imperative.
That decision could only be that the British Army should retard the German
advance by an obstinate rearguard action, that it should endeavour to preserve
its line, and allow no unit to be cut off, that it should fall back in an
orderly fashion upon its reserves, and that when it met them it should turn at
bay and prevent the enemy from reaching his objective. This was the plan which
General Gough instantly formed, and which he proceeded with firmness and moral
courage to carry out. Orders were at once given that the weaker portions of the
line should drop back behind the obstacles which had already been marked out as
the best defensive lines. At the same time with great foresight he gave orders
that the old French Somme trenches, from the river southwards, should be set in
order as a last line of defence. He despatched his chief army engineer. General
Grant, to carry out this order, and it was eventually a very vital one in
ensuring the safety of the army in the last stages of its retreat.</p>
<p>The orders to each corps commander were given in the form of general
indications, the details being left to his own judgment, for the position of
each corps and the pressure upon it formed a number of independent problems. We
shall turn to the north therefore, where, upon the whole, the situation was
least critical, and we shall follow first the Seventh and then the Nineteenth
Corps in their various movements until a condition of equilibrium was at last
safely established. Let it be at once stated that the design was duly carried
out along the whole line, and that the operation, which at the time was
designated as a disaster, was really a remarkable example of how by the
coolness of commanders and the discipline of their men, the most desperate
situation may be saved and the most powerful and aggressive foe foiled in his
attempts. What complicated the military problem of the Fifth Army was that the
German threat was really aimed at Paris as much as at Amiens, and that if they
could have got through at Essigny and cut off the Fifty-eighth Division there
were hardly any reserves between them and the all-important metropolis.</p>
<p>The morning of March 22 again presented those conditions of fog and low
visibility which are favourable to the attack. There was no advance in the
early hours upon the new positions of the Ninth Division, but the enemy
directed his attention entirely to the Chapel Hill front of the Twenty-first
Division upon the right, which was still held by the Lincolns. An attempt was
made to relieve them by the Scots battalion of the South Africans, who took
over some of the northern line. The defence was a splendid one, but by 4
o'clock in the afternoon the Germans had gained most of this high ground by
outflanking it, and the South Africans at Revelon Farm, who had been reinforced
by the 11th Royal Scots Battalion from the 27th Brigade, were badly enfiladed
in consequence by rifle and machine-gun fire from the south. Colonel M'Leod of
the South African Scots, and many officers and men, were among the casualties.
There was a withdrawal therefore of the right of the Ninth Division, and about
6:30 P.M. the Germans had got as far as Heudicourt, and the brigade staff at
Sorel had to line up in order to resist his turning movement to the north. So
far round had the Germans penetrated that the Africans were compelled to fall
back due north for some distance until their rear was clear, when they
retreated with the rest of the division westwards towards Nurlu. By two in the
morning of March 23 the new positions had been reached, and the attenuated
South African Brigade, which had borne the brunt of the fighting, was taken
into divisional reserve.</p>
<p>This difficult retreat was rendered possible by the The desperate resistance
offered by the 6th Scots Borderers, who formed a defensive flank south of Sorel
and gave the troops to the north time to gain the new position. One company of
the 11th Royal Scots was cut off in Revelon Farm, but managed to fight their
way back, bringing with them an officer and eighteen other prisoners. No guns
were lost by the Ninth Division save ten, which were without teams and were
therefore destroyed.</p>
<p>At this period there was some dislocation between the left of the Ninth
Division and the right of the Forty-seventh, as is likely to occur where each
belongs to a different corps and army. For a time there was a gap between them.
This was partly overcome, however, on the evening of the 22nd by means of the
Second Division, which lay in reserve behind the Forty-seventh and put its 99th
Brigade under the orders of the Ninth Division so as to ensure unity of command
in this position of danger.</p>
<p>Turning to the right wing of the Seventh Corps allusion has been made in the
last chapter to the severe pressure upon the Sixteenth Division and its
determined resistance. It will be remembered that it was reinforced by the
116th Brigade of the Thirty-ninth Division, and all three brigades were
involved in the same heavy fighting on the morning of March 22, the German
attack being relentless in its vigour. In the course of this severe action the
village of St. Emilie was lost, and was afterwards retaken in a very gallant
fashion by the 1st Hertfords, a battalion which had greatly distinguished
itself already at St. Julien and elsewhere. The orders were to retreat,
however, and in this movement the switch line from Saulcourt dug and manned by
the 117th and 118th Brigades proved invaluable. The army policy was to fight
rearguards and delay the enemy, and this was most efficiently done during the
evening of March 22, the flank of the Twenty-first Division being covered in
its retirement, and the line held against vigorous attacks. Many of the guns of
the Thirty-ninth Divisional artillery were lost through their extreme devotion
in covering the retreat of the Sixteenth Division, for they frequently carried
on until the infantry were behind them. The enemy was pressing his attacks with
great vigour, and every withdrawal was followed up by strong bodies of troops
and of field artillery.</p>
<p>During these Operations General Hornby had been in command of the division,
but on March 23 General Feetham returned from leave and took over the duties.
All day the Thirty-ninth Division was fighting rearguard actions as it fell
back upon the Somme. In the course of them General Hornby, now in command of
the 116th Brigade, was severely wounded. The roads running westwards to Peronne
and Clery were crowded with traffic, but the Thirty-ninth Division turned at
bay again and again, giving them time to get clear. By evening the remains of
the Sixteenth Division had been practically squeezed out of the line, and the
Thirty-ninth had the Sixty-sixth Division on its right and the Twenty-first on
its left. At night it held a line from La Maisonnette along the canal to south
of Ommiecourt. The enemy appeared to be much exalted by the capture of Peronne,
and the 118th Brigade on the right heard them singing lustily during the
night.</p>
<p>On March 23 the German attack continued to be very heavy upon the front of
the two Scottish brigades of the Ninth Division, which were in touch with the
Fifth Corps in the north and with the Twenty-first seventh Division in the
south. So close and violent was the fighting that the 6th Scots Borderers were
only extricated with difficulty. At 2 P.M. the line was east of Bouchavesnes,
but by 4 P.M. the Twenty-first Division on the right had lost ground, and the
flank and even the rear of the Ninth was for a time exposed until the Natal
Regiment was thrown out south of Bouchavesnes to cover it. The three brigades
of the Twenty-first Division were engaged all day as they slowly retreated
before the swarming enemy.</p>
<p>March 23 was a most arduous day for both the Highland and the Lowland
brigades, for each of them was attacked again and again with the utmost
violence. Though the attacks were repulsed each of them had the effect of
weakening still further these units which were already much exhausted by hard
fighting and incessant exertion. Gradually they were pushed to the westward
until they found themselves lining the eastern edge of St. Pierre Vaast Wood,
and manning the ridge which extended from that forest to the ruins of
Saillisel. Their left at this period seems to have been in the air, as the 99th
Brigade had been returned to its division, and they had failed to make contact
with the Seventeenth Division, who were at the time just west of Saillisel. At
this period the front of the Ninth Division seems to have covered 11,000 yards,
and to have extended for at least two miles into the area of the Third Army,
showing how desperate were the exertions needed to cover the ground and to
prevent a break-through.</p>
<p>In the morning of March 24 the Scots could see the German infantry streaming
forward over the open ground which had been evacuated upon the evening before.
It was clear that a great attack was imminent, and at 9 o'clock, after a very
heavy cannonade, it developed along the whole line. For three hours the Germans
made repeated efforts to force their way through the Ninth Division, but on
each occasion they were repulsed, and their losses at this point were
exceedingly heavy. About mid-day, however, they had gained so much ground upon
the flanks that the South Africans were almost surrounded, and shot into from
north and south. The general British line had fallen back to the ridge east of
Combles, 1000 yards behind, but General Dawson found it impossible to withdraw
in daylight, so that his brigade was compelled to defend itself in its isolated
position at Marri&egrave;res Wood as best it could. The result was a disaster,
but one of a most glorious kind, for the men fought until their last cartridges
had been expended, and a large proportion of the survivors were wounded men.
General Dawson was among the prisoners. It was reported afterwards from German
sources that he was taken while working a machine-gun with his brigade-major
lying dead beside him. The whole defence was said by the Germans to have been
one of the finest things in the war. From that time forward the South African
Brigade had practically ceased to exist until it was reorganised in Flanders.
The supporting parties alone were left, and these were formed at once into a
composite battalion under Colonel Young, for no rifle could be spared from the
fighting line at such a time, Whilst the South Africans had been engaged in
this death struggle the 27th Lowland Brigade had been in a similar plight. All
these battalions, the 6th Scots Borderers and the 11th and 12th Royal Scots,
were very hard pressed, particularly the former. The seventh Lowlanders
extricated themselves from an almost desperate situation and fell back from St.
Pierre Vaast to the position covering Combles. So great was the general
dislocation of troops that one portion of the 5th Camerons found themselves
that evening fighting with the Forty-seventh Division, while another was with
the Seventeenth.</p>
<p>The main effort of the enemy upon March 24 was directed against the-Fifth
and Seventh Corps in the centre of the British line, though his energy at other
points was sufficient to engage the full attention of all the other units.
Heavy and fresh masses were poured in at the centre and the pressure was great.
For the Seventh Corps it was the fourth day of incessant and desperate
fighting. There were few men left, and these were very exhausted. Towards
evening the left of the Seventh had been turned, and had been compromised by
the occupation of Sailly Saillisel. All attempts at counter-attack, however
gallant, were destined to failure, or at the best evanescent success, for there
was not the weight to carry them through. At 4:15 the report was: "The enemy is
through on the right flank and has occupied Combles, Morval, and Lesboeufs."
The Seventh Corps then fell back to the line Hem&mdash;Maurepas and threw out
every stray unit it could get together &mdash; troops of cavalry, Canadian
motor-guns, crews and machine-guns of tanks, and all the powdered debris of
broken formations, in the direction of Bernafoy Wood to cover the exposed
flank. It was still out of touch with the Fifth Corps. This movement gave the
line an awkward angle from Peronne and made it almost impossible to hold the
stretch of river. For the time the right of the Third Army was a good five
miles behind the left of the Fifth Army&mdash;the result, as Sir Douglas Haig
has stated, of an unauthorised local withdrawal due to misunderstanding of
orders. The line near Peronne was still held by the Thirty-ninth Division.
Throughout the morning of the 24th strong enemy forces were seen by them
pushing forwards between Clery and Rancourt, where they were harassed by the
British fire in enfilade, particularly on the roads, where the artillery of the
Sixteenth and Thirty-ninth Divisions caused much havoc and confusion, doing
great work at short range over open sights. Many excellent targets were missed,
however, owing to that difficulty in liaison between the infantry and the guns,
which was one of the greatest problems of the operations. During the day the
average number of rounds fired per battery was 3000, most of which were
observed fire.</p>
<p>As March 24 wore on the position of the Thirty-ninth Division became
untenable, as they heard upon one side of the loss of Saillisel, and on the
other of the forcing of the Somme at Brie, Pagny, and Bethencourt. They moved
back, therefore, at night with orders to hold the line from Buscourt to
Feuill&egrave;res. The average strength of brigades at this time was not more
than 20 officers and 600 men. From the morning of March 25 the Thirty-ninth
Division passed to the command of the Nineteenth Corps, and its further
arduous. work will be found under that heading. During all this day Campbell's
Twenty-first Division, still fighting hard in a succession of defensive
positions, had its right upon the Somme, while its left was in Battle
intermittent touch with the Ninth Division.</p>
<p>The Ninth Division had fallen back, the two seventh Scottish brigades being
continually in action until they reached the Maricourt&mdash;Montauban line,
where they supported the First Cavalry Division who were in front of Bernafoy
Wood. The general line at this period from Montauban southwards was held ^ by
the Ninth Division, the First Cavalry, the newly-arrived and most welcome
Thirty-fifth Division (Franks), the Twenty-first Division, now reduced to a
single composite brigade under General Headlam, and then some oddments under
Colonel Hunt. This brought the line to the Somme, on the south side of which
were the remains of the Sixteenth and Thirty-ninth Divisions. This might sound
an imposing force upon so short a front, but save for the Thirty-fifth each
division was <i>nominis magni umbra</i>, none of them stronger than brigades.
The Forty-seventh Division was retiring at this time upon Contalmaison, and a
gap of several miles was appearing between the Fifth and Seventh Corps. During
the movements upon March 24 the guns of the 65th and 150th K.F.A. did great
work and earned the warm gratitude of the weary infantry. The enemy targets
round Combles were all that a gunner could wish.</p>
<p>All troops north of the Somme were upon March 25 transferred to the Fifth
Corps, and became part of the Third Army. The 27th Brigade was drawn out of the
line, and the 26th was under the orders of the Thirty-fifth Division which took
over the defence of this sector, relieving the exhausted Twenty-first Division.
March 25 saw heavy attacks on Bernafoy, which was lost once, but regained by
the 106th Brigade. There was still a gap to the north, and no touch had been
made with the Seventeenth Division, though the cavalry had built up a defensive
flank in that direction. At 2 P.M. the Germans attacked from Ginchy towards
Trones Wood, names which we hoped had passed for ever from our war maps. In the
first onset they pressed back the 12th and 18th Highland Light Infantry of the
106th Brigade, but there was a strong counter-attack headed by the 9th Durhams
which retook Faldere Wood and restored the situation. A second attack about 3
P.M. upon the Thirty-fifth Division was also repulsed. The German pressure was
so great, however, that the line of defence was taken back during the night to
the Bray&mdash;Albert position. The enemy followed closely at the heels of the
rearguards, though the guns were active to the last so as to conceal the
retreat as long as possible. Early in the morning of March 26 the Lowland
Brigade was again attacked with great violence, but the 12th Royal Scots, upon
whom the main assault fell, drove it back with loss. Changes in other parts of
the line, however, necessitated a withdrawal across the Ancre, so as to keep in
touch with the Twelfth Division which had now come up on the left. The Ninth
Division upon this date numbered 1540 rifles with 20 machine-guns. It was
shortly afterwards drawn from the line after as severe a spell of service as
troops could possibly endure. The story of the retreat of the Seventh Corps has
been indicated mainly from the point of view of this northern unit, but it will
be understood that the Twenty-first, as tried and as worn as its Scottish
neighbour, was keeping its relative position to the south, while the Sixteenth
was conforming in the same way until the time when it passed into the
Nineteenth Corps.</p>
<p>The Thirty-fifth Division, newly arrived from Flanders, did great and indeed
vital work in upholding the weakening-line at the moment of its greatest
strain. A consecutive account of its work may make this clear. Pushing through
the remains of the Twenty-first Division on March 24, Franks threw his men
instantly into the thick of the fight, attacking the Germans in front of Clery.
Marindin's 105th Brigade did great work that day, the 15th Cheshires on the
right and 15th Sherwood Foresters on the left, attacking and, for a time,
carrying the ridge of Clery, though it was impossible in view of the general
retreat to hold it for long. The Germans were staggered by the sudden,
unexpected blow, and they poured troops against their new antagonist, losing
very heavily in their reconquest of the ridge. Finally the front line of the
Sherwoods was practically annihilated, and the Cheshires were in almost as bad
a way, but with the help of some Sussex men who were formed into an emergency
unit, together with some signallers, they were able to draw off, and a line of
defence was organised under General Marindin, but general orders arrived for a
withdrawal to the front Curlu&mdash;Maurepas, which was safely carried out, the
17th Royal Scots covering the rear. It was a most ticklish business, as touch
had been lost with the Ninth Division, but the wounded were safely evacuated,
and all withdrew in good order, the 12th Highland Light Infantry finally
bridging the gap upon the left. This battalion had lost in these operations its
splendid Colonel, Anderson, whose work has earned a posthumous V.C. The enemy
followed closely, and attacked again before dusk. but was driven off. The
attack was renewed on the morning of March 25, but still without success, the
4th North Staffords bearing the brunt. The weary troops of the Scottish
division, who had been engaged for four long days, were rallied here and formed
into provisional fighting units, which did good service by relieving the 106th
Brigade at Maricourt, when it was forced back. The pressure upon the division
was desperately severe, but was slightly eased by the arrival of a
Northumberland Fusilier battalion from the Twenty-first Division. That night
the order was to withdraw to the line Bray&mdash;Albert.</p>
<p>The general command of the retiring line in this section, including the
Ninth, Twenty-first, and Thirty-fifth Divisions had for the time fallen to
General Franks, who handed his own division over to General Pollard. The
position was exceedingly critical, as not only were the units weak, but
ammunition had run low. The line was still falling back, and the enemy was
pressing on behind it with mounted scouts in the van. In this retreat tanks
were found of the greatest service in holding the German advance. The route was
through Morlancourt and Ville-sur-Ancre to a defensive position upon the right
bank of the Ancre in the Dernancourt area, the orders being to hold the line
between that village and Buire. Both villages were attacked that evening, but
the Thirty-fifth Division on the right and the 26th Brigade on the left, drove
back the enemy. By the morning of March 28 the line seemed, to have reached
equilibrium in this part, and the welcome sight was seen of large bodies of
troops moving up from the rear. This was the head of the Australian
reinforcements. During the day the enemy got into Dernancourt, but was thrown
out again by the 19th Northumberland Fusiliers Pioneer Battalion. The 104th
Brigade also drove back an attack in front of Treux Wood. It was clear that the
moving hordes were losing impetus and momentum. That same evening the
Australians were engaged upon the right and inflicting heavy losses on the
enemy. On the night of March 30 the Thirty-fifth Division, which had lost
nearly half its numbers, was relieved by the Third Australians.</p>
<p>We shall now follow the Nineteenth Corps in its perilous retreat. It will be
remembered that on the evening of the first day of the battle it had been badly
outflanked to the north, where the Sixty-sixth Division had made so stout a
resistance, and had also lost a great deal of the battle zone in the south,
which was made more disastrous by the fall of Le Verguier at nine on the
morning of March 22. The supporting line formed by the Fiftieth Division had
also been pushed in at Poeuilly and other points, and it was with no little
difficulty that the depleted and exhausted corps was able to get across the
Somme on the morning of March 23, where they were ordered to hold the whole
front of the river, including the important crossings at Brie. This, as a
glance at the map will show, was a very considerable retreat, amounting to no
less than ten miles in two days, but it was of the first importance to get a
line of defence, and also to lessen the distance between the sorely tried army
and its reserves. It was hard indeed to give up ground and to be back on the
line of Peronne, but there was at least the small solace that this was the
ravaged ground which the Germans had themselves turned into a waste land, and
that there was no town of any consequence nor any military point of importance
in its whole extent.</p>
<p>By the late afternoon of March 23 the bulk of the Nineteenth Corps was
across the Somme. The Germans had followed closely, and there was rear-guard
fighting all the way in which the Fiftieth Division slowed down the pursuit of
the enemy. The officers who were entrusted with the defence of the line of
river soon realised that they had a difficult task, for the dry weather had
shrunk it into insignificance in this section, and owing to trees and thick
undergrowth the fields of fire were very limited, while the thin line of
defenders scattered over some twelve miles of front offered, even after the
advent of the Eighth Division, an ineffective screen against the heavy advance
from the east. Heneker's Eighth Division, a particularly fine unit consisting
entirely of Regular battalions, had made heroic exertions to reach the field of
battle, 'and fitted itself at once into its correct position in that very
complicated operation in a way which seemed marvellous to soldiers on the
spot.</p>
<p>In the evening of March 23 a number of Germans, some of them cavalry, were
observed upon the farther side of the Somme and were heavily punished by
artillery fire. None got across before dark, but during the night numerous
bodies established themselves upon the western side. Local reserves had been
placed near the probable crossings, and these in several cases hunted the enemy
across again; but the fact was that the river could be forded anywhere, and
that a German concentration on a Battle given point could always overpower the
thin local defence. The line of resistance was further weakened by the First
Cavalry Division, which had linked up the Nineteenth Corps with the Eighteenth
Corps on the south, being now ordered to join the Seventh Corps in the north.
The general order of the troops at this moment was, that the newly arrived
Eighth Division was on the extreme right touching elements of the Eighteenth
Corps at Bethencourt and extending with the aid of one brigade of the Fiftieth
as far as &Eacute;terpigny, nearly eight miles. From &Eacute;terpigny to
Biaches, south of Peronne, were the remains of the Sixty-sixth Division,
covering about four miles, and joining the Thirty-ninth Division on the right
of the Seventh Corps near that point. The Twenty-fourth was lining up between
Hattencourt and Chaulnes.</p>
<p>It was on the front of the Eighth Division, at Bethencourt, at Pargny, and
at St. Christ, that the Germans made their chief lodgments upon the western
banks of the river on the morning of March 24. The Bethencourt attack was
particularly formidable, both for its energy and because it aimed at the
junction of the two corps. By two in the afternoon the German infantry were
across in considerable numbers, and had forced back the right flank of the
Eighth Division, which fell back hinging upon the river farther north, so as to
oppose the repeated efforts which were made to enfilade the whole line. General
Watts' responsibilities were added to next morning, March 25, for the two much
exhausted divisions of the Seventh Corps which were holding the northern bend
of the river from Biaches to beyond Frise were handed over to him when the rest
of Congreve's Corps was incorporated in the Third Army. These two divisions
were the Thirty-ninth and the Sixteenth, the former holding as far as Frise and
the latter the Somme crossings to the west of that point.</p>
<p>March 25 was a day of great anxiety for General Watts, as the enemy were
pressing hard, many of his own units were utterly exhausted, and the
possibilities of grave disaster were very evident. A real fracture of the line
at either end might have led to a most desperate situation. The French were now
at the south end of the river position, but their presence was not yet strongly
felt, and with every hour the pressure was heavier upon the bent line of the
Eighth Division, on which the whole weight of the central battle had fallen. By
10 o'clock on the morning of March 25, the defensive flank of the Eighth
Division had been pushed back to Licourt, and had been broken there, but had
been mended once more by counter-attack, and was still holding with the aid of
the Fiftieth. The cyclists of the Nineteenth Corps, the armoured-car batteries,
and other small units were thrust in to stiffen the yielding line, which was
still rolled up, until after one o'clock it lay back roughly from Cizancourt to
Marchelepot and the railway line west of that place. Later in the day came the
news of fresh crossings to the north at St. Christ and &Eacute;terpigny where
the Sixty-sixth Division had been pushed back to Maisonette. It was evident
that the line was doomed. To stay in it was to risk destruction. At 4:15 the
order was given to withdraw to a second position which had been prepared
farther westward but to retain the line of the Somme as the left flank. During
these operations the Eighth Division had performed the remarkable feat of
holding back and defeating fourteen separate German divisions during thirty-six
hours on a nine-mile front, and finally withdrew in perfect order. Every unit
was needed to cover the ground, and the general disposition of divisions was
roughly as drawn:</p>
<pre>
R. - Hattencourt. Chantres. Estr&eacute;es. Assevillers. Herbecourt. Frise - L.
         24           8        50        66          39         16
</pre>
<p>It will be seen that General Watts' command had increased from two divisions
to six, but it is doubtful whether the whole six had the normal strength of
two. The new line had not yet been completed and was essentially unstable, but
none the less it formed a rallying point for the retreating troops. It should
be noted that from the morning of March 25 General Fayolle took over the
command south of the Somme.</p>
<p>The Twenty-fourth Division, which had suffered so severely in the first two
days of the action, was again heavily engaged during this arduous day. In the
morning it had been directed to counter-attack in the direction of Dreslincourt
in co-operation with the French Twenty-second Division. In the meantime,
however, the whole situation had been changed by the right flank of the Eighth
Division being turned, so that General Daly's men as they went up for the
attack were themselves heavily attacked near Curchy, while the junction with
the French could not be made. They fell back therefore upon their original
position where hard fighting ensued all day, and a most anxious situation
developed upon the southern flank, where a wide gap existed and the enemy was
mustering in force. Colonel Walker, C.R.E. of this division, was killed that
day.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 26 the new line had been occupied. The Seventeenth
Corps had retired in the night to the Bray&mdash;Albert line, which left a
considerable gap in the north, to the west of Frise, but this was filled up by
an impromptu line made up of stragglers and various odds and ends from the rear
of the army. It was in the south, however, that the attack was most severe, and
here it soon became evident that the line was too long and the defenders too
weak, so that it could not be maintained against a determined assault. Before
the sun had risen high above the horizon it had been shaken from end to end,
the Twenty-fourth Division being hard put to it to hold Fonches, while the
Sixty-sixth were driven out of Herbecourt. At 9:30 the order was given to
withdraw, and with their brave rearguards freely sacrificing themselves to hold
back the swarming enemy, the troops&mdash;some of them in the last stage of
exhaustion&mdash;fell back upon a second position. It was at this period of the
battle that Major Whitworth, the gallant commander of the 2/6 Manchesters,
stood at bay with his battalion, which numbered exactly 34 men. He and 17 of
his men were dead or wounded after this last stand, and 17 survivors were all
that could be mustered that evening.</p>
<p>Before the right wing fell back to Vrely there had been a good deal of
fighting. The Twenty-fourth Division, which was now a mere skeleton, was
strongly attacked in the morning of March 27, and Dugan's 73rd Brigade was
pushed back towards Caix, the 8th Sussex having very heavy losses, including
Colonel Hill, and Banham, the second-in-command.</p>
<p>The situation upon the other flank of the Twenty-fourth Division was also
particularly desperate, and the 9th East Surrey, under Major Clark, sacrificed
itself to cover the withdrawal of the 72nd Brigade. There were few more gallant
actions in the war. Major Clark, writing from a German prison, gave a small
account which enables us to get a glimpse of the actual detail of such a
combat. The enemy's infantry were in force, he says, within 100 yards of his
scattered line. "We managed to get back some hundred yards when I saw that our
position was really desperate. The enemy were sweeping up from the south, and
several lines of them were in between us and our next defensive line.... We
were seen and the enemy began to surround us, so I decided to fight it out. We
took up position in a communication trench, and used our rifles with great
effect. Grant was doing good work till shot through the head, and Warre-Dymond
behaved admirably. It was a fine fight, and we held them until ammunition gave
out. They then charged and mopped up the remainder. They were infuriated with
us. My clothing had been riddled with shrapnel, my nose fractured, and my face
and clothing smothered with blood. There are 3 officers and 59 men unwounded.
The rest of the battalion are casualties. It was a great fight, and the men
were simply splendid. I have the greatest admiration for them. It was a
glorious end." Such were the class of men whom the East End of London sent into
the New Army.</p>
<p>The new position on March 26 may be depicted as follows:</p>
<pre>
R. - Rouvroy. Rosierea. Vauvillers. Framerville. Proyart. Froissy. - L.
       24        8         50          66          39       16
</pre>
<p>The Germans followed up closely all along the line, the pressure being great
everywhere, but greatest on the left, where the Thirty-ninth and Sixty-sixth
disengaged themselves with difficulty, both of them being heavily attacked, and
the Cambridgeshires fighting a fine rearguard action in Biaches. About two in
the afternoon the troops were solidly established in their new positions, but
the extreme north of the line was in a very unstable condition, as the
Sixteenth were fired upon from the north of the river and their left was in no
condition to meet an attack. On the right, however, there was earlier in the
day some very spirited fighting, for the Eighth and Fiftieth Divisions, though
very worn, were in far better shape than their comrades who had endured the
gassings and the losses of the first day.</p>
<p>The Fiftieth Division fought particularly hard to stop the enemy's advance,
turning at every rise, and hitting back with all the strength that was left it.
A very fine little delaying action was fought by its rearguard this day upon
the line Lihons&mdash;Vermandovillers&mdash;Foucaucourt. The 5th and 8th
Durhams, with a few of the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers and a couple of
batteries, held up the advance for several hours and stood their ground with
such resolution that two platoons of the Northumberlands were never seen again,
for they held on to Foucaucourt until both they and the village were submerged.
As the day wore on and the pressure increased, the Sixty-sixth Division was
forced to let go of Framerville, for these men had fought without sleep for
five days and nights. They staggered back through the rear ranks of the
Fiftieth Division, consisting of the 4th Northumberland Fusiliers, who at once,
under the personal leading of General Riddell and Colonel Anstey, both of them
on horseback and in red-banded caps, rushed the village once again. It was a
fine The advance which was much helped by the way in which Captain Thompson in
Vauvillers brought his machine-guns to bear upon the flank of the Germans
advancing to the south of him. Brigade-Major Paget, a very rising officer, was
killed in this spirited affair.</p>
<p>No gains could ever be held, as the general line was receding, but all such
successful blows were of use as slowing down the German advance, teaching him
caution, and gaining time&mdash;for time was the very essence of the matter. If
there were time the line could be built up behind. If there were no time Amiens
must fall. "I will fight before Amiens, in Amiens, or behind Amiens!" cried
Foch. Brave words, but if Amiens went, the future was dark indeed.</p>
<p>At eight on the morning of March 27 the Germans were raging once more along
the whole line of the British breakwater. The gallant weary Eighth Division was
heavily attacked near Rosi&egrave;res and the stormers reached the village, but
Heneker's men counter-attacked in most heroic fashion, and cleared them out
again, taking a number of prisoners. The 2nd Devons, 1st Sherwoods, and 22nd
Durham Light Infantry were the units engaged in this fine action.</p>
<p>News was bad from the north end of the line, and it was understood that the
Germans were in Proyart, so both the Eighth and Fiftieth Divisions, out of
their scanty ranks, sent reinforcements (R.E. details and the 2nd Devons) to
help the Thirty-ninth Division. At 3 P.M. on March 27 the Germans were in
Framerville, and an hour later were on the top of the Eighth and Fiftieth once
more, in front of Harbonni&egrave;re. The rearguard of the latter were the 4th
and 6th Northumberland Fusiliers. The German guns were in full blast that
morning, and the infantry full of ginger, but they could not break that
protective line, thin, disciplined, and flexible. The two battalions could not
cover the around, and the Germans streamed past their flank. In order to
support the advanced line every available man was assembled on the reverse
slope of a rise, just out of sight of the Germans. In front of them they could
hear the roar of the battle, ever growing nearer as the British line was rolled
back. "We were a mixed crowd," says one who was among them. "Staff officers in
red caps, clerks in spectacles, signalling officers, cooks, sappers, and that
extraordinary never-beaten infantry." It was indeed one of the crises of the
war, for the situation was desperate just south of the Somme, and if the enemy
was through at this point also the line would be in fragments. The whole array
waited over the curve of the hill, and as the enemy, in eight or ten waves,
poured over the brow they fired at close range in the traditional Busaco
fashion of the peninsula. A bayonet charge as of old completed the transaction,
and the enemy broke and fled, with a barrage beating down upon his supports.
The British infantry from the top of the rise was treated to the welcome, and,
as it must be confessed, unusual sight of a large force of Germans all shredded
out and hurrying for the nearest shelter, "like a football crowd caught in the
rain." It is an instance of the incurable levity of British troops that they
broke into the refrain of <i>"Goodbyee! Goodbyee! There's a silver lining in
the skyee!"</i></p>
<p>In spite of their cheerfulness, however, the losses had been heavy, both
Colonel Robinson of the 6th and Colonel Wright of the 5th Northumberland
Fusiliers being among the casualties. Each of the battalions now numbered
little more than a hundred men.</p>
<p>This brisk counter-attack was a healthy little reminder to the Germans upon
this section of the line that the British infantry might be overborne by
numbers or by strategy, but that they were still the men who had in the
previous year chased them again and again from the most formidable positions
which, they could construct. But these points of aggressive resistance were now
rare and the men were worn out. It does indeed seem to be an extreme example of
the weakness of the reserves at this period in France, that in spite of the
fact that the battle broke out upon March 21, no help save the one division had
in the course of a week reached the overmatched and exhausted troops. It is
true that the Higher Command may well have reckoned upon the French as
reserves, and this would have been perfectly true had they been able to take
over the ground in the south and contract the British line. They did take over
the ground, but they took over most of the two British Corps as well, so that
the Nineteenth Corps was little the better for their presence. Unaided by
either their own people or by the French, the Nineteenth Corps still held on
desperately with dwindling numbers to a line which was far beyond their
strength.</p>
<p>Bad as was the position of the Nineteenth Corps, it was made worse by the
ever-changing position in the north. When the Seventh Corps fell back to the
line of Bray it was behind the left flank of the Nineteenth Corps. But now it
was compelled to make a further move to the line Chipilly&mdash;Morlancourt,
while all bridges were ordered to be destroyed up to Cherisy. This disposition
was absolutely necessary in view of what was happening in the Third Army but it
made the position more and more difficult for the men in the south, who had
either to fall back or to see the gap of undefended river upon their left rear
grow wider and wider. General Watts is a stubborn fighter with no idea of going
back if it can be in any way avoided, so he held on in the south and fought a
brisk, successful action there, while he sent such poor reinforcements as he
could to the Sixteenth Division in the north, stopping the dangerous rent with
any odds and ends upon which he could lay his hands. Three hundred improvised
infantry, six Lewis guns, and a battery in armoured cars were the best that he
could do, and these troops actually did hold the river line in the north from
the early morning of March 27 until nightfall, against an ever-growing menace.
But they could not cover all the ground, and the enemy, as was foreseen, was
coming over the river and getting behind the British line. The Sixteenth
Division was practically destroyed, and the Thirty-ninth was in little better
case, though General Feetham showed great energy in re-organising all the
debris of units upon the road, so that the line of resistance was very weak. In
the afternoon a considerable party of Germans with machine-guns had got across
the river at Cherisy, west of Morcourt, held by seventy men of the Sixteenth
Division, and pushed on in the most daring way south-west to Lamotte and
Bayonvillers. They were right across the rear of the Nineteenth Corps, and a
great disaster seemed inevitable, but weary as the men were, and tired as were
their leaders, they were still capable of clear decision and swift action. The
river was for the moment abandoned, the left of the line was swung south, and
early upon March 28 they faced north in this sector, along the track of the
Amiens-La F&egrave;re railway. Roughly, the new position may be traced as
follows:</p>
<pre>
R. - Warvillers. Vrely. Caix. Gillancourt. Wiencourt&mdash;Marcelcave. - L.
        24        8      50       66                  39
</pre>
<p>This very difficult-and remarkable disengagement was particularly trying for
the Thirty-ninth Division since it had farthest to go and was in close contact
with the enemy. It was carried out in broad daylight in the morning of March
28, and with such skill that there was no great loss in the 118th Brigade which
covered it, but so close was the enemy that both General Bellingham and his
brigade-major, Major F. Gunner, were captured while personally supervising the
withdrawal. After this operation the remains of the Thirty-ninth Division were
occupying the line from Marcelcave to Wiencourt inclusive, along the railway
track. Germans were found in Wiencourt, and the two brigades, now reduced to
two composite battalions under Colonel Saint, attacked them with success, but
eventually occupied a line to the west. All the guns had been saved and were in
action once more.</p>
<p>On the occasion of the reforming of the line as already described on March
28, the Fiftieth Division had fallen back upon Caix, where it held fast to the
important bridge across the River Luce upon which a number of troops from
various units were converging. Many of these were disorganised, and some, to
use the expression of a spectator, "stone-cold"; but the same witness has
recorded the splendid moral effect produced by one battalion which, marching in
fours and with everything in most precise order, came swinging down the road,
with no change after its seven days of purgatory save that two-thirds of its
personnel had disappeared. This was Colonel Hancock's 1st Battalion of Royal
Fusiliers from the Twenty-fourth Division&mdash;an object-lesson to all who saw
it as to how discipline can outlast the most terrific tests which a soldier can
be asked to endure.</p>
<p>The enemy, still working down from the north, had threatened the new
defensive flank at a point between Caix and Cayeux, but were held by a very
spirited attack made by the men of the 22nd Entrenching Battalion. With
considerable loss both to themselves and to the Germans, they held the line of
the river until reinforcements arrived. The Thirty-ninth from the north and the
Eighth and Twenty-fourth from the south were all converging upon the one point
to take up their new positions. A Brigadier in command of the infantry, with
800 men and 3 batteries, held the bridge; but the Germans might have rushed it
had it not been for a charge by the 151st Brigade, when the 5th and 7th Durhams
drove back their advancing line. This spirited attack was led by General
Jackson in person, who encouraged his men by blasts upon his hunting-horn.
Speaking of one of their military heroes, a French historian has said: <i>"Il
avait la graine de folie dans sa bravoure que les Fran&ccedil;ais aiment."</i>
All soldiers love it, and it is a wise leader who knows how to employ it. It
was a time when every possible device was needed to hold the men, for the enemy
was close upon the bridge, and the safety of the remains of several divisions
depended upon the bridge being held.</p>
<p>Returning to the general survey of the line of the Nineteenth Corps the
Sixteenth Division was now rather a crowd of warlike particles than an
organised unit. It was ordered, however, that every individual particle should
be reassembled at Hamel so that the nucleus of a division should exist once
more. Hard marching and hard fighting had reduced the Twenty-fourth Division to
almost the same condition, though, thanks to a miraculous survival of most of
the senior officers, the unit was still efficient. On the other hand, the
Sixty-first Division from the Eighteenth Corps, numbering at this period 2400
men, was given to General Watts to help to form his new line. It was at first
intended with the aid of these new troops to endeavour to clear the left flank,
and for this purpose a counter-attack upon Lamotte was ordered. The
newly-arrived men from the south, the 183rd and 184th Brigades, who could
hardly stagger a mile, did actually carry the twin village of Warfus&eacute;e
and hold the edge of it for a time under very heavy fire&mdash; an operation in
which Major Bennett of the Oxfords did conspicuously fine work. Several grand
soldiers fell in this attack, including Captain Willick who had commanded the
2/4 Berkshires after the fall of the heroic Dimmer. His last speech to his men
is worth recording. It was, "I know how you feel, boys, tired and worn out, but
we have to stop them from breaking through." The support to this brave attack
is said to have been "one gun, firing wildly."</p>
<p>The line sloped back now from Demuin in the south to the Somme at a point
opposite Sailly-le-Sec, the Sixty-first occupying the general sector just south
of the Lamotte-Amiens road. From there to the river had been a gap which it was
absolutely vital to fill. An old line of trench existed here, extending from
the river to Demuin, and early in the battle General Gough, amid all his
preoccupations, had realised that it might be of great importance to have ready
as a rallying place. He had therefore deputed General Grant, his own chief of
engineers, together with Colonel Harvey, his chief of staff, to organise it and
to endeavour to man it, with any spare troops that they could find. This had
been done, and after three days of feverish work, Grant had prepared a line and
had thrust into it a most curious assortment of all sorts of details, made up
of entrenching troops, American sappers, the staffs of various army schools,
reinforcing units, and stragglers. On the third day General Grant was recalled
to his official duties, but General Carey happened to be passing from the front
to take over a divisional command, and he was deflected and placed in charge of
this assembly of military samples, which included 500 cases out of hospital.
There was a sprinkling of machine-guns with trained instructors to use them,
but the line was thin and there was a want of cohesion in the elements which
formed it. The great thing, however, was that the gulf was spanned between
Watts in the south and Congreve in the north. There was still a trench and a
line of British soldiers between the Germans and the open country that led to
Amiens.</p>
<p>March 28 was a day of destiny along the line, for upon that date were the
first definite signs that the assault had failed so far as its ultimate
objective was concerned, and that the Germans were not destined to overcome the
British resistance. In the north, this was clearly indicated by the victory in
front of Arras. In the south, the situation was still obscure and dangerous;
but the mere fact that the day was got over without a catastrophe was in itself
a success, for on March 27 the prospects were very ominous. The line now ran
from Demuin to Marcelcave, and thence the improvised trench garrison carried it
on to the river. The First Cavalry Division, which had come across from the
north bank, formed a link between the Sixty-first in the north of Watts' line,
and what we will now call the Carey line. The cavalry men were still full of
fight, but they had done wonderful work since the first day of the battle,
cementing every weak seam, and they were terribly reduced in numbers if not in
spirit. Nothing can exaggerate the debt which the infantry owed to all three
divisions of cavalry for their tireless support during that awful week. They
now tried to advance towards Lamotte, but they came upon the right flank of a
very strong German force moving south-west from Cherisy, and though they
endeavoured to harass it they were unable to make much impression. The 61st was
also terribly worn. Upon this day the 184th Brigade lost Colonel Belton, its
fifth commander, and was taken over by Colonel Pagan of the Gloucesters. The
southern end of the British line had troubles enough before, but they were now
accentuated by the fact that the Germans had made a very rapid advance in the
Montdidier sector which placed them in the right rear of the Nineteenth Corps.
On this right flank there was much confused fighting, and a mixture of units
which reached such a point before the morning of March 29 that the
Twenty-fourth, or what remained of it, found that it had unwittingly changed
from the right to the left flank of the Eighth Division. There could perhaps be
no clearer illustration of the dimensions to which the division had shrunk.
These confused movements caused loss of touch, and there was a time when Corps
Headquarters had completely lost the right of the line, which was badly
disorganised. It was a time of great danger. Yet another division, however, the
Twentieth, was given to Watts, and though it was already worn to the bone, and
could not reckon a thousand men in all three brigades, it was still
battleworthy and formed an invaluable asset at such a time. They were lined up,
or perhaps dotted along would be a fitter term, upon the front of
M&eacute;zi&egrave;res&mdash;Demuin, and formed a frail barrier behind which
the hard-pressed men could have a brief breathing space while they endeavoured
to reform. By the late afternoon of March 28 this operation was in progress,
and before 11 P.M. the new positions were actually occupied. The line, which
was partly wired, now ran from M&eacute;zi&egrave;res, through Demuin,
Marcelcave, and Hamel to the Somme, but it would be hard to add the exact
alignment of the units, as in many places they were inextricably mixed. The
Sixty-first and the Cavalry had been placed behind Carey's line in order to
support it should it weaken. South of this was the Twentieth Division,
reinforced by fragments of other divisions, which among them had the strength
and spirit to beat off a strong German attack delivered by the force which had
been engaged by the cavalry in the morning. The country here was seamed by the
old French trenches, which were woefully out of repair but none the less were
of great value to the defence. Carey's force was involved in this German attack
on March 28, but with the help of the First Cavalry Division they managed to
hold their line. Upon that date the exhausted troops received the following
well-timed message from the Fifth Army Battle commander: "By the grand and
stubborn way you are holding out and delaying the advance of the enemy, the
British and French reserves are being given the necessary time to come up and
assume the offensive. Your great exertions and sacrifices are not being thrown
away: they are of immense importance, and your resistance and your deeds in
this great battle will live for all time, and will save our country."</p>
<p>March 29 was another eventful and critical day for the Nineteenth Corps, and
began badly for them, since the remains of the Eighth and Twenty-fourth
Divisions had, as already explained, been thrust out of their positions and
were mostly on the west side of the Avre and out of the line. The Fiftieth
Division was only partly in position, the fighting strength of the Sixty-sixth
was reckoned at 750 bayonets, and that of the Thirty-ninth at 500 bayonets. The
Nineteenth Corps at this moment was nominally composed of eight infantry
divisions&mdash;Eighth, Twentieth, Twenty-fourth, Sixteenth, Thirty-ninth,
Fiftieth, Sixty-first, and Sixty-sixth; but it is questionable whether their
united strength greatly exceeded that of a single full division, to such a
point had the army been reduced. On the other hand, there was no direct
evidence of excessive wastage upon the part of the Germans, who could be seen
in large well-organised bodies moving in front of the British lines. The one
consolation lay in the fact that their heavy guns, and even a good many of
their field-guns, had been left behind. The machine-guns, however, and their
newly-developed light field artillery were as energetic as ever. The British
artillery had been weakened by capture and destruction, but it was greatly
supplemented by several armoured-car batteries, Nineteenth Canadian and
British, which did splendid service during these all-important days.</p>
<p>About mid-day on March 29 the French, and the remains of the Thirtieth
Division under the French Higher Command, had abandoned M&eacute;zi&egrave;res
upon the right flank of the Nineteenth Corps, and by so doing they exposed the
right of the steadfast Twentieth Division. The fighting extended from the River
Avre to Demuin. The 59th Brigade, which was in the south of the line, was
forced to fall back, but two battalions of the 60th Brigade were thrown out to
cover the flank and hold the German advance from getting behind the British
line. At 2 o'clock these two brigades gathered their thin ranks together for a
counter-attack, aided by the Fiftieth Division, which had now been telescoped
into a single weak brigade. It was a remarkable attack, for most of the men
were stumbling with utter fatigue, and could hardly totter forward with their
rifles at the port. It was the Riflemen and Shropshires who made the advance
upon M&eacute;zi&egrave;res while their comrades stormed the surrounding woods.
The 5th Durhams, 6th Northumberland Fusiliers, and 22nd Entrenching Battalion
of the Fiftieth Division also did great things. There is evidence from the
prisoners that the Germans at that particular point had lost very heavily and
were much distressed, so that the combat was like those closing rounds of a
hard-fought boxing contest, where the two exhausted combatants can but push and
paw as they lurch against each other. The village was actually carried by the
British, and a temporary easement secured, together with a handful of the 352nd
Regiment, who stated that they had lost three entire companies in their first
advance upon M&eacute;zi&egrave;res. This spirited counter-attack was
Nineteenth covered by the guns of the Fiftieth Division which, under Major
Johnson, had worked very hard during those last trying days.</p>
<p>About 2 o'clock on March 29 Watts' Corps was reinforced by another skeleton
division, the Eighteenth &mdash; 2000 bayonets in all. It was merged with the
Sixty-first and placed in the Berteaucourt&mdash;Bois de Blangy line. The thin
ranks of the Twenty-fourth were still able to muster at the south end of the
position, but only one brigade of the Eighth Division, the Twenty-fifth, was in
a condition for service. This unit moved to the edge of Moreuil Wood, and
co-operated with the French One hundred and thirty-third Division which was
holding the line at that point. From this time onwards the
Moreuil&mdash;Ailly-sur-Noye road and everything south of it was French. As the
British force dwindled its front also contracted, otherwise the situation would
have indeed been impossible.</p>
<p>As it was, it continued to be desperately critical, for beyond the
telescoping of units and the contraction of front there was no help for the
British line, while the assailants were still very numerous and aggressive.
About noon on this day, March 29, the Thirty-ninth Division, and indeed the
whole army, sustained a severe loss in the person of General Feetham, a leader
of great valour and experience, who was killed by a shell while walking with
Colonel Gosset, his chief of staff, in the village of Demuin.</p>
<p>His death was to some extent revenged at once by his devoted troops, for a
German attack which followed at once down the valley of the Luce was driven
back with heavy loss by the rifles of the Nineteenth infantry. General Feetham
was replaced next day by General Blacklock. It is a remarkable fact that
Feetham was the second commander of the Thirty-ninth Division killed within a
fortnight, for General Cape, his <i>locum tenens</i>, fell upon the 13th of
March.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 30 the 61st Brigade of the Twentieth Division was on
the south end of the line covering the bridge over the Luce at Hangard, while
the 59th covered that at Dornart, the 60th lining up from Dornart to
Berteaucourt. The Fiftieth Division had been now incorporated in the-
Twentieth. All the bridges had been prepared for demolition. The enemy were
slowly pushing the French out of the Moreuil Wood upon the extreme right, small
bodies of infantry gradually infiltrating the whole position. The Germans soon
developed activity also in the Luce valley, and finally along the whole corps
front. The Second Cavalry Division was sent into Moreuil Wood to help the
French, but the whole right of the line began gradually to crumble in face of
the repeated assaults. The remains of the Sixty-sixth and Twentieth Divisions
were bent back, though the latter continued for a long time to hold the Demuin
&mdash; Marcelcave line of road, but about 8 A.M. the Sixty-sixth Division was
pushed out of Aubercourt.</p>
<p>There was some weakness farther north also, between Villers and Marcelcave,
but the never-failing First Cavalry Division stiffened the yielding line. At 10
o'clock the situation had improved in Moreuil Wood, where Seely's Canadian
cavalry, with the 3rd Cavalry Brigade in support, were making their presence
felt. They held the line along the edge of the wood from east of Moreuil, but
had lost touch with the Twentieth upon their left. Later in the morning there
was a strong German counter in this quarter which drove the cavalry back into
the wood. Here at a later hour they were reinforced by the Eighth Division, if
such a sonorous name can be given to a handful of dazed and exhausted men. The
line at mid-day ran roughly as follows:</p>
<pre>
Moreuil Wood.   Demuin.    W.of Aubercourt.  W.of Marcelcave.
  2nd Cav.    20th.  63th.     Carey.        61st.  1st Cav.
</pre>
<p>The great bulk of the British force lay to the north of the Luce River, and
the Germans were making every effort to push the flank backwards or aside and
to ford the stream. A wood named Little Wood lay in such a position as to help
or hinder such an attempt, and it was the scene of some fierce fighting. It was
first occupied by one of the enemy's advanced parties. It was then retaken by
some of the West Yorkshires of the 60th Brigade. These in turn were pushed out
by the enemy. Finally, in the. evening the 12th Rifles and 12th Rifle Brigade,
with some French and scattered units of the Fiftieth Division, charged forward
through the twilight, recaptured the wood, and re-established the whole line in
this quarter. Nine machine-guns and fifty-three prisoners were taken. Well
might General Watts telegraph: "Well done, the Twentieth! Such a counter-attack
after all your hard work is splendid."</p>
<p>Now at last there were signs of some relaxation in the dreadful strain. On
this, the ninth day of the battle, the first British reserves, save only the
Eighth Division, began to appear in the line. They were the 9th Australian
Brigade, who came into the fight between Demuin and Aubercourt with their usual
brisk gallantry. Their attack made some progress, and the 12th Lancers who
advanced with them shared something of the glory. Although the final objectives
were not attained, the line north of the Luce was stayed by their presence and
made firm for the morrow. On, this evening several of those heroic units which
had fought themselves to the last point of human endurance from the beginning
of the battle were taken from that stage where they had played so glorious and
tragic a part. The remains of the Thirty-ninth, the Fiftieth, the Sixteenth,
and the Sixty-sixth were all drawn back for re-organisation. It was theirs to
take part in what was a defeat and a retreat, but their losses are the measure
of their endurance, and the ultimate verdict of history upon their performance
lies in the one single undeniable fact that the Germans could never get past
them. Speaking of these troops an observer remarked: "They had been fighting
for nine days, but were very cheerful and still full of vigour." The losses of
some units and the exertions of the individuals who composed them can seldom
have been matched in warfare. The 2/6th Lancashire Fusiliers, for example, had
fought in the rearguard of the Sixty-sixth Division for the whole retreat under
Captain Porter, the only officer left standing. They were now reduced to about
a hundred men. Many battalions were in no better condition. Carey's nondescript
force was also broken up on the evening of March 30. They had served a most
useful purpose at a critical moment of the battle, and their formation may have
prevented a disaster, but it should be emphasised that their existence was not
impromptu, but had been pre-arranged by the wise foresight of General
Gough.</p>
<p>On March 31 there were signs that the German flood was reaching full tide.
They had acted to a wonderful degree up to their own saying: <i>"Immer fest
daran!"</i> but they had now far outstripped their artillery support and the
tenacious elastic British defence had worn them down. There was no attack on
the morning of this day, but about noon the fighting broke out once more in the
Moreuil Woods, the enemy pushing their way through them and slowly driving back
the line of the Eighth and the Twentieth, while the French were again driven
out of the village of Moreuil. North of Marcelcave there was a day of quiet and
re-organisation. The Sixty-first was still holding the
Berteaucourt&mdash;Gentilles line, while the Eighteenth was holding the line of
the Luce. In the evening the Eighth and Twentieth were again reinforced by the
cavalry, and by the superior and heroic exertions of every one concerned the
position on the right flank was maintained. The 2nd Berkshires distinguished
themselves in this fighting. There is something more than a name even in this
stage of the war in the old Regular battalions, for the chronicler finds that
they stand out amidst the other units out of all proportion to their numbers.
The 2nd Bedfords, 1st Royal Fusiliers, 2nd Scots Fusiliers, and many others
upheld the honour of the grand old force.</p>
<p>The right wing had been considerably hustled in the Moreuil quarter on March
31, but on April 1 the Second Cavalry Division, which included the Canadian
Brigade, made a sudden fierce counter-attack which threw the enemy back. Fifty
prisoners and thirteen machine-guns were the fruits of this action. The British
guns had played upon the wood during the whole night, and the enemy had
suffered severely, for the assailants found the brushwood to be full of dead
Germans. There was no other movement of importance on this day. The reformed
Fourteenth Division was brought back into the battle and took the place of the
Twentieth, the Fiftieth, and of the cavalry upon the front to the south of the
Luce. Speaking of the latter troops after their nine days of martyrdom, a
senior officer who saw them at this stage said: "In the last attack they were
driven back about a mile towards Amiens, but after the first Bosch onrush they
stood like rocks, repelling attack after attack, counter-attacking and
regaining ground in such a manner that every day I marvelled at the doing of
it, and at the men who did it."</p>
<p>April 2 and 3 were quiet days, but on the 4th there was a very violent and
general attack along the line of the Nineteenth Corps, and of the Thirty-sixth
French Corps (General Nollet) which lay to the immediate south. The main weight
of the battle fell upon the Fourteenth Division in their new positions, and by
nine o'clock in the morning the Germans had gained some success to the north of
the main Amiens road. The Australian 9th Brigade, which was south of the road,
held their line, but had to fall back 500 yards in order to conform with the
general position. At 11:30 the enemy was still making progress, mostly on the
front of the Fourteenth Division, and had reached the east edge of Hamel and of
Bois de Vaire. The Third Cavalry Division, those indomitable troops, were
thrown in to thicken the line of the Fourteenth, and the Canadian motor guns
from Villers-Bretonneux were also brought into the battle. Later two battalions
of the invaluable Australian infantry came up at the double from the 15th
Australian Brigade. If ever the arrival of strong loyal men in a time of
darkness brought joy and comfort with it, it was when the Australians relieved
the British line in these later days of the second battle of the Somme. "God
bless them!" was the silent prayer that went down the weary line. Ground had
been lost south of Villers-Bretonneux, and the line was bent, but the whole of
the Third and Fifth Australian Divisions were streaming down to their places in
the defence. The end of the retreat was at hand.</p>
<p>Upon the evening of April 4, the line which was to be permanent for many
months to come began to define itself, and order gradually evolved out of
ever-shifting chaos. Lee's Eighteenth Division was now in touch with the
Thirty-sixth French Corps at Hangard. Then at the Bois l'Abb&eacute; lay the
9th Australian Brigade. North of this, at the Bois de Gentilles, was the Third
Cavalry Division. Thence in succession came the 15th Australian Brigade, the
43rd Brigade, the remains of the Twenty-fourth Division, the 8th Australian
Brigade, the other elements of the Fourteenth Division, the Fifth Australian
Division near Aubigny, and the Fifty-eighth Division in the north. This summary
will show how Australia had braced the line. Upon the next day, April 5,
Butler's Third Corps took over the whole area of the Nineteenth Corps, and the
episode was at an end. The retreat of General Watts across the ravaged country,
his attempt to hold the long front of the Somme, his successive short retreats,
his continual stands, and his eventual success, will always remain one of the
most remarkable incidents in the war. This officer, who at the beginning of
hostilities was a "dug-out," hardly rescued from a premature ending of his
military career, showed in the highest degree those qualities of never
despairing, and of rapidly adapting means to an end, which mark the competent
soldier. He began with two units under his control, and he ended with fifteen,
but no general ever had to handle more weary troops, or had more need of a
clear head and a high heart. The strain upon him had been
extraordinary&mdash;though indeed that is true of every corps and divisional
commander in the line. As to the special features of this operation, it may be
said to be remarkable for the improvisations of troops, for the continual use
of entrenching battalions as combatants, for the work of the dismounted
cavalry, for the self-sacrifice and energy of the motor batteries, and very
specially for the degree of mobility attained by the heavy artillery and the
rapidity with which it came into action in successive positions. Military
critics will draw many deeper lessons from these operations, but these at least
are sufficiently obvious to catch the eye of the least experienced student.</p>
<p>The total losses of the Nineteenth Corps during this fourteen days of battle
came to from 35,000 to 40,000, killed, wounded, and missing. The losses in guns
were 41 heavy pieces and 73 field-guns, twelve of which were anti-tank guns in
the forward line. The pressure sustained by some of the divisions would be
incredible if the facts were not fully authenticated. Thus the Eighth English
Division was attacked from first to last by eighteen different German
divisions, including three of the Guards. Prisoners were taken from each so
that their identity could not be disputed. Yet this same Eighth Division was
engaged within three weeks in the victorious advance at Villers-Bretonneux. The
German oracle Clausewitz has said that a retreating army should go back not
like a hunted deer but like a wounded lion. His commentators would hardly find
a better example than the British armies in the second battle of the Somme.</p>

<h2><a id="chap6" name="chap6">VI. THE SECOND BATTLE OF THE SOMME</a><br>
The Retreat of the Eighteenth Corps, March 21-29</h2>
<p class="chaphead">Retreat of the Sixty-first Division&mdash;The Gloucesters
at Beauvais &mdash; Fall of Ham&mdash;Retreat of the Thirtieth and Thirty-sixth
Divisions&mdash;Great privations of the men&mdash;Fine feat at Le
Quesnoy&mdash;Summary of the experience of Maxse's Corps</p>
<p class="first">IT has been shown that Maxse's Eighteenth Corps, covering the
St. Quentin front, maintained its whole position on March 21, thanks to the
splendid conduct of the three battalions in the forward line, and to the stout
resistance in the zone of battle. It has also been told how the Sixty-first
Division, the most northern unit, withdrew on the afternoon of March 22, very
attenuated but still full of fight, to a prepared position between Vaux and
Villeveque.</p>
<p>At 4 P.M. that day the three brigades, or what was left of them, were in
line 1500 yards east of Beauvais, the 184th being in the centre, with the 182nd
on its right, and the 183rd on its left. As they faced their pursuers they
could plainly see the Germans pouring in successive waves from Atilly. The
central brigade was commanded by General the Hon. Robert White, one of two
gallant brothers who sowed their military wild oats in the Jameson Raid, and
this unit, reduced now to a mere handful of Gloucesters, Berkshires, and
Oxfords, was exposed to a scourging fire of shrapnel, which further thinned
their ranks, their General being one of the casualties. No field ambulances
were available at the moment, and as General White was led away badly wounded
he saw the German cavalry breaking into the south side of Beauvais, while a
large artillery dump west of the village was exploded by the enemy fire. The
whole situation was chaotic, but the British infantry still hung together,
retreating slowly and turning continually upon their pursuers. Some twenty
German aeroplanes were quartering the district like so many fierce hawks, and
diving with great daring from time to time into the very streets of the
village, while the British falling back into cover fired up at them with their
'rifles and light machine-guns. Two of them came crashing down upon the roofs
of the houses. It was rumoured that the enemy had already got close to Ham upon
the right rear of the division, and they were round the left flank in the
region of Holnon Wood. There was little artillery support available, for sixty
per cent of the forward guns had been taken or destroyed in Holnon Wood, and
the remaining batteries were getting away with their reduced teams, so that the
retreat of the infantry was correspondingly slow in order to cover the
withdrawal.</p>
<p>In the north the Scotsmen of the 183rd Brigade were moving back near
Villescholles in touch with the 72nd Brigade of the Twenty-fourth Division,
both of them being much helped in their retirement by the 11th Hussars. All
along the line the Germans were pressing very closely, but the Sixty-first kept
wonderfully steady, though at Beauvais, where Colonel Wetherall had taken over
the command when General White was wounded, the two parties were continually
intermingled, so ardent was the pursuit and so leisurely the retreat. So mixed
were the combatants that Major Howitt, brigade-major of the 184th, was dragged
out from among his men, and was in the hands of the Germans for some exciting
and instructive hours. "I must say the officers treated me well, though the
escorts were very rough," says he. "For all my hatred I could not help admiring
them intensely, for their deployment, discipline, and preparation were an
eye-opener. They extended into battle order with hardly a sound and lay down
preparatory for the next assault, bringing up mules dragging light
trench-mortars, machine-guns, and ammunition." Major Howitt finally broke away
from his escort, and by keeping so near to a burning ammunition dump that no
one dared to follow him, he succeeded in regaining his own lines.</p>
<p>The defence of the line in front of Beauvais was kept up with remarkable
tenacity and ended by 150 men of the 2/5th Gloucester battalion performing what
was an extraordinary feat, even in this war of miracles, for they held on to a
line 2000 yards in length until 3:30 in the morning of March 23, holding up the
whole German advance. All night the enemy tried to rush or to bomb this thin
line of determined men, but it was not until the cartridges ran low that the
British made their retreat, sneaking round the outskirts of the village which
blazed behind them, and making their way to Longuevoisin where they joined
their comrades, who had already given them up as lost, for they had been five
miles behind the army. Colonel Lawson was in command during this heroic
episode, and was ably supported by his two lieutenants, Rickerby and Dudbridge.
Of the latter, it is recorded that in a later stage of the retreat he was in
such a condition of absolute exhaustion that he was wounded three times in the
course of a single day without ever observing it until evening. Utter nerve
fatigue has its compensations as well as its terrors.</p>
<p>The Thirtieth Division had held on to its ground until four in the afternoon
of March 22. Some units lingered to cover the retreat, the 2nd Yorkshires and
the 17th Manchesters holding on to their redoubts until six o'clock, when they
were in danger of isolation.</p>
<p>During their withdrawal both the Sixty-first Division and the Thirtieth
Division to the south of it were covered by the 59th and 60th Brigades of the
Twentieth Division. These two fine brigades, still intact and full of fight,
allowed the weary soldiers to pass through their ranks, while they opposed a
tenacious resistance to the pursuing Germans. When the Sixty-first and
Thirtieth were across the canal of the Somme the covering division fell back in
orderly fashion, and itself crossed the canal between Canizy and Bethencourt,
the 60th Brigade being on the right and the 59th on the left. The 60th Brigade
was compelled to fight hard to make good its retirement, and it struck back
again and again at the German vanguard. In this fighting the 12th Rifle Brigade
particularly distinguished itself, but its losses were heavy, and included its
gallant Colonel, Maclachlan.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of March 23 it was known that the enemy had crossed the
line of the Somme at Ham. The Thirtieth Division had retreated upon the
important little town, which had been thrown into a state of defence by General
Stanley of the 89th Brigade, but his garrison was so utterly inadequate to
cover the ground that his dispositions were useless, as the Germans could get
round him on either side. He had with him in the first instance two entrenching
battalions, the 21st and 23rd, two companies of gas engineers, the corps
cyclists, and a mere handful of infantry. Late on March 22 he was joined,
however, by his own three attenuated battalions of the King's, each of which
had been heavily engaged in different parts of the battle. At the same time the
90th Brigade dropped back to the left of Ham and the 21st to the right. The
division was bare on both flanks, however, and it was determined to continue
the retreat. The bridges were blown up and such rolling stock as was possible
was destroyed, but there were very many stores in the town which had to be
abandoned to the enemy. It was a very great disaster, for it supplied him with
much, and indeed served him as an advanced base, all ready-made for his
operations in this part of the field. As to the loss of the river line, it has
already been explained that in these higher reaches it is a very slight
barrier.</p>
<p>When the enemy had taken Ham he pushed along swiftly towards Esmery-Hallon
on the heels of the retiring Thirtieth Division. The Thirty-sixth Division,
which had been assisted in its retreat by the 61st Brigade of the Twentieth,
had crossed the Somme to the east of Ham, and was now to the right of the
Thirtieth (right and left being used all through these operations on the
supposition that the unit is turning and facing the enemy). The Thirty-sixth
Division crossed the Somme Canal at St. Simon, closely pressed by the enemy,
and the 121st Field Company Royal Engineers and other sapper units performed
great work under heavy fire, destroying e no less than twenty-seven bridges.
After the passing of the river by the Germans there were constant rear-guard
actions, one of the most spirited of which was at Villeselve, where the 9th
Irish Fusiliers and the Royal Dragoons fought together and drove in the German
vanguard. The general situation of Maxse's Corps upon the forenoon of March 23
was that the Thirty-sixth Division was over the Somme and near Golancourt and
Bronchy, that the Thirtieth Division was dropping back upon Esmery-Hallon, and
that the Sixty-first Division, retreating in the direction of Nesle had crossed
the Somme at Voyennes and Offoy, continuing its retreat to the Nesle Canal.
Between the Thirtieth and Sixty-first Divisions were the 60th Brigade on the
right and the 59th on the left, who were also covering the Nesle Canal, but
were quite ready to counter-attack should an opening present itself.</p>
<p>A British corps does not allow itself to be driven without hitting back,
however great the odds may seem. A series of brisk skirmishes was going on all
along the line. In one of these, just south of Ham, Colonel Watson with the
17th Bang's Liverpools came back on his pursuers and held them up for a time.
More serious was the counter-attack organised by the main body north of
Esmery-Hallon. This attack struck southwards from Canizy and hit upon the right
flank of the Germans, staggering them for the instant. It was carried out by
the 60th Brigade and the 182nd Brigade, all under General Duncan of the former
Unit. This spirited advance was led upon the field by Colonel Bilton of the
Sixty-first Division, and was delivered with such force that this small British
detachment drove back for some distance the great army which was rolling
westwards. It was impossible, of course, to recover ground permanently, but it
gained invaluable time and eased the pressure upon the south end of the line
for the whole of a critical evening. It was clear, however, that the capture of
Ham and the crossing of the stream had turned the flank of the Twentieth and
Sixty-first Divisions, who were defending the higher reaches of the same river.
They were not to be frightened prematurely out of their positions, however, and
at Bethencourt the 11th Rifle Brigade drove back a German attempt at crossing,
while at Offoy the 12th Rifles also inflicted a sharp repulse upon the
pursuers. That evening, March 23, the Sixty-first Division was practically
amalgamated with the Twentieth, and both were concentrated near Nesle. They
received at this time a most useful reinforcement in the shape of two batteries
(16 guns) of Canadian motor machine-guns under Captain Meerling. There is not
an officer or man of these much-tried battalions who would not admit a deep
debt of gratitude to these splendidly efficient and energetic guns, which had
such mobility that they were always where they were most wanted. The troops had
on the morning of March 24 got behind the Somme Canal, which runs beside the
river, all bridges had been broken, and patrols were pushed across where
practicable so as to keep in touch with the enemy. It was not in this southern
area, however, but at Bethencourt that the Germans did actually get across in
force, by which they turned the flank of the 25th Brigade of the Eighth
Division in the north and of the 59th Brigade in the south. An attack was
instantly organised by the 11th Rifle Brigade, who had lost their Colonel,
Cotton, the day before, and were now led by Major Bertie. They succeeded by a
fine effort in driving the Germans for the time across the canal and gaining
touch with the Eighth Division. The Germans pushed across once more at Pargny,
upon the other flank of the Eighth Division, and also renewed their attempt in
greater force at Bethencourt, getting possession of the higher ground there.
This time it was the Highlanders and Royal Scots of the 183rd Brigade who
counter-attacked, acting as part of the Twentieth Division, and by half-past
two in the afternoon the position had once more been re-established. The
Canadian motor-guns were invaluable in this operation.</p>
<p>Upon the morning of March 24 the Sixty-first Division was barring the road
from Ham to Nesle. The German progress had been checked in this direction by a
spirited counter-attack carried out by the 5th Cornwalls, the pioneer battalion
of that division, together with a mixed array of police, bandsmen, and other
details, who advanced from Offoy to a depth of five miles, under Major Bennett.
This little improvised force held on all night, and seems eventually to have
joined up with the French in the neighbourhood of Esmery-Hallon.</p>
<p>The British were still holding the crossings at Voyennes and Offoy, but very
hard fighting had broken out to the south, and the Germans, who had poured over
in the neighbourhood of Ham, were now thrusting hard for Canizy. The road
bridges had all been destroyed, but there was a railway bridge at Ham which had
been taken out of the hands of the army authorities and left in charge of the
railway department. This was either uninjured or at any rate inadequately
destroyed, and was of immediate use to the enemy, enabling him to keep
uninterrupted pressure upon the retiring troops. Canizy was now taken, but the
12th Rifles made an immediate counter-attack and forced the Germans back from
the village.</p>
<p>In this spirited operation they lost their gallant Colonel, Moore, who had
led them with the utmost fearlessness.</p>
<p>Whilst the Germans were pushing forward at Canizy they had also maintained
strong and continuous pressure upon the Thirtieth Division near Moyencourt, and
upon the Thirty-sixth Division at Golancourt, causing the Ulster men, whose
left wing was entirely in the air, to fall back westwards. The next line of
defence, after the Somme had been forced, lies along what is called the
Libermont Canal between Nesle and Libermont. It was necessary to fall back,
fighting as best they could, and to place this obstacle, narrow as it was,
between the weary soldiers and their pursuers. It was the third day since the
men had had a decent meal or an uninterrupted rest, and they were very
disorganised and broken. "Hundreds of men were streaming back," says one
observer. "They had been without food for days and were done in completely.
They were stopped and reformed at the bridges, where as many as 2000 were
collected." It is such plain sobering sentences which help one to realise that
war is not, as large scale descriptions might seem to imply, a question of the
moving of pieces upon a board, but that underneath the strategy lie the
countless human tragedies, the tortured frames, the broken nerves, the prayers
of brave men that they may still be brave, the torturing anxiety of officers,
the ever-pressing burden which sometimes breaks the weary back which tries to
hold it. Strategy reckons nothing of these things, but their accumulation makes
up the terrible human tragedy of war, which brings humility to the most proud
and fear to the most valiant. All equally feel the weakness of nature, but he
is blessed who has the strength of spirit to cover and to combat it.</p>
<p>By mid-day on March 24 the Thirtieth Division was over the Libermont Canal,
holding from Buverchy to Libermont, with the village and bridge of Raincourt as
a joining point between the 90th Brigade to the north and the 89th to the
south. It may be recorded, to descend suddenly from divisions to individuals,
that the first sign of the new German advance was a single scout who appeared
in the open in front of the canal, and was engaged in a prolonged and
deliberate rifle duel by Lieutenant Harrop, with the result that he was finally
brought in as a wounded prisoner. The Twentieth Division had also fallen back,
the orders of brigades from the south being the 60th with its flank on
Buverchy, the 59th resting on Quiquery, and the 183rd to link up with the
Eighth Division near Mesnil St. Nicaise. The Thirty-sixth Division prolonged
the line to the south of Libermont. The French reinforcements from the south
were beginning by the afternoon of this day to get as far north as this
section, and if not very weighty at the moment they were of great moral use as
a promise for the future.</p>
<p>From the new positions of the British line the German infantry could now be
seen advancing in platoon columns in three lines on each side of the Voyenne
road and heading for the Libermont Canal. Second Several parties of horsemen
could be seen also, who Battle were conjectured to be battery staffs, keeping
up with the fight. The weak point was still near Bethencourt, between the
Twentieth and the Eighth Divisions, where the gap tended to be wider as the
enemy got more troops across and endeavoured to push the 25th Brigade north as
has been described in dealing with the experiences of the Nineteenth Corps.
They were reported before evening as having got as far as Morchain. The flank
brigade of the Eighteenth Corps, the 183rd, was ordered to extend as far to the
north-west as Potte in the hope of regaining touch, but though they reached
that village they were still unable to bridge the gap. During the night there
were heavy attacks upon Mesnil St. Nicaise in this region, which fell chiefly
upon the Rifle battalions of the 59th Brigade, which had been reinforced by the
20th Entrenching Battalion and the 1 1th Durhams, the divisional pioneer
battalion. The general result was to force the British line some little
distance to the westward. At Buverchy in the evening the German infantry also
advanced in great numbers, but came under the very efficient guns of the
Thirtieth Division, and lost very heavily. The enemy artillery was also very
active so that both the Thirtieth near Buverchy and the Thirty-sixth farther
south had many casualties. The French relief was making itself more felt,
however, in this southern section, where they were already outnumbering the
British. The latter were greatly worn&mdash;so much so that the 21st Brigade of
the Thirtieth Division could hardly be said to exist, only about 100 of the
Yorkshires being left in the line. By evening the centre chapter of the
position was near Moyencourt, some little distance to the west.</p>
<p>In spite of the French reinforcements, which were not accompanied with
artillery, the attack was still markedly stronger than the defence, so that
March 25 was a most dangerous and critical day in this quarter of the field. To
trace the developments from the north the enemy continued to press through the
gap between the two corps, the Nineteenth and the Eighteenth, making a series
of heavy attacks towards Mesnil-le-Petit and Nesle from the direction of Potte.
This movement, powerfully followed up, pushed back the left flank from Quiquery
to a point on the high ground 1000 yards west of Nesle. The 183rd Brigade,
which was now a mere handful of Scottish infantry, superb in quality but
reduced to the last stage of exhaustion, together with the thin ranks of the
59th Brigade of Rifles, could not, even with the aid of the Canadian
motor-guns, hold the heavy masses who pressed down upon them. The French One
hundred and thirty-third Division moving up in support had dug a line between
Billancourt and Herly, but Nesle was abandoned to the enemy, the Twenty-second
French Division retiring from this sector and falling back towards Roye. The
60th Brigade of the Twentieth Division, much helped by the 23rd Entrenching
Battalion&mdash;these valiant diggers made their presence felt all along the
line&mdash;still held stoutly to their positions from Quiquery to Buverchy, but
their left and left rear were so compromised that it was clear they could not
hold out longer. To the south the French, who had relieved the Thirty-sixth
Division at Libermont, had been pushed back, and the British position was
turned in their direction also. By the afternoon the French had taken over the
line as far north as Buverchy, and the Thirtieth Division was ordered to fall
back, but the Germans had advanced so rapidly from Libermont and got so far to
their Eighteenth right rear that it was no easy matter either for the British
or the French to get past them. Many had to swim the canals which striate this
part of the country, and the 2nd Bedfords were especially hard-pressed before
they were able to get away. The Twenty-second French Division was doing all it
could to cover the approaches to Nesle upon the south, and the 184th Brigade
cheered them loudly as they passed through their ranks. "They looked very fine
men and seemed very much for it." General Wetherall of this brigade was badly
wounded by a shell splinter in this period of the battle. And we have a vivid
pen-picture drawn by a spectator of Brigade-Major Howitt, some of whose
adventures have already been recorded, holding Wetherall' s wounded artery with
one hand, while he wrote brigade orders with the other, for more than two hours
on end. The 184th lost five commanders during the retreat.</p>
<p>Even if the local pressure had not caused a rapid withdrawal at this portion
of the line, it would have been enforced by the general strategic position, for
the German advance in the south had been so masterful that on this night of
March 25 Roye was taken, which is far to the south-west of Nesle. The 61st
Brigade had been sharing the hard fortunes of the Thirty-sixth Division, but
now, as the latter had been drawn out, it was restored to the Twentieth
Division. So severe had been the strain upon it that it only numbered about 500
bayonets, and some battalions, such as the 2/6th Royal Warwicks, had not a
single combatant officer left standing. None the less, it was at once sent to
man a supporting line stretching through Gruny, Cremery, and Liancourt, and had
hardly reached it before the Germans were also at Liancourt. The brigade held
them, however, and so enabled the front line to fall back upon an organised
position whence, on the next morning, a swift retreat became necessary.</p>
<p>After dark on March 25 the One hundred and thirty-third French Division had
come up to relieve the Twentieth and Sixty-first, but the situation was such
along the line of the Nesle Canal that no fixed line could be formed, and the
three divisions were finally greatly mixed up in the darkness and there was a
good deal of confusion in their councils, since the general directions of the
French were, to fall back to the south, while the line of retreat of the
British lay rather to the west. There was little time for deliberation, for
word had come in that the Germans were closing in upon Liancourt, pressing
south and west, in a way which threatened to cut off the whole forward line. At
midnight, the British, many of them hardly able to move for fatigue, staggered
off in such formations as they could assemble, with orders to concentrate north
and east of Roye. Thanks largely to the presence of the remnants of the 61st
Brigade near Liancourt, this most hazardous march was successfully
accomplished, but as Roye was within the grasp of the enemy the movement was
continued so as to reach a line between Hangest and Le Quesnel. The Germans
were close upon them in the north, so the 61st Brigade, now down to 400 men,
acted as flank-guard, fending off their constant attacks.</p>
<p>The war has shown few finer instances of disciplined and tenacious valour
than in the case of the three handfuls of men who represented what had once
been the 12th King's, 7th Somersets, and 7th Cornwalls. The enemy were in
Liancourt, and their patrols were in actual hand-to-hand fighting with a French
detachment aided by some of the Somersets. Other German troops pouring down
from the north and using to the utmost the gap which had opened between the
corps, endeavoured to cut in and to seize Le Quesnoy (not to be confused with
Le Quesnel, towards which the troops were marching). It was, however, upon
their line of retreat, and about halfway to their destination, so that a German
occupation would have been serious. The post was most desperately defended by
Captain Combe, the brigade-major of the 61st Brigade, with two Lewis guns and
100 men. Only eleven were left standing at the end of this defence, but the
village was held for the necessary time, and the survivors only withdrew upon
receipt of a positive order. Thus the flank march of the British from Roye to
Le Quesnel upon the morning of March 26 was successfully accomplished, owing to
the devotion of their covering party to the north. "It was very much of a
rabble," says an officer, "and there was great difficulty in sorting out the
men and arranging the units." None the less the future was to show that the
force was no more beaten than were the old contemptibles after Mons.</p>
<p>The Thirtieth Division had been drawn out of the line on the arrival of the
French, but they were hardly started on their movement towards the rest which
they had earned so well, when this great pressure arose, and every man who
could still carry a rifle was needed once more in the line. On the morning of
March 26 they were back then, between Bouchoir and Kouvroy. The 21st Brigade
had now entirely disappeared, but the remains of the 2nd Yorks and the South
Lancashire Pioneer Battalion were added to the 89th Brigade which was in the
north at Rouvroy, while the 90th, under General Poyntz, filled the gap to
Bouchoir. The Thirtieth Division had got considerably to the west of this line
before they were recalled, and it was only by some splendid marching that they
were able at last to throw themselves down upon the coveted ground before the
German armies, which were streaming along the Roye-Amiens road, were able to
reach it. As they faced the Germans the Twenty-fourth, now the mere shadow of a
division, was on their left at Warvillers, while the Sixty-first and Twentieth
were in support at Beaufort and Le Quesnel. Near Erches the Thirty-sixth Ulster
men, whose relief, like that of the Thirtieth, had proved to be impossible,
were still battling bravely, retaking the village of Erches after it had fallen
to the enemy. The 109th Brigade also distinguished itself greatly in this area,
the Irish Fusiliers Battalions of which it is composed holding on most
desperately to the village of Guerbigny, at the extreme south of the corps
front, and continuing a heroic defence during March 26, and long after it was
isolated upon March 27. The artillery of the Ulster Division was particularly
good in its covering fire during these operations, gaining the very grateful
acknowledgments of the French troops and generals who were more and more
concerned with this southern sector of the line. Speaking generally the troops
had now reached the region of the old French trenches, which grid-ironed a
considerable area of country, so that it was certain that if men could be found
to man them, the pursuit would no longer continue at the Battle pace of the
last two days.</p>
<p>Great work was done at this period by four of the Canadian motor-guns at the
cross-roads, north-west of Rouvroy, where they not only inflicted heavy losses
upon the enemy but delayed his advance while the exhausted troops were settling
down into this new position. Every hour was of importance as giving
reinforcements time to come up from the rear, and the general orders to the
divisional generals were to hold on at all costs wherever defence was possible.
A small body of corps cyclists under Lieutenant Quartermain co-operated
splendidly with the motor-guns and did good service at this critical period of
the retreat, during which there was very little artillery support behind the
thin line of infantry.</p>
<p>The German pressure on March 27 fell chiefly, as already shown, upon the
Twenty-fourth Division and the other units on the extreme south of the
Nineteenth Corps, which were forced back for some distance, and so threatened
the stability of the line in the south. The 17th King's Liverpool, which was
the flank battalion, held fast, however, and flung back their left to form a
defensive line to the north. A small body of German cavalry performed a
brilliant piece of audacious work in the darkness of the early morning of this
date, pushing through the outposts of the Thirty-sixth Division in the south
near Guerbigny, and capturing the Brigade Headquarters of the 109th Brigade,
and also the chief staff officer of the division.</p>
<p>The future was full of menace, for the Germans were pressing on in great
numbers. An observer near Bouchoir that evening (March 27) says: "I have never
seen so many Germans in all my life&mdash;one huge dark mass about a mile away.
With glasses one could see howitzers, machine-guns, trench-mortars, and field
batteries, as well as infantry. It was a most wonderful sight. They seemed to
be coming down the Roye road, then moving off to the south, and some stopping
in a mass."</p>
<p>The main German attack upon the extreme south of the corps line on March 27
fell upon the Thirty-sixth Division in the direction of Erches, with the result
that the Ulster men fell slowly back upon Arvillers, the 60th Brigade throwing
back a defensive flank to correspond. By 12:30 Bouchoir, held by the 90th
Brigade, was gained by the Germans, but the British formed a new line to the
immediate westward of the village. An attack upon Folies was thrown back by the
59th Brigade. Towards evening some order came out of a rather tangled position,
which may well be obscure both to writer and reader, since soldiers upon the
spot found the greatest difficulty in separating the various confused elements.
As night fell upon March 27 after much desultory and inconclusive local
fighting, there was no great change in the British line which ran from
Warvillers, still held by the Twenty-fourth Division, to the west of Bouchoir,
where the Thirtieth held the line, and down to Arvillers held by the 60th
Brigade of the Twentieth Division, which was temporarily out of touch with the
Thirty-sixth Division. Hangest was held by the Sixty-first Division, and Le
Quesnel by the Sixty-first and the French. That night the Twentieth Division
was ordered to join the Nineteenth Corps, and their record under this new
command will be found in the preceding chapter. One would have thought that
they had reached the limits of human endurance, and their total numbers were
not more than a thousand, and yet they were but at the beginning of a new
chapter in their glorious history.</p>
<p>The same words apply to their comrades of the Sixty-first Division, who were
also ordered north. They were relieved by the French at Arvillers, and this
portion of the line was on March 28 pressed back to the west of Hangest.</p>
<p>The removal of the Twentieth Division at so critical a time could only be
justified by the extreme and pressing need of the Nineteenth Corps, for it had
the effect of producing an almost impossible position for the line in the
south. Had it been possible to replace it at once with a solid French division,
it would have mattered less, but as matters stood the One hundred and
thirty-third French Division had itself been involved in the retreat and was
greatly worn. There was so little time also to get it into its new positions
that there was never any solid bastion upon that corner of the line. The result
was speedily seen in the morning of March 28, when the Thirtieth Division were
first subjected to a very heavy bombardment, and then looking south saw a
general retreat going on from Arvillers, while their left flank at Warvillers
was also very weak, since the Twenty-fourth Division was hardly strong enough
to maintain itself. By 2 P.M. both flanks were bare, and the enemy were well
round them in the north and in the south at Hangest. At one time it seemed
impossible for the division to get clear, and even now their extrication seems
miraculous to the officers who effected it. A rapid retreat was made through
M&eacute;zi&egrave;res and on to Moreuil, which only just avoided the closing
pincers of the German advance. The French, who were in the act of relieving the
Thirtieth Division, came away with them and had the same narrow escape. The
block upon the road which formed the only egress is described as having been
appalling, fugitives, refugees, and small disciplined columns of troops being
crowded together from one end of it to the other. "The men were excellent,"
says an officer of the Thirtieth Division. "Their discipline was not a bit
shaken." Such words, could not truthfully be said of every unit, and yet
soldiers can have seldom been more highly tried in any operation in history.
Even the Imperial Guard may reach its breaking point, as the retreat from
Moscow has shown. At Moreuil there is only one bridge, and had the German
artillery been able to find it the result would have been a Beresina. As it
was, the troops got across and speedily reformed upon the farther side of the
river Avre.</p>
<p>This may be taken as the limit of the retreat of the Eighteenth Corps, since
the stand in the north of the line and the thickening French resistance in the
south brought the momentum of the German advance to a halt. How terrible the
ordeal had been may be gathered from the fact that the Twentieth Division, as
already mentioned, was not more than 1000 strong, the Thirtieth Division about
2000 strong, the Sixty-first Division 2100 strong, and the Thirty-sixth
Division only a little stronger at the end of it. Again and again it had been
on the brink of absolute disaster, but always by the wise dispositions of
General Maxse and his divisional generals, seconded by the splendid tenacity of
his men, the worst consequences had been avoided. Rapid readjustments had been
needed, but a fatal break was always averted. The troops were handicapped in
every possible way, for not only was their artillery far below strength, but
for some reason the British Air Service during these days of stress was very
weak in this southern area, while the German machines were very numerous and
aggressive. The artillery officers were splendidly cool and efficient all
through, and in the case of the 92nd Brigade Royal Field Artillery near
Esmery-Hallon, it is said that the last gun was just 25 yards from the Germans
when it limbered up. For two days the whole corps artillery was with the
French, and did fine work with them, but to the great detriment of their own
infantry. Some of the batteries remained for a long time with the French, and
one French general has left it upon record that the failure of the Germans to
capture Moreuil on April 4 was almost entirely due to the splendid shooting of
the 306th Brigade Royal Field Artillery. After the first two days of the
retreat no guns were abandoned by the Eighteenth Corps. The total losses of
guns might be put at about 90 field pieces and 4.5 howitzers, with about 60
heavier pieces.</p>

<h2><a id="chap7" name="chap7">VII. THE SECOND BATTLE OF THE SOMME</a><br>
The Retreat of the Third Corps</h2>
<p class="chaphead">Movement across the Crozat Canal&mdash;Fight of the 173rd
Brigade&mdash;Forcing of the Canal Line&mdash;Arrival of the French&mdash;Fight
of Ffieres Wood&mdash;Splendid work of the Cavalry&mdash;Loss of
Noyon&mdash;Final equilibrium&mdash;General retrospect of the Battle</p>
<p class="first">WE shall now complete this slight survey of a vast subject by
following the fortunes of Butler's Corps upon the extreme right of the whole
British Army. It has already been shown that the condition of this corps at the
end of the first day of battle was most perilous, as its left flank in the
region of Essigny, where the battle zone of the Fourteenth Division had been
deeply pierced, was completely turned. The Eighteenth Division in the centre
had, it is true, retained its ground, but the left brigade of the Fifty-eighth
Division upon the right, the only brigade of that unit which was engaged, had
also after a very desperate resistance lost their front positions at Quessy
opposite to La F&egrave;re. Therefore orders had been given to draw off the
troops during the night of March 21 across the Crozat Canal, and a covering
line had been built up from the 54th Brigade, the Second Cavalry Division, and
the 12th and 18th Entrenching Battalions in order to hold the German pursuit
and to give the somewhat dishevelled troops time to re-organise their ranks. By
5 A.M. on March 22 they were over the canal and the bridges had been destroyed.
The artillery had been got over first to cover the crossings, and the 54th
Brigade, which had covered the rear of the Fourteenth Division, was lined up
from Jussy to Mennessis. The Eighteenth Division (less the 54th Brigade) fell
back in the line of Fri&egrave;res Wood, behind the canal. Many guns had been
lost but the cavalry had thrown the 3rd and 6th Brigades of the R.H.A. into the
firing-line to support the infantry, and two new batteries of the 96th K.F.A.,
only arrived the day before from England, came in at the nick of time.</p>
<p>It was of the first importance to destroy the bridges along the canal, but
this was found to be no easy matter. They had all been mined and prepared for
destruction some time before by the French, but either the lapse of time or
faulty material had caused such deterioration that the charges failed to
explode, and had to be renewed and discharged under circumstances of great
difficulty and danger. It was carried out none the less with great tenacity by
the British sappers, but several weak points remained, notably a canal lock
which had been so injured that the bed of the canal was exposed for some
distance. The railway bridges here, as elsewhere, were also a source of
weakness.</p>
<p>As the corps turned to face the enemy upon the south side of the canal the
general line of battle showed the 41st Brigade just south of St. Simon,
connected up on the left by the only surviving battalion of the 42nd Brigade
with the 61st Brigade of the Twentieth Division who were in support of the
Thirty-sixth Ulsters at that place. Then came 43rd and 54th Brigades, facing
Jussy and Mennessis with the 3rd and 5th Dismounted Cavalry Brigades in
support. South of this point were the 4th Cavalry Brigade, the 55th Brigade,
and the 63rd Brigade, all in the Fri&egrave;res area. Then came the 173rd
Brigade in the Vouel neighbourhood with the 18th Entrenching Battalion and the
6th Dismounted Cavalry Brigade. This force had already lost heavily, and many
of the men were suffering from gas, but they were sustained by the certainty
that French reinforcements would speedily reach them from the south, as a
system of mutual lateral support had been agreed upon between the
commanders.</p>
<p>A line of trenches had been begun in this neighbourhood by the French some
time before, and it had been carried on by Italian labour, but it was still
very unfinished, with many gaps, so that the tired soldiers had to lay down
their rifles and take to their trenching tools to get some cover. It was
already clear that they would need it, for with early daybreak on March 22 the
Germans showed that they had reached the north bank of the canal at Jussy. It
was again very misty, and they were able to bring up their machine-guns and
small artillery with perfect impunity and place them under cover. It was not
until between 10 and 11 A.M. that the mist began to lift, and the British
outposts peering through it could see the flash of the guns among the
plantations on the farther side. At an earlier hour the Germans had tried to
cross at Jussy, but had been driven back. It was already evident, however, that
they were in a position to repair the bridges in such a way as to find a
passage wherever they desired. The general situation might be described as a
curious reproduction of the first action of the war when the two armies lay
upon either side of the Mons Canal.</p>
<p>The French Sixth Army on the right had acted with loyal promptitudc, and the
One hundred and twenty-fifth Division, under General Diebold, was already
moving up from the south. One would have imagined that the most efficient
relief would have been to replace the two British brigades in the south of the
Oise, and so re-unite the Fifty-eighth Division. For some reason this was not
done, and General Worgan's 173rd Brigade continued to be a lone unit. A very
welcome reinforcement consisted of nine batteries of French 75's. It was
understood also that the whole Fifth French Corps, under General Pelle, was due
at Noyon that evening, and that the Third British Corps would be relieved by it
as soon as possible, but further help was slow in materialising.</p>
<p>At about 1 P.M. on March 22 the enemy made their first crossing of the canal
in the region of the 173rd Brigade. They advanced from Fargniers in the
direction of Tergnier village. The range of vision in this water-sodden region
was not more than fifty yards, which greatly handicapped Colonel Dervicke-Jones
of the 8th London, who was in local command of this sector, as it put his
machine-gun defence out of action. The troops were spread over a front of 3000
yards, so that the various companies were widely separated. The first German
advance was made across a lock gate by a number of men dressed in the uniforms
of some of the 1st London, taken the day before&mdash;a ruse which was the more
successful as a number of genuine stragglers had actually been coming in in
this fashion during the morning. An attack followed during which C Company of
the 8th Londons, while holding the enemy in front, were attacked by these
pretended comrades upon the right rear, so that they were almost entirely
destroyed. A road was thus opened across the canal, and the enemy opened out
both north and south of the Quessy-Tergnier road, cutting off those of the 3rd
and 8 th March 22. London who were on the farther side. These men fought to a
finish, and only a few of them ever got back. Colonel Dervicke-Jones had taken
up a position in an old French reserve line called the Butt line, with two
companies of his battalion and some machine-guns, and was able to hold up the
enemy all day in his immediate front, and to prevent several battalions from
deploying out of Tergnier. The artillery also got on to the German infantry in
this part of the field with good results. This Butt position was maintained
until the morning of March 23. Farther up the line, in the region of the
Fourteenth Division, other troubles had developed, and the pressure of the
enemy was great. At 4:30 P.M. the defenders were reinforced, but the enemy were
already across at several points and were advancing upon Cugny. There was
desultory fighting along the whole corps front, and though there was promise of
immediate French relief, no French troops seem to have been actually engaged
upon March 22. About 6 o'clock in the evening the enemy was across at Jussy
Bridge and also at Montague, but a fine counter-attack was made at this point
by the 7th Bedfords and 6th Northamptons of the 54th Brigade, aided by the 16th
Lancers, which drove the German infantry across once more and caused
considerable losses. In spite of this success the general situation upon the
evening of March 22 was not cheering, and the task of the Third Corps which had
been ordered to stand fast and form the southern hinge upon which the whole
retreat should turn, was clearly a very difficult one. It was the more
alarming, as the rapid progress of the enemy at Beauvais and Vaux at the centre
of the army led to a demand for cavalry which could not be complied with
without denuding the line to a dangerous and almost impossible extent.</p>
<p>It was soon clear on the morning of March 23 that the Butt position on the
right could not be maintained. The French had taken it over, but they were
unable to hold it. A line was built up near Noreuil, where the remains of the
8th and 3rd Londons, aided by some French details, endeavoured all day to check
the German advance. The main attacks were driving down from the north, and were
heralded by a very severe machine-gun barrage, which rained bullets over the
British position. The defence was much aided by a French armoured car upon the
Quessy-Rouez road, and by a battery of 76's. The 4th London were to the south
of the village and less exposed to the force of the advance. About six, after
an hour of intense shelling, the Germans closed in upon Noreuil, the defenders,
after a stout resistance which occasionally came to hand-to-hand fighting,
being driven westwards. Colonel Burt, commanding the 6th Cavalry Brigade,
barricaded his headquarters in the village and held the Germans off a long time
by his deadly fire. It was not until long after the lines had been withdrawn
that this brave officer had to be specially summoned to leave his post and fall
back on Chaimy. Finally, the retreat became general, but was rallied at the end
of the Noreuil valley, where some 200 men collected, and with a good field of
fire to help them, remained for some time on the defence. Late at night this
small force was ordered to fall back to a new line at Chauny. Battle</p>
<p>It has already been stated that two companies (C and D) of the 8th London
(Post Office Rifles) had been cut off when the Germans got across the lock-gate
on the afternoon of March 22. These men, under Captain Gunning, had made a
remarkable defence, crawling out with Lewis guns on to the lock-gates in order
to enfilade the advancing Germans. In the afternoon of March 23 they found
themselves with the Germans on three sides of them and the canal on the fourth.
Captain Gunning and Captain Kelly with the survivors then fought their way
through to Condren, where they still continued their resistance. These
soldiers, who made so admirable a resistance, were largely men who had been
combed from the Army Service Corps.</p>
<p>Whilst the 23rd of March had brought this heavy fighting to the 173rd
Brigade, it had been a day of severe trial to all the other units of the corps
front. The 54th Brigade was still covering the crossing at Jussy and Montague,
but the pressure was rapidly increasing as fresh German divisions made their
presence felt. The situation was the more serious as General Butler already
knew that the enemy were across the canal at Ham and had turned his left flank,
but it was still hoped that a counter-attack in this quarter might throw him
back, and so it was determined to hold on to the line. An emergency force of
odds and ends, dismounted troopers, labour men, and returned leave men were
gathered together at Crisolles and placed under the command of General Harman
to co-operate with General Greenly who now led the remains of the Fourteenth
Division, in guarding the left wing. Meanwhile there was very brisk fighting at
Jussy, where the German infantry had once again, under the cover of many guns,
got a footing upon the south side of the canal. They were at once vigorously
attacked by a small body of the 11th Royal Fusiliers and of the Scots Greys and
penned up in the village of Jussy. At 11 A.M. the Germans had also got across
at Mennessis, but came under the fire of four machine-guns of the Canadian
Mounted Brigade which inflicted heavy losses upon them. None the less at a
second effort the Germans were across once more, driving back by the weight of
their attack the worn ranks of the 7th Bedfords and of the 9th Scottish Rifles.
At 11:30 they were half a mile south of Jussy, and might have got round the
flank of the Bedfords but for the interposition of 200 Canadian dragoons.
"These grim, square-faced men, with their parchment skins and their granite
features, were a glad sight to our weary eyes," says one who was fighting
beside them. There was a time when it was doubtful whether in this quarter
there was anything but a line of dismounted troops between the enemy and
Paris.</p>
<p>Every man who could be spared was hurried up to hold the weak points of the
line, including the 8th Sussex, the pioneer battalion of the Eighteenth
Division, the rest of the Canadian Cavalry Brigade, and the 7th Cavalry
Brigade, but the mischief had gone too far, and the situation upon the right of
the line was even worse than at Jussy. The counter-attack of the French One
hundred and twenty-fifth Division in the direction of Tergnier had not been a
success, which is not to be wondered at, for the French infantry had come fast
and far, their ammunition was not plentiful, and they were working over strange
ground against an aggressive and victorious enemy. Next to the French on that
front was the 7th Queen's. Colonel Bushell found himself at one period in
command of the left of the French as well as of his own Surrey men, and he led
on this mixed following under an intense fire, being himself severely wounded
and yet rallying them again and again. Little progress could be made, but at
least he held the line firm for a time. This gallant colonel, after having his
wound dressed, returned to the field of battle, fell insensible, and had at
last to be carried off. Next to the 7th Queen's was the 8th East Surreys (both
of 55th Brigade), which was also in the thick of the battle, as was the
neighbouring 12th Entrenching Battalion. This line made a very fine resistance,
but was slowly pressed back by weight of numbers until at 4 P.M. they were on
the line Noreuil&mdash;Fri&egrave;res&mdash;Faillouel, to the left of the spot
where the 173rd Brigade was still holding its ground. The remains of the 7th
Buffs fell back also with the rest of the 55th Brigade, fighting hard, through
Fri&egrave;res Wood, where to the south-west of the wood they found some old
French trenches, in which, with the aid of the survivors of the Queen's, they,
under Colonel Ransome, organised a line for the rest of that arduous day. This
resistance held up some strong drives of the enemy which were evidently
intended, in conjunction with the attack from Jussy in the north, to cut off
all the troops in the woody country round Fri&egrave;res, and it acted as a
most efficient screen during the withdrawal of the rest of the line.</p>
<p>The whole eastern limit of the British area was spotted at this period by
small bodies of men who were working desperately to keep the German infantry
from sweeping in from that side. At Noreuil, as has been shown, were the
remains of the 173rd Brigade. At Fri&egrave;res Wood were the decimated 55th
Brigade. Opposite Jussy were the 54th Brigade and the dismounted cavalry,
slowly retiring before the ever-increasing pressure. In between these organised
bodies were many smaller units all striving hard for the same end. Among these
may be mentioned two companies of sappers, 80th and 92nd Field Companies R.E.,
who were extended upon the road north of Noreuil in touch with the 173rd
Brigade on one side. These valiant men not only held their position all day,
but actually made a counter-attack under Lieutenant Richardson in the evening,
when they advanced until they were nearly surrounded. Finally they fought their
way back to the Caillouel area.</p>
<p>As evening drew in the situation had become more and more difficult. The
enemy had been driving in from every quarter all day without a respite, and the
troops, many of whom had been engaged for more than two days without a moment
for rest or re-organisation, were in a great state of exhaustion. Only a
handful of several battalions remained as a fighting force. The confusion was
made worse by the fact that the light blue uniforms of the French were mistaken
for the grey of the Germans, so that misleading and alarming reports were
continually brought in to the commanders. All reserves were in the fight, and
the need of relief was urgent. About 4 o'clock the Faillouel position was found
to be no longer tenable, and the troops fell back through the village, which
was immediately occupied by the enemy who were pushing up their troops in
motor-lorries in this quarter. By 5 o'clock the right wing had come back 500
yards, and by evening the main position was at Caillouel, when the 54th
assembled, numbering 650 bayonets all told, the three battalions of Bedfords,
Northamptons, and Royal Fusiliers being each a little over 200 strong.
Detachments of the Scots Greys and 20th Hussars joined them at that
village.</p>
<p>The 53rd Brigade, fighting upon the left of the 55th Brigade^ was as heavily
engaged on March 23 as the other units of the Third Corps on the south side of
the canal. At noon they had lent the 10th Essex to support their neighbours,
and they consisted henceforth of only two weary battalions, the 6th Berks and
7th West Kents. At 3 o'clock in the afternoon they were heavily attacked and
were pushed slowly back, struggling hard to keep the line. Major Tween led a
counter-attack of his battalion headquarters, and checked the German advance at
a critical moment, but was mortally wounded in the gallant endeavour. The two
battalions were so weak that they had been telescoped into one, but good steel
remains tough be it ever so thin, and the line still held. At 5:30 the 9th
French Cuirassiers, long-booted giants, came up to help them, as did the 79th
Field Company and various small details. At 7 the remains of the 55th Brigade
were falling back through their ranks. When they had passed, the 53rd was also
withdrawn as far as Commenchon, while the 55th reassembled at Bethencourt to
the north. Three gallant Cuirassier regiments of the 1st French Cavalry
Division covered the rear. All the troops that night were worn to rags, for it
is to be remembered always that the great local disparity of force enabled the
Germans to bring up perpetually lines of perfectly fresh men with a new impetus
and inspiration, against men, many of whom had been gassed on the first day,
and who were now weary to death and hardly able either to stand or to think, to
order or to understand an order. On the whole long, tormented, struggling line
there was no time or place where the pressure was greater than here. In spite
of all the ardour of the attack the stubborn constancy of the defence may be
measured by the fact that, save for one battery which was destroyed by
shell-fire upon the afternoon of the 23rd, no guns were lost in this corps
either upon March 22 or 23. On the other hand, so great had been the
destruction of machine-guns, especially upon the first day, that only two were
left out of forty-eight in the Eighteenth Division, though these were augmented
by six new ones on March 24.</p>
<p>The Sixth French Army, on the right of the British, was doing all it could
to send up help, but it seems certain that none of this force was actually
engaged before March 23, though it is stated upon good authority that in the
liaison plans of the army the aid from the south was promised for the very
first day. Any delay was not due to want of energy or loyalty of officers and
men upon the spot. By the evening of March 23 the French units in the
fighting-line were the One hundred and twenty-fifth Division, which made the
unsuccessful counter-attack towards Tergnier, the First French Dismounted
Cavalry Division, who fought side by side with the Eighteenth British Division,
the Ninth and the Tenth French Divisions, both of which were on the extreme
left of the Third Corps, and can hardly be said to have been engaged. As the
French troops were now predominating in this sector, the command passed on the
evening of March 23 to General Humbert, a dark, wiry little French veteran,
commanding the Third Army. General Butler continued, of course, to command his
own corps.</p>
<p>On the morning of March 24 the situation to the south of the Crozat Canal
was as follows. The Fifty-eighth Division still held its original line from
Barisis to the Buttes de Rouy, with a party holding the bridgehead at Condren.
Then on the general line north and north-east of Chauny were the broken but
indomitable remains of the Londoners of the 173rd Brigade, mixed up with
fragments of the French One hundred and twenty-fifth Division, the 18th
Entrenching Battalion, and troopers of the 6th Dismounted Cavalry Brigade,
together with the dust of smaller broken units. Up to La Neuville was covered
by the worn brigades of the Eighteenth Division supporting the French
Cuirassiers. North of that was the 326th Regiment of the Ninth French Division,
and north of that what was left of the British Fourteenth Division up to a
point within a mile of Cugny, which was in German hands. On the extreme left
flank on this sector the Thirty-sixth Division and the 61st Brigade were in
Ollezy and Eaucourt. There had been some fighting on the front of the
Fifty-eighth Division during the night, but otherwise it was quiet, and the
soldiers were able to snatch a few hours of sleep.</p>
<p>Once again there was a thick morning fog, under cover of which the German
infantry broke suddenly upon the One hundred and twenty-fifth French Division,
north-east of Chauny, driving them back towards Abbecourt. This placed the
British troops at Condren in a perilous position, but it was essential to hold
the line of the Oise, and any abandonment of the bridge would have been fatal.
The Fifty-eighth Division was ordered to stand fast therefore, and the 173rd
Brigade was reinforced by the 16th and 18th Entrenching Battalions. These
entrenching battalions are, it may be remarked, entirely apart from the Labour
Corps, and were soldiers, well officered and organised, formed from those units
which remained over after the re-organisation of the three-battalion brigades.
Apart from these were the labour battalions who also in those hard days were
occasionally the final weight which tilts the balance where the fate of armies
and finally of empires was in the scale. Manfully they rose to the occasion,
and the Empire owes them a very special word of thanks. During the afternoon
all the British and French troops in this quarter passed over the Oise, mostly
in the Abbecourt district, blowing up the bridges behind them and passing under
the command of General Duchesne of the Sixth French Army. This left a blank
upon the right of the Eighteenth Division upon the north of the river, but
General Seely brought up his cavalry and endeavoured to cover it, while the
Second Dismounted Cavalry Division was pushed out upon the left of the
Fourteenth Division in the north, to preserve the connection between the Third
and Eighteenth Corps. The Third Cavalry Division under General Harman was
thrown in also at this point, and about 2:30, having mounted their horses, they
charged most gallantly in order to re-establish the line north of Villeselve on
the front of the Ulster Division. The Royal Dragoons were prominent in this
fine charge in which they sabred many of the enemy, took over 100 prisoners,
and relieved the pressure upon the Irish Fusiliers of the 109th Brigade at a
time when it was very heavy.</p>
<p>The whole corps front was slowly falling back during the day, partly on
account of the steady pressure of the German attack and partly in order to
conform with the line to the north. The Fourteenth Division, moving south-west
through Crisolles, found itself in the evening on the west side of the Noyon
Canal, covering the two crossings at Haudival and Beaurains. A vamped-up
detachment of stragglers and nondescripts under Colonel Curling were placed to
fill up the gap between the Fourteenth Division and Noyon. The left of the
Fourteenth Division at Guiscard was covered by General Harman's detachment, and
it is characteristic of the adaptability of the British soldier that seventy
Northumberland Hussars who had become cyclists were suddenly whipped off their
machines, put upon horses and sent up to reinforce the thin ranks of the
cavalry.</p>
<p>The centre of the line covering Caillouel was held all day by the Eighteenth
Division, with the First French Cavalry Division still acting as a breakwater
before the advancing flood. In spite of the gallant Cuirassiers the pressure
was very great from the 54th Brigade who were in the north, through the 55th
and down to the 53rd, which covered the north of Noyon. Some of the edge was
taken from the German attack by the efficient work of the 82nd Brigade Royal
Field Artillery and the 3rd and 5th Royal Horse Artillery, who were hard at it
from morning to night. The French infantry on the left of the Eighteenth
Division lost Guivry towards evening, but they held fast to Beaugies until
after nightfall. About ten o'clock, however, the German infantry was into
Beaugies, and the situation became dangerous as they were getting round the
left flank of the Eighteenth Division, so that there was a general retreat to
the rearward position called the Crepigny Ridge, which was not fully reached
and occupied until 3 A.M. on March 25. That evening the Fifty-eighth Division
reported that early in the day they had blown up all bridges and also the Royal
Engineer dump at Chauny. So intersected is the whole country at the back of the
line of the Fifth Army by watercourses, that the total number of bridges blown
up during the retreat amounted to about 250; and only in two cases, that of the
Ham road bridge and that at Chipilly, was the result unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>In the early morning of March 25 the Germans, who were still marching
rapidly and fighting hard, were close to Guiscard, pushing on so swiftly that
special troops had to be detailed to cover the heavy guns. General Butler had
so far as possible pulled his dismounted troopers out of the fight and had
restored them to their proper role, so that now he possessed a force of about
2000 horsemen, who were ready to execute the all-important functions of mounted
infantry, so invaluable in a retreat. Under Generals Greenly and Pitman these
horsemen did great work during the remainder of the operations.</p>
<p>Since the German pressure was still very heavy and the enemy were sweeping
onwards in the north, it was necessary to continue the withdrawal of the line
north of the Oise, while holding fast to the southern bank along its whole
length. The first movement in this withdrawal was to the line
Mondescourt&mdash;Grandru, and the second to the line Appilly&mdash;
Baboeuf&mdash;Mont de B&eacute;th&eacute;ricourt. By 8:30 the Eighteenth
Division in the middle of the line was effecting this retirement, the northern
flank, which was the post of danger, being covered by the 11th Royal Fusiliers
of the 54th Brigade. It was a most difficult and delicate business with the
enemy pressing down continually through the woods and villages with which the
country is studded. On the south the 53rd Brigade and the French Cuirassiers
were withdrawing through Mondescourt in some disorder. When the troops were
rallied and rearranged, there were no French troops upon the right. At 10 A.M.
the 54th Brigade had reached the Grandru position, but were out of touch both
with the French on their left and with the 55th Brigade on their right. They
therefore continued to fall back upon B&eacute;thencourt. At 1 o'clock a strong
German infantry attack, in many lines, developed upon the right near Appilly
and a heavy machine-gun barrage burst out over the 53rd Brigade and their
immediate comrades upon the right, the 289th French Regiment. Up to 3 o'clock
the Allies in this quarter were retiring under a very heavy fire, much helped
by four valiant cars of the French Cavalry's Mitrailleuses Automobiles, who did
splendid service in covering the exhausted infantry. The German infantry,
pressing eagerly forward in expectation of that general debacle which never
occurred, was riddled by the fire of these motor-guns and left swathes of dead
behind them. The attack had the effect, however, of driving back the Allied
line to such a point that a French force which was defending Mont
B&eacute;th&eacute;ricourt was entirely isolated and in great peril of
destruction. Under these circumstances the French officer in command appealed
to General Sadleir-Jackson of the 54th Brigade to make a great effort to rescue
his imperilled men. Sadleir-Jackson without hesitation led back his men into
the village of Baboeuf, cleared it of the Germans, captured ten machine-guns
with nearly 300 prisoners, and regained touch with the French, who were enabled
to withdraw. The 7th Bedfords and 11th Royal Fusiliers were the heroes of this
chivalrous exploit, where we were able to repay the loyalty which the French
have so often shown to us. It should be added that a company of the 12th
Entrenching Battalion, which like all the other entrenching units had gone
through this severe infantry fighting without light artillery, signals, or any
of the ordinary adjuncts of well-equipped infantry, was still so full of
military spirit that without orders it joined in this victorious charge.</p>
<p>On March 25 the Germans were within shelling distance of Noyon, and the
British evacuated successfully nearly 2000 wounded from that town. The
counter-attack of the 54th Brigade had stopped the German advance for a time,
and the Eighteenth Division w^as able to get across the river Oise, the guns
and transport passing in the afternoon while the infantry got across that night
and in the morning of March 26, without serious molestation, being covered by
their sappers and pioneers, who blew up the bridges as soon as the troop's were
safely across. At two in the morning of March 26 the French abandoned Noyon. At
this time there were no British troops upon the north of the river save the
remains of the Fourteenth Division which were finally relieved upon this date,
and the Second and Third Cavalry Divisions, now under Generals Pitman and
Portal, who harassed the German advance at every opportunity, and rendered
constant help to the French rearguards. The Second Cavalry Division secured the
high ground immediately west of Noyon, and held it until it could be handed
over to the French infantry. The general line of the cavalry was facing
north-east from west of Noyon, through Suzoy to Lagny, where they were in touch
with the Tenth French Division. The left of the Second Cavalry Division had
been prolonged by the addition of the Canadian Dismounted Brigade. These men
soon found themselves involved in some hard fighting, for the Germans attacked
the French at Lagny and drove them out. On one occasion this day, at the Bois
des Essarts, the troopers of the Second British Cavalry Division galloped
through the French infantry to hold off the attacking Germans, an episode in
which Lieutenant Cotton and other officers gained the honour of mention in the
French order of the day. The left of the cavalry was compelled to fall back
finally to Dives, and the Canadians after a determined struggle were driven out
of the woods which they occupied. Finally, the 3rd Cavalry Brigade
(Bell-Smyth), consisting of the 5th and 16th Lancers with the 4th Hussars were
nearly surrounded, and had the greatest difficulty in fighting their way out.
Before night they were in touch once more both with the French and with their
comrades of the 4th Brigade. On the morning of March 27 word came that the
British cavalry was imperatively needed at the junction between the French and
British, armies. It was despatched forthwith to do splendid service in the
north after having played a glorious part in the south.</p>
<p>From now onwards the fighting upon the Roye and Montdidier front (both towns
passed soon into German possession) was no longer connected with the Third
Corps. The position to the south of the Oise showed that the Fifty-eighth
British Division held from Barisis to Manicamp. Thence to Bretigny was the One
hundred and twenty-fifth French Division. Thence to the east of Varennes were
the Fifty-fifth French Division, with cavalry, and the First French Division up
to Sempigny. Thence the line ran in an irregular curve through Lassigny to
Canny, the enemy being well past that line on the north, and the direction of
attack being rather from the north-west. On the morning of March 28 orders were
issued that the remains of the Third Corps should be transferred to the north,
where they should join their comrades of the Fifth Army, from whom they were
now separated by a considerable distance. Within the next two days, after some
difficulties and delays in extricating the artillery, these orders were carried
out, though it was not till some days later that the Fifty-eighth London
Division could be relieved. This unit had not, save for the 173rd Brigade, been
engaged in the recent fighting, but it had held a line of over ten miles of
river, along the whole of which it was within touch with the enemy. One effort
of the Germans to get across at Chauny on March 31 was met and repelled by the
16th Entrenching Battalion, who killed many of the assailants and captured
nearly 100 prisoners.</p>
<p>So ended the vicissitudes of the Third Corps, which had the strange
experience of being swept entirely away from the army to which it belonged, and
finding itself under French command, and with French troops fighting upon
either wing. Its losses were exceedingly heavy, including 20 heavy and Third
100 field-guns, with about 15,000 killed, wounded, or missing. The Fourteenth
Division was the chief sufferer with 5880 casualties, 4500 of which came under
the head of "Missing," and represent the considerable detachments which were
cut off in the first day of the battle. The losses of some of the battalions
approached annihilation. In spite of all pressure and all misfortunes there was
never a time when there was a break, and the whole episode was remarkable for
the iron endurance of officers and men in the most trying of all
experiences&mdash;an enforced retirement in the face of an enemy vastly
superior both in numbers and in artillery support. When we realise how great
was the disparity it is amazing how the line could have held, and one wonders
at that official reticence which allowed such glorious epics to be regarded as
part of a great military disaster. Against the two and a half British divisions
which were in the line on March 21 there were arrayed seven German divisions,
namely, the Fifth Guards, First Bavarians, Thirty-fourth, Thirty-seventh, One
hundred and third. Forty-seventh, and Third Jaeger. There came to the Third
Corps as reinforcements up to March 26 two British cavalry divisions, one
French cavalry division, and three French infantry divisions, making eight and
a half divisions in all, while seven more German divisions, the Tenth, Two
hundred and eleventh, Two hundred and twenty-third, Eleventh Reserve, Two
hundred and forty-first, Thirty-third, and Thirty-sixth came into line, making
fourteen in all. When one considers that these were specially trained troops
who represented the last word in military science and efficiency, one can
estimate that an unbroken retreat may be a greater glory than a victorious
advance.</p>
<p>Every arm&mdash;cavalry, infantry, and artillery&mdash; emerged from this
terrible long-drawn ordeal with an addition to their fame. The episode was
rather a fresh standard up to which they and others had to live than a fault
which had to be atoned. They fought impossible odds, and they kept on fighting,
day and night, ever holding a fresh line, until the enemy desisted from their
attacks in despair of ever breaking a resistance which could only end with the
annihilation of its opponents. Nor should the organisation and supply services
be forgotten in any summing up of the battle. The medical arrangements, with
their self-sacrifice and valour, have been already dealt with, but of the
others a high General says: "A great strain was also cast upon the
administrative staffs of the army, of corps and of divisions, in evacuating a
great mass of stores, of hospitals, of rolling stock, of more than 60,000
non-combatants and labour units, while at the same time supplying the troops
with food and ammunition. With ever varying bases and depots, and eternal rapid
shifting of units, there was hardly a moment when gun or rifle lacked a
cartridge. It was a truly splendid performance."</p>
<p>We have now traced the movements and the final positions of the eight corps
which were involved in this terrible battle from the foggy morning which
witnessed the German attack, up to those rainy days of early April which showed
a stable line&mdash;a line which in spite of occasional oscillations continued
from that date until the great British victory in August, to mark the point of
equilibrium of the giant forces which leaned from east and from west. In this
account we have seen the Seventeenth and Sixth Corps in the north fall back
upon Arras and the Vimy Ridge, where they turned and dealt their pursuers such
a blow that the battle in that sector was at an end. We have seen the Fourth,
Fifth, and Seventh Corps struggling hard to make a line from Arras to Albert
and down to the Somme; we have seen the Nineteenth Corps covering a huge front
and finally holding firm near Villers-Bretonneux, and we have seen the
Eighteenth and Third Corps intermixed with our French Allies helping to
determine the line in the southern area of the great field of battle. That line
running just to the west of Montdidier, Moreuil, and Albert was destined for
four months to be a fixed one, though it was advanced during that time by the
splendid audacity of the Australians, who gave their opponents no rest, and
finally, with the help of the British Eighth Division, entirely re-won the town
of Villers-Bretonneux when it was temporarily lost, and extended our outposts a
mile or more to the east of it, as will be presently described. Save for this
action there was no movement of importance during that time, though the general
set of the tide was rather eastwards than westwards.</p>
<p>One cannot leave so vast a theme as the second battle of the Somme without a
few words as to the general impression left upon the mind of the writer by the
many documents bearing upon the subject which he has had to peruse. In the
first place, we cannot possibly deny that it was a great German victory, and
one which was well earned, since it depended upon clever and new dispositions
entailing laborious preparation with the intelligent and valiant co-operation
of officers and men. The overpowering force of the blow, while it removed all
reproach from those who had staggered back from it, depended upon the able way
in which it was delivered. Having said so much, we must remind the German
commentator that he cannot have it both ways, and that if a gain of guns,
prisoners, and ground which fails to break the line is, as we admit, a victory
to the Germans, then a similar result is a victory to the British also. He
cannot claim the second battle of the Somme to be a victory, and yet deny the
term to such battles as Arras, Messines, and Passchendaele. The only difference
is that the Germans really did try to break the line upon March 21, and failed
to do so, while no such design was in General Haig's mind during the battles of
1917, save perhaps in the last series of operations.</p>
<p>There was a regrettable tendency after the battle to recriminations in the
Press, and General Gough, who had been the head of the Fifth Army, was
sacrificed without any enquiry as to the dominant force which he had to face,
or as to the methods by which he mitigated what might have been a really
crushing disaster. It can be safely stated that in the opinion of many of those
who are in the best position to know and to judge, there was absolutely nothing
upon the military side which could have been bettered, nor has any suggestion
ever been made of anything which was left undone.</p>

<p class="caption">Position at the Close of the Great Retreat, March 30</p>
<br>
<p>The entrenching had been carried out for several months with an energy which
raised protests from the men who had to do it. There might almost be room for
the opposite criticism that in the constant work of the navvy the training of
the soldier had been unduly neglected; but that was the result of the
unavoidable scarcity of non-military labour. The extension of the front was
undoubtedly too long for the number of men who had to cover it; but this was
done at the express request of the French, who had strong military reasons for
drawing out and training a number of their divisions. It was taking a risk
undoubtedly, but the risk was forced upon the soldiers, and in any case the
French have taken risks before now for us. The blowing up of the bridges was
well done, and the only exception seems to have been in the case of railway
bridges which, for some reason, were taken out of the hands of the army
commander. The reserves were insufficient and were perhaps too far back, but
the first item at least depended upon the general weakness of manpower. Nowhere
can one lay one's hand upon any solid ground for complaint, save against the
rogues and fools of Brest-Litovsk, who by their selfish and perjured peace
enabled the Germans to roll a tidal wave of a million men from east to west,
with the certainty that they would wash away the first dam against which they
struck. If there is any military criticism to be made, it lies rather in the
fact that the French help from the south was nearly sixty hours before it made
itself felt at the nearest part of the British line, and also in the surprising
number of draft reserves kept in England at that date. Within a month of the
battle 350,000 had been sent to the front&mdash;a very remarkable feat, but a
sign, surely, of an equally remarkable omission. Had ten emergency divisions of
infantry been made out of the more forward of these drafts, had they been held
ready in the rear zones, and had the actual existing reserves been pushed up to
the front, it is safe to say that the German advance would have been stopped
earlier and would probably not have got beyond the Peronne&mdash;Noyon line.
If, as was stated in Parliament, it was confidently expected that the German
attack would strike exactly where it did, then it does seem deplorable that the
nearest reserve to the Fifth Army, a single division, had, through our weak
man-power, to be kept at a three days' journey from the point of danger. If,
instead of searching the record of the General for some trace of weakness, our
critics had realised the rapidity of his decision, with the moral courage and
grasp of actuality which he showed by abandoning his positions&mdash;no easy
thing for one of his blood and record&mdash;and falling back unbroken upon a
new line of defence beyond the German heavy artillery, they could not have
failed to admit that the country owes a deep debt of gratitude to General
Gough. Had he hesitated and his army been isolated and destroyed, the whole war
might well have taken a most sinister turn for the worse.</p>
<p>Granting, however, that the disaster was minimised by the prompt
appreciation of the situation by the General in command, by the splendid work
of his four corps-commanders, and by the co-operation of every one concerned,
it is still undeniable that the losses were very heavy, and the result, even
after making every allowance for German wastage, a considerable military
disaster. In killed, wounded, and missing in the Fifth Army alone the figures
could not be less than 50,000, including Feetham and Malcolm, army divisional
generals, with Dawson, Bailey, White, Bellingham, and numerous other brigadiers
and senior officers. In field-guns 235 were lost or destroyed out of 600, in
medium heavies 108 out of 494, in 8-inch or over pieces 19 out of 98. Great
quantities of stores, especially at Ham, fell into the hands of the enemy, but
so far as possible they were burned or made useless. Bad as the episode seemed
at the time, it is clear now to any one who looks back upon it that it had no
evil effect upon the result of the war. The Germans were exposed to very heavy
losses which they could ill afford. They have admitted to 180,000 in documents
published since the armistice but this may be an understatement. They were
drawn away from their famous lines to which they did not return until they were
so reduced that they could not hold them. Finally, it led to that concentration
of power in the hands of Marshal Foch which was worth many sacrifices to
attain. Sir Douglas Haig, from his many services and long experience, might
well have put forward claims to the supreme place, and it is characteristic of
the nobility of this great soldier that it was in response to a telegram from
him to the Prime Minister, in which he named General Foch for the position,
that the change was eventually carried through.</p>

<h2><a id="chap8" name="chap8">VIII. THE SOMME FRONT FROM APRIL 1
ONWARDS</a></h2>
<p class="chaphead">The last waves of the storm&mdash;The Twelfth Division at
Albert&mdash; The Forty-seventh Division at Aveluy Wood&mdash;The Australians
in the south&mdash;Capture of Villeis-Bietonneux by the Germans&mdash;Recapture
by Australians and Eighth Division&mdash;Fierce fighting&mdash;The first turn
of the tide</p>
<p class="first">THE limit and results of the second battle of the Somme had
been defined when the Australians, New Zealanders, Second Canadians, and fresh
British divisions took the place of their exhausted comrades towards the end of
March. The German reserves, great as they were, were, nearly exhausted, and
they had no more men to put into the fight. The final line began to clearly
define itself, running from a few miles east of Arras where the Seventh and
Sixth Corps had struck back so heavily at the German pursuit, through Neuville
Vitasse, Boyelles, Ayette, Bucquoy, H&eacute;buterne, Auchonvillers, Aveluy,
just west of Albert, Denancourt, Warfus&eacute;e, and Marcelcave. The worst
storm was over, but even as the sinking sea will still send up one great wave
which sweeps the deck, so the German battle front would break from time to time
into a spasm of energy, which could effect no great purpose and yet would lead
to a considerable local engagement. These episodes must at least be indicated
in the order of their occurrence.</p>
<p>One great centre of activity was the ruined town of Albert, for the Germans
were able to use it as a covered approach, and thus mass their troops and
attempt to break through to the westward. The order of divisions in this sector
showed that the Sixty-third and Forty-seventh, still fighting in spite of their
wounds, were to the immediate north-west. The Twelfth Division was due west.
South-west was the Third Division of Australians and south of these the Fourth.
On each of these, and sometimes upon all of them, the strain was very great, as
the Germans struggled convulsively to burst the bonds of Albert. It should be
noted that the Fifth Army had for the time passed out of being, and that all
the southern end of the line was now held by the Fourth Army under General
Rawlinson.</p>
<p>The main attack upon the Albert sector was on April 4, when the Germans made
a violent effort, and the affair reached the proportions of a considerable
battle. About eight in the morning the action began by a severe and sudden
attack upon the Australian Division 1000 yards south of Albert, and also on the
railway near Denancourt. The Australians fought as Australians have always
fought in this war, but the onset was very heavy, supported by a shattering
fire, and they were forced to yield some ground.</p>
<p>North of the Australians was the Twelfth Division with the 35th and 36th
Brigades in the line, in that order from the south. The temporary recoil of the
Australians rendered the 35th Brigade vulnerable, and the Germans with their
usual quick military perception at once dashed at it. About 1 o'clock they
rushed forward in two waves, having built up their formation under cover of the
ruined houses of Albert. The attack struck in between the 7th Suffolks and 9th
Essex, but the East Anglians stood fast and blew it back with their rifle-fire,
much helped by the machine-guns of the 5th Berks. Farther north the attack beat
up against the left of the Forty-seventh and the right of the Sixty-third
Divisions, but neither the Londoners nor the naval men weakened. The pressure
was particularly heavy upon the Forty-seventh, and some details of the fighting
will presently be given. The next morning, April 5, saw the battle still raging
along the face of these four divisions. The Germans attempted to establish
their indispensable machine-guns upon the ridge which they had taken on the
south, but they were driven off by the Australians. The 36th Brigade in the
north of the Albert sector had lost some ground at Aveluy, but about noon on
April 5 the 9th Royal Fusiliers with the help of the 7th Sussex re-established
the front, though the latter battalion endured very heavy losses from an
enfilade fire from a brickfield. The 5th Berks also lost heavily on this day.
So weighty was the German attack that at one time the 4th Australians had been
pushed from the high ground, just west of the Amiens-Albert railway, and the
35th Brigade had to throw back a defensive wing. The position was soon
re-established, however, though at all points the British losses were
considerable, while those of the Germans must have been very heavy indeed.</p>
<p>It has been stated that to the north of the Twelfth Division, covering
Bouzincourt and partly occupying Aveluy Wood, was the Forty-seventh Division
(Gorringe), which had been drawn out of the line, much exhausted by its
prolonged efforts, some days before, but was now brought back into the battle.
It stood with the 15th and 20th London of the 140th Brigade on the right, while
the 23rd and 24th of the 142nd Brigade were on the left. Units were depleted
and the men very weary, but they rose to the crisis, and their efforts were
essential at a time of such stress, for it was felt that this was probably the
last convulsive heave of the dying German offensive. It was on April 5 that the
German attack from the direction of Albert spread to the front of the
Forty-seventh Division. The bombardment about 8 A.M. reached a terrific pitch
of intensity and was followed by an infantry advance through clouds of gas and
smoke. The main attack fell upon the left of the divisional line, and was met
by a sustained rifle, Lewis gun, and artillery fire, which could not be faced
by the stormers. At one time the left of the 23rd London was penetrated, but a
rally re-established the position. The enemy were rushing forward in mass
formations, and their desperate tactics offered targets which ensured very
heavy losses.</p>
<p>About 9 o'clock the right brigade was also involved in the fighting, the
enemy advancing in force towards Aveluy Wood. Here also the assault was very
desperate and the defence equally determined. The 15th (Civil Service Rifles)
was heavily attacked, and shortly afterwards the Blackheath and Woolwich men of
the 20th Battalion saw the enemy in great numbers upon their front. The whole
line of the division was now strongly engaged. About 10 A.M. a company of the
24th London was driven from its position by concentrated rifle-grenade fire,
but a support company sprang to the front and the line was unbroken. At 10:30,
however, things took a grave turn, for a sudden rush brought the assailants
into the line between the two left flank battalions, outflanking and destroying
the outlying company of the 23rd London. These men fought bravely to the end
and took heavy toll of the enemy. At the same time the 20th London came under a
shattering shell-fire which put every Lewis gun out of action. It was also
enfiladed by machine-guns from the corner of Aveluy Wood, where the Germans had
penetrated the line. The 20th threw out a defensive flank and held on. The 15th
on their right were still in their original positions.</p>
<p>At 11.40 the 23rd London, which had suffered from the German penetration of
its left company, was exposed all along its line to machine-gun fire from its
left rear, where the enemy had established three posts. The result was that the
position in Aveluy Wood had to be abandoned. The 22nd London from the reserve
brigade was now pushed up into the firing-line where the pressure was very
great. The weight of the attack was now mainly upon the 20th, who held their
posts with grim determination in spite of very heavy losses, chiefly from
trench mortars and heavy machine-guns. It was a bitter ordeal, but the enemy
was never able to get nearer than 300 yards to the line of the 20th, and if
they caused heavy losses they endured as much from the British fire. About
12.40 the enemy seemed to be mustering at the south end of the wood for a grand
final attack, but the gathering was dispersed by the machine-guns of the
Londoners.</p>
<p>At four in the afternoon, after a truly terrible day, the Forty-seventh
Division determined to counter-attack, and the 22nd Battalion was used for this
purpose. They had already endured heavy losses and had not sufficient weight
for the purpose, though eight officers and many men had fallen before they were
forced to recognise their own inability. The failure of this attack led to a
further contraction of the line of defence. The Sixty-third Division on the
left had endured a similar day of hard hammering, and it was now very exhausted
and holding its line with difficulty. For a time there was a dangerous gap, but
the exhausted Germans did not exploit their success, and reserves were hurried
up from the Marines on the one side and from the 142nd Brigade on the other to
fill the vacant position.</p>
<p>When night fell after this day of incessant and desperate fighting the line
was unbroken, but it had receded in the area of Aveluy Wood and was bent and
twisted along the whole front. General Gorringe, with true British tenacity,
determined that it should be re-established next morning if his reserves could
possibly do it. Only one battalion, however, was available, the pioneer 4th
Welsh Fusiliers, who had already done conspicuous service more than once during
the retreat. An official document referring to this attack states that "no
troops could have deployed better or advanced more steadily under such intense
fire, and the leadership of the officers could not have been excelled." The
casualties, however, were so heavy from the blasts of machine-gun fire that the
front of the advance was continually blown away and no progress could be made.
Two platoons upon the left made some permanent gain of ground, but as a whole
this very gallant counter-attack was unavailing.</p>
<p>This attack near Albert on April 4 and 5 was the main German effort, but it
synchronised with several other considerable attacks at different points of the
line. One was just north of Warfus&eacute;e in the southern April 5. sector,
where once again the Australians were heavily engaged and prevented what at one
time seemed likely to be a local break-through. As it was the line came back
from Warfus&eacute;e to Vaire, where the Australian supports held it fast.
Farther north the Fourth Australian Division was sharply attacked opposite
Denancourt, and had a very brisk fight in which the 13th Brigade, and more
particularly the 52nd Regiment, greatly distinguished itself. The object of the
fight was to hold the railway line and the position of the Ancre. The tenacity
of the Australian infantry in the face of incessant attacks was most admirable,
and their artillery, ranging upon the enemy at 1500 yards, as they came over
the higher ground behind Denancourt, inflicted very heavy losses. One gun fired
1250 rounds without a stop.</p>
<p>The village of Hangard and Hangard Wood were at that time the points of
junction between the French and British armies. The extreme right unit of the
British was Smith's 5th Brigade of the Second Australian Division (Rosenthal).
The 20th Battalion on the southern flank was involved on this and the following
days in a very severe and fluctuating fight in which Hangard Wood was taken and
lost several times. Colonel Bennett, an Australian veteran whose imperial
services go back as far as the Suakin expedition, had to cover 3500 yards with
600 men, knowing well that there were no reserves behind him and that the point
was vital. With heavy losses he managed, with the 19th Battalion beside him, to
dam the German flood until help could arrive. So fierce was the fighting that
750 dead Germans were picked up in the Hangard Wood. On April 7 the wood was
abandoned, but under no compulsion and in accordance with the general movement
of the line.</p>
<p>About 10 A.M. on April 6 the enemy renewed his attack upon the junction
between the Forty-seventh and Sixty-third Divisions, but it was the British
turn to mow down advancing lines with machine-gun fire. No progress was made,
and there were such signs of German weakening that the British made a sudden
local advance, capturing two machine-guns and some prisoners. In this affair it
is characteristic of the spirit which still remained in the weary British
troops, that Corporal March of the 24th London went forward and shot the
opposing German officer, bringing back his maps and papers.</p>
<p>The German commanders were well aware that if the line was to be broken it
must be soon, and all these operations were in the hope of finding a fatal
flaw. Hence it was that the attacks which began and failed upon April 4
extended all along the northern line on April 5. Thus the New Zealand Division
on the left of the points already mentioned was involved in the fighting, the
right brigade, consisting of the New Zealand Rifle Brigade, being fiercely
attacked by some 2000 storm troops who advanced with great hardihood, and at
the second attempt recaptured the farm of La Signy. The German officers seem
upon this occasion to have given an example to their men which has often been
conspicuously lacking. "A tall Wurtemburger," says the New Zealand recorder,
"ran towards our line with nine of his men. In one hand he carried a cane, and
over his arm a light waterproof coat. He was a fine big fellow over six feet
high.... Just at the critical moment some Lewis-gunners took a hand in the
business, the officer was shot dead, and most of the others were killed or
wounded."</p>
<p>On the left of the New Zealanders the attack was extended to the road
between Ayette and Bucquoy. Here a brigade of the Thirty-seventh Division in
the south and of the Forty-second in the north were heavily attacked and
Bucquoy was taken, but before the evening the defenders returned and most of
the lost ground was regained. The right of the Thirty-seventh Division had
advanced in the morning upon Rossignol Wood, that old bone of contention, and
had in a long day's struggle got possession of most of it. Three machine-guns
and 130 men were the spoils.</p>
<p>From this time onwards there were no very notable events for some weeks in
the Somme line, save for some sharp fighting in the Aveluy Wood sector on April
21 and 22, in which the Seventeenth, Thirty-fifth, and Thirty-eighth Divisions
were all involved. The enemy tried hard to improve his position and did succeed
in gaining some ground. The attacks were costly to both sides but the results
were futile. The British outposts, and particularly those of the Australians,
maintained an aggressive attitude throughout, and it was more and more
impressed upon the German mind that in spite of his considerable advance and
large captures, it was an unbeaten army which lay before him.</p>
<p>On the morning of April 24 a very determined attack was made by the Germans
upon the front of Butler's Third Corps in the area of Villers-Bretonneux. This
small town is of great importance, as it stands on a curve of the rolling downs
from which a very commanding view of Amiens is obtained, the cathedral
especially standing out with great clearness. Already the city had suffered
great damage, but the permanent loss of Villers-Bretonneux would mean its
certain destruction. The attack was urged by four German divisions and was
supported by tanks which did good service to the enemy and broke in the British
line, held mainly at this point by Heneker's Eighth Division which had hardly
recovered from its heroic services upon the Somme.</p>
<p>It is suggestive of the value of the tanks whether in German or in British
hands that where the attack was unsupported by these machines it broke down
under the British fire, as on the right of Gator's Fifty-eighth Division to the
south and on the left of the Eighth Division. There were fifteen German tanks
in all, so their array was a formidable one, the more so in a mist which was
impenetrable at fifty yards. It was for the British now to experience the
thrill of helpless horror which these things can cause even in brave hearts
when they loom up out of the haze in all their hideous power. The 2/4th Londons
on the south of the village were driven back to the line Cachy&mdash; Hangard
Wood, so that their neighbours of the 2/2nd London had to conform. The 2/ 10th
London counter-attacked at once, however, and penetrated Hangard Wood, doing
something to ease the situation. The 2nd Middlesex and 2nd West Yorks were
overrun by the tanks, much as the Roman legionaries were by the elephants of
Pyrrhus, and even the historical and self-immolating stab in the belly was
useless against these monsters. The 2nd Rifle Brigade were also dislodged from
their position and had to close up on the 2nd Berkshires on their left. The 2nd
East Lancashires had also to fall back, but coming in touch with a section of
the 20th Battery April 24. of divisional artillery they were able to rally and
hold their ground all day with the backing of the guns.</p>
<p>The 2nd Devons in reserve upon the right were also attacked by tanks, the
first of 'which appeared suddenly before Battalion Headquarters and blew away
the parapet. Others attacked the battalion, which was forced to move into the
Bois d'Aquenne. There chanced to be three heavy British tanks, in this quarter,
and they were at once ordered forward to restore the situation. Seven light
whippet tanks were also given to the Fifty-eighth Division. These tanks then
engaged the enemy's fleet, and though two of the heavier and four of the light
were put out of action they silenced the Germans and drove them back. With
these powerful allies the infantry began to move forward again, and the 1st
Sherwood Foresters carried out a particularly valuable advance.</p>
<p>Shortly after noon the 173rd Brigade of the Fifty-eighth Division saw the
Germans massing behind tanks about 500 yards east of Cachy, with a view to
attacking. There were three whippets still available, and they rushed out and
did great work, catching two German battalions as they deployed.</p>
<p>The Fifty-eighth had good neighbours upon their right in the shape of the
Moroccan corps, a unit which is second to none in the French Army for attack.
These were not engaged, but under the orders of General Debeney they closed up
on the left so as to shorten the front of General Gator's division, a great
assistance with ranks so depleted. His troops were largely lads of eighteen
sent out to fill the gaps made in the great battle, but nothing could exceed
their spirit, though their endurance was not equal to their courage.</p>
<p>On the evening of April 24 General Butler could say with Desaix, "The battle
is lost. There is time to win another one." The Germans not only held
Villers-Bretonneux, but they had taken Hangard from the French, and held all
but the western edge of Hangard Wood. The farthest western point ever reached
by the Germans on the Somme was on this day when they occupied for a time the
Bois l'Abb&eacute;, from which they were driven in the afternoon by the 1st
Sherwoods and 2nd West Yorks. They had not attained Cachy, which was their
final objective, but none the less it was very necessary that
Villers-Bretonneux and the ground around it should be regained instantly before
the Germans took root.</p>
<p>For this purpose a night attack was planned on the evening of April 24, and
was carried out with great success. The operation was important in itself, but
even more so as the first sign of the turn of the tide which had run so long
from east to west, and was soon to return with such resistless force from west
to east.</p>
<p>For the purposes of the attack the fresh 13th Australian Brigade (Glasgow)
was placed under the General of the Eighth Division, and was ordered to attack
to the south of Villers, while the 15th Australian Brigade made a similar
advance upon the north. Each of these was directed to pass beyond the little
town, which was to be cleared by an independent force. On the right of the
Australians was the balance of the Eighth Division, which had to clear up the
Bois d'Aquenne.</p>

<p class="caption">Rough sketch of the general position of troops at<br>
the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, April 24-25, 1918.</p>
<br>
<p>The attack was carried out at 10 P.M., the infantry having white arm-bands
for identification in the darkness. There was no artillery preparation, and the
advance was across unknown country, so that it may be placed among the most
hazardous operations in the war. In the case of the 13th Australian Brigade,
the 52nd Battalion was on the right in touch with the British, while the 51st
was on the left, with the 50th in support. From the onset the machine-gun fire
was very severe, especially against the 51st Regiment, but the admirable
individuality of the Australian soldiers was of great service to them, every
man getting forward through the darkness as best he could. The weather was
ideal, for there was sufficient moon to give direction, but not enough to
expose the troops to distant fire. The German flares were rather a help to the
attack by defining the position. The Australian front got as far forward as
Monument Wood, level with the village, but the 173rd Brigade on their right was
in some difficulty, and they themselves were badly enfiladed from the town, so
they could not maintain their more advanced position. The 2nd Northamptons,
attached to the 13th Australian Brigade, had been told off to take the town
itself, but both their colonel and their adjutant were killed during the
assembly, and some confusion of orders caused the plans to miscarry. On the
north of the town the 15th Australian Brigade, with the 22nd Durhams attached,
had been an hour late in starting, but the 60th and 59th Regiments got up,
after some confused fighting, to a point north of the town, which was entered
after dawn and cleared up by the 2nd Berkshires, aided by a company of the
Australian 58th Battalion. The The German tanks had done good work in the
attack, and some of the British tanks were very useful in the counter-attacks,
especially three which operated in the Bois d'Aquenne and broke down the
obstinate German resistance in front of the Eighth Division. Daylight on April
25 found the British and Australian lines well up to the village on both sides,
and a good deal of hard fighting, in which the troops got considerably mixed,
took place. One unusual incident occurred as two blindfolded Germans under a
flag of truce appeared in the British line, and were brought to Colonel Whitham
of the 52nd Australian Regiment. They carried a note which ran: "My Commanding
Officer has sent me to tell you that you are confronted by superior forces and
surrounded on three sides. He desires to know whether you will surrender and
avoid loss of life. If you do not he will blow you to pieces by turning his
heavy artillery on to your trenches." No answer was returned to this barefaced
bluff, but the messengers were detained, as there was considerable doubt as to
the efficiency of the bandages which covered their eyes.</p>
<p>By 4 P.M. on April 25 the village had been cleared, and the troops were
approximately in the old front line. The 22nd Durham Light Infantry had mopped
up the south side of the village. About a thousand prisoners had been secured.
The 54th Brigade of Lee's Eighteenth Division, which had been in support,
joined in the fighting during the day, and helped to push the line forward,
winning their way almost to their final objective south of the village and then
having to yield 200 yards to a counter-attack. The fast whippet tanks were used
during this action, and justified themselves well, though, as in the case of
all tanks, the value of the instrument depends mainly upon the courage of the
crew who handle it. One British tank, under the command of a leader named
Craig, seems to have been all over the field wherever it was most needed, so
that some weeks after the fight the present chronicler in visiting the field of
battle still heard the legend of his prowess. As to the German resistance a
skilled observer remarks: "The enemy handled his machine-guns with great
boldness. The manner in which he pushes forward numbers of guns, relying upon
the daring and initiative of the crews to use them to best advantage, may lead
to a greater number being lost, but he certainly inflicts enormous casualties
in this way."</p>
<p>There was an aftermath of the battle on April 26 which led to some very
barren and sanguinary fighting in which the losses were mainly incurred by our
gallant Allies upon the right. There was a position called The Monument,
immediately south of Villers, which had not yet been made good. The Moroccan
Division had been slipped in on the British right, and their task was to
assault the German line from this point to the north edge of Hangard Wood. Part
of the Fifty-eighth Division was to attack the wood itself, while on the left
the Eighth Division was to complete the clearance of Villers and to join up
with the left of the Moroccans. The Eighth Division had already broken up three
strong counter-attacks on the evening of April 25, and by the morning of April
26 their part of the programme was complete. The only six tanks available were
given to the Moroccans. At 5:15 on the morning of April 26 the attack opened.
It progressed well near the town, but on the right the Foreign Legion, the very
cream of the fighting men of the French Army, were held by the murderous fire
from the north edge of Hangard Wood. The 10th Essex and 7th West Kents, who had
been lent to the Fifty-eighth Division' by the 53rd Brigade, were held by the
same fire, and were all mixed up with the adventurers of the Legion, the losses
of both battalions, especially the West Kents, being terribly heavy. The
Moroccan Tirailleurs in the centre were driven back by a German counter-attack,
but were reinforced and came on again. Hangard village, however, held up the
flank of the French. In the evening about half the wood was in the hands of the
Allies, but it was an inconclusive and very expensive day.</p>
<p>The battle of Villers-Bretonneux was a very important engagement, as it
clearly defined the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of the German advance in the Somme
valley, and marked a stable equilibrium which was soon to turn into an eastward
movement. It was in itself a most interesting fight, as the numbers were not
very unequal. The Germans had five divisions engaged, the Fourth Guards, Two
hundred and twenty-eighth. Two hundred and forty-third. Seventy-seventh
Reserve, and Two hundred and eighth. The British had the Eighth, Fifty-eighth,
Eighteenth, and Fifth Australian, all of them very worn, but the Germans may
also have been below strength. The tanks were equally divided. The result was
not a decided success for any one, since the line ended much as it had begun,
but it showed the Germans that, putting out all their effort, they could get no
farther. How desperate was the fight may be judged by the losses which, apart
from the Australians, amounted to more than 9000 men in the three British
divisions, the Fifty-eighth and Eighth being the chief sufferers.</p>
<p>As this was the first occasion upon which the Germans seem to have brought
their tanks into the line of battle, some remarks as to the progress of this
British innovation may not be out of place&mdash;the more so as it became more
and more one of the deciding factors in the war. On this particular date the
German tanks were found to be slow and cumbrous, but were heavily armed and
seemed to possess novel features, as one of them advanced in the original
attack upon April 24 squirting out jets of lachrymatory gas on each side. The
result of the fighting next day was that two weak (female) British tanks were
knocked out by the Germans while one German tank was destroyed and three
scattered by a male British tank. The swift British whippet tanks were used for
the first time upon April 24, and seem to have acted much like Boadicea's
chariots, cutting a swathe in the enemy ranks and returning crimson with
blood.</p>
<p>Treating the subject more generally, it may be said that the limited success
.attained by tanks in the shell-pocked ground of the Somme and the mud of
Flanders had caused the Germans and also some of our own high authorities to
underrate their power and their possibilities of development. All this was
suddenly changed by the battle of Cambrai, when the Germans were terrified at
the easy conquest of the Hindenburg Line. They then began to build. It may be
said, however, that they never really gauged the value of the idea, being
obsessed by the thought that no good military thing could come out of England.
Thus when in the great final advance the tanks began to play an absolutely
vital part they paid the usual price of blindness and arrogance, finding a
weapon turned upon them for which they had no adequate shield. If any
particular set of men can be said more than another to have ruined the German
Empire and changed the history of the world, it is those who perfected the tank
in England, and also those at the German headquarters who lacked the
imagination to see its possibilities. So terrified were the Germans of tanks at
the end of the war that their whole artillery was directed to knocking them
out, to the very great relief of the long-suffering infantry.</p>
<p>From this time onwards this front was the scene of continuous aggressive
action on the part of the Australians, which gradually nibbled away portions of
the German line, until the day came for the grand advance of August 8. One of
the most successful of these was on May 19, when the village of Ville-sur-Ancre
was taken by a sudden assault with 20 machine-guns and 360 prisoners. A second
very sharp fight, which may be mentioned here, though it is just beyond the
scope of this volume, was on July 1 and following days in the Aveluy sector,
near the Ancre, where the Twelfth and Eighteenth Divisions had three bouts of
attack and counter-attack, in which the 37th and o4th Brigades were heavily
engaged, the honours of the action being about equally divided between the
British and the Germans.</p>

<h2><a id="chap9" name="chap9">IX. THE BATTLE OF THE LYS</a><br>
April 9-12</h2>
<p class="chaphead">The Flanders front&mdash;Great German
onslaught&mdash;Disaster of the Portuguese&mdash;Splendid stand at Givenchy of
the Fifty-fifth Division&mdash;Hard fight of the Fortieth Division&mdash;Loss
of the Lys&mdash;Desperate resistance of the Fiftieth
Division&mdash;Thirty-fourth Division is drawn into the Battle&mdash;Attack in
the north upon the Ninth, Nineteenth, and Twenty-fifth Divisions&mdash;British
retreat&mdash;General survey of the situation</p>
<p class="first">NEARLY a hundred German divisions had been used against the
British alone in the great Somme offensive which began on March 21 and ended in
the first week of April. At this time the British forces in France, including
Portuguese and Overseas divisions, numbered sixty in all. Of these no less than
forty-four had been engaged in the great battle, and all of these were either
still in the line, tied to the Amiens front, or else had been drawn out in a
shattered and disorganised condition, having lost on an average not less than
from 4000 to 5000 men each. It will be seen that there was only a very small
margin over, and that if the Germans by a supreme effort had burst the line and
reached the estuary of the Somme, it would have been possible to have caused a
great military disaster. Especially would this have been the case if the
northern flank of the British could have been driven in as well as the
southern, for then the mutilated and shaken army would have been hurled in upon
itself and would have found itself crowded down upon a sea-coast which would
have given few facilities for embarkation. In the hopes of a debacle in the
south the Germans had prepared out of their huge reserves a considerable force
in the north which would have formed the second claw of their deadly
embrace.</p>
<p>When the first claw missed its grip and could get no farther it was
determined that the other should at least go forward and endeavour to reach the
Channel ports. Although the Somme estuary had not been attained, none the less
the Germans knew well that three-quarters of the whole British force had been
engaged, and that most of it was not fit to take its place in a renewed battle.
Therefore they had reason to hope for great results from their new offensive in
Flanders, and they entered upon it with a good heart.</p>
<p>The omens were certainly propitious, but there were two factors which were
in favour of the British &mdash; factors which could not yet have been
adequately appreciated by the Germans. The first was the new unity of command
under General Foch, a soldier famous for his writings in peace and for his
deeds in war. This great leader, who had distinguished himself again and again
since the first month of the war, when he had played a vital part in checking
the German rush for Paris, was selected with the cordial consent of every one
concerned, and especially of Sir Douglas Haig, as Generalissimo of the Allied
forces. Therefore a common control and a common policy were ensured, so that
the German chiefs could not turn their whole force upon half of the Allies with
the assurance that the other half would find the operations outside their war
map. Hence the British in Flanders, though they would have to fight their own
battle for a week or two, could count confidently upon receiving help at the
end of that time.</p>
<p>The second and more immediate factor, was that by a fine national effort a
splendid stream of efficient drafts had been despatched from England during the
great battle&mdash;young soldiers it is true, but full of spirit and most eager
to meet the Germans and to emulate the great deeds of their elders. Their
training had been short, but it had been intense and practical, with so
excellent a result that one could but marvel at the old pre-war pundits who
insisted that no soldier could be made under two years. These high-spirited
lads flocked into the depleted battalions, which had often to be reformed from
the beginning, with a skeleton framework of officers and N.C.O.'s upon which to
build. It was of course impossible to assimilate these drafts in the few days
at the disposal of the divisional generals, but at least they had adequate
numbers once more, and they must be taught to be battle-worthy by being thrown
into the battle, as Spartan fathers have taught their boys to swim.</p>
<p>One more sign of the times was the quick appreciation by the American
authorities of the desperate nature of the crisis all along the Allied line.
With magnanimous public spirit they at once gave directions that such American
troops as were available and had not yet been formed into special American
divisions should be placed under British or French command and fitted
temporarily into their organisation. The few complete organised American
divisions in France had been on the Alsace line, but some of these were now
brought round to thicken the French army on the Oise. But most important of all
was the effect upon the shipment of American troops, which had averaged about
50,000 a month and now rose at a bound to 250,000, a number which was sustained
or increased for several months in succession. This result was helped by the
whole-hearted co-operation of the British mercantile marine, which was
deflected from its other very pressing tasks, including the feeding of the
country, in order to carry these troops, and actually handled about two-thirds
of them whilst the British Navy helped to find the escorts. So efficiently were
the transport arrangements carried out both by British and Americans, that when
a million men had been conveyed they were still able to announce that the
losses upon the voyage were practically nil. Even the lie-fed bemused German
public began to realise in the face of this fact that their much boomed
submarines were only one more of their colossal failures.</p>
<p>The German attack upon the British lines by the army of General von Quast in
Flanders broke on the morning of April 9. There had been considerable shelling
on the day before along the whole line, but as the hour approached this
concentrated with most extreme violence on the nine-mile stretch from the
village of Givenchy in the south to Fleurbaix, which is just south of
Armenti&egrave;res in the north. This proved to be the area of the actual
attack, and against this front some eight German divisions advanced about 6
o'clock of a misty morning. So shattering had been their bombardment and so
active their wire-cutters, who were covered by the fog, that the advanced
positions could hardly be said to exist, and they were able to storm their way
at once into the main defences.</p>
<p>The point upon which this attack fell was held the by four divisions, all of
which formed part of Horne's First Army. The general distribution of the troops
at that time was that the Second Army stretched from the junction with the
Belgians near Houthulst Forest down to the Messines district where it joined
the First Army. The First Army had weakened itself by an extension to the
south, and Plumer's force was about to extend also, and take over the Laventie
district, when the storm suddenly burst upon the very point which was to be
changed.</p>
<p>Two corps were involved in the attack, the Fifteenth (De Lisle) in the
Armenti&egrave;res region, and the Eleventh (Haking) in the region of Givenchy.
The latter had two divisions in the line, Jeudwine's Fifty-fifth West
Lancashire Territorials defending the village and adjacent lines, while the
Portuguese Second Division (Da Costa) covered the sector upon their left. The
depleted Fiftieth Division (Jackson) was in immediate reserve. On the left of
the Portuguese was Ponsonby's Fortieth Division which had lost five thousand
men in the Somme battle only a fortnight before, and now found itself plunged
once more into one of the fiercest engagements of the war, where it was exposed
again to very heavy losses.</p>
<p>The main force of the German attack fell upon the Portuguese fine, and it
was of such strength that no blame can be attached to inexperienced troops who
gave way before so terrific a blow, which would have been formidable to any
soldiers in the world. The division held the line from 2000 yards south of
Richebourg l'Avou&eacute; to the east of Picantin, a frontage of 9350 yards, or
more than half of the total front of the assault. The division had all three
brigades in the line, and even so was very extended to meet a serious assault.
The 3rd Brigade from the First Portuguese Division was in immediate support.
The 5th Brigade was on the right, covering Le Touret, the 6th in the middle,
and the 4th on the left, covering Laventie. Behind the whole position lay the
curve of the River Lys, a sluggish stream which moves slowly through this
desolate plain, the Golgotha where so many men have died, Indians, French,
British, and German, since the first months of the war. In all that huge flat
canalised space it was only at Givenchy that some small ridge showed above the
dreary expanse.</p>
<p>The Portuguese had been in the line for some months, but had never
experienced anything to approach the severity of the shattering bombardment
which poured upon them from four in the morning. When an hour or two later the
storming columns of the German infantry loomed through the thick curtain of
mist, the survivors were in no condition to stand such an attack. All telephone
and telegraph wires had been cut within the first half-hour, and it was
impossible to direct any protective barrage. The artillery in the rear, both
British and Portuguese, had been much weakened by a concentration of gas-shells
extending as far as Merville, so that the infantry were left with insufficient
support. The gunners stood to their work like men, and groups of them continued
to fire their guns after the infantry had left them exposed. These brave men
were killed or captured by the enemy, and their batteries were taken. In the
rear the roads had been so shattered by the German fire that it was impossible
to get a tractor or lorry up to the heavy guns, and there was no way of
removing them. All observers agree that the crews or the heavy guns did
excellently the Lys. well. The whole front had fallen in, however, and in spite
of scattered groups of infantry who showed the traditional Portuguese
courage&mdash;that courage which had caused the great Duke to place them
amongst his best soldiers&mdash;the position was in the hands of the enemy. By
mid-day they were at Le Touret upon the right, and the guns there were blown up
and abandoned. About the same time they had reached Estaires upon the left and
Bout Deville in the centre. Before evening the German line was four miles from
its starting-point, and had reached the River Lawe, a small affluent of the
Lys. From this time onwards the Fiftieth Division, coming up from the rear, had
taken over the front, and the Portuguese were out of the battle. The Germans in
their day's work had taken 6000 prisoners and 100 guns, many of them in ruins.
It should be mentioned that the Portuguese ordeal was the more severe, as
breast-works had taken the place of trenches in this sector. All were agreed
that General da Costa did what was possible. "He is a fine man, who does not
know what fear is," said a British officer who was with him on the day of the
battle.</p>
<p>The caving in of the front of the line had a most serious effect upon the
two British divisions, the Fifty-fifth and the Fortieth, who were respectively
upon the right and the left of the Portuguese. Each was attacked in front, and
each was turned upon the flank and rear. We shall first consider the case of
the Fifty-fifth Division which defended the lines of Givenchy with an energy
and success which makes this feat one of the outstanding incidents of the
campaign. This fine division of West Lancashire Territorials, containing
several battalions from Liverpool, had some scores to settle with the Germans,
by whom they had been overrun in the surprise at Cambrai at the end of the last
November. At Givenchy they had their glorious revenge.</p>
<p>The position of the Fifty-fifth Division was a strong one, extending for
some thousands of yards from the hamlet of Le Plantin in the south to Cailloux
in the north, with a section of the old British line a thousand yards in front,
a deserted trench half full of water and festooned with rusty wire. There were
outpost companies along the scattered line of ruined houses, and a few posts
were thrown far out near the old trench. The village line consisted of a series
of well-concealed breast-works and loopholed walls without any continuous
trench, the whole so cunningly arranged that it was difficult to get the plan
of it from in front. Each post or small fort had its own independent scheme of
defence, with good enfilade fire, concrete emplacements, belts of wire, and
deep ditches. Very early in the day the left flank of the position had been
entirely exposed by the retirement of the Portuguese, so that during the whole
long and desperate struggle the general formation of the division was in the
shape of an L, the shorter arm being their proper front, and the longer one
facing north and holding up the German attack from inside the old lines. The
northern defensive flank does not seem to have been entirely improvised, as
some precautions of this nature had already been taken. The new front extended
from the hamlet of Loisne upon the stream of that name, through a second hamlet
called Le Plant in, and so down to the canal. The first strain of the fighting
fell chiefly upon the 165th Brigade (Boyd-Moss), consisting of three battalions
of the famous King's Liverpool Regiment. The 6th and 7th Battalions were in the
line with the 5th in support at Gorre, but as the day wore on and the pressure
increased, units from both the other brigades were drawn into the fight, so
that all participated in the glory of the victory. By 8:30 the flank was
entirely naked, and the Germans in small but audacious bodies, with a constant
rattle of rifle and machine-gun fire, were pushing in between the outer posts
of the British division, overwhelming and obliterating some of them by a
concentrated fire of trench mortars. Some of these isolated garrisons held out
in the most desperate fashion, and helped to take the pressure off the main
village line. One particularly brilliant example was that of Captain Armstrong
of the l/4th South Lancashires, who with A Company of that battalion defended a
moated farm, literally to the death, having been warned that it was a key
position. About mid-day the German attack was still creeping in, and had gained
one important outpost called Princes' Island. The 10th Liverpool Scots from the
166th Brigade, a battalion which has a great record for the war, had come up to
thicken the line of defenders. Amid the crash and roar of constant shells, and
a storm of bullets which beat like hail upon every wall and buzzed through
every crevice, the stubborn infantry endured their losses with stoic patience,
firing steadily through their shattered loopholes at any mark they could see.
At 1 o'clock some audacious stormers had got so far forward on the left that
they were in the rear of the Brigade Headquarters, and were only held there by
spare men from the transport lines who chanced to be available. The attack was
drifting down more and more from the new ground, so about this hour the 5th
South Lancashires, also of the 166th Brigade, were sent across to the north of
Loisne to hold the stream. Each flank was attempted in turn by the wily
assailants, so that when the left proved impervious they charged in upon the
right, and captured Windy Corner, which is near the canal upon that side,
continuing their advance by attacking Le Plantin South from the rear and the
flank, so that the defenders were in an impossible position. Having taken this
point it seemed as if the Germans would roll up the whole long thin line from
the end, and they actually did so, as far as Le Plantin North. Here the British
rallied, and the survivors of the 6th and 7th King's made a furious advance,
pushed the Germans back, retook Le Plantin South, and captured a number of
prisoners. The position was still serious, however, as the Germans held Windy
Corner, and had penetrated between the British right and the canal, so as to
get into the rear of the position. A great effort was called for, and the men
responded like heroes. The 2/5th Lancashire Fusiliers from the 164th Brigade
(Stockwell) had come up, and these fine soldiers, with the weary remains of the
two King's Liverpool battalions, rushed the whole German position, dragging
them out from the pockets and ruins amid which they lurked. In this splendid
counter-attack more than 700 prisoners were taken in all, with a number of
machine-guns. At the end of it the British right was absolutely intact.</p>
<p>Whilst these stirring events had taken place on the right flank, there had
been heavy fighting also on the left. Here the British defence had been based
upon two small but strong forts, called Cailloux North and Route A Keep. The
latter fell early in the action, the German infantry coming upon it so
unexpectedly in the fog that the machine-guns were at the moment mounted upon
the parapet and elevated for indirect fire. They were put out of action, and
the place was surrounded and taken. This greatly weakened the left wing of the
defence. Farther still to the left the Germans were pushing through Loisne, and
the fort called Loisne Central was heavily engaged. This portion of the line
was held by the 166th Brigade. Once the German wave actually lapped over into
the little fort, but the place was not taken, and its machine-guns still
clattered and flashed. All day the Germans were held at this point though the
pressure was great. During the night the 13th King's Liverpools from the 9th
Brigade were sent as a reserve to the weary line. At 7.40 on the morning of
April 10 the enemy, under cover of a murderous barrage, attacked Loisne once
more, striving hard to break in the left of the British defence. The garrison
suffered terribly, but none the less the stormers were shot back into their
shell-holes and lurking-places. Two successive attacks on the forts of Cailloux
and Festubert had no better success and were less strongly urged. At seven in
the evening they again, with a sudden rush, got a footing in the fort of
Loisnes, and again were driven out, save for twenty-one who remained as
prisoners. Another day had passed, and still Lancashire stood fast and the
lines were safe. On April 11 the whole position was swept by a heavy
shell-storm, and the German infantry clustered thickly in front of the
crumbling The barricades. The guns both of the Fifty-fifth and of the Eleventh
Division played havoc with them April 9-1 2. as they assembled, so that the
attack was paralysed on the right, but on the left the two little forts of
Festubert East and Cailloux were both overwhelmed. The former, however, was at
once retaken by a mixed storming party from the 5th and 13th King's Liverpools.
Late in the evening Cailloux Keep was also stormed, and once more the position
was intact.</p>
<p>There was now only Route A Keep in possession of the enemy, and it was
determined to regain it. The guns had quickly registered upon it during the
day, and at midnight they all burst into a concentrated bombardment which was
followed by a rush of two companies, one drawn from the Liverpool Scots and the
other from the 13th King's Liverpools. The place was carried by assault, and
the garrison held it strongly on the 12th and 13th against a series of attacks.
It was a most murderous business, and the brave little garrisons were sadly cut
about, but they held on with the utmost determination, having vowed to die
rather than give the fort up. The survivors were still there, crouching among
the ruins and exposed to constant heavy shelling, when on April 15 the old epic
was ended and a new one was begun by the relief of the Fifty-fifth Division by
Strickland's First Division. The episode will live in history, and may match in
tenacity and heroism the famous defence of Ovillers by the German Guards. The
casualties were heavy, but it may be safely said that they were small compared
with those of the attacking battalions.</p>
<p>The story has been carried forward in this quarter for the sake of connected
narrative, but we must now return to the events of April 9, and especially to
the effect produced upon the Fortieth Division the Lys. by the exposure of
their southern flank. This fine unit, with its terrible wounds only half
healed, was exposed all day to a desperate attack coming mainly from the south,
but involving the whole of their line from Laventie to Armenti&egrave;res. The
division, which is predominantly English, but contains one brigade of Highland
troops, fought most valiantly through the long and trying day, enduring heavy
losses, and only yielding ground in the evening, when they were attacked in the
rear as well as in front and flank.</p>
<p>In the morning the Fortieth Division had the 119th Brigade (18th Welsh, 21st
Middlesex, and 13th East Surrey) on the right, while the 121st Brigade (20th
Middlesex, 12th Suffolks, and 13th Yorks) was on the left, joining up with
Nicholson's Thirty-fourth Division which held the Armenti&egrave;res front. The
right of the Fortieth was involved in the heavy initial bombardment and also in
the subsequent infantry advance, which established a footing in the front
trenches of the 119th Brigade. Whilst a counter-attack was being organised to
drive the stormers out, it was found that the right and the rear of the
position were threatened by the advance through the Portuguese. The 120th
Scottish Brigade in reserve was ordered to form a defensive flank, but the 10/
11th Highland Light Infantry, the nearest unit, found itself almost overlapped,
and the brigade had to fall back upon the bridges at Nouveau Monde in order to
protect the river crossings. The 2nd Scots Fusiliers covered the bridge-head,
while the whole of the 119th Brigade fell back to the line of the Lys, save
only the garrison of Fleurbaix. The 121st Brigade was still holding its line in
the Bois Grenier sector. By 1 o'clock the bulk of the Fortieth Division was
across the Lys, the bridges being destroyed one by one as the day advanced.</p>
<p>The destruction was not in all cases complete, and in that of the Pont Levis
at Estaires was absolutely checked by a chance shell which destroyed the leads,
and prevented the explosion. The enemy, under cover of machine-guns mounted in
the houses of Bac St. Maur, were able to cross the river here and get a footing
upon the northern bank. The 74th Brigade from the Twenty-fifth Division and the
150th from the Fiftieth were coming up, however, and it was still hoped that
the German advance might be checked. So severe had the fighting been that the
18th Welsh had only 5 officers and 120 men standing in the evening.</p>
<p>The 121st Brigade were in the meanwhile endeavouring to hold the Fleurbaix
defences on the left of the line. At 11:30 A.M. the Germans were in the east of
the village, but the 12th Suffolks, who formed the garrison, put up a most
determined resistance, in which they were aided by a company of the 12th
Yorkshires Pioneer Battalion. It was not till 5:30 that the village was nearly
enveloped, and the troops had to make their way as best they could to the north
bank of the Lys. The 20th Middlesex and 13th Yorkshires, with their flank badly
compromised, still held on to the Bois Grenier sector. These battalions on the
left were taken over by the Thirty-fourth Division, with whom they were now in
close liaison.</p>
<p>On the morning of April 10 the two brigades which had crossed the river were
in very evil case, having sustained heavy losses. They were concentrated about
Le Mortier. The 74th Brigade was in the Lys. position south of Croix du Bac in
touch on the right with the 150th Yorkshire Territorials. All day the enemy
were pushing west and north, but meeting a strong resistance from the British
who had an excellent trench, the Steenwerck switch, to help them. Some ground
was lost, but much of it was regained in the evening by a spirited
counter-attack of the 14th and lO/llth Highland Light Infantry, the 2nd Scots
Fusiliers, and the 21st Middlesex, which advanced over 600 yards. The pressure
was great and unceasing, however, so that the morning of April 11 found the
line farther back again. The two brigades were reduced to about 1000 men, who
were concentrated at Strazeele, while the 92nd and 93rd Brigades of the
Thirty-first Division came up in their place. A brave counter-attack by the
93rd Brigade at Le Verrier gained its objective, but created a dangerous gap
between it and the 92nd Brigade on its right, which was filled, however, by the
11th East Yorkshires. On the 12th the remains of all three brigades were strung
out to cover Strazeele and Hazebrouck from the east and south-east, but next
day they were relieved by the welcome appearance of the First Australian
Division, whose advent will afterwards be explained. It had been a very
desperate term of service, in which for three days the sappers of the 224th,
229th, and 231st Field Companies Royal Engineers had to fight as hard as the
infantry. The Fortieth, like the other divisions described, were driven back,
but only as the buffer is driven back, with the ultimate result of stopping the
force which drove it. They were much aided by the guns of the Fifty-seventh
Division under General Wray. The losses of the division were 185 officers and
4307 other ranks. When one reflects that the losses on the three weeks before
had been equally heavy, one can but marvel.</p>
<p>We shall now follow the fortunes of the Thirty-fourth Division (Nicholson),
which was on the immediate left of the Fortieth, covering a sector of 8000
yards, including the town of Armenti&egrave;res. On the north, near
Frelinghien, it joined the right of the Twenty-fifth Division. On the night of
April 7 the enemy fired an enormous number, 30,000 or 40,000, of gas-shells
into Armenti&egrave;res, and soaked it to such an extent with mephitic vapours
that it became uninhabitable. Otherwise there was no warning of an impending
attack, which came indeed as a surprise to all the forces engaged.</p>
<p>On April 9 the division lay with the 103rd Brigade upon the right section
and the 102nd upon the left, with the guns of the Thirty-eighth Division behind
them. The main attack on this day was entirely upon the two divisions, the
Portuguese and the Fortieth, to the south. There was heavy shelling, however,
of the back areas, especially Armenti&egrave;res and Erquinghem. When as the
day advanced everything on the right had given way or weakened, the 103rd
Brigade threw back a long thin defensive line, facing south, which ended in the
direction of Fleurbaix. At the same time the reserve 101st Brigade was ordered
up to cover Bac St. Maur Bridge. One battalion of the Reserve Brigade, the 11th
Suffolks, got into Fleurbaix, when by a happy chance they were able to
reinforce their own comrades of the 12th Battalion. These two sturdy East
Anglian units held the village in a very desperate fight for many hours. The
15th and 16th Royal Scots of the same brigade had some hard fighting also as
they continued the defensive line formed by the 103rd Brigade, and tried to
prevent the victorious Germans from swarming round and behind the Thirty-fourth
Division. Some idea of the danger may be gathered from the fact that of two
brigades of artillery engaged one was firing south-west and the other due east.
The original front was never in danger, but it was a desperate conflict upon
the refused flank.</p>
<p>During the afternoon the Germans crossed the Lys at Sailly and Bac St. Maur,
though the bridge at the latter place had been destroyed. Their progress,
however, had slowed down and become uncertain. The 74th Brigade of the
Twenty-fifth Division had come under the orders of General Nicholson, and was
at once directed against the village of Croix du Bac, with the ultimate design
of recovering the Bac St. Maur crossing. The 74th Brigade succeeded in clearing
Croix du Bac of the enemy, but night fell before they could get farther. The
morning found this brigade sandwiched in between the Fortieth and Thirty-fourth
Divisions, while the 147th Brigade had also moved up in support. It was soon
found, however, that the enemy had got so far west in the south that they
outflanked the 74th Brigade, who had to retire on April 10 through Croix du Bac
and Steenwerck. On the same morning the Twenty-fifth Division had been attacked
near Frelinghien, and the Germans penetrated as far as the northern bend of the
Lys, north of Armenti&egrave;res.</p>
<p>The left of the Thirty-fourth Division was now entirely in the air. It was
clear, therefore, that a retirement north of the Lys was necessary, and about 3
P.M. in a sedate and orderly fashion it was started and carried through,
covered by the fire of the 147th Brigade. The Thirty-fourth drew off in fine
order, the rearguards stopping from time to time, especially in the streets of
Armenti&egrave;res, for the purpose of beating back the advancing German
patrols. All bridges were destroyed, and no unwounded prisoners were left. The
men of the Thirty-fourth were loud in praise of the way in which the Yorkshire
Territorials of the 147th Brigade covered their right flank during this
difficult and dangerous extrication. We will now, having traced the effects
upon the Fifty-fifth to the south, and upon the Fortieth and Thirty-fourth
Divisions to the north, return to the situation created on April 9 by the
breaking of the Portuguese.</p>
<p>Jackson's Fiftieth Division, without its artillery, had only arrived from
the Somme on April 8, having lost half its old soldiers, so that 50 per cent of
the personnel were drafts. It had also suffered severely in officers, and was
very battle-weary and exhausted. It was placed in billets at Merville, with two
battalions of the 151st Brigade holding redoubts at Lestrem south of the Lys
close to Estaires.</p>
<p>As soon as it was seen that the situation was serious, about 8 o'clock in
the morning, the division was put in motion. The 151st Brigade was ordered to
extend its left into Estaires, while the 150th prolonged the line north of
Estaires. The 149th was held in reserve, though one of its battalions, the 4th
Northumberland Fusiliers, was sent in to strengthen the right. The intention
was that the Fiftieth Division should hold the line until the reserves could be
brought to the point of danger.</p>
<p>By two in the afternoon the Germans could be seen all along the front, and
some of the Portuguese had made their way through and between the ranks. A very
heavy fire was opened by both lines of infantry, and the Germans advancing by
short rushes made continuous progress towards the eastern bank of the stream.
Yorkshire and Durham stood solid upon the farther side, however, and 5000
recruits endured a long and terrible baptism of fire from the afternoon to the
evening of that spring day. It was on the right at Lestrem, where the British
were to the east of the Lys, that the pressure was most severe, and eventually
the 151st Brigade found it impossible to hold this point, while farther to the
north, upon the left of the Yorkshire men, the German infantry of the 370th
Regiment had won a footing upon the western bank of the Lys at Sailly and Bac
St. Maur. The British guns were beginning to concentrate, however, and
invaluable time had been gained by the resistance of the Fiftieth Division. As
night fell the 5th Durhams were still holding Estaires, while the 5th and 6th
Northumberland Fusiliers from the reserve were standing firm along the stretch
north and east of Estaires. Farther north still were the 4th East Yorks, 4th
Yorks, and 5th Yorks in that order from the south, all very weary, but all
holding tenaciously to their appointed line. During the night the Fifty-first
Highland Division (Carter-Campbell) came up on the right of the 151st Brigade
to cover the weak point at Lestrem and all the line to the south of it. A
brigade of the Twenty-fifth Division also came up to Steenwerck north of where
the river line had been broken, but it was too late for an effective
counter-attack, as considerable forces were already across, which were
spreading out north and south on the western bank.</p>
<p>The fall of night made no change in the battle, and the darkness was lit up
by the red glare of the incessant fire. For many hours the line was held,
though the Germans had brought up fresh divisions for their attack. Early in
the morning of April 10, however, they won a footing in Estaires, which was
desperately defended by the 5th Durhams. By 8:45, after long-continued street
fighting, the Germans held the whole town, with the exception of the south-
western extremity. The fight raged all day backwards and forwards through this
little straggling place, the infantry upon either side showing the most
determined valour. About 9:30 the 6th Northumberland Fusiliers, under Colonel
Temperley, made a brilliant counter-attack, crossing 1500 yards of open country
with only three batteries to cover the movement. Before 10 o'clock they were
into Estaires and had cleared the main street, rushing house after house and
driving the Germans down to the river edge, where they rallied and remained.
The 149th Brigade had promptly sent forward its machine-guns, and these were
mounted on the highest houses at the south end of the town, to fife on any
enemy reserves coming up south of the Lys. They raked the Germans on the
farther bank and caused heavy losses. All day the remains of the 6th Durhams
and 6th Northumberlands fought desperately in Estaires, and held nearly all of
it in the evening, which was in a way a misfortune, since it allowed the
Germans to concentrate their heavies upon it during the night in a
whole-hearted fashion which rendered it absolutely untenable. The morning of
April 11 found Estaires a No Man's Land between the lines of the infantry. In
spite of a fresh advance by the 4th and 5th Northumberland Fusiliers, it was
found impossible to regain the place, while the Germans gradually extended
their line from the river crossings which they had retained all through. By
mid-day on April 11, the British line was 500 yards west of the town.</p>
<p>In the southern portion of the line the 151st Brigade of Durhams had been
slowly forced back from the Lestrem sector until they were on the line of the
Lys, which they reached in the evening of April 10. At that date the 150th
Yorkshire Brigade was still firm upon the river, but the left-hand battalion ,
the 5th Yorks, had thrown back its flank, since the enemy, brushing aside the
right wing of the Fortieth Division, had crossed the stream and turned the
Fiftieth from .the north. The Fortieth was still fighting hard, as already
described, and endeavouring to hold back the attack, so that the German advance
was slow. Early in the morning of April 11 the attack became very severe, and
broke through to the west of Estaires&mdash;the river at this point runs from
west to east&mdash;driving back the Durham Brigade, which was absolutely
exhausted after forty-eight hours of ceaseless fighting without assistance.
Their resistance had been an extraordinarily fine one, but there comes a limit
to human powers. The whole division was at the last extremity, but fortunately
at 12 o'clock on the 11th, two brigades of the Twenty-ninth Division (Cayley)
came up in relief.</p>
<p>So close was the fighting, however, and so desperate the situation, that
General Riddell of the 149th Northumberland Fusiliers Brigade refused to
disengage his men from the battle, since the confusion of a relief might have
led to disaster. He was at the time holding the line astride the Meteren
Becque, north of Estaires, covering about 1000 yards of vital ground. Here the
Germans attacked all day, making prodigious efforts to push the 4th and 5th
Northumberland Fusilliers out of Trou Bayard. The ground between this point and
Pont Levis, the bridge at the east end of Estaires, was dead flat, and afforded
no particle of cover. Fifteen British machine-guns stationed beside the
infantry swept all this expanse, and cut down each wave of attack. Four times
the place was supposed to have fallen, and four times the Germans fell back,
leaving long grey swathes of their dead. It was not until 3 P.M. that the
stubborn Northumbrians found that their right was completely exposed, and were
forced to retire from a position which they had sold at a terrible price.</p>
<p>Instead of dying down the German advance was attaining a greater proportion
with every day that passed, for it seemed to their commanders that with so
favourable an opening some very great success lay within their power. In spite
of the arrival of the Fifty-first and Twenty-ninth Divisions the battle raged
most furiously, and the weight of the attack was more than the thin line could
sustain. The Germans had rapidly followed up the 151st Brigade as it drew out,
and there was a fierce action round Merville and Robermetz in the early
afternoon of April 11. The exhausted Durhams turned furiously upon their
pursuers, and there was fierce hand-to-hand work in which even General Martin
and his Headquarters Staff found themselves handling rifles and revolvers. The
Thirty-first Division (Bridgford) had come up and taken position in the rear of
the Twenty-ninth, with their left flank facing east to hold off the enemy, who
were now close to Steenwerck in the north. By nightfall Merville had gone, and
so had Neuf Berquin, which lay between the 151st and the 149th Brigade, rather
in the rear of the latter' s right. At this period the Twenty-ninth Division,
with the Thirty-first behind it, was on the left or north of the 149th Brigade,
covering the ground between Neuf Berquin and Steenwerck. The enemy had turned
the right of this line as already described, and now through the events in the
north, which will soon be narrated, the left of the Twenty-ninth Division was
also turned, and the situation became most dangerous, for the enemy was in
great force in front. A consultation was held by the various general officers
affected, and it was decided to make a side slip under the cover of darkness to
the line of Vierhouck&mdash;Meteren Becque. The British had to fight, however,
to gain this position, so far had the enemy outflanked them, and when the 149th
Brigade, with their indomitable Northumbrians, now reduced to a few hundred
men, had cut their way through to Vierhouck it was only to find it empty and
the British line about 1000 yards to the west of it, where the 4th Guards
Brigade of the Thirty-first Division had just begun to arrive. The
Northumbrians held on to Vierhouck none the less on the morning of April 12,
and the Guards Brigade came forward.</p>
<p>Whilst this stern fighting had been in progress, and while the Fifty-fifth
kept its iron grip upon Givenchy and Festubert, the Fifty-first Highland
Division to its north, along the line of the Lawe Canal, had been very hard
pressed. All three brigades had been engaged in most desperate defence and
counter-attack, the fighting being so close that two at least of the Brigadiers
had been compelled to drop maps and binoculars, while they seized rifles from
their oderlies. The canal was half dry and offered a poor front, but it was
sustained until the Germans got across in the north where the left flank of the
153rd Brigade was turned and had to fall back. The Gordons and Black Watch of
this unit fought most fiercely in the neighbourhood of Vieille Chapelle, and
the Germans will long remember their meeting with the clansmen. Finally their
line swung back west of Lestrem, keeping in touch with the right flank of the
Fiftieth Division.</p>
<p>At this period the 184th Brigade was the only one in the Highland Division
which was still capable of service, for the others had lost so heavily and were
so wearied that rest was absolutely necessary. The Sixty-first Division (Colin
Mackenzie), still very weak after its service on the Somme, came up in the
Robecq sector, and, with the aid of the surviving Highland Brigade, formed a
barrier to the terrific German pressure, the whole coming under General
Mackenzie. This line was held by these troops up to the 23rd of April.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, to revert to the early days of the battle, the German attack was
raging with great fury upon the centre and left of this line, and finding a gap
between the Twenty-ninth Division and the 149th Brigade it poured through it
with most menacing results, but the 4th Guards Brigade counter-attacked and
retrieved the situation west of the Vieux Berquin-Neuf Berquin road, as will be
told in detail in the next chapter. Farther north, however, the German attack
made more progress and rolled forward to the south of the village of Merris.
The 6th Northumbrians with only two officers left standing&mdash;one of them
their gallant Colonel, Temperley,&mdash;still held on to their old stance at
Vierhouck, though reduced to the strength of a company, and in such a state of
physical exhaustion that the men fell to the ground fast asleep between the
attacks. One young soldier woke up during his nap to find the Germans among
them, on which he sprang up, shot the German officer, and organised a charge
which re-established the line. As darkness fell on the evening of April 12 the
survivors of the Fiftieth Division were drawn from the line, though some were
so entangled with other units that they stayed and shared in the severe
fighting of April 13.</p>
<p>As already shown the Givenchy bastion was held firm, which meant that the
Fifty-first Division was also to some extent helped to resist attack, since an
enfilade fire from the Fifty-fifth would beat upon any advance against them.
Such advances were repeatedly made upon April 11 and were splendidly countered.
North of this point the Fiftieth, Twenty-ninth, and Thirty-first Divisions had
all suffered heavily, while the line had been bent back in a curve from the La
Bass&eacute; Canal to a maximum depth of ten miles, ending on the night of
April 12 in a position from west of Merville through the two Berquins to
Merris. The Twenty-ninth Division, which is a particularly good comrade in a
tight place, had been very hard pressed, with its brigades sent hither and
thither wherever a leak was to be stopped.</p>
<p>It was in this action that Colonel Forbes Robertson, one of the heroes of
Cambrai, earned the coveted Cross by fighting on horseback at the head of his
men like some knight of old, and repeatedly restoring the line when it was
broken. In spite of all valour, however, the general movement was westwards.
Whilst these misfortunes had occurred in the southern sector, others not less
serious had occurred in the north, owing to the great extension of the German
attack. It is to these that we must now turn.</p>
<p>The enemy had achieved a considerable success upon April 9 when they
succeeded in establishing themselves across the Lys at Sailly and Bac St. Maur,
because by doing so they had got to the south-west of Armenti&egrave;res. They
had prepared another attack in the north, and it was evident that if it had any
success the Armenti&egrave;res position would be impossible. Early in the
morning of April 10 the usual shattering and pulverising bombardment which
preceded a full-dress German attack broke out upon the right of the Second
Army, involving the front from the Ypres&mdash;Comines Canal in the north down
to the Lys River at Armenti&egrave;res, thus joining up with the battle of
yesterday, and turning the ten-mile front into one of twenty. The chief points
in this line are Hollebeke in the north, Wytschaete in the centre, and Messines
in the south, with Ploegsteert Wood and village and Nieppe as the final
connecting links with Armenti&egrave;res. It was all classic and sacred ground
drenched with the blood of our bravest. There can be few regiments in the
British Army which have not at one time or another left their dead upon this
shell-pitted slope, or upon the levels which face it.</p>
<p>The order of the Second Army from the north at this time was Twenty-second,
Eighth, Second, and Ninth Corps. It was the Ninth Corps (Hamilton-Gordon) which
was now attacked. The order of the divisions upon this front was Campbell's
Twenty-first Division astride the Ypres-Menin road, the Ninth (Tudor) in the
Hollebeke district, the Nineteenth (Jeffreys) covering 6000 yards east of
Messines and Wytschaete from Ravine Wood in the north to the Douve in the
south, and finally the Twenty-fifth Division (Bainbridge) on the right, which
was already in a most unfavourable position, as its right flank was menaced by
the driving in of the Fortieth and threat to the Thirty-fourth on the preceding
day, while one of its brigades, the 74th, had been taken away to cover
Steenwerck from the German advance at Bac St. Maur. It was upon these
divisions, and, in the first instance, upon the two southern ones that the new
German attack from the Fourth Army of our old enemy General von Armin broke on
April 10. It should be remembered that, like so many of their fellow-units,
both of these divisions had been very heavily engaged in the south, and that
their losses within the last two weeks had been very great. Verily we have
travelled far from the day when it was laid down as an axiom that a corps which
had lost a quarter of its numbers would not stand to its work until time had
effaced the shock.</p>
<p>Since the main assault on April 10 fell upon the Nineteenth Division the
story can be most plainly told from their central point of view. The left of
their line was held by the 58th Brigade (Glasgow), consisting of the 6th Welsh
and 9th Welsh Fusiliers, The right was held by the 57th Brigade (Cubitt) which
contained the 10th Warwick, 8th Gloucester, and 10th Worcesters. The 56th
(Heath) was in reserve. It was upon these troops that there fell the strain of
an attack which can seldom have been exceeded in severity. The total German
force on the corps front was eleven divisions, and of these no less than five
were directed on the morning of April 10 upon the depleted ranks of General
Jeffreys' unit. A very thick mist prevailed, and through this protective screen
the German infantry advanced about 6 o'clock, driving swiftly through all the
forward posts, and putting them out of action in exactly the same fashion as on
March 21. The enemy were in great numbers, and their advance was swift and
resolute. Within half an hour of the first alarm they had made a lodgment in
the main position of the 57th Brigade, and had also broken in the face of the
left wing of the Twenty-fifth Division to the south. The garrisons of the
outlying posts were never seen again, and it was observed that they were
greatly hampered by their camouflage screens which they had no time to tear
away in the face of so rapid and overwhelming an attack. At 6.40 the enemy were
deep in the position of the 57th Brigade, especially near Gapard Spur, which
marked the centre of that unit. At 7:30 the whole brigade was in difficulties,
which was more marked in the centre than on either flank, but was serious at
every point of the fine. The 8th North Staffords of the Reserve Brigade were
brought up at this hour to help in the defence of this weakening sector. Before
they could arrive upon the scene the enemy had made such progress that he had
reached the crest of the ridge and had occupied the village of Messines. The
68th Brigade in the north had not yet been attacked, but General Glasgow seeing
his right flank entirely exposed had thrown back a defensive line. Close to
this line was a post named Pick House, and upon this the mixed elements on the
left of the 67th Brigade, chiefly men of the 10th Warwicks, now rallied and
formed a strong centre of resistance. The Twenty-fifth Division to the south
had been also very hard pressed, and was in immediate danger of losing the
important knoll, Hill 63, so that the reserve brigade of the Nineteenth
Division had to send the two remaining battalions, the 4th Shropshires and 9th
Cheshires, to strengthen their defence. There was thus no longer any support
for the Nineteenth Divisional fighting line in their great need, save for the
5th South Wales Borderers, their pioneer battalion, and the 81st Field Company
R.E., both of whom were thrown into the battle, the pioneers pushing bravely
forward and connecting up with the 10th Warwicks at Pick House. Meanwhile the
8th North Stafford s had made a fine attempt to retake Messines, and had
actually reached the western edge of the village, but were unable to gain a
permanent footing. Their right was in touch with the 8th Gloucesters, and some
sort of stable line began to build itself up before the Germans. They had been
unable to occupy Messines in force, owing to the rifle-fire which became more
deadly with the rising of the mist. The scattered groups of infantry lying upon
the ridge on either side of Messines were greatly heartened by the splendid
work of A Battery, 88th R.F.A., under Captain Dougall, which remained among
them, firing over open sights at the advancing Germans. "So long as you stick
it I will keep my guns here!" he shouted, and the crouching men cheered him in
return. He was as good as his word, and only withdrew what was left of his
battery, manhandling it across almost impossible ground, when he had not a
shell in his limbers. This brave officer received the Victoria Cross, but
unhappily never lived to wear it.</p>
<p>The 8th North Staffords, still lying opposite Messines, extended their left
down the Messines-Wytschaete road in an endeavour to join up with the men at
Pick House. Thus a frail curtain of defence was raised in this direction also.
Shortly after mid-day things began to look better, for the gallant South
African Brigade (Tanner) of the Ninth Division was despatched to the rescue. So
severe had been its losses, however, that it numbered only 1600 bayonets, and
had hardly been re-organised into battalions. Late in the afternoon it
advanced, the 1st Battalion on the left, 2nd on the right, and though it had
not the weight to make any definite impression upon the German front it
entirely re-established the line of the road from Messines to Wytschaete, and
reinforced the thin fragments of battalions who were holding this precarious
front. The South Africans incurred heavy losses from machine-gun fire in this
very gallant attack.</p>
<p>The Ninth Division had hardly relinquished its Reserve Brigade when it found
that it was itself in urgent need of support, for about 2 o'clock on August 10
the attack spread suddenly to the northern end of the line, involving the 25th,
26th, and 58th Brigades, all under General Tudor, who was now responsible for
the Wytschaete front. So infernal was the barrage which preceded the attack,
that the right of the Ninth Division in the vicinity of Charity Farm was driven
in, and the 58th Brigade, with both flanks in the air and smothered under a
rain of shells, was compelled also to fall back upon its support line.</p>
<p>About 4 P.M. the 58th Brigade was broken near Torreken Farm, and the 6th
Wiltshires, who were the flank battalion on the right, were cut off and lost
heavily. The enemy were driving hard at this period towards Wytschaete, but the
9th Welsh stood fast in a cutting to the south of the village, and held the
Germans off with their rifle-fire. So ended a most trying and unfortunate day,
where the overborne troops had done all that men could do to hold their ground,
fighting often against five times their own number. The prospects for the
morrow looked very black, and the only gleam of light came with the advent,
about midnight, of the 108th Brigade (Griffiths) from the Ulster Division, with
orders to fight alongside the exhausted 57th, whose commander, General Cubitt,
was now directing the local operations to the west of Messines. The Wytschaete
front was also strengthened by the inclusion in the Ninth Division of the 62ncl
and later of the 64th Brigade of the Twenty-first Division. Farther south the
75th Brigade north of Armenti&egrave;res had been driven back by the enemy's
attack, and the 7th Brigade on its left, finding its flank uncovered, had
hinged back upon Ploegsteert Wood, where it held its line as best it might.
Thus on the left, the centre, and the right there had been the same story of
unavailing resistance and loss of valuable, dearly-bought ground . Even more
serious, however, than the local loss was the strategical situation which had
been created by the German advance in the lower sector, by their crossing the
Lys, and by the fact that on the night of April 10 they were closing in upon
Steenwerck and La Cr&egrave;che far to the right rear of the defenders of the
Messines line. It was a situation which called for the highest qualities of
generals as of soldiers.</p>
<p>By the morning of April 11 General Plumer, dealing out his reserves
grudgingly from his fast diminishing supply, placed the 147th Brigade of the
Forty-ninth Yorkshire Territorial Division (Cameron) behind the Twenty-fifth
Division in the Ploegsteert region, and a brigade of the Twenty-ninth Division
to the north of it. Such succours were small indeed in the face of what was
evidently a very great and well-prepared attack which had already shaken the
whole northern front to its foundations. The Higher Command had, however, some
points of consolation. If the vital sectors could be held there was the
certainty that strong reinforcements would arrive within a few days from the
south. The Amiens line was now certainly stabilised, and if once again an
equilibrium could be secured then the last convulsive efforts of this titanic
angel of darkness would have been held With no illusions, but with a dour
determination to do or die, the British line faced to the east.</p>
<p>The immediate danger was that a gap had opened between Messines and
Wytschaete, while another was threatened farther south between Ploegsteert and
the Nieppe-Armenti&egrave;res road. The pressure upon the Damstrasse was also
very great in the region of the Ninth Division. The first disposition in the
Messines area was to strengthen the line of resistance by pushing up the three
battalions of the 108th Brigade, the 1st Irish Fusiliers on the left near Pick
House, the 9th Irish Fusiliers west of Messines, and the 12th Irish Rifles in
the Wulverghem line. The attack on the morning of April 11 was not heavy in
this direction, but was rather directed against the Twenty-fifth Division in
the Ploegsteert district, where it came omniously close to Hill 63, a
commanding point from which, the Messines position of the British would be
taken in reverse. General Jeffreys of the Nineteenth Division determined none
the less to stand his ground, but he threw out a defensive flank along the
Messines-Wulverghem road, and mounted machine-guns to hold any attack from the
south. Meanwhile the 67th, South African, and 108th Brigades, in spite of this
menace to their right rear continued to hold the Messines front. There was
severe fighting on this sector during the afternoon in which the remains of the
2nd and 4th (Transvaal Scots) Battalions were pushed back for some distance,
but counter-attacked under the lead of Captain Green, regaining most of the
ground that they had lost, and connecting up with the 6th South Wales
Borderers, who were still holding fast near Pick House. This line was
maintained until the general withdrawal. It was further strengthened by the
146th Brigade, one of the three units of the Forty-ninth Division, which were
all engaged at different points. One battalion, the 7th West Yorkshires, called
on suddenly to fill a gap, made a very fine advance under heavy fire, and
restored the situation. It remained in the line until, on April 16, it was
almost annihilated by a terrific German attack upon it.</p>
<p>But the situation on the right rear was getting worse and worse. In the
evening it was definitely known that Hill 63 had at last fallen after a long
and obstinate struggle. The Twenty-fifth, and later the Thirty-fourth Divisions
had held up against great odds, but the main force of the enemy was now
striking upon that line, and the British were forced to withdraw from Le Bizet
towards Nieppe. These April 9-12. (German gains enforced a completely new
re-arrangement of the forces in the north if they were to avoid being taken in
the rear. This change of a wide and far-reaching character was quickly and
safely effected during the night of April 11 and 12. It involved moving back
the three northern corps into their battle zones, leaving only outposts in
advance. They still covered Ypres, but the retirement meant that all that had
been won in the mud-and-blood struggle of 1917 had passed into German keeping,
and coupled with the loss of Messines it seemed to threaten that the old
salient might be renewed in as disastrous a fashion as ever. This retirement
was rather in the nature of a precaution against the possibilities of the
future. What was of most immediate importance was the withdrawal of the lines
which were at such close grips with the enemy to the west of Messines. By the
morning of April 12 the general line of the Nineteenth Corps was Steeuwerck
Station, Pont-d'Achelles, Neuve &Eacute;glise, Wulverghem, Wytschaete. No
immediate German attack followed on the withdrawal. This abstention on the part
of the enemy was due in part to the wonderful work done by a small nest of four
machine-guns on the Messines-Wulverghem road under the command of Lieutenant
Hodgson. This small unit had already fought for forty-eight hours, but on this
third day of the battle their services were invaluable, for they shot down
hundreds of Germans as they endeavoured to debouch from Messines and descend
the slope. Save for two wounded men none of this band of heroes ever returned.
Among other detachments who behaved with great heroism were a few men of the
5th South Wales Borderers, B Company, under Captain Evans, who maintained
themselves at Pick House, north and east of Messines, for three days, until
they were at last rescued by the 58th Brigade from the north.</p>
<p>Whilst these fresh dispositions and general retrogressions had been made on
this front the Thirty-fourth Division to the south had also been compelled to
rearrange its positions. It has already been described how, under cover of the
147th Brigade, they withdrew in absolute order across the Lys. April 11 saw
such continued pressure, however on the right of the Twenty-fifth and the whole
of the Thirty-fourth Divisions that it became clear early in the afternoon of
April 11 that further retirement was imperative. This began at dusk, the three
brigades retiring by the Armenti&egrave;res-Bailleul road, while the 147th
still acted as rearguard. They retired through the 74th and 88th Brigades near
Bailleul Station, fighting back all the way and considerably harassed by the
German guns. On the morning of the 12th the general line was
Steam-mill&mdash;Bailleul Station&mdash;southern border of La Cr&egrave;che to
a point about 500 yards north-east of Pont d'Achelles on the Bailleul road.
Along this line the order of battle from the south was the 147th, 75th, 101st,
74th, 102nd, and 88th Brigades. Nieppe, which had been evacuated, was occupied
by the enemy later in the day, and on the evening of April 12 the line was
pushed a little farther back to De Seule.</p>
<p>There was no fighting on the new line opposite Messines on April 12, but the
battle was, as has been shown, raging furiously elsewhere, and the The
situation in the south, where the enemy was making progress, must deeply affect
that in the north. Had an aviator taken a swift flight from Hollebeke to
Givenchy on this day, following the deep curve which had formed in the British
line, his observations would have been roughly as follows: in the Hollebeke
district he would have found no extreme pressure, and that the Ninth Division,
reinforced by the 58th Brigade, was holding the line not far westward of their
original position. From there onwards he would have skirted the new line of the
Ninth Corps, as already indicated, and would have seen the remains of the
Nineteenth Division covering the north of it, the Twenty-fifth Division, also
in fragments, about Neuve &Eacute;glise, and the Thirty-fourth Division near
Steenwerck. He would next observe with consternation or joy according to his
colours, that there was a considerable gap before Bailleul. At the other side
of this gap he would come upon elements of the Thirty-first and Twenty-ninth
Divisions, hard-pressed and worried by the advance which the enemy had made
through Merville on their right. He would catch a glimpse also of some thin
lines of resistance, still farther south, which represented all that was left
of the Fiftieth Division. Finally, he would see the Fifty-first and the
Fifty-fifth on the extreme south, both of them standing firm in their
positions. Looking eastwards he would see pouring across the Lys the legions of
Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, hurrying to improve their blow, while behind the
British lines he would see new divisions, the Fifty-ninth Midlanders at
Wulverghem, the Thirty-third near Bailleul, the Sixty-first near Robecq, the
4th Guards Brigade followed by the First Australians near Hazebrouck, all
hastening with heavy hearts but the most grim determination to throw themselves
across the path of this German invasion which already threatened the most vital
points in Flanders. Far to the south also our aviator would perhaps have seen
the smoke of many trains, and out at sea might have made out the little dots
which marked in the one case French, in the other British, reinforcements. Such
was the general panorama upon the Flanders front on the evening of April
12.</p>

<p class="first">UP to April 13 twenty-eight German divisions had been traced
in the battle of Flanders. Since the whole British Army consisted of sixty
divisions, and only thirteen had been engaged in Flanders, one can gather how
terrible had been their task.</p>
<p>By the fourth day of the battle the purpose of the enemy became more clear.
It was evident now that his attack consisted really of three movements. The
northern of these, consisting of about six divisions, had for its task to drive
through Wytschaete and Messines to Bailleul. At present it was held up in the
north by the Ninth Division, but had made its' way in the south until Neuve
&Eacute;glise was the only village which intervened between it and Bailleul.
The central attack, consisting of the main force, had taken Armenti&egrave;res
and penetrated ten miles deep, capturing Merville, reaching the Clarence River,
touching Robecq, and threatening St. Venant. This deep penetration reacted upon
the British flanks to north and south of it. Finally, there was an advance by
seven or eight divisions in the south, which had been held at Givenchy, but had
bent the line back from that point, Bethune being the immediate objective. The
hammering of the Germans was remorseless and terrific. All that the British
needed was a little time, but it seemed as if it would be denied them. Help was
coming, but it did not arrive so quickly as the new divisions which Von Armin
and Von Quast were pouring over the Messines Ridge and across the plain of the
Lys.</p>
<p>The position was very menacing, as was shown by an order of the day from the
British Commander-in-Chief which is unique perhaps in our military
annals&mdash; a stern call to duty and to death, pitched on the very note which
would arouse the historic tenacity of the British soldier. Documents have been
avoided in this chronicle, but this one at least must be quoted in full. It was
addressed to all ranks of the British Army under his command.</p>
<p>"Three weeks ago to-day," said Sir Douglas Haig, "the enemy began his
terrific attacks against us on a fifty-mile front. His objects are to separate
us from the French, to take the Channel ports, and destroy the British
Army.</p>
<p>In spite of throwing already 106 divisions into the battle, and enduring the
most reckless sacrifice of human life, he has, as yet, made little progress
towards his goals. We owe this to the determined fighting and self-sacrifice of
our troops.</p>
<p>"Words fail me to express the admiration which I feel for the splendid
resistance offered by all ranks of our army under the most trying
circumstances.</p>
<p>"Many amongst us now are tired. To these I would say that victory will
belong to the side which holds out the longest.</p>
<p>"The French Army is moving rapidly and in great force to our support.</p>
<p>"There is no other course open to us but to fight it out. Every position
must be held to the last man: there must be no retirement. With our backs to
the wall, and believing in the justice of our cause, each one of us must fight
to the end.</p>
<p>"The safety of our homes and the freedom of mankind depend alike upon the
conduct of each one of us at this critical moment."</p>
<p>No words can describe the danger of the crisis more clearly than this clear
call from a leader remarkable for his judgment and restraint, exhorting his men
to fight to the death with their faces to the raging German line, and their
backs to those all-important harbours on which the fate of the world was now
depending. The German vanguard was forty miles from Calais on the day that the
appeal was made, and there was no strong line to be forced, save that strongest
of all lines which was formed by Sir Herbert Plumer and his men.</p>
<p>A new unit had come into line on April 13. This was the Thirty-third
Division under General Pinney. It was at once thrust in to fill the gap in
front of Bailleul, where it found itself involved from that date onwards in
most desperate fighting, in which it was associated with the Thirty-first
Division. The narrative of the services and trials, both of them very great,
which were rendered and endured by these divisions may be best told in
consecutive form, as a too strict adhesion to the order of dates produces an
effect which makes it difficult to follow the actual happenings. We shall first
consider the operations at Hazebrouck and Meteren, where these two divisions
and the First Australian Division were chiefly concerned, and we shall
afterwards return to the north and follow the fortunes of the Nineteenth,
Twenty-fifth, Forty-ninth, Thirty-fourth, and other divisions which were
holding the northern curve.</p>
<p>The line was very weak on April 12 in front of Hazebrouck, and yet it was
absolutely vital that this important railway junction should not fall into
German hands. The need was pressing and desperate, for the German attack was
furious and unremitting, while the British line was so thin, and composed of
such weary units, that it seemed impossible that it could hold. The exhausted
remains of the Fiftieth Division, who had been at it continually ever since the
breaking of the Portuguese front, were hardly capable now of covering or
defending any serious front. Yet if the ground could be held, the First
Australian Division, brought hurriedly back from the Somme and in the act of
detraining, would be in the line within twenty-four hours. There have been few
moments more heavy with fate during the whole of the campaign. Everything
depended for the moment upon Finney's Thirty-third Division, upon the worn
remnants of the Twenty-ninth Division, upon the 92nd and 93rd Brigades, and
upon the 4th Guards Brigade of the Thirty-first Division who were brought up
from Pradelles, and thrown hurriedly across the path of the advancing Germans.
Of the Thirty-first Division the 92nd and 93rd Brigades had already been
heavily engaged on April II as already recorded. The Guards Brigade had been
delayed in its journey and was still fresh. General Reedman of the 92nd Brigade
was in local command, and the situation was a particularly difficult one. At
all costs Hazebrouck must be covered until reinforcements could arrive, for if
the line were cut there was no end to the possible evils. When Merris fell
General Reedman still held the heights west of Merris with the 10th East
Yorkshires, while the 11th East Lancashires were to the south, and the remnants
of the 86th and 87th Brigades of the Twenty-ninth Division held on to Vieux
Berquin. This line held until 5 P.M. on April 13 in spite of very stormy
attacks and very little help from the guns. About that hour the right of the
line gave way under severe pressure, and Vieux Berquin was taken, but the
Germans were bottled up in it and were unable to get forward. There they
remained until the great turn of the tide. We must now, however, turn our gaze
to the immediate south and follow the phases of the wonderful stand made by the
remaining brigade of the Thirty-first Division, the 4th Guards Brigade, who
found themselves involved in a desperate battle in front of Hazebrouck.</p>
<p>Without enumerating a number of obscure hamlets which are rather confusing
than helpful, it may be said that the brigade under General Leslie Butler
covered the north of the main road from Merville to Hazebrouck, with their
right resting upon the Bourre, a small sluggish stream. Vierhouck represented
roughly the centre of their line. It was a country of flat cultivated fields,
with many roads and water-courses lined with willows, which cut the view. There
were untouched farms with their human and animal occupants on every side. To
the west lay the great forest of Nieppe. On the right were the 3rd Coldstream,
on the left the 4th Grenadiers, with the 2nd Irish in close support. They were
in position on the morning of April 12, and at once found the enemy in front of
them, who after a strong preliminary bombardment advanced in great numbers
along the whole line. The rifle-fire of the Guardsmen was too deadly, however,
and the attack dissolved before it. The German machine-gunners were exceedingly
aggressive, "not to say impudent," as a Guards officer explained it, and many
losses were sustained from their fashion of pushing forward upon the flanks,
and worming their way into every unoccupied crevice. Nothing could exceed both
the gallantry and the intelligence of these men. Having cleared their front the
Guards endeavoured to advance, but the Coldstream on the right met with
murderous fire from the village of Pures Becques, and the movement could get no
farther, nor were the Grenadiers much more fortunate on the left, though
Captain Pryce with his company broke into some outlying houses, killing a
number of Germans, seven of whom fell to that officer's own automatic. This
whole gallant episode occurred under the very muzzles of a German battery,
firing with open sights at a range of 300 yards.</p>
<p>At this period the brigade seems to have got ahead of the general British
line, and to have had both flanks entirely exposed to every sort of enfilade
fire. About four in the afternoon the right company of the Coldstream,
numbering only forty men, had to turn south to face the enemy. The Germans had
thrust into the centre of the Coldstream also, but No. 2 Company of the
supporting Irish, acting without orders upon the impulse of the moment, and
aided by the surviving Coldstream, completely re-established the line. The
Irish, who were led by Captain Bambridge, were almost annihilated in their
dashing effort to ease the pressure upon their English comrades. Their leader
was wounded. Lieutenant Dent was killed, and only eleven men of the company
were left standing. On the left the Germans were 500 yards in the rear, and
here a rearrangement was called for and steadily carried out. An hour later
another violent attack was made at the junction of the two battalions, but it
also was driven back in disorder.</p>

<p class="caption">Rough Sketch of Guards' Position, April 13</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>The Germans had brought their guns well forward and into the open, but they
met their match in Lieutenant Lewis of the 152nd Brigade Royal Field Artillery,
who directed the scanty British artillery, and handled his pieces in a way
which was much appreciated by the weary Guardsmen.</p>
<p>The readjustment of the line enabled the 4th Guards Brigade to link up with
the 12th Yorkshire Light Infantry, pioneer battalion of their own division,
which was holding the line at La Couronne, and fought that day with the utmost
tenacity and resolution. On the left flank of the Yorkshiremen, near Vieux
Berquin, were the worn remains of the Twenty-ninth Division.</p>
<p>Night fell upon a sorely-tried but unconquered line. The two front
battalions had lost at least a third of their effectives. Under the screen of
darkness the position was re-organised, and it was hoped that the Fifth
Division, drawn back from Italy, would be able to effect a relief. This could
not be fully accomplished, however, and at best only a small contraction of the
front could be effected, so that the morning of April 13 found the exhausted
Coldstream and Grenadiers still facing the German attack. Their line had been
strengthened by the 210th Field Co. of the Royal Engineers. The front to be
held was A still very wide for so weakened a force.</p>
<p>It had been a hard day, but it was only the prelude of a harder one. On
April 13 the morning began with thick mist, of which the Germans took advantage
to rush their machine-guns to very close quarters. At early dawn the Coldstream
found themselves once more heavily attacked, while an armoured car came down
the road and machine-gunned the outposts at a range of ten yards. After severe
mixed fighting the attack was driven back. At 9:15 it was renewed with greater
strength, but again it made no progress. It is typical of the truly desperate
spirit of the men, that when every man save one in an outpost had been killed
or wounded, the survivor. Private Jacotin of the Coldstream, carried on the
fight alone for twenty minutes before he was blown to pieces with a grenade.
The left flank of this battalion had also been heavily attacked, the enemy,
with their usual diabolical ingenuity, shouting as they advanced through the
fog that they were the King's Company of the Grenadier Guards. They were blown
back none the less into the mist from which they had emerged. The 12th
Yorkshire Light Infantry was also four separate times attacked, but held to its
appointed line. This gallant unit fairly earned the title of the "Yorkshire
Guards " that day, for they were the peers of their comrades. Meanwhile,
however, outside the area of this grim fight the Germans had taken Vieux
Berquin, pushing back the scanty line of defence at that point, so that they
were able to bring up trench-mortars and guns to blast the Yorkshire battalion
at La Couronne out of its shallow trenches. Captain Pryce, on the extreme left
of the Guards, found the Germans all round him, and his Grenadiers were
standing back to back and firing east and west. The company was doomed, and in
spite of the gallant effort of a party of Irish Guards, who lost very heavily
in the venture, the whole of them perished, save for Sergeant Weedon and six
men who reported the manner in which their comrades had met their end. Captain
Pryce had led two bayonet charges, first with eighteen men, which was entirely
successful, and later with fourteen men, who buried themselves in the grey of
the German ranks, and there remained. Such was the end of No. 2 Company of the
4th Grenadiers, and of its commander. This brave man received a posthumous V.C.
in the record of which it is stated that with forty men he had held up a German
battalion for ten hours and so saved a break through.</p>
<p>Apart from this flank company the centre company of the Grenadiers at this
period consisted of six unwounded men, while the right company was twenty
strong. All the officers were down. They were hemmed in on two sides by the
enemy, but they were still resisting as the shades of night fell upon them. By
dawn the Grenadier battalion had ceased to exist.</p>
<p>The 3rd Coldstream on the right were hardly in better case. The right
company was surrounded, and fought until there was only a handful left. A few
survivors fell back upon the Fifth Division and the Australians who were now
well up to the line. The orders to the Guards had been to keep the Germans out
until the Australians could arrive. They had been faithfully obeyed. The total
casualties had been 39 officers and 1244 rank and file, the greater part from
two weak battalions; 17 per cent of the brigade mustered after the action.
Soldiers will appreciate the last words of the official report which are: "No
stragglers were reported by the A.P.M." It is an episode which needs no
comment. Its grandeur lies in the facts. Well might General de Lisle say: "The
history of the British Army can record nothing finer than the story of the
action of the 4th Guards Brigade on April 12 and 13."</p>
<p>Whilst the Guards had made their fine stand to the east of Hazebrouck, the
rest of the Thirty-first Division, covering a front of 9000 yards, had a most
desperate battle with the German stormers. The fine north country material
which makes up the 92nd and 93rd Brigades had never been more highly tried, for
they were little more than a long line of skirmishers with an occasional post.
In some parts of the line they were absolutely exterminated, but like their
comrades of the Guards, they managed somehow or other to retain the positions
and prevent a penetration until reinforcements arrived. The remains of the
Twenty-ninth Division on the left had also fought with the utmost devotion and
held the line at the price of a heavy drain upon their weakened ranks. It has
been calculated that the line held by the 31st Division upon these days was 5|
miles long, and that it was attacked by the 35th and 42nd German divisions, the
1st Bavarian Reserve, and 10th, 11th, and 81st Reserve divisions. It would be
well to continue the action upon the Hazebrouck front by giving at once an
account of the operations of the First Australian Division under General Sir
Harold Walker, which had the remarkable experience of being sent from Flanders
to the Amiens front, being engaged there, and now being back in the Flanders
front once more, all in little over a week. They detrained on April 12, and on
the 13th their 2nd Brigade (Heane) found themselves in front of Hazebrouck with
the remains of the 92nd British Brigade on their left and with the hard-pressed
4th Guards Brigade in front of them. In the evening the remains of the Guards
were withdrawn through their line, and they were facing the pursuing Germans.
On their left the Australians were in touch with the 1st Cameronians of the
19th Brigade in the Meteren area.</p>
<p>This fierce fighting was going on in a country which was new to war, with
unbroken soil, whole cottages, and numerous refugees, who by their flight
before the German vanguard complicated a situation which was already so chaotic
that it was very difficult for the generals on the spot to grasp the relative
positions of the attack and the defence.</p>
<p>On April 14 the Germans, advancing behind a deadly barrage, came forward
through Merris and Vieux Berquin. They soon found, however, that they had
before them fresh and steady troops who were not to be driven. The immediate
German objective was the high ground from Mont de Merris to Strazeele. The 2nd
Australian Brigade was on the right and the 1st (Leslie) on the left. Both were
equally attacked, and both met their assailants with a shattering fire which
piled the level plain with their bodies. Three lines swept forward, but none
reached the shallow trenches of the "digger" infantry. The 3rd and 4th
Battalions held the line to the north where the pressure was greatest. The One
hundred and twenty-third French Division was in support, but there was never
any need to call for their co-operation. Strazeele, however, was blown to
pieces by the German guns.</p>
<p>April 15 and 16 were comparatively quiet, and the Australians busily
strengthened their lines. On the 17th sharp attack was made upon the 1st and
4th Battalions on the left and centre of the 1st Australian Brigade, the
advance coming up the valley between Merris and Meteren. This also was cut to
pieces by rifle and gun-fire, so that it made no progress whatever.</p>
<p>The 3rd Australian Brigade (Bennett) had been in reserve, but it was
destined for severe service after Meteren had passed out of the hands of the
Thirty-third Division in the manner elsewhere described. They had actually
relieved some of the worn elements of the British Thirty-third and of the
French One hundred and thirty-third Divisions to the west of Meteren, and on
April 22 and 23 they endeavoured by two separate movements upon either flank to
fight their way back into the little town. The first operations carried out by
the 11th and 12th Battalions were successful, but the final push into the town
by the 9th and 10th met with heavy opposition, and the casualties were so great
that the attempt had to be abandoned. The three Australian brigades were
shortly relieved, after their very valuable spell in the line. They were
destined soon to find themselves with their comrades on the Somme once
again.</p>
<p>Whilst the 1st Brigade had won a complete defensive victory in the north of
the line, the 2nd Brigade had done equally well in the south. The 7th and 8th
Battalions were in the line, and both were heavily engaged, especially the
latter, which faced Vieux Berquin. The German attack was once again a complete
failure, and it was clear that the Australians had the historical honour in
Flanders as well as on the Somme, of saying, "Thus far and no farther," Area.
upon the sector which they manned.</p>
<p>We pass on to the movements of the Thirty-third Division, which arrived upon
the scene of action on April 11, and from that time onwards played an ever
increasing part in this great world crisis. General Pinney had the experience
of first being denuded of large part of his own proper force, which was given
away, brigade by brigade, to points of danger, and afterwards of not only
seeing them reunited under his hand, but of having the remains of four
divisions and a great number of details under him, and so being in actual
command of the whole operations to the south and west of Bailleul. To his
coolness, firmness, and well-tried fortitude, the nation owed much during those
few desperate days.</p>
<p>The 100th Brigade (Baird) was moved forward at once to come under the orders
of General Bainbridge, who, with his Twenty-fifth Division, had endured so much
in the Ploegsteert district and was in urgent need of help. We shall follow
them from the date of their detachment to that of their return to their own
unit. On April 11, after dusk, they took their position, covering Neuve
&Eacute;glise, the 16th King's Royal Rifles on the right of the line, the 2nd
Worcesters in the centre, and the 9th Highland Light Infantry in reserve, the
148th Brigade being on the left, and the 75th Brigade on their right, the
latter much exhausted by two days of battle. Immediately to the north lay the
much-enduring battle line of the Nineteenth Division, which has already been
fully described. Two points can hardly be described simultaneously, but these
facts are to be read in conjunctiou with those already given in the last
chapter, and it is to be understood that the whole situation at Neuve
&Eacute;glise reacted from hour to hour upon that farther north, since a German
capture of the town would place the enemy in the rear of General Jeffreys and
his men.</p>
<p>On April 12 there was no direct attack upon this area, but about 4 P.M. the
75th Brigade on the right, which was much worn, was driven back and a gap
created, which was filled in by such reserves as could be got together at the
shortest notice. In the morning of April 13 it was found that this flank was
still very open, the nearest organised unit being the 88th Brigade of the
Twenty-ninth Division, which was also stretching out its left in the hope of
making connection. The enemy, however, pushed through early on April 13,
getting to the rear of the 100th Brigade, and swinging north into Neuve
&Egrave;glise which they captured. The Glasgow Highlanders, the only battalion
of the Highland Light Infantry which wears Highland costume, attacked at once
with all the vigour of fresh troops, and cleared the Germans out of the town at
the point of the bayonet. The enemy had filtered into the brigade line,
however, and parties of them were in the rear of the Worcesters. The hardest
part of all was borne by the 16th King's Royal Rifles, who, being the flank
battalion, bore all the weight of an advance which had enveloped them upon
three sides, front, flank, and rear. Of this gallant battalion there were
hardly any survivors. The Worcesters threw back their right flank, therefore,
in order to cover Neuve &Eacute;glise upon the south and south-east, while the
Twenty-fifth Division were on the north and north-east.</p>
<p>The mishaps of a dark day were still not over, for the enemy about 4:30 made
a determined attack and again punctured the over-stretched line. Some of them
drove their way once more into Neuve &Eacute;glise, brushing aside or
scattering the thin line of defence. Another strong force broke into the front
of the 100th Brigade and drove a wedge between the Glasgow Highlanders and the
Worcesters. The headquarters of the latter battalion was in the Municipal
Building of Neuve &Eacute;glise, and put up a desperate, isolated resistance
for many hours. Colonel Stoney and his staff finally making their way back to
their comrades. In this defence the Chaplain, the Rev. Tanner, greatly
distinguished, himself. The survivors of the 2nd Worcesters had also maintained
themselves in Neuve &Eacute;glise as house neighbours to the German stormers,
but after mid-day on April 14, finding themselves entirely cut off, they fought
their way out, leaving the Square round the Church and Mairie piled with
corpses. The town was now entirely German, with results already described upon
the northern section of the outflanked line. Once more the Worcesters, the
heroes of the old Gheluvelt battle, had placed fresh laurels upon their faded
and battle-stained colours. The remains of the 100th Brigade were now
reassembled on the Ravelsberg ridge, west of Neuve &Eacute;glise, where they
faced their enemy once more. So worn was it that the survivors of the Rifles
and of the Highlanders were clubbed together to form one very weak composite
battalion. On their right now was a collection of odds-and-ends under General
Wyatt about a thousand strong, while on their left was the 103rd Brigade of the
Thirty-fourth Division, in support.</p>
<p>This latter brigade had aided in the defence of Neuve &Eacute;glise, and
done very severe service, two of the battalions, the 4th Yorkshire Light
Infantry and the 4th York and Lancasters, having sustained heavy losses. During
the two days in which the fate of the village hung in the balance these
battalions were engaged in constant defence and counter-attack, especially on
April 13, when in one desperate sally they captured a German colonel and nearly
a hundred of his men. When the village fell on April 14 the gallant
Yorkshiremen still held on close to it and gave no ground until they were
ordered that night into reserve. The other battalion of the brigade, the 5th
York and Lancaster, had been ordered to Steenwerck, where also it had borne a
distinguished part in the fight.</p>
<p>The Germans were now nursing their wounds and also digesting their gains, so
that there was a very welcome pause which was mainly in favour of the defence,
who had good hope of reinforcement. A number of French batteries appeared as
the forerunners of relief, and helped to break up an advance upon the
Ravelsberg on the morning of April 16. A second attack had no better luck. Some
posts were taken but were won back again with the help of the 9th
Northumberland Fusiliers of the 103rd Brigade.</p>
<p>April 17 saw a fresh attack which was preceded by a barrage which tore gaps
in the thin line of the Highlanders. It developed into an infantry attack,
which gave the enemy possession of an orchard near the line. The Highlanders,
aided by some of the 6/7th Scots Fusiliers of the 177th Brigade, tried hard to
win it back, but could at best only block the exits. After dark that night the
brigade was relieved by the 148th Brigade, and staggered out of the line with
only 800 men unscathed. General Baird's infantry had endured an ordeal which
exceeded what the most disciplined troops could be expected to survive: 58
officers and 1424 men had fallen in their splendid defence of Neuve
&Eacute;glise.</p>
<p>The other brigades of the Thirty-third Division had meanwhile been involved
in situations hardly less critical than those which had faced Baird's Brigade
at Neuve &Eacute;glise. Maitland's 98th Brigade, which found itself on April 12
in the Ravelsberg area, was placed to the north of Bailleul as a support to
that place, and the narrative of its doings will be found in the subsequent
account of the defence of Meteren.</p>
<p>The 19th Brigade (Mayne) of the Thirty-third Division had been detailed to
cover Meteren to the west of Bailleul against the northward sweep of the
Germans. At 9.40 on April 12 it was known that the enemy had got through at
Merville, that their cavalry had been seen at Neuf Berquin, and by noon that
this swiftly advancing tide was submerging Merris only three miles south of
Meteren. General Pinney, deprived of two of his brigades, had only under his
hand the 19th Brigade, with the 18th Middlesex Pioneers, 11th and 222nd Field
Companies Royal Engineers, and the 33rd British Machine-gun Corps under Colonel
Hutchinson, an officer who until he was gassed, was a tower of strength to the
defence. At mid-day the place was under heavy shell-fire. There is a windmill
in a prominent position south of the town overlooking the dead flats of
Flanders. In and around this was stationed the 1st Queen's West Surrey. East of
the town, facing Bailleul, was the 5th Scottish Rifles, while the 1st Scottish
Rifles (The Cameronians) were in reserve. The whole situation was under the
direct control of General Pinney, and he was reinforced in the course of the
day by several very welcome units&mdash;9th Corps Cyclists, 22nd New Zealand
Entrenching Battalion, and others. Strazeele was included in the line of
defence, which joined up in the night with the hard-worked Twenty-ninth
Division.</p>
<p>The situation on April 12 in this quarter of the field was most alarming.
Everything in the south seemed to be in a state of chaos, and the line was for
the moment absolutely fluid. The fall of Merville and of Estaires had been
exploited with extraordinary energy by the Germans, who were rushing on at the
very heels of the retiring and often disorganised troops, who were dead-beat
after two days and nights of constant exertion. It was all important to build
up some sort of line south of Meteren, but events were moving so fast that it
was doubtful if it could be done. It was here that the value of the new
machine-gun organisation, perfected during the winter, was brilliantly
exemplified. Colonel Hutchinson was able to throw forward the whole of his guns
to make up for the local weakness of the infantry, and he ran great risks in
doing so, since he had only broken men and stragglers to man the gaps between
his gun positions. The crisis was such, however, that any risk had to be taken,
and the 33rd Battalion of the Machine-gun Corps saved the situation. On the
other hand it is not too much to say that a humble hero, Driver Sharpies, whose
motor-lorry was handy, saved the 33rd Battalion, for he not only rushed up
eight guns under heavy fire, with their crews, but he brought up afterwards on
his own initiative the wire and other essentials which enabled them to hold
their position. It was a supreme example of what can be done by one brave,
clear-headed man. The German tide was flowing at a rate which was measured as
1&frac12; miles in forty minutes, but now it was to reach its limit, when it
came under the fire of these eight guns upon Windmill Hill. The advance was not
only from Merris in the south but even more along the Bailleul-Meteren road,
which was crowded with their troops. By dusk the infantry of the 19th Brigade
had taken the place of the weary fragments who lined the front, and the
immediate danger of a complete rupture of the line was over.</p>
<p>At 5:30 A.M. on April 13 the attack upon Meteren April 13. commenced with a
strong advance against the 1st Queen's at the Windmill, and gained some ground
in the centre. The usual tactics of rushing up machine-guns was tried, but in
spite of the mist they had very limited success. The 98th Brigade was now in
support, and the 2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders were ordered forward to
cover Meule Houck Hill on that side. At 10:30 the Queen's were again fiercely
attacked, and after changing hands three times the windmill in their position
remained with the stormers. At noon a well-knit line had been formed in front
of Meteren, with the Yorkshiremen of the 92nd Brigade in touch on the right,
while their brother Yorkshiremen of the 147th Brigade were on the left, drawn
respectively from the Thirty-first and the Forty-ninth Divisions. There were
cheering rumours that the First Australians and the One hundred and
thirty-third French were both speeding upon their way, but the need of the
present was very great, for the German guns were many, while there was hardly
one to aid in the defence.</p>
<p>At 4 P.M. the Germans were beating once more along the whole front of the
division, but by 5:30 were back in their own line, what was left of them, much
the worse for the venture. News came, however, that Vieux Berquin had fallen,
and that Meteren was to be taken next day at all costs. Meanwhile, in spite of
the severe fighting, the losses had not been heavy, save in the 1st Queen's,
which had borne all the brunt of three separate attacks. Colonel Kemp-Welch and
his men had a very severe ordeal that day. Cavalry appeared more than once in
front of the position, and one body, 200 strong, were cut to pieces by a sudden
concentration of machine-guns. The splendid machine- guns still played a
prominent part in the battle. One of them having been submerged by a rush of
the enemy. Corporal Hurd returned single-handed, advancing 200 yards beyond the
line, and brought it back upon his shoulder. At one time the supplies of belts
ran short, but they were brought up in most dashing fashion. "At noon," says an
officer, "the fighting limbers with belt-boxes, barrels, and S.A.A. were
galloped through a hail of shell to our gun positions in a style reminiscent of
the Royal Horse Artillery upon an Aldershot field-day." The result was great.
"Gunners and gun-commanders report having piled the dead enemy before their
guns."</p>
<p>Shortly after dawn on April 14 the 1st Queen's was in the wars once more,
and from six to eight there were constant attacks along the whole line from
Strazeele on the right to Bailleul Station on the left, the latter forming the
front of the Thirty-fourth Division. The 1st Cameronians, those stern
descendants of the Covenanters, beat the enemy away from Strazeele about noon.
At one time there were renewed attacks upon both the Queen's and the
Cameronians. It is difficult to know which was the more admirable, the
perseverance of the attacks or the tenacity of the defence. About five in the
evening another fierce wave of storm-troops swept up from the south; and for
one critical moment found a gap in the line. Two companies of the stalwart
labourers of the 2nd New Zealand Entrenching Battalion threw themselves into
the breach, and the position was restored. When night fell, the whole line,
though shaken, was still intact, and the assault had been a complete and a
costly failure. Such operations, which littered the fields of Flanders with
their dead, go far to explain the German weakness in the latter part of this
campaign of 1918.</p>
<p>April 15 was quiet in the morning on the front April i5. of Meteren, but the
afternoon proved to be disastrous at Bailleul, since Ravelsberg and Mont de
Lille were stormed by the Germans, with the result that the town had to be
vacated. The Thirty-fourth Division had been withdrawn from this position, and
the Fifty-ninth North Midlanders (Romer) had taken their place, but this
division had, as already described, suffered extraordinary losses on the Somme
front, and was in no condition to undertake another considerable operation. It
had already been partly engaged in Flanders, and its losses had been
increased.</p>
<p>Under these conditions it is not surprising that the determined assault of
the Germans should have forced the line. It would appear upon the map that this
German success entirely outflanked the position of the Thirty-third Division,
but fortunately a switch line had been constructed which was now manned by the
remains of the Thirty-fourth Division, while the Fifty-ninth passed through it
and concentrated in the rear. In this way an extension of the German success
was prevented, in spite of great energy upon the part of the enemy, who had his
patrols a kilometre to the west of the town before night. The 98th Brigade had
now taken the place of the 19th in the line, the 4th King's Liverpools
relieving the Queen's at the Windmill, while the 5th Scottish Rifles relieved
the Cameronians near Strazeele.</p>
<p>In the efforts to stop the German advance from Bailleul the 147th Brigade of
Cameron's Forty-ninth Yorkshire Division played an important part. This unit,
containing the 4th, 6th, and 7th Battalions of the West Riding Regiment found
themselves in the front line on the evening of April 15, and held hard to a
defensive position north-west of Bailleul. For two more days, April 16 and 17,
they maintained the fight, inflicting and receiving heavy losses, but with the
balance well in their favour. The dour Yorkshiremen made it clear at last to
their equally dour assailants, that there was no road through their ranks,
however they might thin them.</p>
<p>In the early morning of April 16 the enemy by a very sudden and violent
attack broke through the switch line and made a lodgment in the eastern
outskirts of Meteren. In spite of determined counter-attacks made during the
morning by the 1st Middlesex, the 4th King's, and the gallant New Zealand
Trench Battalion, it was not possible to clear these houses to which the enemy
s machine-gun parties clung with great bravery. Evening found them still in
possession, but all efforts to debouch to the north and west had been stopped.
The Australians were coming up on the right, so that the Thirty-third were able
to shorten their line.</p>
<p>One farm west of Meteren was penetrated by a pushful party of Germans, but
they were beaten out of it and destroyed by the 11th Field Company of sappers,
who took a number of prisoners.</p>
<p>On April 17 the 2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders had come into the
line, relieving the 18th Middlesex Pioneers. About 10 A.M. this battalion was
violently attacked, but drove back its assailants, as did the Thirty-fourth
Division on the left at about the same hour. At six in the evening another very
severe attack developed upon the front of the 4th King's. For a time the line
appeared to be penetrated, but the 1st Middlesex and units of the One hundred
and thirty-third French Division, which had newly arrived, made a brisk
counter-attack, and the situation was completely restored. It must indeed have
been discomposing to the enemy to find that each success which he won, whether
it was the taking of Neuve &Eacute;glise, of Bailleul, or later of Mount
Kemmel, instead of being an opening which led to victory, was . only a passage
to further trials and further losses in an unending vista. The edge of the
attack had now been completely blunted in this quarter. April 18 was quiet, and
on the 19th, as the Australians and French were up, arrangements were made for
drawing the Thirty-third out of the line which they had so splendidly made
good. Their losses in the six days amounted to 145 officers and 3302 men. A few
days later Monsieur Clemenceau arrived to convey to General Pinney and his
battle-worn men the thanks of the French Republic for their iron defence of an
essential line.</p>
<p>The Thirty-fourth Division was last mentioned in this narrative when it fell
back from Nieppe on April 12, and was afterwards compelled to take position on
the right of the Twenty-fifth Division in the De Seule neighbourhood. Among
other losses during the retreat was a tried soldier, General Gore of the 101st
Brigade.</p>
<p>On the 13th the enemy made several tentative attacks, but had no success.
Late in the afternoon, however, he had succeeded in penetrating the line of the
Twenty-fifth Division between Neuve &Eacute;glise and De Seule. This success
left the left flank of the Thirty-fourth in the air. The 103rd Brigade had
moved to the Ravelsberg Ridge, however, and so gave a definite line upon which
to withdraw, extending from Bailleul Station to Crucifix Corner, which was a
very important position. The 103rd Brigade was now on the left of the line, and
the 102nd on the right. There followed, on April 15, a day of very severe
fighting, the enemy making continual and very fiery attacks along the whole
line, especially upon the three points. Steam Mill, Mont de Lille, and Crucifix
Corner. The latter was carried by the enemy and then was retaken by the 9th
Northumberland Fusiliers. Mont de Lille was held by the 74th Brigade, and Steam
Mill by the 147th, each the centre of a very deadly combat. Steam Mill was lost
and yet again retaken by the Yorkshire Territorials who were aided by the 1st
Middlesex from the Thirty-third Division. It was a long and arduous day of
battle, inexpressibly trying to the wearied troops engaged. General Nicholson
had under his hand six brigades that day, and senior officers upon the spot
have testified to the masterly use which he made of them.</p>
<p>That night the Fifty-ninth came up into the front line and relieved the
exhausted infantry. The relief, however, was but a momentary one, for on the
afternoon of April 15 the Germans delivered yet another strong attack upon the
Ravelsberg line, now held by the Forty-ninth, Fifty-ninth, and Thirty-third
Divisions. The Fifty-ninth, as already described, fell back through the
Thirty-fourth Division, which again found itself in the front line. The two
flank divisions both fell back to conform, and lined up with the remains of the
Thirty-fourth on the new line near St. Jans Cappel, which held firm from April
16.</p>
<p>On April 17 there was yet another day of heavy fighting upon this line, both
flanks and the Meule Hook being strongly attacked, but the position was
successfully held, and one more limit seemed to have been reached in the
advance. The same six brigades under General Nicholson, reduced now to the
strength of battalions, were still throwing an iron, bar across the German
path. From the right the 147th, 74th, 101st, 102nd, 103rd, and 88th, all of
them with set teeth, held on to the appointed line which receded under pressure
and was yet again re-established. The 88th, under that remarkable young
soldier, General Freyberg, had some especially hard work to do. Late on April
20 this goodly fellowship in arms was dissolved, the three separate brigades
returned to heir divisions, and the Thirty-fourth was relieved by the French.
The artillery of the Thirty-eighth Area. Welsh Division fought throughout these
awful days onwards, at the back of the infantry, who could not say too much for
these guns or for General Topping who commanded them. Save two howitzers hit on
April 9, no gun of this division was lost during all this close and severe
fighting. South of the Lys many of the Royal Army Medical Corps remained with
their wounded, and were taken prisoners, sharing with their charges the
wretched treatment which was still meted out to British captives, especially
behind the lines and before reaching the camps in Germany.</p>
<p>It should be added that the sappers of the 207th, 208th, 209th Field
Companies and the 18th Northumberland Fusiliers Pioneers fought like ordinary
infantry, and did splendid and essential service in holding the line.</p>
<p>We shall now turn to Jeffreys' Nineteenth Division which we left on the 12th
of April, holding on to the Wulverghem&mdash;Wytschaete front, with formidable
enemies in front of them, but an even more formidable menace upon their right
flank, whence came constant rumours that the enemy had at last penetrated the
hard-pressed Twenty-fifth Division, had occupied Neuve &Eacute;glise, and was
pushing up along the lines of the northward roads which would turn the whole of
the position. Late at night on April 12 it had been ascertained that these
reports were premature.</p>
<p>The units of the 108th Ulster Brigade on the right of the line and
connecting with the Twenty-fifth Division had been penetrated and driven back,
but were strengthened and stayed by the advent of the 8th Gloucesters. The
situation was obscure on the right, and there was a dangerous gap which was
filled early in the morning of April 13 by the energy and initiative of Captain
Macintosh of the 94th Field Company Royal Engineers, who with a handful of the
10th Worcesters pushed his way in, and showed a bold front to the enemy.</p>
<p>The 2/5th Sherwood Foresters from the 178th Brigade (Stansfeld) of the
Fifty-ninth North Midland Division had also been ordered to face south and with
the help of some machine-guns to hold off the turning movement from that
quarter. All these movements were carried out in pitch darkness and amid a
situation so confused that it was impossible to define which was the attacking
line and which the line of defence. The general scheme of the battle in this
area on the morning of April 13 was that the Twenty-fifth Division, with the
help of the 148th Brigade of Yorkshire Territorials, was fighting desperately
in and around Neuve &Eacute;glise to the north of those units of the 100th
Brigade, whose defence of the town has already been described. Next to them on
the north lay the remains of the 108th Brigade, then the battalion of Sherwood
Foresters, and then the 57th Brigade with the 8th Gloucesters on the southern
flank. All the morning the roar of battle rose from Neuve &Eacute;glise where
the German stormers fought hand to hand with the British infantry, who had been
strengthened by the addition of that fine battalion, the 4th Shropshires from
the Nineteenth Division. The contest swung and swayed as fresh German troops
were thrown into the struggle, but at last about half-past ten in the morning
the attack was defeated, the German infantry fell back in sullen groups under
the constant fire of the defenders, and the British line was pushed forward to
the south of the village.</p>
<p>During the day, which was spent under heavy fire of artillery and the
imminent menace of attack from the grey clouds seen gathering upon the Messines
Ridge, the remaining battalions of the 178th Brigade, the 2/6th and the 7th
Sherwood Foresters, were pushed into the line to relieve the exhausted 108th
Brigade. It was clear that great German concentrations were being made upon
Neuve &Eacute;glise, and that the village was in danger, so every arrangement
was made to accommodate the line to the situation which would arise if that
important point were taken, and the Wulverghem position became in consequence
untenable. This new line would run from Meteren through Kemmel and Spy Farm to
Spanbrockmolen. The night of April 13 would have been quiet upon the front of
the Nineteenth Division had it not been for the constant pre-occupation and
alarm caused by the varying fortunes of the fighting at Neuve &Eacute;glise, in
which they were well aware that their own fate was concerned. The attack had
been renewed with fresh forces, and the Twenty-fifth Division was extremely
exhausted and could only be helped by other units which were in no better case.
Again and again the Germans were deep in the village. Again and again they were
evicted. It seemed to be the beginning of the end, however, when it was
announced towards morning that the Twenty-fifth Division was out of touch with
the British troops upon its south flank, and that the Germans filtering through
this gap had got to Nordhoek, west of Neuve &Egrave;glise, and were pushing to
the north in the rear of the British position. By morning of April 14 Neuve
&Eacute;glise had been abandoned, though it does not appear to have been
solidly occupied by the enemy until mid-day, and snipers of both armies
infested the ruins.</p>
<p>The loss of the village and of the low ridge which adjoined it had a most
sinister effect upon the general strategic position to the north, and it was
indeed fortunate that measures had been taken in advance to deal with the new
situation. The Nineteenth Division on April 14 found itself shelled heavily all
day, while it was machine-gunned and trench-mortared from the right where its
flank was now in the air. The position of the right-hand unit, the 4th
Shropshires, south of the Neuve &Eacute;glise-Wulverghem road, became
impossible, as the Germans were in the rear, and indeed upon three sides of
them.</p>
<p>Major Wingrove stuck to his position till mid-day, and no battalion could
have given a more cogent example of steadiness and fortitude in adversity.
About 2 P.M. the Germans began to emerge in force from the villages, beating up
against the gallant Shropshires, who retired slowly and steadily, taking toll
of their assailants, while the Sherwood Foresters of the 178th Brigade helped
them to hold the enemy at arm's length.</p>
<p>As the day wore on the pressure became more insistent, until about seven in
the evening Major Wingrove, of whom it has been stated by his General that "his
tenacity, gallantry, and determination had held the much-tried and isolated
line up to this time," was severely wounded. When his inspiring presence was
removed there was a break to the north of Neuve &Eacute;glise and the
Twenty-fifth Division, now reduced to a handful, were retreating westwards,
while the Nineteenth was being rolled up from the south.</p>
<p>General Jeffreys' force was now in so dangerous a position that it had
actually to form a front to the west as well as to the east, a difficult
manoeuvre which was carried out with great coolness and skill by Colonel Sole
of the 10th Worcesters, who was in charge of the new line, aided by Major
Parkes of the 8th Gloucesters. The men were rallied, led into their new
positions, and a dangerous penetration was narrowly averted. Later a new line
was built up with the Forty-ninth Yorkshire Territorial Division in the place
of the Twenty-fifth Division on the right, reinforced by the 71st Brigade from
the Sixth Division. Next to them on the left was the 178th Sherwood Foresters
Brigade, then the 108th Brigade, and finally the 58th Brigade, standing, just
in their old positions. The changes in the British line were such that whereas
it used to face east, it now faced almost south from near Meteren to Kemmel and
Spanbrockmolen. The latter marked the point of junction upon the left with the
right of the Ninth Division. This line was not fully occupied till April
16.</p>
<p>On April 15 the intermediate positions were attacked, the 9th Welsh
Fusiliers, on the extreme left of the line, and the remains of the 6th
Wiltshires being heavily engaged. No impression was made. At a different point
the Germans had better results to show with the 108th Brigade, and made some
progress, but the Sherwood Foresters once more mended the line. In the evening
it was reported that the enemy had taken Crucifix Corner and were moving
westwards. The strength of all battalions had now fallen to such a point, owing
to constant shelling and incessant attacks, that it was very difficult to form
more than a line of outposts. By evening of April 15 all the troops concerned,
the remains of the Twenty-fifth, the Forty-ninth, and the Nineteenth Divisions
were on the general line Meteren&mdash;Kemmel, facing south to the German
advance, but also threatening the German right flank if they should press too
far to the west. The remnant of the 108th Ulsters was relieved that night.</p>
<p>A heavy attack was made at 6 A.M. on the morning of April 16 upon the front
of the Ninth Division, which had withdrawn in conformity with the new northern
line. The 62nd Brigade of the Twenty-first Division had, as already stated,
been put under the orders of General Tudor of the Ninth Division, for his unit
had been greatly weakened by the terrible losses of the South Africans. The
North Countrymen of the 62nd fought desperately against great odds, but they
were pushed out of Spanbrockmolen, and later out of Wytschaete.</p>
<p>They found a new line to the north, however, and the Germans tried in vain
to bend it. The 58th Brigade had thrown back its own line to correspond, and
joined up with the 62nd at Lacache Farm. Late that evening the worn and weary
troops were deeply comforted by the sight of a small group of blue-clad men
with classical helmets surveying the German lines through their glasses. It was
the vanguard and the observers of the Twenty-eighth and One hundred and
thirty-third French Divisions which were coming up to the aid of the Ninth. It
was clear that the commanding position of Kemmel, a hill which overlooks a wide
range of country, was the immediate objective of the enemy in this quarter.
About 10 A.M. on April 17 they put down a heavy barrage, and then pushed on in
force with the intention of breaking in the British line and capturing the
hill. The battalions attacked were the three Sherwood Foresters units, with the
8th North Staffords and 10th Warwicks of the 57th Brigade. This attack was a
complete failure. Weary as they were the sturdy Englishmen stood fast to their
lines, and beat their assailants back in blood and ruin. Machine-gun fire from
the crest of the hill contributed to the result, and the guns also did their
share. The only German gain was a post called Donegal Farm between the
Nineteenth and the Forty-ninth Divisions. A fresh attack was made upon the 10th
Warwicks in the evening, but this also was thrown back with heavy loss.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the northern sector, the Ninth Division endeavoured to regain
the ground which they had lost the day before, but their efforts had no great
success, save that the 7th Seaforths of the 26th Brigade in a very brilliant
advance fought their way into Wytschaete once more, and took possession of the
village which they held until the following day, when the general position
forced them to abandon it. On April 18 the fighting died down upon this front,
and in the evening the gallant Nineteenth Division, after most glorious
service, was relieved by the French Twenty-eighth Division, which took over the
defence of Kemmel Hill. The total losses of this division had been nearly 4000
men, which, coming on the top of the heavy losses on the Somme in the previous
fortnight, formed such a record as had seldom been equalled. Nor was their
ordeal yet at an end, and many a stout battle was still to be fought before a
rest should come.</p>
<p>All these stirring episodes, including the glorious destruction of the 4th
Brigade of Guards, the formation of a permanent line by the Australians, the
defence of Meteren and Bailleul by the Thirty-third and other divisions, the
fighting at Neuve &Eacute;glise, and the defence of the Wytschaete and Messines
fronts by the Nineteenth and Ninth Divisions with odd brigades to help them,
all came within the area of Plumer's Second Army, which still consisted of the
Ninth and Fifteenth Corps in the line. It should be mentioned that of fourteen
divisions contained in this army on March 21 no less than twelve had been sent
down to the Somme, while the remaining two, the Forty-ninth and Twenty-ninth,
were under orders to go at the moment when the great battle in Flanders broke
out.</p>
<p>We shall now for a moment turn to the left flank of the First Army in the
south which had so far, in spite of heavy attacks, lost very little ground. It
has already been described how the Fifty-fifth Lancashire Division stood like a
rock at Givenchy and Festubert, while the Fifty-first and afterwards the Fourth
Division struggled desperately to hold back the attack on their left. The
former had been relieved on April 16 by Strickland's First Division, while the
Highlanders and April le. Fourth Division also had been drawn out, and gave
place to Deverell's Third Division, which had done so splendidly and lost so
heavily upon the Somme. After the repulse from the Fifty-fifth Division, the
Germans had contented themselves with shelling but they had pushed on, as
already narrated, to the north of the position, and had got as far as Locon.
The result was that the First Southern Division had a long frontage which faced
due north and a shorter frontage to the east.</p>
<p>The Fourth Division held the front at this period to the east of Robecq,
being on the right of the Sixty-first, with the 184th Brigade between them. It
was used on April 14 for a counter-attack which was carried out at night, and
which achieved a local success by the recapture of the village of Riez, with
150 prisoners. This operation was carried out by the 11th Brigade, with the 1st
Hants and 1st Somersets in the lead, and was a very workmanlike little action
which was the more valuable when coming at a period of general recoil.</p>
<p>On April 18 the new German attack upon the First Division at Givenchy began,
with a bombardment of great violence. Their plan upon this day was to carry
Givenchy and Festubert by storm, and to win the line of the canal as far west
as Gorre. They would then capture the high ground at Hinges, and so command the
canal right up to Robecq. No doubt they calculated, and with justice, that if
they could overcome the men on the spot they would find that the reserves had
all been drawn away to the north. Their plan was wrecked, however, by the fact
that the men on the spot were not to be overcome. Eighteen German battalions
moved forward to the attack, and all of them suffered, heavily without gaining
any appreciable advantage. So heavy was the slaughter that many German
companies were reduced before evening to twenty or thirty effectives, while the
three battalions of one regiment were left under the respective command of one
lieutenant and two sub-lieutenants. There have been few more costly failures,
considering the scale of the operations, in the whole campaign.</p>
<p>The infantry attack was on the two flanks of the British line which looked
northwards, the one attack being in front of Hinges and the other covering the
space from Loisne to the south of Givenchy, including Festubert. Three German
regiments, the 98th, 361st, and 202nd Reserve, advanced in this quarter. They
had constructed two bridges during the night to cross a broad ditch in front of
the British line, but machine-guns were trained upon them, and the troops which
tried to cross were exposed to heavy losses, which left both the bridges and
the banks heaped with bodies. The mist, the smoke, and the dust from the shells
were so thick, however, that a hundred yards was the limit of visibility. The
German shell-storm continued to be very heavy, but the British were snugly
ensconced in trenches with a parapet and parados, both of which were several
feet thick, so that no very great harm was done. The worst losses were at the
advanced keep at Festubert, which was blown to bits, only eight men of the
garrison surviving.</p>

<p class="caption">Defence of Givenchy by the First Division, April 18,
1918.<br>
(This rough plan was drawn by an officer engaged in the action.)</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>The First Division had two brigades in the line, the 1st on the right
holding from Givenchy to Le Plantin, and the 3rd to the left from Le Plantin to
Festubert. The fighting was particularly severe in the latter sector of the
line. As the garrison looked north they saw through the rising mist about 8:15
in the morning the enemy advancing in small groups of light machine-guns,
coming over a slight rise some 900 yards east of Festubert. These troops pushed
bravely on, though they had no cover but shell-holes and they suffered very
severely. The 1st Gloucesters, under Colonel Tweedie, on the right and the 1st
South Wales Borderers on the left, battalions with the halo of the first Ypres
battle round their heads, held the line and littered the open ground with their
steady rifle-fire. There was a gap in the defences at a point called Willow
Road, and into this the enemy poured more quickly than they could be shot
down.</p>
<p>Their rush carried them through, and into the houses and gardens of Le
Plantin. A company of the Gloucesters under Captain Handford was cut in two,
but both sections stood fast, Lieutenant Hall on one side, end the company
commander on the other, closing in on the centre and preventing reinforcement,
while Lieutenant Gosling attacked with the reserve company. The Germans ran
field-guns right up, but the crews were shot down. So matters remained until
the afternoon, the stormers being in the British position, but so pinned down
by rifle-fire that they could not raise their heads. On the other hand, German
snipers in the houses and trees were very deadly to any runners or other
exposed defenders. Whilst matters were in this stage in the Le Plantin area,
they were even more critical at Festubert. The enemy, moving up behind a good
barrage, overran a part of the South Wales Borderers and forced their way into
an orchard just south of the keep known as Route A. Thence they tried to get
into the rear of the defence. About eleven Sergeant-Major Biddle of D Company
ran the gauntlet to Brigade Headquarters to explain the situation and ask for
help. Captain Smith got together a party of odds and ends, under twenty in
number, who made their way up the west side of Festubert and prevented the
extension of this dangerous German movement.</p>
<p>By two o'clock the attack was definitely defeated, and by three the Germans
were retiring along the whole line. They found it, however, very difficult to
disengage themselves from their advance positions. They tried to crawl back
from shell-hole to shell-hole, while the British stood up all along the
parapets and shot them in scores. Absolutely demoralised, many of the Germans
threw away their arms. Their retirement probably cost as much as their advance.
Those who had got into Le Plantin had to run the gauntlet between two halves of
the Gloucesters in getting out, and few of them escaped. The performance of the
1st Gloucesters was remarkable, for they were at one time attacked front,
flank, and rear by a force estimated at four battalions. It is recorded that
the barrels of their new Lewis guns were worn smooth by the intensity of one
day of battle. The 1st Brigade on the right of the defence from the canal to Le
Plantin was also heavily attacked, though their ordeal was not so long or
severe as that of their comrades on the left. The 1st Black Watch, the flank
battalion next to the Gloucesters, had some especially heavy fighting, but kept
their ground intact, and did their full share towards the victorious result.
The whole affair was a fine feat of arms, for the German gun power had greatly
increased since April 9, while the repulse was even more decisive. It proved to
be a final one, as the Germans made no further attempt to force their passage
to Bethune. During all this long fight the Third Division beyond Loisne on the
left was holding the line firmly against all German pressure. So ended April
18. Before the evening of the 20th all outlying posts had been cleared of the
Germans. On this same date, April 18, there was a sharp action to the immediate
left of this Givenchy fighting, when the Fourth Division held up a German
attack, and afterwards countered, capturing the Bois Paquan in the Robecq
sector. Two hundred prisoners were the fruits of this action, but they were
dearly bought, for many officers and men were killed or wounded. Among the
former were two grand soldiers. Colonel Armitage of the 1st Hants and
Brigade-Major Harston of the 11th Brigade. This forward movement was continued
later by the Sixty-first Division, who did very good work on April 23, General
Pagan of the 184th Brigade being a leader in the advance, which was notable for
a fine attack by the 2/5th Gloucesters under Colonel Lawson. Shortly afterwards
General Colin Mackenzie of this division, who had done splendid work from the
first days of the war, was wounded while reconnoitring in front of his line and
had to return to England.</p>
<p>There now followed a short pause in the German attack, and we may look
around and follow the general line of the defence at this period before the
action was renewed. On the extreme north of the Second Army the Belgians had
relieved the Thirtieth Division, and thus shortened the British line. Then came
the Ninth and Twenty-first British Divisions near Wytschaete. South and west of
this point the front line had been taken over by General de Mitry with the
Thirty-sixth French Corps, which now succeeded the Ninth British Corps in this
sector. The Thirty-fourth and One hundred and thirty-third French Divisions
were in the line, with the Second French Cavalry Corps in co-operation. This
most welcome and indeed vital reinforcement had taken over Kemmel, Mont Rouge,
Mont Noir, Mont Vidaigne, and Mont des Cats, the range of kopjes which screen
the Ypres plain from the south. On the right of the French was the weary
Fifteenth Corps, with the First Australian Division as the flank unit near
Meteren. The British divisions in the north were in close support to the
French, the Nineteenth and Thirty-fourth being near Poperinghe, and the
Twenty-fifth behind Kemmel. Such was the general position in that northern
sector, to which the battle was now more and more confined. Before following
the further events it should be mentioned that on April 17 the Belgians in the
neighbourhood of Bixschoote had been exposed to a very severe attack from four
German divisions, which would have shaken the whole line of defence had it
succeeded. It was met, however, with very great courage, and the Belgians
proved themselves to be valiant soldiers, well worthy to be admitted upon
entirely equal terms into the battle-line of the larger nations. They fought
the action with heroic gallantry, and gave the Germans a severe check, killing
some 2000 of them, and taking 700 prisoners with several guns. It was a notable
performance, and the more welcome in a period of such stress.</p>
<br>

"Position of the Line in Flanders, April 9"></a></div>
<p class="caption">Position of the Line in Flanders, April 9</p>
<br>
<p>On April 25, at an early hour of the morning, the Germans made an attack
upon the northern line from a point north of Bailleul to the east of
Wytschaete, a distance of about ten miles. The whole of this front, save the
extreme eastern portion, was held by the French, who made a very gallant
resistance to as fierce an assault as the war has seen. The main German
objective was the very important height of Mount Kemmel, a bluff five hundred
feet high, wooded upon the sides. This was held by the Twenty-eighth French
Division, who fought most gallantly, but were finally overpowered by the four
German divisions which were brought against it, including a division of Alpine
troops, especially trained for hill fighting.</p>
<p>The Allied line was pushed back along its whole front, Dranoutre and St.
Eloi falling into the hands of the Germans, together with 6000 prisoners. It
was the darkest hour of the Flemish battle, and was the more depressing as it
came after a week of equilibrium in which the tide of invasion seemed to have
been finally dammed. The German infantry had penetrated through the joining
point of the French and British near Wytschaete, and at the same time through
the French at Dranoutre, so that they were able to assail Kemmel Hill from both
sides. It had fallen by nine o'clock. The Ninth Division in the north was
forced to fall back upon the line of La Clytte, after enduring heavy losses in
a combat lasting nine hours, during which they fought with their usual
.tenacity, as did the 64th and 146th Brigades, who fought beside them. The
Germans, having got through the French upon the right flank, had got round to
the rear of the 27th Brigade, with the result that the 12th Royal Scots were
almost entirely destroyed, and the Scottish Borderers were also very hard hit.
None the less, with the enemy in front and rear, the Lowland infantry held out,
finally making their way back in orderly fashion during the night. Farther
north the line of the 64th and the 146th Brigades was broken and the remnants
reformed in Cheapside, where their reserve battalions thickened their array.
The 26th Highland Brigade threw back all attacks in front, and formed a
defensive flank to the south, withdrawing at leisure and in order after
dark.</p>
<p>Even the Ninth Division has seldom had a harder day, or a more honourable
one. On the 26th General Cameron of the Forty-ninth Division took over this
sector, and the Ninth went out of the line with very special messages of thanks
from both the British and French marshals.</p>
<p>Some small British units were involved in the disaster of Mount Kemmel as
they were on the hill helping in the defence. Among these were the 19th
Lancashire Fusiliers (Pioneers), the 456th Field Company R.E., and part of the
49th Battalion Machine-gun Corps, all drawn from the Forty-ninth Division.</p>
<p>A determined effort was at once made to retrieve the situation, and a
counter-attack upon the new German line was ordered for 3 A.M. on April 26. It
was carried out by the Thirty-ninth French Division on the right, and by the
Twenty-fifth Division (Bainbridge) on the left. The French advance was held by
severe machine-gun fire on the line of the Kemmel Brook. The British advancing
from La Clytte had more success, but were unable to maintain the ground which
they had won. They went forward with Griffin's 7th Brigade on the left and
Bethell's 74th on the right. The water was up to the men's waists as in the
cold of the early morning they splashed their way across the Kemmel Brook. It
was dismal and desperate work, but the spirit of the men, in spite of all that
this division had endured, was still high, and they beat down all obstacles
until they had forced their way into the village of Kemmel, where they secured
200 prisoners. Their own losses were heavy, however, including Colonel Cade of
the 1st Wilts, Colonel Stewart of the 4th South Staffords, Colonel Reade of the
10th Chesters, and several other senior officers. It was now found that the
flanks of both brigades were in the air, and as the losses were increasing
through the enfilade fire, they were ordered to withdraw. It was still early,
and the morning mist Northern screened what would otherwise have been a very
murderous operation. The final line held by the Twenty-fifth Division was about
1000 yards in advance of the starting-point.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that in this difficult and gallant night attack
against a victorious enemy the young 19-year-old recruits, who now made up a
considerable proportion of the decimated division, showed a very fine spirit
and kept up with the veterans beside them.</p>
<p>Having repulsed the counter-attack of the French and of the Twenty-fifth
Division, the enemy tried with great energy to improve his advantage, and Von
Armin thundered during the whole of April 26 against the Allied line, trying
especially to drive in the northern sector at Wytschaete and Eloi. The fighting
on this line was very desperate during the day, and in spite of every effort
the troops were pushed back from their forward positions. The strain fell
chiefly upon the remains of the 26th Brigade of the Ninth Division, the
Twenty-first Division, the 21st Brigade of the Thirtieth Division, and the
Thirty-ninth Division. The 21st Brigade defended the northern portion of the
line, and one of the outstanding feats of the day was the defence of the Old
Bluff from morning to dusk by that grand battalion, the 2nd Bedfords. Farther
south the two points called the Brasserie and the Spoil-Bank were eventually
won by the Germans, but they were defended with great determination by units of
the Thirty-ninth Division, the 1st Herts, the Cambridgeshires, and the Sussex
battalions. It was a day of struggle, and the most that the Allies could say
was that they had North prevented a break in their line. That night there was
another general withdrawal along the front which brought the Allied position
into very much the same trenches as had been occupied in the autumn of 1914.
Such a result of four years' fighting might well have caused depression, and
yet these brave hearts never for one instant relinquished their high hopes of
the victory to come.</p>
<p>The enemy had gained a spectacular advantage at Kemmel, and high hopes were
raised in Germany that some great ulterior result would come of it, but in
spite of strong efforts it was not destined that there should be any particular
consequences from their victory. Observation can be obtained from a balloon as
easily as from a hill, and the space upon the summit was so limited that the
Allied guns could make it almost untenable. Strong efforts were at once made to
push on upon the line Locre&mdash;La Clytte, which was held by the French. They
repulsed three strong attacks on April 27, and though in the evening the
Germans got into Locre, they were thrown out again by our tenacious Allies.
Again on the morning of April 29 the enemy attacked along the whole line from
Mont Vidaigne to Zillebeke Lake. This attack was repulsed with severe loss to
the enemy, and must have gone far to convince him that he was not destined to
develop his Kemmel success. The battle involved not only the front of the
Thirty-sixth French Corps, but also that of the Twenty-fifth, Forty-ninth, and
Twenty-first Divisions, all of which stood like a wall and beat off every
assault. These attacks extended from north of Kemmel to Voormezeele. The
Twenty-fifth Division was next to the French on the right of the line, in the
British centre was the Forty-ninth, while on the left the Twenty-first Division
connected up with the Ninth, which was out of the direct line of attack.</p>
<p>The 75th Brigade formed the fighting line of the Twenty-fifth Division on
this day of battle. They found themselves on the western side of the Kemmel
Brook, while the 3rd Prussian Guards lay on the farther side and advanced to
the attack. To do this they had to pass over the smooth slope which led down to
the stream, and they fell in heaps in the attempt. They huddled for shelter
behind a group of huts, but the guns got on to them and blew them to pieces.
Four distinct attacks were all equally murderous and unsuccessful. The 8th
Border Battalion was particularly conspicuous in the defence. Next to them,
near Ridge Wood, were the well-tried Yorkshiremen of the Forty-ninth. For some
reason the Germans at this point advanced in close formation with bayonets
fixed. Such tactics received the slating which they deserved. Both the West
Riding Battalions of the 147th Brigade and the York and Lancasters of the 148th
were in the firing-line, and they amply repaid themselves for many a
distressful hour. Once for three minutes the Germans made a lodgment, but at
the end of that time a rush of bayonet-men pitchforked them out of their only
gain. The Twenty-first Division held the line above Ridge Wood and on towards
Voormezeele. Upon them came the heaviest attack of all, and the slaughter
Chapter of the Germans, coming on at a range of 400 yards under machine-gun and
rifle-fire, was very murderous.</p>
<p>The Leicester Brigade did particularly well this day, and so did the worn
89th Brigade of the Thirtieth Division, which had come under the orders of
General Campbell of the Twenty-first Division. The German attack struck very
hard against the front of this unit near the Brasserie on the
Vierstraat&mdash;Ypres Road, and all three battalions, the 17th, 18th, 19th
King's Liverpools, had desperate fighting, the 17th coming in for particularly
rough treatment. It had each flank penetrated and one company surrounded, but
still managed to shake itself clear.</p>
<p>The Belgians were also involved in this widespread attack, and both their
lines in the north and those of the French round the Sharpenberg and Mont Rouge
were held intact. This severe check, inflicted upon a force which was not less
than twelve divisions, marked the beginning of the collapse of the great German
offensive in Flanders, which had now lasted for twenty days of constant
battle.</p>
<p>Early in May the Franco-British line still lay from Kemmel village in the
south to Ypres in the north, taking Voormezeele upon the way. If the Germans
could succeed in bursting through here they would partly encircle Ypres, and
would probably cause an evacuation, an event which might be of no great
military importance, but could not fail to have a moral and political
repercussion. Ypres stood like an oriflamme of war amid the ranks of the
British Army. Here it was that in October 1914 they had said to the Germans,
"Thus far and no farther!" Now in the fourth year the words still held good. If
after all the efforts, all the self-sacrifice, all the good blood so cheerfully
shed, it was now to pass from their hands, no consoling lectures upon strategy
could soften the heavy blow which it would be to those who relaxed the grip
which their comrades had held so firmly. Yet it was this and no less which was
at stake in these early days of May. A crushing German victory with the capture
of the coast was no longer to be feared. But an important local success, which
would reverberate through the world, was still well within their hopes and
their power.</p>
<p>At the moment of this important attack the southern sector of this line was
held by the One hundred and twenty-ninth and Thirty-second French Divisions,
the latter being next to the British just to the south of Vierstraat. To the
north of the French lay the 30th Composite Brigade (Currie), which had been
formed by telescoping the remains of the Thirtieth Division into a single unit.
It had two splendid though attenuated Regular battalions, the 2nd Bedfords and
2nd Yorkshires in the line with the 17th King's Liverpools in immediate
support. Still farther to the north lay Finney's well-tried Thirty-third
Division with the 98th Brigade (Maitland) in front. Their battle line consisted
of the 2nd Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders,, the 4th King's Liverpools, and
the 1st Middlesex, from south to north. Farther north still from the
Voormezeele region to the southern suburbs of ruined Ypres lay Marden's Sixth
Division which was not involved to any great degree in the fighting.</p>
<p>In the centre of the position was a well-marked line of trees forming the
edge of Ridge Wood. Behind the British line was the village of Dickebush with
the Dickebush Lake. These two points were the first objectives of the German
attack, which broke with great violence at 7:30 in the morning of May 8. It was
preceded by a lavish use of mustard gas shells, a hellish device which was used
more and more from this time forward. This poison may be kept out of lungs by a
mask, but cannot be kept from the body, where it raises such blisters and
irritation as may prove fatal in the same fashion as a bad burn. When enough
has been poured into any position it can be made untenable by troops, since in
heavy weather it hangs about for days, and has the unpleasant property of
appearing to have vanished and yet becoming active again when exposed to
moisture. Many a battalion which has crossed a dew-moistened field within the
battle area has had reason afterwards to regret it.</p>
<p>Coming after so deadly a preparation the first rush of the Germans met with
success, and they penetrated the line, both of the Thirty-second French
Division and of the 30th Composite Brigade. Their advance brought them roughly
to the south end of Dickebush Lake, whereupon the 98th Brigade threw back a
flank from Ridge Wood to the lake, so as to cover themselves from a southern
attack.</p>
<p>At seven in the evening a strong attempt was made to re-establish the line,
the 19th Brigade (Mayne) being thrown into the battle. The counter-attack was
made by the 1st Cameronians, advancing across the Hallebast-La Clytte road, but
they were in full view of the enemy whose machine-gun fire was sweeping the
very grass from the ground in front of their feet. They could not get forward,
and many of them never got back. A fine advance was made, however, by the
composite King's Liverpools with the help of some of the Bedfords. It actually
reached the old front line, but had lost so heavily that it was unable to
retain it in the face of a renewed German assault, but stuck on as near as it
could.</p>
<p>It should be explained that this King's Liverpool unit was really the old
89th Brigade which had been worn down to such an extent that the 17th, 18th,
and 19th King's were now compressed into one battalion, 750 strong. Their heavy
losses upon the Somme had been greatly increased in Flanders, and included
Colonel Watson, the gallant and veteran leader of the 17th Battalion. Now under
Colonel Rollo their sentiment was that of one of their officers who wrote, We
are still the 89th Brigade, call us what they &lt;2ike and put us in what
division they please. The old spirit remains as ever." This was the unit whose
swan song is here recorded. Next day the survivors made good their line, and
handed it over intact to their relief.</p>
<p>To the north of this composite battalion (which was independent of the 30th
Divisional Brigade already mentioned) the counter-attack was made by the 5th
Scottish Rifles near Dickebush Lake, and by the 2nd Argyll and Sutherland
Highlanders at Ridge Wood. Both of these battalions won home and gained their
full objectives. The great German local effort, urged by four strong divisions,
the Fifty-second and Fifty-sixth in front, the Twenty-ninth and Thirty-first in
support, had been held. Each of these convulsive efforts of Von Armin's tired
army brought the final equilibrium and ultimate retirement more close.</p>
<p>The fighting died down entirely in this quarter, and the Fourteenth French
Division took it over from the British. Indeed this day of strenuous battle may
be said to have marked the end of the great Battle of the Lys, which had raged
ever since April 9. The Germans had been fought to a standstill. They had in
the course of a month's fighting won ground, prisoners, and guns, but it is
possible in winning a battle to lose a war, and this is exactly what they had
accomplished. An expensive and barren success had been achieved by a lavish use
of their reserves, and on the day when those reserves were vitally needed, they
had been wastefully strewn over the plains of the Somme and of Flanders. Never
had the British Army been more severely tried than at this time when their
General issued his famous "back to the wall" appeal, and never had the
individual soldier risen to a greater height. "The British Army," says an
Italian observer who was present throughout the crisis, "impresses one with its
inherent moral soundness. The German," he adds, "uses almost exclusively
machine-guns and bombs, but the Englishman loves his rifle, and knows much
better how to use it. He is a better marksman, he is more contemptuous of
danger, and he is calmer, steadier, and feels himself individually superior to
his enemy. The cheerfulness of the men is due in great measure to the noble,
dignified, serene example of their officers, so simple in their gentlemanly
bearing, so conscious of the reasons and the end of the war, so proud of their
country and of its unshakeable prestige." It is a noble tribute, but none who
know the men could say that it was a strained one.</p>
<p>No account of the battle of the Lys can close without a word as to the
splendid work done by General Plumer, never wearied, never flurried, during
those fateful days. Hardly less arduous was the experience of General Horne in
the southern sector. The three corps commanders, too, who bore the brunt and
very especially General de Lisle, who only took over his command on the second
day of the battle, will always be associated with one of the most desperate
incidents of the war. But above and behind all is the commanding and heroic
figure of Douglas Haig, impassive, serene, still working as he had worked four
years before, at the mending of broken lines and the bracing of weak ones,
until the hour should strike for his tremendous revenge.</p>

<h2><a id="chap11" name="chap11">XI. THE BATTLES OF THE CHEMIN DES DAMES AND OF
THE ARDRES</a><br>
May 27 to June 2</h2>
<p class="chaphead">The rest cure of the Aisne&mdash;Attack upon the Fiftieth
Division&mdash;Upon the Twenty-first&mdash; Fifth Battery R.F.A.&mdash;Glorious
Devons&mdash;Adventure of General Rees&mdash;Retreat across the
Aisne&mdash;Over the Vesle&mdash;Arrival of Nineteenth Division&mdash;Desperate
fighting&mdash;Success of 4th Shropshires&mdash;General Pelle's
tribute&mdash;General prospect of the Allies midway through 1918</p>
<p class="first">IT had been determined to rest four of the crippled British
divisions which had been heavily engaged first on the Somme and then in the
battle of the Lys. These divisions were the Twenty-fifth (Bainbridge),
Twenty-first (Campbell), Eighth (Heneker), and Fiftieth (Jackson), all forming
the Ninth Corps (Hamilton-Gordon). Each of them had been cut to pieces twice in
the course of little more than a month, and should by every pre-war precept
have been incapable of exertion for a long time to come. They were
reconstituted with numbers of recruits under fresh officers, both leaders and
men with slight experience of actual warfare. They were then sent, via the
outskirts of Paris, the direct route being under fire from the German guns in
front of Amiens, and they were thrust into the French line just north of the
Aisne in the region of the Chemin des Dames. The intention was to give them
repose, but the change was looked upon with misgiving by the divisional
generals, one of whom wrote to the present chronicler at the time saying, "They
think it will be a rest cure, but to my mind it is more likely to be a fresh
centre of storm.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact the Germans, who had now made two colossal thrusts, the
one on March 21 on the Somme, the other at the Lys on April 9, were planning a
third desperate attack at this very point. The competent military historian of
the future with all the records before him will no doubt be able to pronounce
how far it was wise for the German high command to leave two unfinished tasks
in order to undertake a third one. On the face of it, it seemed an unlikely
thing to do, and that perhaps is why they did it. The line at this position had
few natural advantages and was not strongly held. In the opinion of British
generals it would have been wise if it could have been drawn south of the
Aisne, since a broad river is a good friend in one's front, but a treacherous
enemy in one's rear. There were reasons, however, why it was not easy for the
French to abandon the north bank, for they had spent much time, labour, and
human life in capturing Craonne, the California Plateau, and other positions
within that area, and it was a dreadful thing to give them up unless they were
beaten out of them. They held on, therefore&mdash;and the British divisions,
now acting as part of the French army, were compelled to hold on as well. The
Fiftieth Northern Territorial Division had a frontage of 7000 yards from near
Craonne to Ville-aux-Bois, including the famous California Plateau; on their
immediate right was the Regular Eighth Division, and to the right of that in
the Berry-au-Bac sector, where the lines cross the Aisne, was the Twenty-first
Division, this British contingent forming the Ninth Corps, and having French
troops upon either side of them. The Twenty-fifth Division was in reserve at
Fismes to the south of the river. The total attack from Crecy-au-Mont to Berry
was about thirty miles, a quarter of which&mdash;the eastern quarter&mdash;was
held by the British.</p>
<p>Confining our attention to the experience of the British troops, which is
the theme of these volumes, we shall take the northern unit and follow its
fortunes on the first day with some detail, remarking in advance that the
difficulties and the results were much the same in. the case of each of the
three front divisions, so that a fuller account of one may justify a more
condensed one of the others. The position along the whole line consisted of
rolling grass plains where the white gashes in the chalk showed out the systems
of defence. The Germans, on the other hand, were shrouded to some extent in
woodland, which aided them in the concentration of their troops. The defences
of the British were of course inherited, not made, but possessed some elements
of strength, especially in the profusion of the barbed wire. On the other hand,
there were more trenches than could possibly be occupied, which is a serious
danger when the enemy comes to close grips. The main position ran about 5000
yards north of the Aisne, and was divided into an outpost line, a main line of
battle, and a weak system of supports. The artillery was not strong, consisting
of the divisional guns with some backing of French 75's and heavies.</p>
<p>The Fiftieth Division, like the others, had all three brigades in the line.
To the north the 150th Brigade (Rees) defended Craonne and the slab-sided
California Plateau. On their right, stretching across a flat treeless plain,
lay the 151st Brigade (Martin). To the right of them again was the 149th
Brigade (Riddell), which joined on near Ville-aux-Bois to the 24th Brigade
(Grogan) of the Eighth Division. It may give some idea of the severity with
which the storm broke upon the Fiftieth Division, when it is stated that of the
three brigadiers mentioned one was killed, one was desperately wounded, and a
third was taken before ten o'clock on the first morning of the attack.</p>
<p>The German onslaught, though very cleverly carried out, was not a complete
surprise, for the experienced soldiers in the British lines, having already had
two experiences of the new methods, saw many danger signals in the week before
the battle. There was abnormal aircraft activity, abnormal efforts also to
blind our own air service, occasional registering of guns upon wire, and
suspicious movements on the roads. Finally with the capture of prisoners in a
raid the suspicions became certainties, especially when on the evening of May
26 the Germans were seen pouring down to their front lines. No help arrived,
however, for none seems to have been immediately available. The thin line faced
its doom with a courage which was already tinged with despair. Each British
brigade brought its reserve battalion to the north bank of the Aisne, and each
front division had the call upon one brigade of the Twenty-fifth Division.
Otherwise no help was in sight.</p>
<p>The bombardment began early in the morning of May 27, and was said by the
British veterans to be the heaviest of the war. Such an opinion meant
something, coming from such men. The whole area from Soissons to Rheims was
soaked with gas and shattered with high explosives, so that masks had to be
worn ten kilometres behind the lines. A German officer declared that 6000 guns
were employed. Life was absolutely impossible in large areas. The wire was
blown to shreds, and the trenches levelled. The men stuck it, however, with
great fortitude, and the counter-barrage was sufficiently good to hold up the
early attempts at an infantry advance. The experiences of the 149th Infantry
Brigade may be taken as typical. The front battalion was the 4th Northumberland
Fusiliers under Colonel Gibson. Twice the enemy was driven back in his attempt
to cross the shattered wire. At 4 A.M. he won his way into the line of
outposts, and by 4:30 was heavily pressing the battle line. His tactics were
good, his courage high, and his numbers great. The 6th Northumberland
Fusiliers, under Colonel Temperley, held the main line, and with the remains of
the 4th made a heroic resistance. At this hour the Germans had reached the main
lines both of the 151st Brigade on the left and of the 24th on the right. About
five o'clock the German tanks were reported to have got through on the front of
the Eighth Division and to be working round the rear of the 149th Brigade. Once
again we were destined to suffer from the terror which we had ourselves
evolved. The main line was now in great confusion and breaking fast. The 5th
Northumberland Fusiliers were pushed up as the last reserve. There was deep
shadow everywhere save on the California Plateau, where General Rees, with his
three Yorkshire battalions, had repulsed repeated assaults. The French line had
gone upon his left, however, and the tanks, with German infantry behind them,
had swarmed round to his rear, so that in the end he and his men were all
either casualties or captives.</p>
<p>Colonel Gibson meanwhile had held on most tenaciously with a nucleus of his
Fusiliers at a post called Centre Marceau. The telephone was still intact, and
he notified at 5:45 that he was surrounded. He beat off a succession of attacks
with heavy loss to the stormers, while Temperley was also putting up a hopeless
but desperate fight. Every man available was pushed up to their help, and they
were ordered to hold on. A senior officer reporting from Brigade Headquarters
says: "I could hear Gibson's brave, firm voice say in reply to my injunctions
to fight it out, 'Very good, sir. Good-bye!'" Shortly afterwards this gallant
man was shot through the head while cheering his men to a final effort.</p>
<p>The experience of the Durhams of the 151st had been exactly the same as that
of the Northumberlands of the 149th. Now the enemy were almost up to the last
line. The two brigadiers, Generals Martin and Riddell, together with Major
Tweedy of the reserve battalion, rushed out to organise a local defence,
drawing in a few scattered platoons for the purpose. As they did so they could
see the grey figures of the Germans all round them. It was now past six
o'clock, and a clear, sunny morning. As these officers ran forward, a shell
burst over them, and General Martin fell dead, while Riddell received a
terrible wound in the face. In spite of this, he most heroically continued to
rally the men and form a centre of resistance so as to cover Pontavert as long
as possible. The 5th Northumberland Fusiliers with a splendid counter-attack
had regained the position of Centre d'Evreux, and for the moment the pressure
was relieved. It was clear, however, both to General Jackson and to General
Heneker that both flanks were exposed, and that their general position was an
acute salient far ahead of the Allied line. The Twenty-first Division was less
affected, since it already lay astride of the river, but the French line on the
left was back before mid-day as far as Fismes, so that it was absolutely
necessary if a man were to be saved to get the remains of the two British
divisions across the Aisne at once. Pontavert, with its bridges over river and
canal, was in the hands of the Germans about 7 A.M., but the bridge-heads at
Concevreux and other places were firmly held, and as the men got across,
sometimes as small organised units, sometimes as a drove of stragglers, they
were rallied and lined up on the south bank. The field-guns had all been lost
but the heavies and machine-guns were still available to hold the new line.
Some of the 5th Northumberland Fusiliers were entirely cut off, but fought
their way through the Germans, and eventually under Major Leatheart reported
themselves at the bridges. So rapid had been the hostile advance that the
dressing-stations were captured, and many of our doctors and wounded fell into
the hands of the Germans to endure the hard fate which these savages so often
reserved for the brave but helpless men who fell into their power. It is a
terrible fact which should not be forgotten, that among these torturers the
nurses and the doctors held in many cases a prominent position. The 150th
Brigade, under General Rees, which was defending the Craonne position, had
endured an even heavier ordeal than the others. It was. on the extreme left of
the British line, on the right of the French 118th Regiment. This latter seems
to have been entirely destroyed or taken early in the attack.</p>
<p>The British brigade lay in front of Craonne upon the edge of the California
Plateau, with the 5th Yorks on the right and the 4th East Yorks on the left.
The 4th Yorks were in brigade reserve in Craonelle, immediately behind the
fighting line. The Germans got through the French on the left, also through a
gap down the Corbeny railroad on the right of the 150th and left of the 151st
Brigade. Colonel Thomson of the 5th Yorks, a very brave and experienced soldier
who was said by those who knew him best to be worth half a battalion in his own
person upon the day of battle, was in charge on the right, and hung on with
tooth and claw to every inch of ground, but his little force, already greatly
weakened by the cannonade, was unable to resist the terrible onslaught of the
German infantry. Two counter-attacks were attempted by reserve companies, but
each was swept away. The Germans were on the flank in Craonne and enfiladed the
line with a machine-gun. Colonel Thomson's last words over the telephone to
Headquarters were, "Good-bye, General, I'm afraid I shall not see you again."
He was killed shortly afterwards. Major Haslett of the East Yorks made an
equally desperate resistance on the other flank, and finally he and a wounded
sergeant-major were captured with their empty pistols in their hands. Meanwhile
the Brigade Headquarters at La Hutte were practically surrounded and under a
terrible fire. General Kees endeavoured to get into touch with his only
remaining battalion, the 4th Yorks, but they had already been overrun by the
enemy. Colonel Kent, with sixteen men, had thrown himself into a house in
Craonelle, and had fought until the whole party were killed or wounded. The
enemy was now several miles to the rear of the few survivors of the 150th
Brigade, who endeavoured to make their way back as best they might. It gives
some idea of how completely they were cut off that General Rees, after many
adventures and escapes, was finally stopped and taken by encountering the main
line of the German traffic coming down the road which he had to cross. This was
late in the day of May 27, when the enemy was well across the Aisne. It may be
of interest to add that General Rees was taken before the Kaiser next morning,
whom he found upon the California Plateau. The emperor behaved with courtesy to
his prisoner, though he could not refrain from delivering a monologue of the
usual type upon the causes of the war and the iniquity of Great Britain in
fulfilling her treaty obligations. Some account must now be given of the
experiences of Heneker's Eighth Division which occupied the centre of the
British line. This division, like the others, had been sent to the Aisne for a
rest cure after its terrific exertions upon the Somme. Full of raw soldiers and
inexperienced officers it would have seemed to be entirely unfit for battle,
but it had the two solid assets of experienced leading in the senior officers
and great regimental traditions, that ever present stand-by of the British
Army. Young as were the troops they took General Heneker's orders literally
when he issued the command that the posts were to be held at all costs, and, as
a consequence. hardly a single battalion existed as a fighting unit after the
engagement.</p>
<p>The British field-batteries were mostly to the north the river, and were
greatly damaged by the preliminary German fire. They were accurately located by
the enemy, and were smothered in poison and steel. So were the Gernicourt
defences, which formed an important tactical position with a permanent garrison
on the right of the division. All three brigades were in the line, the 25th on
the right, the 24th in the centre, and the 23rd on the left. The outpost line
was utterly overwhelmed in the first rush, the experience being much the same
as on March 21, for each small body of men found itself isolated, and could
only do its best to hold its own patch of ground. Thus at 5:15 A.M. a pigeon
message was sent, "H.Q. 2nd Berks, consisting of Colonel Griffin, Captain
Clare, and staff, are surrounded. Germans threw bombs down dug-out and passed
on. Appeared to approach from right rear in considerable strength. No idea what
has happened elsewhere. Holding on in hopes of relief." Their position was
typical of many similar groups along the front, marooned in the fog, and soon
buried in the heart of the advancing German army. The right of the 25th Brigade
had been thrust back, but on the left the 2nd Berkshires made a desperate
resistance. The whole front was intersected by a maze of abandoned trenches,
and it was along these that the enemy, shrouded in the mist, first gained their
fatal footing upon the flank. The 2nd East Lancashires were brought up in
support, and a determined resistance was made by the whole brigade within the
main zone of battle. The German tanks were up, however, and they proved as
formidable in their hands as they have often done in our own. Their
construction was cumbrous and their pace slow, but they were heavily armed and
very dangerous when once in action. Eight of them, however, were destroyed by
the French anti-tank artillery. At 6:30 the 25th Brigade, in shattered
remnants, was back on the river at Gernicourt.</p>
<p>The attack on this front was developing from the right, so that it came upon
the 24th Brigade an hour later than upon its eastern neighbour. The 2nd
Northamptons were in front, and they were driven in, but rallied on the battle
zone and made a very fine fight, until the German turning movement from the
south-east, which crossed the Miette south of the battle zone, took the line in
flank and rear. In the end hardly a man of the two battalions engaged got away,
and Haig, the brigadier, with his staff, had to cut their way out at the muzzle
of their revolvers, shooting many Germans who tried to intercept them. The 23rd
Brigade was attacked at about the same time, and the 2nd West Yorkshires
managed to hold even the outpost line for a time. Then falling back on the
battle position this battalion, with the 2nd Devons and 2nd Middlesex near the
Bois des Buttes, beat off every attack for a long time. The fatal turning
movement threatened to cut them off entirely, but about 7:30 General Grogan,
who had set his men a grand example of valour, threw out a defensive flank. He
fell back eventually across the Aisne south of Pontavert, while the enemy,
following closely upon his heels, occupied that place.</p>
<p>Many outstanding deeds of valour are recorded in all the British divisions
during this truly terrible experience, but two have been immortalised by their
inclusion in the orders of the day of General Berthelot, the French general in
command. The first concerned the magnificent conduct of the 5th Battery R.F.A.,
which, under its commander, Captain Massey, stuck to its work while piece after
piece was knocked out by an overwhelming shower of German shells. When all the
guns were gone Captain Massey, with Lieutenants Large and Bution and a handful
of survivors, fought literally to the death with Lewis guns and rifles. One man
with a rifle, who fought his way back, and three unarmed gunners who were
ordered to retire, were all who escaped to tell the heroic tale. The other
record was that of the 2nd Devons, who went on fighting when all resistance
round them was over, and were only anxious, under their gallant Colonel
Anderson-Morshead, to sell their lives at the price of covering the retreat of
their comrades. Their final stand was on a small hill which covered the river
crossing, and while they remained and died themselves they entreated their
retiring comrades to hurry through their ranks. Machine-guns ringed them round
and shot them to pieces, but they fought while a cartridge was left, and then
went down stabbing to the last. They were well avenged, however, by one post of
the Devons which was south of the river and included many Lewis guns under
Major Cope. These men killed great numbers of Germans crossing the stream, and
eventually made good their own retreat. The main body of the battalion was
destroyed, however, and the episode was heroic. In the words of the French
document: "The whole battalion, Colonel, 38 officers, and 552 in the ranks,
offered their lives in ungrudging sacrifice to the sacred cause of the Allies."
A word as to the valour of the enemy would also seem to be called for. They
came on with great fire and ardour. "The Germans seemed mad," says one
spectator, "they came rushing over the ground with leaps and bounds. The
slaughter was frightful. We could not help shooting them down."</p>
<p>Whilst this smashing attack had been delivered upon the Fiftieth and Eighth
Divisions, Campbell's Twenty-first Division on the extreme right of the British
line had also endured a hard day of battle. They covered a position from Loivre
to Berry-au-Bac, and had all three brigades in action, six battalions in the
line, and three in reserve. Their experience was much the same as that of the
other divisions, save that they were on the edge of the storm and escaped its
full fury. The greatest pressure in the morning was upon the 62nd Brigade on
the left, which was in close liaison with the 25th Brigade of the Eighth
Division. By eight o'clock the posts at Moscou and the Massif de la Marine had
been overrun by the overpowering advance of the enemy. About nine o'clock the
7th Brigade from the Twenty-fifth Division came up to the St. Auboeuf Wood
within the divisional area and supported the weakening line, which had lost
some of the outer posts and was holding on staunchly to others. The Germans
were driving down upon the west and getting behind the position of the
Twenty-first Division, for by one o'clock they had pushed the 1st Sherwood
Foresters of the Eighth Division, still fighting most manfully, out of the
Gernicourt Wood, so that the remains of this division with the 75th Brigade
were on a line west of Bouffignereux. This involved the whole left of the
Twenty-first Division, which had to swing back the 62nd Brigade from a point
south of Cormicy, keeping in touch with the 7th Brigade which formed the
connecting link. At 3:20 Cormicy had been almost surrounded and the garrison
driven out, while the 64th Brigade on the extreme right was closely pressed at
Cauroy. At six in the evening the 7th Brigade had been driven in at
Bouffignereux, and the German infantry, beneath a line of balloons and
aeroplanes, was swarming up the valley between Guyencourt and Chalons le
Vergeur, which latter village they reached about eight, thus placing themselves
on the left rear of the Twenty-first Division. Night fell upon as anxious a
situation as ever a harassed general and weary troops were called upon to face.
The Twenty-first had lost few prisoners and only six guns during the long day
of battle, but its left had been continually turned, its position was
strategically impossible, and its losses in casualties were- very heavy. It was
idle to deny that the army of General von Boehm had made a very brilliant
attack and gained a complete victory with, in the end, such solid trophies as
45,000 Allied prisoners and at least 400 guns. It was the third great blow of
the kind within nine weeks, and Foch showed himself to be a man of iron in
being able to face it, and not disclose those hidden resources which could not
yet be used to the full advantage.</p>
<p>The capture of Pontavert might have been a shattering blow to the retreating
force, but it would seem that the Germans who had pushed through so rapidly
were strong enough to hold it but not, in the first instance, strong enough to
extend their operations. By the afternoon of May 27 they were over at Maizy
also, and the force at Concevreux, which consisted of the remains of the
Fiftieth and part of the Eighth and Twenty-fifty Divisions, was in danger of
capture. At 2 P.M. the Germans had Muscourt. The mixed and disorganised British
force then fell back to near Ventclay, where they fought back once more at the
German advance, the Fiftieth Division being in the centre, with the 75th and
7th Brigades on its right. This latter brigade had been under the orders of the
Twenty-first Division and had helped to hold the extreme right of the position,
but was now involved in the general retreat. Already, however, news came from
the west that the Germans had not got merely to the Aisne but to the Vesle, and
the left flank and rear of the Ninth Corps was hopelessly compromised. Under
continuous pressure, turning ever to hold up their pursuers, the remains of the
three divisions, with hardly any artillery support, fell back to the south. On
the western wing of the battle Soissons had fallen, and Rheims was in a most
perilous position, though by some miracle she succeeded in preserving her
shattered streets and desecrated cathedral from the presence of the
invaders.</p>
<p>The Eighth Division had withdrawn during the night to Montigny, and, in
consequence, the Twenty-first Division took the general line, Hermonville
&mdash; Montigny Ridge, the 64th Brigade on the right, with the 62nd and 7th in
succession on the left. Every position was outflanked, however, touch was lost
with the Eighth on the left, and the attack increased continually in its fury.
Pronilly fell, and the orders arrived that the next line would be the River
Vesle, Jonchery marking the left of the Eighth Division. On the right the
Twenty-first continued to be in close touch with the French Forty-fifth
Division. All units were by this time very intermingled, tired, and
disorganised. The 15th Durhams, who had fought a desperate rearguard action all
morning upon the ridge north of Hervelon Ch&acirc;teau, had almost ceased to
exist. The one gleam of light was the rumoured approach of the One hundred and
thirty-fourth French Division from the south. It had been hoped to hold the
line of the River Vesle, but by the evening of May 28 it was known that the
Germans had forced a passage at Jonchery, where the bridge would have been
destroyed but for the wounding of the sapper officer and the explosion of the
wagon containing the charges. On the other hand, the Forty-fifth French
Division on the right was fighting splendidly, and completely repulsed a heavy
German attack. When night fell the British were still for the most part along
the line of the Vesle, but it was clear that it was already turned upon the
west. Some idea of the truly frightful losses incurred by the troops in these
operations may be formed from the fact that the Eighth Division alone had lost
7000 men out of a total force of about 9000 infantry. About eight in the
morning of May 29 the enemy renewed his attack, pushing in here and there along
the line in search of a gap. One attempt was made upon the Twenty-first
Division, from Branscourt to Sapicourt, which was met and defeated by the 1st
Lincolns and 6th Leicesters. Great activity and movement could be seen among
the German troops north of the river, but the country is wooded and hilly, so
that observation is difficult. Towards evening, the right flank of the fighting
line was greatly comforted by the arrival of the French Division already
mentioned, and the hearts of the British were warmed by the news that one of
their own divisions had come within the zone of battle, as will now be
described.</p>
<p>When the Ninth Corps was sent to the Aisne, another very weary British
division, the Nineteenth and of the (Jeffreys), had also been told off for the
French front with the same object of rest, and the same actual result of
desperate service. So strenuous had the work of this division been upon the
Somme and in Flanders, that the ranks were almost entirely composed of new
drafts from England and Wales. Their destination was the Chalons front, where
they remained for exactly twelve days before the urgent summons arrived from
the breaking line on the Aisne, and they were hurried westwards to endeavour to
retrieve or at least to minimise the disaster. They arrived on the morning of
May 29, and found things in a most critical condition. The Germans had pushed
far south of the Aisne, despite the continued resistance of the survivors of
the Eighth, Twenty-fifth, and Fiftieth British Divisions, and of several French
divisions, these debris of units being mixed up and confused, with a good deal
of mutual recrimination, as is natural enough when men in overwrought
conditions meet with misfortunes, the origin of which they cannot understand.
When troops are actually mixed in this fashion, the difference in language
becomes a very serious matter. Already the Allied line had been pushed far
south of Fismes, and the position of the units engaged was very obscure to the
Higher Command, but the British line, such as it was, was north of Savigny on
the evening of May 28. Soissons had fallen, Rheims was in danger, and it was
doubtful whether even the line of the Marne could be held. Amid much chaos it
must, indeed, have been with a sense of relief that the Allied generals found a
disciplined and complete division come into the front, however young the
material of which it was composed.</p>
<p>A gap had opened in the line between the Thirteenth French Division at Lhery
and the One hundred and fifty-fourth near Faverolles, and into this the 57th
and 58th Brigades were thrust. The artillery had not yet come up, and the rest
of the Allied artillery was already either lost or destroyed, so there was
little support from the guns. It was a tough ordeal for boys fresh from the
English and Welsh training camps. On the left were the 10th Worcesters and 8th
Gloucesters. On the right the 9th Welsh Fusiliers and 9th Welsh. It was hoped
to occupy Savigny and Brouillet, but both villages were found to be swarming
with the enemy. Remains of the Eighth and Twenty-fifth Divisions were still,
after three days of battle, with their faces to the foe on the right of the
Nineteenth Division. They were very weary, however, and the 2nd Wiltshires were
brought up to thicken the line and cover the divisional flank north of
Bouleuse. This was the situation at 2 P.M. of May 29.</p>
<p>The tide of battle was still rolling to the south, and first Savigny and
then Faverolles were announced as being in German hands. A mixed force of odd
units had been formed and placed under General Craigie-Hackett, but this now
came back through the ranks of the Nineteenth Division. On the right also the
hard-pressed and exhausted troops in front, both French and British, passed
through the 2nd Wiltshires, and endeavoured to reform behind them. The
Nineteenth Division from flank to flank became the fighting front, and the
Germans were seen pouring down in extended order from the high ground north of
Lhery and of Treslon. On the right the remains of the of the Eighth Division
had rallied, and it was now reinforced by the 2nd Wilts, the 4th Shropshire
Light Infantry, and the 8th Staffords, the latter battalions from the 56th
Brigade. With this welcome addition General Heneker, who had fought such a long
uphill fight, was able in the evening of May 29 to form a stable line on the
Bouleuse Ridge. By this time the guns of the Nineteenth Division, the 87th and
88th Brigades Royal Field Artillery, had roared into action&mdash;a welcome
sound to the hard-pressed infantry in front. There was a solid British line now
from Lhery on the left to the eastern end of the Bouleuse Ridge, save that one
battalion of Senegal Tirailleurs was sandwiched in near Faverolles. Liaison had
been established with the Thirteenth and One hundred and fifty-fourth French
Divisions to left and right.</p>

<p class="caption">The general positions of the British Divisions during the
battles of the Chemin des Dames and the Ardre, May 27-June 3.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>The early morning of May 30 witnessed a very violent attack along all this
portion of the line. By 6 A.M. the enemy had worked round the left flank of.
the 10th Worcesters at Lhery, driving before them some of the troops, French
and British, who were exhausted from the long battle. It is difficult for
either writer or reader to imagine the condition of men who have fought a
losing battle for three days without cessation. If Foch saved up his reserves
during these weeks of agony, it was surely at a precious cost to the men who
bore the weight. The left company of the 10th Worcesters lost all its officers
and 60 per cent of its men, and Lhery had to be left to the enemy. Meanwhile,
the Senegalese, who, like all tropical troops, are more formidable in attack
than in defence, were driven in near Faverolles, the Germans making a frontal
attack in eight lines. They pushed through the gap, outflanked the 9th Welsh
Fusiliers on the left and the 2nd Wiltshires on the right, cutting off a
platoon of the former battalion. Both these battalions suffered very heavily,
the Welsh Fusiliers especially being cut to pieces. At both ends of the line
the remains of the front battalions had to fall back upon their supports. The
74th Composite Brigade, already referred to as being under General
Craigie-Hackett, fought on the left of the Nineteenth Division, and was ordered
to hold the Lhery-Rohigny road. The pressure, however, upon these tired troops
and upon the remains of the 10th Worcesters continued to be very great, and by
11 A.M. the situation was critical on the left of the line, the flank having
been driven in, and the 8th Gloucesters enfiladed so that the D'Aulnay Wood
could no longer be held. These changes enabled the Germans to close in upon the
9th Welsh and the remains of the 9th Welsh Fusiliers, attacking them in front
and flank. The troops on their right gave way, and the assailants were then
able to get round the other flank of these two devoted battalions, and
practically to surround them, so that very few won their way back. The whole
front line had gone with the exception of the 10th Warwicks on the left. For a
time it seemed as if there was nothing to limit this powerful thrust of the
enemy, but in the usual miraculous fashion a composite party of odds and ends,
drawn from stragglers and details, hastily swept together by General Jeffreys,
were hurried up to the high ground south of Ville-en-Tardenois. With the aid of
four machine-guns from the Nineteenth Division this force held the victorious
enemy from coming further, covered the left flank of the 10th Warwicks, and
formed a bastion from which a new wall could be built. A second bastion had
been made by the 5th South Wales Borderers, pioneers of the Nineteenth
Division, who had dug in south of Rohigny and absolutely refused to shift. Up
to 2 P.M. the 2nd Wilts also held their ground north of Bouleuse. Between these
fixed points the 57th and 58th Brigades were able to reorganise, the 15th
Warwicks and 9th Cheshires covering the respective fronts. On the right the
Twenty-eighth French Division had relieved the One hundred and fifty-fourth,
while the 4th Shropshires and 8th North Staffords, both still intact, formed a
link between the two Allies. Touch had been lost on the left, and patrols were
sent out to endeavour to bridge the gap. At this period General Jeffreys of the
Nineteenth Division commanded the whole British line. A serious loss had been
caused by the wounding of General Glasgow, the experienced leader of the 58th
Brigade. General Heath of the 56th Brigade took over the command of both
units.</p>
<p>The Germans had reached their limit for the day, though some attempt at an
attack was made in the afternoon from the wood of Aulnay, which was beaten back
by the British fire. It was rumoured, however, that on the left, outside the
British area, he was making progress south of Rohigny, which made General
Jeffreys uneasy for his left wing. Up to now the British had been under the
general command of the Ninth British Corps, but this was now withdrawn from the
line, and the Nineteenth Division passed to the Fifth French Corps under
General Pelle, an officer who left a most pleasant impression upon the minds of
all who had to deal with him. On May 31 the front consisted of the French
Fortieth on the left, the French Twenty-eighth on the right, and the British
Nineteenth between them, the latter covering 12,000 yards. The weary men of the
original divisions were drawn out into reserve after as severe an ordeal as any
have endured during the whole war. The 74th Composite Brigade was also
relieved. Some idea of the losses on the day before may be gathered from the
fact that the two Welsh battalions were now formed into a single composite
company, which was added to the 9th Cheshires.</p>
<p>The morning of the 31st was occupied in a severe duel of artillery, in which
serious losses were sustained from the German fire, but upon the other hand a
threatened attack to the south-west of Ville-en-Tardenois was dispersed by the
British guns. About two o'clock the enemy closed once more upon the left,
striking hard at the 6th Cheshires, who had been left behind in this quarter
when the rest of the 74th Composite Brigade had been relieved. The 10th
Warwicks were also attacked, and the whole wing was pushed back, the enemy
entering the village of Ville-en-Tardenois. The Warwicks formed up again on
high ground south-east of the village, the line being continued by the remains
of the 10th Worcesters and 8th Gloucesters. Whilst the left wing was driven in,
the right was also fiercely attacked, the enemy swarming down in great numbers
upon the French, and the 9th Cheshires. The former were driven off the Aubilly
Ridge, and the latter had to give ground before the rush.</p>
<p>General Jeffreys, who was on the spot, ordered an immediate counter-attack
of the 2nd Wilts to retrieve the situation. Before it could develop, however,
the French were again advancing on the right, together with the 4th
Shropshires. A local counter-attack had also been delivered by the 9th
Cheshires, led on horseback with extreme gallantry by Colonel Cunninghame. His
horse was shot under him, but he continued to lead the troops on foot, and his
Cheshire infantry followed him with grim determination into their old
positions. The ground was regained though the losses were heavy, Colonel
Cunninghame being among the wounded.</p>
<p>The attack of the 2nd Wiltshires had meanwhile been developed, and was
launched under heavy fire about seven in the evening, moving up to the north of
Chambrecy. The position was gained, the Wiltshires connecting up with the
Cheshires on their right and the Gloucesters on their left. Meanwhile, advances
of the enemy on the flank were broken up by artillery fire, the 87th and 88th
Brigades of guns doing splendid work, and sweeping the heads of every advance
from the Tardenois-Chambrecy road. So ended another very severe day of battle.
The buffer was acting and the advance was slowing. Already its limit seemed to
be marked.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 31 the British position extended from a line on the
left connecting Ville-en-Tardenois and Champlat. Thence the 57th Brigade
covered the ground up to the stream which runs from Sarcy to Chambrecy. Then
the 56th Brigade began, and carried on to 1000 yards east of the river Ardres.
The line of battalions (pitiful remnants for the most part) was from the left,
10th Warwicks, 10th Worcesters, 8th Gloucesters, 2nd Wilts, 9th Cheshires, 8th
Staffords, and 4th Shropshires. Neither brigade could muster 1000 rifles, while
the 58th Brigade in reserve was reduced to three sapper field companies, the
personnel of the trench-mortar batteries, and every straggler who could be
scraped up was thrust forward to thicken the line.</p>
<p>The German attack was launched once more at 4 P.M. on June 1, striking up
against the Fortieth French Division and the left of the British line. Under
the weight of the assault the French were pushed back, and the enemy penetrated
the Bonval Wood, crossed the Tardenois-Jonchery road, and thrust their way into
the woods of Courmont and La Cohette. Here, however, the attack was held, and
the junction between the French and the Warwicks remained firm. The front of
the 57th Brigade was attacked at the same time, the 8th Gloucesters and the 2nd
Wilts on their right being very hard pressed. The enemy had got Sarcy village,
which enabled them to get on the flank of the Gloucesters, and to penetrate
between them and the Wiltshires. It was a very critical situation. The right
company of the Gloucesters was enfiladed and rolled up, while the centre was in
deadly danger. The left flank and the Worcesters held tight, but the rest of
the line was being driven down the hill towards Chambrecy. A splendid rally was
effected, however, by Captain Pope of B Company, who led his west countrymen up
the hill once more, driving the enemy back to his original line. For this feat
he received the D.S.O. At this most critical period of the action, great help
was given to the British by the 2nd Battalion of the 22nd French Regiment, led
in person by Commandant de Lasbourde, which joined in Pope's counter-attack,
afterwards relieving the remains of the Gloucesters. Lasbourde also received
the D.S.O.</p>
<p>The success of the attack was due partly to the steadiness of the of the
10th Worcesters on the left, who faced right and poured a cross-fire into the
German stormers. It was a complete, dramatic little victory, by which the high
ground north of Chambrecy was completely regained. A withdrawal of the whole
line was, however, necessary on account of the German penetration into the
left, which had brought them complete possession of the Wood of Courmont on the
British left rear. The movement was commenced at seven in the evening, and was
completed in most excellent order before midnight. This new line, stretching
from Quisles to Eligny, included one very important position, the hill of
Eligny, which was a prominence from which the enemy could gain observation and
command over the whole valley of the Ardres, making all communications and
battery positions precarious. The general order of units in the line on June 2
was much the same as before, the 5th South Wales Borderers being held in
reserve on the left, and the 2/22nd French on the right of the Nineteenth
Division. These positions were held unbroken from this date for a fortnight,
when the division was eventually relieved after its most glorious term of
service. The British Ninth Corps was busily engaged during this time in
reorganising into composite battalions the worn and mixed fragments of the
Eighth, Twenty-fifth, and Fiftieth Divisions, which were dribbled up as
occasion served to the new battle-line. A composite machine-gun company was
also organised and sent up.</p>
<p>Several days of comparative quiet followed, during which the sappers were
strengthening the new positions, and the Germans were gathering fresh forces
for a renewed attack. Congratulatory messages from General Franchet d'Esperey,
the French Army Commander, and from their own Corps General put fresh heart
into the overtaxed men. There was no fresh attack until June 6. On that date
the line of defence from the left consisted of the Fortieth French Division,
the Eighth Division Composite Battalion (could a phrase mean more than that?),
the 10th Warwicks, 10th Worcesters, 8th Gloucesters, 58th Brigade Composite
Battalion, 9th Cheshires, 8th North Staffords, 4th Shropshires, and
Twenty-eighth French Division. At 3 A.M. there began a tremendous bombardment,
mostly of gas-shell, which gave way to the infantry advance at 4 A.M., the
attack striking the right and centre of the British line, in the section of the
all-important Bligny Hill. As the enemy advanced upon the front of the 58th
Composite Battalion, the men who were the survivors of the 2nd Wilts, 9th Welsh
Fusiliers, and 9th Welsh, fired a volley, and then, in a fashion which would
have delighted the old Duke, sprang from their cover and charged with the
bayonet, hurling the Germans down the slope. It was a complete repulse, as was
a second attack upon the front of the Gloucesters and Worcesters who, with a
similar suggestion of the legendary Peninsula tactics, waited till they could
see their foemen's eyes before firing, with the result that the storming column
simply vanished, flinging itself down in the long grass and hiding there till
nightfall. There was no attack on the left of the line, but the 9th Cheshires
and the North Staffords both had their share in the victory. The Twenty-eighth
French Division on the right had given a little before the storm, and the
British line was bent back to keep touch. Otherwise it was absolutely intact,
and the whole terrain in front of it was covered with German dead.</p>
<p>The German is a determined fighter, however, and his generals well knew that
without the command of Bligny Hill no further progress was possible for him in
the general advance. Therefore they drew together all their strength and
renewed the attack at 11 A.M. with such energy and determination that they
gained the summit. An immediate counter by the 9th Cheshires, though most
gallantly urged, was unable to restore the situation, but fortunately a
battalion was at hand which had not lost so grievously in the previous
fighting. This was the 4th Shropshires, which now charged up the hill,
accompanied by the remains of the undefeated 9th Cheshires. The attack was
delivered with magnificent dash and spirit, and it ended by the complete
reconquest of the hill. For this feat the 4th Shropshires received as a
battalion the rare and coveted distinction of the Croix de Guerre with the
palm. This local success strengthened the hands of the French on the right, who
were able in the late afternoon to come forward and to retake the village of
Bligny. June 6 was a most successful day, and gave fresh assurance that the
German advance was spent.</p>
<p>There was no further close fighting in this neighbourhood up to June 19,
when the young soldiers of the Nineteenth and other divisions were withdrawn
after a sustained effort which no veterans could have beaten. In the official
report of General Pelle to his own Higher Command, there occurs the generous
sentence: <i>"L'impression produite sur le moral des troupes fran&ccedil;aises
par la belle attitude de leurs alli&eacute;s a &eacute;t&eacute; tr&egrave;s
bonne."</i> Both Allies experienced the difficulty of harmonising troops who
act under different traditions and by different methods. At first these
hindrances were very great, but with fuller knowledge they tended to disappear,
and ended in complete mutual confidence, founded upon a long experience of
loyalty and devotion to the common end.</p>
<p>From this date until the end of June no event of importance affecting the
British forces occurred upon the Western front. The German attack extended
gradually in the Aisne district, until it had reached Montdidier, and it
penetrated upon the front as far south as the forest of Villers-Cotteret, where
it threatened the town of Compi&egrave;gne. In the middle of June the German
front was within forty miles of Paris, and a great gun specially constructed
for the diabolical work was tossing huge shells at regular intervals into the
crowded city. The bursting of one of these projectiles amidst the congregation
of a church on a Sunday, with an appalling result in killed and wounded, was
one of those incidents which Germans of the future will, we hope, regard with
the same horror as the rest of the world did at the time.</p>
<p>The cause of the Allies seemed at this hour to be at the very lowest. They
had received severe if glorious defeats on the Somme, in Flanders, and on the
Aisne. Their only success lay in putting limits to German victories. And yet
with that deep prophetic instinct which is latent in the human mind, there was
never a moment when they felt more assured of the ultimate victory, nor when
the language of their leaders was prouder and more firm. This general
confidence was all the stranger, since we can see as we look back that the
situation was on the face of it most desperate, and that those factors which
were to alter it&mdash;the genius of Foch, the strength of his and of the
reserves, and the numbers and power of the American Army&mdash;were largely
concealed from the public. In the midst of the gloom the one bright light shone
from Italy, where, on June 17, a strong attack of the Austrians across the
Piave was first held and then thrown back to the other bank. In this most
timely victory Lord Cavan's force, which now consisted of three British
Divisions, the Seventh, Twenty-third, and Forty-eighth, played a glorious part.
So, at the close of the half year Fate's curtain rang down, to rise again upon
the most dramatic change in history.</p>
