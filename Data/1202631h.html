  <h2><a id="intro" name="intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>

  <p>THE primary importance of the trial of Oscar Slater for the murder of
Miss Marion Gilchrist, and that which well warrants its preservation in such
permanent form as the present series affords, is the fact that a conviction was
obtained by the Crown upon evidence as to identity based on personal
impressions, the corroboration supplied by the circumstantial evidence, though
containing elements of strong suspicion, adding nothing conclusive of the
prisoner's guilt.</p>

  <p>The direct evidence to identification was twofold: firstly, by three
witnesses who admittedly saw the supposed murderer leaving the scene of the
crime; and secondly, by twelve other witnesses who identified Slater as a man
they had seen watching Miss Gilchrist's house for weeks before the murder. Had
the identification by the former been clear and unhesitating, the case for the
prosecution would have been proved beyond dispute; but as regards the evidence
of at least two of them, such was not the fact. The evidence given by those who
saw the watcher is also unconvincing in respect of manifest discrepancies as to
his dress and personal appearance; while the impossibility of reconciling the
conflicting testimony of the various witnesses increases the difficulties which
beset the case. That these difficulties were appreciated by the fifteen jurymen
is shown by the narrow majority of three votes upon which the verdict turned;
and the weight attached to them by the Scottish Secretary and his advisers is
apparent in the commutation of the sentence.</p>

  <p>The case excited widespread interest at the time, and, by reason of the
sensational reports of which it was the occasion, exercised the popular
imagination for many months. These rumours, alike hurtful to the memory of the
aged victim and prejudicial to the accused, were, happily, dissipated by the
evidence adduced at the trial. But apart from these, the case itself contains
elements sufficiently strange and suggestive to supply, in an unwonted degree,
a legitimate and lasting interest.</p>

  <p>A crime of exceptional atrocity, committed in a well-to-do quarter of a
great city, not in the dead of night, but at an hour when the streets were yet
busy and many people were out of doors; the age and circumstances of the
hapless lady; the incredible ruthlessness of the attack; the rapidity with
which her murderer effected his fatal purpose; the fact that a witness was
literally on the threshold of the tragedy, and heard the deed done; the
audacity of the criminal in making good his escape from the very presence of
two persons who had frustrated the main object of his design: these are indeed
matters of more than common note. The ability with which, in spite of serious
obstacles, the Glasgow police ran their man to earth&mdash;or rather, to
sea&mdash;within a week; the extradition proceedings in New York; the trial at
Edinburgh, with the curious glimpses it gave of that dark under-world which
lies beneath the surface of our modern civilisation; the obvious weakness of
certain links in the formidable chain forged by the Crown; the surprising
verdict; and, finally, the illogical and unsatisfactory reprieve, combine to
merit for this case a conspicuous niche in the gallery of Scottish <i>causes
cel&egrave;bres</i>.</p>

  <p>In the month of December, 1908, there lived at No. 15 Queen's Terrace,
West Princes Street, Glasgow, an unmarried lady named Marion Gilchrist, eighty-
two years of age, who had been tenant of the house for upwards of thirty years.
Though of independent means and in comfortable circumstances, she kept but one
servant; and at the date in question a girl, named Helen Lambie, aged twenty-
one, had been in her service for the past three years. The old lady led a very
retired life, seeing little of her relatives and less of her neighbours;
receiving few visitors other than Mrs. Ferguson, a former servant, with whom
she was on intimate terms.</p>

  <p><a id="pic2" name="pic2"></a></p><br>

  <div align="center"><img src="1202631h-images/OscarSlater02.jpg" title="Miss Marion
Gilchrist. From the Photograph produced in Court"></div><br>

  <p>The house, which is situated in a quiet residential locality in the West
End of the city, consists of three public rooms, two bedrooms, bathroom, and
kitchen, and forms the first flat of a tenement three storeys in height. The
top flat, the only other house upon the same stair, had been unoccupied since
the previous Whitsunday; the lower flat, which is entirely separate from those
above, having a private entrance, No. 14 Queen's Terrace, opens directly from
the street and is what is called in Scotland a maindoor house. Immediately to
the left of No. 14 another door, No. 15, gives access to a short passage,
locally termed a "close," extending from the street door to the foot of the
common stair, which ascends in three short flights to the door of Miss
Gilchrist's house and continues to that of the empty house above. The old lady
and her servant were thus the only persons living in No. 15. The maindoor house
occupies the whole ground floor with the exception of this close, and the
dining-room is situated immediately beneath that of Miss Gilchrist. The
maindoor and the close door, which are on the same level, are approached from
the pavement by four steps and a landing, common to both. Queen's Terrace is
the name of a section of West Princes Street, and forms the south side of the
east end of that street.</p>

  <p>Miss Gilchrist differed from the generality of old ladies of similar
habits and condition in one remarkable particular. She had a passion for
precious stones, and the collection of jewels which she purchased from time to
time, chiefly from a well-known Glasgow firm with whom she had dealt for twenty
years, cost her over &pound;3000. As a rule these jewels were kept among her
clothes in her wardrobe; but when, as was her custom, she went to the country
for a month in summer, they were sent to the jewellers for safe custody until
her return. In these circumstances it is not surprising to find that Miss
Gilchrist was extremely nervous about burglars, and lived in constant dread of
her house being broken into. She was most solicitous as to the fastening of her
windows; and the house door, in addition to such securities as the usual lock
and chain, had, as further defences, a heavy bolt and two separate patent
locks, opened from within by two handles, and from without by two different
keys. The street door at the closemouth had only an ordinary latch-key, and was
opened from the house by lifting a handle within the hall.</p>

  <p>The house below was occupied by a family of the name of Adams. They had
merely a slight acquaintance with Miss Gilchrist, and, though they had been
neighbours for many years, were not upon visiting terms. She had, however, an
understanding with them that if at any time she was alone and required
assistance, she should knock upon the floor of her room, and, on hearing this
signal, some of them would go up.</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock on the evening of Monday, 21st December, the servant
Lambie, having finished her housework, went out, as appears to have been her
nightly practice, to fetch an evening paper for her mistress, before proceeding
to neighbouring shops upon such messages as were required. She left Miss
Gilchrist sitting on an ordinary chair at the table in the dining-room, with
her back to the fire, reading a magazine, with her spectacles on. She received
from her mistress a penny for the paper and a half-sovereign for the messages;
the latter she laid on the table, intending to take it when she came back. The
dining-room was lit with an incandescent light, the gas in the kitchen was
turned down, and that in the hall&mdash;a pendant, with a single jet&mdash;was
half on. The bracket on the landing outside the house door was also lighted.
All the windows were fastened except the kitchen window, which was open two or
three inches at the top. The girl shut both the house and close doors, taking
with her the two keys required to open the former and the latch-key of the
latter. It was raining when she left the house. The newspaper shop was situated
in St. George's Road at the east end of West Princes Street, and her errand
usually occupied less than ten minutes. On this occasion she spoke for a minute
or two to a constable of her acquaintance, in plain clothes, whom she met at
the corner of St. George's Road, before buying the paper.</p>

  <p>At seven o'clock Mr. Arthur Adams and his two sisters were in their
dining-room, when they heard "a noise from above, and then a very heavy fall,
and then three sharp knocks." Miss Laura Adams at once said to her brother that
something must have happened to Miss Gilchrist, and that gentleman instantly
left his house to see what was wrong. He found the close door ajar and, running
upstairs, observed through the glass panels at the sides of the house door,
which was shut, that the lobby was lighted. He rang the bell loudly three
times. Listening at the door, he heard a noise which he thought was caused by
the servant breaking sticks in the kitchen: "It seemed as if it was some one
chopping sticks&mdash;not heavy blows." After waiting a minute or two, during
which the sounds continued, and being unaware of the servant's absence, Mr.
Adams returned to his own house. Miss Adams, meanwhile, had heard further
noises from above, but not so distinct as the knocks. She was not satisfied
with her brother's account of what was taking place and asked him to go up
again. He immediately did so, but by this time the sounds had ceased. He again
rang the bell loudly, and had his hand upon the handle when he heard footsteps
in the close below, and was joined by Lambie, who was then returning with the
newspaper.</p>

  <p>The night, as has been said, was wet, and the girl noticed wet footmarks
on the lower steps of the inside stair. Whether these were Mr. Adams' does not
appear&mdash;he was not asked if he had seen them when he first went up. As he
had merely to step from the one door to the other, it is unlikely that his feet
were wet. Mr. Adams told her that there was a noise in the house, " and that
the ceiling was like to crack." She suggested that it was caused by the pulleys
in the kitchen (an appliance for drying clothes), which she thought might have
fallen down. This explanation did not commend itself to Mr. Adams, who, now
knowing that the old lady had been left alone in the house, said there must be
something seriously wrong and he would wait to see. Lambie thereupon opened the
door with her two keys.</p>

  <p>According to the evidence of Mr. Adams, Lambie then entered the house,
and made for the kitchen door, in the further left-hand corner of the hall, he
himself remaining on the threshold. When she had got past the grandfather's
clock upon the left&mdash; Lambie states that she was on the door mat beside
him all the time&mdash;a man appeared from the door of the bedroom, in the
right-hand corner at the back of the hall. Keeping along the wall on his left,
he passed the hatstand, and quietly approached the front door. There was
nothing in his appearance or manner to excite suspicion, and, as he came up "
quite pleasantly," Mr. Adams' first impression was that he was a visitor, and
was going to speak to him. Having reached the door, however, the man bolted
past Mr. Adams and rushed down the stairs "like greased lightning," slamming
the close door behind him.</p>

  <p>Lambie then entered the kitchen, and next the spare bedroom, the gas in
which she found had been lit in her absence, and on Mr. Adams calling to her,
"Where is your mistress?" she finally went into the dining-room. Hearing her
scream, he quickly joined her. The room at first sight presented its usual
appearance, but, lying on her back upon the hearth rug in front of the
fireplace, they saw the body of Miss Gilchrist, with a skin rug thrown across
the head. A glance showed them what had happened, and they both ran downstairs,
Lambie to inform the Adams ladies, who had come out on hearing the rush of feet
on the stairs, and Mr. Adams to see if he could overtake the murderer. By the
time he reached the street the man had vanished.</p>

  <p>Near St. George's Road Mr. Adams met Constable Neil, with whom he
returned to the house. They lifted the rug, and found that the old lady had
been attacked with horrible ferocity, her head and face being brutally smashed.
She was still breathing, and made a movement with her left hand. Mr. Adams then
ran across the street for his own medical man, Dr. John Adams, No. 1 Queen's
Crescent, and, meeting Constable Brien, informed him of what had occurred. The
latter went up to the house, and then proceeded to call the ambulance. Dr.
Adams came forthwith, reaching the house at twenty or twenty-five minutes past
seven. Ascertaining from an examination of the body that life was extinct, he
informed the constables that the ambulance was unnecessary, left the case in
their charge, and at once reported the matter by telephone to the Western
Police Office. In response to his message Superintendent Douglas, Detective
Inspector Pyper, and Detective Officer M'Vicar promptly arrived upon the scene
of the crime, and the body was examined by Dr. Wright, casualty surgeon for the
Western District. He found that "nearly every bone in the skull was fractured;
the brains were escaping; the head was practically smashed to pulp." The grate,
fender, and fire-irons were splashed with blood, but the latter were in their
usual places; the coal scuttle was also bloodstained, and the lid was broken.
There was no blood except in the immediate vicinity of the head, and the
furniture of the room appeared to be undisturbed. Near the head stood the chair
upon which the old lady had been sitting; upon the hearth rug beside the body
lay the half-sovereign; the open magazine and folded spectacles were upon the
table, as she had left them when she rose to meet her sudden doom.</p>

  <p>A search of the premises disclosed that a small wooden box, in which the
deceased kept her papers in the bedroom, had been wrenched open and its
contents scattered upon the floor. In a glass dish on the toilet table were a
diamond and two other rings; a gold bracelet and a gold watch and chain lay on
the same table; but there was missing from the dish a valuable diamond crescent
brooch, which the girl Lambie had seen there the day before. A box of matches,
different from those used in the house, and one spent match, with which the
murderer had lit the bedroom gas, were the only clues he had left behind. The
windows were in exactly the same state as when Lambie went out. No weapon of
any kind was found in the house; and Constable Walker, who was put on to watch
the premises during the night, searched the back court with his lantern, but
discovered nothing. Next day, however, Inspector Rankin found in the court
behind the house an auger, having some grey hair adhering to it, which was at
first associated by the authorities with the case, but, as will appear later,
had no connection with the crime.</p>

  <p>The unusual circumstance that two persons had actually seen the supposed
murderer leaving the house should have greatly assisted the police in
investigating this mysterious affair, but, unfortunately, the description of
him which Mr. Adams and Lambie were able to give was of the vaguest&mdash;</p>

  <p>A man between twenty-five and thirty years of age, 5 feet 8 or 9 inches
in height, slim build, dark hair, clean shaven; dressed in light grey overcoat,
and dark cloth cap. Cannot be further described.</p>

  <p>These particulars were published in the next day's papers; an inventory
was taken of the jewels found in the house; and a description of the missing
brooch was circulated amongst pawnbrokers, jewellers, and dealers.</p>

  <p>The news of the tragedy produced a profound sensation, not only in
Glasgow but throughout the country; crowds daily visited West Princes Street to
gaze at the ill-fated house; the mysterious and terrible character of the crime
formed the sole topic of conversation; while Press and public vied with one
another in supplying the authorities with "clues" for the elucidation of the
mystery.</p>

  <p>On Tuesday, 22nd December, on the instructions of Mr. Hart, Procurator-
fiscal for Lanarkshire, Professor Glaister and Dr. Galt visited and inspected
the locus. On the following day these gentlemen made a post-mortem examination
of the body and the results of their investigations were embodied in reports,
which will be found printed in the report of the trial.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday, the 23rd, the police were informed of a fresh circumstance
of the highest importance. That afternoon Mrs. Barrowman, 9 Seamore Street, met
Detective M'Gimpsey, who lived in the same stair, and made a statement to him,
as the result of which the evidence of her adopted daughter Mary was taken that
night. This little girl of fifteen was in the employment of a bootmaker in
Great Western Road. At seven o'clock on the night of the tragedy she was sent
to deliver a parcel in Cleveland Street. While passing along West Princes
Street, near Miss Gilchrist's house, she saw a man running down the steps from
the close of No. 15 Queen's Terrace. He hesitated for a moment on reaching the
pavement, looked east to St. George's Road, and then turned west and ran
towards her. She watched him approaching, and he knocked up against her as he
passed her. She was standing by a lamp-post at the time and saw him clearly.
[The lights in West Princes Street are incandescent.] She followed him for a
short distance, but as he turned down West Cumberland Street she stopped and
resumed her way. Having gone her errand, she went to a Band of Hope meeting,
where, she said, she heard of the murder, and going back to West Princes Street
found a crowd assembled in front of the house from the door of which she had
seen the man emerge. On her return home that night she told her story to her
mother.</p>

  <p>Following upon this discovery a more particular description appeared on
Friday, the 25th, in the two o'clock editions of the Glasgow evening
newspapers&mdash;</p>

  <p>The man wanted is about twenty-eight or thirty years of age, tall and
thin, with his face shaved clear of all hair, while a distinctive feature is
that his nose is slightly turned to one side. The witness thinks the twist is
to the right side. He wore one of the popular round tweed hats known as Donegal
hats, and a fawn-coloured overcoat, which might have been a waterproof, also
dark trousers, and brown boots.</p>

  <p>The discrepancies between the two descriptions as to colour of coat and
kind of headgear should be noted.</p>

  <p>At ten minutes past six o'clock that same evening Allan M'Lean, cycle
dealer, Glasgow, called at the Central Police Office and informed
Superintendent Ord that a man named Oscar Slater, whom he knew at the Sloper
Club, 24 India Street, had been trying to dispose in that club of a pawn-
ticket for a diamond brooch resembling the missing one, and that he answered to
the published description of the wanted man. Accompanied by Detective Powell,
M'Lean went to St. George's Road and pointed out the common stair, No. 69, in
which he believed Slater lived. Certain inquiries were made in the stair about
half-past seven, as the result of which it was found that Slater, under the
name of Anderson, was occupying a house on the third flat. Accordingly, at
midnight, Detectives Powell, Lyon, and Millican visited the premises for the
purpose of apprehending the suspect. The door, which had the name-plate of
"Anderson" upon it, was opened by a German servant girl, who denied that any
man lived there&mdash;"No one but Madame, who was away for a short holiday."
They searched the house, which presented the appearance of having been recently
vacated, and found, among some papers scattered on the floor of the bedroom,
the cover of a registered postal packet, addressed to " Oscar Slater, Esq., c/o
A. Anderson, Esq., 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow," bearing to have been sent by
Messrs. Dent, watchmakers, London. From the neighbours in the stair they
learned that "Anderson," accompanied by a woman, had left the house that night
between eight and nine o'clock, their luggage having been previously removed by
two porters.</p>

  <p>Whether or not it be proved that Slater was in fact the murderer, it is
certainly a remarkable circumstance that suspicion was first directed to him by
what turned out to be a false clue; for, as we shall afterwards see, the pawned
brooch had no more connection with the crime than the fallacious auger, which,
it appeared, had been thrown over the wall from a disused factory adjoining the
back court.</p>

  <p>Next day, Saturday, the 26th, Detective Lieutenant Gordon called at the
house 69 St. George's Road, saw the servant, and inquired for "Anderson." She
said that Madame and "Anderson" had left the previous night for London. The
officer found two German women in the flat, one of whom, named Freedman, said
it had been arranged between Slater and her that she should occupy the house
while Madame and "Anderson" were in Monte Carlo, and that she had lent him
&pound;25 before he went. Detective Gordon called daily thereafter to inquire
if any letters had come for Anderson. On the night of the 26th the maid went to
London; the two women left on 8th January. The day before they went they handed
him a letter with the American postmark, 29th December, addressed "Oscar
Slater, c/o Mr. Anderson, 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow." Written upon the
envelope were the words, "If not delivered, return to D. R. Jacobs, 326 Third
Avenue, New York, U.S." A copy of this letter is given in the Appendix.</p>

  <p>Inquiries made at the railway stations elicited that Slater and his
companion had left the Central Station on Christmas night by the 9.5 train for
London&mdash;whether with London or Liverpool tickets was afterwards disputed;
and the London police were instantly advised of the fact. On the 29th the
Glasgow authorities received information from Liverpool that the persons wanted
had arrived there on the 26th, and had sailed the same day for New York in the
"Lusitania," under the names of "Mr. and Mrs. Otto Sando."</p>

  <p>On the 31st Mr. Stevenson, Chief Constable of Glasgow, caused a notice to
be issued offering &pound;200 reward to any one giving such information as
should lead to the apprehension and conviction of the person or persons who
committed the crime. The same day Sheriff-Substitute Glegg, on the application
of the Procurator-fiscal, granted a warrant for Slater's apprehension,
intimation of which was cabled to the New York police.</p>

  <p>When these facts became known public interest was redoubled, and news of
what would happen when the ship reached port was eagerly awaited.</p>

  <p>Early in the morning of Saturday, 2nd January, 1909, the great liner,
after a stormy passage, arrived off Sandy Hook. Acting on instructions received
from Scotland Yard, six detectives went out in a Revenue cutter, boarded her,
and arrested Slater, who, having been taken before Commissioner Shields, of the
United States District Court, was remanded to the Tombs Prison, without bail,
until 19th January, when the papers in connection with his extradition were
expected to be forwarded from Britain. When searching the prisoner the New York
police found in his possession a pawn ticket for a diamond crescent brooch,
upon which &pound;60 had been lent, issued on 21st December (the date of the
murder) by a Glasgow pawnbroker. This brooch, as afterwards appeared, had been
originally pledged by Slater for &pound;20, in name of " A. Anderson, 136
Renfrew Street," on 18th November; he raised other &pound;10 on it on 9th
December; and at mid-day on the 21st obtained a further advance of &pound;30.
The pawned brooch was therefore entirely distinct from that stolen from Miss
Gilchrist's house by the murderer; but the coincidence of the dates and
articles is a striking example of the adage that "truth is stranger than
fiction."</p>

  <p>The chief topics of discussion in Glasgow were now the identity of the
suspected man, his possible connection -with the crime, the probability of his
extradition, and the formalities connected therewith.</p>

  <p>The Treaty stipulations between Great Britain and the United States
relating to extradition are contained in the tenth article of the Treaty of
1842 and the Conventions of 1889 and 1890, the latter being chiefly important
for the extension of the number of extraditable offences; the procedure
thereunder involves considerable delay, formal application having to be made
through the Foreign Office in London to the United States Government.
Meanwhile, the Procurator-fiscal was making arrangements for the despatch of
two officers from Glasgow to proceed to New York with the documents necessary
to support the application for extradition. The depositions of the witnesses,
whose testimony formed the basis of the application, were sworn to in presence
of the officers appointed to appear in the American Court, viz., Mr. William
Warnock, chief criminal officer of Glasgow Sheriff Court, and Detective
Inspector Pyper, of the Western Division of the Glasgow Police Force, two of
the most experienced criminal officers in the city. When the arrangements were
completed, these officers, accompanied by the three principal
witnesses&mdash;Lambie, Adams, and Barrowman&mdash;sailed from Liverpool on
Wednesday, 13th January, in the White Star liner "Baltic," for New York.</p>

  <p>On 19th January, before Mr John A. Shields, U.S. Commissioner for the
Southern District of New York, the proceedings were opened "in the matter of
the application for the extradition of Otto Sands, alias Oscar Slater, under
the Treaty existing between the Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and the
United States of America." Mr. Charles Fox appeared as counsel for the
demanding Government, while the defendant was represented by Mr. Hugh Gordon
Miller and Mr. William A. Goodhart. Mr. Fox moved for an adjournment for one
week, as the witnesses from Glasgow had not yet arrived; and the Commissioner
adjourned the examination till 26th January. On the 25th the witnesses reached
New York.</p>

  <p>The Court resumed on 26th January. While the witnesses Lambie, Barrowman,
and Adams were waiting with Inspector Pyper outside the Court-room before the
examination commenced, a dramatic incident occurred. Three men came along the
corridor in which they were standing, passed them, and went into the Court;
whereupon both of the girls simultaneously said to Mr. Pyper that one of the
three was the man they had seen on the night of the murder, Lambie's expression
being, "I could nearly swear that is the man!" As this was their real
recognition of Slater, the subsequent identification in the Court-room being
only that of the man they had already recognised, the incident is of some
importance. Slater was being conducted into Court by Messrs. Chamberlain and
Pinckney, Deputy United States Marshals, and it was contended by Mr. Miller for
the defence that he was obviously in the charge of those officials. He was not,
however, handcuffed or otherwise branded as a prisoner, while his companions do
not appear to have been in uniform, though one of them wore a badge, which the
witnesses said they did not notice, and the other was a very tall man. Both
girls denied that they had been prepared to see Slater where they did.</p>

  <p>Mr. Warnock was the first witness, and proved a plan of the district in
which Miss Gilchrist's house was situated. It was proposed to ask him whether
several persons, other than Slater, had not been arrested by the Glasgow police
in connection with the crime, but this question was disallowed.</p>

  <p>Helen Lambie was next examined. She gave her account of what happened on
21st December at 15 Queen's Terrace. Much difficulty was apparently caused by
the absence of a plan of the premises, the structural arrangement of which
counsel could not understand, while the meaning of the localism "close" was
found to be incommunicable to the American mind. On the other hand, counsel's
use of the word "apartment" in the French sense, as referring to the whole
house, was equally puzzling to the witness, that term being invariably used in
Scotland to describe a single room. When asked if she saw in Court the man she
had seen in the hall on the night of the murder, Lambie replied, "One is very
suspicious, if anything," and added, "The clothes he had on that night he
hasn't got on to-day; but his face I could not tell."</p>

  <p>The Commissioner&mdash;"What did you say about his face?"</p>

  <p>Witness&mdash;"I couldn't tell his face; I never saw his face." She then
described his dress so far as she recollected&mdash;a three-quarter length fawn-
coloured coat, "something like a waterproof coat," and a cap which "looked like
one of these Donegal caps"; she also gave a representation of the peculiarity
in the man's walk, upon which alone she depended for recognising him. Finally
she identified the defendant as the man she had seen in the hall of Miss
Gilchrist's house. In cross-examination Lambie repeated that she did not see
the man's face that night. " I saw the walk; it is not the face I went by, but
the walk." She stated that the missing brooch had one row of diamonds, while
that pledged by the defendant, which she had been shown in the pawnshop in
Glasgow, had three rows. She denied that she had been in any way prompted to
recognise the defendant in the corridor, or that she had ever been shown his
photograph, in the newspapers or otherwise. [It will be observed that the
colour of the coat and character of the hat differ from those given by Lambie
in her original description to the police, and are here assimilated to those
given by Barrowman.]</p>

  <p>The next witness was Mary Barrowman, who recounted how she had seen a man
run from the house on the night in question. The "close" difficulty was again
in evidence. She described the man as having a slight twist in his nose, and as
wearing a fawn-coloured waterproof, a Donegal hat, and brown boots. When asked
if she saw the man present in Court, she first said that the defendant was
something like him, and then that he was very like him. In cross-examination
Barrowman admitted that, before identifying the defendant, she had been shown a
photograph of him. She had mentioned the twist in the nose to her mother on the
night of the crime, and to the police two days later.</p>

  <p>Arthur Montague Adams was then examined, and described what he saw and
did on the night of the murder, the "close" and "apartment" being still a cause
of stumbling. He said the man in the hall was dressed in a light grey coat,
which looked like a waterproof, and dark trousers; his hands were in his
pockets, and his head was slightly bowed. Witness thought he wore a hat; he was
sharp featured, clean shaven, and " rather a gentlemanly fellow." The defendant
was "very much like him." In cross-examination Adams said he had noticed
nothing extraordinary about the man's walk, nor did he remark the twist in the
nose. He would not go further than that the defendant "resembled him very
much." The hearing was then adjourned till 28th January.</p>

  <p>When the Court met on that day Mr. Fox offered in evidence depositions of
Helen Lambie, Mary Barrowman, Agnes Brown, Allan M'Lean, George Sabin, John
Pyper, Arthur Montague Adams, Robert Beveridge, Louise Freedman, Elsie Hoppe,
John Ord, and Gordon Henderson; also the depositions and certificates of John
Glaister, M.D., and Hugh Galt, M.D.&mdash; all of which had been taken in
Glasgow, as above narrated. These documents, being duly authenticated in terms
of the Act of Congress of 3rd August, 1882, were admitted in evidence; and the
hearing was further adjourned till the 29th to allow defendant's counsel to
examine the same.</p>

  <p>On the resumption of the hearing, Helen Lambie was recalled for further
examination by Mr. Miller, and again asked to imitate the characteristic in the
man's walk to which she had testified. As this peculiarity consisted in the
motion of his legs, which it was obviously impossible for a female witness to
illustrate, the girl was subjected to a good deal of useless browbeating. She
repeated that she had been shown no photograph of the defendant; and being
asked if she could give any reason why none was exhibited to her, as well as to
Adams and Barrowman, replied, " Because I couldn't have known it if it had been
shown to me." She now gave the man's height as an additional factor in her
recognition. She had stated in her original deposition that the man was thin;
had deponed, on the same occasion, "I couldn't say whether he had any beard,
moustache, or whiskers, or was clean shaven"; and the deposition made no
mention of the peculiar walk. With reference to her recognising the defendant
in the corridor, she denied that she had been told he was coming, or that Mr.
Pyper had described to her the man she was there to identify. She was long and
severely questioned as to her relations with Patrick Nugent, a bookmaker of her
acquaintance, who had visited her at 15 Queen's Terrace, the suggestion being
that, as she admitted having told him her mistress was a rich lady and had a
great many jewels, he was therefore concerned in the affair. Mr. Miller closed
his examination with the following questions:&mdash;"Have your suspicions in
this case ever turned towards that gambler [Nugent]? &mdash; <i>A</i>. Never.
<i>Q</i>. Do you know any other man who would be as familiar with those
premises, the wealth of the old lady, her jewellery, and the way to get into
those premises as that man? &mdash; <i>A</i>. No, sir." The Commissioner then
asked, "Was the man you met in that hallway, when you came in from buying the
paper, this gambler he speaks of?" to which witness answered, "No, sir." In
reply to Mr. Fox, Lambie stated that she had neither seen nor heard anything of
Nugent since the beginning of September. [It should be explained that no
suspicion whatever now attaches to Nugent in regard to the case.]</p>

  <p>Mary Barrowman was recalled by Mr. Miller, and admitted describing in her
deposition as tall and thin the man she had seen in West Princes Street. She
would describe the defendant in similar terms. Frederick F. Chamberlain, Deputy
United States Marshal, gave evidence as to bringing the defendant into Court
along with another official, and passing Lambie and Barrowman in the corridor.
He was wearing his official badge at the time.</p>

  <p>David Jacobs, dealer in diamond jewellery, New York, was next examined.
He had known the defendant for eight years, both in London and New York, as a
dentist who dealt in jewellery, and he had many dealings with him in diamonds.
He knew his handwriting. He had received from the defendant the following
letter:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">Glasgow, 29/11/08.</p>

  <p class="letter">Dear Jacobs,</p>

  <p class="letter">I have been coming too late to see your wife in London,
and I hope that your wife and family are in good health. I expecting to be
ready end of January to come over to New York myself. Matters are here very
bad. The New York bank affairs have done a lot to it. Now I have found out here
in Scotland it would be easy for me to pawn some of your emeralds not only in
Glasgow; there are a lot of small towns around Glasgow, also in Ireland. If you
like, send me a lot of mounted emeralds over without any diamonds around,
special scarf pins, and some loose emeralds; also send me the price list. Don't
let me wait too long, because I have only two months time here. The profits I
will divide with you. I am bringing the tickets over to you. I have been
fourteen days ago in London, and have spoken to Carry. He made some good
business. One lot I knowing of from Russia over 7000 pounds. I was offered to
buy two lots of loose coloured stones, and only you know I am not a correct
judge, and Rogers has advised me not to buy. Bravington in Kings X have spoken
to me about your affair, and have told me you would be all right with your
affair, only your friends there are the people is all could do the harm. Rogers
and I have also seen Blytell, and he sends the best regards to you. I am coming
over with Rogers end of January to start some business. Send the kind regards
to the two Wrones. In case you don't like to send the stuff, please send
answer. Best regards to you and your friends.</p>

  <p class="letter">OSCAR SLATER.<br>
  Care of Anderson,<br>
  69 St. George's Road,<br>
  Glasgow, Scotland.</p>

  <p>[Jacobs' answer to this letter, which reached Glasgow after Slater had
left for America, is printed in the Appendix.] Witness saw no peculiarity in
defendant's walk. Cross-examined by Mr. Fox, witness said that he had only
heard that defendant was a dentist. He never knew his address in London. Beyond
dealing with him in jewellery, witness did not know how he made his living.
Henry P. Wrone, jeweller, New York, stated that he had known defendant for two
or three years, and had dealt in jewellery and diamonds with him. A year and a
half before, he had repaired for the defendant a diamond crescent brooch with
three rows of stones. Cross-examined by Mr. Fox, witness denied that he had re-
set jewellery for the defendant; the latter had never brought him loose
diamonds to sell, nor any jewellery the setting of which appeared to have been
changed. He had bought no English jewellery from defendant.</p>

  <p>Mr. Adams, recalled, said that he had never been asked by the Glasgow
police to identify Nugent as the man he had seen in the hall. In reply to Mr.
Fox, he stated that he had heard Lambie and Barrowman say, " That is the man,"
when defendant came along the corridor. He did not observe that the official
who accompanied him was wearing a badge. The hearing was then adjourned till
6th February.</p>

  <p>When the Court met on that date, Mr. Miller, for the defence, said the
defendant's counsel felt that the British Government had not established under
the Treaty the case of identity which was necessary; that the defendant was
innocent, and his counsel believed him innocent: but rather than have any
misapprehension about his connection with Glasgow, the defendant had determined
to go back and face any charge that might be made against him. He only asked
that the evidence of the witnesses, who testified to his character in New York,
should be admitted in the Scottish Court. The Commissioner said that a
transcript of the proceedings would be certified as correct for production in
Scotland. [This was not, however, laid before the jury at the trial in
Edinburgh, where it was only used by the prisoner's counsel for the purpose of
cross-examining Lambie, Adams, and Barrowman.]</p>

  <p>Mr. Miller then called Sigmund Biber, real estate broker, New York, who
stated that he had known defendant for two and a half years, and had bought a
diamond ring and a watch from him two years before. He was introduced to him by
witness's brother in Germany, and considered him a responsible man in business
affairs. He had only one transaction with him. Bruno Wolfram, dealer in live
stock, New York, stated that he had known defendant for over two years. His
general reputation was that of a reliable man. He had sold him three fox
terriers, and knew him as manager of a social club in Sixth Avenue. He had
received a postcard from defendant, dated from Glasgow on 25th December, 1908,
saying he was returning to the States; witness had left the postcard at home.
He had found him trustworthy in his business transactions. In cross-
examination, the witness admitted that the sociability of the club consisted in
its members playing cards for money. He knew that defendant dealt in jewellery.
Mr. Miller then waived further examination, and Mr. Fox moved that the
defendant be remanded in the custody of the United States Marshal, to await the
action of the Secretary of State. The motion was granted by the Commissioner,
and the defendant was remanded accordingly until the warrant for his
extradition should be issued by the proper authorities at Washington.</p>

  <p>The witnesses Lambie, Adams, and Barrowman having sailed for England in
the "Baltic," reached home on 8th February, Mr. Warnock and Inspector Pyper
remaining in New York to await the warrant for extradition. This arrived from
the State Department in Washington on the 11th; and on the 14th these officers,
with their prisoner, sailed direct for Glasgow in the Anchor liner "Columbia,"
taking with them his luggage, which had been delivered to them sealed with the
United States Customs seal. The woman who accompanied Slater to America, and,
since his arrest on the "Lusitania," had been detained in the immigrants'
quarters on Ellis Island, took her passage in the "Campania" for Liverpool,
whence she went to her friends in Paris. Though referred to in the New York
proceedings as " Mrs. Slater," she was not married to the prisoner, his wife,
from whom he had separated, being still alive. The former was a Frenchwoman,
twenty-three years of age, named Andr&eacute;e Junio Antoine, who had cohabited
with him for several years.</p>

<p>Pending the result of the extradition application, the Glasgow police had
been busy securing additional evidence in the case. Several persons were found
who had seen a man watching Miss Gilchrist's house and haunting the vicinity of
West Princes Street for weeks before the murder. The discovery of the auger,
the supposed weapon, leaked out, and was duly chronicled in the Press, which
daily added to the long list of "Sensational Developments," "Startling
Discoveries," "Important New Clues," "Extraordinary Revelations,"
"Remarkable Evidence," "Interesting Interviews," and "Alleged Confessions,"
with which the popular mind was persistently inflamed.</p>

<p>Public excitement was intense, and the arrival of the "Columbia" was
impatiently awaited. The liner reached the Tail of the Bank, off Greenock,
at mid-day on 21st February. Large crowds had assembled on the
chance of Slater landing at that port, but the tide being favourable the vessel
proceeded up the Clyde towards Glasgow. Near Renfrew, however, she stopped; the
officers, with their prisoner and his baggage, were landed, and left for
Glasgow in two motor cars, thus evading the great concourse of people who were
awaiting the ship's arrival at her berth at Stobcross Quay. After many
difficulties and delays, Slater was at length safely in the hands of the
authorities, or, in the more eloquent language of a contemporary journalist,
"Hurried across the Atlantic in an ocean greyhound, slung ashore at a wayside
wharf, and whisked along the last stage of the 4000 mile journey in a motor
car: such was his transit."</p>

  <p>On the party's arrival at the Central Police Station, the prisoner's
baggage, consisting of seven pieces, was unsealed and opened in his presence by
Mr. Warnock and Inspector Pyper. In a black leather trunk were found a
waterproof coat and a claw-hammer, of which we shall hear further in the
sequel. A soft felt hat and two cloth caps were also taken possession of by the
police. In a leather case in one of his trunks was found a business card,
bearing the printed name and designation, "Oscar Slater, Dealer in Diamonds
and Precious Stones, 33 Soho Square, Oxford Street, W.," and an extract
certificate of marriage of Oscar Leschziner Slater to Marie Curtis Pryor, dated
12th July, 1902.</p>

  <p>On 21st and 22nd February the prisoner was shown to a number of witnesses
in the Central Police Station for the purpose of identification by them. What
occurred on these occasions we shall have to consider in dealing with the
evidence at the trial.</p>

  <p>The morning after his arrival the prisoner was brought up at the Central
Police Court upon the following charge:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Oscar Slater, alias Otto Sands, alias Anderson, you are charged with
having, on 21st December, 1908, in Marion Gilchrist's house, 15 Queen's
Terrace, West Princes Street, Glasgow, assaulted the said Marion Gilchrist, and
beaten her and fractured her skull, and murdered her.</p>

  <p>Mr. Ewing Speirs, of Messrs. Joseph Shaughnessy &amp; Son, solicitors,
Glasgow, appeared for Slater, who was remanded for forty-eight hours. On the
24th he was formally remitted to the Sheriff, before whom, later in the day, he
emitted the following declaration:&mdash;</p>

  <p>My name is Oscar Slater. I am a native of Germany, married, thirty-eight
years of age, a dentist, and have no residence at present. I know nothing about
the charge of having assaulted Marion Gilchrist and murdering her. I am
innocent. All which I declare to be truth.</p>

  <p>Thereafter he was removed to Duke Street Prison, to await his trial in
the High Court of Justiciary, at Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, on 22nd February, Professors Glaister and Littlejohn had been
requested by the authorities to examine and report upon the following
articles:&mdash;(1) Waterproof coat; (2) hat; (3) hammer, all of which had been
found, as above mentioned, in the prisoner's baggage; and (4) auger found in
the back court of Miss Gilchrist's house. The results of their examination were
embodied in a report which is printed in the report of the trial.</p>

  <p>The preparation of the case for the prosecution entailed an immense
amount of labour upon the Crown officials, and the indictment, to which were
appended lists of sixty-nine productions and ninety-eight witnesses, was not
served on the prisoner until 6th April. It was in these terms?</p>

  <p>Oscar Slater, sometime residing at 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow, and
presently a prisoner in the prison of Glasgow, you are indicted at the instance
of the Right Honourable Alexander Ure, His Majesty's Advocate, and the charge
against you is that you did, on 21st December, 1908, in Marion Gilchrist's
house, 15 Queen's Terrace, West Princes Street, Glasgow, assault the said
Marion Gilchrist, and did beat her with a hammer or other blunt instrument, and
fracture her skull, and did murder her.</p>

  <p>The trial was appointed to take place before the High Court at Edinburgh
on Monday, 3rd May. The pleading diet was held at Glasgow on 20th April, in the
Old Court, Jail Square, before Sheriff-Substitute Mackenzie. Mr. Hart,
Procurator-fiscal for Lanarkshire, represented the Crown, and Mr. Ewing Speirs
appeared for the prisoner. The indictment having been read, the Sheriff put the
question, "Are you guilty or not guilty?" to which the prisoner replied, "I am
not guilty." He was then formally remitted to the High Court, and was taken
back to Duke Street Prison.</p>

  <p>In the course of the following week Slater was removed from Glasgow to
the Calton Jail, Edinburgh, and there, on 28th April, a consultation was held
with Mr. A. L. M'Clure, K.C., Sheriff of Argyll, and Mr. John Mair, advocate,
Edinburgh, the counsel retained for the defence. Although over four months had
elapsed since the tragedy, public excitement continued unabated, and the result
of the impending trial was awaited with intense interest.</p>

  <p>The High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh has been the scene of many a
grim and tragic spectacle, the chief actors in which are memorable in the
annals of Scottish crime. Among the famous occupants of its historic dock the
names of Burke, Madeleine Smith, Pritchard, Chantrelle, Laurie, and Monson are
still preserved, as the protagonists of their respective dramas. The man who,
in his turn, sat in their seat upon the like awful occasion, was the central
figure in a tragedy as strange as any of those by which they are remembered.</p>

  <p>Lord Guthrie presided; the prosecution was conducted by the Lord Advocate
(Mr. Alexander Ure, K.C.), assisted by Mr. T. B. Morison, K.C., and Mr. Lyon
Mackenzie, Advocates-depute; the prisoner, as already mentioned, was defended
by Mr. M'Clure and Mr. Mair.</p>

  <p>The following record of the trial contains a full report of the evidence,
that of every important witness being printed verbatim. The Lord Advocate's
address to the jury&mdash;than which few more powerful have been heard within
those walls&mdash; brilliantly presents the case for the prosecution in its
strongest light; while that of Mr. M'Clure, though lacking the trenchancy of
the Lord Advocate's speech, contains an elaborate criticism of the
discrepancies in the Crown case. The weighty and impressive charge of the
presiding judge admirably holds the balance of the momentous issue. In view of
these advantages, the reader might well be left to a consideration of the
evidence as it stands; but, regard being had to its extent and complexity, it
may perhaps assist him in its perusal briefly to examine here certain of its
more important features.</p>

  <p>The evidence adduced for the prosecution was (a) direct and (6) indirect,
or circumstantial. By direct evidence the Crown sought to establish from the
testimony of eye-witnesses the identity of the prisoner at the bar and (1) a
man who before the murder haunted the vicinity of the house, (2) a man seen
leaving the house after the murder. By circumstantial evidence the Crown
endeavoured to prove, from the behaviour of the prisoner himself, both before
and after the crime, and from other relevant facts and circumstances, that his
was certainly the hand that did the deed.</p>

  <div align="center"><img src="1202631h-images/OscarSlater03.jpg" title="Oscar Slater
on trial in the High Court of Justiciary, Edinburgh"></div><br>

  <p>The accused, as already mentioned, was, on 21st and 22nd February, within
the Central Police Station, identified by twelve witnesses as the man they had
seen watching the house. Prior to their seeing the man in West Princes Street
none of them (excepting Constable Brien) knew him by sight, and none of them
had ever seen Slater. Some saw the man five or six times, others once only;
some saw him at night, others by day. With regard to the manner of their
identification it may be generally observed that all of them had previously
seen in the newspapers photographs of Slater, as an obvious foreigner, and had
read the alternative descriptions of the wanted man furnished to the police by
(1) Adams and Lambie and (2) the girl Barrowman. As the prisoner, in order to
identification, was placed among eleven other men, nine being policemen in
plain clothes, and two being railway officials, all Scotsmen, none of whom in
any way resembled him, it is not too much to say that the task of selecting the
suspect was unattended by serious difficulty. All the witnesses picked him out
with ease, but the effect of this unanimity was somewhat lessened when, in the
witness-box, they had to give the grounds of their belief.</p>

  <p>Mrs. M'Haffie lived in the first flat of 16 West Princes Street, on the
opposite side from Miss Gilchrist's house, but nearer St. George's Road. She
observed from her window, for some weeks before the murder, a man loitering on
the other side of the street. She saw him there on five or six occasions,
always in the afternoon, and for half an hour at a time. He was dark, had a
moustache, and wore a light overcoat (not a waterproof), check trousers, spats,
and a black bowler hat. She observed nothing peculiar about his nose. He did
not carry himself well, but slouched along with his hands in his pockets. She
last saw him eight or nine days before the murder. The prisoner was the man. He
was the only man of foreign appearance who was in the room when she identified
him at the Central Police Station.</p>

  <p>Margaret Dickson M'Haffie, her daughter, gave similar evidence. On one or
two occasions the man was wearing a black morning coat instead of a light
overcoat, as well as light check trousers. She admitted that, in March, she had
told the agent for the prisoner that she was not then quite sure of the accused
being the man, and was only prepared to say there was some resemblance; but she
had been thinking it over, and had come to the conclusion that he was the
man.</p>

  <p>Annie Rankin M'Haffie, another daughter, said that four weeks before the
murder, between seven and eight at night, a man rang the bell of their front
door, which bore the name " Mr. M'Haffie " on a brass plate, and asked her if
any one named Anderson lived there. She said " No," and he turned and walked
downstairs. The bell rang again within a minute, and she found her cousin Madge
at the door, who said she had met a man on the stair. That was the only time
she saw the man. The prisoner was like him. In reply to the judge, witness did
not notice anything about the man's accent; he did not appear to be a
foreigner. [It is to be noted that Slater speaks broken English, and that his
accent is unmistakably foreign.]</p>

  <p>Madge M'Haffie spoke to calling at her aunt's house on the occasion in
question, and meeting a peculiar-looking man on the stair. He was dark, and had
a moustache. His nose did not attract her attention. He wore black check
trousers, a fawn overcoat, a black bowler hat, and fawn gaiters. A few days
later she saw from her aunt's window the same man walking up and down. On
leaving the house she passed him in St. George's Road. He walked with a
shuffling gait. The prisoner was fairly like the man in general appearance.</p>

  <p>Constable Brien knew the prisoner by sight, having seen him several times
in St. George's Road for seven weeks before the murder. One night, a week
before 21st December, he saw him, at half-past nine, standing against the
railings in West Princes Street, a few yards from the corner of St. George's
Road. Witness thought he was drunk, and took a good look at him, but saw he was
sober. He had on a light coat and a hat. When witness identified the prisoner
the other men present were constables in undress and detectives. [It may be
mentioned, with general reference to the evidence of these witnesses, that the
distance between Slater's house in St. George's Road and West Princes Street is
less than a quarter of a mile.]</p>

  <p>Constable Walker, who was on night duty in the beginning of December, at
a quarter to six o'clock on 1st December saw a man standing on the edge of the
pavement opposite 15 Queen's Terrace. He thought he recognised him as Mr.
Paradise (a Crown witness), whom he knew, and waved to him across the street.
He saw he was mistaken. Three nights later he met the same man, at the same
hour, further down the street, walking towards Queen's Terrace. On 17th or 18th
December he again saw the man, at a quarter to seven, standing at the east end
of West Princes Street, near St. George's Road. On each occasion witness was on
the opposite side of the street. When he identified the prisoner as the man, he
knew the man he was to identify was a person of foreign appearance. The other
men there were policemen and detectives.</p>

  <p>Euphemia Cunningham, employed in St. George's Road, was going home for
dinner about one o'clock on Monday, 14th December, through West Princes Street,
when she saw a man standing at the corner of Queen's Crescent looking towards
Miss Gilchrist's house. On 15th, 16th, and 17th December she saw the same man
at the same time and place. On each occasion, when she passed again about two
o'clock, the man had gone. He was of foreign appearance, very dark, with a
sallow complexion, and heavy-featured. He was clean shaven. She saw no
peculiarity about his nose. He wore a dark tweed coat and a green cap with a
peak. She only saw the side of his face and the back of his head. She
identified the prisoner in the police office as the man, where he was shown to
her in a green cap, which did not belong to him. She had previously recognised
him from a photograph of his full face, with a moustache. When she identified
the prisoner the other men present were obviously policemen.</p>

  <p>William Campbell accompanied the witness Cunningham on 15th, 16th, and
17th December, and corroborated her statement. He had a better opportunity of
seeing the man than she had, because he passed next to him. There was a general
resemblance between the prisoner and the man, but he could not positively
identify him.</p>

  <p>Alexander Gillies resided in a flat at 46 West Princes Street, directly
opposite Miss Gilchrist's house. On the evening of the Wednesday, Thursday, or
Friday before the murder, on returning home at a quarter to six o'clock, he
found a man standing at the foot of the common stair at the back of the close,
the door of which was open. The man turned his back and blocked the passage;
witness asked him to let him pass, but the man went up to the second flight,
and still stood on the stair. Witness had again to ask leave to pass, passed
him, and entered his own house. The man's face was then towards him. He was
sallow, dark-haired, and clean shaven; and wore a long fawn-coloured coat and
a cap. The prisoner resembled him, but witness could not say he was the same
man.</p>

  <p>Robert Brown Bryson was walking from Queen's Crescent into West Princes
Street at 7.40 p.m. on Sunday, 20th December, accompanied by his wife. He
observed a man standing at the top of the steps leading to the close 58 West
Princes Street, a little to the west of Miss Gilchrist's house, on the opposite
side, staring up at her windows, which were lighted. When the man saw witness
looking at him he came down the steps, met witness about four feet from the
close, and passed him on the left, walking slowly westward. Witness turned
round and watched him as he walked away. The walk did not attract his notice,
further than that it was not smart. The man wore a black coat (or jacket) and
vest, and a black bowler hat, but no overcoat. He had a black moustache with a
slight droop, was sallow, and of foreign appearance. Witness identified the
prisoner as the man, first from a photograph of Slater shown him by a
detective, afterwards at the police station, and then in Court. He had drawn
his wife's attention to the man at the time, but she did not recollect his
making any remark on the subject. [She was not called as a witness at the
trial.] Witness was unable to describe what the accused was wearing when he,
along with the other witnesses, identified him at the police office.</p>

  <p>Andrew Nairn, at a quarter-past nine o'clock the same night (Sunday, 20th
December), was passing across West Princes Street from Queen's Crescent on his
way home. His wife and children were following some distance behind. On the
north side of West Princes Street, about one hundred and twenty yards from Miss
Gilchrist's house, he waited for them to join him. While doing so he noticed a
man thirteen yards away on the same side standing at the corner of the gardens
in the middle of the pavement, with his back to the witness, looking towards 15
Queen's Terrace. Witness did not see his face. He had broad shoulders, a
longish neck, and black hair. He wore a motor cap with the flaps up and a light
overcoat reaching below the knees. Witness watched him for five minutes till
his wife came up, and pointed him out to her, when they left him standing in
the same place. [His wife was not called as a witness at the trial.] Nairn had
already identified prisoner in the Central Police Station as the man; and being
asked by the Lord Advocate if the accused was the man, witness said to the
prisoner, " You might turn your back. Yes, I am certain that is the man I saw."
Pressed by Mr. M'Clure as to how he could be so positive in his identification
of a man he had seen but once, seeing only his back, at a distance of thirteen
yards, at 9.15 on a December night, that man being upon his trial for murder,
witness replied, " Oh, I will not swear in fact, but I am certain that he is
the man I saw; but I will not swear," adding that, not having seen the man's
face, he would not go the length of being positive. [The relative positions of
this witness and the man are indicated by the numbers 8 and 7 upon the enlarged
plan of West Princes Street.]</p>

  <p>No attempt was made by the defence to prove an alibi with respect to any
one of the occasions spoken to by the first nine witnesses above mentioned.
But, in regard to the testimony of the two last, Bryson and Nairn, it was
contended that the prisoner could not have been the man they had seen, as he
was not out of his own house that night. Antoine, his mistress, and Schmalz,
his maid-servant, swore that Slater, during the time he was in Glasgow, always
remained indoors the whole day every Sunday; and that, in particular, he was
never out of the house at all on Sunday, the 20th. They further stated that a
friend of his, named Samuel Reid, dined with them at 69 St. George's Road that
evening, coming about six o'clock and remaining until 10.30 or 10.45. Reid
deponed that he dined with Slater at seven o'clock that night. He went at six
and stayed till 10.30. He had one of his children with him. Slater never left
the house during his visit. He had spent every Sunday evening with Slater while
in Glasgow, and remembered the 20th, as it was the last time he saw him,
witness going to Belfast next day. On the night in question Slater's moustache
was growing, and was very noticeable, his hair being very black. No one could
have mistaken him for a clean-shaven man.</p>

  <p>At the trial the learned judge, with general reference to Antoine's
evidence, alluded to the " tremendous motives " which she had for standing by
the prisoner. In the case of Schmalz these would not operate, as her connection
with the Slater menage had terminated on 26th December. The Lord Advocate
elicited from Keid, in cross-examination, that he was a bookmaker; but this
fact does not necessarily infer a proneness to commit perjury, and in other
respects his evidence was unshaken.</p>

  <p>The last witness to identify Slater as the watcher in the street was Mrs.
Liddell, a married sister of the witness Adams. On Monday, 21st December, the
night of the murder, this lady called at her brother's house in Queen's Terrace
at five minutes to seven. She approached from the direction of St. George's
Road. Before reaching the door she saw a man leaning with his arm on the
railing under the eastmost window of her brother's dining-room. She stared at
him "almost rudely." She only saw the left side of his face. She was much
struck by the peculiarity of his nose. He had a very clear complexion, not
sallow; was very dark, and was clean shaven. He wore a low-down collar, an
ordinary cap of brownish tweed, and a heavy coat, also of brownish tweed, the
collar of which had a hemmed edge. It was a thick coat, of different material
from the waterproof produced. After she passed "he glided from the railings and
disappeared." She did not mention having seen the man till the following
Wednesday&mdash;two days after the murder. When she identified Slater at the
police station she was surprised at his robust figure; the man at the railing
had the appearance of a delicate man, "rather drawn together." Finally, witness
said she believed the prisoner was the man.</p>

  <p>We now come to the three crucial witnesses for the Crown&mdash; Lambie,
Adams, and Barrowman&mdash;with whose evidence, as given at the extradition
proceedings in New York, we have-already dealt. The substance of the evidence
of Lambie and Adams forms the foregoing account of what occurred on the night
of the murder in the hall of Miss Gilchrist's house. In reply to the Lord
Advocate, Lambie repeated, with some variations, the story she had told in
America. She looked at the clock before she went out&mdash;it was just seven.
She saw no one in West Princes Street except her friend the constable. She was
away from the house about ten minutes altogether. She still maintained that she
had not entered the house when the man appeared in the hall and passed Adams on
the threshold. Adams stood behind her while she unlocked the door. When she did
so, and saw the man, she stepped back. "The man when he passed me was very
close to me. I noticed that he held his head down. I turned round to look at
him, and I got a good look at him. I heard him going down the stairs. He did
not go down rapidly; he went deliberately. I went instantly into the house. The
man, when I saw him first, was coming from the direction of Miss Gilchrist's
bedroom. He had nothing in his hand. He was wearing a dark cap, a fawn
overcoat, and dark trousers. His coat was open. No. 43 of the productions is
the coat that he wore."</p>

  <p>It is to be observed that, had Lambie been standing in the doorway, she
would have seen the man as he descended the stairs; if, as Adams states, she
was in the act of entering the kitchen at the time, she could only hear him
doing so. Her version of the scene should be compared with that of Adams, the
next witness mentioned.</p>

  <p>In cross-examination, Lambie was asked by Mr. M'Clure what enabled her to
identify the waterproof produced as the very coat the man was wearing, to which
her only reply was, "That is the coat"&mdash;an instance of her mental capacity
to which Lord Guthrie referred in his charge to the jury. As she stated in her
examination-in-chief that she had seen the man's face, and identified it as the
prisoner's, Mr. M'Clure made effective use of her reiterated statement in
America that she never saw the face, but went by the walk alone. She now said
what she then meant was that she did not see the full face, but only the side;
she saw it when he was going down the stair. The man was clean shaven. She did
not notice the man coming out of the bedroom door; he was past the door before
she saw him. When he passed her and Adams, "they were both on the door mat."
[Had this been so, Lambie must have seen the man face to face as he emerged
from the bedroom door. If, as Adams swears, she was then about to enter the
kitchen, her back was towards the bedroom door; which her own expression, "I
turned round to look at him," confirms.]</p>

  <p>Arthur Montague Adams deponed to the facts as already narrated. The man
was a little taller than witness, a little broader in the shoulders, not a well-
built man, but well featured and clean shaven. He had on dark trousers, and a
light overcoat; whether fawn or grey witness could not say, and was not sure as
to the kind of hat, but it was not a cap.</p>

  <p>He seemed gentlemanly and well dressed. He had nothing in his hands.
Witness saw nothing special about his nose, and did not notice anything about
his way of walking. When Lambie unlocked the door there was no one in the hall.
She made straight for the kitchen, had got as far as the hall clock, some eight
or ten steps in, and was just going to enter the kitchen, when the man appeared
from the bedroom. She was thoroughly taken aback; "she stood and stared, and
did not open her mouth." Witness had no doubt at all that he had a better
opportunity of seeing the man than Lambie, because he met him face to face. The
lobby was well lit. The man "walked quite coolly, as if the house belonged to
him," till he got up to witness, and then darted down the stair "like greased
lightning, and banged the door at the foot of the close." Witness had pointed
out Slater in the Commissioner's room in New York, but did not say that he was
the man; he said he closely resembled the man. He went by the general
appearance only. In cross-examination, Mr. Adams, quite fairly, admitted that,
before indicating Slater on that occasion, he had seen him identified by Lambie
and Barrowman. Even after all he had heard, witness did not give an absolutely
confident opinion that the prisoner was the man; "it was too serious a charge
for him to say from a passing glance." [In justice to Mr. Adams, it has to be
borne in mind that he said he was somewhat short-sighted, and had not on his
spectacles when he saw the man in the hall.]</p>

  <p>Had the Crown relied solely upon the testimony of Lambie and Adams to
identify the accused as the murderer, they could hardly have expected a
verdict; but the prosecution was able to produce a witness of a different
calibre, who saw the murderer flying from the house. This was Mary Barrowman,
the message girl of fifteen, who had identified the prisoner in the corridor
and in the Commissioner's room at New York, as already mentioned, and also at
the police station in Glasgow. She repeated how, at the lamp-post, she saw the
man run from the close and down the steps. He came towards her very fast, ran
up against her, and on towards West Cumberland Street, down which he turned.
She got a good look at him, both as he was coming up to her and when he knocked
up against her. When he passed her, she turned to look after him. It was quite
bright near the lamp-post. The man was tall and broad-shouldered, and " had a
slight twist in his nose." He was clean shaven and dark haired. "He had a
Donegal hat on, and was wearing it down on his face." He wore a fawn overcoat,
a dark suit of clothes, and dark brown boots. She then told how she turned
back, and followed the man as far as the next lamp-post, until she saw him run
round the corner into West Cumberland Street, when she resumed her way. She had
picked out the prisoner, both in America and at the police station, without any
difficulty. On the latter occasion he was shown to her wearing the waterproof
No. 43 of the productions, and the hat No. 44; both were very like the articles
worn by the man on the night of the murder. She had asked prisoner to pull the
hat down further, and then recognised it as she had seen it that night. In
answer to the Lord Advocate's final question, "Look at the prisoner: is that
the man?" she replied, "Yes, that is the man who knocked against me that
night." In cross-examination, Barrowman said that the man came down from the
close two steps at a time; when he passed her, he was running at the top of his
speed. His hat was pulled down "just about as far as his eyes." His coat was
not buttoned; he was holding it up as he ran, with his hands in the pockets.
When she followed the man, she thought he was running for a car. [The nearest
car lines are in Great Western Road and St. George's Road, the opposite
direction to that in which the man was then running.] She did not see his face
for more than a couple of seconds. Slater had a moustache when she recognised
him in America and in Glasgow; and the three photographs by which, in New York,
she had identified him as the man, also showed him with a moustache. She had
recognised him in all the photographs, although Inspector Pyper, who was
present at the time, said she failed to do so in any of them. The nose of the
man was twisted to the right side. She and Lambie occupied the same cabin for
twelve days on the voyage out, but they never mentioned the object of their
journey, nor discussed the appearance of the man. Lambie had pointed Slater out
in the Court-room before she (witness) identified him. When she recognised
Slater in the corridor at New York she did not see that he was in charge of the
two men, between whom he walked. In reply to the judge, no one had told her not
to talk to Lambie about the case. In re-examination, she had now seen Slater
several times, and had no doubt he was the man.</p>

  <p>The main objections to which the strong evidence of this witness is open
are her youth (she was not fifteen till January, 1909); the improbability of
her being able to describe, with so great minuteness, the appearance of a man
rushing past her at top speed, shortly after seven o'clock on a December night;
the fact that the hat No. 44 was not a Donegal or tweed hat, but a soft, black
felt hat; and the obvious difficulty in believing that two girls of fifteen and
twenty-one, in such unusual circumstances as a voyage across the Atlantic for
the purpose of identifying a murderer, never spoke of the matter at all. On the
other hand, it has to be kept in view that Barrowman told her mother what she
had seen on her return home that night, and then said she would know the man
again if she saw him; that, on 23rd December, two nights later, she described
the man to two detectives; and that she never varied her original description,
but stuck to her story throughout.</p>

  <p>The name of Agnes Brown, teacher, 48 Grant Street, Glasgow, stands No. 46
on the list of witnesses for the prosecution. This witness, though in
attendance at the trial, was not called either by the Crown or the defence; but
her testimony was embodied in a deposition which, among others, had, as already
mentioned, been admitted in evidence by the Commissioner at the extradition
proceedings in New York, and thus, though not before the jury at the trial, it
forms part of the case against the prisoner. A copy of the deposition will be
found in the Appendix. This lady stated to Mr. Speirs, the agent for the
defence, that, on the evening of 21st December, she was going from her house in
Grant Street to an evening class in Dunard Street. Leaving shortly after seven
o'clock, she had reached the corner of West Cumberland Street and West Princes
Street at 7.10, when two men came running westward along the pavement of that
street from the direction of St. George's Road, one of whom collided with her,
and nearly knocked her down. The men continued to run along West Princes Street
as far as Carrington Street, when they left the pavement and ran on in the
middle of the road. They then ran across the road, and turned down Rupert
Street to the right. They were well-dressed men, and she wondered why they were
running in that manner, When one of them collided with her she obtained a
profile view of both their faces; she also had a back view of them as they
passed her. The man next her, and who collided with her, was dressed in a
winter overcoat of a medium grey, three-quarters length, reaching past his
knees. He had a close-fitting, dark cloth cap, with a scoop in front. It was a
plain cap, with plain sides and no double brim, and had no buttons. He had on
dark trousers. She was not sure whether his boots were black or brown. His coat
was buttoned close up, and he had his hands in his pockets. He was a dark man,
neither tall nor short. He had neither beard nor whiskers. She could not be
positive whether he had a moustache or not. She saw nothing peculiar about his
nose. He would be about 5 feet 8 inches or 5 feet 9 inches in height. The other
man was about the same height. He had dark hair. He had neither beard nor
whiskers. She was inclined to think he was clean shaven. He had no hat on, and
he was not carrying any hat in his hand, so far as she saw. He had on a navy
blue Melton coat, with a dark velvet collar. His coat was open. He had on a
dark pair of trousers and black boots. The man with the blue coat had on a
spotless collar. It looked almost new. She did not see anything peculiar about
his nose. This man had his right arm hanging by his side, and seemed to be
holding something in his hand. He had his left hand at his side as he passed
her; but, after passing her, he seemed to carry whatever he was carrying a
little in front of him. She saw no man running away by himself, clad in a
waterproof coat and a Donegal hat. She heard of the murder on her return home,
at ten o'clock, and told her sisters about the men she had seen. The same week
she made a statement to two detectives. She was interviewed later by
Superintendent Douglas; Mr. Stevenson, the chief constable; and Mr. Hart, the
Procurator-fiscal. She was also at the Western Police Office for the purpose of
identifying several suspects, but recognised none as being either of the men
she had seen running away. On 21st February she was shown Slater, among twelve
to fifteen other men, in the Central Police Station. She could recognise none
of them by their front face view. Having seen them in right profile and also in
back view, she pointed out Slater as the further away from her of the two men
who passed her on the night of the murder. What led her to point out Slater was
his black hair, and the fact that his ears stuck out somewhat from his head and
were rather low down on the side of his head, his rather short neck, and his
square shoulders. He also had rather a square jaw, and appeared to her to be
about the same height. The back view and the profile view made her come to the
conclusion that he was very like the man she had seen. [This statement should
be compared with the sworn deposition printed in the Appendix.]</p>

  <p>It is, of course, to be kept in view that the importance of Miss Brown's
statement might have been materially affected by cross-examination in the
witness-box; taken as it stands it only deepens the mystery, and affords a
further example of the difficulties attending evidence of identity based on
personal impressions.</p>

  <p>Two witnesses remain who recognised the accused in circumstances alleged
by the Crown to connect him with the murderer. Annie Armour, booking clerk, was
on the night in question attending to her duties in the ticket office at the
Kelvinbridge station of the Glasgow District Subway, when, between half past
seven and eight o'clock, a man rushed through the turnstile, flung down a
penny, and, without waiting for his ticket, ran down the stair to the platform.
He stumbled on the stair and caught hold of the railing. He looked so excited,
and gave witness such a fright that she cried out. He was of medium height,
dark, clean shaven, and wore a light overcoat&mdash; she did not know whether
he had on a hat or a cap. She saw his face. She had no difficulty in pointing
out Slater at the police station; the prisoner was the man. In cross-
examination she stated that the man's coat was a shade darker than the
waterproof produced, but was otherwise similar to it. She did not notice the
man's nose, but was quite certain he had no moustache. She had seen Slater's
photograph and read the description before identifying him. The time could not
have been later than a quarter to eight.</p>

  <p>William Sancroft, car conductor, stated that on Wednesday, 23rd December,
at 6.5 p.m., a man boarded his car at the end of Union Street, near Argyle
Street, and took his seat on the top. The man was in a hurry. When witness went
upstairs to collect the fares near West George Street the man had a penny in
his hand and received a ticket. Witness asked a boy who was reading an evening
paper on the opposite seat if there was any clue to the murderer. The boy
replied, "No, there is not any clue yet, and I don't think there is any
likelihood of getting one." The man then jumped up and, pushing past them, ran
downstairs. Witness followed him, and saw him running full speed across to
Garscadden Street. He left the car before reaching the halfpenny station. The
prisoner was the man. He had been unable to trace the boy, who at that time was
a regular traveller on his car.</p>

  <p>Having dealt in some detail, as befits its importance, with the evidence
of all the witnesses who identified Slater either as the supposed murderer or
as the watcher in the street, we have now briefly to examine the circumstantial
evidence adduced by the Crown in its support.</p>

  <p>The main facts, so far as these were ascertained, of Slater's life in
Glasgow during the months of November and December, 1908, were not in dispute,
and may, for the reader's convenience, here be shortly narrated in the order in
which they occurred from the evidence of the witnesses who spoke to them at the
trial. The inferences to be drawn therefrom formed the question at issue.</p>

  <p>Oscar Slater (whose real surname appears to be Leschziner), a German Jew,
thirty-eight years of age, who described himself indifferently on his visiting
card as "dentist" or "dealer in diamonds and precious stones," arrived in
Glasgow from London on or about 26th October, and put up at the Central Hotel.
He had been in Glasgow on at least two previous occasions, viz., for some nine
months in 1901, the year of the Glasgow Exhibition, and again, for what period
is not stated, in 1905. On 3rd November he pledged for &pound;5 with J. L.
Bryce, pawnbroker, two gold rings, three pearl studs, and other articles in the
name of "Oscar Slater, Central Station Hotel." On the 4th he was joined by
Andr&eacute;e Junio Antoine (who in London was known as Madame Junio) and her
servant,
Schmalz. The three then took lodgings for a week at 136 Renfrew Street. That
day Slater called on Stuart &amp; Stuart, house furnishers, St. George's Road,
saw the manager, Isaac Paradise, and asked their terms for furnishing a house
on the instalment system. He gave his name as "Mr. Anderson." Following upon
the above interview, Slater, as A. Anderson, dentist, 36 Albemarle Street,
Piccadilly," called on J. S. Marr, house agent, and proposed to take a flat at
69 St. George's Road. On the 6th Mr. Marr, being satisfied with the references
given&mdash;Robert Rogers and Davenport &amp; Co., both of London&mdash;let the
flat to Slater from 28th November till 28th May, 1909, at a rent of &pound;42
per annum. Slater again called on Stuart &amp; Stuart, and selected furniture
for his house to the value of &pound;178 16s. 6d., paid &pound;10 as a deposit,
and agreed to pay the balance by monthly instalments of &pound;4. On the 9th he
ordered from W. Lyon, stationer, fresh visiting cards in name of "A. Anderson,
69 St. George's Road, Charing Cross, Glasgow, three up, right," and, on the
10th, bought from Hepburn &amp; Marshall a set of household tools, consisting
of a hammer, screwdriver, pliers, &amp;c., on a card for 2s. 6d. The furniture
having been delivered, Slater, "Madame," and Schmalz then removed to the flat
in St. George's Road, the door of which bore the name of "Anderson." Antoine
explained the false name as a device to evade his wife, who had previously
interfered with them.</p>

  <p>During Slater's stay there his daily habits, according to the evidence of
Schmalz, were as follows:&mdash;he rose about 9.30, and generally went out in
the forenoon, returning for lunch; went out in the afternoon, and always dined
at home, the dinner hour being seven o'clock&mdash;though Schmalz had seen it
as late as eight. He was never out of the house on Sundays. No dentistry
business was carried on in the house, and, so far as she knew, her master had
no occupation.</p>

  <p>It appears from the evidence that Slater's chief friends, while in
Glasgow, were the witnesses Cameron and Rattman, with whom he was in company
nearly every day. They frequented Gall's public-house, Cowcaddens; the Crown
Hall billiard rooms, 98 Sauchiehall Street; Johnston's billiard rooms, 126
Renfield Street; the Motor Club, 26 India Street; and the M.O.S.C. or Sloper
Club, 24 India Street, of which Slater afterwards became a member. The two last
named were gambling clubs.</p>

  <p>On the 12th November Slater opened a Post Office Savings Bank account in
name of "Adolf Anderson," and next day made, through the bank, a purchase of
Consols in that name. He also redeemed the articles he had pledged with Bryce.
On the 14th he pledged with A. J. Liddell, pawnbroker, a diamond scarfpin for
&pound;5 in name of "Anderson." On the same day he called at the shop of Jacob
Jackson and offered to sell him a diamond ring, as he was hard up. Jackson
refused to buy the ring, but offered him employment as a canvasser, which he
declined. He did not give his name or address. On the 16th Slater called at the
shop of R.S. Bamber, hairdresser, Charing Cross, and was shaved by the witness
Nichols. He then had a moustache. Nichols observed a peculiarity about his
nose&mdash;it was not a twisted nose, but a nose that had been broken. He made
some purchases there in the name of "Anderson" that day; deposited his own
shaving materials; and continued regularly to call to be shaved, several times
a week, till 25th December. On the 17th he pledged with Liddell a gold purse,
fountain pen, three pearl studs, and a ring for &pound;6, and on the following
day he obtained an advance of &pound;20 upon a diamond crescent brooch, giving
his address as "136 Renfrew Street." Between 21st November and 1st December
Slater, in Bamber's shop, offered to sell to Nichols, who was shaving him, some
blankets, curtains, and kitchen furniture, which he said were quite new.</p>

  <p>About 23rd November (four weeks before the murder), according to the
witness Rattman, Slater, in Gall's public-house, wanted to sell him a ring. The
witness Aumann made an offer for it, which Slater would not accept. About 24th
or 25th November Slater called at the Motor Club and asked for the witness
Cameron, who came out and took him upstairs. About 30th November, the witness
Barr met Slater in the Sloper Club in the company of Cameron, who asked him to
propose Slater as a member. Barr demurred to doing so, as Slater's reputation
was not good, but ultimately agreed to put his name up.</p>

  <p>On 1st December Slater was elected a member of the Sloper Club, his
address being given as " Renfrew Street." About the 4th Slater mentioned to
Nichols, who was shaving him, that he had lost a diamond pin. Nichols advised
him to communicate with the police, but he replied it was best to leave them
alone as much as one could. About this date Slater spoke to Aumann of his
intention to go to America. He said he would go so soon as he got rid of his
house, and mentioned a letter which he had received from San Francisco. On 6th
December Slater was seen in the Motor Club with Cameron by the witness
Henderson. He then wore a black bowler hat and a Melton coat. On the 7th Slater
pledged with Bryce a pair of binocular glasses for &pound;2 10s. About this
date Slater told Cameron of his intention to go abroad. Between this time and
21st December Slater was seen by the witness M'Lean every second or third night
playing cards at the Sloper Club.</p>

  <p>On the 9th Slater sent his watch to Dent, watchmaker, London, for repair,
giving his name as "Anderson," and requesting its return to him at 69 St.
George's Road not later than 30th December. The same day he obtained from
Liddell a further advance of &pound;10 upon the diamond brooch. About this date
Aumann, by Slater's desire, inspected the flat and furniture at 69 St. George's
Road, with a view to his taking them over. Aumann, however, declined to do so,
and Slater said he would look out for some one else. On the 10th Slater, in
name of "Anderson," paid &pound;4 to Stuart &amp; Stuart as an instalment to
account of the price of the furniture supplied by them. About 11th December
Slater showed Cameron a letter he had received from San Francisco, advising him
to come out, as business was good. Slater said he intended to go, and gave
Cameron his address there.</p>

  <p>About ten days or a fortnight before Christmas (11th or 15th December),
when Slater called at Bamber's to be shaved as usual, Nichols remarked that his
moustache had been taken off, and that day he shaved Slater's upper lip for the
first and only time. Slater told him he was a dentist, and was waiting for his
partner to join him. He mentioned several places&mdash;Queensland and San
Francisco. About the middle of December, Cameron noticed that Slater had shaved
his moustache; he commented on the fact, and Slater explained that it was
"getting a bit scraggy."</p>

  <p>About 15th December (ten days before Christmas), Slater showed Rattman a
letter, which he had received from San Francisco, and said he intended going
there so soon as he could arrange for his house being taken over. On the 17th,
Slater deposited &pound;5 in the Post Office Savings Bank&mdash;the last
deposit he made. On the 18th or 19th, Cameron says he saw Slater for the last
time before the murder, and, on one or other of those nights, the witness Barr
met Slater at the Sloper Club. He generally saw him there once or twice a week.
Slater was always well dressed. He never saw him wearing a drab or fawn-
coloured waterproof.</p>

  <p>Between one and three o'clock, on the morning of Sunday or Monday, 20th
or 21st December, the witness M'Lean, who subsequently gave information to the
police, saw Slater at the Sloper Club playing "poker." He was then clean
shaven, or had a very small growth on his upper lip. He wore a dark suit, a
fawn overcoat, and a dark cap. On that occasion M'Lean left the club with a
friend, and walked home some ten yards behind Slater and another member. He saw
Slater enter the close in St. George's Road. Till then he had not known where
Slater lived.</p>

  <p>The divergent accounts of how Slater was occupied on Sunday, the 20th, we
have already noticed.</p>

  <p>Before considering the evidence relating to the eventful Monday, 21st
December, the day of the murder, it may be convenient to mention here the
statements of Cameron and Rattman as to Slater's ordinary habits and
appearance. Cameron said that he saw Slater frequently. Slater had no
occupation, and was seldom out until mid-day; he was a gambler, and frequented
the Motor, Sloper, and other clubs. He and Slater, when in company, filled in
the time by going to the skating rink in Victoria Road in the afternoons, to a
music hall in the evenings, and from thence to the Sloper Club, where cards
were played till well on in the morning. He never saw Slater dressed in check
trousers or light-coloured spats at any time during November or December. As a
rule, his clothes, with the exception of the waterproof, were dark. He had seen
him wearing a hat like production No. 44, but never saw him with a cloth hat
with a rim round it and without a split in the centre. He had seen him in the
cap produced, No. 46, but Slater generally wore a black bowler hat.</p>

  <p>Rattman said that he met Slater, while in Glasgow, almost daily, in
Gall's public-house and Johnston's billiard rooms during the day, and at
various clubs at night. He never saw Slater wearing light-check trousers or
light-coloured gaiters. Once or twice he had seen him in brown boots. He never
saw him with a Donegal hat, but had seen him wearing a cap with the sides up.
His clothes were generally dark or brown. When he last saw him, on Thursday,
24th December, Slater was wearing a dark suit and a bowler hat.</p>

  <p>On Monday, the 21st, according to the evidence of Antoine and Schmalz,
Slater received, by the morning post, two letters: one from his friend Rogers
in London (who was not called as a witness), saying Slater's wife was still
bothering him (Rogers) for money, the other from his partner Devoto in San
Francisco, asking Slater to join him. These letters were not produced. There
had been a previous letter from Devoto on the subject. In consequence of these
letters, Antoine said, Slater decided to go to San Francisco, which he had
intended doing since the beginning of the month. At 12.30 p.m. Slater called at
Liddell's pawnshop, and raised &pound;30 more upon the diamond brooch, making
&pound;60 in all. He also redeemed the gold purse, fountain pen, pearl studs,
and ring, which he had pawned on 17th November, paying &pound;6 4s. After
lunch, at two o'clock, Slater gave Schmalz notice, and said she could return to
London on the following Saturday. Schmalz overheard Slater and Antoine say they
were going to San Francisco. In the afternoon Slater offered the pawn ticket
for the brooch to a friend of the witness M'Lean, named Anderson, in the Sloper
Club. At 4.30 Slater came into Gall's public-house and offered the pawn ticket
for &pound;4 to Rattman, who had seen the brooch. Rattman refused, and
suggested that Aumann, who was present, should buy it; but the latter said the
pawnbroker had already advanced too much on it. Slater then left.</p>

  <p>At 5 p.m., as appears from the postmark on the envelope, a letter,
written by Slater, was posted to the Post Office Savings Bank, West Kensington,
London, asking that his money be sent at once, if possible by wire, as he had
an urgent call to America because his wife was ill. At 6.12 a telegram, in the
handwriting of Slater, was despatched from the Central Station, addressed to
Dent, London, in these terms&mdash;"If possible send watch at once."</p>

  <p>According to the evidence of Rattman and Aumann they, along with a third
man whom they did not know, were just finishing a game of three hundred up, in
Johnston's billiard rooms, Renfield Street, when Slater came in about 6.20.
Rattman asked him whether he had succeeded in selling the pawn ticket, and he
replied that he had not. Slater said he was going home to dinner; and on
Rattman observing that he was going later to the Palace Music Hall, Slater
remarked, "Very likely I will come and see you." Slater then left, having
remained for about ten minutes. The game was finished two or three minutes
after Slater's departure&mdash;Rattman says at 6.35; Aumann, at 6.40. Johnston,
the proprietor of the saloon, and Gibb, the marker, proved that the table, upon
which these men usually played, was engaged that day from 5.8 to 6.40. Johnston
had gone out for tea at the time, and Gibb did not recollect who were playing
there that afternoon. Neither Rattman nor Aumann could remember how Slater was
then dressed, but Rattman said he had a moustache about a quarter of an inch
long which, being dark, was quite noticeable. Rattman would never have taken
him for a clean-shaven man that day.</p>

  <p>Antoine and Schmalz swore that Slater dined at home that evening as usual
at seven o'clock. The murder, as we know, was committed between seven and ten
minutes past seven; and the man believed by Mrs. Liddell to be Slater was
standing at the railing in Queen's Terrace at five minutes to seven.</p>

  <p>About 9.45 that night the door bell of the Motor Club, 24 India Street,
rang, and on the witness Henderson (the clubmaster) opening the door, he found
Slater, who stepped into the hall. He was not a member of the club, but
Henderson knew him by sight, having twice seen him there with Cameron. Slater
asked Henderson if he had any money in the club, and said, "Give me what you
have and I will give you a cheque." Henderson replied that his committee did
not allow him to lend money, and suggested that Slater should go "next door"
(the Sloper Club), and ask Cameron for it. Remarking that Cameron was " no
use," Slater then left; he did not go into the club next door, but turned to
the right, to Elmbank Crescent. He was not in the hall for more than four or
five minutes. He had a short moustache "like stubble," and was wearing a
waterproof like that produced (No. 43), and a Donegal hat, of different colour
and make from hat No. 44. Henderson saw no discomposure about his dress; but he
seemed to be excited, and witness thought he had been losing money at cards
somewhere, and wanted to continue play. It will be remembered that at 12.30
that day Slater had received &pound;30 from Liddell on the brooch.</p>

  <p>With reference to the incident spoken to by Henderson, there was produced
at the trial a letter, written by Slater to his friend, Hugh Cameron in
Glasgow, on 2nd January, from the Tombs Prison, New York, a copy of which will
be found in the Appendix. He writes&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">I don't deney I have been in his [Henderson's] place
asking him for mony because I went brocke in the Sloper Club. He would not mind
to get me hangt, and I will try to prove that from a gambling point, I am right
to ask for some money. The dirty caracter was trying to make the police believe
I done the murder, was excitet, asking for mony to hop off.&mdash; I must have
a good lawyer, and after I can proof my innocents befor having a trial, because
I will prove with five people where I have been when the murder was
committed.</p>

  <p>On Tuesday, 22nd December, the day after the murder, Slater called at
four o'clock at Bryce's pawnshop, saw the witness Kempton, and redeemed a pair
of prism binocular glasses, which he had pledged on the 7th. He mentioned that
he was going to America, and asked witness about the Anchor Line. He was then
dressed in a dark overcoat and a hard hat, and had a slight, stubbly moustache.
On Tuesday or Wednesday, 22nd or 23rd December, Slater called at Bamber's shop
and was shaved by Nichols, who stated that Slater' told him he was going to
Queensland on the following Wednesday (the 30th). Slater said that his wife was
not going with him, as the weather was too cold, but she was to follow in the
summer. He showed no sign of excitement. On one or other of these dates Cameron
met Slater, who gave him the pawn ticket for the brooch, and asked him to
dispose of it among his friends for &pound;10. Cameron tried to sell the ticket
to two people, but was unsuccessful, and returned it to Slater.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday, 23rd, Slater received from the Glasgow branch of the Post
Office Savings Bank the amount standing at the credit of his account, &pound;39
18s. 3d. At 12.1 noon he despatched from Charing Cross Post Office a telegram
to Dent, London, in the following terms:&mdash;"Must have watch, leaving to-
morrow night for the Continent." Between four and five in the afternoon, Slater
called at Cooks' tourist office, Buchanan Street, saw the witness Bain, and
inquired for a second class two-berth cabin for himself and his wife by the
"Lusitania," from Liverpool, on Saturday, 26th. He gave his name and address as
"Oscar Slater, c/o Anderson, 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow." He was asked to
call back next day, when the agent should have heard from the Cunard Company,
with whom he was to communicate. That evening, between ten and eleven o'clock,
as Rattman and Aumann were playing billiards in Johnston's billiard rooms,
Slater and Cameron came in and sat watching the game. Johnston, the proprietor,
asked them if they wanted a game, but Slater said that they would not play that
night. His upper lip, said Johnston, was then a little dark, he had not much to
show, but he was not exactly clean shaven. Gibb, the marker, remembered seeing
Slater on this occasion, but not Cameron. Slater's moustache was, he said,
quite noticeable from the other end of the room, sixteen feet distant. He had
about a fortnight's growth on his upper lip; no one could have taken him for a
clean-shaven man. When the game was finished at 11.20, Slater, Cameron, and
Rattman left together, Cameron saying good-night to the others at the corner of
Cambridge Street and Sauchiehall Street, while Rattman went on with Slater, and
parted with him at his house in St. George's Road.</p>

  <p>On Thursday, 24th December, Slater received at the Glasgow branch of the
Post Office Savings Bank the proceeds of the 2&pound; per cent. Consols, which
had been sold on his instructions, the amount paid to him being &pound;49 7s.
2d. Rattman said that on this date he saw Slater for the last time before he
left. Slater asked him to come and see him in his house next day (Christmas
Day), but Rattman did not do so. Slater said nothing to him on this Thursday as
to his intention of sailing on the following Saturday. About four o'clock the
same afternoon Slater called at Cooks' office in Buchanan Street, and again saw
the witness Bain, who had heard from the Cunard Company offering room E76, at
&pound;12 rate, by the " Lusitania," sailing on Saturday, 26th December. Bain
showed Slater the room on the ship's plan, but the latter said he preferred an
outside cabin, and could do better in Liverpool. Bain said if he booked the one
offered then he could adjust matters in Liverpool, and Slater said he would
call back next day. He did not do so, and that day (Friday, 25th) Bain wrote to
the Cunard Company asking them to release the cabin, and to let him know if
"Mr. and Mrs. Slater" booked with them on Saturday.</p>

  <p>Cameron stated that shortly after four o'clock on Thursday, the 24th, at
the corner of Gordon Street and Renfield Street he met Slater, who said he was
looking for the Cunard Line shipping office, in Jamaica Street, to make inquiry
as to the sailings to America. Cameron accompanied him there; Slater went into
the Cunard office and got a pamphlet. When he came out he remarked to Cameron,
who had been waiting for him outside, that perhaps the "Campania," sailing on
Saturday week (2nd January, 1909), might suit him. He then asked Cameron to get
a Bank of England &pound;5 note for five Scotch &pound;1 notes, as he wanted
the note to send to his people in Germany, which he had done, he said, almost
every Christmas. Cameron having failed to get it in the Cunard office, they
tried the booking office at the Central Station, the Central Station Hotel, and
Forsyth's shop, all without success. Finally, at the Grosvenor Restaurant, they
got the note, which Slater enclosed in an addressed envelope, and registered at
Hope Street Post Office. Having had tea at Cranston's tea-rooms in Sauchiehall
Street, they parted shortly before six o'clock, Cameron arranging to call for
Slater after dinner. This was the last time Cameron saw him. That day Slater
had, as described by Cameron, "a very stubbly moustache," which was quite
noticeable. Cameron called at Slater's house as arranged about eight o'clock,
but was told by the servant Schmalz that he had gone out half an hour before
with a gentleman. As a matter of fact, Slater was in at the time, but had
instructed Schmalz to tell Cameron he was out.</p>

  <p>On the morning of Friday, 25th December, as stated by Antoine and
Schmalz, Slater received a postcard from Mrs. Freedman, who had come from
London in pursuance of an arrangement whereby she should take over the flat and
furniture, intimating her arrival at the Alexandra Hotel, Bath Street. Antoine
sent Schmalz to bring her to the house, and Mrs. Freedman came at 12.30 p.m.
She found Antoine crying; and Slater, who was busy packing his luggage,
explained the reason was that he would not take her with him. He asked and
obtained from Mrs. Freedman a loan of &pound;25. [It will be remembered that
Mrs. Freedman, who was not called as a witness, stated to Detective Lieutenant
Gordon, on 26th December, that she understood their destination to be Monte
Carlo.] Antoine said that Slater wanted her to go to her people in Paris, but,
in the end, he agreed to let her accompany him.</p>

  <p>Later in the day Slater called at Bamber's shop, and was shaved, for the
last time, by Nichols, according to whom he then had a moustache " a quarter of
an inch or five-sixteenths long." It had been growing for about ten days or a
fortnight. Slater told Nichols he was leaving Glasgow that night, and was
sailing next day by the "Lusitania." When Slater left the shop he removed the
shaving materials which he had previously deposited there for his own use.
During the last week of his visits Nichols observed no difference in his
appearance, except that he was wearing a peculiar vest. He had seen Slater in
various suits, and wearing a dark blue overcoat, but not a light fawn-coloured
overcoat.</p>

  <p>That afternoon (Christmas Day) the description of the supposed murderer,
given by the girl Barrowman, appeared, by the authority of the police, in the
two o'clock editions of the Glasgow evening newspapers&mdash; <i>Times</i>,
<i>News</i>, and <i>Citizen</i>.</p>

  <p>At 6 p.m. Slater again went out. Between six and seven o'clock John
Cameron, city porter, said that a man, whom he identified as Slater, spoke to
him at the Central Station, and told him to call at 69 St. George's Road for
some luggage "at the back of eight o'clock." He gave the name of "Anderson."
Along with another porter (Mackay) Cameron went to the house as directed, but,
by mistake, called first at the top flat instead of the third. At the latter he
saw the man who had engaged him, and two women. He removed ten articles of
luggage on his barrow to the Central Station for the 9.5 train for London and
Liverpool. Slater met him at the station and paid him. Cameron could not say
whether he was then clean shaven or not.</p>

  <p>Margaret and Isabella Fowlis, who lived in the flat above Slater, and
knew him by sight as "Anderson," remembered the porter calling at their door
for luggage. They told him that "Anderson" occupied the house below; and,
looking over the stairs while the luggage was being removed, saw Slater handing
it out. The time was about 8.30. Slater was then dressed in a blue overcoat, a
hat, and patent boots. They said he had no moustache. They were sure his upper
lip was clean shaven, because he looked up at them, and saw them watching him.
He left the house on foot, followed by the two women. Ruby Russell, a servant
in the same stair, also witnessed the removal of the luggage, and saw from her
window the departure of Slater, Antoine, and Schmalz. They walked a few yards
together, and Slater went away by himself. Antoine and Schmalz said that they
all walked together to Charing Cross, where they entered a cab and drove to the
Central Station.</p>

  <p>On arriving there at 8.45 the cab door was opened by James Tracey,
railway porter, who was waiting with the porter Cameron and the luggage. Slater
and the two women got out. Slater told Tracey to have the luggage labelled for
Liverpool by the 9.5 train; and, ""his having been done, Tracey, by order of
the guard, put it into the rear brake van. He did not know what tickets Slater
had. Only one of the two women travelled with him. Tracey said Slater that
night had a moustache. It was quite noticeable. He had no difficulty in
identifying Slater, but failed to recognise either Antoine or Schmalz. John
Brown, booking clerk, Central Station, said there were few people travelling by
that train, being Christmas night. Among the tickets which he issued by the 9.5
were two third class singles to London and two third class singles to
Liverpool. He recollected selling the two London tickets to a man with a slight
moustache, who was very like Slater, but he could not swear to it. The
Liverpool tickets, so far as he remembered, were issued separately to two
different persons. It was a regular practice to travel with a London ticket,
and break the journey at Liverpool.</p>

  <p>On 26th December, about 12.30 p.m., a man wearing a soft hat and a blue
overcoat entered the offices of the Cunard Company in Liverpool, saw John
Forsyth, manager of the second class department, and asked for accommodation
for a gentleman and his wife by the "Lusitania," sailing that day. Strangely
enough, Forsyth offered him room E76, the very cabin which Slater had refused
in Glasgow. The man said, "No, I do not like that, it is inside; it was offered
me by your agents in Glasgow." He appeared to regret having made the remark,
and said no more. He seemed, to witness, somewhat nervous, and, while he was
talking, looked at the door as if expecting some one. Forsyth asked him what he
required, and he replied that he wanted an outside room. After some discussion,
an outside cabin was agreed upon, and &pound;28 in Scotch notes paid for the
two tickets. Forsyth asked the man's name, and he said, "Otto Sando." He spelt
it, "S-a-n-d-o," remarking, "It is not Sandow, the strong man." He then filled
up the requisite application form, giving, inter alia, his destination and
American address as " Chicago, 30 Staate Street." Slater was undoubtedly the
man, and, said Forsyth, "he can recognise me, too."</p>

  <p>While in Liverpool Slater wrote from the London &amp; North-Western
Station Hotel a letter in German to his friend Rattman, a translation of which
will be found in the Appendix, giving as his reason for not saying good-bye,
his "absolutely suddenly" leaving Glasgow, "Freedman's girl" having taken over
his flat; and, further, stating, "My French girl leaves for Paris from here."
Their arrangements concluded, and the duties of friendship thus discharged,
"Mr. and Mrs. Otto Sando" sailed the same day in the "Lusitania" for New
York.</p>

  <p><a id="pic5" name="pic5"></a></p><br>

  <div align="center"><img src="1202631h-images/OscarSlater05.jpg" title="Head of
Hammer (duplicate) produced in Court"></div>

  <p>Whether or not Slater's departure from Glasgow was, in the words of the
Lord Advocate, "a flight from justice," or, as Mr. M'Clure put it, an act in
which "nothing suggesting subterfuge occurs until the tickets were taken at
Liverpool in the name of Otto Sando," was a question for the jury; and they
determined it against the prisoner. The explanation given by Antoine of
Slater's concealment of his destination was, in the first place, because of his
wife, and, secondly, in case of the landlord of the house and the furniture
company bothering, Mrs. Freedman about the flat. This does not, however,
explain why he failed to disclose the date of his departure to his intimate
friends Cameron and Rattman.</p>

  <p>Having recorded the facts with regard to Slater's behaviour, as disclosed
in the proof, we have now only to consider the purport of the medical evidence
adduced. It will be remembered that the police, when searching Slater's luggage
on his return from New York, found in one of his trunks a hammer, which he had
bought on 10th November, as before mentioned. With this weapon the Crown
undertook to prove that the murder had been committed. Professor Glaister
deponed that he did not find in the dining-room of 15 Queen's Terrace any
implement that looked as if it had been used for the purpose of murdering Miss
Gilchrist. He was clear, from the spattering of blood in the neighbourhood,
that the injuries had been produced practically at the point where the body was
found, within an area bounded by a radius of three feet from the head; and,
from his experience, his view was that the assailant knelt on the woman's
chest, and, kneeling upon the chest, struck violently at the head with the
implement that he employed. From the nature of the injuries inflicted witness
inferred that the weapon was not uniformly the same at the striking part; the
wounds were of different sizes and shapes, and the left eyeball, in a burst
condition, was driven into the brain. That indicated that the weapon must have
been of a pointed character, because a larger weapon, that would have been
likely to have caused the larger wounds, could not have entered the orbit. The
hammer, No. 47, could, in his opinion, in the hands of a strong man and
forcibly wielded (plus the kneeling on the chest), have produced the injuries
found on the body. That instrument accounted most easily for the different
classes of wounds, particularly the eye mischief. In cross-examination the
witness could not say positively that the hammer was used. His view of the
course of the assault was that the woman was on her feet, facing her assailant,
when she received a blow with something and was knocked down on the floor; the
assailant instantly pounced on her and knelt on her, fracturing her ribs and
breast bone during the act of the repeated blows; and that the instrument,
whatever it was, produced those frightful injuries upon her head and face. To
give a rough guess, judging from the wounds and the size of them, between
twenty and forty blows must have been inflicted, with almost lightning
rapidity. It must have been a furious, continuous assault before the assailant
rose to do anything further. The man who applied the violence in the way he
(witness) thought he did would have his clothing to a fairly large extent
bespattered with blood. His hands could not escape, nor the implement he
employed. It was one of the most brutally smashed heads witness had ever seen
in his experience.</p>

  <p>Dr. Hugh Galt, who, in conjunction with Professor Glaister, had made the
post-mortem examination, concurred. The number of blows struck must have been
very great, certainly not under fifty or sixty, probably a good many more. The
smashing in this case was most extensive. The hammer, No. 47, could produce the
injuries witness saw. In cross-examination witness admitted that, a priori, he
would have expected a heavier weapon. It was impossible to say exactly what
instrument had been employed; it was a weapon of some weight, and with sharp
edges. In reply to the judge, the injury to the eye was the only wound that
could not have been produced by a weapon of greater diameter than the hammer in
question.</p>

  <p>Professor Glaister also deponed to the result of his examination of the
four articles submitted to him as before mentioned, viz., (1) waterproof, (2)
hat, (3) hammer, and (4) auger. With regard to the waterproof, he found twenty
small stains, externally and internally, some of which, after treatment and on
microscopic examination, showed corpuscular bodies, resembling in general
appearances mammalian red blood corpuscles; but, by reason of the small amount
of material at disposal, confirmatory tests for blood could not be employed.
The stains appeared to have been subjected to the influence of water. No stains
were found upon the hat. The hammer, from the head to halfway down the shaft,
had the appearance of having been scrubbed, the surface of the wood being
roughened and bleached. Yellowish stains were found on both sides of the head
and on the flanges, which, on examination, showed corpuscular bodies,
resembling red blood corpuscles of the mammalian type. For the reason already
adduced, witness was unable to state positively that these were red blood
corpuscles. The auger, on examination, gave no indication of the presence of
blood. In cross-examination witness said that in his first report to the
police, dated 22nd December, it was stated, "On examination we found that
adhering to the metal of the instrument [the auger] were several grey hairs,
and, in addition, what seemed to be blood." Witness had examined twenty stains
in all on the waterproof, and only in some of them did he find the corpuscular
bodies referred to. He found no stains in the pockets of the waterproof.
Witness could not positively prove that any article found in the possession of
the accused contained blood. In reply to the judge, if it were not a case of
murder, but some commercial question, judging from his very long experience of
examination of such stains, witness would without hesitation say that, in his
view, to the best of his knowledge and belief, these were red blood
corpuscles.</p>

  <p>Professor Harvey Littlejohn, who, in conjunction with Professor Glaister,
had examined the articles, concurred.</p>

  <p>For the defence, Dr. W. G. Aitchison Robertson deponed that, looking to
the extent and multiplicity of the wounds, he considered the hammer produced a
very unlikely weapon. He had examined the hammer for blood stains, but found no
sign of blood about it, and he saw no appearance of the handle having been
washed or scraped. The man who committed the murder as described would, in the
opinion of witness, be more or less covered with blood. Witness had examined
the waterproof coat and found no signs of blood whatever upon it. In cross-
examination witness said that his evidence was given on the facts as disclosed
in Professor Glaister's report. The wound whereby the left eyeball was driven
in was 2 inches by &frac34; inch, which was much larger than the head of the
hammer. Witness thought a heavy poker or crowbar more likely to have produced
the injuries, by beating and thrusting with it. He could not see how the
spindle-shaped wounds could have been produced by the hammer. He made no tests
for the purpose of ascertaining the presence of blood.</p>

  <p>Dr. Alexander Veitch, who had also examined the hammer and coat, found
absolutely no appearance of blood. He considered the hammer produced an
unlikely instrument to inflict the injuries described; a blunt instrument, such
as a piece of railing, a crowbar, or a larger hammer, would be more likely. The
assailant could not escape getting a good deal of blood on his own person. Had
the hammer produced been used by the assailant, it would necessarily have had a
lot of blood about its head, and probably all over it. His hands would probably
be bloody, and witness would have expected to see some sign of that on the
lower part of the handle. There was no sign of scraping or scrubbing. In cross-
examination, witness had never seen a case where there was such an amount of
mauling. The weapon used would, in his opinion, be twice as large as the hammer
produced. Had the latter been used, he would have expected a class of fracture
which was not present, i.e., a depressed fracture, penetrating, and of
comparatively small size. He made no analysis of the stains found on either of
the articles.</p>

  <p>With reference to the failure of Drs. Aitchison Robertson and Veitch to
discover blood stains on the waterproof, it may be remarked that twenty-five
suspected portions had been cut out of it by Professor Glaister prior to its
being examined by them. It is also to be observed, as a point of interest, that
neither at the instance of the prosecution nor of the defence was the metal
head of the hammer removed from its soft white wood shaft. Had this been done
the question at issue would probably, to that extent at least, have been
settled.</p>

  <p>The condition of the hammer and waterproof was of vital importance to the
Crown case, for these were the only links between Slater and the murder. Apart
from them, nothing incriminating was found in his possession. In the seven
trunks belonging to him the police discovered neither Donegal hat, light-
coloured cloth overcoat, check trousers, fawn spats, nor brown boots. No proof
was offered that he had any knowledge of the existence of Miss Gilchrist or of
her jewels; none of the deceased's property was traced to him, and nothing
proved to be his was found in her house. With the exception of the disputable
stains on the waterproof, no article of clothing belonging to him was
bloodstained.</p>

  <p>In this connection it may be mentioned that both Antoine and Schmalz
swore that, so far as they knew, none of Slater's clothes were washed, burned,
or otherwise destroyed during their last week in Glasgow. With regard to the
hammer, they stated that it was solely used by Schmalz for breaking coals. It
was kept in the drawer of the hatstand in the hall&mdash;not, one would think,
the most convenient receptacle; it was never out of the house, and, to their
knowledge, was neither washed nor scraped. The Lord Advocate, with tact and
good taste, waived his right to cross-examine the girl Antoine, whose position
as a witness in the case was plainly indicated by Lord Guthrie in his charge to
the jury. Schmalz, however, was subjected to a trenchant cross-examination,
from which ordeal she emerged comparatively unscathed, either because she told
the truth and knew nothing to incriminate Slater, or because she was a match
for her learned adversary.</p>

  <p>A fact most damaging to the prisoner's character was elicited by the Lord
Advocate from the witness Schmalz. She admitted that Antoine, obviously with
Slater's concurrence, had led, both in London and Glasgow, an immoral life.
From the witness Cameron the Lord Advocate had already learned that Slater
supplemented his gains as a gambler by the proceeds of prostitution, and that,
in Lord Guthrie's striking phrase, "He had maintained himself by the ruin of
men and on the ruin of women, living for many years past in a way that many
blackguards would scorn to live." Of this fact the Lord Advocate made deadly
use in his address to the jury, going so far as to say that it removed the one
serious difficulty which confronted them&mdash;the difficulty of conceiving
that there was in existence a human being capable of doing such a dastardly
deed. " That difficulty removed," proceeded the learned Advocate, "I say,
without hesitation, that the man in the dock is capable of having committed
this dastardly outrage, and the question for you to consider is, whether or not
the evidence has brought it home to him." With reference to this point the
exception taken thereto by Mr. Speirs, the agent for the defence, in his
introductory note to the memorial prepared by him on the prisoner's behalf as
after mentioned, may be quoted&mdash;</p>

  <p>That evidence against his character was before the jury, and strongly
commented upon by the counsel for the prosecution; and while the jury was
afterwards told by the counsel for the prosecution and the presiding judge not
to allow the evidence against Slater's character to influence them against him,
there is a very strong general opinion to the effect that it must have
influenced the jury. As the accused did not plead good character, his character
should not, according to the law of Scotland, have been attacked.</p>

  <p>It must, however, be observed that no objection was taken by counsel for
the prisoner to any of the Lord Advocate's questions as to Slater's means of
livelihood. His false assumption of the designation of dentist made it clearly
competent for the Lord Advocate to ask the witnesses for the defence how the
prisoner maintained himself. If the defence desired to exclude the evidence
objected to in Mr. Speirs' memorial, they should not have examined either
Cameron or Schmalz.</p>

  <p>The case for the defence closed with the examination of the two medical
men, and, contrary to expectation, the prisoner did not avail himself of his
right to enter the witness-box. No reference to this fact was made either by
judge or counsel; but there can be little doubt that it told heavily against
him with the jury. His agent, in the memorial before referred to, with respect
to this circumstance, states&mdash;</p>

  <p>It is only fair to the prisoner to point out that he was all along
anxious to give evidence on his own behalf. He was advised by his counsel not
to do so, but not from any knowledge of guilt. He had undergone the strain of a
four days' trial. He speaks rather broken English&mdash;although quite
intelligibly&mdash; with a foreign accent, and he had been in custody since
January.</p>

  <p>Apart from this, however, the prisoner, in view of his manner of life,
might well have hesitated, for reasons best known to himself, to expose his
whole past career to the scrutiny of the Lord Advocate.</p>

  <p>The total number of witnesses examined at the trial was seventy-four,
sixty being called by the Crown, and fourteen by the defence.</p>

  <p>At eleven o'clock on the morning of the fourth day of the trial the Lord
Advocate rose to address the jury for the prosecution. To those who were
present his speech was, perhaps, the most impressive episode in this remarkable
case. Out of doors the day was one of brilliant spring sunshine; and past the
drawn blinds that screened the windows of the Courtroom there streamed three
shafts of light, one of which fell upon the strong features of the Lord
Advocate, as he stood in front of the dock, facing the jury. He used no
ornaments of rhetoric, made no impassioned appeal; but sternly, almost
relentlessly, marshalled, one by one, his facts and inferences, crushing the
while his handkerchief in his clenched right hand, as though it were a symbol
of the prisoner's fate. He spoke for an hour and fifty minutes; and the opinion
was generally expressed that no more masterly address had been delivered in
that place since the historic speech of the late Lord President Inglis, when,
as Dean of Faculty, he successfully defended Madeleine Smith. The impression
was heightened by the fact that the learned Advocate referred neither to notes
nor documents; but, by a gift of memory, in the circumstances little short of
marvellous, wove into a coherent pattern the complex web of the Crown case.
That he was convinced of the justice of his cause was manifest; but in one or
two points his argument would seem to go somewhat further than was warranted by
the evidence. It is noteworthy that the address contained no reference to the
witnesses Reid, Antoine, or Schmalz. In an early passage the promise, "We shall
see in the sequel how it was that the prisoner came to know that she [Miss
Gilchrist] was possessed of these jewels," appears rather to beg the question,
for upon that point no evidence whatever was led, nor did the speaker again
refer to it. With regard to the statement that " there is not a single human
being in this case who, having once seen the prisoner, has failed to know him
at once, so striking, so peculiarly distinctive is his face," it has to be
observed that the instances given of those who admittedly saw Slater, were of
persons who, though seeing him but once, all spoke to him and heard him speak.
Further, the Lord Advocate was mistaken in stating, which he did more than
once, as a reason for the prisoner hastening his departure, that Slater's name,
as well as the description given by Barrowman, appeared in the newspapers of
25th December. As a matter of fact, the name of Slater was first published in
the Glasgow Herald of 2nd January. On the conclusion of his address, the Lord
Advocate left the Court, to which he did not return.</p>

  <p>At half-past one Mr. M'Clure commenced his speech for the defence,
occupying exactly the same time as his learned opponent. His address obviously
suffered in comparison with that for the Crown, its chief concern being to
refute seriatim the arguments of the Lord Advocate. It would therefore be
unfair to contrast the speakers from the oratorical standpoint. Mr. M'Clure
opened with a strong protest against the newspaper campaign, of which, he said,
his client had been the victim, and referred to the prejudice created by the
false reports set afloat concerning the case. In view of what afterwards
happened, it is curious to note his warning to the jury, that, if they
convicted the prisoner, " there was no possibility of a commutation of the
capital penalty." While one may have difficulty in assenting to his
proposition, that, as regards the behaviour of Slater before and after the
murder, "in the main facts there is nothing suspicious," the skill with which
he analysed the evidence of the identifying witnesses, and made the most of the
many points telling in the prisoner's favour, is worthy of all praise. His
examination of the evidence was at once careful and exhaustive; and the case
for the defence was adequately presented. He called the jury's attention to the
fact that Slater was first suspected upon grounds, one of which was false, and
the other innocent, viz., because he had pawned a brooch which was supposed to
have belonged to Miss Gilchrist, and because, when he was looked for, it was
found that he had left Glasgow. Mr. M'Clure made effective use of the American
evidence, as showing the obvious inconsistencies of Lambie's testimony, and
satisfactorily disposed of the Crown theory that Slater fled as the result of
the description published in the newspapers. The excellent point, too, was made
that Slater, if he were, in fact, the watcher seen by the witnesses, had been
so careful as to destroy the clothes spoken to by them, while preserving the
very garment in which he did the deed. Upon the vexed question of the
murderer's moustache, the following summary was given:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The man wanted is alleged to have been clean shaven by Mrs. Liddell,
Helen Lambie, Barrowman, Adams, and Armour. It is, on the contrary, proved that
Slater had a moustache by Rattman, Aumann, Cameron, Reid, Nichols, the barber;
Gibb, the billiard man; Kempton, and Tracey.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, Mr. M'Clure made a legitimate and telling reference to the
notorious case of Adolf Beck, as showing the dangers attending evidence of
identity based on personal impressions.</p>

  <p>Lord Guthrie began his charge to the jury at five minutes to four
o'clock. His lordship suggested that the man who entered Miss Gilchrist's house
did so with the intention only to rob her of her jewels, and was not
contemplating murder. When she resisted, and attempted to raise an alarm by
knocking on the floor, then arose the necessity to silence her&mdash; "Dead men
(and dead women) tell no tales." His lordship then proceeded to explain to the
jury the nature and relative value of the evidence, direct and circumstantial.
He described the evidence with regard to the prisoner's character and financial
circumstances as double-edged; and told the jury that, if they decided to
convict him, they ought to be able to say they had disregarded it, and had
convicted him irrespective of it. Referring to the mystery, of which the
prisoner was the key, his lordship said that he never knew a case like the
present, either in his own experience or from reading. As to the question of
identification, his lordship held that it would be unsafe to convict on mere
evidence of personal impression of his identity on the part of strangers,
without reference to any marked personality or personal peculiarity. It was for
them to consider whether some of that evidence was not given by persons who had
an opportunity of familiarising themselves with the individual identified. One
fact, his lordship said, was quite clear&mdash;the prisoner resembled the
murderer. But it was to be kept in view that the witnesses to identification
were all Scotch, while the prisoner was patently a foreigner; therefore the
mere fact that a witness thought the prisoner the same as a man he had seen,
because both had a foreign appearance, went for very little, if it went for
anything at all. With these general observations, his lordship then proceeded
to review the evidence on this part of the case, and having done so,
observed&mdash;</p>

  <p>The questions for you are&mdash;and they are purely jury
questions&mdash;so far as identification is concerned, first, has the prisoner
such a marked personality, and had the witnesses Lambie, Adams, and Barrowman
such an opportunity to observe the man leaving Miss Gilchrist's house, and are
they sufficiently credible witnesses, to enable you to hold it proved that the
prisoner is the same man? Second, has the prisoner such a marked personality,
and had the eleven or twelve witnesses above referred to such opportunities for
seeing the man who haunted the street, as to enable you to hold it proved that
the prisoner was the same man&mdash; I assume &mdash; but again it is for you
to say &mdash; that there can be no reasonable doubt as to the identity of the
man haunting the street and the murderer. Lastly, is there corroboration, in
other parts of the evidence, of the personal impression given you by these
witnesses, assuming that they are strangers, and assuming that there is no such
marked personality or personal peculiarity as would add weight to the mere
personal impression?</p>

  <p>His lordship then examined the purely circumstantial evidence, and
commented on the fact that nothing was found in the prisoner's possession on
which the jury could rely as being connected necessarily with the murder. With
regard to the telegram said to have been despatched by Slater from the Central
Station at 6.12 on the night of the crime, there was no evidence that, although
it was in his handwriting, he personally handed it to the telegraph clerk.
[Curiously enough, there was no evidence even that it was in Slater's
handwriting.] The jury would consider whether, even accepting the evidence of
Aumann and Rattman, the prisoner had not plenty of time to walk from Johnston's
billiard rooms to West Princes Street and to arrive at the scene of the murder
by seven o'clock. With regard to the evidence of Antoine and Schmalz they would
also judge whether, in a disreputable house such as Slater's, they were,
without evidence, to credit the statement that hours were so punctual and so
regular that the inmates always dined at seven o'clock. As to the alleged
flight from Glasgow, his lordship did not think it could be suggested that
Slater was not intending at some time or other to go to America. It was for the
jury to say whether, in the circumstances they had heard detailed, there was a
hastening of that intention, which was suggestive, if it did not prove, that he
had a new and very serious motive for expediting his departure. His lordship
noted that Antoine, who must have known, was not asked by counsel for the
defence to say that the tickets were taken for Liverpool, and not for London.
After some observations on what constituted reasonable doubt, his lordship
concluded his impressive and impartial charge as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">Gentlemen, I suppose you all think that the prisoner
possibly is the murderer; you may very likely all think that he probably is the
murderer. That, however, will not entitle you to convict him. The Crown have
undertaken to prove, not that he is possibly or probably the murderer, but that
he is the murderer. That is the question you have to consider. If you think
there is no reasonable doubt about it, you will do your duty and convict him;
if you think there is, you will acquit him.</p>

  <p>The jury retired to consider their verdict at 4.55 p.m. Contrary to the
usual practice, the prisoner, it is understood by his own desire, did not leave
the dock to await their decision in the cells below the Court-room. It was
obvious from the demeanour of those in Court that a verdict adverse to the
accused was not at first expected; but as the time wore on, and the jury did
not return, this anticipation visibly decreased. The general restlessness
communicated itself to the prisoner, until the ringing of the jury bell at 6.5,
announcing that his fate had been decided, was succeeded by intense silence.
The jury, having returned to the box, and Lord Guthrie having taken his seat,
the foreman, in reply to the Clerk of Justiciary, announced their verdict as
follows:&mdash;"The jury, by a majority, find the panel guilty of murder as
libelled." Mr. Morison, K.C., in the absence of the Lord Advocate, then
formally moved for sentence.</p>

  <p>It is not too much to say that the verdict came with a shock of surprise
to most of the auditors in the crowded Court-room. Upon none, however, did the
blow fall with such fearful effect as on the man in the dock. He had been, it
appears, throughout the trial, confident of acquittal, and had borne himself
from day to day with inflexible composure. The recording of the verdict and
sentence, which followed upon the jury's finding, occupied an actual seven
minutes; but the tense stillness, broken only by the sound of the official pen,
seemed interminable. It proved too much for the prisoner's iron nerve. He rose
in the dock, and, labouring under strong emotion, made an incoherent effort to
address the judge. Lord Guthrie informed Mr. M'Clure that he should advise the
prisoner to reserve anything he had to say for the Crown authorities; but
Slater commenced another hysterical appeal, which his lordship mercifully
terminated by pronouncing the inevitable sentence, adjudging the prisoner to be
hanged in Glasgow on 27th May. A scene more painful it is fortunately the lot
of few to witness, and none who did so on this occasion is likely to forget it.
The prisoner was then removed, and the Court rose.</p>

  <p>It is satisfactory to note that, as the result of what occurred upon this
trial, an Act of Adjournal was passed on 1st June, 1909, abolishing the
unnecessary and cruel delay between the declaration of a verdict of guilty and
the pronouncing of the capital sentence. A copy of the Act of Adjournal will be
found in the Appendix.</p>

  <p>The votes of the fifteen jurymen were, it is understood, given as
follows:&mdash;Nine for "guilty," five for "not proven," and one for "not
guilty." It is noteworthy that, had two of the majority voted differently,
Slater would have been set free.</p>

  <p>In England, of course, a conviction in such circumstances could not have
been obtained, and a new trial would have resulted.</p>

  <p>On the night of the last day of the trial, Thursday, 6th May, it was
stated in the Press that the prisoner, on being taken to the cells below the
dock, exclaimed to the detectives, "I am not the only guilty party"; but this
alleged confession was afterwards emphatically denied by Mr. Speirs, the agent
for the defence, in a letter to the newspapers.</p>

  <p>The verdict was variously received by the Press. One newspaper stated
that, at the conclusion of Lord Guthrie's charge, it appeared impossible for
the prisoner to escape; while another, taking exactly the opposite view,
declared that the judge's summing up made it impossible for the jury to
convict! Perhaps the more general view was that a verdict of "not proven"
would, in the circumstances, have been a safer finding. Arrangements were made
forthwith for the presentation of a public petition for commutation of the
death sentence, to be forwarded to the Secretary of State for Scotland, the
grounds being (1) that the evidence led against the prisoner was insufficient
to justify the jury finding him guilty of the charge, there being, in the
petitioners' opinion, insufficient evidence to identify the prisoner with the
murderer; and (2) that the question of the prisoner's immoral character was
brought before the jury and, in the petitioners' view, must have influenced
their judgment. This was duly prepared, and having been signed, it is stated,
by over twenty thousand members of the public, was forwarded to the Scottish
Secretary, Lord Pentland, together with a memorial in Slater's behalf prepared
by Mr. Speirs, on Monday, 17th May, ten days before the date fixed for the
execution. A copy of this memorial, which ably embodies in lucid and succinct
form, the arguments on the evidence against the verdict, will be found in the
Appendix. With the exception of the statement of Agnes Brown, to which we have
before referred, no new facts are given; nor does the memorial contain any
further information regarding Slater's movements on the night of the crime. If,
as is alleged in the memorial, the prisoner " was all along anxious to give
evidence on his own behalf," and only refrained from entering the witness-box
on his counsel's advice, it is difficult to understand why, when he had an
opportunity of telling his own story to the Scottish Secretary, his lips
remained sealed.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile the "campaign" in the Press, against which Mr. M'Clure had
protested at the trial as prejudicial to his client, was conducted more
vigorously than ever; but on this occasion in favour of the condemned man. To
such lengths was this crusade of sentiment carried, that one respectable
Glasgow journal actually despatched an emissary to an obscure mining village in
Upper Silesia, for the purpose of interviewing the convict's parents; and for
some days improved its readers with anecdotes of "Oscar's Youth," and harrowing
accounts of "How the News of the Verdict Reached Them," and "The Mother's
Judgment: 'If he has done that he deserves to die.'"</p>

  <p>As time went on, and no word reached Glasgow from London, the authorities
proceeded with the necessary arrangements for carrying out the sentence on 27th
May. Not till seven o'clock on the evening of the 25th was the following
telegram received from the Scottish Office:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">To the Lord Provost of Glasgow, City Chambers,
Glasgow.&mdash;Case of Oscar Slater. Execution of sentence of death is respited
until further signification of His Majesty's pleasure.</p>

  <p class="quote">UNDER-SECRETARY FOR SCOTLAND.</p>

  <p>The news was at once communicated by the magistrates to the prisoner in
the condemned cell. The next morning the Lord Provost received the following
letter in confirmation:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">Scottish Office, Whitehall, May 25th, 1909.</p>

  <p class="letter">My Lord Provost,&mdash;<br>
  I am to signify to you the King's command that the execution of the sentence
of death passed on Oscar Slater, presently in His Majesty's prison at Duke
Street, Glasgow, be respited with a view to its commutation to penal servitude
for life.&mdash;I am, my Lord Provost, your obedient servant,<br>
  PENTLAND.</p>

  <p class="letter">The Hon. the Lord Provost of Glasgow, City Chambers,
Glasgow.</p>

  <p>It is understood that Lord Pentland, in arriving at his decision, had the
assistance of the Lord Chancellor and Mr. Muldane, Minister for War; and that
Lord Guthrie, as the judge presiding at the trial, was also consulted. On 8th
June the following questions with reference to the respite were asked in the
House of Commons:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">Sir J. H. Dalziel (L., Kirkcaldy Burghs) asked the Lord
Advocate whether he would state the grounds on which he advised that the
extreme penalty of the law should not be carried out in the case of Oscar
Slater, convicted of murder, and now detained in Glasgow prison, and on what
grounds the said prisoner was now detained in custody.</p>

  <p class="quote">The Lord Advocate (Mr. Ure)&mdash;The Lord Advocate does
not advise the Crown in regard to the exercise of the prerogative of mercy, and
it would be contrary to practice to state the grounds on which the prerogative
of mercy is exercised in any particular case. Oscar Slater is detained in
custody on the ground that he has been convicted of the crime of murder.</p>

  <p class="quote">Sir J. H. Dalziel&mdash;Was the Secretary for Scotland in
possession of the right hon. gentleman's views before any decision was taken
with regard to the matter? and, further, if Slater is detained in custody for
the crime of murder, why was he not called upon to suffer the extreme penalty
for this brutal crime?</p>

  <p class="quote">The Lord Advocate&mdash;The Secretary for Scotland was in
possession of my views before the decision was taken; but I think the House
will agree that it is entirely contrary to practice and to public policy to
state the grounds on which the Secretary for Scotland exercised the-
prerogative of mercy.</p>

  <p class="quote">Sir J. H. Dalziel&mdash;Are we to understand from that, the
view of the Government is that Oscar Slater was guilty of this brutal crime?</p>

  <p class="quote">The Lord Advocate&mdash;I am afraid that is only asking in
another form a question which I have declined to answer.</p>

  <p>On 8th July, Slater, along with seven other convicts, was removed from
Duke Street Prison, Glasgow, to the Convict Prison at Peterhead, there to
undergo his commuted sentence of penal servitude for life.</p>

  <p>The reward of &pound;200, offered by the Crown authorities for
information which would lead to a conviction, was ultimately apportioned as
follows:&mdash;Mary Barrowman, &pound;100; John Forsyth, &pound;40; Allan
M'Lean, &pound;40; and Gordon Henderson, &pound;20, all of whom were witnesses
at the trial.</p>

  <p>Of the many mysteries which the four days' inquiry failed to elucidate
two remained not only unsolved, but, as regards one of them, even
unnoticed&mdash;(1) How did Slater (or the murderer) acquire his knowledge of
the existence of Miss Gilchrist's jewels? and (2) by what means did he obtain
entrance to her house?</p>

  <p>As regards the first point, the witness Mrs. Walker, a former servant,
was asked if Miss Gilchrist's jewels formed a subject of conversation in the
neighbourhood, but she stated that she had only heard it remarked among the
tradespeople that her mistress was well dressed and wore some jewellery. Lambie
swore that, so far as she knew, no one in the neighbourhood was aware of the
existence of the jewels except a girl friend of hers, whom she had informed of
the fact; and that she had also mentioned the matter to her admirer, Nugent, a
year before the murder. These are the only references to the subject which the
evidence contains. The members of the Adams family, who had resided in the hue
house below for many years, were not asked, when examined, if any report of the
old lady's jewels had reached them.</p>

  <p>With regard to the second point, no reference to it was made by either of
the counsel or by the presiding judge. No doubt exists of the fact that the
murderer did somehow obtain access to the house; but the manner of his entrance
was not alluded to. It is clear that he did not do so by the windows, for
these, as we have seen, were, with the exception of the kitchen window, all
fastened when Lambie went out, and were in tile same condition when she
returned. The height of the flat from the ground, in the absence of a ladder,
further precludes this theory. That the murderer was not concealed in the stair
leading to the empty house above, but entered from the street after Lambie's
departure, is also indicated by the wet footmarks noticed by her on the lower
steps of the stair, to which attention has been drawn. If the evidence of
Lambie be accepted, there is no question that both the house and close doors
were securely closed when she left, and could only be opened either by keys
from without or by Miss Gilchrist from within. The conjecture that the murderer
used false keys is unlikely; the close door could, no doubt, be readily opened
either by a knife or a common latch-key, but the house door, as we have seen,
was guarded by two separate patent locks which required two different keys. The
murderer, therefore, probably rang the street door bell. Mr. Adams stated that
he generally, but not invariably, heard Miss Gilchrist's bell when rung; he did
riot do so that night.</p>

  <p>It is in evidence that Miss Gilchrist was apprehensive of attacks upon
her property, and it seems, at first sight, unlikely that she would voluntarily
admit a stranger, or would not, at least, have opened the door upon the chain,
till she had ascertained his business. But, as she kept only one servant, she
must frequently (as on the servant's night out) have had occasion to answer the
door herself, being alone in the house. No question was put to Lambie as to her
mistress's practice in this regard, nor was she asked if, when she went upon
her nightly errand for the paper, she had not, on some former occasions,
forgotten to take the keys.</p>

  <p>Assuming that this had happened before, it is possible that the murderer
(who had presumably studied the habits of the inmates), being on the watch in
one of the adjacent closes, rang the street bell immediately after Lambie left
the house. The close door is opened by raising a handle within the hall, just
outside the dining-room door. The old lady, thinking that Lambie had forgotten
the keys, may have removed her spectacles, laid them (as they were found)
beside her magazine, and, rising from her chair, have gone to the hall and
lifted the handle. She may then have opened the house door, and at once have
returned to the dining-room, the door of which immediately adjoins, and is at
right angles to, the front door in the hall. That she did so is more probable
than that she waited at the door to see if it were Lambie, as, even if the
difference of tread did not apprise her that it was not the maid, she could
have seen a stranger coming up the stairs in time to close the door.</p>

  <p>That no struggle occurred in the hall or in the dining-room, and that
Miss Gilchrist was felled as she stood on the hearth rug, near her chair, would
appear for three reasons&mdash;(1) There was no indication of such in the
position of the furniture of either the hall or dining-room; (2) the first
sound heard by the Adams family was the fall of a heavy body; and (3) the
evidence of Professor Glaister proves that the deed was done on the spot where
the body was found.</p>

  <p>It is therefore likely, in view of the medical evidence, that the old
lady had regained her chair, when she realised that the footsteps approaching
were not those of Lambie. She turned, and took a step or two towards the door
as the murderer entered the room. With one swift blow she was struck down, her
head crashing against the lid of the coal scuttle (which, we know, was broken
and bloody) on the right hand side of the fireplace; she rolled or was dragged
on to the hearth rug; and, voluntarily or involuntarily, gave, probably with
her heels, the three knocks upon the floor. Her assailant may then, furious at
what he perceived to be a signal for help, have snatched up the skin rug, which
lay in front of the sideboard, and using it partly to stifle her cries, partly
as a screen for himself, have, kneeling upon her chest, completed his ghastly
task.</p>

  <p>The meaningless ferocity of the assault may have been due to the fury of
fear; for it is to be remembered that, early in the attack, the three " rude
rings " of Mr. Adams rang through the house. That these gave the murderer pause
is shown by Mr. Adams' statement that he "had been standing at the door for
half a minute or so" before he heard the gruesome sound which he described. On
his second visit to the door, two or three minutes later, the sounds had
ceased; the murderer was then in the bedroom.</p>

  <p>Apart from such hypotheses, one fact, however, is clearly proved: the
murderer's hands were clean. The deed done, he hurried to the bedroom. The
match-box he had brought with him, the match he struck, the gas bracket he
lighted, the box he broke open, the papers therein which he scattered on the
floor, the glass dish on the toilet table from which he took the brooch, each
handled by him in turn, were all free from blood. It is remarkable that, if the
murderer knew nothing of the house, he made straight for the spare bedroom in
which the jewels were kept, passing the door of Miss Gilchrist's bedroom on his
way, and entering, as appears, none of the other rooms. He was certainly in the
house for less than ten minutes, yet had time not only to deliver the
blows&mdash;" not under fifty or sixty, probably a good many more "&mdash;which
silenced his victim, but to ascertain in which of the six apartments the jewels
were secreted, to light the gas, to open and examine the contents of the box,
to secure the brooch, and to walk leisurely past Lambie and Adams, so soon as
they unlocked the door.</p>

  <p>The question of time brings us to the consideration of another point. The
murder, according to the Lord Advocate's theory, was committed by a man who had
thoroughly familiarised himself with the movements and habits of the inmates by
"careful, prolonged, and steady watching with a skilled eye." That being so,
why did he select for his purpose the shorter period of the maid's nightly
errand to the newsagent's (which, she said, never exceeded ten minutes), rather
than her necessarily longer absence for the messages later in the evening, or,
better still, her weekly night out? It may be that he had already attempted to
gain admission to the house on one or other of these occasions, but found that
Miss Gilchrist would not then open the door. Even assuming that his original
design was robbery, and did not embrace the possibility of incidental murder,
he must have expected that to obtain the jewels would require a search, more or
less protracted, during which their owner might raise the alarm, unless,
indeed, he thought she would give them up at once. But, with deference to the
suggestion of the learned judge upon this point, it may -well be that not only
did the intruder contemplate the murder of Miss Gilchrist from the first, but
chose his time with reference to the maid's short absence; so that, had she
returned, as usual, alone, she might have shared the fate of her mistress, thus
leaving him free to search the premises at his leisure.</p>

  <p>In this connection mention may be made of the case of John Paul Foster,
recorded by Feuerbach, the eminent jurist, in his admirable studies of German
criminal trials,* which presents some striking points of resemblance to the
present case.</p>

  <p>*<i>Narratives of Remarkable Criminal Trials</i> Translated from the
German of Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach by Lady Duff Gordon. London: John Murray,
1846.</p>

  <p>This miscreant was, on 22nd July, 1821, convicted of the murder of
Christopher Baumler, a corn chandler of N&uuml;rnberg, and his maid-servant,
Anna Katherina Schutz, in the following circumstances:&mdash;Baumler, who was
reputed a wealthy man, lived above his shop, the only other occupant of the
house being the servant, a girl of twenty-three. His ordinary business
included the right of selling brandy. On the night of 20th September, certain
citizens who had been drinking in the shop left together at nine o'clock,
leaving there one customer, a stranger to them, drinking by himself. The shop
was usually closed at 11 p.m. At 9.45, the maid called at the baker's, "a
hundred steps" distant, and purchased two rolls. This errand could not have
occupied above five minutes. About the same hour, an opposite neighbour
noticed, to his surprise, that Baumler's shop was closed. Next morning, as the
shop remained shut after its usual hour, the neighbours effected an entrance by
an upper window, when it was found that the whole house had been ransacked, and
two bags of money, as well as some clothing, stolen. In the parlour, behind the
shop, the corpse of Baumler was discovered lying on its back between the stove
and the table, beside the stool upon which he had sat. smoking his pipe; while
behind the shop door lay the dead body of the maid, with the two rolls beside
her. The injuries inflicted upon the old man and the girl were identical, and,
by a strange coincidence, closely resemble those disclosed on the post-mortem
examination in the present case. Both heads had been shattered, in the opinion
of the surgeons, "with a heavy instrument, having a flat surface, with sharp
edges, probably the back of a hatchet." In each case the sternum and ribs were
fractured, it was thought by stamping on the bodies. At the trial it was proved
that Foster had been seen, for several days before the murder, walking about
the street in a suspicious manner, watching the house; he was identified as the
man who had outstayed the other customers, one of whom had spoken to him
casually, and it is instructive to note that the witnesses, who identified him,
described him as wearing a blue coat, when, in fact, its colour was brown. The
brown great-coat which he wore on the night of the murder and had disposed of,
was recovered, "much stained and in some places soaked with blood"; an axe,
bearing unequivocal traces of the deed, was found concealed in his house; and,
finally, some of his victim's property was traced to his possession. Having
studied the habits of the household, Foster had entered the shop and ordered a
glass of brandy. Immediately upon the maid's departure, he had, in the parlour,
felled Baumler with the axe, which he carried hidden under his great-coat,
closed the shop, lay in wait for the girl behind the street door, opened it for
her, end attacked her as she returned from her errand. In spite of the strong
circumstantial evidence adduced against him, Foster escaped capital punishment
for the singular reasons that there were no eye-witnesses to the murder, and
that no confession could be extorted from him! He was accordingly condemned to
imprisonment in chains for life.</p>

  <p>The statement of Agnes Brown before referred to raises the additional
question, was the murder and robbery at 15 Queen's Terrace the work of a single
hand? This question is also suggested by the evidence led at the trial. For
instance, the man seen by Mrs. Liddell at five minutes to seven, standing at
the railings outside the house, and minutely described by her, was obviously a
man quite differently dressed from the man seen and described by Lambie, Adams,
and Barrowman. It would be unprofitable to pursue the surmise that the murderer
had an accomplice further than to remark that, if he had, and one of somewhat
similar appearance to himself, it might go far to reconcile the otherwise
conflicting testimony of the witnesses who describe the watcher and the man
leaving the house. That the man seen by Lambie, Adams, and Barrowman bore no
visible traces of blood is certain; and it is conceivable that the actual
murderer had made his escape between Mr. Adams' visits to the door, while his
more callous associate lingered to secure the jewels.</p>

  <p>It appears from the evidence of all the medical witnesses that the
murderer, using the short hammer as alleged by the Crown, would be more or less
bloodstained. Upon this point the theory of Dr. John Adams, 1 Queen's Crescent,
the first medical man to see the body, but who was not called as a witness at
the trial, is of interest. Dr. Adams, it is understood, had, when returning
home at about 11 p.m. from his professional duties, observed, on six or eight
occasions shortly before the murder, a man hanging about the corner of Queen's
Crescent, outside his own house. The man walked with a slouching, rolling gait,
and had his hands in the pockets of a fawn-coloured overcoat. Dr. Adams
mentioned the matter, some time before the murder, to the policeman on the
beat, who said that he had not seen the man. It will be remembered that Dr.
Adams was summoned by Mr. Arthur Adams immediately after the discovery of the
murder, and visited the scene of the crime at 7.20 or 7.25. He found Miss
Gilchrist lying on her back on the hearth rug, with the skin rug across her
face. Close to the head, and facing it, stood an ordinary chair. Having
examined the body and ascertained that life was extinct, Dr. Adams' attention
was attracted by the condition of this chair. He observed that the left back
leg, furthest from the head, was soaked with blood, and that the inner aspect
of each front leg was spotted with blood. The back leg, in his opinion, had
evidently been in contact with the wounds. With this instrument, in his view,
the injuries to the head had been inflicted. In addition to the appearance of
the chair, he inferred that it had been so used from the character of the
injuries, the comparatively small quantity of blood near the head, and the
restricted area of the blood stains. In the opinion of Dr. Adams the assault
was committed by a few heavy, swinging blows from the back leg of this chair,
the assailant, while wielding it, stamping upon the body, and thereby
fracturing the ribs. The hands of the assailant would thus be clean, and the
seat of the chair would be interposed between his person and the spurting blood
at the moment of impact. With reference to the condition of the chair, it is to
be kept in view that the locus was not inspected by Professor Glaister and Dr.
Galt until the following day, when the appearance it presented may not then
have been marked.</p>

  <p>We may close our account of the salient features of this mysterious and
perplexing case by quoting the dictum of Lord Collins from the Report of the
Royal Commission appointed in 1904 to inquire into the affair of Adolf Beck,
prevising that no parallel between the two cases is here suggested. His
lordship observed&mdash;"Evidence as to identity based on personal impressions,
however bona fide, is perhaps of all classes of evidence the least to be relied
upon, and therefore, unless supported by other facts, an unsafe basis for the
verdict of a jury."</p>

  <p>Of consent of parties, the Court appointed the evidence to be taken down
in shorthand, and appointed Messrs. Harry Hodge, Robert Hislop, and Thomas
Cowan, 8 North Bank Street, Edinburgh, to take the said evidence in shorthand,
and the declaration <i>de fideli</i> was administered to each of them.</p>

  <p>The trial then proceeded.</p>

  <h2><a id="eviP1" name="eviP1">EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION.</a></h2>

  <p>ROBERT WILLIAM HORNE, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Proved two
plans made by him, one of Miss Gilchrist's house, 15 Queen's Terrace, and one
of West Princes Street, and adjacent streets, being respectively Nos. 6 and 7
of the productions for the Crown.</p><br>

  <p>GEORGE BELL, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Proved eight
photographs of the late Miss Gilchrist's house and of part of West Princes
Street, being No. 5 of the productions for the Crown.</p><br>

  <p>DAVID DICK, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I made an inventory and
valuation of the household furniture, electro-plate, and jewellery at the late
Miss Gilchrist's house. No. 22 of the productions is the inventory and
valuation which I made. I found jewellery in the house to the value of
&pound;1382 12s. If bought in shops they would cost at least twice as much. We
found jewels scattered all over the wardrobe; some were laid between dresses,
and some were in an old, detachable pocket with a string on it for tying round
the waist. I made a very careful examination for a brooch which I was told was
missing. I am quite satisfied that it was not in the house. I was shown a
sketch of that brooch. The brooch was shaped like a horse-shoe, crescent-
shaped, with a double row of diamonds. Judging from the sketch the value would
be between &pound;40 and &pound;50.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Have you not made a mistake? You
were shown a sketch of the stolen brooch. Has not that a single row of
diamonds? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And not a double row? &mdash; That is so. I have made a mistake.</p>

  <p>You never heard in connection with this case of any double row of
diamonds brooch? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>No one was searching for that at all? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>The missing brooch was one with a single row of diamonds? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And none such has been found? &mdash; No.</p><br>

  <p>WILLIAM SORLET, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a partner of
the firm of R. &amp; W. Sorley, jewellers, Glasgow. I knew the late Miss
Gilchrist. She had been a customer of my firm for about twenty years or more.
About the beginning of January a detective called at my firm's premises and
asked if I could give a sketch of a diamond crescent brooch which I knew that
Miss Gilchrist had possessed. I then cut from one of our catalogues a print of
a brooch of a similar kind and gave it to the officer. No. 24 of the
productions is the sketch that I cut out. I later on furnished a sketch of the
brooch. The last occasion on which that brooch was in my possession was in
March, 1908, when we had it for cleaning. So far as I am aware that was the
only diamond crescent brooch that she had.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; How long after 21st December, the
date of this murder, was it that the police first made inquiries at you
regarding brooches? &mdash; I think it would be early in January.</p>

  <p>Did the police produce to you a diamond crescent brooch and ask you to
identify it if you could? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How many rows of diamonds had the brooch the police produced to you?
&mdash; Three rows.</p>

  <p>Were you informed then that it was one which had been pawned by Slater?
&mdash; I think I was.</p>

  <p>Do you know when it had been pawned? &mdash; No, I did not.</p>

  <p>It was no brooch of Miss Gilchrist's at all? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you know that it had been lying in the pawnbroker's shop for two
months before the murder? &mdash; No, I did not.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Did you at once tell the police
that that was not her brooch? &mdash; I told the officers that were there with
the brooch that it was not her brooch.</p><br>

  <p>Mrs. JANE DUFF or WALKER, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I knew
the late Miss Gilchrist well. I had been a servant with her for about five
years. I left about eight years ago or more. I visited Miss Gilchrist several
times after I left her service. She was not accustomed to wear her jewels
always; she always wore some jewellery, but she had special ones for special
occasions. She was quite well known in the locality round about where she
lived. She had lived there for about thirty years. I could not say whether it
was known that she had a great deal of jewellery. I never spoke much about it
to any one. I found in talking to other people that that was known, but the
information did not come through me. She had not very many friends visiting
her. She had very few men friends. I am not quite sure about the last time that
I visited her, but it was towards the end of October, 1908. I recollect her
saying something about the house above being empty. She said occasionally that
it was much nicer to have the people away, as the stair was always clean, and
then she said that she would rather have these people there than be alone, as
it was too quiet. That was all I remember her saying about that. Before that
time she spoke to me about an arrangement she had made with her neighbour, Mr.
Adams, downstairs. She told me that she had arranged with Mr. Adams that when
she was left alone if she wanted him she would knock down to him. Mr. Adams'
sitting-room was below her dining-room. The old lady was afraid of her house
being broken into. She was never afraid of any one doing any personal injury to
her, but she had a great fear of the house being broken into. I do not know why
that was, but perhaps she felt that she was an old lady, and she was always
very careful to leave the place in charge of the policeman when the house was
shut up.</p>

  <p>Do you think that the jewels had anything to do with it? &mdash; They
were never in the house when she was away. They were always left with Mr.
Sorley when we went to the coast or the country. When we were at home she took
the jewels out for a special occasion, and they usually remained in the house
till we went away again. She kept them in a small box in the wardrobe. They
were all kept in the one box. She was a lady of about eighty-three years of
age, I think.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Were you told that she had
jewellery to the value of &pound;1383, or what would cost about twice that to
buy? &mdash; I cannot tell you that, because I do not know the value of
jewellery.</p>

  <p>Did she keep all that stuff in her house? &mdash; She had it in the box,
and it was kept there till we went to the coast, and then she put it into Mr.
Sorley's hands.</p>

  <p>How long had the girl Nellie Lambie been there in December last? &mdash;
Three years.</p>

  <p>Have there been a great many rumours in connection with this case?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Have you heard that Miss Gilchrist was a resetter? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>She was not? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did she have unset stones in the house? &mdash; I never saw them.</p>

  <p>You have heard that rumour also? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Have you heard that she was the mother of Nellie Lambie? &mdash; No, I
did not hear that, but I heard that she was the mother of Mrs. Ferguson.</p>

  <p>Did you hear that she was the mother of Slater? &mdash; No, I did not
hear that.</p>

  <p>In point of act, Nellie Lambie was twenty-one years of age, and the old
lady was over eighty? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You said that from conversation with people in the neighbourhood you
thought that they were aware that she had a lot of jewellery? &mdash; It has
been sometimes remarked to me in shops when I was shopping.</p>

  <p>What was said? &mdash; I cannot remember the words exactly, except that
Miss Gilchrist dressed very well and wore some jewellery &mdash; it is a long
time since.</p>

  <p>Did she wear anything except a brooch and a couple of bracelets? &mdash;
Not every day, except that and three rings.</p>

  <p>And she wore gloves? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>So that the visible jewellery that this lady would carry would be two
bracelets? &mdash; Yes; she was particular that her jewellery was not
visible.</p>

  <p>What leads you to say that there was a rumour that she was a wealthy
lady? &mdash; I do not think it was a very special remark, further than the
people speaking to me in the shop that she dressed well. That was all.</p>

  <p>Did you ever tell people outside that she was a lady possessed of a great
deal of jewellery? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>And you never heard that said outside? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>It was only that she was a well-dressed lady? &mdash; Yes, and wore
jewellery.</p>

  <p>She must have kept herself pretty much aloof from her neighbours? &mdash;
Yes, she did.</p>

  <p>Did you have many visitors when you were there? &mdash; A few.</p>

  <p>Did Miss Gilchrist lay down any rules about your visitors? &mdash; No,
not particularly. She did not like me to have too many visitors, but she always
allowed me visitors.</p>

  <p>Did you have a night out? &mdash; Yes, Thursday night.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether Nellie Lambie had the same night out? &mdash; I think
she told me that it was Wednesday night, but I am not sure, and I could not
say.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Was that case in which the jewels were kept in the
wardrobe locked? &mdash; The wardrobe and the case were always locked.</p>

  <p>Who kept the keys? &mdash; She always carried the keys in her pocket.</p>

  <p>Did she ever give you the keys? &mdash; Never, except when she sent me to
open the case.</p>

  <p>Did she live comfortably in the way of food and anything else? &mdash;
Not extravagantly. She was comfortable, but not extravagant.</p>

  <p>What wages did you get? &mdash; &pound;12 when I went, and &pound;16 when
I left.</p><br>

  <p>JOHN SINCLAIR MARR, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a house
factor in Glasgow. In the beginning of November last I had a telephone message
from Stuart &amp; Stuart, in St. George's Road, that a man was inquiring about
a house to let in Woodlands Road. I telephoned to Stuart &amp; Stuart that I
had a house to let at 69 St. George's Road on the third floor, and on that day,
or on the following day, I had a call from a man, who gave me a visiting card.
(Shown production No. 34.) That is the card he gave me. The words "A. Anderson,
dentist, 36 Albemarle Street, Piccadilly." were printed on the card, and the
words "136 Renfrew Street, 2 up," were in pencil. He told me that his purpose
was to start business with some one else as a dentist in Glasgow. He agreed to
take the house. I asked him for references, and he noted the names which he
gave me on the back of his calling card. On the same day I wrote to the persons
whose addresses he gave me, and I received replies which were satisfactory. On
6th November Anderson again called, and I told him that I was satisfied with
the references, and let him the house No. 69 St. George's Road at a rent of
&pound;42. He took the house for eighteen months &mdash; from 2Sth November
till 2Sth May a year afterwards. (Shown production No. 34.) That is the
missive. The quarter's rent was due on 2nd February. There was nothing paid.
Shortly after Christmas I learned that the police were keeping an eye on my
premises 69 St. George's Road, and I gave up to the police the letters and
references and the visiting card. On 10th March last I went to Duke Street
Prison, Glasgow, to see a prisoner there, and I identified him as the man who
took the house 69 St. George's Road, giving the name of Anderson, a dentist.
(Shown the prisoner.) That is the man.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; When did you first know that he had
gone away? &mdash; Just about Christmas.</p>

  <p>Did you go personally to the premises? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Then is your information entirely hearsay from the police or other people
as to the fact of him being away? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were there any other people in the house? &mdash; I have heard that there
were others in the house.</p>

  <p>After he left? &mdash; Yes, I was told that he had gone, and that a
subtenant was in the house.</p><br>

  <p>ISAAC PARADISE, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am manager for
Messrs. Stuart &amp; Stuart, house furnishers, in Glasgow, at 65 St. George's
Road. On 4th November last a man called at our premises in St. George's Road
and asked about our terms for furnishing. He gave me his name as Anderson. I
explained the terms to him. He told me that he was looking after a house just
above our shop, and I believe he asked me about the rent. I ascertained the
rent of the house. I believe I told him the rent. A day or two later Anderson
returned to our premises, and I saw him. He selected furniture that day to the
value of &pound;170 odds. He was to pay &pound;4 a month, and give &pound;10 as
the first deposit. That is what we call the hire system. The goods were
delivered at his house, and he paid the &pound;10 at the time he selected the
furniture. He signed an agreement of hire. Anderson got and paid for a few
extra things after the first lot was delivered &mdash; &pound;2 worth. On 10th
December he paid &pound;4 as an instalment to account. I saw Anderson two or
three times after that in our warehouse. We got the money that was paid &mdash;
&pound;16 in all, but the balance does not remain unpaid; we took the furniture
back. I went to the Central Police Office in Glasgow in February. I was shown a
prisoner there, and I identified him as the man who gave the name of Anderson.
(Shown prisoner.) That is the man. (Shown production No. 35 of process.) That
is the account for the goods which I furnished to Anderson.</p>

  <p>Do you recollect whether he sent you a message that he was going away,
and that you might have the furniture back or not? &mdash; I got no message,
but after I heard that he was arrested I went up to the house, and there were
two ladies there. They told me that Mr. Anderson had left word with them that
they were to stay on, and that if he did not return they were to continue
paying &pound;4 on the 10th of each month, and if they were to leave the house
they were to return the furniture to us. When the ladies went away they gave up
the keys, and we removed the furniture. That was the first I heard of his going
away &mdash; when he was arrested.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Can you remember how long these
ladies were in the house No. 69 St. George's Road? &mdash; I believe they were
there somewhere about three days before they left &mdash; from the time I got
to know.</p>

  <p>Do you know the date that they handed over the keys? &mdash; It was the
same day that they left Glasgow &mdash; I do not remember the date.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Can you tell me the month? &mdash; No, but it was
the same day that the ladies left the house.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; Slater left the house about 25th
December, I understand, and did the ladies come then? &mdash; I cannot say.</p>

  <p>Then all you know is that Slater left some time in December? &mdash; I do
not know when he left.</p><br>

  <p>JOHN RUTHVEN, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Gave evidence of
taking an order for visiting cards from a man who signed his name "A.
Anderson," and afterwards identified the prisoner in the Central Police Office
as the man who ordered the cards.</p><br>

  <p>JACOB JACKSON, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a general
warehouseman in South Portland Street, Glasgow. I am a German. About the middle
of November last I recollect of a man coming to my shop. He wanted to sell me a
diamond ring. I said to him that I did not buy any diamonds in that shop. I
asked him how it was that he came to me with the ring. He told me that he was
sent to me as a countryman of his &mdash; a German.</p>

  <p>Did you ask him in German why he wanted to sell the ring? &mdash;
Immediately he spoke I could tell he was a foreigner, and we Germans have a
sort of mutual understanding that if we want to know whether the party we are
speaking to is a German or not we do not generally ask him if he is a German,
but begin just to speak German immediately. I asked him why he wanted to sell
the ring, and he would put in other words that he was hard up and required the
money. I think he told me he came from Hanover. I said, "If you are hard tip, I
do not see there is any necessity for you to sell an article of that
description, but I can give you a job to do, to travel for me, to canvass for
me." He refused; he said he did not think he would be suitable for that kind of
employment. He did not tell me his name or address; I did not ask him. I would
say the value of the ring was about &pound;15. I have never seen him since. I
recollect seeing in the <i>Evening Times</i> of the 22nd February last a
profile photograph of a man named Slater, who had been arrested in connection
with the murder of Miss Gilchrist. When I saw that I wrote at once to the
detective department in Glasgow to the effect that I thought I could recognise
from the photograph the man who had called at my shop. In consequence I was
asked to attend at the Central Police Office on Tuesday, 23rd February last. I
was shown a good few men &mdash; not prisoners, but men &mdash; and I
recognised the man who is in the dock just now as the man. The prisoner is the
man that I recognised immediately.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE? All this happened between six and seven
weeks before Miss Gilchrist was murdered? &mdash; Yes.</p><br>

  <p>Constable FRANCIS BRIEN, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am a constable
in the Western District of the Glasgow Police. I was on night duty in the week
beginning the 20th December, 1908. I had been on night duty for a fortnight
before that. My district included the south side of West Princes Street, in
which Queen's Terrace is situated. I went on duty at 6 p.m. I remained on duty
till two in the morning. During that period I passed Miss Gilchrist's house in
West Princes Street about every half-hour. My beat embraces also part of St.
George's Road, part of Woodlands Road, and West Cumberland Street. As a rule I
go on duty with William Neill. He is a police constable also. When I am out
from six to two he is out from six to nine; he is on the day-shift when I am on
the night-shift. When I go on duty Neill and I walk together along St. George's
Road, past West Princes Street, and then along Great Western Road to Rupert
Street, through Rupert Street to West Princes Street, and eastwards along that
street to St. George's Road again. That was my regular routine of duty during
the fortnight I have been speaking about.</p>

  <p>Are there many people or much traffic in West Princes Street? &mdash; No,
not a great many people. It is particularly quiet at night, about seven
o'clock. I sometimes went through it and met nobody. (Shown prisoner.) I knew
him by sight. I saw him one night standing just a few yards from the corner of
West Princes Street and St. George's Road. Roughly, that would be about 80
yards from Miss Gilchrist's house. I saw him on the occasion I am speaking to
just now the week before the murder. I cannot give any date. It was about half-
past nine at night when I saw him. He was standing there. I did not notice what
direction he was looking in. He was alone. I left him standing. He was standing
against the railings, and I thought he was a drunk man. I took a good look at
him when passing him; I thought he might have been a drunk man; as a rule, we
get them lying against the railings when drunk. I took a good look at the man.
I saw he was quite sober. When I first saw him I was just coming round the
corner of St. George's Road, about 8 yards off from him, and then I passed him.
I did not look round, but he was standing in the same place when I came round
the corner that he was when I passed him. (Shown photograph No. 5 of
productions.) No. 6 marks the point where I saw him that night &mdash; just
about No. 6. That was the second week of the night-shift, and the week before
the murder. That was the last time I saw the prisoner before the murder.</p>

  <p>Had you seen the prisoner before that? &mdash; I had seen him several
times.</p>

  <p>Within that locality? &mdash; On St. George's Road. I cannot exactly say
which way he was going. He was always alone. I should say the first time that I
saw him would be about seven weeks before the murder, so far as I can remember.
I saw him occasionally in or about St. George's Road between that time and the
week before the murder.</p>

  <p>Was it always at night when you saw him? &mdash; I saw him in the
afternoon.</p>

  <p>In the late afternoon? &mdash; Late afternoon, and early too. I saw the
prisoner in West Princes Street only on that one night. The other times were in
St. George's Road. On 21st December I passed along West Princes Street at
night. It would be half-past six, I suppose, when I passed from West Princes
Street into St. George's Road. We came round West Princes Street again, and
passed by the house again about ten minutes to seven. On neither of these
occasions was there any person in the street. When I passed at ten minutes to
seven rain was falling. I passed along, and there was nothing that attracted my
attention at ten minutes to seven.</p>

  <p>When did you pass it the next time? &mdash; The next time I went to get
Neill's cape, as it was raining, and I came back about twenty minutes past
seven. In consequence of a statement which a gentleman made to me, I went to
Miss Gilchrist's house, and I then learned of the murder. I entered Miss
Gilchrist's house. I saw the old lady lying on her back near the fireplace in
the dining-room. There was a quantity of blood about her face and below her
head. She made a movement with her left hand. Her body was on the hearth rug. I
saw that her head was battered. I did not touch the body. I went for the
ambulance, and I returned to the house. I found that the body had not been
interfered with till the police came. It was lying, when the police stretcher
came and the detectives, in the same position as when I found it.</p>

  <p>You saw the girl Lambie when you went to call the ambulance? &mdash; No,
I went to pass word for the superior, and I met the girl Lambie at Blythswood
Drive; she had been up at some friends of Miss Gilchrist. On the 22nd of
February I identified the prisoner from a number of men in the police office.
(Shown prisoner.) That is the man.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; How many other people were in the
room with the prisoner when you identified him? &mdash; Three or four.</p>

  <p>Were there any foreign-looking gentlemen? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was there just what you would call police constables in undress? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>And detective officers? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Can you tell us who were present when you identified the prisoner?
&mdash; I did not know them all.</p>

  <p>There were four or five altogether? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Who was it that asked you to look at him and see if he was like the man?
&mdash; Superintendent Douglas.</p>

  <p>You say that the only occasion when you saw the prisoner in or about West
Princes Street was the week before Miss Gilchrist was murdered? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And he was just at the corner of the street? &mdash; He was about 8 or 9
yards round the corner.</p>

  <p>Against the railings? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How was he dressed? &mdash; He had a light coat on and a hat.</p>

  <p>What kind of hat? &mdash; I cannot say for the hat.</p>

  <p>Can you tell us anything more? &mdash; Well, I know that I passed him by;
I thought myself I had seen him before; I had seen him previous to that.</p>

  <p>You say he was leaning against the railings? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you thought he was a drunk man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you speak to him? &mdash; No, I passed him by.</p>

  <p>What made you think he was drunk? &mdash; Because we very often get a
half-drunk lying there, turning into St. George's Road; it seems to be a
convenient place for them.</p>

  <p>Was that the only reason you had to suppose he was drunk? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Then what was it that convinced you afterwards he was not drunk? &mdash;
I had a good look at him.</p>

  <p>Did you walk up to him close and peer into his face? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And he never said a word? &mdash; No, he never said a word.</p>

  <p>And you cannot say what hat he had on? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Can you say what trousers he had on? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Or what boots he had on? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>How long did you stop to examine him? &mdash; Just a passing look; but
that is the man.</p>

  <p>Was he doing anything of a suspicious character? &mdash; Just standing
leaning against the railings.</p>

  <p>That is not suspicious? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was he looking about him? &mdash; I did not notice him looking about
him.</p>

  <p>Had he his head hanging down? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was his head up in the air? &mdash; Well, just in the ordinary way; it
was not up in the air exactly.</p>

  <p>Have you told us everything you have got to say about this incident?
&mdash; Yes, that night.</p>

  <p>Is that corner you have spoken of a place where nuisance is committed
sometimes? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. MORISON (Shown production No. 43) &mdash; Was it a
coat like that which the man who was leaning against the railings was wearing
at the time? &mdash; Yes, it was like that.</p>

  <p>Of course, you just took a passing glance at his figure? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you looked at his face in passing? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You wanted to ascertain whether he was drunk or sober? &mdash; Yes.</p><br>

  <p>Mrs. MARGARET DICKSON or M'HAFFIE, examined by the Lord Advocate &mdash;
I am the wife of Alexander Rankin M'Haffie, horseshoer, and I live at 16 West
Princes Street. Our house is one stair up, and is on the opposite side of the
street from that of the late Miss Gilchrist's. It will be about 30 yards from
her house. We have a good view of her house from our windows. For some weeks
before the murder of Miss Gilchrist my attention was directed to a man
loitering about on the opposite side of the street. He was not always there at
the same time, but it was always in the afternoon that I saw him. He appeared
to be a dark man, and he had a moustache; he was not very tall, and I would say
he was close on forty. Two or three times I saw him with a light overcoat,
check trousers, spats, and a black bowler hat. I should think that I saw him
five or six times before the murder.</p>

  <p>Were your suspicions aroused by seeing him? &mdash; Yes, I thought it
very strange to see him, and I called my daughter's attention to it. I saw him
walk on the opposite side of the street from the corner, up the street a
little. He would have time to go as far as Miss Gilchrist's house, but I never
looked. I watched him from our window.</p>

  <p>Where did he look? Did he look at the windows, or at what?</p>

  <p>Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I think you should ask what the witness saw him
doing.</p>

  <p>The COURT &mdash; She may be asked if he was looking anywhere, in what
direction he was looking.</p>

  <p>Examination resumed &mdash; He was just looking about him. Sometimes he
looked up towards our windows, and when he saw us looking he put down his head
and moved away. I observed a photograph in an evening newspaper something
similar to production 39. The photograph seemed to me to be like the man I had
seen. I think the last time that I saw him was about eight or nine days before
the night of the murder. On 21st February I went to the Central Police Office
and I saw there the man that I had seen loitering in front of my window. I
identify the prisoner as the man. When I went to the police office there was a
number of other men in the room. I had no difficulty in identifying the man. I
would see him moving back and forward on the street for perhaps close on half
an hour at a time. As regards his walk, he did not carry himself very well
&mdash; he slouched along, with his hands in his pockets sometimes. I would
think that he caught sight of us watching him because of the way he put down
his head. He put down his head very quick and moved away.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; You say this man was about five or
six times altogether on the street? &mdash; I saw him that number of times.</p>

  <p>And with a light overcoat, check trousers, and light-coloured spats?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What kind of hat? &mdash; A black bowler hat.</p>

  <p>Was he always on the opposite side of the street? &mdash; I always saw
him there.</p>

  <p>How far is it across the street? &mdash; Not very far.</p>

  <p>Was the coat a waterproof coat or not? &mdash; I do not think it was a
waterproof. It was just a light-coloured coat. It might perhaps be shower-
proof.</p>

  <p>It was not like No. 43 of the productions? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>What is the difference between it and that coat? &mdash; It was scarcely
the same colour as that. It seemed to be softer looking in appearance.</p>

  <p>What did you see the man do? &mdash; He just walked about.</p>

  <p>He passed back and forward on the opposite side of the street? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>You say you do not know how far up the street he went, because you did
not look? &mdash; I did not look.</p>

  <p>What was it you said was suspicious in his appearance? &mdash; It was
very strange to see him hanging about there several times, seemingly with no
intention of doing anything.</p>

  <p>I do not follow you. If you see any person walking back and forward upon
a pavement do you suspect that person of anything? &mdash; Not always.</p>

  <p>What made you suspect this man? &mdash; I thought him rather peculiar.</p>

  <p>You thought him peculiar? &mdash; I thought it was very peculiar &mdash;
always about the same time.</p>

  <p>How long did his visits to the street last? &mdash; He would be there
about half an hour at a time.</p>

  <p>Just with his head down and strolling? &mdash; Yes, and looking about
him.</p>

  <p>I again ask you, is there anything in that which occurs to you as
suspicious; and what did you suspect? &mdash; I suspected he was not after any
good walking about there.</p>

  <p>Did you see nothing more in his appearance than you have told us now?
&mdash; No, I did not.</p>

  <p>It was in broad daylight all the time? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Can you tell us anything about what sort of tie he had on? &mdash; No, I
could not say. I never took notice.</p>

  <p>Did you take very much notice of him altogether? &mdash; As I glanced
from the window, as far as I could see, I could see him quite plain.</p>

  <p>Across the street? &mdash; Yes. He would stand perhaps ten minutes or so
and then move away.</p>

  <p>Did you see anything peculiar about his nose? &mdash; No, I did not.</p>

  <p>The man who was described in the newspapers was said to have a twisted
nose? &mdash; I heard so.</p>

  <p>You saw nothing of that kind about the person who walked about in front
of your house? &mdash; I could not see very well.</p>

  <p>Is it not the fact that you were not exactly certain of the man, and are
only prepared to say that he resembles him? &mdash; He is the man who was
loitering about West Princes Street.</p>

  <p>Did you say he resembled him? &mdash; I said that he was the man.</p>

  <p>You had seen a photograph of the prisoner in the papers, had you not?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What kind of man did you expect to see when you went down to the police
office? &mdash; I expected to see the man I had seen loitering about. It was
not the papers I was going by.</p>

  <p>The photograph in the papers was something like the man? &mdash; It was
like him.</p>

  <p>And the man that you saw in the police office was something like him,
too? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When you got to the police office how many men were in the room you were
put? &mdash; There were a good many &mdash; I could not say the exact
number.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Would there be half a dozen? &mdash; I am sure there
were over a dozen.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; Were there any foreign-looking
gentlemen there? &mdash; None but himself.</p>

  <p>Were the rest of the people who were in the room policemen? &mdash; I do
not know what they were.</p>

  <p>Did you not look at their boots? &mdash; No. They were sitting.</p>

  <p>And the only man in any way having a foreign appearance, when you went
down to identify the man, was the prisoner? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When you were down at the police office who else were there for the
purpose of identifying? &mdash; There were a good many.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me who any of them were? Were there any of your own
acquaintance? &mdash; My two daughters and my niece. That is all I know.</p>

  <p>Those that went down with you were Madge M'Haffie, your niece, Annie
M'Haffie, and Margaret Dickson M'Haffie? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you go in singly to the room where this man was? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Were you house-cleaning for nine
or ten days before the murder? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you were not looking out of the window? &mdash; Not so much then at
the front.</p>

  <p>Is West Princes Street a very quiet street? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was there any object that occurred to your mind that the man could have
in loitering, moving back and forward there? &mdash; I thought at first it
might be robbery.</p>

  <p>That was the only object? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was there any place special to go to up the street? &mdash; There was no
place.</p>

  <p>Had you the smallest difficulty in identifying the man? &mdash; I had
not.</p>

  <p>Is the accused the man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You recognise him quite easily? &mdash; Yes.</p><br>

  <p>MARGARET DICKSON M'HAFFIE, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I reside
with my mother at 16 West Princes Street, one stair up. I remember several
weeks before the murder of Miss Gilchrist seeing a man loitering about the
street. I just saw him walking up and down, and he would stand for a minute or
two. I would see him for about half an horn* each time walking slowly up and
down and standing. I did not see him look at anything particular. I could see
from our house the whole way up to Miss Gilchrist's house. I observed that the
man walked further than Miss Gilchrist's house, but I did not take any notice
how far he walked up the street. I know the corner of West Cumberland Street. I
cannot see as far as that from our window. The man sometimes walked so far
westwards that we could not see him from our windows. I would then see him walk
back again. I did not observe whether he ever saw me watch him. No reason
occurred to me why the man should be walking back and forward in front of our
house. I identify the accused as the man that I saw. When I saw him he had
light check trousers and a light overcoat, and I think I saw him once or twice
with a black morning coat. I would see him about six times altogether. The last
time I saw him before the murder was about a fortnight before it took place. We
were house-cleaning about nine or ten days before the murder, and were not
looking out of the window so much, as we were busy indoors. I went down to the
police office on 21st February last to see a man. I was taken into a room where
there were ten or twelve men I think, and I identified the man I had seen
loitering about. I could do that quite well.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Were you down at the police office
for purposes of identification on the same day as your mother? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How many foreign-looking people were there in the room when you went in?
&mdash; He was the only one.</p>

  <p>And he was like a photograph you had seen? &mdash; I was not going by the
photograph at all.</p>

  <p>But was he like the photograph you had seen? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Had you read of his description in the papers? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is it your evidence that the man is like and resembles the person you saw
in West Princes Street? &mdash; No; he is the man I saw loitering in West
Princes Street.</p>

  <p>Is it not the case you were not prepared to swear to him at first?
&mdash; Yes, but I thought over what I said to the Crown, and I still adhere to
what I said.</p>

  <p>Why were you not prepared at one time to swear to his being the man?
&mdash; I did not think it was necessary at that time. I was not on my oath at
the time.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; But tell us what was your impression at the first?
&mdash; I was asked if he was the man that was loitering about, if I was
prepared to swear when I was in Edinburgh that he was the man, and I said I did
not know, I was not quite sure at the time.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; When were you not quite sure? &mdash;
When I was interviewed by Mr. Speirs.</p>

  <p>Can you tell us when that was? &mdash; I think it would be in March.</p>

  <p>As I understand it, that would be about three months after you had seen
the man in West Princes Street? &mdash; Yes, fully.</p>

  <p>And you were not prepared then to say he was the man; you were only
prepared to say there was some resemblance? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What has made you change your mind since the middle of March? &mdash; I
said to the Crown that he was the man, and I say he is the man still.</p>

  <p>But that is not the point. Seeing you were unable to say in the month of
March that this was the man, what has enabled you to change your mind and say
now that he is the man? &mdash; I have been thinking it over, and I have come
to the conclusion that he is the man I saw loitering about.</p>

  <p>Did you discuss the matter with your mother? &mdash; No, not very much.</p>

  <p>Had your mother a strong view that he was the man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And had that any influence on your mind? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>I ask you once again what was it that led you to change your opinion
between March and now? &mdash; The more I thought of it the more I was
convinced that he was the man.</p>

  <p>The further you get away from the month of December your impression of
the man's appearance becomes less distinct? &mdash; Yes, but, of course, I had
seen him between that time.</p>

  <p>Did you see him between the month of March and to-day? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>So, while in the month of March you were uncertain of his being the man,
and never saw him again till to-day, you have changed your view? &mdash; No, I
still say he is the man.</p>

  <p>Which you would not say in March? &mdash; I did not need to say to Mr.
Speirs that he was the man at the time.</p>

  <p>Can you give us any other explanation? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>How often have you been seen by the police since March? &mdash; Not at
all. Or by the fiscal? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you notice any striking peculiarity about the man's nose? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>Would you have described his nose as a twisted nose? &mdash; No, I did
not take any notice of it.</p>

  <p>You saw him across the street? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were you at any time suspicious of him? &mdash; When I saw him loitering
about I wondered what he was loitering about for. That was all.</p>

  <p>Surely you do not suspect people who merely walk up and down the street?
&mdash; But seeing him so often, and about the same time.</p>

  <p>What did you suspect him of in broad daylight, walking up and down the
street? &mdash; I did not suspect him. I just wondered what he was doing
there.</p>

  <p>You do not mean that you had arrived at the state of suspicion? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Were you suspicious of anything? &mdash; I was not suspicious of him
doing anything at the time.</p>

  <p>Anything he was doing there seemed quite harmless? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Might he have been waiting for a friend? &mdash; He might.</p>

  <p>Did he see you at the window? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>Did you see him do anything peculiar? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you see him do anything which would lead you to suppose he was afraid
of being seen? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you communicate with the police, or did they come to you first?
&mdash; They came to us first.</p>

  <p>How long after the murder was it that the police called on you? &mdash; I
think it was after the New Year; I think it was in January.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Did you ever see him meeting a
friend? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you ever before or since see any man loitering back and forward for
half an hour at a time? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>When you went to the police office on 21st February did you identify the
man without any difficulty? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And did you tell the fiscal that that was the man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Then in March were you spoken to by Mr. Speirs? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he ask you whether you were prepared to go to Edinburgh and swear
that that was the man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What did you tell him? &mdash; I said I did not know.</p>

  <p>You did not know what? &mdash; Whether I was prepared to swear at the
time or not.</p>

  <p>Had you any doubt that was the man? &mdash; No.</p><br>

  <p>MADGE M'HAFFIE, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I reside at 79 West-
End Park Street, Glasgow. I am the niece of Mrs. M'Haffie. I frequently called
at her house at 16 West Princes Street. I recollect being there on two
occasions two weeks or so before the murder. The first of these two occasions
was about seven o'clock in the evening. When I was going up stairs I met a man.
I had never seen him before. He was coming down the steps. He wore black-
checked trousers, a fawn over-coat, a black bowler hat, and fawn gaiters. I saw
that man a few days afterwards in West Princes Street in the afternoon. I was
in Mrs. M'Haffie's house, and he was on the street, passing her house. He was
walking slowly. I saw him pass the house, and I saw him coming back. I do not
know how often he passed and repassed. I called my aunt's attention to him. I
do not know how long he would be there, but he might be about half an hour. I
went down stairs, but I was not going home then. I was going towards Charing
Cross; that would be east from West Princes Street. I passed the same man
walking towards Charing Cross. It was in St. George's Road that I passed him
&mdash; that is, down to the place where St. George's Road joins Sauchiehall
Street. He was walking slowly in that direction. I noticed that he was walking
with a shuffling gait. On 21st February last I went down to the Central Police
Office, and I was taken into a room where a number of men were.</p>

  <p>Were you able to pick out anybody in that room that was like the man whom
you say you saw in West Princes Street? &mdash; Yes, he was like the man.</p>

  <p>Were you quite sure about him, or not? &mdash; No, he was just like
him.</p>

  <p>Look at the prisoner; is that the man? &mdash; He is like the man.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; When you saw him from the window of
your aunt's house, who was with you? &mdash; My aunt.</p>

  <p>Did she pass any remark on the man at the time? &mdash; I do not
remember.</p>

  <p>Had you any suspicions about the man at all? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>At the time you saw him from your aunt's window, was there anything
suspicious about what he was doing, or was he just walking up and down the
street? &mdash; I think so.</p>

  <p>Then may I take it that till after the murder was committed in the
neighbourhood, and when you were thinking back upon it, you had any suspicions
in your mind, or had you any suspicions at all? &mdash; What about?</p>

  <p>About the man who was there? &mdash; I wondered what he was doing
there.</p>

  <p>Is that all? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>I think you went home after the time you had been in your aunt's house,
and you came back on 3rd January? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you remember seeing your aunt then, and that she had to remind you
that there had been a man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You had really forgotten all about it? &mdash; I had never thought about
it.</p>

  <p>Do you remember what the date was when you were taken down to the police
office in order to identify the man? &mdash; It was in February.</p>

  <p>About two months after the occurrence? &mdash; I think so.</p>

  <p>When you went into the room was there any person at all like the prisoner
&mdash; was there any other dark-haired, dark-complexioned man in the place at
all? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>Did you notice from your aunt's window, or when you were passing the man
in St. George's Road, whether he was a man who had a twisted nose? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>May I take it that you never saw any one who answered that description
walking about West Princes Street? &mdash; I never saw a man with a twisted
nose.</p>

  <p>Was this person who was walking up and down in West Princes Street a
person whose nose did not attract your attention at all? &mdash; I was not
attracted by his features. I did not see them properly.</p>

  <p>If you did not see his features at all what was it that led you to say
that he resembled the person you had seen in West Princes Street? &mdash; He
was fairly like the man in general appearance. In the general look of him,
although you cannot mention any particulars? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were you talking over this matter with your aunt some time since the
occurrence? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you find her stronger than you -were as to the identity? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>And did your cousins also discuss the matter in your presence with your
aunt? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; When you went upstairs did your
cousin Annie open the door to you on the occasion when you met the man coming
downstairs? &mdash; I cannot remember who opened the door.</p>

  <p>Do you remember anything passing between you and your cousin Annie?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Will you tell us what passed between you? &mdash; I said, "I met a
peculiar-looking man on the stairs."</p>

  <p>What did she say in answer? &mdash; She said that he had been at the
door.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; You told us that you met a man on the stairs, and
afterwards you saw a man walking up and down; was that the same man? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Then you told us you saw a man walking along the street, and you noticed
that he was shuffling; was that the same man as you had met on the stairs?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Are you sure about that? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you think that the prisoner is like that man, but you cannot swear?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Could you say whether the man you saw was dark or fair? &mdash; I thought
that he was dark.</p>

  <p>Could you say whether he had a moustache or not? &mdash; Yes, he had a
moustache.</p>

  <p>To that extent you saw his features? &mdash; Yes.</p><br>

  <p>ANNIE RANKIN M'HAFFIE, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am the
daughter of Mrs. M'Haffie, and I live at 16 West Princes Street, Glasgow. I
recollect one day four weeks before the murder that a man called at our door
and rang the bell. That was between seven and eight o'clock at night. I opened
the door. Our name, "Mr. M'Haffie," is on the door in large letters on a brass
plate. When I opened the door the man asked if any person of the name of
Anderson lived there, and I said "No." I could not understand at the time how
anybody could ask for Anderson at our house with "Mr. M'Haffie" on the door.
When I said "No" the man turned and walked downstairs again. Within a minute or
so afterwards some one came to our door. I thought that it was the same man
coming back again. I opened the door, and it was my cousin, the last witness. I
asked her if she had met a man on the stair, and she said "Yes." I do not
remember what I said to her. I never saw that man again. I went to the Central
Police Office on 21st February last with my mother and sister, and I was taken
into a room where there was a number of men.</p>

  <p>Did you see anybody in the room who was like the man to whom you opened
the door? &mdash; I pointed out a man as like the man who was at the door.</p>

  <p>You were not quite certain? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Is the prisoner like the man to whom you opened the door? &mdash; He is
like the man. As far as I know, that was the only time I had ever seen him,
when he came to the door.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I suppose the question about
Anderson might be put by anybody who was asking for a lodger in the house?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is there anything peculiar about that question? &mdash; No, I do not
think so.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Did you notice anything about the man's accent?
&mdash; No, I did not.</p>

  <p>He did not appear to be a foreigner? &mdash; No, I do not think so.</p>

  <p>What kind of a light was there on the stair at your house? &mdash; There
is a light below our door.</p>

  <p>Gas? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>One jet? &mdash; Yes, below our door, further down the stair.</p>

  <p>There is no light above your door? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was there any light in your lobby that would come out into the entrance?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was the light good or bad? &mdash; It was not good.</p><br>

  <p>JOHN THOMSON TRENCH, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am a detective
officer in the Central District of Glasgow Police. On Sunday, 2l8t February, I,
along with Detective Alexander Cameron, went to Renfrew in a motor car and met
the prisoner. He was in charge of the witnesses Warnock and Pyper. I
accompanied them to the Central Police Station at Glasgow. I had charge of the
arrangements under which certain of the witnesses were to identify, if they
could, the prisoner.</p>

  <p>What arrangements were made for securing that the test of identification
was a fair one? &mdash; The prisoner was placed along with eleven other men in
a row in the detective office, and the witnesses were brought in one by one.
The other men were mostly police officials, all in plain clothes. There were
also two railway officials there. Two of the men had what I would call peculiar
noses. The twelve men were made to stand up in a row, and the prisoner was
allowed to take up any position in the row that he pleased.</p>

  <p>Was every precaution taken so that the witnesses should not have an
opportunity of seeing Slater before they saw him along with the other men?
&mdash; Yes; there was every precaution taken to avoid that. Slater was taken
to the doctor's room, where he got his tea, and during that time the witnesses
were all collecting in the office, and he was taken by me from the doctor's
room through the lieutenant's bar and through the telephone room and through
the detective office into the officers' room at the back, where he could not be
seen by any of the witnesses.</p>

  <p>And accordingly in point of fact he was not seen by any of the witnesses
before they saw him amongst the twelve people? &mdash; Not as far as I saw; I
do not think they could see him. The witnesses were also taken in singly, and
precautions were taken to prevent the witnesses from meeting each other after
they had been in the room where the prisoner was. No witness was brought into
the room for identification purposes who had an opportunity of speaking with
any other witness; they were put into another room. The witness Mrs. M'Haffie
was brought in; she was the first witness to see him. She was brought into the
room by me, and I asked her if she could point out the man that was referred to
in her statement which she had previously given, and she pointed to the
accused. I said, "Now, go forward and point out your man; do not be afraid,"
and she went forward and put her hand on his coat sleeve. The other M'Haffies
also identified him in the same way, one after the other. I brought in the
witness Bryson. As he came in at the door he glanced along the row of men, and
without hesitation he went right forward to the accused and put his hand on the
man, and said, "This is the man." I did not take in the witness Mary Barrowman.
It was Sergeant Dornan of the Western District who brought her in, but I saw
her brought in. At the time she was brought in the accused was dressed in a
light fawn overcoat, which was found in one of his trunks, and a soft split
hat. She stood and looked at him, and she said, "Pull it down a little further
&mdash; further yet"; then she said, "That's it, that is the way you were
dressed when I saw you."</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Pull what down? &mdash; His hat.</p>

  <p>Examination continued &mdash; It was principally the witnesses in the
Central District that I had charge of, but I did not have charge of the Western
District. On the 2nd of January of this year I, in company with Superintendent
Douglas, went to the prisoner's house at 69 St. George's Road. It is three
stairs up, and consists of four rooms and a scullery and kitchen. There were
two German women in the house. I did not ask where the prisoner had gone, but
the woman Freedman made a statement as to the prisoner. I searched the house.
(Shown production No. 33.) These are ten visiting cards that I found in the
house. These visiting cards bear the name and address, "A. Anderson, 69 St.
George's Road." I found these in the house. (Shown account and invoice for
furniture, production No. 35.) I got these in the house also. I took them to
the Police Office, and labelled them. I have been at the locus of the murder. I
examined the close No. 46 West Princes Street. The close is what is called here
an entry, but in the west it is called a close. The close No. 46 West Princes
Street is on the opposite side of the street from the close leading into Miss
Gilchrist's house, directly opposite. The stair leading to the houses there
begins immediately behind the close door, and takes a turn. It is a spiral one,
and is continuous until the first flat is reached. About six steps down from
that landing there is a staircase window fronting West Princes Street, and the
sill of that window is about 6 feet from the steps of the stair. By getting up
to the landing at the first flat you can see through this window, and you can
see to the door of the close of Miss Gilchrist's house. When I went up the
second flat I found a staircase window there. That staircase window is only 2|
to 3 feet above the stair. That window' looks directly into the room of the
house where Miss Gilchrist was murdered. If the blinds of Miss Gilchrist's room
were up I believe you could see into the room. When I was there the blinds were
down. There is a gas on that stair. If one were looking through the window at
night the gaslight would not interfere with one's view &mdash; not the gas on
the stair.</p>

  <p>Is there a gaslight that might interfere with it? &mdash; No, the gas is
on the first flat; this window I refer to is one and a half stairs up &mdash;
half way on the road to the second flat. The stair begins just immediately from
the door, and if the door is pushed back there is a recess formed between the
outside wall and the door. The recess is of considerable size, and a man could
quite easily stand behind it. I did not notice the same in connection with Miss
Gilchrist's door. I did not go in to see.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; You met the prisoner at Renfrew,
and motored him into Glasgow? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me whether the arrival of your motor with the prisoner in it
could be seen through a glass door of the room in which all the witnesses were
&mdash; in the lobby? &mdash; There were none of the witnesses present when he
arrived in the motor for two hours afterwards.</p>

  <p>From the room in which the witnesses were congregated is there a glass
door which looks into the lobby? &mdash; There is.</p>

  <p>And if the witnesses had been there upon the arrival of the prisoner
could they have seen him? &mdash; Some of them could.</p>

  <p>You say they were not there? &mdash; Not to my knowledge; they were not
there till four o'clock, and he arrived at two.</p>

  <p>Do you say that in point of fact at the time of his arrival you know that
none of the witnesses had arrived? &mdash; Not so far as I know; I did not see
any of them.</p>

  <p>The prisoner was placed in a row with eleven men; was there any foreign-
looking man amongst them? &mdash; No; they were all Scotsmen, I think.</p>

  <p>No person of dark complexion and foreign appearance? &mdash; There were
some of them of dark complexion.</p>

  <p>And foreign appearance? &mdash; No; not foreign appearance.</p>

  <p>So that anybody looking for a foreigner would, of course, go straight to
the prisoner? &mdash; Possibly, yes.</p>

  <p>That is an irregular way of conducting an identification, is it not?
&mdash; I do not think so.</p>

  <p>I understood that when you were going to identify a person in connection
with any alleged crime you attempted to get him placed amongst men who were
more or less like him; is not that so? &mdash; No, it is not.</p>

  <p>Is that not your practice in Glasgow? &mdash; No, it is not.</p>

  <p>Just as a matter of ordinary fairness, do you not think that that would
be a proper practice to observe? &mdash; It might be the fairest way, but it is
not the practice in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>So that you had two railway officials and eleven policemen? &mdash; There
were eleven including the railway officials, and the prisoner.</p>

  <p>Nine policemen and two railway officials? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you cannot mention any one who resembled Slater? &mdash; Oh, none of
them resembled Slater.</p>

  <p>Slater's photograph, as an obvious foreigner, had been published in the
Glasgow evening papers before that? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>So that any person who had seen his photograph would look for a
foreigner, and could not escape singling out Slater at your identification?
&mdash; I do not think they could very well.</p>

  <p>You said two of the men had peculiar noses? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were you looking for a man at this time who had a twisted nose? &mdash;
No. It happened that two men who were selected had peculiar noses.</p>

  <p>What were the peculiarities? &mdash; One of them has a little hump on his
nose, and the other has a kind of flattish nose; they were not noses like
Slater's at all.</p>

  <p>Then I may take it that there was no person in the room who had a nose
the least like Slater's? &mdash; No, I should think it is very difficult to
find one like it.</p>

  <p>Had you anything to do with the description which was published in the
papers after this crime had been committed? &mdash; No, I had nothing to do
with that.</p>

  <p>Do you describe Slater's nose as a twisted nose? &mdash; No, I would not
describe it as a twisted nose.</p>

  <p>Was that not the way it was described by the girl Barrowman? &mdash; I
could not say; there were so many rumours and stories that I did not pay
attention to them.</p>

  <p>Has the Glasgow public not gone pretty nearly mad over this case? &mdash;
I would not like to say they have gone mad; it has certainly caused a lot of
sensation and talk.</p>

  <p>Have you heard that old Miss Gilchrist was a resetter? &mdash; I have
heard that frequently.</p>

  <p>And that she kept uncut diamonds in her house, which she had got from
thieves? &mdash; Yes, I have heard that too.</p>

  <p>Not a word of truth in it? &mdash; Not a word of truth in it, as far as I
know.</p>

  <p>Have you heard within the last fortnight a rumour to the effect that
people have been back at her house tearing up the floors and throwing uncut
diamonds, which were found under the floors, into the street? &mdash; No, I
have never heard that story.</p>

  <p>Have you heard that she was the mother of the servant girl Lambie?
&mdash; No.</p>

  <p>But of another? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Have you heard that she was the mother of Slater? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>May I take it that the case has given rise to extreme excitement amongst
the Glasgow public, and to no end of unfounded rumours? &mdash; There is no
doubt of that &mdash; all sorts of rumours.</p>

  <p>Have other men been in custody in connection with this case besides
Slater? &mdash; I believe there were several men arrested shortly after the
murder, but I had no connection with them at all.</p>

  <p>And a number of witnesses failed to identify these men? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Have a number of witnesses failed to identify Slater? &mdash; Oh, there
have been a number of people who have seen him who did not know him at all.</p>

  <p>You say that Mrs. M'Haffie pointed out Slater? &mdash; She did.</p>

  <p>Do you say that all the other M'Haffies did the same? &mdash; They did.</p>

  <p>Is it your evidence they were all quite sure of him? &mdash; Every one of
them was absolutely certain of him.</p>

  <p>Do you say that Madge M'Haffie absolutely identified the man? &mdash; I
do; I took them all in myself, and every one of them was sure of the man.</p>

  <p>Do you say that Annie M'Haffie absolutely identified the man? &mdash; She
did.</p>

  <p>When the witness Barrowman was brought in you say you were present?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>That is the girl who was in the street, some distance from the doorway
out of which the man rushed, just after the murder? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When the girl Barrowman came in to identify Slater this was after her
visit to America? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And do you say that she did not identify him until a hat had been pulled
down over his nose; did the girl Barrowman, when he was dressed in the office
with an overcoat and a soft split hat, say, as regards the cap, "Pull it down"?
&mdash; She did&mdash; "Pull it down more."</p>

  <p>And was it after the cap had been pulled further down that she said,
"That's it"? &mdash; "That is the way you had it when I saw you," referring to
his hat.</p>

  <p>Do you say she was doubtful about the identification to start with?
&mdash; No, I do not say that.</p>

  <p>The hat which you put on Slater you called a soft split hat? &mdash; Yes,
a soft kind of tweed hat.</p>

  <p>Could you tell me the hat it was? &mdash; I could if I saw it.</p>

  <p>(Shown production No. 44) &mdash; Is that what you call a Donegal hat?
&mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Are you aware that in the first information given by Barrowman to the
police she said that the man who came rushing out of the close had a Donegal
hat? &mdash; No; but I have heard the Donegal hat mentioned several times.</p>

  <p>And as being the thing which was characteristic of the man who came out
of the close? &mdash; Yes, that is so.</p>

  <p>That (production No. 44) is not a Donegal hat? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Then what was the purpose of dressing the man up to Barrowman with this
hat, which was not the kind of hat which he was supposed to be wearing at the
time he came out of the close? &mdash; That was the only hat which was found in
his box.</p>

  <p>In point of fact, there was no Donegal hat found in the box? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>What is a Donegal hat? &mdash; I iunderstand a Donegal hat to be a soft
tweed hat of round shape, with a brim all the way round.</p>

  <p>And certainly not this at all? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you see the boxes of clothes? &mdash; Yes, I saw them opened.</p>

  <p>Have you produced in this case all the articles of clothing which you
suppose would assist the prosecution towards an identification? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you find any checked trousers? &mdash; I could not say; I was present
when the boxes were opened and searched, but I really could not say whether
there were checked trousers or not.</p>

  <p>Were there any light-coloured fawn spats found? &mdash; I could not
say.</p>

  <p>But you went through the boxes? &mdash; I was there when the boxes were
examined.</p>

  <p>Were you looking? &mdash; The men who particularly examined the boxes
were Mr. Warnock and Detective Inspector Pyper.</p>

  <p>And, as far as you know, no fawn-coloured spats were found? &mdash; Not
as far as I know.</p>

  <p>And no Donegal hat was found? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Were any brown boots found? &mdash; No, I do not think so; I did not see
any brown boots; there were some lady's boots &mdash; I think a pair of lady's
brown boots.</p>

  <p>Then I may take it this way: if the man who came out of Miss Gilchrist's
house had a Donegal hat on and brown boots you found nothing in the contents of
the prisoner's boxes which would support the view that he is the murderer?
&mdash; No, they were not there; I did not see anything of that kind.</p>

  <p>And if the prisoner is supposed to have walked up and down West Princes
Street with checked trousers on and fawn-coloured spats, you found nothing in
his boxes which would support the charge against him? &mdash; I did not see
anything like that found in the boxes.</p>

  <p>Did you find any light, soft overcoat? &mdash; No, we did not find a
light, soft overcoat.</p>

  <p>The only light coat is this waterproof (production No. 43)? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you show that at any time to Mrs. M'Haffie? &mdash; No, I did not.</p>

  <p>Supposing Mrs. M'Haffie says that the prisoner was wearing a light, soft
overcoat, which was not a waterproof, you found nothing in his boxes which
would support that? &mdash; No, there was not a light cloth coat found at all
that I saw.</p>

  <p>How many boxes of clothes or bags did this man have? &mdash; There were
seven trunks altogether.</p>

  <p>And did the police go carefully over them all? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Were they all full? &mdash; They were all full.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; He had a great many suits of clothes?
&mdash; He had a lot of clothing &mdash; good clothing.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; And amongst them there were old clothes; they were
not all new clothes? &mdash; No, they were not all new clothes; a lot of them
had been worn.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; You went into a close, as I
understand, called No. 46 West Princes Street and looked across from it towards
Miss Gilchrist's house? &mdash; Going up the stair, one and a half stairs up,
at the staircase window, when you were standing on the stair looking through
the window you saw right into the window of the room in which Miss Gilchrist
was murdered.</p>

  <p>You never actually had an opportunity of trying whether you could or not?
&mdash; No, the blinds were down.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; It was not part of your duty to
examine the boxes? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>And the examination was really conducted by two other witnesses who are
on the Crown list? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>And, of course, you do not know the details of what was found in the
boxes? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>But did you see that there was a large variety of clothes? &mdash; Yes,
there was a large variety of clothes.</p>

  <p>And was there a considerable number of overcoats? &mdash; Yes, there were
several overcoats.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me when the boxes were opened and examined? &mdash;
Immediately on his arrival at the Central Police Office on the Sunday, 21st
February.</p>

  <p>Of course, Slater had been out of Glasgow from the 25th of December?
&mdash; Yes, from Christmas night.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Was there any name on the boxes? &mdash; The letters
"O.S." were on several of them.</p><br>

  <p>CHRISTOPHER WALKER, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a
constable in the Glasgow Police Force. I was on duty in the end of December,
1908, on the north side of West Princes Street. I was on day duty in the
beginning of December. I recollect passing along the north side of West Princes
Street in the direction of St. George's Road on 1st December about a quarter to
six o'clock. I saw a man standing on the edge of the pavement. I know 15
Queen's Terrace. The man was opposite that, standing on the opposite side. I
took a good look at the man. I thought I knew the man, and I waved to him. I
saw he was not the man I knew, and I passed right on to St. George's Road,
leaving the man standing still on the pavement. He was looking in a slanting
direction towards 15 Queen's Terrace. I thought he was waiting for some party
to meet him. About three nights after that I met the same man in West Princes
Street 40 or 50 yards further down towards St. George's Road, on the north side
of West Princes Street. On that occasion he was walking leisurely up the
street, towards Queen's Crescent. That was about a quarter to six o'clock. I
did not look after him. I simply recognised him as the man I had mistaken the
previous night. I did not see him again that night. The next time I saw him was
about a fortnight after that, on 17th or 18th December, about a quarter to
seven o'clock, standing at the foot of West Princes Street, near St. George's
Road, opposite the chemist's door. He was on the south side of West Princes
Street. I stood for several minutes, and he stood all the time, and I went away
and left him standing. I was on the opposite side of the street. When I left I
went in the direction of St. George's Cross. Those were the only three
occasions on which I saw the man in West Princes Street. I am not aware that I
had ever seen him before. On Monday night, 22nd February, I saw the man in the
Central Police Office, Glasgow. I recognised him at once as the man I had met
in West Princes Street. I had no difficulty in recognising him at all. I was
put on to watch Miss Gilchrist's house after the murder, about 9.30 p.m. I was
at the close on the street until five o'clock in the morning. There were very
few people going about, and I thought I would look and see if I could find the
weapon with which the deed had been done. I went with my lamp to the back green
and searched to see if anything had been thrown from the house. I did not find
anything at all.</p>

  <p>Did you search very carefully? &mdash; In a hurry. I searched with my
lamp. The accused is the man I identified at the Police Office.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Of course, you are quite certain
that is the man you saw in the Police Office? &mdash; Yes, and in West Princes
Street also.</p>

  <p>On each occasion when you saw the man in West Princes Street you were on
the opposite side of the street? &mdash; From 15 Queen's Terrace.</p>

  <p>Do I understand that you saw the man on the other side of the street?
&mdash; The opposite side from Queen's Terrace.</p>

  <p>And you took him for your friend? &mdash; Yes, for a gentleman that I
knew.</p>

  <p>Who was the gentleman? &mdash; He is in Court here.</p>

  <p>So much the better. What is his name? &mdash; Mr. Paradise.</p>

  <p>That was a gentleman who gave evidence, and who sold furniture? &mdash;
Yes, the very same.</p>

  <p>He is a foreign-looking gentleman, is he not? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Of dark complexion, and with a moustache? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How long have you known him? &mdash; About twelve months.</p>

  <p>You waved your hand to a man you thought to be Mr. Paradise? &mdash; Yes.
Before I came up to him I raised my hand, but as I reached him I saw it was not
him.</p>

  <p>What was he doing, the man you took for Mr. Paradise? &mdash; Simply
standing on the pavement and glancing about the street.</p>

  <p>I suppose you did not think there was anything suspicious in his actions?
&mdash; I saw nothing suspicious about him.</p>

  <p>Was he strolling about? &mdash; He was standing on the edge of the
pavement.</p>

  <p>You say that you saw him on 1st December, at a quarter to six? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>When was the next time you saw him? &mdash; Three or four days after
that. Where was he then? &mdash; Forty or fifty yards further down the
street.</p>

  <p>On the same side? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>That is to say, on the north side? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Where was he the next time? &mdash; The foot of West Princes Street, the
opposite side.</p>

  <p>What was he doing on these later occasions? &mdash; Simply as if he was
standing waiting for some person.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to attract your attention? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You said you thought he was waiting for somebody? &mdash; That was the
opinion I formed seeing him standing there.</p>

  <p>You did not think he was watching any house in particular? &mdash; I
could not say that I thought that. He was simply looking in the direction of 15
Queen's Terrace.</p>

  <p>You passed behind him? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And on the other occasions? &mdash; I met him coming up on the second
occasion, and on the third occasion he was standing on the opposite side of the
street.</p>

  <p>Would you undertake to identify positively a man standing on the opposite
side of West Princes Street in December, at or about seven o'clock? &mdash;
There is a chemist's shop at the corner, and they have a door to West Princes
Street which is well lighted up. He was standing facing this door, and I was on
the opposite side.</p>

  <p>He was facing the door of the shop? &mdash; He was right in a line with
the door.</p>

  <p>Was his back towards you? &mdash; No, his face was towards me.</p>

  <p>The chemist's shop would only light up his back? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>That would make it a little more difficult. Do you say under these
circumstances you have confidence in your identification of the man standing on
the opposite side of the street? &mdash; Yes, I have every confidence. There is
an electric lamp in St. George's Road at that corner, which throws a very
bright light.</p>

  <p>On the second occasion he was further down the street than on the first
occasion. How far was he from St. George's Road? &mdash; About 50 yards.</p>

  <p>The electric light would not help you very much there? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Would you say that, on the second occasion, you could positively identify
the man? &mdash; Yes, because there was a lamp on the opposite side of the
street.</p>

  <p>What did you identify him by? &mdash; I just thought he resembled this
man. That is all.</p>

  <p>You thought he was a foreign-looking person with a darkish moustache,
something like Mr. Paradise? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is that all you can say about him? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You never saw this man again until 22nd February? &mdash; No, not until
22nd February.</p>

  <p>By that time the newspapers had been full of photographs, had they not?
&mdash; Yes, there were lots of photographs.</p>

  <p>And you knew the person you were to identify was the person of foreign
appearance? &mdash; I daresay I did.</p>

  <p>Who was at the Police Office when you arrived there? &mdash; I could not
say. There were a number of detectives.</p>

  <p>Was there any person of a foreign appearance except the prisoner? &mdash;
Mr. Paradise himself was there.</p>

  <p>You would not mistake him, of course? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was there any person of a foreign appearance except the prisoner? &mdash;
&mdash; Not that I saw.</p>

  <p>Was he there among detectives and policemen? &mdash; Yes. Did they go
through the farce of asking you if you saw any one like the man? &mdash; They
asked if I saw any one that I recognised, and I went to him.</p>

  <p>You at once went to him? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>As I understand, you knew the other people in the room to be either
detectives or Mr. Paradise? &mdash; I did not know that they were. Mr. Paradise
was not in the room, he was in some other room.</p>

  <p>When you went down, do I understand that the only person of foreign
appearance in the room into which you went was the prisoner? &mdash; Yes. And
the others were detectives? &mdash; I do not know what they were. I thought you
said before that they were detectives? &mdash; Some of them were, but I do not
know whether they were all detectives. Who were the other people? &mdash; I do
not know. None had a foreign appearance? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>So you were able to identify a foreigner at once? &mdash; I did not go
there to identify a foreigner at all.</p>

  <p>There was an auger found in the back green that you searched with a
light? &mdash; I am told there was.</p>

  <p>You had looked the whole place with your lamp on the night after the
death of Miss Gilchrist? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What is the extent of the back green? &mdash; It is a pretty large-sized
back green.</p>

  <p>Did you make a thorough search? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>If there was an auger found in the back green next day, do you think it
had come into the back green between the time of your search and the time of
its being found? &mdash; There were some parts of the back green where there
was long grass, and although I made, as I thought, a careful examination, I did
not look for so small a weapon as an auger, and I might have passed it.</p>

  <p>It was just under the kitchen window? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was there long grass or short grass there? &mdash; There were long weeds
lying about where this auger was found.</p>

  <p>You did not see it found? &mdash; This is the first time I have seen
it.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Look at photograph No. 1 of No.
5 of the productions. Do you see a No. 4 on the photograph? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was that near the place where you saw the man the first time? &mdash; It
was further round than that.</p>

  <p>You mean nearer St. George's Road? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>A foot or two? &mdash; A yard or two.</p>

  <p>And nearer Miss Gilchrist's house? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you see a No. 6 on that photograph? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was that about the place where you saw the man the third time? &mdash;
Yes, that is about the place.</p>

  <p>Do you see a No. 2 on the photograph? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is that near the place where you saw the man the second time when he was
walking westwards? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Are the lights in West Princes Street incandescent? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And is it electric light that you have in St. George's Road? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>In the middle of the road or at the sides? &mdash; The sides.</p>

  <p>Was there an electric light in St. George's Road near the comer, near No.
6? &mdash; Immediately opposite, on the St. George's Road, right in the centre
of West Princes Street.</p>

  <p>It throws a powerful light on that corner where you see No. 6? &mdash;
Yes.</p><br>

  <p>EUPHEMIA CUNNINGHAM, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I live at 114
South Woodside Road, Glasgow. I am in the employment of a photographer at 167
St. George's Road. My dinner hour is from one to two, and I go home daily at
that hour by West Princes Street and Queen's Crescent. That is a very quiet
district and a quiet street. On Monday, 14th December last, when I was going
home for my dinner, I observed a man standing at the comer of Queen's Crescent
and West Princes Street. I had never seen him before. He was looking towards
Miss Gilchrist's house. I should think that he would be about 60 feet away from
the house, and just at the comer of Queen's Crescent. I returned again about
two o'clock, but the man was not there. On the following day I went for my
dinner at the same hour. I saw the man again standing at the same place. On
Wednesday, the 16th, I went for my dinner at the same hour. I saw the same man
standing at the same place. On Thursday, the 17th, when going for my dinner at
the same hour, I saw him again standing at the same place and looking towards
Miss Gilchrist's house. William Campbell was with me, and I said to him, "There
is that man again." It occurred to me as odd, and I wondered what took the man
there. I never saw him on any occasion when I was coming back from my dinner. I
thought his appearance was foreign, and he was very dark, with a sallow
complexion, and was rather a heavy-featured man. I thought he was clean shaven,
but, of course, I did not get a very good view of the front face; it was the
side face that I always saw. He had a dark tweed coat on, and a green cap with
a peak. He was on the same pavement as I was on on each occasion, but Mr.
Campbell was nearer to him than I was. I do not recollect seeing the man before
11th December. I saw him at the Central Police Office in February. I was taken
into a room where there were a lot of men, and I saw there the man I had seen
on these different occasions in West Princes Street. The accused is the man
that I saw in the police office and on the street.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Have you been shown the green cap
that the man was wearing since? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was it a green cap with a peak? &mdash; Yes, a dark green cap.</p>

  <p>I show you one of the caps under label 46? &mdash; That is not the cap.</p>

  <p>Is the other one the cap? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Is No. 44 the cap? &mdash; No. This cap that I see is more like it.</p>

  <p>That is a cap that is obviously of black cloth? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you say that is the cap that the man was wearing? &mdash; No, there
seemed to be more green in it.</p>

  <p>Who was it that showed you the green cap that you identified? &mdash; Mr.
Hart, the fiscal.</p>

  <p>You were not told that the cap belonged to Slater? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>It comes to this, that you say that Slater was wearing a green cap which
has not been shown to you here? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>Can you give me the date when you identified the prisoner in the police
office? &mdash; About 28th February.</p>

  <p>That is fully two months after you had seen the man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you notice any peculiarity about his nose? &mdash; No, I did not.</p>

  <p>That is not part of the identification? &mdash; No. It was the left side
that I always saw.</p>

  <p>The nose did not appear to you to be in any way striking? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you ever see him front face? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>When you say the man was standing in a set attitude day after day looking
towards Miss Gilchrist's house, what makes you say that he was looking towards
her house? &mdash; Because his face was turned in that direction.</p>

  <p>But equally well, I suppose, the man might have been looking down towards
St. George's Road? &mdash; His face would have been more front if he had been
looking that way.</p>

  <p>He was doing nothing at all? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did he seem to be anxious to escape your observation? &mdash; No. He had
the collar of his coat up.</p>

  <p>Did he seem to you to be hiding in any way? &mdash; No. I thought he was
waiting for some one or looking for some one.</p>

  <p>It was always at one o'clock that you saw him, and he was always away by
two o'clock? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you say that he was quite clean shaven? &mdash; Yes, I thought so.</p>

  <p>I mean with no moustache at all? &mdash; I could not say very well,
because the collar of his coat was up.</p>

  <p>Do you suggest now that on every occasion when you passed the man he had
his upper lip buried in his coat collar? &mdash; I do not say that, but I did
not get a very good view of the front face. It was more the back of the head
and the side of the face that I saw.</p>

  <p>Suppose if any gentleman of sallow complexion and clean shaven, with dark
hair and of foreign appearance, had been shown you in the police office, you
would have been quite ready to say that he was the man? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You had seen this man's photograph in the papers? &mdash; Yes, I saw
one.</p>

  <p>And did you think you recognised him from that? &mdash; I did at once.</p>

  <p>The man in the photograph in the papers had a considerable moustache?
&mdash; No, a slight moustache.</p>

  <p>Was that the photograph that you saw (shown No. 39 of the productions)?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>There is a very distinct moustache there? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>If the man you saw at the comer was clean shaven, how did you recognise
at once a man with a heavy moustache as being the same? &mdash; It was more the
side of the face and the back of the head that I recognised, not the front of
the face.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt if you saw the side of his face you would see one-half
of his moustache? &mdash; I did not notice that he had a moustache.</p>

  <p>That is exactly what I am suggesting. My point is this, if the man whom
you saw, as you say, at the corner of Queen's Crescent had no moustache on the
14th, 15tli, 16th, and l7th December, how did you come to recognise in the
paper of 15th January a man with a noticeable moustache as the same person?
&mdash; He was quite easily recognised. I would not forget the side of the
face.</p>

  <p>But it is a front face that is shown in the paper? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Can you explain how it was if, on the 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th
December, you saw a clean-shaven man, side face, standing in West Princes
Street, you came to identify the photograph of a man full face towards you and
with a considerable moustache as the person whom you saw? &mdash; It is not
only the photograph I am going by. I was shown the man down in the police
office.</p>

  <p>But you first identified him from the photograph alone? &mdash; Yes, I
did.</p>

  <p>Can you understand how you failed to notice the moustache? &mdash; No,
not any more than it was not very prominent. He had the collar of his coat up,
and it was always this side of the face and the back of the head that I saw.</p>

  <p>Can you have a very confident identification from the back of his head?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What was peculiar about the back of his head? &mdash; The ears were
sticking out slightly.</p>

  <p>Did you ever see a man with ears sticking out before? &mdash; Yes, many a
man.</p>

  <p>It is not very characteristic, you know? &mdash; Then there was the side
of the face, the heavy jaw bones.</p>

  <p>Surely the jaw bone would also be under the coat collar? &mdash; Yes, it
was a little.</p>

  <p>Why did you identify a jaw bone which you never saw? I am only suggesting
to you that you may have been a little hasty in your identification. &mdash; I
don't think so.</p>

  <p>The cap you saw is not here? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Are there any other details of the clothes that you noticed? &mdash; The
dark coat.</p>

  <p>Anything else? &mdash; That was all, and the green cap.</p>

  <p>Had he checked trousers or fawn spats? &mdash; I did not notice.</p>

  <p>You cannot tell anything about his boots or his trousers? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Do you say that his jaw was set right down in his coat collar? &mdash;
No. it was not buried right down, but the collar of his coat was up.</p>

  <p>Over his jaw? &mdash; Not right over, but I did not get a very good view
of the front face. What I saw was more the side and the back of the head and
the neck.</p>

  <p>Do you not think that if the man was clean-shaved you ought not to have
identified a man with a moustache as being the same? &mdash; I think it is very
like the man I saw.</p>

  <p>When you went down to the police office to identify this man later on, on
28th February, how many people were in the room? &mdash; I could not tell. I
did not count them.</p>

  <p>How many were with Slater? &mdash; I should fancy about a dozen.</p>

  <p>Were there any men there like Slater? &mdash; No, I could not say that.</p>

  <p>Was there any foreign-looking man in the room except Slater? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>In point of fact, Slater had then a moustache, had he not? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>So he was like the photograph which you had seen before? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When you went into the room where Slater was, was it not perfectly
obvious to you that the rest of the men who were in the room were all
detectives and policemen? &mdash; They certainly looked like it.</p>

  <p>Did you observe their boots? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>When you saw Slater in the police office what kind of boots had he?
&mdash; I did not look at his boots.</p>

  <p>What kind of coat had he on that day? &mdash; The first time I saw him he
had on a blue coat.</p>

  <p>How often did you see him in the police office? &mdash; Twice.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Did you pass within 2 or 3 feet
of him on the pavement? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Had you a clear view of him each time? &mdash; Yes, I had.</p>

  <p>Are you sure the accused is the very man you saw? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was it raining when he had up his coat collar? &mdash; No, but it was
cold.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; On each occasion were his clothes, including his cap
and his greatcoat, the same? &mdash; Yes, they were always the same
clothes.</p><br>

  <p>WILLIAM CAMPBELL, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a
photographer in Glasgow. On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, 15th, 16th, and
17th December last, I was walking home at the mid-day meal hour, one o'clock. I
was going up West Princes Street, which is invariably a very quiet street. One
seldom or never sees anybody hanging about there. On Tuesday, 15th, when I was
going home that way, I observed a man who was standing at the corner of West
Princes Street and Queen's Crescent. He was looking towards Mr. Adams' house on
the other side of the street. That was the door next Miss Gilchrist's house.
The last witness was with me at the time. I did not observe anything particular
about the man. When I came back I did not notice him. On the two succeeding
days, Wednesday and Thursday, I passed the same place about the same hour and I
saw the same man. He was standing on the same spot looking over in the same
direction. I remember Miss Cunningham saying, "There is that same man again; I
wonder what he is doing there." I do not know whether he heard what she said.
We were pretty close to him at the time, and as we were passing he turned round
and turned away his head, but that was all. I formed no opinion as to why ho
should be there. I have never seen the man standing there since. I have never
seen any one standing there since, except in the week following the murder,
when there were crowds standing there. After the murder I saw the photograph of
a man Oscar Slater in the <i>Evening News</i>, and I thought there was
something similar between the features in the photograph and the man I had seen
at the comer. I went down on Sunday afternoon, 21st February, to the police
office, and I was taken into a room where there were a number of men. There was
a man there who bore a general resemblance to the one I saw. I did not identify
him positively, but there was a general resemblance to the man I had seen.
(Shown prisoner.) That is very like the man I saw.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; You do not go the length of saying
that there is more than a general resemblance? &mdash; No,</p>

  <p>I think you had fully as good an opportunity of seeing him as Miss
Cunningham, had you not? &mdash; Even better.</p>

  <p>Why? &mdash; I was next him. I was between Miss Cunningham and him.</p>

  <p>At the time you saw him was there anything in what the man was doing or
not doing that occurred to you as casting some suspicion upon him? &mdash;
Nothing further than that the man was standing there day after day at the same
spot, where I never saw a man standing &mdash; it is such a quiet locality.</p>

  <p>But he certainly was not screening himself from public observation?
&mdash; Not so far as I observed.</p>

  <p>He was there to be seen by anybody who passed down the street? &mdash;
That is so.</p><br>

  <p>ROBERT BROWN BRYSON, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a
cabinetmaker and live at Somerville Drive, Mount Florida. For a number of years
I was in the employment of Mr. Bruce Martin, cabinet-maker and upholsterer, at
Charing Cross, Glasgow. While there I was frequently employed in going to the
houses in West Princes Street and the district and doing work. I have been in
the house now occupied by Mr. Adams, and I have also been in Miss Gilchrist's
house, but it is twenty years ago. I was frequently in West Princes Street in
the course of my work and going to and from my work. It is a very quiet street.
I have seen the old lady several times at her window; I do not know that I have
seen her moving about. It is probably eight or ten years ago, more or less,
since I was in the way of going about there. She was living there then. On
Sunday, 20th December last, my wife and I were on our way from Mount Street,
off the New City Road, to Glassford Street to get a car, and we had occasion to
pass through Queen's Crescent into West Princes Street. The time was about 7.40
or 7.43 p.m. About that hour I was in West Princes Street, almost opposite Miss
Gilchrist's house. I had occasion to pass it. When there I observed a man
standing in an entry or close, on the stone part of the close at the front of
the front door. That close has a front door, and this man was standing on the
stone area which is the entrance to the close door. He was standing almost
directly opposite Miss Gilchrist's house &mdash; not exactly, but at a slight
angle from Miss Gilchrist's house or Adams' house. (Shown photograph No. 1,
looking towards St. George's Road.) This man was standing at the close where
the board is out, which is at a slight angle from Adams' house or Miss
Gilchrist's house. He was not standing against the door of the close; he was
standing, roughly speaking, 2 or 3 feet from the close door on the stonework
above the area. He was looking slightly towards the left &mdash; towards the
east. It was his looking at the windows of Miss Gilchrist's house that
attracted my attention. He was staring up at the windows, and I thought that
probably he was looking for some one or waiting on somebody. That was the whole
idea I took from it.</p>

  <p>Did his position and attitude excite your suspicion? &mdash; I naturally
looked at him and stared at him, because he was staring up at the windows, and
I thought that he was waiting for somebody, or that there was something
peculiar about it. I did not exactly think that there was anything further than
that. I accordingly took a very good look at him. I could see him quite well.
He saw me looking at him, and he took about two or three paces and stepped off
and passed me to my left, going westward. The close door was closed. I looked
after him as he walked away westward, and I turned round and looked at him till
he was perhaps half a dozen paces past me.</p>

  <p>Did it appear to you that he moved off because he saw you taking a good
look at him? &mdash; I thought that it was the fact of my staring at him that
made him go down from the step. I wondered at him coming down from the step. I
stared at him intensely. There was a light in Miss Gilchrist's house at the
time. She had Venetian blinds, and they were down. The two windows furthest
east were lit. There is a large square lamp at the comer of Queen's Crescent
and a very small lamp above Dr. Adams' door. The lamp at the comer is an
incandescent lamp, which gives a big light. It was a very clear, decent night
&mdash; not a wet night. I saw how the man was dressed. He was dressed in a
black coat and vest, as far as I could see, and I think that he had on older
trousers than the coat and vest, and he had a black boat hat. He had a slight
moustache with a slight droop, and not pointed or turned up. Otherwise he was
shaven. His gait or walk did not attract me particularly. I did not think that
he had a smart walk. He walked past very slowly and sluggishly. I was shown a
photograph of two men by Detective M'Gimpsey (No. 57). That is a photograph of
two men. M'Gimpsey came down and handed me that photograph, and he said, "Which
of these two men, or, rather, are either of the two men the least like the man
you saw in West Princes Street?" I looked at the photograph and I said, "Yes,
that is the man I saw in West Princes Street."</p>

  <p>Had you any difficulty in identifying him? &mdash; That is exactly what I
am telling you. On that Sunday night, 21st February, I went to the Central
Police Office in Glasgow, and was taken into a room where there were a number
of men. I was asked to point out a man whom I saw on the step. I was asked if I
could point out the man, or if any of these men was the least like the man I
had seen, and I pointed out the man whom I saw in West Princes Street. I
pointed him out as the man I saw there. (Shown prisoner.) That is the man I saw
in West Princes Street on the Sunday night.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I think Mrs. Bryson was along with
you? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>I think you spoke to her about the man? &mdash; I do not know whether I
said anything particular.</p>

  <p>Is it the case that, in the statement you made, you made a remark
specially as to his appearance? &mdash; I do not think I made any remark about
his appearance, but I think I said that he was looking for a lady love or
something. His intentions were not particularly good. I think I said something
like that. As to his appearance, I do not think I mentioned that.</p>

  <p>I do not like to make suggestions, but did he look to you as if he might
be a man hanging about waiting for his sweetheart? &mdash; He looked to me as I
have explained, and I think the remark I passed to Mrs. Bryson was that he was
after a sweetheart, or after no good intentions.</p>

  <p>But which did you think? &mdash; I think the latter was the more likely
&mdash; that he was after no good intentions.</p>

  <p>Why do you say that? &mdash; Because he seemed taken when I stared at him
to such an extent. It was from the fact of me staring at him. He walked down
and walked away as if he took guilt to himself. That is the only answer I can
give you.</p>

  <p>Guilt of waiting for a girl or what? &mdash; I cannot tell you what was
in the man's mind, but I think he was after no good intentions.</p>

  <p>You thought that he looked ashamed of himself? &mdash; I do. I think he
was taken &mdash; whatever he was after I do not know.</p>

  <p>Is it the case that you recalled this remark to Mrs. Bryson, and she
could not say any such thing? &mdash; I do not think she paid any attention,
because I spoke to her and she could not recollect what I said to her.</p>

  <p>Is it the fact that Mrs. Bryson has no recollection of having passed a
man at this place, and has no recollection of you having made a remark to her
about it? &mdash; She has no recollection. I do not think she has any
recollection particularly about me having passed any remark regarding the
man.</p>

  <p>Or having seen the man at all? &mdash; I never asked her upon that
point.</p>

  <p>Is it not the fact that she does not remember any man being there?
&mdash; I do not know whether she remembers any man being there or not. I spoke
to her casually, but I do not think she could recall anything about it.</p>

  <p>Is it the case that she says that she does not remember any man being
there? &mdash; It is the case thus far, that she does not remember me having
said anything about it at all. It is quite out of her memory.</p>

  <p>But you see the further point I am making? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did she not say that she did not remember passing any man at all? &mdash;
No, she does not remember distinctly about me passing any remark.</p>

  <p>Do you say that she does remember passing this man? &mdash; I say that
she does not remember anything about that remark being passed.</p>

  <p>Nor about the man being there? &mdash; I do not say that.</p>

  <p>But is it not the fact that the mental position of your wife on this
subject is that she does not remember a man being passed, and she does not
remember you making any remark? &mdash; She does not remember particularly me
passing any remark regarding the man or anything else. She has taken no notice
of my remark seemingly.</p>

  <p>Nor of the man? &mdash; Well, according to that, if you put it in that
fashion, I say that she does not remember me passing any remark.</p>

  <p>Can I not get you past that? &mdash; No, I do not think so.</p>

  <p>Had you ever seen the man before? &mdash; Never in my life.</p>

  <p>How long did it take you to pass him? &mdash; Probably six paces &mdash;
three on either side of him.</p>

  <p>You did not observe the man till you were three paces on? &mdash; No, I
was six paces from the corner of Queen's Crescent.</p>

  <p>Is it the case that you did not see him till you were about 3 yards from
him? &mdash; No, it would be the corner of Queen's Crescent, and it is about
six paces or fully that from the corner. I observed him four or five paces from
that. I was walking slowly.</p>

  <p>The man came down and walked to meet you; did he meet you before you had
reached the close from which he emerged? &mdash; About a pace or so. I met him
about 4 feet from the close.</p>

  <p>May I take it that what happened is this, that when you were about four
paces off him he immediately came down from the step and passed you? &mdash;
About four paces before I came to the close I stared at him, and by the time I
got one pace he was coming down during that time, and I was staring at him all
the time.</p>

  <p>The man was only standing on the step inside the railings when you saw
him? &mdash; No, he was standing on the sandstone, the plat of the entrance,
which is about 7 feet in from the area. The area bridge is the phrase, I
understand.</p>

  <p>Whom did you first communicate with about this? &mdash; I mentioned it in
the place where I am employed.</p>

  <p>At what date? &mdash; On the Tuesday after the Sunday it happened.</p>

  <p>Did you observe that the man had a foreign appearance? &mdash; Yes, it
struck me that he had a slightly foreign appearance.</p>

  <p>Was that what struck you? &mdash; Yes, his sallow complexion and his
peculiar appearance, and his staring up at the windows.</p>

  <p>Would you have thought anything about it if he had not been staring at
the windows? &mdash; No, I do not think I would.</p>

  <p>Was it because there had been a murder at Miss Gilchrist's that you were
suspicious that a man should have been looking at the windows? &mdash; I merely
mentioned the fact when I heard about the thing.</p>

  <p>You suspected him of nothing except of intense staring, which might have
been directed to any other house? &mdash; The intense staring was at that
house.</p>

  <p>Which windows was he looking at? &mdash; The windows furthest east, which
were lit. The Venetian blinds were down, and one could see a glimmer of light
through the Venetian blinds.</p>

  <p>Did you observe that as you came round Queen's Crescent? &mdash; No, when
I saw him staring I looked at what he was staring at. I stared at him, looked
up at the windows, and then looked at him.</p>

  <p>And at that time was he coming down? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Are there six windows facing the street in Miss Gilchrist's house?
&mdash; I never counted them, but I think there will be six or so. These are
the two windows furthest away from Adams' house &mdash; past the close, next to
the other tenement.</p>

  <p>But had you time, in the glance which you gave across the street, to take
stock of the fact that there were only lights in two windows out of six?
&mdash; I had.</p>

  <p>And while you were making this observation your attention was directed
from the man standing on the street? &mdash; Just a glance as I looked back.</p>

  <p>Do you remember the appearance of anybody you passed on the street going
home that night? &mdash; Do you mean in West Princes Street?</p>

  <p>Any street &mdash; do you remember the appearance of any of the passers-
by? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is that somebody you knew? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you pass a number of people that night? &mdash; I must have passed a
considerable number. One does not pass along a street without passing
people.</p>

  <p>But do you recollect the appearance of any of these people? &mdash; Yes,
I recollect the appearance of one man I passed in West Princes Street.</p>

  <p>Do you mean the one you were talking of? &mdash; No, you were asking me
about other people. It was a little gentleman that I met &mdash; the only party
that I passed after I passed the close. He was another man, who was out taking
a smoke.</p>

  <p>Was he observing any windows? &mdash; No, he was away down at the foot of
West Princes Street, near St. George's Road.</p>

  <p>Would you recognise him again? &mdash; I would.</p>

  <p>Do you remember what his clothes were like? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is that the only man you remember? &mdash; The only man in West Princes
Street.</p>

  <p>Do you say that you have an accurate recollection of the people you meet
on the street, and can describe them by having seen them with a rapid glance?
&mdash; It is not a very difficult thing, passing down the street the length of
West Princes Street and not another living soul in it except myself and my
wife, when you meet a man, or see a man standing in a close, and taking a
thorough good look at that man &mdash; I do not think it is very difficult; and
if you only meet another man between that and the end of West Princes Street
you can remember him.</p>

  <p>But do you say that innocent passers-by become photographed in your brain
so as to enable you to describe their clothes and walk afterwards? &mdash; I
do not photograph anybody particularly in my brain, nor am I an expert of what
people wear or do not wear; but I am talking of this particular person and as
to how I saw him. I do not say that I would come out of West Princes Street and
go into St. George's Road and state what the first fifty men I meet wear. I
would not pay particular attention in an ordinary thoroughfare; but it was in
such a quiet street that it was almost impossible for me or any other person to
pass a man or woman without noticing them, particularly if they were taking up
their attention with any particular object.</p>

  <p>And you take in the details of the dress? &mdash; There is not much
detail necessary to tell whether a man has a black coat and a hat.</p>

  <p>Any boots? &mdash; I never looked at his boots.</p>

  <p>But you were sure that it was a black coat and vest? Was it a tail coat
or a jacket? &mdash; I do not know -whether it was a tail coat or a jacket
&mdash; I would not swear to that.</p>

  <p>Was there an overcoat? &mdash; No, there was no overcoat.</p>

  <p>Now, when you went on to the police office you knew the purpose for which
you had gone was to identify Slater as the man you had seen in West Princes
Street? &mdash; Yes, I was asked to come down on the Sabbath night.</p>

  <p>And you had seen Slater's photograph, shown you by M'Gimpsey, before
that? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What was the date on which he showed you the photograph? &mdash; I could
not tell you. I never paid any attention to it.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; About how long before you went down to the police
office was it? &mdash; I think about a fortnight.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; Can you tell when you went to the
police office? &mdash; No, I do not remember the date.</p>

  <p>When you went down were you shown into a room where there was a number of
men? &mdash; I was shown into a large room where there was a number of men.</p>

  <p>Were you told that the man was there that you were to look for among
them? &mdash; No, I was not told that he was amongst them, but I naturally
expected he would be.</p>

  <p>What did the policeman say to you? &mdash; The detective officer said,
"Look amongst these men there and see if you can recognise anybody the least
like the man you saw in West Princes Street."</p>

  <p>Were you down on the same day as any of the other witnesses who have been
here? &mdash; Yes, on the Sunday. There were several witnesses.</p>

  <p>Was Mrs. M'Haffie there? &mdash; I don't know them by name, but there
were several witnesses.</p>

  <p>Among the people in the room when you were asked to look round were there
any of foreign appearance except Slater? &mdash; I do not know how many men
there would be.</p>

  <p>Were any of them of foreign appearance except Slater? &mdash; Yes, there
were some of them of foreign appearance.</p>

  <p>How many foreigners? &mdash; I do not know whether you call it foreign
appearance, but some of them had the same sort of way. I saw various types of
sallow complexion, and black moustaches, and broken noses.</p>

  <p>Were there any policemen amongst the men whom you inspected? &mdash; If
there were they were not much credit to the force. I think they were all small-
looking persons. They were not policemen.</p>

  <p>I want to ask you &mdash; do you say that there were policemen amongst
them or not? &mdash; Do you think that I would know whether they were policemen
or not?</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Did you know a number of them or any of them were
policemen? &mdash; No, I did not. I do not know who the men were at all.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; How many men in the room were of
foreign appearance? &mdash; I think, out of the number of men I saw, I am quite
sure there would be three or four with sallow complexions and black moustaches.
I do not say they were of foreign appearance.</p>

  <p>Were any of the people except Slater people of foreign appearance, or
were any of the people the least like Slater? &mdash; Yes, there were one or
two not unlike him.</p>

  <p>Had you any trouble in identifying him? &mdash; None whatever.</p>

  <p>Although they were like him? &mdash; None whatever, although they were
very like him.</p>

  <p>How many were very like him? &mdash; Those four that had sallow faces and
black moustaches. I would say that there were at least four.</p>

  <p>You were able, however, to discard the four people that you have
mentioned, and to select Slater. What enabled you to do that? &mdash; The man's
face was so vividly printed on my mind from the Sabbath night &mdash; that was
it.</p>

  <p>That is all you can say? &mdash; That is how I identified him.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me when you saw these four men what clothes they had on?
&mdash; The whole of the men were dressed in plain civilian clothes.</p>

  <p>Light or dark? &mdash; I think they were, most of them, in dark clothes.
I do not say that they were, but as far as my memory serves me the bulk of the
men that I saw were all in dark clothing.</p>

  <p>Was Slater in dark clothing? &mdash; He was.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me what he was wearing on the night you identified him?
&mdash; I think he had on a black coat and vest.</p>

  <p>Are you sure? &mdash; The garments that he had on were dark. It was not
the man's clothing that I was taken to identify; it was his face.</p>

  <p>Had he a tail coat or a jacket? &mdash; That I won't swear to.</p>

  <p>What trousers had he on on the Sunday night? &mdash; That I won't swear
to. It was the man's face; I never looked at his garments. He had a dark
garment, but whether it was a coat or jacket I cannot say.</p>

  <p>How is it if you cannot remember what clothes were worn by Slater when
you saw him in February, after he came back from America, that you were so
positive as to the clothes he was wearing when you saw him for a few seconds on
the Sunday night? &mdash; I am not going to commit myself by swearing that he
had a coat and vest the night that I identified him, but he had on a dark coat
or jacket. I did not pay any attention to what he had on in the police office
because I had no occasion. It was the man's face that I was taken to
identify.</p>

  <p>Was the light in the police office when you went to identify him much
better than the light in West Princes Street, and should you not have had a
better view? &mdash; Yes, but you do not take such a look at a man's coat as to
whether it is a coat or a jacket. It is in my mind that it was a coat on the
Sunday night, but I won't swear to it. I won't commit myself.</p>

  <p>If your recollection is so vivid as to the clothes worn by a man on 20th
December, why should you forget the details of the clothing of a person that
you saw in a better light in the end of February, when you had longer time for
observation? &mdash; That is one way of putting it, why I should forget. I was
not so much interested in the coat or jacket. It was a dark garment that he had
on, and that is all I can say. I won't swear to whether it is a coat or a
jacket.&mdash;</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Had the man that you saw on the platform anything in
his hand? &mdash; No, he had nothing. He was standing with his hands at his
back.</p><br>

  <p>ANDREW NAIRN, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a provision
merchant in Glasgow. On Sunday, 20th December last, I was returning home by
Queen's Crescent from visiting some friends. My wife and children were
following at some good distance behind. It was a quarter past nine o'clock.
When I entered Queen's Crescent I proceeded westwards to West Princes Street,
and I stood there for fully five minutes to wait for my wife and children
coming up. I would be about 120 yards from Miss Gilchrist's house. I was on the
right hand side of West Princes Street coming down. That was on the opposite
side from Miss Gilchrist's house. When I was standing there my attention was
attracted by a man standing at the corner of the gardens, in the middle of the
pavement, with his back to me, looking in the direction of Miss Gilchrist's
house. The man was in West Princes Street. I just saw his back at that time. He
was on the north side of West Princes Street too. He seemed to be waiting for
somebody. I did not see his face.</p>

  <p>Did you see whether he kept his face away from you or not? &mdash; His
face was directed in the one position the whole time, standing a little on the
angle, looking that way (witness illustrated by turning sideways). I did not
see any part of his face. He was about 13 yards away from me. There was a good
light. He had on a light coat, about 2 inches underneath the knee at the back.
He was broad shouldered, and a little long in the neck, and had black hair. He
had what I would call a motor cap, with the flaps up, and a broad back. I stood
observing him for some time, till my wife and children came up. That was about
five minutes. During that time the man continued standing and looking in the
direction of Miss Gilchrist's house.</p>

  <p>Could you tell whether he had observed you or not? &mdash; No, he could
not. When my wife and children came up I went on my way. I made a remark to my
wife, pointing my finger. I said, "There's a man standing there watching."</p>

  <p>Did it occur to you that there was anything suspicious about him? &mdash;
What caused me to suspect the man was that we had had one or two cases of
housebreaking round about our district a fortnight before, and it was that
which caused me to stand and look. I afterwards pointed out the place where I
saw this man standing to Detective Pyper and to Detective Dornan. I think that
was about three weeks or so afterwards; it might be fully that. I could see
Miss Gilchrist's house from the spot. I had a grand view of the house; there is
a lamp-post nearly opposite Miss Gilchrist's entrance, and there is a brass
plate &mdash; Mr. Adams' brass plate &mdash; on the other side, and the
reflection of the light strikes the brass plate, and it meets and throws the
reflection down, which causes a good light at Miss Gilchrist's door.</p>

  <p>Did you notice whether that was the best spot from which to observe Miss
Gilchrist's house? &mdash; Yes, it was a splendid view of the place &mdash; a
grand view. I moved on when my wife and children came up. When I went away, the
man was still standing there, and at the corner of Cumberland Street I turned
round, and he was still standing in the same place and looking in the same
direction. On Monday, 22nd February last, I went to the Central Police Office,
and I there identified the man; I am certain that he is the man that I saw that
night. There were a good number of officials here and there about the room when
I identified him.</p>

  <p>But you pointed out the man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Will you look at the prisoner. Is that the man you saw? (To
accused)&mdash; You might turn your back. Yes, I am certain that that is the
man I saw.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Do you call that a long-necked man
(pointing to accused)? &mdash; I don't mean exactly a man with an ordinary
neck.</p>

  <p>You said a longish neck? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Has this man got a longish neck? &mdash; He has got the average man's
neck.</p>

  <p>When you spoke of a longish neck, did you mean something longer than the
average? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Have most men got longish necks? &mdash; No; I did not mean a short
neck.</p>

  <p>You mean one that was not the average, which was on the long side of the
average? &mdash; It depends very much on the collar that the man wears.</p>

  <p>Name us anything else by which you identify this man who stood with his
back to you? &mdash; Broad shoulders, black hair.</p>

  <p>Anything else? &mdash; No, that was all.</p>

  <p>Do I take it, then, that if you see a broad-shouldered man with a longish
neck, at 9.15 on a December evening, at a distance of 13 yards, without seeing
his face at all, you are able to be positive about his identification? &mdash;
It was a frosty, clear night, and the light round about is fairly good; there
are two lamp-posts within a radius of 13 or 14 yards with incandescent light,
which give a very fair light.</p>

  <p>You heard the question I put. Are you positive of your identification of
a man whom you only saw once, he being a man you had never seen before, and you
only saw his back at a distance of 13 yards, on a December night, at 9.15, that
man, being upon his trial for murder. I want you to be fair. &mdash; Well, I am
certain that it is the same man that I saw.</p>

  <p>And that is because he has broad shoulders, a neck of the description you
have given, and black hair? &mdash; Being suspicious, I certainly gave the man
a good look.</p>

  <p>Suspicious of what? &mdash; We had numbers of oases of housebreaking
round about our district, I think three or four in the fortnight before that,
and that was what caused me to look at the man.</p>

  <p>Do you consider you are quite fair in swearing positively to the man,
when you never saw whether his eyes were blue or brown, and whether he had any
hair on his face? &mdash; I cannot swear about his face, not having seen his
face.</p>

  <p>Have you ever gone up behind a man in the street, thinking he was a
person you knew, and clapped him on the shoulder, and then discovered you had
made a mistake? &mdash; Not to my knowledge, but I know it has happened.</p>

  <p>And the only way of knowing whether it is a man's friend or not is to see
his face. How can you, on the face of that, swear positively to a man in a
murder trial whose face you have never seen at all? &mdash; Oh, I will not
swear in fact, but I am certain that he was the man I saw; but I will not
swear.</p>

  <p>If you are upon your oath, and state you are certain it is the man, are
you not aware you are swearing to it? &mdash; Yes, to a certain extent, but I
will not swear, not seeing the man's face, that he is the man.</p>

  <p>Then, do I understand now that, after all you have said, your
identification is not positive? &mdash; Oh, well, I would not go that length.
You will not go the length of being positive? &mdash; No.</p><br>

  <p>ELIZABETH DONALDSON, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am house-
keeper to Mr. Edward Gillies, a stockbroker, at 46 West Princes Street,
Glasgow. The house is up one stair, and it is directly opposite the house of
Miss Gilchrist. I recollect on several occasions before the night of Miss
Gilchrist's murder the stair gas at the landing at our door was turned out. It
had been done before several times. On the night of the murder, 21st December,
I found the gas turned off. I re-lit the gas.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; As I understand, all you can say is
that on the night of the 21st December the gas on the stair was out at 6.50?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And on the 13th of February it was out again? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Who put it out on either occasion you do not know? &mdash; I do not
knoW'.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether it was lighted on either occasion first? &mdash;
No.</p><br>

  <p>ALEXANDER GILLIES, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a
manufacturer in Glasgow, and reside at 46 West Princes Street. My house is
directly opposite where Miss Gilchrist lived. It is one flight up. On
Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday of the week before the murder I was returning
home about a quarter to six. As I was about to enter the close I observed a man
standing there, at the back of the close, at the foot of the stair. The close
door was open at the time.</p>

  <p>Was the man standing in the middle of the passage, about half-way up to
the first flight? &mdash; He walked up there after I entered the close. He was
a stranger to the close. I tried to get past him. When I did so he rather
blocked my passage. He turned his back to me, and instead of allowing me to
pass, he sort of blocked the passage, and the stair not being wide enough, I
had to ask him to allow me to pass. Instead of allowing me to pass he walked up
the second flight of stairs, and again blocked my passage in the same fashion,
and at that time I had again to ask him to allow me to pass, and I got past
then. When I got up to my own landing, the man was still. standing on the
steps. His face was towards me. "When I put my latch key in the door and opened
it he was still standing. I have not seen him again since that night, to my
knowledge. He had a long fawn-coloured coat on, and a cap; otherwise I really
cannot say anything about him. He was sallow, and had dark hair. He was about 5
feet 8 inches in height. He was clean shaven. On the 1st of March I went to
Duke Street Prison and I saw the prisoner there. He resembled the man I saw on
the stair, but I cannot say it was the same man. (Shown prisoner.)</p>

  <p>Is that like the man? &mdash; He resembles the man, but I cannot say it
is the same man. I had observed the gas on the stair turned off several times
before the murder. On one or two occasions shortly after the murder I have
observed that, and during the last fortnight it has occurred several times.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Of course, as regards the later
occasions you do not suspect the prisoner at the bar; he has been in jail.
&mdash; I cannot suspect him at all.</p>

  <p>Who turned out the gas you have no notion? &mdash; I have not; I did not
see it turned out; I have seen the gas out when I came in, when it should have
been in.</p><br>

  <p>FREDERICK NICHOLS, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I was a hairdresser
with R.S. Bamber, hairdresser at Charing Cross, Glasgow, at the end of last
year. I remember on the 16th of November last a German coming to get shaved. He
did not say at the time where he belonged to; he said he came from America, as
I understood. He bought some things at our place. I asked his name in order to
put it on the bottles, and he wrote it on himself; he put on Mr. Anderson. He
did not give any address. At that time he had a moustache. After the 16th of
November he came in several times a week, up till the 25th of December. On
these occasions he was shaved by me. The last time that I shaved him was on
Christmas Day. On that date he left, taking with him his bottles and his
shaving utensils. He did not give me any address.</p>

  <p>On Christmas Day when he came to you what like was his upper lip, was
there any sign of a moustache there? &mdash; Yes, a very short moustache. I
should say it had been growing for about a fortnight &mdash; a little more than
a fortnight. It was about &frac14; inch or 5-16ths long.</p>

  <p>About a fortnight before Christmas, on one occasion when he came into
your premises, had you noticed whether he had made any change in his appearance
from the time you had seen him just before? &mdash; Yes. He had had his
moustache shaved off. That was about a fortnight before Christmas as near as I
could say. When he came in I passed some jocular remark about him having his
moustache off, and I said he looked rather comical with it off, and that was
all the remark that I passed. I shaved his upper lip that day. That was the
only occasion I shaved it; I did not take his moustache off; it was off
previous to him coming in that morning. I had shaved him before that, although
I had never touched his moustache. I had a talk with him upon what line of
business he was in. He said he was a dentist. He said he was expecting to start
business, but he was waiting for his partner coming.</p>

  <p>From where? &mdash; Well, he mentioned several places. He mentioned
Queensland and San Francisco, and I understood he was expecting one coming from
either the one or the other of these two places. On one occasion, I should say
from about three weeks to a month before Christmas, he wanted to sell me some
blankets, curtains, and kitchen furniture. He said they were quite new. I
remember him calling on one occasion, either on the 22nd or the 23rd of
December, to get shaved. He said that he was going away to Queensland. I
understood him to say in that week, on the Wednesday, that was somewhere about
Wednesday, the 30th. He did not say anything as to his taking his passage, but
I understood he was to sail on the following Wednesday. I asked if his wife was
going. He said not at the present time; the weather was too cold, and she was
going to follow in the summer time.</p>

  <p>Did he mention anything about the Sloper Club to you on one occasion?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What did he say about that? &mdash; He was talking about being able to
get a shave on Sundays, and I understood him to say he could get one there or
at the Central Hotel. I did not know what the Sloper Club was or where it was.
On another occasion, in the first week of December, he mentioned that he had
lost a diamond pin. He said he was sorry that he had lost it, and I advised him
to go to the police about it, and he said it was best to leave them alone as
much as you could.</p>

  <p>Could you give me a description of the man? &mdash; I would say he was a
well-built man with broad shoulders, about 5 feet 8 inches or 5 feet 8&frac12;
inches in height. There was a peculiarity about his nose. I would not describe
it as a twisted nose; I would describe it as a nose that had been broken.</p>

  <p>Were you shown the prisoner in Glasgow Police Office on 21st February?
&mdash; I would not say what date; it was the day he arrived back from New
York.</p>

  <p>You can take it from me it was the 21st of February; could you identify
him as the man you have been talking of in your evidence? &mdash; Yes, Mr.
Anderson. I had no doubt about it. The prisoner is the man.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I think you have got a better
reason for knowing that the prisoner is the man. Did he not tell you that he
was going abroad on the 25th of December? &mdash; He came in on the 25th of
December and said he was going by the "Lusitania."</p>

  <p>He told you he was leaving Glasgow that night? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>On the 25th of December, and that he was going to travel to New York by
the "Lusitania"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Of course, you know that the "Lusitania" does not go to Queensland, do
you not? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>It is for New York? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Must you not have gathered that his destination was not Queensland, but
New York? &mdash; Yes, I knew that on the Friday, on the Christmas Day, when,
he told me he was sailing on the Saturday.</p>

  <p>It was on the 22nd or 23rd that he mentioned Queensland? &mdash; Yes. He
said he had a partner there that he had written for, and that he was going to
start business. He mentioned about San Francisco also.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he was going to San Francisco and not to Queensland
when he spoke to you on the 22nd or the 23rd? &mdash; I did not know which
place he was going to; he mentioned both of them.</p>

  <p>Do you think you cannot have been mistaken about that? &mdash; No, I do
not think I can; he mentioned both places distinctly.</p>

  <p>On the 22nd or 23rd, did he mention San Francisco? &mdash; Yes, about
that date he did.</p>

  <p>And then he told you on the Friday, the 25th, that he was travelling by
the "Lusitania," and leaving Glasgow that night? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>For Liverpool? &mdash; He did not say for where, but he was travelling by
the "Lusitania."</p>

  <p>And that day he lifted his materials from your shop? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Tell me what apparatus he had? &mdash; His shaving brush, soap, sponge,
pot, and hair brush.</p>

  <p>Does it come to this, that in the earlier days of his acquaintance you
sold him a full shaving equipment? &mdash; No, he had it with him. I sold him
two bottles, one for his hair and one for his face.</p>

  <p>Then he deposited his own shaving equipment at your shop? &mdash; He
brought it from his house a week or so later.</p>

  <p>As he was leaving on the Friday for Liverpool he got them all back again?
&mdash; He took everything with him.</p>

  <p>Was the moustache which he had when you saw him during that week quite
noticeable? &mdash; Well, it was quite noticeable to me.</p>

  <p>His hair is very black? &mdash; Yes, rather black.</p>

  <p>And grows speedily? &mdash; Yes, it grows very quickly about the chin
&mdash; not so quickly about the upper lip. I had a good opportunity of seeing
him.</p>

  <p>Then do I take it that your evidence is that about a fortnight before
Miss Gilchrist was murdered he had had his upper lip shaved? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>But that from that date it had grown? &mdash; He had it shaved at night,
and I shaved it the next day, and it was growing after that.</p>

  <p>And the time you shaved it was about a fortnight before the 25th of
December? &mdash; About ten days or a fortnight.</p>

  <p>Before that week which we have been discussing had Slater informed you
that he was going abroad, without mentioning his destination? &mdash; He had
mentioned that business in Glasgow was very quiet; he thought that he would
clear out of it, that he could do better elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me how long it was before the 25th December that he said
that? &mdash; Probably about a month before.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; What kind of business did you understand him to
refer to? &mdash; A dentist's.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; When he said he was going away to New
York by the "Lusitania," did he speak to you quite freely? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you see during that week when he was attending your shop, on the 22nd
or 23rd, and again on the 25th, any sign of excitement about him? &mdash; None
in the least.</p>

  <p>Did you see any difference in him from the previous time he had been in
your shop being shaved? &mdash; Only as regards his dress.</p>

  <p>What was that? &mdash; He had a peculiar kind of vest on that I had never
seen on before; bar that there was nothing else.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; What sort of dress did he usually wear
when he came to your place? &mdash; Generally a full suit.</p>

  <p>Did he come in different suits sometimes? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he sometimes have an overcoat and sometimes not? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Have you seen him wearing a light fawn-coloured overcoat? &mdash; No, not
to my knowledge.</p>

  <p>Have you seen him wearing a dark blue overcoat? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When he told you he was going on the "Lusitania" on Christmas Day, was
that the first you had heard of his going away by the "Lusitania"? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>And was it when he was getting his shaving things from you that he gave
you that explanation, or when was it? &mdash; During the time that I was
shaving him.</p>

  <p>Did he give any reason why he was going by the "Lusitania"? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Can you tell us just what he said about that? &mdash; He just said that
he was going away that night, that there was nothing in Glasgow, there was no
money stirring in Glasgow, and he was going away that night to go by the
"Lusitania" on the Saturday.</p>

  <p>Did you ask him where he was going to? &mdash; Not that I know of.</p>

  <p>Did you know where he was going to? &mdash; Not that I know of; I had no
knowledge.</p>

  <p>Re-cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Except to New York, by the
"Lusitania"? &mdash; I did not know he was going to New York; I knew he was
going by the "Lusitania," but I did not know his destination.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Can you tell me how near the time of the murder it
was that you saw the prisoner? The murder was on Monday, 21st December? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>How near can you come to the date before that when you saw him? &mdash;
About the Friday.</p>

  <p>The 18th or so? &mdash; Yes; about that time.</p>

  <p>Then, after 21st December, Monday, what was the next? &mdash; Well, I
would not be sure whether it was the Tuesday or Wednesday; it was one or other
of these two days.</p>

  <p>Did you see the photographs in the papers of Oscar Slater? &mdash; I saw
the photograph after I had given my evidence.</p><br>

  <p>HELEN LAMBIE, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a domestic
servant. I was in the service of Miss Gilchrist for three years and two months
before the date of her murder. She and I were the only occupants of the house.
The house was one of six apartments and a kitchen, the apartments being a
dining-room, a drawing-room, parlour, and two bedrooms. Both the bedrooms look
to the back court, and one of them is a larger room than the other. The dining-
room and the drawing-room look out on West Princes Street. Miss Gilchrist had
not very many visitors. There were some business gentlemen who came to the
house. The most frequent visitor was Mrs. Ferguson, an old servant. Miss
Gilchrist always slept alone. I know that she had a great many jewels. (Shown
production No. 20.) Miss Gilchrist did not keep jewels in that box; she kept
papers and accounts there. She had that box (No. 20) on the dressing table in
one of her bedrooms. She kept her jewels in her wardrobe in her bedroom. She
wore jewels every day, usually a ring and a brooch. She sometimes wore more
than one ring. When she went out to tea and to dinner she wore more jewels. It
was the usual practice for me to go out errands in the evening. I usually went
out on my errands about six o'clock, and sometimes a little later. The house is
one storey up, and the outer door is on the stair landing. The door on the
stair landing is secured by a common lock, a patent lock, and a Chubb. When I
went out on my errands I left the door on these two locks, and I took the keys
with me. The locks I left the door on were the two upper locks. These two upper
locks are shown in the photograph No. 5. There is a door to the entrance to the
close, and that was usually kept closed on a check lock. The entrance to the
close is about four or five steps up from the level of the pavement. The door
at the entrance of the close is opened by raising a handle inside the house.
There was no one living above us at the time of Miss Gilchrist's murder; we
were the only people inside the close. On 21st December a girl friend of mine
paid a visit to the house; she was the only visitor that day. Miss Gilchrist
rose out of bed that day about twelve o'clock, and she was out of doors in the
afternoon and returned about 4.30. I went out for a newspaper that night, and I
had some other messages to do after that. Miss Gilchrist gave me Id. for the
newspaper and 10s. for the other messages. I looked at the kitchen clock just
before I went out and I saw that it was just seven o'clock. I intended to go
for the newspaper first and come back to the house, and then go out again for
my other messages; I had done that before. I went to St. George's Road for the
newspaper. Before leaving the house I saw Miss Gilchrist sitting on a chair at
the dining-room table, with her back to the fire. She had her spectacles on and
was reading. There was an incandescent light lit in the dining-room, and there
was a light lit in the lobby. There was no light in the bedroom. I went into
the dining-room and saw Miss Gilchrist just before I left, and it was then that
she gave me the money. I recollect laying down the half-sovereign on the
dining-room table before I left. I intended to get it when I came back with the
paper. I had to go to St. George's Road for the newspaper. It would take me
about three minutes to walk from the house to the newspaper shop in St.
George's Road. It usually took me ten minutes from the time I left the house
till I got back with the newspaper. Miss Gilchrist knew that that was my
practice. I noticed the light in the lobby as I left. When I went out I closed
the door on the two locks and took the two checks with me. I closed the door at
the stair foot. It was raining when I went out. When I left the house I did not
go straight to the newspaper shop in St. George's Road. I spoke for a minute or
two to a constable in plain clothes whom I met at the comer of West Princes
Street and St. George's Road. When I bought the newspaper I went straight back
to the house. I would be away from the house about ten minutes altogether. I
did not see anybody except the constable in West Princes Street when I walked
along to St. George's Road. West Princes Street is a very quiet street. When I
got back to the house I noticed that the door at the close mouth was open, and
was not as I had left it. I went upstairs. I did not have to use my check to
open the door. I saw a wet footmark on two of the steps when I got inside the
door. I had not observed that when I was coming down before. The footmark was
on the two steps nearest the close. When I got up to the landing I found Mr.
Adams there, a neighbour who lived down below. He was never a visitor at the
house, and I was astonished to find him there. He said to me that there was a
noise in our house, and that the ceiling was like to crack. The house door was
locked. I unlocked it with my keys. I said to Mr. Adams before I went in, "Oh,
it would be the pulleys." By the pulleys I meant the clothes-lines in the
kitchen. We had an arrangement for drying the clothes in the kitchen,
consisting of lines and pulleys. Mr. Adams said that he would wait and see if
everything was all right. When I unlocked the door I saw a man coming, and I
stepped back. The man was coming from the direction of the spare bedroom. I saw
that the light was lit in the spare bedroom. It was not lit when I left the
house. The light in the lobby was still lit. The man came through the hall and
passed me, and went downstairs. I then went into the kitchen and saw that
everything was right there. I -went into the bedroom. It was all right there.
Then I went into the dining-room and saw Miss Gilchrist lying on the rug in
front of the fire. The rug was over her head. I did not see her face. I went
out and told Mr. Adams that something was wrong, that the man had done
something to Miss Gilchrist. Mr. Adams had stood behind me when I unlocked the
door. The man, when he passed me, was very close to me. I noticed that he held
his head down. When he passed me I turned round to look at him, and I got a
good look at him. I heard him going down the stairs. He did not go down
rapidly; he went deliberately. I went instantly into the house. The man, when I
saw him first, was coming from the direction of Miss Gilchrist's bedroom. He
had nothing in his hand. He was wearing a dark cap, a fawn overcoat, and dark
trousers. I did not notice what else he was wearing. His coat was open. He was
about 5 feet 7 or 5 feet 8 high. No. 43 of the productions is the coat that he
wore. I am not sure about the cap he wore, but it was dark. He did not say
anything as he passed, I noticed his walk; he was forward a little. I noticed a
peculiarity about his walk; it was a little shaky. When I saw my mistress lying
on the floor with the rug over her, I ran downstairs, and then I stood on the
steps when I got down. Mr. Adams also ran downstairs, and then he went in the
direction of Queen's Crescent. I saw Mr. Adams' sisters come out, and I told
them what had happened. I did not see any trace of the man when I got
downstairs. When I returned to the house I saw Constable Neill there. I did not
go straight back to the house; I went and told Miss Birrell, a niece of Miss
Gilchrist's, what had happened. Dr. Adams was summoned. There were several
people in the house when I got back. Later in the evening Detective Pyper asked
me to go into the dining-room, and I then saw my mistress's body exactly as I
had seen it when I first went in. Her head was near the fender and her feet
were towards the door. She was quite dead. Next day I identified her body in
presence of Dr. Glaister and Dr. Galt. I did not find anything out of its place
in the dining-room. After going into the dining-room I went into the spare
bedroom, and I saw the box there with the papers. The papers had been taken out
of the box and were scattered about on the floor. I never saw anybody visiting
the house the least like the man who came out of the bedroom when I opened the
door that night. That night I missed a brooch that belonged to Miss Gilchrist.
The brooch was usually kept in a small open dish on a dressing table in the
bedroom. It was a diamond crescent brooch, and about the size of half a crown.
I saw it in the dish on the Sunday, the day before the murder. I saw beside it
a gold and diamond ring which was left, while the brooch was taken. I mentioned
to the detectives that night that I had observed that the brooch had
disappeared. Miss Gilchrist had that brooch all the time I was in her service,
and she sometimes wore it during the day. On 12th January I left Glasgow along
with Mr. Adams, a girl Barrowman, Mr. Warnock, and Detective-Inspector Pyper.
We sailed by the S.S. "Baltic" for New York, and we arrived there on 25th
January. On 26th January I attended at the Law Courts, along with Detective-
Inspector Pyper, Mr. Adams, Mr. Warnock, and the girl Barrowman. I remember
standing in a corridor there along with Detective-Inspector Pyper, Mr. Adams,
the girl Barrowman, and Mr. Warnock.</p>

  <p>Do you remember whether Mr. Warnock and Mr. Adams went into the Court-
room before you? &mdash; I think Mr. Warnock went in, but I could not say for
Mr. Adams. The girl Barrowman and Detective-Inspector Pyper remained with me.
When I was standing in the corridor, and before I went into the Court, I saw
three men coming along the corridor. I had a good view of them. They passed
me.</p>

  <p>Did you say anything to Inspector Pyper when you saw the three men?
&mdash; No.</p>

  <p>When they passed you did you say anything to him? &mdash; Yes. I said,
"There is the man that passed me in the hall." He was one of the three men. I
recognised him by his height and his walk. When I saw him he had a dark
overcoat and a bowler hat on, different from the hat and coat that he wore when
I saw him in the lobby. I saw part of his face in Glasgow, on 21st December,
immediately after he passed me and when I turned round, just before he went
down the stairs. I recognised the man in the corridor as the man I had seen in
the lobby of the house. He was the middle one of the three men. I recognised
his walk. No one had asked me to point him out at the time when the three men
walked up the corridor and passed me. I just pointed him out myself. I was not
told that he was coming or anything of that kind. I just recognised him as one
of the three that passed me. No one asked me any question about it when I spoke
to Detective-Inspector Pyper. That was the only chance I had of seeing him
before I went into the Court-room. After the three men passed me, Detective-
Inspector Pyper, the girl Barrowman, and I went into the Court-room. The two
men who were with the man that I recognised were in plain clothes. I do not
know who they were; they were strangers to me. When I went into the Courtroom I
found a number of people there. I sat in a chair. I saw the man in the room
that I had seen in the lobby of the house. I recognised him and I identified
him. He was sitting on my left side, about a yard away. Beside him were sitting
Mr. Goodhart and Mr. Miller. Mr. Goodhart was between him and me, but I had no
difficulty in pointing him out in the Court in New York. I had to look round
the back of Mr. Goodhart to see him, and I did that; and when I looked round I
pointed him out. There were a number of other people in the room besides these
three. I had no difficulty in pointing him out as the man. I had never seen any
photographs of him before. There were in the room at the time Mr. Warnock,
Detective-Inspector Pyper, the girl Barrowman, and Mr. Adams. Where I was
sitting I had to lean round to see the man. I came home a day or two
afterwards. On Monday night, 22nd February, I went down to the Central Police
Office, and was taken to a room where there were a number of men. I pointed out
in that room the man I had seen in the lobby, the same man as I had seen in New
York. I had no difficulty in recognising -him. When I first went into the room
at the Central Police Station the man was dressed in a dark suit. About fifteen
minutes afterwards I was again shown the man dressed in the coat No. 43 of
productions. He had not either of the caps under label No. 46, nor had he the
hat No. 44. It was a lighter cap than No. 44.</p>

  <p>Look at No. 46 again? &mdash; It was neither of these caps. I recognised
the coat No. 43 as the coat he was wearing the night I saw him in the lobby.
The cap that he was wearing the night I saw him in the lobby was a dark cap,
and something of the shape of a Donegal hat.</p>

  <p>Is No. 44 what you call a Donegal? &mdash; Yes, something of that
shape.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; The cap he had on when I saw him at the Central
Police Office was a light green cap. When I saw him in the lobby he had a dark
cap on. I am not sure what was the difference between it and the one I am shown
now.</p>

  <p>Examination resumed &mdash; You are not sure that that is the cap?
&mdash; No. I think it was more like the light one in No. 46 as regards shape.
I was in West Princes Street on the Sunday night before the murder, between six
and a quarter to seven. I saw a man passing back and forward on the street on
the same side as I was on. I did not take any particular notice of him. I could
not very well recognise the man I saw that Sunday night. He had a dark overcoat
on and a bowler hat. I could not say whether he was clean shaven or not. He had
a sallow complexion. The prisoner is the man I saw in the lobby, and he is also
the man I saw at New York and in the Central Police Office.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; You say that you could not
recognise the man that you saw in the street on the Sunday? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And so little did you think of that that you did not mention it to any
one at all till the 12th of March? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You had been in America in between, and you had been examined by the
fiscal different times, but you never thought of the man walking on the street
on 20th December till 12th March? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You said that you could not recognise him? &mdash; Not the one that I saw
on the Sunday night.</p>

  <p>As regards the identification of the man who was in the lobby that night,
I wish to ask you a few questions When you left the house that night you have
told us that the dining-room gas was lit? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And the lobby gas? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How was the lobby gas lit? &mdash; Half -on.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Was it incandescent? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; An ordinary burner? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Has not the lamp a burner inside the glass? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What kind of glass is it? &mdash; Stained glass.</p>

  <p>Is it thick stained glass? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What are the colours? &mdash; Blue colour.</p>

  <p>When you saw the man in the lobby how far was he from the door? &mdash;
About 6 yards.</p>

  <p>The whole lobby is not 18 feet long, is it? &mdash; I think it is.</p>

  <p>When you saw him first was he standing or walking? &mdash; Walking.</p>

  <p>And coming out of the door at the far end of the lobby? &mdash; I did not
notice him coming out of that door; he was past the door a little.</p>

  <p>He had only about 3 or 4 yards to walk to you and go out? &mdash; I think
it was about that.</p>

  <p>You have told us that you did not recognise any of the caps here as being
the cap that he was wearing that night? &mdash; I am not sure.</p>

  <p>You said something about a Donegal hat, but it is not a thing split in
two like that? &mdash; You can split it in two.</p>

  <p>Is it not an ordinary cloth cap with a rim right round about it? &mdash;
Yes, and that is one with a rim like it.</p>

  <p>Can you say that it was a Donegal hat, or is it just thinking back that
the idea has come to you? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Is that only an impression? &mdash; No, I am sure of that.</p>

  <p>Next, I am going to ask you about the coat; what is it that made you use
the expression that not only was the coat one which was like that, but that
that was the very coat? &mdash; That is the coat.</p>

  <p>The same sort of coat? &mdash; That is the coat.</p>

  <p>Do you say that he wore a coat like that? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>But that is all? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And dark trousers? &mdash; I am sure he had dark trousers.</p>

  <p>I wish to ask you this &mdash; what did you recognise in him which
enabled you to identify him afterwards in America? &mdash; By his walk and
height, his dark hair, and the side of his face.</p>

  <p>Was it only his walk and his height and dark hair? &mdash; Yes, and the
side of his face.</p>

  <p>Is it not the fact that you were not quite sure of him to begin with,
when you saw him in America? &mdash; Yes, I was quite sure.</p>

  <p>I wish you to be careful about this. In America when you were asked if
you saw the man present you said first, "One is very suspicious, if anything"?
&mdash; That is a mistake.</p>

  <p>These were your words? &mdash; Yes, I quite believe it.</p>

  <p>When the question was put to you you said, "One is very suspicious, if
anything"? &mdash; Yes, because he walked up and down.</p>

  <p>That was after you had seen the man walking. You were asked, "Now, do you
see the man here you saw that night," you said, "One is very suspicious, if
anything"? &mdash; It was the way it was put. It was what Miller meant. That
was the expression he used.</p>

  <p>But you used these words in America. The question was put, "Now, do you
see the man here you saw that night?" and your first answer was, "One is very
suspicious, if anything"; what did you mean by that? &mdash; Because it was the
same man.</p>

  <p>Why did you say that you were suspicious? &mdash; It was a mistake.</p>

  <p>You mean that you did not say what you intended to say? &mdash; Yes, I
did not intend to say that.</p>

  <p>I suggest to you that you were not quite sure of him then? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Why did you say that you were only suspicious? &mdash; It was a
mistake.</p>

  <p>You have told us to-day that you recognised him by his face? &mdash; The
side of his face.</p>

  <p>I will read the question again that was put in America, "Now, will you
describe, please, this man that you saw on that night that passed you at that
doorway, the height if you can tell, the clothes if you can tell, or such other
description of him that would in any way identify him to anybody else?" and
your answer is, "The clothes that he had on that night he has not got on to-
day, but his face I could not tell" &mdash; did you say that? &mdash; Not the
broad face, but the side.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner said, "What did you say about his face?" and your answer
is, "I could not tell his face; I never saw his face." Now, when you said these
things in America and stated on two different occasions that you never saw his
face, why do you go back upon that now and say that you saw the man's face and
recognised him? &mdash; I did see his face.</p>

  <p>Why did you say that you did not see it? &mdash; There has been a bit
left out.</p>

  <p>Did you say in America that you did see his face? &mdash; I do not
remember.</p>

  <p>Why do you say that a bit has been left out? &mdash; If I did not say it
there I could not say it here.</p>

  <p>If you had never seen it in the lobby, why did you say "I could not tell
his face: I never saw his face"? &mdash; I did not see the broad face. He held
down his head, and it was only the side of his face.</p>

  <p>But you did not say that? &mdash; I know that I can say that.</p>

  <p>You are speaking now at a distance of many months &mdash; four months and
more &mdash; since you saw the man in the lobby when your recollection was
fresh, on the 26th of January, just a month after the occurrence, and you said
that you had never seen his face at all. How do you explain that? &mdash;
Because he did not look at me, but I saw it when he was going down the
stair.</p>

  <p>Why did you not say so? &mdash; I am saying it now.</p>

  <p>Why did you not say it then in America, when you were asked? &mdash; (No
answer).</p>

  <p>The question was put to you repeatedly, and you gave that answer? &mdash;
That was what I meant, but he did not look at me, and I did not see the broad
of it.</p>

  <p>Here is another question I wish to ask you about &mdash; what did you
mean in America by saying that you could not tell the man's face, that you
never saw his face, if, in point of fact, you did see it, so as to help you to
recognise it &mdash; what do you mean by that? &mdash; Nothing.</p>

  <p>You meant nothing by it, and that is the statement that you made within a
month of the occurrence &mdash; why do you contradict it four months
afterwards? &mdash; It is not four months since I said that. It is less than
that.</p>

  <p>It is three months then, is it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>February, March, April &mdash; why do you contradict three months after
you made the statement in America the actual words that you then used, that you
could not identify the man by his face? What are you going on now? &mdash; I am
going on his face now.</p>

  <p>I do not understand that. Listen to this question. You were asked by Mr.
Miller in America, "Did you not state a moment ago that you did not see the
man's face?" and your answer was, "Neither I did. I saw the walk. It is not the
face I went by, but the walk"? &mdash; Yes, I said that.</p>

  <p>Is that correct? &mdash; Yes, quite correct.</p>

  <p>What do you mean by saying that it is his face if it was his walk that
you spoke to in America? &mdash; I saw his face &mdash; the side of his
face.</p>

  <p>You said in America that you were going on nothing but his walk, and you
did not see his face. Do you contradict that now? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What has led you to change your evidence from what you gave in America?
&mdash; Nothing has led me.</p>

  <p>Was the thing fresher in your recollection when you were examined in
America, just one month after the occurrence? &mdash; Not one bit fresher.</p>

  <p>Why did you say in America, confidently, that you never saw the man's
face, and that you did not go by his face, and only by his walk, if, in point
of fact, you had seen his face, and you recognised him? &mdash; It was the side
of the face. That is all I saw.</p>

  <p>Why did you not say in America that you saw the side of his face? &mdash;
I could say it if I went to America now, but I was excited the first day.</p>

  <p>And then you would give different evidence? &mdash; No, it would be the
same.</p>

  <p>I ask you again, can you give any explanation at all? &mdash; None.</p>

  <p>Why did you say that it was his walk and not by his face, and that you
had never seen his face, if, as a matter of fact, you did see his face &mdash;
can you explain why you said so? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You were examined twice over in America. You were taken back the second
day, and asked some more questions? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You were asked again on the second day whether you had seen his face, and
you said, "No, sir." <i>Q.</i> The photograph was not shown to you at all?
&mdash; <i>A.</i> No. <i>Q.</i> And you never saw any? &mdash; <i>A.</i> No.
<i>Q.</i> The photograph of defendant before you came into Court? &mdash;
<i>A.</i> No, sir. <i>Q.</i> And you had never seen his face? &mdash; <i>A.</i>
No sir." On the second day you made the same statement; that you never saw his
face. Why did you repeat the same mistake on the second day, if, in point of
fact, you had recognised the man by his face all along? Have you not been
talking too much about this thing. Miss Lambie? &mdash; I had the side of his
face.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Why did you not say in America that you saw part of
his face &mdash; that is the question? &mdash; I cannot say anything for myself
for saying that, but I know that I did see the side of his face.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; Did you say that the man was clean
shaven? &mdash; Yes. I saw that from the side.</p>

  <p>No hair about his face at all? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You say that you identified the man by his walk? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What is the peculiarity of the walk to which you allude? &mdash; He
shakes forward a little.</p>

  <p>What do you mean by shaking forward? &mdash; There is a peculiarity about
his walk.</p>

  <p>You might name what it is, because I wish to know &mdash; do you mean
that he bends forward? &mdash; A little.</p>

  <p>Is that all you mean by shaking forward? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>What else do you mean? &mdash; That is what I mean.</p>

  <p>You say that he bends forward &mdash; is it his head that is bent
forward? &mdash; A little.</p>

  <p>Anything else? &mdash; His walk.</p>

  <p>What about his walk? &mdash; Nothing about his walk, but I identified him
by his walk.</p>

  <p>But there is nothing peculiar about it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>There is nothing peculiar about his walk, but you identified him by it?
&mdash; There is a peculiarity about his walk.</p>

  <p>What peculiarity? &mdash; I identified him by his walk. I cannot tell
you. His head bends forward, and he shakes himself a little.</p>

  <p>How does he shake himself? &mdash; His shoulders.</p>

  <p>What does he do? Does he jog them up and down like this (showing)?
&mdash; Yes, but not so much as that.</p>

  <p>As I understand, this peculiarity in the walk, by which alone you were
able to identify him in America, you only saw while the man walked 3 or 4 yards
along the lobby, which was dimly lighted. Is that so? &mdash; It was not dimly
lighted.</p>

  <p>I thought you said that the gas was half on? &mdash; Yes, if you put it
full on it goes up in a blaze.</p>

  <p>It was quite a good blaze? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>I wish to read another passage from the American evidence which sums it
up. The question is put to you, "And all that you remember about the difference
in his walk from other men's walk is what you have shown us here when you were
standing up?" and you say, "Yes, sir." Did you give them an exhibition of how
it was done? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>" And that is all you have to identify this man as the man you saw in the
hallway?" and you say, "Yes." That is another passage in which you refer to the
walk as the only means of identification &mdash; "why did you on all these
occasions say that it was the walk only that you have in your mind &mdash; that
you had not seen his face, and could not recognise him by that? &mdash; It was
quite a good identification.</p>

  <p>The walk? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Why did you not mention this appearance of the man's face in America when
you had three or four different opportunities of doing so? Can you give any
explanation? &mdash; Because when I saw him with his own coat on I was surer
than when I saw him without it.</p>

  <p>When? &mdash; On the Monday night.</p>

  <p>But why did you not on four different occasions in America answer that
his face had something to do with the identification? &mdash; If I had seen him
with his own clothes on &mdash; the clothes that he had on that night &mdash; I
could have done so.</p>

  <p>How did that alter his face? &mdash; It made a big difference.</p>

  <p>Now when you saw him walking down the corridor in America, the man was
walking down between the assistant marshal of the United States Court and a man
with a large badge? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you were do-mi there for the purpose of identifying the man? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>What were you there for? &mdash; I do not know what we were standing
there for.</p>

  <p>Did you not know that you were going to see the man Slater at the Courts?
&mdash; No, I did not know.</p>

  <p>What did you go to do? &mdash; To identify a man.</p>

  <p>The man Slater? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And when you went there did you know that he was the party that you went
to identify? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When he was being brought down the corridor did you know that that was
the man who was coming? &mdash; I picked him out myself.</p>

  <p>But you knew that he was coming? &mdash; No, I did not know that he was
coming.</p>

  <p>You knew that the man was coming down, or a man who was being brought for
identification? &mdash; No, I picked him out myself.</p>

  <p>And you said that that was like the man who was in the Court? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Of course, -when you came back ix) this country, you had no difficulty in
recognising the man who was shown you at the Central Police Station as the man
you had seen in America? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You knew before you went down that you were going to see him again?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You did all the identification you had to do in America, and you saw that
it was the same man at the Central Police Station and the same man who was
here? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>I want to know, when you were standing at the door with Mr. Adams, and
had opened the door, is it not the case that you went in towards the kitchen at
the time the man was coming forward? &mdash; The first time I was standing at
the door.</p>

  <p>Had you not gone inside? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Where was Adams? &mdash; Behind.</p>

  <p>Is it not the case that you turned round to go to the kitchen, and that
the man passed by when you were inside by the kitchen door? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>How close did the man pass to Adams? &mdash; A little further than the
distance that he passed me, because he was further back than I was.</p>

  <p>Was Adams not standing right in the doorway, and the man who passed him
almost touching? &mdash; Not when I was there.</p>

  <p>But you were both there together? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is it not the case that what happened was that you opened the door and
passed in towards the kitchen, and that the man walked down and came right past
Adams, who was still on the door mat? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>So that the man passed Adams as Adams was standing on the door mat?
&mdash; Yes; we were both on the door mat.</p>

  <p>Was Miss Gilchrist in the habit of going out with jewellery on her?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What did she wear when she was out? &mdash; If she was going to her tea
she put on more jewellery.</p>

  <p>But what would she wear if she was going to tea? &mdash; A better brooch
and more rings.</p>

  <p>Did anybody in the neighbourhood know that she was a person who kept
jewellery in her house? &mdash; Some may.</p>

  <p>But do you know of any? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Who? &mdash; A girl friend of mine whom I told that Miss Gilchrist had a
lot of jewellery.</p>

  <p>But except for that girl you have no notion of anybody who knew? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>Did you yourself inform a man named Nugent that she had jewellery?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How long ago was that? &mdash; Shortly after the New Year.</p>

  <p>Last New Year? &mdash; The year before.</p>

  <p>When you went out, were all the windows snibbed except the kitchen
window? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And the kitchen window was slightly down &mdash; 2 or 3 inches at the
top? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When you got back to the house were the windows in exactly the same
position as when you left them? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did Miss Gilchrist use to have a dog? &mdash; Yes; an Irish terrier.</p>

  <p>What happened to it? &mdash; It got poisoned.</p>

  <p>When was it poisoned? &mdash; I think on the 7th or 8th of September.</p>

  <p>Was that thought to be done by somebody? &mdash; I did not think it,
because I thought that it might have eaten something; but Miss Gilchrist
thought it was poisoned by somebody.</p>

  <p>Intentionally to kill the watch dog &mdash; was that the idea? &mdash;
She did not say.</p>

  <p>What did she say? &mdash; She thought it was a shame of anybody to do
such a thing to a dog.</p>

  <p>Was that all that passed? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>There is one thing I wish to ask you also &mdash; did you, when you saw
the man coming down the corridor in New York, say this, "Oh, I could nearly
swear that was the man"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>If that was your state of mind, do you mean to suggest now that you had
no doubt of any kind? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Why did you say that you could nearly swear it was the man? &mdash; It
was from the distance. I thought that it was the man; I knew that it was
him.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Did you just get a glimpse of
him as he was coming down the corridor? &mdash; Yes; he was walking on.</p>

  <p>And you recognised the gait in the corridor? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you recollect whether anybody asked you any questions about him when
he was coming down the corridor? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he was to come that way? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Do you recollect whether you saw his face in the corridor? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>As he passed you? &mdash; Yes; he looked at me when he passed me.</p>

  <p>Is it the case that when you opened the door that night, when you just
caught sight of him, he had his head down? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And as he came across the lobby did he keep his head down the whole time?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>So that you could not see his full face? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was that what you meant in New York when you said that you did not see
his face? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is it the case that when you turned round after he had passed you, you
got a glimpse of his side face then? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you have a better opportunity of seeing his gait, the way he walked,
than you had of seeing his face? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you look at him till he disappeared? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>As he walked across the landing? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did Nugent visit you at Miss Gilchrist's house? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he, on one occasion at least, have a meal in the house? &mdash; Yes;
dinner.</p>

  <p>And did Miss Gilchrist know that he came into the house, and was she
quite pleased that he should? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is Nugent the least like the prisoner? &mdash; Not the least like.</p>

  <p>When did you last see him? &mdash; Last September.</p>

  <p>Where does he live? &mdash; Carfin.</p>

  <p>Were you a good deal excited and agitated over at New York? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>You were asked a great many questions in the two days? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you get a better chance of looking at the man when you were in the
room than you had in the corridor? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Had you any doubt about him when you saw him in the room? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Look at No. 5; that is the photograph which you now have before you,
showing very well the outside door and landing? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Now, does it show the mat on which you were standing when the man passed
you? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And was Adams standing immediately behind you? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Does the door open inwards? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And did the man come from your right hand? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When you opened the door did he come out of the bedroom, or did you see
him coming out of the bedroom? &mdash; No; he had come out.</p>

  <p>Was he near the bedroom door when you first saw him coming towards the
door? &mdash; He was on the other side of the door that goes into the
bedroom.</p>

  <p>Can you see in that photograph the bedroom door? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Look at this other photograph. Does that show the bedroom door? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>Will you tell me what is the room we see into in that photograph? &mdash;
The dining-room.</p>

  <p>What is the door on the right-hand side? &mdash; The kitchen door.</p>

  <p>When you are looking at the photographs are you standing as it were on
the same side as the bedroom door? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>What door is opposite the bedroom door? &mdash; There is another bedroom
opposite the bedroom door.</p>

  <p>Look at No. 5/5. You see the bedroom door? &mdash; The side of it.</p>

  <p>Which of the two doors is it? &mdash; The second one in.</p>

  <p>Is that the door from which the man came? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you see the top of the lobby light there? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>At the bottom of the light is there a coloured light quite open? &mdash;
Quite open.</p>

  <p>And was the light, such as it was, at its best? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Could you have made it better? &mdash; Yes, by screwing it higher.</p>

  <p>Quite sufficient to enable you to see the man? &mdash; Yes, quite
sufficient.</p>

  <p>By Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; You saw the man's walk in the corridor in America?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Now, after he went into the room you saw him, but you saw him sitting
down? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was that the only time you saw him walking as he came down the corridor?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How far did you see him walking down the corridor? &mdash; 12 yards.</p>

  <p>And inside, while you saw him close at hand, you did not see him walking?
&mdash; I saw him walking into the room, coming through the corridor.</p>

  <p>But after he was in the room you did not see him walking? &mdash; No; he
was sitting all the time.</p>

  <p class="c">The Court adjourned at half-past six o'clock.</p>

  <h2><a id="day2" name="day2">SECOND DAY &mdash; TUESDAY, 4TH MAY,
1909.</a></h2>

  <p class="c">The Court met at ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>JOHN PYPER, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a detective
inspector in the Western District of the Police, Glasgow. About twenty minutes
to eight on Monday, 21st December, while I was in the Western Police Office, a
telephone message came from Dr. Adams, of No. 10 Queen's Crescent, to the
effect that a lady had been murdered at 15 Queen's Terrace. Along with
Detective M'Vicar I immediately went to the house, and arrived there about five
minutes to eight. I went upstairs and found Constables Neil and Brian in
charge. The house consists of six rooms and kitchen on one floor, and there is
only one other house upstairs to which the stair gives access, that house being
unoccupied. The lobby of Miss Gilchrist's house is about 18 feet long and about
10 feet wide. Entering from the door the dining-room is immediately on the left
hand side. The dining-room is about 21 feet long by 15 feet wide. I observed
that the handle for opening the door at the stairfoot was just inside the
lobby, between the dining-room door and the door leading to the house. I
entered the dining-room, and I found the deceased lady lying on her back in
front of the fireplace, with her feet stretched out towards the door. Her right
hand was stretched out, and her left hand was partly on her breast. Her face
and head were smashed and very much disfigured. I saw a set of false teeth
lying on the rug just opposite her head. There were sparks of blood on the
grate, on the fire-irons, and on the coal scuttle. I saw a half-sovereign on
the rug beside her left hand. Constable Neil picked up that half-sovereign and
put it on the mantelpiece. I searched the house carefully to see if there were
any implements left which had caused the injuries, but I found nothing. The
poker and tonga in the dining-room were lying on the fender in their usual
place. (Shown plan No. 6 of the productions.) The red mark indicates where the
deceased lady was lying. (Shown photograph i/o of productions.) In that
photograph I see the handle by which the door at the foot of the close is
opened. It is shown in the corner between the door of the house and the door of
the dining-room. Although the poker and tongs bore sparks of blood upon them,
there was nothing to indicate that they had been used to maul the old lady.
They certainly had not been used. When I was in the house the servant, Helen
Lambie, searched it to see if anything was amissing, and she reported to me
that she missed a crescent brooch in the bedroom, and nothing else. She pointed
to a wooden box on the floor of the bedroom, that box being label No. 20. She
also pointed out a number of letters and papers scattered on the floor.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Helen Lambie was a little excited, but not much,
considering the position of matters.</p>

  <p>Examination resumed &mdash; Label No. 19 contains the letters and papers
that were scattered on the floor of the bedroom. (Shown plan No. 6 of 62 the
productions.) The bedroom where these papers and the box were found is the room
in the top right hand corner. The servant Lambie told me that these papers and
letters used to be kept in the box. There was a diamond ring and there were two
other rings in. a little glass dish on the toilet table. Helen Lambie told me
that the missing brooch used to lie on that same table. There were also on the
table a gold bracelet in a case and a gold watch and chain. Nothing else in
that room or in the other rooms had been interfered with. None of the furniture
was displaced. The hearth rug was very much stained with blood. Constable Neil
informed me that he had found a skin rug lying on the top of the deceased's
body when he went in. When I went in that skin rug was lying beside her head.
(Shown labels No. 16 and 17.) No. 16 is the hearth rug and No. 17 is the skin
rug that was lying on the top of the deceased. On the dining-room table I found
a magazine and the lady's spectacles lying beside it. Her spectacle case was
attached to her dress. The outer door of the house is secured by a Chubb lock,
a patent lock, and a common lock. I saw that the common lock was used for
securing the door at night, while the patent and Chubb locks were used by day.
It required two keys to open the door. I instructed Inspector Rankin to search
the back green the following morning as soon as daylight came in. When the back
green was searched a piece of an old broken auger was found; that was the only
thing that was found. (Shown production No. 25.) That is what was found in the
back green. I took possession of the two rugs, the coal scuttle, and the
deceased lady's spectacles. I superintended the removal of the body to the
Royal Infirmary. It had been previously identified in presence of Professor
Glaister and Dr. Galt. A description of the missing brooch was circulated
amongst pawnbrokers and jewellers and dealers. (Shown production No. 42.) That
is the description of the brooch. I was present on several occasions between
24th December and 7th January in the house at 15 Queen's Ten-ace, when a large
quantity of jewels were found. A list was made by Mr. Dick, and it is correct;
I saw it and went over it carefully. On 22nd December, 1908, I saw a purse
containing a number of tickets, and so on, found in the pocket of the late Miss
Gilchrist when the body was undressed. I took possession of it and of the half-
sovereign. Superintendent Douglas took possession of a box of matches and a
spent match which were found in the bedroom. (Shown production No. 18.) These
were found in the bedroom. The servant girl said that these matches did not
belong to the house. On the morning of 24th December I saw the girl Mary
Barrowman, and she described to me a man she said she had seen running out of
Miss Gilchrist's close on the night of the murder. On the same day I forwarded
that description to Superintendent Ord at the Central Police Office, and on the
following day, 25th December, the description appeared in the newspapers.
(Shown productions Nos. 38, 40, and 41.) These are the newspapers containing
the description. These would appear in the five o'clock edition of the evening
papers of 25th December.</p>

  <p>Did you cause inquiry to be made that night at the house, 69 St. George's
Road, at which Anderson, a dentist, was said to live? &mdash; No, I did not
cause inquiry to be made, but I learned that inquiry was made. I learned that
Anderson, the dentist, disappeared that night. On the 12th of January, 1909, I
was instructed to accompany Mr. Warnock and the witnesses Lambie, Barrowman,
and Adams to New York, and I accompanied them. I arrived in New York on the
25th of January, 1909. On the following day I went to the Court there with the
witnesses. The examination was conducted in Mr. Commissioner Shield's room.
Before the examination commenced I was standing in a corridor leading to the
room. The girls Lambie and Barrowman were with me. They were standing beside
me.</p>

  <p>Will you describe to us in your own words what happened when you and the
two girls were standing in the corridor? &mdash; I was looking along to see if
Mr. Fox, the Crown agent, was coming along, when both of the girls touched me
on the shoulder at the same time and said, "Oh! there's the man away into the
Court." I did not see the man to whom they referred; there were quite a number
of people there; I could not distinguish one from another. I knew that some men
had passed me; there were quite a number of people going out and in to the
Court. The girls identified some man &mdash; both at the same time. I had not
told them to expect the man to come along the corridor; I told them nothing. I
had not asked them any question. That came entirely from themselves. I then
went into the room. The girls went in also. I did not myself see Slater enter
the room. When I went into the room there were a number of people there. There
were about forty, I should say, altogether. I think there was one woman, at any
rate, besides the two female witnesses. Some of them were sitting; some of them
were standing. It was a comparatively email room. It was crowded all round
about. I and the two witnesses stood at the window near the Commissioner's
desk. He was seated at a table with a desk on it. Slater was seated on a chair
alongside one of the marshals behind his two agents, Mr. Goodhart and Mr.
Miller. He was not handcuffed or distinguished in any way. The girl who was
giving evidence had a seat, but the others were standing. I was present when
the girl Helen Lambie gave her evidence. In my presence she was asked to
identify the man she saw on the night of the murder. She stood up and looked
round the Court, and Mr. Goodhart, who was immediately in front of the accused,
also stood up and spread out his frock coat, and, after looking round for a
little bit, she looked over his shoulder and pointed to the accused. She had
not any hesitation about him. She had to lean over to get a sight of him. I was
present when the girl Barrowman was examined. She pointed him out also, and
said that he was very like the man. She had no hesitation. I cannot tell myself
whether it was the same man that they had seen going in; I did not see him
going in. I was present when Mr. Adams was examined; he said he was very like
the man, but he was not too confident, or something to that effect. Adams was
examined when there were a number of men in the Court-room too. No assistance
of any kind was given to him. He was just asked to look round to find the man
that he had seen that night. In Adams' case, as in the case of the two girls,
Slater was seated, but he was told to stand up afterwards. I took possession of
all Slater's luggage in New York. Each parcel was sealed with the Government
seal. There were seven packages. They were portmanteaus and bags. There were
initials on some of them &mdash; "O.S." They were brought to this country in
the same ship that I and the prisoner and Mr. Warnock came back in. I arrived
in Glasgow on the 21st of February, 1909. I came home in the same ship as
Slater. The witnesses came in a different ship. I was in charge along with Mr.
Warnock. When we arrived the accused claimed all the baggage, and I opened and
searched it. In a black leather trunk I found a fawn-coloured waterproof coat.
(Shown label 43.) That is the coat. Slater claimed it as his property. I found
in the same black leather trunk a hammer. (Shown label 47.) That is the hammer.
Slater claimed that as his property. I examined the coat and hammer. I found
several dark stains on the coat, in front, mostly on the shoulders. The polish
appears to have been removed from the handle of the hammer, particularly
towards the bottom end of the handle. It seems to be scraped from the middle to
the head. I further found in the baggage a soft hat. (Shown label 44.) That is
the hat. Slater claimed that hat. I also found two cloth caps. (Shown label
46.) These are the caps. Slater claimed these caps. There was a large quantity
of clothes in the baggage &mdash; overcoats, coats, and other things of all
descriptions. I saw no dentist's apparatus. Mr. Warnock and I went over the
baggage very minutely. On 21st and 22nd February the accused was shown to a
number of witnesses. He was placed among other eleven men, all in plain
clothes. Some of these men were railway men and the others were police
officials, but all in plain clothes. The accused was allowed to take up any
position among them that he pleased. I was present when a few of the witnesses
identified the accused. I was present when Adams, Barrowman, Armour, and
several others identified him &mdash; I forget their names. These witnesses had
no difficulty in identifying him. They were not assisted in any way. On 23rd
February I met the witnesses Barrowman, Bryson, and Nairn in West Princes
Street. They pointed out to me the places in the street on which they said they
had seen the accused. I observed that from all these places there was a good
view of Miss Gilchrist's house obtained. I remember in particular the position
that Nairn pointed out. He pointed out the corner of Queen's Crescent and West
Princes Street, and said that he was standing just at the comer of the turning
looking towards the house, and from there a good view could be obtained of the
house. There is a lamp 8 yards from the entrance with a very good incandescent
light. There is a good view obtained of the house from the stair opposite. That
is the place where Bryson pointed out that the man was standing. When the
witnesses were asked to identify Slater he was dressed in a dark suit with a
dark overcoat and bowler hat. He was afterwards shown to some of the witnesses
with a fawn coat and the soft hat (label 44). All the other men had their hats
on &mdash; bowler hats. I recollect of Slater's dress being changed when the
witness Barrowman was asked to identify him in the Central Police Office. She
asked that his hat should be put down a little, and he did so. Then she said,
"A little further, please, pull it down a little further," and he did so. Then
she said, "That is how it was on that night" or "That is it." The hat that he
had on was the soft felt hat (label No. 44). (The witness showed how the hat
was placed on the head.) The witness Annie Armour identified the accused with
the dark clothes and the bowler hat. The witness Euphemia Cunningham also
picked him out. The witness William Campbell seemed to have a doubt about him.
He said he was like him, but he seemed to hesitate a little. The accused was
dressed in the fawn-coloured coat for Helen Lambie to identify him, and she did
so without any difficulty. There is a gas jet at the top of the first flight of
stairs, that being the first jet that you come to. Then there is another jet at
the deceased's door, and there are two on the top flat. The jet at the door is
close by the door, projecting from the wall. In the lobby of the house there is
a pendant hanging from the ceiling in about the middle of the hall with one
burner. It is open below. I have on several occasions seen the light on the
wall of the stair just outside the door lit, and the light in the lobby lit
with the door open. There is quite a good light. Photograph No. 5/7 shows the
jet immediately outside the door of which I have spoken. Photograph No. 5/6
shows the jet in the lobby. If the dining-room door was open and the gas lit
there that would make the light in the lobby stronger. I have tried the light.
I have seen the light at the door on the stair lit with the light in the lobby
half-on. There is quite a good light. The light in the pendant when it is half-
full on is quite strong enough for usual service. I had an opportunity on the
night of the murder immediately after I came to the house of seeing the lights
as I have described them.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; When I say that the light is quite good I mean that
by it one could read ordinary print.</p>

  <p>Examination resumed &mdash; If the girl was standing just at the entrance
from the door into the house and looking in, I should say that she should have
quite a good view of a man coming out of the bedroom towards her. The full
length of the lobby is 18 feet. From the entrance door to the door of the
bedroom which was lit, and where I saw the box and the papers scattered, the
distance is 12 feet, I should say. If, as the man passed, the girl turned round
to look at him, she should see him quite well on the stair with the gas lit.
West Princes Street is a very quiet street in a quiet residential locality. If
the man ran from Miss Gilchrist's house to Kelvingrove Subway station his
direct course would be along this quiet street and turning to the right at the
end, that being rather less than half a mile. I have walked the distance; it
takes seven and a half minutes. From end to end there is very little traffic
either of foot passengers or otherwise. It is very seldom you see any one there
except an odd passer-by. Kelvinbridge Subway station is not the nearest subway
station to the place where the murder was committed. There is one at St.
George's Cross, which would be nearer, but in order to get to that station one
would require to pass through more traffic and to get into a busy
thoroughfare.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Are you detective inspector?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And may we take it you are the person who had charge of this case?
&mdash; Yes, I believe I have made the greatest inquiry in connection with the
matter, but not altogether.</p>

  <p>Had you charge of the arrangements under which the witnesses attended to
identify the accused? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Who had charge of that? &mdash; Superintendent Ord.</p>

  <p>You said it was about ten minutes to eight when you arrived at the house
on the night of the 21st? &mdash; About five minutes to eight.</p>

  <p>And you examined the witness Lambie that night, or got a statement, at
any rate, from her? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You said you were also present in America when Lambie made a statement?
&mdash; I was.</p>

  <p>Now, in the boat over did you have any conversation at all with the
witnesses? &mdash; None whatever relative to the case.</p>

  <p>About the crime? &mdash; None.</p>

  <p>Were the witnesses Lambie and Barrowman companions during the voyage?
&mdash; They were.</p>

  <p>Were there just you three and Mr. Adams on board the boat of a party?
&mdash; And Mr. Warnock.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Did Lambie and Barrowman occupy the same cabin?
&mdash; Yes, Lambie and Barrowman occupied the same cabin.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; Did you and Warnock occupy the same
cabin? &mdash; And Adams; we occupied a cabin of a different class.</p>

  <p>You had spoken, of course, to Adams about what he had seen on the night
of the 21st? &mdash; Oh, yes.</p>

  <p>Did you revert to that in any way on the way across? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You never mentioned at all the purpose of the voyage on the way over?
&mdash; They knew the purpose of the voyage; they were being sent there to see
if they could recognise the man as the murderer &mdash; as the man they had
seen that night.</p>

  <p>When you got across to America I think a man called Mr. Fox was attending
to the Crown's interests? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>And on the day when the man Slater was to be exhibited to the girls for
identification Barrowman had first of all an interview with Mr. Fox in his
office? &mdash; Yes, I understand she had.</p>

  <p>At which two photographs were submitted to her? &mdash; Photographs of
newspaper cuttings.</p>

  <p>Why did you show the photographs in America? &mdash; I did not show the
photographs; it was Mr. Fox who showed them.</p>

  <p>You were present at the time? &mdash; I was present.</p>

  <p>Were these shown as the photographs of the suspected man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And did they show a dark complexioned man with a dark moustache? &mdash;
Well, I could not take it as that; they were very defective photographs.</p>

  <p>Did they show the general appearance of Slater? &mdash; I presume they
did, but they were very bad photographs; no person, to my mind, could recognise
any person from them.</p>

  <p>Do you say that they were not the least like the man? &mdash; Yes, I say
they are not the least like the man.</p>

  <p>Were they recognised in your presence by Barrowman as being the man?
&mdash; She could not recognise the photographs.</p>

  <p>You say so? &mdash; I say so.</p>

  <p>Now, when you were out in the passage and this man was brought down a
corridor, as I understand, you did not see him come down the corridor at* all?
&mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>The two girls were standing together? &mdash; They were standing
together.</p>

  <p>And what view could they have; for how far could they see the man walking
down the hall if they were looking? &mdash; Well, it depended on where they had
seen him first; he might have been close up to them before they observed him,
or he might have been 20 yards away from them; it is a long passage.</p>

  <p>What were you attending to when the girls were looking? &mdash; I was
looking in the opposite direction; they were standing at my back.</p>

  <p>And the first thing that attracted your attention was when you heard one
say&mdash;? &mdash; Both touched me on the arm at the same time.</p>

  <p>Both on the same arm and at the same time? &mdash; Yes. And both spoke at
once? &mdash; Both spoke at once. And both said the same thing? &mdash; Both
said the same thing. What did they say? &mdash; They said, "Oh, there's the man
away into the Court"; I looked into the Court, but I could not distinguish any
person.</p>

  <p>Is it not curious that the girls used the same words at exactly the same
time and clapped you on the shoulder? &mdash; It may seem curious, but it is
the fact all the same.</p>

  <p>Did you hear the girl Lambie say, "I could almost swear that's the man"?
&mdash; I cannot say that I heard her say that.</p>

  <p>Did you hear her make any remark at all till the remark you have quoted
to us? &mdash; No, that was the first.</p>

  <p>Are you prepared to say there was no remark made till the one quoted by
you? &mdash; Yes, there was no remark made.</p>

  <p>So that if the girl Lambie says, "I could almost swear that's the man,"
are you in a position to contradict that? &mdash; She may have said it after
that, but not before that.</p>

  <p>I am talking of before. &mdash; She did not say that to me before; I did
not hear her say so.</p>

  <p>Do you mean that the remark was never made, or that you did not hear it?
&mdash; I did not hear it.</p>

  <p>Is that all you can say? &mdash; That is all I can say.</p>

  <p>Did the girl Lambie tell you how she recognised him? &mdash; She said in
the Court-room from his walk.</p>

  <p>Was that the first you heard about it? &mdash; Yes. In the Court did he
walk at all? &mdash; He did not.</p>

  <p>So that if she recognised him by his walk it must have been only from
having walked down the passage outside the Court when you were looking the
other way? &mdash; I presume so.</p>

  <p>Did she say she could not recognise him by anything else? &mdash; No, I
did not hear her say that.</p>

  <p>Were you in the Court? &mdash; I was.</p>

  <p>I mean you give that now as your accurate testimony? &mdash; Yes. "When
she was in the Court, do you say that she positively identified the man at the
first attempt? &mdash; No, I do not think she did; I think she said, "That is
very like the man," or some words to that effect.</p>

  <p>Did she use the words when she was asked, "<i>Q.</i> Now, do you see the
man here you saw that night? &mdash; <i>A.</i> One is very suspicious, if
anything"? &mdash; Yes, she made a remark something to that effect.</p>

  <p>And that was the first remark she made? &mdash; After the accused was in
the Court.</p>

  <p>That was the first remark she made under examination by Mr. Fox? &mdash;
I think it was. "I am not quite sure, but I think it is"; I did not hear all
that she said, but I remember hearing that remark.</p>

  <p>I mean, one would like to know how much you heard and how much you did
not; were you present during the whole examination of Lambie. and are you
prepared to tell us what she said? &mdash; I am not prepared to tell you all
she said.</p>

  <p>But you remember this, however, that the first remark she made was that
she was suspicious, if anything? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Now, later did you hear her say that "The clothes he had on that night he
has not got on to-day, but his face I could not tell"; did you hear her say
that? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>How can you account for missing that? &mdash; Well, there was a big noise
going on, bustling about, and you could not hear all that she said, and she
spoke very low; I was some little distance from her, and I could not hear all
she said, but it is quite possible she said that.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; How far would you be away from her? &mdash; About 8
yards, I would say.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; I want to ask you this; I think you
said that she identified the man without hesitation? &mdash; Commissioner
Shields asked her to look round the Court-room and see if she could point to
the man that she had seen in the hall that night, and she, as I have already
described, looked round and pointed out the accused.</p>

  <p>Do you say it was without hesitation when she began by intimating that
she was very suspicious, if anything? &mdash; Well, it depends on how you put
it.</p>

  <p>Well, it is a great deal in this case how it is put; would you tell me
whether you call that unhesitating identification? &mdash; Certainly it was
hesitating.</p>

  <p>Not confident? &mdash; There seemed to be a want of confidence to speak
straight out, or stupidity, I could not say which; she seemed a bit excited.</p>

  <p>She was stupid and excited? &mdash; There is no doubt she was.</p>

  <p>And hesitating? &mdash; Yes, a little.</p>

  <p>What did she say about his walk which identified him? &mdash; Well, she
was asked to exhibit the manner in which he walked, and she tried to do so.</p>

  <p>Was there anything very characteristic? &mdash; No, I could not see very
much about it.</p>

  <p>You saw nothing very peculiar in it? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Nothing to distinguish the walk from the walk of many other men? &mdash;
Well, the only thing that I have seen about his walk is that his left foot is a
little in-toed.</p>

  <p>Is that the only thing you have observed? &mdash; That is the only thing
I have observed.</p>

  <p>What is the thing called a shaking of the shoulders which is mentioned by
Lambie? &mdash; I should fancy a rocking gait.</p>

  <p>Have you observed a rocking gait also? &mdash; Slightly.</p>

  <p>Why did you not tell us that just now when you told us all you observed
was a hen-toe? &mdash; That is all; he shoves his shoulders forward a
little.</p>

  <p>And you have told us you have seen nothing characteristic except the hen-
toe? &mdash; It is not very conspicuous.</p>

  <p>Do you say that an identification from Slater's walk would be one that
would impress you? &mdash; Not from his walk altogether.</p>

  <p>Suppose you had nothing but the walk to go upon, would you have any
confidence in your identification? &mdash; No, not quite absolute.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Is there anything characteristic in his walk at all,
and, if so, what? &mdash; Well, he is a little in-toed in the left foot, and
when he lifts his foot to walk he throws out his knee a little; you require to
look minutely at him before you observe it.</p>

  <p>Nothing that would attract your attention specially? &mdash; No, I do not
think I would take any particular notice of it, except if I was asked to do so
or taking particular notice.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; Did you hear the girl Lambie say over
in America in answer to a question this &mdash; the question is "<i>Q.</i>
Didn't you state a moment ago that you did not see the man's face? &mdash;
<i>A.</i> Neither I did, I saw him walk; it is not the face I went by, but the
walk"; did you hear her say that? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you say now that the walk is not one that would attract your
attention? &mdash; It is not very conspicuous, except if you are looking
carefully at the person.</p>

  <p>Is it a thing that you would expect to be picked out in a walk of some 3
yards across a lobby? &mdash; It depends entirely upon how you are looking at
it; one might observe it and another might not.</p>

  <p>But you would have no great confidence in that being picked out? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; The period of observation would be something under
two seconds? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; Do you not think that the attention
of the people, if they were looking at a man who was in the lobby, would be
mainly directed to his face? &mdash; I should think so, but it is not for me to
say; I do not know how they were looking.</p>

  <p>If you saw a stranger in the lobby you would not look to see if he had a
hen -toe at first? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did the woman Lambie tell you he was a clean-shaven man? &mdash; She told
me he was clean shaven that night.</p>

  <p>If she never saw his face could you understand that? &mdash; Well, it is
difficult.</p>

  <p>Now, I may take it, I suppose, from you who were present time after time
in the examination in America, Lambie was asked by what she identified him, and
she said consistently that she did not see his face, and it was by his walk
alone? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>The girl called Barrowman was examined in America also in your presence?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you say that when she was first examined in America her
identification was confident? &mdash; She picked out the man. She was asked to
point him out.</p>

  <p>Did she say, "That is the man"? &mdash; She pointed out the accused.</p>

  <p>But did she say that that was the man? &mdash; She said that he was very
like the man at first, and then she said that he was the man.</p>

  <p>Do you remember her being asked whether the man was there, and she
replied, "That man here is very like him"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Then the two lawyers got talking, the one saying, "The man here is
something like it," while Mr. Fox said, "Very like it," and the witness said,
"I said something like him the first time, and then very like him after I had
said something like him"? &mdash; Yes, I remember that.</p>

  <p>Would you call that a confident identification? &mdash; No, I would
not.</p>

  <p>That identification by both of these women which I have put to you just
now is after the remark outside the Court which you say you heard? &mdash; That
is so.</p>

  <p>And in the case of Barrowman, at least, it was after she had seen the
photograph of the man? &mdash; Yes, quite so.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me if there was anything special about the man by which the
girl Barrowman claimed to identify him? &mdash; She identified his nose
principally.</p>

  <p>Was not that the only thing she professed to go by? &mdash; Yes, by the
face.</p>

  <p>And her previous opportunity of seeing that had been, I think, while the
man was running past' her on the street on 21st December in the vicinity of a
lamp? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>She described it, I think, as a twisted nose? &mdash; Yes, or turned a
little to the right side.</p>

  <p>I ask the accused to stand up. Does that man's nose turn any way to the
side when you regard his front face? &mdash; No, I do not see much twist in it.
It is somewhat peculiar, but otherwise there is no twist in it.</p>

  <p>The profile creates an impression which the front face does not? &mdash;
That is so.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Did the witness Barrowman say for about what
distance she had had the man in view? &mdash; She explained to me at the time
that when he came down the stair he stood at the bottom step leading to the
pavement for a little, hesitating, looking to the right, and then he turned
towards her and ran past her while she was standing under the lamp post.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; Now, after this identification in
America the girls were brought back? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And, of course, when they were taken into the police office to identify
Slater they were looking for the man they had seen in America? &mdash; I
presume they were.</p>

  <p>May I take it that when they looked for the man they had seen in America
among these policemen at the police office and the two railway officials there
was no person who bore a foreign appearance or was the least like Slater except
himself? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>I wish to ask you this &mdash; I have already asked detective Trench
&mdash; have you considered that to be a fair way of conducting an
identification, to have the only man that they hope to identify in the presence
of a number of others who do not bear to him the least resemblance? &mdash; I
do not know that it is for me to say whether it is fair or not. It is a matter
over which I had no control.</p>

  <p>What you mean is that you do not want to criticise your superior officer?
&mdash; I do not.</p>

  <p>When you said that Slater was allowed to take up any position he chose in
the police office that was really no use, was it? He was the only man the least
like Slater there? &mdash; Yes, he was the only man like Slater.</p>

  <p>Did he ask to be allowed to take up any special position? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>He allowed you to show him off to these people in any position you chose?
&mdash; Yes,</p>

  <p>Did you march them and make them turn their heads, and so on, and Slater
never objected? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>Were you present when Miss Cunningham was down to identify the man?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Had she been shown a photograph before? &mdash; I cannot tell.</p>

  <p>During the process of identification did you put any coat upon the
accused that was not his own? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Whose coat did you put on? &mdash; I cannot tell you. I did not put it
on, but I saw one put on.</p>

  <p>Was he identified in that coat? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>By whom? &mdash; The girl Barrowman.</p>

  <p>Did the coat differ from the waterproof coat? &mdash; No, it was exactly
the same pattern and colour.</p>

  <p>Was it a different length? &mdash; No, it was the same length.</p>

  <p>Why did you not put on his own coat? &mdash; It was not available at the
time.</p>

  <p>Was the coat you put on a short coat? &mdash; I did not put it on.</p>

  <p>Did you see it put on? &mdash; I saw him with a coat on, but I do not
know where it came from.</p>

  <p>Was it down to his knees? &mdash; It was below his knees a little.</p>

  <p>In America you took possession of the man's luggage? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Have you been through the whole of his luggage? &mdash; Along with Mr.
Warnock I went through it all. I did not take an inventory.</p>

  <p>You went through it with the express purpose of finding garments in his
baggage which would tally with the descriptions you had got? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And also with the purpose, I suppose, of looking for blood stains?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How many suits had he? &mdash; A great number.</p>

  <p>May I take it that there is no coat, waistcoat, or pair of trousers found
in his baggage which bears the slightest appearance of blood? &mdash; I saw no
blood on any of his garments.</p>

  <p>And you searched for it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you find among his baggage anywhere a pair of brown boots? &mdash;
No, I did not see them.</p>

  <p>If you had found them you would have produced them. Did you find other
boots? &mdash; Yes. I think there was another pair of boots and some
slippers.</p>

  <p>Do you mean there was only one other pair of boots? &mdash; Yes. There
may have been more, but I do not remember of there being more.</p>

  <p>But were you not searching? &mdash; I looked over them; I looked simply
for garments that he was described as having been seen wearing, or I was
looking for blood stains.</p>

  <p>You searched for brown boots and you got none? &mdash; I did not see any
brown boots.</p>

  <p>Did you get what is commonly called a Donegal hat anywhere? &mdash; The
hats that have been produced are the only ones I found.</p>

  <p>Were there not a great many hats and caps in the man's baggage? &mdash; I
did not see a great many.</p>

  <p>There were more than those that have been produced? &mdash; I do not
remember seeing any more hats.</p>

  <p>I put it to you there were about seven or eight hats and caps in his
baggage? &mdash; That is possible. I did not see them.</p>

  <p>Who would see them? &mdash; Mr. Warnock may have seen them.</p>

  <p>There is none that you would describe as a Donegal, and you did not find
brown boots. Did you find any checked trousers? &mdash; No, I do not think so.
There were some striped trousers.</p>

  <p>Any fawn-coloured spats? &mdash; No, no spats at all. I saw none.</p>

  <p>A great many coats? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And they were all minutely examined? &mdash; Yes. Now, with regard to the
coat which is produced, what did you find on it? Anything of an incriminating
nature? &mdash; I cannot say what that is. There were several dark stains, but
what these are I do not know.</p>

  <p>Are they very minute? &mdash; They are not very distinct, but they are
visible.</p>

  <p>Did you see the room and the body lying in it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was there not a good deal of blood splashed about? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were the fire-irons not merely covered with mere sparks, but with a great
deal of blood? &mdash; Quite a number of sparks.</p>

  <p>Does not the coal scuttle show lots of blood? &mdash; Yes, quite a number
of sparks.</p>

  <p>Are there not splashes running right down it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>There are signs on it of blood having run down the whole length of the
coal scuttle? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>There were bits of the woman's brain found on the rug? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And a great deal of blood on the carpet? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>There was a rug over the top of her? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Had not that rug blood on both sides? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did it bear the appearance of having been put over her to cover her after
she was dead? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>There was blood on the top side of the rug as it lay over her. I show you
label No. 17, the second rug. Was not the hairy side of that rug covered with
blood &mdash; was there not a lot of blood on it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was not the end doubled back over the woman? &mdash; It was lying flat, I
think.</p>

  <p>Was it not doubled back over the woman? &mdash; Yes, it was lying right
over her body. That may have been caused by the constable who lifted it before
I went there. He lifted it and saw the body.</p>

  <p>Was she lying upon this rug to any extent? &mdash; No, she was not on it
at all. She was lying on the other rug.</p>

  <p>This second rug was on top of her? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>With the hairy side on the top of her body? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>If that be so, how would the blood which appears on the other side have
come there? &mdash; The place was smeared with blood, and throwing it off and
throwing it down blood may have gone on to the other side in that way.</p>

  <p>Would it not have come from the weapons or from the clothes of the
murderer? &mdash; It might have come from the clothing or from the other rug.
It could have got there in different ways.</p>

  <p>From the condition in which you found the room, and from the amount of
blood that was spread about, can you conceive of the man having executed that
murder without having splashed himself a good deal with blood? &mdash; I would
fancy he would have stains of blood over his clothing.</p>

  <p>And a lot of it? &mdash; Yes, I should say a good deal of it.</p>

  <p>Would you expect more than the doubtful spots you found upon that
waterproof? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Why? Was there any mark of blood behind the chair?
&mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Suppose the old lady was hit from behind, would the person so hitting
her, do you expect, bear any mark of blood if no blood was found behind the
chair? &mdash; I cannot say; the blood might have been on the clothes or it
might not. It depends on how the blow was given.</p>

  <p>There was no blood on the table? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; Was not the chair set in to the table
as if the old lady had been reading at the table? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And her back was rather towards the door? &mdash; She was lying on her
back.</p>

  <p>Must not the murderer have dealt considerably with her body, because was
not her chest found completely collapsed? &mdash; I cannot tell.</p>

  <p>The ribs were all broken? &mdash; The doctors will be able to speak to
that.</p>

  <p>Do you not know that? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was not her head all smashed to pieces? &mdash; Yes, I saw that.</p>

  <p>Do you not think that the probabilities are that the person who achieved
all that upon the body of the woman would exhibit blood stains on himself?
&mdash; It depended on how the sparks of blood went and how the woman was
struck.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; But you assent to the probabilities? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; The probability is that there would be
a great deal more blood than was found on that coat? &mdash; I should fancy
that there would be some sparks of blood.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Do you know where that red rug usually lay? &mdash;
It usually lay in front of a sideboard, on the other side of the room
altogether from where the lady was sitting. It had evidently been lifted from
there and thrown over.</p>

  <p>That would all increase the probability of the man getting some blood on
him? &mdash; (No answer.)</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; Now, about the hammer (label No. 47).
Take it that the head of the woman was extensively smashed so that the brains
were out in portions and the head had deep holes in. it and the ribs were
smashed, is that weapon that you have in your hand the least likely to have
caused injuries to that extent? &mdash; It would certainly have required great
force to do it.</p>

  <p>Is it in the least likely to be a weapon to do it? &mdash; I would not
say it is not.</p>

  <p>But would you say that it was? &mdash; I would not like to say.</p>

  <p>Would it not give the man a great deal of trouble and an immense deal of
labour to smash the woman up in that way with a hammer like that? &mdash; It
would require a great deal of force.</p>

  <p>Would you not have thought that a hammer with a larger surface would have
been necessary for the extensive smashing that there was in this case? &mdash;
I would not say so.</p>

  <p>That is a light hammer? &mdash; Yes, but if it was used with force it
would have bad effects-.</p>

  <p>Show me where the blood stains are on that hammer? &mdash; I do not say
that there are any.</p>

  <p>Is it your theory that that hammer has been scraped? &mdash; It seems to
me to have been scraped.</p>

  <p>Is it your theory that the hammer was originally varnished or anything of
that kind? &mdash; You can see that it has been tampered with in some way.
Something has been done in the way of cleaning it up.</p>

  <p>Do you see coal dust at the top of the stick where it joins the hammer
head? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Towards the lower part of the shaft, where there is a difference between
it and the upper part of the shaft, does not that look as if a dirty hand had
grasped the hammer? &mdash; It is possible.</p>

  <p>Is there, in your opinion, any more difference between the top and the
bottom of that hammer than what you would expect if the hammer had a plain
wooden handle and a dirty hand had been in the habit of grasping it at the
foot? &mdash; It is rough at the top as if it had been rubbed with
something.</p>

  <p>Look at that new hammer which we have produced. Is that an exact replica
of the hammer (label No. 47)? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>The same size exactly? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Has it not got the same kind of handle? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is there any more signs of scraping on the one than on the other? &mdash;
The one is new and the other has been used.</p>

  <p>But is there any sign on either of scraping up towards the hammer head?
&mdash; Yes, the new hammer is all the same, whereas the other is smooth at the
top and the bottom half is rough.</p>

  <p>I show you label No. 48. Did you find in Slater's box four different
implements exactly corresponding to the four implements which I show you on
this card? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were these recovered? &mdash; I did not recover these.</p>

  <p>Suppose somebody with a hand covered with coal dust gripped this new
hammer, would you expect that the clean hammer would become exactly like that
after a little use? &mdash; It might.</p>

  <p>Do you persist at all that there has been obvious scraping? &mdash; I
cannot say what it has been. I simply say there has been some rubbing. Whether
it has been tear and wear I do not know.</p>

  <p>You mean rubbing at the lower part? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>But there is nothing like scraping at the other part? &mdash; You call it
the upper part.</p>

  <p>(The hammers were handed to the jury for inspection.)</p>

  <p>You said at the end of your examination &mdash; I do not know why you
emphasised it &mdash; that it took seven and a half minutes' walking to go from
the door of Miss Gilchrist's house to a Subway station. Which Subway station?
&mdash; The station in South Woodside Road.</p>

  <p>Is that by Kelvinbridge? &mdash; By West Princes Street. It is near
Kelvinbridge, and is called the Kelvinbridge station.</p>

  <p>Was the person who was supposed to have committed this crime seen at the
Kelvinbridge station, or reported to have been seen there? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Somebody answering to the description? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>At what hour? &mdash; I do not know. I did not take the statement from
the person who spoke to that.</p>

  <p>At what hour do you take it that this crime was committed? &mdash; It
must have been between 7 and 7.15, or between 7 and 7.30.</p>

  <p>So a direct run by the murderer &mdash; if it was he &mdash; on the route
you have mentioned should have brought him up there, I suppose, by something
about twenty minutes past seven? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>A walk would have taken him there just after twenty minutes past seven?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Then there is another thing I want to ask you; was anybody seen running
in the direction you have spoken of? &mdash; The girl Barrowman described that
the man was running west along West Princes Street.</p>

  <p>How far? &mdash; As far as West Cumberland Street she took notice of him,
she said.</p>

  <p>I mean, he did not run straight along to this Subway, but turned to the
left along West Cumberland Street? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was anybody else seen running along there? &mdash; A Miss Brown speaks of
two men running along this direction.</p>

  <p>That is two other men entirely separate? &mdash; They were two
together.</p>

  <p>I mean, they were not Slater; they were not the men who went down West
Cumberland Street? &mdash; Well, I do not know whether it was or not; you will
get that from the witnesses.</p>

  <p>At any rate, running straight down in the direction of the Subway, there
were two men seen running? &mdash; Yes, Miss Brown speaks to that.</p>

  <p>And then Barrowman says there was a single man seen running, who turned
to his left down West Cumberland Street? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And was that at or about the same time &mdash; both of them? &mdash;
Well, near the same time.</p>

  <p>Is Miss Brown coming? &mdash; She is here to-day.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Were there a number of men who
were clean shaven in the Court-house at New York? &mdash; Oh, quite a
number.</p>

  <p>Were there a number of clean-shaven men in the Central Office in Glasgow?
&mdash; There were.</p>

  <p>Were all the men different &mdash; just ordinary types of men that you
see in the streets? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>Did either of the girls ever point to anybody in the room, either in New
York or in the Central Office, except Slater? &mdash; Except the one man,
no.</p>

  <p>Did they ever hesitate between him and somebody else? &mdash; Never.</p>

  <p>Do you recollect that the girl Barrowman in your presence was asked the
question in New York, "Did you see the man here you saw that night?" and then
the accused's agent said, "I think she ought to be asked to describe him"?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And then she described him? &mdash; She described him.</p>

  <p>And then do you recollect the Commissioner said, "Is the man in this room
among all these men here that you saw that night"? and Barrowman answered,
"That man here is very like him"? &mdash; These are her words.</p>

  <p>And then do you recollect that the accused's agent, Mr. Miller, said,
"The man here is something like him"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And Mr. Fox, for the Crown, said, "She said very like him"? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>And is it not the fact that the girl Barrowman said, "He is very like
him"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And then do you recollect the witness saying, "I said 'something like
him' the first time, and then 'very like' after I had said 'something like
him'"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Now, did she take a careful look at the man? &mdash; She did.</p>

  <p>It was not a mere casual glance? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>She looked carefully at him? &mdash; Yes, he was asked to stand up.</p>

  <p>And when she had looked carefully at him did she then say he was very
like him? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And then do you recollect the Commissioner said, "Point the man out," and
did she point him out? &mdash; She pointed him out.</p>

  <p>Without hesitation? &mdash; Without hesitation.</p>

  <p>Now, do you say the same of the witness Helen Lambie, that she never
hesitated between this man and anybody else? &mdash; Never.</p>

  <p>Did you see anything in his gait apart from the way in which he turned in
his left foot; did you see anything in his gait when he moved along which is
peculiar? &mdash; He puts his shoulders forward as he steps along in a rocking
gait, slightly.</p>

  <p>Suppose you saw him walking, taking both this rolling movement you have
described and this turn of his left foot, would that strike you as peculiar?
&mdash; Putting everything together it is noticeable, I should fancy; it is
observable if you were looking at the person minutely.</p>

  <p>And with such light as you saw, and the distance from the room out to the
stair, would there be sufficient opportunity for the girl to see his way of
walking? &mdash; Yes, if she looked to see &mdash; if she was looking at his
feet.</p>

  <p>Or his shoulders? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you hear her say in New York that the man held down his head as he
came out? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Did you recover Slater's luggage from the boat?
&mdash; No, we recovered it from the Government stores in New York &mdash;
sealed.</p>

  <p>You do not know where the box containing the coat and the hammer was
during the voyage &mdash; whether it was down in the hold or whether it was
under Slater's control? &mdash; It was down in the hold, and Mr. Warnock had
the keys of all the boxes.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether, at the time that the warrant was issued for Slater's
apprehension, it was known that the diamond brooch which he had pawned was not
the same as that which was amissing? &mdash; It was known from the very start
that it was not the same.</p><br>

  <p>ARTHUR MONTAGUE ADAMS, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I live at 51
West Princes Street, Glasgow. It was called 14 Queen's Terrace. It is next door
to No. 15, Miss Gilchrist's house, immediately to the west. My house is on the
ground floor. It is entered by a front door up six steps from the pavement. My
door is on the same level as the door of the closemouth leading to Miss
Gilchrist's house. Her dining-room is just over my dining-room. I knew Miss
Gilchrist as a neighbour only. I did not visit. My mother and five sisters live
in the same house with me. On Monday night, 21st December last, I was in my
house after six o'clock. About seven o'clock I was sitting in the dining-room
with my two sisters, Laura and Rowena. When I was sitting there I heard a sound
like a thud, and three distinct knocks, as if wanting assistance, up above in
Miss Gilchrist's dining-room. My sister Laura drew my attention to it.</p>

  <p>Did she suggest that you should go up and see if anything was wrong?
&mdash; She sent me up instantly. The door at the closemouth was ajar. I did
not require to ring; it was open. I went right upstairs to Miss Gilchrist's
door. I rang the bell three times for certain. I rang it hard &mdash; rude
rings. Her house door was apparently locked. There is a glass panel on each
side of the door. Looking through it I could see quite distinctly that the
lobby gas was lit. I listened for any sounds inside the house. After I had been
standing at the door for half a minute or so I heard what I thought was the
.servant breaking sticks in the kitchen; I could not say what it was; that was
only my surmise. It seemed as if it was some one chopping sticks &mdash; not
heavy blows. At that time I did not know whether Miss Gilchrist's maid-servant
was out or not; I imagined that she was in. I know her by sight quite well. I
waited fully a minute or a minute and a half at the door.</p>

  <p>Did you hear any further sound? &mdash; I just heard what I thought was
the girl breaking sticks.</p>

  <p>Afterwards? &mdash; While I was at the door.</p>

  <p>But did you hear it going on and then stopping, and then resuming again,
or was it continuous? &mdash; I formed the opinion that the girl was doing up
her kitchen, and that she was not going to open the door. I could not really
properly explain it. After waiting for a minute or two I went downstairs again
and entered my own house. I left the door at the close-mouth ajar just as I had
found it. I went into the dining-room again. I told my sisters the house was
all lit up, and I did not think there was anything wrong; I thought it was the
girl. My sister Laura thought otherwise. She made me go back again. She thought
there must be something wrong. Without sitting down or waiting any time I
returned upstairs to Miss Gilchrist's door. I gave the door bell an ordinary
good pull. I did not hear any sound the second time. I stood, after pulling the
bell; I had my hand on the door bell when I heard footsteps in the close. This
was the servant girl, Helen Lambie. When the girl came up I told her I thought
there was something wrong, or something seriously wrong; I cannot give you the
exact words. She told me that it was the pulleys in the kitchen that I had
heard.</p>

  <p><a id="pic8" name="pic8"></a></p><br>

  <div align="center"><img src="1202631h-images/OscarSlater08.jpg" title="Outer side of
house door"></div><br>

  <p>Did the girl put two keys into the locks and open the doors? &mdash; She
opened the door, but I cannot say whether there were two keys or not. I was
standing at the back of her. I said I would wait. She opened the door.</p>

  <p>Will you now tell us what happened in your own words? &mdash; Well, there
is a bedroom over there (pointing to the right); say, that is the bedroom, and
there is the drawing-room, this is the door where I am standing now. The dining-
room is on the left-hand side, and then there is an old-fashioned grandfather's
clock between that, and just over on that side of the kitchen. I stood at the
door on the threshold, half in and half out, and just when the girl had got
past the clock to go into the kitchen a well-dressed man appeared. I did not
suspect him, and she said nothing, and he came up to me quite pleasantly. I did
not suspect anything wrong for a minute. I thought the man was going to speak
to me, till he got past me, and then I suspected something wrong, and by that
time the girl ran into the kitchen and put the gas up, and said it was all
right, meaning her pulleys. I said, "Where is your mistress?" and she went into
the dining-room. She said, "Oh, come here"; I just went in and saw the horrible
spectacle, and I said, "Go to the closemouth and stand there till I come back."
I went down to St. George's Road, and I could see no people there, but I could
see up to Park Road, and could see people in the distance, and I made after him
as hard as I could go, but it was no use.</p>

  <p>Did you see the man go downstairs? &mdash; I saw the man walk quite
coolly till he got up to me, and then he went down quickly, like greased
lightning, and that aroused my suspicions. He walked coolly till he got past
me, and then he went down quickly and banged the door at the foot of the close.
I heard him going rapidly down the stair.</p>

  <p>Will you describe the man you saw to the best of your ability? &mdash;
Well, it was a passing view I got of him. He was a man a little taller than me,
a little broader in the shoulders; not a well-built man, but well featured and
clean shaven, and I cannot exactly swear to his moustache, but if he had any it
was very little. He was leather a commercial traveller's type, or perhaps a
clerk, and I did not know but what he might be some of her friends. He had on
dark trousers and a light overcoat; whether it was fawn or grey I could not
really say. I do not recollect what sort of hat he had; I am not sure on that
point. He seemed gentlemanly and well dressed. He had nothing in his hand so
far as I could tell. I did not notice anything about his way of walking at
all.</p>

  <p>Did you see him at all after he passed you; did you look round to see him
disappear down the stairs? &mdash; I got a good view; I saw him run down the
stair, but he was too quick for me. I mean he darted down immediately he had
passed me.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; He left the house door open.</p>

  <p>Examination continued &mdash; Could you tell he was coming from the
direction of the large bedroom? &mdash; Yes, now that I know where the bedroom
is. I just took a look into the dining-room before I went down the stairs. I
saw Miss Gilchrist lying covered up with a rug. with her feet towards the door
and her head towards the fireplace, but I did not touch her; I thought my best
plan was to make after the man as quickly as possible. When I failed to get on
his track I came back to the house. I then found the servant and a constable in
it. The constable and I entered the dining-room together. We uncovered the body
and found she had been battered to death, but she was breathing &mdash; just
breathing. I went for Dr. Adams as hard as I could go. I brought another
constable, and I 'phoned to the police office. I myself waited in the house for
the police; I waited there till eleven o'clock. I had not on my spectacles at
the time.</p>

  <p>Did you form any sort of idea about the age of the man? &mdash; Well, I
said in my deposition he was between twenty five and thirty, I thought. I did
not hear any sound as of Miss Gilchrist's bell being rung that night. I noticed
her bell being rung, but I did not notice it that night. I might miss that. I
was occupied at the time in the dining-room. I was tying up a parcel for a
young lady to send away some groceries. I do not always notice when her bell is
rung. I did not see the girl go out for a newspaper; I got the girl in the
close. I did not know at the time that there was nobody in the house except
Miss Gilchrist; I know that there were just her and a maid living there &mdash;
that there were just the two of them. I went to America with Warnock and Pyper,
and with the two female witnesses Lambie and Barrowman. When I arrived there I
recollect that before going to the Court-house I was shown a photograph in Mr.
Fox's office. That was a newspaper cutting.</p>

  <p>Was it a good photograph or a bad one as far as you could judge? &mdash;
I really could not judge from the photograph at all. When we were being
examined we were all together in the Commissioner's room in New York. There
were a number of people in the room. I did not see Slater come into the room.
He was in the room before I came in. When he came in I was standing up against
the wall. There were a number of men in the room. I think I sat on a chair when
I was being examined. I was asked to point out among the men present the man
that I had seen that night. I pointed out Slater, but I did not say that he was
the man. I said he closely resembled the man. Slater was the only man I did
point out as closely resembling him.</p>

  <p>Had you any difficulty between him and the other men there? &mdash; The
general appearance of the man was all I went by.</p>

  <p>Was he the only man amongst all the men pointed out? &mdash; Yes, as
resembling the man that came out of that house.</p>

  <p>From what was it that you judged that he was like the man or resembled
the man you saw? &mdash; His general appearance.</p>

  <p>Did you notice if there were other clean-shaven men there? &mdash; Oh,
there were all sorts of men. The room was pretty full; there were a good few
people there.</p>

  <p>Was he handcuffed or was there anything distinctive about his appearance?
&mdash; I thought he had rather a superior appearance.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; There was nothing to mark him out as a prisoner. He
was just sitting twiddling his thumbs like that. (Illustrating.)</p>

  <p>Examination continued &mdash; I came home from America after being
examined in New York. I was examined twice in New York, on two successive days,
but on the second day there was nothing asked hardly; it was only a word or
two. The first day was the day of examination for identification. After I came
back to this country I saw Slater again in the Central Police Office. I am not
sure of the date, but it was in February some time. I should think there would
be a dozen men any way &mdash; perhaps more &mdash; in the room at the Central
Police Office. I pointed out Slater again. I said of him in the Central Police
Office the same as I said in New York. I had no difficulty in pointing him out
from all the other men in the room in Glasgow, as in New York. I did not
hesitate between him and somebody else.</p>

  <p>And was it again just from your general recollection and the general
appearance of the man? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; In New York you were all together
in a room while. the depositions were made before the Commissioner? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>And you were taken successively on to this chair? &mdash; The second day
I was examined; the first day I had nothing to say at all; it was the second
day, as far as I remember, that I was asked.</p>

  <p>Were you not examined on the 26th of January? &mdash; I could not give
the exact date.</p>

  <p>Was it the day after your arrival? &mdash; No, I was not examined that
day; it must have been the following day, as far as I can tell you.</p>

  <p>Were you present when the girl Barrowman and the other girl Lambie made
their statements in America? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And they made their statements before you did? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And, of course, both Lambie and Barrowman had indicated that Slater was
very like the man before you went on to the witness stand to give your
statement? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you knew precisely where the man in question was sitting when you
went on to the chair? &mdash; Yes, I admit that.</p>

  <p>So that when he was shown to you in America he was not placed among a lot
of other men of the same appearance? &mdash; There was Slater, and then came
Mr. Goodhart and Mr. Miller, but I knew who Mr. Miller was, because he asked me
if my name was Adams, and if I was a Crown witness, and I said yes.</p>

  <p>Sitting in a row there was Mr. Miller, that was Slater's counsel or agent
in America? &mdash; I suppose they are both his agents.</p>

  <p>And then Goodhart had something to do with the case also? &mdash; Yes, he
had got to do with it, but Mr. Miller was pleading.</p>

  <p>Mr. Miller was pleading, and Mr. Goodhart was telling him what to plead?
&mdash; I suppose so.</p>

  <p>And Slater was there? &mdash; I suppose that is the way of it.</p>

  <p>And Slater had been pointed out twice already before you proceeded to
give your evidence? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>And even after all you have heard you do not give an absolutely confident
opinion that that was the man? &mdash; No, it is too serious a charge for me to
say from a passing glance.</p>

  <p>Do you say you had a passing glance? &mdash; Well, you know the time it
takes for a man to come from a room.</p>

  <p>You identified him as a clean-shaven man? &mdash; I meant from here
(indicating the upper lip); but there was very little on it.</p>

  <p>Did you not say clean shaven? &mdash; If he had a moustache he had not
any more than I have got, and that is not much.</p>

  <p>You are not clean shaven? &mdash; Well, very near it.</p>

  <p>I see in America you were asked, "What did his face look like?" and you
said, "Just an ordinary face, a sharp-featured man, nothing special about him,
clean shaven"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>That is what you mean still? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Then the agent asked you, and you said he ha-d a hat on; you said, "I
think it was a hat, I do not say he had, but I think so"? &mdash; Yes, I said
it was not a cap; I wanted to explain to him that I could not be sure on that
point.</p>

  <p>Was it a bowler hat, or do you mean you do not know what it was? &mdash;
I have said I am not sure on that point; I have said that all along.</p>

  <p>You would not identify it as a Donegal hat? &mdash; No, I did not know
what a Donegal hat was until I was told about it.</p>

  <p>You have heard about that now? &mdash; Yes, plenty.</p>

  <p>Do you know now what a Donegal hat is? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Well, it was not that? &mdash; No; of course, I did not pay much
attention to the hat.</p>

  <p>Then I think you were asked, "Did you notice anything remarkable about
his gait and walk?" and you said, "No, I thought he walked like a commercial
traveller"? &mdash; No, I said I thought he had the appearance of a commercial
traveller.</p>

  <p>And then you were asked "An ordinary walk?" and you said "Just an
ordinary walk"? &mdash; As far as I could tell.</p>

  <p>At the time you went to this door, the door was opened by Lambie, who had
the keys? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Now, did you stand upon the mat outside? &mdash; No, I stood over the
threshold of the door.</p>

  <p>Where did Lambie go? &mdash; Lambie made straight for the kitchen.</p>

  <p>Now, when the door was opened the first time was anybody in the hall?
&mdash; No.</p>

  <p>I think I heard you say that Lambie had got along as far as the clock on
her way to the kitchen before a man appeared? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>Then, would it be incorrect for Lambie to say she was at the door when
the man passed her? &mdash; Well, I think so, but I think the girl was
excited.</p>

  <p>That is not in accordance with her recollection? &mdash; No, I have
nothing to do with her recollection.</p>

  <p>At the time the man passed you where was Lambie? &mdash; She was in the
hall.</p>

  <p>By the clock, you mean? &mdash; No, the man passed, and she went into the
kitchen and just came out and told me it was all right. I took that to mean
that it was the pulleys in the kitchen.</p>

  <p>Where was the man who had come out of the room when Lambie came back and
said to you, "It's all right"? &mdash; He was down the stair.</p>

  <p>Had Lambie gone into the kitchen by the time the man passed you? &mdash;
No, I think the man had passed me before she went into the kitchen, as far as I
remember.</p>

  <p>And then, as I understand, if you stood at the door the man was walking
towards the door from the right hand side of the hall? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And Lambie was going towards the left hand corner to get into the
kitchen? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Past a clock halfway down? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You said you had a passing glance at the man as he went past you? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you see anything special about his nose? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>It did not attract your attention? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>His walk did not attract your attention? &mdash; No, but his dress did.</p>

  <p>But not the hat? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>And not the boots; you did not see them? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>What kind of trousers had he? &mdash; they were dark.</p>

  <p>And a light coat? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You said that the coat was either fawn or grey; are you definite about
its colour? &mdash; No, it was a light coat.</p>

  <p>That is all you know? &mdash; That is all.</p>

  <p>How far had the man got down the stair before you started going down
after him? &mdash; I had just time to go into the room &mdash; I looked into
the room, and the girl said, "Oh, you go down the stairs as quick as you can,"
and I went down the steps, and nearly fell down.</p>

  <p>Can you give any idea as to how long you would be in the house after the
man passed you at the door before you started after him? &mdash; Not more than
half a minute.</p>

  <p>Did you say that he went down like greased lightning? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You mean that he went down as fast as he could? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you thought at that time that he was anxious to get away as fast as
possible? &mdash; I knew he was a thief then.</p>

  <p>When you went into the dining-room Miss Gilchrist was lying on her back?
&mdash; Yes, but I did not uncover her at all the first time.</p>

  <p>What had she over her? &mdash; She had a big rug over her.</p>

  <p>She was lying on the top of the hearth rug, with her head rather towards
the fire? &mdash; Yes, and with her feet towards the door.</p>

  <p>In a diagonal position? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>There was a lot of blood about her, as you saw afterwards? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>The other rug that had been produced was laid on the top of her? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you remember whether it had the hairy side up? &mdash; Yes, the hairy
side was up.</p>

  <p>And the other side was on the top of the lady? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you notice that there was a great deal of blood on the hair also of
that rug? &mdash; No, I did not observe that. It nearly made me sick.</p>

  <p>You did not look at it too much? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>From where you were when the man came out do you think you were in a
better position to observe the man than Helen Lambie? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Why do you say so? &mdash; Because I practically faced him. He did not
cross the hall, but walked quite coolly as if the house belonged to him.</p>

  <p>Lambie in the meantime was on the other side of the hall, near the clock?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You say decidedly that you had a better opportunity of seeing him?
&mdash; Yes, I have no doubt about that at all.</p>

  <p>At this time, I understand, it was your sister, Miss Laura Adams, who
asked you to go upstairs? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was Mrs. Liddell also in the house at the time? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How long had she been in? &mdash; She came in at five minutes to seven
with my mother. The whole thing was done by ten minutes past seven.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Would a couple of steps or so
take Helen Lambie in so far as you saw her? &mdash; She was further in than
that.</p>

  <p>How many steps was she in? &mdash; Eight or ten I would say &mdash;
perhaps a little more &mdash; between the kitchen and the dining-room.</p>

  <p>How many steps would she be in at the time when the man appeared? &mdash;
She was just going to enter the kitchen.</p>

  <p>Did she have an opportunity of seeing the man? &mdash; Yes, she saw the
man, because she stood and stared and did not open her mouth.</p>

  <p>When he passed her? &mdash; Yes, she had a good enough view of the man.</p>

  <p>She turned round? &mdash; Yes, she stood and looked, and never said a
word.</p>

  <p>Was she plainly taken aback? &mdash; Yes, thoroughly. That is my
impression.</p>

  <p>And excited? &mdash; I think so.</p>

  <p>You saw her turn round? &mdash; Yes, she turned round and stood.</p>

  <p>Was the man in your view until he disappeared down the stair? &mdash;
Yes, till he got past me.</p>

  <p>Did you turn round a little, too? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is the prisoner the man you saw in New York and the Central Police
Station? &mdash; I would not like to swear to it. I am a little near-
sighted.</p>

  <p>Go near to him and say whether he is the man you saw in New York and the
Central Police Office? &mdash; Yes, that is the man.</p>

  <p>He is the man that you think resembled the man that you saw? &mdash; Yes,
closely.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; What kind of light was there in the lobby? &mdash;
It was well lit. There was an ordinary lamp with, I think, a blue glass, but I
could not be positive. It is a nice hall lamp. The house is well furnished.</p>

  <p>It was fully lit? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was there any light from the rooms, the doors of which were open, as well
as from the lobby lamp? &mdash; The only light I could see was from the dining-
room.</p>

  <p>Did it throw any light into the lobby? &mdash; The lobby light there was
the light above.</p>

  <p>When you saw the man was his head up or down; was there anything
noticeable about that? &mdash; It might be slightly down, but very little.</p>

  <p>It did not attract your attention? &mdash; No, I was thoroughly off my
guard.</p>

  <p>Was he dark or fair? &mdash; Dark.</p>

  <p>He had a hat on? &mdash; I am not certain of that.</p>

  <p>Had he a covering on his head or not? &mdash; I am not certain.</p>

  <p>Had he his coat collar turned up or down? &mdash; Just ordinary, I think,
so far as I could tell. His dress put me thoroughly off &mdash; I thought he
was a visitor.</p>

  <p>Till he came up to you. you did not pay the special attention that you
would have done if you had thought there was anything suspicious? &mdash; That
is so.</p>

  <p>Then when he passed you and ran, you looked at him also? &mdash; Yes. By
that time you could only see his back? &mdash; Yes, that is all I saw. Is it
your evidence that what Helen Lambie saw would be a side view, whereas you had
a front view of the man? &mdash; I had a front view, and she got a good side
view.</p>

  <p>But you had a front view only at the time when your attention was not
drawn specially to him from any idea of wrongdoing? &mdash; Yes.</p><br>

  <p>LAURA EMMA ADAMS, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I live with my
brother, the last witness, at 51 West Princes Street. Our dining-room is
immediately below Miss Gilchrist's. I knew Miss Gilchrist as a neighbour.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; I had never been in Miss Gilchrist's house.</p>

  <p>Examination continued &mdash; I came into our own house about ten minutes
to seven on the evening of 21st December last. I went to my own room and then
into the dining-room, which was immediately below Miss Gilchrist's dining-room.
I was reading the paper in the dining-room about seven o'clock. I heard a noise
from above, then a very heavy fall, and then three sharp knocks. I looked up
and said to my brother, "Miss Gilchrist evidently wants something." I connected
the three sharp knocks with Miss Gilchrist's house because at one time we said
that if she wanted anything she was to knock, and some of us would go up. My
brother instantly went upstairs. He came back in two or three minutes and told
me he had rung the bell two or three times, but he thought there was nothing
wrong, because the house was lit up, and he heard the girl cracking sticks. I
said to him, "That is not cracking sticks," and he said, "If it will please
you, I will go up again." When my brother was upstairs I heard something going
on, but not so distinct as the knocks. I could not say what the noise I heard
resembled. It was very unusual. I advised my brother to go up again, and he
went instantly.</p>

  <p>Two or three minutes after he went up again what did you hear? &mdash; I
heard nothing until I heard a rush down the stair. When I heard the rush I said
to my sister, "Something is wrong," and we went to look out. One of us went to
the window and the other flew to the door. I looked out of the window and I saw
the maid wringing her hands. I could then see something was wrong, and I went
to the door. I went upstairs immediately afterwards. There was not a soul in
the house when I went up. I had to get the key from the maid and open the
door.</p>

  <p>Was the sound that of some one rushing down the stairs? &mdash; We could
hear the feet. It must have been my brother and the maid, and probably some one
else. It was a rush of feet down the stairs.</p><br>

  <p>Mrs. ROWENA ADAMS or LIDDELL, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am
a sister of the last witness, and I reside at 63 Elmbank Street, Glasgow. On
Monday, 21st December last, I went along with my mother to her house at 14
Queen's Terrace. I reached the house from the St. George's Road direction about
five minutes to seven. My mother is an old lady. Before I reached the door of
the house I saw a dark form leaning against the railing, just under my mother's
dining-room window. I only saw a dark form, but, as I approached, I looked at
the face of the man who was standing there. I gave a good stare &mdash; almost
a rude stare&mdash; and I took in the face entirely, except that I did not see
his eyes. He had a long nose, with a most peculiar dip from here (pointing to
the bridge of the nose). You would not see that dip amongst thousands. He had a
very clear complexion; not sallow nor a white pallor, but something of an ivory
colour. He was very dark, clean shaven, and very broad in this part of the head
(points to the cheek bone or temple). He had a low-down collar. His cap was an
ordinary cap, I think, of a brownish tweed. He was very respectable. The man
was just under the eastmost window, the window furthest away from the close,
facing towards St. George's Road. He was on the same side of the street. He was
leaning with his arm on the railing, nearer St. George's Road than the close
entrance. After I passed him I looked over my shoulder, and he glided from the
railing and disappeared, and I thought no more about him. West Princes Street
is becoming a thoroughfare now a good deal.</p>

  <p>But it is a quiet street as compared with Great Western Road, for
example? &mdash; Yes, it is not a main thoroughfare. I did not look where the
man went. The whole thing passed in a few seconds.</p>

  <p>Would you recognise the man again? &mdash; I believe I have recognised
him, I believe so, but, of course, I might be liable to error.</p>

  <p>Look at the prisoner? &mdash; I cannot recognise him on this side. It was
the other side I saw. (The accused turned round with his left side to the
witness.) I do believe &mdash; I am afraid he was there &mdash; he was there at
any rate; I believe he was the man that was standing at the railings.</p>

  <p>Do you say that just from what you recollect of the appearance of the
man's face? &mdash; Yes. It was hardly a passing glance; it was a stare. I
heard the noise when I was in the house, all but the fall of the body. I joined
in sending my brother up.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Have you forgotten to mention to us
that the man was wearing a coat? &mdash; He had on a big coat.</p>

  <p>A tweed coat? &mdash; I believe it to be a browNish tweed.</p>

  <p>A heavy coat? &mdash; I believe so.</p>

  <p>Not a waterproof? &mdash; I cannot say whether the material was
waterproof or not, but it was not what you would call a gentleman's
waterproof.</p>

  <p>Not like the waterproof that has been produced? &mdash; Let me see the
collar.</p>

  <p>Have you not seen this before? &mdash; No; they have not bothered me
before but once. Show me the hem.</p>

  <p>Did you see the hem that night? &mdash; Yes. I am going by the hem
considerably, because it was not a thin paper-like edge. It was a hemmed edge,
whatever the coat was.</p>

  <p>Do you mean a heavy seam inside the edge of it? &mdash; It was not like a
thin waterproof.</p>

  <p>It was not like the waterproof which has been produced? &mdash; It was
not that material. It was a thick coat. I have stuck to that all along, and I
will stick to it still.</p>

  <p>You also said it was not a fawn coat? &mdash; Well, first of all, I said
browny fawn, but Mr. Hart seemed to have a good deal of difficulty about browny
fawn, and so I was quite agreeable that it should pass as a coat the
predominant colour of which was brown.</p>

  <p>You were ready to slightly change the colour to please Mr. Hart? &mdash;
No. I have said all along that it was brown or fawn. Of course, there are so
many shades, you see. 86</p>

  <p>Evidence for Prosecution.</p>

  <p>R. Liddell</p>

  <p>I understand. It was a brown coat and a heavy coat. When did you first
make a statement about this man? &mdash; On the Wednesday following the
murder.</p>

  <p>You had not thought of this man for two days? &mdash; He never came back
to me for two days. The murder was so unusual and exciting that everything else
was out of our heads.</p>

  <p>Your brother was the first man on the spot? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you not mention this man to him? &mdash; I mentioned it on the
Wednesday, and they laughed at the matter.</p>

  <p>Why? &mdash; They said, "What was the man doing at the railing? What had
he to do with the murder?" That was very reasonable.</p>

  <p>May I take it your family treated your alleged man at the railing as
rather a jest? &mdash; They did, and they said, "There are quite enough mixed
up in this miserable affair," and why should I have anything to do with it.</p>

  <p>When you were taken to identify this man at the police office, did you
not say that he resembled the man slightly? &mdash; I said in front of the
prisoner, when Mr. Douglas asked me, "Yes, slightly." He was in his blue coat
then.</p>

  <p>Is that still your view? &mdash; I saw him again in another coat. I went
back to look at him, and then I got the thicker coat as I had seen it. He was
not standing upright; he was bending, and had the appearance of a delicate man
even at that time. He was drawn together.</p>

  <p>Was your first impression of him that he was a delicate man? &mdash; he
had not the robustness of youth to look at.</p>

  <p>The man you saw against the railings you thought was delicate? &mdash; He
was not standing as a robust young man would. He was rather drawn together.</p>

  <p>Were you rather surprised when you saw a man of Slater's build down at
the police office? &mdash; Very much.</p>

  <p>It was not like the man you had seen? &mdash; The face was there, but in
that coat he was totally different from what he was in the first coat.</p>

  <p>You would never have recognised him in the first coat? &mdash; No; but a
tailor, you know</p>

  <p>You had never seen him really till this day in the coat which you thought
he was wearing that night? &mdash; I had never seen him since I looked at him
that night.</p>

  <p>On what date was it that you went to the police office for the purpose of
identifying him? &mdash; I cannot remember, but I could easily find out. I went
down with the crowd.</p>

  <p>Did you see any other man like him? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>He was the only man who was the least like the person you recollected?
&mdash; Yes; I scanned him closely as a matter of form. P would rather not even
say that he resembles the man, but, still, I am on oath, and, being called as a
witness, I must say</p>

  <p>You must say as near the truth as you can speak? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Then, do you go back from your original statement that he was slightly
like? &mdash; No. I told Mr. Douglas that he strongly resembled him. and I
said, "May I look at him again?" because if I could have only said that he was
not a bit like I should have been pleased, but when I saw him</p>

  <p>87</p>

  <p>Oscar Slater.</p>

  <p>R. Liddell again he came back so strongly on me. Then he had a cap on; it
was pretty well down, and I got the face much better.</p>

  <p>The delicacy you spoke of was totally absent? &mdash; No. He did not look
the same figure in this waterproof &mdash; he did not look so nice as in the
blue coat. He was a fine figure in the blue coat.</p>

  <p>When did you see him in the blue coat? &mdash; In the row of people to be
identified.</p>

  <p>The waterproof did not show him so well off? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Neither the waterproof nor the blue coat is the coat that you saw him in
that night? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Do I understand you to say that
it was by his face you judged? &mdash; Yes. I was shown his photograph in the
paper, and I could not tell that I identified him. When I went down to see him
I thought that he was not certainly the man I had seen, and therefore going
down I said to myself &mdash; of course I had heard, I confess, about the
beautiful blue coat &mdash; I said to myself I shall only make for the features
that are strong in my memory, and if they satisfied me then I could identify
him again. The figure and the clothes came as secondary to me. I do not know
whether I was right or not.</p>

  <p>When you say the features had strongly impressed themselves on you, do
you mean the side face that you saw? &mdash; Yes. I could not recognise any
other.</p>

  <p>You did not see the full face? &mdash; No, nor the other side. They are
both quite different.</p>

  <p>May I take it that your identification is entirely from your view of the
side face that you stared at? &mdash; Yes. First I thought he was a loiterer,
and I have a special animus against loiterers, and I was beginning to get
bristly. Then I wondered and thought that perhaps he might be waiting for the
maid upstairs. Then I thought he might be waiting for one of my sister's
pupils, and therefore I stared at him.</p>

  <p>And only at that one feature, the side face? &mdash; Yes. He was clean
shaven.</p>

  <p>Mrs. BARBARA MACDONALD or BARROWMAN, examined by the Lord Advocate
&mdash; I am the wife of Robert Barrowman, a moulder, and I live at 9 Seamore
Street, Glasgow. The witness Mary Barrowman is an adopted daughter of mine. She
has lived with me and my husband since she was nine days old, when her mother
died. She has always considered me and my husband to be her mother and father.
She was born on 16th January, 1894. No. 55 of the productions is her birth
certificate. She has been known as Mary Barrowman all along. She was employed
in December last with Mr. M'Callum, bootmaker, in Great Western Road, and her
hours were from nine o'clock in the morning till eight at night. I remember on
Monday, 21st December, Mary coming home late at night. She said that an old
Indy had been murdered in West Princes Street, and she went down from her Band
of Hope with some of the children to see where it was, as she had seen a
gentleman coming out of the close, and she wondered what he was doing. She said
that she did not know that the murder had happened then, but she said it was
out of that very same close that the man came. She said she was sure she would
know his face if she saw him again. I took no notice, because I thought it was
just a story, and I said, "Now, Mary, hold your tongue, because you do not know
anything about it." There was no more said that night. She said she was sure
she would know the man if she saw him again. In the afternoon of Wednesday,
23rd December, when I was going upstairs to my house, I met Detective
M'Gimpsey, who lives in the flat immediately below us. I asked him if he had
not got word of that man yet, meaning the murderer of Miss Gilchrist, and he
said that he had nothing to do with it, that he was in the Northern Department,
and that it was the Western Department that had to do with it, and they had got
no word of it. I said to him, "Then, if it will do any good our Mary saw a man
coming running out, and she would know him if she saw him. She says he has a
turned nose, and he came out just at that time." Mr. M'Gimpsey said, "Well, I
will tell that, and you may expect the detectives up." I said, "I don't want
anything to do with it, because I do not know anything more about it."
Following on this conversation a detective came up about an hour afterwards,
but Mary was not in. He said he would call back again. Then two came up after
that. Mary had gone to a Rechabite meeting, and they said that they would wait
for her, which they did, and then she gave her statement to them. That was on
the night of 23rd December.</p>

  <p>MARY BARROWMAN, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am now fifteen
years of age. I am employed with a Mr. Malcolm M'Callum, bootmaker, Great
Western Road, Glasgow, and I live at No. 9 Seamore Street, Glasgow. I remember
that on the night of 21st December last I left my employer's shop in the Great
Western Road with a parcel to be delivered at Cleveland Street, off St. Vincent
Street. I left my employer's place about seven o'clock, and I went from Great
Western Road up Barrington Drive into West Princes Street, and I walked along
West Princes Street in the direction of St. George's Road. I walked eastwards
on the south side of West Princes Street. West Princes Street is a quiet
street. When I came opposite the close a man came running out of it and knocked
up against me. He wore a fawn overcoat, a dark suit of clothes, and a Donegal
hat; he had dark brown boots. He ran towards West Cumberland Street, and I
could see he turned down there. I was just at the lamp-post near the close when
this happened. I saw him coming out of the close. I saw him coming down the
steps. He was coming very fast. When he came down to the foot of the steps he
turned towards me. He was running. I did not see anything in his hands. I was
at the lamp-post when he ran up against me. I was walking towards St. George's
Road. It was quite bright near the lamp-post where I was when the man knocked
up against me. I had a look at him coming towards me when he got out of the
closemouth.</p>

  <p>Did you see whether the man saw you? &mdash; He knocked up against me. He
did not say anything, but just ran on. When he passed me I turned to look after
him. I walked after him a bit, but I did not keep up with him. I kept looking
in the direction in which he was going. I did not walk fast; he was getting
away from me all the time. When ho turned round into West Cumberland Street I
stopped and went back in the direction from which he had come. I got a good
look at him both when he was coming up to me and when he knocked against me. He
was tall and broad-shouldered, and he had a slight twist in his nose. He was
clean shaved, and had dark hair. He had a Donegal hat on, and was wearing it
down on his face. I got a look at his face. I would know him again if I saw
him. When I went back to the closemouth I did not see anybody there, and I went
on with my message. When I went home that night I told my mother what I had
seen. I told her that I thought there had been an old lady murdered there. I
had gone with my message and then back to my employer's shop, and then to a
Band of Hope meeting, where I heard about the murder, and then I went back to
West Princes Street. I went there because of hearing about the murder. I saw a
number of people there. I told my mother that I thought I would know the man if
I saw him again. Two nights afterwards, on 23rd December, two detectives came
to our house to see me. I told them what I had seen, and I described the man to
them just as I have described him to-day. On 12th January I started for America
with the girl Lambie, and Mr. Adams, Mr. Warnock, and Detective Pyper. The day
I arrived at New York Mr. Pyper took me and the girl Lambie to the Law Courts,
where we were to be examined. I remember standing in a corridor or passage
along with Mr. Pyper and Helen Lambie, before going into the room. There were
three men coming along the corridor, and in between the two men I saw this man,
the man I had seen on the night of the murder. I told Mr. Pyper that this was
him coming. I had no difficulty in telling that he was the man. Mr. Pyper had
not asked me any questions about him in the corridor. Nobody had told me when I
was in the corridor that I would see the man pass. I just picked him out that
way without anybody speaking to me. I remember Helen Lambie doing the same. I
saw him going into the Court-room. Afterwards I went into the Court-room along
with Mr. Pyper and Helen Lambie. There were a great number of men in the Court-
room when I went in. They were nearly all standing when I went in. I was
examined there to see if I could recognise the man. I was seated when I was
being examined. There were a number of other men seated in the room at the time
I was seated. I was asked to point out the man, and I did so. He was sitting
about 10 feet away from me. Mr. Goodhart was standing in front of him when I
was asked to point him out.</p>

  <p>How did you see him and point him out? &mdash; I looked round the Court,
and I could not see him, and then I saw a man at the back of Mr. Goodhart, and
I looked at that man, and it was him, and I pointed him out. I had no
difficulty in pointing him out.</p>

  <p>Did you think anybody else in the room was the man except this man?
&mdash; No.</p>

  <p>How did you recognise him; was he dressed the same or not? &mdash; No, he
was not dressed the same. I recognised him by the face. When I saw him in New
York he had a black coat on, with a navy blue collar and a hat. The hat was one
of those hard hats, a bowler hat. That was the only dress I saw him in at New
York. I came home after I was examined in New York. After I came home I
remember going down to the Central Police Office. That was shortly after I came
home. When I went down to the Central Police Office I went into a room where
there were a number of men. There were ten or a dozen men in the room. I was
asked to point out the man I had seen in New York. I pointed him out. It was
the same man. That was the man I had seen the night that I was going my
message. I had no difficulty in recognising him. I did not think that any of
the other men who were there was the man. When I first went into the -room at
the Central Police Office he was dressed in the same clothes as he had on at
New York. A little while afterwards I remembered that he had other clothes on.
He had on a fawn overcoat and a Donegal hat. (Shown production No. 43.) That is
the coat that I saw. That is like the coat he had on that night when he knocked
against me. (Shown production No. 44.)</p>

  <p>Is that the hat? &mdash; He had it bashed down in the crown.</p>

  <p>Is that the hat? &mdash; Yes, it is very like it. That is very like the
hat he was wearing the night he knocked against me. I remember asking if he
would pull the hat down a little more. I asked that because it was not far
enough down, the way I saw him that night. When he pulled it down I then
recognised it as I had seen it that night. I said so to the police. It was
pulled pretty well down that night. I had no difficulty about recognising
him.</p>

  <p>Look at the prisoner; is that the man? &mdash; Yes, that is the man who
knocked against me that night.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Did it strike you when he came out
of the close as if he was running away from something? &mdash; No, I thought he
was running for a car, or that something had happened.</p>

  <p>He was running fast? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>As hard as he could go? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he come running down the steps fast? &mdash; Yes, he took about two
at a time.</p>

  <p>He came down two at a time, and then did he bolt along as fast as he
could in the direction of West Cumberland Street? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Then when he passed you he was running at his top speed? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And with his hat over his eyes? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Tell me how far it was pulled down? &mdash; A good bit down his brow.</p>

  <p>Was it further down the face than it is generally worn by a man? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Was it down as far as his eyes? &mdash; Yes, just about as far as his
eyes.</p>

  <p>And with the brim hanging over? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me what kind of hat it was; wasn't it a cloth cap? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Could you tell me whether it was a light cloth or not? &mdash; Dark.</p>

  <p>And was it a round hat with a brim all round it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you see that quite distinctly? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You said the man was clean shaven? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you have a good look at him as he was passing under the lamp? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Are you quite distinct about that? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You have no doubt about that whatever? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>No hair on his face? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Had you time to see whether his coat was a waterproof or a cloth coat?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was it a cloth coat? &mdash; No, it was a waterproof.</p>

  <p>Tell me how you could distinguish that? &mdash; Because I saw it when he
was running out of the close.</p>

  <p>You have just told us that the man was running past you as hard as he
could go? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you say that just in the flash in which he went past you were able to
take in all these details? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Was it fully buttoned? &mdash; No, it was not
buttoned at all.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; Was he holding it up as he ran? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>How? &mdash; With his hands in his pockets like that (illustrating) and
holding it up.</p>

  <p>And running hard along? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>As I understand, you distinguished the man by the twist in his nose?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>That was really what you made him out by? &mdash; It was by the whole
face.</p>

  <p>His clothes had nothing to do with it, because in America you picked him
out at once in different clothes? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And when he came back to this country you saw him in two different sets
of clothes, and you identified him from his face at once? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When you saw him in the police office and identified him there you
noticed he had a moustache on? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Well, that was different from the man you saw coming out of the close?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And the man whom you saw in America had a moustache on? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And the man in the photographs you saw in America had a moustache on?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And all these were different from the man you saw coming out of the close
in that particular? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You have made no mistake about that at all? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Now, a hat was shown you just now, and, while you say that that hat was
like the hat, you do not profess to say more than that? &mdash; It is very like
the hat.</p>

  <p>The hat was like and the coat was like? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you and Helen Lambie occupy the same cabin when you were going across
to America? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And did you have a talk about this on the way over? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You mentioned it sometimes? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Do you mean to say that you and Helen Lambie, going across to America to
try and identify the man who had done this thing, never once spoke to one
another on the subject? &mdash; Not that I can remember.</p>

  <p>Did you ever ask Helen Lambie what she thought he was like? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Or did she ask you what you thought he was like? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Had anybody told you not to mention it, or was it just yourself? &mdash;
Just myself.</p>

  <p>Did you wonder what the man in America would be like when you went over?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did Helen Lambie wonder? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>Did Helen Lambie never say at any time to you what she thought would
bring the man back to her? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>And you never said to Helen Lambie that if the man had a twisted nose in
his face you would know him? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You never spoke about it? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was it not an interesting subject to you both? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Tell us why you never mentioned it to one another when you were occupying
the same cabin for about twelve days? &mdash; She had her own ideas and I had
my own ideas, and I did not want to tell her what I knew.</p>

  <p>How do you know she had her own idea of the man? &mdash; She saw him that
night.</p>

  <p>Did she tell you she had seen him? &mdash; She saw him coming out of the
house.</p>

  <p>Did she tell you? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Who told you that she had seen him? &mdash; I knew she saw him coming out
of the house.</p>

  <p>Who told you? &mdash; It was in the papers.</p>

  <p>Had you seen it in the papers stated anywhere how Helen Lambie would
likely identify the man? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was anything said to you at all about the man having a peculiar walk?
&mdash; In the Court-room she said something about what a funny walk he had.</p>

  <p>Did she say that at any time to you before she was in the witness chair
in, the Court-room? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you and she never speak about this at all until you were in the Court-
room? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You did not converse about it outside before going in? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You were shown a photograph at Mr. Fox's office before you went to the
Court? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How many photographs? &mdash; Three.</p>

  <p>And were any of them like the man at all? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Now, as soon as you saw the photographs, did you recognise the man?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And was Mr. Pyper, the detective, there then? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>I want you to be particular about this; he said you did not recognise any
of them; is that the fact? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You recognised the photographs at once? &mdash; One of them.</p>

  <p>Then when you went down to the Court were you looking for a man who was
like the photograph? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And when you went into the Court there was nobody there the least like
the photographs, except the man you saw and pointed out; is that so? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Helen Lambie had given evidence in the Court: before you did? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>And you were sitting there present? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you see Helen Lambie point out the man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And when it came to your turn you pointed out the same man? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>What was it that was funny about the man's nose? &mdash; It had a
peculiar twist in it.</p>

  <p>Could you see that from in front as he was coming to you? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is it twisted to one side? &mdash; To one side.</p>

  <p>Which side is it twisted to? &mdash; To the right.</p>

  <p>Are you quite sure it is to the right? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is it much twisted to the right? &mdash; Not very much.</p>

  <p>How last do you think the man was going past you that night when he ran;
was he going very quick? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were you looking more at his face or at his boots as he came along? Did
you manage to see he had brown boots on? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether they were brown boots of the yellow type or of a
darker type? &mdash; A dark type.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether they were laced boots or buttoned boots? &mdash; I
did not look.</p>

  <p>Did I understand you to say that you went after the man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You said you thought the man might perhaps be running for a car? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Why did you go after him? &mdash; I looked to see where he was going
to.</p>

  <p>Do you mean you just turned and looked over your shoulder? &mdash; No, I
turned right round.</p>

  <p>Did you go after him? &mdash; Just about the next lamp-post or so.</p>

  <p>Did you run? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You walked for about 50 yards along the street? &mdash; I do not know how
many yards it was.</p>

  <p>What were you going to see that you went after a man who was running
fast; you said you thought perhaps he was going to the car? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What did you go after a man who was going to the car for? &mdash; I
thought he was running to catch a car, or there had been something wrong as he
was running.</p>

  <p>Did you want to see him climb on to the car? &mdash; (No answer.)</p>

  <p>Did you think he was running from a place where something had happened,
or running to a place in order to get something? &mdash; To a place.</p>

  <p>When you were in America and saw the man for the first time, I think you
said first that he was something like the man you had seen? &mdash; Very like
him.</p>

  <p>But you said "something like" first, did you not? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And then you said afterwards, "I said, 'something like him' the first
time, and then 'very like him' after I said 'something like'"; is that just
your frame of mind &mdash; that is what you meant? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>I suppose you would not see his face for more than a couple of seconds
altogether? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>When he came down the steps did he just come down as you said, two at a
time, and instantly turn and run past you? &mdash; He looked towards St.
George's Road and then ran to West Cumberland Street.</p>

  <p>As fast as he could lay his feet on the ground? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were you carrying anything at the time? &mdash; I was carrying a
parcel.</p>

  <p>The first time you saw this man in America was he coming walking down the
corridor between a great big man and another man with a medal on his breast?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And as they came down they just walked him into this room? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>I suppose you saw quite well that he was in charge of these two people?
&mdash; No.</p>

  <p>What did you think he was doing between them? &mdash; (No answer.)</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Were there other people coming down the corridor at
the same time, or were these the only people? &mdash; No, there were other
people.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; What length of view had you of these
men coming walking down the corridor? &mdash; About over to that wall there
(pointing to the wall behind the jury).</p>

  <p>And there was no person between him and you at that time? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>And he was marched down between the big man and the man with the badge
on? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Where was the door into which he turned; was that close by where you
were? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And I understood you saw nothing peculiar about his walk in any way, but
just noticed his nose? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; When you saw him coming down the
corridor first was he just about as far off from you as when you saw him coming
out of the close? &mdash; Not so far.</p>

  <p>When you were first asked if you could identify him in New York did you
say he was like the man? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Have you any doubt now that that is the man? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>After you took a good look at him did you think it was very like him?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You have seen him now two or three times? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you recollect whether before you started for America you were told not
to converse with Helen Lambie about the case; just try and recollect whether
anybody told you not to speak about it on the way out? &mdash; (No answer.)</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Do you remember anything about that? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Re-examination resumed &mdash; Did you know that the man you were to see
out in America was accused of being the murderer? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he might be accused? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And did you know it was a very serious matter that you were going out
about? &mdash; Yes.</p><br>

  <p>WILLIAM WARNOCK, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am a Sheriff criminal
officer in Glasgow. I accompanied Mr. Pyper and the three witnesses to New York
in connection with the prisoner's extradition proceedings. I got possession of
Slater's luggage. It was in New York before I arrived there. There were seven
pieces of luggage sealed with the United States Customs seal, and they were
handed over to me and Mr. Pyper. I had it transferred to the "Columbia," by
which I returned to Glasgow. The baggage was delivered scaled to the Central
Police Office, and on Sunday, 21st of February, it was opened in Slater's
presence. (Shown productions Nos. 43, 47, and 44.) No. 43 is a waterproof coat,
No. 47 is a hammer, and No. 44 is a hat. These were all found in Slater's
luggage. The hammer was found in a black leather travelling case, which is
produced. The hat was in a hat box, which is here, too. The waterproof coat was
got in this same travelling case. It was part of my duty also to search Slater.
I found in his possession a pocket-book which contained a pawn-ticket, which
is production No. 52. I examined some papers also in a leather case which was
found in one of his trunks, and from it I took the production No. 58. No. 58 is
a business card with the name and designation, "Oscar Slater, dealer in
diamonds and precious stones, 33 Soho Square, Oxford Street, West." That is
printed on the card. I also obtained an account form (label No. 59), showing a
purchase transaction by the prisoner from one D. R. Jacobs, diamond merchant,
New York, of a brilliant of extra fine quality, dated 29th February, 1908. I
found also an extract entry of his marriage (label No. 60). (Shown production
No. 46.) These caps were found in the hat case. There were only two caps. There
were no other caps in his luggage. There was no other hat of the pattern of
production No. 44 in his luggage, I took certain articles to Professor
Littlejohn &mdash; these were the hammer, the waterproof coat, and the auger.
There were no dentist's instruments or materials in his luggage. There were no
brown boots found in his luggage. The waterproof coat was the only light-
coloured coat that he had. I have seen the prisoner walk. He walks with his
toes slightly pointing inwards, and when he raises his left foot his knees
point slightly outwards. His left knee projects outwards slightly when
walking.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; More than his other knee does? &mdash; Yes, I
observed it more.</p>

  <p>Examination resumed &mdash; I heard the witnesses examined before the
Commissioner in New York. I heard the girl Lambie referring to the peculiarity
in Slater's walk.</p>

  <p>Was her description of it very much what you had observed? &mdash; Well,
I did not see her description of it, but she did imitate the walk before Mr.
Miller, the counsel; I was rather to the side, and I did not see it; there were
a number of people between. All I know is that she was asked to give this
demonstration of his walk. I did not see what she did, but she was asked
several times, and did it more than once. I heard the witnesses Mary Barrowman,
Mr. Adams, and Miss Lambie being examined by the solicitors or counsel in New
York and by the Commissioner.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I am sorry to put a personal
question; is it the fact that the girl Barrowman, in describing the nose of the
man that she had seen in the street, said it was very like yours? &mdash; Yes,
she was led into saying that.</p>

  <p>Do you remember this being said; the agent asks a question of the girl,
"How was the nose bent, was it bent anything like Mr. Fox's nose towards the
end?" and the answer is "No"; then, "Was it bent down the middle like the Lord
High Marshal of Glasgow's nose?" &mdash; that is the name the American gives
you &mdash; and Barrowman said, "Yes. It was bent down the middle? &mdash; Yes.
Kind of hollowed out, so to speak? &mdash; Yes. Very much of the order of the
gentleman from Glasgow, who is the High Sheriff of the King's forces of the
city? &mdash; Yes. Who testified just now, Mr. Warnock? &mdash; Yes. Is it not
of that order, and bent that way?" and Barrowman said "Yes." You heard all that
said? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>She, in point of fact, said that the man whom she had seen had a nose,
not like Mr. Fox's in America, but like yours? &mdash; Yes, she was led into
saying that.</p>

  <p>As regards the walk of this man, would you say that was a very noticeable
feature? &mdash; Oh, yes, it is very noticeable.</p>

  <p>Mr, Pyper, who was out with you in America, says that it is not a thing
that would make any impression upon him; do you agree with that or not? &mdash;
I differ from him in this respect, I made it a point to observe his mode of
walking, and I did observe his movement.</p>

  <p>Is it a peculiarity that a person would pick up just in a casual glance?
&mdash; Well, it depends; the person who saw the movement of the feet might not
take any notice of it.</p>

  <p>Would you require to look closely at the feet before you would notice
this peculiarity 'I &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; You said at a casual glance you would not notice it?
&mdash; Well, if you were taking notice of the movement of his feet you would
notice it.</p>

  <p>But Mr. M'CLURE put it as a casual glance passing along the street?
&mdash; Well, I would not like to give an opinion on that.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; When the girl Lambie professed to
recognise the man in America she referred to his walk, but did she refer either
to his having a turned-in toe or to any movement of the knee? &mdash; She
referred to the movement of the knee &mdash; a bend of the leg.</p>

  <p>Did she not refer to a kind of shaking of the shoulders? &mdash; She
did.</p>

  <p>Well, that has not got to do with either the knee or the foot? &mdash;
No.</p><br>

  <p>ANNIE ARMOUR, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a booking clerk
with the Glasgow District Subway Company, and I am at the Kelvinbridge station.
I was there on the 21st of December last in the evening. I was standing there
giving out tickets at the turnstile. I am inside a box, and there is a small
window to which the people come to buy their tickets. It is the ordinary size
of a kitchen pane window. It is about that size. (Indicates.)</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; It is about 2 feet by 2? &mdash; I could not say.</p>

  <p>Examination continued &mdash; Just what you have shown us with your
hands? &mdash; Yes. It is clear glass. You can lift it up and give the ticket
out and take the money. The turnstile is at the side of the window. I look
right out on the turnstile. When I was there that evening, 21st December, I
remember something happening. I was leaning against the counter, and a man came
rushing in, flung down a penny, and did not wait for the ticket. He was so
excited looking, and he gave me such a fright that I shouted, "Oh!" He ran down
the stairs, and I shouted "Here," but he never paid any heed. He ran on, and
did not wait; he never looked back. I heard him clattering down; he ran right
downstairs. I noticed that he sort of stumbled and caught hold of the railing,
he was in such haste. He was of medium height, dark, clean shaven, and wore a
light overcoat, but I could not say whether it was a hat or cap that he had on,
but I know it was something dark he had on his head. I saw his face. I could
see after him from where I was; you can see right down the stairs and to the
first step of the turn. There are eight steps, so that I would see him when he
was going down these eight steps until he turned. I looked out at him and
shouted "Here," but he paid no attention.</p>

  <p>I suppose it is very unusual for a man to pass you at that breakneck
speed? &mdash; Yes, it is very seldom that one goes away without their ticket.
Trains go every four minutes on the Subway. I went down to the Central Police
Office on 21st February last. I was shown into a room where there were a number
of men &mdash; about a dozen men. There were some with hats and others with
caps. I was asked to point out the man who had run past me without his ticket
that evening. I pointed him out. I had no difficulty in pointing him out.</p>

  <p>Will you look at the prisoner; is that the man? &mdash; That is like him.
That is the man whom I saw in the Central Police Office. There was no other man
there that I thought was like him. I had no difficulty in picking him out. I
have no difficulty now in knowing that that was the man I saw in the Central
Police Office or who passed me that night.</p>

  <p>Did you take the time when the man passed? &mdash; Well, I looked at the
clock either before he passed or just at the time, and it was between the hour
of half-past seven and eight, but I could not say to the exact time. It was
some time between these two hours I have mentioned. Sometimes my inspector
comes at eight, and at other times at nine. It was before the inspector came.
(Shown production No. 43.)</p>

  <p>Is that like the coat the man wore who rushed past you that night?
&mdash; Yes, that is like it &mdash; no, I think it was a shade darker than
that. I think his coat was buttoned; the one side of the collar was turned up.
(Shown production No. 44.) I could not exactly say whether it was a hat or a
cap he had on, but it was something dark. It was by his face that I recognised
the man; I thought he was so excited looking, and he gave me such a fright when
he passed me that I had a good look at his face.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I take it that you cannot say what
boots he had on? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You cannot say what colour of trousers he had on? &mdash; I think they
were dark; they were darker than the coat was.</p>

  <p>But the coat was not a light coat like that, but a pretty dark one
&mdash; a darker coat than the one that was shown you just now? &mdash; Well,
not much darker.</p>

  <p>Was it much darker? &mdash; A shade darker.</p>

  <p>Then you mean it was not the same coat as that? &mdash; Well, it was the
same style of coat, but a shade darker.</p>

  <p>Then you mean that it was not the same coat? &mdash; Perhaps it was in
the light that I thought it was darker.</p>

  <p>Then may the colour of all his clothes have looked differently to you
from what they look now? &mdash; And it was raining that night.</p>

  <p>I want to know, are you able to identify now any of the articles here as
articles which were worn that night by the man? &mdash; Yes, that is the kind
of coat the man had on.</p>

  <p>But you cannot say it was the same? &mdash; Only a shade darker; of
course the rain could make the coat darker.</p>

  <p>You are not sure of the trousers? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>And not sure of the boots? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>And not sure of the hat? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>And it may have been a bowler hat? &mdash; No, it was not a bowler hat,
it was of cloth.</p>

  <p>You said it was a hat or cap? &mdash; Yes, but it was not a bowler hat.</p>

  <p>It was either a dark hat or a dark cap of cloth? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Can you say whether it was a black one? &mdash; I only know it was dark;
I cannot say the exact colour.</p>

  <p>Did you have to press your foot upon the turnstile to let him through?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How long did it take passing your window? &mdash; It does not take long
to pass the window.</p>

  <p>Did he fly through? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>As fast as he could? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>But you had time to observe he had no moustache of any kind? &mdash; No
moustache of any kind.</p>

  <p>Was there a train due about the time? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>Did you ever see people rush in a hurry for the trains at this place?
&mdash; Yes, but not in such a great hurry, and going in without their
tickets.</p>

  <p>I think you said they sometimes go in without their tickets, too? &mdash;
I said it was not very often; it is very seldom.</p>

  <p>But still you know they do on occasion go without their tickets? &mdash;
Well, an odd one.</p>

  <p>Could you see the man's face quite well through the window? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Had he any peculiarity about his nose? &mdash; I never noticed the man's
nose.</p>

  <p>It had not a twist? &mdash; I never noticed his nose.</p>

  <p>Which part of his face did you concentrate your attention on? &mdash; I
had a view of the side of his face.</p>

  <p>You are quite certain he had no moustache at all? &mdash; Quite
certain.</p>

  <p>Had the man you saw at the police office on 21st February a moustache?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Before you went down to the Central Police Office to identify the man, I
think you had seen his photograph and his description? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And when you went down there, there was nobody the least like him except
this person? &mdash; No, not that I saw.</p>

  <p>The other people were quite different in appearance? &mdash; Well, there
were some of a sallow complexion &mdash; dark.</p>

  <p>None the least like this man? &mdash; No; none the least like him.</p>

  <p>As regards the hour when this happened, you said you looked at the clock?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What was the hour? &mdash; Well, I cannot say the exact hour, but it was
between the hour of half-past seven and eight.</p>

  <p>If you looked at the clock you can surely tell us? &mdash; No; I cannot
remember. It might have been half-past seven or it might have been eight. It
was not exactly eight; it might have been half-past seven or twenty-five to
eight, but I am not sure of the exact time.</p>

  <p>But you looked the clock? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Can you tell us what the clock indicated? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Might it have been a quarter to eight? &mdash; It might have been.</p>

  <p>Might it have been ten minutes to eight? &mdash; No; it could not have
been any later</p>

  <p>Why? &mdash; Because I was expecting the inspector to come, and it was
not ten minutes till the time he came.</p>

  <p>And he comes at eight? &mdash; Sometimes at eight, and other times at
nine.</p>

  <p>So that it may have been ten minutes to nine? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>If you were judging the time by the fact that you were looking for the
inspector, and he comes sometimes at eight and sometimes at nine, do you know
what hour you are referring to &mdash; Yes, I know it was about half -past
seven or eight, and that is all I know; it was between these hours.</p>

  <p>May I take it that you cannot tell us to within half an hour? &mdash; It
was between half-past seven and eight.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Do you know where Miss Gilchrist's house is? &mdash;
No; I do not exactly know where the house is, but I know where the street
is.</p>

  <p>How far is it from your place? &mdash; I could not exactly say; I have
never gone that way; I have been in St. George's Road, and seen the street from
St. George's Road, that is all.</p>

  <p>You cannot tell me how long it would take one to walk? &mdash; No.</p><br>

  <p>JAMES DORNAN, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am a detective sergeant
in the Western District of the Glasgow police force. I pointed out to the
witness George Bell, photographer, the points marked Nos. 1 to 6 on the
photograph of West Princes Street. No. 1 signifies 15 Queen's Terrace; No. 2 is
the close, 46 West Princes Street; No. 3 is 58 West Princes Street; No. 4 is
the corner of Queen's Crescent and West Princes Street; No. 5 is 16 West
Princes Street; and No. 6 is a point in West Princes Street quite near St.
George's Road. I know the locality round about Miss Gilchrist's house. West
Princes Street is a very quiet street at night. There are a variety of ways by
which you can reach the Woodlands Road Subway station from West Princes Street;
a variety of routes can be taken.</p>

  <p>How long would it take you to walk between Miss Gilchrist's house and
that Subway station? &mdash; By West Cumberland Street, Grant Street, Arlington
Street, Woodlands Road, and South Woodside Road, nine and a half minutes or
thereby; going direct by West Princes Street to South Woodside Road and then to
the Subway, seven and a half minutes or thereby.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; That is walking at an ordinary pace.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I want to ask one question, because
I know Glasgow pretty well. Woodlands Road is a main car line? &mdash; There
are cars perpetually running on the Woodlands Road.</p>

  <p>Isn't it the fact that the Woodlands Road is the main artery for all
pedestrians who are walking from the Hillhead district into Glasgow and out
again? &mdash; I would not say that. For the West End of Glasgow, from
Hillhead, I would say Great Western Road was by far the most busy thoroughfare,
which is the route to the Subway.</p>

  <p>I am referring to pedestrians? &mdash; There may be some of them frequent
that road, but it is not so frequented as the Great Western Road.</p>

  <p>Isn't it the fact that Woodlands Road is very much frequented, and that a
person passing any time between seven and eight would be likely to pass dozens,
or even hundreds, of people? &mdash; No; not hundreds of people.</p>

  <p>How many would you put it at &mdash; a much frequented road? &mdash; No;
it would not be to the extent of hundreds of people.</p>

  <p>Dozens of people? &mdash; There might be a dozen of people, but it is not
a busy road at all.</p><br>

  <p>JOHN ORD, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am the superintendent
of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Glasgow police. On the evening
of the 21st December last I received a telephone message which had been
transmitted from the Western District of the city. I at once proceeded to the
Central Police Office and 'phoned to the Western for information. I then sent a
telephone message to all the detective offices that all the officers should
remain at their posts at the various offices. I then went to the scene of the
murder along with Detective Gordon. I reached Miss Gilchrist's house about half
-past eight at night. Superintendent Douglas and Detective Pyper were there at
that time, and a constable. I went into the dining-room. I was informed that
the body was lying just in the same position as they had found it. There were
spots of blood on the fire-irons and fender, and also on the coal scuttle, and
I found some on the hearth rug too. I went into the larger of the two bedrooms
and I saw there a small box lying on the floor, with a number of papers
scattered about. On the evening of 23rd December I got information by telephone
of a girl, Barrowman, being able to give information, and I instructed her
evidence to be taken. It was taken that night; it was the next morning before I
got the evidence in full, on the 24:th. On the 25th I issued to the Glasgow
newspapers a notice containing a description of the man as given by the girl
Barrowman. I did that after approaching the chief constable and asking whether
it would be judicious. Accordingly, a notice appeared giving the description of
the man in the <i>Evening Times</i>, the <i>Evening News</i>, and the
<i>Evening Citizen</i>. It would be published about two o'clock on the 25th.
About 6.10 on the same evening, on the 25th of December, the witness Allan
M'Lean called at the Central Police Office. He gave me information where a man
of that description was to be found. He said that, in consequence of the
description having appeared in the papers, he had called to give me information
about the man. I found he was known at a club which is known as the Sloper
Club, and that his name was Oscar Slater. On the night of the murder we knew
that a valuable diamond brooch was amissing from the house. I heard that the
man Slater had been trying to dispose of a pawn ticket for a brooch in the
club. I subsequently discovered that that was not the brooch. In consequence of
the information received from M'Lean I sent Detective Powell along with M'Lean
to the place where Slater was said to live. M'Lean said he could not give the
address, but he thought he could point out those close. It was reported to me
that night that he was believed to be living at 69 St. George's Road under the
name of Anderson. About midnight I instructed Detectives Lyon and Millican to
go with Detective Powell to Anderson's house for the purpose of apprehending
the man. About three o'clock in the morning it was reported to me by telephone
that the man had gone. There was handed to me a piece of wrapper paper which
was said to have been found by our detectives in the house. No. 28 of the
productions is that torn paper wrapper. It is registered and addressed to Oscar
Slater, c/o A. Anderson, Esq., 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow, and the word
"Dent" is underlined. Dent is the name of a jeweller in London. I immediately
gave instructions that all south-going trains should be carefully watched. In
consequence of inquiries made at the railway stations it was reported to me
that two single tickets for London had been issued for the 9.5 train from the
Central Station. I wired to the London police. On 29th December I received
information from Liverpool that Oscar Slater and a woman had arrived there
early on the 26th. We had several telegrams with regard to men believed to be
Oscar Slater. The information we received from Liverpool was that Oscar Slater
and this woman had sailed by the "Lusitania" for New York, under the name of
Mr. and Mrs. Otto Sando. A cablegram was sent to New York. I made the
arrangements necessary for the identification of the man when he returned. I
arranged to have quite a number of people in the room where he was to be seen
by the witnesses. I did not go myself. I set apart two officers, Trench and
Cameron, to look after the identification. I arranged to have a number of
people there, some policemen in plain clothes, some railway servants, and
others. There were about twelve altogether. Some people were coming in making
inquiries, and we asked them to step into the room also.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; You were not there when the
identification was going on? &mdash; No, I did not go into the room.</p>

  <p>We have been told that there were just two railway officials, and that
the rest of the men were policemen along with Slater, is that correct? &mdash;
I am confident that there were more civilians than that. I sent several people
into the room.</p>

  <p>We have been told there was no other person put in the least like Slater?
&mdash; One of the railway servants is very like him. I refer to Inspector
Lang, of the railway.</p>

  <p>Is he here? &mdash; I do not know that he is here. He has dark hair, and
his nose is slightly of the same description.</p>

  <p>Detective Trench has given us a contrary impression? &mdash; I do not
know about that, but the others will bear me out that this railway man's nose
is slightly like that of Slater's. It is not so pronounced a Jewish one.</p>

  <p>Did you understand the twisted nose that was referred to by the girl
Barrowman to be just a Jewish nose? &mdash; No, not at first, not particularly
Jewish.</p>

  <p>You expected something different, in fact, from what Slater's nose turned
out to be? &mdash; I did not expect anything.</p>

  <p>But when you put in "twisted nose" you were not describing an ordinary
Jewish nose? &mdash; The description was "thinks slightly twisted to the
right."</p>

  <p>Quite noticeable? &mdash; Those are exactly the words. I cannot tell what
the person meant by it.</p>

  <p>Why did you say that you discovered that upon the Friday night there were
two single tickets taken for London? &mdash; That was reported to me, I said. I
had officers making inquiries at all the railway stations, and it was reported
to me that two single tickets had been taken for London.</p>

  <p>And you naturally thought that Slater and his travelling companion had
taken tickets for London, and then changed to Liverpool to put the police off
the scent? &mdash; Yes, I believed that at the time.</p>

  <p>Have you discovered since that the Caledonian Railway time books of that
night show that two single third-class tickets were taken from Glasgow to
Liverpool, and that Slater and his travelling companion travelled in a through
carriage to Liverpool? &mdash; I have not discovered anything, because I have
not seen a railway book belonging to any of the railway officials, nor have I
interviewed any of them.</p>

  <p>Look at production No. 69. You see the 9.5 train from the Central. Did
Slater travel by the 9.5 train from the Central? &mdash; I cannot tell you
definitely, because I was not there. It was reported to me that he was supposed
to be travelling.</p>

  <p>In point of fact, the reports you received were to the effect that Slater
and his travelling companion left the Central Station at 9.5 p.m.? &mdash; Yes,
it was reported that a man and woman, believed to be Slater, had left.</p>

  <p>Do you find that two single tickets for Liverpool were issued for that
train? &mdash; I see Liverpool, Birmingham, and London mentioned here.</p>

  <p>Do you see that two tickets were issued for Liverpool for the 9.5 train?
&mdash; Yes</p>

  <p>And these are the only tickets for Liverpool that night? &mdash; That is
all that is there.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether the man's luggage was labelled "Glasgow Central to
Liverpool"? &mdash; I cannot tell you anything about that.</p>

  <p>Are you satisfied now that the man did not start with the London tickets?
&mdash; No, certainly not.</p>

  <p>Have you heard of any other people who travelled that night to Liverpool?
&mdash; No, it would need a great deal more than an entry in a book to satisfy
me that Slater did not travel with London tickets.</p>

  <p>Do you not know that the railway official has to keep a record of the
tickets issued with these trains? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And there are entered two single tickets for Liverpool by the 9.5 train?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Have you by any investigation got upon the track of any persons who were
travelling to Liverpool from the Central that night? &mdash; I cannot say that
I have.</p>

  <p>And you are not satisfied that Slater went by that train to Liverpool?
&mdash; I am satisfied of that.</p>

  <p>But not with Liverpool tickets? &mdash; I cannot say that. I have other
information to the effect that he did not, but that is not evidence.</p>

  <p>Did you see the labels on his luggage? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Have you not examined that? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>"Liverpool, Lime Street," is on his luggage? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is it probable now that he travelled with London tickets? &mdash; Yes,
very.</p>

  <p>Why do you say so? &mdash; Because I know he covered up his tracks as far
as he could.</p>

  <p>Have you made any investigation to try and find out any other passenger
except Slater and the woman who went from the Central Station to Liverpool that
night? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you found no persons who travelled except these two? &mdash; That is
so. It was several days after that before we got information that he had gone
to Liverpool.</p>

  <p>Have you got any information that Slater took out two London tickets at
the station? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>From any person who still remains of that opinion? &mdash; Yes. There is
an official of the Central Station I believe who could have spoken to that if
his name had been on the Crown list.</p>

  <p>It is not on the Crown list? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>So the only person who could have proved that Slater and this woman took
tickets for London and then changed to Liverpool is not present? &mdash; So far
as I know. Of course, the whole of that is hearsay. I was not at the
station.</p>

  <p>But everything is reported to you? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>That naturally would have been a very suspicious circumstance if a person
had taken a London ticket and changed to Liverpool? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you still persist in saying that that is what Slater did? &mdash; I do
not say that I persist, because I do not know definitely.</p>

  <p>Do you not give him even the benefit of the doubt? &mdash; In this case I
do not.</p>

  <p>As regards the pawn ticket, was it reported to you by M'Lean that this
pawn ticket for a crescent brooch with diamond stones was being offered for
sale by Slater? &mdash; It was a man Cameron that had been offering it for sale
on behalf of Slater.</p>

  <p>And naturally you thought this might be a clue? &mdash; We associated it
with the case.</p>

  <p>You knew that the old lady had lost a crescent brooch? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you find out that the crescent brooch which Slater was endeavouring
to sell through Cameron was one which had been in pawn originally in the month
of November? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And that two sums of &pound;10 and &pound;20 had been advanced on it, and
then on 21st December (the day of this murder) an additional &pound;30 had been
advanced on it? &mdash; Yes, that was reported to me.</p>

  <p>Was it the coincidence in the date, 21st December, of the last advance
upon this brooch that made you think it might be Miss Gilchrist's brooch?
&mdash; Most assuredly that had some bearing on the case.</p>

  <p>Did you discover immediately that this was not the brooch at all? &mdash;
We knew that that morning.</p>

  <p>Did you make inquiry at Cook's office? &mdash; I made no personal
inquiries at all.</p>

  <p>Did you direct inquiries to be made? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you find that some days before the 25th Slater had been at Cook's
office to find out about the sailings for America? &mdash; Yes, I heard that,
too.</p>

  <p>And that he had been at the Cunard office? &mdash; I did not hear that
until about the 29th or 30th.</p>

  <p>In point of fact, have you not information which goes to show that from
the 21st Slater was going about billiard rooms and other places quite publicly
in Glasgow, from the 21st until the 25th? &mdash; No, the information is just
the other way. The information was that he had not been seen at the club that
he used to frequent regularly. He was not back at it after the night of the
murder.</p>

  <p>Did you find he was going to billiard rooms in the city? &mdash; I did
not find that.</p>

  <p>Do you know that that was found by your agents? &mdash; I do not know
that. I have not heard that part of the case. That was one of the things that
the man M'Lean put some stress upon, the fact that Slater had not been seen at
the club after the night of the murder.</p>

  <p>Has he been to Johnston's billiard room since? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>Or Gall's public-house? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>And the Cunard offices and Cook's office on two dates? &mdash; I do not
know that he was at Cook's office.</p>

  <p>And Messrs. Cook afterwards telegraphed to Liverpool to see about the
sailings of the Cunard steamers, and it was for Oscar Slater that their
inquiries were made? &mdash; I cannot personally answer that question because I
did not make inquiries, neither were they done by my department. A good many of
these inquiries were done from the Fiscal's office.</p>

  <p>But is that not your information? &mdash; I heard something about them,
but I do not know the particulars.</p>

  <p>Do you know that a telegram was sent to Dent in London for the return of
a watch by Slater, and it was sent to him in his name? &mdash; The account was
handed to me. It was found in his house. I wrote to find out what relations he
had with Dent, and I got the telegrams referred to there.</p>

  <p>Did you find it was about a watch that Slater wanted to get back because
he was going abroad? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you find also that in a letter, dated 20th December, and despatched
at five o'clock on 21st December, Slater wrote to the Post Office Savings Bank
in London before the murder asking that his deposit should be forwarded to
Glasgow as he was going abroad? &mdash; This is the first time I have heard
about that letter.</p>

  <p>I refer to Nos. 4 and 5 of the defence productions. Did you know of these
letters? &mdash; I never heard of them.</p>

  <p>You have assumed all through that this man was going abroad as the result
of a published description in the evening papers of 26th December, 1908?
&mdash; Not necessarily.</p>

  <p>But was not that the evidence you were suggesting just now? &mdash; I had
no doubt in my mind that that was partly the result &mdash; that is to say, the
hurried leaving of Glasgow at the time I supplied the first information to the
Crown &mdash; I was satisfied he was leaving hurriedly on account of his
description having appeared in the newspapers on the 25th. That was the
inference.</p>

  <p>Did you find that he informed the barber Nichols, who is on the Crown
list, in the forenoon of 25th December, that he was going to sail from
Liverpool by the "Lusitania" the next day, and was leaving that night from the
Central Station? &mdash; I never interviewed the barber. His evidence was
supplied by another officer. I heard that, but I never interviewed him. I found
from the letter from Jacobs that he was going. I inferred he had meant to go
then, because Jacobs says that he could not be out of his money for three
months. That letter was written on 28th December, 1908.</p>

  <p>Do you admit that all that information which has come to you since puts a
different complexion on the matter? &mdash; No doubt it modifies it to a
certain extent.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; You said to Mr. M'Clure that you
were informed that there was an official or servant at the Central Station who
knew about the issue of the tickets, and you added that his name was not on the
list? &mdash; That is so, because we were too late in getting him. The
explanation is that the man's name and address were obtained after the prisoner
had been served with a copy of his indictment, and he could not be added to the
list.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether the two tickets for Liverpool were issued to separate
people? &mdash; I could not answer that.</p>

  <p>Was that the reason why you said to Mr. M'Clure that the entries in a
book alone would not satisfy you? &mdash; My reason for giving the answer was
that I was satisfied that really the tickets issued to him were tickets to
London.</p>

  <p>In the course of your inquiries did you ascertain that on 9th December
Oscar Slater communicated with Dent in London regarding his watch? &mdash; I
could not repeat the date from memory.</p>

  <p>Look at the print of productions, page 18. Did you ascertain in the
course of your inquiries that on 9th December Oscar Slater, whoever he may be,
communicated with Dent regarding his watch, and bid him not return same till
the 30th of December, the address being 69 St. George's Road? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you ascertain that Oscar Slater on 21st December asked Dent, if
possible, to send the watch at once? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>He asked that by a wire? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you ascertain that two days later, viz., on 23rd December, Oscar
Slater, care of A. Anderson, telegraphed to Dent, "Must have watch. Leaving to-
morrow night for the Continent"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you ascertain when the telegram of 21st December was sent off?
&mdash; No, I do not know the hour.</p>

  <p>Did you ever hear of Slater going to the Continent? &mdash; No. I did not
hear of him having gone to the Continent.</p>

  <p>When you saw the telegram you saw that apparently it was his intention on
the 24th to go to the Continent? &mdash; That is the inference to be drawn from
it. He says that he is going to the Continent.</p>

  <p>Did you ascertain that the house he occupied at 69 St. George's Road was
taken in an assumed name? &mdash; Yes, in the name of Anderson till May,
1910.</p>

  <p>Did you ascertain also that there was no dentistry carried on there and
no dentistry implements? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Did all the advertisements or police notices in the
papers contain a description with reference to the peculiarity of the nose?
&mdash; Yes. After we got the girl's statement in any public notice that we
issued we always referred to the nose, although I may explain that we kept the
matter open and suggested that there might be two men, and we kept the first
description alongside the second one.</p>

  <p>The first description containing no reference to the nose? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did either of the descriptions contain any reference to the peculiar
walk? &mdash; I could not answer that. There is nothing apparently about the
walk in any of the intimations.</p>

  <p>You referred to Slater having had another name, the Scotch name of
Anderson. Is there anything peculiar in that in the case of foreigners,
especially Jews, working in this country? &mdash; If they cannot speak the
English language very well, and if other people cannot pronounce their names,
then they often adopt a Scotch name, but an educated man usually keeps his own
name.</p>

  <p>Have you not met many cases of men like Slater taking a Scotch name?
&mdash; No, not a man of his intelligence. In the mining class they nearly all
adopt Scotch names.</p>

  <p>Did you attach importance to the fact that he had taken another name?
&mdash; I did not attach much importance to that.</p>

  <p>But did you attach any importance? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>He took this other name before the murder? &mdash; Yes. He was known to
some persons as Anderson and to others as Slater.</p>

  <p>Did you attach any importance to it in connection with the murder?
&mdash; After we got the third name, O.Sando, then the coincidence struck me as
singular. That was three names.</p><br>

  <p>WILLIAM NEIL, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a constable in
the Western District, Glasgow. About a quarter past seven on 21st December last
I was on duty in West Princes Street. The witness Adams came to me and informed
me that Miss Gilchrist had been murdered in her house. I went straight to the
house. I had passed the house six or seven minutes before that on the north
side. When I went up to the room I found the old lady was lying murdered in her
dining-room with a mat right over her. I was the first officer there. Her body
was kept in the same position in which I found it till after the doctors came.
I found a a set of false teeth and a half-sovereign lying on the table close
beside her. I went to the police office on Monday, 22nd February, and I saw a
man there whom I recognised. I did not know his name previous to that. The
prisoner is the man whom I saw in the police office. I have seen him in St.
George's Road several times in November and December. I saw him there about the
latter end of November and twice in December.</p>

  <p>You had known him before in Glasgow? &mdash; Yes, about five or six years
ago. I had seen him then in Grant Street, which is the next street to West
Princes Street. There was a club there that he used to frequent. I saw him
occasionally then for about a minute, I would say. I did not know his name, but
I recognised him as the same man as I had known before.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; 'Was that about the time of the
Glasgow Exhibition of 1901 or later? &mdash; I think it would be about that
time.</p><br>

  <p>ANNIE GILLIES, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am twenty-three years of
age, and saleswoman with Messrs. Hepburn &amp; Marshall, hardware merchants.
Charing Cross, Glasgow. I recognise the prisoner. He first came to our premises
on 7th November, and he made a purchase. He gave us the name of Anderson, 69
St. George's Road. He came back afterwards on 10th November and bought a set of
tools. Production No. 31 is the duplicate sale note for these tools and a few
other things. (Shown labels Nos. 47 and 48, consisting of a hammer, screw
driver, pliers, &amp;c.) These are the articles that we sold on the card of
household tools. I was shown that hammer in the prisoner's presence in the
police office. I identified it as the one I had sold him.</p>

  <p>Did you notice anything about the handle at the time you saw it in the
police office? &mdash; I thought it was not the same as when I had sold it on
the card. I thought it had the appearance of having been washed. I do not think
that the lower part had been washed, but the part towards the head had been
washed. The wood there was different from the lower part. Looking at it now I
think it shows the same appearance of having been washed as I noticed in the
police office. I think it still shows that the portion of it towards the head
had been washed.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; You do not say that with any
confidence, do you? You can see that the lower part of the hammer has been
dirty, but can you say that the top has been washed? &mdash; It has not the
appearance of a new piece of wood.</p>

  <p>I quite agree. It has been in use for a good while? &mdash; Yes, six
weeks.</p>

  <p>You do not suggest seriously that your evidence is that that bit has been
washed at the top, and the lower bit has been unwashed? You are not very
confident about it, I think? &mdash; It has not the appearance of new wood.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Is it the lighter colour as compared with the darker
colour below that makes you say that? &mdash; As compared with a new one.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; Did you not sell us this card with
tools since? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>On 10th November, when you sold the card with the pincers and hammer and
other implements to A. Anderson, 69 St. George's Road, it was just a card like
that which you sold for 2s. 6d.? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Except that the hammer is dirty, do you see any difference? &mdash; Just
a slight difference in the wood.</p>

  <p>You do not profess to say whether it has been washed or what has been
done? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You see some coal dust under the head there? &mdash; It is difficult for
me to tell what is on the handle now. It is not in the same condition as it was
when I sold it.</p>

  <p>Professor JOHN GLAISTER, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am
Professor of Forensic Medicine in Glasgow University. On the instructions of
the Procurator-Fiscal, I visited and inspected on 22nd December the house at 15
Queen's Terrace occupied by the late Miss Gilchrist. In conjunction with Dr.
Galt, I prepared the report No. 2 of the productions. That report is
correct.</p>

  <p class="quote">University of Glasgow,<br>
  22nd December, 1908.</p>

  <p class="quote">At the request of James Neil Hart, Esq., Procurator-Fiscal
of the county of Lanark, we, the undersigned, on this date visited and
inspected the house at 15 Queen's Terrace, or 49 West Princes Street, in which
on the previous evening a murder was alleged to have been committed on the
person of Miss Marion Gilchrist. The police were in possession of the premises
on our arrival.</p>

  <p class="quote">The body was identified as that of Miss Marion Gilchrist in
our presence by the following persons, viz.:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">1. Nellie Lambie, domestic servant to the said Miss
Gilchrist, residing at 15 Queen's Terrace;</p>

  <p class="quote">2. Arthur M. Adams, residing at 14 Queen's Terrace; and</p>

  <p class="quote">3. William Neil, police constable, 178 B, Western Division
of Police.</p>

  <p class="quote">We first examined the apartment in which the body of the
said Miss Gilchrist had been found, viz., the dining-room. The body had been
left undisturbed in the position in which it had been found, and with the
exception of a chair and a hair rug which had been displaced from their
original position when first found, and of a coal scuttle the position of which
had been slightly altered, all the other contents of the room were in their
respective positions as when the body was first found.</p>

  <p class="quote">The dining-room is a fairly large apartment. Its windows
(two in number) look into West Princes Street. Along the east wall of the room
is the fireplace of the apartment. On a carpet rug in front of this fireplace
the body was lying. The head was pointing diagonally to the fireplace, and the
feet towards the dining-room door. The right arm was extended at right angles
from the body, and the left arm was lying alongside of and parallel to the
body. The left leg was crossed over the right below the knees.</p>

  <p class="quote">Without disturbing the body, it was observed that the head
and face had been very much smashed. There were wounds on the right cheek
extending from the mouth, wounds of the right forehead, and of the right side
of head. There was a deep hole on the left side of the face between the eye
socket and the left ear.</p>

  <p class="quote">The left eyeball was entirely amissing, having either been
driven into the cavity of the brain or having been gouged out. The right eye
was partially torn out of its socket by the deep fracture of the right side of
the brow. There was much blood on and among the hair of the head. On the carpet
rug beneath the head on both sides was a considerable amount of clotted blood,
and fluid blood had soaked into the substance of the rug. Between the head and
the fender of the fireplace a piece of brain tissue weighing about three-
quarters of an ounce, as well as smaller pieces, and several pieces of bone
covered with blood were found. Two of these pieces were retained.</p>

  <p class="quote">The fire-irons were in their places. They were bespattered
with blood, as was also the grate and the fire-bars. The legs of some of the
chairs in the neighbourhood and the coal scuttle were also bespattered with
blood. All these signs indicated that the injuries had been inflicted in the
neighbourhood of where the body was found lying, and that the injuries had been
produced by very forcible application of some instrument.</p>

  <p class="quote">There was also found between the head and the fender a
complete plate (gold) of artificial upper teeth.</p>

  <p class="quote">Both hands were remarkably pallid. There was no blood on
the right hand or fingers, but there was dried blood between the fingers of the
left hand. The skin rug already referred to was found when the body was first
discovered to be more or less covering the body. On examination of it blood was
found among the hair about the middle of the rug.</p>

  <p class="quote">The spectacles of the deceased were found on the table in
front of an open magazine. The chair, referred to as having been removed,
originally stood, when the body was found, in front of this magazine, standing
on its four legs.</p>

  <p class="quote">The body was, in accordance with our instructions, approved
by the said Mr. Hart, removed to the mortuary of the Glasgow Royal Infirmary
for further examination and dissection.</p>

  <p class="quote">We examined the room for any likely weapons. From our
examination it did not appear that any of the fire-irons had been used for the
purpose of inflicting the injuries; nor had any of the mantelpiece ornaments.
We were shown a piece of a large auger or screw-bit, which we were informed had
been found in the back green in a line with the kitchen window of the house. On
examination we found that adhering to the metal of the instrument were several
grey hairs, and, in addition, what seemed to be blood. We appended our
signatures to the label attached to the instrument.</p>

  <p>Subsequently, on 23rd December, I received a warrant from the fiscal for
the purpose of making, along with Dr. Galt, a post-mortem examination of the
body, and I did so. No. 3 of the productions is the report by me and Dr. Galt.
It is correct.</p>

  <p class="quote">University of Glasgow,<br>
  23rd December, 1908.</p>

  <p class="quote">By virtue of a warrant of the Sheriff of Lanarkshire and at
the instance of James Neil Hart, Esq., Procurator-fiscal of the said county,
we, the undersigned, on this date and within the mortuary of the Glasgow Royal
Infirmary, made a post-mortem examination of the body of Miss Marion Gilchrist,
which was removed thither for the purposes of examination from 15 Queen's
Terrace, and which was identified in our presence by the following persons,
viz.:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">1. Nellie Lambie, domestic servant to the said Miss
Gilchrist, residing at 15 Queen's Terrace;</p>

  <p class="quote">2. Arthur M. Adams, residing at 14 Queen's Terrace; and</p>

  <p class="quote">3. William Neil, police constable, 178 B, Western Division
of Police.</p><br>

  <p class="quote" style="text-align:center"><small>EXTERNAL
EXAMINATION.</small></p>

  <p class="quote">The body was that of a well-nourished elderly woman. Death-
stiffening had disappeared from the body. The skin was markedly pallid in
appearance.</p>

  <p class="quote">The following marks of violence were seen externally:
&mdash; Generally speaking, the face and head were both badly smashed. In
particular, the following injuries were found: &mdash;<br>
  <br>
  (1) Extending from the right angle of the mouth backwards on the right cheek
for 2&frac14; inches was a gaping, ragged wound, divided into two parts by a
bridge of skin 1&frac12; inches broad, the mouth cavity and the wound being one
continuous cavity. At the base of this wound several fractures of the lower
jaw, upper jaw, and cheek bones were found, the bones being driven into the
mouth.<br>
  (2) On the inner side of the right orbit was a lacerated wound, irregular in
shape, 1&frac34; inches long and &frac34; inch broad, which extended deeply
into the base of the nose. On deeper examination it was found that the bones of
the orbit, the nose, and the forehead were completely smashed in and broken
into many pieces.<br>
  (3) From the upper part of the former wound (2), a wound extends upwards on
the brow and head for a distance of 3 inches and towards the right temple for a
distance of 2 inches, in which the right frontal bone of the skull had been
smashed asunder from the rest of the bones of the skull and exposing the brain
and brain substance, from which a considerable portion of the brain matter has
escaped.<br>
  (4) The lobe of the right ear was completely torn away from the cheek
connections.<br>
  (5) In front of right ear (&frac34; inch) was a spindle-shaped wound
measuring &frac34; inch long and &frac14; inch broad, which extended deeply
into tissues down to the bone.<br>
  (6) Behind the right ear was a series of wounds &mdash; (a) at a distance of
&frac12; inch from ear was a spindle-shaped wound of like dimensions to the
last; (b) a wound of similar shape 1 inch long by &frac14; inch broad; and (c)
a like wound &frac12; inch long by <small>1&frasl;8</small> inch broad.<br>
  (7) At a distance of &frac12; inch behind the series just described was an
irregular-shaped, lacerated wound which measured 3&frac12; inches long by 1
inch at greatest breadth, and which was divided in the middle by a bridge of
tissue, at the bottom of which several fractures of the bones forming the right
temple and back of the head were found, some of the broken pieces of which were
driven in upon the brain.<br>
  (8) On the top of the head behind the line of hair at top of the right brow
was a lacerated wound 1&frac12; inches long by 1 inch broad, which led down to
a fracture of the bone beneath, which communicated with the skull cavity.<br>
  (9) Half an inch to the right side of wound last described was a lacerated
wound 2 inches long by <small>3&frasl;8</small> inch broad, at bottom of which
was a large fracture of the skull, from which brain matter was protruding.<br>
  (10) On left side of face there were the following injuries: &mdash; (a) A
lacerated, irregular-shaped wound at left side of nose and left lower eyelid,
which measured 2 inches by &frac34; inch. In this wound the entire eyeball and
parts of both eyelids were found to have been driven into the brain cavity, the
eyeball itself being burst and collapsed. Dissection of this further showed
that the floor of the left orbit had been completely broken away from
surrounding bones. It was also found that the fracture of the right frontal
bone extended across the brow into the left frontal bone; (6) on the left
cheek, 1 inch from outer angle of the left eye, and on the same level, was a
lacerated wound 2&frac34; inches long by 1&frac14; inches broad, the backmost
part of which extended into the middle and upper portions of the cartilage of
the left ear. At bottom of this wound fractures of the upper jaw and upper part
of lower jaw were found which were quite loose; (c) 1 inch above the upper
level of the last wound was a spindle-shaped wound passing down into the deeper
tissues, which measured &frac12; inch by &frac14; inch, and at the lower edge
of this another wound of like shape and dimensions, but not so deep; (d) on the
upper left temple, 2 inches back from the outer side of the left eye, was a
semicircular-shaped wound with comparatively clean-cut edges, which measured
2&frac14; inches round its outer edge. In the base of this wound was an area of
exposed skull bone measuring &frac14; inch in breadth, in which was a linear
fracture of vault of skull.</p>

  <p class="quote">The entire hair of the scalp, which was greyish at the
roots, was, with the scalp itself, saturated and covered with blood.</p>

  <p class="quote" style="text-align:center"><small>INTERNAL
EXAMINATION.</small></p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Head Cavity</i>. &mdash; The deep tissues of the scalp,
more or less over the whole head, were considerably bruised and discoloured
with effused blood, but more especially over the vertex and right side of the
head.</p>

  <p class="quote">The coverings of the brain were torn through in different
places where were the fractures. The brain itself was greatly torn and
disorganised. Several pieces were amissing, especially from the front portion
of the right side of the brain. Several pieces of bone of different sizes were
found driven into the brain substance at different points.</p>

  <p class="quote">On removal of the brain it was found that the skull was
fractured through its base, extending from the front right to the back. The
skull bones were thicker than usual in the average woman.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Chest Cavity</i>. &mdash; On dissecting this cavity it
was found that the breast bone had been fractured completely through its entire
thickness, about its middle, the area of fracture being surrounded with bruised
blood. On the right side of the chest in front, fractures of the third, fourth,
fifth, and sixth ribs were found, the third rib being broken in three different
places, the fourth and fifth in two places, and the sixth in one place only. On
the left side of front of chest the fourth rib was found to be broken close to
the junction of bone and cartilage.</p>

  <p class="quote">The right breast was slightly discoloured on the surface
from bruising. Both lungs were healthy. The heart was very healthy for an old
woman. Any slight departure from normal was due to the degenerative change from
age.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Abdominal Cavity</i>. &mdash; All the organs of this
cavity were examined separately and in detail. The stomach contained some
partially digested food. Both kidneys were granular from chronic kidney
affection. There were small tumours of the womb and appendages. The rest of the
organs were normal.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Opinion</i>. &mdash; From the foregoing examination we
are of opinion that the cause of death of the said Marion Gilchrist was
extensive wounds and fractures of bones of face and skull, already described,
and fractures of breast bone and ribs, together with shock and bleeding
therefrom, that the said injuries were produced by forcible contact with a
blunt weapon, and that the violence was applied with considerable force. These
are testified on soul and conscience.</p>

  <p class="quote">JOHN GLAISTER, M.D., &amp;c.<br>
  HUGH GALT, B.Sc, M.D., &amp;c.</p>

  <p>I did not find in the dining-room any implement which looked as if it had
been used for the purpose of murdering Miss Gilchrist. The fire-irons were
undisturbed in their places, and all the ornaments were undisturbed. I saw
marks of blood on the fire-irons. The fire-irons, the tongs, the poker, and the
fender, the fire-bars and sides of the grate and the coal scuttle all bore
marks of blood, as well as the legs of an easy-chair and a portion of the
tablecloth which stood opposite the fireplace. That was not owing to any
contact with the blood; they were bespattered with blood. I was clear that the
injuries had been produced practically at the point where the body was found. I
inferred that from the spattering of blood in the neighbourhood, and also from
the fact that round the head there was a considerable quantity of blood. From
my experience, my view is that the assailant knelt on the woman's chest, and,
kneeling upon the chest, he struck violently at the head with the implement
that he employed. The weight of his body, plus the force exercised in violently
attacking the head, accounted for the rib fractures and other fractures of the
chest bone. The bones in a person over eighty years of age are much more
brittle than in younger persons. I formed an opinion as to the character of the
weapon with which the injuries to the face and head had been inflicted. From
the nature of the wounds I arrived at the conclusion that the weapon was not
uniformly the same at the striking part, for this reason: we found several
wounds of different sizes and of different shapes; and also for the reason that
we found the left eyeball, in a burst condition, driven into the brain. That
indicated that the weapon must have been of a pointed character to have enabled
the eyeball to have been driven into the brain, because a large weapon that
would have been likely to have caused the larger wounds could not have entered
the orbit, because the orbit is bounded by bone. The spindle-shaped wounds were
either produced by a relatively sharp surface of a blunt instrument, such as
the head of a hammer, or the claw end of a hammer, or any such similar
instrument. (Shown hammer, label No. 47.) I have examined this hammer before
for another purpose. This hammer could, in my opinion, in the hands of a strong
man and forcibly wielded, have produced the injuries found on that body.</p>

  <p>Plus the kneeling on the chest? &mdash; Yes. Of course, the purchase
which the assailant could have when kneeling on the victim's chest would be all
the greater than if he was standing on his feet and using the same violence to
a body prostrate on the ground.</p>

  <p>If the assailant had five or six minutes at his disposal, and used the
time well, could he with that hammer have inflicted the wounds you saw on the
old lady's head and face? &mdash; Yes, I have very little doubt from experience
of similar injuries and relatively similar weapons that these injuries could
have been produced in that way. I carefully examined the claws of the hammer; I
made measurements of the hammer. The total length of the metal head is
3&frac12; inches, the breadth of each individual claw is &frac14; of an inch,
and the gap between measures 5-16ths of an inch, so practically the whole
distance from the point of one claw to the point of the other claw is about
&frac34; of an inch, corresponding very closely to certain of the spindle-
shaped wounds found in the skull. The diameter of the head is &frac34; of an
inch one way and <small>5&frasl;8</small> of an inch the other way, also
closely corresponding with certain of those spindle-shaped wounds I have
mentioned in my report. That is to say, the length of the hammer from my finger
there (pointing) is &frac34; of an inch, and the cutting margin would be
&frac34; of an inch.</p>

  <p>That instrument, used in the different ways you have described by a
strong man, could have inflicted all the wounds you have found? &mdash; I can
only say that this instrument accounts most easily for the different classes of
wounds, and particularly the eye mischief. I cannot see any other instrument
that could do it unless an instrument of the same type, the head of a crowbar
of varying sizes.</p>

  <p>Is it the case that, in the case of a very old lady like this, the bones
being brittle, the injuries could be more easily inflicted than on a young
person? &mdash; Once a fracture of the skull was produced, then it would be
much easier later to extend the fractures by repeated blows.</p>

  <p>I was asked, along with Professor Harvey Little John, to examine certain
articles that were submitted to us, and to make a chemical examination of
certain stains found upon them. We made chemical and microscopical and other
examinations of certain stains. On 11th March Professor Harvey Littlejohn and I
issued a report upon the examination we had made on the articles handed to us.
No. 4 of the productions is our report, and it is correct.</p>

  <p class="quote">University of Edinburgh,<br>
  11th March, 1909.</p>

  <p class="quote">We hereby certify on soul and conscience that on the 24th
day of February and following days we examined certain articles which were
handed to one of us, Harvey Littlejohn, on 23rd February, within the Forensic
Medicine Laboratory of this University, by William Warnock, Sheriff criminal
officer, Glasgow.</p>

  <p class="quote">I. A coat labelled "Waterproof coat. Police Office, Central
Division, Glasgow, 21st February, 1909. Found in trunk belonging to Oscar
Slater, and referred to in the case of himself by John Pyper, William Warnock,
Harvey Littlejohn, A. Cameron."</p>

  <p class="quote">II. A hat labelled similarly.</p>

  <p class="quote">III. A claw-hammer labelled "Claw-hammer. Police Office,
Central District, Glasgow, 21st February, 1909. Found in trunk belonging to
Oscar Slater, and referred to in the case of himself by John Pyper, William
Warnock, Annie Gillies, Harvey Littlejohn, A. Cameron."</p>

  <p class="quote">IV. An auger labelled "Police Office, B District, Glasgow,
22nd December, 1909. Found in back court at 15 Queen's Terrace, and referred to
in the case of Marion Gilchrist (murdered), by Alexander Rankin, William
Warnock, Harvey Littlejohn, John Glaister, Hugh Galt."</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Coat</i>. &mdash; This article appeared to be a new
waterproof coat.</p>

  <p class="quote">On inspection small stains were visible on different parts
of the garment, externally and internally. These numbered twenty-five in all.
They varied in size from <small>5&frasl;8</small> inch long by &frac14; inch
broad down to pinhead size, and varied also in shape, many of them having the
appearance of spatters.</p>

  <p class="quote">To the naked eye most of them presented a brownish-red
colour, the remainder being blackish in colour. The latter on examination with
a hand lens proved to be frayed rubber.</p>

  <p class="quote">After treatment of the brownish-red stains, and on
microscopic examination, corpuscular bodies resembling in general appearances
mammalian red blood corpuscles were found in certain of the stains.</p>

  <p class="quote">We are unable, however, to affirm positively that these
were red blood corpuscles, because by reason of the small amount of material at
disposal confirmatory tests for blood could not be employed.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Hat</i>. &mdash; No stains were found upon this
article.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Hammer</i>. &mdash; From the head of this instrument to
about half-way down the shaft the shaft had the appearance of having been
scrubbed, the surface of the wood being roughened and bleached.</p>

  <p class="quote">Yellowish stains were found on both sides of the head of
the hammer and on both flanges.</p>

  <p class="quote">Portions of these stains, as well as some adherent matter
found between the claws, were scraped off and examined microscopically.</p>

  <p class="quote">In addition to particles of rust and of a tissue which in
our opinion was vegetable in character, corpuscular bodies were found. These
resembled red blood corpuscles of the mammalian type.</p>

  <p class="quote">For the reason already adduced, however, we are unable to
state positively that these were red blood corpuscles.</p>

  <p class="quote"><i>Auger</i>. &mdash; This instrument, which measured 13
inches in length, was thickly coated with rust. To it there was attached by
means of string a small quantity of loose human hairs.</p>

  <p class="quote">Examination of scrapings of material from various portions
of the instrument gave no indications of the presence of blood.</p>

  <p class="quote">The hairs above mentioned were found to be greyish in
colour, to measure in length from 18 inches downwards, and to have well-defined
diameters. Some of these hairs possessed roots which on microscopic examination
proved to be healthy roots.</p>

  <p class="quote">These hairs were compared with a quantity of hair cut by
one of us &mdash; John Glaister &mdash; from the head of the deceased Marion
Gilchrist at the post-mortem examination of the body, and which bore the
following label: &mdash;<br>
  "Hair of scalp of the late Miss Marion Gilchrist, 15 Queen's Terrace, West
Princes Street, which was removed at post-mortem examination by Professors
Glaister and Galt, on 23rd December, 1908. John Glaister, Hugh Galt."</p>

  <p class="quote">These hairs when compared with, hairs attached to auger
were found to correspond generally in length, colour, and diameter.</p>

  <p class="quote">HARVEY LITTLEJOHN, M.B.<br>
  JOHN GLAISTER, M.D., &amp;c.</p>

  <p>The hammer referred to in our report is the one which I have beside me
now (label No. 47.) I see upon it now what we described in our report, the
shaft having the appearance of having been scrubbed. Between the flanges by
which the head is joined to the wooden shaft, and particularly at the sides and
half-way down, the shaft looks as if it had been washed, scrubbed, or sand-
papered. The iron has the same appearance, but that I have seen also in a
comparatively cheap hammer where the polishing has not been very carefully
done. I do not attach importance to the auger. The auger, when I first saw it,
was wet. It was an old auger covered with rust. In my first report I said that
the auger seemed to have what might be blood, but it proved on examination not
to be blood. If there had been blood stains upon the coat, they could have been
much more readily detected by analysis if the coat had been obtained by me
sooner. To my mind, these stains had been subjected to the influence of water.
When a waterproof coat gets wet with rain, the water keeps on the surface of
the cloth. I do not know whether it was rain that got on the stains or whether
they had been subjected to washing, but they were not stains as I should have
expected them to be after immediate effusion on the cloth. They were paler in
colour. We could not tell from the appearance of the cloth whether the coat had
been actually scrubbed or whether there had simply been rain upon it.</p>

  <p>I suppose there was no doubt that the injuries could have been inflicted
by only one instrument that you saw, viz., the hammer? &mdash; That is the most
likely of all the instruments I saw in the place or have seen since to have
produced the injuries. I was quite satisfied, after my examination, that none
of the fire-irons had been used.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I understand that you cannot say
even that the hammer was used? &mdash; I cannot say positively that the hammer
was used.</p>

  <p>There is no trace of blood on it whatever? &mdash; We found certain
corpuscular bodies that looked like blood corpuscles, but I am not able to say
positively that they were blood.</p>

  <p>You cannot say that there was any blood on the hammer? &mdash; I cannot
say it positively.</p>

  <p>You cannot say positively that the hammer was washed? &mdash; No, I said
it bore the appearance of having been probably washed and scrubbed or sand-
papered, but I cannot say positively.</p>

  <p>Do you observe that it has coal dust at the top where the handle meets
the head? &mdash; I am not so clear as you are about that. I think it is
ordinary dirt, a miscellaneous collection of material which accumulates on any
instrument that is exposed to the air in a dirty room.</p>

  <p>If any washing of the hammer had taken place that dirt would have been
washed up into the head? &mdash; It depends how it was washed. If it was washed
by a scrubbing brush that is where they would try to get the dirt out.</p>

  <p>We are now in the region of hypothesis? &mdash; Speculation.</p>

  <p>So much for the hammer. I understand that you cannot say that there is
any blood on the coat? &mdash; For the reasons I have given you, that the
corpuscular bodies, which I personally believe to be blood corpuscles, I cannot
in a case like this be positive about, because I cannot get the necessary
corroboration from what was at my disposal.</p>

  <p>And yet you would say it is blood? &mdash; Not in the absence of
corroborative tests in a case of this kind.</p>

  <p>Do you say that the coat bears any trace whatever of having been washed?
&mdash; I said an application of water. I cannot say here that the appearance
of the stains was due to their being washed, but I am clear that it was due to
the influence of water.</p>

  <p>Rain? &mdash; It might be rain.</p>

  <p>That is -what a waterproof is generally made to do, to keep the rain off
the body? &mdash; I think I am aware of that.</p>

  <p>As regards the coat, you cannot say that there is blood on it, and you
cannot say that it had been washed? &mdash; For the reasons I have stated.</p>

  <p>A great many of the stains were other things altogether? &mdash; Some of
them, of course, were. In examining a garment we look at everything. Some of
these were little frayed pieces of rubber due to the manufacture. We examined
twenty stains in all, and it was only in some of them we got these corpuscular
bodies that I have named.</p>

  <p>Suppose the murderer had knelt upon the body of his victim and used an
instrument like a hammer or a crowbar, or anything which would cause these
wounds, looking to the extensive spattering of blood that there was about this
room and on the articles of furniture, would you not expect that the murderer
himself would get badly bespattered with blood? &mdash; I would expect the man
who applied the violence in the way I think he did would have his clothing more
or less bespattered with blood.</p>

  <p>To a large extent? &mdash; That, of course, would depend. Judging from
the amount of injury in this case, I would say to a fairly large extent.</p>

  <p>His hands could not escape, I suppose? &mdash; I should hardly think not,
nor the hammer, nor any other instrument he employed.</p>

  <p>He would likely have blood upon his sleeves and hands? &mdash; He might
have gloves on &mdash; I cannot say.</p>

  <p>Or on his gloves? &mdash; Anything that came in contact with the body
would have blood on it.</p>

  <p>This was a head that was so smashed that bits of the brain tissue were
found on the hearth rug? &mdash; Yes, it was one of the most brutally smashed
heads I have ever seen in my experience. A good deal of blood came from the old
lady after death.</p>

  <p>As regards the direction the blood went, I understand that not only were
the fire-irons and grate bespattered with blood, but also the coal scuttle to a
considerable extent? &mdash; A fairly large extent.</p>

  <p>And also the tablecloth that was on the table? &mdash; The drooping
portion at the side next where the head was was bespattered, but not so freely
as some of the other parts.</p>

  <p>The body was covered with the rug with the red hair? &mdash; I was told
so. I did not see it.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me which side of the rug was resting on the old lady's body?
&mdash; No. I can only say that the hairy side was said to be downwards.</p>

  <p>From the description you got it had been drawn over the body by the
murderer? &mdash; That I could not say. It was a matter of very little
consequence to me. I was not concerned with the rug. I was concerned with the
body.</p>

  <p>Suppose the hairy side was on the top of the body, and on the upper side
there was found to be a considerable stain of blood, where might that come
from? &mdash; That might easily come from some of the blood bespattered on the
old lady's clothes.</p>

  <p>If this was found on the top of the rug, after it was laid on the body,
is it not probable that it came from the instrument which had been used to
murder the old lady or some part of the murderer's person? &mdash; That is
again a speculation. I can give no view except this, that that is not a large
stain; it could not have been a stain produced from contact with the weapon. It
looks like a small soaking or staining from the place where the blood was.</p>

  <p>Did you examine the coat that was found, internally as well as
externally?&mdash;Yes, we examined certain stains from the interior of the coat
as well as from the exterior.</p>

  <p>Provided the person who did this deed murdered the old lady with his coat
on there probably would be a good deal of external blood stains? &mdash; Yes,
that is where you would expect it to be, unless the coat was open and reflected
back during the actual assault.</p>

  <p>And if the deed was committed with the coat off, then, I suppose, if he
put on his coat again the inside would be extensively stained? &mdash; It would
be more or less stained. The stain might not be so defined, but there would be
smears on the inside of the coat.</p>

  <p>And the sleeves, of course, would show internally? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>They would show stains of blood? &mdash; Naturally anywhere where there
were stains on the inner coat those would be reflected on the waterproof coat,
if that were put on after the assault had been committed.</p>

  <p>And if the person put a bloody hammer into his pocket then the pocket
would be stained with blood? &mdash; Yes, unless the hammer was wiped or washed
beforehand.</p>

  <p>Were there any stains in the pockets? &mdash; No, we examined the
pockets.</p>

  <p>So what you have given us to-day is the result of a thorough and
exhaustive examination of all the clothing? &mdash; Yes. I think I may claim
that for the examination.</p>

  <p>I suppose if the murderer took up and put on his hat he would probably
leave blood stains on his hat? &mdash; That depends on whether his hands were
clean or not, or whether he wore gloves or not. It is too speculative to
answer.</p>

  <p>This whole thing is speculative? &mdash; I would not like to say that,
but I think the question is too speculative to enable me to give an intelligent
answer.</p>

  <p>Do you not think that any of these wounds were caused by the auger?
&mdash; Some of them could have been produced by the auger.</p>

  <p>Which ones? &mdash; Some of those slighter ones.</p>

  <p>The spindle-shaped ones? &mdash; One or two of the smaller of these might
have been, but they would be very limited as regards the wounds we found.</p>

  <p>I notice in your report you say that there was a deep hole on the left
side of the face between the eye socket and the left ear. Might that have been
the result of a blow with the auger? &mdash; No. An auger could not have gone
through the bone there.</p>

  <p>The auger had attached to it some grey hair. What is your theory as to
how the grey hair became attached to the auger if the auger had not been used
at all in connection with this offence? &mdash; I have not any theory at all. I
was shown the auger with a certain number of grey hairs attached to it, which
auger, I was informed, had been found in the back court immediately below the
kitchen window.</p>

  <p>Do you think that the attachment of the grey hairs is a mere coincidence,
and has nothing to do with this crime? &mdash; That I cannot say. The finder of
the instrument will be probably better able to tell you than I.</p>

  <p>I see in your earlier report, dated 22nd December, you state, "On
examination we found that adhering to the metal of the instrument were several
grey hairs, and in addition what seemed to be blood." Did you think it was
blood at that time? &mdash; Yes. It is one of the commonest possible mistakes
people make to think that when they have got a very rusty instrument,
particularly an auger, which has a spiral screw on it, when that implement is
wet, the colour is due to blood. I protected myself by using the words, "What
seemed to be blood."</p>

  <p>Of course, naturally your report was the first report drawn up
immediately after the occurrence for the police? &mdash; I understand it was
simply to visit the locus of the crime in order to find out if there was
anything there to throw any light on the mode of causation of the crime.</p>

  <p>Further examination led you to say, "Examination of scrapings of material
from various portions of the instrument gave no indications of the presence of
blood"? &mdash; I have said so &mdash; it was not blood on the auger that we
discovered, and we looked very carefully for its presence.</p>

  <p>The result of your examination comes to this, that no blood has been
found anywhere except on the rug in the house, upon the old lady's body itself,
upon the various surroundings, the fire-irons, coal scuttle, upon the
tablecloth in the room, and upon the mat that was covering the old lady?
&mdash; Your view is quite right, subject to the explanation I have already
given with regard to these corpuscular bodies.</p>

  <p>And you cannot say it is blood? &mdash; By reason of the absence of
corroborative tests I am not able to say here that it is blood, but I have no
doubt in my own mind that these were blood corpuscles.</p>

  <p>Is not that a funny thing to say &mdash; a thing you will not swear to?
Is there anything except those articles in the room which I have mentioned
which you can say are blood stains? &mdash; No. Putting it as you want me to
put it, I am inclined to say that I cannot positively prove that any instrument
found in the possession of the accused contained blood.</p>

  <p>Or any article of raiment? &mdash; Or any article found in the possession
of the accused.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Looking to the length of the hammer, if the hammer
had been put into any of the pockets of that coat would it have disappeared, or
would a portion stick out? &mdash; My recollection is that a portion of the
handle, if it had been put head downwards, would have stuck out from the top of
the pocket by perhaps 4 inches.</p>

  <p>How far had any of the blood gone in distance from where the body was
lying? &mdash; Well, I can answer that by explaining the precise surroundings.
The body was lying on the rug in front of the fireplace, the head being about
15 to 18 inches from the edge of the fender. The feet were towards the doorway
of the dining-room. On the left side of the head of the body came the fender,
the fire-irons, the grate, and the fire-bars &mdash; the back of the grate. On
the right of the body came the table at which the deceased had been sitting,
within not more than 2 feet at the very furthest, perhaps less than that; then
the chair upon which the deceased had been sitting, and next to that the droop
of the table-cloth from the table. Beyond the head of the deceased was a soft
bottomed easy-chair, some of the fronts of the legs of which were also
bespattered with blood, towards the head of the deceased; that would be
probably 2&frac12; and 3 feet. Then towards the feet of the body, but on the
left side of the body, came the coal scuttle, which stood beside the fireplace;
and then there was a smaller chair which stood at the head.</p>

  <p>Was it marked? &mdash; The coal scuttle, but not the easy-chair; my
impression is that the deed occurred within an area bound by a radius of 3 feet
from the head.</p>

  <p>When the injuries were inflicted would there be a spurt of blood from any
artery, or simply the scattering of the material? &mdash; It depends entirely
upon where the first stroke was; it is quite obvious that there must have been
spurting of the blood where the wounds were caused over the temporal arteries;
there were large wounds there; and then there would be spurting of blood where
certain arteries on the front of the brows were opened up, but I cannot say in
point of time when that had happened.</p>

  <p>Suppose the old lady was on the ground and blows were the inflicted by a
person bending over her, if there was a spurt then that would probably come in
contact with this person? &mdash; It might. It would depend altogether on the
incidence of the angle and the force.</p>

  <p>What is your view, from what you saw of the position and the nature of
the wounds, as to the course of the assault; take it that she was sitting at
the table reading, the door opens, and the murderer enters; what is your view
as to what happened? &mdash; My view is that the old lady was not sitting when
she received the blows". The chair, I am told, was standing on its four legs
beside the place at which it was left when the servant girl went out. My view
is that the woman when she saw a stranger entering her room stood to her feet,
that she received a blow with something, and was knocked down.</p>

  <p>Front or back? &mdash; I think the front; she was knocked down on the
floor; the assailant instantly pounced on her, and knelt on her, fracturing her
ribs and breast bone during the act of the repeated blows, and that the
instrument, whatever it was, produced those frightful injuries upon her head
and face.</p>

  <p>Have you any idea how many blows might probably have been inflicted?
&mdash; No, but there must have been several &mdash; a very large number I
should say; to give a rough guess, judging from the wounds and the size of
them, anything between twenty and forty blows.</p>

  <p>Of course, looking to the time available, with great rapidity? &mdash;
Oh, it must have been with almost lightning rapidity. It must have been a
furious assault, a continuous assault, before the assailant rose to do anything
further he wanted.</p>

  <p>And then, if it be the fact that the rug, which had been in front of the
sideboard, was found on the old lady, he had then taken the rug and put it over
her? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>You say in your report that you cannot affirm positively as to the red
blood corpuscles, "because by reason of the small amount of material at
disposal, confirmatory tests for blood could not be employed." Suppose you had
had such an amount as would have enabled you to apply confirmatory tests, is it
your view that they might either have confirmed your first view or they might
have failed to confirm, or they might have disproved it? &mdash; That is so;
one of these three conclusions might have been arrived at. The presumption, of
course, is when we find corpuscular bodies in a red-coloured stain we then
proceed to the corroboratory tests, both spectroscopic and chemical. Now, if we
do not find corroboratory tests, both spectroscopic and chemical, then we must
give up the idea of their being blood. We do not feel justified, I do not feel
justified personally, in the case of a serious charge like this, to say, merely
on the presence of corpuscles, that there was blood, without corroboratory
tests.</p>

  <p>It is quite reasonably possible, even in the case of what you
ascertained, viz., "on microscopic examination, corpuscular bodies resembling
in general appearances mammalian red blood corpuscles" &mdash; it is quite
reasonably possible that confirmatory tests might have disproved there being
mammalian blood corpuscles? &mdash; We must assume that; I am quite willing to
assume that.</p>

  <p>Apart from disproving, it might have altogether failed to prove it?
&mdash; If we had had sufficient material we should either have been able to
prove it or to disprove it; there should be no difficulty about either one or
other of these conclusions.</p>

  <p>You said, "In a case of this kind." Suppose it were not a case of this
kind, but some commercial question, how would you act? Having found what you
thought resembled mammalian blood corpuscles, but not having sufficient to
apply confirmatory tests, would you or would you not proceed on the footing
that they were blood corpuscles? &mdash; If it were not a case of the kind it
is, judging from my very long experience of examination of these stains, I
would, without hesitation, say that, in my view, to the best of my knowledge
and belief, these were red blood corpuscles.</p>

  <p>What is the difference; why do you put mammalian red blood corpuscles?
&mdash; Because the red corpuscles of different classes of animals differ in
appearance. The mammalian corpuscle is a circular disc with no nucleus in it,
no little kernel in it inside. In birds, and fishes, and reptiles they are oval
shaped, with a nucleus or kernel.</p>

  <p>But in mammalian animals, whether lower animals or man, there is no
characteristic distinction, is there, between the blood corpuscles? &mdash; Do
you mean in the mammalian class?</p>

  <p>Yes? &mdash; No, except with regard to one class, the camel tribe.</p>

  <p>As between man and certain of the lower animals, there is no distinction?
&mdash; You mean as differentiating by the corpuscle the nature of the
animal?</p>

  <p>Yes? &mdash; No; I should not like to say, from what is here, that there
is anything to differentiate between the human and the general class of
mammalian.</p><br>

  <p>Dr. HUGH GALT, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I have been in
practice as a physician and surgeon for about seventeen and a half years. I
hold the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine, Master of Surgery, Bachelor of
Science, Fellow of the Faculty, and Diplomate in Public Health of Cambridge.
Along with Professor Glaister, the last witness, I made an examination of the
surroundings of the murder at 15 Queen's Terrace, Glasgow. (Shown production
No. 2.) That is our report. It is correct. On the following day I, in
conjunction with Professor Glaister, made a post-mortem examination of the body
of the late Miss Gilchrist at the Royal Infirmary. (Shown production No. 3.)
That is the report.</p>

  <p>It is a true report. From what I saw at the house on the 22nd December,
it is my opinion that none of the fire-irons had been used, and nothing else in
the room had been used as the implement with which the wounds were inflicted. I
found that the fire-irons were in their places. They had simply spatters of
blood on the top surface.</p>

  <p>Was the area within which you found blood spots comparatively limited
round the old lady's head? &mdash; In one direction it was limited; it was
limited in the direction of the chair and table, but it extended pretty far
over the fire-irons and grate. That is to say, in the direction of her feet
there was little, but in the direction away from her feet, on one side of her
head, there was a good deal. That was just what I would have expected from the
character of the wounds. There were a great many wounds on the head and face,
and, of course, a number had coalesced to form one large, ragged wound. The
number of blows that had been struck must have been very great, certainly not
under fifty or sixty, I should fancy; probably a good many more. They must have
been delivered by a strong hand or a powerful weapon. I formed an opinion as to
the way in which the ribs and the breast bone had got fractured. They were
broken by the assailant either kneeling or jumping on the old woman's chest. I
think she was standing first and facing, and was knocked down, and then
battered. From the character of the injuries, I conjecture that her assailant
was kneeling upon her body, probably while she lay on the rug. I saw this
morning the hammer produced in this case. (Shown production No. 47.) If that
hammer was wielded by a strong man kneeling on the old lady's body, and a
succession of severe blows were struck, it could produce the injuries I saw.</p>

  <p>Is that the kind of implement that you think must have been used to
inflict the wounds? I do not say that that was the exact implement, but an
implement of that kind? &mdash; Something of this nature. All the wounds that I
saw could have been inflicted by using that hammer in one or another of several
different ways; sideways, or with the claw, or with the head.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Isn't it more likely to have been a
heavier hammer that did this extensive damage? &mdash; Well, if I had been
asked in the abstract, I would have said, "Yes, the weapon was likely a heavier
weapon."</p>

  <p>I mean the smashing in this case is very extensive? &mdash; Most
extensive.</p>

  <p>And, in fact, the different blows had been administered over areas of the
skull repeatedly so as to make one large wound? &mdash; In a number of the
cases.</p>

  <p>I suppose it is really impossible to say now what instrument exactly was
employed? &mdash; It is impossible to say exactly; it just means that it was a
weapon with some weight, and with sharp edges to it; something of the nature of
this undoubtedly.</p>

  <p>But unlikely to have been this, you would have thought? &mdash; A
'priori, yes.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Why do you say a priori? &mdash;
If I had heard the story and was asked what kind of weapon was employed, I
would have said probably something heavier, of the nature of a butcher's
cleaver.</p>

  <p>A heavier weapon? &mdash; A heavier weapon.</p>

  <p>But if that weapon were wielded by a powerful hand, it would be quite
capable of inflicting all the wounds? &mdash; That comes to the same thing,
greater force with a lesser weapon.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Were there any holes where the eye was driven into
the brain that must have been produced by a weapon with no greater diameter
than a hammer, as compared, I mean, with a coal hammer? &mdash; Yes, a smaller
head than an ordinary coal hammer.</p>

  <p>Were there, or were there not, certain wounds which could not have been
produced by a heavy coal hammer or anything of that kind? &mdash; That was one,
the one you have mentioned; that was really the only one.</p>

  <p>But if that existed, there must have been for that one a small weapon
such as that hammer? &mdash; Yes, with a weapon of that nature, with a head of
no greater diameter, or very little, at all events.</p><br>

  <p>Professor HARVEY LITTLEJOHN, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am
Professor of Medical Jurisprudence in Edinburgh University. In conjunction with
Professor Glaister I examined certain articles that were handed; to me by the
police authorities at Glasgow, and in conjunction with him I made a report.
(Shown production No. 4.) That is my report. It is a correct report. I examined
carefully the auger that is mentioned in the report. I have read the two
reports made by Professor Glaister and Dr. Galt. I think it is impossible that
the auger could have inflicted the wounds that I see described in Professor
Glaister' s and Dr. Galt's report, because the injuries are very serious; the
auger is comparatively short, only 13 inches long, and it is comparatively
light.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Have you any theory as to the
attachment of the grey hair to the auger? &mdash; No, I cannot say that I have
thought about it.</p><br>

  <p>JAMES BARR, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a fishmonger in
Glasgow. I am a member of a club called the Sloper Club at 24 India Street. I
am also a member of the Motor Club next door, at Nos. 26 and 28 India Street. I
know the prisoner. I knew him by the name of Oscar Slater. I knew him by sight
about ten years ago in Glasgow. He lived there ten years ago. I do not know the
address; I understood he lived in Kelvinhaugh. I could not say how long he was
in Kelvinhaugh when I knew him. It would be a short period. After losing sight
of him for five or six years I saw him in November last year. I first saw him
in Kelvinhaugh Street, Glasgow. I saw him in a public-house there. I could not
fix the date. It was in November. About ten days afterwards I met him in the
Sloper Club. He was with a person named Hugh Cameron, whom I knew. He was not
introduced to me at that time by Cameron. He went out, and Cameron asked me to
propose him as a member of the Sloper Club. I demurred to doing so.</p>

  <p>Why? &mdash; Well, his reputation was not good, and I objected to him. I
agreed to do it afterwards. I do not think he was introduced to me before I did
it. I put him up under the name of Oscar Slater. The address was an address in
Renfrew Street; I do not remember the number. That was in November.</p>

  <p>Was it towards the end of November or near the middle of it? &mdash; I
could not be sure what date it was. There was no designation given that I
remember. The name remained on the notice board of the club for fourteen days,
I think. He was then elected a member.</p>

  <p>Was he elected a member by the beginning of December? &mdash; I could not
be sure about the date.</p>

  <p>Was it about that time? &mdash; It would be near December if it was not.
After he became a member I saw him in the Sloper Club at nights very
frequently.</p>

  <p>Can you say whether or not he came every week-night? &mdash; Not every
night; I saw him very often while I was there. I do not think I was in the club
on the night of Miss Gilchrist's murder, the 21st of December; I could not be
certain. I remember hearing about the murder.</p>

  <p>Can you try and recollect whether you were in the club that day or not?
&mdash; No, it was the next day I heard about it. I do not think I was in the
club on the night of the murder. I could not be certain whether I was in the
Motor Club that night. I think the last time I saw Oscar Slater was about the
week-end previous to the murder. I had no official connection with the club; I
was not on the committee at that time.</p>

  <p>When you saw him in the club did you notice what he was dressed in?
&mdash; He was in a grey worsted suit at one time; he was always well
dressed.</p>

  <p>Did you see him in different dresses? &mdash; Well, he had a different
suit on one or two occasions. I never saw him on any occasion wearing a drab or
fawn-coloured waterproof.</p>

  <p>Did he intimate his intention to resign the membership of the club, or
intimate that he was going away? &mdash; I heard a remark passed one night that
he intended going to America. That was some time previous to the murder.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; I could not say whether that remark was passed by
him or by another member.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; How long was it before Miss
Gilchrist's murder that you heard he was going off to America? &mdash; I think
it would be some days before that.</p>

  <p>Would you put it at the week preceding? &mdash; Quite possible.</p>

  <p>Might I ask you a question; why cannot you remember whether you were in
the Motor Club upon the Monday night or the Sloper Club? &mdash; I cannot
remember whether I was in either of the clubs that night.</p>

  <p>Why not? &mdash; Well, I do not keep a diary.</p>

  <p>I suppose, looking back at this distance of time, you find it rather
difficult to say what nights you were in the club and what nights you were not?
&mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>About the address in Renfrew Street, I meant to ask you this, do you know
whether the man was living at Renfrew Street at that time? &mdash; I could not
tell you.</p>

  <p>Who entered his address in the club book; would it be Cameron? &mdash;
That would be the secretary's work.</p>

  <p>Who would provide the secretary with the address in Renfrew Street; it
would be either the proposer or the seconder? &mdash; I do not think so; a form
was filled up and I was asked to propose him.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Was the address on the form?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Did you know him under any other name than Oscar
Slater? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you know what his occupation was? &mdash; I certainly had formed
opinions previously, but I did not express them.</p>

  <p>Did you know whether he had any regular occupation or did you not?
&mdash; I do not think so.</p>

  <p>You mean that you do not think he had any? &mdash; I do not think so; of
course, that is only my opinion.</p>

  <p>Did he appear to be a man of education? &mdash; Yes, he was very
cultured.</p>

  <p>Did he speak English well? &mdash; Pretty well.</p>

  <p>With a foreign accent? &mdash; You would know he was a foreigner.</p>

  <p>Do you know what other languages he spoke? &mdash; No, I do not.</p>

  <p>Have you ever had a letter from him? &mdash; No, I had no personal
connection with him.</p><br>

  <p>GORDON HENDERSON, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am club-master
of the Motor Club at 26 India Street, Glasgow. I reside in the club-house. The
Motor Club was registered in November last. We have a membership of about 150
now. There was a member of the club called Hugh Cameron. He was a frequent
visitor. I could not tell the date in November when the Motor Club was
registered, but it was about the 4th of November when we opened. About three
weeks after the club was opened I remember a stranger calling at the club and
asking for Mr. Cameron, and my son went next door to the Sloper Club and
inquired for Mr. Cameron and brought him out. The gentleman remained at the
door in the hall until Mr. Cameron came out, and then Mr. Cameron took him
upstairs. I saw the man that Cameron brought upstairs. I could not tell at that
time what his name was; he went under the name of Oscar Slater. (Shown
prisoner.) That is the gentleman. As far as I can remember Mr. Slater was in
the club about three times. The second time would be about a fortnight
afterwards, as near as I can remember. It was Mr. Cameron who brought him that
time. His name was not entered in the visitors' book. As far as I can see, it
was not entered as Oscar Slater. The third time that Oscar Slater came to the
club, to my memory, was on the 21st of December, a Monday night. He came
somewhere about a quarter to ten, as near as I could remember. He rang the
bell. I answered it. When I opened the door when the bell was rung I found Mr.
Slater there. Mr. Slater stepped into the hall, and he said to me, "Have you
any money in the club, Mr. Henderson?" and I said, No." He said, "Give me what
you have and I will give you a cheque for it." I said, "My committee do not
allow me to lend money, and all I have got is just a few shillings and coppers
for change," but I said, "If you go next door you will find Mr. Cameron there
likely, he might assist you." He made the remark that Mr. Cameron was no use,
and he turned to go out, and I opened the door and he went downstairs. By "next
door" I meant the Sloper Club. I saw the man was excited a little. He seemed to
be very anxious to get money. He was dressed that night with a fawn-coloured
overcoat and a round felt hat which we call a Donegal hat. I did not observe
his boots at all. It is not a usual thing for members of the club or their
friends to come late at night asking money from me. On Monday night, 22nd of
February, I went to the Central Police Office in Glasgow. I went into a room
where there were a number of men. I was asked to point out the man that had
come to me at the club for money. I pointed out Mr. Slater, the man in the
dock. I had no difficulty whatever in pointing him out.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; You knew him personally, and had
known him a good long time? &mdash; No, I only spoke to the gentleman, I think,
twice.</p>

  <p>And you knew him then as Oscar Slater? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>When did you get to know his name as Oscar Slater? &mdash; When the two
detectives came in four or five days after the murder.</p>

  <p>At any rate, it was the same man who had been at the club before, and you
recognised him at once? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was Slater at any time a member of the club? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Had he ever a member's card? &mdash; Not that I am aware of; he might
have had one.</p>

  <p>I want to ask you this, what did you mean just now when you said he had a
Donegal hat on his head? &mdash; I mean one of these round hats with a rim
right round &mdash; a soft hat.</p>

  <p>Anything about its colour-? &mdash; I think it was a greyish colour
&mdash; a dark greyish colour.</p>

  <p>How long did he stop there on the night he came in? &mdash; About four or
five minutes altogether that night he came in to borrow the money.</p>

  <p>And he was inside the hall? &mdash; He was inside the doorway.</p>

  <p>Was he wearing a moustache that night? &mdash; Well, he was wearing a
moustache, but it was like a stubble.</p>

  <p>A short moustache? &mdash; Yes, a short moustache.</p>

  <p>And when he came in he had a waterproof coat on? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>(Shown production No. 43.) A thing like that? &mdash; Something after
that style.</p>

  <p>Did you notice any discomposure about his dress at all? &mdash; No, I did
not.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether you had ever seen him with that waterproof on before?
&mdash; No, I could not say I had.</p>

  <p>Had you taken any particular note of the dress that he wore on previous
occasions when you had seen him? &mdash; No, I had no occasion to take
particular note of the gentleman at all; all I know is that when he came into
the place he was a gentleman; he conducted himself like, a gentleman, and I had
no reason to come into contact with him other than passing him along with a
member.</p>

  <p>Do you know what kind of clothes he was wearing at the previous time he
was in the club &mdash; about the second time he was in the club? &mdash; I
think he had a bowler hat on, and a Melton overcoat, or something of that
style. I could not give you a description of the gentleman's clothing at all,
but I only refer to the Monday night, I know what he had that night.</p>

  <p>You said you thought he was excited; what did you mean by that? &mdash;
Well, I may tell you that when Mr. Slater asked me for money I thought it very
strange that he should ask me for money, and I just thought to myself that Mr.
Slater had been playing cards somewhere and had lost some money, and he wanted
something to go on playing with to get it back. At that time, or even the day
after, I knew of no event that would make me take any particular notice of Mr.
Slater.</p>

  <p>He did not go into the club next door? &mdash; No, I happened to look
down the stairs while Mr. Slater was going; he turned to the right, to Elmbank
Crescent.</p>

  <p>Is your club up a stair? &mdash; Ours is up about six steps; the Sloper
Club enters off the pavement direct to the left of mine.</p>

  <p>(Shown production No. 44.) By the COURT &mdash; Would you look at that
dark hat that is there; was the hat that Slater had that night at the club like
that or unlike it in colour and in shape? &mdash; Well, my idea of the hat that
he had on that night was of a different make from that &mdash; a Donegal.</p>

  <p>You do not call that a Donegal? &mdash; Well, no &mdash; not me.</p>

  <p>Is your idea of the Donegal hat one that goes down in the centre with a
cock or is worn without being touched? &mdash; No, my idea of the Donegal hat
is a complete round hat; you can put it into any shape you like.</p>

  <p>Is it like a bowler hat but soft? &mdash; Soft.</p>

  <p>So that you may have a depression if you choose? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What is the difference between a Donegal hat and that one? &mdash; Well,
I could not tell you the name of this one.</p>

  <p>In what respect does that hat differ from a Donegal hat? &mdash; Allow me
to shift this; the Donegal hat is more like that (illustrating), with the rim
coming that way, coming up; the rim sits up right round, and you can put the
Donegal hat any way you like. My idea of this hat is that it is too dark.</p>

  <p>It is not the shape, and it is not the colour? &mdash; Not to my
idea.</p><br>

  <p>PETER CRAWFORD M'LAREN, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am
manager to Alexander Liddell, a pawnbroker, at 8 Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow. I
recollect of a man coming to my premises on the 18th of November last. He
signed his name as "A. Anderson." He pledged a diamond brooch, and he got
&pound;20 on it. (Shown production No. 51.) That is the brooch. I handed him
over the &pound;20 in notes. The address he gave was 136 Renfrew Street. He
signed his name and address in that way in our private loan book. (Shown
production No. 52.) He got a copy of the contract with him like this. I had
seen the man before, on the 14th &mdash; four days before. He was at our
premises then, and he pledged a diamond scarf pin for some &pound;5. On that
occasion he gave the same name and address, "Anderson, 136 Renfrew Street." The
same man returned to my place of business on the 9th of December last. He then
wanted mother &pound;10 on the brooch, which he got. On that occasion he signed
his name as before, "A. Anderson, 136 Renfrew Street." The next time that he
came was on the 21st December. He got &pound;30 more. I think it would be about
half-past twelve mid-day when he came on the 21st December. He redeemed a
pledge, which cost him &pound;6 4s. That pledge was a gold purse, a fountain
pen, three pearl studs, and a ring. I think he would get about &pound;23 5s. of
money. I think the money was partly in notes and partly gold, as far as I
remember. These articles that he redeemed were pledged by him on Tuesday, 17th
November, for &pound;6. I was not present when he pledged them. I am only
speaking from having seen the signature in the book. I had no hesitation in
giving him back the articles; he presented the ticket for them. (Shown
prisoner.) That is the man. I was asked to go down to Duke Street Prison on the
10th of March, and I identified him there. I had no difficulty in identifying
the man as the man who had called at my premises.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; As I understand, this diamond
crescent brooch was pledged on the 18th November; is that right? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>And &pound;20 advanced on it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>On 9th December there was a further advance of &pound;10, making
&pound;30 in all? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And on 21st December he got a further advance of &pound;30 on it, making
&pound;60 upon this diamond crescent brooch? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>He had had some dealings with you in between for some smaller articles?
&mdash; The 14th November was the first time I saw him.</p>

  <p>The 14th November was one time; was that the time he pledged the other
articles? &mdash; Personally with me &mdash; the second was on 17th
November.</p>

  <p>On the 21st of December, what he did, I understand, was to raise
&pound;30 more upon this diamond brooch, and lift the other things he had
pledged with you? &mdash; Yes, to the extent of &pound;6.</p>

  <p>From that date, 21st December, you held only the one article, and there
was &pound;60 advanced on it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is this kind of transaction one which is common enough in your business?
&mdash; It is quite common in our office, anyway.</p>

  <p>For people to deposit things with you and to get advances from time to
time? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is it a fact that Oscar Slater had done business with your employer, Mr,
Liddell before? &mdash; Yes, about January, 1900, his name appears in our
books.</p>

  <p>Is that the only time it is in your books? &mdash; Well, a few months
after that it continues, until 1902, periodically.</p>

  <p>Did your master, Mr. Liddell, know him as Oscar Slater? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you know him as Oscar Slater? &mdash; Well, Mr. Liddell told me on
the 17th; he had seen the scarf pin on the 14th, and on the 17th he said, "Do
you know who pledged the scarf pin?" and I said, "No," and ha &brvbar; said,
"That is Oscar Slater."</p>

  <p>There is another thing I want to ask you: are pawn tickets, to your
knowledge, ever sold? &mdash; Quite commonly, I believe.</p>

  <p>And, of course, the person who presents the pawn ticket, as I understand,
is the person with whom you settle? &mdash; He is the owner of the goods, as
far as we are concerned.</p>

  <p>So that if a person sold a pawn ticket in order to raise money you would
recognise the buyer as the owner of the goods, and all he would have to do to
get the goods back would be to pay your advances on it? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>So that any person to whom Slater sold the pawn ticket for the crescent
brooch would be entitled on payment of the &pound;60 to receive the brooch
back? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You say that kind of transaction is a common enough one amongst people
who lodge deposits? &mdash; Quite common.</p><br>

  <p>ALEXANDER RANKIN, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am an inspector in
the Western District of the Glasgow Police. In consequence of instructions
which I received from Detective-Inspector Pyper I went, on 22nd December last,
to the house at 15 Queen's Terrace. That was to search the back green there, to
ascertain if anything could be discovered that had some connection with the
murder that had taken place the night before. 1 reached the back green about 10
a.m. on that day. I searched the back green. I found a piece of iron, or an
auger. I found it lying in the grass opposite Miss Gilchrist's kitchen window.
It was on the grass. There was grass below it &mdash; only grass. I lifted up
the auger. I saw something else below it when I lifted it up. Some lady's hair
came up along with it. I did not form any opinion as to how the hair had come
there. It was like combings. The hair was sticking to the auger. It was raining
at the time, and the hair and the auger were both wet. I did not see any mark
on the ground that could have been made by the auger having been thrown from a
height. I cannot say from my examination of the ground whether the auger had
been thrown out or not. I examined to see whether there was any mark on the
ground round about it, but there was none. The grass upon which the auger
rested was not in any way pressed down. It seemed to have been there for a
short time only. If it had been lying there for a long time the grass would
have been stained with the rust. I took the auger and the hair to the police
Court and labelled them. (Shown label 35.) That is the auger. I looked to see
what had caused the hair to stick to the auger, but I could not say whether it
was rust or blood. It was some wet substance. The hair was sticking on the
smooth part of the auger up to the point.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Was it your idea that this had been
used in any way in connection with the murder? &mdash; That was my opinion at
the time because of the hair.</p><br>

  <p>GEORGE FINDLAY, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am a timber merchant in
the firm of James Dowie &amp; Co., 50 Wellington Street, Glasgow. Before that I
carried on business for a number of years under the name of J. &amp; D.
Findlay, wrights and contractors, Grant Street, Glasgow, where we had premises
consisting of an engine house, sheds, and so on. We stopped work there about
the end of 1907. Although the gates were closed access could easily be got to
the premises. Part of our premises were just behind Miss Gilchrist's house. We
had augers in our premises. The auger under label No. 25 is like the type of
auger that we had in our premises just behind Miss Gilchrist's house. That type
of auger is used for a steam boring machine.</p>

  <p>Are you aware that after your works were stopped boys used to frequent
your premises? &mdash; I am not aware of that, but it is possible that they
would do so. It frequently happened that some of the augers disappeared.
Inspector Rankin showed me the place where that auger was found. I noticed that
our "workshop windows were broken just opposite the garden. There were similar
augers in the machine shop at that point. Although I cannot particularly swear
to the auger that has been produced, still it is like those that we had.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; It might belong to anybody so far
as you know? &mdash; Yes, it might.</p>

  <p>And you do not know how it came there? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You had been away from these premises over a year before? &mdash; Yes.
quite a year before.</p>

  <p>And that is all you know about it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p class="c">The Court adjourned at half-past six o'clock.</p>

1909.</a></h2>

  <p class="c">The Court met at ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>JOHN BAIN, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a clerk in the
employment of Thomas Cook &amp; Son, tourist and shipping agents, Buchanan
Street, Glasgow. I remember that on Wednesday, 23rd December last, a man called
at the office when I was in, between four and five o'clock in the afternoon. He
gave me as his name and address "Oscar Slater, c/o Anderson, 69 St. George's
Road, Glasgow." He wanted a two-berth cabin in the Cunard Line steamer
"Lusitania," second-class, for himself and his wife. The "Lusitania" was to
sail on the Saturday, 26th December. I told him that the fare was &pound;12
each, and I said that that was the minimum rate, that the price would rise
according to the accommodation. I told him that it was too late to wire the
company at Liverpool that night, but I promised to write and ask the company by
wire in the morning. (Shown production No. 37/1.) I wrote that letter.</p>

  <p class="quote" style="text-align:right">83 Buchanan Street,<br>
  Glasgow, 23 Decr., 1908.</p>

  <p class="quote">Messrs. Cunard Line, Liverpool.</p>

  <p class="quote" style="text-align:center">"Lusitania," 26 Decr., 1908.</p>

  <p class="quote">Dear Sirs, &mdash; Kindly wire us to-morrow if you can
offer married couple a second-class room at &pound;24 (&pound;12 each), per the
above to New York, and oblige. &mdash; Yours</p>

  <p class="quote" style="text-align:right">THOS. COOK &amp; SON,<br>
  per J.B.</p>

  <p>I asked the man before he left to call next morning at 11.30, but he did
not call then. He called in the afternoon about the same time, between four and
five. By the time he had arrived we had received the telegram No. 37/2.</p>

  <p class="quote"><tt>TO COUPON, GLASGOW. SECONDS, "LUSITANIA." SATURDAY.
OFFER COUPLE ROOM E76, TWELVE POUNDS RATE. &mdash; CUNARD.</tt></p>

  <p>I told him what the contents of the telegram were; I believe he would see
the telegram. I showed him the ship's plan and the room offered, but he was not
satisfied. He said he thought he could do better in Liverpool, that he
preferred an outside cabin. I told him that if he booked the cabin that was
offered he could adjust matters at Liverpool. He said he would look back next
day (Friday, Christmas Day). He did not come on Christmas Day. That is all that
passed between him and me. In consequence of his call we wrote the letter to
the Cunard Line, No. 37/3 of productions.</p>

  <p class="quote" style="text-align:right">83 Buchanan Street,<br>
  Glasgow, 24th December, 1908.</p>

  <p class="quote">Messrs. Cunard Line, Liverpool.</p>

  <p class="quote" style="text-align:center">"Lusitania," 26th December.</p>

  <p class="quote">Dear Sirs, &mdash; We beg to thank you for your wire of
date, offering room E76 at the &pound;12 rate in favour of Mr. and Mrs. Oscar
Slater. This gentleman has called to-day, and is very much disappointed at not
having an outside room. We, however, explained to him that the rate of
&pound;12 provided only for inside accommodation. He, however, replies that he
could do better with you in Liverpool. We asked him if he would take out ticket
for room E76 and endeavour to adjust with you in Liverpool on Saturday. He has
promised to give us his decision to-morrow, on receipt of which we will advise
you. &mdash; Yours truly,&lt;7P&gt;</p>

  <p class="quote" style="text-align:right">THOS. COOK &amp; SON,<br>

  <p>That correctly represents what passed. When he failed to call as he had

  <p>We got a letter from the Cunard Company saying that no one of his name
had sailed with the steamer. I identified the prisoner as the man who called at
the office. I went down to the Central Police Office on 21st February last, and
I identified him amongst a number of other men.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; When he called did he seem to be
quite cool and collected? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>He just made inquiry for a berth in the usual way? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When you showed him that he was to get room E76, and that was an inside
berth, did he express disappointment? &mdash; Yes. He said that one reason was
that his wife was a bad sailor. That was all.</p>

  <p>An outside berth is fresher? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>He called back on the Thursday, but not so early as you expected? &mdash;
That is so.</p>

  <p>When did he call? &mdash; To the best of my knowledge it was between four
and five on Thursday afternoon.</p>

  <p>Your letter of 24:th December expresses accurately what Slater expressed
to you? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>He suggested that he might arrange with them in Liverpool? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You expected him back on the Friday to say whether he would take it or
not? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And he did not turn up? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; How was he dressed? &mdash; I cannot remember.</p>

  <p>You cannot remember his coat or hat or anything? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you think he was a foreigner? &mdash; Yes, that was my impression.</p>

  <p>When you saw him and identified him was there anything except his general
appearance that enabled you to identify him? &mdash; No, I knew him. I had seen
him twice on the Wednesday and on the Thursday.</p>

  <p>But had you noticed anything peculiar about his appearance on which your
identification went, or was it merely his general appearance? &mdash; I noticed
this much, that he looked much older then than when I had seen him before.</p>

  <p>But did you identify him by any peculiarity distinguishing him from other
people or by his general appearance? &mdash; I knew him by his face.</p>

  <p>Did you notice any peculiarity in his face or general appearance? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>There was nothing about either his nose that struck you, nor his walk,
nor anything else? &mdash; No.</p><br>

  <p>JOHN FORSYTH, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am manager of the
second-class department in the offices of the Cunard Steamship Company in
Liverpool. About 12.30 on 26th December a man came to the office. I saw him
personally. He asked for accommodation in the "Lusitania" sailing that day. I
told him that we could give him accommodation, and I asked whether the
accommodation was required for himself or for a gentleman and wife. He replied
that it was for gentleman and wife. I offered him a certain room. Strange to
say, I offered him the identical room that had been offered to Messrs. Cook. He
said he would not take that as it had been offered through an agent in Glasgow,
and he kind of turned to withdraw the statement, but he made no remark.</p>

  <p>How do you mean? &mdash; I offered him E76, and he said, "No, I do not
like that, it is inside; it was offered by your agents in Glasgow." He kind of
wanted to withdraw the remark. He made no further remark. I offered him another
room, which, being inside, was again refused. I asked what he required, and he
said he wanted an outside room. I offered him another room, an outside room,
but the price was somewhat excessive. I stuck to my figure, however, and
eventually he accepted the room. He paid me &pound;28 for two tickets &mdash;
at least he paid &pound;30 in notes, and I gave him &pound;2 in change. He
produced a &pound;1 Scotch note, for which I gave him a sovereign. The money he
paid me was in the form of Scotch notes, to the best of my knowledge &pound;5
notes. I asked him his name, and he said "Otto Sando."</p>

  <p>Did he ask you whether you wanted his full name? &mdash; I cannot
recollect the circumstances exactly. He told me how to spell his name. He
repeated it, "S-a-n-d-o," and he remarked, "It is not Sandow, the strong man."
I then handed him the application form No. 37/5 of the productions in
accordance with the United States law, which makes it necessary that the form
should be filled in by all passengers. He filled in the form himself in my
presence.</p><br>

  <p class="quote" style="text-align:center">APPLICATION FORM to Cunard Co.,
for Contract Tickets.<br>
  <br>
  CUNARD LINE.</p>

  <p class="quote">(1) Steamer, "Lusitania," sailing from Liverpool on the
26.12.08;<br>
  (2) Name in full, Otto Sando and Anna Sando;<br>
  (3) Age 38 years;<br>
  (4) Sex,;<br>
  (5) Married or single. Married;<br>

  (7) Able to read and write, Yes;<br>
  (8) Nationality (country owning political allegiance or of which citizen or

Street.</p>

  <p>I recognise the prisoner as the man that came to me on the day I have
spoken to. He is clearly the man, and he can recognise me, too.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Was this matter carried through by
the man apparently just in the ordinary course? &mdash; Just in the ordinary
course &mdash; just an ordinary business arrangement.</p>

  <p>And he indicated to you that he had come from Glasgow? &mdash; Yes,</p>

  <p>But because he signed on board as Otto Sando, you did not identify him
with the Oscar Slater you had been reading about? &mdash; Not at the time.</p>

  <p>When he said, "Your agents in Glasgow," did that indicate to your mind
that he was about to refer to the previous correspondence? &mdash; Well, I had
previously no knowledge of anything having gone wrong, and furthermore, I have
so many people coming in and making various inquiries that unless there is
something actually drawn to my mind at the time I take no notice, and when Mr.
Sando or Mr. Slater came in and made the reference, "I had this offered from
another agent," and when he filled in the contract, I thought nothing more
about it.</p>

  <p>And you would not identify him as the man you had the correspondence
about? &mdash; Not at the time.</p>

  <p>Are there any regulations about the entry of people into the United
States; I mean have they strict rules about allowing people to land? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>And is the object of this thing which was filled up practically to
satisfy these rules? &mdash; To satisfy the authorities as to the intentions of
the parties entering the States; to show they have visible means of support or
to show what they intend to do there.</p>

  <p>Is there anything which asks about their financial condition? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>In this, is there? &mdash; Yes, questions No. 30, 27 to 30 &mdash; not on
the contract, but on another pink form. They must have not less than fifty
dollars.</p>

  <p>Then do you take the man's word as to his possession of fifty dollars?
&mdash; You must do that; you cannot put your hand in the man's pocket and
satisfy yourself.</p>

  <p>Then as to the occupation given as the occupation of dentist, you do not
know anything about that either? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>So far as you recollect, was the man quite cool and collected when he was
transacting this business? &mdash; I rather fancied he was somewhat nervous; I
do not know; it happened that while he was talking to me he looked at the door
as if he expected some one to come in. I thought he was expecting his wife or
some one else.</p>

  <p>There was nothing at the time to draw special attention? &mdash; Nothing
out of the ordinary.</p>

  <p>I suppose you have seen many passengers more nervous? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; When he spelt the name "Sando," and added that he
was not "Sandow," did he say the strong man? &mdash; "Not the strong man."</p>

  <p>Did he make that remark in an easy, jocular way, or was it simply to
guide you in the spelling, seriously said? &mdash; A jocular way.</p>

  <p>Did he laugh at it? &mdash; Just a smile, merely "Otto Sando, not Sandow,
the strong man," with a smile.</p>

  <p>Did you notice what kind of clothes he had on? &mdash; Well, it is rather
a hard question to answer; I have so many people coming in, but, to the best of
my knowledge, he had a soft hat on and a blue overcoat, either a blue serge or
vicuna overcoat; I could not just specify myself.</p>

  <p>Was the soft hat dark or light? &mdash; To the best of my knowledge it
was a dark one; of course, I had quite a number of passengers, ladies and
gentlemen, afterwards.</p>

  <p>That day, Saturday, the 26th, interviewing you or you interviewing them,
could you give an idea how many you would have &mdash; 100 in the course of the
day? &mdash; Oh, yes! more than that. With that particular steamer I had
somewhere about 200 people.</p>

  <p>But you identify him now quite easily? &mdash; Quite easily and
distinctly.</p>

  <p>Is that from his general appearance, or did you notice any peculiarity
about him that struck you? &mdash; No, nothing peculiar; I have a very good
memory for faces.</p>

  <p>When he referred to agents, just tell me to the best of your recollection
what he said. &mdash; When he came and asked for the accommodation I offered
him E76 or E77, whichever room it would be, and he said, "No, I will not take
that; it was offered me in Glasgow."</p>

  <p>He said in Glasgow? &mdash; In Glasgow.</p>

  <p>And did he also refer to agents? &mdash; "Your agents in Glasgow," and
kind of withdrew it.</p>

  <p>And when you say he apparently wanted to withdraw that, do you mean he
did not want to pursue that or seemed to regret having said that? &mdash; Well,
it seemed to me that he was rather sorry he had made the remark.</p><br>

  <p>ALLAN M'LEAN, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a cycle dealer
in Glasgow. I am a member of a club called the Sloper Club. The club-house is
at 24 India Street, Glasgow,</p>

  <p>Was there a man named Oscar Slater a member of the club in December last?
&mdash; Well, I cannot say whether he was a member or not, but I have seen him
in the club often.</p>

  <p>Could you describe the man to us? &mdash; Yes. He is about 5 feet 8 or 5
feet 9, of sallow complexion, pointed jaws, and I think he was clean shaved the
last time I saw him, or he had a very small growth on his moustache. He wore a
dark suit and a fawn overcoat &mdash; a rainproof coat, I think it was &mdash;
and a dark cap. I noticed a peculiarity about his nose; he had a twisted nose
&mdash; a twisted or broken nose. (Shown prisoner.) That is the man. I
recollect the night of Miss Gilchrist's murder. I never saw Oscar Slater in the
Sloper Club after that night. He had been there pretty regularly before it.</p>

  <p>Could you give us an idea how often he would be in the club during the
preceding fortnight; I mean in the fortnight before you heard of the murder?
&mdash; Well, he may have been every second or third night. On the 25th of
December &mdash; Christmas Day &mdash; I went to the Central Police Office and
gave certain information to the authorities.</p>

  <p>What led you to do that? &mdash; Well, a friend of mine had been offered
a pawn ticket of a diamond brooch, and when I saw in the papers about the
murder I thought that the brooch corresponded with the one for which the ticket
had been offered for sale, and it had been offered by Oscar Slater to a friend
of mine. I read the description in the paper. When I saw the description in the
paper I thought he was the man, and that is the reason I went and informed
about him. I undertook to show the detectives where Oscar Slater lived. I
accompanied Detective Inspector Powell to the house.</p>

  <p>How did you know where he lived? &mdash; I had seen him &mdash; I cannot
remember whether it was the morning before the murder or two mornings before
the murder &mdash; but we came up from the club and he walked in front of us,
and I saw him go up that close, and I thought he stayed there when he went up
that close. When I say in the morning, it would be between one and three
o'clock in the morning. I never spoke to the man. I never knew him under any
other name than Oscar Slater.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I suppose this murder attracted a
great deal of interest and notice in the club? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me when it was that you heard that a man whom you thought
corresponded with Oscar Slater, according to the description, was offering a
diamond brooch? &mdash; It was on the Monday of the murder.</p>

  <p>On the Monday of the murder a diamond brooch was offered to a friend of
yours called Anderson by Slater? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And did you later in the week notice that a diamond brooch of the same
kind of description was missing from Miss Gilchrist's house? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you put two and two together and thought that very probably that
might be the brooch? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Then, I suppose, taken along with that, was the fact that the man was
described as having a sallow complexion &mdash; was it a sallow complexion?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And that he had not been in the club since you had seen him the previous
Sunday; was that what brought suspicion into your mind and led you to go to the
police? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You found out afterwards that the brooch that had been pawned had really
nothing to do with Miss Gilchrist? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You knew Slater quite well by sight? &mdash; Yes, I knew him by sight.</p>

  <p>How often had you been in his company in the club? &mdash; Well, I had
never been in his company in the club, but I had seen him there often.</p>

  <p>What do they do to amuse themselves in your club? &mdash; Well, sometimes
we play at cards and have concerts.</p>

  <p>Was the purpose of your going to the club so late as that generally to
play cards? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you have seen Slater playing cards? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You do not know whether he was a member of the club or not? &mdash; I do
not know.</p>

  <p>Did you not ever yourself walk home with Slater and Anderson? &mdash;
No,</p>

  <p>I think you have walked home in the company of Slater before now? &mdash;
No&mdash;well, he has been walking in front of Anderson and me; that is the
only time, but he never walked alongside me.</p>

  <p>And you and he and Anderson have gone home together, walking along the
street together? &mdash; Well, he has walked in front of me.</p>

  <p>Were the three of you together, you and Slater and Anderson? &mdash;
There was Slater and some other party that morning walking in front of Anderson
and me, perhaps about 10 yards in front of us.</p>

  <p>Had you all left the club together? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Had you all been playing cards together? &mdash; I do not know whether we
had been playing cards that night or not.</p>

  <p>Try and remember; would you not be playing cards? &mdash; Well, we did
play probably every night.</p>

  <p>Tell me this &mdash; this is no idle curiosity &mdash; what was the game
of cards you did play? &mdash; A game called "muckie."</p>

  <p>It is not played by partners, but each man for himself? &mdash; It is
played by partners.</p>

  <p>Is it a game for four, or what is it? &mdash; Any number can play.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Was he one of the partners? &mdash; No, he was
playing at "poker" that night.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; Did he lose money that night? &mdash;
Well, I really cannot say.</p>

  <p>Can you not remember; I am wanting you to remember? &mdash; Well, you
know, the poker room is off the other rooms; there are different rooms laid off
in the club, so that I was in another room altogether.</p>

  <p>And you do not know whether he lost money or not? &mdash; I do not know;
I have seen him lose money.</p>

  <p>You went down about 11th March, or was it in February you went, to
identify him when he came from America? &mdash; I think it must have been
March; I cannot really say.</p>

  <p>You had no trouble whatever in recognising him as Oscar Slater, whom you
had known at the club? &mdash; None whatever.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; You know the murder was on Monday, 21st of December?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How long before that had you seen Slater in the Sloper Club, to the best
of your recollection? &mdash; Well, I think it would be three or four weeks
before that that I had known him.</p>

  <p>What was the last time before that that you had seen him? &mdash; I saw
him either on the Sunday morning or the Monday morning previous to the
murder.</p>

  <p>Do you mean the same morning as the murder and the Sunday, the day before
the murder? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What hour is it open on Sundays and other days; when does it open in the
morning? &mdash; I could not really say.</p>

  <p>The club is open on Sundays? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>A member can get in at any time? &mdash; You can get in at any time.</p>

  <p>Did you know what Slater did &mdash; what his business was? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you know whether he had any business? &mdash; No.</p><br>

  <p>MARGARET FOWLIS &mdash; Examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I live at
69 St. George's Road, Glasgow, on the top flat. I recollect in November last of
a house on the flat immediately below us being taken. I observed a name-plate
being put on the door of the house with the name Anderson. I saw a servant maid
at night going out and in, and various men went out and in at all times. I saw
one lady besides the servant maid. I never spoke to her. I once passed the man
Anderson on the stair. I would recognise him. (Shown prisoner.) That is the man
I passed on the stair. I do not know whether he carried on any business or not;
I did not know anything about him. I recollect on Friday, 25th December last,
two men called for luggage. My sister opened the door to them. We said we had
no luggage to go. They handed a paper with Anderson on it, and we said that the
house was downstairs. We stood looking over the stair when the porters went
away, and we saw boxes being taken downstairs. Mr. Anderson was throwing them
out of the house and getting the men to carry them downstairs. That was the man
that I had passed on the stair, but he had no moustache then. The time was
between half-past eight and twenty minutes to nine at night. He had black
trousers and vest, and was in his shirt sleeves. He had a blue overcoat, and a
hat, and patent boots, or what looked like patent boots. He had a long blue
overcoat with a velvet collar. He did not leave the house in a cab; he walked,
and he was followed by two ladies, one of whom was the servant. That was the
last I saw of them. I was taken to the Central Police Office on 22nd February
last, and I there identified Anderson amongst a number of other men. The
prisoner is the man that I identified.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Was it about the beginning of
December that you saw him first? &mdash; No; it would be about the middle of
December.</p>

  <p>You met him on the stair at that time? &mdash; Yes; I passed him.</p>

  <p>Had he a moustache? &mdash; I think so.</p>

  <p>Now, then, the next time you saw him was the time he was going away on
Christmas Day? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>I wish to ask you now, and to seriously consider this question. Had he a
moustache then? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Had you an opportunity of observing? &mdash; Yes, because he came out,
and he looked up. My sister and I and a man were standing talking, and he came
and looked up.</p>

  <p>I am putting this question with a definite intention, and I hope you will
give it a deliberate answer, as we have had some evidence about this. Is it the
case that at that time he had a three weeks' growth of black hair or a
noticeable moustache to any one who looked at that time, on 25th December?
&mdash; I said he had no moustache.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Was his upper lip clean shaven? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; And you had a good opportunity of
seeing that? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How far would they be in your sight? &mdash; Just a few minutes, till he
went round Charing Cross.</p>

  <p>Where is the nearest cab stand to your house? &mdash; In North Street, in
the direction they were going.</p>

  <p>Did the porters take the luggage down in a barrow? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether the servant was in the house the same night and
handed over possession of the house to two women who came next morning? &mdash;
I do not know. Two women took possession, but I did not see them.</p>

  <p>And they lived on there for some time? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>I suppose at that time the house would be under the constant supervision
of the police? &mdash; It was.</p><br>

  <p>ISABELLA FOWLIS, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I live at 69 St.
George's Road, Glasgow. I am a sister of the last witness.</p>

  <p class="c">(This witness corroborated the evidence of the previous
witness.)</p><br>

  <p>RUBY RUSSELL, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am twenty-two years of
age. I am a domestic servant with Mrs. Bernstein at 69 St. George's Road,
Glasgow. I remember the house on the flat immediately above our one, which had
been empty for some time, being tenanted in the month of November last. After
the tenants came there was a plate put on the door with the name Anderson.
Prior to Christmas Day I had on two occasions seen the man who lived there.
When I saw him before Christmas he had a moustache on. I identify the prisoner
as the gentleman. He was always dressed in dark clothes, but I could not say
whether it was the same suit that he had on. I remember a detective calling at
our house and making inquiries about seven o'clock or 7.30 on Christmas Day. My
attention was attracted by something on the stair shortly after that, two men
taking luggage downstairs from Anderson's house. Anderson was dressed in dark
clothes that night. There was a woman standing on the other side of the street.
I was standing at the window, and I saw the prisoner going across to the lady,
and then they walked away together. They walked a few yards and then separated,
and he went away himself.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; What do you suggest was their
object in separating? &mdash; I think they saw me, and did not want to go away
together.</p>

  <p>Did you know Slater personally? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did Mrs. Bernstein have any dealings with Slater? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was there any communication at any time between Mrs. Bernstein and her
household and Slater and his household? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Do you happen to know that a detective called on Mrs. Bernstein? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>How long was that before Slater left? &mdash; About half an hour.</p>

  <p>Do you suggest that Slater left because the detective had called at Mrs.
Bernstein's &mdash; I thought it was very funny.</p>

  <p>His visit to Mrs. Bernstein had never been communicated at any time to
Slater or his household? &mdash; Not that I know of.</p>

  <p>How many boxes and bags went away upon the barrow? &mdash; I saw one
large trunk.</p>

  <p>Were there not nine packages taken away by the porter? &mdash; I never
saw nine packages.</p>

  <p>Do you suggest that Slater did all his packing in the half-hour which
intervened between the visit of the detective to Mrs. Bernstein and his leaving
the house? &mdash; I do not say that.</p>

  <p>Would you kindly explain if you can what it is that connects in your mind
the departure of Slater from this house with the visit of a detective to Mrs.
Bernstein which had not been communicated to Slater by Mrs. Bernstein? Did you
just think it funny? &mdash; I thought it very funny, going away so
quickly.</p><br>

  <p>JOHN CAMERON, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a city porter in
Glasgow, stationed at the Central Station. On the evening of Christmas last,
25th December, I was at the Central Station, in Gordon Street, Glasgow, with my
barrow. Between six and seven o'clock a man called and asked me to go on a job.
He wanted me to go to 69 St. George's Road and lift some luggage and take it to
the Central Station. He told me that the name was Anderson. I had never seen
the man before. He told me to be at the house at the back of eight o'clock. I
went there and found the house three stairs up. By mistake I went to the top
flat, and then I came down when I found my mistake. I found at the house the
man that had engaged me, and I think there were two women in the house. The man
gave me the luggage and told me to carry it downstairs. There was another
porter, Mackay, with me to give me a hand. There were ten pieces altogether,
composed of trunks, portmanteaus, and a parcel. Mackay and I took them to the
Central Station. The man let me out of the close, and said that he would go in
the car and meet me at the station. I did not see how he went down. He was
waiting on me when I got down to the station. I could not say whether the women
were with him; I would not swear to that. I saw one at a fruiterer's store at
St. George's Road, but I do not think I saw her after that. I am not quite sure
whether I saw her at the station. I am not sure whether the man that ordered me
to do this work was clean shaved. I would know him again if I saw him. I
recognise the prisoner as the man that engaged me to remove his luggage. I did
not wait to see him enter the train. As soon as he paid me I came right
away.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Did you hear him telling the porter
to label his luggage? &mdash; I heard him giving the porters instructions, but
I am not sure where he told them to label the luggage to.</p>

  <p>Have you not got an idea? &mdash; I think it was Liverpool, but I would
not swear to it.</p>

  <p>Before leaving, did you not see the two women at the station? &mdash; I
saw one, but I would not swear to two. I saw them up at the train along with
the prisoner.</p>

  <p>Did you put the luggage into the train? &mdash; I backed the barrow up,
and the porter took the luggage off and gave me a hand.</p>

  <p>What van did you put it into? &mdash; I think it was a back van.</p>

  <p>Do you remember if it was a van in a composite carriage which was through
for Liverpool? &mdash; I am not sure.</p>

  <p>Would you recognise any of the baggage if I showed it to you &mdash; Yes,
I think so.</p>

  <p>Is that box that I show you one of the baggage? &mdash; I think so.</p>

  <p>Do you see the label there, "Lime Street, Liverpool, from Glasgow
Central"? &mdash; Yes; but I never paid any particular notice.</p>

  <p>When was it that you got your orders from the man to be up at his house
in order to take away the baggage? &mdash; Between six and seven o'clock, at
the Central Station, as far as I can remember.</p>

  <p>Were you informed at the time what train you were to take the luggage to?
&mdash; Yes; the 9.5 train.</p>

  <p>When you got orders to remove the luggage, did the gentleman help you in
any way to put the luggage on to your barrow? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did he hand the luggage out to you? &mdash; Yes, from the house. He told
us to carry the luggage down the stair, and we did so, and put it on the
barrow.</p>

  <p>Did you go into the house and get it yourself and carry it down? &mdash;
Yes, as he instructed me to do.</p>

  <p>Did the gentleman seem in any way excited? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>He did not seem to be in any special hurry? &mdash; No, not to my
knowledge.</p>

  <p>Do you remember whether he said anything about your being late for the
train? &mdash; I remember him saying, "You will have to hurry up, or you may be
late."</p>

  <p>Did you see anything in this man's demeanour or behaviour that night to
suggest to you that he was more in a hurry than any other person to catch a
train? &mdash; No; not at all.</p><br>

  <p>JOHN BROWN, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am booking clerk at
the Central Railway Station, Glasgow. I was on duty there on the evening of
25th December last. There is a train leaves the Central Station at 9.5 p.m. for
London, Liverpool, Birmingham, and Preston. There is not usually a through
carriage for Liverpool on that train. I understand there was a through carriage
for Liverpool on the 25th of December last. Usually passengers change carriages
at Preston or Wigan. A single ticket from Glasgow to London is available to go
via Liverpool. You stop at Liverpool and then prosecute your journey
afterwards. I recollect what tickets were taken out for that train, the 9.5, on
the evening of 25th December; I have them before me here. There were
comparatively few people travelling by that train that night, being Christmas
night. I have in my hand a scroll balance book. I keep it myself &mdash; the
booking-office clerk. It is taken after each issue for the train. I made it up
immediately after the train departed. Amongst the tickets which I issued for
that train were two singles Liverpool, third-class, and two third singles to
London. I recollect it was a man who bought the two single thirds to London. I
saw him at the window of the booking office. I recollect selling him the two
tickets.</p>

  <p>Do you think you would know the man again if you saw him? &mdash; Well, I
might give my recollection. (Shown prisoner.) That is very like the man, but on
oath I could not swear to it. I did not observe any one with him. My
recollection is that the two thirds for Liverpool were issued to separate
parties &mdash; issued separately.</p>

  <p>One man bought one ticket? &mdash; Either a man or lady; I cannot
remember. I was not very busy that night, nothing extra.</p>

  <p>Had you time to observe the man who bought the two London tickets?
&mdash; Well, just a passing glance, as it were. I have no recollection of what
money he offered. With a single third for London you can travel by Liverpool
and break your journey there. If you did so you could retain the ticket.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; So far as the book goes, the
entries just show Liverpool two third-class, &pound;1 10s? &mdash; That is
so.</p>

  <p>London two third-class, &pound;3 6s? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>Do you remember to whom you issued the Liverpool tickets? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>May you have issued the Liverpool tickets to a man? &mdash; I may have.</p>

  <p>Is there any way of finding out whether London tickets are collected at
Liverpool? &mdash; They might be; of course, they do not collect them if they
are going on to London.</p>

  <p>Suppose a person with a London ticket was going to change his journey and
going to Liverpool, he would give up the London tickets at Liverpool? &mdash;
Not necessarily.</p>

  <p>What would happen with them? &mdash; He could break his journey at
Liverpool and proceed on with them within ten days.</p>

  <p>Would they be shipped at Liverpool? &mdash; Quite likely they would be.</p>

  <p>Suppose a person has got tickets for London, and he changes his journey
at Liverpool upon the London ticket, what happens as regards the ticket when he
arrives at Liverpool? &mdash; I really cannot tell you that; the tickets would
be checked at the collecting station for Liverpool, and the passenger would be
allowed to retain them.</p>

  <p>And if the person went to America without ever going on to London, would
it not be quite possible to find out from the numbers at the Clearing-house
that these two tickets had disappeared? &mdash; I cannot say as to that.</p>

  <p>If the tickets with the numbers on them did not turn up at the Clearing-
house, it would be known there that two tickets of a certain number had been
issued and they had never come back? &mdash; I should think it would.</p>

  <p>Has any inquiry been made, as far as you know, to find out whether the
two tickets issued for London have disappeared altogether or not? &mdash; Not
that I know of.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether the two tickets for Liverpool issued that night were
collected in due course at Liverpool? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>When was it that you were asked, to begin with, about the issue of
tickets on the 25th? &mdash; On the night after.</p>

  <p>At your place are tickets issued for anything except the English train?
&mdash; Just the English train.</p>

  <p>And I understand your evidence, then, to be this, that you have a
recollection that a man &mdash; had he a moustache? &mdash; Slight.</p>

  <p>With a slight moustache took the two tickets for London; is that so?
&mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>And you think on your recollection that he was like this man here?
&mdash; Very like the man.</p>

  <p>Who took the tickets for Liverpool, whether a man or a woman, whether a
person with a moustache or not, you cannot possibly tell? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me this: in ordinary course, I suppose the tickets would be
checked before the train started, when the people had taken their seats?
&mdash; They usually are.</p>

  <p>And if a man was sitting in a through carriage for Liverpool with a
London ticket, I suppose the ticket collector would speak to him about it?
&mdash; Perhaps not; he might.</p>

  <p>Do you think a man would be allowed to sit in a Liverpool carriage with a
London ticket and not be given a hint to change? &mdash; He might be.</p>

  <p>Suppose a person were wanting to go to Liverpool, this, of course, would
be the only train he could go in that night? &mdash; There is one at ten
minutes to six.</p>

  <p>I mean there is no later train? &mdash; Not after that.</p>

  <p>And there is not another one till ten o'clock next morning? &mdash; That
is so &mdash; 10.10.</p>

  <p>Would the 10.10 train in the morning take a person in time for the
sailing of the "Lusitania" at four in the afternoon? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I suppose, if a man broke his
journey at Liverpool and retained his ticket he could hand it over or sell it
to somebody else? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>And so it would be used? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>You know that is sometimes done? &mdash; I understand so.</p>

  <p>But is it a perfectly regular practice to travel from Glasgow to London
with a London ticket and break your journey at Liverpool? &mdash; Yes.</p><br>

  <p>JOHN MILLICAN, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a detective
constable in the Central District of Glasgow. By instructions of Superintendent
Ord, I, on the 25th December last, accompanied by Detective Sergeant Lyon and
Detective Inspector Powell, went to the house at 69 St. George's Road about
twelve o'clock at night. We went there to see who was the resident there
&mdash; for a Mr. Oscar. I heard the name Anderson given; I saw the name
Anderson on the door. We rang. The door was opened by a maid &mdash; a German.
We asked for Mr. Oscar. She said, "No man here." We asked who lived there, and
she said, "No one but Madame." We asked where Madame was, and she said that
Madame was away for a short holiday. We then asked to go inside the house, and
she allowed us to go into the house. We went into the house and looked all
round, and there were a lot of papers lying in the front bedroom, and amongst
the papers I picked up a piece of paper. We did not search the house minutely;
we just looked round the house. We went into all the rooms. We found nothing in
the way of baggage.</p>

  <p>Could you tell from the appearance of the house that baggage had been
taken away? &mdash; By the appearance of papers lying about, as if things had
been packed. We did not find any dentist's instruments in the house or see any.
I did not see any appearance of a dentist's business having been carried on
there. The servant said that no man lived there. (Shown production No. 28.)
That is the piece of paper I picked up. The following is on it: &mdash;
"Registered fragile, with care &mdash; fee paid &mdash; Oscar Slater, Esq., c/o
A. Anderson, Esq., 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow. Dent &mdash; R., London, W.C,
1, No. 1292." I examined the other papers on the floor and found nothing of any
importance amongst any of them. On finding that paper with the address on it, I
pointed it out to the servant girl who was there, and asked her what about the
man. She said. "That is a friend of Madame's; he is away with Madame for a
short holiday." I asked her if she knew where he had gone. She did not know. I
looked through the other four rooms and kitchen, and found nothing in any of
them. From the people below I learned that a man Anderson had disappeared that
night shortly after eight o'clock, and that a woman had gone with him; he was
joined by a woman on the opposite side of the street.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Who gave you that information?
&mdash; The servant of White, two stairs up.</p>

  <p>What is the name of this servant of the Whites? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>She is not here as a witness? &mdash; Not that I am aware of.</p>

  <p>When you went into the place to begin with, did you explain to the
servant, who was alone in the house, that you were detectives? &mdash; We
did.</p>

  <p>And that was twelve o'clock at night? &mdash; It was.</p>

  <p>Did you explain any special mission? &mdash; We did not; we only wanted
to see Mr. Oscar.</p>

  <p>Did you not know his name was Slater? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>"Who gave you the information that his name was Oscar? &mdash; I got the
information from Detective Inspector Powell.</p>

  <p>And he did not call him Oscar Slater, but Mr. Oscar? &mdash; Just Mr.
Oscar.</p>

  <p>Then you went into the place and looked through the room? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you notice that the paper from Dent's address to Oscar Slater, c/o
Anderson, 69 St. George's Road, was dated 23rd December, 1908? &mdash; Yes, I
read the date.</p>

  <p>And it showed that it came from Dent's, in London? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Does the servant speak English well? &mdash; Well, broken English.</p><br>

  <p>DAVID LYON, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am a detective
officer in the Central District, Glasgow.</p>

  <p class="c">(This witness corroborated the evidence of the previous
witness.)</p><br>

  <p>REGINALD GEORGE TUCKETT, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am chief
assistant to Messrs. Dent, watchmakers, 34 Cockspur Street, London. I know a
man named Oscar Slater, and we had some dealings with him. Our first
transaction with him was on 24th November, 1905, in connection with the repair
of a watch. He was then in London. Our second transaction was on 25th August,
1908. So far as I remember, he handed me the watch at that time; I will not be
positive about that. He gave the address of &yen;o. 36 Albemarle Street,
Piccadilly. He paid me for the repairs of the watch on 21st October, 1908. I do
not recollect of him calling at our shop on 10th December last; I do not think
he called in person. As far as I remember, the watch was sent on that date. I
received the letter, dated 9th December, addressed 69 St. George's Road, c/o
Anderson &mdash; "Enclosed you will find my watch you delivered at 36 Albemarle
Street. The watch is 15 minutes or 20 minutes fast. Kindly put the watch in
order and return same to this address till 30th December." On 21st December I
received the telegram No. 36/2, "Dent, watchmaker, Trafalgar Square, London. If
possible please send watch at once, Oscar Slater." The watch was still in our
keeping. I received that telegram on the same day on which it was despatched.
At that time we closed at seven o'clock in the evening. On 23rd December I
received a subsequent telegram, addressed 34 Cockspur Street, London. "Must
have watch, leaving to-morrow night for the Continent. Oscar Slater, c/o A.
Anderson, 69 St. George's Road." The previous telegram was signed "Oscar
Slater." I sent the watch, I think on the 23rd, but I will not be positive
about that. It was sent to the address given. That was the last transaction
that I had with Slater, and I have not heard of him since. (Shown production
No. 28.) That is the label upon the watch which I returned. It is addressed in
my handwriting. To the best of my belief Oscar Slater is the prisoner; I think
I have waited on him.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Did he stop in London at the time
of the previous transaction with you while he was there? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>On 9th December, as is shown by the letter signed Oscar Slater, No. 69
St. George's Road, Glasgow, did he send you a watch for repair? &mdash; No, it
was sent to us while he was in London. We received the watch from Albemarle
Street.</p>

  <p>I show you No. 36. Are you not wrong in saying what you have said?
&mdash; I may be wrong; my impression was that it was left by hand. In any case
I received it, and my statement was to the effect that the watch had received a
blow or fall.</p>

  <p>Did you receive the letter dated 9th December, which says, "Enclosed you
will find my watch you have delivered to 36 Albemarle Street, London"? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Is that dated from 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And one would think that the watch was enclosed along with it? &mdash;
Yes. My impression was that it was left by hand, but about that I will not be
sure.</p>

  <p>Was the same watch twice with you? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>May it not have been that the first time it arrived it was handed in by
hand, and the second time that it came in a package along with that letter?
&mdash; That may be.</p>

  <p>Was there enclosed also a card? &mdash; That may have been enclosed.</p>

  <p>Was that not enclosed with the letter? &mdash; It may have been.</p>

  <p>"Address till 30th December, 69 St. George's Road, c/o A. Anderson,
Glasgow "? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Does that card in front of you have on the face of it "Oscar Slater,
dentist, 36 Albemarle Street, W., Telephone 1624 Mayfair"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And on the back is there written "Address till 30th December, 68 St.
George's Road, c/o A. Anderson, Glasgow"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you remember receiving that? &mdash; It was with the letter of 9th
December.</p>

  <p>And that was an intimation to you that the address, 69 St. George's Road,
was good till 30th December? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You apparently have had this watch in your possession for repairs from
9th December right up to the 21st? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>There is a telegram there to "Dent, watchmaker. If possible send watch at
once"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you see from the telegram that it was handed in in Glasgow at 6.12 at
the Central Station? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Apparently the watch had not arrived by the 23rd. Did you, on the 23rd,
receive another telegram, "Dent, 34 Cockspur Street, London. Must have watch,
leaving to-morrow night for Continent. Oscar Slater"? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>All your communications were with him under the name of Oscar Slater
7&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And he put "c/o Anderson" when he went to Glasgow? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you see the last telegram of 23rd December, handed in at Charing
Cross, Glasgow, one minute past twelve? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And it was sent off at 12.7 and it arrived in London at 12.44? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>It was in answer to that telegram that you sent off the parcel which was
in the wrapper No. 28? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And it contained the watch? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>I suppose when you got notice by the second telegram that they were
leaving to-morrow night for the Continent that hurried you up? &mdash; Yes, it
hurried us up considerably.</p>

  <p>You had thought that they were to be there for a week longer? &mdash;
Yes, our intention was to send it off after Christmas.</p><br>

  <p>MARIAN CARSON, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am twenty-four years of
age. I am a telegraphist in the employment of the Caledonian Railway at the
Central Station Telegraph Office, Glasgow. I was on duty on 21st December till
6.37. (Shown production No. 36, addressed "Dent, watchmakers.") I can tell from
the marking of the code time on the telegram when I received that. I took it
in. It was handed in at 6.12, and it would be sent into the tube and sent to
the Post Office at once. I cannot tell whether it was handed in by a man or a
woman; I do not remember anything about it.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Is it signed "Oscar Slater"?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>(Shown prisoner.) Is that the man? &mdash; I do not remember him.</p>

  <p>MARY ANDERSON M'MURDO, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am a sorting
clerk and telegraphist at Charing Cross Branch Post Office. (Shown production
No. 36, addressed "Dent, 34 Cockspur Street, London," and signed "Oscar Slater,
69 St. George's Road, c/o Anderson.") That telegram was handed in at my branch
on 23rd December. It says, "Must have watch, leaving to-morrow night for the
Continent. Oscar Slater." That was handed in at my branch post office at one
minute past twelve on 23rd December. The message was despatched at 12.7. That
was two days before Christmas, and we must have been specially busy that day. I
cannot recollect whether it was a man or woman who handed in that telegram to
me; I have no recollection who handed it in.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr, M'CLURE &mdash; Look at the prisoner &mdash; was
that the man? &mdash; I could not say.</p><br>

  <p>FREDERICA CAROLINA LANG, examined by Mr. MORISON&mdash;I am a sorting clerk
and telegraphist in the General Post Office, Glasgow. Prior to November last I
was acting in the same capacity in the Hope Street Branch Post Office, and
after leaving it I was temporarily employed on 23rd, 24th, and 25th December.
While in the Hope Street Post Office it was part of my duty to keep the book
called the Counter Register Letter Book. I have examined the letter book of
24th December, and on that date I find a registered letter or packet. No. 421,
sent off to an address in Germany &mdash; the address being, Adolf Leschzinger,
5 Klukowitzer Strasse, Bentham O/Sohl*, Germany. I cannot recollect whether I
saw the person who handed it in.</p>

  <p class="footnote">[<i>Sic</i>. Should evidently be "Beuthen, O/Schl,"
where "O/Schl" stands for Oberschlesien (Upper Silesia). Former name of the
then German and now Polish town called Bytom. ]</p>

  <p>Have you seen the prisoner before as far as you know? &mdash; I think I
have seen him before.</p>

  <p>Where at? &mdash; I could not say.</p>

  <p>But can you say whether it was in your branch post office on the 24th or
not? &mdash; I could not say.</p>

  <p>Can you say whether he was there on 22nd or 23rd? &mdash; I could not
say.</p>

  <p>Do you just remember the face? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; You saw the prisoner in Duke
Street? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is it from that recollection that you think that you have seen him?
&mdash; No, I think I have seen him before.</p>

  <p>But you cannot recollect whether he sent the package to Germany? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>Was it a registered letter? &mdash; It was either a letter or a packet.
Each one has the same entry.</p><br>

  <p>WILLIAM GORDON, examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; I am a detective
lieutenant in the Central District of the Glasgow police. I called at the house
69 George's Road on 26th December, 1908, in order to make inquiry at the
accused's house. I saw a person who said that she was the maid there, and she
told me that they were away to London. I asked for Anderson, because the name
was on the plate on the door. I called again on Monday, 28th, and Tuesday, 29th
December, to see if any letters had come for Anderson. There were no letters. I
learned on the 7th of January that the two women who occupied the house were
going to London. I did not see the maid then; she was away. She went to London
on the night I called, on the 26th.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; How do you know that? &mdash; She told me that she
was going to London.</p>

  <p>Did she say whether she was to join them? &mdash; No; she said that she
was going to 72 Charlotte Street, London, that night, care of a Mr.
Sancroft.</p>

  <p>Examination continued &mdash; The maid told me that Madame and Anderson
had left the night before for London. I made inquiries as to the movements of
Anderson on the Monday night, and she told me that he was in at seven o'clock
at dinner, but that she did not know anything further about his movements after
that. I called afterwards on 7th January. (Shown production No. 27.) I was
handed that letter on 7th January. The envelope is addressed, "Oscar Slater,
c/o Mr. Anderson, 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow, Scotland, Eng." There is also
an intimation, "If not delivered, return to D. R. Jacobs, 326 Third Avenue, New
York, U.S." The letter bears the American postmark, and appears to have been
posted at Madison Square, at New York, on 29th December. The letter itself is
dated 28th December.</p>

  <p>Do you know when the two women actually left the house? &mdash; It was
reported to me that they left on the 8th of January. They told me on the night
of the 7th that they were leaving on the 8th.</p>

  <p>When did these two women arrive in Glasgow? &mdash; They told me that
they would arrive here about the 24th of December. I did not see them until the
26th, a Saturday.</p>

  <p>Did you see them in the flat that had been occupied by Slater when you
called on the 26th? &mdash; I did.</p>

  <p>Did you find that the keys of the flat had been handed over by Slater's
servant to them? &mdash; She told me so..</p>

  <p>And did she inform you that these people were taking up the occupancy of
the house? &mdash; No. The maid did not tell me, but they themselves told me
so.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me when these two women came to Glasgow? &mdash; They told
me that they had come two days previously.</p>

  <p>Do you know where they had been between times? &mdash; In the Alexandra
Hotel, in Bath Street.</p>

  <p>Did you make inquiry? &mdash; No, I did not.</p>

  <p>Where did you get the letter dated 7th January? &mdash; I got it from
Mrs. Freedman.</p>

  <p>Did she say that she had come from London? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And was to continue the occupancy of the flat after the letter had gone?
&mdash; She said that it was arranged between Slater and her that she should do
so.</p>

  <p>Was it not between Slater and Mr. Freedman, in London? &mdash; No; it was
between Slater and her. The words she said were that they were away to Monte
Carlo.</p>

  <p>Who were away? &mdash; Madame and Mr. Anderson. She called the lady
Madame. She said that they were away to Monte Carlo, and that he had asked if
they had any money and wanted a loan of &pound;25.</p>

  <p>Who wanted it? &mdash; Mr. Anderson. He asked it from Mrs. Freedman.</p>

  <p>Do you understand that the story was that they had gone off to London and
then to Monte Carlo? &mdash; It was the maid's story that they had gone to
London, and Mrs. Freedman's story was that they had gone to Monte Carlo.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I show you the envelope No. 27; you
were asked about something that appears on the envelope at the foot of page 17
&mdash; "If not delivered, return to D. R. Jacobs, 326 Third Avenue, New York,
U.S.," and it is headed "Scotland, Eng."? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>The words, "If not delivered, return to D. R. Jacobs, 326 Third Avenue,
New York, U.S.," are not in any printed form, but written in ink? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Apparently by the person who wrote the letter? &mdash; It looks very much
like it.</p>

  <p>Would not that suggest to you as a detective that the person who sent off
the letter had in his mind that perhaps the addressee would be away from the
address at the time the letter had arrived? &mdash; There was no indication on
the letter to that effect.</p>

  <p>For what purpose would he write on the envelope, in his own handwriting,
"If not delivered, return to D. R. Jacobs," unless he thought that there was a
probability of the man being away at the time the letter arrived there? &mdash;
There might have been a change of address.</p>

  <p>He might be away from there? &mdash; Yes, supposing he was still in
Glasgow.</p>

  <p>There is another thing I call your attention to. From the terms of the
letter itself, is it quite plain that Mr. Jacobs, who wrote the letter to the
accused, was expecting to be shortly over in America, as he says, "Buy all you
can when you come over"? &mdash; Yes, there is something there about that.</p>

  <p>Putting these two together, does that seem a fair inference that he wrote
the letter to a man whom he expected was going over to America, and who might
not be at the address at the time the letter went there? &mdash; There is a
possibility that he might do it, but the other probability is just the same
that he might change his address from that house.</p>

  <p>But the words "come over" mean that he was going over to America, do they
not? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; When was it that Mrs. Freedman told
you this about Slater having gone to Monte Carlo? &mdash; On Saturday, 26th
December.</p>

  <p>Did she say when she had come to the address 69 St. George's Road?
&mdash; She had arrived that morning.</p>

  <p>You said something about &pound;25 which I did not quite catch. Did she
tell you that she had given Slater the loan of &pound;25, or that he had asked
the loan? &mdash; Mrs. Freedman told me that she had called the previous
evening at the flat and found Mr. Anderson, the accused, busy packing up his
luggage, and Madame, as she called her, was crying, and she had asked what was
up, or what was the matter, and then Anderson said that he had received</p>

  <p>Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; If Mrs. Freedman is not coming, this is not
relevant.</p>

  <p>LORD GUTHRIE &mdash; If you object, we cannot take anything.</p>

  <p>By Mr. MORISON &mdash; What about &pound;25? Did Mrs. Freedman tell you
that she had given the prisoner the &pound;25, or merely that the prisoner had
asked it? &mdash; Mrs. Freedman told me distinctly that she gave him
&pound;25.</p>

  <p>[The LORD ADVOCATE here proposed to recall the witness Lambie.</p>

  <p>Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; My lord, my friend is proposing to recall the girl
Helen Lambie, with whom we parted some two days ago. I do not know the purpose
of her being recalled at the present time, but I think it is quite enough for
me to say that she has been in Court since she was examined, and has heard
certain of the evidence, how much I do not know. I should suggest that this is
an absolute disqualification, although I am absolutely ignorant of the points
she is to be examined on.</p>

  <p>The LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; If my friend says she was in Court I cannot
contradict him.</p>

  <p>LORD GUTHRIE &mdash; She was in Court.</p>

  <p>The LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; My friend may be perfectly correct. I do not
propose to ask her a question about anything that has been said in the
evidence. I will put to my friend the few questions that I proposed to ask. If
he adheres to his objection, then I do not insist.</p>

  <p>Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I would rather not know anything about it, because it
would seem to be departing from the strict line I am entitled to take up, and I
do not wish to have anything like negotiation in a case of this kind.</p>

  <p>LORD GUTHRIE &mdash; If something had come out in cross-examination, it
is conceivable that occasion might have arisen for a witness to be recalled. It
would be a very unfortunate thing if the occasion did arise, but it might
arise.</p>

  <p>The LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Yes, it did arise out of one or two questions
put by my friend in cross-examination.</p>

  <p>LORD GUTHRIE &mdash; You do not insist on recalling the witness?</p>

  <p>The LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I am objecting in absolute ignorance of what the
questions were to be.]</p><br>

  <p>WILLIAM SANCROFT, examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I am employed by
the Glasgow Corporation in the Tramways Department. On 23rd December last I was
conductor on a car on the passage northwards at Union Street, about five
minutes past six on that evening. I remember one man in particular joining the
car at the end of Union Street next Argyle Street. He went upstairs in a hurry
and seated himself at the far end of the car. There was a boy reading the
<i>Citizen</i> on the opposite side of the standard, on the left hand side.
Near West George Street I went upstairs to collect the fares from the
passengers. I asked the man where he was going, and he mumbled something. He
had a penny in his left hand. I took it for granted that he wanted a penny
ticket, and I punched it. When standing at the standard, half-way covering his
seat, I asked the boy if there was any clue to the murderer, and he said, " No,
there is not any clue yet, and I don't think there is any likelihood of getting
one." All of a sudden this man who was sitting on the seat got up in a hurry
and passed by, pushing me to the side. He went downstairs in a hurry. I went
after him and tried to tap him on the shoulder, as I usually do to draw the
attention of passengers in case they have made a mistake. I was three steps
down when I saw the man running full speed across to Garscadden Street. That
was long before he had got his pennyworth or even a half-pennyworth. I spoke to
the motorman about what had happened, and I delayed the car about a minute or
so. I would most assuredly know the man again. I recognise the prisoner as the
man.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Did you think that night he was the
murderer? &mdash; No, I did not.</p>

  <p>That night, I suppose, you only thought this, that there was a dark-
complexioned man on the car who came on for a little while and left in a hurry,
before he got his penny's worth? &mdash; A dark-complexioned man resembling
very much the description given in the papers, I think, the night after the
murder.</p>

  <p>You did not think that this was the murderer that night? &mdash; Not at
the time he was on the car.</p>

  <p>He seemed to be in a hurry to join the car, and, later on, in a hurry to
leave the car? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is that the only thing you have got against him? &mdash; Another thing
was taking 1d. ticket and going off before the &frac12;d. station.</p>

  <p>I understand that you said that you did not know whether the man had
heard your remark to the boy? &mdash; I do not remember if I said so. I think I
said that when the remark was passed as to there being any clue of the
murderer, this man, according to my opinion, must have heard us.</p>

  <p>You said the car was not very well lighted where the man was sitting?
&mdash; It is not very well lighted in a December night.</p>

  <p>Who is the boy that was reading the paper? &mdash; I tried to trace that,
but I have not been able to get hold of him. I have been told that he has been
in some employment in the city, about St. Vincent Street, as a clerk, and has
been dismissed. He was a regular traveller at that time of the night. I have
not been able to get a hold of him. I have tried my best.</p><br>

  <p>The Clerk of Court then read the following declaration which had been
emitted by the prisoner:?</p>

  <p class="quote">At Glasgow, the twenty-fourth day of February, one thousand
nine hundred and nine, in presence of Arthur Thomson Glegg, Esquire, Advocate,
Sheriff-Substitute of Lanarkshire.&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">Compeared a prisoner, who had had a private interview with
a law agent prior to this examination, and the charge against him having been
read over and explained to him, and he having been judicially admonished and
examined, declares: My name is Oscar Slater. I am a native of Germany, married,
thirty-eight years of age, a dentist, and have no residence at present.</p>

  <p class="quote">I know nothing about the charge of having assaulted Marion
Gilchrist and murdering her. I am innocent. All which I declare to be truth.</p>

  <h2><a id="eviD" name="eviD">EVIDENCE FOR DEFENCE</a></h2>

  <p>JAMES DOW, examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I am in the accountant's
office in the Post Office, Edinburgh. I have been cited as a witness to speak
to a letter which was addressed to the Comptroller of the Post Office Savings
Bank, West Kensington, London. The letter is dated 20/11/08, Glasgow. The
letter is addressed from 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow, to the Comptroller of
the Post Office Savings Bank in London. It is dated the 20th of the eleventh
month of 1908, which apparently would be 20th November, but it arrived at its
destination in an envelope which has got the Glasgow postmark of 21st December,
1908, 5 p.m.</p>

  <p>That is 5 p.m. on the 21st December, about two hours before the murder?
&mdash; I do not know when the murder was. The letter is in these
terms:&mdash;</p>

  <p>Glasgow, 20th/l 1/1908,</p>

  <p>69 St. George's Road. Dear Sir, &mdash; Enclosed you will find my Savings
Bank book. Be kind enough to send me the money at once as I have an urgent call
to America because my wife is ill. If possible wire the money on and I will pay
all expenses here. &mdash; Yours truly,</p>

  <p>Adolph Anderson.</p>

  <p>In answer to that letter there was one addressed from the Post Office
Savings Bank, West Kensington, London, to Mr. A. Anderson. That was dated 22nd
December, 1908. The letter was in these terms&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">Post-Office Savings Bank,<br>
  West Kensington, London, W.,<br>
  22nd December, 1908.<br>
  <br>
  Sir, &mdash; I am directed by the Post-Master General to acknowledge receipt
of your Deposit Book, Investment Certificate, application, and letter of the
20th inst., and to inform you that steps are being taken to sell &pound;59 2s.
7d. 2&frac12; per cent. Consolidated Stock on your behalf, but the transaction
cannot be completed until to morrow. A warrant for the sum due in your Savings
Bank account is, however, enclosed, and instructions have been sent to the
Postmaster of Glasgow to pay the amount without production of the Deposit Book.
&mdash; I am, Sir,<br>
  <br>
  Your obedient Servant,<br>
  H. DAVIES, Controller</p>

  <div align="center"><img src="1202631h-images/OscarSlater11.jpg" title="Dining Room
(looking east)"></div><br>
  <hr>

  <p>Do you find that, following upon that, the 2&frac12; per cent. stock
which stood in the name of Slater was sold on his instructions, and the
proceeds given to him at the Glasgow Post Office on 24th December, 1908?
&mdash; In the name of A. Anderson, yes, that is so. He received &pound;49 7s.
2d. I find also that the balance remaining due in his Post Office Savings Bank
account, namely, &pound;39 18s. 3d., was paid to him on 23rd December.</p>

  <p>Take it from me that the murder of this lady was accomplished at seven
o'clock upon the 21st December, 1908. Were instructions given for the delivery
of the Savings Bank deposits and stock of Slater by the letter posted at 5 p.m.
on the 21st December, and therefore before the murder? &mdash; I should say
so.</p>

  <p>You take, I suppose, the post office stamp as conclusive of the date?
&mdash; Well, I am not conversant absolutely with the stamp, but I should say
it was.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Who is Adolf Anderson?
&mdash; I could not say &mdash; a depositor in the Post Office Savings Bank.</p>

  <p>Did you ever see him? &mdash; No, never to my knowledge.</p>

  <p>Do you know anything about him? &mdash; No, not at all.</p>

  <p>You mentioned the name Oscar Slater? &mdash; No, not I.</p>

  <p>I heard it mentioned in connection with the consolidated stock? &mdash;
"A. Anderson," I think I corrected; A. Anderson was the name the stock was
in.</p>

  <p>Did you ever hear the name Oscar Slater in connection with this person
Adolf Anderson? &mdash; No, not to my knowledge.</p>

  <p>Do you know when the bank account was opened? &mdash; Yes. On the 12th of
November, 1908.</p>

  <p>In London? &mdash; In Glasgow.</p>

  <p>And what is the designation of the person? &mdash; Dentist.</p>

  <p>And the address? &mdash; 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow.</p>

  <p>When was the last transaction &mdash; the last deposit of money? &mdash;
On the 17th December, 1908.</p>

  <p>How much was deposited that day? &mdash; &pound;5.</p>

  <p>Then, when was the last money drawn out? &mdash; The last sum was drawn
out on the 24th December, 1908.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether the depositor, Adolf Anderson, attended at the bank
to get the money? &mdash; Well, I could not say. It was paid at the Glasgow
head office.</p>

  <p>When was the consolidated stock that you have mentioned bought? &mdash;
On the 13th November, 1908.</p>

  <p>Is it bought from Glasgow? &mdash; It is bought through the Savings Bank
in London, by request of the depositor in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Was there any interest paid upon it when it was paid up? &mdash; Not yet;
there has been no interest yet.</p>

  <p>How long does Government stock require to be deposited before any
interest is paid on it? &mdash; I think there is interest payable for any
length of time.</p>

  <p>Was any interest paid on the &pound;69 2s. 7d. worth? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Was there any claim made for any interest? &mdash; Not that I am aware
of.</p>

  <p>If it had been left for a further period would interest have been paid
upon it? &mdash; Upon the stock, yes; as a matter of fact, there is interest
due; it has been added to it, I believe, for the time it was in.</p>

  <p>That has not been claimed, as I understand? &mdash; No,</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Adolf Anderson opened an account on
the 12th November, 1908? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>In the Post Office Savings Bank? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And he requested payment of that on the 23rd of December, and was paid
&pound;39 18s. 3d.? &mdash; He requested payment with a letter that reached
London on the 22nd.</p>

  <p>And he got paid? &mdash; He got paid at Glasgow, by London's request.</p>

  <p>On the 13th November, in London, 2&frac12; per cent, consolidated stock
was bought for a certain amount for Adolf Anderson? &mdash; For Adolf Anderson,
69 St. George's Road, Glasgow.</p>

  <p>And he requested that that should be sold by the letters which have been
referred to? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>And it was sold and he was paid &pound;49 7s. 2d., the proceeds, upon
24th December? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>The point I wish to make clear is this, the instructions as regards the
uplifting of the amount in his savings bank book were given on the 21st
December, at 5 p.m.? &mdash; That is the date on the envelope.</p><br>

  <p>HUGH CAMERON, jun., examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I reside in Cambridge
Street, Glasgow. I am a bookmaker's clerk. I have been at odd times a dealer in
jewellery. I go about clubs in Glasgow where gambling takes place. In
particular I know the Sloper Club, 24 India Street, and the Motor Club, 26
India Street. I also went to the Mascot Club, Renfield Street. That club is now
out of existence. With regard to what the people do in the club at night, some
utilise the reading rooms, some play billiards, and others play games at cards.
I play cards a good deal at these various clubs. I have known Oscar Slater
since 1901, the year of the Glasgow Exhibition. I met him first in the Crown
Hall billiard rooms, Sauchiehall Street. I met him a good deal at that time. He
did not play cards at that time; he backed horses. He was not a member of a
club in Grant Street at that time. It was later on that he became a member. I
should say that he was in Glasgow about nine months in 1901. I saw him about
three or four years afterwards, in 1905 or thereabout. After another interval
of something like three years I saw him again in November, 1908. I met him in
Sauchiehall Street. He had been in town some little time.</p>

  <p>He was staying at the Central Station Hotel under the name of A.
Anderson. After that he went to lodgings in 13G Renfrew Street, and later on he
removed to a flat in St. George's Road, which he took in the name of Anderson.
From the time he came in November, 1908, to stop in Glasgow at the Central
Station Hotel, in lodgings in Renfrew Street, and in St. George's Road, he was
known as Anderson. I saw a considerable deal of him from the time he arrived in
November until he left on 25th December. I would not say that we met very
nearly daily, but we met pretty frequently. We employed ourselves probably by
filling in the time, such as going to the skating rink, and then to a music
hall in the evening, and from there to the Sloper Club, where he subsequently
became a member. When meeting in the clubs in the evening card playing was
indulged in until well into the morning. That was the ordinary kind of way that
I and others had of passing the time. There is not much horse racing in
December; it is practically the close season. So far as I know, Slater was
never a dentist. I heard later on from him, after he had been in Glasgow for
some time, of his purpose to go to America, and I got his address. It would be
fully a fortnight before 21st December that I heard from Slater of his
intention to go abroad. He spoke quite freely about his intention among his
friends. I got the address from him in his handwriting, and I have it here.
This matter was brought to my notice specially by a letter I saw from San
Francisco. That letter was shown to me about a fortnight before he went away. I
cannot say whom the letter was from. I do not remember anything about the terms
of the letter further than that things were going very well and asking him to
go out. That was the gist of the letter. Either at that time or shortly
afterwards Slater gave me his address in San Francisco. It was Oscar Slater,
c/o Caesar Cafe, 644 Broadway, San Francisco.</p>

  <p>Do you swear you got that a week or ten days before 21st December?
&mdash; I cannot swear to that. I cannot swear that I got it at a given time,
but I know I got this given in his own handwriting, I got it from himself, but
as regards the time I got it I cannot swear.</p>

  <p>May I take it that you got it before there was any question about this
murder? &mdash; Yes. I am not definite as to when I had seen Slater before the
day of the murder, 21st December, but it must have been somewhere about the
week-end; either the Friday or the Saturday of the previous week. I saw him on
the Tuesday or the Wednesday after the murder had taken place, but I am not
quite certain about that. When I met him I received from him a pawn ticket to
dispose of, for a brooch which had been in pawn for &pound;60. He gave me the
ticket, and said that I knew a great many more people about the city than he
did, and that I was perhaps in a better position to dispose of the ticket, and
I might dispose of it for him. I took the ticket from him, and I approached two
people, Mr. Donaldson, who has a billiard room in Crown Street, and Mr. Allan,
the poulterer in Sauchiehall Street. I was not successful in disposing of the
ticket, however, and I gave it back to Oscar. It was a ticket for a diamond
crescent gold brooch, upon which &pound;60 had been already advanced. There had
been an advance of &pound;20 in November, and in December another advance of
&pound;10, and a further advance of &pound;30 had been made on it on 21st
December, the day of the murder, making &pound;60 in all. The sale of the pawn
ticket would involve this, that the brooch would be delivered up to the person
who had purchased the pawn ticket upon payment of the &pound;60, with interest,
to the pawnbroker. That is a sort of transaction with which I am familiar
enough. The brooch was in the pawnshop of Mr. Liddell, Sauchiehall Street. I do
not know Mr. P. C. M'Laren in that shop. When I failed to dispose of the
ticket, either to Mr. Donaldson or Mr. Allan, I returned it to Oscar Slater. I
do not think he made any remarks about making further efforts. I remember
meeting him after the time I have mentioned, the Tuesday or Wednesday. I had
made an arrangement to meet him in the Crown Hall billiard room at 5 p.m. on
Thursday, 24th December, but I did not meet him then. I met him passing the
comer of Gordon Street and Renfield Street. I was along with my wife, and I saw
him passing there. I mentioned to my wife that I had a prior engagement with
him at five o'clock in the Crown Hall billiard rooms, and I said it was no use
going there when I could see him now. I told her that I would be home about six
o'clock, and left her, and followed him. I met him either at four o'clock or
shortly after four on 24th December. I asked where he was going, and he said ho
was looking for the Cunard Line shipping office in Jamaica Street. I went down
to Jamaica Street with him, and he went into the Cunard offices. Immediately he
came out he asked me if I would mind going upstairs to get an English &pound;5
note for five Scotch &pound;1 notes. I went upstairs, but I was not successful
in getting the &pound;5 note. He told me that he wanted the note to send to his
people in Germany, which he had done, as he stated, almost every Christmas. I
did not get the &pound;5 note at the Cunard Offices. We went next to the
Central Station and tried the booking-office there, but were unsuccessful. We
then went to the Central Station Hotel, where he had originally been, but he
was not successful there. Then we went to Forsyth's, and then to the Grosvenor
Restaurant, where he got the note. On getting the &pound;5 note he enclosed it
along with a letter in an addressed envelope. I went with him to the Hope
Street Post Office. He got the letter registered there, and the money was sent
off. I saw the letter handed over and the registration fee paid at Hope Street.
After that we went to Miss Cranston's tea-rooms in Sauchiehall Street, and then
to Brechin, the butcher's shop. We parted after that in Sauchiehall Street. I
arranged to see him after he had taken his dinner. He dined, as a rule, at
seven o'clock. I had tea at six o'clock. I called at his house a few minutes
before eight. I was told by the servant girl he had gone out half an hour ago,
that a gentleman had called for him. The last I saw of Slater was a few minutes
before six o'clock on 24th December. As early as two o'clock on the Saturday
morning, 26th December, some detectives came to my house and asked me if I knew
Oscar Slater. I said that I did. I never saw Oscar Slater dressed in checked
trousers or light-coloured spats at any time during November and December. As a
rule, his clothes were dark, with the exception of the waterproof coat, of
course. I am not very clear as to the shape of a Donegal hat. I have seen him
wear a cloth hat with a circular rim right round, and with a split in the
centre &mdash; I mean the kind of hat like the production No. 44. I never saw
him with a cloth hat with a rim round it, and without the split. He generally
wore a black bowler hat. I have seen him with the cloth cap, No. 46 of
productions.</p>

  <p>Do you remember being in Johnston's billiard rooms with him on the
Wednesday night before he left, the 23rd? &mdash; I cannot say that I do. At
the time I saw him last on Thursday, 24th December, he had a very stubbly
moustache which was quite noticeable. I am aware that Slater, before he left,
had lost money at the Sloper Club. I knew that because I had seen him lose
money at the Club. I did not, in point of fact, know that Slater was going off
on Friday, the 25th. I understood that he was going to America soon, but I did
not know the precise date. I did not know that he was making inquiry at
shipping offices during the week of his departure. I understood that he went to
the Cunard office to make inquiry as regards the sailings of the Cunard Line to
America. That was upon Thursday, the 24th. He did not communicate to me any
definite plan at that time as to when he was leaving, further than he said,
when he came out of the Cunard office, that perhaps the "Campania," sailing on
Saturday week, might suit him.</p>

  <p>You saw Slater two or three times between the day of the murder, 21st
December, and 25th December; did it occur to you that there was anything in his
demeanour, his manner, or his habits different from usual? &mdash; No, there
was nothing.</p>

  <p>Did he show any anxiety at all to secrete himself or to hide himself?
&mdash; Not that I know of. In fact, it was the opposite.</p>

  <p>You were round about in public places with him during the afternoon, as
you have mentioned? &mdash; Yes, on the Thursday afternoon.</p>

  <p>And you saw nothing that would lead you to suppose that he was a fugitive
from justice? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Under what different names
did you know the prisoner? &mdash; Anderson and Oscar Slater.</p>

  <p>Adolf Anderson? &mdash; I never heard of the Adolf; any indication was
"A. Anderson" on a card that I always saw.</p>

  <p>When you first knew him in 1901 what was the name he went by? &mdash;
Oscar Slater.</p>

  <p>What was he? &mdash; I am not aware when I met him what he was.</p>

  <p>After you became acquainted with him did you become aware what he was?
&mdash; He was a gambler.</p>

  <p>Anything more? &mdash; Yes, I had it that the man, like a great number of
those who came to Glasgow, lived on the proceeds of women.</p>

  <p>Did you not know from the first that his mode of living was on the
proceeds of women's prostitution? &mdash; I cannot say that I knew from the
first; I had no knowledge of the people.</p>

  <p>When did you come to know that? &mdash; When we came to have sufficient
knowledge to know the people that came about the locality the story went
round.</p>

  <p>When was that? &mdash; Some time after they arrived in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Can you fix the year? &mdash; The year of the Glasgow Exhibition, 1901.</p>

  <p>Where did he live? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>Had he any place of abode in Glasgow that you knew of? &mdash; I did not
know of his address in Glasgow at that time.</p>

  <p>For how long did you know him in 1901 without knowing whether he had any
address or not? &mdash; I knew him all the time he was there till he left
without knowing his address.</p>

  <p>Did you ever ask him where he lived? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>What part of the city did you and he frequent, or did he frequent?
&mdash; We did not at that time frequent any part of the city together.</p>

  <p>Where did you meet him? &mdash; In the Crown Hall billiard rooms in
Sauchiehall Street.</p>

  <p>Is that the only place you met him then? &mdash; At that time, yes.</p>

  <p>Later on did you meet him in a club in Grant Street? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How far is Grant Street from Queen's Terrace? &mdash; It is a street
further along; I should say about 70 yards to the west.</p>

  <p>Did you meet him there often? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was that a gambling club? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>In what year was it that you met him often in the Grant Street gambling
club? &mdash; As near as I can remember, the latter part of the year of the
Glasgow Exhibition.</p>

  <p>How long did he remain in Glasgow at that time? &mdash; I cannot be
definite as regards that.</p>

  <p>A year? &mdash; I have stated about nine months, I think, but I am not
very sanguine about it.</p>

  <p>Where did he go to then? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>Did he never tell you? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did he just disappear, as far as you were concerned? &mdash; As far as I
was concerned, yes.</p>

  <p>Did you know of him being a dealer in diamonds and precious stones?
&mdash; I cannot say that I have known him to be a dealer in diamonds and
precious stones.</p>

  <p>Is that news to you now? &mdash; No, it is not exactly news, because I
know that he, along with many others, all did in that way, buying and selling,
but whether it embraced the words "diamond merchant" I would not say; they all
more or less deal in jewellery.</p>

  <p>When he disappeared, had you no communication with him? &mdash; None
whatever.</p>

  <p>Did you never hear of him being in Soho Square, London, dealing in
diamonds and precious stones? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>When did he reappear? &mdash; I am not definite as regards that either.</p>

  <p>Was it years or months afterwards? &mdash; Oh, it was some years, I
think.</p>

  <p>Where? &mdash; In Glasgow.</p>

  <p>What part of Glasgow? &mdash; In Sauchiehall Street.</p>

  <p>What part of Sauchiehall Street? &mdash; Hope Street.</p>

  <p>Was it a house? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You mean, you met him casually on the street there? &mdash; I cannot say
where I met him.</p>

  <p>Why did you mention Hope Street; what happened in Hope Street? &mdash;
That is the street adjacent to the Crown Hall billiard rooms, which we, as a
rule, frequent.</p>

  <p>Was it again in the Crown Hall billiard rooms that you saw him when he
reappeared in Glasgow? &mdash; I cannot say that.</p>

  <p>Can you recollect any place that you met him after he reappeared in
Glasgow? &mdash; No, I cannot say that I can.</p>

  <p>Did you see him at all at the time that he reappeared? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You could not fix the date of his second appearance? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Can you not recollect any place you met him in Glasgow the second time he
reappeared? &mdash; No, I cannot say that I can.</p>

  <p>You just remember that he was in Glasgow? &mdash; Yes; I remember that he
was in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>And you saw him? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Under what name was he going then? &mdash; Oscar Slater, as far as I can
remember.</p>

  <p>How long was he in Glasgow at that time? &mdash; I cannot say.</p>

  <p>And you tell us that you cannot remember a single place you met him in
Glasgow during his second visit; do you really say that? &mdash; Well, I may
have met him in the Crown Halls, but that is not definite, so that I cannot
definitely state any particular place that I met him on his second visit to
Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Did you meet him in any of the gambling clubs on his second visit to
Glasgow? &mdash; I do not know that any of the clubs were in existence at that
time during his second visit to Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Had the Grant Street Club been suppressed or not? &mdash; Yes; it only
lasted the one year or part of a year.</p>

  <p>And was there not another club where you met him the first time in 1901?
&mdash; The West End Club.</p>

  <p>Was it suppressed also? &mdash; Yes, it was suppressed also.</p>

  <p>Then, after his second visit, when you do not remember where you met him,
did he disappear again? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you when he was going away, or did he just vanish? &mdash; I
do not remember him having stated anything about when he was going or where.</p>

  <p>How long did he disappear for the second time? &mdash; Till November,
1908.</p>

  <p>And then did you meet him casually on the street? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you know under what name he was going then? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What was it? &mdash; A. Anderson.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you that himself? &mdash; He gave me his card.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you why he had taken the name A. Anderson at this time?
&mdash; He did not.</p>

  <p>Did you ask him? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>Did you not think it curious that he should have changed his name the
third time he came to Glasgow? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And when you thought so, did you not ask him what reason he had for
taking a different name? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Does it not seem curious to you now that you did not inquire of him?
&mdash; I meet many men in that kind of way. I never was sufficiently curious
to ask the man why he had changed his name.</p>

  <p>But amongst yourselves, in the clubs, is he still known by the name of
Oscar Slater? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you know his German name; did you ever hear it? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he had another name? &mdash; I was always under the
impression that Oscar Slater was his name.</p>

  <p>Now, did you meet him very often at nights during the second half of
November and the first three weeks of December in the Sloper Club? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>In the Motor Club also? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were these both clubs very much of the same kind as the Grant Street Club
and the West End Club? &mdash; Very much.</p>

  <p>And had they been started comparatively recently? &mdash; Both clubs
&mdash; well, the one is a transfer from another.</p>

  <p>Did he still continue to gamble at both the clubs? &mdash; Not so much in
the Motor as in the Sloper Club.</p>

  <p>Was he practically at the Sloper Club every night gambling during the
latter end of November and the beginning of December? &mdash; No, not every
night.</p>

  <p>But almost every night? &mdash; I should not say that; not every night.</p>

  <p>Give us an idea how many nights a week? &mdash; Three or four.</p>

  <p>And sometimes more, I suppose? &mdash; Three or four.</p>

  <p>Do you know where he went on the other nights? &mdash; I do not know, I
am sure.</p>

  <p>Do you know what he did during the day? &mdash; As far as I understand,
he was not much out until mid-day.</p>

  <p>And from mid-day onwards do you know what he did? &mdash; Sometimes he
was along with me.</p>

  <p>Where? &mdash; At the skating rink in Victoria Road, Glasgow.</p>

  <p>In the afternoons? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And at other times? &mdash; Walking round the town.</p>

  <p>So far as you know, had he any occupation? &mdash; Not that I know.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he was in the way of pawning jewels? &mdash; I was
conversant with the fact of anything having been pawned, such as the brooch and
the pin, and some other things, on account of him being short of money.</p>

  <p>Did you know in the middle of November that he was short of money and
went with a diamond ring to a man called Jackson, South Portland Street?
&mdash; No; I was not conversant with that fact.</p>

  <p>How did you come to know that he was short of money? &mdash; I was in a
position to lend him some.</p>

  <p>Did you? &mdash; I did.</p>

  <p>When? &mdash; I cannot state the date.</p>

  <p>Was it November or December? &mdash; I could not be certain.</p>

  <p>How much? &mdash; &pound;4.</p>

  <p>Did he repay it? &mdash; He did.</p>

  <p>When was that? &mdash; In December, I think.</p>

  <p>You said that he lost money at gambling; do you know how much he had lost
just before he went away? &mdash; I could not say.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you what money he had &mdash; what he possessed? &mdash; No,
he did not.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he had money at his credit in the Savings Bank? &mdash;
I did not.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he had pawned jewels with Liddell? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you that? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you know where he got the jewels? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>Do you know what he got for them at the pawnshop? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he had obtained &pound;30 upon a brooch? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And did you know that on the 21st December he raised other &pound;30 upon
it? &mdash; I got to know that afterwards.</p>

  <p>From whom? &mdash; From himself.</p>

  <p>Now, why was it that he wanted to sell the pawn ticket to you, or you to
get a purchaser for the pawn ticket? &mdash; Because it would very likely
realise money.</p>

  <p>What did he want money for at that time? &mdash; As far as I understand,
he did not wish to redeem the pledge when he took the extra &pound;30 on it,
and he wanted to take any little value out of the ticket that remained then.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you why he was eager to get the balance of value out? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>Was he so anxious for the money that he trusted you with the pawn ticket
to try and find a purchaser? &mdash; Well, I do not know. I trusted him
before.</p>

  <p>Did he trust you this time? &mdash; Yes, with the pawn ticket.</p>

  <p>And was he very anxious that you would find a purchaser? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And did you do your best for him? &mdash; I applied at two different
places.</p>

  <p>And failed? &mdash; And failed.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; How much was he willing to take; did he give you a
limit? &mdash; I think he mentioned &pound;10.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; Did he tell you at that time what he
wanted the money for? &mdash; He did not.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you at that time that he could get command of about &pound;80
from the bank? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Now, you said that he told you about a fortnight before the murder that
he was going to America? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you why? &mdash; On account of a letter that he had got from
a friend.</p>

  <p>Did he show you the letter? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Who was the friend? &mdash; I do not know; I did not read the
signature.</p>

  <p>Where did the letter come from? &mdash; I understand from San
Francisco.</p>

  <p>Who was the friend in San Francisco? &mdash; I cannot tell you.</p>

  <p>What did he want him to come over to San Francisco for? &mdash; Business
was pretty fair; very good, it stated, I think in the letter.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; What language was it in? &mdash; In the English
language.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; I thought you told us that the man
had no business; I thought you said that the man had no calling? &mdash; Not as
far as I knew.</p>

  <p>Then what did you understand by a letter from San Francisco bidding him
to go there because business was good? &mdash; Well, I understand that Slater
and this man had had a club in conjunction before, and he wanted him to come
out and join him again.</p>

  <p>To run a club? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Can you recollect anything more about the letter about which you have
just told us? &mdash; No, I cannot.</p>

  <p>Why did he not go? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you why he did not go? &mdash; No, he did not, but his
intentions were sincere; he intended to go as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Did he ever tell you of a friend Jacobs in New York? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Do you know anything about his dealings in emeralds? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you never hear of that? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you ever hear of him going to Chicago? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you know when he left on the 25th of December that his destination
was Chicago? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>Were you surprised to hear that? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he ever tell you that he meant to go to Queensland? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you never hear of that? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did he ever mention to you that he intended to go to Monte Carlo? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>When? &mdash; I think it was prior to this letter arriving.</p>

  <p>That would be early in December? &mdash; Yes, I believe it would.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Had he been there before? &mdash; Yes, he had been
at Monte Carlo before.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; Did he tell you? &mdash; On account
of some friend in the club stating he was going to Monte Carlo; that was before
he produced the letter from San Francisco.</p>

  <p>Do you know why he did not go to Monte Carlo? &mdash; I do not.</p>

  <p>Did he ever tell you that he had changed his mind? &mdash; I think I
heard him mention to these people who spoke of going that he would not manage
to get to Monte Carlo.</p>

  <p>Why? &mdash; He did not mention or state reasons.</p>

  <p>Did you know by the middle of December that he had abandoned his
intention of going there? &mdash; Yes, I believe so.</p>

  <p>Did you ever hear it said that he intended to go to London? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Or to the Continent generally, just across to the Continent; you never
heard him say that? &mdash; Of course, Monte Carlo is the Continent.</p>

  <p>Did he ever say that he was just going to the Continent, without
mentioning any particular place? &mdash; No, Monte Carlo was what I heard
said.</p>

  <p>Did he seem to think the day when you saw him going to the Cunard Line
that the "Campania" that sailed a week later would do him well enough? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>And did he tell you that he was at the Cunard office to inquire about the
sailings? &mdash; Yes, about the sailings, and he got a pamphlet.</p>

  <p>Did you know when he was speaking to you about going off to America or
Chicago and the rest that he had taken his house for eighteen months from the
28th November? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he had bought a considerable quantity of furniture and
furnished the house? &mdash; On the hire-purchase system, yes.</p>

  <p>He told you that? &mdash; Yes. I knew that.</p>

  <p>And did you know that he had set up as a dentist? &mdash; So the card
read.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; You saw the card? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; I suppose you knew otherwise; did you
not know otherwise? &mdash; Well, I thought I did.</p>

  <p>You have been up in his house at 69 St. George's Road? &mdash; I have.</p>

  <p>Did you ever see any dentist's instruments there? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Or any sign of any business being earned on? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You knew him well; how do you account for him taking his house for
eighteen months and going away without mentioning the fact to the landlord?
&mdash;I cannot say.</p>

  <p>Does it strike you as curious? &mdash; With a man such as he is, I should
look upon nothing with surprise.</p>

  <p>Was the last time you saw him 24th December? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And did you make an appointment with him, which he did not keep,
immediately after that? &mdash; On the 24th I had to see him in his own house,
and I was told he had gone out.</p>

  <p>Did you call at a certain time to see him, and when you went were you not
told that he was out? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you never saw him afterwards? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>And you had no idea that he was going off the following night? &mdash;
None whatever.</p>

  <p>He did not tell you that? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Had he not a large quantity of clothes? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>He had eight or nine different packages full of clothes? &mdash; He had
eight or nine different suits of clothes and so many coats; I do not know about
packages.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he shaved his moustache off in the middle of December?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you remark it at the time? &mdash; Oh, yes.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you why? &mdash; He mentioned to me that it was getting a bit
scraggy.</p>

  <p>Did you notice there was a few days' growth the last time you saw him?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he write you a letter from New York? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were you his most intimate friend in Glasgow? &mdash; I question that
very much.</p>

  <p>Do you know anybody that was more intimate with him than you were?
&mdash; Well, there were some of his own countrymen; I don't know who they
were.</p>

  <p>(Shown No. 53 of Productions.) &mdash; Was that the letter which he sent?
&mdash; That is the letter.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; My friend says he had "a few days'
growth" of the moustache the last time you saw him; do you know when he was
shaved? &mdash; I do not exactly know the date.</p>

  <p>Well, the barber has told us that he shaved it a fortnight before the
21st; was the moustache perfectly observable the last time you saw him? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>I mean, a feature in his face? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Would it be incorrect to describe it as a few days' growth? &mdash;
Rather more than a few days' growth I should say.</p>

  <p>And he has a very black moustache? &mdash; Very dark.</p>

  <p>You never would have taken him for a clean-shaven man when you saw him
last? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>As regards dentist, have you any notion of the purpose for which Slater,
and I suppose other people, take a designation of that kind? &mdash; To have a
vocation of some kind, if they are required to state what their business is.</p>

  <p>He has not pretended to be a dentist at any time to you? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>And you never knew him touching anybody's teeth? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>So far as you knew him, was he a man who lived like the rest of the
people in these clubs, mainly by backing horses in the season or gambling at
clubs? &mdash; Or gambling at clubs.</p>

  <p>And that was the ordinary life of a lot of them who were there? &mdash;
Yes, I may say that.</p>

  <p>Now, did you hear him complain over and over again of -what he called
business being bad in Glasgow? &mdash; Yes, I have heard him state that.</p>

  <p>And you are quite familiar with the idea that he was on the move, so to
speak, and was going away? &mdash; He spoke of going to America certainly, but
I did not expect that he would go as soon as he did.</p>

  <p>You thought it was to be the "Campania," instead of which it was the
"Lusitania," a week earlier? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you ever hear him saying that he would go when he got some one to
take over his flat? &mdash; I know that he was negotiating for his flat being
taken over, because I came in contact with a man who came up for a negotiation
of that kind and saw him in Slater's apartments.</p>

  <p>Tell me who that was? &mdash; A man called Aumann, as far as I
understand.</p>

  <p>Was Aumann up seeing Slater's flat? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>With a view to taking it over? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me how long that was before Slater left? &mdash; Some
considerable time; I cannot tell you just exactly how long.</p>

  <p>Do you know anything at all about Mrs. Freedman, who ultimately came into
the flat after Slater left? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>In order to have lifted the brooch which had been deposited, he would
have had to pay &pound;60 down? &mdash; Considerably more &mdash; &pound;61
odds he would have required to pay for the brooch.</p>

  <p>And having raised as much money as he could by advances on the brooch he
was then willing to sell any odd value it might have to a purchaser? &mdash; He
was; the ticket was a valuable asset &mdash; a brooch pawned for &pound;60.</p>

  <p>You said he intended to go abroad, you thought to San Francisco? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>That was your understanding? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And it is only a question whether it was sooner or later? &mdash; Exactly
so.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Do you know whether Slater had any training as a
dentist? &mdash; I do not know whether he may have had before he came to this
country or not, but not since I knew him here.</p>

  <p>And you think he merely took that name just to give an appearance of
having an occupation? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you know that in his declaration he calls himself a dentist? &mdash; I
did not know.</p>

  <p>At the time, on 21st December, was he well off or hard up? &mdash; Well,
you see, there were &pound;30 got at mid-day on the 21st, so that you would not
say that a man in possession of &pound;30 was hard up.</p>

  <p>You told us he had no occupation, that he lost money at gambling, and
that he was anxious to sell the pawn ticket; how did he live, if he had no
occupation and had lost money; what was he living on? &mdash; On the
gambling.</p>

  <p>But he had lost in gambling, you told us? &mdash; Well, not all; he was
still in possession of jewellery which he had pawned, and up till then he got
&pound;30 more, and what he still holds, and I believe he had other things that
he could have realised money on, had he not gone away, so that he was not
absolutely penniless.</p>

  <p>You have told us that he called himself a dentist so as to have an
occupation; he had an occupation as a dealer in diamonds and precious stones;
you have seen his card with that on it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Having an occupation as a dealer in diamonds and precious stones, why did
he require to call himself a dentist, or can you tell? &mdash; I have no
explanation for that.</p>

  <p>Where was he on Monday, 21st December? &mdash; That I have no conception
of.</p>

  <p>Where was he on Sunday, the 20th of December? &mdash; I could not say.</p>

  <p>Was it on the 19th, the Saturday, that you saw him? &mdash; I am not
certain about that &mdash; either the Friday or the Saturday; it was the week-
end prior to the 21st, some time about the week-end I saw him.</p>

  <p>He was not with you on Monday, 21st December, at all? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>He refers in his letter to you to his friends; in his letter to you he
winds up by saying, "My best regards to you and all my friends "? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Will you name them? &mdash; I take it that it was members of the club
that had been in the habit of playing with him, a matter of seven or eight of
us altogether; we played at poker, and I think that his reference to "friends"
there meant those boys that played at cards, at poker, in the club, because
outside of that I know of no others.</p>

  <p>He says in his letter to you, "I will prove with five people where I have
been when the murder was committed"; did you understand these were among his
friends? &mdash; No, I did not &mdash; not the friends that I refer to, the
club friends.</p>

  <p>And you do not know who these people are? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>I did not catch the name of the person to whose care the San Francisco
address was to be sent, 544 Broadway, San Francisco; what was the name? &mdash;
Caesar Cafe.</p>

  <p>Have you heard him speak in any other language besides English in the
club or elsewhere? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Had he associates who were not Scotch or English? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Germans? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How much have you known him lose at the Sloper or the Motor or the Mascot
Clubs on any one occasion? &mdash; From &pound;15 to &pound;20; the bulk of his
money was lost at clubs before he was a member of the Sloper Club &mdash; a
club that I did not frequent at all, a club in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>You said in reference to Monte Carlo that there were people in the club
who were going there? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Who were these? &mdash; Mr. Dewar and Mr. Dillon and a Mr. Maclean.</p>

  <p>Are they still in Glasgow? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And were those friends of his; did he go about with them? &mdash; At the
club.</p>

  <p>And outside? &mdash; I will not say outside.</p>

  <p>Who besides you did he go about with outside? &mdash; German friends of
his own.</p>

  <p>Can you name any of them? &mdash; I did not come into contact with these
people at all &mdash; his German friends, but still I know that he had them.</p>

  <p>Can you name any of them? &mdash; Rattman, Aumann, and Max Brooks.</p>

  <p>Do you recollect any others? &mdash; That is all I know of.</p><br>

  <p>MAX RATTMAN, examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I was cited here for the
Crown, but I was not called. I know Oscar Slater, and have known him for the
last six years. He and I are fellow-countrymen. I was in Glasgow when he came
to it. I arrived one train later than he did about 29th October, 1908. I met
him frequently between that date and the 25th of December, when he left; I met
him nearly every day. I met him generally in Gall's public-house in the
Cowcaddens, and I met him at various clubs in the evening, sometimes in the
Mascot Club, in Virginia Street, and sometimes in the Motor Club, in India
Street, and I met him in Johnston's billiard saloon, opposite the Pavilion, in
Renfield Street. I heard of Slater's intention to leave this country. As soon
as he arrived in Glasgow he expected a letter from San Francisco or New York
from a friend, and as soon as he received an answer he was willing to leave.
About ten days before he left I saw a letter that came to him from San
Francisco. It was sent to him by a friend of his, I believe, but I do not know
the name, but it was signed by some one.</p>

  <p>Would you recognise the name &mdash; was it anything like Devoto? &mdash;
I am not positive about that. I read the letter. He said something about the
reason for his stopping in this country, as he expected some one from London to
take the house, and he could not leave till that party arrived. He was
intending to go out in response to that letter as soon as he could arrange for
the house being taken over. He told me that at the time he showed me the
letter. On 21st December I was with Slater at half-past four in Gall's public-
house. Slater came in, and he asked me to come over with him to the bar, and he
spoke to me about a pawn ticket which he would sell me for &pound;4. He said
that he had a brooch which was pawned for &pound;60 in Sauchiehall Street,
corner of Buchanan Street, in Mr. Liddell's pawnbroking office. I had seen the
brooch before; I have seen his wife wearing it. It was a half-moon with a row
of diamonds. I refused to buy it myself, and I asked Mr. Aumann, with whom I
had dealings at the time, whether he was willing to buy it. I said that it was
pawned at the corner of Sauchiehall Street. Mr. Aumann said that it was no use,
as the pawnbrokers had already advanced too much on it, and he would not have
any profit, because he would have to repay &pound;60. It was I who spoke to Mr.
Aumann on Slater's behalf in Gall's public-house. Slater then left, and soon
after Mr. Aumann and another person, whom I did not know, left, and had a game
of billiards in Johnston's billiard room. We stopped playing a little later
than half-past six. I saw Slater that evening before I left the billiard room.
He came into the billiard room about twenty minutes past six, and I asked him
whether he had sold the ticket or not, and he said no.</p>

  <p>I find a telegram was sent by Slater from the Central Station at twelve
minutes past six that night; would it take him about six or seven minutes to go
from the Central Station up to the billiard room? &mdash; Not much more.</p>

  <p>Does that support your view that it was about twenty minutes past six
when he came to the billiard room? &mdash; I think it was twenty minutes past,
because soon after he left we finished off playing, and he was only there for
about ten minutes. I am speaking generally, because I was not looking at my
watch at the time. Slater left Johnston's billiard room on the night of the
21st about half-past six. I am sure about that. He said that he was going home
for dinner, and he asked me where I was going. I said, "Very likely to a music
hall," and he said that he would see me there, if possible. I think I said that
I was going to the Palace, and he said, "Very likely I will come and see you."
I knew that he dined about seven o'clock every night. I did not go to the
Palace Music Hall. I saw some one off to Germany by the 9.30 train from St.
Enoch Station. I got home about twelve o'clock. That was on the Monday, and I
believe it was the Wednesday night when I next saw Slater after ten o'clock in
Johnston's billiard room. It was after ten or eleven, because I had been at a
music hall, and I would get to Johnston's billiard room about a quarter to
eleven. He was sitting there with Mr. Cameron, the last witness. I think that
would be about eleven o'clock at night. He was sitting on a bench near the
door; I was playing with Mr. Aumann, and he was watching us. Aumann and I had a
game at a table opposite him. We had only 100 up, and we left about twenty
minutes past eleven o'clock. Slater, Cameron, and I left together. Cameron left
us at the corner of Cambridge Street and Sauchiehall Street, and I went on with
Slater as far as his place in St. George's Road. I never saw Slater wearing
light, checked trousers of any kind. I have seen him wearing brown boots
sometimes, but very seldom &mdash; once or twice. I never saw him with a
Donegal cap on, but I have seen him with a cap with the sides up. I never saw
him with light-coloured gaiters. His ordinary clothes were generally dark or
brown. I was aware of his desire to get some one to take over his flat before
leaving. I received a letter from him from Liverpool. It was a letter in
German, and is on page 16 of the print. I translated it. (Shown production No.
26.) That is the letter I received from him. He says there "that Freedman's
girl took over my flat." I see that the translation says, "Dear Max,
surprisingly leaving Glasgow."</p>

  <p>Does that mean unexpectedly? &mdash; I did not translate it like that. I
would translate it, "Having left Glasgow suddenly, I am very sorry I was not
able to say good-bye." I was aware that he was negotiating with Freedman. He
expected a letter every day, but the letter never came, and when Mrs. Freedman
came she was sitting in the flat waiting for him. I know that he was expecting
Mrs. Freedman to come down. That letter was the last that I heard of him before
this affair. I am perfectly certain that I can speak to the fact that the
accused was in my company till at least 6.30 on the night of the 21st. So far
as my recollection goes, we left off playing at 6.35, and Slater left before we
stopped playing billiards. I knew that he was in the billiard room for a very
short time &mdash; about eight or ten minutes. I believe it would take some
seven or eight minutes to come from the Central Station, where the telegram was
sent off at 6.12, up to the billiard room where we were. On the 21st of
December last Slater had a moustache about &frac14; an inch long. It was quite
noticeable, it being dark. I would never have taken him for a clean-shaven man
that day. I am not quite positive how he was dressed when I saw him last, but I
know that he had a dark suit of clothes and a bowler hat.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; What are you? &mdash; I am a
commercial traveller representing a firm in Germany.</p>

  <p>Where are you situated? &mdash; In Edinburgh now.</p>

  <p>Where is your place of business? &mdash; I have not got a place of
business. I am a traveller.</p>

  <p>Is your real name George Schmidt? &mdash; No; my real name is Max
Rattman.</p>

  <p>Do not you often go by the name of George Schmidt? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Never? &mdash; I once did.</p>

  <p>When did you come to know the prisoner? &mdash; About five or six years
ago.</p>

  <p>Where? &mdash; In several places in London.</p>

  <p>Where? &mdash; In the Traveller's Retreat, for instance.</p>

  <p>Where else? &mdash; Denmark Street.</p>

  <p>What are these places? &mdash; Gambling places or clubs.</p>

  <p>What was his means of livelihood? &mdash; As far as I could see he was
gambling; he was a sportsman and making a book.</p>

  <p>How long did you know him at that time in London as a gambler? &mdash; I
did not know him long in fact, I did not know him personally at all in London.
I got to know him better personally in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>What were you doing in London at that time? &mdash; I had a restaurant.</p>

  <p>And he came about that? &mdash; No; he did not.</p>

  <p>When did you meet him again in Glasgow? &mdash; About 29th October.</p>

  <p>What name was he going under? &mdash; I only knew him under the name of
Slater. Having been at his place, I saw that he went under the name of
Anderson.</p>

  <p>Why did he go under the name of Anderson? &mdash; I could not tell you.</p>

  <p>Do you know that he called himself a dentist? &mdash; I do not know
anything about that.</p>

  <p>Did you not know that he called himself a dentist? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You never heard of that? &mdash; No; I never heard anything about his
being a dentist.</p>

  <p>Did you ever see him in possession of jewels? &mdash; Yes, I did.</p>

  <p>Where? &mdash; One day he offered me a ring for sale, but not for
myself.</p>

  <p>When? &mdash; About four weeks before the murder.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he called himself a dealer in diamonds and precious
stones? &mdash; I did.</p>

  <p>Was that correct? &mdash; He was known to me as a dealer in diamonds.</p>

  <p>When? &mdash; Lately.</p>

  <p>What do you mean by lately? &mdash; Since I knew him again in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>"Who told you, when you knew him in Glasgow, that he was a dealer in
diamonds? &mdash; He often had some diamonds about him.</p>

  <p>Where did he get them? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>You just knew that he was a dealer in diamonds and precious stones
because he had them? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And he tried to sell one to you? &mdash; One ring.</p>

  <p>Do you know any other people besides yourself to whom he tried to sell
them? &mdash; He tried to sell to Mr. Aumann.</p>

  <p>Any one else? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Do you know that he tried to sell to another of your countrymen, Jackson?
&mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you know about him pawning a brooch at the time ho did it? &mdash; I
knew about it.</p>

  <p>Where did it come from? &mdash; I do not know; I could not tell.</p>

  <p>Are you sure he had no place of business then? &mdash; Not so far as I
know.</p>

  <p>Can you fix the date when you saw the letter from San Francisco? &mdash;
No. It was some time before the murder.</p>

  <p>But how long you do not know? &mdash; No. It was eight or ten days, or
something like that.</p>

  <p>Who was the man who wanted him? &mdash; His friend, with whom he had a
club in New York.</p>

  <p>Was it a man Jacobs? &mdash; Jacobs was mentioned in the letter, but I do
not know whose was the signature.</p>

  <p>Was it not a man Jacobs who dealt in precious stones? &mdash; I do not
know.</p>

  <p>Try and recollect. &mdash; I could not tell you.</p>

  <p>Did he say he would join his friend in San Francisco? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you know that when he went his destination was Chicago? &mdash; No;
he said America.</p>

  <p>Did you ever hear of that till to-day? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>From your knowledge of his manner and ways, can you account for him going
to Chicago? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You cannot explain that? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Under how many different names did you know him going? &mdash; Only
Slater and this name Anderson.</p>

  <p>Did you ever hear of a name Otto Sando? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you know that when he went away he took that name? &mdash; I read it
in the paper; that was all.</p>

  <p>Can you explain that? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You don't know why he took that name? &mdash; No; I could not tell you.</p>

  <p>He had no reason to conceal his going away from you? &mdash; No; he did
not conceal it from me.</p>

  <p>Why did he go away so quickly? &mdash; Because the person was waiting in
the flat for him, and he packed up his things.</p>

  <p>Did you not know that the person was not waiting in the flat for him but
in the Alexandra Hotel? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>You thought the lady was waiting? &mdash; In the flat.</p>

  <p>And he left suddenly because she was to take possession of it? You just
judged that from the letter? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>From what passage in the letter is it that you judge that the lady was in
the flat, and he had to get out of it? &mdash; "As soon as I arrived home I
found Mrs. Freedman waiting." That is what he says in my letter here.</p>

  <p>Is it? &mdash; No; I find it says, "Freedman's girl has taken my flat
over."</p>

  <p>Did you think he had suddenly departed because Freedman's girl had
appeared on the scene? &mdash; I believed so.</p>

  <p>Who was Freedman's girl? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>Did you never hear of her before? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did he say in his letter that he was sorry he had forgotten to say good-
bye to you? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he say good-bye to you? &mdash; No; simply in the letter.</p>

  <p>Did he say he forgot to say good-bye to you because Freedman's girl had
appeared? &mdash; No; it was because I did not go up. He asked me to go up on
the Friday, and I did not go up. That is the reason I did not see him any
more.</p>

  <p>Did you know he was sailing on the Saturday? &mdash; I did not know
&mdash; yes, he said in the letter that he was in Liverpool, and was leaving
for San Francisco, and his wife was going to Paris.</p>

  <p>Did you know he was sailing on Saturday before you got the letter?
&mdash; No; I did not know until I got the letter.</p>

  <p>Was the last time you saw him the Thursday? &mdash; Yes; I think so.</p>

  <p>And he said nothing to you on the Thursday? &mdash; He said I was to come
up on Friday and see him, being Christmas Day.</p>

  <p>He said nothing to you on the Thursday about starting for Chicago on the
Saturday? &mdash; He said San Francisco.</p>

  <p>Did he say anything to you on Thursday about starting by ship? &mdash; He
said nothing on Thursday. He simply said I was to come up on Friday, and
nothing else.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; There is nothing about that in the letter? &mdash;
He says in the letter he was leaving for San Francisco.</p>

  <p>Where is that? I do not see that? &mdash; (No answer.)</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; Would you be so kind as to translate
for us the two sentences, the one about the French girl and the other about San
Francisco? &mdash; It says here, "The French girl is going to Paris from
Liverpool, and I go on to San Francisco, and I shall write you a letter how
things are."</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Where does he say he is going on Saturday? &mdash;
He says it in the letter.</p>

  <p>Read the portion in the letter where he says he is going to San Francisco
on the Saturday? &mdash; He says the girl is going to Paris, Saturday
morning.</p>

  <p>Does he say Saturday morning? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Why did you say that if the letter does not have Saturday morning?
&mdash; The letter was Saturday morning. "And I shall let you know how things
are in San Francisco." That is all. "Give my best respects" to So-and-So. There
is nothing else mentioned except that he will let me know from San
Francisco.</p>

  <p>It does not say when he is leaving Liverpool? &mdash; Not in the
letter.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination resumed &mdash; Did you know to-day for the first time
that he was not on his way to San Francisco, but was on his way to Chicago?
&mdash; I do not know anything about Chicago.</p>

  <p>Who was the French girl referred to in the sentence immediately before?
&mdash; That was the person who was living with him at the time.</p>

  <p>Where? &mdash; 69 St. George's Road.</p>

  <p>Does he say that she is going to Paris from Liverpool? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You knew that she went with him to America? &mdash; I did not know. I
only read that after he was arrested that the girl was in his company.</p>

  <p>You found that out afterwards, that that was not true about going to
Paris? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Tell us what is the word that you have translated here by "surprisingly"?
&mdash; It says "absolutely suddenly," literally translated.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely suddenly"? &mdash; "Having left Glasgow, I forgot to say good-
bye to you because Freedman's missus has taken my flat over."</p>

  <p>Does he really say that he forgot to say good-bye to you because
Freedman's girl had taken over his flat? &mdash; Yes, absolutely.</p>

  <p>We may take it as "absolutely suddenly leaving." Did he give any
explanation in his letter to you for his absolutely suddenly leaving Glasgow?
&mdash; Because Mrs. Freedman had taken the flat over.</p>

  <p>That is the explanation? &mdash; That is the explanation in the letter.</p>

  <p>Who is the marker in the billiard room in Renfield Street? &mdash; A very
old man; I do not know his name.</p>

  <p>Was he in the billiard room on the 21st of December? &mdash; I could not
tell you. I did not take any notice.</p>

  <p>How do you recollect it was 21st December? &mdash; Because, as soon as I
arrived home, I heard about the murder. I was not living far from it.</p>

  <p>Was there anybody else in the billiard room at the time? &mdash; I
believe there were two or three other persons, but I could not tell you.</p>

  <p>What were their names? &mdash; We were playing three &mdash; Aumann,
myself, and another man that I do not know &mdash; we were playing a three
hundred game when Slater came up.</p>

  <p>Are you just given us your idea of the time? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>As I understand, you did not look at the clock? &mdash; No, but I was
home about ten minutes to seven, because I was wanting to see some one off at
the station.</p>

  <p>You are giving us your guess at the time? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You say you reached your home at ten minutes to seven? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Where is your home? &mdash; At that time it was at 23 Cromwell Street,
New City Road.</p>

  <p>Did you finish your game after Slater left? &mdash; Yes, there was only a
minute of difference when we finished the game and when Slater left.</p>

  <p>That is to the best of your recollection? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You neither took the time when he came in nor did you take the time when
he went out? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>All you know is that you reached your own home at 23 Cromwell Street at
ten minutes to seven? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you were in the billiard room after Slater left &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>For some time, which you have guessed at? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>May I take it that you do not recollect what clothes he was wearing that
night? &mdash; No, but I am certain that he had a dark suit and patent
boots.</p>

  <p>Had he a great number of suits? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And hats? &mdash; Mostly a bowler hat or this one cap that I have
mentioned.</p>

  <p>Did he tell you why it was that he was so anxious to get money on the
pawn ticket on the 20th or 21st? &mdash; He said he had no chance at present to
get it out, as he was going away.</p>

  <p>Was he very anxious to get the money? &mdash; No. He simply offered it
for &pound;4 or &pound;5 &mdash; he said he would let me have it for that
price, but he would not let others get it for that. He said he was to offer it
to Miller in a public-house in Cambridge Street.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Suppose Slater was at the Central
Station telegraph office at twelve minutes past six, can you give us any idea
how long it would take him to walk up Renfield Street and along Sauchiehall
Street to where he lived, the corner of St. George's Road? &mdash; About twenty
minutes.</p>

  <p>So that even if he went quite straight from the Central Station to St.
George's Road it would take him that time? &mdash; I think so.</p>

  <p>How long do you think he stopped in the billiard room? &mdash; About ten
minutes.</p>

  <p>So in that way he could not have arrived until after twenty minutes to
seven? &mdash; No, because he only left at 6.30.</p>

  <p>Suppose he left Johnston's billiard room at 6.30, how long would it take
him to walk at an ordinary pace? &mdash; About twenty minutes.</p>

  <p>Johnston's billiard room down to the Central Station, down Renfield
Street, is a considerable distance? &mdash; I think I could do it in about
eight minutes. Of course, Slater was a very fast walker.</p>

  <p>You have no manner of doubt at all that it was on 21st December that you
saw him there up till 6.30? &mdash; I am positive about that.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; What country was it that you and Slater came from?
&mdash; From England.</p>

  <p>You said you were a fellow-countryman of his? &mdash; Yes, German by
birth.</p>

  <p>Is Slater a German by birth? &mdash; I am not positive. I do not know
where he comes from or where he was born.</p>

  <p>You said you were a fellow-countryman of his? &mdash; He told me he was a
German.</p>

  <p>Do you know what he was trained as? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether he was ever trained to any occupation? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>I notice in the letter that was written to you there is a reference to
Karl Kunstler, Soldata, and Willy. Who are they? &mdash; People living in
Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Are they all Germans? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Who is Willy? &mdash; A little wrestler.</p>

  <p>What is his name? &mdash; Hoyne.</p>

  <p>Is Slater an English name? &mdash; As far as I know it is an English
name.</p>

  <p>Do you know what the prisoner's German name was? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You have no doubt that he has one? &mdash; I could not say.</p>

  <p>Do you know any person in Germany, of German birth, called Slater?
&mdash; I do not know.</p><br>

  <p>PETER JOHNSTON, examined by Mr. M'CLURE. I am a billiard room proprietor
in Renfield Street, Glasgow. I know the prisoner Slater. He frequented my
billiard rooms. He came to Glasgow about November. Pie w-as in the habit of
coming to my billiard rooms pretty frequently between that and the time he left
Glasgow. I do not know the names of those who came with Slater to the billiard
room. Sometimes he came himself and mixed up with the company. I know a man
called Cameron. He was in with Slater two or three times. I know Rattman and
Aumann. These are all people who were frequently about my rooms. The table at
which these people usually played was No. 6, in the far-away corner. I could
not say whether Slater was playing in my rooms on 21st December or not. I find
that table No. 6 was continuously engaged from 5.8 to 6.40. I do not remember
who were playing at that table. I was away for my tea at the time. I remember
Slater coming in on Wednesday, 23rd December, about 10.25 at night, along with
Cameron. I would ask him when he came in if he wanted a game.</p>

  <p>He said that they did not care about playing that night. They stayed on
for some time in the place.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Is it not the fact that you
saw Slater in your billiard room only twice? &mdash; I have seen him two or
three times. I have seen him more than twice.</p>

  <p>When was the first time? &mdash; I could not say &mdash; he was coming
about it for a month.</p>

  <p>Was not the first time you saw him in your rooms about 14th or 15th
December? &mdash; I do not remember the dates.</p>

  <p>Did he play the first time? &mdash; I could not really say.</p>

  <p>Did you see him, do you think, more than three times altogether? &mdash;
Yes, I would see him maybe six or eight times.</p>

  <p>From what time till what time? &mdash; He generally came in in the
evening.</p>

  <p>But can you tell us what was the earliest date, or about the earliest
date, that you saw him? &mdash; He might come in about five or six o'clock. It
was generally about eight or nine.</p>

  <p>That was in November or December? &mdash; November, I suppose.</p>

  <p>You do not know? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>On the last occasion, on 23rd December, he came in about eleven o'clock
at night? &mdash; About 10.25.</p>

  <p>And waited till midnight? &mdash; He waited till his two friends played
their game.</p>

  <p>Did you see him on 21st December at all? &mdash; I do not remember.</p>

  <p>Was he clean shaven? &mdash; I would not like to say. I rather think he
was a little dark, but he might not have very much to show. I do not know that
he was exactly clean shaven.</p>

  <p>If he had anything on his upper lip it was very little? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Except on the 23rd, had he always played any time
you saw him in the rooms before? &mdash; He played very regularly when he did
come in.</p><br>

  <p>ADAM GIBB, examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I was a billiard marker in
Johnston's employment on 21st December last. I have seen Slater at various
times in the billiard rooms, two or three times a week at least. I could not
tell the names of the friends that he played with, but I could recognise them.
Being foreign to me, I did not know their names. They were German. (Shown
witness Max Rattman.) I recognise that man as being one of his friends. (Shown
witness Josef Aumann.) I also recognise that man. I remember seeing Slater in
the billiard rooms on 23rd December about eleven o'clock at night. He was by
himself. He was not joined by somebody that I saw. I did not see Cameron that
night. I remember distinctly that he had a moustache on that night. It was
quite noticeable to me, and I was at a billiard table at the opposite end, 16
feet away. No person who had a look at him could have taken him for a clean-
shaven man that night. He appeared to me to be a man that had neglected to
shave his upper lip for about a fortnight.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; When did you first see him
coming about your saloon? &mdash; I could not specify any date. He came back
and forward for about three months.</p>

  <p>Do you remember any time when he had a full moustache? &mdash; No, never
at any time. It was always short and stubbly.</p>

  <p>Did you know or did you not know that his moustache was shaved off in the
middle of December? &mdash; I did not know.</p>

  <p>Did you see at any time during the period he was frequenting your rooms
that he had shaved his moustache off? &mdash; No; I cannot say that he did
shave it off.</p>

  <p>Did you notice at any time during the three or four months any difference
in his appearance? &mdash; There have been times that he came about the rooms
and has been playing when I probably have not looked much at him. In a public
billiard room I do not take exact stock of every one. It was always a short
moustache that he wore.</p>

  <p>You saw him going about the room in November and December, and you never
saw any change in his appearance so far as his moustache was concerned? &mdash;
I never saw much change in him.</p>

  <p>You did not observe it? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Do you say that the last time you saw him he had a stubbly moustache?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were you in the billiard room on 21st December? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>The day of the murder? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you see him there that day? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Was the table engaged upon the Monday,
as you find from your books, from 5.8 till 6.40? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is that the table, No. 6, which was usually played on by Slater and his
friends? &mdash; Yes; that was the table they generally played on.</p>

  <p>As I understand, you do not remember who was playing that afternoon?
&mdash; I cannot remember.</p><br>

  <p>JOSEF AUMANN, examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I live at 282 Buchanan
Street, Glasgow. I have known Slater from October last year. I met him first in
Gall's public-house in Cowcaddens, and I saw him sometimes after that. I
remember Slater speaking to me about going to America. He spoke to me three
weeks before about going to America. He told me that as soon as he could sell
his house he was going to America. He also told me about a letter that he had
from America, but I did not see that letter. I did not see him showing it to
anybody. Mr. Rattman told me that he had seen the letter. I did not see it
myself, but Slater told me he had received the letter. After that he came to me
and asked me to take his flat off his hands. He said that he would sell his
house, and asked me to take it. He offered to show it to me, and I said that if
I liked the house I would take it over. I went to the house to see it. I went
one evening about seven or eight o'clock, and I looked over the house and
looked at the furniture. I did not take it because my wife did not wish me to
buy a house. She would not have the house. He did not say anything to me as to
what he was going to do with it when I did not take it. He told me that he
would look out for somebody else. I remember that on 21st December I was in
Gall's public-house in Cowcaddens, about three o'clock or half-past three, and
I stayed on for some time. I played billiards that afternoon in Johnston's
billiard room, and, while I was playing, Slater came in from five o'clock to
half-past; I am not exactly sure. I played at billiards that night till about a
quarter to seven o'clock, and then I went home. Rattman did not come with me. I
had been playing with Rattman, and, while we were playing. Slater was looking
on. I think I went home by myself about a quarter to seven. I do not know
whether Slater left the billiard room to go home before I had finished playing
my game. I do not remember Slater or Rattman going out. When I left I do not
remember whether Slater was still there or whether he had left us.</p>

  <p>I must ask you again, in case there is any mistake. Can you tell me
whether Slater was for some time in the billiard room that afternoon when you
were playing billiards? &mdash; I do not think he stayed long.</p>

  <p>Can you tell me when he went out? &mdash; Yes, in the afternoon he was
there. I was with Rattman, and Slater came up and asked Rattman about this
ticket. Slater went out by himself, and by that time the game was finished.
That was some minutes before the game was finished. I think I left the billiard
room about a quarter to seven. I left a short time before I got my supper, and
I went directly from the billiard room for my supper at home. I think Slater
was away from the billiard room a short time before me. I do not think the game
was quite finished when he left. I think the game was finished a short time
after Slater went away. After Slater went away the game was finished in two or
three minutes. My house where I stay is about three minutes' walk from
Johnston's billiard room. I lived in Hope Street at that time, at the Theatre
Royal, and I walked home for my supper. The flat which Slater wished me to take
over from him is a good bit further out west; it was in St. George's Road. That
is a good way out beyond Hope Street; about ten minutes' walk further than Hope
Street. I remember on the Wednesday, after that, which was the 23rd, being in
Johnston's billiard room again, and I saw Slater again. I think that was after
closing time.</p>

  <p>Was that after the public-houses were closed? &mdash; Yes, Mr. Cameron
was with him. (Shown the witness, Hugh Cameron.) That is the gentleman I mean.
Slater sat down with his friend Cameron, and he stopped a longer time for a
drink along with his friends. I saw Slater about two times or three times in
the billiard room. I did not see him more than two or three times altogether
when he was in Glasgow. I have been with him only two or three times, but I
have seen him at other times. I saw him in black clothes. I never saw him with
light, checked trousers or with light-coloured spats. He was only in dark
clothes. He wore black boots, I think.</p>

  <p>Was it patent leather ones? &mdash; He had sometimes clean boots.</p>

  <p>Do you mean bright, shiny boots? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Did you say that Slater came
into the billiard room between five and half-past five o'clock on the afternoon
of the 21st? &mdash; Yes, I did.</p>

  <p>When he came in between five and half-past five, were you playing a game
of billiards with Rattman? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you commence the game before Slater came in? &mdash; Yes; I was
playing a game as he came in.</p>

  <p>Did Slater stop a very short time in the billiard room? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And then did he go away? &mdash; About some minutes before I finished the
game.</p>

  <p>But your game had begun before he came in? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And he came between five and half-past five? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you remember for what purpose Slater came to the billiard room?
&mdash; He came and asked Mr. Rattman about this pawn ticket for the brooch.</p>

  <p>Was his purpose in coming to the billiard room to get Rattman to give him
money for a pawn ticket? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And did Rattman refuse? &mdash; He said that he would not buy it.</p>

  <p>When Rattman said that he would not buy it, did Slater then go away?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You understood that he was going to try and get money somewhere else?
&mdash; Yes; he only spoke to me and Rattman.</p>

  <p>Just about the pawn ticket? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you look at the clock when Slater came in? &mdash; No, I do not think
so.</p>

  <p>Nor when he went out? &mdash; No, I do not think so.</p>

  <p>When did you look at the clock that night? &mdash; I never looked at the
clock.</p>

  <p>Do you recollect whether it was a wet evening; was it raining? &mdash; I
do not know.</p>

  <p>Had Slater a waterproof on? &mdash; I think he had a waterproof on in the
afternoon. I do not know whether he had a waterproof on in the billiard
room.</p>

  <p>Had he a waterproof on when he was in Gall's public-house? &mdash; Yes. I
think he had a waterproof; I cannot remember exactly.</p>

  <p>Look at No. 43 of the productions. Did you sign that card? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Is that the waterproof you have seen Slater wearing? &mdash; Yes. It is a
waterproof like his, but I do not say that is it. He had a waterproof of the
same colour.</p>

  <p>And you signed that label? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was it a waterproof like that that he was wearing that afternoon? &mdash;
Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you recollect what sort of hat he was wearing? &mdash; He had
sometimes a cap.</p>

  <p>Was it a black hat that you could pull down? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>What kind of hat was it Was it like any one of these hats? &mdash; He had
a hat sometimes like a bowler hat.</p>

  <p>Can you say what hat he had that night? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you know of him doing anything except selling jewels? &mdash; No; I
did not see Slater much.</p>

  <p>Did you know of him doing any business except selling jewels? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>Do you remember meeting him in Gall's public-house in Cowcaddens one day
in December, 1908? &mdash; Yes, with Rattman.</p>

  <p>Do you remember him offering for sale a diamond ring, with twenty-five
diamonds in it? &mdash; Yes. He showed it, and he asked me what I would give
for it. I offered him &pound;.30 or &pound;35, and he said he would not sell
it.</p>

  <p>Did you think that Slater was the owner of the house that he wanted you
to take over &mdash; did you understand he was able to sell you the house that
he asked you to buy? &mdash; I do not understand very well.</p>

  <p>Did you understand from him that if he could find a buyer for the house
he would go off to America? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you understand that he was only waiting on in Glasgow till he could
get the house taken off his hands? &mdash; I do not understand.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; What o'clock do you have supper?
&mdash; Seven o'clock, and sometimes after eight.</p>

  <p>Is seven o'clock the hour of supper in your house? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>When you left the billiard room on Monday, 21st December, was that
shortly before seven or shortly before eight? &mdash; Shortly before seven.</p>

  <p>How long, do you think, after Slater left the billiard room? &mdash; He
went away about half-past six.</p><br>

  <p>JAMES TRACEY, examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I am a porter in the
employment of the Caledonian Railway Company at the Central Station, Glasgow. I
was on night duty on Christmas Day, 1908. I remember being down about the
weighs before the 9.5 train started for London and Liverpool. I remember a
badge porter coming with a lot of luggage on his barrow. He told me that he was
waiting for the arrival of the party to whom it belonged. I saw a cab arrive
after that, about 8.45. There were a gentleman and two ladies in it. The
gentleman came out and claimed the luggage which the badge porter had. I am
quite certain they all arrived together &mdash; the three of them. I opened the
cab door, and they got out. The gentleman told me the destination of his
luggage. He told me to have it labelled for Liverpool, and that he was going by
the 9.5 train. I got luggage labels, and I labelled all the pieces of luggage.
There were nine altogether. I took the luggage up to the train; it was taken up
to the train on the badge porter's barrow. I put it on board the train. I put
it in the rear brake van of the 9.5 train.</p>

  <p>Was the rear brake van a through van for Liverpool? &mdash; Well, when I
took up the luggage I asked the guard where he would have it, and he told me to
put it into the rear van. I had told him by this time that it was destined for
Liverpool, and he told me where to put it. I do not know what tickets the
gentleman had. He asked me to send a parcel to Paris. It was a small paper
parcel, about 1 foot square. He asked me if he could have it forwarded through
to Paris, and I went to the excess clerk, and I told him that the gentleman
wanted to have it forwarded through to Paris, and the excess clerk informed me
that the parcel office was shut, but that he could have it forwarded by post,
and I told the gentleman he could have it forwarded straight from Liverpool
when he arrived there. One lady travelled with the gentleman. The gentleman had
a dark coat and a dark cap. I saw him in the train, and the tickets being
checked; he was in a compartment a few compartments from where the luggage was
placed. The other porter had let him in for some excess. He was grumbling a bit
at that.</p>

  <p>Except for the grumbling about the excess luggage he had to pay for, did
you see anything remarkable about the passenger? &mdash; No, nothing. He seemed
to be quite cool and collected, but he was annoyed at having to pay the excess;
that was the only thing.</p>

  <p>He did not seem to be hiding from anybody? &mdash; No; he told me he had
travelled all over the world, and he had never been asked to pay excess
before.</p>

  <p>But he did not seem to be wanting to escape observation? &mdash; No, he
was just the same as any other passenger. (Shown prisoner.) That is the
gentleman. The night he travelled to Liverpool he had a moustache. It was quite
noticeable.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the Lord Advocate &mdash; Did you just see him at the
station when you were putting in his baggage; had you ever seen him before?
&mdash; No, I never saw the gentleman before.</p>

  <p>And you just saw him when you were putting his baggage into the luggage
van? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And have you any difficulty at all in recognising him? &mdash; No, that
is the man there.</p>

  <p>You recognise him at once? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you notice whether he had a slight moustache or a moustache like he
has now? &mdash; He had a moustache something similar to the one he has now.</p>

  <p>Was there as much as he has now? &mdash; Yes, something similar to the
moustache Tie is wearing now.</p>

  <p>Did you know what tickets he had? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you see them examined? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Have you seen either of the ladies here? &mdash;
No.</p>

  <p>About what age was the one that went with him? &mdash; She would be a
woman about forty or thereabouts.</p>

  <p>The one that went with him? &mdash; Yes, thirty-five or forty.</p>

  <p>(Shown Andr&eacute;e Junio Antoine.) Is that the one that went with him?
&mdash; I could not say.</p>

  <p>You do not identify her? &mdash; I could not say.</p>

  <p>(Shown Catherine Schmalz.) Do you know that one? &mdash; No.</p><br>

  <p>HUGH MURPHY, examined by Mr. MAIR &mdash; I stay at City View, Larkhall.
I am a railway official at the Central Station, Glasgow. I am in charge of the
train running department books. I have examined the books for the night of 25th
December, 1908. There were two carriages for Liverpool on the 9.5 train that
night &mdash; a brake composite and brake third. One of these carriages went
direct to Liverpool and one did not; the brake third went direct to Liverpool.
That carriage would leave the London train at Wigan to go to Liverpool.</p>

  <p>Suppose passengers were in a London carriage of that train would they
have to change at Wigan? &mdash; That is the last point for changing. They
would have to change somewhere. Their luggage would have to be changed unless
it was loaded in the Liverpool carriage van. There was luggage accommodation in
the Liverpool carriage.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by Mr. MORISON &mdash; It would not be necessary with a
London ticket to travel by a London carriage? &mdash; No, not necessarily.</p>

  <p>A passenger with a London ticket might desire to go to Liverpool first,
and he could do so with his London ticket without extra charge? &mdash; He
could.</p><br>

  <p>WILLIAM KEMPTON, examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I am manager to James L.
Bryce, pawnbroker, in Oswald Street, Glasgow. I saw Slater on 3rd November. I
had known him before, about the Glasgow Exhibition year, but on this occasion I
saw him about 3rd November. I did not see him frequently between 3rd November
and the time he left; I only saw him once, when he redeemed a pledge. On the
3rd November he pledged with me two gold rings, three pearl studs, a gold
pencil-case, a gold purse, and a fountain pen, and he got &pound;5 for these
articles. He redeemed them on 13th November. He dealt with me as Oscar Slater.
The last time I saw him was on 22nd December. He called in the afternoon about
four o'clock, and he redeemed a pair of prism binocular glasses. He had pledged
them on 7th December for &pound;2 10s. When he came in he was dressed in a dark
overcoat and a hard hat. He did not seem in any way excited in his manner. Upon
Tuesday, 22nd December, he told me he was going to America.</p>

  <p>Did he say he was making any inquiries about steamers? &mdash; He
wondered whether he would go by the Anchor Line; he thought he might go by the
Anchor Line, and he asked me about that; of course we could give him no
information. I am quite certain that was on the 22nd December, because that was
the day the prism binoculars were redeemed. At that time, on the 22nd December,
he had a slight stubbly moustache. It was quite noticeable.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Did you know him in 1901?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How long was he in Glasgow then? &mdash; Well, I could not exactly say,
but most of the Exhibition time.</p>

  <p>Did you do business with him then? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What sort of business? &mdash; Pledging jewellery; he always redeemed
it.</p>

  <p>Did you know that he was a dealer in precious stones, diamonds, and
jewels? &mdash; Well, I had an idea that he was buying and selling.</p>

  <p>Where he got them you did not know? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did that business dealing between you and him continue during the time he
was in Glasgow in 1901? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Then did he disappear for some years? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And then did he reappear on the 3rd November, 1908? &mdash; That was the
first time.</p>

  <p>What address did he give on the 3rd November? &mdash; Central Hotel,
Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Did you ever know he had any other address in Glasgow during November and
December at that time? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you think that it was the Central Hotel all the time? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you notice whether on the 3rd November he had a moustache? &mdash;
No, I really could not say then.</p>

  <p>Can you say whether he had one when he was in Glasgow in 1901; did he
wear a moustache? &mdash; Well, I would say he had always a slight
moustache.</p>

  <p>Did you notice it was stubbly on the 22nd December? &mdash; Yes, just
growing.</p>

  <p>How was it he came to speak, on the 22nd December, about taking a ship
for America? &mdash; Well, I really could not say, except that it might be in
regard to saying something about these glasses he was redeeming.</p>

  <p>He wanted the binoculars for the voyage? &mdash; Well, I thought perhaps
he might want them.</p>

  <p>What did he say to you about going to America? &mdash; Oh, well, he did
not say what he was going to do when he got there.</p>

  <p>Did he say anything about the time he was going to start? &mdash; No, he
did not say.</p>

  <p>Or the line he was going by? &mdash; Well, that was all he asked about
&mdash; the Anchor Line; of course I could give him no information.</p>

  <p>Did he say. anything about where he was going to in America? &mdash; No,
he did not say definitely.</p>

  <p>Or why he was going? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You say that he was redeeming the binoculars on the 22nd? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you recollect when he pledged them on the 7th December what address he
gave? &mdash; No, his address was not asked; it was taken for granted.</p>

  <p>You just kept it on the books as it was? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I suppose you do not care what the
man's address is? &mdash; Well, we ask the address, but knowing Slater so well
we thought it was good enough at the Central Hotel.</p>

  <p>After all, he would not get his pledge back without paying you your
advances and interest? &mdash; Certainly not.</p>

  <p>And if he changes his address in the meantime it makes no difference to
you? &mdash; None to us.</p>

  <p>My learned friend always asked, "Did he disappear?" &mdash; it is an
awkward way of putting it; when my friend put the words, "Did Slater then
disappear" into your mouth, do you not just mean that he left Glasgow? &mdash;
I do not know where he went to.</p>

  <p>And when he came back he reappeared, I suppose? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were all your transactions with the man <i>bona fide</i> loans upon
property deposited? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And do you say he always redeemed by and by the goods he left with you?
&mdash; Yes.</p><br>

  <p>ANDR&Eacute;E JUNIO ANTOINE, examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I was born
in Paris, and I am now twenty-three years of age. It is about five years since
I first met Slater. I met him in the Empire Theatre in London. He was a married
man. He did not take up living with me at that time. When I met him first he
was living alone, and not with his wife. He called himself a dentist. I never
knew of him doing anything in the dentist line at all. He never worked as a
dentist so far as I am aware. He used to manage clubs. I cannot tell whether he
had any connection with clubs where cards were played in London, but I knew
that he used to go to clubs. About three years ago I went with him to America.
I was living with Slater in Brussels at that time, and we left from Boulogne
for America. Slater went to America because of his wife, as she was always
bothering him and came after him. He went to New York. In New York he managed a
club. We travelled to New York under the name of Mr. and Mrs. A. George. We
took that wrong name so that his wife might not find him. There is produced a
house agreement between Peter de Sylvestri, Oscar Slater, and John Devoto,
taking premises 114 West Twenty-Sixth Street, in the burgh of Manhattan. That
is the first place where Slater carried on business. Devoto was his partner and
de Sylvestri was his landlord. The rent was sixty dollars a month. On the first
occasion we were in America for one year, and then we returned to Paris for my
health.</p>

  <p>And to visit your people? &mdash; The principal thing was my health. We
were away from America for about two months, and then we returned under the
name of A. George. While Slater was over in America he carried on the business
of the club as Oscar Slater. We came back again to France in June, 1908. We
came to England in August, and to Glasgow in October. When we came to Glasgow
first we stayed in Renfrew Street. We were only a few days there before we got
a fiat at St. George's Road. We went to Glasgow because Slater thought that
there was good business to be done there. After we were there for some time he
found that there was no good business to be had, and he made up his mind to
return to America. He made up his mind to do so a month after we arrived in
Glasgow, somewhere about the beginning of December. When in Glasgow Slater went
about the clubs gambling. He had one or two friends who came to the house,
namely, Cameron and Reid. I never saw Rattman. Slater received a letter from
San Francisco, from John Devoto, the person who was his partner in New York,
telling him to come, that there was good business over there.</p>

  <p>Was there anything that prevented him going off at once? &mdash; Yes,
because we had the flat. I knew that he intended to leave if he got the flat
disposed of. I remember of Aumann coming up to look over the flat, but he did
not take it. Mr. Freedman, a German gentleman in London, wrote saying that if
Slater could find a place where Mrs. Freedman could live, she would come down.
Slater offered him the flat. We left Glasgow for America on 25th December.
Before we left Mrs. Freeman had arrived. She arrived on the Friday morning,
20th December. I got a postcard from the Alexandra Hotel, in Bath Street,
saying that she had arrived. I sent my servant over to tell her to come to the
flat.</p>

  <p>[At this stage the witness, feeling faint, had to leave the Court, and
the examination was adjourned.]</p><br>

  <p>CATHERINE SCHMALZ, examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I came to Glasgow from
London along with Madame Junio on 4th November. Madame Junio is the last
witness, Andr&eacute;e Junio Antoine, but she was known in London as Madame
Junio. We took up house at 136 Renfrew Street. We were about a week there
before changing to the house at St. George's Road. Oscar Slater left Glasgow on
25th December. From the time we arrived in November until that time I acted as
the servant in the house. Slater usually got up about nine o'clock or 9.. 30 in
the morning, and he sometimes went out. He was always in for lunch. He took
dinner at home at seven o'clock.</p>

  <p>Did he take dinner always at seven, or was it sometimes a little later?
&mdash; It all depended on whether I was ready with the dinner, but it was
generally at seven o'clock. I do not remember of him being away at dinner time
so long as I was there. I heard it proposed that Slater should go back to
America. That was three weeks or a month before 25th December. I remember a
gentleman coming up to look over the flat. He was a German, and I think his
name was Aumann. He came into the kitchen as well as going over the rest of the
house. His purpose in looking over the house was that he proposed taking it. If
he had taken the flat then Slater was going to America. I heard that spoken of
in the house three or four weeks before Slater left. Aumann did not take the
flat. After that fell through I heard conversation about some one named
Freedman coming from London. Slater was writing to Freedman to take over the
flat. I was not sure that he would take it, but I heard them talking about it.
I remember the Sunday before Slater left, that being Sunday, 20th December.
Slater was never out of the house on a Sunday and on that particular Sunday he
was in the house, in his dressing gown. He was at dinner in the house that
night. Reid and his little boy and Madame were also at dinner that night. I am
quite positive on that point. I know now that Monday, 21st December, was the
date of the murder that was committed.</p>

  <p>As regards Monday, was there any difference in Slater's ordinary habit of
coming home to dinner? &mdash; No; I never noticed anything.</p>

  <p>During that week was there any departure from his ordinary habit of
coming home for dinner about seven o'clock? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>On Monday, the 21st, did he come home for dinner? &mdash; Yes. I remember
two letters arriving by the morning post on Monday, 21st December. In the
afternoon, after lunch. Slater said that I could go away to London to find
another situation on the Saturday. One of the two letters came from London and
the other came from San Francisco. I do not know anything more about them than
that. Mrs. Freedman came on the Friday of that week. Mr. Slater sent me in the
morning to the Alexandra Hotel, as they had received a postcard in the morning
saying that Mrs. Freedman was at that hotel. I went over, but I did not bring
her back, because the porter told me that she was not up yet. I went back about
half an hour later, and she said that she would come directly. She came at 12.
.30. Upon that Friday preparations were being made by Mr. Slater for going
away; he was packing. Later on, about 8.20, men came or the luggage, and it was
then taken off in a barrow. We went down to the station in a cab, which we got
in Sauchiehall Street.</p>

  <p>Did anything like this happen, that you and Slater and Madame went down
to the station by separate ways? &mdash; No; we all went together. When I got
down to the station, I remember the door of the cab being opened by a porter.
After getting out of the cab I went with Madame, and Mr. Slater went for the
tickets. By and by the train left. They went to Liverpool. I got instructions
from Mr. Slater before leaving to hand over the keys to Mrs. Freedman. Mrs.
Freedman came at 10.30 on Saturday morning and got the keys of the house. I
stayed on in Glasgow till ten o'clock at night, when I took the train for
London. Before Mr. Slater left Glasgow he gave me instructions that I was to
say to any one asking where they were that they were off' to Monte Carlo. He
did not explain to me why he wanted that. At twelve o'clock at night the police
came.</p>

  <p>Did you say then that they were off to Monte Carlo? &mdash; I said I did
not know then.</p>

  <p>Did you explain to another policeman that they were off to Monte Carlo?
&mdash; Yes, on the Saturday morning.</p>

  <p>Do you know of any reason why they should have fled from Glasgow? &mdash;
Mr. Slater's wife bothered him.</p>

  <p>But do you know anything which would associate Slater with the murder of
Miss Gilchrist? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you see any change during that week from the ordinary habits of the
household? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you see any attempts to burn clothes or to wash clothes which had
been stained in any way? &mdash; No. The house went on just as usual. I am
perfectly certain that upon the Sunday night Mr. Slater dined in and was never
over the door, and upon the Monday he was home about his usual horn-. I have
seen the hammer (label No. 47). I used that to break coals with. I remember the
hammer coming into the house when we moved into the flat. It was bought upon a
card with some other tools on it, exactly like the new card that is now shown
to me. The hammer was kept in a drawer in the hat-stand in the hall. So far as
I know, the hammer was never out of the house. I never saw that hammer being
washed or scraped, or having anything done to it. About three weeks before Mr.
Slater left Glasgow he got his moustache taken off. I do not know why he had it
taken off. At the time he left Glasgow his moustache was growing again; it was
quite noticeable, and one would not have taken him for a clean-shaven man at
that time.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; Who engaged you? &mdash;
Madame Junio.</p>

  <p>Was she living then at 45 Newman Street, London? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>She received gentlemen there? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And among the gentlemen was Oscar Slater one? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Between him and who? &mdash; Madame.</p>

  <p>Did you hear him saying that to Madame? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you know at that time that he was a dentist? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>After he went to Glasgow did he write asking you and Madame to come?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did Madame ask you if you would go to Glasgow? &mdash; Mr. Slater asked
me before he went away if I would like to go to Glasgow, and I said "Yes."</p>

  <p>When you went to the house at 6U St. George's Road, did you see that he
had a brass plate on the door with the name Anderson? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you ever know him in London as Anderson? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you think it strange to see that on the door? &mdash; I thought he
took the name because his wife might not find him.</p>

  <p>Where was his wife? &mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>Did you eyer see her? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Or know anything about her? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Is she alive or dead? &mdash; I think she is alive, but I do not know.</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Who told you about her? &mdash; I heard her name
from other people.</p>

  <p>From whom? &mdash; From strange people.</p>

  <p>In Glasgow? &mdash; No, Inspector Fowler asked me if I knew where his
wife was living in London.</p>

  <p>Cross-examination continued &mdash; Was Slater quite safe from his wife
in London by the name of Slater &mdash; was he bothered in London by his wife
at 45 Newman Street living under the name Slater? &mdash; Mrs. Slater was not
living there.</p>

  <p>Why did he take the name Anderson when he went to Glasgow, when he was
safe in London with the name Slater? &mdash; Mrs. Slater did not find out where
he went to when he went to Glasgow.</p>

  <p>When you went to Glasgow, to 69 St. George's Road, did you find that he
was not a dentist there? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>So far as you know, he did no business? &mdash; Not so far as I know.</p>

  <p>Did he usually come home to dinner? &mdash; Yes, always.</p>

  <p>Was the dinner sometimes later and sometimes earlier? &mdash; Seven
o'clock was the usual hour.</p>

  <p>Was it sometimes nearly eight when he had dinner? &mdash; It was my
fault; Mr. Slater was in.</p>

  <p>But owing to your fault was it about eight o'clock before the dinner was
served? &mdash; No. Mr. Slater was in after seven and was waiting for his
dinner.</p>

  <p>How late have you seen the dinner? &mdash; Between half-past seven and
eight o'clock.</p>

  <p>Do you recollect of any particular date last December &mdash; can you

  <p>Did you read about the murder in the newspapers? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you ever hear about the murder? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>As I understand, you did not know that a murder had been committed?
&mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you know the day of the month during December? &mdash; When the

  <p>No, did you know the day of the month, any day? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>How did you know that; did you read the newspapers? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did you have a calendar beside you? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you remember what day of the week the 21st was? &mdash; On a Monday.</p>

  <p>How do you recollect that particular Monday? &mdash; Because I got notice
on the Monday.</p>

  <p>How long had you been engaged for? &mdash; I was only for a week &mdash;
a weekly engagement.</p>

  <p>What wages were you engaged at? &mdash; Eight shillings.</p>

  <p>Were you surprised to get notice to go away? &mdash; No, because I heard
Mr. Slater say that he was going to leave because he did not like Glasgow.</p>

  <p>Did he say why he did not like Glasgow? &mdash; The climate did not suit
Madame.</p>

  <p>Was that the reason why he was going to leave? &mdash; I think it was, as
far as I know.</p>

  <p>Did he say on the 21st where he was going to get a better climate for
Madame? &mdash; No, but I heard the conversation that he was going away.</p>

  <p>Was it a conversation between Madame and Slater? &mdash; Yes.</p>

did not hear the conversation between Mr. Slater and Madame Freedman.</p>

  <p>Was it before Madame Freedman came that you knew Madame was weeping
because Slater said he would not take her with him? &mdash; Mr. Slater told me
that I should speak to Madame &mdash; that the time was no good for her to
go.</p>

  <p>Did you think it curious that he should be going to San Francisco for
Madame's health and then trying to get Madame not to go with him? &mdash; I do
not know.</p>

  <p>Did you understand why it was that he wanted Madame to stay at home if he
was going to San Francisco for her health &mdash; do you understand? &mdash;
Yes, because the time was so bad that she might be ill on the way.</p>

  <p>Then you told me that he was going to San Francisco because the climate

&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you say to Monte Carlo? &mdash; Not that night.</p>

  <p>What did you say? &mdash; I do not know &mdash; that they had gone off
for a holiday.</p>

  <p>Did you know that Slater did not want you to tell anybody that he had
gone to San Francisco, only that his wife should not find where he went to?
&mdash; (No answer.)</p>

  <p>By the COURT &mdash; Did he give that as a reason why you were to say
that he had gone to Monte Carlo &mdash; that his wife might not find out?
&mdash; No; I thought so.</p>

  <p>But he did not say so? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>For some reason or another, did you know that he did not want to tell
anybody that he had gone to San Francisco? &mdash; I do not know the reason.</p>

  <p>Did he not tell you? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Did he not tell you that you were to say that he had gone to Monte Carlo?
&mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he give you any reason? &mdash; No.</p>

o'clock? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Do you remember him telling you that if Cameron came that he (Slater) had
gone out? &mdash; That he was not in.</p>

  <p>Do you remember Cameron calling at eight o'clock? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Were you taking in the dinner at that time? &mdash; They had had
dinner.</p>

  <p>When Cameron called at eight o'clock, did you tell him that Slater was
not in? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Was Slater in? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did he give you any reason why he did not want to see Cameron that night?
&mdash; No.</p>

  <p>You say that he had shaved off his moustache &mdash; how long before he
went away? &mdash; A fortnight.</p>

  <p>Do you know whether he had shaved it a second time? &mdash; No, I do not
think so.</p>

  <p>Was it just stubbly? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>At the time that he went away? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; No person could fail to see it?
&mdash; I do not know.</p>

  <p>The moustache that he had was one that you could not help seeing? &mdash;
You could see it easily.</p>

  <p>You say that Madame broke down and was crying because she was not to be
taken to San Francisco? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you hear that matter discussed between Slater and Madame &mdash;
speaking about it at all? &mdash; If Mr. Slater was going, I should tell Madame
not to go, because the time was too rough, and she might come later on.</p>

  <p>ANDR&Eacute;E JUNIO ANTOINE &mdash; Examination resumed &mdash; A postcard
had arrived in the morning, and the result was that I sent over for Mrs.
Freedman. She did not come the first time, and I sent the maid back again, and
then she came.</p>

  <p>Would you tell me how it was that Mrs. Freedman came down to Glasgow from
London? &mdash; I think she wanted to stay for a time in Scotland. There was an
arrangement made that if she came down she would get the flat.</p>

  <p>Was Slater anxious to get the flat off his own hands at that time?
&mdash; Not so very anxious.</p>

  <p>But was he wishing to go away from Glasgow? &mdash; Yes; to San
Francisco. This had been spoken of for some time before the 20th. I remember
Sunday, the 20tli, which was the last Sunday that we were in Scotland. Mr.
Slater was not out that day. The time he was in Scotland he never went out any
Sunday. Mr. Reid and his little boy came to see Mr. Slater about six o'clock on
that Sunday, and they remained till 10.45. The ordinary dinner hour was seven
o'clock; it was always ordered for that, but it was sometimes as late as ten
minutes. Mr. Slater always dined at home; he never missed his dinner.</p>

  <p>On Monday, the 21st, or on any other day during the last week that you
were in Glasgow, did he depart from his ordinary practice of dining at seven
o'clock? &mdash; No, he always dined at seven o'clock. There was no day that he
missed having his dinner at home. I did not notice any difference in his manner
on any day during that week. I do not know of any clothes belonging to Mr.
Slater having been washed that week. I do not know of any clothes having been
burned or anything of that kind at all.</p>

  <p>Did you see anything at all that would lead you to believe that he had
any hand in this affair that happened on the 21st? &mdash; Oh, no! I did not
see any change in his ordinary habits. After dining at seven o'clock he usually
went out. I do not know where he went, but I have heard from him where he had
been at times. He did not tell me where he was going as a rule. Two letters
were received on the Monday morning, one being from San Francisco and the oth6r
from London. The letter from London was from a friend of Mr. Slater, Mr.
Rogers, saying that Mr. Slater's wife was still bothering him for money. Mr.
Rogers had paid her money on frequent occasions for Mr. Slater. The letter from
San Francisco was from John Devoto, saying that there was very good business
there, and to go there. There had been a previous letter from Devoto. After
receiving these letters Mr. Slater gave Catherine Schmalz notice on the Monday.
When he received the letters he said that he was going to America, and in the
afternoon he gave notice to Schmalz. On that day he wrote for money from the
Post Office Savings Bank. I do not remember whether he got that money later on
in the week. I knew about his raising some money upon a diamond brooch. That
brooch was mine. It was given to me by Mr. Slater about two years ago. I began
to pack up myself on the Friday afternoon at four o'clock, and Mr. Slater
packed some time in the morning, after Mrs. Freedman went away. Mr. Slater said
I was to go home to my people in Paris, but I did not wish to do that; I wished
to go with him. The girl Schmalz also spoke to me, and said that I should go to
my people. In the end I said that I would go with Mr. Slater, and he said that
I could go with him. One reason he gave for not wanting to take me was the bad
weather in America at the time; it was not good for my health to travel in the
winter season. He said that I could go to him in the summer time; but I wished
to go with him. A man came up to our house to take away our luggage to the
station, and he took it away in a barrow. Mr. Slater, Schmalz, and I walked to
Charing Cross, Sauchiehall Street, and took a four-wheeler there and drove to
the station. It is not the case that we all went away separately. I remember
when we arrived at the station a porter came and opened the door of the cab,
and we came out. I went to buy some newspapers for the journey. Mr. Slater and
I left for Liverpool, while Schmalz went back to the flat. She had instructions
to hand over the keys of the flat to Mrs. Freedman.</p>

  <p>Were you present when Slater gave Schmalz instructions to tell any person
who asked that you were off to Monte Carlo? &mdash; I cannot remember that. I
think he said that if any one called for him to say he was in Monte Carlo.</p>

  <p>Have you any notion why he did not want it to be known where he was
going? &mdash; In the first place, because of his wife; and, secondly, in case
of the landlord of the house and the furniture company bothering Mrs. Freedman
about the flat. I have seen the hammer (label 47). The maid used that hammer
for breaking the coals. It was not used for anything else. I remember that it
was bought when we took the house in St. George's Road. It was bought on a card
with a number of other articles. It was not washed or scraped in any way to my
knowledge. I never saw Mr. Slater washing his waterproof. I never saw him doing
anything which might be supposed to be concealing stains upon his clothes. His
conduct during that last week in Glasgow was in no way different from his
ordinary conduct. I knew that during that last week he was making inquiry at
shipping offices. I never knew of him having any checked trousers or light-
coloured spats. He had a moustache when he left for America; it was quite a
noticeable moustache. I do not think that any person seeing him could have
mistaken him for a clean-shaven man at that time.</p>

  <p>The LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I have no questions to ask.</p>

  <p class="cp">The Court adjourned at a quarter to seven o'clock.</p>

  <h2><a id="day4" name="day4">FOURTH DAY &mdash; THURSDAY, 6TH MAY,
1909</a></h2>

  <p class="cp">The Court met at ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>SAMUEL REID, examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I am acquainted with the
prisoner Slater. I was in Glasgow when Slater came to the city, about the
beginning of November last year. I met him in Hope Street. When I met him he
had not taken the flat at 69 St. George's Road; he was staying in Renfrew
Street. He told me he was taking a flat at St. George's Road. I was up in that
house before the furniture was put in, and I saw the house. At the time the
furniture was put into the house I put in two sacks of coal. After they were
living in the house I was there on the Sundays. I remember the Sunday before
Christmas. I left for Belfast on the Monday before Christmas, that being
Monday, the 21st December. I went to the house on Sunday, the 20th, at six
o'clock, and I stayed there till about 10.30. I dined with Slater. I had my
little boy with me. I have got a little girl as well. There was a Sunday before
that when I was in the house and dined with Slater, and had both my children
there. The latest I would leave on the 20th would be 10.30, but any other
Sunday I stopped a bit later. During the time I was in the house on the 20th
Slater was there. My little boy is getting on for five years old. After the
murder the Glasgow police followed me to Belfast. They saw me there, and I made
a statement, and told them that I had been in Slater's house on the Sunday. On
the day when I was dining with Slater his moustache was growing. It was very
noticeable. His hair, of course, is very black, and I do not think that any
person could have mistaken him for a clean-shaven man.</p>

  <hr>

  <p>DR. WILLIAM GEORGE AITCHISON ROBERTSON, examined by Mr. M'CLURE&mdash; I
am a Doctor of Medicine, a Doctor of Science of the University of Edinburgh,
and a Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and of the Royal Society of
Edinburgh. I have specialised in medical jurisprudence, and have lectured on it
for the last twelve years, and I am the author of a work upon medical
jurisprudence. I examine in that subject for the Royal College of Physicians. I
have had submitted to me certain productions in this case, a skin rug, a carpet
rug, a claw hammer, and a waterproof coat. I have read the medical reports of
Dr. Glaister and Dr. Galt. I read also the medical report of Dr. Glaister and
Dr. Littlejohn as regards the tests for blood. Looking to the extent of the
injuries inflicted upon this woman, Miss Gilchrist, I think the sort of
instrument used was some blunt weapon. The hammer produced does not strike me
in the least as being a likely one, because the multiplicity of wounds and
their extent is out of all proportion to the size of the hammer. The hammer is
a very light one. Of course, theoretically, if a light hammer is wielded with
terrific force, it may cause injuries which a heavier weapon would with less
force, but from the very extensive smashing of the skull, I would consider that
this small hammer is a very unlikely weapon. I examined that hammer for blood
stains, and there are no blood stains upon it. I see under the head of it some
material which looks like coal dust.</p>

  <p>Do you see anything which suggests to you that the top of the hammer, the
upper part of the handle, has been washed or scraped? &mdash; No appearance
whatever of either having been washed or scraped, but the lower part somewhat
dirtied by being held in a dirty hand. That is all I can discover about the
handle.</p>

  <p>Have you made as careful an examination as you could for the purpose of
detecting the presence of blood corpuscles upon it? &mdash; I have not, but I
see that there are no clots of blood upon it, absolutely no appearance of blood
whatever, even in the crevices, where it might have lodged, where it would be
impossible almost to remove it by washing or scraping. There is absolutely no
sign of scraping. The hammer has absolutely no signs of blood about it.</p>

  <p>Would the murderer who carried through this murder be likely to have
blood upon his clothes? &mdash; I should think he would be bespattered
thoroughly with blood. I say so because of the injuries, which would splash up
blood on the surrounding objects for a very considerable distance. I am
informed that the fire-irons had blood over them, that there was a considerable
quantity upon the coal scuttle, that the hearth rug had a great deal of blood
upon it, and that the tablecloth, which was hanging down the table on the other
side of the body, had a considerable amount of blood upon it.</p>

  <p>Do you think it would be possible for a person who knelt upon the body
and smashed at the face with the implement to escape considerable blood
marking? &mdash; I should think he would be more or less covered with blood. I
have looked at the waterproof coat (production No. 43). I have found no signs
of blood whatever upon it. Supposing the murderer had done the deed with that
coat on, I certainly agree that the outside of the coat should be much marked
with blood. I would expect that.</p>

  <p>Would you expect that his clothes, and about his wrists and the ends of
his sleeves where his hands were, would probably show signs of blood, almost
certainly? &mdash; Certainly.</p>

  <p>Suppose he had concealed the instrument with which this was done in his
pockets, would you expect to find blood in the pockets? &mdash; There are no
signs whatever of blood in the pockets. If he had done this with his ordinary
clothes on and then put on the coat, I would expect to find the inside of the
coat showing blood deeply. I have made an examination, and I find no trace of
blood whatever. There are some small spots on the coat; larger ones have been
cut out, and therefore I have not seen them. They are not produced here at
all.</p>

  <p>From the spots that are on the coat, is there any one of them indicative
of blood? &mdash; Not in the least resembling blood stains. The coat showed no
signs whatever, so far as I can make out, of having been washed.</p>

  <p>Were those stains which were upon it stains that looked as if something
had dropped on the coat and there remained? &mdash; They might have been drips
from an umbrella, or mud stains.</p>

  <p>But you do not think in any way characteristic of blood? &mdash; Not in
any way characteristic of blood. There is no spreading of the stains which I
can see as if water had been applied. They are quite clean where they occur,
and are quite distinct. I also examined the auger (production No. 26). The
result of my examination of it is, that the upper part &mdash; at least the
part nearest the hands, not the curling bit, but the plain bit, and the upper
circles here (indicating) &mdash; are much more corroded with rust than is the
lower part; and an examination of a part of this deep corrosion yields the
presence of one test for blood. I cannot say definitely whether there is blood
on that or not. I have no theory as to how the grey hair became attached to
it.</p>

  <p>Do you think that it is a likely weapon to cause the wounds which you
have described? &mdash; Of the two it is more likely to have caused the wounds
than the hammer, but I do not think it is the instrument. I should expect to
find an instrument of heavier weight than that. There was a skin rug laid over
the top of the head of Miss Gilchrist, with long hairs; there was a
considerable amount of blood upon the hairy side of that rug, which I was led
to understand was next the body.</p>

  <p>Did you find blood upon the other side of it, on the top? &mdash; There
are a few stains, one large one, about 1&frac12; inches square, with from it a
trail of three or four drops, as if it had dropped from perhaps the coat of the
assailant.</p>

  <p>If only one side of the rug was in contact with the body, what would you
expect to have caused the stains on the other side? &mdash; It could only be
droppings from something. That is only a surmise.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; I understand that your
evidence is given entirely upon the facts disclosed in Professor Glaister's
report? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>I suppose you would agree that the two medical gentlemen who actually saw
the body, and saw the wounds, would be in a much better position to judge than
you who only read their report? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You offer the opinion that because of the multiplicity and the extent of
the wounds you do not think the hammer could do it? &mdash; I do.</p>

  <p>What do you judge to be the number of blows inflicted? &mdash; That would
be impossible to say.</p>

  <p>What would you judge to be the number of wounds inflicted? &mdash; I
think they are narrated in the report given.</p>

  <p>Do you infer from the report that the old lady's face and head were
simply battered in? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Did you notice that a number of wounds were spindle-shaped? &mdash; I
did.</p>

  <p>Did you observe that one of the blows, at all events, had just driven in
the left eyeball? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Leaving a round hole? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Must that, therefore, have been done by a probably rounded instrument of
comparatively small diameter, driven straight in? &mdash; I see the wound to
which you refer is 2 inches by &frac34; of an inch; that, of course, is much
larger than the head of the hammer we have here.</p>

  <p>Do you say that if the hammer was wielded by a powerful hand and a rapid
succession of blows struck with it by a powerful hand on the head of a lady
over eighty-three years of age, these wounds could not have been inflicted?
&mdash; It is possible, but not probable.</p>

  <p>What instrument do you think would be more likely? &mdash; I should think
a heavy poker.</p>

  <p>Do you mean a long instrument? &mdash; It might be long or short; it
might be a crowbar.</p>

  <p>Beating with it? &mdash; Beating and thrusting with it.</p>

  <p>By a crowbar you mean a bar about 2 or 3 feet long? &mdash; It may be any
length.</p>

  <p>Well, the usual crowbar is 2 or 3 feet long? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>You think that might be it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>With the head of the hammer, and with the hammer turned sideways, and by
the use of the claws of the hammer, could not all the wounds that you have seen
described in the report have been inflicted? &mdash; No, I cannot see how these
spindle-shaped wounds could ever have been inflicted by the hammer.</p>

  <p>Do you not see how with the claws of the hammer it could be done? &mdash;
Then there would be a portion of skin between; each claw would make its own
injury.</p>

  <p>Have you measured carefully the claws of the hammer? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And the distance between the claws? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>What are your measurements? &mdash; I have not got them here, but I have
compared them with the wounds that are described, and the wounds do not in the
least degree appear to me to correspond to the injuries which might be
inflicted by the claw end of the hammer.</p>

  <p>But you would not expect, would you, that they would leave the exact
marks of the claws of the hammer on the face or head? &mdash; I should think
that we should have at least had some that would show the direct impression of
the claw end.</p>

  <p>Do you mean with a rain of thirty or forty blows? &mdash; I do.</p>

  <p>When did you examine the hammer? &mdash; On Friday and Saturday of last
week, on 30th April and 1st of May.</p>

  <p>Do you say that about halfway down the shaft, the shaft of the hammer has
no appearance of having been scrubbed, or the surface of the wood of the hammer
having been roughened and bleached? &mdash; Yes, I say that.</p>

  <p>Is there no difference to your eye between the half near the head and the
half near the handle? &mdash; Do you mean in colour?</p>

  <p>Yes? &mdash; Certainly there is the dirty end of it.</p>

  <p>And do you see no evidence of scraping or scrubbing? &mdash; None.</p>

  <p>Or of the wood having been roughened or bleached? &mdash; It is natural.
If you look at any ordinary hammer you will see that in the wood.</p>

  <p>Did you make any test for the purpose of ascertaining whether there was
any blood? &mdash; I did not.</p>

  <p>Are blood stains easily removed by water? &mdash; If they are immediately
removed they are, but not when the blood clots or coagulates.</p>

  <p>But if they are treated afterwards with water, are not blood stains very
easily removed? &mdash; By no means; they are exceedingly difficult to remove,
and in the soft wood of this hammer they would be very difficult to remove
indeed.</p>

  <p>If you take the waterproof coat or the head of the hammer, what would be
the best means of removing blood stains? &mdash; A little cold water, or cold
water in which a little salt has been dissolved.</p>

  <p>And will that effectually remove them? &mdash; It would not effectually
remove them; it would remove a few of the corpuscles.</p>

  <p>Would you be able by analysis to find traces of the blood if, shortly
after, the blood on the hammer or on the coat had been treated as you have
described? &mdash; I think so.</p>

  <p>How? &mdash; Do you mean me to describe the tests for blood?</p>

  <p>No; I mean, suppose it is treated effectually as you have described with
water or with water and salt, would you still find traces of the blood? &mdash;
Yes, in a hammer such as this, which is full of crevices, it would be
impossible to wash the blood clots out from those crevices.</p>

  <p>Suppose that the man took means with water and salt to remove the blood
from the crevices, do you say that could not be done? &mdash; I should think it
almost impossible to be done, and if the hammer head were removed one would
then find underneath the flanges evidence of the blood.</p>

  <p>Then is it your evidence that once you get the blood on the hammer you
cannot effectively remove it with water, even with water mixed with salt?
&mdash; Unless it is immediately removed. If the hammer was put immediately
under a water tap then it might be washed off with the water.</p>

  <p>That would do it? &mdash; I do not say it would; I say that it might do
it.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Your conclusions really agree with the
conclusion of Professor Glaister and Professor Littlejohn? &mdash; Perhaps you
will state what they are.</p>

  <p>You have seen their report where they say that they cannot state
positively that there are blood corpuscles? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>You find no trace thereof whatsoever? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>Look at that card with a hammer and other implements upon it, and take it
from me that this was bought at the same shop as the other hammer, and that
similar implements were upon another card containing the hammer produced in the
present case, do you see a general similarity between the shafts of the two
hammers? &mdash; A very great similarity.</p>

  <p>Can you really say anything more than this, that the older hammer is
dirtier? &mdash; It has been used.</p>

  <p>It is dirtier at the lower end than at the upper end? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>In fact, where the hand would be it is dirtier than higher up? &mdash;
That is so.</p>

  <p>Is not that the whole matter? &mdash; That is so.</p>

  <p>Dr. ALEXANDER VEITCH, examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; I am a Bachelor of
Medicine and Master of Surgery of Edinburgh University. I have been in practice
for almost nineteen years. I have had very many cases of injuries to the human
body to investigate. I do not hold any appointments, but several firms of
lawyers employ me to investigate accidents and alleged accidents. I have
examined the productions in this case, especially the hammer, for blood. I
found absolutely no appearance of blood whatsoever, I read the medical reports
as to the injuries inflicted upon the body of Miss Gilchrist. I consider the
hammer that has been produced to be an unlikely instrument to inflict the
extensive injuries which are narrated in the report. My opinion is that it is
quite impossible to determine either the size, the shape, or the weight of the
instrument that would produce such injuries. From the injuries I could not
myself say what the instrument was that was used.</p>

  <p>Professor Glaister suggested that not only that hammer but other hammers
or crowbars might have inflicted the injuries. Do you agree with that opinion?
&mdash; Yes. I would suggest that a piece of a crowbar or a larger hammer would
be more likely to have produced the injuries, but what instrument was used I
really cannot say.</p>

  <p>Supposing that hammer were used, could it possibly have inflicted the
injuries? &mdash; I should say conceivably, but there is absolutely no evidence
in my mind to support it. In my opinion it is not a likely instrument. I
examined the coat which has been produced, and which belongs to the prisoner. I
inspected it for blood stains. Considering the amount of blood that was
scattered in the neighbourhood of Miss Gilchrist's body, the assailant could
not escape getting a good deal of blood on his own person, because he must have
been kneeling, or standing, or resting with one knee upon the chest of the old
lady. Being told that Professor Glaister's theory is that the assailant was
kneeling upon the body of Miss Gilchrist, and inflicting blows upon her head
while in that position &mdash; I think he would be certain to come in for a
good deal of blood splashing. If he was wearing that coat at the time, or if he
put it on afterwards, it was bound to have shown marks of blood. I have seen no
semblance of a blood stain on the coat &mdash; there is no stain with the
characteristic appearances of a blood stain. Such slight markings as are on the
coat are not of the appearance of blood. I examined the inside of the coat, the
pockets, and the sleeve, and nowhere did I find any trace of blood whatsoever.
The coat, so far as I could see, showed no signs of having been washed. The
stains which were on the coat showed no signs of having been tampered with
water. If water had been applied to the stains I think there would have been
some appearance indicative that washing had been attempted. I would have
expected certain appearances which are not there. I should have expected that
the outer ring of the stain would have been denser than the centre. If the
washing had gone to any extent the outer ring of the stain would have been
indefinite. Such stains as are on the coat are quite distinct, and I would say
that they are untampered with. To the best of my belief they are not blood. I
found no traces of blood about the hammer. I am of opinion that it has neither
been washed nor scraped. Close up to the end of the shaft the handle has been
gripped more frequently, and there is an appearance of coal dust near the
hammer head which would give a difference to the staining along the shaft. It
is dirtier and blacker towards the lower end where the person chipping the
coals would be clutching it. I saw some rust on the hammer, but there is
absolutely nothing to suggest to me that that rust is blood in any form at all.
Supposing that this hammer had been wielded by the assailant, and Miss
Gilchrist's head was smashed, as we know it was, by many blows, the hammer
necessarily would have had a lot of blood about its head and probably all over.
I see no signs of scraping or scrubbing on the lower portion of the handle. If
the assailant was wielding this weapon his hands would probably be bloody, and
I should expect to see some sign of that on the lower part of the handle. There
is no sign of scraping or scrubbing whatsoever. I am certainly dealing with
probabilities here.</p>

  <p>Cross-examined by the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; From your examination of the
report how many blows did you think were struck? &mdash; It is impossible to
tell.</p>

  <p>Would you judge that there had been a great many blows struck? &mdash; A
good many.</p>

  <p>Have you ever, in your experience, seen a case where there was such an
amount of mauling? &mdash; Never.</p>

  <p>In your judgment, must it have been effected by a succession of blows?
&mdash; I should expect so.</p>

  <p>The assailant probably kneeling on the body of the victim? &mdash;
Probably.</p>

  <p>Do you judge it was in that way that the fractures of the ribs and breast
bone were caused? &mdash; That is my theory.</p>

  <p>Are you in as good a position to judge of the appearance of the wounds as
the men who made the examination? &mdash; Certainly not.</p>

  <p>Did you, in trying to conjecture what sort of implement had been used,
come to the conclusion that it was a large instrument or a small one? &mdash; I
thought it more likely to be something of the nature of a crowbar &mdash; I
mean a portion of a crowbar, or a piece of railing, or something of that sort
&mdash; a blunt instrument.</p>

  <p>And used in two different ways by beating and thrusting? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>That would have done it? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you say conceivably the hammer, wielded by a powerful hand, would do
it? &mdash; Conceivably, but unlikely. I should have thought of a larger
hammer.</p>

  <p>The shape of the instrument would do, but you think not the size? &mdash;
I could not go that length.</p>

  <p>What length do you go? You said you thought a larger hammer would have
been necessary. How much larger do you think? &mdash; I thought you dissociated
shape from size.</p>

  <p>I thought you said that you would have expected a larger hammer? &mdash;
Of course the shape of the thing depends on the size.</p>

  <p>Certainly, to some extent. Describe to us the kind of hammer that you
think, judging from the report, would have been sufficient? &mdash; Nearly
twice as large as that hammer.</p>

  <p>Would not a smaller hammer, if wielded by a powerful hand upon a very old
lady, have effected the same purpose? &mdash; No, I should have expected
different wounds.</p>

  <p>You mean different in shape? &mdash; I should have expected a class of
fracture that is not present in this case.</p>

  <p>What class of fracture would you have expected to have been produced by a
lighter hammer? &mdash; A depressed fracture, penetrating, and of comparatively
small size.</p>

  <p>Would not that again depend on the number of blows struck? &mdash; I
should expect that any one wielding a hammer for that purpose would strike to
the best of his effort at every stroke.</p>

  <p>I suppose you made no analysis of the stains found either on the coat or
on the hammer? &mdash; No, I made none.</p>

  <p>And do you agree that water used immediately afterwards would remove the
blood stains very effectually? &mdash; Very effectually.</p>

  <p>Re-examined by Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; You had no opportunity of seeing this
body? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p>Miss Gilchrist was buried a long time before you were brought into
connection with this case? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>And you are giving your evidence on a criticism of the report that has
been lodged from the experience which you have gained? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p class="cp">The evidence for the defence was then closed.</p>

  <h2><a id="addr1" name="addr1">THE LORD ADVOCATE'S ADDRESS TO THE
JURY</a></h2>

  <p>The LORD ADVOCATE then addressed the jury as follows: &mdash; May it
please your lordship &mdash; Gentlemen of the jury, on the evening of the 21st
December last a lady, upwards of eighty-three years of age, who had, so far as
we know, not a single enemy in the world, was found murdered in her own dining-
room, under circumstances of such savage ferocity as to beggar all description.
There are no rival or conflicting theories in this case as to the way in which
this aged and defenceless lady met her tragic end. She was literally battered
to death by her assailant, who knelt on the body of his victim whilst he was
inflicting a rain of fatal blows. I say, gentlemen, that the hand which dealt
these blows was the hand of the prisoner, and I hope to be able to satisfy you
that he, and he alone, was the perpetrator of an act of savagery which happily
finds few, if any, parallels in the annals of crime. Up to yesterday afternoon
I should have thought that there was one serious difficulty which confronted
you &mdash; the difficulty of conceiving that there was in existence a human
being capable of doing such a dastardly deed. Gentlemen, that diffIculty, I
think, was removed yesterday afternoon when we heard from the lips of one who
seemingly knew the prisoner better than any one else, who had known him longer
and known him better than any witness examined, that he had followed a life
which descends to the very lowest depths of human degradation, for, by the
universal judgment of mankind, the man who lives upon the proceeds of
prostitution has sunk to the lowest depths, and all moral sense in him has been
destroyed and has ceased to exist. That difficulty removed, I say without
hesitation that the man in the dock is capable of having committed this
dastardly outrage, and the question for you to consider is whether or not the
evidence has brought it home to him.</p>

  <p>Now, the motive for the crime is as plain as daylight. This old lady,
living in a plain, simple, and unostentatious way, as you have had described,
with only a single servant, living in a respectable house, though no doubt a
comparatively small house, had an exceptionally and inordinately large number
of jewels. This seems to have been her only extravagance. At the time of her
death, according to the evidence given before you, she was actually possessed
of and had in her house jewels to the value of upwards of &pound;1380, jewels
which, if bought in a shop in the ordinary way, would have cost no less than
&pound;3000. It was so remarkable that it had become as it were the tittle
tattle of the neighbourhood that she was possessed of these valuable jewels; it
was not money in the house, it was this exceptional possession held by this
lady living in this simple and defenceless way. We shall see in the sequel how
it was that the prisoner came to know that she was possessed of these
jewels.</p>

  <p>If you will turn with me and examine for a few minutes the bare outlines,
the undisputed facts, of this case, I believe you will find that they yield six
or seven priceless inferences to enable you to form a judgment on the case.
Gentlemen, the old lady and her servant were the only inmates of the house, a
house situated in a respectable and very quiet and not much frequented street
in the West End of Glasgow. The house was one stair up, and it was the only
occupied house on that stair, there being no inhabitants in the house above at
this time. The habits of the two inmates were simple and regular, almost
monotonous. The old lady had a few visitors, but practically no male visitors.
Her servant was, as a rule, the only other occupant of the house, and former
servants seem to have been almost her only visitors to the house. The practice
of the servant was to go out in the evenings about seven o'clock to do the
messages and to fetch the old lady her newspaper. On the night of 21st December
last the servant left as usual to get the newspaper and to come back with it,
and then to go out for the rest of the messages. There were three locks on the
door of the stairhead, two of which were opened by the latch keys which the
servant had with her as a rule. The door at the foot of the stair, out of the
close, as the Glasgow people would say. was locked by one key. That door at the
closemouth could be opened by means of a handle, you will remember, close by
the dining-room door inside the house. The servant took her latch keys with her
as usual, and left the outer door of the close on the check, closed, so that no
one could enter without the key unless the occupant of the house admitted him.
According to the evidence she was out and away from the house for the best part
of ten minutes. She had only to go to St. George's Road to buy the newspaper
and come back. She met some one on the road and that detained her. She had left
her mistress sitting at the dining-room table, with her back to the fire,
reading a magazine. When she came back she found the outer door of the
closemouth open, and when she ascended the stair she found, standing at the
door of her house, her neighbour, Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams told her that there was
something wrong inside, that he had heard noises down below, and had come up;
he had rung at the door, and the door was not opened. They were both,
therefore, on the alert; they both knew to expect something unusual, something
wrong. The servant maid thought the sounds were possibly those of the clothes-
line pulleys. She opened the door and immediately stepped inside &mdash; Mr.
Adams was just at the threshold &mdash; when there emerged from the bedroom
door a man. The bedroom was lighted; it had been left in darkness when the
servant went out. The man walked steadily, deliberately, from the bedroom door
to the outer door, and passed the servant and Mr. Adams. Immediately he passed,
he darted down the stair at full speed. "When he had reached the closemouth he
glanced to the east along St. George's Road, turned to the west, and ran along
West Princes Street, westwards. A few yards from the door he knocked against a
little girl and pushed past her, and turned down West Cumberland Street. He
must have doubled on his path probably more than once, because between 7.30 and
8 o'clock he appeared at the Kelvinbridge Subway Station, which could have been
reached in some seven or ten minutes' walking, and with running could easily
have been reached in some five minutes. Probably he cannot have gone directly.
He dashed past the turnstile and downstairs to the Subway, and probably caught
a passing train. The man who passed Mr. Adams, and the servant girl, and the
girl on the street, and the girl at the Subway, had nothing in his hands. There
were no marks upon him to distinguish him from other men. The only feature
about him was this, that he held his hands in his pockets, close to his side;
his waterproof coat was open, and he held his hands in his pockets, pressing
them to his sides. It is certain that the murderer took the weapon with which
he inflicted the blows into the house with him, it is certain he took it out of
the house with him, it is certain it was of a size which would go into his
pocket. "When the servant girl and Mr. Adams rushed to the dining-room they
there found the old lady drawing her last breath upon the floor, with her head
towards the fire and her feet towards the door, the fire-irons all round
undisturbed, not a weapon or implement of any kind left in the room, the fire-
irons bespattered with blood. They found that the lady had been done to death.
The medical examination, made a short time afterwards, showed unmistakably that
her assailant knocked her down, and had knelt with his knees upon her body,
fractured her ribs and her breast bone, and there, whilst kneeling upon her
prostrate body, absolutely and literally rained blows oh her face and head in
rapid succession. The doctors who saw and examined the old lady say that the
blows must have been inflicted by a powerful hand, wielding probably, as they
judge from the appearance of the wounds, a hammer. From the appearance of
certain wounds, some of them being spindle-shaped, one of them having simply
driven in an eyeball, they judged that the deed must have been done, not by a
big coal hammer, but a small hammer, and they say that the hammer found in the
prisoner's possession afterwards was an implement with which, wielded by a
powerful hand, all the blows and the injuries which they saw could have been
inflicted. When Mr. Adams and the servant girl went to the bedroom, where the
gas had been lit, they found that a box had been opened in which the old lady
had kept merely her papers. These papers were scattered about the floor. They
found that one brooch, which the servant proved had been left, was taken away:
&mdash; a valuable brooch &mdash; and a ring which was not of much value had
been left. The rest of the old lady's jewels, which she kept in her wardrobe
amongst her clothes and otherwise, were left untouched. Obviously the assailant
had been disturbed before his work was complete.</p>

  <p>Now, these are the bald, plain, undisputed facts, and from these facts
you can draw the following priceless inferences:&mdash;</p>

  <p>(1) That the murder was coolly and deliberately planned and executed by
no bungler, but by a daring, clever, cold-blooded, expert performer.</p>

  <p>(2) The murder was accomplished by a man who was familiar with the
neighbourhood and with the surrounding streets.</p>

  <p>(3) It was accomplished by a man who had familiarised himself with the
number and character of the inmates of the house, and with their habits and
ways.</p>

  <p>(4) It was accomplished by a man who had watched and knew the movements
of the policemen on the beat.</p>

  <p>(5) It was accomplished by a man who had taken his weapon with him, and
taken his weapon away from the house.</p>

  <p>(6) It was accomplished by a man who was on the hunt for jewels &mdash;
not money &mdash; and who knew how to deal with jewels, how to make away with
them when he got them. Jewels are difficult things for those who are not
experts to handle if they do not come by them by honest means.</p>

  <p>(Last) It was accomplished by a man who was not familiar with the place
in which the jewels were kept, who had never been in the house, and therefore
was not familiar with more than the fact that there were jewels there, and that
he had to find them when his deed was done.</p>

  <p>Are there any of the inferences, think you, that clash with the evidence
which we have heard in this case relating to the prisoner? Are there any of
these characteristic qualifications of the hypothetical murderer which the
prisoner has not? There are none. He was a man who was well acquainted with
this locality and the streets round about. He had frequented clubs in the
immediate vicinity six or seven years ago. He had taken a house early in
November within three minutes' walk of this old lady's house in West Princes
Street. I will show by and by that he was a man well acquainted, not only with
the habits of the inmates of the house and the movements of the police outside,
but he was a man who knew about jewels, and was accustomed to handle jewels. In
his pocket book was found a card which intimated at one time or another that he
was a dealer in diamonds and precious stones. We know from the earliest date
that we know anything at all about him &mdash; to wit, back in 1901 &mdash;
that he was dealing in jewels and precious stones. We know in this case that
that was the way in which he raised money during all the weeks he was staying
in Glasgow. He went to Jackson, on the South Side, and raised money upon a
ring. He goes to M'Laren and raises money three times on a brooch. He tries to
sell the pawn ticket for the brooch, and he tries to raise money on it.</p>

  <p>We hear of him in no other connection but in connection with diamonds and
jewels. When he leaves the place there comes a letter from some gentleman named
Jacobs, in New York, telling him that he will send him over emeralds when he
can get the money for them, and he bids him when he comes over bring as many as
he can. We hear a great deal in the case about his dealing with jewels from the
selling point of view, but we hear nothing about his dealings with jewels from
the purchasing point of view. You will observe that none of these gentlemen was
able to give you any account of how he had come into possession of these
jewels. No man was examined in the past three days who had ever sold jewels to
him. You will draw your own inferences. He was a man who had no acquaintance
with the inside of the house, and did not know where the jewels were kept. That
answers to the prisoner. He was a man who was certainly in possession of a
weapon with which admittedly the deed could be done. It is no use speculating
upon the size or shape of the implement. It was an implement that could go and
did go into the man's pocket, for he was seen by at least four people
immediately after the murder was committed, and not one of them saw a weapon in
his hand, and you know that no weapon was left in the house. He was in
possession of an implement which, say the two doctors who examined the body,
could quite well have inflicted the wounds, Every wound, including the spindle-
shaped wounds, could have been produced by that hammer; the wound which drove
in the poor lady's eyeball could have been produced by that hammer. That
hammer, wielded by a powerful hand, is the only kind of implement, they say,
which could have inflicted all the wounds which were found upon her face and
her head. The man who was seen emerging from the bedroom was the murderer. The
man who was seen at the foot of the close running westwards was the murderer.
The man who rushed at a great pace past the turnstile at the Subway was the
murderer. And that man, I say, was the prisoner.</p>

  <p>We shall now look at the evidence with regard to two of my
inferences&mdash; first, that he was acquainted with the habits of the inmates
of the house, and, second, that he was acquainted with the movements of the
police. It is perfectly well known that blackguards who commit crimes of this
order upon innocent, feeble, and defenceless people are themselves cravens at
heart. There is nothing they dread so much as the noose. The only human
instinct that animates them is the instinct of self-preservation. They never,
under any circumstances, commit crimes of this kind without taking the most
careful and elaborate precautions to secure their own safety in the end; and,
happily, it is by these very elaborate precautions that the hand of justice is
often able to reach them and we are able to hunt down the miscreant. So it is
in this case. This man appears on the scene early in the month of November. He
takes a house within a quarter of a mile of the old lady's house. He takes it
under a false name; he takes it under a false designation. He takes the house
under the name of Adolf Anderson, and he calls himself a dentist. He takes the
house for eighteen months. Is there any reason that suggests itself to your
mind why he should have taken a false name and a false designation unless it be
to cover up his tracks and to baffle the hand of justice after his deed was
done? There is no reason suggested, none whatever. He had no customers there;
he had no people who came to trade with him; he had no reason to deceive
anybody at that time; he had no character to lose and none to gain. There can
be and there was no other object except to remove all traces of him when his
deed was done and he found it necessary to make his escape.</p>

  <p>Then, gentlemen, he required as part of his elaborate precautions to
familiarise himself with the inmates of the house, with their movements and
their habits, and also with the movements of the police. There was one method,
and one only, by which that object could be accomplished, and that was by
careful, prolonged, and steady watching with a skilled eye. He is seen early in
the month of December by a number of people, to whose evidence I am going to
call your attention, carefully watching the house and the movements of its
inmates, and also the movements of the policemen on the beat. There was, as you
will remember, a Mrs. M'Haffie, who lived at 16 West Princes Street, very
nearly opposite the house where the old lady lived, probably a little further
to the east in the direction of St. George's Road. Gentlemen, Mrs. M'Haffie,
looking out of her window on to this quiet, unfrequented street, saw, she says,
the prisoner moving slowly backward and forward on at least half a dozen
separate and distinct occasions, for thirty minutes at a time. There was nobody
in the case who had anything approaching so good an opportunity of seeing and
observing his movements. She seemed not to be particularly busy with her
housework at the time, and she was struck to find in this quiet neighbourhood,
where she had never seen the like before, this man moving backward and forward
between the corner of St. George's Road and the old lady's dwelling. She sees
him coming back time after time, and observes that it is the same man. She is
shown the prisoner, and she has not the smallest doubt that he is the man. Why
should she have any doubt? Who, having once seen him, could forget his face?
Her daughter had the same opportunities for observation, and took advantage of
them. She, too, saw the man walking slowly backward and forward, examining the
windows of the house, and looking up. Once or twice, says the mother, when he
caught sight of them observing him, he turned his face away and moved out of
their sight. The daughter, too, was perfectly clear and unhesitating in her
identification of the man. She was asked whether, in the month of March, when
being precognosced by the agent for the accused, she would swear to the man
when she came to Edinburgh, and she very properly said that she would not. It
was a very improper question to put on the part of anybody precognoscing, and
it was only by my consent that the question was allowed in Court. That was the
girl's answer. You will judge whether, when she was in the witness-box, she
appeared to have any more hesitation than her mother had in identifying this
man. A niece of Mrs. M'Haffie paid a visit one evening in December, about a
fortnight before the murder, and when she was going upstairs she met a man
coming down who, she says, was very like this man. When she went up she found
from her cousin that he had come to the door and asked if there was any one of
the name of Anderson living there, a peculiar question to ask when there was
the name "M'Haffie" on the door. This niece came back to the house a second
time, four days later, and from the window there was pointed out to her by Mrs.
M'Haffie this very man walking backward and forward and making his
observations. When the niece came downstairs she found him moving off towards
St. George's Road, and she followed him as he was walking down, no doubt to his
own. house. She noticed that he had a sort of slouching gait and was going at a
slow pace. The cousin who opened the door said that he was very like the man
who had come up and asked for Anderson.</p>

  <p>Now, gentlemen, it does not stop there. On 14th, 15th, 16th, and 17th
December he was seen by a very intelligent girl who had a most excellent
opportunity of observing him, namely, the girl Euphemia Cunningham, employed in
the photographer's shop, whose habit it was to go home for dinner about one
o'clock, passing through West Princes Street on her way. At the comer of West
Princes Street and Queen's Crescent, in full view of Miss Gilchrist's house,
she observed the man standing and staring up at Miss Gilchrist's window. She
had a most excellent view of his side face. She observed this same man on the
three succeeding days, and she was very much astonished, as she had never seen
loiterers there before. There was nothing to loiter about there for. On the
three days, 15th, 16th, and 17th December, she called the attention of her
companion, William Campbell, to the fact. She, without hesitation, said there
was no doubt that this was the man she saw, because she took a good look at
him, as it struck her as curious at the time. William Campbell, who was with
her on the 15th, 16th, and 17th, says that he was very like the man he saw, and
he remembers when Euphemia Cunningham said to him, "There is the same man
again." The man apparently heard, and rapidly turned away his face. On the
night before the murder, about twenty minutes to seven, Mr. Bryson, a
cabinetmaker, an intelligent and respectable man, was going home, passing
eastwards along West Princes Street. As he passed the house of Mr. Gillies,
almost straight opposite Miss Gilchrist's house, he was struck by a man
standing on the flat stone at the top of the little flight of steps leading to
the close door, standing with his back to the close door and looking over at
Miss Gilchrist's windows, two of which were lighted. He was so struck with the
appearance of this man, and his long, steady gaze, that he actually went up and
stared at him, thinking that there was something wrong. When the man saw him
staring he was taken aback; he moved on, and walked away towards Queen's
Crescent. Mr, Bryson had a most excellent opportunity of seeing him; he went
for the purpose of seeing him. He took a long, fixed stare at him, and he had
not the slightest hesitation in saying that the prisoner in the dock is the man
he saw there. An hour and a half later Mr. Nairn, a provision merchant, a very
respectable man, was passing in the same direction eastwards. He was ahead of
his wife and children, and he stood near the corner of Queen's Crescent to wait
for them. While he was standing there he says that within a very few yards
further to the east he saw a man with his back to him staring steadily at Miss
Gilchrist's house. It appears that that was the position from which you had by
far the best view of the house. Inspector Dornan went down there and had it
pointed out by Mr. Nairn, and he says that that is the place where you have the
best view of Miss Gilchrist's house. There the man stood, says Mr. Nairn, for
the best part of five minutes. Mr. Nairn was very much impressed with the fact,
and you will remember he said, "I did not have an opportunity of seeing the
man's front face." But when the prisoner turned he had no hesitation in saying,
"That is the man." Then, in addition, you have the evidence of Constable
Walker, who saw him on three different occasions, the first time standing at
that very comer, in full view of Miss Gilchrist's house, the second time, a few
days later, walking westwards on the north side of West Princes Street, right
opposite Miss Gilchrist's house, and the third time loitering near the corner
of St. George's Road. Lastly, you have Constable Bryan, who saw him the week
before the murder close by the corner of St. George's Road and West Princes
Street.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, if that was the prisoner, how do you account for his presence
there? What was a respectable dentist doing day after day, hour after hour,
carefully observing this house? I say that there was no other object that he
had than to observe closely what was going on, so far as he could, with his
skilled eye, to learn from prolonged observation what were the movements of the
people in that house, who were the inmates of the house, and what were their
habits and customs; when the servant went out, and when the old lady was left
alone at home; what were the movements of the policemen on the beat, how often
they passed, at what intervals, and at what times. If any other explanation
suggests itself to your minds, I should be astonished. I am at a loss to give
any explanation other than that the man was there with a purpose, namely, to
make all secure when the supreme moment came.</p>

  <p>It is said that in cases of this kind you are not safe to proceed upon
the evidence of those who have had no personal knowledge of a man, and who
merely speak to their having recognised his face. A mere passing glance at a
man, a stare at a man, a long look at a man is not sufficient if you have not
known him, because you may be mistaken. Now, I agree that that is true. I
myself consider &mdash; but his lordship will guide you here &mdash; that it
would be dangerous to go upon mere personal impressions formed of a man's
appearance, because you may be mistaken. Gentlemen, you can be under no
misapprehension, and there can be no mistake, if the man's appearance is
distinctive and peculiar. In the case of ordinary and commonplace faces, faces
which you see every day in the street, it would be a dangerous thing to go on
your mere passing recollection that you had seen this man or that. But where
you have a man with a peculiar, well-marked face, a face that you would not see
every day, or once in a year, if even ever, then you are in a very different
region. I say that the prisoner's face is one which no man with any observation
at all could forget, having once seen it. You are capital judges yourselves,
there are none better than you. Judge for yourselves in this matter. I would
remind you, however, of some very striking testimony in this case. Mr. Marr,
the house factor, saw the man once, and he had no hesitation in recognising him
again. There is no dispute about it that the prisoner was the very man with
whom Marr had bargained. The printer who printed his cards saw him once, or
perhaps twice, for the briefest possible time, and he at once recognised him.
The clerk in the Cunard office saw him once &mdash; he sees hundreds of
passengers &mdash; and he recognised him instantly after the one brief look
that he had had at him when giving him his tickets. The porter who carried his
baggage had never seen him before, and had never seen him since, and yet he
recognised him without hesitation. The porter at the railway station saw him
once, and recognised him instantly and without the slightest doubt.</p>

  <p>He could not recognise the ladies who were with him, although he had just
as good an opportunity of seeing them; but he had not the slightest hesitation
in recognising the prisoner. Mr. Jackson, to whom he went once in November to
sell a ring, had never seen him before, and has never seen him since, and yet
he recognised him without a moment's hesitation. There is not a single human
being in this case who, having once seen the prisoner, has failed to know him
again at once, so striking, so peculiarly distinctive is his face.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, that is testimony which, I submit to you, is absolutely
overwhelming. You are not dealing here with the case of a man who is like or
who resembles thousands of other men, you are dealing here with a man who, once
seen by a competent and intelligent observer, is never forgotten, and these are
very striking instances which I have just given you. I purposely selected
people who saw him once, but did not fail to recognise him instantly they saw
him again, and you, it is admitted, have recognised the right man. I ask you
whether you are really going to accept the perfectly sound, good evidence of
Mr. Marr, the Cunard man, the railway porter, and the others who did inevitably
and surely recognise this man, and to put aside the evidence of the eleven
people who saw him on that street watching the house carefully, several of whom
had much better opportunities of observing him than Mr. Marr and the others
had. Is it possible that these ten or eleven people may have made any mistake?
I submit that it is not possible.</p>

  <p>In a case of mistaken identity where a respectable man is had up, charged
with having committed some crime, there is always some way to satisfy the jury
that he is the wrong man, that there has really been a great mistake committed,
that he is a perfectly respectable man who was not near the place. There is no
man so destitute of friends and acquaintances that he cannot establish his
identity, and show who he is and what he is, and what his movements were, and
where he was at the time when the crime was committed which is laid at his
door. This man had a communication with his intimate friend Cameron after the
charge was made against him, and when he knew quite well what the situation
was. He writes to his friend Cameron a letter, dated 2nd February, in which,
after railing very hard at Gordon Henderson, whose evidence I will come to in a
moment, he says, "I can prove my innocence before having a trial, because I
will prove with five people where I have been when the murder was committed."
He professes that he could meet the charge by producing five people to the
authorities, and satisfy them where he had been when the murder was committed.
Where are the five? Who are the five? What steps have been taken to show that
he is an honest dentist, practising at 69 St. George's Road, and that this was
an entire misapprehension on the part of the police? Not one. You heard the
evidence. It is said that on the night of the murder he was seen in a billiard
room in Renfield Street. The billiard room keeper and the billiard room marker
were examined. One or other of them must have been in the billiard room, but
neither of them would say that the prisoner was there. His friend Rattman, to
whom he wrote the letter to which I shall refer a little later, was produced,
but all Rattman says &mdash; and it is the best he can say &mdash; is that he
was there playing billiards that evening, that the prisoner came in but did not
play billiards, that he stopped a short time and then went away. Kattman never
looked at the clock, either when he came in or when he went away; he never
looked at the clock that evening. Kattman says it w as his habit to be home a
little before seven; he says he expected to reach his home, which was two or
three minutes away from the billiard room, at ten minutes to seven. Kattman
never looked at the clock at any time, and he is only giving you a hazard guess
or conjecture, with no foundation whatever. The other man who was present in
the billiard room was a man named Aumann. He, like Rattman, never looked at the
clock at all. He says that the prisoner came in any time between 5 and 6.30,
that his object was to get his friend Kattman to buy the pawn ticket for the
brooch, and when Kattman declined to buy it, the prisoner left. Remember this
is 21st December. It is vain to say that Aumann subsequently added that it was
6.30 when the prisoner left. Aumann never looked. If Aumann's evidence is
correct, then the prisoner came into that billiard room between 5 and 5.30 and
tried to get Rattman to buy his pawn ticket, and, when he failed, off he went.
That is all you know. There is no evidence on the part of these two men that
the prisoner was in the billiard room at or near the time when the murder was
committed. Keep in view that the billiard room is less than a mile from the
scene of the murder, and the prisoner is said to be a remarkably rapid walker.
Aumann and Kattman said he was a remarkably rapid walker when he pleased. Well,
then, out of the five people "who will prove where I have been," that is the
best that can be done. You are quite safe to assume that there is no case of
mistaken identity here. The prisoner is hopelessly unable to produce a single
witness who saw that he was anywhere else than at the scene of the murder that
night.</p>

  <p>Having seen the elaborate precautions that were taken to ensure safety,
to ensure that he would not be confronted by some man who could say that he
entered the house, I now turn to the evidence of those who saw the man who
committed the murder; for, of course, the man who committed the murder was the
man who came out of the bedroom, was the man who emerged from the close, was
the man who dashed past the turnstile. Was that man the prisoner? That is the
question which you have to decide. Well, gentlemen, the first witness who
speaks to the prisoner's presence at the scene of the murder, and within
minutes of the murder, is Mrs. Liddell, the married sister of Mr. Adams, who
was coming home with her old mother to 14 We.st Princes Street, next door to
Miss Gilchrist's house. As she approached Miss Gilchrist's house she saw a
strange man standing against the railings, with his left side to her. She was
much struck by his appearance, and she stared at him; not a mere passing
glance, but she stared at the man she saw standing in this position against the
railings. She describes his face with minute accuracy. She said that his was
one face in a thousand. She said that she could not be mistaken as to it. She
would pledge herself to nothing but what she herself had actually seen, and
what had impressed itself on her memory. She said she was rather struck with
the appearance of this man at this unexpected time and place. Gentlemen, she
may have been theatrical in her way of giving evidence, but I am sure you will
not deny she was a conscientious, careful, and unbiassed witness. She refused
to give any evidence on the identification until she had seen the man placed in
the exact position in which she had seen him that night; and then she said,
"Yes, I believe, I must believe, that that man was there." She hesitated, no
doubt, because she knew and realised the serious issue depending on her
testimony in a case like this, but she says, "I know the face at once, now that
I see it as I saw it that night." Then she describes his nose, his cheek, his
complexion, in perfectly graphic language, and she cannot doubt it was the
prisoner she saw that night a few minutes before seven. The next witness is the
witness Adams. Now, he is a little short-sighted &mdash; that must be said
&mdash; but when he stood at the door he expected that something was wrong. He
had heard gruesome sounds down below a few minutes before, he had been sent up
by his sister to see what was wrong, he had rung the bell three times and had
got no answer, and while he was waiting there he again heard the gruesome sound
of this old lady being done to death by her murderer. He went downstairs and
told his sisters what had happened, and they bade him go up again as something
surely must be wrong. He went up again, and standing beside the maid-servant
when she opened the door, he was certainly on the alert. The man came out and
passed him close by. He saw him, he saw his face. As he passed him he dashed
off, and he turned round. and followed him with his eye till he disappeared
down the stair. Now, Mr. Adams had just as much time as I have described
&mdash; I do not say he had a long time &mdash; to make his observation. But I
say that under these awful circumstances, and knowing as he did that something
was wrong, he was on the alert. And he says that the prisoner was the man.
"When he was taken to New York he identified him. He was taken to a room where
there were upwards of forty men, and he had no difficulty whatever in picking
this man out as being very like the man he had seen that night. That is to say,
he did not hesitate between this man and the thirty or forty other people who
were in the room. Never for a moment did he flinch. He picked out that man as
the only man that was like, or, as he said, very like, the man he had seen that
night.</p>

  <p>Now, do not misunderstand a witness who says, "That is very like the man
I saw; he has a very close resemblance to the man I saw." What more can a man
say, what more ought a man to say who was not familiar with the man, and had
only an opportunity of seeing him once? It is really a matter of phrase. "Yes,"
some one says, "That is the man," and he means no more than "That is very like
the man," unless he adds, as you have sometimes heard, "But there is something
about this man that is not like the one I saw," or "There is something about
the man I saw which is not like this man; he is very like him, but there are
some features different." Now, you must have observed that not a single witness
in the box who said, "That is very like the man," added, "But there are some
features present here that were not present in the man I saw," or the reverse.
And, accordingly, do not be misled by phrases or words. No man, who has
testified that he recognises the man in the dock now as the man he had seen on
a former occasion, and only once, can ever say more than this, "That is very
like him; that closely resembles him. I do not hesitate between that man and
any other man I see before me." Mr. Adams came home and again saw him in the
police office, and again identified him, and he gave the same story here in the
witness-box. You cannot deny that Adams was a perfectly impartial and a
perfectly respectable man. You cannot deny that he was under circumstances in
which he could observe the prisoner. You cannot deny that he has never
hesitated or flinched between this man and any other man; and he has not
pointed out a single feature that the man he saw had and that this man has not.
He recollects the kind of coat he wore and the kind of hat. It was the man's
face that impressed him, as it impressed every other person.</p>

  <p>I come now to the servant girl, Helen Lambie. There is a discrepancy
between her evidence and the evidence of Mr. Adams, of which you must judge, a
discrepancy as to the place where she was in the house when she observed the
murderer coming out of the bedroom. She herself said in the witness-box that
she did not get past the threshold of the door. Mr. Adams said she had taken
several steps into the house, and that accordingly her observation of the man
coming would be shorter than she says it was; but, on the other hand, her
observation of the man as he was going away from her would be longer than she
says it was, because Mr. Adams agrees in saying &mdash; and it is very
important that you should remember this&mdash; that when the man passed her she
turned round and watched him until he had disappeared down the stairs. She had
therefore an opportunity, she says, not of seeing his face &mdash; his head was
down when she saw him &mdash; but she saw his side face, his height, his
general appearance, and his gait. Now, when she was taken out to America a very
striking incident took place before the examination proper before the
Commissioner. She and the girl Barrowman were standing with Inspector Pyper in
the corridor of the Court. They had no reason to expect that the murderer would
come that way. They were not told that the murderer was to be brought in. They
were not asked any questions. They were standing there silent, whilst a number
of different people were passing into the Commissioner's room, when there
appeared in the corridor the prisoner at the bar and two other men.
Simultaneously the two girls said to Inspector Pyper, "Oh! there is the man"
&mdash; an involuntary exclamation. There was no question put to them, there
was no information given beforehand to lead them to expect that they would see
the man. They see him unexpectedly, and involuntarily and instantly they say,
"Oh! there is the man."</p>

  <p>Now, evidence of that kind is infinitely better, I should imagine, in
your judgment than even evidence given upon oath in the witness-box. People get
flurried and excited and agitated when they are placed in an unaccustomed
position, and many witnesses do themselves very poor justice indeed in the
witness-box. Here were the two girls standing there without expecting anything,
without any questions being asked, and instantly they recognise the man. Now,
when she was taken subsequently into the Commissioner's room I am bound to say
that she was not treated very fairly. There were thirty or forty people in the
room; the man Slater was seated in a position in which the girl Lambie could
not see him from the place where she was standing. It appears from the evidence
of Inspector Pyper that the agent or counsel representing Slater stood up in
front of him and spread out his frock coat, and when the girl was asked if she
recognised the man in the room she looked round thirty or forty men of all
kinds that were gathered in the room, and, not seeing him, she leaned back in
the way Inspector Pyper describes and caught sight of him behind Mr. Goodhart,
and said, "That is the man there." Now, that is very striking evidence. We
conduct our business in this Court with much greater propriety, much greater
attention is given to fair play and justice. There the girl was put in a
distinctly disadvantageous position, yet, without hesitation, she picked that
man out of the thirty or forty men who were there. You must keep these two
incidents in view, I think, in judging of Helen Lambie's evidence. There is no
doubt she said in New York that she did not see his face, and that she was
judging by his gait and general appearance. No doubt about that. She says now
that although she did not see his full face, she saw his side face, as not only
she says, but Mr. Adams says, that she looked over her shoulder when the man
passed. It is for you to judge whether the girl who saw the side face was not
labouring under excitement, agitation, and may be confusion, owing to the
strange and unaccustomed surroundings in which she found herself after having
been taken over to New York, in this room full of men, and subjected to such
questioning and badgering as we do not tolerate here. That is the question pre-
eminently for you to judge. Now, when she was here she unquestionably told you
that there were three things from which she drew the inference of recognition
&mdash; first, the side face; second, the size and general appearance; and
third, the gait. It is also true that Inspector Pyper observed the man's gait,
and said that it was not very distinctive. He says he could not rely on that.
No doubt he has seen the slight in-toe and the slight turn-out of the knee, but
he adds, with fairness and justice, that what impresses one man most may not
impress another. It is the general appearance on which the girl relies.
Furthermore, she remembers what he was wearing, and she says that this coat
which has been exhibited was the coat that the man was wearing that night, and
she remembers the dark hat, and nothing more. You are the best judges of all
this. What I pray of you is, that when you are considering her evidence
remember her natural agitation and excitement, first, when she saw her dead
mistress lying on the floor on that awful night, and second, the unaccustomed
surroundings in New York, when she was subjected to a good deal of badgering
and questioning by the Commissioner and the agent. And I pray you not to forget
the two incidents to which I have called your attention, the incident in the
corridor and the incident in the Commissioner's room.</p>

  <p>The third witness who saw the murderer that night was the girl Barrowman.
She was going a message at the time, and she walked eastwards along West
Princes Street. As she came within "12 or 13 yards of Miss Gilchrist's house
she saw a man coming out at a break-neck pace. If you recollect, there is an
incandescent lamp just a few yards to the west of the entrance to Miss
Gilchrist's house, and that incandescent lamp throws an admirable light upon
Miss Gilchrist's steps and the intervening pavement. This little girl had a
full view of the man. She saw him glance towards St. George's Road, and then he
ran westwards, and ran against her. She describes his coat; she describes his
hat; she describes his appearance. When he dashed against her he still
continued to pursue his flight westward, and she turned round and followed him
a considerable number of paces, until she saw him turn round into West
Cumberland Street, and then she lost sight of him. She went home and told her
mother what she had seen. Her mother bade her be silent, because she might have
been mistaken, though she said that she was not. By pure accident her testimony
came to the knowledge of the police, and it was from her description that the
man was traced. She never swerved &mdash; you saw her in the witness-box, and
you will judge whether she was not a remarkably intelligent and clear observer
&mdash; she never swerved from the description she had given. She said he was
clean shaven. You will recollect about that. The prisoner was shaved about the
middle of December, and there was only some growth. Is it not perfectly natural
that the girl who had only a comparatively short opportunity, but a very good
opportunity, of observing the man, should not see what is called this stubbly
growth on the upper lip, a growth, the barber said, of about 3-16 of an inch?
That is the one point on which it is said that her recognition of the features
and the appearance of the man is defective. You will judge whether that is
sufficient. She identifies him without hesitation from amongst the forty people
in the Commissioner's room in New York, and she identifies him here. I ask you
to remember the very striking incident which took place in the Central Police
Office. She asked that he should be dressed as he was on the night in question.
He puts on the coat No. 43 of the productions, he puts on the hat, and she
makes him pull it down a little, and a little more, and then she says, "That is
it; that is as I saw him on the night of the murder." Now, that is very
striking testimony. I do not know that, under the circumstances, you could
possibly have better testimony than that. I leave it with you to say whether it
is likely, putting all things together, that that very intelligent and wholly
unbiassed observer, that girl who had an excellent opportunity of seeing the
murderer, could possibly have been mistaken.</p>

  <p>The last witness who saw the murderer was the girl at the turnstile. Now,
so far as I know, the only observation upon her evidence is with regard to the
time. She said it was any time between 7.30 and eight o'clock when the
passenger passed her at a break-neck speed. All she can say is that it was
after 7.30, she says between 7.30 and twenty-five minutes to eight, but let it
be later, if you please. I do not contend &mdash; no man would contend &mdash;
that this man made a straight course from the scene of the murder to the
underground station. If he had done so he could have covered the distance in
about five or six minutes, and we know that the murder must have taken place,
and the murderer must have escaped from the house by fifteen or twenty minutes
past seven. Of course, there is a network of streets there, a network of
streets that were perfectly familiar to Slater, up and down which he might have
doubled, and no doubt did double, before he reached the Subway station. My
point is that he knew perfectly where was the best place to get underground and
to elude observation. He knew the whole locality, and he knew his best means of
covering up his tracks was to get down below, to get to the Subway, and to be
taken by a train to some remote part of the city and then come strolling back
to his house. The girl had an excellent opportunity of observing. He comes up,
pitches down his penny, passes the turnstile without picking up his ticket, and
she looks out, and has an opportunity of seeing him while he goes down the
flight of steps. She describes him exactly as Barrowman describes him. You
would notice that both of them observed that he was holding his hands in his
pockets, and that his coat was open. I suggest that the weapon was in his inner
coat pocket, and he was holding it tight to prevent it falling out. Now this
girl, having seen the man, having seen his face when he paid his money, has not
the slightest doubt. She, like the others, picked him out from amongst the ten
or twelve people she saw in the Central Police Office, and she never swerved
between him and any one else. You have heard a body of evidence that cannot be
lightly set aside, testimony which is in exact agreement with all the other
evidence in the case, on the part of the four people who saw the murderer. The
only question is, are you satisfied that their recollection of him and his
appearance is so good that you can believe them when they say, without
hesitation, that the prisoner at the bar is the man they saw?</p>

  <p>Now, gentlemen, I come to a different class of evidence altogether. We
know nothing of the man's movements until a quarter to ten at night, when he
appears, excited, at the Motor Club in India Street. He interviews Gordon
Henderson, the clubmaster, whom he has seen only two or three times before; he
begs him to give him all the money he has in the club, and he will give him a
cheque for it. Now, that is a strange request. Why does he now begin on this
very day, 21st December, to collect together all the money that he can? Why was
it he could not even wait till the next day to cash his cheque? I dare say you
have your own ideas as to whether that cheque would have been honoured. Why
does he go, gasping and panting, for money to this Motor Club, where he was but
little known as compared with the club adjoining, the Sloper Club? How is it
that Henderson had his suspicions aroused by the excited man coming at this
late hour, not a member of the club, and begging him for all the money he can
lay his hands on? Henderson is not able to give him anything, except a very
little loose change, which is insufficient, and he suggests that he should go
next door to the Sloper Club, where he would find his friend Cameron. I suppose
he, knowing Cameron's financial resources better than you or I do, said that
was no use, and then he left. Slater himself obviously felt that this was a
very suspicious incident. Here is what he says about it in his letter, "I am
very down-hearted, my dear Cameron, to know that my friends in Glasgow, like
<i>Gordon Henderson</i>, can tell such lies about me to the Glasgow police. I
have seen here his statements he made in Glasgow telling the police that a
German came up to him and had told him Oscar Slater had committed the murder,
and also that I have been on the night of the murder in his place asking him
for mony, I was very excited and in hurry, I didn't think it was very clever
from him, <i>because he like to make himself a good name by the police</i> to
tell such lies. I don't deny I have been in his place asking him for mony,
because I have been brocke in the Sloper Club. Only I will fix Mr. Gordon
Henderson. I will prove with plenty of witnesses that I was playing there
mucky, and I am entitled to ask a proprietor from a gambling house when I am
broke for money. He would not mind to get me hangt, and I will try to prove
that from a gambling point I am right to ask for some money. I hope nobody
propper mindet will blame me for this." I wonder who are the gentlemen who were
brought to prove that he was at the Sloper Club that night, that he was playing
cards, that he had lost money and could not get money from his friends in the
Sloper Club, and that he went to the adjoining club, where he was not a member,
and asked the clubmaster at a late hour of night to give him money to pay his
debts in the adjoining club, and offered him a cheque. He did not ask for any
sum of money; he asked for all the money that the clubmaster had. I suggest to
you that Slater at this time, having committed the murder, was now getting all
the means he could collect in order to enable him to effect his escape, for you
will recollect he was disturbed before he had possession himself of more than
one of the old lady's jewels.</p>

  <p>There is one other instance, and it is a very striking one. In the
evening of 24th December &mdash; or it may have been the 23rd &mdash; there
mounted the car at the foot of Union Street a man whom the conductor, who was a
very good observer, identified as the prisoner. He went up on the top of the
car and took his seat a little bit in front of the place where the electricity
comes down to drive the car. On the opposite side there was sitting a boy
reading about the murder in the <i>Evening Citizen</i>. As the car conductor
comes up and asks the man where he is going there is a mumbled answer, and the
conductor gives him a penny ticket. Then he turns to the boy, who has been
reading about the Glasgow West-End murder, and asks him if the man has been got
yet; and the boy answers, "No, and I do not think they are likely to get him."
The conductor sees this man fidgetting and looking suspiciously at him, and
within a few seconds after he has paid his fare he rises, darts down the stair,
runs up a side street, and runs full speed up the street, without waiting for
the car to stop. Well, it is suggested that it is not very economical for a man
to pay a penny and leave before he has reached his destination, but that is not
the observation I think that you are likely to make. He was very brave, he was
perfectly cool, he was perfectly composed, amongst his cronies in the few days
after the murder. He never went to any of his clubs or any of his other
familiar haunts, and the only time we hear of him in the presence of the
members of the general public we find that his guilty conscience is aroused,
and he feels that the sooner he is out of the neighbourhood the better. At all
events, there is that very striking incident. The conductor, having seen the
man on the roof there, said of the prisoner, "That is the man "; and he has not
the slightest hesitation about him any more than the other witnesses have.</p>

  <p>I come now, finally, to his flight from justice. I say, deliberately,
"his flight from justice," because I am going to demonstrate that there was one
reason, and one reason only, for his leaving Glasgow at that time, and that was
to escape the hands of justice. His departure from Glasgow was, to use his own
expression in his letter to his friend Rattman, "absolutely suddenly." That is
Rattman's translation, "absolutely suddenly," or, as we say in the letter as
printed, "surprisingly." Gentlemen, he left Glasgow on the night of 25th
December without saying farewell to a single one of his intimate friends and
cronies, without a single one of his friends knowing that he was going away. It
is said that a fortnight, or three weeks, or a month before he spoke of going
to America. I dare say he did; I am certain he did. There is no doubt whatever
he had made up his mind, as soon as the deed was accomplished, that he would
not stay in this country one moment longer than was absolutely necessary. He
had in view to go to America or somewhere else, and that he stated that to his
cronies three weeks or a month before is, I think, not only highly probable,
but absolutely certain. What I say is, that, having this intention of going
abroad unquestionably fixed in his mind, he did go at the precise moment when
he went suddenly, unexpectedly, and without giving a word of warning to a
single one of his friends. I say that his flight was precipitated, and the
moment fixed by the publication of his description in the newspapers at two
o'clock on the afternoon of the 25th December. He had taken his house for
eighteen months. Do you think that a respectable man, dentist or no dentist,
having taken a house for eighteen months, and having made up his mind to leave
his house, would not have given some notice? I am assuming at this moment that
he is a respectable man, who has fallen into the hands of the authorities by a
mistake. Do you really think that a respectable man who, having taken a house
for eighteen months from respectable people, would have left without giving a
word of warning? He gives no notice, and he leaves the house with the rent
unpaid, of course. He has bought &pound;178 worth of furniture, and he leaves
that. Happily, that was purchased on the hire-purchase system, and the
furniture people got back the furniture. No notice is given to them. You would
expect that a respectable man would go to the furniture people and would say, "
I am going away. Pray, take back the furniture." He leaves without giving any
notice. On 9th December he sends his watch up to London to be repaired, and he
tells the watchmaker that his address till 30th December will be 69 St.
George's Road. At 6.12 p.m. on 21st December a telegram is sent off saying that
he must have his watch at once, and on 23rd December he sends another telegram
saying, "Must have watch now, leaving to-morrow night for the Continent." That
was a falsehood, and he knew it, because on that very day, the 23rd December,
he was at Cook's office in Glasgow finding out about sailings for America. He
was minded to go on board the "Lusitania," which left Liverpool for New York on
Saturday, the 26th. He was too late on the 23rd to effect arrangements for a
berth, and he was asked by the clerk to come back the next day, that they were
communicating with Liverpool, and would give him an answer then. On the
afternoon of the 24th this man, who was instantly leaving for the Continent,
comes back to Cook's office, and is offered an inside berth, which he thinks is
unsuitable. He thinks he would like an outside berth, and he does not take the
berth that is offered. The clerk asks him to come back next day, and he agrees
to come back the next day, the 25th. He never appeared on the 25th. Now, mind
you, at this time he had given his name to Cooks' people in Glasgow as Oscar
Slater. On the 25th &mdash; the day he was to go back to Cooks' office &mdash;
his name and his description, and all the rest of it, appear in the Glasgow
papers, and he sees that the last thing in this world that he ought to do, if
he studies his own safety, is to go back to Cooks' office as Oscar Slater. He
accordingly straightway proceeds to pack up all his goods and effects on the
25th. So far as we know, he never leaves the house from the time he sees the
paper until a little after six o'clock, when he goes down to the Central
Station, and gets a porter to go up to his house. No arrangement was made
beforehand. He walks down to the Central Station at six o'clock and gets a
porter to come up for his baggage at 8.20, and he goes on with his packing. The
porter comes, and then you will remember the curious departure. The cab does
not drive up to the door. Down he goes with the lady and the servant. You will
remember what the servant upstairs and the neighbours said. He looks
suspiciously about, and the lady is behind him. No doubt they go on and find
their way down to the Central Station and take their places in the train. The
booking clerk at the Central Station says that a man very like Slater came and
bought two London tickets, third class. He says that he cannot recollect who it
was that bought the other tickets that are down in his book, the two third-
class tickets to Liverpool. I do not attach very much importance to this, and I
will tell you frankly it depends entirely on the evidence of the booking clerk,
who simply says, "I recollect seeing that man, a man very like that man, buying
two third-class single tickets for London "; and he says, what is perfectly
true, that a man with a London ticket may travel to Liverpool and break his
journey there, going in the Liverpool carriage. It seems to be the regular
practice to take a ticket for London, and break the journey at Liverpool, and
no question is asked. When he arrives at Liverpool he does not go to the Cunard
office and say, " I am Oscar Slater, the man who was communicating with you
through your agent Cook in Glasgow," but he lets slip, as some men do even when
they seek to be most careful, what he thinks to be rather a suspicious
expression. When he is offered a berth he says, "Oh, well, I was offered that
by your Glasgow agents," and then, says the booking clerk, he seemed to have
regretted having used the words "Glasgow agents." Whatever impression he may
have produced upon the Cunard agent, he takes his passage on board the
"Lusitania" under the name of Otto Sando, and the lady under the name of Amy
Sando. Why? For two reasons. In the first place, because he knew that the
police were on the track of Oscar Slater, and, in the second place, because he
knew that upon a number of his packages were the initials "O.S.," and it would
not do for him to travel under the name of Adolph Anderson, or George, or any
other name but a name beginning with and S. And, accordingly, for some reason
or another which has not been explained, which cannot be explained consistently
with innocence, the man takes his passage for himself and the lady under false
and assumed names. He does more. In the application form for tickets he puts in
his name as Otto Sando, and his occupation as dentist. Where is his
destination? His destination was Queensland to the barber, his destination was
San Francisco to the watchmaker, his destination was Monte Carlo to the servant
who was left behind. His destination was America generally. His destination is
now changed, because the newspapers have reported his name and his description,
and his destination now is, "American address, Chicago, 30 Staate Street." On
the back of his ticket you find the name "Otto Sando and Mrs. Amy Sando." You
find his occupation given as dentist, you find his final destination Chicago,
and you find in pencil "Hotel Chicago." Now, I ask you, how can you account for
this remarkable history of deception if this was an honest man, simply leaving
this country for America in order to take up some business, in order to visit a
friend for some entirely innocent purpose? Is there any sort of explanation
consistent with innocence? I submit to you there is no explanation of it which
is consistent with anything but the view that he, knowing that the police were
on his track, took every step possible in order to baffle the ends of justice
and to escape the hands of the authorities.</p>

  <p>That was not the end of his deception. In the course of his preparations,
when he was collecting his money, he had to lift some money from the Savings
Bank and some money that was invested in the public funds; and he had to write
a letter to London in order to get that money. He wrote that letter to London
on the 21st, and he got his money from the Savings Bank, some &pound;&pound;39,
on the 23rd, and his money from the public funds, some &pound;49, on the 24th.
In the letter which he wrote to the authorities asking for his money, he asks
them to send it at once, "as I have an urgent call to America because my wife
is ill." The postmark upon that letter is "Glasgow, 5 p.m., December 21st."
There is no talk here about escape from an importunate wife. We were told that
the whole object of the visit to America was either to benefit the health of
one lady or to escape the pursuit of another, but here he is now going to
America, not to escape, but on the urgent call of his wife, who is said to be
ill.</p>

  <p>What is the meaning of all this deception, what is the meaning of all
these deliberate falsehoods, what is the meaning of this collection of all his
available resources, what is the meaning of his call on the pawn-brokers on
21st December to get &pound;30 more upon this brooch? What is the meaning of
his attempt, his eager attempt, to sell even the reversion of the pawn ticket,
having got into his hands upwards of, roughly, &pound;135? Why was he
collecting all this money? This man, who was hard up some weeks before, had
begun to collect all his available resources in order that he might make his
flight from justice absolutely certain and secure. My submission to you is that
the circumstances connected with his flight bring home inevitable guilt to this
man. These subterfuges and deliberate lies and falsehoods which he told, and
the efforts which he made to conceal his tracks, are consistent with nothing
but guilt on his part, and that synchronised in a remarkable degree with the
publication of his description in the newspapers and the knowledge that was so
brought home to him that the authorities were upon his track.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, I submit to you in summary that the evidence shows, clearly
and beyond all dispute, that this man was a man who was capable of this
atrocious crime; it shows that this man was a man who had the whole knowledge
necessary to enable him to commit the crime with success; it shows that he was
one of the few men who could commit a crime of this kind with any reasonable
chance of escaping. As I said before, jewels are difficult things to deal with
and to dispose of. This was a man who had been seen elaborately taking the
precautions necessary to accomplish a crime which was carefully planned, which
was deliberately carried out by cool and abandoned ruffianism. The evidence
shows conclusively, not only had he taken elaborate precautions to cover up his
tracks first, in anticipation of the accomplishment of his nefarious object,
but he took the greatest pains when the supreme moment came to conceal his
escape and to effect his flight with perfect safety.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, I have done. I cannot prove more in this case. I do not for a
moment deny that you have to-day to discharge the most serious and the most
responsible duty which you will probably have to discharge during the whole
course of your natural lives. On your verdict undoubtedly depends a man's life;
and I need say no more to bring home to you a sense of the responsibility which
now lies upon you. If any reasonable doubt occurs to you, if you entertain any
reasonable doubt as to the evidence bringing home guilt to this man, then you
are bound to give him the benefit of that doubt. He may be, and probably is,
the worst of men; but he is entitled to as fair a trial as if he was the best
of men. He may be one of the most degraded of mortals, he may be a cheat, he
may be a robber, a burglar, or the worst of characters, but that does not infer
that he committed murder. He is entitled, therefore, to have all the benefit of
as fair a trial as you can give to a citizen of most unimpeachable
respectability. Gentlemen, he is entitled to justice, to no less than justice,
but to no more than justice. My submission to you is that his guilt has been
brought fairly home to him, that no shadow of doubt exists, that there is no
reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator of this foul murder. I adjure you
to allow no feeling of sentiment &mdash; if, indeed, sentiment is admissible in
a case like this at all &mdash; and no feeling of aversion to the consequences
that may follow, to deter you from discharging the duty which you owe to your
country, and the duty which is laid upon you by the oath which you took on
Monday morning, to prevent you from finding and returning the verdict to which
the evidence inevitably leads.</p>

  <br>

  <h2><a id="addr2" name="addr2">MR. M'CLURE'S ADDRESS TO THE
JURY/a&gt;</a></h2>

  <p>Mr. M'CLURE then addressed the jury as follows: &mdash; Gentlemen of the
jury, I must confess to a feeling of very great responsibility in rising to
address you now on behalf of the accused. Not only has he got, with slight
resources and the assistance of a few friends, to fight his case single-handed
against the forces of the Crown and the power of the Lord Advocate, but I think
he has also to fight a most unfair fight against public prejudice, roused with
a fury I do not remember to have seen in any other case. Certainly the
newspaper campaign which has been conducted against this man Slater is without
parallel for its absolutely irresponsible character, for the rumours it has set
afloat, for the prejudice it has created. I am not saying this to you because I
believe you have been moved by it, but I mention it because it is right that it
should be mentioned and condemned. This man, in many quarters, has been
convicted before he has been tried; but I ask you to bear in mind that you,
gentlemen, and all of us here who have been present during these last three
days listening to the evidence, are better judges than any outsider can
possibly be of the rights and wrongs of this matter. If you ever had any
preconception in your minds because of what you have seen in the newspapers
before you were empanelled &mdash; even as late as Saturday last there was a
disgraceful attack upon the prisoner in an evening newspaper &mdash; lay that
aside, and remember that the accused has to be tried by you upon the evidence
that has been laid before you upon oath. I am certain you will do nothing that
is unfair, and I am certain you will act up to the high conception of duty
which, I trust, you entertain. The case has many difficulties, and you will
weigh them; but you will remember this, that if you come to an adverse verdict
against this man there is not the lea-st doubt that it will be followed by
sentence of death, and that will be followed by his certain doom. If he is
convicted, I would have you remember that there is no possibility of a
commutation of the capital penalty; and I say this to make you bear in mind the
terrible power which you wield, and also to impress upon you your duty to weigh
fairly the great issues which are before you.</p>

  <p>There is no doubt whatever &mdash; it has been mentioned as the main
thing against him &mdash; that the person you are trying is what is ordinarily
described as a person of disreputable life. People who frequent the clubs to
which he resorted, who have no means of livelihood except gambling, and have
for their friends all kinds of outcasts, live a life of their own, and none of
us here touches it. Therefore, when appeals are made to you by the LORD
ADVOCATE, asking you to conceive what a respectable man would do under
circumstances of this kind or of that, his appeal is beside the point. These
people do not have influential friends, they have only friends of their own
class; and surely this is certain, that if one of them is charged with murder,
and may have to die for it, you cannot, in common fairness, disregard the
evidence of the people he has been living among. You cannot say, "Because I
cannot get people living under respectable social conditions to say something
in his favour, he is therefore doomed." The LORD ADVOCATE says, "Where was he?
If he cannot show to demonstration by respectable witnesses where he was, what
do you think of him? Is he not guilty?" Gentlemen, that comes, in simple
language, to this, that unless the man could demonstrate an alibi by the
evidence of the respectable &mdash; that is, by persons he never mixed with and
never met &mdash; then he is to pay the last penalty. That surely, gentlemen,
is not the way in which this case can be dealt with. If you can find proof
convincing to your mind that the prisoner did the deed, then I, no less than
the Lord Advocate, would not ask you to hold your hand. But your judgment must
be a careful and considerate judgment. When a man is being tried for his life
he has a right to the benefit of all the doubts there may be. If you see any
doubts in the evidence, then weigh them well. Remember that a fellow-creature
is not to be sent to death unless his guilt is clear. Remember this also, that
it is well to give a verdict in which there will be no after reproach for
yourselves.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, there were some circumstances in connection with this case
&mdash; occurring before the case itself was investigated &mdash; which started
an almost overwhelming prejudice against the prisoner. Sympathy, of course,
exists in the breasts of none of us for the crime which was committed; and if
we had the perpetrator, there is no doubt what we would do with him. But the
horror of this murder overhung the city of Glasgow, and, as you have heard in
the evidence, all sorts of absurd rumours were in circulation. These rumours,
some of which were put to the witnesses, were things that I had heard myself
&mdash; that this old lady was the friend of thieves, the recipient of stolen
property; her house full of jewels; one person said to be her illegitimate
daughter, and Slater himself said to be her illegitimate son! There was not a
word of truth in all that, but it shows how the public mind was taken
possession of. It was something to strike horror into the heart of every
household, that, in a common stair in Glasgow, at seven o'clock in the evening,
when an old lady was left casually alone, a murderer could come across her
threshold and kill her, and nobody know where the murderer was. It was the same
excitement as there was in London when Jack the Ripper was feared &mdash;
feared, indeed, not only in London, but all over the country. "When excitement
of that kind takes possession of the public mind, the judgment becomes
dangerously overbalanced; and I will make clear to you two matters creating
totally unfounded prejudice against the prisoner which took possession of the
public mind and influenced it wildly against him.</p>

  <p>In the first place, when the pawning of a diamond crescent brooch was
found to have taken place exactly upon the 21st of December, the very day of
the murder, the whole place was agog. A diamond crescent brooch was missing
from the old lady's house, and it was said, "There is the murderer already
disposing of the stolen property!" How did this matter get to the police? It
got to the police in this way, that Allan M'Lean was casually told at the club,
by a friend of his called Anderson, that Slater, who had been a member of the
club, and had been gambling there regularly for a period of weeks, had been
disposing in Glasgow of a diamond crescent brooch in a pawn-shop. This, we now
know, was not Miss Gilchrist's brooch at all, yet it is responsible for the
blaze of suspicion against this man which immediately ensued. Two days after, a
newspaper came out with a description of the supposed culprit. He was said to
be a sallow-complexioned man, a dark man. And so was Slater ! And for some days
Slater had not been seen about the club ! Then Allan M'Lean &mdash; I do not
blame him for it; he was quite right &mdash; went to the police and said, "I
know a man who answers that description, and I know he was pawning a diamond
crescent brooch." So he took the police up to show them the place where this
man Slater lived &mdash; and this fatal suspicion was afloat. Gentlemen, we all
know now, as I have said, that the diamond brooch had nothing at all to do with
this old lady. It was a diamond brooch which, so far back as the month of
November, had been pawned by Slater in the pawnshop of Mr. Liddell. Twenty
pounds had originally been advanced on it; on 9th December, a fortnight before
the murder, &pound;10 more had been advanced on it; and on the day of the
murder the prisoner, who owned it, and was going abroad, went back and got as
much more as he could get on it, viz., &pound;30. That, of course, has nothing
to do with this case, as we now know, but the coincidence set the public mind
on fire.</p>

  <p>Another circumstance &mdash; also, I shall show, of mere coincidence
&mdash; strongly affected public opinion. When Allan M'Lean guided the police
to Slater's residence, Slater had disappeared; he was gone ! What more natural
than to suppose that this was, as my learned friend said, a "flight from
justice"? It was a natural supposition, yet I will be able to show you, I
think, quite conclusively that this was no flight from justice. I shall show
you that Slater had long purposed going abroad, and you will judge whether the
steps that were taken to that end long before, and the things which he did on
the very day of the murder, are consistent with the action of a man who had
still a murder to perpetrate &mdash; a man taking decisive steps to depart
before he had murdered anybody &mdash; apparently, the suggestion must be, on
the chance that he would commit a murder at some later time ! That is what it
must come to, for the prisoner had, in fact, concluded a number of his
arrangements to leave for America before this murder was perpetrated. I have
told you about the pawning of the brooch being an entirely false scent.
Everybody admits that now. What about this "flight from justice"? Let us see
how this stands.</p>

  <p>The key to the situation is to be got in the domestic establishment. What
do Schmalz and Antoine say? Slater, according to their evidence &mdash; which,
by the way, was not alluded to in the speech of the LORD ADVOCATE &mdash; had
come down from London in November because, as he said, trade in his line of
business was bad in London. No doubt that was the motive that brought him. He
had not been very long in Glasgow before he was equally disgusted at the
opportunities offered there, and he thought of moving. It is not as if this
purpose was known only to himself and his immediate household &mdash; I mean
Schmalz and Antoine. It was not so at all. It is absolutely proved, without any
possibility of doubt, by a series of witnesses, that for at least three weeks
before this murder occurred he had expressed to various people his intention to
go abroad to America &mdash; to San Francisco. I want you to follow me here,
because this does a great deal to clear up the situation. The intention of
going to America, was expressed at least three weeks before to, first of all,
Hugh Cameron. Hugh Cameron has sworn this explicitly; and, let me say this of
him, that he cannot be called a witness who is specially favourable to the
prisoner, because, whatever line of life was followed by the prisoner in
Glasgow, to whatever depth he may have gone in his life, our information upon
that depends entirely upon the evidence of Hugh Cameron. The LORD ADVOCATE, in
connection with the prisoner's habit of gambling, asked, "Did you ever hear of
him living in any other way?" and the answer of Cameron was, "Not at that
time." Then the LORD ADVOCATE asked, "Did you subsequently?" and the witness
said, "I heard it" &mdash; and you know what it was. There is no more evidence
on that matter, unless what the girl Antoine said herself, that in the
prisoner's absence she received gentlemen. That, however, is a subject we are
not to go into. It should not have been referred to, and is not in the case;
but you will remember the suggestion that was made upon it by the LORD ADVOCATE
&mdash; that a man of a type so degraded was capable of anything. The prisoner
does not look like it, but still, because of this vague and irrelevant
accusation, he is supposed to be a man of such extraordinary brutal disposition
that he will kill a woman. Well, Hugh Cameron, whose evidence raised this
issue, cannot be accused of undue partiality. And what was his evidence? He
stated that, three weeks before the murder was committed, this man was talking
of leaving Glasgow, and the only thing that kept him from going was that he had
a house on lease, and furniture on the hire-purchase system, and that he had to
get some one first to take these over. When Cameron was asked, "Did he tell you
that he was just on the eve of departure?" he said, "No, he did not tell me."
But he added this &mdash; and you will bear it in mind &mdash; "I did not
understand he was just going; I thought it might be by the 'Campania' the
following week." The witness Rattman said the same thing. He said, "Not only
did I know he was going, but I saw a letter from San Francisco; I do not
remember the name of the writer of it." Antoine gave the name as that of a man
called Devoto, and his letter was not only seen by Cameron and Rattman, but
Cameron stated explicitly, "Although I did not know he was going that week, I
knew that his departure was imminent."</p>

  <p>Now, that being the state of mind in which the prisoner was, he did make
an effort, which was spoken to yesterday, to dispose of his house and
furniture. How did the witness Aumann impress you, gentlemen? He did not seem
to be telling an untruth, and he stated that he was personally asked if he
would take over the flat. He told you that he went over the flat with Slater,
and saw the woman Antoine there; that he went home and asked his wife if he
should take it, but that she dissuaded him. It therefore comes to this, that
three weeks at least before the murder the prisoner's intention to leave was
expressed to various friends, and, in point of fact, one of them had actually
gone to look at the house with the view of taking it over from him. We have it
in the evidence that some person in London called Freedman had also been
approached with the same object.</p>

  <p>Let us now come to the Monday morning, 21st December. Two letters arrived
that morning for Slater, and these letters were followed by results which, I
think, you will appreciate. There was a letter that morning from Devoto in San
Francisco, and there was another that came from Mr. Rogers in London. It is
said by Antoine that she and Slater had been living together for practically
the last three or four years. Slater has a wife, and his wife, apparently, when
he and Antoine were together in Brussels, managed to make it so hot for them
that they left for Boulogne. They travelled across to America under the names
of Mr. and Mrs. A. George, so as to give his wife no clue. On this morning of
21st December, when there came the letter from San Francisco, and the
intimation from Mr. Rogers that Mrs. Slater was making further inquiries
regarding her husband's whereabouts, Slater made up his mind that he would go
to America, and expressed his intention in presence of Antoine and Schmalz.
Now, it is not as if nothing followed upon that. You will ask me, "Where are
the two letters you are talking about?" They are not here. But I ask you to
note what followed. At two o'clock that day Schmalz was told that her services
were dispensed with from the next Saturday, and that she could go back to
London. Slater said to her, when he gave her her dismissal at lunch time that
Monday, "You will be able to find your way back to London by yourself." Now,
that was before the murder. The next thing is this, that, as we know, he posted
a letter, the envelope of which bears five o'clock as the time of posting. That
letter was sent from 69 St. George's Road, and was written before the murder.
Here is the letter&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">Dear Sir, &mdash; Enclosed you will find my savings bank
book. Be kind enough to send me the money at once, as I have an urgent call to
America because my wife is ill. If possible, wire the money on, and I will pay
all charges here. &mdash; Yours truly, Adolf Anderson.</p><br>

  <p>The LORD ADVOCATE, commenting on the terms of this letter, says that the
prisoner's wife was not ill, and he asks, "What does he mean by saying that? He
is a liar, and therefore he is the murderer." That hardly follows, nor is it to
the point. The letter was all true except the words, "my wife is ill." Here,
then, is a letter posted two hours before the murder, following upon the
dismissal of the servant. It says that the writer is going to America, and, in
order to hurry up the Savings Bank people and to get attention, that he is
going immediately, as his wife is ill. I should think a stimulus of this kind
is not unusual. Then we have this further circumstance, that he sent a wire to
Dent, in London, who was doing something to his watch. In that wire he says,
"Dent, watchmaker, Trafalgar Square, London. If possible, please send watch at
once. &mdash; Oscar Slater." That was sent off from the Central Station,
Glasgow, at twelve minutes past six on Monday, 21st December, and it is in
Slater's handwriting. Now, the murder was not yet committed. It has been proved
to you that he had got letters that morning which made him resolve to leave for
America, and here are three facts which all go to show that he proceeded at
once to make arrangements and realise what property he had. First, he dismisses
the servant; second, he writes to the Savings Bank that he is going to America,
and asks for his money; third, his watch being at Dent's in London, a wire is
sent at 6.12, asking that it be returned at once. These are three things which
show that he was on the move before the murder was committed. Another thing is
this: he had now raised &pound;60 upon this diamond crescent brooch which never
belonged to the deceased lady at all. Having got the last advance of &pound;30
&mdash; I suppose all the pawnbroker would give for it &mdash; he went
immediately, as has been proved by Rattman and Aumann, to Gall's public-house,
and he was there between four and five o'clock in the afternoon, with the pawn
ticket, to see if he could raise some further money on it. That is to say, he
wished to transfer his remaining interest in this diamond brooch, on which he
had raised &pound;60, and he asked Aumann if he would be prepared to buy the
pawn ticket. Is it not obvious that the person who was doing all these things
was carrying out his expressed intention to leave the country? He began by
collecting whatever assets he had, and he was doing this up to the late
afternoon of 21st December. There is no gainsaying that at 6.12 he was in the
Central Station sending off a telegram. The telegram is in his handwriting, and
6.12 is the hour at which it was despatched. Accordingly, we have the prisoner,
on the night when the servant girl says she left her mistress's house to buy an
evening newspaper, at the Central Station sending off a telegram asking Dent to
send on his watch. That is at 6.12 p.m. It seems to me an extremely unlikely
preparation for a man who was going to murder some one at seven o'clock, to be
entirely absent from the locality of the crime during the whole afternoon, to
be walking about raising money on his possessions, to be writing for the money
in his Savings Bank account, to be wiring for his watch to be sent on. Is the
person so employed going to commit a crime at or about seven o'clock? But there
is this further to be said. The telegram to Dent involved this, that he could
not get the watch for a day or two. The Post Office Savings Bank letter
involved this, that he could not get paid that money for some days to come. In
point of fact, he was not paid it till the 23rd, and he did not get the
proceeds from the sale of his 2| per cent, stock till the 24th. Can you
conceive a man, who has been watching his chance to murder this old lady,
spending the whole of the afternoon in walking round the pawn shops where his
property happens to be, interviewing his friends and trying to sell them pawn
tickets for the residue of his pawned property, writing letters for money,
telegraphing for a watch, involving himself so as to hinder an early departure?
Can you conceive that as being a probable or likely thing? Can you conceive it
as the act of a person who has his victim in view, and means to commit
murder?</p>

  <p>"What was said about his movements afterwards? Rattman was absolutely
clear on the subject. He said that after 6.12 &mdash; about twenty minutes past
six &mdash; the prisoner came over to a billiard room where he (Rattman) v.-as
playing a game with Aumann. They did not say that Slater stayed long with them;
they both told you quite distinctly that Slater did not stay till the game was
finished, that he left a few minutes earlier, and they put down the time as
about 6.30. Slater had to go considerably further than Aumann; he had to go
some 1400 yards in order to reach the vicinity of the deceased lady's house; he
had just the same distance to go to reach his own home. I do not know how long
he would take to do that distance, but, suppose he took between ten minutes and
a quarter of an horn-, then it would be a quarter to seven by the time he could
be at the spot. For a murderer who has got a victim in view, he is cutting it
very fine, do you not think? What is the idea of the prosecution, I wonder? Is
it that the prisoner secreted himself in some passage round about, and watched
for his chance in the absence of the servant girl? That must, I should think,
be the case for the Crown, but how can it be reconciled with the fact that the
prisoner absented himself from the locality throughout the whole afternoon?
Well, what about his subsequent proceedings? We cannot prove absolutely an
alibi, but the evidence comes very near it. We have Antoine and the girl
Schmalz, who both said that seven o'clock wag the prisoner's ordinary dinner
hour; and, looking back, they can remember nothing exceptional that night. He
was not absent from dinner. Dinner may have been earlier or later by a few
minutes &mdash; that Schmalz admitted; but at any rate nothing happened to give
these women an idea that they were living in the presence of the brutal
murderer who had just despatched Miss Gilchrist. Things, they said, proceeded
in the ordinary way; there was nothing to attract their attention. So far as I
can see, we have proved that he could not have been near the scene till a
quarter to seven; and his own people think that he was in about seven as usual,
or a few minutes after. I would press upon you, gentlemen, the evidence given
by Schmalz, the servant, and by the girl Antoine. You may call Antoine what you
like, but did she look yesterday as if she was telling a pack of lies? Schmalz
was cross-examined for about half an hour, and never lost a feather. She told a
simple story, and she stuck to it, although she was tried and tested in every
way. The girl Antoine &mdash; you saw how much moved she was ! What happened to
her? Was it mercy, or was it because there was no success with Schmalz? The
LORD ADVOCATE never asked her a single question in cross-examination. If a
witness is dismissed without any questions being asked, is her story being
accepted? The LORD ADVOCATE may say. "It was not worth my while"; but it
remains the fact as regards this important evidence that he has not spoken
about it to-day &mdash; he has not mentioned the name of Schmalz or Antoine.
Did either woman strike you as being an untruthful witness? And if Antoine
lives the life that is alleged, is she to be deprived of every human right? If
she speaks a word for a man whom she believes to be innocent, is she to be
told, "We know what you are, and we will not accept a word of what you say"! If
the man who is being tried for his life says, "Here is a person who has
something to say in my favour" &mdash; is your reply to be, "We cannot accept
it: it may be the only thing you have to rest on, but still it is not to be
accepted, because you lead a life that is deplorable"! In the concluding
remarks of the LORD ADVOCATE he did tell you that you must have no reasonable
doubt left in your mind before convicting the prisoner in this case. Do you see
any reason whatever to doubt the evidence that was given by that loyal woman,
be she what you like? The servant girl told us a plain story. Is she not to be
believed either? Remember their evidence squares absolutely with the evidence
given by Rattman and Aumann, and almost demonstrates the impossibility of the
prisoner being guilty. The murderer must have been long about the place; how
else could he see if there was anybody going in or out, or that the coast was
clear? Yet Slater was elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Now, gentlemen, the murder is committed, and there was the hue and cry.
Everybody in Glasgow is up to see if they cannot hunt the murderer down. What
is done by the alleged murderer? What about his "flight from justice"? On
Tuesday he is at the pawn office redeeming his binocular glasses. When he was
redeeming them he told the witness Kempton, "I am going to America," and he
discussed the advantages of going by the Anchor Line. Now, that is on the day
when all the papers are full of the murder. Is that like the action of a
murderer &mdash; just doing the same thing as he had done the day before when
he was collecting his things, and taking measures to get his money paid and his
property realised? I ask you to consider this &mdash; he had succeeded (it is
said) in perpetrating this crime, and next day he walks quietly down to the
pawn-broker's, and does the same as he did the day before &mdash; only this
time it is his binocular glasses ! That does not strike one as the proceeding
of a man who was engaged in a "flight from justice." One other strange thing is
this, which I omitted to mention, the prisoner was seen after the murder
&mdash; upon the same night. His people say (as I have already said) that he
went home in the usual course for dinner about seven o'clock on the 21st. Well,
at 9.45 he presents himself at a club to see if he could raise the wind. The
clubmaster refuses to give him any money on his cheque. What was his appearance
when he presented himself there? The clubmaster says that he was absolutely
composed; well, he said (I think) that he was excited a little, but so little
that he thought he had been losing money. That is the man who was fleeing from
justice; yet, at 9.45 he presents himself to the clubmaster Henderson, and
Henderson sees nothing at all in his appearance to suggest that he had come
from murder. He asks for money, and he is refused. He goes away making use of
the expression that his friend Cameron, to whom he was referred, is "no use."
If these are blood spots that are on that coat now, these blood spots were
freshly on it then, and yet they were not seen ! If he was the murderer, what
did he do with his coat? Where was he washing his coat so that nothing was
seen, and there is not a speck of blood to be found on it? And, mind you, he
has done the whole of that between 7.10 and 9.45. He has washed his clothes so
thoroughly that the medical men cannot find a speck of blood now ! This is the
coat that the murderer was wearing, if the Crown is right. Now, is there a man
anywhere of such extraordinary callousness that he can remain in a billiard
room to within a quarter of an hour of such a tragedy, and after coolly call
upon this man at the club, wearing the very garments in which he committed the
murder? The clubmaster says, "I saw no sign of his being put out in any way; I
thought he had been losing money at cards, as he seemed annoyed." That is all.
If this case is fairly considered, gentlemen, there is no answer to the case
put forward for the defence.</p>

  <p>But to proceed. Cameron says that on the 22nd or on the 23rd &mdash; I am
not sure which he says &mdash; he got the pawn ticket himself. Slater had tried
Rattman, and he had tried Aumann with the pawn ticket, but they would not
purchase. Rattman gave the ticket back to Slater, and Slater, on the Tuesday or
Wednesday, handed it to Cameron, who tells you that he tried Mr. Donaldson and
Mr. Allan, but with no result. Now, that is Tuesday or Wednesday. Is this
procrastination what you would expect from a man who had committed the crime?
Again, either on the 22nd or 23rd, I do not remember which, Nichols, the
barber, who has no association in any way with the prisoner, says that Slater
came into his shop and talked about going to Queensland, and he adds that he
also talked about going to San Francisco. We all know that the latter is quite
probable; and it is worthy of remark that, according to Nichols, he had then a
very noticeable moustache. I shall refer to that circumstance later. On the
23rd he wired Dent again from the Charing Cross Post Office, and, in order to
hurry up Dent, I suppose, he wired, "Must have watch; leaving to-morrow night
for the Continent"; he was going to America. By this time actually Rattman and
Cameron had his address as "Caesar Cafe, 344 Broadway, San Francisco." Not only
at twelve o'clock does he wire to hurry up Dent, but at four o'clock he is at
Cooks' to see about tickets by the "Lusitania" for New York on the Saturday. He
told Cooks' that he was going to America, and the only question was as to the
price of the berth. A question was raised the following day as to whether it
was to be an outside or an inside berth &mdash; but does not all this show that
every action is directed towards getting his affairs put right and starting for
San Francisco as the result of his resolve upon the Monday morning? We have the
letter from Messrs. Cook to the Cunard Line, and the answer of the 24th that
the applicants could have Room E76. The steamer plan was shown on the 24th to
Slater, and he said, "That is an inside berth; I would much prefer an outside
one." And then the letter of Messrs. Cook to the Cunard Line proceeds &mdash;
"He, however, replied that he could do better with you in Liverpool. We asked
him if he would take our ticket for Room E76 and endeavour to adjust with you
in Liverpool on Saturday. He has promised to give us his decision to-morrow, on
receipt of which we will advise you." Gentlemen, the murder had been committed
three or four days ago by this time; the flight from justice has not yet begun!
The prisoner, in the most leisurely manner, is going round the ordinary places
that a man would go to when he is preparing a departure. The man in Cooks'
office says that in manner he was perfectly cool and collected on the 23rd, and
yet on the 23rd that extraordinary man Sancroft, the tramway car conductor,
says that his mere asking of a boy if there was anything found out about the
murderer led Slater to jump from a car and race for his life, apparently, up a
side street. This is the man who is going about quite cool and collected!
Sancroft made his evidence quite absurd when he said, "I cannot say whether the
man heard the conversation between the boy and myself, but I thought it
strange." Sancroft did not know at that time even what the suspected man was
like &mdash; he said he had not yet got the published description of the man;
yet, having seen a person leaving a tramway car in a hurry, and thinking back
on it, Sancroft realises he is an amateur detective, and that he has got the
man. As against that you have the evidence of those people among whom the
prisoner went, cool and collected.</p>

  <p>Slater did not go back to Messrs. Cook on the 25th, as was expected, and
the reason is quite simple. These people, called Freedman, arrived in Glasgow
on the morning of the 25th. It is suggested that this is all a story, that it
is not true that the accused was trying to dispose of his flat before leaving
for America; but you have got this fact, in the first place, that Aumann was up
and looked over the flat, and you have this also definitely proved, that Mrs.
Freedman, and another person arrived on the Friday morning from London. They
were at the Alexandra Hotel. In reply to a post-card from them, Schmalz was
sent over to the Alexandra Hotel twice on the Friday morning. She said that she
did not see Mrs. Freedman the first time, but on the second occasion she
brought her over to the flat. It was then arranged that Schmalz was to stop and
hand over the keys to Mrs. Freedman on the Saturday, and then leave for London
herself, and this she, in point of fact, did at 10 p.m. The Freedmans did
arrive, and that put the arrangements a little out, and led to Slater failing
in his appointment at the office of Messrs. Cook. Anyhow, we are now arrived at
this point: on the 23rd the prisoner has lifted his &pound;39, and on the 24:th
he has got &pound;49 as the proceeds of his 2&frac12; per cent, stock. He saw
Cameron the same evening. Further, Cameron, during the day of the 24th, went
with him to the Cunard offices and tried to get a &pound;5 note for five single
notes. They were ultimately successful after trying two or three places; he got
a &pound;5 note at the Grosvenor Restaurant. They then went to the post office
in Hope Street, where the accused got a letter registered and sent to Germany.
Cameron says that he was told it was the prisoner's Christmas present to his
people. The post office girl proved the despatch of that letter. Now we are at
Friday, the 25th, the day they leave for America.</p>

  <p>All these preparations, you will bear in mind, were carried through by
the prisoner under the name of Oscar Slater. When it comes to the Friday he
goes down to Nichols, the barber, and recovers the bottles, shaving materials,
and things of that kind which he had deposited there. He tells Nichols, the
barber, that he is leaving that night to join the "Lusitania" at Liverpool. He
has gone as Oscar Slater all through' the week doing these things openly, and
he tells the barber on the very night of his departure that he is going to
travel by the "Lusitania" to New York. Is there a vestige of suspicion in all
this of a person who is on a flight from justice? What plausibility is there in
the suggestion that it was because of the evening papers on the Friday
afternoon that he fled from justice? He has been doing all this through the
week, and has not concealed his movements or his name in any way at all. On the
Friday evening he goes down to the Central Station and engages a badge porter
about six o'clock. The porter goes up to his house about 8.20. What possible
suspicion is there about anything that happened that evening? Those two ladies,
the Misses Fowlis, who lived in the flat above, took a very keen interest in
the proceedings of the Slater household, and hung over the banisters to see
what was happening; they said they were waiting for the postman. They saw the
baggage being taken out of the house. Now, we know that was arranged for
before. There was a servant from the Bernstein's house, which was on the same
stair. She said she thought it was very strange, these people going away,
because a detective had come to Bernstein's house half an hour before, and she
thought that Slater was clearing out because the detective had been there.
This, gentlemen, is a mere afterthought. You know that the prisoner had been
preparing to go away for days before, and he knew nothing of the detective's
visit. There was another strange suspicion. After the porters had carried away
the baggage the Misses Fowlis looked out of the window, and they suggest that
these people went away separately, as guilty people might &mdash; that Slater
went by himself and the others went behind. Suppose you were going to the
station with two ladies and wanted a cab. Would you not go in advance to get
the cab? We know from the railway porter and from the badge porter that they
all arrived at the station in a cab. "What ground is there for suspicion in
this simple matter? Then it is said that the prisoner took tickets for London,
and went off to Liverpool instead. This is a matter which has not been
definitely cleared up; but is it not a curious thing that there were two third-
class tickets taken for Liverpool by the 9.5 train that night, and no one can
suggest whose tickets they were unless those of Slater and Antoine? Where is
the flight from justice? It has not begun yet, and nothing suggesting
subterfuge occurs until tickets were taken at Liverpool in the name of Otto
Sando. Let me say a word upon that matter. I ask you to remember this, that the
accused was a man living with a woman who was not his wife, and she was
travelling with him to the States. On the previous occasion when they went
abroad they took a false name, Mr. and Mrs. George. They are going abroad
again, partly because of this bother with Mrs. Slater in London, which Mr.
Rogers had written about, and also because Devoto had written for Slater to go
to San Francisco. Remember the woman pleaded to be allowed to go when the
prisoner thought it would be unwise for her to go in the winter, and it was her
weeping that eventually led to her being taken. In the main facts there is
nothing suspicious. Taking the name Otto Sando was very natural, because
whatever name he took must coincide with the initials already on the luggage.
They wanted to travel under some other name than that of Slater, and they
wanted to arrive at America as man and wife, because there is trouble upon
landing if a man comes with a woman who is not his wife. Now, that is plain
enough. I have no idea why he put down " Chicago" as his destination. I do not
know why he did a lot of things; but, on the broad facts and grounds of this
case, it is surely very plain that this cannot be called a flight from justice.
You see how slow the flight was; and it was only because, by a mere
coincidence, the police visit inspired by M'Lean happened on the day already
fixed for the prisoner's departure? the very day, too, upon which the
description was published in the newspapers &mdash; that he was supposed to
have fled at all. When this matter is examined there is nothing, I earnestly
submit, to lead you to say that this man had anything to do with the
perpetration of the crime.</p>

  <p>I have disposed, I think, of those prejudicial matters which led
everybody to regard Slater as being undeniably the murderer of this old lady.
It "was because he had pawned a brooch which was supposed to have belonged to
her, and because, when he was looked for, it was found that he had apparently
fled from justice.</p>

  <p>I now come to the direct evidence which had been led to support the
allegation that he is the perpetrator of the crime. My learned friend began by
saying that the first witness he had against the prisoner was Mrs. Liddell.
Just about five minutes before seven, on the night of 21st December, when she
was going home, she saw a man (so she said) leaning against the railings. She
said she got "bristly," and she gazed at him. His face was not sallow; it was
not white &mdash; but it was ivory white. She also explained the coat he was
wearing, and she said it was this man Slater. She was a person who was anxious
to give you the idea that she had very critically examined everything, and she
asked the prisoner to turn round in the dock. This was unnecessary. She had
seen him before at the police office. She was asked if the coat produced was
the coat he was then wearing, and she said it was not, because she had examined
the man's clothing very carefully, and there was a broad hem on his coat. She
said his coat was not a waterproof coat, but was a heavy cloth coat. She just
looked over her shoulder &mdash; and he glided away, and she knows no more
about the man. That is not very convincing, and the coat she speaks to is not
Slater's coat. Then how were you impressed with her evidence? The murder was
perpetrated within a quarter of an hour, and she never thought of mentioning
this mysterious man at all. She never mentioned him till Wednesday, the 23rd,
and she said her statement was received as a jest in the family. Her brother
said to her that there was no use in more of the family mixing themselves up in
this affair, and the other members of the family received her story as a
jest!</p>

  <p>The next witness is Helen Lambie. I frankly confess that I do not know
where I would have been in this case with the evidence of Helen Lambie, unless,
by good fortune, I had got the shorthand notes of the inquiry in New York. It
is deplorable to think that a man's life might depend on a chance circumstance
of that kind. You got a story in the witness-box here months after the event,
and I must say it had little correspondence with the first impressions of some
of the witnesses. It is not that the people are consciously dishonest; but,
having first thought the prisoner was only like the man, when they are taken
back and are shown him another time they say, "Yes, that is the man we saw
before." They identify him really as the man shown at the previous inspection,
but from this gradually they become convinced that they were certain at first
sight. The important thing, however, is, what did they say when they saw him
the first time? Now, this is crucial, and I must refer you to the evidence that
was given in America. Let me make a few preliminary observations. You remember
that Helen Lambie travelled to America with the little girl Barrowman, and they
occupied the same cabin. I do not know what you think would be likely to occur
in the way of conversation between a girl of twenty-one and a girl of fifteen
who were occupying the same bedroom for ten days, and who were both going to
give evidence as regards this strange affair &mdash; they knew they were both
to be witnesses. The Lord Advocate said to Mary Barrowman, "But, of course,
Mary, you were advised by the people connected with the case not to speak about
it," and she said, "Yes, I was not to speak about it." Do you believe they did
not? What happened next was this. These two girls were in the corridor of the
Court, and Slater came down between a man, who is 6 feet 3 inches, and another
man who was wearing a medallion. Neither of these two was at all like the man
who was wanted. With the two girls there was Detective Pyper. Detective Pyper
tells you that he never saw the men approaching; the first he knew about it was
both girls exclaiming, "Oh, there he is going into the Court!" He says that he
was looking in the other direction, because he was expecting the arrival of a
Mr. Fox, who was conducting the Crown case in America in the extradition
proceedings. While he was looking for Mr. Fox the man had walked about 10 or 12
yards down the corridor. Helen Lambie's first remark was, "Oh, I could almost
swear that is the man." The little girl Barrowman, you will remember, had been
to Mr. Fox's office already in the forenoon, and had been prepared by
photographs of Slater which had been submitted to her. Detective Pyper said
that they were not very good, and that she failed then to recognise them as
photographs of the man whom she had seen running down the street in Glasgow.
But when the girl saw the man walking down the corridor, a man who was like (I
suggest) the man in the photographs, she said that she identified him. What
happened between Helen Lambie and the girl Barrowman while the man was walking
towards them nobody knows, because no independent witness can speak to it; may
the suspicion of one not have prompted the other? Well, at any rate, the
evidence is distinct that all Helen Lambie said at first was, "I could almost
swear that is the man." Now, let us see why she could almost swear it was the
man. When she came into the American Court she was asked, "Now, do you see the
man here you saw that night?" Here is her answer, which has been read to you
before, "One is very suspicious, if anything." Gentlemen, is that an
identification? She then proceeds, "The clothes he had on that night he has not
got on to-day, but his face I could not tell." She was then asked, "What did
you say about his face?" and she replied, "I could not tell about his face; I
never saw his face." Gentlemen, she did not see his face&mdash; but perhaps it
will be more satisfactory if I read her evidence in detail. It proceeds
thus&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">Tell us what kind of clothes he had on, if you can &mdash;
a description? &mdash; It was a three-quarter, something like a waterproof
coat, three-quarter length.</p>

  <p class="quote">Had it any colour that you could recognise? &mdash; It was
a kind of fawn colour.</p>

  <p class="quote">What kind of a hat or cap or what did he have on? &mdash;
It looks like one of those Donegal caps.</p>

  <p class="quote">Now, can you give us anything further in connection with
this man that you can tell us about? &mdash; No; I could not.</p>

  <p class="quote">Did you notice anything about his walk? &mdash; Yes, sir, I
did.</p>

  <p class="quote">Tell us what about his walk that impressed you? &mdash; He
didn't walk straight, but it was some</p>

  <p class="quote">But his gait, his manner of walking, was there anything
about that that you noticed? Did you notice anything about the style of
walking? &mdash; Yes, sir.</p>

  <p class="quote">What was there about that that impressed you? &mdash; He
was sort of shaking himself a little I'll show you how he was walking.
(Illustrating.)</p>

  <p class="quote">Since you have been here have you seen anybody walking like
that? &mdash; Yes, sir, I have, sir.</p>

  <p class="quote">Is that man in this room? &mdash; Yes, he is, sir.</p>

  <p class="quote">Point him out to us if you can? &mdash; I wouldn't like to
say.</p>

  <p class="quote">Now, point out the man; that is all we ask you to do.</p>

  <p class="quote">MR. MILLER &mdash; I object unless you ask her whether she
has seen more than one man walk like that.</p>

  <p class="quote">THE COMMISSIONER &mdash; The question is, do you see in
this room among all of us people here the man that you passed that night?
&mdash; I think you ought to let the man walk, and I can pick him out.</p>

  <p class="quote">You have seen him walk? &mdash; Let him get another chance;
give the man a chance.</p>

  <p class="quote">Cross-examination by Mr. MILLER &mdash; Didn't you state a
moment ago that you did not see the man's face? &mdash; Neither I did. I saw
the walk; it is not the face I went by, but the walk.</p>

  <p>Now, gentlemen, that is the evidence that Helen Lambie gave in
America.</p><br>

  <p>LORD GUTHRIE &mdash; You might read the two or three intervening
sentences.</p>

  <p>Mr. M'CLURE &mdash; Very well. They are as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">THE COMMISSIONER &mdash; Is the man in this room that
passed you in that hallway?</p>

  <p class="quote">THE WITNESS &mdash; Yes, sir.</p>

  <p class="quote">THE COMMISSIONER &mdash; Where is he. Point him out?
&mdash; He is sitting here. (Indicating the defendant.)</p>

  <p class="quote">Is that all you have to identify this man as the man you
saw in the hall? &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Now, that, of course, is not the story that was given by Helen Lambie
here. It was the walk, and the walk only, in America. I know that yesterday,
owing to the request of some of the jurymen. Slater was made to walk down one
of the passages after the Court rose, and the gentlemen of the jury were
present. I cannot tell what impression the parade made upon the minds of the
jury &mdash; you will consider that for yourselves. I would submit that the way
the man walked was in no way characteristic. There was nothing in his gait that
would enable you &mdash; much less a person who saw a man walk across Miss
Gilchrist's hall for two seconds before he got out of the door &mdash; to
identify him as the person who had been in that hall. That is a matter for you
to judge of; but you will also recollect that Detective Pyper was asked whether
he saw anything characteristic in Slater's walk by which he could recognise
him, and he said there was nothing in the walk of the man that impressed him.
Mr. Warnock, who was in America, said that by looking very closely he thought
he could see some sort of pitch of the knee. I only put it to you as fair men,
is that evidence upon which you would ever think of taking a man's life? But
Helen Lambie has gone back on her original story. She now says that she got a
look at his face, and she says the man was clean shaven. Well, Slater was not,
if you accept the evidence of Nichols, who shaved him on the 25th. He had then
a very noticeable moustache.</p>

  <p>The next witness is Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams says to you that he was standing
in a better position than Helen Lambie to see the man who was in the house,
and, while he thought the prisoner is very like him, he would not swear to him.
Here is what he said in America &mdash; and I ask you to remember that he and
the little girl Barrowman and Helen Lambie were all in the room together when
this took place&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">THE COMMISSIONER &mdash; Is there anybody in the room that
you identify as the man?</p>

  <p class="quote">THE WITNESS &mdash; I couldn't say positively. This man
(indicating the defendant) is not at all unlike him. I only got a passing
glance at him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Adams I thought was very fair, and he said undoubtedly that there was
a resemblance. Then I read this further from his evidence in America&mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">Did you notice his crooked nose? &mdash; No.</p>

  <p class="quote">Did you notice anything remarkable about his gait and walk?
&mdash; No, I thought he walked like a commercial traveller.</p>

  <p class="quote">An ordinary walk? &mdash; Just an ordinary walk.</p>

  <p>What, gentlemen, becomes of Helen Lambie's identification? &mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">You don't swear this is the man you saw? &mdash; No, sir.</p>

  <p class="quote">You don't identify him with the man that passed you?
&mdash; I say he resembles him in appearance. That is all I can say.</p>

  <p>He had also seen a photograph before. Now, you are trying a man for his
life, and there are two witnesses who (let us suppose) had equal opportunities
of seeing the culprit, and the one said, "I will not swear to this man; he is
like him, but I will not go further than that"; and the other said, "I could
almost swear that is the man"; would you be prepared on that evidence to find
it proved that he was the man and to take his life? Would you not, gentlemen,
be taking a large responsibility? Mr. Adams, who failed to identify, says that
he was in a better position to see than Helen Lambie; Helen Lambie says it was
not his face at all that attracted her attention, but only his walk &mdash;
which has no marked peculiarity &mdash; surely it is plain that the safe
evidence was that given by Mr. Adams, and not by Helen Lambie ! The witnesses
for the Crown have said that this man's walk is not peculiar in any respect at
all.</p>

  <p>Now, what about Barrowman? She is going along the road, when out of a
close comes a man. You will remember it is seven o'clock on a December night.
He ran down the steps very fast, we know &mdash; that is the evidence of Mr.
Adams, who used the expression "like greased lightning." The person &mdash;
whoever he was &mdash; hesitated for a moment, then turned and ran, as hard as
he was able, past the little girl, and down West Cumberland Street to the left.
Can you take it that the little girl's identification is worth your serious
regard? It is said that the man had on a Donegal hat. A Donegal hat is a tweed
hat with a rim all round it. It is also said that he had brown boots.
Gentlemen, they have been through all his baggage &mdash; they have produced
everything that would assist them &mdash; but there are no brown boots, and
there is no Donegal hat! The only thing similar is the waterproof. Now, this
man was running as fast as he could. I would ask you, would you undertake to
identify a man who raced past you on the street &mdash; in the vicinity of a
lamp, it is quite true? The description originally given in the paper was this
&mdash; and this is from Barrowman &mdash; "The man wanted is about twenty-
eight or thirty years of age, tall and thin, with his face shaved clear of all
hair. A distinctive feature is that his nose is slightly turned to the right
side." How could the little girl Barrowman possibly see all that when the man
was flying past?" He wore one of the popular round tweed hats known as Donegal
hats, and a fawn-coloured overcoat, which might have been a waterproof, and
also dark trousers and brown boots." Who has come to say that the possessions
of this man included brown boots or a Donegal hat? Can you yourselves now say
that "a nose slightly twisted to one side" is rightly descriptive of the
prisoner's nose? Would you say that all these things could be accurately
observed by a young girl in a momentary glance like that? It is past belief.</p>

  <p>The next witness is Annie Armour, who was employed at the Subway station.
Her evidence is not of great importance. She heard about the murder some time
after, and it recalled to her mind that one night between 7.30 and 8 &mdash;
she cannot exactly tell when &mdash; a man hurried up to the booking office,
laying down a penny, passed on without waiting for a ticket, and went down the
stair to the station. She said that his coat was darker than the coat of the
prisoner produced, and she had no doubt he was clean shaven. Now, the prisoner
was not clean shaven. You know from Nichols, the barber, that he had a very
noticeable moustache at the time, and I say no more upon this.</p>

  <p>Accordingly you have these three leading witnesses for the Crown, Lambie,
Adams, and Barrowman &mdash; Adams declining to say more than that the prisoner
is like; Barrowman alleging that she, with an instantaneous glance at a man
flying along the street, is able to give a detailed description, which,
however, does not tally closely with the prisoner; and Lambie &mdash; if we
take her American evidence, which was the first &mdash; only referring to his
walk. As you saw, the walk has no peculiarity, and Detective Pyper said there
was nothing in it to attract his attention. I do not see how, in a matter of
this gravity, you can accept and act upon evidence so inconclusive and
uncertain. And that is the only evidence of real moment in the case.</p>

  <p>I make also this remark &mdash; do you not generally find that when a
bloody murder has been perpetrated, the person who perpetrates the murder has
blood upon him? The man who escaped that night certainly had blood about him.
Where he is God knows, but we know where this man is! We have got this man's
clothes, and they bear no trace of blood. Where did he wash his clothes between
7 and 9.45? How had he got rid of everything? Again, what about the weapon? The
doctors are uncertain as to the hammer being a likely instrument to cause the
injuries that resulted in death, but, even if it were, hammer and coat alike
are absolutely free from blood. Do you see any plausibility in the suggestion
that the hammer has been scraped and washed to remove traces of blood? Our
doctors tell you that they would have great difficulty in removing traces of
blood in that way; but, suppose it was tried, why did the murderer not wash and
scrape the whole handle, and especially where his hand gripped the weapon? It
must have been covered with blood if it was used, yet it has not been cleansed,
and upon it there was no blood found. Why is the prisoner so different from all
other murderers? There is no trace of blood on anything belonging to him, and
how could he get rid of it all in two hours?</p>

  <p>There is only one other point remaining, that is, as regards the very
extraordinary identification of the prisoner as a man who was going about the
neighbourhood, lurking, and secreting himself in closes. First of all, there
was the family of M'Haffie. Mrs. M'Haffie identified the prisoner as the man
who had walked backward and forward in this street. That, of course, would not
prove that he was the man who committed the crime; it would only show that he
was in the neighbourhood, and no more. The daughter, again, in the month of
March, would not say that this was the man, although she now agrees with her
mother. But there is another point &mdash; all the M'Haffies have described the
man they saw as a man who was wearing checked trousers and light-coloured
spats. The prisoner has never been seen anywhere with checked trousers or with
light-coloured spats, and none of these has been found in his baggage. Was he
so careful as to destroy not only the clothes that he wore on the night of the
murder, but also all the clothes that he had worn at any other time I And you
will recollect this: one of the Miss M'Haffies was asked by his lordship if,
when the man asked at the door for Anderson, he had a foreign accent, and she
said "No." Now, the prisoner's foreign accent is pronounced. That is the family
of M'Haffies. Nearly every one of these witnesses contradicts the other.</p>

  <p>Take now Miss Cunningham, who walked with the witness Campbell to dinner
every day, and saw this strange man. She identified the prisoner, curiously,
from a photograph. She says that "the man was absolutely clean shaven, and that
she had a good opportunity of seeing him," while the photograph from which she
recognised the prisoner was that of a man with a black moustache. That is not
very convincing. When she saw the accused she said, "That is the man."
Campbell, on the other hand, says that he was nearer the man than she was, and
he declines to say that the prisoner was the man. He will only say that he
resembles the man, and that is all. Then there are two other witnesses, Bryson
and Nairn. These are both witnesses as to Sunday, 20th December. Bryson says
that at twenty minutes to eight he was walking along the street and saw a dark-
haired man with a sallow complexion, who had a long nose of a peculiar shape,
prominent in the middle, broken, and had a slight moustache. He told you how
this man was gazing, with an intentness that he had never seen equalled, at the
house opposite. The man was at that time in a black morning coat or jacket, and
with slightly grey trousers. Nairn saw, it is supposed, the same person at
9.15. Nairn is the witness who only saw his back, and he says that the man had
dark hair. Now, there is an hour and a half between these two witnesses. When
Bryson saw the man he had a black morning coat and slightly grey trousers; when
Nairn saw him he had a light coat and a black cloth cap. Between 7.40 and 9.15
this man had presumably gone home and changed his coat before coming out for a
second period of observation !</p>

  <p>Against all that, I want to know what weight you are going to give to the
evidence given by the witness Reid to-day and the evidence given yesterday by
Schmalz and Antoine? Reid left for Belfast on 21st December, and his last
Sunday in Glasgow, the 20th, was passed dining with Slater along with his
little boy, aged five. He positively swore that on 20th December he dined with
Slater, going there about six and not leaving till 10.30. If there is any truth
in that &mdash; which is spoken to by three witnesses &mdash; what comes of the
evidence of Bryson at 7.40 and of Nairn at 9.15? It cannot have been Slater.
Then also I ask you to remember Bryson's statement that he made a remark to his
wife upon the appearance of the man, and said that he was there for no good;
but his wife does not remember of any man being there, or of her husband making
any remark whatsoever. Would any one with a sense of responsibility accept such
evidence?</p>

  <p>Finally, there are two policemen. One of them said he saw a man feigning
that he was drunk, and the other said that he saw the prisoner &mdash; and he
identified him rather curiously. He had waved his hand to a man because he
thought he knew him &mdash; mistaking him for his friend Paradise, to whom he
thought he was waving his hand. If he could make a mistake like that, surely he
might quite well mistake some one else for the prisoner. This kind of evidence
is really no good at all; the possibility of error is manifest. Just take this
contrast: the man wanted is alleged to have been clean shaven by Mrs. Liddell,
Helen Lambie, Barrowman, Adams, and Armour. It is, on the contrary, proved that
Slater had a moustache by Rattman, Aumann, Cameron, Reid, Nichols, the barber;
Gibb, the billiard room man; Kempton, and Tracey. It is demonstrated by these
people who knew him well that the prisoner had a noticeable moustache at the
time the murder was committed. Now, I have really done with the evidence, and I
believe I have demonstrated that, upon anything like a fair view of it, the
prisoner cannot be identified as the murderer. No responsible jury, I think,
would ever venture to convict.</p>

  <p>I should like now, in concluding, to make a remark upon a case that
happened. Do you remember the case of Adolph Beck? He was a man against whom
allegations were made by a number of women in London. Beck, in mistake for a
man called Smith, was sworn to by ten women and two policemen, and he got seven
years' penal servitude. The women had all had full opportunities of knowing
him; he had sat and talked with them all, at times, for half an hour or an
hour; and all ten women swore that Beck was the man who had got jewellery from
them on various representations. The charges were backed up by the evidence of
two police constables who knew Smith; and so Beck got seven years' penal
servitude. The unfortunate man served the whole of his time and then came out.
Smith had not been convicted, and was by this time at his old game, with the
same class of fraud on a new lot of people. Again some women who had been
defrauded in this way came forward, and they accused Adolph Beck. He was once
more tried, protesting his innocence as he had done during the earlier trial;
but he was convicted again on positive evidence given by people who said they
had passed a certain time with him, to whom he had talked, and whom he had
defrauded. He was sentenced to five years' penal servitude. The judge who tried
the case, on reflection, thought that there was something wrong about this
conviction, and the result was a Parliamentary inquiry before Lord Justice
Collins. After everything had been sifted out, both the convictions against
Beck were quashed, and the taxpayers of this country paid him &pound;2000 as a
solatium for the injury that had been done to him.</p>

  <p>Now, ten witnesses in Beck's case swore to the accused as a man whom they
knew and had spoken to. In the subsequent inquiry witnesses came who said that,
knowing both Smith and Beck, they did not think there was a great resemblance
between them. Gentlemen, Beck was not tried on a capital charge. If he had been
tried on a capital charge and convicted, what would have been the reparation?
You cannot give &pound;2000 to a dead man! In that case there was the sworn
testimony of ten concurring witnesses who had ample opportunity of knowing him.
Was that class of evidence not better than the stuff you have got here &mdash;
self-contradictory, inconclusive, given by witnesses who had no personal
acquaintance with the accused? What are you to do in this case? Are you going
to say, with that warning in front of you, that you find this man guilty of the
murder of this old lady? If you do so, then it is quite certain that it is
final; no reparation can follow. I ask you to bear that in mind. I do not
believe I am speaking at present to men who are in the least wanting in a sense
of responsibility. I am speaking to men who have listened with great care, and
are thoroughly prepared, I believe, to lay aside all prepossessions created by
the newspapers, and to judge the case only by the evidence which has been led.
Can you lay your hands on your hearts now and say that you are convinced that
this is the man who committed that murder? If you are, then the responsibility
is yours, and not mine. If you are not convinced up to that point, surely you
will give this man &mdash; I will not say the benefit of the doubt &mdash; but
the benefit of the evidence which has been led. I think it is proved that he
was not out of his house on the 20th, and there is only a blank of about a
quarter of an hour unaccounted for on the 21st, when this murder was committed.
That might happen to any of us, and are you on that account to sacrifice a
life? I do not believe it for a moment: the evidence warrants an acquittal.
And, while nobody expects any of you sitting in the jury-box to do more than
exercise a sound judgment, you will take care, I trust, that your judgment is
sound. If, contrary to my expectation, it should lead to an irreparable wrong,
then yours alone will be the responsibility.</p>

  <h2><a id="charge" name="charge">LORD GUTHRIE'S CHARGE TO THE JURY</a></h2>

  <p>LORD GUTHRIE, in charging the jury, said &mdash; Gentlemen of the jury,
there are cases in the criminal Courts, as well as in the civil Courts, where
the judge, addressing the jury, draws their attention to the important nature
of the issue they have to try. Obviously, in this case, any such observation
would be an impertinence. You have shown by your close attention that you
thoroughly realise the gravity of the charge against the prisoner, that this is
a case where a human life is involved.</p>

  <p>When a man, going on an unlawful errand, uses force which results in
death, that is murder, whether he intends to kill or only means to overcome
resistance, or to prevent an alarm. In this case, looking to the nature and
number of the injuries, it is certain that the man who killed Miss Gilchrist
meant, at all events in the later blows, not only to prevent her giving an
alarm, but also to make certain that she should not ultimately recognise and
identify him. In short, "dead men (and dead women) tell no tales." I do not
agree with Mr. M'CLURE when he assumed, in the powerful, accurate, and
judicious speech which he made for his client, that the man who entered Miss
Gilchrist's house went with deliberate intention to murder her. He argued that
the prisoner could not be the man who killed Miss Gilchrist, because his
conduct immediately before was inconsistent with his having murder in his
heart. Gentlemen, it may well be that the man who killed Miss Gilchrist went
without any intention of murder. Why should he? She was at the time the only
person in the common stair (the servant had gone out for an indefinite period),
a feeble old lady of eighty-three years of age. He, no doubt, expected she
would make no resistance, that she would give him the keys, and that he would
get away, possibly masked so as to avoid her identification, without touching
her at all. This expectation failed. She did resist, she cried out, she knocked
on the floor (the meaning of which he would at once know), and then arose the
necessity to silence her.</p>

  <p>In this case there is no question of law for me to discuss and determine.
There are questions of fact and of fact alone, and yours must be the
responsibility, because it is your opinion on the facts that must determine the
verdict. Therefore, it might be enough that I should now leave the case with
that statement in your hands, but long experience in criminal matters and
professional training may enable a judge to help a jury to make up their own
minds, first by observations on the different classes of evidence led, and then
by directing attention to the vital parts of the evidence.</p>

  <p>As Mr. M'CLURE well said, it is only evidence that we have got to look
at, not rumour, whether in the newspapers or outside the newspapers, and we
have surely got enough evidence in this case to servo the turn, for the Crown
examined sixty witnesses and the defence examined fourteen, making seventy-four
in all.</p>

  <p>The case appears to have given rise to the usual crop of rumours, mostly
unfounded, or so entirely exaggerated as in no way to represent the truth. It
would, again, be impertinent to suggest that you need to be warned not to take
any of these into consideration.</p>

  <p>First, let us consider the evidence as a whole. You have direct evidence,
and you have circumstantial evidence. By direct evidence I mean evidence
directly identifying the prisoner with the person who was undoubtedly the
murderer. You will have no doubt that the man that Lambie and Adams saw leaving
the house, and the man that Barrowman, the message girl, saw on the street
coming out of the close was the same man, and was the murderer. You may
probably also think the man who haunted the street in the vicinity of the house
for days before the murder was identical with the person who was seen leaving
the house by Lambie, Adams, and Barrowman. If you think he was the murderer,
then, in regard to him also you have direct evidence. But, whether he was the
prisoner or not, whether the man leaving the house was the prisoner or not, is
for you to determine.</p>

  <p>Then we have a good deal of circumstantial evidence in regard to the
prisoner's conduct before, on, and after 21st December, which I shall refer to
later. Much of that evidence is important, when taken along with its
surroundings, although taken by itself it may be of little or no consequence.
For instance, a man passing under an alias, a man giving a false address and a
false profession, a man showing excitement, a man wanting to release his funds,
a man wanting to go hurriedly to another country &mdash; these things by
themselves are consistent with innocence, but, coupled with the direct
evidence, if you accept it as applying to the prisoner, they may be suggestive
or even conclusive of guilt. They may, to put it otherwise, afford important
material in the way of corroboration.</p>

  <p>You have heard a good deal about evidence of character and about evidence
of financial circumstances. I think you will agree that both are double-edged.
The prisoner may found upon these elements as being in his favour, and the
Crown may found on them as being against him.</p>

  <p>About his character, proved by his own witnesses, by Cameron, his
companion and friend, and by Schmalz, his servant, there is no doubt at all. He
has maintained himself by the ruin of men and on the ruin of women, living for
years past in a way that many blackguards would scorn to live. That is an
illustration of what I mean when I talked of evidence being double-edged. It is
nothing remarkable to find a man of that kind taking a wrong name, telling a
lie about his destination, going by different names, murder or no murder. He
called himself Otto Sando after the murder, in view of going to America, the
particular name being selected apparently to square with the O.S. (Oscar
Slater) on his boxes, but then he had long before gone by the names of George
and Anderson, and it is possible that a desire to avoid the pursuit of his wife
&mdash; rather a nebulous person, so far as the evidence is concerned &mdash;
may have had something to do with this concealment. He called himself a dentist
in Glasgow, although he did not possess a single dentist's tool; but he had
assumed the same blind years before in London. He says to one person he is
going to the Continent, to another that his destination is Monte Carlo, to
another Chicago, to another San Francisco. If you or I had told false stories
about where we were going, if we were to travel under an assumed name, there
would be a strong inference that we had been doing something of a serious kind
that we wanted to conceal. In the case of a man like Oscar Slater, whose life
has been a living lie, that inference does not necessarily arise. These stories
I have referred to are all lies. But, then, the man's life has been not only a
lie for years, but is so to-day.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, I use the name "Oscar Slater." But that is not his name. I
never knew a case like the present, either in my own experience or from
reading. What is his name? He knows, and probably Antoine knows; but the Crown,
with all its means of investigation, has failed to find out. We do not know who
that man sitting in the dock really is. His fellow-countryman admitted that
there was no such German name as Slater. We do not know where he was born, who
his parents are, where he was brought up, what he was brought up to, whether he
was trained to anything. We do not know whether he ever did an honest day's
work in his life. The man remains a mystery as much as when this trial
began.</p>

  <p>The Lord Advocate founds on the prisoner's admittedly abandoned character
as a point in support of the Crown. He is entitled to do so, because a man of
that kind has not the presumption of innocence in his favour which is a form in
the case of every man, but a reality in the case of the ordinary man. Not only
is every man presumed to be innocent, but the ordinary man, in a case of brutal
ferocity like the present, has a strong presumption in his favour. In addition,
a man with the prisoner's sinister record may be capable of exhibiting a
callous behaviour even immediately after committing a murder. You will remember
that Mr. M'CLURE founded upon the prisoner's demeanour shortly after the time
of the murder. The Lord Advocate replies that a man of such a character after
the crime is over does not exhibit the symptoms that you would expect in the
case of a man of ordinary respectability, who had been goaded into violence by
drink or passion. You will consider that matter from both points of view,
telling in favour of the prisoner and telling against him.</p>

  <p>The financial circumstances also have been mentioned. The man is said to
have been hard up; he urgently wanted to realise money. I do not think that
these two circumstances, if they existed, would have much significance. They
were not confined to that period. He was hard up and wanting to realise money
for years before the murder was committed.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, all these circumstances are relevant to the case, but if you
make up your minds to convict the prisoner, you ought to be able to say to
yourselves, "We have disregarded his character, and we have disregarded his
financial circumstances, we have convicted him irrespective of these." But, if
you reach a conclusion against him, it may well strengthen that conclusion to
reflect on the two elements that I have mentioned. In short, they should not be
factors in reaching a conclusion, although they may very well support the
conclusion after it had been reached.</p>

  <p>Next we must consider the evidence of identification and its value. Not a
word too much has been said on that matter by the Lord Advocate and Mr.
M'Clure. It is extremely important. I express the point thus&mdash; it would
not be safe to convict the prisoner merely on the evidence of personal
impression of his identity with the man seen flying from the house, on the part
of strangers to him, without reference to any marked personality or personal
peculiarities, and without corroboration derived from other kinds of evidence.
My proposition involves a distinction between the identification, by personal
impression, of a strange person, and the identification, by personal
impression, of a familiar person. Suppose a father told you that his son, who
was resident in his house, had been seen by him in Princes Street yesterday.
That would be admirable evidence. But if a person who had only seen the son
once in his life told you that he had seen him in Princes Street yesterday that
would be evidence of slender value, unless the son had a marked personality, or
unless he had some peculiarity about him, such as a very peculiar walk, or
unless there were corroboration, such as that the man, when spoken to, answered
to the name of the particular individual. The distinction may be vitally
important in this case. Some of us may have doubles. "We have been told that we
have been in such and such a place by a competent and honest witness, who is
quite sure about it, and yet we had never been there at all. The most august
case is that of His Majesty the King. The illustrated papers are fond of
publishing a double of His Majesty, a person who has superficially a startling
resemblance to the King, but who would never be mistaken for the King by any
one about the Court. Then, again, people differ as to the extent of a
resemblance, or even whether there is any. You may have seen a strong
resemblance, but one of your friends says that he can see no resemblance at
all, and, when the two people are brought together, you see that there is
nothing but a very general similarity. That applies to the personal impression
of a stranger in reference to a stranger. Now, obviously, if the persons are
not strangers, then the position is entirely different, and it will be for you
to say in this case whether some of the evidence of identification &mdash; such
as that of the M'Haffies, who say that they saw the person watching the house
for days &mdash; is to be taken as the evidence of strangers, or as the
evidence of persons who had an opportunity of familiarising themselves, and who
did familiarise themselves, with the individual. Then you will say whether in
this case there were the marked personality and also the personal peculiarities
which may very well enable a man to be identified with certainty even by
persons who are strangers to him. And you will say, thirdly, apart from all
that, whether the points of corroboration detailed to you by the Lord Advocate
are or are not sufficient to show that, if the identification is not by itself
sufficient, at all events it is sufficient when taken along with the
corroboration on which he founded.</p>

  <p>The case of Adolf Beck was most properly dwelt upon by Mr. M'CLURE&mdash;
a very startling narrative. In that case women &mdash; not of respectable
character, but acting admittedly <i>bona fide</i>, and competent to form a
reliable opinion, with no motive to make a wrong statement &mdash; swore,
without doubt or hesitation, that the man in the dock, Adolf Beck, was the man
who had defrauded them. And it turned out that they were wrong. They had
mistaken Beck for another man. Smith, the real criminal. There was no
corroboration, and in point of fact Adolf Beck had a resemblance to the man
Smith. Sad to say. Beck was convicted. Now, in this case, there is one thing
quite clear &mdash; the prisoner is like the murderer. But, then, he is not
charged with being like the murderer; he is charged with being the murderer.
Yet I do not think you can doubt, after the body of evidence led before you,
that he has at least a marked resemblance to the man who haunted the street
outside Miss Gilchrist's house, and to the man who was seen coming from the
house. You have to say whether the Crown has proved that he is the man. Keep
this also in view &mdash; the witnesses brought before you as to identification
were all Scotch, while the prisoner is a foreigner. A Scotch person has a much
more delicate sense of identification in regard to one of his own people than
he has in regard to a foreigner. Suppose you are dealing with a negro. White
people say that they cannot see any difference between negroes. That is because
we are not accustomed to see them. In the same way with a foreigner. A
Scotchman is apt to say, "Oh, he is a foreign -looking man," and he does not
know the subtle differences that, of course, exist among foreigners as they do
among our own people. Therefore the mere fact that a witness thought that the
prisoner was the same as the man seen leaving the house, because both of them
had a foreign appearance, goes for very little, if it goes for anything at
all.</p>

  <p>These are the observations I think it proper to make in regard generally
to the different classes of evidence, and that brings me to the question of
what the direct evidence is. It has been gone into very fully and very fairly
and moderately by the Lord Advocate and by Mr. M'Clure, and I do not intend to
go through it, but I may tell you that I have a note of the pages where each
witness expresses the exact state of his or her impression, and I shall detail
them, if you express a desire that I should do so. Some say, "I think he was
like"; some say, "I think he was very like "; some say, "That is the man ";
some say, "I will swear that is the man." Gentlemen, I do not think you will
attach cardinal importance to the mere form of expression. That depends largely
upon the idiosyncrasy of the witness. I take a single illustration. The girl
Lambie was shown the coat No. 43, and when she was asked if that was like the
coat, she said, "No, it is the coat." That is evidently inaccurate. Why, dozens
of coats like that could be produced out of the shops, and, in the absence of
accidental marks, nobody could be certain of the particular coat. If they
professed to be certain, it would simply show that they did not know the
meaning of language. They could only say, "It resembles the coat in every way."
That is an illustration of how one witness &mdash; in this instance, a
superficial and unreflective girl of small mental capacity &mdash; fails to see
the difference between two things that are quite different, being able to say,
"That is like the thing" and being able to say, "It is the thing." If you agree
with the remark I have made about Lambie's evidence in regard to the coat, as
involving a want of power of discrimination on her part, you may come to the
same conclusion in regard to her identification of the man leaving the house.
When she says that the prisoner is the man, you may think she only means that
he is like the man.</p>

  <p>But the real question for you is, however they may phrase it, had the
witnesses any doubt in their own minds that the prisoner was the man whom they
saw haunting the street outside the house, and leaving the house? The Lord
Advocate has pointed out to you that, neither in regard to the crucial
witnesses nor in regard to the witnesses who came into incidental contact with
the man, have any of them expressed any positive doubt. By positive doubt, I
mean what occurs every day in the criminal Courts. A witness brought up for
identification says when asked, "Was that the man who robbed you?" &mdash;
"Well, I think so, but I think he was taller than that man, or I think he had
darker hair, or I think he had a mark on his face," and so on. The witness,
although identifying the person, expresses a doubt. Now, the Lord Advocate
quite properly stated that in this case not one of the witnesses has stated a
doubt in that sense; they have not said that, while they think he is the man,
there is a difference. A difference of dress amounts to nothing, because the
way in which the prisoner is dressed now is not necessarily the way he was
dressed at that time.</p>

  <p>In considering the question of identification, you will also keep in view
that the prisoner appears to have a distinct personality, a marked
individuality &mdash; you have only to look at him to see that he has &mdash;
because the most casual people, such as the Cunard office clerk, who only met
him once or twice for a short time, have identified him in reference to
occasions when the defence does not dispute that he was the man. It is
suggested that there was failure of identification on the part of the telegraph
clerk, who said she did not know who gave in a certain telegram sent by the
prisoner. But we have no evidence that it was the prisoner who gave it in; the
fact that the telegram was signed by him does not imply that he handed it in.
It is, therefore, clear that the prisoner is not just the ordinary type of
person of whom we say, "You cannot expect anybody to identify that man; he is
like a hundred other persons." Instead of that, the prisoner impressed his
individuality on every one he met under totally dissimilar circumstances.</p>

  <p>In regard to the three crucial witnesses &mdash; Lambie, Adams, and
Barrowman &mdash; Mr. M'Clure has properly said that you must not throw out of
account what they said in New York. No doubt, as the Lord Advocate put it, they
were there in difficult and unfamiliar circumstances, and perhaps methods were
used there that would not be allowed here. Still we have their evidence
recorded, and you have to consider the identification in New York as well as in
the Glasgow Police Office and in this Court. The girl Lambie said three things
in New York which are important for you to notice. First, she said, "One is
very suspicious, if anything." It is a little difficult to know what she meant,
because the sentence does not explain itself, and the reporter may not have
caught the whole answer. Then she said, "I saw the walk. It is not the face I
went by, but the walk." Third, she said, "I could nearly swear that was the
man." You have heard her evidence here, and I do not go over it. Here she is
positive that the prisoner is the man, but, again, I suggest to you that you
should take that in connection with her identification of the coat, and you
will probably hold that what she really means is, "So far as I can see, he
resembles him in every particular." One witness will say, "I swear that is the
man "; another, sensitive and timid, but meaning precisely the same thing, will
say, "I will not swear it, but I believe that is the man." The question is, had
they, when they were first examined, any doubt on the matter? If they had a
doubt on the matter, then that will necessarily weigh with you in your opinion
as to the weight of their evidence. Mr. Adams sums up his view by saying that
he identifies the prisoner. He was asked by Mr. M'Clure, "You do not give an
absolutely confident opinion that that was the man?" and he answers, "No, it is
too serious a charge for me to say from a passing glance." Gentlemen, one
cannot but regret &mdash; I do not blame Mr. Adams, the circumstances were very
peculiar &mdash; that he did not slam that door. The man escaped, and Mr. Adams
had only a passing glance at him, and Mr. M'Clure rightly tells you that it is
for you to judge whether that passing glance in the case, on the one hand, of a
man, who undoubtedly resembles the prisoner, and in the case, on the other
hand, of a prisoner who has undoubtedly a strong personality, is or is not
sufficient when taken along with other things.</p>

  <p>Then as to the girl Barrowman. You will consider whether, young as she
is, she was not a more impressive witness than Lambie. She showed no sign of
want of mental capacity, or want of judgment and good sense, and she displayed
no animus. She says she had no difficulty in telling that the prisoner was the
man when she saw him in New York. You heard about the dramatic incident of the
two girls pointing out the man when they were standing with Detective Pyper.
Then you will remember that, on being confronted with him in the room at New
York, she first said that he was something like, then that he was very like,
and then that he was the man, and she has no doubt now that he is the man. It
is for you to consider whether that sequence can be fairly founded on as
weakening her evidence, or whether it has not the opposite effect, as
indicating caution and discrimination &mdash; he is something like him; he is
very like him; he is the very man! At the same time, you will not forget&mdash;
what Mr. M'Clure strongly founded on &mdash; that she bases her opinion on what
she calls the twist in the nose. Call it a twist in the nose, or a broken nose,
or a peculiar nose, it is for you to judge whether the prisoner's face has not
such personal peculiarity as makes all the difference in a question of
identification by personal impression.</p>

  <p>In addition to these, there are Mrs. Liddell and the other witnesses,
eleven in all, who speak to a person haunting the part of the street opposite
the house. Four of these witnesses say that they are positive that the prisoner
is the man, viz., Mrs. M'Haffie, Police-Constable Walker, Euphemia Cunningham,
and Bryson. The other witnesses &mdash; Margaret M'Haffie, Madge M'Haffie,
Annie M'Haffie, Campbell, Nairn, and Gillies &mdash; say, generally &mdash; I
can give it in detail if you like &mdash; that he resembles the man, but they
will not swear it. Margaret M'Haffie says that she can identify him quite well,
but she adds that at one time she was not quite sure; Madge M'Haffie says she
is not quite sure; he is just like the man, but she cannot swear. Annie
M'Haffie says that she is not quite certain, but he is like the man. William
Campbell Bays that there is a general resemblance; he will not say more. Nairn
says that he is certain he was the man he saw, but he will not go the length of
being positive, which is an obvious contradiction in terms, although we may
understand what he means. Gillies says that he resembles the man, but he cannot
say that he is the same man. That leaves Mrs. Liddell, in regard to whom you
have a very distinct remembrance, I am sure, of the way she gave her evidence,
how she left the witness-box, got the prisoner to stand up, looked at him from
the side, as she saw the man who haunted the street, and then said
emphatically, "I believe the prisoner was the man standing at the railings."</p>

  <p>The questions for you are &mdash; and they are purely jury questions
&mdash; so far as identification is concerned, first, has the prisoner such a
marked personality, and had the witnesses Lambie, Adams, and Barrowman such an
opportunity to observe the man leaving Miss Gilchrist's house, and are they
sufficiently credible witnesses to enable you to hold it proved that the
prisoner is the same man? Second, has the prisoner such a marked personality,
and had the eleven or twelve witnesses above referred to such opportunities for
seeing the man who haunted the street, as to enable you to hold it proved that
the prisoner is the same man? I assume &mdash; but again it is for you to say
&mdash; that there can be no reasonable doubt as to the identity of the man
haunting the street and the murderer. Lastly, is there corroboration, in other
parts of the evidence, of the personal impression given you by these witnesses,
assuming that they are strangers, and assuming that there is no such marked
personality or personal peculiarity as would add weight to the mere personal
impression?</p>

  <p>Come, then, gentlemen, to the purely circumstantial evidence. You may
think the direct evidence sufficient, and in that case the circumstantial
evidence will only be of interest to you as confirming the view otherwise
reached. If you do not, that may be either because you throw the direct
evidence aside altogether and think, it of no value &mdash; which I do not
think you will do &mdash; or because you think it not sufficient in itself. If
you throw it aside altogether, there is in this case no such circumstantial
evidence as would entitle you, taking that evidence by itself, to convict the
prisoner. But if you are impressed by the direct evidence, although not
satisfied that it is sufficient by itself, you will then proceed to consider
anxiously the alleged circumstantial evidence. You have points both for and
against the prisoner. In his possession nothing was found belonging to Miss
Gilchrist. The police at first thought that the diamond brooch, which he had
pawned on the 21st, had been part of Miss Gilchrist's belongings, but that
turned out to be a mistake. In her premises nothing was found belonging to him.
As you know, robberies and murders have often been traced by the offender
having in his hurry left behind him a cap or other article belonging to him,
which had been proved to be his, and which has convicted him. Then nothing was
found in his possession on which you can rely as being connected necessarily
with the murder. You have heard about the coat, and you have heard about the
hammer. The doctors say that, while the stains on the coat and the marks on the
top part of the hammer were thought by them to be due to mammalian blood, there
was not enough material for them to apply confirmatory tests to show that the
stains and marks were produced by mammalian blood, or even blood at all. The
hammer in itself is a perfectly innocent weapon, but it is a weapon which might
have been used to do the deed. If my suggestion to you at the beginning is
correct, viz., that the person who went to get the jewels from Miss Gilchrist
never thought that murder would be necessary, he would have a hammer with him
not for a murderous purpose, but to break open any box in which Miss
Gilchrist's jewels might be kept. These are strong points in favour of the
prisoner, and you will give them due weight. Had the facts been the other way,
there might have been enough in any of these points to convict the prisoner,
taken along with the evidence of identification. If, the following day, he had
pawned some jewel of Miss Gilchrist's, you would have convicted him, or if his
cap had been found in her premises. There is nothing of that kind in the
case.</p>

  <p>Two points remain. What about his conduct after the murder? There is
material there for your serious consideration. The incidents may be
significant, although minute, such as the incident on the top of the tramway
car.</p>

  <p>Mr. M'Clure has put it to you that at 6.12 the prisoner is proved to have
calmly taken a telegram to the post office, and to have sent it off, and signed
it. Such conduct is said to be inconsistent with the idea of his then plotting
murder within less than an hour of the murder. You will consider whether there
is any evidence to support either of these suggestions. I have pointed out that
probably the man who went to get the jewels never thought of murder being
necessary. As to the telegram, there is no evidence that the prisoner sent off
a telegram at 6.12. A telegram signed "Oscar Slater" was sent off, but the
telegraph clerk cannot tell whether it was sent by a man or by a woman. Slater
may have sent the telegram or he may not, but we do know that he was, according
to the statement of his friends Aumann and Kattman, at Johnston's billiard
rooms some time about five or six. The suggestion is that their evidence is
inconsistent with his having committed the offence, because you cannot conceive
a man plotting murder being in a billiard room within half an hour of the
offence. If he was not plotting murder, but only plotting the getting of jewels
from an unresisting old lady, there does not seem to be much in that. But,
then, the second suggestion is that he had not time, after leaving the billiard
room, to be at the place of the murder by the hour it was undoubtedly
committed. You will consider whether, suppose he left at 6.30, and suppose he
walked out to West Princes Street, he had not plenty of time to be there, and
to see the servant girl leaving and to see that his opportunity had come. The
servant girl talks about being usually out seven minutes. We know quite well
how variable the time of her absence would be. He may have trusted to her being
a good deal longer than that on this occasion, as she had no doubt been before.
Suppose you are not to take Aumann 's evidence, which was that Slater was at
the billiard room about 5.30 to sell the pawn ticket for the brooch, and did
not stay long, suppose you prefer Rattman's statement that the prisoner left
somewhere about 6.30, you will consider whether the prisoner would have had any
difficulty in being at the scene of the murder by seven o'clock.</p>

  <p>As to what happened after seven o'clock, you will remember what was said
by Antoine &mdash; that poor, pathetic figure we saw yesterday &mdash; and by
the servant Schmalz. They do not speak definitely about that particular
occasion, but their evidence is that, during that week, Slater was always home
for dinner by about seven o'clock. You will judge whether, in a disreputable
house such as Slater's, we are, without evidence, to credit the statement that
hours were so punctual and so regular that the inmates always dined at seven
o'clock, or ten minutes afterwards. Schmalz admits that the dinner was
sometimes as late as 7.30 or eight, so that there is nothing in her evidence to
exclude the Crown's case that Slater left the billiard room at 6.30, committed
the murder, fled from the house empty-handed, being surprised by Adams and
Lambie, and was at home, say, by 7.30.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, the prisoner was not bound to prove that he was not the
murderer. He was quite entitled to say, "I defy you, the Crown, to prove that I
am the murderer." He was entitled to lead no evidence at all, and to rest his
defence on the inadequacy of the Crown's case. But he has chosen, in accordance
with the letter he wrote to Cameron, to bring evidence to show that at the time
of the murder he was engaged elsewhere, and could not have committed the
offence. You will judge whether or not he has done so satisfactorily to your
mind. Suppose he has not, that would not entitle you to convict him. It is not
for him to disprove the charge; it is for the Crown to prove it, and unless
they prove it to your mind satisfactorily, then he is entitled to your verdict.
As to the time immediately after the hour of the murder, you have heard how, at
9.45 that night, Slater went to the club and saw Gordon Henderson. Henderson
says that Slater seemed excited, but his excitement did not connect itself in
his mind with the commission of any crime. He thought he might have been losing
money at cards. That exhausts the evidence so far as relating to the night in
question.</p>

  <p>Mr. M'Clure spoke of his witnesses as a credible body of witnesses. You
have seen them. You know their occupation, you know how Antoine's fate is bound
up with the prisoner's in the past and will be in the future, you know what
kind of person the servant is, and in what employment she has been, and it is
for you to say whether such witnesses form a credible body of evidence or not.
But, even if you think they do not, still you have to come to a conclusion as
to whether the Crown have proved the case on their own evidence.</p>

  <p>With regard to the alleged flight from Glasgow, it is quite clear that
Slater intended, at some time or other, to go to America. It may be doubtful
what place he was going to in America, but I do not think it can be suggested
that he was not intending to go abroad. It is for you to say whether, in the
circumstances detailed to you, there was a hastening of that intention, which
is suggestive, if it does not prove, that he had a new and very serious motive
of expediting his going abroad. The realisation of the money, and the attempt
to sell the pawn ticket, were all before the murder. The limit of &pound;10 was
given to Cameron, and afterwards, apparently, the prisoner was willing to take
any money &mdash; he was willing to take &pound;4 &mdash; but you will judge
whether that was sufficient to show that there was, as the Lord Advocate called
it, a flight from Glasgow, which could only be consistent with his desire to
escape from the consequences of a crime of a serious nature. It is quite
certain he was not back in the clubs after the 21st, and, although he was in
Johnston's billiard rooms on the 23rd for the first time he did not play. Then
you have got the incident connected with his being, or alleged to have been, on
the top of the tramway car. The weight and effect of all that is eminently
matter not for me to enlarge upon or discuss, but for you, as men of the world,
to consider.</p>

  <p>That is the whole case. Mr. M'Clure has made some observations on the
Lord Advocate not having cross-examined Antoine. You will keep in view her
position, and the weight to be given to a witness with such tremendous motives
as she has for standing by the prisoner, and with the record that she has in
the past. But you will also remember that, if you read the evidence as I do,
her statements were not inconsistent with the Crown case. I noted that she did
not say that the tickets were taken for Liverpool. There is a question there,
which has not been cleared up, as to whether tickets were taken for London or
Liverpool. She, who must know, did not say, and was not asked to say, that the
tickets were not taken for London, but for Liverpool. If she had said that, and
had not been cross-examined on it, the defence might have made a point which is
not open to them.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, the case is entirely in your hands. If the whole matter is in
the region of speculation or suspicion, then you cannot convict. Mr. M'Clure
said that, if you had a doubt on the matter, you could not convict. One knows
what he meant by that &mdash; he meant reasonable doubt, and the distinction is
an important one. There is nothing almost in human affairs that does not admit
of speculative doubt. Many eminent persons have doubted whether we really
existed. A brilliantly satirical treatise was written to show that the great
Napoleon never existed, but we do not look upon these as reasonable doubts. If
you have a reasonable doubt on the matter, you will acquit in one form of
verdict or another. It is a serious thing that a brutal offence of this kind,
on an unoffending old lady, in a crowded part of a town alleged to be
civilised, in an age alleged to be civilised, should go undiscovered and
unpunished, but it is a much more serious thing to convict any prisoner on
insufficient evidence.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen, I suppose you all think that the prisoner possibly is the
murderer; you may very likely all think that he probably is the murderer. That,
however, will not entitle you to convict him. The Crown have undertaken to
prove, not that he is possibly or probably the murderer, but that he is the
murderer. That is the question you have to consider. If you think there is no
reasonable doubt about it, you will do your duty and convict him; if you think
there is, you will acquit him.</p>

  <h2><a id="verd" name="verd">VERDICT AND SENTENCE</a></h2>

  <p>The jury retired to consider their verdict at five minutes to five
o'clock, and returned in an hour and ten minutes.</p>

  <p>CLERK OF COURT &mdash; What is your verdict, gentlemen?</p>

  <p>FOREMAN OF THE JURY &mdash; The jury, by a majority, find the prisoner
guilty as libelled.</p>

  <p>THE PRISONER &mdash; My lord, may I say one word? Will you allow me to
speak?</p>

  <p>LORD GUTHRIE &mdash; Sit down just now.</p>

  <p>THE CLERK &mdash; Then this is your verdict, "The jury, by a majority,
find the panel guilty of murder as libelled"?</p>

  <p>THE FOREMAN &mdash; Yes.</p>

  <p>Mr. MORISON &mdash; I move for sentence.</p>

  <p>While the verdict and sentence were being recorded.</p>

  <p>THE PRISONER &mdash; My lord, my father and mother are poor old people. I
came on my own account to this country, I came over to defend my right. I know
nothing about the affair. You are convicting an innocent man.</p>

  <p>LORD GUTHRIE (to Mr. M'Clure) &mdash; I think you ought to advise the
prisoner to reserve anything he has got to say for the Crown authorities. If he
insists on it, I shall not prevent him now &mdash; will you see what he
says?</p>

  <p>THE PRISONER &mdash; My lord, what shall I say? I came over from America,
knowing nothing of the affair, to Scotland to get a fair judgment. I know
nothing about the affair, absolutely nothing. I never heard the name. I know
nothing about the affair. I do not know how I could be connected with the
affair. I know nothing about it. I came from America on my own account. I can
say no more.</p>

  <p>Assuming the black cap, Lord Guthrie then pronounced sentence of death in
the usual form, adjudging the panel to be executed in Glasgow prison on
Thursday, 27th May.</p>

  <p>Lord Guthrie thanked the jury for their attendance at that long and
complicated trial, and said they would be excused from jury service during the
next three years.</p>

  <p class="cp">The prisoner was then removed, and the Court rose.</p>

  <h3>LETTER, Accused to Hugh Cameron, Glasgow, addressed from Tombs Prison,
New York, dated 2nd February, 1909.</h3>

  <p class="quote">New York,<br>
  Centre Street,<br>
  Tombs, 2/2/1909.</p>

  <p class="quote">Dear Friend Cameron, &mdash; To-day it is nearly five weeks
I am kept here in prison for the Glasgow murder.</p>

  <p class="quote">I am very down-hearted my dear Cameron to know that my
friends in Glasgow like Gordon Henderson can tell such liars about me to the
Glasgow police.</p>

  <p class="quote">I have seen here his statements he made in Glasgow telling
the police that a German came up to him and had told him Oscar Slater had
committed the murder, and also that I have been on the night of the murder in
his place asking him for mony, I was very excited and in hurry, I didn't think
it was very clever from him, because he like to make himself a good name by the
police to tell such liars.</p>

  <p class="quote">I don't deney I have been in his place asking him for mony
because I went brocke in the Sloper Club. Only I will fix Mr. Gordon Henderson
I will prove with plenty of witnesses that I was playing there mucky, and I am
entitled to ask a proprietor from a gambling house when I am broke for mony.</p>

  <p class="quote">He would not mind to get me hangt and I will try to prove
that from a gambling point, I am right to ask for some money. I hope nobody
propper mindet will blame me for this.</p>

  <p class="quote">The dirty caracter was trying to make the police believe I
done the murder, was excitet, asking for mony to hop off.</p>

  <p class="quote">I think you know different remember when have been in the
Cunard Line office trying to change for a &pound;5:0:0 note, we have been in
three or four differend place after found some change in the Grosvenor have
posted with you on Hope Street office a registered letter.</p>

  <p class="quote">I shall go back to Glasgow with my free will, because you
know so good than myselfs that I am not the murder.</p>

  <p class="quote">I hope my dear Cameron that you will still be my friend in
my troubel and tell the truth and stand on my side. You know the best reason I
have left Glasgow because I have shown to you the letter from St Francisco from
my friend, also I have left you my address from St Francisco.</p>

  <p class="quote">I reely was surprised I don't have seen your statement
because I think you was too strait forvard for them. They only have taken the
statement against me and not for me. Likely I will be in Scotland in fourteen
days and so quicke your hear that I am in prison in Glasgow send me the best
criminal lawyer up you get recomendet in Glasgow I stand on your dear
Cameron.</p>

  <p class="quote">Keep all this quiet because the police is trying hard to
make a frame up for me. I must have a good lawyer, and after I can proof my
innocents befor having a trial, because I will prove with five people where I
have been when the murder was committed.</p>

  <p class="quote">Thanking you at present, and I hope to have a true friend
on you, because every man is able to get put in such a affair and being
innocent. My best regards to you and all my friends. &mdash; I am, your

  <h4>UNTO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LORD PENTLAND,<br>
  HIS MAJESTY'S SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND</h4>

  <h3><big>MEMORIAL</big><br>
  <small>ON BEHALF OF</small><br>
  <big>OSCAR SLATER</big></h3>

  <p>THIS Memorial is humbly presented on behalf of Oscar Slater presently a
Prisoner in the Prison of Glasgow, who was, in the High Court of Justiciary at
Edinburgh, on Thursday, the sixth day of May, Nineteen hundred and nine, found
guilty of the charge of murdering Miss Marion Gilchrist in her house in West
Princes Street, Glasgow, and sentenced to death. The Prisoner is a Jew, and was
born in Germany. He is 37 years of age.</p>

  <p>The Jury returned a verdict of "Guilty" by a majority of nine to six, and
the legal advisers of the condemned man hold a very strong opinion that the
verdict of the majority of the Jury was not in accordance with the evidence
led, and that this evidence was quite insufficient to identify the Prisoner
with the murderer, and so to establish the Prisoner's guilt. This view, they
believe, is shared by the general public of all classes in Scotland, and by the
Glasgow press (<i>vide</i> leading article in The Glasgow Herald of 7th May,
1909, sent herewith).</p>

  <p>Your Memorialist has endeavoured in this paper to deal with the matter as
briefly and with as little argument as possible; but in view of the fact that
the trial of the Prisoner occupied four days, it is inevitable that the
Memorial should extend to some length.</p>

  <p>It is common ground that the late Miss Gilchrist, a lady of about 82
years of age, resided alone with her domestic servant, Nellie Lambie, a girl of
about 21 years of age.</p>

  <p>According to the evidence of Lambie, the latter left Miss Gilchrist alone
in the house at seven o'clock on the evening of 21st December, 1908, and went
to purchase an evening paper. Lambie deponed that she securely shut the house
door behind her, and also the door at the close, or street entry; that she was
only absent about ten minutes; that on returning about ten minutes past seven
o'clock she found the close door open; that upon ascending the stair she found
Mr. Adams, a gentleman who resides in the flat below, standing at Miss
Gilchrist's house door; that Adams informed her that he had gone up to Miss
Gilchrist's door because he had heard knocking on the floor of Miss Gilchrist's
house, and had rung the bell, but that he could obtain no admittance; that the
lobby was lighted by one gas jet turned half up, but giving a good light; that
Lambie thereupon opened the house door with her keys; that upon the door being
opened a man came through the lobby or hall of Miss Gilchrist's house, passed
Lambie and Adams, went downstairs, and disappeared; and that, upon Lambie and
Adams entering the house, they found Miss Gilchrist lying on the dining-room
floor dead, her head having been smashed.</p>

  <p>Upon the Wednesday following the murder (23rd December, 1908), the
Glasgow Police were informed by a message girl named Mary Barrowman (about 15
years of age), that she had seen a man wearing a Donegal hat and a light coat
running out of the close which leads from the street to Miss Gilchrist's house
shortly after seven o'clock on the night of the murder; that the man passed
her, running at top speed; that she noticed that he was dark, and clean shaven,
and that his nose was twisted towards the right side. The servant Lambie had
also informed the Police that a gold crescent brooch, set in diamonds, had
disappeared from Miss Gilchrist's house on the night of the murder, and that
this was all of Miss Gilchrist's property that she missed. These statements
were published in the Glasgow newspapers on Friday, 25th December, 1908, and
following upon this the witness Allan Maclean, a member of a club to which
Slater belonged, informed the Police that Slater's appearance somewhat
corresponded with the description advertised, and that he had been trying to
sell a pawn ticket for a diamond brooch. Following up this clue, the Police
went to Slater's house at 69, St. George's Road, Glasgow, on the night of
Friday, 25th December, and learned that he and Miss Andr&eacute;e Antoine, with
whom he had been cohabiting, had left Glasgow that night with their belongings.
The Police thereafter ascertained that Slater had sailed on the "Lusitania "
for New York from Liverpool on Saturday, 26th December, and cabled to the
Authorities at New York to detain and search him on his arrival. This was done,
and the pawn ticket, which he had been trying to sell, was found upon him, but
turned out to be a pawn ticket for a brooch which belonged to Miss Antoine, had
never belonged to Miss Gilchrist, and had been pawned a considerable time
before the murder. Proceedings, however, were instituted for Slater's
extradition. The witnesses Lambie, Adams, and Barrowman gave evidence in
America, purporting to identify him as the man seen leaving Miss Gilchrist's
house, and Slater was (he states of his own consent) extradited, and brought
back to Scotland for trial.</p>

  <p>An advertisement was published by the Authorities in Glasgow offering a
reward of &pound;200 for information which would lead to the arrest of the
murderer.</p>

  <p>The only evidence against Slater, which might be called direct evidence,
was the evidence of the persons who saw a man walk out of the lobby or hall in
Miss Gilchrist's house on the night of the murder (Lambie and Adams), or
leaving the close leading therefrom, or running along the street
(Barrowman).</p>

  <p>At the trials Lambie professed to identify Slater, as the man whom she
had seen leaving the house, by the side of his face. It was put to her,
however, and clearly proved, that when she gave evidence in New York in the
extradition proceedings she stated in Court there that she did not see the
man's face, and professed to identify him by his walk. When Slater's own coat,
the one found in his luggage, was shown to her at the trial, she at once
remarked, even before it was unrolled, that it was not like the coat the man in
the lobby wore&mdash;it was the coat. It was obviously impossible that she knew
it to be the same coat. Lord Guthrie referred to this in his charge to the jury
as a typical example of the nature of her evidence. With regard to the positive
nature of her evidence generally, it is interesting to note that her first
answer in America, when asked if she saw the man, was, "One is very suspicious,
if anything." She stated that, when she saw Slater in the Central Police Office
at Glasgow, she recognised him in his "own coat." It was proved that he was not
then wearing his own coat, but one with which he had been dressed for
identification purposes.</p>

  <p>The witness only saw the man who was leaving the house for a moment or
two. Adams and she contradicted each other as to where she was when the man
walked across the lobby. Adams deponed that she was by the lobby clock and
walking towards the kitchen. If so, she must practically have had her back to
the man. She says she was on the threshold of the door. In any event, her view
was momentary.</p>

  <p>The witness Adams, who deponed that he had a better view of the man in
the house than Lambie, stated at the trial that he, standing at the threshold,
saw the man's face as he approached, that their eyes met, and that the man
walked slowly towards him, face to face, but Adams would not go further than to
say that Slater resembled the man very much. He is superior to Lambie and
Barrowman in years, education and intelligence. Your Memorialist begs to
emphasise the fact that this witness had a much better view of the man than any
of the other witnesses.</p>

  <p>The witness Barrowman stated at the trial that the man ran out of the
close and rushed past her at top speed, brushing against her, and that he had
his hat pulled well down over his forehead. The witness is a message girl,
about 15 years of age. She also stated that the man had on brown boots, a
Donegal hat, and a fawn coat, and that he was dark and clean shaven, and that
his nose had a twist to the right. She professed to have noticed all these
things as he rushed past her at top speed. At the trial this witness stated in
cross-examination (i) that she was proceeding in the opposite direction from
the man, to deliver a parcel, but that she turned and went some distance after
him; that she thought he was probably going to catch a tramcar; but she could
not explain why she should go out of her way to turn and follow a man running
for a car in a busy city like Glasgow; and (2) that, although the girl Lambie
and she had occupied the same cabin on the voyage to America, which lasted
about twelve days, she had not once discussed the appearance of the man, and
that no one had warned her not to do so. These two statements do not impress
your Memorialist as bearing the stamp of truth. This girl started the
description of the twisted nose. She is the only witness who refers to it. Her
view of the man's face must necessarily have been momentary. Slater's nose
cannot properly be described as "twisted to the right." It has a noticeable
prominence in the centre.</p>

  <p>All of these three witnesses had, as has been said, only a momentary view
of the man, and it was proved that before Barrowman professed to identify
Slater in New York she was shown his photograph, and that both she and Lambie,
before attempting to identify him in New York, saw him being brought into Court
by a Court official, wearing a badge. In her New York evidence she first said,
"He is something like the man I saw." At the trial she stated that he was the
man. These facts very much reduce, if they do not altogether vitiate, the value
of the evidence of these identifying witnesses.</p>

  <p>Another witness, Mrs. Liddell, who is a married sister of the witness
Adams, stated that, at five minutes to seven on the evening of the murder, she
saw a dark, clean-shaven man leaning against a railing at the street entry to
Miss Gilchrist's house, but that this man wore a heavy brown tweed coat and a
brown cap. It is to be observed that Constable Neil, who passed the house at
ten minutes to seven, saw no one there; and Lambie, who left the house promptly
at seven, or, as she said in America, "perhaps a few minutes before seven," saw
no one there. Further, Mrs. Liddell did not observe where the man went to;
according to her he merely glided away; and although she was in Miss
Gilchrist's house that night and saw the body, and would naturally be greatly
concerned over the murder, she did not recollect having seen this man until the
Wednesday after the murder. Even taking her evidence as absolutely true and
reliable, it provides an excellent object-lesson on the difficulty and
responsibility of convicting on such evidence as this, because the man she saw
was obviously dressed differently from the man seen by the other three
witnesses. Her evidence does not, to any appreciable extent, further the case
against Slater, as she stated that she thought this man was Slater, but
admitted that she might be in error.</p>

  <p>The other witness is a girl named Annie Armour, a ticket clerk in the
Subway Station at Kelvinbridge, who says that between 7.30 and 8 that evening a
man, whom she identified as Slater, rushed past her office without waiting for
a ticket, and seemed excited. Lord Guthrie in his charge to the jury did not
refer to this witness, and your Memorialist thinks advisedly. The mere question
of time is sufficient to render her evidence valueless. She is sure the
incident did not happen before 7.30. According to the other witnesses, the
murderer must have run from the house by at least 7.15. It was proved that it
would only take a man five or six minutes to run from the scene of the tragedy
to this station, either by the most direct route or by the route which
Barrowman's evidence suggests he took. Then it is impossible to suppose that
she could get anything like a good view, even of the side face, of a man who
rushed past her in the way she described.</p>

  <p>All the witnesses who saw the man on the night of the murder (Monday) say
that he was clean shaven. It was proved that on the next day or two after the
murder Slater had a short, black, stubbly moustache.</p>

  <p>These were the only witnesses called by the Crown to identify Slater with
the murderer. Further circumstantial evidence, however, was led by the Crown to
show that, on occasions before the day of the murder. Slater had been seen
standing in or walking up and down West Princes Street&mdash;Mrs. M'Haffie, her
daughters and niece, Campbell, Cunningham, Bryson, Nairn, and O'Brien and
Walker (two policemen). It may be noted that Slater's house was situated about
three minutes' walk from West Princes Street.</p>

  <p>These witnesses did not all agree in their evidence. Some said that
Slater was the man they had seen; others, equally or perhaps better able to
judge, only said that he was very like him. The Memorialist does not propose in
this paper to deal at length with this part of the evidence, except to point
out that two witnesses (Nairn and Bryson) say they saw Slater in West Princes
Street on the Sunday evening previous to the murder. Against this there is the
evidence that Slater on this day, as usual, spent all Sunday (day and evening)
in his house. Three witnesses from Paris, London, and Dublin spoke to this.
Coming from different places, they had no chance to concoct a story.</p>

  <p>At Slater's trial it was suggested that there were various circumstances
tending to create an atmosphere of suspicion around him; but it is submitted
that all these were capable of explanation, and in no way pointing to Slater's
guilt as a murderer. Slater had written to Cameron that he could prove where he
was on the evening of the murder "by five people." When this letter was
written, he thought that the date of the murder was the Tuesday, the 22nd.</p>

  <p>The evidence of his witnesses was to the effect that on the evening of
the murder he was in a billiard room until 6.30 p. m., after which he went home
for dinner.</p>

  <p>It was shown that Slater dealt in diamonds. There was, however, no
evidence of any dishonest dealing of any kind. The brooch said to have been
missing from Miss Gilchrist's house has not been traced. There was no evidence
of any kind led to show that Slater ever knew, or even heard of, Miss Gilchrist
or her house, and the Memorialist would emphasise the fact that it was the
missing brooch that put the Police on the track of Slater.</p>

  <p>With reference to Slater's departure for America on 25th December, igo8,
it was proved that he had formed the intention, some weeks before the murder,
of going to America. Cameron, Rattman, and Aumann proved this. Slater had, in
fact, tried to get the last named to take over his flat. The letter from
Jacobs, of 28th December, and the card bearing the words "address till 30th
December," produced by the Crown, also corroborate the evidence of this
intention of leaving, which is further corroborated by the evidence of Nichols,
the barber, a Crown witness.</p>

  <p>On the morning of 21st December, 1908, Slater received two letters
&mdash;one from London, stating that his wife was demanding his address, and
the other from San Francisco, asking him to come over. These were spoken to by
Schmalz, his servant girl, and Miss Antoine. Further corroboration of his
intention to leave is (i) on the morning of 21st December he raised a further
&pound;30 from Mr. Liddell, pawnbroker, on his brooch, and on the same day
tried to sell the ticket; (2) he wrote to the Post Office for payment of the
money at his credit; (3) he wired to Dent, London, to send on his watch, which
was being repaired, immediately; (4) on the Monday morning he gave notice to
the servant girl that she would not be required after the following Saturday
(these events all happened before the murder); (5) on the Tuesday morning he
redeemed a pair of binoculars from another pawnbroker whose assistant, Kempton,
proved this, and who stated that he was in no way excited; (6) on the 23rd and
24th December he made inquiries at Cook's Shipping Offices regarding berths,
and betrayed no signs of any excitement; on the 23rd he was, in the evening, in
Johnston's billiard room, which he used to frequent; and on the 24th he spent
the afternoon about Glasgow with his friend Cameron, who gave evidence; (7) on
Friday morning a Mrs. Freedman and her sister arrived from London to take over
his flat, so that he and Miss Antoine left on Friday night.</p>

  <p>A rumour got abroad at the time to the effect that he booked to London
and left the train at Liverpool. This rumour was published in the various
newspapers, to Slater's great prejudice, but nothing of the kind was proved at
the trial. The Police were evidently misled by the fact that he went by a
London train, but it was proved that there were two carriages in that train for
Liverpool, and also that Slater's luggage, consisting of nine boxes, was
labelled to Liverpool. The Porter who labelled the luggage was called, and
stated that Slater told him that he was going to Liverpool, and entered a
Liverpool carriage.</p>

  <p>The point was also raised against Slater that he used various aliases. He
had been staying apart from his wife for about four years, during which time he
cohabited with Miss Antoine. She stated that Slater's wife was a drunken woman,
and caused him a deal of trouble. At one time he adopted the name of "George,"
and when he came to Glasgow on the last occasion he took the name of
"Anderson." On the voyage to America he took the name of Otto Sando, because
his luggage was labelled O. S. At times he called himself a dentist. There was
no evidence that he really was a dentist. Miss Antoine explained that he
adopted the title of dentist, as he required a designation of some sort,
although he was a gambler. A great deal was published in the newspapers about a
hammer that had been found in one of his boxes. This turned out to be an
ordinary small domestic nail hammer, purchased on a card containing several
other tools, the lot costing only 2s. 6d. He, of course, took the hammer to
America with him with all the rest of his belongings.</p>

  <p>Nothing incriminating was found in any of his boxes.</p>

  <p>No evidence whatever was led to show how the murderer gained access to
the house.</p>

  <p>It will be conceded that identification evidence, especially in a serious
charge of this kind, must be examined very carefully, and should have little
weight attached to it, unless it is very clear.</p>

  <p>To sum up, the only real evidence in the case is that of those who saw a
man running away on the night of the murder; and, as has been pointed out,
these witnesses had only a momentary glance at him. Adams does not positively
identify the prisoner as the man. He says he closely resembles him.</p>

  <p>Lambie's New York evidence has already been referred to, and her evidence
at the trial cannot be reconciled with it.</p>

  <p>Lambie and Barrowman both saw him in custody before trying to identify
him in New York, and the latter, before identifying him, was shown his
photograph.</p>

  <p>All the other identifying witnesses called to give evidence as to his
having been seen in the vicinity on days previous to the murder were taken down
to the General Police Office when Slater returned from America to identify him.
They were shown into one room together, and then separately taken into a room
in the Police Office, where Slater was amongst about a dozen men, none of whom
were like him. (Cunningham says she could see that the other men were policemen
in plain clothes.) All these witnesses knew that Slater had arrived from
America, and was in the room. They had all read his description in the
newspapers, or had seen his photograph. They all, therefore, looked for, and
had no difficulty in pointing out, a dark, foreign-looking man, with a somewhat
peculiarly shaped nose. It is submitted that this is not identification
evidence in the proper sense at all. Had these people been able to pick out, as
their man, from amongst several others, a man whose description they only knew
from what they had previously seen of him, unassisted by description, and
unassisted by a photograph, the value of their evidence would have been
entirely different.</p>

  <p>Some Crown witnesses identified him as the man they had seen and talked
to (Shipping Clerk, Porter, &amp;c.), but they, of course, were able to do so.
None of the identifying witnesses had ever spoken to him.</p>

  <p>Identification evidence is a class of evidence which the law distrusts.
The most famous authority is the case of Adolf Beck. Beck was, in 1896,
sentenced to seven years' penal servitude, on the evidence of ten women, who
swore positively that he was a man whom they had each met on two occasions, and
spent some time with in their own houses, and who had defrauded them, and on
the evidence of two policemen, who swore positively that Beck was the man who
had been previously convicted of similar crimes, taken along with certain
circumstantial evidence&mdash;that he was known to frequent a hotel on the
notepaper of which one of the women had received a letter. Again, in 1904, Beck
was convicted of similar crimes on similar evidence. It was subsequently
demonstrated that Beck committed none of the crimes, but that a man bearing a
general similarity to him was the criminal.</p>

  <p>In the report issued by the Commission appointed to investigate the
matter, consisting of Lord Collins, Sir Spencer Walpole, and Sir John Edge, the
following passage occurs:&mdash;"Evidence of identity, upon personal
impression, however bona fide, is of all classes of evidence the least to be
relied upon, and, unless supported by other evidence, an unsafe basis for the
verdict of a Jury."</p>

  <p>Now, the evidence in the Beck case was infinitely more overwhelming and
consistent than in this case; and the report in the Beck case, and the report
on which it followed, make it clear that on the evidence in this case the Jury
had no right to bring in a verdict of "Guilty."</p>

  <p>A good deal was said by the learned Lord-Advocate to the Jury about
Slater's immoral character. It was not disputed that he was a gambler. It was
also admitted that he had cohabited for about four years with Madame Antoine,
who was of doubtful virtue, and who gave evidence. Yet the learned Lord
Advocate addressed the Jury to the effect that the prisoner "had followed a
life which descended to the very depth of human degradation, for, by the
universal judgment of mankind, the man who lived upon the proceeds of
prostitution has sunk to the lowest depth, and all moral sense in him had been
destroyed." This he cited as proof of the disappearance of an obstacle which
had previously been in his way, viz:&mdash;Whether it was conceivable that such
a man as Slater could commit such an inhumanly brutal crime. The only evidence
on that point was that of Cameron, Slater's friend, who, in cross-examination,
said he had heard that Slater lived on the earnings of prostitution, but who
did not say he knew. The Jury were distinctly told by the Lord Advocate, and by
the prisoner's Counsel, and by the Judge, to banish from their minds anything
they had heard regarding the man's character; but they had previously heard all
about it, and the Memorialist feels strongly that they were evidently unable to
do so.</p>

  <p>Public feeling is also very strong on the point that the question of
Slater's character should never have been brought before the Jury.</p>

  <p>The Memorialist thinks it is only fair to prisoner to point out that he
was all along anxious to give evidence on his own behalf. He was advised by his
Counsel not to do so, but not from any knowledge of guilt. He had undergone the
strain of a four days' trial. He speaks rather broken English&mdash;although
quite intelligibly&mdash;with a foreign accent, and he had been in custody
since January.</p>

  <p>Apart from what has been set forth above, your Memorialist begs to draw
attention to the fact that on the Crown list of witnesses is the name of a
witness, Miss Agnes Brown (No. 46). This lady is 30 years of age, and a very
intelligent school teacher. Your Memorialist is informed that she told the
Police and Procurator-Fiscal that on the night of the murder, about ten minutes
past seven o'clock, two men in company rushed along West Princes Street from
the direction of Miss Gilchrist's house, and passed close to her at the corner
of West Princes Street and West Cumberland Street; that one of them was dressed
in a blue Melton coat with a dark velvet collar, black boots, and without a
hat; that both men ran past the opening of West Cumberland Street, straight on
along West Princes Street, crossed West Princes Street, and ran down Rupert
Street, a street further west, and opening off the opposite side of West
Princes Street. Your Memorialist understands that, in the identification
proceedings before referred to, this witness pointed out Slater as the man in
the Melton coat, as she thought. This witness's evidence is thus in sharp
contradiction on material points to that of the message girl Barrowman (who had
only a momentary glance at the man), but upon whose evidence so much weight has
evidently been laid, and who says that Slater was dressed in a light coat, a
Donegal hat, and brown boots, was alone, and ran down West Cumberland
Street.</p>

  <p>Your Memorialist respectfully submits that this illustrates the danger of
convicting a man upon the kind of evidence given in this case. Miss Brown was
in attendance at the trial, but was not called as a witness. Even on the
evidence led, the votes of two more jurymen in his favour would have liberated
the prisoner. In England the probability is that a conviction would never have
been obtained.</p>

  <p>Your Memorialist is authorised to state that Slater's Counsel agree that
the evidence did not justify the conviction.</p>

  <p>Your Memorialist, who has all along acted as Slater's Solicitor since he
was brought back from America after the Extradition Proceedings, and who has
had very many interviews with Slater, begs respectfully to state his absolute
belief in Slater's innocence.</p>

  <p>May it therefore please the Right Honourable the Secretary of State for
Scotland to take this Memorial into his most favourable consideration, and
thereafter to advise his Most Gracious Majesty to exercise his royal
prerogative to the effect of commuting the sentence passed upon the prisoner,
or to do otherwise as in the circumstances may seem just. And your Memorialist
will ever pray.</p>

  <h3>DEPOSITION OF AGNES BROWN</h3>

  <p class="cp"><small>At Glasgow, the thirty-first day of December, One
thousand nine hundred and eight years.<br>
  In presence of Arthur Thomson Glegg, Esq., advocate, Sheriff-Substitute of
Lanarkshire,<br>
  Compeared Agnes Brown, who, being solemnly sworn and
examined,declares&mdash;</small></p>

  <p class="quote">I am thirty years of age, a school teacher, and reside at
48 Grant Street, Glasgow.</p>

  <p class="quote">On Monday, 21st December, 1908, about 7.8 p.m., I left the
house there to attend evening classes in Dunard Street School. I went west
along Grant Street to West Cumberland Street, and turned north along the east
side of that street till I came to West Princes Street. I was in the act of
stepping off the foot-pavement there to cross West Princes Street at an angle
towards Carrington Street (a north-westerly direction) when two men came
rushing past me from the direction of George's Road. They were on foot pavement
(south foot pavement of West Princes Street). They were going very quickly, and
the one nearest me came against me in passing; he merely touched me. He never
spoke, however, and both continued running west along West Princes Street. They
kept on the foot pavement for a little distance, and then they crossed to the
centre of the street.</p>

  <p class="quote">I stood for a moment at the corner of Carrington Street to
see where they went, and they turned down Rupert Street towards Great Western
Road. I then passed down Carrington Street to Great Western Road, but I saw no
more of them. In crossing that road I saw the time on a clock in a chemist's
shop &mdash; that it was then 7.12.</p>

  <p class="quote">I returned home from my classes shortly after ten o'clock
and then learnt of Miss Gilchrist's murder from my two sisters.</p>

  <p class="quote">I did not at the time associate the two men with the
murder, but next morning, after reading a description in the <i>Glasgow
Herald</i> of a man who was said to have left deceased's house, I thought he
might be one of the two men referred to.</p>

  <p class="quote">I did not see the face of either man, but, so far as I
could make out. they were each about thirty years of age, and about 5 feet 9
inches in height. The one next me was of medium build, with dark hair, and
seemed to be clean shaven. He wore a three-quarter length grey-coloured
overcoat &mdash; I think tweed &mdash; dark trousers, probably brown, dark
tweed cap without flaps, and had both hands in his coat pockets as he ran away.
I took no notice of his boots.</p>

  <p class="quote">The man furthest from me was of medium build, but seemed to
be squarer than the other man. He had very dark hair, probably jet black, well
groomed and glossy, and was bareheaded.</p>

  <p class="quote">He wore a navy blue overcoat with velvet collar, dark
trousers, and black boots.</p>

  <p class="quote">He had also a stand-up white collar, which seemed very
clean, and carried something in his left hand, the one furthest from me.</p>

  <p class="quote">I could not say what this was. It might have been a walking-
stick, but I thought it looked clumsier than a walking-stick. _</p>

  <p class="quote">I know the house which was occupied by Miss Gilchrist.</p>

  <p class="quote">It is about 200 yards east from the corner of West
Cumberland Street and Princes Street, where the two men ran past me.</p>

  <p class="quote">All which I declare to be truth.</p>

  <p class="quote">AGNES BROWN.<br>
  A. T. GLEGG.</p>
  <hr class="shr">
  <br>

  <p>Re-examined, says &mdash;</p>

  <p class="quote">I adhere to the above statement as correct, and have to add
that on Sunday, 21st February, I saw in the Central Police Office prisoner,
Oscar Slater.</p>

  <p class="quote">He was then dressed in a grey Melton overcoat with velvet
collar, and was bareheaded.</p>

  <p class="quote">I recognised him as one of the two men I had seen running
away on the Monday night in question. He was bareheaded when I saw him running
away, and the man who was with him was wearing a dark, close-fitting cap.</p>

  <p class="quote">It is possible that Slater might be wearing another coat
under the Melton overcoat, as the latter is large enough to cover another
overcoat.</p>

  <p class="quote">I also recognised Slater by his profile. I did not get a
front view of his face, but I picked him out of a number of men, twelve to
fourteen, as I think, in the police office, and I have not the slightest doubt
about him.</p>

  <p class="quote">It was not only by his profile and back view but the shape
of his neck and ears and square shoulders.</p>

  <p class="quote">I did not see Slater with a cap or hat when he was running
away, but the man who was with him had a cap like the dark greenish cap shown
me.</p>

  <p class="quote">I think the second man resembles a man whom I had seen
repeatedly in Grant Street, always between seven and eight. That street runs
parallel with West Princes Street.</p>

  <p class="quote">I have seen Miss Gilchrist frequently at her back bedroom
window, and I have seen her lift the window. I cannot say that I saw her put
anything out. These occasions were when she seemed to be dressing.</p>

  <p class="quote">Also truth.</p>

  <h3>COPY of STATEMENTS submitted to the Secretary for Scotland, and of the
Evidence taken at the Inquiry held by the Sheriff of Lanarkshire, on the 23rd,
24th, and 25th April, 1914.</h3>

  <p>Scottish Office,<br>
  Whitehall,<br>
  8th April, 1914.</p>

  <p>Sir,&mdash;</p>

  <p>As you are aware, the Secretary for Scotland has recently received
through Mr. David Cook, Writer, Glasgow, certain information bearing upon the
case of Oscar Slater, who was convicted of murder in the High Court, Edinburgh,
on 6th ]May, 1909, and sentenced to death, which sentence was afterwards
commuted to penal servitude for life. The information in question is submitted
by Detective Lieutenant Trench, of the Glasgow Police Force, and is of such a
nature as in the Secretary for Scotland's opinion to call for full inquiry. Mr.
M'Kinnon Wood understands with satisfaction that you are prepared to conduct an
inquiry into these matters, and I am accordingly to transmit to you Mr.
Trench's 'statement and relative documents, and to intimate to you that the
Secretary for Scotland appoints you to inquire and report thereon for his
consideration.</p>

  <p>In the opinion of the Secretary for Scotland, as advised, the inquiry
should be Conducted in private, should be limited to questions of fact, and
should in no way relate to the conduct of the trial, a view in which he
understands you concur, but subject to these limitations it is his desire that
you should exercise your own discretion as to the conduct of the inquiry.</p>

  <p>I am to add that the expenses of the inquiry will be defrayed from the
Vote for Law Charges, &amp;c., in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Mr. M'Kinnon Wood will be glad to receive in due course your formal
acceptance of the appointment herein intimated, and should there be any matters
on which you desire further information or guidance he will be pleased to give
them his consideration.</p>

  <p>I am, &amp;c.,</p>

  <p>(Signed) John Lamb.<br>
  James G. Millar, Esq., K.C.,<br>
  Sheriff of Lanarkshire, Glasgow.</p>
  <hr>
  <br>

  <p>Sheriff's Chambers,<br>
  County Buildings, Glasgow,<br>
  27th April, 1914.</p>

  <p>Sir,&mdash;</p>

  <p>In terms of your letter of the 8th instant, I received instructions to
hold an inquiry into certain information bearing upon the case of Oscar Slater,
who was convicted of murder in the High Court, Edinburgh, on 6th May, 1909,
which was submitted to you by Detective Lieutenant Trench, of the Glasgow
Police Force, through Mr. David Cook, Writer, Glasgow. The inquiry was to be
conducted in private, limited to questions of fact, and should in no way relate
to the conduct of the trial.</p>

  <p>On receiving these instructions I communicated with Captain Stevenson,
Chief Constable of the Glasgow Police, and Mr. J. N. Hart, Procurator-Fiscal.
At interviews with these gentlemen they promised me every assistance.</p>

  <p>The method of the inquiry was as follows:&mdash; As it was an extra-
judicial one, the witnesses were not put on oath, but they were warned to tell
the truth.</p>

  <p>The only persons present were the witness, Mr. Andrew Sandilands, my
clerk, and myself. I put questions to the witnesses and dictated the purport of
the answers to Mr. Sandilands, who took it down in longhand. At the conclusion
of the statement it was read over to the witness and signed by him as being
true.</p>

  <p>With regard to the manner of those making statements, I think it is
enough to say that Miss Birrell and Miss Brown seemed to me to be very
intelligent, careful, and trustworthy witnesses. Mrs. Gillon, Miss Mary
Barrowman, and Mr. MacBrayne seemed to me to be honest and anxious to tell the
truth. I should further say that Miss Birrell, Mrs. Gillon, and certain of the
police witnesses exhibited signs of great surprise when Lieutenant Trench's
statements were read to them.</p>

  <p>With these explanations I beg humbly to report the statements made at the
inquiry for your consideration.</p>

  <p>I return Lieutenant Trench's precognition, with the accompanying papers
which you sent to me.</p>

  <p>I have, &amp;c.,</p>

  <p>(Signed) James G. Millar.</p>

  <p>The Right Hon. T. M'Kinnon Wood, M.P., Secretary for Scotland,<br>
  Scottish Office, Whitehall, London,</p>

  <p>Statement of Detective Lieutenant Trench Submitted to</p>

  <p>John Thomson Trench (45), Detective Lieutenant Glasgow Police Force,
Central Division, says:&mdash;</p>

  <p>I joined the Glasgow Police Force as constable in May, 1893. I have been
promoted from time to time. My last promotion was in November, 1912, when I
received my commission as Lieutenant of Police.</p>

  <p>The murder of Miss Gilchrist having taken place in the Western District,
the police of that Division were first on the scene with regard to
investigation. The matter being a grave one, the assistance of the Central
Division was necessary. I was one of the officers deputed to make certain
inquiries. Latterly the case was practically taken from the Western, and all
investigations, &amp;c., were made by officials of the Central Division. On the
night of the murder. Superintendent Ord and Lieutenant Gordon visited
Gilchrist's house. On their return to the Central, Gordon gave such information
as he had gleaned. I was one of the officers present. Keith was another. Along
with Keith I went to the door of the house. We did not enter. At this time the
only description of the wanted man which we had to go upon was the description
to be found in No. 1 of the Inventory herewith. (It will be noted that the
description is meagre indeed.)</p>

  <p>I am aware that on 22nd December, the day after the murder.
Superintendent Douglas, along with Detectives Pyper and Dornan, drove in a taxi-
cab to the house of A.B.* I am also aware that they did so in view of the
information supplied by Nellie Lambie. I have endeavoured from time to time to
elicit what took place in A.B.'s house, but I am without information.</p>

  <p class="footnote">*The letters A.B. are substituted for the name
throughout. Certain passages in the statement relating to A.B. have been
omitted, and these omissions are marked by asterisks.</p>

  <p>On 23rd December I was instructed by Chief Superintendent Orr to visit
and take a statement from Miss Birrell, 19 Blythswood Drive. I had particular
instructions to question her with regard to A.B. and as to what Lambie said
when she visited her house on the night of the murder. I visited Miss Birrell,
and from her received the statement word for word as contained in her
precognition No. 2 of the Inventory. On receiving the statement I returned to
the Central Police Office. I told Superintendent Orr and Superintendent Ord
what Miss Birrell had said. Chief Superintendent Orr seemed impressed with the
statement, and remarked "This is the first real clue we have got." I was
instructed to write out the statement. I did so. In handing that statement to
Superintendent Ord, he said, "I have been ringing up Douglas (that is.
Superintendent Douglas, of the Western), and he is convinced that A.B. had
nothing to do with it."</p>

  <p>Up to this point there had been no mention of a man with a peculiarly
twisted nose, and no mention of a Donegal hat.</p>

  <p>On Thursday, 4th December, the girl Barrowman came into the case. At that
time she was living at 9 Seamore Street. At the same address there resided
Detective M'Gimpsey of the Northern Division, now Lieutenant M'Gimpsey of the
Central Division.</p>

  <p>Reference is here made to No. 3 of the Inventory. For the first time a
man with a nose slightly turned to the right comes into the case, but it will
be noticed that the word "Donegal," somewhat glibly used by Lambie and
Barrowman at the trial, has not come into any of the descriptions. I will deal
with how the word "Donegal" came into the case.</p>

  <p>A comparison of Lambie's description with Barrowman's description is
significant.</p>

  <p>A reference to No. 3 of the Inventory shows that the police evidently
believed that the man whom Barrowman had seen was not the same man as had left
the house when Lambie entered. In point of fact, the police first believed that
there were two men connected with the crime. Latterly the two men became one
&mdash; Oscar Slater. I particularly draw attention to page 299 of the book of
the trial, and to the portion underlined.*</p>

  <p class="footnote">* This and subsequent similar reference.s are to the
first edition of the present Report.&mdash; Ed.</p>

  <p>On 25th December a man named Allan M'Lean, who was a witness at the
trial, called at the Central Police Station and made the statement, a copy of
which is No. 4 of Inventory. But for M'Lean's call. Slater's name would in my
view never have been connected with the tragedy. The pawn ticket referred to in
the statement was proved on inquiry to relate to a brooch which at no time was
the property of Miss Gilchrist. The brooch was in pawn on the day of the
murder. I wish particularly to draw attention to the fact that following
M'Lean's call the machinery was put in motion to find Slater in order to clear
up the matter of the brooch. Of course every possible suggestion that might
lead to a result was followed up.</p>

  <p>Detective Inspector Powell was sent with Allan M'Lean to search for
Slater, and it militated against Slater that Powell did not there and then
interview him. M'Lean only knew Slater as "Oscar," and Powell was despatched to
make inquiries with regard to a Mr. Oscar. In point of fact, had Powell been
bold enough to have knocked at Slater's door, he would have seen Slater, and
the matter could have been cleared up, at least so far as the brooch was
concerned. I refer to No. 5 of Inventory &mdash; Powell's statement. He was not
examined as a witness. In this connection I also refer to the evidence of the
porters, John Cameron and John Mackay, No. 13 of Inventory. It will be seen
that they were engaged on the 25th of December by Slater between the hours of
six and seven o'clock. In other words, Slater made arrangements for his
departure before M'Lean had been at the Central Police Office and before Powell
had made such inquiries as he did.</p>

  <p>Until 2 p.m. on Saturday, 26th December, no reference from any witness
can be had relating to a man with a Donegal hat. The Donegal hat came info the
case not from Barrowman, Adams, or Lambie, or from any other Crown witness,
unless M'Lean mentioned that Slater was in the habit of wearing a Donegal hat.
Further, by this time there was every opportunity to find out what manner of
clothing and what particular manner of head covering Slater was in the habit of
wearing. It is only too significant that the two vital witnesses, Lambie and
Barrowman, had given their statements describing a man with a head covering
entirely different to a Donegal hat. I refer to No. 6 of Inventory issued on
Saturday, 26th December, from which it will be seen that by this date a fairly
accurate description of Slater had been procured somewhere and somehow.</p>

  <p>When it was learned by the police that Slater had fled, or rather
believed by them that he had done so, it was assumed that he had gone to
London. The only authority for such an assumption is to be found in the
statement of Lieutenant Gordon, who had interviewed Slater's maid. Comparing
the statement referred to with Gordon's evidence at the trial (page 176),
underlined, discloses that Gordon materially altered the statement made to him
by the maid. This point is of vital importance. Detective Anderson was on
Saturday morning, 26th December, instructed to make inquiries at the various
railway stations. Reference is made to his statement, No. 7 of Inventory. It
will be seen that Anderson obtained information that two railway tickets to
London for the 9.5 p.m. train on Friday night had been issued to a man 31 to 32
years of age, 5 feet 4 or 5 inches in height, dark hair and complexion, light
dark moustache. This description was supplied by the witness Brown, the booking
clerk who issued the tickets. No inquiry was made regarding Liverpool by the
police. It will be noticed that the police did not direct their attention to
passengers who might have booked for Liverpool.</p>

  <p>It is now well known that on the night when Slater and his woman left
Glasgow there was a through carriage to Liverpool attached to the 9.5 p.m.
train. This was Christmas night, hence the unusual practice. I also know that
when Slater's agent was making inquiries regarding the through carriage, he was
told repeatedly by various officials in the Central Station that it was
rubbish, there was no through carriage. In that connection it must be noted
that Slater all along persisted that he travelled in a through carriage.
Latterly an official was found who did remember that there was a through
carriage on Christmas night. It is of the utmost importance to have regard to
the fact that only two tickets were issued at the Central Station for Liverpool
for the 9.5 train; that only two persons left the train at Liverpool (Slater
and his woman). I refer to No. 8 of the Inventory, being telegram from Chief of
Police, Liverpool, to Chief of Police, Glasgow; No. 9 of Inventory, telegram
from Chief of Police, Liverpool, to Chief of Police, Glasgow; No. 10 of
Inventory, being statements of Detective Chief Inspector Duckworth and
Detective Sub-Inspector Bell, of the Liverpool City Police.</p>

  <p>It is beyond doubt that if Slater and his woman travelled to Liverpool
with London tickets, four people must have left the train at Liverpool &mdash;
the persons who travelled to Liverpool with Liverpool tickets, and Slater and
his woman, who are said to have travelled with London tickets. It is self-
evident that only two persons travelled to Liverpool. These were Slater and his
woman.</p>

  <p>On arriving at Liverpool, Slater and his woman proceeded to the North
Western Hotel. Reference is here made again to the telegram and statements,
which disclose that Slater made no secret of who he was, where he was going,
and where he had come from. Max Rattman produced at the trial a letter dated
26th December, 1908. The letter will be found on page 301 of the book. It will
be noted that, with the exception of the letter to Rattman, all the other
evidence was suppressed or at least not brought forward. Emphasis was laid by
the prosecution on the fact that on the steamer Slater had changed his name to
Otto Sando. It is worthy of comment that if he was changing his name with a
purpose, he would not have used a name anything like Oscar. In fact, his
baggage had the initials O.S. \Mien the baggage arrived at the Central Police
Station each package bore labels, "Lime Street, Liverpool." I read the labels.
There seems nothing peculiar in Slater changing his name on the steamer. He was
known in Glasgow as Anderson, and in Edinburgh as Smitz. My experience as a
detective warrants me in saying that men who, like Slater, live on their wits
not infrequently change their names.</p>

  <p>The result of my inquiries convince me that, so far from Slater
absconding from justice, his departure for Liverpool to catch the "Lusitania"
was as open as daylight. Slater's maid furnished Gordon with an address in
London where she was going to reside. The Glasgow Police communicated with the
London Police asking that inquiry should be made of the maid in the hope that a
more definite statement as to where Slater had gone would be forthcoming. On
28th December a telegram was received that the maid had stated that Slater and
his woman had gone to Liverpool and were travelling to America. The maid, it
may be mentioned, is anything but a fluent English speaker. It was in this way
that the Glasgow Police directed inquiry at Liverpool.</p>

  <p>I refer to No. 11 of Inventory &mdash; statements by Mary Cooper and
Catherine Fitzpatrick. These persons were not examined at the trial. They wore
not even on the Crown List. Every one who has seen Slater is impressed with his
distinct foreign appearance. I draw attention to the fact that no witness
adduced at the trial who had seen the supposed murderer spoke of him as of
foreign appearance. Cooper speaks of him as a German Jew.</p>

  <p>On 3rd January, 1909, along with Detective Keith, I visited Nellie Lambie
at 15 South Kinning Place, at the house of her aunt. She was lodging there. I
had with me a sketch of Oscar Slater which I had received from Superintendent
Ord. I showed the sketch to Lambie. She could not identify. She said she did
not know him. The sketch was a fair representation of Slater, and had evidently
been drawn by some one who knew him. Although I had not spoken to Lambie, I was
aware, having taken Miss Birrell's statement, that she had declared that A.B.
was the man. I touched on A.B., asking her if she really thought he was the man
she saw. Her answer was, "It's gey funny if it wasn't him I saw."...My
conclusion after meeting Lambie was that if she had had any one to support her
she would have sworn to A.B. So much impressed was I that I mentioned the fact
to Superintendent Ord next morning, asking if he thought that A.B. might not be
the man. His only answer was, "Douglas has cleared up all that, what can we
do?"</p>

  <p>Compare Lambie's evidence, page 64 of the book (underlined), with the
statement which she made on the night of the murder and which she persisted in
on the 3rd of January. Her evidence cannot be characterised as a mistake. There
is another word for it. Lambie knew A.B. as a visitor to the house. Her
identification of him is more valuable because of that fact. If A.B. was the
man whom Lambie saw leaving the house as she entered, the whole mystery {as yet
unexplained) of how the murderer obtained access to the house is cleared up.</p>

  <p>I am forced to the conclusion that Mary Barrowman was not at or near Miss
Gilchrist's close at the time the murderer rushed therefrom. I have had from
her employer and from his sister an emphatic statement. No. 15 of Inventory,
that Barrowman did not deliver a message on the night of the 21st at Howitt's
house. In the original statement supplied by Barrowman to the police. No. 12 of
Inventory, she makes no mention of having been at a Band of Hope meeting. In
the statement I find as follows, viz.: &mdash; "Shortly after 7 p.m. on Monday,
21st December, 1908, I was on my way from the shop with a message to Cleveland
Street, and was passing along West Princes Street, and when near close No. 47
(where Mr. Adams resides) I saw a man running out of the close No. 49, and he
looked towards St. George's Road and immediately turned westwards. I wondered
what was wrong, and turned round and watched him, following him a few yards,
and saw that he turned into West Cumberland Street, running all the time.</p>

  <p>"I went and delivered my message and returned to the shop by Woodland
Road, and after leaving our shop at 8 p.m. I went to my brother's shop at 480
St. Vincent Street, and while going there I again passed along West Princes
Street, and saw a crowd opposite No. 49, and learned of the murder, and I then
thought of the man I had seen running out of the close there. He was a man
about 28 or 30 years of age, tall and slim build, no hair on face, long
features, nose slightly turned to the right, dressed in a fawn overcoat like
waterproof, dark trousers, brown boots, and tweed cloth hat of respectable
appearance.</p>

  <p>"I did not see any other person near the close or about, but I think I
could recognise the man again, although I could not say that I ever saw him
before."</p>

  <p>I refer to Barrowman's evidence, pages 108 to 115 of the book, in
particular the passages underlined. If one would put themselves to the trouble
of comparing the statements, it cannot be doubted but that Barrowman either
lied in Tier original statement or lied at the trial.</p>

  <p>There is no reference in her original statement to any Band of Hope
meeting, nor is there any reference to a man knocking up against her. The
statement with regard to the knocking up against her is either of her own
invention or must have been put into her mouth.</p>

  <p>I have drawn in red ink on the plan at the end of the book the route
which Barrowman swore she followed from her employer's shop at Barrington Drive
to Howitt's house at Cleveland Street. A glance will suffice to let one
understand that she chose a most roundabout and circuitous means of arriving at
her destination. I have gone over the ground and, as near as may be, Barrowman
added somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes to her journey. In short, if she had
chosen the natural route she would not have been in West Princes Street at all,
unless to cross the street, but not at a point near to Gilchrist's house.</p>

  <p>Couple the circuitous route which undoubtedly Barrowman says she followed
with the fact that she neither saw Adams, Lambie, Miss Adams nor Mrs. Liddell,
the four people who rushed out hot haste upon the heels of the murderer. None
of them saw Barrowman, notwithstanding the fact that you will find in her
evidence that she was there for such a length of time as to enable her to
follow the man for a certain distance, turn again, passing !Miss Gilchrist's
close.</p>

  <p>Instead of finding anything or any one to corroborate Barrowman that she
was at or near the close when the murderer left the close, everything goes to
prove that her story of having seen the man was a cock-and-bull story of a
young girl who was somewhat late in getting home and who wished to take the
edge off by a little sensationalism.</p>

  <p>Slater on arriving in Glasgow had with him nine packages: a number of
these were trunks, and had not been opened. They were sealed by the American
police. I was present when the packages were opened. Every package and trunk
was carefully and systematically packed. A very considerable amount of time
must have been spent in the packing. The linen and fine underwear were folded
with camphor interposing between the layers. In no sense did the trunks reveal
a hurried departure.</p>

  <p>From a trunk I lifted the hammer upon which the Crown built their theory
of the commission of the crime. Alongside of the hammer were other tools which
go to make up the card bought by Slater. The hammer weighed one-half pound. I
saw nothing on the shaft to indicate to me that it had been either scraped or
cleaned. For what it may be worth I look upon the hammer as a most unlikely
instrument to have caused the injuries. Like Dr. Adams, who was not used as a
witness although the first medical man on the scene, I lean to the view that
Miss Gilchrist was done to death by a chair.</p>

Statement.</h3>

  <h3>No. (1).</h3>

  <p>9.40 p.m. An old lady was murdered in her house at 15 Queen's Terrace
between 7 and 7.10 p.m. to-day by a man from 25 to 30, 5 feet 7 or 8, thinks
clean shaven. Wore a long grey overcoat and dark cap.</p>

  <p>Robbery appears to have been the object of the murderer, as a number of
boxes in a bedroom were opened and left lying on the floor. A large-sized
crescent-shaped gold brooch, set with diamonds, large diamonds in centre,
graduating towards the points, is missing and may be in possession of the
murderer. The diamonds are set in silver. No trace of the murderer has been
got. Constables will please warn booking clerks at railway stations, as the
murderer will have bloodstains on his clothing. Also warn Pawns on opening
regarding brooch and keep a sharp look-out.</p>

  <p>Margaret Birrell, late of 19 Blythswood Drive, now residing at 6
Kelvinside Terrace, or 275 Wilton Street, Glasgow:&mdash;</p>

  <p>I am niece of the late Marion Gilchrist, who resided at 15 Queen's
Terrace, West Princes Street. My mother was a sister of the deceased. Miss
Gilchrist was not on good terms with her relations. Few, if any, visited her...I
can never forget the night of the murder. Miss Gilchrist's servant, Nellie
Lambie, came to my door about 7.15. She was excited. She pulled the bell
violently. On the door being opened she rushed into the house and exclaimed,
"Oh, Miss Birrell, Miss Birrell, Miss Gilchrist has been murdered, she is lying
dead in the dining-room, and oh, Miss Birrell, I saw the man who did it." I
replied, "My God, Nellie, this is awful. Who was it, do you know him?" Nellie
replied, "Oh, Miss Birrell, I think it was A.B. I am sure that it was "A.B." I
said to her, "My God, Nellie, don't say that...Unless you are very sure of
it, Nellie, don't say that." She again repeated to me that she was sure it was
A.B. The same evening Detectives Pyper and Dornan visited me, and I learned
from them that she had told them that it was A.B. I told a number of my friends
about it, including a member of the Glasgow Corporation, who communicated with
Chief Superintendent Orr. On Wednesday afternoon, 23rd December, 1908,
Detective Trench visited me, and I told him exactly what Lambie had told me.</p>

  <h3>No. (3).</h3>

  <p class="cp">Thursday, 24th December, 1908, 7 p.m.</p>

  <p>Description of a man who was seen to leave the close leading to Miss
Gilchrist's house at 15 Queen's Terrace, West Princes Street, shortly after 7
p.m. on 21st instant (the night of the murder), and run westwards and turn into
West Cumberland Street.</p>

  <p>A man 28 to 30 years, tall and thin, no hair on face, nose slightly
turned to one side (thinks right), dressed in fawn-coloured overcoat (thinks
waterproof), dark trousers, tweed cloth hat, latest make, and thinks of dark
colour, brown boots.</p>

  <p>This man may have some connection with the murder but he should not be
confounded with the man seen to leave the house by the servant and Mr. Adams.
If any of your officers or constables should recognise this man from
description, send immediate information to Detective Department.</p>

  <h3>Remark by Detective Trench:</h3>

  <p>Note. &mdash; The above was circulated throughout the country from the
description supplied by Mary Barrowman. It will be noted that it is slightly
different from her description, viz., "long features" is omitted and never
appears again. Instead of "nose slightly turned to right," it now reads "nose
slightly turned "to one side, thinks right." Instead of "fawn overcoat" it now
reads "fawn-coloured overcoat," &amp;c., &amp;c. The footnote clearly shows
that, even allowing that Barrowman saw the man at the time and place stated, he
was not thought to be the same man seen by Lambie and Adams.</p>

Police.</p>

  <p class="cp">Murder of Marion Gilchrist.</p>

  <p>Allan M'Lean, a cycle dealer of 100 Agnes Street, Maryhill, says: &mdash;
I am a member of the Sloper Club, 24 India Street. During the past few weeks a
man named Oscar Slater, a German Jew about 30 years of age, 5 feet 8 inches in
height, clean shaven, nose slightly twisted to one side, has been frequenting
the club and has latterly become a member of it. I noticed that after the
murder of Miss Gilchrist on 21st instant he did not return to the club, and on
hearing that he had been offering a pawn ticket for a valuable diamond brooch
for sale which was alleged to have been pledged for &pound;50 on the day of the
murder, I, on Friday, 25th instant, went to the Detective Department, Central
Police Office, and reported the matter. I didn't know the number of the close
or the street where Slater resided, but I stated that I would be able to point
them out.</p>

  <p>Between 7 and 8 o'clock the same night I accompanied Detective Inspector
Powell to 69 St. George's Road and pointed out that close as the one where
Slater was residing under the name of Anderson. I know that when Slat&laquo;r
was proposed as a member of the club that he gave his address as 136 Renfrew
Street, though he had not left there for some time. I afterwards heard that
Slater had left Glasgow a short time after I had pointed out the close where he
lived to Inspector Powell.</p>

  <h3>No. (5).</h3>

  <p>William Powell, Detective Inspector, Central Police Office, says &mdash;
I was instructed by Superintendent Ord to accompany the witness M'Lean on
Friday, 25th December, and he would point out a close where a man Slater was
residing. I accompanied him, and he pointed out 69, St. George's Road. He then
left me. I went into the close and called at a Miss Bernstein's house, as I
knew her well. I spoke to Miss Bernstein in her house and also to her maid, and
the latter told me that she had seen a man answering the description of the man
I gave them coming down from Anderson's house on the top flat. I returned to
the Detective Department and reported to Superintendent Ord, who arranged for
me to go to Slater's house at night in company with the night officers. About
11.30 p.m. Detectives Lyon and Millican came to my house, and I accompanied
them to 69 St. George's Road. We went upstairs and knocked at the door of
Anderson's house and asked to be admitted. After some time we gained
admittance. I asked the servant where Oscar was, but she did not seem to
understand what I said. I then asked her where the man of the house was, and
she said "No man live here." I then asked where Madame was, and the servant
replied, "Madame away for night." I asked her who was with her, and she (the
servant) replied, "A gentleman." We closed the door of the house and commenced
a search of same. We did not find any men's clothing in the house, but a
wrapper for some small parcel bearing Slater's name on it. I asked the servant,
showing her the wrapper, if she knew whom that was for, and she replied, "A
friend of Madame's," and added that they were away together. We then went
downstairs, and I made inquiries at White's house on the second flat. The
servant there informed me that shortly after 8 o'clock that night luggage had
been carried downstairs from Fowlis' house and from Anderson's house (both on
top flat), and that Mrs. Bernstein's maid had seen the man Slater cross the
road and join a woman, who was supposed to be "Madame," and go down the street
together. I then sent Lyon and Millican to the Sloper Club in India Street, and
they returned in about three-quarters of an hour and informed me that Slater
had been introduced into the Sloper Club by a man named Cameron, who resided in
Cambridge Street, and that Slater's address had been given as 136 Renfrew
Street, c/o M'Donald. We proceeded to Mrs. M'Donald's house, but she informed
us that she had no lodger residing there. We then proceeded to Cambridge
Street, where we located Cameron, who informed me that he had called at
Slater's house at 69 St. George's Road about 8.10 p.m. on Friday, 25th
December, 1908, and was informed by the servant that a gentleman had called and
taken him away. I then questioned Cameron about the pawn ticket for a brooch
and he told me that he had no pawn ticket, but that Slater had given him a pawn
ticket two or three days ago for a brooch that had been pledged in Liddell's
pawn office to sell for him. He had been unable to sell it and had returned it
to him.</p>

  <p class="cp">Criminal Investigation Department, 7th January, 1909.</p>

  <p>Mary Cooper (30), 19 Windsor Street, Glasgow, states&mdash;</p>

  <p>I am shopwoman in the receiving shop of William Gardner &amp; Company,
Ltd., 26 St. George's Road, Glasgow (Holm Laundry, Paisley).</p>

  <p>On 12th November, 1908, a man who gave his name and address, A. Anderson,
69 St. George's Road, opened an account with me, and on that date we received
from him per our message girl, laundry work for which we charged 12s. 6d.,
which was paid on the goods being delivered. On 18th November, 1908, we
received work value 5s. 8d., on 26th November, 1908, work value 5s. 8d., on 9th
December, 1908, work value 6s. 8d., and on 17th December, 1908, work value 5s.
Od., which last item has not been paid.</p>

  <p>In the last lot of laundry goods we received from the Anderson's house
was six very fine men's shirts, which Anderson asked me to have sent him in a
box. They were the best shirts I ever saw. These goods were delivered at his
house by next witness on Saturday afternoon, 19th December, 1908, and on
Monday, 2l8t December, 1908 (the date of the murder of Miss Gilchrist), between
3 and 4 p.m., Anderson called at the shop and said there was a shirt short in
the laundry goods, that the shirt cost 16s. 6d., and as he was going out of
town he must have the shirt. He was very haughty and abrupt in his manner, and
I informed him that I would communicate at once with the laundry at Paisley
regarding his shirt, and he left the shop.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards Mr. Anderson's servant called at the shop with the
same complaint, and she said Mr. Anderson was going to London and must have his
shirt. The same evening the missing shirt arrived from Paisley, and I
immediately sent the message girl up to Anderson's house with the shirt and our
account for 5s. 0d. She returned and told me she was to call the following day
(Tuesday, 22nd December, 1908) for the money and washing, which she did, and
was then informed by the servant that they would have no laundry goods till
after the holidays. As they were fairly good customers, I did not insist on
payment of the 5s. 0d. at the time.</p>

  <p>Anderson was very particular about the dressing of his shirts, and
mentioned several times that they cost him 16s. 6d. each in London, that he
could not get them dressed as well in Glasgow as he could in London, and would
not grudge an extra penny to have them well dressed.</p>

  <p>Anderson appeared to me to be a German Jew, and had a crooked or twisted
nose and was clean shaven. He was always well dressed and of a dominant manner.
I could identify him again,</p>

  <p>Shortly after 7 p.m. on Monday, 21st December, 1908, I was on my way from
the shop with a message to Cleveland Street, and was passing along West Princes
Street, and when near close No. 47 (where Mr. Adams lives), I saw a man running
out of the close No. 49, and he looked towards St. George's Road and
immediately turned westwards. I wondered what was wrong, and turned round and
watched him, following a few yards, and saw that he turned into West Cumberland
Street, running all the time.</p>

  <p>I went and delivered my message and returned to the shop by Woodlands
Road, and after leaving our shop at 8 p.m. I went to my brother's shop at 480
St. Vincent Street, and while going there I again passed along West Princes
Street and saw a crowd opposite No. 49 and learned of the murder, and I then
thought of the man I had seen running out of the close there. He was a man
about 28 or 30 years of age, tall and slim build, no hair on face, long
features, nose slightly turned to the right, dressed in a fawn overcoat like
waterproof, dark trousers, brown boots, and tweed cloth hat of respectable
appearance.</p>

could recognise the man again, although I could not say that I ever saw him

man whom he thinks he could recognise again, engaged him at Central Railway
Station to remove luggage from Anderson's house at 69 St. George's Road to the
Central Station for the 9.5 p.m. train going south.</p>

  <p>I went to the above address at 8.15 p.m. There was two women and a man in
the house. I received ten pieces of luggage not addressed. I conveyed these on
a barrow to the Central Railway Station. I was not long there when the
gentleman and one of the ladies whom I had seen at the house joined me and
asked me to label the luggage: I think Liverpool.</p>

  <p>One of the railway porters whose name I do not know assisted me to put
the luggage into the luggage van attached to the 9.5 p.m. train going to

passed two foreign-looking ladies on the stair.</p>

  <p>I interrogated the servant, a German girl, who gave her name as Catherine
Smaltz. She told me that Anderson or Slater and Madame Junio had left the house
the previous evening (Friday), 25th December, 1908, and she did not know where
they were going to first &mdash; she thought London. While I was in the house,
one of the foreign women returned to the house. I interrogated her and asked
her what she was doing in the house and where and who the lady was who was with
her. This woman said her name was "Hoppie," then said, "Do you want her?" I
said, "Yes." She then ran downstairs and soon returned with the other woman,
who gave the name of "Freedman," and said that Mrs. Anderson was her step-
sister.</p>

  <p>She said she and her friend had arrived from London two days ago and had
been living in the Alexandra Hotel, where her sister had visited her. It had
been arranged that she and her companion would take possession of Anderson's
house, and that she and Anderson was going to Monte Carlo for three weeks. I
asked if Anderson had given any address for them in Monte Carlo, and she
replied "No," but she was promised a postcard from them, and if I called back
on Monday she would be able to furnish me with the address. I received from
Smaltz Anderson's address, viz., 36 Albemarle Street, Piccadilly, and that she,
Smaltz, lived at 72 Charlotte Street, c/o Anstro.</p>

  <p>I called on Monday, 28th December, 1908, in company of Detective
Inspector Pyper, of the Western District. Freedman then told me that she had
not got a postcard, but that a man had called after our visit and said to the
servant that the detectives were after Anderson in reference to a brooch that
had been pledged by him and supposed to have been stolen from a woman who had
been murdered. I asked who the man was, and she could not tell me. I then
pressed her for further particulars regarding Anderson. She told me that when
she had called at the house, Anderson asked her to lend him something, as he
didn't think he had quite sufficient money, and she gave him &pound;25, and he
told her she had the whole house as security except the &pound;4 to some man
she could not name. I asked her if she knew Anderson under any other name, and
she informed me that Anderson's name was Oscar Slater, that she knew nothing
further about him, and that she had met him in London. She said she saw the
brooch referred to in possession of her step-sister in London. She said she
herself had considerable business in Germany, but had not lived with her
husband for two years.</p>

  <p class="cp">Colin Maccallum (38), 1 Kennedy Drive, Partick.</p>

  <p>In December, 1908, I carried on business as a boot. and shoe-maker under
the name of N. Maccallum &amp; Son. The firm's address was 333 Great Western
Road. The shop is at the corner of Barrington Drive and Great Western Road. My
sister, Mary D. Maccallum, assisted me in the shop. Mary Barrowman, who gave
evidence in the Slater case, was our message girl. I had a customer named Howat
who in December, 1908, resided at 36 Cleveland Street.</p>

  <p>Barrowman had been despatched on several occasions with messages to
Howitt's house, such as the taking home of repairs, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>I remember that some days after the murder of Miss Gilchrist, Barrowman's
name was publicly mentioned as an important witness. I saw from the daily paper
that the girl was figuring as having seen a man leave Miss Gilchrist's close. I
also noticed her statement that she was delivering a pair of boots at Howat's
house on the night of the murder. To the best of my knowledge my sister drew my
attention to Barrowman's statement as appearing in the papers, and to the fact
that Barrowman had not been sent to Howat's house on the night of the murder. I
was and am still convinced that she was not sent that message on the night of
the murder, but several nights before. To the best of my belief, she delivered
the message on Friday, 18th December. I consulted with my sister about the
matter at the time. We spoke to Barrowman on the subject. She insisted that she
went the message on the night of the murder.</p>

  <p>Some time after Barrowman appeared in the case I drew the attention of
Detective Inspector Pyper, of the Western District, to the fact. I showed him
my books in support of what I said. Mr. Pyper told us not to say anything about
it, as it would upset the whole case, and he might get into trouble about it.
He impressed upon me not to mention it to any one, as the girl had insisted
that she had gone the message on the night of the murder. I am sure she did not
go that message on the night of the murder, and the books bore me out.</p>

  <p>I was not called to give evidence at the trial, neither was I
precognosced by Slater's agent.</p>

  <p>I have often spoken on the subject to my sister. I obeyed Detective
Pyper's instructions until I had a visit from Mr. Trench. I told him the
truth.</p>

  <p>My books were in existence up to May, 1913, but were destroyed when we
removed from Napiershall Street to my present address. I destroyed them.</p>

  <p>Statements taken from Witnesses at the Inquiry held by the Sheriff of
Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p class="cp">Glasgow, 23rd April, 1914.</p>

  <p>Compeared John Thomson Trench (45), Detective Lieutenant, Glasgow Police
Force, Central Division, who states &mdash; I joined the Glasgow Police Force
in May, 1893, as constable, and have been promoted from time to time, and
received my commission as Lieutenant of Police in November, 1912. My first
information as to the murder of Miss Gilchrist was on the evening of 21st
December, 1908. A description of it was given by Superintendent Ord and
Lieutenant Gordon, who had visited the scene of the murder. There was a
description given to us, which is the description No. 1 referred to in my
precognition. The first direct piece of business I had with the inquiry was on
Wednesday, 23rd December, 1908, when I was requested by Chief Superintendent
Orr to go to 19 Blythswood Drive to see a lady. Miss Birrell, who could give
information. I was particularly requested to make inquiry as to a statement
which it was said Helen Lambie had made on the night of the murder. I went to
Miss Birrell's house and saw her, and obtained a statement from her, and
afterwards, when I returned to the Central Police Office, I reduced it to
writing and handed it to Superintendent Ord. I have never seen that statement
since. The statement No. 2 of the Appendix to my precognition is my
recollection of what Miss Birrell said, and was drawn up by me in Mr. Cook's
office in the month of February this year. I state positively that Miss Birrell
said to me that Helen Lambie on the night of the murder told her that the man
she saw leaving the house was A.B. Notwithstanding I am told that both Miss
Birrell and Helen Lambie emphatically deny the whole story and express
astonishment at it, I adhere to my statement that that was what Miss Birrell
told me. I told Superintendent Ord what Miss Birrell had said in presence of
Superintendent Orr, and Superintendent Orr remarked, "This is the first real
clue we have got." I was instructed to write out the statement, and did so.
When I handed the statement to Superintendent Orr he said, "I have been ringing
up Douglas" (that is, Superintendent Douglas, of the Western) "and he is
convinced that A.B. had nothing to do with it." I was put specially on the
murder case on the 27th of December (Tuesday), as shown by my diary, as the
case was taken over by the Central Division. Detective Cameron and I went along
to Blythswood Drive on 9th January, 1909, by instructions of Superintendent
Ord. I went to number 19 to warn Miss Birrell, and Cameron went to number 23 to
warn another family of Birrells not to say anything about the story of A.B., as
it would do him no good and there was nothing in it. On the 3rd of January,
along with Detective Keith, I visited Helen Lambie, taking with me a sketch of
Oscar Slater which I had received from Superintendent Ord as an excuse for
visiting her. In the course of the talk we had I brought the subject round to
A.B., and asked her if she really thought he was the man she saw, and her
answer was: "It's gey funny if it was not him I saw." I was so much impressed
with her statement that I mentioned the fact to Superintendent Ord next
morning, asking if A.B. might not be the man, and his reply was: "Douglas has
cleared all that up, and what can we do?" Detective Keith was present during
the whole time and must have heard what Helen Lambie said. I have not spoken to
him on the matter since. If Helen Lambie positively denies all this, I still
adhere to my statement. I have never seen A.B. I did not make any statement
previous to the trial, either to the Fiscal or the Agent for the defence, as to
what I now say Miss Birrell and Helen Lambie had said to me. I said nothing at
all after Slater was condemned to death until he was reprieved, and even then
not for a considerable period, when I mentioned it to Mr. Shaughnessy, the
agent for Oscar Slater. I did not think much of the incident by itself, and it
was only when I discovered other facts that I brought this one up. On the 2nd
of January, 1909, I searched Oscar Slater's house after he had left, and found
no matches similar to the box of "Runaway" matches which were said to have been
discovered in the bedroom in Miss Gilchrist's house subsequent to the murder. I
made inquiry at grocers and found that "Runaway" matches are sold in bulk and
not in single boxes.</p>

  <p>This statement was read over to the witness, and was signed by him as
being true.</p>

  <p class="cp">Glasgow, 23rd April, 1914.</p>

  <p>Compeared Margaret Dawson Birrell (49), residing at 61 Rupert Street,
Glasgow, who states &mdash; I was not called as a witness at the trial of Oscar
Slater. At the time of Miss Gilchrist's death I resided at 19 Blythswood Drive,
Glasgow. I was in the habit of visiting Miss Gilchrist very seldom. She was not
on friendly terms with her relations, on account of an estrangement as to money
affairs. I visited her the Saturday previous to her death. She was 83 years of
age and quite intelligent, and quite able to look after her affairs. She was
active and able to go about by herself. At my visit on Saturday she was
praising Helen Lambie for keeping the house clean and tidy. She never remarked
about Helen Lambie's visitors, except that she once remarked about Helen Lambie
having a sweetheart, a collier. As far as she said anything to me, she seemed
perfectly satisfied with Helen Lambie...On the night of the murder, after
seven o'clock, Helen Lambie came to my door and rang the bell violently. The
maid opened the door, and Nellie Lambie rushed in and screamed out that
something dreadful had happened to Miss Gilchrist. She said that she had gone
out to get a newspaper, and when she returned she found Mr. Adams at the door.
He told her that his sister had heard a noise in Miss Gilchrist's house, and
that Helen Lambie had said to him that she thought it might be the pulleys in
the kitchen falling. She opened the door of the house and entered, and then she
saw a man slip past her and Mr. Adams. She went into the kitchen and saw that
there was nothing wrong with the pulleys, and afterwards went into the dining-
room and saw Miss Gilchrist lying there on the floor as if she had been knocked
down and seriously injured, and then she came along for me at once. I at once
sent Helen Lambie back to the house, and followed. At that time there was a
gentleman who occupied apartments in my house, named Mr. Charles Cowan. He
afterwards left, but returned recently to occupy rooms in my house, and is
there now. He heard all that Helen Lambie said, and after she left he
accompanied me at once to Miss Gilchrist's house. When I arrived I heard that
she was dead. I saw the body lying in the dining-room, but, on the advice of
those present, I did not examine it, as the sight was unpleasant. I was
directed to go into the bedroom, and there I saw a few small articles of
jewellery, of no great value, lying on the dressing table, ranged, as it seemed
to me, for the purpose of being speedily picked up after the search was made. I
remained in the house a considerable time. I had some talk with Helen Lambie
with regard to the arrangements, but as far as I can remember she said nothing
further about the man whom she had seen leaving the house. Mr. Cowan
accompanied me home, and thereafter returned and took Helen Lambie to the South
Side to a house where she was staying that night. Helen Lambie did not say to
me that she knew the man. She did not mention to me the name of A.B. when she
came along to the house after the murder. At no time did she ever say to me
that she thought the man who left the house was A.B. I remember two police
officers called on me, I think the day after the murder, and I made a statement
to them then. I cannot say when I saw Detective Lieutenant Trench, but I know I
saw him. The statement in No. 2 of the Inventory attached to Detective Trench's
precognition has been read over to me. It purports to be a statement made by me
to Detective Lieutenant Trench on 23rd December, 190Q. I now solemnly declare
that I never made such a statement, and all that is contained in it is
absolutely false. I did make a statement to Mr. Hart. I cannot remember what
was in it, but I am quite certain that I made no statement to him as to Helen
Lambie saying to me that the man who left the house was A.B. I never heard of
it being said that I had made such a statement until a few days ago, and it
took me completely by surprise.</p>

  <p>Compeared Charles Frederick Cowan (36), residing at 61 Rupert Street,
Glasgow, who states &mdash; I lived in apartments in Miss Birrell's house at 19
Blythswood Drive in December, 1908. I was in the house when Helen Lambie came
along and informed Miss Birrell of Miss Gilchrist's murder. I was shaving at
the time when Helen Lambie came. I heard a violent ring of the bell, followed
by another, and then I heard Helen Lambie say that her mistress had been
murdered. That is what she said, to the best of my knowledge. Helen Lambie may
have made a statement to Miss Birrell that I did not hear, but I certainly did
not hear her say that A.B. was the man she met when she returned after the
murder to Miss Gilchrist's house. Miss Birrell never said to me that Helen
Lambie told her that A.B. was the man she saw. Helen Lambie was told to go back
to Miss Gilchrist's house, and Miss Birrell and I followed very shortly
afterwards. I saw A.B. at the house. It was finally arranged that Helen Lambie
should go home to her aunt's at South Kinning Place. I saw Miss Birrell home,
and afterwards accompanied Helen Lambie to her aunt's. During the evening I had
a long talk with Helen Lambie, and she never suggested to me, so far as I can
remember, that A.B. was the man she saw.</p>

  <p class="cp">Glasgow, 23rd April, 1914.</p>

  <p>Compeared Helen Lambie or Gillon (27), residing at 169 Shearer's Land,
Holytown, who states &mdash; I was over three years with Miss Gilchrist as a
maid-servant. Miss Gilchrist was an old lady, but quite intelligent and able
to look after her own affairs. On the day of Miss Gilchrist's death, about five
minutes to seven, she asked me to go for a newspaper, and after I got that I
was to go out for some messages, and she gave me a penny and a half-sovereign.
I went out, taking the penny and leaving the half-sovereign on the table. I had
the keys with me, but I can't say that Miss Gilchrist saw them in my hand. On
former occasions I have forgotten the keys and rung the bell, and Miss
Gilchrist opened the door for me and waited for me at the door. I never saw her
leave the door open and go into her room. On the 21st December I went out for
the paper, spoke to a constable on the way, with whom I was acquainted. I don't
think I was more than ten minutes away from the house. When I returned the
lower door was open, which I know was closed when I left, for I banged it. I
went up the stair, and on the way up I saw wet marks of footprints on it. I
found Mr. Adams standing at the upper door, and he told me that hi.s sisters
had heard strange noises in the house and had asked him to go up, and I said to
him that that was likely to be the pulleys in the kitchen falling. I opened the
door with the two keys. I am quite clear I did not enter the house and was
standing on the mat when I saw a man proceed from the direction of the spare
bedroom towards the door. He passed me and then passed Mr. Adams. He walked
quite calmly until he passed us &mdash; with his head down &mdash; and after he
passed us he walked swiftly down the stair, but not excitedly so as to raise my
suspicion. I did not know the man and never saw him before. <i>Q.</i> Why did
you not ask him what he was doing there? <i>A.</i> I never suspected there was
anything wrong. I did not see his face in the house, but I saw the side of it
as he was going down stairs. He was dressed in a fawn-coloured rainproof coat
and a dark cap. I did not tell the police that night that he was wearing a long
grey overcoat and dark cap. It was like a Donegal cap. I think I mentioned the
Donegal cap that night. I went into the kitchen and saw nothing wrong with the
pulleys. I came out of the kitchen and went into the spare bedroom, where I saw
a light. I did not see Miss Gilchrist in the bedroom, so I went towards the
dining-room door and looked into the dining-room, with the handle of the door
in my hand. I did not see Miss Gilchrist at first, but I looked round the table
and I saw her lying on the floor with a fur rug on the top of her. I told Mr.
Adams that man had done something to Miss Gilchrist, and I ran down the stair,
along with Mr. Adams, and I saw Miss Adams then, and I afterwards saw a
constable and I told him about it, and after that I ran along to Miss Birrell's
house. I rang the bell, and my impression is that Miss Birrell opened the door.
I told Miss Birrell that I had been out for a paper and that a man had come
into the house and done something to ]Miss Gilchrist. I did not say to her who
the man was. She told me to go back to Miss Gilchrist's house and she would
follow immediately, and I did that. The statement in Appendix No. 2 to
Detective Inspector Trench's precognition being read over to Mrs. Gillon, she
states that there is absolutely not one word of truth in it. She never said to
Miss Birrell that it was A.B., and the whole story is absolutely false. I had
seen A.B. in Miss Gilchrist's house on one occasion before....The man I saw
leaving the house was not at all like, nor did I ever see A.B. dressed like the
man I saw...A gentleman who had apartments in Miss Birrell's house took me
to my aunt's house. I saw several policemen on the night of the murder. I don't
remember saying that it was a Donegal cap the man had on, but it was in my mind
all the same. I remember, on the Sunday night after the New Year of 1909 I had
a visit from Detective Inspector Trench and Detective Keith. I don't remember
them showing me a sketch of Oscar Slater on that occasion, and I was not asked
to identify him. On that occasion neither Trench nor Keith referred to A.B. I
did not say in answer to a question as to whether A.B. was the man I saw "It's
gey funny if it wasn't him I saw."...The whole of that story is absolutely
false. At the interview on the Sunday night after the New Year A.B.'s name was
never mentioned. I did not know Oscar Slater before the night of the murder. I
never saw him before that. I never saw him in company with a man named Nugent.
I was not in Oscar Slater's house, I didn't even know where he lived. I had
nothing whatever to do with Slater previous to the murder and knew nothing
about him. I wish to make it quite clear that neither to the Procurator Fiscal
nor to the police, nor to anyone else, did I make the statement that A.B. was
the man I saw leaving the house. When the identification took place in America,
Barrowman, Pyper, and I were standing in the hall of the police office when
Slater passed. I was the first to identify him. I said, "There's the man
coming," and Mary Barrowman said, "Oh, ay that's him." I identified him most of
all by his walk and his make and his general appearance, but not by his face.
When I saw the man in the house on the day of the murder I thought his face was
bare by the side of it, but I could not say positively whether he had a
moustache or not.</p>

of Oscar Slater out to Helen Lambie. I have no clear recollection of what

conversation, round to the question if she knew the man who left ]Miss
Gilchrist's house, although it was likely that was done. There was not such a
word said in my presence as a suggestion from Lieutenant Trench that A.B. was
the man that Helen Lambie saw leaving the house. If such a thing had been said
I would have remembered it. It is not true that she replied: "It's gey funny if
it wasn't him I saw."...Lieutenant Trench's statement, as contained on page

  <p>Compeared Mary Barrowman (20), residing at 19 Windsor Street, Glasgow,
who states: &mdash; I was employed by Mr. Maccallum, a bootmaker in Great
Western Road, in December, 1908. I remember that I was sent out with a parcel
about seven o'clock on the night of 21st December, 1908. The shop was kept by
Mr. Maccallum and Miss Maccallum, and sometimes old Mr. Maccallum came in.
These were the only people employed in the shop except myself. I cannot
remember who gave me the parcel. I got parcels to deliver both from Mr.
Maccallum and Miss Maccallum, and I cannot say who gave me the parcel that
night. The parcel was addressed to Mr. Howat, 36 Cleveland Street; I was often
down at Mr. Howat's house, but I could not say if I delivered another parcel to
him shortly before the 21st of December. As far as I remember, I went up
Barrington Drive and along West Princes Street to St. George's Road. I don't
remember speaking to anyone on the way to West Princes Street. I went along
Princes Street on the south side. It was dark at the time. As I came near the
close of the house where !Miss Gilchrist lived, and when I was near a lamp, I
saw a man running down the steps from her outside door. Without stopping he
looked towards George's Road and then in my direction, and then he ran towards
me, and as he came up to me he came up against me. I was on the pavement at
this time. When he passed me he did not turn and look at me. As he passed me I
was next the lamp and he was nearer the houses, and the light of the lamp shone
down upon him. I had a good look at him. I saw his face. He had a Donegal hat
on. I don't remember the colour of it or whether it was dark or light. He had a
fawn overcoat on, and under the overcoat a dark suit of clothes. Now I don't
remember what colour of boots he had on. His nose was twisted at the upper part
of the bridge. I don't remember if he had a moustache or not. I knew what a
Donegal hat was then, and my original description may have been a tweed cloth
hat, but I would have called it a Donegal hat. The man passed me very quickly.
I had a good look at him. I think I could have identified him again, although
it was a very short look I had. He was alone. After he passed me I turned and
looked at him, but I don't remember of walking after him. He ran along to the
corner of West Cumberland Street, and then he turned down that street. As long
as he was in my sight I did not see anyone join him. I did not see him take off
his hat after he passed me. As far as I remember, he had his hands in the
overcoat pockets. I am quite clear about all that. I did not see two men</p>

  <p>run straight past West Cumberland Street. After the man went down West
Cumberland Street I went on with the parcel. I did not see anyone come out of
the door of Miss Gilchrist's house. I don't remember seeing any other body in
West Princes Street at that time. I went right along to St. George's Road, and
then to Mr. Howat's house, by what direction I could not say, but I think it
would be down George's Road and then down North Street. I remember arriving at
Mr. Howat's house. I think it was Mrs. Howat who took the parcel, but I am not
quite sure. After delivering the parcel I went back to the shop, but I don't
remember what road I went home. I don't remember passing along West Princes
Street again. I left the shop at eight o'clock, so far as I remember, and I
went to the Band of Hope in Walker Street, of which Mr. Barbour was then
Superintendent. After the Band of Hope meeting I heard of the murder, and I and
some of the other girls went down to West Princes Street. That was not in the
direction of my home. I saw the crowd there and heard more about the murder,
and afterwards went home. My mother was angry with me for being late, and I
told her about the murder and about the man I had seen. A day or two afterwards
&mdash; two days after my mother informed Detective M'Gimpsey and an officer of
the police came and saw me. I think it was Detective Pyper to whom I first made
a statement. I afterwards went out to America to identify Slater. I had not
seen any portrait of him before that. I don't remember seeing any portrait of
him before I went to the court house to identify him. When I was in the
corridor of the court house I saw three men pass me. There were with me then
Mr. Adams, Mr. Pyper, Mr. Warnock, and Miss Lambie. I am sure that I recognised
the man first and said to Mr. Pyper: &mdash; "There's the man coming" before I
heard Miss Lambie say anything about it. Then I went into the court room and
identified him there, as I have described in my evidence at the trial. I am
quite certain the night I went out to deliver the parcel was the night of the
murder. Two detectives came with me afterwards to Mr. Howat's house to make
sure that I had delivered the parcel. I think they were Detectives Trench and
Cameron.</p>

at 333 Great Western Road, Glasgow. My father and sister were also employed
along with me, and the only other person employed was Mary Barrowman. On the
21st of December, 1908, I am quite sure that Mary Barrowman went with a parcel
with a pair of boots to Mr. Howat, at 36 Cleveland Street. I cannot say whether
there was an entry to that effect in my books. I have not got the books now,
because since we have removed to another address they have gone amissing. I
think Mary Barrowman was sent on another message to Mr. Howat a few days
previous to 21st December. Although my books were here and showed no entry of a
message to Mr. Howat's house, that would not necessarily mean that Mary
Barrowman had not gone with such a message, as the boots might only be
straightened, and there would be no charge for that. I have no reason to
believe that Mary Barrowman did not go on that message that day, and I never

  <p>Further, on the same date, Colin Gillies Maccallum states that he did not
make the statement to Lieutenant Trench that is contained in No. 15 of the
Appendix annexed to Lieutenant Trench's precognition. I did meet Lieutenant
Trench about the months of December or January last, in the entry leading up to
our house, but as my mother was ill I did not take him in. I did not state to
him that I was and still am convinced that Mary Barrowman was not sent that
message on the night of the murder but several nights before. I never said that
Mary Barrowman did not go the message on the night of the murder and that she
insisted that she did. I never said to Inspector Pyper that Barrowman had not
gone on the message to Mr. Howat on the night of the murder and showed him my
books in support of that statement. I never said to Lieutenant Trench that I
was sure that Barrowman did not go that message on the night of the murder and
that my books bore me out. That statement is absolutely false.</p>

boot and shoe maker's shop at 333 Great Western Road, Glasgow, in December,
1908. Mary Barrowman was employed as a message girl in the shop in December,
1908. I cannot say whether she was sent upon a message to Mr. Howat's, 36
Cleveland Street, on 21st December, 1908. The Howats were very good customers
of ours and messages were frequently sent to them, and for aught I know Mary
Barrowman may have gone with a message there on 21st December, 1908. Even if
there was no entry in our books, it would not necessarily mean that she had not
gone there. Our books have gone amissing since we were in that shop.</p>

of the Mission on the evening of Monday, 21st December, 1908. Miss Mary
Barrowman, whom I know very well, was a fairly regular attender at the Mission
and used to aid by singing at the entertainments. The opinion I formed of her

and indifferent to other people's opinion. She seemed to be a smart girl. I
cannot say if she was at the meeting on the 21st December, 1908, as we keep no

states: &mdash; I am a school teacher, and on 21st December, 1908, I resided at
48 Grant Street, Glasgow. The house was in the same block as Miss Gilchrist's
house and the back windows looked in towards hers. I was cited as witness for
the Crown, but was not called at the trial of Oscar Slater. When I went to
Dunard Street School I went west along Grant Street to West Cumberland Street,
and turned north along the east side of that street till I came to West Princes
Street. On 21st December, 1908, I left my house about eight minutes past seven.
Since the time of the trial I have tried to forget what occurred on the evening
of 21st December, 1908, and I have only a vague recollection now of what
occurred, but I am prepared to say that the statements in my precognition are
absolutely true, as I had a clear recollection of the facts then. I can say
distinctly that when I came to the corner of West Princes Street I saw two men
running west, and that one of them jostled me. I can only say that previous to
seeing these two men I did not see a single man running down West Cumberland
Street. The two men did not turn down West Cuniberiand Street, but ran straight
on in a westerly direction. I did not see them turn either north or south from
West Princes Street. I could not now describe how they were dressed. A man was
shown to me along with others, and I identified him as being one of the men I
saw. I was afterwards informed that his name was Oscar Slater. I am quite
unable now to speak to the clothes the men were wearing. I remember that in
crossing Great Western Road I saw the time in a chemist's shop.</p>

  Arthur Thomson Glegg, Esquire, Advocate, Sheriff Substitute of
Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p>Compeared Agnes Brown, who, being solemnly sworn and examined, declares:
&mdash; I am 30 years of age, a school teacher, and reside at 48 Bank Street,
Glasgow.</p>

  <p>On Monday, 21st December, 1908, about 7.8 p.m., I left the house there to
attend evening classes in Dunard Street School. I went west along Grant Street
to West Cumberland Street, and turned north along the east side of that street
till I came to West Princes Street. I was in the act of stepping off the foot-
pavement there to cross West Princes Street at an angle towards Carrington
Street (a north-westerly direction) when two men came running past me from the
direction of George's Road. They were on the foot-pavement (south foot-
pavement) off West Princes Street. They were going very quickly, and the one
nearest me came against me in passing. He merely touched me. He never spoke,
however, and both continued running west along West Princes Street. They kept
on the foot-pavement for a little distance and then they crossed to the centre
of the street.</p>

  <p>I stood for a moment at the corner of Carrington Street to see where they
went, and they turned down Rupert Street towards Great Western Road.</p>

  <p>I then passed down Carrington Street to Great Western Road, but I saw no
more of them. In crossing that road I saw the time on a clock in a chemist's
shop that it was then 7.12.</p>

  <p>I returned home from my classes shortly after 10 o'clock, and then
learned of Miss Gilchrist's murder from my two sisters.</p>

  <p>I did not at the time associate the two men with the murder, but next
morning, after reading a description in the "Glasgow Herald" of a man who was
said to have left deceased's house, I thought he might be one of the two men
referred to.</p>

  <p>I did not see the face of either man, but so far as I could make out they
were each about 30 years of age and about 5 feet 9 inches in height. The one
next me was of medium build, with dark hair, and seemed to be clean shaven. He
wore a three-quarter length grey-coloured overcoat, I think tweed; dark
trousers, probably brown; dark tweed cap without flaps, and had both hands in
his coat pockets as he ran away. I took no notice of his boots. The man
furthest from me was of medium build, but seemed to be squarer than the other
man. He had very dark hair, probably jet black, well groomed and glossy, and
was bareheaded He wore a navy blue overcoat with velvet collar, dark trousers,
and black boots. He had also a stand-up white collar which seemed to be very
clean, and carried something in his left hand &mdash; the one furthest from
me.</p>

  <p>I could not say what this was. It might have been a walking stick, but I
thought it looked clumsier than a walking stick.</p>

  <p>I know the house which was occupied by Miss Gilchrist.</p>

  <p>It is about 200 yards east from the corner of West Cumberland Street and
Princes Street, where the two men ran past me.</p>

  <p>Re-examined, says:&mdash;</p>

  <p>I adhere to the above statements as correct, and have to add that on
Sunday, 21st February, I saw in the Central Police Office prisoner Oscar
Slater. He was then dressed in a grey Melton overcoat with velvet collar, and
was bareheaded. I recognised him as one of the two men I had seen running away
on the Monday night in question. He was bareheaded when I saw him running away,
and the man who was with him was wearing a dark close-fitting cap.</p>

  <p>It is possible that Slater might be wearing another coat under the Melton
overcoat, as the latter is large enough to cover another overcoat.</p>

  <p>I also recognise Slater by his profile. I did not get a front view of his
face, but I picked him out from a number of men &mdash; 12 to 14 as I think
&mdash; in the police office, and I have not the slightest doubt about him.</p>

  <p>It was not only by his profile and back view, but the shape of his neck
and ears and square shoulders.</p>

  <p>I did not see Slater with a cap or hat when he was running away, but the
man who was with him had a cap like the dark greenish cap shown me.</p>

  <p>I think the second man resembles a man whom I had seen repeatedly in
Grant Street, always between 7 and 8 p.m.; that street runs parallel with West
Princes Street.</p>

  <p>I have seen Miss Gilchrist recently at her back bedroom window, and I
have seen her lift the window. I can't say I saw her put anything out. These
occasions were when she seemed to be dressing.</p>

  <p>Also truth.</p>

  <p>Compeared Allan M'Lean (32), residing at Lambhill House, Lambhill, who
states: &mdash; In December, 1908, I was a member of the Sloper Club, 24 India
Street, Glasgow; I remember a man visited that club whom I only knew as Oscar.
I did not know him at that time by the name Oscar Slater, but merely Oscar. I
heard, in the month of December, that he was offering a pawn ticket for a
brooch to a friend of mine named Anderson. I heard of the murder of Miss
Gilchrist on the 21st December. I say in the original statement that "I noticed
after the murder of Miss Gilchrist on 21st instant he did not return to the
club, and on hearing that he had been offering a pawn ticket for a valuable
diamond brooch for sale, which was alleged to have been pledged for &pound;50
on the day of the murder, I on Friday, 25th instant, went to the Detective
Department, Central Police Office, and reported the matter. It was not so much
his absence from the club that directed my suspicion towards him as his
offering the pawn ticket for sale. I had only seen him three times in the club,
and I myself was not a regular attender I had formerly seen him. go up a close
in St. George's Road which I thought led to his home. Between 7 and 8 o'clock
p.m. on 25th December, 1908, I took Detective Inspector Powell to the close. I
think I had told Inspector Powell by this time that his name was Slater. I
remained on the other side of the street from the close, and the Inspector went
up; he afterwards came down and told me that he had made inquiries and there
was no one of that name there. I did not see Slater near the close on that
occasion, nor did I know then which of the houses on the stair was his. The
close seemed quite quiet when I was standing opposite it. I wish to explain
that at the early times I saw the man in the club I understood his name was
Oscar, but previous to the day of the murder I discovered his name to be
Slater.</p>

  <p>Glasgow Police. I was along with Superintendent Ord in Miss Gilchrist's
house on the night of the murder on 21st December, 1908. I saw Helen Lambie in
the house, and took her into a room and pressed her with questions as to the
identity of the man whom she had seen coming out of the house. She told me she
was quite unable to identify him. She did not give me a description of the man,
as I understood the other officers had got it. I did not afterwards get a
description of the man from Helen Lambie. On 26th December, 1908, I went to a
house, 69 St. George's Road, which had been occupied by Slater under the name
of Anderson. The door was opened by a maid-servant, who gave the name of
Catherine Schmaltz. I asked if she was alone in the house, and she said "Yes."
When I was coming away I passed two ladies on the stair&mdash;they were coming
up&mdash;and I turned and followed them and went into the house and asked the
maid if these two ladies lived there, and she said "Yes." When I went in first
I asked Schmaltz where Anderson had gone to, and she said he had gone to London
with "Madame." I asked the maid for Anderson's address in London, and she said
36 Albemarle Street. Schmaltz told me she was going to London that night, and I
asked her if she was going to the same address, and she said "No, I am going
"to 72 Charlotte Street, care of Ostraw. "When we came back to the house I
asked the ladies their names, and they said Mrs. Freedman and Mrs. Hoppe. They
said that they knew Anderson and Madame in London, and that Freedman was a half-
sister of Madame's. They told me that they were living at the Alexandra Hotel,
and that on Friday", the 25th December, Madame had asked Schmaltz to ask them
to come down, and that they found them busy packing and asked them where they
were going, and Anderson had said that he had got a wire and had to go to Monte
Carlo, and that Anderson had got a loan of &pound;25 from Mrs. Freedman, which
he promised to repay when he came back. She further said that she and Mrs.
Hoppe had arranged to take over the house, paying Stewart &amp; Stewart
&pound;4 a month. Mrs. Freedman also said that they were to get a wire from
Anderson and Madame when they arrived in Monte Carlo. I called at the house on
several occasions afterwards, and on one occasion got a letter addressed to
Oscar Slater, Esq., c/o Mr. Anderson, 69 St. George's Road, Glasgow, which bore
an American postmark. The night after the murder (22nd December, 1908), I was
in Miss Birrell's house, and took a statement from her which was afterwards
handed to the Fiscal. In the course of that statement Miss Birrell did not say
to me that Helen Lambie had told her that the man she had seen leaving the
house on the 21st was A.B. I never heard until this moment that Helen Lambie
was supposed to have made such a statement...and according to the
information I got it was impossible that he could have anything to do with the
murder.</p>

  <p>Compeared James Dornan (38), Detective Inspector, Marine Division,
Glasgow Police, who states: &mdash; In December, 1908, I was Detective Sergeant
in the Western Division, Glasgow. I know this district well, and while it might
have been shorter for Mary Barrowman to go from the boot shop down Barrington
Drive towards Woodlands Road, nevertheless, the route she took is a more
frequented one and a more likely one for her to take. I was present with
Inspector Pyper at various interviews with Miss Birrell, and I never heard her
make any statement throwing any suspicion whatever upon A.B. I was often
present at interviews with Helen Lambie, and she never said anything that
connected A.B. with the case. I never heard from her, or any other person, till
this week that she had told Miss Birrell that the man she saw on the night of
the murder was A.B. I never heard anything that would justify such a
suggestion. I remember Helen Lambie telling me in the County Buildings, within
a week after the murder, that she had noticed a peculiarity in the man's walk,
in the way in which he brought round his foot when walking, and she showed it
with her own foot. When I saw Oscar Slater I thought I saw the peculiarity that
Helen Lambie had described to me. With regard to Helen Lambie, I made careful
inquiries into her character, both at her neighbours, young men whom she knew,
and shopkeepers in the locality, and I found that although she was fond of
joking she was a perfectly respectable girl. I could find no trace of her ever
being in Oscar Slater's house or having any acquaintance with him whatever. On
2nd January, 1909, I, along with other officers, searched Slater's house, and
could find no Runaway matches similar to the matches found in the spare bedroom
in Miss Gilchrist's house on the night of the murder. When Slater returned from
America. I met him at Renfrew and brought him and his baggage up to Glasgow.
The boxes were opened in Slater's presence in the Central Police Station, and
the clothing seemed to be carefully packed. For anything I saw I could not say
that the clothes had been thrown in preparatory to a hurried flight. I saw
labels on the boxes, but I could not say what they were, and I could not say
whether there were railway labels on them "Glasgow to Lime Street, Liverpool."
On 22nd February, 1909, I was present at the Central Police Station when the
witnesses were brought in to identify Slater, and I saw Duncan MacBrayne
brought in, and I remember that he identified him quite clearly.</p>
