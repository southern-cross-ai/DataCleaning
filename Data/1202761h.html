<h3>SOME NOTES ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY</h3>
<p><b>WE</b> brought back with us from the journey towards the
Pole vivid memories of how it feels to be intensely, fiercely
hungry. During the period from November 15, 1908, to February 23,
1909, we had but one full meal, and that was on Christmas Day.
Even then we did not keep the sense of repletion for very long,
for within an hour or two it seemed to us that we were as hungry
as ever. Our daily allowance of food would have been a small one
for a city worker in a temperate climate, and in our case hunger
was increased by the fact that we were performing vigorous
physical labour in a very low temperature. We looked forward to
each meal with keen anticipation, but when the food was in our
hands it seemed to disappear without making us any the less
ravenous. The evening meal at the end of ten hours' sledging used
to take us a long time to prepare. The sledges had to be unpacked
and the camp pitched. Then the cooker was filled with snow and
the Primus lamp lit, often no easy matter with our cold,
frost-bitten fingers. The materials for the thin hoosh would be
placed in the boiling-pot, with the addition, perhaps, of some
pony maize, and the allowance of tea was placed in the outer
boiler. The tea was always put in a strainer, consisting of a
small tin in which we had punched a lot of holes, and it was
removed directly the water had come to the boil. We used to sit
round the cooker waiting for our food, and at last the hoosh
would be ready and would be ladled into the pannikins by the cook
of the week. The scanty allowance of biscuit would be distributed
and we would commence the meal. In a couple of minutes the hot
food would be gone, and we would gnaw carefully round the sides
of our biscuits, making them last as long as possible. Marshall
used sometimes to stand his pannikin of hoosh in the snow for a
little while, because it got thicker as it cooled, but it was a
debatable point whether this paid. One seemed to be getting more
solid food, but there was a loss of warmth, and in the minus
temperatures on the plateau we found it advisable to take our
hoosh very hot. We would make the biscuits last as long as
possible, and sometimes we tried to save a bit to eat in the
sleeping-bag later on, but it was hard to do this. If one of us
dropped a crumb, the others would point it out, and the owner
would wet his finger in his mouth and pick up the morsel. Not the
smallest fragment was allowed to escape.</p>
<p>We used to "turn backs" in order to ensure equitable division
of the food. The cook would pour the hoosh into the pannikins and
arrange the biscuits in four heaps. Perhaps some one would
suggest that one pannikin had rather less in it than another, and
if this view was endorsed by the others there would be a
readjustment. Then when we were all satisfied that the food had
been divided as fairly as possible, one man would turn his back,
and another, pointing at one pannikin or group of biscuits, would
say, "Whose?" The man who had his back turned, and therefore
could not see the food, would give a name, and so the
distribution would proceed, each of us always feeling sure that
the smallest share had fallen to our lot. At lunchtime there
would be chocolate or cheese to distribute on alternate days, and
we much preferred the chocolate days to the cheese days. The
chocolate seemed more satisfying, and it was more easily divided.
The cheese broke up into very small fragments on the march, and
the allowance, which amounted to two spoonfuls per man, had to be
divided up as nearly as possible into four equal heaps. The
chocolate could be easily separated into sticks of equal size. It
can be imagined that the cook for the week had no easy task. His
work became more difficult still when we were using pony-meat,
for the meat and blood, when boiled up, made a delightful broth,
while the fragments of meat sunk to the bottom of the pot. The
liquor was much the better part of the dish, and no one had much
relish for the little dice of tough and stringy meat, so the cook
had to be very careful indeed. Poor old Chinaman was a
particularly tough and stringy horse.</p>
<p>We found that the meat from the neck and rump was the best,
the most stringy portions coming from the ribs and legs. We took
all the meat we could, tough or tender, and as we went south in
the days when horse-meat was fairly plentiful, we used to suck
frozen, raw fragments as we marched along. Later we could not
afford to use the meat except on a definite allowance. The meat
to be used during the day was generally cut up when we took a
spell in the morning, and the bag containing the fragments was
hung on the back of the sledge in order that the meat might be
softened by the sun. It cut more easily when frozen than when
partially thawed, but our knives gradually got blunt, and on the
glacier we secured a rock on which to sharpen them. During the
journey back, when every ounce of weight was of great importance,
we used one of our geological specimens, a piece of sandstone, as
a knife-sharpener. The meat used to bulk large in the pot, but as
fresh meat contains about 60 per cent. of moisture, it used to
shrink considerably in the process of cooking, and we did not
have to use very much snow in the pot.</p>
<p>We used the meat immediately we had started to kill the ponies
in order to save the other food, for we knew that the meat
contained a very large percentage of water, so that we would be
carrying useless weight with it. The pemmican and biscuits, on
the other hand contained very little moisture, and it was more
profitable to keep them for the march further south, when we were
likely to want to reduce the loads as far as possible. We left
meat at each depôt, to provide for the march back to the coast,
but always took on as much as possible of the prepared foods. The
reader will understand that the loss of Socks, which represented
so many pounds of meat, was a very severe blow to us, for we had
after that to use sledging stores at the depôts to make up for
the lost meat. If we had been able to use Socks for food, I have
no doubt that we would have been able to get further south,
perhaps even to the Pole itself, though in that case we could
hardly have got back in time to catch the ship before she was
forced to leave by the approach of winter.</p>
<p>When we were living on meat our desire for cereals and
farinacious foods became stronger; indeed any particular sort of
food of which we were deprived seemed to us to be the food for
which nature craved. When we were short of sugar we would dream
of sweet-stuffs, and when biscuits were in short supply our
thoughts were concerned with crisp loaves and all the other good
things displayed in the windows of the bakers' shops. During the
last weeks of the journey outwards, and the long march back, when
our allowance of food had been reduced to twenty ounces per man a
day, we really thought of little but food. The glory of the great
mountains that towered high on either side, the majesty of the
enormous glacier up which we travelled so painfully, did not
appeal to our emotions to any great extent. Man becomes very
primitive when he is hungry and short of food, and we learned to
know what it is to be desperately hungry. I used to wonder
sometimes whether the people who suffer from hunger in the big
cities of civilisation felt as we were feeling, and I arrived at
the conclusion that they did not, for no barrier of law and order
would have been allowed to stand between us and any food that had
been available. The man who starves in a city is weakened,
hopeless, spiritless, and we were vigorous and keen. Until
January 9 the desire for food was made the more intense by our
knowledge of the fact that we were steadily marching away from
the stores of plenty.</p>
<p>We could not joke about food, in the way that is possible for
the man who is hungry in the ordinary sense. We thought about it
most of the time, and on the way back we used to talk about it,
but always in the most serious manner possible. We used to plan
out the enormous meals that we proposed to have when we got back
to the ship and, later, to civilisation. On the outward march we
did not experience really severe hunger until we got on the great
glacier, and then we were too much occupied with the heavy and
dangerous climbing over the rough ice and crevasses to be able to
talk much. We had to keep some distance apart in case one man
fell into a crevasse. Then on the plateau our faces were
generally coated with ice, and the blizzard wind blowing from the
south made unnecessary conversation out of the question. Those
were silent days, and our remarks to one another were brief and
infrequent. It was on the march back that we talked freely of
food, after we had got down the glacier and were marching over
the barrier surface. The wind was behind us, so that the pulling
was not very heavy, and as there were no crevasses to fear we
were able to keep close together. We would get up at 5 a.m. in
order to make a start at 7 a.m., and after we had eaten our
scanty breakfast, that seemed only to accentuate hunger, and had
begun the day's march, we could take turns in describing the
things we would eat in the good days to come. We were each going
to give a dinner to the others in turn, and there was to be an
anniversary dinner every year, at which we would be able to eat
and eat and eat. No French chef ever devoted more thought to the
invention of new dishes than we did.</p>
<p>It is with strange feelings that I look back over our notes,
and see the wonderful meals that we were going to have. We used
to tell each other, with perfect seriousness, about the new
dishes that we had thought of, and if the dish met with general
approval there would be a chorus of, "Ah! That's good." Sometimes
there would be an argument as to whether a suggested dish was
really an original invention, or whether it did not too nearly
resemble something that we had already tasted in happier days.
The "Wild roll" was admitted to be the high-water mark of
gastronomic luxury. Wild proposed that the cook should take a
supply of well-seasoned minced meat, wrap it in rashers of fat
bacon, and place around the whole an outer covering of rich
pastry, so that it would take the form of a big sausage-roll.
Then this roll would be fried with plenty of fat. My best dish,
which I must admit I put forward with a good deal of pride as we
marched over the snow, was a sardine pasty, made by placing
well-fried sardines inside pastry. At least ten tins of sardines
were to be emptied on to a bed of pastry, and the whole then
rolled up and cooked, preparatory to its division into four equal
portions. I remember one day Marshall came forward with a
proposal for a thick roll of suet pudding with plenty of jam all
over it, and there arose quite a heated argument as to whether he
could fairly claim this dish to be an invention, or whether it
was not the jam roll already known to the housewives of
civilisation. There was one point on which we were all agreed,
and that was that we did not want any jellies or things of that
sort at our future meals. The idea of eating such elusive stuff
as jelly had no appeal to us at all.</p>

<p>On a typical day during this backward march we would leave
camp at about 6.40 a.m., and half an hour later would have
recovered our frost-bitten fingers, while the moisture on our
clothes, melted in the sleeping-bags, would have begun to ablate,
after having first frozen hard. We would be beginning to march
with some degree of comfort, and one of us would remark, "Well,
boys, what are we going to have for breakfast to-day?" We had
just finished our breakfast as a matter of fact, consisting of
half a pannikin of semi-raw horse-meat, one biscuit and a half
and a pannikin of tea, but the meal had not taken the keenness
from our appetites. We used to try to persuade ourselves that our
half-biscuit was not quite a half, and sometimes we managed to
get a little bit more that way. The question would receive our
most serious and careful consideration at once, and we would
proceed to weave from our hungry imaginations a tale of a day
spent in eating. "Now we are on board ship", one man would say.
"We wake up in a bunk, and the first thing we do is to stretch
out our hands to the side of the bunk and get some chocolate,
some Garibaldi biscuits and some apples. We eat those in the
bunk, and then we get up for breakfast. Breakfast will be at
eight o'clock, and we will have porridge, fish, bacon and eggs,
cold ham, plum pudding, sweets, fresh roll and butter, marmalade
and coffee. At eleven o'clock we will have hot cocoa, open jam
tarts, fried cods' roe and slices of heavy plum cake. That will
be all until lunch at one o'clock. For lunch we will have Wild
roll, shepherd's pie, fresh soda-bread, hot milk, treacle
pudding, nuts, raisins and cake. After that we will turn in for a
sleep, and we will be called at 3.45, when we will reach out
again from the bunks and have doughnuts and sweets. We will get
up then and have big cups of hot tea and fresh cake and chocolate
creams. Dinner will be at six, and we will have thick soup, roast
beef and Yorkshire pudding, cauliflower, peas, asparagus, plum
pudding, fruit, apple pie with thick cream, scones and butter,
port wine, nuts, and almonds and raisins. Then at midnight we
will have a really big meal, just before we go to bed. There will
be melon, grilled trout and butter-sauce, roast chicken with
plenty of livers, a proper salad with eggs and very thick
dressing, green peas and new potatoes, a saddle of mutton, fried
suet pudding, peaches <i>à la Melba</i>, egg curry, plum pudding
and sauce, Welsh rarebit, Queen's pudding, angels on horseback,
cream cheese and celery, fruit, nuts, port wine, milk and cocoa.
Then we will go to bed and sleep till breakfast time. We will
have chocolate and biscuits under our pillows, and if we want
anything to eat in the night we will just have to get it." Three
of us would listen to this programme and perhaps suggest
amendments and improvements, generally in the direction of
additional dishes, and then another one of us would take up the
running and sketch another glorious day of feeding and
sleeping.</p>
<p>I daresay that all this sounds very greedy and uncivilised to
the reader who has never been on the verge of starvation, but as
I have said before, hunger makes a man primitive. We did not
smile at ourselves or at each other as we planned wonderful feats
of over-eating. We were perfectly serious about the matter, and
we noted down in the back pages of our diaries details of the
meals that we had decided to have as soon as we got back to the
places where food was plentiful. All the morning we would allow
our imaginations to run riot in this fashion. Then would come one
o'clock, and I would look at my watch and say, "Camp!" We would
drop the harness from our tired bodies and pitch the tent on the
smoothest place available, and three of us would get inside to
wait for the thin and scanty meal, while the other man filled the
cooker with snow and fragments of frozen meat. An hour later we
would be on the march again, once more thinking and talking of
food, and this would go on until the camp in the evening. We
would have another scanty meal, and turn into the sleeping-bags,
to dream wildly of food that somehow we could never manage to
eat.</p>
<p>The dysentery from which we suffered during the latter part of
the journey back to the coast was certainly due to the meat from
the pony Grisi. This animal was shot one night when in a greatly
exhausted condition, and I believe that his flesh was made
poisonous by the presence of the toxin of exhaustion, as is the
case with animals that have been hunted. Wild was the first to
suffer, at the time when we started to use Grisi meat with the
other meat, and he must have been unfortunate enough to get the
greater part of the bad meat on that occasion. The other meat we
were using then came from Chinaman, and seemed to be quite
wholesome. A few days later we were all eating Grisi meat, and we
all got dysentery. The meat could not have become affected in any
way after the death of the pony, because it froze hard within a
very short time. The manner in which we managed to keep on
marching when suffering, and the speed with which we recovered
when we got proper food, were rather remarkable, and the reason,
no doubt, was that the dysentery was simply the result of the
poison, and was not produced by organic trouble of any sort. We
had a strong wind behind us day after day during this period, and
this contributed in a very large measure to our safety, for in
the weakened condition we had then reached we could not have made
long marches against a headwind, and without long marches we
would have starved between the depôts. We had a sail on the
sledge, formed of the floorcloth of a tent, and often the sledge
would overrun us, though at other times it would catch in a drift
and throw us heavily.</p>
<p>When we were travelling along during the early part of the
journey over the level Barrier surface, we felt the heat of the
sun severely, though as a matter of fact the temperature was
generally very low, sometimes as low as zero Fahr., though the
season was the height of summer. It was quite usual to feel one
side of the face getting frozen while the other side was being
sunburned. The ponies would have frozen perspiration on their
coats on the sheltered side, while the sun would keep the other
side hot and dry, and as the day wore on and the sun moved round
the sky the frosted area on the animals would change its position
in sympathy. I remember that on December 4 we were marching
stripped to our shirts, and we got very much sunburned, though at
noon that day the air temperature showed ten degrees of frost.
When we started to climb the glacier and marched close to the
rocks, we felt the heat much more, for the rocks acted as
radiators, and this experience weighed with me in deciding to
leave all the spare clothing and equipment at the Upper Glacier
Depôt, about seven thousand feet up. We did not expect to have to
climb much higher, but, as the reader knows, we did not reach the
plateau until we had climbed over ten thousand feet above
sea-level, and so we felt the cold extremely. Our windproof
Burberry clothing had become thin by this time, and had been
patched in many places in consequence of having been torn on the
sharp ice. The wind got in through a tear in my Burberry trousers
one day and I was frost-bitten on the under part of the knee.
This frost-bite developed into an open wound, into which the wool
from my underclothing worked, and I had finally to perform a
rather painful operation with a knife before the wound would
heal. We were continually being frost-bitten up on the plateau,
and when our boots had begun to give out and we were practically
marching on the sennegrass inside the finnesko, our heels got
frost-bitten. My heels burst when we got on to hard stuff, and
for some time my socks were caked with blood at the end of every
day's march. Finally Marshall put some "Newskin" on a pad, and
that stuck on well until the cracks had healed. The scars are
likely to remain with me. In the very cold days, when our
strength had begun to decrease, we found great difficulty in
hoisting the sail on our sledge, for when we lifted our arms
above our heads in order to adjust the sail, the blood ran from
our fingers and they promptly froze. Ten minutes or a quarter of
an hour sometimes elapsed before we could get the sledge properly
rigged. Our troubles with frost-bite were no doubt due in a
measure to the lightness of our clothing, but there was
compensation in the speed with which we were able to travel. I
have no doubt at all that men engaged in polar exploration should
be clothed as lightly as is possible, even if there is a danger
of frost-bite when they halt on the march.</p>
<p>The surface over which we travelled during the southern
journey changed continually. During the first few days we found a
layer of soft snow on top of a hard crust, with more soft snow
underneath that again. Our weight was sufficient to break through
the soft snow on top, and if we were pulling the increased
pressure would cause the crust to break also, letting us through
into the second layer of soft snow. This surface made the
travelling very heavy. Until we had got beyond Minna Bluff we
often passed over high, sharp sastrugi, and beyond that we met
with ridges four to six feet high. The snow generally was dry and
powdery, but some of the crystals were large, and showed in
reflected light all the million colours of diamonds. After we had
passed latitude 80° South the snow got softer day by day, and the
ponies would often break through the upper crust and sink in
right up to their bellies. When the sun was hot the travelling
would be much better, for the surface snow got near the
melting-point and formed a slippery layer not easily broken. Then
again a fall in the temperature would produce a thin crust,
through which one broke very easily. Between latitude 80° South
and 83° South there were hard sastrugi under the soft snow, and
the hoofs of the horses suffered in consequence. The surface near
the land was broken up by the pressure from the glaciers, but
right alongside the mountains there was a smooth plain of glassy
ice, caused by the freezing of water that had run off the rocky
slopes when they were warm under the rays of the sun. This
process had been proceeding on the snow slopes that we had to
climb in order to reach the glacier. Here at the foot of the
glacier there were pools of clear water round the rocks, and we
were able to drink as much as we wanted, though the contact of
the cold water with our cracked lips was painful.</p>
<p>The glacier itself presented every variety of surface, from
soft snow to cracked and riven blue ice, by-and-by the only
constant feature were the crevasses, from which we were never
free. Some were entirely covered with a crust of soft snow, and
we discovered them only when one of us broke through, and hung by
his harness from the sledge. Others occurred in mazes of rotten
ice, and were even more difficult to negotiate than the other
sort. The least unpleasant of the crevasses were those that were
wide open and easily seen, with firm ice on either side. If these
crevasses were not too wide, we would pull the sledges up to the
side, then jump over, and pull them after us. This was more
difficult than it sounds from the fact that the ice gave only a
very uncertain footing, but we always had the harness as a
safeguard in case of a fall. If the crevasses were wide we had to
make a <i>détour</i>. The sledges, owing to their length, were
not liable to slip down a crevasse, and we felt fairly safe when
we were securely attached to them by the harness. When the
surface was so bad that relay work became necessary we used to
miss the support of a sledge on the back journeys. We would
advance one sledge half a mile or a mile, put up a bamboo pole to
mark the spot, and then go back for the other. We were roped
together for the walk back to the second sledge, but even then we
felt a great deal less secure than when harnessed to one of the
long, heavy sledges. On some days we had to travel up steep
slopes of smooth ice, and often it became necessary to cut steps
with our ice-axes, and haul the sledges after us with the Alpine
rope. When we had gone up about sixty feet, the length of the
rope, we would haul up the sledge to which we had attached the
lower end, and jamb it so that it could not slide back. Then one
of us would slide down in order to fix the rope to the other
sledge.</p>
<p>One of the curious features of the glacier was a yellow line,
evidently an old moraine, extending for thirty or forty miles.
The rocks of the moraine had gradually sunk in out of sight, the
radiation of the sun's heat from them causing the ice to melt and
let them through, and there had remained enough silt and dust to
give the ice a dirty yellow appearance. The travelling along this
old moraine was not so bad, but on either side of it there was a
mass of pressure ice, caused by the constriction of the glacier
between the mountains to the east and west. Unfortunately we
brought back no photographs of this portion of the glacier. The
number of plates at our disposal was limited, and on the outward
march we decided not to take many photographs in case we found
interesting land or mountains in the far south nearer the Pole.
We thought that we would be able to secure as many photographs of
the glacier as we wanted on the way back if we had the plates to
spare, but as a matter of fact when we did get on to the glacier
a second time we were so short of food that we could not afford
the time to unpack the camera, which had to be stowed away
carefully on the sledge in order to avoid damage to it.</p>

<p align="center"><small>5. PENGUINS LISTENING TO THE GRAMOPHONE
DURING THE SUMMER</small></p>
<p>Many nights on the glacier there was no snow on which to pitch
the tents, and we had to spend perhaps an hour smoothing out a
space on a rippled, sharp-pointed sea of ice. The provision bags
and sledges had to be packed on the snow cloths round the tents,
and it was indeed fortunate for us that we did not meet with any
bad weather while we were marching up the glacier. Had a blizzard
come on while we were asleep, it would have scattered our goods
far and wide, and we would have been faced with a very serious
position. All the time that we were climbing the glacier we had a
northerly wind behind us, although the direction of the sastrugi
showed clearly that the prevailing wind was from the south; when
we were coming back later in the season the wind was behind us
all the time. We encountered a strong wind on the outward journey
when near the top of the glacier, and as the ice slopes were
covered with snow it was difficult to pull the sledges up them.
When we reached the same slopes on the way back, the summer sun
had cleared the snow from them, leaving clear ice, and we simply
glissaded down all but the steepest slopes, although one of the
sledge runners was very badly torn. We had to travel carefully on
the steep slopes, for if we had let the sledge get out of hand it
would have run away altogether, and would probably have been
smashed up hundreds of feet below.</p>
<p>The Upper Glacier Depôt was overhung by great cliffs of rock,
shattered by the frosts and storms of countless centuries, and
many fragments were poised in such a fashion that scarcely more
than a touch seemed needed to bring them hurtling down. All
around us on the ice lay rocks that had recently fallen from the
heights, and we wondered whether some boulder would come down
upon us while we were in camp. We had no choice of a
camping-ground, as all around was rough ice. The cliffs were
composed largely of weathered sandstone, and it was on the same
mountains, higher up the glacier, that the coal was found, at a
point where the slope was comparatively gentle. Looking down from
this height, we could see the glacier stretching away to the
point of junction with the Barrier, the mountains rising to east
and west. Many of the mountains to the west of the glacier were
more or less dome-shaped, but there were some sharp conical peaks
to the westward of the particular mountain under which the Upper
Glacier Depôt had been placed. There were three distinct peaks,
as the photographs show, and the plateau ice sweeping down made a
long moraine on the west side of the glacier. To the eastward
there was a long ridge of high mountains, fairly uniform in shape
and without any sharp peaks, but with ridges, apparently of
granite, projecting towards the west and so constricting the
glacier. The mountains were distant about twenty-five miles, but
well-defined stratification lines could plainly be seen. Below
us, as we looked from the depôt, could be seen the cumulus clouds
that always hung above the "Cloudmaker".</p>
<p>When we looked to the south from this depôt we saw no clouds;
there was nothing but hard clear sky. The sky gave no indication
of the blizzard winds that were to assail us when we reached the
plateau, and after we had gone as far south as we could and
retraced our footsteps to the depôt, we looked back and saw the
same clear sky, with a few wisps of fleecy cloud in it. We had no
doubt that below those clouds the pitiless gale was still raging
across the great frozen plain, and that the wind which followed
us during our march back to the coast was coming from the
vicinity of the Pole. As we advanced from the Upper Glacier Depôt
we came upon great ice falls. The surface looked smooth from a
distance, and we thought that we were actually on the plateau,
but as we advanced we saw that before us lay enormous ridges
rising abruptly. We had to relay our gear over these ridges, and
often at the tops there would be a great crevasse, from which
would radiate smaller crevasses fringed with crystals and showing
ghastly depths below. We would creep forward to see what lay on
the other side, and perhaps would find a fall of fifty feet, with
a grade of about 1 in 3. Many times we risked our sledge on very
severe slopes, allowing it to glissade down, but other times the
danger of a smash was too great, and we had to lower the sledge
slowly and carefully with the rope. The ice was safe enough to
walk upon at this time except at the ridges, where the crevasses
were severe, for the smaller crevasses in the hollows and slopes
could be passed without difficulty.</p>
<p>The ice falls delayed us a good deal, and then we got into
soft snow, over which the sledge dragged heavily. We thought that
we were finally on the plateau level, but within a few days we
came to fresh ridges and waves of pressure ice. The ice between
the waves was very rotten, and many times we fell through when we
put our weight on it. We fastened the Alpine rope to the sledge
harness, and the first man pulled at a distance of about eighteen
feet from the sledge, while the whole party was so scattered that
no two men could fall into a crevasse together. We got on to
better ground by steering to the westward, but this step was
rather dangerous, for by taking this course we travelled parallel
with the crevasses and were not able to meet them at right
angles. Many times we nearly lost the sledge and ourselves when
the ice started to break away into an unseen crevasse running
parallel with our course. We felt very grateful to Providence
that the weather remained clear, for we could not have moved a
yard over this rotten ice in thick weather without courting
disaster. I do not know whether the good weather we experienced
in that neighbourhood was normal. We generally had about seven
miles of easy going after we had passed one ridge in this area,
and then another ridge would rise up ahead of us, and we would
start to climb again. There were always crevasses at the top of
the ridges, suggesting that the ice was moving over land at no
great depth.</p>
<p>We passed the last ridge at last, and reached the actual
plateau, but instead of hard névé, such as the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition had encountered in the journey to the plateau beyond
the mountains west of McMurdo Sound, we found soft snow and hard
sastrugi. All the sastrugi pointed to the south, and the wind
blew strongly nearly all the time from the south or south-east,
with an occasional change to the south-west. Sometimes we marched
on hard sastrugi, and at other times we had soft snow under our
feet, but could feel the sastrugi on which the snow was lying. I
formed the opinion that during the winter on the plateau the wind
must blow with terrible violence from the south, and that the
hard sastrugi are produced then. Still further south we kept
breaking through a hard crust that underlay the soft surface
snow, and we then sank in about eight inches. This surface, which
made the marching heavy, continued to the point at which we
planted the flag. After the long blizzard, from the night of
January 6 until the morning of January 9, we had a better surface
over which to make our final march southwards, for the wind had
swept the soft snow away and produced a fairly hard surface, over
which, unencumbered with a sledge as we were, we could advance
easily.</p>
<p>We found the surface generally to be improved on the march
back. The blizzard winds had removed the soft surface snow, and
incidentally uncovered many of the crevasses. We were following
our outward tracks, and often I noticed the tracks lead us to the
edge of a crevasse which had been covered previously and over
which we had passed in ignorance of our danger on the march
southwards. When we got to the head of the glacier we tried to
take a short cut to the point where we had left the Upper Glacier
Depôt, but we got enmeshed in a maze of crevasses and pressure
ridges to the eastward, and so had to steer in a westerly
direction again in order to get clear. The dangers that we did
know were preferable to those that we did not know. On the way
down the glacier we found all the snow stripped away by the wind
and sun for nearly one hundred miles, and we travelled over
slippery blue ice, with innumerable cracks and sharp edges. We
had many painful falls during this part of the journey. Then when
about forty miles from the foot of the glacier we got into deep
soft snow again, over which rapid progress was impossible. There
had evidently been a heavy snowfall in this area while we were
further south, and for days, while our food was running short, we
could see ahead of us the rocks under which the depôt had been
placed. We toiled with painful slowness towards the rocks, and as
the reader has already learned, we were without any food at all
for the last thirty hours of that march. We found the Barrier
surface to be very soft when we got off the Glacier, but after we
had passed Grisi Depôt there was an improvement. The surface
remained fairly good until we reached the winter quarters, and in
view of our weakened condition it was fortunate for us that it
did so.</p>
<p>In reviewing the experience gained on the southern journey, I
do not think that I could suggest any improvement in equipment
for any future expedition. The Barrier surface evidently varies
in a remarkable fashion, and its condition cannot be anticipated
with any degree of certainty. The traveller must be prepared for
either a hard surface or a very soft one, and he may get both
surfaces in the course of one days march. The eleven-foot sledge
is thoroughly suitable for the work, and our method of packing
the stores and hauling the sledges did not develop any weak
points. We would have been glad to have had crampons for use on
the glacier; what would be better still would be heavy Alpine
boots with nails all round, for very often the surface would give
little grip to crampons, which would only touch the rough ice at
one or two points. The temperature is too cold to permit of the
explorer wearing ordinary leather boots, and some boot would have
to be designed capable of keeping the feet warm and carrying the
nails all round. A mast consisting of a bamboo lashed to the
forward oil-box proved as efficient as could be required for use
in connection with a sail on the sledges. It was easily rigged
and had no elaborate stays. I would suggest no change in the
clothing, for the light woollen underclothing, with thin
windproof material outside, proved most satisfactory in every
way. We could certainly not have travelled so fast had we been
wearing the regulation pilot cloth garment generally used in
polar exploration. Our experience made it obvious that a party
which hopes to reach the Pole must take more food per man than we
did, but how the additional weight is to be provided for is a
matter for individual consideration. I would not take cheese
again, for although it is a good food, we did not find it as
palatable as chocolate, which is practically as sustaining. Our
other foods were all entirely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Each member of the Southern Party had his own particular
duties to perform. Adams had charge of the meteorology, and this
work involved the taking of temperatures at regular intervals,
and the boiling of the hypsometer, sometimes several times in a
day. He took notes during the day, and wrote up the observations
at night in the sleeping-bag. Marshall was the cosmographer and
took the angles and bearings of all the new land; he also took
the meridian altitudes and the compass variation as we went
south. When a meridian altitude was taken, I generally had it
checked by each member of the party, so that the mean could be
taken.</p>
<p>Marshall's work was about the most uncomfortable possible, for
at the end of a day's march, and often at lunch-time, he would
have to stand in the biting wind handling the screws of the
theodolite. The map of the journey was prepared by Marshall, who
also took most of the photographs. Wild attended to the repair of
the sledges and equipment, and also assisted me in the geological
observations and the collection of specimens. It was he who found
the coal close to the Upper Glacier Depôt. I kept the courses and
distances, worked out observations and laid down our directions.
We all kept diaries. I had two, one my observation book, and the
other the narrative diary, reproduced in the first volume.</p>

<h3>SUMMER AT THE WINTER QUARTERS</h3>
<p><b>WE</b> were distant about thirty-two miles from Hut Point
when I decided to send the supporting-party back. The men watched
us move off across the white plain until we became mere dots on
the wide expanse, and then loaded up their gear and started
north. Joyce was left in charge of the party, and he decided to
make one forced march to Hut Point. They had to cross a good deal
of crevassed ice, but a special effort would enable them to make
their next camp under shelter. They got under way at 7 a.m. and
marched till noon, making good progress in spite of the surface.
In the afternoon they marched from two till five o'clock, and
then a final march, from 7 p.m. till 1.30 a.m., took them to the
old <i>Discovery</i> hut. The only incident of the day had been
the succumbing of Brocklehurst's feet to another attack of
frost-bite, he having worn ski-boots when the other men had put
on finnesko. The damage was not serious, although the sufferer
himself had trouble with his feet for some time after. The party
had covered thirty-two miles in fourteen hours and a half, very
good marching in view of the soft and broken character of the
surface.</p>
<p>The party left Hut Point on the morning of November 12, and
had a hard pull to Glacier Tongue. They at first thought of
camping on the southern side of the Tongue, but, fortunately,
kept on, for on the other side they met Day, Murray and Roberts,
who had brought out stores with the motor-car. I had left orders
that about 1800 lb. of provisions and gear should be taken to the
depôt there, as a provision for the sledging-parties, in case
they should be cut off from Cape Royds by open water on their
return. Day had succeeded in running the car right up to the
Tongue, about twelve miles from winter quarters. After a good
meal of biscuits, jam, lobscouse, tongue and cods' roe, the two
parties joined in getting the stores up to the depôt. Then they
all went back to the winter quarters on the car and the light
sledges it had in tow, leaving the heavy sledge that had been
used by the supporting-party to be brought in at some later
opportunity. They reached the hut in the small hours of the
morning, and after another meal turned in for a good sleep.</p>
<p>Routine work occupied the men at the hut for some time after
the return of the supporting-party. The scientific members were
more than a little grieved to find that during the days when the
hut had been untenanted, for Murray, Day and Roberts had been
away too on a small expedition, some of the dogs had managed to
get loose, and had killed thirty or forty penguins. We had from
the first tried very hard to avoid any accidents of this sort,
for we did not want to cause any unnecessary destruction of
animal life. The penguins were now laying, and the men found that
the eggs were very good to eat. The egg of the penguin is about
the same size as that of a duck, and it has a transparent,
jelly-like white and a small yolk. It takes about eight minutes'
boiling to cook the egg nicely, and ten minutes if it is required
set hard to the centre. The shell is the most beautiful
dark-green inside, while the outer shell is chalky and white,
though generally stained prettily by guano. Murray set aside a
certain portion of the rookery for the supply of eggs for
"domestic purposes," partly in order to ensure freshness and
partly in order to ascertain how many eggs the penguins would
lay. The other portion of the rookery was left untouched in order
that the development and education of the young penguins might be
studied.</p>
<p>The scientific work in its various branches was carried on by
the men at the winter quarters, and they made a series of small
expeditions to points of interest in the surrounding country.
"To-day we motored to Tent Island <i>viâ</i> Inaccessible
Island", wrote Priestley on November 14. "The main object of the
expedition was to enable Joyce to kill and skin some young seals,
but we did geological work as well. Day, Joyce, Murray and myself
were the party, and when the motor was pulled up opposite
Inaccessible Island three of us strolled over to look at its
western slopes. We did not have time to climb, but the island
from that side consists entirely of a flow of massive basalt,
with small porphyritic felspars, which show out best in the
weathered specimens. The sheet of basalt appeared to be dipping
to the south. Day endeavoured to join us, but he chose a bad
place, and got so deep in the drift that his axle was aground, so
he was obliged to reverse engines and back out. From there we
proceeded to Tent Island, and after Joyce had picked out a young
seal and started operations, Murray, Day and I climbed up a
water-worn gully on the island and had a cursory look at the
rocks, which are an agglomerate with very coarse fragments;
capping the agglomerate there is a massive flow of kenyte. . . .
Day photographed the lower slopes of the gully while Murray and I
climbed the rock-slopes till they ended, and then cut steps up a
snow slope, at the top of which I came across a snow cornice and
nearly got into trouble getting through it. On reaching the top
we walked along the ridge, and photographed a splendid weathered
kenyte boulder, hollowed out like a summer-house, and studded
with felspars as an old-fashioned church door is studded with
nails. After taking these photographs we climbed down the other
side of the island, and walked round to join the others. The
rock-climbing here, on any slopes at all steep, is very difficult
because of the weathered fragments, which, owing to lack of
powerful natural agents of transportation and to the fact that
the wind carries all the lightest soil away, are left lying just
at their angle of repose; a false step may send mountaineer and
mountain surface hurtling down fifty or a hundred feet&mdash;no
agreeable sensation, as I know from frequent experience. The sun
was very hot to-day, and the gully was occupied by a little
stream which was carrying quite a quantity of light soil down
with it.</p>

<p align="center"><small>11. SMOKE STREAMING FROM THE CRATER OF
MOUNT EREBUS</small></p>
<p>Day had an exciting experience with the car during this
journey. He encountered a big crack in the ice near Cape Barne,
and steering at right angles to its course, put on speed in order
to "fly" it in the usual way. When only a few yards from it and
travelling at a speed of about fifteen miles an hour, he found
that the crack made a sudden turn, so as to follow the line he
was taking, and an instant later his right-hand front wheel
dropped in. Any weak points in the car would have been discovered
by the sudden strain, but happily nothing broke, and the crack
making another turn, the wheel bounded out at the elbow, and the
car was on sound ice again.</p>
<p>On November 16 Priestley made an interesting trip up the
slopes of Erebus. Beyond the lower moraines and separated from
them by a snowfield of considerable size, he found a series of
kenyte ridges and cones, covered by very little <i>débris</i>.
The ridges continued for some distance to the edge of the main
glacier, where they terminated in several well-marked nunataks.
"One which I visited, and which was the nearest to the large
parasitic cone, was eighty feet high, of massive kenyte of brown
colour and close texture, jointed into very large cubical joints
by a very complete series of master-joints. From this nunatak I
obtained nine kinds of lichen, including four or five new
species, and one piece of moss. One of the lichens was so much
larger than the others and branched so much that it might well be
called a forest-lichen, and Murray considers it to be very
closely allied to the reindeer-moss, or ice-moss."</p>
<p>Joyce was engaged at this time in making zoological
collections, and with the aid of the motor-car he was able to
cover a great deal of ground. The motor-car, driven by Day, would
take him fifteen or sixteen miles over the sea-ice to some
suitable locality, generally near the Cathedral Rocks on the
north side of Glacier Tongue, and leave him there to kill seals
and penguins. In order to kill young seals, some specimens of
which were required, he had first to drive the mothers away, and
this often took a long time, as the female seal becomes
aggressive when interfered with in this manner. The work was not
at all pleasant, but Joyce killed and prepared for preservation
five young Weddell seals and four adult specimens. He had taken
lessons in taxidermy before leaving England in order to be ready
for this duty. Joyce and Day also killed and skinned twenty
Emperor penguins, twelve Adelie penguins and twelve skua gulls,
and all the men at the winter quarters assisted in collecting
eggs.</p>

<p align="center"><small>A. THE RETURNING SUN</small></p>
<p>Murray was looking after the scientific work, paying special
attention to his own particular domain, that of biology, and
Marston was devoting as much time as he could to sketching and
painting. He had taken oils, water colours and pastels to the
south with him. He found that the water colours could not be used
in the open at all, for they froze at once. Oils could be used
fairly comfortably in the summer, though it was always chilly
work to sit still for any length of time; during the spring the
oils froze after they had been in the open air for about an hour,
so that steady work was not possible. The pastels could always be
used for making "colour notes", and they were also used for some
of the colour-sketches that are reintroduced in this book. Mits
had to be worn for all outside work, and this made sketching
difficult.</p>
<p>Marston found, as other artists have found, that Nature's
color-schemes in the Antarctic are remarkably crude, though often
wondrously beautiful. Bright blues and greens are seen in violent
contrast with brilliant reds, and an accurate record of the
colours displayed in a sunset, as seen over broken ice, would
suggest to many people an impressionistic poster of the kind seen
in the London streets. Words fail one in an attempt to describe
the wildly bizarre effects observed on days when the sky was
fiery red and pale green, merging into a deep blue overhead, and
the snowfields and rocks showed violet, green and white under the
light of the moon. Marston used to delight in the "grey days",
when there was no direct sunlight and the snow all around showed
the most subtle tones of grey; there would be no shadows
anywhere, perhaps light drifts of snow would be blowing about,
and the whole scene became like a frozen fairyland. The
snow-bergs and snowfields were white under direct light, but any
hollows showed a vivid blue, deepening almost to black in the
depths. There was an unlimited amount of interesting work for an
artist, and Marston suffered to some extent, as did the other
specialists on the expedition, from the fact that the number of
men available was so small that every one, in addition to his own
work, had to take a share in the routine duties.</p>
<p>Joyce devoted what spare time he could find to the completion
of the volumes of the "Aurora Australis". Practice had made him
more skilful in the handling of type, and he was able to make a
good deal of progress, Day assisting with the preparation of the
Venesta boards in which the volumes were to be bound. Some of the
contributions towards the literary part of the work had come in
late, so that there was plenty of work left to do. Marston went
on with the lithographing for the illustrations.</p>
<p>Instructions had been left for a geological reconnaissance to
be made towards the northern slopes of Mount Erebus, to examine,
if possible, some parasitic cones and the oldest main crater of
the mountain. Threatening weather prevented the carrying out of
this plan for some time, yet for nearly a fortnight after the
return of the southern supporting-party the expected blizzard did
not come, while the weather was not propitious for the journey.
At length no further delay was possible if the trip was to be
made, as Priestly, the geologist, had to leave for the western
mountains, so on November 23 the trip was begun, though with
misgivings as to the long overdue blizzard.</p>
<p>The party consisted of Priestley, Marston, Joyce, Murray and
Brocklehurst, and they took seventy pounds of food&mdash;a week's
supply on the ordinary basis of thirty-two ounces per day for
each man&mdash;but carried only one tent, intended to hold three
men, their idea being that one or two men could sleep in the bags
outside the tent. The weather was fine when they left the hut,
but in the afternoon a strong southerly wind sprang up, and they
had to march through low drift. They camped for the night close
to a steep nunatak about five miles from the hut and nearly two
thousand feet above sea-level. There was difficulty in getting a
good snowy camping-ground, and they had to put up the tent on
smooth blue glacier ice, having a thin coating of snow, and
sloping gently down till it terminated in an ice-cliff
overlooking the sea not many hundreds of yards below. After
dinner Priestley, Murray and Joyce climbed over the nunataks, and
found several new lichens, but the specimens collected were lost
in the blizzard later on. Priestley also found a number of very
perfect felspar crystals weathered out of the kenyte, and
collected a couple of handfuls of the best. The members of the
party retired to their sleeping-bags at eight o'clock on Monday
night, and before midnight a blizzard swept down upon them, and
proved to be an exceptionally severe one, with dense drift.
Priestley had volunteered to sleep outside that night, and had
taken his sleeping-bag to a nook in the rocks some distance away.
When the other men heard the roaring of the blizzard they looked
out, and were reassured to find that he had come down while there
was time and had lain down close by the tent. The first night the
light snow round the tent was blown away leaving one side open to
the wind, but the occupants were able to find a few bits of rock
close by, and secured it with those.</p>
<p>"Inside the tent for the next three days we were warm enough
in our sleeping-bags", wrote Murray in his report. "Though we
could not cook anything we ate the dry biscuit and pemmican. The
little snow under the floorcloth was squeezed in the hand till it
became ice, and we sucked this for drink. We were anxious about
Priestley, and occasionally opened the door-flap and hailed him,
when he always replied that he was all right. Joyce had managed
to pass him some food early in the storm, so there was no fear of
starving, but as we learned afterwards he could get nothing to
drink and so could not eat. No one could offer to change places
with him, as in doing so the sleeping-bag would have filled with
snow, and might have blown away. On Wednesday Marston dressed in
his Burberries and crawled down to Priestley, who reported 'All
well', but he had had no food for twenty-four hours. Marston gave
him some biscuits and chocolate. On Thursday morning he replied
to the hail, but he was getting further and further from the
tent, as every time he moved he slipped a little bit down the
smooth glacier. At midday there was no reply to our hail, and we
thought of the precipitous ice-foot and imagined things. Joyce
and I dressed and went out to seek him. The drift was so thick
that nothing whatever could be seen, and when the head was lifted
to try and look the whole face and eyes were instantly covered by
a sheet of ice. We crept about on hands and knees looking for the
lost man. The only chance of getting back to the tent again was
to steer by the wind, down the wind looking for Priestley, up the
wind home again. At one side the sledge lay, forming a landmark,
and Priestley had been not very far from the faraway end.
Creeping along the sledge to where he had lain, I found that he
was not there. Joyce went a little further to the right and came
upon him, all alive."</p>
<p>Priestley's experiences during this period are related in his
diary. "I had volunteered to sleep in the bag outside the tent",
he wrote, "and by the time I was ready to turn in the drift had
started again pretty badly, and the only sheltered spot I could
find was at the top of the hill, so I told Joyce where he would
find me in the morning and camped down, first luckily taking the
precaution to put a few cubic feet of kenyte on my Burberry
trousers and jacket outside the bag. A few hours later I woke up
to find that the wind had increased to the dimensions of a
blizzard, and that the drift was sweeping in a steady cloud over
my head. I realised that those in the tent would have trouble in
reaching me in the morning, so I got out of the bag and dressed,
getting both the bag and my clothes full of snow in the process.
Then, after some trouble, I got the bag down the steep slope of
the nunatak to the sledge, where I wrapped myself up in the
tent-cloth and lay athwart the wind. In about two hours I got
drifted up so close that I was forced to get my shoulders out of
the bag and lever myself out of the drift, and I then tried the
experiment of tying head to wind on the opening of the
sleeping-bag. This answered very well, and it was in this
position that I spent the next seventy-two hours, getting shifted
down a yard or two at a time at every change in the direction of
the wind, and being gradually pushed along the windswept surface
of the glacier until I was some twenty or thirty yards from the
tent, and in some danger of getting swept, as the wind increased
in violence, either on to some rocks a quarter of a mile below or
else straight down the glacier and over a hundred-foot drop into
Horseshoe Bay.</p>
<p>"Three times the people in the tent managed to pass me over
some biscuits and raw pemmican, and Marston got my chocolate from
the rucksack and brought it to me. My chief difficulty, however,
was want of water. I had had a little tea before I turned in, but
from that time for nearly eighty hours I had nothing to drink but
some fragments of ice that I could prise up with the point of a
small safety-pin. The second time Joyce came down, I believe
about the beginning of the third day, he reported that the
lashings at the top of the tent-poles had given way and that a
rent had been torn in the material by the corner of a
biscuit-tin. He added that it was impossible to keep any snow on
the skirt of the tent, and that, as the snow-cloth was kept down
only by a few rocks, the occupants of the tent were in constant
expectation of seeing the tent leave them altogether, then Joyce
left me on this occasion the drift was so thick that he could see
nothing, and had to find his way back by shouting and listening
for the return shouts of his tent-mates. He had gone only a
quarter of the distance when both his eyes were filled with drift
and immediately choked with ice, and when he reached the tent his
face was a mask of ice and both feet were frost-bitten. He was
helped inside and his feet brought round with rubbing, but no
further attempt could be made to reach me. He had brought me some
biscuit and raw pemmican. Cooking was not possible in the tent
owing to the impossibility of reaching the sledge to get the
oil-filler. It may sound like an exaggeration to say that we
could not reach the sledge, which was four yards or less from the
tent, but it must be remembered that we were lying on the slopes
of a clean-swept glacier, on which finnesko could get no hold.
The snow that had covered the ice when we pitched camp had all
disappeared before the fury of the blizzard. Our spiked ski-boots
were on the ice-axes round the sledge, where they had been hung
to dry, but in any case it would have been impossible to wear
them in a blizzard when feet were getting badly frost-bitten even
in finnesko. A slip on the ice meant very serious danger of
destruction.</p>
<p>"A slight decrease in the wind at the close of the third day
gave me hope of getting up to the tent, and I prepared to move by
putting on my outdoor clothing, no easy task in a sleeping-bag;
then, rolling over on my side, I tried to get out. I found that
there was less wind and less drift, and that I was able for the
first time to see where I was with regard to surrounding objects.
I was unable, however, to get out of the bag without being blown
further down the slippery glacier, and I could see that it would
be impossible to crawl up the slopes with the cumbrous bag. If I
lost the bag I might as well have let myself slide."</p>
<p>About two hours after this Marston ventured forth from the
tent in one of the remarkable intervals of calm occasionally
experienced in the course of an Antarctic blizzard. On either
side of the spot on which the camp had been pitched he could see
the drift flying along with the full force of the wind, but he
was able to make his way down to Priestley before the blizzard
swept down on them again. They dragged the bag up the glacier by
kneeling on it and jerking it along, and both got into the tent.
"Four men in a three-men tent is a big squeeze," continued
Priestley, "but five was fearful, and it was some time before I
managed to get even sitting room. The first thing to do was to
examine and attend frost-bitten feet, and the examination showed
as big a crop as could be expected, for Marston and I each had
both feet frost-bitten. A course of massage brought them round,
and I got into Marston's bag while he made tea. . . . After tea I
got into my own bag and lay down on top of Murray and Marston,
and by dint of much wriggling we managed to get fairly settled,
though our positions were so cramped that sleep was
impossible.</p>
<p>"At about half-past four in the morning we cooked some
pemmican in the tent and had a proper breakfast, as for the first
time the wind had really begun to die away. Owing to the cold,
the long period of semi-starvation in our cramped quarters, and
the fact that oil had got mixed up with the food, we were unable
to do justice either to the hoosh or to the cocoa which followed
it, and were still fairly empty when the drift ceased and we
turned out to face the blizzard, pack the sledge and start for
home. The ascent of the mountain had, of course, to be abandoned.
I put on my damp finnesko and went out to help, but in less than
five minutes, though the temperature was plus 22° Fahr., I was
back in the tent with the front portions of both feet frozen, and
we took half an hour to bring them round by beating, massaging
and rubbing with snow. This latter remedy, Marston's favourite,
is a very drastic one, and as painful as any I know, for the
Antarctic snow is invariably in small sharp crystals, very
brittle and hard. We all chafed very much at the unavoidable
delay, as there was every sign of a renewal of the blizzard and
the drift, but fortunately we got under way before any drift
rose, and the wind was rather in our favour. We left all the
provisions there, and unanimously named the nunatak 'Misery
Nunatak', and we were about as glad to leave the place as a soul
would be to leave purgatory. We also left a tin of biscuits and
some oil with a view to a future attempt at an ascent, to be made
by Murray, Day, Marston and Joyce.</p>

<p align="center"><small>14. A HAUL OF FISH</small></p>
<p>"There was a remarkable contrast between the windswept surface
of the glacier and the surface over which we had toilsomely
dragged the sledges during our day's journey outward. Instead of
a uniform carpet, six inches deep, of soft snow, varied with
drifts up to one's knees, we found patches of glacier ice, larger
stretches of névé, and hard drifts of snow, on which neither our
weight nor the weight of the sledge made the slightest
impression; these drifts were deeply undercut on the south-east
side, and were frequently a foot to eighteen inches in height. It
was no easy matter to direct the sledge across the strong wind
then blowing, although we had two men pulling and two others
guiding the sledge, and we ascended about half a mile to the
north of Horseshoe Bay in what was, for a long time, totally
unfamiliar country, and through a series of moraines which had
not yet been explored. I was, unfortunately, of no use in the
pulling, being only just able to get along myself, and we were
all extremely glad to get the sledge to the Back Door Bay end of
Blue Lake, where it was left till the next day. We reached the
hut and started on a course of feeding and recuperating, having
been five days out."</p>
<p>Mount Erebus was noticed to be in eruption when the party was
marching back to the hut on November 27. Huge diverging columns
of steam were rising from the crater, and behind could be seen
curious clouds of feathery cirrus. The temperature during the
blizzard had not fallen below 12° Fahr., and been above 20° Fahr.
during most of the time, so that the frost-bites sustained by the
men must have been due mainly to lowered vitality, caused by the
cramped situation and the lack of hot food.</p>
<p>The experience had been rather a severe one, but the men were
none the worse for it after a day or two at the winter quarters,
and they commenced at once to make preparations for the western
journey. I had left instructions that on December 1 Armytage,
Priestley and Brocklehurst should start for Butter Point with 600
lb. of stores in order to lay a depôt for the Northern Party
which might be expected to reach that point on its journey back
from the Magnetic Pole. Then the three men were to secure what
stores they required for their own purposes, and proceed up the
Ferrar Glacier as far as the Depôt Nunatak in order that
Priestley might search for fossils in the sandstones of the
western mountains. They were to get back to Butter Point early in
January in order to meet Professor David, Mawson and Mackay, and
if a junction was effected, Mawson, Priestley and Brocklehurst
were to carry on geological work in Dry Valley and the
surrounding country, while Professor David, Armytage and Mackay
were to return to the winter quarters. The fact that the Northern
Party did not arrive upset this arrangement to some extent, but
the other three men did some very useful work. The mountains to
the west of McMurdo Sound had been explored by Lieutenant
Armytage and Captain Scott during the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition, Armitage having climbed the mountains and penetrated
west to an altitude of 9000 ft. on the ice-cap, while Scott had
reached longitude 146° 33' East, on the western plateaux. Further
information was required, however, in regard to the geology of
the mountains.</p>
<p>Armytage, Priestley and Brocklehurst accordingly left the
winter quarters on December 1, taking with them about 1200 lb. of
gear and stores. The motor-car carried them for the first sixteen
miles, although the sea ice was by this time in a very bad
condition. The season was well advanced, the sun was above the
horizon all the time, and there were cracks and pools in all
directions. Day and Marston took the car out, and when they were
coming back after leaving the Western Party the car got stuck
firmly in a crack that ran across the course. They spent two
hours cutting away the ice sufficiently to get the car out, and
then had to make a <i>détour</i> of five miles in order to get
round the crack. This was the last journey of the car in the
Antarctic, for it was laid up when it got back to the hut.</p>
<p>The Western Party, after some heavy sledging, camped on
December 4 at the foot of the Ferrar Glacier. Armytage was, at
this time, suffering from an attack of snow-blindness. Priestley
found moss and a species of fungus at the stranded moraines and
also some kenyte. The men had been looking forward with
pleasurable anticipation to securing skuas' eggs, which would
have been a welcome change from pemmican and biscuit, but the
birds had apparently not begun to lay and no eggs were secured.
"A good deal of water denudation and transportation is taking
place along the sea-cliffs of these moraines", wrote Priestley in
his diary. "Quite a thick alluvial deposit, bearing a strong
resemblance to a series of miniature deltas, is to be seen along
the ice-foot awaiting the breaking up of the ice and its removal
to the sea. The dust from the moraines had made a remarkable
surface for two miles this side of them. Some winds had evidently
been strong enough to remove a considerable quantity of the
gravel with the snow, and the drifts which had contained this
gravel had melted away, undercutting the edges of the cleaner
snowdrifts, and thus giving a surface of bare ice with patchy
snowdrifts undercut on all sides."</p>
<p>The party reached Butter Point, about thirty-five miles as the
crow flies from the winter quarters, on December 5, and found a
small depôt left there by the Northern Party on its way to the
Magnetic Pole. Professor David and his companions had placed some
final letters in a milk-tin. The stores brought for the purpose
were placed at the depôt, and then Armytage, Priestley and
Brocklehurst proceeded back to the winter quarters, arriving
there on December 7 at 11.30 p.m. On December 9 they started for
Butter Point again, taking five weeks' provisions for three men,
in order to proceed up the Ferrar Glacier, and later to try to
effect a junction with the Northern Party.</p>
<p>Only five men&mdash;Murray, Joyce, Day, Marston and
Roberts&mdash;were now at the winter quarters. The heat of the
Antarctic summer being at its height, the snowdrifts were melting
rapidly, and the trickling of running water was everywhere to be
heard. A large drift remained on the hill behind the hut, leading
up to Mawson's anemometer. On December 1 it was melting in
several little trickles, and next day it was found that one of
these had got under the hut and made a pool about a foot in depth
at the lower end. Many valuable things were stored under the hut,
and the only opening was occupied by the pool of water. A hole
had to be made at one side of the house, where the ground was
higher, and into this Joyce crawled and spent some hours
wriggling about in a space hardly more than one foot in height,
rescuing valuable boxes of printing material and printed
matter.</p>
<p>In the succeeding days the men at the hut had an illustration
of the contrasts which the Antarctic climate presents. The heat
of the sun melted the snow, and indeed made the weather
oppressively warm, yet the water which ran below the house where
the sunshine could not penetrate and the air temperature never
rose above 32° Fahr., froze at night and never thawed again, so
that the water each day added a layer to the accumulation beneath
the hut, till it reached nearly up to the floor.</p>
<p>After the final departure of the Western Party on December 9,
life at the winter quarters was uneventful until the arrival of
the <i>Nimrod</i>. The members of the expedition remaining at
Cape Royds were busy collecting skua eggs, preparing skins,
carrying on the routine scientific observations, and watching the
doings of the Adelie penguins. Many photographs were taken,
especially by Day, of penguins in every variety of attitude, and
of other subjects of interest. Experiments were made in
photographing microscopic animals, and many pictures of them from
life were obtained.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>RETURN OF THE <i>NIMROD</i></h3>
<p><b>AFTER</b> leaving us on February 22, the <i>Nimrod</i> had
an uneventful voyage back to New Zealand. Fair winds were
encountered all the way, and the ice gave no difficulty, the
coast of New Zealand being sighted twelve days after the
departure from Cape Royds. During the winter the <i>Nimrod</i>
had been laid up in Port Lyttelton waiting till the time arrived
to bring us back to civilisation. The little ship had been docked
and thoroughly overhauled, so that all effects of the severe
treatment she received during the first voyage down to the ice
had been removed, and she was once more ready to battle with the
floes. Towards the end of the year stores were taken on board,
for there was a possibility that a party might have to spend a
second winter at Cape Royds, if the men comprising one of the
sledging expeditions had not returned, and, of course, there was
always the possibility of the <i>Nimrod</i> herself being caught
in the ice and frozen in for the winter. Sufficient stores were
taken on board to provide for any such eventualities, and as much
coal as could be stowed away was also carried. Captain P. F.
Evans, who had commanded the <i>Koonya</i> at the time she towed
the <i>Nimrod</i> down to the Antarctic Circle, was appointed
master of the <i>Nimrod</i> under my power of attorney. Captain
England having resigned on account of ill-health after reaching
New Zealand earlier in the year.</p>
<p>The <i>Nimrod</i> left Lyttelton on December 1, 1908, and
encountered fine weather for the voyage southwards. On the
evening of the 3rd, the wind being favourable, the propeller was
disconnected, and the vessel proceeded under sail alone until the
20th, when she was in latitude 66° 30' South, longitude 178° 28'
West. The "blink" of ice was seen ahead and the ship was hove to
until steam had been raised and the propeller connected. Then
Captain Evans set sail again, and proceeded towards the pack. The
vessel was soon in brash ice, and after pushing through this for
a couple of hours reached the pack, and made her way slowly
through the lanes. Numerous seals were basking on the floes,
regarding the ship with their usual air of mild astonishment. On
the following day the pack was more congested, and the progress
southward was slow, so much so that the crew found time to kill
and skin several crabeater seals. Open water was reached again
that evening, and at noon on the 22nd the <i>Nimrod</i> was in
latitude 68° 20' South, longitude 175° 23' East, and proceeding
under sail through the open water of Ross Sea. The belt of
pack-ice had been about sixty miles wide.</p>
<p>On December 26 the <i>Nimrod</i> reached latitude 70° 42'
South, longitude 173° 4' West, the position, in which, in 1843,
Sir James Ross sighted "compact, hummocky ice", but found only
drift ice, with plenty of open water. A sounding gave no bottom
with 1575 fathoms of wire, so that the theory that the ice seen
by Ross was resting on land was completely disproved. At noon on
the 27th the <i>Nimrod</i>, which was proceeding in a south-east
direction, was brought up by thick floes in latitude 72° 8'
South, longitude 173° 1' West. Progress became possible again
later in the day, and at four o'clock on the following morning
the <i>Nimrod</i> was in open water, with the blink of pack to
the eastward. Captain Evans had kept east with the hope of
sighting King Edward VII Land, but the pack seemed to be
continuous in that direction, and on the 30th he therefore shaped
a course for Cape Bird, and on January 1, 1909, Mount Erebus was
sighted. The experience of Captain Evans on this voyage confirms
my own impression that, under normal conditions, the pack that
stretches out from the Barrier to the eastward of the Ross Sea is
not penetrable, and that the <i>Discovery</i> was able to push to
within sight of King Edward VII Land in 1902 for the reason that
the ice was unusually open that season.</p>
<p>The progress of the <i>Nimrod</i> towards the winter quarters
was blocked by ice off Beaufort Island, and after manoeuvring
about for three hours Captain Evans made the vessel fast to a
floe with ice anchors. The next morning he cast off from the
floe, and with the help of the current, which seems to set
constantly to the west between Cape Bird and Beaufort Island, and
by taking advantage of lanes of open water, gradually proceeded
in two days to a point only twenty-eight miles from Cape Royds.
Some heavy bumps against the floes tested the strength of the
vessel, and finally what appeared to be fast ice was encountered,
so that no further progress towards the south was possible for
the time.</p>

<p align="center"><small>16. VIEW FROM HIGH HILL AFTER SECOND
ARRIVAL OF THE <i>NIMROD</i>. THE SHIP IN LOOSE PACK</small></p>
<p>There seemed to be no immediate possibility of the
<i>Nimrod</i> reaching Cape Royds, and Captain Evans therefore
decided to send Mackintosh with three men to convey a mailbag and
the news of the ship's arrival to the winter quarters. The party
was to travel over the sea ice with a sledge, and it did not seem
that there would be any great difficulties to be encountered. A
start was made at 10.15 a.m. on January 3, the party consisting
of Mackintosh, McGillan, Riches and Paton, with one sledge, a
tent, sleeping-bags, cooking equipment and a supply of
provisions. The distance to be covered was about twenty-five
miles. In the afternoon Mackintosh sent Riches and Paton back to
the ship), and he reduced the load on the sledge by leaving fifty
pounds of provisions in a depôt. The travelling became very
rough, the two men encountering both bad ice and soft snow. They
camped at 7.50 p.m., and started for Cape Royds again at 1.55
a.m. on the following day. They soon got on to a better surface,
and made good progress until 5.30 a.m., when they met with open
water, with pressure ice floating past. This blocked the way.
They walked for two hours in a westerly direction to see how far
the open water extended, but did not reach the end of it. The
whole of the ice to the southward seemed to be moving, and the
stream at the spot at which they were then standing was
travelling at the rate of about three miles an hour. They
breakfasted at 7.30 a.m., and then started back for the ship, as
there seemed to be no chance of reaching Cape Royds in
consequence of the open water.</p>
<p>Presently Mackintosh found that there was open water ahead,
blocking the way to the ship, and a survey of the position from a
hummock revealed the unpleasant fact that the floe-ice was
breaking up altogether, and that they were in most serious danger
of drifting out into the sound. Safety lay in a hurried dash for
the shore to the east, and they proceeded to drag their sledge
across rough ice and deep snow with all possible speed. At places
they had to lift the sledge bodily over the ice-faces, and when,
after an hour's very heavy work, they arrived off the first point
of land, they found an open lane of water barring their way. "We
dragged on to the next point, which appeared to be safe", wrote
Mackintosh in his diary. "The floes were small and square in
shape. Every two hundred yards we had to drag our sledge to the
edge of a floe, jump over a lane of water, and then with a big
effort pull the sledge after us. After an hour of this kind of
work our hands were cut and bleeding, and our clothes, which, of
course, froze as stiff as boards, had been wet through to the
waist, for we had frequently slipped and fallen when crossing
from floe to floe. At 2.30 p.m. we were near to the land, and
came to a piece of glacier ice that formed a bridge. The floe
that we were on was moving rapidly, so we had to make a great
effort and drag our sledge over a six-foot breach. Our luck was
in, and we pulled our sledge a little way up the face of the fast
ice, and unpacked it. We were in a safe position again, and none
too soon, for fifteen minutes later there was open water where we
had gained the land."</p>
<p>Mackintosh decided to go into camp near the spot where they
had landed, as a journey across the rocks and the glaciers of the
coast was not a thing to be undertaken lightly, and would
probably be impossible unless the mailbag was left behind.
McGillan, moreover, had developed snow-blindness, and both men
were very tired. I will quote from Mackintosh's report on the
subsequent experience of this little party.</p>
<p>"Early the next morning I found McGillan in great pain", wrote
Mackintosh. "His eyes were closed up completely, and his face was
terribly swollen. The only remedy I could apply was to bathe
them, and this seemed to give him some relief. From an elevated
position I had a good look round for the ship, and could not see
a trace of her. As the day wore on my own eyes became painful. I
fervently hoped I was not going to be as bad as my companion, for
we would then be in a very difficult position. The morning of
January 6 found us both blind. McGillan's face was frightfully
swollen, and his eyes completely and tightly shut, so that he did
not know that I was attacked too. At first I refrained from
telling him, but the pain was very severe, and I had to tell him.
By the painful process of forcing my eyelids apart with my
lingers I could see a little, but I was not able to do this for
long. I continued to bathe McGillan's eyes, and then suffered six
hours' agony ending in a good long sleep, from which I awoke
refreshed and much better. I was able to see without effort.
McGillan was also much better, and our relief, after the anxiety
we had felt, was very great. By midnight we had improved so much
that we walked to the penguin rookery, where we had great fun
with the birds and found several eggs."</p>
<p>The men stayed in camp for several days, seeing no sign of the
ship, and after their eyes were better spent a good deal of time
studying the neighbourhood and especially the bird life. They cut
down their food to two meals a day, as their supply of food was
not large. Finally, Mackintosh decided that he would leave the
mailbag in the tent, it being too heavy to carry for any
distance, and march into Cape Royds. They made a start on the
morning of January 11, carrying forty pounds each, including food
for three meals, and expected to be able to reach the winter
quarters within twenty-four hours. The first portion of the
journey lay over hills of basaltic rock, at the base of Mount
Bird, and they thought it best to get as high as possible in
order to avoid the valleys and glaciers. They went up about five
thousand feet, and had fairly easy travelling over slopes until
they got well on to the glaciers. Then their troubles commenced.
They were wearing ski-boots without spikes, and had many heavy
falls on the slippery ice. "We were walking along, each picking
his own tracks, and were about fifty yards apart, foolishly not
roped, when I happened to look round to speak to my companion,
and found that he had disappeared", wrote Mackintosh. "Suddenly I
heard my name called faintly from the bowels of the glacier, and
immediately rushed towards the place from which the sound
proceeded. I found McGillan in a yawning chasm, many feet beneath
me, and held up on a projection of ice. I took off my straps from
my pack and to them tied my waist lashing, and lowered this
extemporised rope down to him. It just reached his hand, and with
much pulling on my part and knee-climbing on his, he got safely
to the surface of the glacier again. The Primus stove and our
supply of food had gone further down the crevasse. We tried to
hook them up, and in doing so I lost my straps and line which I
had attached to a ski-stick, so we were left almost without
equipment. As soon as McGillan had recovered from the shock he
had received we started off again, with the spare strap tying the
two of us together. We crossed over many snow-bridges that
covered the dangers underneath, but soon we were in a perfect
hotbed of crevasses. They were impassable and lay right across
our path, so that we could look down into awful depths. We turned
and climbed higher in order to get a clear passage round the top.
We were roped together and I was in the lead, with McGillan
behind, so that when I fell, as I often did, up to my waist in a
crevasse, he could pull me out again. We found a better surface
higher up, but when we began to descend we again got into
crevassed regions. At first the crevasses were ice-covered gaps,
but later we came to huge open ones, whose yawning depths made us
shudder. It was not possible to cross them. We started to ascend
again, and soon came to a bridge of ice across a huge crevasse
about twenty feet wide. We lashed up tighter, and I went off in
the lead, straddle-legged across the narrow bridge. We both
reached the other side in safety, but one slip, or the breaking
of the bridge would have precipitated us into those black depths
below."</p>
<p>The two men found their way blocked by crevasses in whichever
direction they turned, and at last reached a point from which
ascent was out of the question, while below lay a steep slope
running down for about three thousand feet. They could not tell
what lay at the bottom of the slope, but their case was
desperate, and they decided to glissade down. Their knives, which
they attempted to use as brakes, were torn from their grasp, but
they managed to keep their heels in the snow, and although they
passed crevasses, none lay directly in their path. They reached
the bottom in safety at 4 p.m. on the 11th. They were very hungry
and had practically no food, but they could get forward now, and
at 6 p.m. they could see Cape Royds and were travelling over a
smooth surface. They ate a few biscuit crumbs and half a tin of
condensed milk, the only other food they had being a little
chocolate. Soon snow commenced to fall, and the weather became
thick, obscuring their view of the Cape. They could not see two
yards ahead, and for two hours they stumbled along in blinding
snow. They rested for a few minutes, but their clothes were
covered with ice, icicles hung from their faces, and the
temperature was very low. In a temporary clearing of the blizzard
Mackintosh thought that he could make out the Cape and they
dashed off, but at lunchtime on the 12th they were still
wandering over the rocks and snow, heavy snow cutting off all
view of the surrounding country. Soon after this the snow ceased
to fall, though the drift-snow, borne along by the blizzard wind,
still made the weather thick. Several times they thought that
they saw Cape Royds, but found that they had been mistaken. As a
matter of fact they were quite close to the winter quarters when,
at about 7 p.m., they were found by Day. They were in a state of
complete exhaustion, and were just managing to stagger along
because they knew that to stop meant death. Within a few minutes
they were in the hut, where warm food, dry clothes and a good
rest soon restored them. They had a narrow escape from death, and
would probably have never reached the hut had not Day happened to
be outside watching for the return of the ship.</p>

<p align="center"><small>18. BLUFF DEPOT PARTY ON THE

<p>Mackintosh and McGillan reached the hut on January 12, but in
the meantime the <i>Nimrod</i> had arrived at Cape Royds and had
gone north again in search of the missing men. Murray had sailed
in the <i>Nimrod</i>, and as events turned out, he was not able
to get back to the hut for about ten days. "We were having tea on
the afternoon of January 5, and Marston happening to open the
door, there was the <i>Nimrod</i> already moored to the edge of
the fast ice, not more than a mile away", wrote Murray in a
report on the summer work. "We ran towards the ship, over the
rotten sea ice, in boots or slippers as chanced, with the one
idea that is uppermost in these circumstances&mdash;to get
'letters from home'. We were doomed to disappointment. Before we
had finished greeting our old friends, the officers asked us,
'Has Mackintosh arrived?' and we learned to our horror that he
and a companion had left the ship two days before and thirty
miles north of Cape Royds, to try to bring the letters sooner to
us over the sea ice, over the bay where only a few days ago we
saw a broad sheet of open water to the horizon, and which was
even now only filled with loose pack! So we got no home letters,
and had good reason to believe that our friends had lost their
lives in the endeavour to bring them. We knew that they must have
embarked on a large floe, and little expected to see them again.
On January 7 the <i>Nimrod</i> left Cape Royds to seek for the
lost men, on the chance that they might have got ashore near Cape
Bird. Within a few hours she was caught by the pack which was
drifting rapidly southward along the shore of Ross Island. Driven
almost on shore near Horseshoe Bay, the ship, by dint of hard
steaming, got a little way off the land, and was there beset by
the ice and so remained from the 7th to the 15th, with only a few
hours' ineffectual steaming during the first day or two. At
length she was rigidly jammed and was carried helplessly by a
great eddy of the pack away towards the western side of the
sound, and gradually northward.</p>
<p>"On January 12 she was as tight as though frozen in for the
winter. In the afternoon sudden pressure affected all the ice
from the <i>Nimrod</i> as far as we could see. Great blocks of
ice, six or eight feet in thickness, were tossed and piled on the
surface of the floes. These pressure heaps were formed on each
side of the ship's bow, but she took no harm, and in about an
hour the pressure ceased. On the morning of January 15 there was
not the slightest sign of slacking of the pack, but in the early
afternoon Harbord, from the crow's-nest, saw lanes of water at no
great distance to the east. Steam was got up and in a few hours
we had left our prison and got into a broad lane, with only thin
ice which the ship could charge, and the open water was in sight.
Shortly after midnight we got clear of the ice. When released we
were not very far from the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier.</p>
<p>"The deceptive appearance of loose pack was impressed upon us.
For many hours there was blue water apparently only a mile or two
ahead, but it never appeared to get any nearer for hours, and we
could not be sure it was really near till we were within a few
hundred yards of the edge. All this tune in the pack we were in
doubt as to the fate of Mackintosh, or rather, we had not much
doubt about it, for we had given him up for lost, but we were
helpless to do anything. On the afternoon of the 16th, on which
day we cleared the ice, we had passed Beauford Island and were
approaching through very loose pack the only piece of shore on
which there was any chance of finding the lost men. Near the end
of this stretch of beach, where it is succeeded by hopeless
cliffs, a small patch of greenish colour was seen, and the
telescope showed the details of a deserted camp, a tent torn to
ribbons and all the camp gear lying around. A boat was sent
ashore in charge of Davis, who found the bag of letters, and a
note from Mackintosh pinned to the tent, telling of his risky
attempt to cross the mountains nearly a week before. Knowing the
frightfully crevassed character of the valley between Mount Bird
and Mount Erebus, there seemed to us little hope that they would
get through. The crevassed slope extends right to the top of
Mount Bird, and is very steep towards the Erebus side. When we
reached Cape Royds about midnight, only two men came out to meet
the ship. One of the men was Mackintosh's comrade in all his
adventures, and we soon learned that all had ended well."</p>
<p>In the meantime the Bluff Depôt party had started off to place
a supply of provisions off Minna Bluff in readiness for the
return of the Southern Party. The crew of the <i>Nimrod</i>
proceeded to take on board the geological and zoological
specimens collected by the expedition and stored at the hut, so
that all might be in readiness for the final departure when the
parties had been picked up. Then followed weeks of uncertainty as
to the fate of the men who were away.</p>

<h3>THE BLUFF DEPÔT JOURNEY</h3>
<p><b>I HAD</b> left instructions at the winter quarters that a
party should proceed to Minna Bluff at the beginning of the new
year, and place at a point opposite the Bluff a depôt of stores
for the use of the Southern Party on its return journey. Joyce
was to take charge of this work, and it was of very considerable
importance, since we four of the Southern Party would be
depending on the depôt to supply us with the provisions necessary
for the last hundred miles or so of the journey back to the
winter (quarters. Joyce was accompanied by Mackintosh, Day and
Marston, and he found that as the snow surface was very soft it
would be necessary to make two journeys to the Bluff, one with
ordinary sledging provisions, and the other with special luxuries
from the ship. The party left the winter quarters at Cape Royds
on January 15, with one sledge and 500 lb. of provisions, drawn
by eight dogs. Early in the afternoon they encountered soft ice,
sticky with salt, and the travelling became very heavy. They kept
well away from the land, but Joyce, Mackintosh and Marston all
fell through at different times, the soft surface giving away
under them, and they got wet up to their waists. Their clothing
froze stiff at once. They camped for the night at Glacier Tongue,
and the next morning found the weather so bad that they were
unable to march. There was a strong southerly wind, with drift,
and this soon turned into a howling blizzard. A calm succeeded at
midnight, and on the morning of the 18th they got under way
again. The dogs had been buried under the drift by the blizzard,
only their noses showing at the surface, and it was necessary to
dig them out before they could be harnessed up. A seven-foot
sledge was loaded with 300 lb. of store from the depôt at the
Tongue, and the four men took on the two sledges, with a total
weight of 800 lb. They had a heavy day's work, over soft ice and
snowdrift, but reached the old <i>Discovery</i> winter quarters
at Hut Point at midnight. The dogs pulled very well, and seemed
to be enjoying their work after the long spell of semi-idleness
at Cape Royds.</p>

<p align="center"><small>21. THE BLUFF DEPOT</small></p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th the party proceeded on to the
Barrier. The surface was fairly good, and the dogs ran
practically all the time, Joyce finding it necessary to put two
men on the sledge in order to reduce the speed, for the men would
not travel at the pace set by the dogs. The weight per dog was
well over 100 lb., though only one sledge had been taken on from
Hut Point. The temperature was low during the days that followed,
and the men's beards were constantly coated with ice, but their
progress was rapid. On January 23, when they were travelling over
a deep snow surface covering sastrugi, they sighted a depôt about
three miles to the west of their course. This was the depôt at
which some pony fodder had been left in the spring. Soon after
this the party came upon crevasses running at right angles to
their course, and the travelling became difficult. Joyce had the
members of the party roped together, as the crevasses were hidden
by treacherous snow lids and were therefore dangerous. The
crevasses became worse in the following two days. Some of the
pressure ridges were over thirty feet in height, running in an
east-south-east and west-north-west direction, with enormous
crevasses between them, and they all had the experience of
falling through, to be hauled out again by means of the rope,
after they had dropped to the length of their harness with a
heavy jerk. On one occasion the four centre dogs fell through a
snow lid into a crevasse, and were got out with great difficulty.
Day and Joyce, with two leaders, were on one side of the
crevasse, and Mackintosh and Marston, with the two rear dogs,
were on the other side. Day and Joyce had to unharness and ease
the dogs, while the other two men pulled them back to the sledge.
The dogs meanwhile were hanging over the abyss, and evidently did
not like their position. Joyce had to keep altering his course in
order to avoid these crevasses, but after steering in a
south-west direction for about six hours he reached a better
surface. The crevasses were getting smaller, although the surface
of névé caused many falls. An attempt to steer south, straight
for the spot at which the depôt was to be laid, resulted in the
party getting into the badly crevassed area again, and once more
Joyce had to steer east-south-east. Finally they got clear of the
crevasses, and at midnight on January 2.5, reached the spot at
which it had been decided to place the depôt, about fourteen
miles off Minna Bluff.</p>
<p>An early start was made on the 26th, and for seven hours the
party laboured erecting a mound of snow ten feet high. On top of
the mound they put two eleven-foot bamboos, lashed together and
carrying three black flags. The total height of the depôt was
twenty-two feet, and it could be seen at a distance of eight
miles. The bearing of this depôt I had arranged with Joyce during
the spring depôt journey, before my departure for the southern
journey. It was on a line drawn through a sharp peak on the
Bluff, well-known to Joyce, and the top of Mount Discovery, with
a cross bearing secured by getting the centre peak of White
Island in line with a peak of Mount Erebus.</p>
<p>The party started north again on the morning of the 27th, and
after they had travelled a short distance Day sighted a pole
projecting from the snow, some distance to the west of their
course. Joyce was able to identify this as the depôt laid out for
the <i>Discovery</i>'s Southern Party in the spring of 1902.
There was a bamboo pole about eight feet high projecting from the
snow, with a tattered flag attached to it, and a food tin on top.
The guys to which the pole was attached were completely buried
under the snow. The men dug down for about five feet with the
idea of ascertaining how deeply the depôt had been covered by
snow, but as the bottom had not been reached and time was
limited, they put fresh flags on the pole and proceeded on their
way, intending to visit the depôt on the second journey. A fresh
southerly wind was blowing, and rapid progress was made to the
north towards Cape Crozier. A sail was hoisted on the sledge, and
this assisted the dogs so much that three men were able to sit on
the sledge, while a pace of about four miles an hour was
maintained. Soon the area of crevasses, caused by the impinging
of the Barrier ice on the land to the west, was reached again,
and for thirty-seven miles the party twisted and turned in making
a course past the obstacles; Joyce counted the crevasses that
were passed, and he reported that he had seen one hundred and
twenty-seven, ranging from two feet to thirty feet in width. The
larger ones were open, and therefore easily detected, but the
smaller ones had the usual snow lids. On the 30th the men were
held up by another blizzard, which completely buried the dogs and
sledge, but they reached Hut Point at 11 p.m. on January 31.</p>
<p>A second load of stores was secured from the depôt, including
some luxuries, such as apples and fresh mutton, brought by a
party from the ship, and on February 2 the party started south
again. Joyce decided to take a new course in order to avoid the
crevasses. He kept a course towards Cape Crozier for two days,
and then marched south on the 5th and reached the depôt without
having seen any crevasses at all. I think that the crevasses run
right across to Cape Crozier from the district around White
Island, but they are evidently more snow covered along the outer
course. When the party was close to the depôt a blizzard came up
from the south, and there was just time to get the tents up
before the drift became thick. The tents were completely snowed
up before the weather cleared, and the men had some difficulty in
getting out again. The dogs were covered, but they seemed to be
quite happy in their "nests" deep in the drift. When dogs and
sledge had been dug out the party started again, and at 2 a.m. on
the 8th they reached the Bluff depôt for the second time.</p>

<p align="center"><small>B. THE DEPOT PARTY AMONGST
CREVASSES</small></p>
<p>"We expected to find the Southern Party camped there, and to
surprise them with the luxuries we had brought out for them,"
wrote Joyce in his report, "but they were not there. As our
orders were to return on the 10th if the Southern Party did not
turn up, we began to feel rather uneasy. It came on to blow again
from the south, and presently the wind turned into a howling
blizzard, and did not ease down until the 11th. During every lull
we climbed the depôt and looked round the horizon with the
glasses, expecting every minute to see the Southern Party loom up
out of the whiteness, but they did not appear. On the 11th, after
a consultation, we decided to lay depôt flags in towards the
Bluff, so that there would be no chance of the other party
missing the food depôt. We knew that they would be run out of
provisions, as they were then eleven days overdue, and the
position caused us great anxiety. After we had laid the flags,
three miles and a half apart, with directions where to find the
depôt, we decided to march due south to look for the Southern
Party. At every rest we would get on the sledge with the glasses,
and look around, thinking that each snow hummock was a man or a
tent. On the 13th Day sighted some marks in the snow that looked
unusual, and on examination we found them to be the hoofprints of
the ponies, evidently made on the outward march of the Southern
Party three months before. The tracks of the four sledges showed
distinctly. We followed these tracks for seven hours, and then we
lost them. We camped that night at 10 p.m., and early the next
morning proceeded south again, thinking all the time that we
would see something appear out of the loneliness. It is curious
what things one can see in circumstances like these, especially
with a bad light. We started back to the depôt with all sorts of
fears for the Southern Party."</p>
<p>They reached the depôt again at noon on the 16th, and Joyce
states that as they approached the mound they were all sure that
they could see a tent up and men walking about. When they got
close, however, they found that everything was just as they had
left it. They put all the provisions on top of the mound, lashed
everything securely, and examined the flags to the eastward, and
started on the march back to the coast, full of gloomy thoughts
as to the fate of the Southern Party, which was now eighteen days
overdue.</p>
<p>They proceeded first to the old <i>Discovery</i> depôt found
on the first journey, Joyce wishing to take some measurements in
order to ascertain the movement of the Barrier ice, and the
amount of the snowfall. The depôt had been laid six years
previously on bearings off the Bluff, and after its original
position had been ascertained as exactly as possible, the
distance to the bamboo pole was measured off by Day and Marston
with a forty-foot length of rope, which had been measured off
with a tape measure. The distance was found to be 9600 ft., and
the direction of the movement was about east-north-east. The
Barrier ice at this point must therefore be moving forward at the
rate of about 1500 ft. a year. The party then worked till 1 a.m.
digging down in order to find what depth of snow had been
deposited on top of the depôt during the six years. It was found
that the level at which the stays of the depôt pole had been made
fast was eight feet three inches down in hard compressed snow. A
measured quantity of this snow was melted in order to ascertain
the actual amount of the snowfall. The interesting points
involved in these investigations will be dealt with in the
reports on the scientific work of the expedition.</p>
<p>The party started north again on the following day, and
covered a distance of thirty-three miles. The dogs pulled
splendidly, and three men were able to ride on the sledge. On the
second day crevasses were encountered again, and several times
men fell through to the length of their harness. The general
direction of the crevasses was east-south-east and
west-south-west. The party had a narrow escape from complete
disaster at this stage. "We were going at a good trot over a very
hard surface," wrote Joyce, "when I felt my foot go through. I
called out 'Crack!' and rushed the dogs over, and as the sledge
touched the other side of the hard ridge, the whole snow-bridge
over which we had passed fell in. Marston, who was running astern
of the sledge, felt himself falling through space, but the pace
of the dogs brought him over the crevasse, at the length of his
harness. We found ourselves standing on the edge of a yawning gap
that would easily have swallowed up sledge, dogs, and the whole
party, and on the far side we could see our sledge tracks leading
right up to the edge. It seemed almost a miracle how we had
managed to escape. Day took a photograph, and we altered the
course for Cape Crozier, getting out of the crevasses about 5
p.m. Then we camped for the night, having all had a good shaking
up."</p>

<p>A long march the next day over a good surface brought the
party to Cape Armitage at midnight. Joyce found that the ice in
the sound had gone out, and it was therefore necessary to climb
through the gap at Observation Hill. A blizzard came up, and with
great difficulty the party reached the old <i>Discovery</i> hut
at Hut Point at 2 a.m. The distance covered during the day had
been forty-five miles, an unusually good performance. The surface
had been good, and the wind favourable, and the dogs had pulled
splendidly. Joyce speaks very highly of the work of the dogs on
this journey. They were pulling over 100 lb. per dog, and yet ran
most of the time. They suffered a good deal from snow-blindness,
and then they used to dig a hole in the snow and bury their faces
right in; this method of treatment seemed to ease their eyes and
they recovered from the attacks very quickly. "One day I released
Tripp, because he had a chafed leg," wrote Joyce, "and for the
whole day he ran in his place in the team, as if he had been
harnessed up. He slept about half a mile from camp that night,
and when I tried to coax him over in the morning he would not
come, but as soon as we got under way he came running up to his
old place. I fed the dogs on one pound of biscuit a day each, and
this seemed to satisfy them; as they went on their condition
improved. The dog harness was generally satisfactory, but could
have been improved with a few more swivels, in order to avoid
tangling when the dogs jumped over their traces. I think that all
dog teams should be taught to be driven, as a man cannot keep
pace with dogs, and holding them back in order that a man may go
ahead causes them to get fagged out. If they were let go at their
best pace, one could, with a light load, say 80 lb. per dog, get
forty miles a day out of them over a good surface."</p>

<h3>THE WESTERN JOURNEY</h3>
<p><b>MEANWHILE</b> the Western Party, which had left the winter
quarters for the second time on December 9, had been working in
the western mountains. The three men (Armytage, Priestley and
Brocklehurst) reached the stranded moraines on December 13, and
on this occasion succeeded in securing a large supply of skuas'
eggs. The anticipated feast was not enjoyed, however, for only
about a dozen of the eggs were "good enough for eating", to quote
the words of a member of the party. The other eggs were thrown on
to the snow near the tent, and the result was an invasion of
skuas, which not only ate the eggs, but also made themselves a
general nuisance by pulling about the sledge harness and stores.
At this time the men were troubled by patches of thin ice, about
an eighth to a quarter of an inch thick, forming a lenticle, the
top of the middle being sometimes as much as five or six inches
from the actual surface. When these patches of ice were trodden
on they broke down, and not infrequently disclosed a puddle of
salt water an inch or two deep. Priestley thought that they were
the final product of the thawing of snowdrifts, and owed their
character to the fact that the salt water worked faster from
below than did the sun from above.</p>
<p>On December 15 the party started to ascend the Ferrar Glacier,
Priestley examining the rocks carefully on the way with a view to
securing fossils if any were to be found. The surface was bad for
the most part, soft snow being encountered where ice had been
expected. On December 19 they were held up by a blizzard, and
then they got on to very slippery crevassed ice. On December 20
they camped near the Solitary Rocks, at the spot at which Captain
Scott had camped after leaving Dry Valley. The idea of getting to
Depôt Nunatak had to be abandoned, for a heavy snowfall made the
travelling difficult, and the time at the disposal of the
expedition was short. Priestley worked under the Bluff between
Dry Valley and the east fork of the glacier without success, and
then they moved over to Obelisk Mount. "I have examined block
after block of unfossiliferous-looking sandstone without any
success", wrote Priestley in his diary on the evening of the
21st. "The only thing I can find different from the ordinary
quartz grains are a few seams of conglomerate with quartz
pebbles, and a few lenticles of a soft clayey substance. The
other rock I have collected here is a junction between granite
and porphyry, which is common. The sandstone is very weathered,
dropping to pieces in many cases at a single blow. I am faced
with the necessity of examining for fossils rocks which I should
carefully avoid if I were at home or anywhere else. I have never
seen a sedimentary rock that looked more unfossiliferous. Many of
the boulders are coated with a hard crust of white, opaque salt
(probably calcium carbonate), and if there was ever any lime in
the sandstone it has probably been dissolved out long ago. There
are numerous interesting rocks about here, but I am debarred from
collecting much by the difficulty of transport. . . . There are
evidently serious defects in the map near this point. The whole
of the bluff opposite is marked as Beacon sandstone, and from the
face of the cliff here it is easily seen, for at least 3000 feet,
to be granite; the very grain in the stones can be seen. This
granite is capped by the beacon sandstone on the tops of the
lulls, but the dolerite seems to have died out, with the
exception of the upper flow. This formation is as it should be,
taking into consideration the horizontal structure of the rocks,
and it was the fact that I doubted the existence of Beacon
sandstone so low down the series that brought me here, as much as
the expectation of finding fossils if the mapping should be
correct."</p>

FERRAR GLACIER<br>
ON DECEMBER 18. HEAVY HANGING GLACIERS ON THE HILLS</small></p>
<p>At this time thawing was proceeding rapidly on the glacier.
The party made for the north wall of the glacier, but was stopped
by a precipice of ice, 200 to 300 feet in height, with a stream
of water flowing at its foot. The deeper ripple-cracks and
potholes were filled with water, and water was streaming down the
convex face of the glacier to the stream which was roaring
beneath the ice-face. The scene was a magnificent one, but the
conditions were unpleasant from the point of view of the party.
The ice was separated from the rock at the sides of the glacier
by a thaw-gully about fifty feet deep, with a stream of water
flowing at the bottom. Then came the lateral moraine, which was
still within the region in which the rock-heat was felt, and
formed a depression some three to six feet below the main surface
of the glacier, commencing as an abrupt rise, almost
perpendicular, but somewhat convex. After this came the ordinary
billowy surface, and the next stones met with formed a sub-medial
moraine not sufficiently thick to effect any lowering in the
general level of the surface, although each stone was surrounded
by its own hollow, filled with thaw water. Along the middle
meandered a small stream, a few feet wide, with the bottom of its
channel filled with morainic gravel matter. In the evening
freezing commenced in the potholes that were sheltered from the
rays of the sun. Long needles of ice formed from the small grains
of gravel, and crossed and recrossed in the most beautiful
pattern. In some holes hexagonal plates of ice were being formed
on the surface.</p>
<p>An examination of the Solitary Rocks proved that the map was
incorrect at this point. The previous expedition had thought that
the rocks formed an island, with the glacier flowing down on
either side, but a close examination showed that the rocks were
in reality a peninsula, joined to the main north wall by an
isthmus of granite at least one thousand feet high. The glacier
surged round the peninsula on its way down Dry Valley, and just
below the isthmus was a lake of some size, fed by streams from a
glacier opposite. These streams were yellow with silt, and
another stream, also much discoloured, was running from the lake
down to Dry Valley. The Solitary Rocks are at an altitude of
about two thousand feet above sea-level. Priestley proceeded with
geological and survey work in the neighbourhood of the east fork,
and made an extensive examination of the spots known as Kurki
Hills, Knob Head Mount and Windy Gully. On December 24, close to
the camp, they found the bleached skeleton of a crabeater seal.
It is rather curious that one of these animals should proceed so
far up the glacier. A new camp was pitched at the foot of Knob
Head Mountain, just below the second gully east of Windy Gully,
and here Armytage and Priestley climbed up the slope behind to an
altitude of 4200 ft., finding a yellow lichen at 3100 ft., a
black lichen at 3800 ft. and a green lichen or moss at 4200 ft.
The altitude of the camp was 2470 ft.</p>
<p>Christmas Day was spent at this camp, and, as was the case
with the other sledging expeditions that were out at the time, a
special feast was provided. For breakfast they had hoosh,
sardines in tomato sauce and raisins; for lunch Garibaldi
biscuits and jelly; and for dinner potted boneless chicken and a
small plum pudding. Armytage picked up a piece of sandstone with
fernlike markings, but Priestley was not hopeful of finding
fossils in the greatly altered sandstone. The day was spent in
geological work. "We lose the sun here about 9.30 p.m.", noted
Priestley in his diary "and it is curious to observe the sudden
change from bright light to darkness in the tent, while outside
the thin surface of ice covering the thaw-water round the rocks
immediately contracts with reports like a succession of
pistol-shots, and sometimes breaks up and flies about in all
directions, making a noise like broken glass. This is the effect
of the quick cooling of the ice by the cold plateau wind
immediately the sun's influence is withdrawn. The plum pudding
was 'top hole'. Must remember to give one of the pot-holed
sandstones to Wild for the New Zealand girl who gave him the plum
pudding."</p>
<p>On December 27 the men proceeded down the glacier again in
order to see whether the Northern Party had arrived at Butter
Point. Priestley studied the moraines on the way down, and made
an extensive collection of specimens, and on January 1 they
arrived at the depôt. They had constant trouble with crevasses
and "potholes" on the way down the glacier, but met with no
serious accident. The snow-bridges many times let them through up
to their knees or waists, but never broke away entirely. The
weather was unpleasantly warm for the sort of work they were
undertaking, since the snow was thawing, and they were constantly
wet.</p>
<p>They found no sign of the Northern Party at Butter Point, and
after waiting there until the 6th they proceeded to the "stranded
moraines", a day's trek to the south, in order that geological
specimens might be secured. The moraines, which were found by the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition, and are relics of the days of more
extensive glaciation, present a most varied collection of rocks,
representative of the geological conditions to be found in the
mountains to the west, and are of very great interest on that
account. After spending two days at this spot, the party went
back to Butter Point with about 250 lb. of specimens, and camped
again till the 11th. Still there was no sign of the Northern
Party, and on the 12th they went north to Dry Valley. There
Priestley found a raised beach, about sixty feet above sea-level,
and Brocklehurst climbed the mountain known as the Harbour
Heights.</p>
<p>Numerous fragments of Pecten Colbecki, the shell at present
common at Cape Royds, were found imbedded in the sand as far up
as sixty feet, and Priestley thought that they would probably be
found higher still. Writing of the moraines at this point, he
said: "In their chief characteristics they are very similar to
the stranded moraines. Large patches of gravel are mixed with
boulders of every description and size, a chaos of sedimentary,
volcanic, plutonic, hypabyssal and metamorphic rocks, segmented
by watercourses, which are bordered by flats of gravel and spread
out before reaching the sea over large, alluvial, fan-shaped
mudflats. They differ from the stranded moraines in the presence
of numerous specimens of now existing shells, imbedded in the
gravel and sand of the moraines, but found in most cases under
any steep declivity in a stream's bed where it has cut back
through a gravel terrace. The remarkable part of the preservation
of these shells is their extreme fragility. Of Pecten Colbecki I
have seen thousands of specimens, and have secured many whole
single valves. Of the Anatæna so common at Cape Royds I came
across several patches. At the head of one of the alluvial
mudflats, about two feet above the present level of the sea
water, I secured many dried bodies of a small amphipod and a
dried fish an inch long. The whole of the moraines so far as I
have been are covered with seal bones, and I have seen two whole
dried bodies, with the skin still on. One was a crabeater. Among
several rock specimens secured was one of Beacon sandstone with
the same curious markings as were found on two specimens secured
by Armytage at Knob Head. The impression in the original stone
was exactly as if the body of a wasp-like wingless insect several
inches long had been pressed into clay."</p>

<p>They went back to the depôt on the 14th, and in accordance
with the orders I had left, pitched camp in order to wait for the
Northern Party until the 25th, when they were to make their way
back to winter quarters, or signal for the ship by means of the
heliograph. On January 24-25 this party had a very narrow escape
from disaster. They were camped on the sea-ice at the foot of
Butter Point, intending to move off on the return journey early
on the morning of the 25th. Their position was apparently one of
safety. Armytage had examined the tide-crack along the shore, and
had found no sign of more than ordinary movement, and the ice in
the neighborhood seemed to be quite fast. At 7 a.m. on the 24th
Priestley was first out of the tent, and a few minutes later he
came running back to his companions to tell them that the ice
they were on had broken away and was drifting away north to the
open sea. The other two men turned out promptly, and found that
his statement was only too true. There were two miles of open
water between the floe and the shore, and they were apparently
moving steadily out to sea. "When we found that the ice had gone
out," wrote Armytage in his report to me, "we struck camp, loaded
up the sledge, and started away with the object of seeing whether
we could get off the floe to the north. The position seemed to be
rather serious, for we could not hope to cross any stretch of
open water, there was no reasonable expectation of assistance
from the ship, and most of our food was at Butter Point. We had
not gone very far to the north before we came to an impassible
lane of open water, and we decided to return to our original
position. We went into camp, and had breakfast at 11 a.m. Then we
held a consultation and agreed that it would be best to stop
where we then were for a time, at any rate, on the offchance of
the ship coming along one of the lanes to pick us up on the
following day, or of the current changing and the ice once more
touching the shore. We waited till three o'clock in the
afternoon, but there did not seem to be any improvement in the
position. The Killer whales were spouting in the channels, and
occasionally bumping the ice under us. Then we marched north
again, but met with open water in every direction, and after we
had marched right round the floe we got into camp at the old
position at 10 p.m. We had a small meal of hoosh and biscuit. We
had only four days' provisions on the floe with us, and I decided
that we would have to go on short rations. We were encouraged by
the fact that we had apparently ceased to move north, and were
perhaps getting nearer the fast ice again. We got into our
sleeping-bags in order to keep warm. At 11.30 p.m. Brocklehurst
turned out to see whether the position had changed, and reported
that we seemed to be within a few hundred yards of the fast ice,
and still moving towards the land. I got out of my bag and put on
my finnesko, and at midnight saw that we were very close to the
fast ice, probably not more than two hundred yards away. I ran
back as fast as I could, deciding that there was a prospect of an
attempt to get ashore proving successful, and gave the other two
men a shout. They struck the camp and loaded up within a very few
minutes, while I went back to the edge of the floe at the spot
towards which chance had first directed my steps. Just as the
sledge got up to me, I felt the floe bump the fast ice. Not more
than six feet of the edge touched, but we were just at that spot,
and we rushed over the bridge thus formed. We had only just got
over when the floe moved away again, and this time it went north
to the open sea. The only place at which it touched the fast ice
was that to which I had gone when I left the tent, and had I
happened to go to any other spot we would not have escaped. We
made our way to Butter Point, and at about three o'clock in the
morning camped and had a good meal. Then we turned in and slept.
When we got up for breakfast, there was open water where we had
been drifting on the floe, and I sighted the <i>Nimrod</i> under
sail, ten or twelve miles out. We laid the heliograph on to the
vessel, and after flashing for about an hour got a reply. The
<i>Nimrod</i> came alongside the fast ice at three o'clock in the
afternoon of January 26, and we went on board with our equipment
and specimens. We left a depôt of provisions and oil at Butter
Point in case the Northern Party should reach that point after
our departure."</p>
<p>On January 22 and 23 a fresh wind blew from the south and
commenced to break up the ice-sheet in the neighbourhood of Cape
Royds, compelling the ship to refasten further to the southward.
From this point Davis took a sledge-party to Hut Point with
despatches that the supporting-party was to convey to me at the
Bluff Depôt. On the 25th the ice had broken up to such an extent
that Captain Evans thought there would be a chance of getting far
enough across McMurdo Sound to search the western coastline for
the party that had been exploring the western mountains, and also
for the Northern Party, which might by that time have returned
from the journey to the Magnetic Pole and reached Butter Point.
The <i>Nimrod</i> stood out into the sound, and from a distance
of ten or twelve miles a heliograph was seen twinkling near
Butter Point. The ship was able to get right alongside the fast
ice, and picked up Armytage, Priestley and Brocklehurst.</p>
<p>After this date fine weather was experienced only at short
intervals, the season being advanced, and as a consequence the
fast ice that remained in the sound commenced to break up
rapidly, and took the form of pack trending northwards. When
blizzards blew, as they did frequently, the <i>Nimrod</i> moored
on the lee side of a stranded iceberg in the neighbourhood of
Cape Barne, with the object of preserving her position without
the consumption of more coal than was absolutely necessary. After
the ice had broken up sufficiently, shelter was found under
Glacier Tongue.</p>
<p>The waiting was rather unpleasant for the remaining members of
the shore-party and for those on board the ship, for the time was
approaching when it would be necessary to leave for the north
unless the <i>Nimrod</i> was to be frozen in for the winter, and
two of the parties were still out. I had left instructions that
if the Northern Party had not returned by February 1, a search
was to be made along the western coast in a northerly direction.
The party was three weeks overdue, and on February 1, therefore,
the <i>Nimrod</i> went north, and Captain Evans proceeded to make
a close examination of the coast. The ship did not get back to
the hut until February 11. During this time Murray and Priestley
found work of scientific interest. Priestley tramped the country,
and now that the snow had in great measure disappeared, was
enabled to see various interesting geological deposits previously
covered up. Beds of sponge spicules, enclosing various other
fossils, were evidence of recent elevation of the sea bottom. A
thick deposit of salts was found on a mound between two lakes,
and some curious volcanic formations were discovered. The smaller
ponds were entirely melted, and gave a chance to find some forms
of life not evident in winter. The penguins continued to afford
Murray material for study.</p>
<p>The <i>Nimrod</i>'s search for the Northern Party was both
difficult and dangerous. Captain Evans had to keep close to the
coast, in order to guard against the possibility of overlooking a
signal, which might consist only of a small flag, and the sea was
obstructed by pack-ice. He was to go north as far as a sandy
beach on the northern side of the Drygalski Barrier, and he
performed his duty most thoroughly in the face of what he
afterwards modestly described as "small navigational
difficulties." The beach, which had been marked on the chart, was
found to have no existence in fact, but the <i>Nimrod</i> reached
the neighbourhood indicated, and then proceeded south again,
still searching every yard of the coast. On the 4th a tent was
sighted on the edge of the Barrier, and when a double detonator
was fired the three men who had been to the Magnetic Pole came
tumbling out and ran down towards the edge of the ice. Mawson was
in such a hurry that he fell down a crevasse, and did not get out
again until a party from the ship went to his assistance. "They
were the happiest men I have ever seen", said Davis in describing
the finding of the party. Their sledge, equipment and specimens
were taken on the <i>Nimrod</i>, which was able to moor right
alongside the fast ice, and then Captain Evans proceeded back to
the winter quarters. In the chapters that follow Professor David
tells the story of the Northern Party's journey.</p>

<h3>PROFESSOR DAVID'S NARRATIVE</h3>
<p><b>ON</b> September 19, 1908, Lieutenant Shackleton gave me
his final instructions for the journey of the Northern Party to
the Magnetic Pole. These he read over to me in the presence of
Mawson and Dr. Mackay. The instructions were as follows:</p>
<p align="right"><small>"BRITISH ANTARCTIC EXPEDITION,
1907.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
"CAPE ROYDS, <i>September</i> 19, 1908.</small></p>
<h4>INSTRUCTIONS FOR NORTHERN SLEDGE-PARTY UNDER<br>
COMMAND OF PROFESSOR E. DAVID.</h4>
<p>"DEAR SIR,&mdash;The sledge-party which you have charge of
consists of yourself, Douglas Mawson and Alistair Mackay.</p>
<p>"You will leave winter quarters on or about October 1, 1908.
The main objects of your journey are to be as follows:</p>
<p>"(1) To take magnetic observations at every suitable point
with a view of determining the dip and the position of the
Magnetic Pole. If time permits, and your equipment and supplies
are sufficient, you will try and reach the Magnetic Pole.</p>
<p>"(2) To make a general geological survey of the coast of
Victoria Land. In connection with this work you wall not
sacrifice the time that might be used to carry out the work noted
in paragraph (1). It is unnecessary for me to describe or
instruct you as to details <i>re</i> this work, as you know so
much better than I do what is requisite.</p>
<p>"(3) I particularly wish you to be able to work at the geology
of the Western Mountains, and for Mawson to spend at least one
fortnight at Dry Valley to prospect for minerals of economic
value on your return from the north, and for this work to be
carried out satisfactorily you should return to Dry Valley not
later than the first week of January. I do not wish to limit you
to an exact date for return to Dry Valley if you think that by
lengthening your stay up north you can reach the Magnetic Pole,
but you must not delay, if time is short, on your way south again
to do geological work. I consider that the <i>thorough</i>
investigation of Dry Valley is of supreme importance.</p>
<p>"(4) The <i>Nimrod</i> is expected in the Sound about January
15, 1909. It is quite possible you may see her from the west. If
so, you should try to attract attention by heliograph to winter
quarters. You should choose the hours noon to 1 p.m. to flash
your signal, and if seen at winter quarters the return signal
will be flashed to you, and the <i>Nimrod</i> will steam across
as far as possible to meet you and wait at the ice-edge. If the
ship is not in, and if she is and your signals are not seen, you
will take into account your supply of provisions and proceed
either to Glacier Tongue or Hut Point to replenish if there is
not a sufficient amount of provision at Butter Point for you.</p>
<p>"(5) <i>Re</i> Butter Point. I will have a depôt of at least
fourteen days' food and oil cached there for you. If there is not
enough in that supply you ought to return as mentioned in
paragraph (4).</p>
<p>"(6) I shall leave instructions for the master of the
<i>Nimrod</i> to proceed to the most accessible point at the west
coast and there ship all your specimens. But before doing this,
he must ship all the stores that are lying at winter quarters,
and also keep in touch with the fast ice to the south on the
lookout for the Southern Sledge-party. The Southern Party will
not be expected before February 1, so if the ship arrives in good
time you may have all your work done before our arrival from the
south.</p>

<p>"(7) If by February 1 after the arrival of the <i>Nimrod</i>,
there is no evidence that your party has returned, the
<i>Nimrod</i> all proceed north along the coast, keeping as close
to the land as possible, on the lookout for a signal from you
flashed by heliograph. The vessel will proceed very slowly. The
ship will not go north of Cape Washington. This is a safeguard in
event of any accident occurring to your party.</p>
<p>"(8) I have acquainted both Mawson and Mackay with the main
facts of the proposed journey. In the event of any accident
happening to you, Mawson is to be in charge of the party.</p>

safe return.</p>

one place, taking possession of Victoria Land as part of the

<p>We had a farewell dinner that night, given in honour of the
Southern Depôt Party who were about to start to lay out a depôt
one hundred miles southerly from our winter quarters.</p>
<p>The following day, September 20, a strong south-easterly
blizzard was blowing. In the afternoon the wind somewhat
moderated, and there was less drift. Mackay had been making a
sail for our journey to the Magnetic Pole, and we now tried the
sail on two sledges lashed together on the ice at Backdoor Bay.
We used the tent poles of one of the sledging-tents as a mast.
The wind was blowing very strongly and carried off the two
sledges with a weight on them of 300 lb., in addition to the
weights of Mackay and myself, who were sitting on the sledges. We
considered this a successful experiment.</p>
<p>The weather continued bad till the night of the 24th.</p>
<p>On September 25 we were up at 5.30 a.m., and found that the
blizzard had subsided. Priestley, Day and I started in the
motor-car, dragging behind us two sledges over the sea ice. One
sledge, weighing altogether 606 lb. with its load, contained five
of our fortnightly food-bags, six large tins of biscuits, and 60
lb. of oil. The other sledge, which with its load weighed about
250 lb., carried personal gear which we might have to use on the
depôt laying trip in the event of being surprised by a blizzard.
At first Day travelled on his first gear; he then found that the
engine became heated, and we had to stop for it to cool down. He
discovered while we were waiting that one of the cylinders was
not firing. This he soon fixed up all right. He then remounted
the car and he put her on to the second gear. With the increased
power given by the repaired cylinder we now sped over the
floe-ice at fourteen miles an hour, much to the admiration of the
seals and penguins. When, however, we had travelled about ten
miles from winter quarters, and were some five miles westerly
from Tent Island, we encountered numerous sastrugi of softish
snow, the car continually sticking fast in the ridges. A little
low drift was flying over the ice surface, brought up by a gentle
blizzard. We left the heavy sledge ten miles out, and then with
only the light sledge to draw behind us, Day found that he was
able to travel on his third gear at eighteen miles an hour. At
this speed the sledge, whenever it took one of the snow sastrugi
at right angles, leapt into the air like a flying fish and came
down with a bump on the surface of the ice. As we had
occasionally to make sharp turns in order to avoid sastrugi and
lumps of ice, our sledge had one or two capsizes. Meanwhile, the
blizzard was freshening, and we tore along in hopes of reaching
our winter quarters before it became very violent. We had just
reached Flagstaff Point, and were taking a turn in towards the
shore opposite the penguin rookery when the blizzard wind caught
the side of the sledge nearly broadside on, and capsized it
heavily. So violent was the shock that the aluminium cooking
apparatus was knocked out of its straps, and the blizzard wind
immediately started trundling this metal cylinder over the smooth
ice. Day stopped his car as soon as possible, Priestley and I
jumped off, and immediately gave chase to the runaway cooker.
Meanwhile, the cooker had fallen to pieces so to speak; the tray
part came away from the big circular cover; the melter and the
supports for the cooking-pot and for the main outer covering also
came adrift as well as the cooking-pot itself. The lid of the
last-mentioned fell off, and immediately dumped on to the ice the
three pannikins and our three spoons. These articles raced one
another over the smooth ice-surface in the direction of the open
water of Ross Sea. The spoons were easily captured, as also were
the pannikins, which, being conical in shape, could not be bowled
by the wind in a straight line, but described arcs of circles.
Priestley and I recovered also the cooking-pot, and with
Brocklehurst's help (for he had run down to meet us) the
aluminium supports, but the large snow melter, the main outer
casing, and the tray kept revolving in front of us at a speed
which was just sufficient to outclass our own most desperate
efforts. Finally, when we were nearly upon them, they took a
joyous leap over the low cliff of floe-ice and disappeared one
after another most exasperatingly in the black waters of the Ross
Sea.</p>
<p>This was a shrewd loss, as aluminium cookers were, of course,
very scarce. Priestley and I returned disconsolate, and very much
winded after our mile's run in vain.</p>
<p>The following day we had intended laying out our second depôt,
but as some of the piston rings of the motor-car needed repair,
we decided to postpone the departure until the day after. That
afternoon, after the repairs had been completed, Day and Armytage
went out for a little tobogganing before dinner. Late in the
evening Armytage returned dragging slowly and painfully a sledge
bearing the recumbent, though not inanimate form of Day. We
crowded round to inquire what was the matter, and found that just
when Armytage and Day were urging their wild career down a steep
snow slope Day's foot had struck an unyielding block of kenyte
lava, and the consequence had been very awkward for the foot. It
was severely staved, so that he was quite unable to walk without
assistance. As no one but Day could be trusted to drive the
motor-car, this accident necessitated a further postponement of
the laying of our second depôt.</p>
<p>On September 28 it was blowing. On the 29th the day was fairly
fine, but Day's foot was not well enough for him to start in the
motor-car.</p>
<p>On September 30 a mild blizzard commenced blowing, and on
October 1, the day on which Lieutenant Shackleton had intended
that we should start, it was still raging with increased force.
That day was spent chiefly in nailing strips of tin, painted
blue, on all the geological specimen boxes, and double-labelling
them.</p>
<p>On October 2 the weather was still bad, so that we were unable
to start. On October 3, the weather having cleared. Day,
Priestley, Mackay and I started with two sledges to lay our
second depôt. All went well for about eight miles out, then the
carburetter played up. Possibly there was some dirt in the
nozzle. Day took it all to pieces in the cold wind, and spent
three-quarters of an hour in fixing it up. We then started off
again gaily in good style. We crossed a large crack in the sea
ice where there were numbers of seals and Emperor penguins. On
the other side of this crack our wheels stuck fast in snow
sastrugi. All hands got on to the spokes and started swinging the
car backwards and forwards; when we got a good swing on, Day
would suddenly snatch on the power and over we would
go&mdash;that is, over one of the sastrugi&mdash;only to find,
often, that we had just floundered into another one ahead. In
performing one of these evolutions Priestley, who as usual, was
working like a Trojan, got his hand rather badly damaged through
its being jammed between the spokes of the car wheel and the
framework. Almost immediately afterwards one of my fingers was
nearly broken, through the same cause, the flesh being torn off
one of my knuckles; and then Mackay seriously damaged his wrist
in manipulating what Joyce called the "thumb-breaking" starter.
Still we went floundering along over the sastrugi and ice cracks,
Day every now and then getting out to lighten the car and limping
alongside. At last we succeeded in reaching a spot amongst the
snow sastrugi on the sea ice, fifteen miles distant from our
winter quarters. Here we dumped the load intended for the
Northern Party, and then Day had a hard struggle to extricate the
car from the tangle of sastrugi and ice-cracks. At last, after
two capsizes of the sledges, we got back into camp at 10 p.m.,
all thoroughly exhausted, all wounded and bandaged. Brocklehurst
carried Day on his back for about a quarter of a mile from where
we left the car up to our winter quarters. So thoroughly
exhausted were we, that we had to take a day's rest on October 4,
before making our final start.</p>

<p align="center"><small>C. A BLIZZARD ON THE BARRIER</small></p>
<p>October 4 was a Sunday, and after the morning service we took
the ponies out for exercise. In the evening the gramophone
discoursed appropriate music, such as "We parted on the Shore",
"I and my true love will never meet again by the bonnie, bonnie
banks of Loch Lomond", concluding with the universal favourite,
"Lead, Kindly Light".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mackay had his damaged wrist attended to, and I put
the question to him as to whether or not he was prepared to
undertake the long journey to the Magnetic Pole under the
circumstances. He said that he was quite ready, provided Mawson
and I did not object to his going with his wrist damaged and in a
sling. We raised no objection, and so the matter was settled. All
that night Mawson and I were occupied in writing final letters,
and packing little odds and ends.</p>
<p>The following morning, October 5, after an early breakfast, we
prepared for the final start. It was quite wonderful what a lot
of things had been forgotten until this last moment. The sledges
were dragged down, from our hut to the edge of the sea ice at the
Penguin Rookery, a distance of a little over a quarter of a mile.
Day was there with the motor-car, ready for the start. Every now
and then some one of the pilgrims would remember that he had left
something very important behind at the hut, and would go running
back for it. These odd belongings had to be tied with bits of
string on to the second sledge which we were going to take with
us on our northern journey, consequently, by degrees, this sledge
became hung over with boots, crampons, and all sorts of what Day
called "gadgets". Murray, Brocklehurst and Armytage came down on
the ice to bid us a final farewell. Brocklehurst took a
photograph of us just before we started, then Day, Priestley,
Roberts, Mackay, Mawson and I got aboard, some on the motor-car,
some on the sledges. Those remaining behind gave us three cheers,
Day turned on the power and away we went. A light wind was
blowing from the south-east at the time of our start, bringing a
little snow with it and another blizzard seemed impending.</p>
<p>After travelling a little over two miles, just beyond Cape
Barne, the snow had become so thick that the coastline was almost
entirely hidden from our view. Under these circumstances I did
not think it prudent to take the motor-car further, so Mackay,
Mawson and I bid adieu to our good friends. Strapping on our
harness we toggled on to the sledge rope, and with a one, two,
three, and away, pulled off into the thick falling snow, which in
a few minutes blotted out all view of the motor-car in our rear.
As we slowly trudged along the signs of an approaching blizzard
became more pronounced and we bore somewhat to our left so as to
have Inaccessible Island as a lee under which to run for shelter,
but after a time, as the threatened blizzard did not come up, we
slewed our sledge more to the right, away from Inaccessible
Island, heading up for our ten-mile depôt. At last, towards
evening Mackay sighted the black flag over the depôt about a mile
distant.</p>
<p>We reached the depôt about 7 p.m. and got up our tent. A
fairly strong wind was still blowing from the south-east, raising
low drift. We slept that night on the floe-ice, with about three
hundred fathoms of water under our pillow.</p>
<p>The following morning, October 6, we started our relay work.
We dragged the Christmas Tree sledge on first, as we were
specially liable to lose parcels off it, for a distance of from
one-third to half a mile. Then we returned and fetched up what we
called the Plum Duff sledge, chiefly laden with our provisions.
The light was dull, and a certain amount of soft, newly-fallen
snow made the sledging heavy. The weather may be described as
thick, with snow falling at intervals. During the afternoon it
cleared somewhat and the Western Mountains came into view at
about 2 p.m. This was fortunate for us, as it enabled us later on
to sight the flag over our fifteen-mile depôt. We camped that
night amongst screw pack-ice within less than a mile of this
depôt.</p>
<p>The following day, October 7, was beautifully fine and calm.
We started about 9 a.m. and sledged over pressure ice ridges and
snow sastrugi, reaching our fifteen-mile depôt in three-quarters
of an hour. Here we camped and repacked our sledges. We took the
wholemeal plasmon biscuits out of two of the biscuit tins and
packed them into canvas bags. This saved us a weight of about 8
lb.</p>
<p>We started again in the afternoon, relaying with the two
sledges. The sledging again was heavy on account of the fresh,
soft snow, and small sastrugi. We had a glorious view of the
Western Mountains, crimsoned in the light of the setting sun. We
camped that night close to a seal hole which belonged to a fine
specimen of Weddell seal. We were somewhat disturbed that night
by the snorting and whistling of the seals as they came up for
their blows. Evidently this seal hole was a syndicate affair. The
sounds at times seemed right under our tent.</p>
<p>October 8 was a fine, clear day, with a beautiful sunset, and
a magnificent mirage, in the direction of Beaufort Island. To the
north of us, the curious hills, called by Captain Scott the
"Stranded Moraines", were now beginning to show out very plainly
in the direction in which we were travelling.</p>
<p>On the morning of October 9 we got under way soon after eight
o'clock. It was a lovely, calm day but cold, the thermometer
registering 30 Fahr. at 8 p.m. The surface was fairly good for
sledging, but in places we came on patches of soft snow, and a
small, lumpy structure of the ice-surface, resembling a newly
raked garden bed, evidently due to the thawing down and
refreezing of "ice flowers". This made travelling very heavy. The
"Stranded Moraines" now showed up very clearly, and Butter Point
itself became visible.</p>
<p>The following day, Saturday, October 10, we were awakened by
the chatter of some Emperor penguins who had marched down on our
tent during the night to investigate us. The sounds may be
described as something between the cackle of a goose and the
chortle of a kookaburra. On peeping out of the Burberry spout of
our tent I saw four standing by the sledges. They were much
interested at the sight of me, and the conversation between them
became lively. They evidently took us for penguins of an inferior
type, and the tent for our nest. They watched, and took careful
note of all our doings, and gave us a good send-off when we
started about 8.30 a.m.</p>
<p>On our journey that morning we passed close by a large bull
seal of the Weddell species. A little further on we noticed a
curious dark object on the ice in the distance, and on coming up
to it found that it was a dead Weddell seal with its head, neck,
and shoulders firmly frozen into the ice. Evidently it had stuck
fast in a seal hole in the ice in trying to get down to the
sea-water.</p>

DEPOT</small></p>
<p>The sky was overcast, and light snow began to fall in the
afternoon. A little later a mild blizzard sprang up from the
south-east; we thought this a favourable opportunity for testing
the sailing qualities of our sledges, and so made sail on the
Plum Duff sledge. As Mackay put it, we "brought her to try with
main course". As the strength of the blizzard increased, we found
that we could draw both sledges simultaneously, which was, of
course, a great saving in labour. We were tempted to carry on in
the increasing strength of the blizzard rather longer than was
wise, and consequently, when at last we decided that we must
camp, had great difficulty in getting the tent up. We slipped the
tent over the poles placed close to the ground in the lee of a
sledge. While two of us raised the poles, the third shovelled
snow on to the skirt of the tent, which we pulled out little by
little, until it was finally spread to its full dimensions. We
were glad to turn in and escape from the biting blast and
drifting snow.</p>
<p>The following day, Sunday, October 11, a violent blizzard was
still blowing, and we lay in our sleeping-bag until past noon, by
which time the snow had drifted high upon the door side of our
tent. As this drift was pressing heavily on our feet and cramping
us, I got up and dug it away. The cooker and Primus were then
brought in and we all got up and had some hoosh and tea. The
temperature, as usually happens in a blizzard, had now risen
considerably, being 8.5° Fahr. at 1.30 p.m. The copper wire on
our sledges was polished and burnished by the prolonged blast
against it of tiny ice crystals, and the surface of the sea ice
was also brightly polished in places. As it was still blowing we
remained in our sleeping-bag for the rest of that day as well as
the succeeding night.</p>
<p>When we rose at about 2 a.m. on Monday, October 12, the
blizzard was over. We found very heavy snowdrifts on the lee side
of our sledges, and it took us a considerable time to dig these
away and get the hard snow raked out of all the chinks and
crannies among the packages on the sledges. We made a start about
4 a.m., and all that day meandered amongst broken pack-ice. It
was evident that the south-east blizzards drive large belts of
broken floe-ice in this direction across McMurdo Sound to the
western shore. The fractured masses of sea ice, inclined at all
angles to the horizontal, are frozen in later, as the cold of
winter becomes more intense, and of course, constitute a very
difficult surface for sledging.</p>
<p>In order to make up for the time we had lost in our
sleeping-bags during the blizzard, we travelled altogether
fourteen hours, and succeeded in doing about six statute miles,
that is, eighteen miles of relay work, and all felt much
exhausted when we turned in that evening. As a result of this we
did not wake until after 8 a.m next morning.</p>
<p>We were now only about two miles from Butter Point. We got
under way at 10 a.m., and a few hours later camped at the foot of
a low ice cliff, about 600 yards south-south-east of Butter
Point. Butter Point is merely an angle in this low ice cliff near
the junction of the Ferrar Glacier valley with the main shore of
Victoria Land. This cliff was from fifteen to twenty feet in
height, and formed of crevassed glacier ice. It was covered by a
hard snow crust, which every now and then gave away and let one
down for a foot or so. This glacier ice was not part of the main
Ferrar Glacier, but appeared to be simply a local piedmont
glacier stretching along for some considerable distance between
the base of the coast range and the sea ice, past the "Stranded
Moraines", until still further south it became confluent with
that Mr. H. G. Ferrar has described as the "pinnacled ice". It
was evident that this piedmont ice was firmly attached to the
land, as it was separated from the sea ice, by a well-marked
tide-crack. With the help of our ice axes we crossed over this
crack and got up the little ice cliff on to the glacier ice, and
selected there a suitable spot for our depôt.</p>
<p>According to arrangements with Lieutenant Shackleton we were
to leave a depôt flag at Butter Point with a letter giving an
account of our doings, and stating approximately by what date we
hoped to return there. But the progress of our journey had been
so much slower than we had originally anticipated that we decided
before reaching Butter Point that it would be imperatively
necessary, in order to make the Magnetic Pole in the time
available, to lighten the load on our sledges by leaving a
portion of our equipment and food.</p>
<p>During the latter part of this day Mawson and Mackay were busy
making a mast and boom for the second sledge, it being our
intention to use the tent floorcloth as a sail. Meanwhile I
sorted out the material to be left at the depôt.</p>
<p>The following day, Wednesday, October 14, we spent the morning
in resorting the loads on our sledges. We depôted two tins of
wholemeal plasmon biscuits, each weighing about 27 lb., also
Mackay's mountaineering nail boots, and my spare headgear
material and mits. Altogether we lightened the load by about 70
lb. We sunk the two full tins of biscuits and a tin containing
boots, &amp;c., a short distance in the glacier ice to prevent
the blizzards blowing them away. We then lashed to the tins a
short bamboo flagpole, carrying one of our black depôt flags, and
securely fastened to its base one of our empty airtight milk
tins, in which we])laced our letters. In these letters for
Lieutenant Shackleton and R. E. Priestley, respectively, I stated
that in consequence of our late start from Cape Royds, and also
on account of the comparative slowness of our progress thence to
Butter Point, it was obvious that we could not return to Butter
Point until January 12, at the earliest, instead of the first
week of January, as was originally anticipated. We ascertained
months later that this little depôt survived the blizzards, and
that Armytage, Priestley and Brocklehurst had no difficulty in
finding it, and that they read our letters.</p>
<p>Leaving the depôt about 9 a.m. on October 14, we started
sledging across New Harbour in the direction of Cape Bernacchi.
In the afternoon a light southerly wind sprang up bringing a
little snow with it, the fall lasting from about 12.30 to 2.30
p.m. We steered in the direction of what appeared to us to be an
uncharted island. On arriving at it, however, we discovered that
it was a time iceberg, formed of hard blue glacier ice with a
conspicuous black band near its summit formed of fine dark
gravel. The iceberg was about a quarter of a mile in length, and
thirty to forty feet high. In addition to the coarser bands of
gravel there was a great quantity of dust, and fine dust bands,
near the surface of the berg. This dust absorbing the heat of the
sun had thawed its way deep down into the berg, thus forming
numerous dust wells and dust grooves. There were several large
cracks in the sea ice in the neighbourhood of this iceberg, and
having taken the bearing of the trend of these by a compass they
helped us to keep direction when the air was thick 'with falling
snow.</p>
<p>The following day, October 15, was beautifully fine and calm;
the sky was slightly cloudy with long belts of cirrus-stratus and
alto-stratus. Erebus, now over fifty miles distant, was cloud
capped. We had a glorious view up the magnificent valley of the
Ferrar Glacier; the spurless hills on either side of the valley,
strongly faceted in a direction parallel to each side of the
valley, spoke eloquently of intense abrasive glacial action in
the immediate geological past. The hills in the foreground,
formed of gneissic granite, were of a rich chocolate brown to
warm sepia hue, fading in the distance to exquisite tints of
reddish purple and violet. Towards evening we had a wonderful
vision of several large icebergs close ahead of us; it seemed as
though they were only a mile or so distant, as one could see
clearly the re-entering angles and bright reflected sides of the
bergs lit up in the rays of the setting sun. Suddenly, as if by
magic, they all vanished. They had been momentarily conjured up
to our view by a wonderful mirage. In the departing rays of the
setting sun Mount Erebus and Mount Bird glowed with a glorious
golden light. This was one of the most beautiful days we
experienced during the whole of our journey. The cold was now
less severe than it had been, the temperature being 9.5° Fahr. at
8 p.m.</p>

<h3>PROFESSOR DAVID'S NARRATIVE (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>
<p><b>ON</b> October 16 we were up at 3.30 a.m., and got under
way at 5.30. A cold wind was blowing from the south, and after
some trouble we set sail on both sledges, using the green
floorcloth on the Christmas Tree sledge, and Mackay's sail on the
Plum Duff sledge. A short time after we set sail it fell nearly
calm; thick clouds gathered; a light wind sprang up from the
south-east, veering to east-north-cast, then back again to
south-east in the afternoon. Fine snow fell for about three
hours, forming a layer nearly a quarter of an inch in thickness.
Towards evening we reached one of the bergs that had been miraged
up the night before. It was four hundred yards long, and eighty
yards wide, and was a true iceberg formed of glacier ice; Mackay,
Mawson and I explored this. Like the previous iceberg its surface
was pitted with numerous deep dust wells. It was wonderful to see
what a very small amount of dust sufficed to dig these wells to a
depth of several feet. The cliff of the berg which faced towards
the north-west was deeply grooved, the appearance in the distance
reminding one of a number of large parallel stalactites. Climbing
up one of these deep grooves I found numbers of small angular
rock pebbles, up to one and a half inches in diameter, adhering
to the bottom of the groove, and it seemed as though these
grooves, like the dust wells, were formed by the warmth of these
small fragments of rock which, as the process of thawing of the
ice cliff progressed, gradually settled down into long rows or
strings as they crept gradually downwards under the influence of
gravitation to the level of the sea ice below. As the shore was
high and rocky, and seemed not more than half a mile distant, I
went over towards it after our evening meal. It proved to be
somewhat further than it appeared.</p>
<p>On the way, for the first time, I met with a structure in the
sea ice known as pancake ice. The surface of the ice showed a
rounded polygonal structure something like the tops of a number
of large weathered basaltic columns. The edges of these polygons
were slightly raised, but sufficiently rounded off by thawing or
ablation to afford an easy surface for the runners of our sledge.
Later on, in the autumn of the following year, we noticed this
pancake ice in process of formation. If, as was often the case,
there was any wind when the sea began to freeze over, the water
at first commenced to look soupy; little by little the small ice
particles which caused this appearance aggregated and formed
myriads of small structures which may be likened to small open
jam tarts. These would then coalesce in groups at their edges and
form pancake ice. These pancakes were from one foot up to about
three feet in diameter. Later, the pancakes would cohere and so a
continuous hard ice crust would be formed over the sea surface;
later freezing simply had the effect of strengthening and
thickening this ice-sheet from below. Close in shore the pancake
ice was traversed by deep tidal cracks. After climbing over these
I reached the shore, which was composed of a well-marked terrace
of coarse gravel and large and small erratic boulders. The
smaller rock fragments were from three to six inches in diameter,
the boulders being as much as five feet in diameter. The lower
terrace was about twenty yards wide and as many feet in height
above the sea; then followed a belt of coarsely crystalline white
marble traversed by bands of grey gneiss and blackish rock.
Capping this belt of ancient crystalline rocks was a terrace of
angular gravel, from eighty to one hundred feet above sea-level,
formed of small rock fragments from one to two inches in
diameter. The belts of coarse marble, gneiss, &amp;c., were
stained green and reddish to ochreous brown in places, and
appeared to have been much mineralised. The whole area seemed to
promise well for economic minerals. One curious boulder specially
attracted my attention; its large pinkish crystals were peppered
over with small black crystals, the whole being enclosed in a
greenish black base. A specimen of this boulder which we brought
back with us will be described in detail in the geological
notes.</p>
<p>On Saturday, October 17, Mawson, Mackay and I landed at Cape
Bernacchi, a little over a mile north of our previous camp. Here
we hoisted the Union Jack just before 10 a.m. and took possession
of Victoria Land for the British Empire. Cape Bernacchi is a low
rocky promontory, the geology of which is extremely interesting.
The dominant type of rock is a pure white coarsely crystalline
marble; this has been broken through by granite rocks, the latter
in places containing small red garnets. The marble or talc schist
contains graphite disseminated through it in small scales. A
great deal of tourmaline and epidote are developed in the granite
at its point of contact with the calcareous schists. It appeared
that the granite had intruded the black tourmaline rocks.</p>

VICTORIA LAND</small></p>
<p>After taking possession we resumed our sledging, finding the
surface of pancake ice very good. The day being calm and clear
and free from either falling or drifting snow, we were able, for
the first time, to turn our sleeping-bag inside out and air it in
the sun. Previous to this the reindeer fur inside the bag had
become much encrusted with ice, chiefly the result of the
freezing of our breath. Although the heat of the sun was
insufficient to actually thaw the ice it evaporated it to a
considerable extent, and we found the bag that night much more
comfortable to sleep in than it had been for many nights
previous.</p>
<p>The following day, one and a quarter miles north of our
preceding camp, we reached an interesting rocky headland. Here we
found a mother seal with a newly born baby seal, the latter about
three and a half feet in length. The mother seal at short
intervals made a sound like "Wa-a-a". After a close inspection
the mother and baby were left undisturbed, and we turned our
attention to the rocks. These were most interesting, bearing a
general resemblance to those at Cape Bernacchi. Some of the
quartz veins traversing this point Mawson thought very favourable
for gold.</p>
<p>When we left this point the wind had considerably freshened.
We had previously hoisted sail on both sledges, and the wind was
now sufficiently strong to admit of our pulling both sledges
together. The total distance travelled was seven statute miles.
This was the most favourable wind we experienced during the whole
of our journey to and from the Magnetic Pole.</p>
<p>Shortly after leaving Baby Seal Point we encountered heavy
belts of screw pack-ice with high sastrugi between. The Christmas
Tree sledge capsized badly when being dragged over one of these
high snow ridges. We were much exhausted when we camped that
night and had suffered somewhat from the cold wind, the
temperature being about 10° Fahr.</p>
<p>That night I experienced a rather bad attack of
snow-blindness, through neglecting to wear my snow goggles
regularly. Finding that my eyes were no better next morning, and
my sight being dim, I asked Mawson to take my place at the end of
the long rope, the foremost position in the team. Mawson proved
himself on this occasion and afterwards so remarkably efficient
at picking out the best track for our sledges, and steering a
good course that by my request he occupied this position
throughout the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>The next two days were uneventful, except for the fact that we
occasionally had extremely heavy sledging over screw pack-ice and
high and long sastrugi. The latter were from two to three feet
high, bounded frequently by almost perpendicular sides, and as
they trended from west to east and our course was from south to
north they proved formidable obstacles to our progress, and
capsizes of the sledges were frequent.</p>
<p>On the night of October 20, we camped on the sea ice about
three-quarters of a mile off shore. To the north-east of us was
an outward curve of the shoreline, shown as a promontory on the
existing chart. Early the next morning I walked over to the shore
to geologise, and found the rocky headland composed of curious
gneissic granite veined with quartz. On ascending this headland I
noticed to my surprise that what had been previously supposed to
be a promontory was really an island separated by a narrow strait
from the mainland. It was clear that by going through this strait
we would save several miles. Accordingly, after breakfast we
sledged into the strait. The western side of the strait was
formed of glacier ice terminating eastward in an almost
precipitous slope. Here and there masses of gneissic granite
showed from beneath the ice. The eastern side of the strait was
formed of terraced moraine gravels with large erratics embedded
in the gravel of the top terrace, eighty feet above
sea-level.</p>
<p>While Mawson determined the position of this island by taking
a round of angles with the theodolite, Mackay and I crossed the
strait and explored the island, pacing and taking levels. The
rocks of which the erratics and boulder-bearing gravels were
formed were almost without exception of igneous origin. One very
interesting exception was a block of weathered clayey limestone.
This was soft and yellowish grey externally but hard and blue on
the freshly fractured surfaces inside. It contained traces of
small fossils which appeared to be seeds of plants. Specimens of
these were taken by us and were depôted later at another small
island, which we called Depôt Island. It is much to be regretted
that we were unable later to reach this depôt on account of dense
belts of pack-ice, and so these very interesting specimens were
lost. Two chips, however, of this rock were fortunately
preserved, sufficient for chemical analysis and microscopic
examination. There could be little doubt that this clayey
limestone has been derived from the great sedimentary formation,
named by H. T. Ferrar, the Beacon Sandstone.</p>
<p>The island which we had been exploring we named provisionally
Terrace Island. It was approximately triangular in shape, and the
side facing the strait, down which we travelled, measured one
mile 1200 yards in length.</p>
<p>The following day, October 22, we sighted the first skua gull
we had seen that season. Snow fell in the afternoon between 2.30
and 5 p.m., forming a layer three-quarters of an inch deep. The
temperature rose to plus 6.5° Fahr. at 7 p.m., and a blizzard
seemed impending.</p>
<p>The following day October 23, we held a serious council as to
the future of our journey towards the Magnetic Pole, It was quite
obvious that at our present rate of travelling, about four
statute miles daily by the relay method, we could not get to the
Pole and return to Butter Point early in January. I suggested
that the most likely means of getting to the Pole and back in the
time specified by Lieutenant Shackleton would be to travel on
half rations, depôting the remainder of our provisions at an
early opportunity. They both agreed, after some discussion, to
try this expedient, and we decided to think the matter over for a
few days and then make our depôt.</p>
<p>We found, as the result of the fall of snow on the preceding
day, that the runners of our sledge clogged, making it difficult
to start the sledge after each halt. The temperature at 5 p.m.
was now as high as plus 5° Fahr. There were numerous seals,
mostly mother seals with young ones, on the ice near the course
of our sledge, as many as seventeen seals being sometimes visible
simultaneously.</p>
<p>The previous day we had observed a mother seal with twin baby
seals. Mackay took up one of these in his arms and stroked it
while it was nuzzling round. It somewhat resembled a large
lizard. The mother snorted at him indignantly, meanwhile, but
made no attempt to attack him.</p>
<p>We encountered some large cracks in the sea ice. The sea water
between the opposite walls had been only recently frozen over so
that the ice was not more than a few inches in thickness. One of
these was eighteen feet wide, and we found that the ice bent
under our weight when we tested it primarily. Mackay called it
"The Bridge of the Beresina." We rushed the sledges over at a
good speed, and although the ice bent under their weight it
fortunately held. At about 3 p.m. the weather grew very thick and
it began to snow; a mild blizzard developing later, we hoisted
sail on both sledges.</p>
<p>The next day, October 24, we found it very warm in the
sleeping-bag, the sky being thickly overcast with dense stratus
cloud. A strong water sky showed up to the east of us, while over
the mountains to the west it was moderately clear. The presence
of this water sky, indicating open sea, warned us that it was
unsafe to stand out far from the land. We reached that evening a
long rocky point of gneissic granite, which we called Gneiss
Point. After our evening hoosh we walked across to the point and
collected a number of interesting geological specimens, including
blocks of kenyte lava.</p>
<p>The following day, October 25, proved a very heavy day for
sledging, as we had to drag the sledges over new snow from three
to four inches deep. In places it had a tough top crust which we
would break through up to our ankles. We met also several
obstacles in the way of wide cracks in the sea ice, from six to
ten feet in width, and several miles in length. The sea water
between the walls of the cracks had only recently been frozen
over, so that the ice was only just thick enough to bear the
sledges. The vicinity of these great ice-cracks were perfect baby
farms for young seals. It was a pretty sight to see one of these
baby seals playing with its mother, whom it kept gently flicking
over the nose with its small flippers, the mother every now and
then gently boxing the baby's ear with one of her large flippers.
One of these mothers charged down on Mackay, who was making an
inspection of her baby at too close quarters to suit her fancy.
Another mother was moaning in great distress over her baby, which
had just died. Evidently the mother seal's affection for her
young is very strong.</p>
<p>In pursuing our north-westerly course we were now crossing a
magnificent bay which trended westwards some five or six miles
away from the course we were steering. On either side of this bay
were majestic ranges of rocky mountains parted from one another
at the head of the bay by an immense glacier with steep ice
falls. On examining these mountains with a field-glass it was
evident that in their lower portions they were formed of granites
and gneiss, producing reddish brown soils. At the higher levels,
further inland, there were distinct traces of rocks showing
horizontal stratification. The highest rock of all was black in
colour, and evidently very hard, apparently some three hundred
feet in thickness. Below this was some softer stratified
formation, approximately one thousand feet in thickness. We
concluded that the hard top layer was composed of igneous rock,
possibly a lava, while the horizontal stratified formation
belonged in all probability to the Beacon Sandstone formation.
Some fine nunataks of dark rock rose from the south-east side of
the great glacier. On either side of this glacier were high
terraces of rock reaching back for several miles from a modern
valley edge to the foot of still higher ranges. It was obvious
that these terraces marked the position of the floor of the old
valley at a time when the glacier ice was several thousand feet
higher than it is now, and some ten miles wider than at present.
The glacier trended inland in a general south-westerly
direction.</p>
<p>We longed to turn our sledges shorewards and explore these
inland rocks, but this would have involved a delay of several
days&mdash;probably a week at least&mdash;and we could not afford
the time. Mawson took a series of horizontal and vertical angles
with the theodolite to all the upper peaks in these ranges. We
were much puzzled to determine on what part of the charted coast
this wide bay and great glacier valley was situated. We
speculated as to whether it was Granite Harbour, but decided that
it could not be in view of the distance recorded by our sledge
meter, for, according to this, we must still be some twenty miles
south of Granite Harbour proper. We were to find out much later
that the point opposite which we had now arrived was in reality
Granite Harbour, and that its position was not shown correctly on
the chart. Of course in pioneering work occasional mistakes such
as these are inevitable.</p>
<p>The following day the sledge still proved very heavy on
account of the soft snow&mdash;two to four inches
deep&mdash;which was continually clogging the runners of our
sledges. It was also difficult to steer a good course amongst the
hummocky pack-ice on account of the day being dull and overcast.
There was much low stratus cloud, and a light south-easterly
wind.</p>
<p>The weather of October 27 was beautifully clear and sunshiny,
and we had a glorious view of the great mountain ranges on either
side of Granite Harbour. The rich colouring of warm sepia brown
and terra cotta in these rocky hills was quite a relief to the
eye. Wind springing up in the south-east we made sail on both
sledges, and this helped us a good deal over the soft snow and
occasional patches of sharp-edged brash ice. Occasionally the
runners of our sledge would catch on one of these sharp
fragments, and there would be a harsh rasping sound as a shaving
was peeled off the runner. We feared that the wind would develop
into a true blizzard, but it proved to be only what Joyce used to
call a "carpet sweeper", driving along the newly fallen snow in
white gossamer-like films over the sea ice.</p>
<p>Towards evening we fetched up against some high ice-pressure
cracks with the ice ridged up six to eight feet high in huge
tumbled blocks. We seemed to have got into a labyrinth of these
pressure ridges from which there was no outlet. At last, after
several capsizes of the sledges and some chopping through the ice
ridges by Mackay, we got the sledges through, and camped on a
level piece of ice. We were much helped in crossing the ridges by
the long steep sastrugi of hardened snow. In places these ran
like ramps up to the top of the pressure ridges, and were just
wide enough and strong enough to bear our sledges. Mawson and I
at this time were still wearing finnesko, while Mackay had taken
to ski boots.</p>
<p>The following day, October 28, the sledging was again very
heavy over sticky soft snow alternating with hard sastrugi and
patches of consolidated brash ice. Shavings of wood were being
constantly rasped off the runners of our sledges. Mackay lost one
of his finnesko off the sledge, but walked back a couple of miles
in the evening and recovered it. Our course had taken us past a
number of snowbergs; these were mostly about forty feet in height
and from a quarter to half a mile in length. They were rigidly
embedded in the sea ice. Occasionally we met with a true iceberg
of blue ice amongst the snowbergs.</p>
<p>After our evening hoosh, Mawson and I went over to the shore,
rather more than half a mile distant, in order to study the
rocks. These we found were composed of coarse red granite; the
top of the granite was much smoothed by glacier ice, and strewn
with large erratic blocks. In places the granite was intersected
by black dykes of basic rocks. One could see that the glacier
ice, about a quarter of a mile inland from this rocky shore, had
only recently retreated and laid bare the glaciated rocky
surface. We found a little moss here amongst the crevices in the
granite rock.</p>
<p>October 29 was beautifully fine, though a keen and fresh wind,
rather unpleasantly cold, was blowing from off the high mountain
plateau to our west. It blew from a direction west by south and
caused a little low drift in the loose snow on the surface of the
sea ice. There was still a great deal of deep, soft snow
alternating with hard sastrugi and small patches of consolidated
brash ice, so that the sledging was very heavy.</p>
<p>We were all thoroughly done up at night after completing our
four miles of relay work. That evening we discussed the important
question of whether it would be possible to eke out our
food-supplies with seal meat so as to avoid putting ourselves on
half rations, and we all agreed that this should be done. We made
up our minds that at the first convenient spot we would make a
depôt of any articles of equipment, geological specimens,
&amp;c., in order to lighten our sledges, and would at the same
time, if the spot was suitable, make some experiments with seal
meat. The chief problem in connection with the latter was how to
cook it without the aid of paraffin oil. We could not afford more
paraffin for this purpose, as we estimated that even with the
utmost care the supply for our Primus, which we used for brewing
tea, cocoa and hoosh, would become exhausted before we could hope
to reach the Magnetic Pole, unless some kind of substitute for
paraffin could be found.</p>
<p>The following day, October 30, was full of interest for us, as
well as hard work. In the early morning, between 2.30 a.m. and
6.30 a.m., a mild blizzard was blowing. We got under way a little
later and camped at about 10.30 a.m. for lunch alongside a very
interesting rocky point. Mawson got a good set of theodolite
angles from the top of this point. The point was formed of coarse
porphyritic grey gneiss, traversed by black dykes of rock,
apparently tinguaite, and another variety containing an abundance
of sparkling black crystals of hornblende, which may be termed
provisionally a hornblende lamprophyre.</p>
<p>After lunch we passed close by a mother seal and her baby. The
mother charged us and we had to skid along quick and lively past
her with the sledges. That day was the first occasion that we
tried the experiment of strengthening the brew of the tea by
using the old tea-leaves of a previous meal mixed with the new
ones. This was Mackay's idea, and Mawson and I at the time did
not appreciate the experiment. Later on, however, we were very
glad to adopt it.</p>
<p>The sledging that afternoon was about the heaviest we had
experienced up to date. The weather was now daily becoming warmer
and the saline snow on the sea ice became sticky in consequence.
It gripped the runners of the sledges like glue, and we were only
able with our greatest efforts to drag the sledges over this at a
snail's pace. We were all thoroughly exhausted that evening when
we camped at the base of a rocky promontory about 180 ft. high.
This cliff was formed of coarse gneiss, with numerous dark
streaks, and enclosures of huge masses of greenish-grey
quartzite.</p>
<p>After our evening hoosh we walked over to a very interesting
small island about three-quarters of a mile distant. It was truly
a most wonderful place geologically, and was a perfect elysium
for the mineralogist. The island, which we afterwards called
Depôt Island, was accessible on the shoreward side, but rose
perpendicularly to a height of 200 ft. above sea-level on the
other three sides. There was very little snow or ice upon it, the
surface being almost entirely formed of gneissic granite. This
granite, as shown in the photograph, was full of dark enclosures
of basic rocks, rich in black mica and huge crystals of
hornblende. It was in these enclosures that Mawson discovered a
translucent brown mineral, which he believed to be monazite, but
which has since proved to be titanium mineral. Patches of a
crystalline, milky-white mineral were to be seen amongst the
large platy crystals of dark green hornblende. These white
crystals we thought might be scapolite. We returned to camp and
slept soundly after the severe work of the day.</p>

and Mawson went in pursuit of some seals which we had sighted
further back on the previous day, while I climbed up an adjacent
granite slope with the field-glasses, watching for a signal from
them, if they were successful in their hunting, to bring up an
empty sledge. They were, however, unsuccessful in their quest,
and after some time returned to camp.</p>
<p>We packed up and made for the island at 9.30 a.m. The sledging
was extremely heavy and we fell into a tide-crack on the way, but
the sledge was got over safely. Mackay sighted a seal about six
hundred yards distant from the site of our new camp near the
island, and just then we noticed that another seal had bobbed up
in the tide-crack close to our old camp. Mackay and Mawson at
once started off in the direction where the first seal had been
sighted. It proved to be a bull seal in very good condition, and
they killed it by knocking it on the head with an ice-axe.
Meanwhile, I unpacked the Duff sledge and took it out to them.
Returning to the site of our camp I put up the tent, and on going
back to Mawson and Mackay found that they had finished fletching
the seal. We loaded up the empty sledge with seal blubber,
resembling bars of soap in its now frozen condition, steak and
liver, and returned to camp for lunch.</p>
<p>After lunch we took some blubber and seal meat on to the
island, intending to try the experiment of making a blubber fire
in order to cook the meat. We worked our way a short distance up
a steep, rocky gulley, and there built a fireplace out of
magnificent specimens of hornblende rock. It seemed a base use
for such magnificent mineralogical specimens, but necessity knows
no laws. We had brought with us our Primus lamp in order to start
the fire. We put blubber on our iron shovel, warmed this
underneath by means of the heat of the Primus lamp so as to
render down the oil from it, and then lit the oil. The experiment
was not altogether successful. Mawson cooked for about three
hours, closely and anxiously watched by Mackay and myself.
Occasionally he allowed us to taste small snacks of the partly
cooked seal meat, which Mere pronounced to be delicious.</p>
<p>While the experiment was at its most critical stage, at about
6 p.m., we observed sudden swirls of snowdrift high up on the
western mountains, coming rapidly down to lower levels. For a few
minutes we did not think seriously of the phenomenon, but as the
drift came nearer we saw that something serious was in the air.
Mackay and I rushed down to our tent, the skirt of which was only
temporarily secured with light blocks of snow. We reached it just
as it was struck by the sudden blizzard which had descended from
the western mountains. There was no time to dig further blocks of
snow, all we could do was to seize the heavy food-bags on our
sledges, weighing sixty pounds each, and rush them on to the
skirt of the tent. The blizzard struck our kitchen on the island
simultaneously with our tent, and temporarily Mawson lost his
mits and most of the tit-bits of seal meat, but these were
quickly recovered, and he came rushing down to join us in
securing the tent. While Mawson in frantic haste chopped out
blocks of snow and dumped them on to the skirt of the tent,
Mackay, no less frantically, struggled with our sleeping-bag,
which had been turned inside-out to air, and which by this time
was covered with drift snow. He quickly had it turned right side
in again, and dashed it inside the tent. At last everything was
secured, and we found ourselves safe and sound inside the tent.
The Primus was quickly got going, and soon we had some hot cocoa
and hot seal pottage, together with some small pieces of charred
but delicious seal blubber. The blizzard continued until past our
bedtime. We turned in with a determination of making further
experiments on the cooking of seal meat on the following
morning.</p>
<p>The following day, November 1, we breakfasted off a mixture of
our ordinary hoosh and seal meat. After some discussion we
decided that our only hope of reaching the Magnetic Pole lay in
our travelling on half rations from our present camp to the point
on the coast at the Drygalski Glacier, where we might for the
first time hope to be able to turn inland with reasonable
prospect of reaching the Magnetic Pole. Mawson was emphatic that
we must conserve six weeks of full rations for our inland journey
to and from the Pole. This necessitated our going on half rations
from this island to the far side of the Drygalski Glacier, a
distance of about one hundred statute miles. In order to
supplement the regular half rations we intended to take seal
meat.</p>
<p>While I was busy in calculating the times and distances for
the remainder of our journey, and proportioning the food rations
to suit our new programme, Mawson and Mackay conducted further
experiments on the cooking of seal meat with blubber. While at
our whiter quarters, Mackay had made some experiments on the use
of blubber as a fuel. He had constructed a blubber lamp, the wick
of which kept alight for several hours at a time, feeding itself
on the seal oil, he had tried the experiment of heating up water
over this blubber lamp, and was partly successful at the time
when we left winter quarters for our present sledging journey.
But his experiments at the time were not taken very seriously,
and the blubber lamp was left behind, a fact which we now much
regretted. An effective cooking-stove was, however, evolved, as
the result of a series of experiments this day, out of one of our
large empty biscuit tins. The lid of this was perforated with a
number of circular holes for the reception of wicks. Its edges
were bent down, so as to form supports to keep the wick-holder
about half an inch above the bottom of the biscuit tin. The
wick-holder was put in place; wicks were made of pieces of old
calico food-bags rolled in seal blubber, or with thin slices of
seal blubber enfolded in them, the calico being done up in little
rolls for the purpose of making wicks, as one rolls a cigarette,
the seal blubber taking the place of the tobacco in this case.
Lumps of blubber were laid round the wick-holder. Then, after
some difficulty, the wicks were lighted. They burned feebly at
first, as seal blubber has a good deal of water in it. After some
minutes of fitful spluttering, the wicks got fairly alight, and
as soon as the lower part of the biscuit tin was raised to a high
temperature, the big lumps of blubber at the side commenced to
have the water boiled out of them and the oil rendered down. This
oil ran under the wick-holder and supplied the wicks at their
base. The wicks, now fed with warm, pure seal oil, started to
burn brightly, and even fiercely, so that it became necessary
occasionally to damp them down with chips of fresh blubber. We
tried the experiment of using lumps of salt as wicks, and found
this fairly successful. We also tried small pieces of our brown
rope for the same purpose, using the separated strands of these
cut in pieces of about one and a half inches long. These made
excellent wicks, but we could not spare much rope. We also tried
the lamp-wick that we had brought with us for binding on our
finnesko, but in this case also rigid economy was an absolute
necessity. We decided to rely for wicks chiefly on our empty
food-bags, and thought possibly that if these ran out we might
have recourse to moss. But the empty food-bags supplied
sufficient wick for our need.</p>
<p>That day, by means of galvanised iron wires, we slung the
inner pot from our aluminium cooker over the lighted wicks of our
blubber cooker, thawed down snow in it, added chips of seal meat
and made a delicious bouillon. This had a rich red colour and
seemed very nutritious, but to me was indigestible. While Mawson
was still engaged on further cooking experiments, Mackay and I
ascended to the highest point of the island, selected a spot for
a cairn to mark our depôt, and Mackay commenced building the
cairn. Meanwhile, I returned to camp and wrote a number of
letters, including one to the commander of the <i>Nimrod</i>. The
latter was accompanied by a sketch plan taken from the Admiralty
chart to show the proper position of our final depôt before we
were to turn inland "on the low sloping shore" to the north-west
of the Drygalski Glacier. The other letters were to Lieutenant
Shackleton and to my family.</p>
<p>The letter to the commander of the <i>Nimrod</i> contained the
following statement of our plans:</p>
<p align="right"><small>"CAMP, GRANITE HARBOUR.</small>*</p>
<p>"<small>DEAR SIR</small>,&mdash;I beg to inform you that we
intend leaving here to-morrow in continuation of our journey
towards the Magnetic Pole. We have to work our two sledges by
relays, which, of course, means slow progress&mdash;only about
four miles per day. At this rate we hope to reach the north side
of the Drygalski Ice Barrier at the front where 'low sloping
shore' is marked on the Admiralty Chart of the Antarctic Sheet
III. (please see sketch on opposite page), by about December 15.
We propose to make a depôt there marked by a black flag similar
to the one we are leaving here at the island at south side of
entrance to Granite Harbour. We propose to travel inland from the
'low sloping shore', and if possible reach the Magnetic Pole and
return to depôt. We estimate that this may take six weeks, so
that we may not return to the coast at the low sloping shore
depôt until about January 25. We propose to wait there until the
<i>Nimrod</i> calls for us at the beginning of February."</p>
<p class="foot">[* At this time we were under the impression that
this island was on the south side of Granite Harbour. We did not
know that we had already left Granite Harbour about twelve miles
to the south of us.]</p>
<p>The letter concluded with detailed instructions regarding the
course to be pursued in searching for the party.</p>

<small>MILTON.</small></div>
<p><b>IT</b> had, of course, become clear to us before this
letter was written, in view of our experience of the already
cracking sea ice near the true Granite Harbour, as well as in
view of our comparatively slow progress by relay, that our
retreat back to camp from the direction of the Magnetic Pole
would in all probability be entirely cut off through the breaking
up of the sea ice. Under these circumstances we determined to
take the risk of the <i>Nimrod</i> arriving safely on her return
voyage at Cape Royds, where she would receive the instructions to
search for us along the western coast, and also the risk of her
not being able to find our depôt and ourselves at the low sloping
shore. We knew that there was a certain amount of danger in
adopting this course, but we felt that we had got on so far with
the work entrusted to us by our Commander, that we could not
honourably now turn back. Under these circumstances we each wrote
farewell letters to those who were nearest and dearest, and the
following morning, November 2, we were up at 4.30 a.m. After
putting all the letters into one of our empty dried-milk tins,
and fitting on the air-tight lid, I walked with it to the island
and climbed up to the cairn. Here, after carefully depôting
several bags of geological specimens at the base of the
flagstaff, I lashed the little post office by means of cord and
copper wire securely to the flagstaff, and then carried some
large slabs of exfoliated granite to the cairn, and built them up
on the leeward side of it in order to strengthen it against the
southerly blizzards. A keen wind was blowing, as was usual in the
early morning, off the high plateau, and one's hands got
frequently frost-bitten in the work of securing the tin to the
flagstaff. The cairn was at the seaward end of a sheer cliff two
hundred feet high.</p>
<p>On returning to camp I put some chopped seal meat into the
cooking-pot on our blubber stove, which Mawson had meanwhile
lighted, and about three-quarters of an hour later we partook of
some nourishing, but no less indigestible seal bouillon. It was
later than usual when we started our sledges, and the pulling
proved extremely heavy. The sun's heat was thawing the snow
surface and making it extremely sticky. Our progress was so
painfully slow that we decided, after, with great efforts, doing
two miles, to camp, have our hoosh, and then turn in for six
hours, having meanwhile started the blubber lamp. At the
expiration of that time we intended to get out of our
sleeping-bag, breakfast, and start sledging about midnight. We
hoped that by adopting nocturnal habits of travelling, we would
avoid the sticky ice-surface which by daytime formed such an
obstacle to our progress.</p>
<p>We carried out this programme on the evening of November 2,
and the morning of November 3. We found the experiment fairly
successful, as at midnight and for a few hours afterwards, the
temperature remained sufficiently low to keep the surface of the
snow on the sea ice moderately crisp.</p>

<p>On November 3 and 4 the weather was fine, and we made fair
progress. At noon Mawson cleaned out the refuse from our blubber
lamp. Amongst this were a few dainty bits; Mackay was what he
called "playing the skua", picking these over, when he
accidentally transferred to his mouth and swallowed one of the
salt wicks which we had been using in the blubber lamp. Mawson
and I were unaware of this episode at the time. Later on, towards
evening, he complained much of thirst, and proferred a gentle
request, when the snow was being thawed down preparatory to
making hoosh, that he might be allowed to drink some of the water
before the hoosh was put into it; at the same time he gave us the
plausible explanation above mentioned as the cause of his
exceeding thirst. After debating the matter at some length, it
was decided, in view of the special circumstances surrounding the
case, and without creating a precedent&mdash;which otherwise
might become a dangerous one&mdash;that he might be allowed on
this occasion to take a drink. Mackay, however, considered that
this water gift was given grudgingly, and of necessity, and
accordingly he sternly refused to accept it. Just then, the whole
discussion was abruptly terminated through the pot being
accidentally capsized when being lifted off the blubber lamp, and
the whole of the water was lost.</p>
<p>On the following day, November 5, we were opposite a very
interesting coastal panorama, which we thought belonged to
Granite Harbour, but which was really over twenty miles to the
north of it.]Magnificent ranges of mountains, steep slopes free
from snow and ice, stretched far to the north and far to the
south of us, and finished away inland, towards the heads of long
glacier cut valleys, in a vast upland snow plateau. The rocks
which were exposed to view in the lower part of these ranges were
mostly of warm sepia brown to terra cotta lint, and were
evidently built up of a continuation of the gneissic rocks and
red granites which we had previously seen. Above these
crystalline rocks came a belt of greenish-grey rock, apparently
belonging to some stratified formation and possibly many hundreds
of feet in thickness; the latter was capped with a black rock
that seemed to be either a basic plateau lava, or a huge sill. In
the direction of the glacier valleys, the plateau was broken up
into a vast number of conical hills of various shapes and
heights, all showing evidence of intense glacial action in the
past. The hills were here separated from the coast-line by a
continuous belt of piedmont glacier ice. This last terminated
where it joined the sea ice in a steep slope, or low cliff, and
in places was very much crevassed. Mawson at our noon halts for
lunch, continued taking the angles of all these ranges and
valleys with our theodolite.</p>
<p>The temperature was now rising, being as high as 22° Fahr. at
noon on November 5. We had a very heavy sledging surface that
day, there being much consolidated brash ice, sastrugi, pie-crust
snow, and numerous cracks in the sea ice. As an offset to these
troubles we had that night, for the first time, the use of our
new frying-pan, constructed by Mawson out of one of our empty
paraffin tins. This tin had been cut in half down the middle
parallel to its broad surfaces, and loops of iron wire being
added, it was possible to suspend it inside the empty biscuit tin
above the wicks of our blubber lamp. We found that in this
frying-pan we could rapidly render down the seal blubber into
oil, and as soon as the oil boiled we dropped into the pan small
slices of seal liver or seal meat. The liver took about ten
minutes to cook in the boiling oil, the seal meat about twenty
minutes. These facts were ascertained by the empirical method.
Mawson discovered by the same method that the nicely browned and
crisp residue from the seal blubber, after the oil in it had
become rendered down, was good eating, and had a fine nutty
flavour. We also found, as the result of later experiments, that
dropping a little seal's blood into the boiling oil produced
eventually a gravy of very fine flavour. If the seal blood was
poured in rapidly into the boiling oil, it made a kind of gravy
pancake, which we also considered very good as a variety.</p>
<p>We had a magnificent view this day of fresh ranges of
mountains to the north of Depôt Island. At the foot of these was
an extensive terrace of glacier ice, a curious type of piedmont
glacier. Its surface was strongly convex near where it terminated
seawards in a steep slope or low cliff. In places this ice was
heavily crevassed. At a distance of several miles inland it
reached the spurs of an immense coastal range, while in the wide
gaps in this range the ice trended inland as far as the eye could
see until it blended in the far distance with the skyline high up
on the great inland plateau.</p>
<p>A little before 9 p.m. on November 5 we left our sleeping-bag,
and found snow falling, with a fresh and chilly breeze from the
south. The blubber lamp, which we had lighted before we had
turned in, had got blown out. We built a chubby house for it of
snow blocks to keep off the wind, and relighted it, and then
turned into the sleeping-bag again while we waited for the snow
and chips of seal meat in our cooking-pot to become converted
into a hot bouillon; the latter was ready after an interval of
about one hour and a half. Just before midnight we brought the
cooker alight into the tent in order to protect it from the
blizzard which was now blowing and bringing much falling snow
with it. Mawson's cooking experiments continued to be highly
successful and entirely satisfactory to the party.</p>
<p>We waited for the falling snow to clear sufficiently to enable
us to see a short distance ahead, and then started again, the
blizzard still blowing with a little low drift. After doing a
stage of pulling on both sledges to keep ourselves warm in the
blizzard we set sail&mdash;always a chilly business&mdash;and the
wind was a distinct assistance to us. We encountered a good deal
of brash ice that day, and noticed that this type of ice surface
was most common in the vicinity of icebergs, which just here were
very numerous. The brash ice is probably formed by the icebergs
surging to and fro in heavy weather like a lot of gigantic
Yermaks, and crunching up the sea ice in their vicinity. The
latter, of course, re-freezes, producing a surface covered with
jagged edges and points.</p>
<p>We were now reduced to one plasmon biscuit each for breakfast
and one for the evening meal, and we were unanimous in the
opinion that we had never before fully realised how very nice
these plasmon biscuits were. We became exceedingly careful even
over the crumbs. As some biscuits were thicker than others, the
cook for the week would select three biscuits, place them on the
outer cover of our aluminium cooker, and get one of his mates to
look in an opposite direction while the messman pointed to a
biscuit and said, "Whose?" The mate with averted face, or shut
eyes, would then state the owner, and the biscuit was ear-marked
for him, and so with the other two biscuits. Grievous was the
disappointment of the man to whose lot the thinnest of the three
biscuits had fallen. Originally, on this sledge journey, when
biscuits were more plentiful, we used to eat them regardless of
the loss of crumbs, munching them boldly, with the result that
occasional crumbs fell on the floorcloth. Not so now. Each man
broke his biscuit over his own pannikin of hoosh, so that any
crumbs produced in the process of fracture fell into the
pannikin. Then, in order to make sure that there were no loose
fragments adhering to the morsel we were about to transfer to our
mouths, we tapped the broken chip, as well as the biscuit from
which it had been broken, on the sides of the pannikin, so as to
shake into it any loose crumbs. Then, and then only, was it safe
to devour the precious morsel. Mackay, who adopted this practice
in common with the rest of us, said it reminded him of the old
days when the sailors tapped each piece of broken biscuit before
eating it in order to shake out the weevils.</p>
<p>Mawson and I now wore our ski-boots instead of finnesko, the
weather being warmer, and the ski-boot giving one a better grip
on the snow surface of the sea ice. The rough leather took the
skin off my right heel, but Mackay fixed it up later in the
evening, that is, my heel, with some "Newskin". As we found the
sharp iron spikes of the ski-boots made holes in our waterproof
floorcloth we made a practice of always changing into our
finnesko before entering the tent.</p>
<p>We sledged on uneventfully for the remainder of November 6,
and during the 7th, and on November 8 it came on to blow again
with fresh-falling snow. The blizzard was still blowing when the
time came for us to pitch our tent. We had a severe struggle to
get the tent up in the high wind and thick falling snow. At last
the work was accomplished, and we were all able to turn into our
sleeping-bag, pretty tired, at about 12.30 p.m.</p>
<p>The weather was still bad the following day, November 9. After
breakfast off seal's liver, and digging out the sledges from the
snow drift, we started in the blizzard, the snow still falling.
After a little while we made sail on both sledges. The light was
very bad on account of the thick falling snow, and we were
constantly falling up to our knees in the cracks in the sea ice.
It seemed miraculous that in spite of these very numerous
accidents we never sprained an ankle.</p>
<p>That day we saw a snow petrel, and three skua gulls visited
our camp. At last the snow stopped falling and the wind fell
light, and we were much cheered by a fine, though distant view of
the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier to the north of us. We were all
extremely anxious to ascertain what sort of a surface for
sledging we should meet with on this great glacier. According to
the Admiralty chart, prepared from observations by the Discovery
expedition, this glacier was between twenty-four and thirty miles
wide, and projected over twenty miles from the rocky shore into
the sea. We hoped that we might be able to cross it without
following a circuitous route along its seaward margins.</p>
<p>We started off on November 10, amongst very heavy sastrugi and
ridges of broken pack-ice. Cracks in the sea ice were extremely
numerous. The morning was somewhat cloudy, but as the midnight
sun got higher in the heavens, the clouds dispersed and the
weather become comparatively warm, the temperature being up to
plus 3° Fahr. at 8 a.m. That day when we pitched camp we were
within half a mile of the southern edge of the Nordenskjold Ice
Barrier.</p>
<p>The following day, November 11, as Mawson wished to get an
accurate magnetic determination with the Lloyd-Creak dip circle,
we decided to camp, Mackay and I exploring the glacier surface to
select a suitable track for our sledges while Mawson took his
observations. After breakfast we removed everything containing
iron several hundred yards away from the tent, leaving Mawson
alone inside it in company with the dip circle. We found that the
ascent from the sea ice to the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier was a
comparatively easy one. The surface was formed chiefly of hard
snow glazed in places, partly through thawing and re-freezing,
partly through the polishing of this windward surface by
particles of fresh snow driven over it by the blizzards. Hummocky
masses, apparently of the nature of large sastrugi, projected
here and there to a height of six feet above the general level.
The latter were something like elongated white ants' nests. In
places the snow surface showed pie-crust structure, a bad surface
for sledging. On the whole this Barrier was fairly free from
crevasses, although Mackay and I crossed a few in our short
pioneering excursion.</p>
<p>The surface ascended gradually to a little over one hundred
feet above the level of the sea ice, passing into a wide
undulating plain which stretched away to the north as far as the
eye could see.</p>
<p>We returned to Mawson with the good news that the Nordenskjold
Ice Barrier was quite practicable for sledging, and would
probably afford us a much more easy surface than the sea ice over
which we had previously been passing. Mawson informed us, as the
result of his observations with the dip circle, that the Magnetic
Pole was probably about forty miles further inland than the
theoretical mean position calculated for it from the magnetic
observations of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition seven years
ago.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of November 12 we packed up, and started
to cross the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier. We noticed here that there
were two well-marked sets of sastrugi, one set, nearly due north
and south, formed by the strong southerly blizzards, the other
set, crossing nearly at right angles, coming from the west and
formed by the cold land winds blowing off the high plateau at
night on to the sea.</p>
<p>We were surprised to observe that this ice barrier was almost
completely isolated from the shore by deep inlets, and for a time
we speculated as to whether after all it might not be a gigantic
tabular iceberg run aground In view, however, of what we observed
later there can be little doubt that it is of the nature of a
large piedmont glacier, afloat at its seaward end and central
portions. It is now practically inert, having no forward movement
from the land towards the sea. It is just the vanishing remnant
of what at one time was no doubt a large active glacier,
vigorously pushed out seaward, the overflow ice from the vast
snowfields of the inland plateau. The supply, however, of ice
near the coast has dwindled so enormously that there is no longer
sufficient pressure to move this ice barrier.</p>
<p>This day, November 12, was an important one in the history of
Mawson's triangulation of the coast, for he was able in the
morning to sight simultaneously Mount Erebus and Mount Melbourne,
as well as Mount Lister. We were fortunate in having a very
bright and clear day on this occasion, and the round of angles
obtained by Mawson with the theodolite were in every way
satisfactory.</p>
<p>The following day, November 13, we were still on the
Nordenskjold Ice Barrier. The temperature in the early morning,
about 3 a.m., was minus 13° Fahr. Mawson had provided an
excellent dish for breakfast consisting of crumbed seal meat and
seal's blood, which proved delicious. We got under way about 2
a.m. It was a beautiful sunshiny day with a gentle cold breeze
off the western plateau. When we had sledged for about one
thousand yards Mawson suddenly exclaimed that he could see the
end of the barrier where it terminated in a white cliff only
about six hundred yards ahead. We halted the sledge, and while
Mawson took some more theodolite angles Mackay and I reconnoitred
ahead, but could find no way down the cliff. We returned to the
sledge and all pulled on for another quarter of a mile. Once more
we reconnoitred, and this time both Mawson and I found some steep
slopes formed by drifted snow which were just practicable for a
light sledge lowered by an Alpine rope. We chose what seemed to
be the best of these; Mackay tied the Alpine rope around his
body, and taking his ice-axe descended the slope cautiously,
Mawson and I holding on to the rope meanwhile. The snow slope
proved fairly soft, giving good foothold, and he was soon at the
bottom without having needed any support from the Alpine rope. He
then returned to the top of the slope, and we all set to work
unpacking the sledges. We made fast one of the sledges to the
Alpine rope, and after loading it lightly lowered it little by
little down the slope, one of us guiding the sledge while the
other two slacked out the Alpine rope above. The man who went
down the sledge to the bottom would unload it there on the sea
ice and then climb up the slope, the other two meanwhile pulling
up the empty sledge. This manoeuvre was repeated a number of
times until eventually the whole of our food and equipment,
including two sledges, were safely down on the sea ice below.</p>
<p>We were all much elated at having got across the Nordenskjold
Ice Barrier so easily and so quickly. We were also fortunate in
securing a seal; Mackay went off and killed this, bringing back
seal steak, liver and a considerable quantity of seal blood. From
the last Mackay said he intended to manufacture a black pudding.
Usually, I believe, a black pudding is manufactured from the part
of the blood which does not contain the fibrin, but on this
occasion the black pudding was wholly formed of fibrin, so that
it may be described as a negative rather than a positive black
pudding. This fibrin was boiled up in seal oil, and though rather
tasteless was at all events nourishing, and was certainly
filling.</p>
<p>While Mackay had been in pursuit of the seal meat Mawson had
taken a meridian altitude while I kept the time for him. After
our hoosh we packed the sledges, and Mawson took a photograph
showing the cliff forming the northern boundary of the
Nordenskjold Ice Barrier. This cliff was about forty feet in
height. We had some discussion as to whether or not there was a
true tidal crack separating the sea ice from this ice barrier.
Certainly, on the south side there was no evidence of the
presence of any such crack, but on the north side there were
small local cracks; yet it could hardly be said that these were
of sufficient importance to be termed true tide-cracks. In one of
these cracks most beautiful filagree ice crystals, fully one inch
across, lined the sides of the walls of the crack in the sea ice.
There can be little doubt, I think, that the greater part of this
Nordenskjold Ice Barrier is afloat.</p>
<p>The sun was so warm this day that I was tempted before turning
in to the sleeping-bag to take off my ski-boots and socks and
give my feet a snow bath, which was very refreshing.</p>
<p>The following day, November 14, we were naturally anxious to
be sure of our exact position on the chart, in view of the fact
that we had come to the end of the ice barrier some eighteen
miles quicker than the chart led us to anticipate we should.
Mawson accordingly worked up his meridian altitude, and I plotted
out the angular distances he had found, respectively, for Mount
Erebus, Mount Lister and Mount Melbourne. As the result of the
application of our calculations to the chart it became evident
that we had actually crossed the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier of
Captain Scott's survey, and were now opposite what on his chart
was termed Charcot Bay. This was good news and cheered us up very
much, as it meant that we were nearly twenty miles further north
than we previously thought we were.</p>

<p align="center"><small>46. A PAUSE BY THE WAY</small></p>
<p>The day was calm and fine, and the surface of the sea ice was
covered with patches of soft snow and nearly bare ice between,
and the sledging was not quite as heavy as usual. In the evening
two skua gulls went for our seal meat during the interval that we
were returning for the second sledge after pulling on the first
sledge. It was wonderful how quickly these gulls made their
appearance from distant parts of the horizon as soon as any fresh
meat was available. The previous day one of them had actually
attempted to eat the seal meat out of our frying-pan when the
meat was being cooked in boiling oil. We could see as we came up
from a distance that the heat of the savoury dish puzzled him a
good deal, as each time he dipped his beak into our hot mince he
jerked it out again very suddenly and seemed a very surprised
bird.</p>
<p>We had a magnificent view of the rocky coastline, which is
here most impressive. The sea ice stretched away to the west of
us for several miles up to a low cliff and slope of piedmont
glacier ice, with occasional black masses of rock showing at its
edge. Several miles further inland the piedmont glacier ice
terminated abruptly against a magnificent range of mountains,
tabular for the most part but deeply intersected. In the wide
gaps between this coast range were vast glaciers fairly heavily
crevassed, descending by steep slopes from an inland plateau to
the sea.</p>
<p>On November 15, there was a fresh wind from the
west-south-west. The weather was overcast, and a few flakes of
snow were falling. We killed two young seals to replenish our
food-supply. Mackay took over the blubber cooking apparatus so as
to set Mawson free for his theodolite observations. The sky was
dull and leaden for most of the day, with occasional glimpses of
light over the western mountains. On the whole it looked as if a
blizzard were approaching.</p>
<p>We were still doing our travelling by night and sleeping
during the afternoon. When we arose from our sleeping-bag at 8
p.m. on the night of November 15, we found that the signs of the
blizzard had more or less passed away. There was a beautifully
perfect "Noah's Ark" in the sky; the belts of cirrus-stratus
composing the ark stretched from south-south-west to
north-north-east, converging towards the horizon in each of these
directions. Fleecy sheets of frost smoke arose from over the open
water on Ross Sea, and formed dense cumulus clouds. This, of
course, was a certain indication to us that open water was not
far distant, and impressed upon us the necessity of making every
possible speed if we hoped to reach our projected point of
departure on the coast for the Magnetic Pole before the sea ice
entirely broke up.</p>
<p>This had been a truly glorious day, bright and sunny, and as
this was the end of a food week and the messman for the week had
kept a little food up his sleeve, so to speak, we fared
sumptuously. The cocoa was extra strong, milky and sweet.
Mackay's opinion was that such cocoa much reminded him of better
days, and was absolutely uplifting.</p>
<p>The following day, November 17, after a very heavy sledging
over loose powdery snow six inches deep we reached a low glacier
and ice cliff. We were able to get some really fresh snow from
this barrier or glacier, the cliffs of which were from thirty to
forty feet high. It was a great treat to get fresh water at last,
as since we had left the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier the only snow
available for cooking purposes had been brackish.</p>
<p>The following day was also bright and sunny, but the sledging
was terribly heavy. The sun had thawed the surface of the saline
snow and our sledge runners had become saturated with soft water.
We were so wearied with the great effort necessary to keep the
sledges moving that at the end of each halt we fell sound asleep
for five minutes or so at a time across the sledges. On such
occasions one of the party would wake the others up, and we would
continue our journey. We were even more utterly exhausted than
usual at the end of this day.</p>
<p>By this time, however, we were in sight of a rocky headland
which we took to be Cape Irizar, and we knew that this cape was
not very far to the south of the Drygalski Glacier. Indeed,
already, a long line was showing on the horizon which could be no
other than the eastward extension of this famous and, as it
afterwards proved, formidable glacier.</p>
<p>On November 19, we had another heavy day's sledging, ankle
deep in the soft snow with occasional thin patches of sludgy
saline ice from which ice flowers had recently disappeared
through thawing, We only did two miles of relay work this day and
yet were quite exhausted at the end of it.</p>
<p>The following day, November 20, being short of meat we killed
a seal calf and cow, and so replenished our larder. At the end of
the day's sledging I walked over about two miles to a cliff face,
about six miles south of Cape Irizar. The rocks all along this
part of the shore were formed of coarse gneissic granite, of
which I was able to collect some specimens. The cliff was about
one hundred feet high where it was formed of the gneiss, and
above this rose a capping of from seventy to eighty feet in
thickness of heavily crevassed blue glacier ice. There were here
wide tide-cracks between the sea ice and the foot of the sea
cliff. These were so wide that it was difficult to cross them.
The whole shore line was literally alive with seals and seal
calves; there were over fifty of them in a stretch of about three
hundred yards. At a distance of two miles our tent was, of
course, quite out of sight, and one had to be guided back, on
this as on other similar occasions, chiefly by one's
footprints.</p>
<p>The following day, November 21, the sledging was painfully
heavy over thawing saline snow surface, and sticky sea ice. We
were only able to do two and two-thirds miles.</p>
<p>On November 22, on rounding the point of the low ice barrier,
thirty to forty feet high, we obtained a good view of Cape
Irizar, and also of the Drygalski Ice Barrier.</p>
<p>On November 23 we found that a mild blizzard was blowing, but
we travelled on through it as Me could not afford to lose any
time. The blizzard died down altogether about 3 a.m., and was
succeeded by a gentle westerly wind off the plateau. That
evening, after our tent had been put up and we had finished the
day's meal, I walked over a mile to the shore. The prevailing
rock was still gneissic granite with large whitish veins of
aplitic granite. A little bright green moss was growing on tiny
patches of sand and gravel, and in some of the cracks in the
granite. The top of the cliff was capped by blue glacier ice.
With the help of steps cut by my ice-axe I climbed some distance
up this in order to try and get some fresh ice for cooking
purposes, but close to the top of the slope I accidentally
slipped and glissaded most unwillingly some distance down before
I was able to check myself by means of the chisel edge of the
ice-axe. My hands were somewhat cut and bruised, but otherwise no
damage was done. The whole of this ice was slightly bitter; no
doubt sea spray in heavy weather when the sea was open during
summer time, had dashed over the headland, and so flavoured the
ice with sea salts. At last I obtained some fairly fresh ice in
the form of large ice stalactites depending from an overhanging
cliff of glacier ice. With these and my geological specimens I
trudged back to the camp.</p>
<p>On November 24, a strong keen wind was blowing off the plateau
from the west-south-west. This died down later on in the morning
at about 2 a.m. and the temperature at 9 a.m. rose as high as
plus 20° Fahr. We were all suffering somewhat from want of sleep,
and although the snow surface was better than it had been for
some little time we still found the work of sledging very
fatiguing. A three-man sleeping-bag, where you are wedged in more
or less tightly against your mates, where all snore and shin one
another and each feels on waking that he is more sinned against
than shinning, is not conducive to real rest; and we rued the day
that we chose the three-man bag in preference to the one-man
bags. That afternoon and evening we slept a little longer than
usual, and felt much refreshed on the early morning of November
25.</p>
<p>It was interesting to watch at lunch time the anxious face of
the messman for the week as he sat with his nose close to the
outer cover of the aluminium cooker in order to catch the first
whiff of the delicious aroma which told that the tea in the water
of the inner cooking-pot had been just brought to the boil. With
the first sniff of the aroma the messman would immediately
unscrew the brass valve of the Primus, so as to let the air in
and the Primus lamp down, with a view to saving paraffin oil.</p>

<h3>PROFESSOR DAVID'S NARRATIVE (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>
<p><b>ON</b> the following day, November 26, we saw on looking
back that the rocky headland, where I had collected the specimens
of granite and moss, was not part of the mainland, but a small
island. This day was rather a memorable one in our journey, as we
reached a large rocky promontory, which we supposed at the time
to be Cape Irizar. Subsequent observations, however, proved that
we must already have passed Cape Irizar, which was in all
probability the small island just referred to.</p>
<p>We had some good sledging here over pancake ice nearly free
from snow and travelled fast. While Mackay secured some seal meat
Mawson and I ascended the rocky promontory, climbing at first
over rock, then over glacier ice, to a height of about six
hundred feet above the sea. The rock was a pretty red granite
traversed by large dykes of black rocks, apparently of an
alkaline character, belonging to the phonolites or
tinguaites.</p>
<p>From the top of the headland to the north we had a magnificent
view across the level surface of sea ice far below us. We saw
that at a few miles from the shore an enormous iceberg, frozen
into the floe, lay right across the path which we had intended to
travel in our northerly course on the morrow. To the north-west
of us was Geikie Inlet and beyond that stretching as far as the
eye could follow was the great Drygalski Glacier. Beyond the
Drygalski Glacier were a series of rocky hills. One of these was
identified as probably being Mount Neumaer. Several mountains
could be seen further to the north of this, but the far distance
was obscured from view by cloud and mist so that we were unable
to make out the outline of Mount Nansen. It was evident that the
Drygalski Glacier was bounded landwards on the north by a steep
cliff of dark, highly jointed rock, and we were not a little
concerned to observe with our field-glasses that the surface of
the Drygalski Glacier was wholly different to that of the
Nordenskjold Ice Barrier. It was clear that the surface of the
Drygalski Glacier was formed of jagged surfaces of ice very
heavily crevassed, and projecting in the form of immense séracs
separated from one another by deep undulations or chasms. It at
once suggested to my mind some scaly dragon-like monster and
recalled the lines of Milton quoted at the beginning of this
chapter. The "Scaly horror of his folded tail" did not seem
enchanting even at this distance of ten to fifteen miles. We
could see that much of this glacier was absolutely impossible for
sledging, but it appeared that further eastward the inequalities
of the ice-surface became less pronounced, and at the extreme
eastward extension, at a distance of some twenty-five to thirty
miles from where we stood, the surface appeared fairly smooth.
After taking these observations from our point of vantage we
retraced our steps. Mawson, in his spiked ski-boots, got down the
sloping ice-surface with comparative ease, but as I had finnesko
on I found it necessary to cut steps with my ice-axe all the way
down the glacier ice.</p>
<p>It was obvious from what we had seen looking out to sea to the
east of our camp that there were large bodies of open water
trending shorewards in the form of long lanes at no great
distance. The lanes of water were only partly frozen over, and
some of these were interposed between us and the Drygalski
Glacier. Clearly not a moment was to be lost if we were to reach
the Drygalski Glacier before the sea ice broke up. A single
strong blizzard would now have converted the whole of the sea ice
between us and the Drygalski Glacier into a mass of drifting
pack. We obtained from this rocky promontory a fine collection of
geological specimens, and here, as elsewhere, got abundant
evidence of former much greater extension of the inland ice
sheet.</p>
<p>The following day, November 27, we decided to run our sledges
to the east of the large berg, which we had observed on the
previous day, and this course apparently would enable us to avoid
a wide and ugly looking tide-crack extending northwards from the
rocky point at our previous camp. The temperature was now as high
as from plus 26° to plus 28° Fahr. at mid-day, consequently, the
saline snow and ice were all day more or less sticky and slushy.
We camped near the large berg.</p>
<p>On the morning of November 28 a mother seal with a well-grown
baby came up to our tent and sniffed and snorted around its
skirt. It seemed about to enter the tent when I hunted it off,
and mother and baby, meanwhile, made tracks, in every sense of
the word, for the open water. Then we packed up and started our
sledges, and pulled them over a treacherous slushy tide-crack,
and then headed them round an open lead of water in the sea ice.
At 3 a.m. we had lunch near the east end of the big berg. Near
here Mackay and Mawson succeeded in catching and killing an
Emperor penguin, and took the breast and liver. This bird was
caught close to a lane of open water in the sea ice. We found
that in the direction of the berg this was thinly frozen over,
and for some time it seemed as though our progress further north
was completely blocked. Eventually we found a place where the ice
might just bear our sledges. We strengthened this spot by laying
down on it slabs of sea ice and shovelfuls of snow, and when the
causeway was completed&mdash;not without Mackay breaking through
the ice in one place and very nearly getting a ducking&mdash;we
rushed our sledges over safely, although the ice was so thin that
it bent under their weight. We were thankful to get them both
safely to the other side.</p>
<p>We now found ourselves amongst some very high sastrugi and
hard tough snow. We had to drag the sledges over a great number
of these, which were nearly at right angles to our course. This
work proved extremely fatiguing. The sastrugi were from five to
six feet in height. As we were having dinner at the end of our
day's sledging we heard a loud report which we considered to be
due to the opening of a new crack in the sea ice. We thought it
was possible that this crack was caused by some movement of the
great active Drygalski Glacier, now only about four miles ahead
of us to the north.</p>
<p>We got out of our sleeping-bag soon after 8 p.m. on the
evening of the 28th, and started just before midnight. The
ice-surface over which we were sledging this day had a curious
appearance resembling rippling stalagmites, or what may be termed
ice marble. This opacity appeared to be due to a surface enamel
of partly thawed snow. This surface kept continually cracking as
we passed over it with a noise like that of a whip being cracked.
It was evidently in a state of tension, being contracted by the
cold which attained its maximum soon after midnight, for,
although of course we had for many weeks past been having the
midnight sun it was still so low in the heavens towards midnight
that there was an appreciable difference in the temperature
between midnight and the afternoon. This difference in our case
was further accentuated by the cold nocturnal wind from the high
plateau to our west. This wind was of the nature of a land breeze
on a large scale.</p>
<p>There were here two sets of sastrugi, the principal set
parallel to the plateau wind and trending here from nearly
north-west to south-east; the other set, caused by the blizzard
winds, trended from south to north. We were now getting very
short of biscuits, and as a consequence were seized with food
obsessions, being unable to talk about anything but cereal foods,
chiefly cakes of various kinds and fruits. Whenever we halted for
a short rest we could discuss nothing but the different dishes
with which we had been regaled in our former lifetime at various
famous restaurants and hotels.</p>
<p>The plateau wind blew keenly and strongly all day on November
29. As we advanced further to the north the ice-surface became
more and more undulatory, rising against us in great waves like
waves of the sea. Evidently these waves were due to the forward
movement, and consequent pressure of the Drygalski Glacier. We
had a fine view from the top of one of these ridges over the
surface of the Drygalski Glacier to the edge of the inland
plateau. Far inland, perhaps forty or fifty miles away, we could
see the great névé fields, which fed the Drygalski Glacier,
descending in conspicuous ice falls, and beyond these loomed dim
mountains. At the end of this day we hardly knew whether we were
on the edge of the sea ice or on the thin edge of the Drygalski
Glacier. Probably, I think, we were on very old sea ice, perhaps
representing the accumulations of several successive seasons.</p>
<p>It fell calm at about 9 p.m., but just before midnight,
November 29-30, the plateau wind returned, blowing stronger than
ever. As the sun during the afternoon had now considerable
heating power we tried the experiment of putting snow into our
aluminium cooking-pot, the exterior of which by this time was
permanently coated with greasy lamp-black from the blubber lamp,
and leaving the pot exposed in the evening to the direct rays of
the sun. The lamp-black, of course, formed an excellent absorbent
of the sun's heat-rays. On getting out of the sleeping-bag at 9
p.m. on November 29 I found that about half the snow I had put
into the cooking-pot had been thawed down by the sun's heat.
This, of course, saved both paraffin and blubber. It takes, of
course, as much energy to thaw ice or snow at a temperature of
32° Fahr. to form a given volume of water as it does to raise
that water from 32° Fahr. up to boiling-point. As our snow and
ice used for domestic purposes frequently had a temperature of
many degrees below zero, the heat energy necessary to thaw it was
greater than that required to raise the water from freezing-point
to boiling-point.</p>
<p>As we advanced with our sledge on the early morning of
November 30, the ice ridges fronting us became higher and
steeper, and we had much ado straining with all our might on the
steep ice slopes to get the sledges to move, and they skidded a
good deal as we dragged them obliquely up the slopes. The plateau
wind, too, had freshened, and was now blowing on our port bow at
from fifteen to twenty miles an hour, bringing with it a good
deal of low drift. At last, about 10 a.m., the plateau wind
dropped and with it the drift, and the weather became warm and
sunny.</p>
<p>The glacier now spread before us as a great billowy sea of
pale green ice, with here and there high embankments of
marble-like névé resembling railway embankments. Unfortunately
for our progress, the trend of the latter was nearly at right
angles to our course. As we advanced still further north the
undulations became more and more pronounced, the embankments
higher and steeper. These embankments were now bounded by cliffs
from forty to fifty feet in height, with overhanging cornices of
tough snow. The cliffs faced northwards. The deep chasms which
they produced formed a very serious obstacle to our advance, and
we had to make some long détours in order to head them off. On
studying one of these chasms it seemed to me that their mode of
origin was somewhat as follows: In the first place the surface of
the ice had become strongly ridged through forward movement of
the glacier, with perhaps differential frictional resistance; the
latter causing a series of undulations, the top of each ice
undulation would then be further raised by an accumulation of
snow partly carried by the west-north-west plateau wind, partly
by the southerly blizzard wind. These two force components
produced these overhanging cliffs facing the north. For some
reason the snow would not lie at the bottoms of the troughs
between the undulations. Probably they were swept bare by the
plateau wind. It was hardly to be wondered at that we were unable
to advance our sledges more than about one mile and a half that
day.</p>
<p>The next day, December 1, the hauling of our sledges became
much more laborious. For half a day we struggled over high
sastrugi, hummocky ice ridges, steep undulations of bare blue ice
with frequent chasms impassible for a sledge, unless it was
unloaded and lowered by Alpine rope. After struggling on for a
little over half a mile we decided to camp, and while Mawson took
magnetic observations and theodolite angles, Mackay and I
reconnoitred ahead for between two and three miles to see if
there was any way at all practicable for the sledge out of these
mazes of chasms, undulations and séracs. Mackay and I were roped
together for this exploratory work, and fell into about a score
of crevasses before we returned to camp, though in this case we
never actually fell with our head and shoulders below the lids of
the crevasses, as they were mostly filled at the surface with
tough snow. We had left a black signal flag on top of a
conspicuous ice mound as a guide to us as to the whereabouts of
the camp, and we found this a welcome beacon when we started to
return, as it was by no means an easy task finding one's way
across this storm-tossed ice sea, even when one was only a mile
or two from the camp. On our return we found that Mawson was just
completing his observations. He found that the dip of the needle
here was 2½° off the vertical. We brought the tent down from
where he had been taking magnetic observations, and treading
warily, because of crevasses, set it up again close to our
sledge, and had lunch.</p>
<p>We noticed in the case of the snow lids over crevasses that
they were covered by a very pretty moss-like growth of pointed
ice crystals. This growth was apparently due to a slow upward
steaming of moist air from the spaces between the walls of the
crevasses below. Possibly during the day the air beneath the snow
lids may become slightly warmed, and as the temperature falls at
night, particularly under the influence of the plateau wind, a
slow percolation of the warm air through the snow lid may take
place, and the small amount of moisture in it is deposited on the
surface of the lid on coming in contact with the colder air
outside. This process, continued from day to day, gradually
builds up these moss-like crystals.</p>
<p>That afternoon we discussed the situation at some length. It
appeared that the Drygalski Glacier must be at least twenty miles
in width. If we were to cross it along the course which we were
now following at the rate of half a mile every half day it would
obviously take at least twenty days to get to the other side, and
this estimate did not allow for those unforeseen delays which
experience by this time had taught us were sure to occur. The
view which Mackay and I had obtained of the glacier ice ahead of
us showed that our difficulties, for a considerable distance,
would materially increase. Under these circumstances we were
reluctantly forced to the conclusion that our only hope of
ultimate success lay in retreat. We accordingly determined to
drag the sledges back off the glacier on to the sea ice by the
way along which we had come.</p>
<p>Early on the morning of December 2 the retreat began. Just
before midnight it had been clear and sunny, but as midnight
approached a thick fog suddenly came up and obscured everything.
Consequently we had great difficulty in picking up our old sledge
tracks as we retreated over the glacier ice. The weather was
still very thick and foggy at 3 a.m., but a little before 6 a.m.
the fog cleared off and the sun shone through. We had now reached
the southern edge of the glacier, and were back on the old
undulating sea ice. We turned our sledges eastwards following
parallel with the glacier edge. Immediately on our left rose
large rounded hummocky masses of ice belonging to the Drygalski
Glacier, and from fifty to sixty feet in height. The sky,
meanwhile, had become again overcast with dense cumulus which
drifted across rapidly from a south-easterly direction.</p>
<p>The following day we still travelled eastwards parallel to the
southern edge of the Drygalski Glacier. The sledging was chiefly
over soft snow, ankle deep, with occasional high snow sastrugi,
and here and there a patch of rippled sea ice. There could be no
doubt about it being sea ice this time because in one place, at
the foot of one of these steep snow ridges, we noticed a pool of
water only thinly frozen over, and on breaking the ice I tasted
the water and found it was very salt.</p>
<p>Towards the end of this day's sledging we passed a long inlet
trending north-westerly. This inlet was floored with sea ice, and
made a long, deep indentation in the glacier ice. After our
hoosh, and before turning into the sleeping-bag, Mawson and I
went on to the north over some high hummocky ridges of the
Drygalski Glacier to look ahead. Mawson, after a while, returned
to camp, while I turned north-westwards to explore the inlet.
After falling into a few crevasses which traversed the great
billowy hummocks of blue glacier ice in all directions, I got
down into the inlet, and on following it north-westwards, found
that it gradually passed into a definite glacial river channel,
and became quite unpracticable for sledging. It was quite clear
from the steep banks of this channel, cut out of the hard snow
névé and glacier ice, that during the few weeks of thaw in this
part of the Antarctic, great volumes of thaw water must rush down
off the higher parts of the glacier towards the sea, and in their
passage they tear out deep canyon-like channels in the glacier
ice and névé. This channel trended at first exactly in the
direction in which we wished to make, but it was obvious that it
was an impossible route for the sledges.</p>

<p align="center"><small>47. SKUA GULLS AT THE
ICE-EDGE</small></p>
<p>We decided on December 4 that we had better go on an extended
reconnoitring expedition before we again risked landing our
sledge in a labyrinth of pressure ridges and crevasses. After
hauling our sledges for a little less than a mile, and meeting
with steep slopes of snow dunes, we halted. While Mackay sewed
one of the tent-poles, which had become loosened, back into its
place in the canvas crown which held the tops of the tent-poles
together, Mawson and I climbed on to some hummocks a little north
of the camp to see which route would be best to follow on our
reconnoitring journey. After lunch we all three started with our
ice-axes and the Alpine rope. We travelled up a broad bottomed
snow valley for about two miles trending in the direction of
Mount Larsen. Then for a little over a mile beyond it trended
more to the right in the direction of Mount Nansen. Here we got
into difficult country, the snow surface being succeeded by
steep-sided hummocks, rolls and ridges of blue glacier ice, with
occasional deep chasms and very numerous crevasses. We fell into
numbers of the latter up to our thighs, but the snow lids as yet
were just strong enough to stop us going deeper. Mawson opened up
one of these snow lids with his ice-axe, and we noticed that the
lid was from one to one and a half feet thick, while the crevasse
was thirty feet wide and of vast depth. Much of the ground over
which we were travelling rang hollow, and was evidently only
roofed over by a thin layer of tough snow. Altogether we
travelled about four miles to the north of our camp, but could
see no sign from there of any sea to the north of us. Meanwhile,
Mackay diverged somewhat to the west, climbed on the top of a
high ice pyramid, but was unable to see any trace of the sea
beyond. We now returned at a smart pace back to camp, arriving
about 9 a.m. We were all pretty tired, and, as usual before
entering the tent, we took off our spiked ski-boots so as to
avoid puncturing the waterproof floorcloth, and put on finnesko.
Hoosh was prepared, and we had a good meal of it, as well as of
fried seal meat with blubber and seal oil.</p>
<p>It was evident now that even if we were to succeed in crossing
the Drygalski Glacier, the passage would occupy a good many days,
even under the most favourable circumstances, and our provisions
were running very short. After we finished our hoosh, Mawson,
with the field-glasses, sighted a seal near to the big berg to
the south of us, which we had passed some five days previously.
We decided that we would go after this seal the next day;
meanwhile, the seal disappeared. Fearing that a blizzard might
spring up on the following day, I proposed to go that evening out
to the berg in search of seals, but Mackay kindly volunteered
instead and started off with his rucksack and ice-axe and a small
allowance of provisions, consisting of some cooked seal meat,
biscuits and chocolate. He had a long journey before him. While
he was gone I was chiefly occupied in dividing up our rations
into half-ration lots. At 5 p.m. I was attracted by the notes of
a penguin behind an ice mound at no great distance. Rousing
Mawson, we both went in pursuit and after a long and severe
chase, captured an Adelie penguin.</p>
<p>At about midnight, December 4-5, Mackay returned to camp after
his fourteen miles' tramp over the sea ice. He brought back with
him a most welcome addition to our larder in the shape of over
thirty pounds of seal meat, liver and seal blubber. He reported
that he had had great difficulty in crossing the large ice-crack
where we had constructed the causeway for our sledge some five
days previously, and he said that it would now have been
impossible to have got the sledge over it. Mackay had been up
over seventeen hours, and had been sledging, travelling over
heavy ice, and carrying his heavy load of seal meat with only
short intervals for meals. He had travelled a distance of about
twenty-four miles, and of course under the circumstances was much
exhausted and badly in need of a long rest. By securing the so
much needed additional food supply, he had rendered us an
extremely important service. It now, of course, became necessary
to give him the needed rest on the following day. Accordingly,
the earlier part of December 6 we spent in the sleeping-bag.</p>
<p>Soon after midnight, December 5-6, we left our camp on the
south side of the Drygalski Glacier, and struck across the high
ridges of blue ice into the small valley in the glacier which we
had prospected two days previously. As usual a keen wind was
blowing off the plateau at this time of the morning, but the
temperature soon rose to plus 23° Fahr. at 7.15 a.m. The sky was
overcast with heavy stratus and cumulus clouds, especially in the
direction of Cape Washington. We passed over a considerable
number of crevasses without any serious accident. The day's
sledging was heavy on account of the strongly undulating surface
of the ice and the quantity of soft snow in the ice valley on the
surface of the Drygalski Glacier.</p>
<p>The following day, December 7, was also dull and lowering,
with very dense cumulus clouds over Cape Washington and Mounts
Melbourne and Nansen. We inferred that this dense cumulus was due
to the presence of open water between the Drygalski Glacier and
Cape Washington, and were not a little anxious as to whether, in
the event of the sea ice having all drifted out on the north side
of the Drygalski Glacier, it would be possible for us to travel
shorewards on the surface of the glacier itself, when we got to
the other side. We encountered many precipitous slopes from
thirty to forty feet deep, often with overhanging cornices,
barring our northward progress like those already met with in the
part of the glacier from which Me had retreated. These
overhanging cliffs, however, were not quite as serious as those
which we had left behind, and by making considerable détours we
managed to circumvent them. At last we seemed to have got amongst
an impassable belt of high crevassed ice ridges with precipitous
chasms between. After a good deal of reconnoitring ahead a clue
out of the labyrinth was discovered in the form of a series of
high snow ridges which led backwards and forwards, in and out,
amongst the high-pressure ridges, and eventually enabled us to
land our sledges in a broad crevassed valley on the glacier
surface.</p>
<p>After the hoosh at the end of our day's sledging, Mawson and I
walked about two miles, looking out for a track for the next
morning. The outlook was by no means encouraging, as the surface
still bristled with huge ice undulations as far as the eye could
reach. It was just as though a stormy sea had suddenly been
frozen solid, with the troughs between its large waves here and
there partly filled with snow, while the crests of the waves were
raised by hard ridges of drift snow, terminating in overhanging
cliffs, facing the north. It was obvious, too, that the glacier
ice over which we would have to travel, was still very heavily
crevassed. As we returned, a mild blizzard sprang up from the
south-south-west, bringing low drift with it. The blizzard
cleared off in about an hour and a half, and the sun came out
strong and hot, and rapidly thawed the snow on our tent and on
the food-bags stored on our sledges.</p>
<p>The following day, December 8, we dug away the drift snow
piled by the blizzard against our sledges, and were pleased to
find that the day was beautifully fine and sunny with a light
breeze from the west-south-west. The sledging was very heavy up
and down steep ice slopes with much soft snow between.</p>
<p>Mawson had a slight attack of snow blindness on December 9.
The day was so warm that we even felt it oppressive, the
temperature at midnight being as high as plus 19° Fahr. The
glacier ice kept cracking from time to time with sharp reports.
Possibly this may have been due to the expansion of the ice under
the influence of the hot sun. At one spot the sledges had to be
dragged up a grade of 1 in 3 over smooth blue glacier ice. This
was exceedingly heavy work. At last, when we were near to our
time for camping, Mackay, on going on a short distance ahead to
reconnoitre with the field-glasses, sighted open water on the
northern edge of the Drygalski Ice Barrier, about three to four
miles distant. He announced his discovery with shouts of
<i><small>&Theta;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&tau;&tau;&alpha;</small></i>,&nbsp;<i><small>&Theta;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&tau;&tau;&alpha;</small></i>,
which thrilled us now as of old they thrilled the Ten Thousand.
It was no sparkling waters of the Euxine that had met his gaze,
but a Black Sea nevertheless, for so it appeared as its inky
waves heaved under the leaden sky. But what a joy to have reached
once more that friendly water world that went up by many a creek
and river to our homes. It was now clear to us that we could not
hope for sea ice over which to sledge westwards to the shore,
where we proposed to make our final depôt before attempting the
ascent of the great inland plateau in order to reach the Magnetic
Pole.</p>
<p>During the day we were cheered by a visit from several snow
petrels, which flew around our camp, as well as from three skua
gulls. Mawson managed to snare one of the skuas with a
fishing-line, but it got away when he was hauling in the line.
Our sledging that day was not quite so heavy; the ice undulations
were less formidable, and the belts of snow between became wider
and firmer. Just after lunch a beautiful Wilson's petrel flew
around us.</p>
<p>December 10 saw us still struggling to cross the Drygalski
Glacier. We could see that we were now on a pretty high ridge,
but the highest part of the glacier now lay to the south and
therefore behind us. We were much rejoiced towards the end of the
day's sledging to find ourselves at last off the true glacier
type of surface, and on to what may be described as an undulating
barrier type. This improvement of the surface to our west enabled
us to do what we had been longing to do for the last six days,
turn our sledge westwards. At first we had to incline somewhat to
the north-west in order to skirt round some high ice ridges.
Then, after making some northing, we were able to go nearly due
west. The snow surface was largely of the pie-crust type; our
ski-boots broke through it at every step and we sank in up to our
ankles. At intervals we still crossed low ridges of solid glacier
ice, traversed by crevasses. All the crevasses were more or less
roofed over with tough snow lids. These lids sometimes were
slightly in relief, or sometimes showed slight depressions in the
general surface. In such areas the snow lids rung hollow as the
sledges travelled over them. We found the snow lids always most
treacherous close to either wall of the crevasse, and we
frequently fell partially through at such spots, but had no very
bad falls in this part of the glacier.</p>
<p>The following day. December 11, we had a fine view of "Terra
Nova" Bay, and as far as could be judged the edge of the
Drygalski Ice Barrier on the north was now scarcely a mile
distant. We were much surprised at the general appearance of the
outline of the Ice Barrier coastal ice and coast-line ahead of
us. It did not agree, as far as we could judge, with the shape of
this region as shown on the Admiralty chart, and we could see no
certain indication whatever of what was called, on the chart,
"the low, sloping shore". Accordingly we halted a little earlier
than usual in order to reconnoitre. There was a conspicuous ice
mound about half a mile to the north-west of this camp. Mackay
started off with the field-glasses for a general look round from
this point of vantage. Mawson started changing his plates in the
sleeping-bag, while I prepared to go out with my sketch-book and
get an outline panoramic view of the grand coast ranges now in
sight. Crevasses of late had been so few and far between that I
thought it was an unnecessary precaution to take my ice-axe with
me, but I had scarcely gone more than six yards from the tent,
when the lid of a crevasse suddenly collapsed under me at a point
where there was absolutely no outward or visible sign of its
existence, and let me down suddenly nearly up to my shoulders. I
only saved myself from going right down by throwing my arms out
and staying myself on the snow lid on either side. The lid was so
rotten that I dared not make any move to extricate myself, or I
might have been precipitated into the abyss. Fortunately Mawson
was close at hand, and on my calling to him, he came out of our
sleeping-bag, and bringing an ice-axe, chipped a hole in the firm
ice on the edge of the crevasse nearest to me. He then inserted
the chisel edge of the ice-axe in the hole and holding on to the
pick point, swung the handle towards me: grasping this, I was
able to extricate myself and climbed out on to the solid ice.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day, the coast-line showing up very finely,
and I was able to get from the ice mound a sketch of the
mountains. Mawson also took three photographs, making a panoramic
view of this part of the coast. He was able, also, to get a
valuable series of angles with the theodolite, which showed that
the shape of the coast-line here necessitated serious
modification of the existing chart.</p>

<p><b>FAR</b> beyond the golden mountains to the north and west
lay our goal, but as yet we knew not whether we were destined to
fail or succeed. Meanwhile no time was to be lost in hurrying on
and preparing for a dash on to the plateau, if we were to deserve
success.</p>
<p>The following day, December 12, we sledged on for half a mile
until we were a little to the west of the conspicuous ice mound
previously described. We concluded that as this ice mound
commanded such a general view of the surrounding country, it must
itself be a conspicuous object to any one approaching the
Drygalski Glacier by sea from the north; and so we decided that
as there was still no trace of the "low, sloping shore" of the
chart, and that as the spot at which we had now arrived was very
near to the area so named on the chart, we would make our depôt
here. We intended to leave at this depôt one of our sledges with
any spare equipment, a little food, and all our geological
specimens, and proceed thence shorewards and inland with one
sledge only. We estimated that we still had fully 220 miles to
travel from this depôt on the Drygalski Glacier to the Magnetic
Pole. It was, therefore, necessary now to make preparations for a
journey there and back of at least 440 miles. We thought that
with détours the journey might possibly amount to 500 miles.</p>
<p>We could see, even from our distance of from twenty to thirty
miles from the shoreline, that we had no light task before us in
order to win a way on to the high inland plateau. Before we knew
that the whole of the sea ice had gone out between us and Mount
Melbourne, we had contemplated the possibility of travelling
further northwards along the coast on sea ice, down to a spot
marked on the chart as Gerlache Inlet. This inlet we now saw was
situated amongst a wilderness of high sharp jagged mountain peaks
rising to heights of from 6000 to 8000 ft. above sea-level, and
as it could now be approached only from the land, it was now
practically inaccessible. Nearer to us, and to the north-west of
our position on the Drygalski Ice Barrier, was the giant form of
Mount Nansen, one of the grandest and most imposing of all the
mountains seen by us in the Antarctic. Further to the left and
nearly due west of us was another fine dark mountain massif,
Mount Larsen. Between Mount Larsen and Mount Nansen was a vast
glacier with a rugged surface, steep ice falls and large
crevasses. About midway between Mounts Larsen and Nansen was a
huge nunatak of black rock, rising abruptly from the ice surface
at a point several miles inland from the shore-line. Further to
the left of Mount Larsen was another glacier less formidable in
appearance and smaller in size than the Mount Nansen Glacier.
This terminated near the coast in rather a steep slope, and
gradually became confluent with the Drygalski Glacier. To the
south of this glacier, which may be termed the Mount Larsen
Glacier, was another great mountain massif with Mount
Bellingshausen on the north and Mount Neumaer on the south. The
foothils of Mount Neumaer terminated in steep precipices forming
the northern wall of the Drygalski Glacier.</p>
<p>Our first business was to lay in a stock of provisions
sufficient to last us for our 500 miles of further journeying.
Mackay started for a small inlet about a mile and a half distant
from our camp, where he found a number of seals and Emperor and
Adelie penguins. He killed some seals and Emperor penguins, and
loaded a good supply of seal steak, blubber, liver and penguin
steak and liver on to the sledge. In the course of his hunting,
he fell through an ice bridge, at a tide-crack, up to his waist
in the water. Mawson and I went out to meet him when the sledge
was loaded, and helped to drag it back to camp. We found it very
hot in the tent, the weather being fine and sunny. It was
delightful to be able at last to rest our weary limbs after the
many weeks of painful toil over the sea ice and the Drygalski
Glacier.</p>
<p>We started cooking our meat for the sledging trip on the
following day, December 13, our intention being to take with us
provisions for seven weeks, in addition to equipment, including
scientific instruments, &amp;c. We estimated that the total
weight would amount to about 670 lb. We were doubtful, in our
then stale and weakened condition, whether we should be able to
pull such a load over the deep loose snow ahead of us, and then
drag it up the steep ice slopes of the great glaciers which
guarded the route to the plateau.</p>
<p>The sun was so hot that it started melting the fat out of our
pemmican bags, so that the fat actually oozed through not only
the canvas of the bags themselves, but also through the thick
brown canvas of the large fortnightly food-bags, which formed a
sort of tank for containing the pemmican bags, and we found it
necessary at once to shade the food-bags from the sun by piling
our Burberry garments over them. Leather straps, tar rope, tins,
sledge harness, lamp-black off the blubber cooker, warmed by the
rays of the sun, all commenced to sink themselves more or less
rapidly into the névé.</p>
<p>We unpacked and examined both sledges, and found that of the
two, the runners of the Duff sledge were the less damaged. As the
result of the rough treatment to which it had recently been
subjected, one of the iron brackets of this sledge was broken,
but we replaced it with a sound one from the discarded Christmas
Tree sledge.</p>
<p>The following day, December 14, we were still busy preparing
for the great trek on the morrow. Mackay was busy cooking Emperor
penguin and seal meat for the plateau journey; Mawson was
employed in transferring the scientific instrument boxes and the
Venesta boxes in which our Primus lamp and other light gear were
packed from the Christmas Tree sledge on to the Duff sledge. He
also scraped the runners of the sledge with pieces of broken
glass in order to make their surfaces as smooth as possible. I
was busy fixing up depôt flags, writing letters to the Commander
of the <i>Nimrod</i>, Lieutenant Shackleton, and my family, and
fixing up a milk tin to serve as a post office on to the depôt
flag-pole. When all our preparations were completed we drew the
Christmas Tree sledge with some of our spare clothing, our
blubber cooker, a biscuit tin with a few broken biscuits, and all
our geological specimens to the top of the ice mound, about a
quarter of a mile distant. On reaching the top of the mound we
cut trenches with our ice-axes in which to embed the runners of
the sledge, fixed the runners in these grooves, piled the chipped
ice on top, then lashed to the sledge, very carefully, the
flag-pole about six feet high, with the black flag displayed on
the top of it. The wind blew keenly off the plateau before our
labours were completed. We all felt quite sorry and downcast at
parting with this sledge, which by this time seemed to us like a
bit of home. We then returned to camp. Just previous to depôting
this sledge, Mackay fixed another small depôt flag close to the
open sea a few yards back from the edge of the ice cliff.</p>
<p>Soon after we had turned into our sleeping-bag, a gentle
blizzard started to blow from west by south. This continued all
night, increasing in intensity in the morning. We were able to
see great whale-backed clouds, very much like those with which we
had been familiar over Mount Erebus, forming over Mount Nansen.
As this blizzard wind was blowing partly against us, we decided
that we would wait until it had either slackened off or decreased
in force.</p>
<p>The whole of the next day, unfortunately, the blizzard
continued. The sun was very hot, and as the result of its heat we
were to-day for the first time subject to a new trouble. The
blizzard, of course, drifted snow all over our tent; and a strong
thaw set in on the side of it which faced the sun. The wind,
flapping the canvas of the tent against the tent-poles, brought
the thaw water through on to the poles facing the sun. Inside the
tent, however, the temperature was just below freezing-point, and
as the water started to trickle down the poles it froze. With the
flapping of the tent backwards and forwards against the
tent-poles, the small ridge of ice on the upper surface of each
tent-pole became drawn out into sharp, saw-like teeth, and these
started cutting through the canvas. All through this day,
consequently, we had to be continually getting out of the
sleeping-bag and running our hands down the tent-poles so as to
rub off the ice teeth.</p>
<p>The blizzard continued till midnight of December 15-16, when
its force markedly decreased. We breakfasted accordingly just
after midnight. I dug out the sledge from the snow which had
drifted over it, and Mackay cached some seal meat in an adjoining
ice mouth. At last, about 7 a.m., we made a start and were
delighted to find that, chiefly as the result of the three days'
rest in camp, we were able to pull our sledge&mdash;weighing
about 670 lb.&mdash;with comparative ease. The snow, though soft,
had become crusted over the surface through the thaw brought on
by the blizzard, followed by freezing during the succeeding cold
night. The sledging was certainly heavy, but not nearly so
distressing as that which we had recently experienced in crossing
the Drygalski Glacier. The "tablecloth was being laid on the top
of Mount Nansen in the form of a remarkable flattish thin white
fleecy cloud. It looked as though a high-level blizzard was
blowing over the summit. We steered towards the great black
nunatak midway between Mount Nansen and Mount Larsen, as Mawson
and Mackay both considered that in this direction lay our chief
hope of finding a practical route to the high plateau.</p>
<p>On December 17 we had a very interesting day. The sledging was
rather heavy, being chiefly over soft snow and pie-crust snow. It
was difficult to decide sometimes whether we were on fresh-water
ice or on sea ice. Here and there we crossed ice ridges,
evidently pressure ridges of some kind. These would be traversed
by crevasses which showed the ice in such places to be at least
thirty to forty feet in thickness. Close to our final
camping-ground for the day was a long shallow valley or barranca;
it was from one hundred and twenty to one hundred and thirty
yards in width. The near side was steep, though not too steep for
us to have let our sledge down; but the far side was precipitous,
being bounded by an overhanging cliff from twenty to thirty feet
high. The floor of this valley was deeply and heavily crevassed.
This sunken valley, therefore, formed a serious obstacle to our
advance.</p>
<p>While Mackay was preparing the hoosh Mawson travelled to the
right, and I to the left along this valley seeking for a possible
crossing place. At last Mawson found a narrow spot where there
had been an ice bridge over the valley, but this had become
cracked through at the centre. It was nevertheless strong enough
to bear our sledge. Near this ice bridge Mawson stated that he
noticed muddy material containing what appeared to be
foraminifera, squeezed up from below. The day had been calm and
clear, and we were able to get detailed sketches of this part of
the coast range.</p>
<p>The following day we made for the ice bridge with our sledge,
and found that the crack crossing it had opened to a width of
eighteen inches during the night. The far side had become too,
somewhat higher than the near side. We had little difficulty in
getting the sledge over, and after crossing several other cracks
in the ice and névé without mishap reached once more a fairly
level surface. A light plateau wind was now blowing from off the
Mount Nansen glacier. The hard snow surface was furrowed by two
very definite sets of sastrugi, one set coming from a
south-westerly direction, and apparently caused by blizzard wind,
the other from nearly north-west. The latter were evidently due
to strong rushes of cold air from the high plateau down the broad
valley occupied by the Mount Nansen glacier. That day we passed
over a series of pressure ridges with their steeper sides
directed towards the north-west. At the bottom of these steep
slopes the ice was often crevassed, and sometimes we had some
little difficulty in crossing them. They were probably due to
pressure from the Drygalski Glacier.</p>
<p>At lunch time, soon after midnight, we reached some very
interesting glacial moraines in the form of large to small
blocks, mostly of eruptive rock, embedded in the ice. It was
probable, from their general distribution, that they formed part
of an old moraine of Mount Nansen, though now about fifteen miles
in advance of the present glacier front. A conspicuous rock
amongst the boulders was a greenish-grey to greenish-black
diorite, very rich in sphene. The brown crystals of sphene were
frequently intercrystallised with the felspars, and gave the rock
a very pretty appearance. Small fragments of sandstone and clay
shale were also represented in these moraines. The larger blocks
were up to seven feet in diameter, and formed chiefly of reddish
porphyritic granite. We collected a number of specimens from this
moraine.</p>
<p>Fine rolls of cumulus clouds were gathering to our north-east.
The day was calm with occasional gleams of sunshine. After the
plateau wind had died down about 2 p.m. it commenced to snow a
little, the snow coming from between south-west and
west-south-west.</p>
<p>At midnight on December 19 we started sledging in the falling
snow, guided partly by the direction of the wind, partly by that
of the pressure ridges and crevasses, occasionally taking compass
bearings. Before we had gone far we reached a tide-crack with
open water three to four feet wide. There was also a width of
about eighteen feet of recently formed thin ice at this
tide-crack. We tasted the water in this crack and found that it
was distinctly salt. It was clear then that at this part of our
journey we were travelling over sea ice. About half a mile
further on we reached another open tide-crack, and had to make a
considerable détour in order to get over it. The surface of the
ice was now thawing, and we trudged through a good deal of slushy
snow, with here and there shallow pools of water as blue as the
Blue Grotto of Capri. On the far side of this second tide-crack,
and beyond the blue pools, we reached a large pressure ridge
forming a high and steep scarped slope barring our progress. Its
height was about eighty feet. There was nothing for it, if we
were to go forward, but to drag our heavy sledge up this steep
slope. It was extremely exhausting work, and we were forced to
halt a few times, and had to take the sledge occasionally
somewhat obliquely up the slope where it was very steep. In such
cases the sledge frequently skidded. Our troubles were increased
by the fact that this ice slope was traversed by numerous
crevasses, which became longer and wider the further we advanced
in this direction.</p>
<p>At last we got to the slope, only to see in the dim light that
there were a succession of similar slopes ahead of us, becoming
continually higher and steeper. The ice, too, became a perfect
network of crevasses, some of which were partly open, but most of
them covered over with snow lids. Suddenly, when crossing one of
these snow lids, just as he was about to reach the firm ice on
the other side, there was a slight crash and Mawson instantly
disappeared from sight. Fortunately the toggle at the end of his
sledge rope held, and he was left swinging in the empty space
between the walls of the crevasse, being suspended by his harness
attached to the sledge rope. Mackay and I hung on to the rope in
case it should part at the toggle, where it was somewhat worn.
Meanwhile, Mawson called out from below to pass him down the
Alpine rope. Leaving Mackay to keep hold of the toggle end of
Mawson's harness rope, I hurried back to the sledge, which was
about ten feet behind, and just as I was trying to disengage a
coil of rope Mawson called out that he felt he was going. I ran
back and helped Mackay to keep a strain on Mawson's harness rope.
Mawson then said that he was all right. Probably at the time he
felt he was going the rope had suddenly cut back through the lid
of the crevasse and let him down for a distance of about a couple
of feet. Altogether he was about eight feet down below the level
of the snow lid. While I now held on to Mawson's harness rope
Mackay hurried back to the sledge, and with his Swedish knife cut
the lashing around the Alpine rope, and started uncoiling it,
making a bowline at the end in which Mawson could put his foot.
Meanwhile Mawson secured some ice crystals from the side of the
crevasse, and threw them up for examination. The Alpine rope
having been lowered, Mawson put his foot into the bowline and got
Mackay to haul his leg up as high as his bent knee would allow it
to go, then, calling to him to hold tight the rope, Mawson,
throwing the whole weight of his body on to it, raised himself
about eighteen inches by means of his arms so as to be able to
straighten his right leg. Meanwhile, I took in the slack of his
harness rope. He then called to me to hold tight the harness
rope, as he was going to rest his whole weight on that, so as to
take the strain off the Alpine rope. Mackay then was able to pull
the Alpine rope up about eighteen inches, which had the effect of
bending up Mawson's right leg as before. Mackay then held fast
the Alpine rope, and Mawson again straightened himself up on it,
resting his whole weight on that rope. Thus little by little he
was hoisted up to the under surface of the snow lid, but as his
harness rope had cut back a narrow groove in this snow lid
several feet from where the snow gave away under him Mawson now
found his head and shoulders pressing against the under side of
the snow lid, and had some difficulty in breaking through this in
order to get his head out. At last the top of his head emerged, a
sight for which Mackay and I were truly thankful, and presently
he was able to get his arms up, and soon his body followed, and
he got safely out on the near side of the crevasse. After this
episode we were extra cautious in crossing the crevasses, but the
ice was simply seamed with them. Twice when our sledge was being
dragged up ice-pressure ridges it rolled over sideways with one
runner in a crevasse, and once the whole sledge all but
disappeared into a crevasse, the snow lid of which had partly
collapsed under its weight. Had it gone down completely it would
certainly have dragged the three of us down with it, as it
weighed nearly one-third of a ton. It was clear that these
high-pressure ridges and numerous crevasses were caused now, not
by the Drygalski, but by the Nansen Glacier.</p>
<p>It was now somewhat foggy, but occasionally the fog and mist
lifted, and in the distance one caught glimpses of magnificent
cliffs of reddish brown granite, with wisps and wreathes of white
mist hanging around the summits. The view reminded me of the
Grampians in Scotland near Ossian's Cave at the Pass of Glencoe.
Later on in the day we saw in the dim light that we had before us
a long steep descent into an ice valley, which appeared to be
heavily crevassed at the bottom. As we were uncertain whether we
could get across it at this spot we left our tent and sledge, and
reconnoitred ahead, taking with us the Alpine rope and our
ice-axes. We found a way of crossing this valley, but could see
that the ice-surface ahead of us was apparently worse than ever.
We returned to our tent and sledge, and put up the tent, and
chopped lumps of ice off the glacier with which to load the
skirt, as no snow was available at the time. It was just
commencing to snow, and wind was freshening from the south-west.
We were now in a perfect labyrinth of crevasses and pressure
ridges. Snow continued falling heavily accompanied by a blizzard
wind for the rest of that day and the whole of the succeeding
night. Inside the tent we experienced some discomfort through the
dripping of water caused by the thawing snow. As usual during a
blizzard the temperature rose, and although the sun's heat rays
were partly intercepted by the falling snow quite sufficient
warmth reached the side of the tent nearest the sun to produce
this thaw. Pools of water lodged on the foot of our sleeping-bag,
but we were able to keep the head of it fairly dry by fixing up
our Burberry blouses and trousers across the poles on the inside
of the tent so as to make a temporary waterproof lining just
above our heads. We were all thoroughly exhausted, and slept
until about 7 a.m. the following day, December 20. By that time
the snow cleared off.</p>
<p>About six inches of snow had fallen, and was lying deeply
drifted in places. We dug away the drift snow from around the
sledges, and after the morning hoosh held a council of war. The
question was whether we should continue pulling on in the
direction of the nunatak rising from the Mount Nansen Glacier, or
whether we should retreat and try some other way which might lead
us to the plateau. Mackay was in favour of hauling ahead over the
Mount Nansen Glacier, while Mawson and I favoured retreat, and
trying a passage in some other direction.</p>
<p>At last we decided to retreat. Our fortunes now, so far as the
possibility of reaching the Magnetic Pole were concerned, seemed
at a low ebb. It was already December 20, and we knew that we had
to be back at our depôt on the Drygalski Glacier not later than
February 1 or 2, if there was to be a reasonable chance of our
being picked up by the <i>Nimrod</i>. We had not yet climbed more
than 100 ft. or so above sea-level, and even this little altitude
was due to our having climbed ice-pressure ridges, which from
time to time dipped down again to sea-level. We knew that we had
to travel at least 480 to 500 miles before we could hope to get
to the Magnetic Pole and back to our depôt, and there remained
only six weeks in which to accomplish this journey, and at the
same time we would have yet to pioneer a road up to the high
plateau. Now that everything was buried under soft snow it was
clear that sledging would be far slower and more laborious than
ever. We soon proved that this was the case, for after starting
the sledge it gathered masses of soft snow around it and under it
as it went, and at the end of 200 yards we had to halt for a
temporary rest, hoist the sledge up on one side and knock away
the masses of clogged snow from underneath it. This had to be
repeated every few hundred yards, and after we had gone half a
mile we decided to leave the sledge and go ahead with ice-axes
and Alpine rope to reconnoitre.</p>
<p>We started off in a south-westerly direction with the
intention of seeing whether the Mount Bellingshausen Glacier
slope would be more practicable for our sledges than the Mount
Nansen Glacier. We trudged through soft thawing snow with here
and there shallow pools of water on the surface of the ice. This,
of course, saturated our socks, which froze as the temperature
fell during the night. After proceeding about two and a half
miles we observed with the field-glasses that the foot of the
Mount Bellingshausen Glacier was not only steep but broken and
rugged. We decided to examine what appeared to be a narrow
stretch of snow mantling around the base of a granite mountain,
one of the offshoots from the Mount Larsen massif. After crossing
a good deal of pressure ice and crevasses, and floundering
amongst the boulders of old moraines we reached some shallow
lakes of thawed snow near the junction between the sea ice and
the foot of the snow slope for which we had been steering. In the
neighbourhood of the moraines, which here consisted of great
blocks of eruptive rock partly or wholly imbedded in ice, the
blocks became so warmed up by the sun's heat that they partially
thawed the ice around, and in some cases above them: and so when
one stepped near one of these blocks, or over a concealed block,
the ice gave way with a crash letting one down a depth of from
one to three feet. At one place, before reaching the shallow
lakes, we found quite a strong stream of water flowing just under
the surface of the ice. This was evidently supplied from thaw
water from the slopes near the shore-line.</p>
<p>After paddling, unwillingly, in the shallow lakes we reached
the foot of what proved now to be not a snow slope but a small
branch glacier. This was covered with a considerable depth of
soft newly drifted snow, and we found the ascent in consequence
very tiring as we sunk at each step in the soft snow over our
knees. At last we attained an altitude of 1200 ft. above
sea-level, and were then high enough to see that the upper part
of this branch glacier joined the Mount Bellingshausen Glacier at
about 800 ft. higher and some half mile further on. We were well
pleased with this discovery, but as the glacier front ascended
about 1500 ft. in less than a mile we did not look forward to the
task of getting our heavy sledge up this steep slope, encumbered
as it was with soft deep thawing snow.</p>

FROM THE SEA<br>
ICE TO THE PLATEAU. MOUNT LARSEN ON THE LEFT</small></p>
<p>On our return to the shore-line down the glacier slope we
discovered that it was slightly crevassed in places, though not
heavily so. At the foot of the glacier, and a short distance
towards our camp, we found a moraine gravel. This was intermixed
with a dark marine clay containing numerous remains of serpulæ,
pecten shells, bryozoa, foraminifera, &amp;c. Mackay also found a
perfect specimen of a solitary coral, allied to Delto-cyathus,
and also a Waldheimia. All these specimens were carefully
preserved and brought into camp. While we were collecting these
specimens we could hear the roar of many mountain torrents
descending the steep granite slopes of the great mountain mass to
the south of our branch glacier. Occasionally, too, we heard the
boom and crash of an avalanche descending from the high mountain
top. Such sounds were strange to our ears, accustomed so long to
the almost perfect solitude and silence of the Antarctic,
hitherto broken only by the bleating of baby seals and the call
of the penguins.</p>
<p>Mawson discovered in another part of the moraine, nearer to
our camp, a bright green mineral forming thin crusts on a very
pretty quartz and felspar porphyry. These we decided to examine
more carefully on the morrow. We were all thoroughly exhausted
after the day's work, and Mackay had a rather bad attack of
snow-blindness. For some time after we got into the sleeping-bag,
and before we dozed off, we could still hear the intermittent
roar of avalanches like the booming of distant artillery.</p>
<p>The following day, December 22, we picked our way with our
sledge cautiously amongst the crevasses and over the pressure
mounds, the traversing of which gave us some trouble in places,
and eventually reached a fairly good track along the ice parallel
to the moraine from which we had been collecting the day
previous. We found a large pool of thaw water on the surface of
the ice. This was fed by a sub-glacial stream coming from an old
rock moraine. We could hear this stream rolling the pebbles along
in its channel. At another point the moraine showed a remarkable
cone, which at first sight we took for a typical esker, but a
nearer examination revealed the fact that the whole cone, with
the exception of the exterior, was formed of solid ice with only
an outer coating of sand, mud and gravel associated with abundant
marine organisms similar to those collected by us the previous
day. We halted when we arrived opposite the green mineral
observed by Mawson the previous day. We collected a good deal of
this. At first sight we thought it was the common mineral
epidote, but its hardness and the fact that it had turned yellow,
where it was weathered, made this hypothesis untenable. The green
crusts formed by it were about one fourteenth to one-sixteenth of
an inch in thickness, and it was evidently fairly widely
distributed in that locality, as numerous large joint faces of
the quartz and felspar porphyry were completely coated with it. A
little further on we came upon an enormous silicious sponge,
eighteen inches by two feet in diameter, adhering firmly to one
of the moraine boulders. We secured specimens of this.</p>
<p>Altogether the locality was most fascinating, and we longed to
have been able to spend more time there. Amongst other
interesting problems was the question as to how the material of
the sea floor came to be uplifted here to a height of twenty to
thirty feet or more above sea-level, and as to how the marine
sediments came to be resting on an old conical surface of dense
ice. We tested the latter to see whether it was of salt-or of
fresh-water origin; it was not distinctly saline, though slightly
so&mdash;much as glacier ice would be if it were sprayed by the
sea. None of us could account for this curious phenomenon. It
seemed as though the marine muds had been subjected to
considerable pressure, as numbers of the fossils in it were
triturated and shattered. It is of course just possible that in
the forward movement of the Mount Nansen Glacier it may have
pushed up some of the sea bottom above sea-level, and still there
remains the question as to how masses of ice came to find their
way under the moraine sediments. It is possible that after an
extensive glaciation of this region the glacier ice from inland
spread over the spot where this moraine is now situated, but on
the retreat of the ice inland, while still a small thickness of
ice was left in this bay, a submergence ensued, and during that
submergence a marine mud was deposited over the ice together with
the larger organisms found in association with the mud. Then
there was an advance of the ice once more, and moraines of large
blocks of rock were laid down over the top of the moraine muds
and the relics of the ancient glacier ice. Then once more the ice
retreated to its present position leaving the moraine blocks and
moraine muds of the old ice in the relative situations
mentioned.</p>
<p>As we skirted the foot of the small branch glacier we noticed
several small puffs of snow near the top angle of the snow slope
which we proposed to escalade. Just as we were pulling our sledge
to the foot of this slope the puff of wind with drift snow
developed suddenly into a strong blizzard. We pulled in against
this with great difficulty for half an hour, then camped at the
foot of the slope. The blizzard with its heavy drift snow and the
occasional gleams of warm sunshine cast much drift over our tent
with accompanying thaw. Consequently inside the tent water
dripped heavily all over our clothing and sleeping-bag.
Fortunately we were just above the level of the thaw water of the
small lakes, but we could hear water trickling close underneath
our tent amongst the granite boulders of the moraines just under
the ice.</p>
<p>We were able now to economise fuel, as we could bale the water
out of these rock pools and streams for making our hoosh, tea and
cocoa. All that night the blizzard raged, and we thought any
moment that the tent would be ripped up from top to bottom. It
was getting very thin by this time and had already been
frequently repaired by Mackay and Mawson. On this occasion
several new rents started from near the top of the tent and
spread downwards. Moreover, the canvas cap of our tent was broken
by the force of the wind and the pressure of the drift snow.</p>
<p>The following day, about 7 a.m., I got up and dug away the
drift snow from the lee side of the tent, which was cramping our
feet and legs, and found that it was still snowing heavily
outside, and blowing hard as well. In the afternoon the blizzard
slacked off somewhat, and the drift nearly ceased. We got up
accordingly and had a meal. We halved our sledge load, repacked
the sledge, and by dint of great exertions dragged it up the
steep snow and ice slope to a height of 800 ft. above the sea.
This was done in the teeth of a mild but freshening blizzard. The
blizzard at last got too strong for us, so that we left the load
at the altitude mentioned and returned back to our tent with the
empty sledge.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="colpicD" id="colpicD"></a><img alt=""
src="1202761h-images/colpicD.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>D. A PARSELENE</small></p>
<p>We had been pleased to find that the blizzard, although it had
delayed us and damaged our tent, had proved a blessing in
disguise. It had not brought with it much fresh snow, but had
blown away most of the loose snow left by the preceding blizzard,
leaving behind it now a fairly hard snow surface suitable for
sledging.</p>
<p>Mackay's eyes, still suffering from the effects of
snow-blindness, were treated with a solution of thin tabloids
(laminæ) of sulphate of zinc and cocaine, with the result that
his eyes were much better the following day, December 25. This
day there was still a strong breeze coming off the plateau, and
sweeping over our tent. A little later in the morning the weather
became calm, and a glorious sunny day smiled upon us. Mawson and
Mackay repaired the rents in the tent, while I saw to repacking
of the sledge with the remaining half load, and collected some
geological specimens.</p>
<p>We started shortly before noon and commenced dragging up the
second part of our load to the accompaniment of the music of
murmuring streams. During our interval for lunch, Mawson was able
to get some theodolite angles. We had the great satisfaction,
when we turned in at 10 p.m. on Christmas Eve, to find that we
were above the uncomfortable zone of thaw, and everything around
us was once more crisp and dry, though cold. Our spirits, too,
mounted with the altitude. We were now over 1200 ft. above
sea-level.</p>

<h3>PROFESSOR DAVID'S NARRATIVE (<i>Continued</i>)</h3>
<p><b>THE</b> following day, December 25, was Christmas Day. When
I awoke, I noticed a pile of snow on top of the sleeping-bag
close to my head. At first, before I was fully awake, I imagined
that it was the moisture condensed from Mawson's breath. Then I
heard the gentle patter of snow-flakes, and, on turning my head
ill the direction in which the rustling proceeded, saw that the
wind had undermined the skirt of our tent, and was blowing the
snow in through a small opening it had made. Accordingly, I
slipped out and snowed up the skirt again, trampling the snow
down firmly. A plateau wind was now blowing with almost blizzard
force.</p>
<p>About two hours later we got up, and, after some trouble with
the Primus lamp on account of the wind, had our breakfast, but,
as the wind was blowing dead against us, we turned into the
sleeping-bag for a short time. It was nearly noon before the wind
died down, and we started off with our sledge, still relaying
with half loads, the day being now beautifully clear and sunny.
At the 1,300 ft. level we started our sledge meter again, having
lifted it off the ice while we were going up the steep slope. A
little further on we were able to put the whole of our load again
on to the sledge and so dispense with further relay work. This,
too, was a great blessing.</p>
<p>When we arrived at our spot for camping that night we had the
satisfaction of finding that we were over 2000 ft. above
sea-level, and that we had, in addition to the climbing,
travelled that day about four miles. The plateau wind had almost
gone, and once more we revelled in being not only high, but dry.
Having no other kind of Christmas gift to offer, Mawson and I
presented Mackay with some sennegrass for his pipe, his tobacco
having long ago given out. We slept soundly that Christmas
night.</p>
<p>On December 26 we observed dense dark snow clouds to the
north-east, and a little light snow commenced to fall, but
fortunately the weather cleared towards the afternoon. Mawson
lost one of his blue sweaters off the sledge, but he and Mackay
went back some distance and recovered it. Towards the afternoon
we found it necessary to cross a number of fairly large
crevasses. These were completed snowed over, and although we
frequently fell through up to our knees, we had no serious
trouble from them on this occasion. Some of them were from twenty
to thirty feet in width, and it was fortunate for us that the
snow lids were strong enough to carry safely the sledge and
ourselves. Mackay suggested, for greater security, fastening the
Alpine rope around Mawson, who was in the lead, and securing the
other end of it to the sledge. The rope was left just slack
enough to admit of the strain of hauling being taken by the
harness rope, hence Mawson had two strings to his bow in case of
being suddenly precipitated into a crevasse. This was a good
system, which we always adopted afterwards in crossing heavily
crevassed ice.</p>
<p>The following day, December 27, we decided to make a small
depôt of our ski-boots (as by this time it appeared we were
getting off the glacier ice on to hard snow and névé where we
should not require them) and also of all our geological
specimens, and about one day's food-supply, together with a small
quantity of oil&mdash;a supply for about two days in one of our
oil-cans. The following is a list of the provisions:</p>
<p class="margin2">Powdered cheese (enough for two meals).<br>
Tea (for four meals).<br>
Twenty-five lumps of sugar.<br>
Hoosh for one meal.<br>
Chocolate (for one and a half meals).<br>
Twelve biscuits.<br>
<br></p>
<p>We also left an empty biscuit tin into which we crammed our
ski-boots, and our three ice-axes, using one of them stuck
upright as a staff for a small blue flag to mark the depôt.
Mawson took some good bearings with the prismatic compass, and we
then proceeded on our way. This depôt we called the Larsen Depôt,
as it was close to one of the southern spurs of Mount Larsen.</p>
<p>All eyes were now strained, as we advanced with our sledge, to
see whether there was still any formidable range of mountains
ahead of us barring our path to the plateau. At one time it
seemed as though there was a high range in the dim distance, but
a careful examination and the field-glasses showed that this
appearance was due only to clouds. Our joy and thankfulness was
unbounded when we at last realised that apparently there was now
a fairly easy ascent of hard névé and snow on to the plateau.
That day we sledged a little over ten miles. During the night
there was a very strong radiant in the sky from about south-west
to north-east, with a movement of alto-stratus cloud from
north-west to south-east. Therefore, probably, this radiant was
due to formation of great rolls of cloud curled over by the
anti-trade wind as it pressed forward in a south-easterly
direction. The rolls of clouds were distinctly curved convexly
towards the south-east.</p>
<p>The following day, December 28, we travelled on
north-westwards in thick cloudy weather, at first quite calm. At
about 10 a.m. a breeze set in from the sea, spreading westwards
over the top of Mount Nansen over 8000 ft. above sea-level. Above
Nansen it met the upper current wind and was obviously deflected
by it in a south-easterly direction. Meanwhile, in the direction
of the coast the sky was very dark and lowering, and probably
snow was falling there. Remarkable pillars of cloud formed over
the Mount Larsen group. These were photographed by Mawson. We
passed over occasional patches of nearly bare glacier ice,
alternating with stretches of hard névé. When we camped that
evening we had sledged a little over ten miles, and a keen, cold
wind was blowing gently off the high plateau to our west.</p>
<p>The following day, December 29, was clear, calm and cold. At
noon a pretty strong wind was blowing off the plateau. The
surface of the snow was fairly strongly ridged with sastrugi. One
set was made by winds coming from between west-south-west and
west by north, the other by winds nearly north-westerly, or
between west-30°-north and west-40°-north. As this latter bearing
was not far off the direction in which we were travelling, we
were able from time to time to follow these minor sastrugi, which
were thus of considerable help to us in bringing over the
sastrugi more oblique to the direction in which we were
travelling.</p>
<p>The following day, December 30, Mounts Larsen and
Bellingshausen were disappearing below the horizon, and several
mountains were showing up clearly and sharply to the north of us,
the principal peaks of which were at first identified by us as
Mount New Zealand and Mount Queensland of Captain Scott's chart.
Later Mawson concluded that the western of the two at any rate
was new and unnamed.</p>
<p>There was still a strong plateau wind. We were now at an
altitude of about 4500 ft. Once more, as in winter time, our
breath froze into lumps of ice, cementing our Burberry helmets to
our beards and moustaches. In putting up the tent for lunch in
the strong plateau wind, it became badly torn near the cap piece.
This wind had started before midnight on the previous night, and
was blowing strongly until the afternoon, at from twelve to about
fifteen miles an hour. It carried along with it a little low
drift. The plateau wind did not die down until the evening. Our
distance travelled was eleven miles, and we were still travelling
on an up grade, being now nearly 5000 ft. above sea-level.</p>
<p>December 31 passed off without any special event other than
that after Mackay had repaired the tent in the morning it became
torn again at lunch-time when we were fitting it over the
tent-poles. Mawson took a fresh set of magnetic observations. We
camped for this purpose at the bottom of a wide undulation in the
névé surface. We were disappointed at his announcement that he
made out that the Magnetic Pole was further inland than had been
originally estimated. What with the observations with the
Lloyd-Creak dip circle, and the time occupied in repairing the
rents in the tent, we ran ourselves somewhat short of time for
our sledging that day, and did not camp until a little before
midnight. We were still dragging the sledge on an up grade; the
surface was softer and more powdery than before, and the sastrugi
heavier. Also since the previous Tuesday we had been obliged to
put ourselves on somewhat shorter rations than before, as we had
to take one-eighth of our rations out in order to form an
emergency food-supply in the event of our journey to and from the
Magnetic Pole proving longer than we originally anticipated.</p>
<p>That night, about a mile before reaching camp, we sighted to
the west of us, much to our surprise, some distinct ice falls.
This showed us that the snow desert over which we were travelling
had still some kind of creeping movement in it. A skua gull came
to visit us this New Year's Eve. He had been following us up for
some time in the distance, mistaking us, perhaps, for seals
crawling inland to die, as is not infrequently the habit of these
animals. We were now about eighty miles inland from the nearest
open water. Being disappointed of his high hopes, he left us
after that day and we saw him again no more. The run for the day
was about ten miles. We felt very much exhausted when we turned
into our sleeping-bag that night.</p>
<p>January 1, 1909 (New Year's Day), was a beautiful calm day
with a very light gentle plateau wind, with fairly high
temperature. The sky was festooned in the direction of Mount
Nansen with delicate wispy cirrus clouds converging in a
north-east direction. Later on, towards the evening, it was
evident that these cirrus clouds were strongly bent round from
south-west in a northerly direction. Possibly this bending with
the concave side to the west-north-west was due to the pressure
at a high level of the anti-trade wind blowing towards the
east-south-east. Mawson took observations for latitude and for
magnetic deviation at noon. He made our latitude at noon to be
74° 18'. That night Mawson gave us a grand hoosh and a rich pot
of cocoa in celebration of New Year's Day. We all thoroughly
enjoyed this meal after our exhausting march.</p>
<p>On January 2 we noticed that the sastrugi were gradually
swinging round into a direction a little north of west. The snow
was frequently soft in large patches, which made sledging very
heavy. We ascended altogether about 290 ft., but we crossed a
large number of broad undulations, the troughs of which were from
thirty to forty feet below their crests. These undulations
considerably increased the work of sledging, and the loose
patches of snow were so very soft and powdery that the runners of
our sledge sunk deeply into them, so that it was only with our
utmost efforts that we were able that day to finish our usual ten
miles. Again we were much exhausted when the time came for
camping. We were beginning to suffer, too, from hunger, and would
have liked more to drink if we could have afforded it. We talked
of what we would have drunk if we had had the chance. Mackay said
he would have liked to drink a gallon of buttermilk straight off;
Mawson would have preferred a big basin of cream; while I would
have chosen several pots of the best coffee with plenty of hot
milk.</p>
<p>We were still climbing on January 3, having ascended another
500 ft. It proved the heaviest day's sledging since we reached
the plateau. The snow was still softer than on the previous day,
and the surface was more undulating than ever, the troughs of the
undulations being about fifty feet below the crests. The sastrugi
themselves were from two to three feet in height. The crests of
the large undulations were usually formed of hard snow, the
strong winds having blow any loose material off them. This loose
material had accumulated to some depth in the troughs, and hence
made the wide patches of soft snow which made our sledge drag so
heavily as we crossed them. By dint of great efforts we managed
to finish our ten miles for that day.</p>
<p>The next day, January 4, we were pleased to find that there
was less up grade than on the previous day. We were now at an
altitude of over 6000 ft., and found respiration in the cold,
rarified air distinctly trying. It was not that we suffered
definitely from mountain sickness, but we felt weaker than usual
as the result, no doubt, of the altitude combined with the cold.
Towards evening, large clouds developed, much like the whale-back
clouds which we had often observed forming over Erebus about the
time of blizzards. Great rolls of cumulus spread rapidly from the
north-west towards the south-east, and we feared that a blizzard
was impending. On the whole the sledging was a little easier
to-day than the preceding day, and again we managed to do our ten
miles.</p>
<p>On the morning of January 5 we found the sky thickly overcast,
except to the south and the south-east, where clear strips of
blue were showing. We thought that snow was coming. The weather
was perfectly calm, comparatively warm, but the light dull. We
could still see the new inland mountain and Mount New Zealand
distinctly. The sun was so oppressively hot when it peeped out
from behind the clouds that one could feel it burning the skin on
one's hands.</p>
<p>The surface was more marked by sastrugi than ever, but on the
whole firm. We sledged ten miles. I will quote from my diary the
notes regarding some succeeding days.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 6.&mdash;To-day the weather was gloriously
fine. Bright, warm sunshine with a crisp, cold air in the early
morning and the weather almost calm. The pulling was rather heavy
during the afternoon; possibly the hot sun may have somewhat
softened the surface of the snow. This morning I left off my
crampons and put on a new pair of finnesko. These latter proved
somewhat slippery, and in falling heavily this afternoon over one
of the sastrugi I slightly strained some muscles on the inner
side of my left leg, just below the knee. This gave me a
considerable amount of pain for the rest of the journey. Mackay
lost all his stockings and socks off the bamboo pole of the
sledge, but was fortunate enough to recover them after walking
back over a mile on our tracks.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 7.&mdash;We were up at 5 a.m., when the
temperature was minus 13° Fahr. We were anxious to arrive at the
end of our first five miles in good time for Mawson to get a
meridian altitude, and take theodolite angles to the new mountain
and Mount New Zealand, which were now almost disappearing from
view below the horizon. Mawson made our latitude to-day 73° 43'.
This was one of the coldest days we had as yet experienced on the
plateau, the wind blowing from west by north. We all felt the
pulling very much to-day, possibly because it was still slightly
uphill, and probably partly on account of mountain lassitude. The
distance travelled was ten miles.</p>
<p><i>Friday, January</i> 8.&mdash;To-day, also, was bitterly
cold. The wind blew very fresh for some little time before noon
from a direction of about west by north, raising much low drift.
Our hands were frost-bitten several times when packing up the
sledge. The cold blizzard continued for the whole day. At lunch
time we had great difficulty in getting up the tent, which became
again seriously torn in the process. Our beards were frozen to
our Burberry helmets and Balaclavas, and we had to tear away our
hair by the roots in order to get them off. We continued
travelling in the blizzard after lunch. Mawson's right cheek was
frost-bitten, and also the tip of my nose. The wind was blowing
all the time at an angle of about 45° on the port bow of our
sledge. We just managed to do our ten miles and were very
thankful when the time came for camping.</p>
<p>The following day, January 9, a very cold plateau wind was
still blowing, the horizon being hazy with low drift. We were now
completely out of sight of any mountain ranges, and were toiling
up and down amongst the huge billows of a snow sea. The silence
and solitude were most impressive. About 10.30 a.m. a well-marked
parhelion, or mock sun, due to floating ice crystals in the air,
made its appearance. It had the form of a wide halo with two mock
suns at either extremity of the equator of the halo parallel to
the horizon and passing through the real sun. Mawson was able to
make his magnetic deviation observation with more comfort, as
towards noon the wind slackened and the day became gloriously
bright and clear. In the afternoon it fell calm.</p>
<p>We were feeling the pinch of hunger somewhat, and as usual our
talk, under these circumstances, turned chiefly on restaurants,
and the wonderfully elaborate dinners we would have when we
returned to civilisation. Again we accomplished our ten miles,
and were now at an altitude of over 7000 ft.</p>
<p>January 10 was also a lovely day, warm and clear; the snow
surface was good and we travelled quickly. There was a strong
"Noah's Ark" structure in the high-level cirrus clouds, there
being a strong radiant point respectively in the north-west and
south-east, and this made us somewhat apprehensive that we were
in for another blizzard. These cirrus clouds were also strongly
curved with the concave side of the curve facing the north-east.
We thought this curve was, perhaps, due to the anti-trade wind
bending round in a direction following that of the curve in the
wisps of cirrus.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 11.&mdash;We were up about 7 a.m., the
temperature at that time being minus 12° Fahr. It was a cold day
to-day, and we had a light wind nearly southerly. At first it
blew from between south and south-south-east; this gradually
freshened at lunch time and veered towards the west. It then
returned again more towards the south-south-east. Mawson had a
touch of snow-blindness in his right eye. Both he and Mackay
suffered much through the skin of their lips peeling off, leaving
the raw flesh exposed. Mawson, particularly, experienced great
difficulty every morning in getting his mouth opened, as his lips
were firmly glued together by congealed blood.</p>
<p>That day we did eleven miles, the surface being fairly firm,
and there being no appreciable general up grade now, but only
long-ridged undulations, with sastrugi. We noticed that these
sastrugi had now changed direction, and instead of trending from
nearly west, or north of west, eastwards, now came more from the
south-east directed towards the north-west. This warned us that
we might anticipate possibly strong head winds on our return
journey, as our course at the time was being directed almost
north-west, following from time to time the exact bearing of the
horizontal magnetic compass. The compass was now very sluggish,
in fact the theodolite compass would scarcely work at all. This
pleased us a good deal, and at first we all wished more power to
it; then amended the sentiment and wished less power to it. The
sky was clear, and Mawson got good magnetic meridian observations
by means of his very delicately balanced horizontal moving needle
in his Brunton transit instrument.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 12.&mdash;The sky to-day was overcast, the
night having been calm and cloudy. A few snowflakes and fine ice
crystals were falling. The sun was very hot and it somewhat
softened the snow surface, thereby increasing of course the
difficulty of sledging. We sledged to-day ten and three-quarter
miles.</p>
<p>The evening, after hoosh, Mawson, on carefully analysing the
results set forth in the advance copy of the <i>Discovery</i>
Expedition Magnetic Report, decided that although the matter was
not expressly so stated, the Magnetic Pole, instead of moving
easterly, as it had done in the interval between Sabine's
observations in 1841 and the time of the Discovery expedition in
1902. was likely now to be travelling somewhat to the north-west.
The results of dip readings taken at intervals earlier in the
journey also agreed with this decision. It would be necessary
therefore to travel further in that direction than we had
anticipated in order to reach our goal. This was extremely
disquieting news, for all of us as we had come almost to the
limit of our provisions, after making allowance for enough to
take us back on short rations to the coast. In spite of the
anxiety of the situation extreme weariness after sledging enabled
us to catch some sleep.</p>
<p>The following morning, January 13, we were up about 6 a.m. A
light snow was falling, and fine ice crystals made the sky hazy.
There was a light wind blowing from about south-south-east. About
8 a.m. the sun peeped through with promise of a fine day. We had
had much discussion during and after breakfast as to our future
movements. The change in the position of the Pole necessitated of
course a change in our plans. Mawson carefully reviewed his
observations as to the position of the Magnetic Pole, and decided
that in order to reach it we would need to travel for another
four days. The horizontally moving needle had now almost ceased
to work. We decided to go on for another four days and started
our sledging. It was a cold day with a light wind. The
temperature at about 10.30 a.m. being minus 6° Fahr. At noon
Mawson took a magnetic reading with the Lloyd-Creak dip circle,
which was now fifty minutes off the vertical, that is, 89° 10'.
At noon the latitude was just about 73° South. The sastrugi were
now longer and higher than usual, and there were two distinct
sets. The strongest sastrugi trended from south to north; a
subordinate set from south-east to north-west. That day we
sledged thirteen miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 14.&mdash;The day was gloriously clear and
bright with a warm sun. A gentle wind was blowing from about
south-south-east, and there was a little cumulus cloud far ahead
of us over the horizon. The surface of the snow over which we
were sledging was sparkling with large reconstructed ice
crystals, about half an inch in width and one-sixteenth of an
inch in thickness. These crystals form on this plateau during
warm days when the sun's heat leads to a gentle upward streaming
of the cold air with a small amount of moisture in it from
beneath. Under these influences combined with the thawing of the
surface snow, these large and beautiful ice crystals form rapidly
in a single day. We observe that after every still sunny day a
crop of these crystals develops on the surface of the névé, and
remains there until the next wind blows them off. They form a
layer about half an inch in thickness over the top of the névé.
In the bright sunlight the névé, covered with these sheets of
bright reflecting ice crystals, glittered like a sea of diamonds.
The heavy runners of our sledge rustled gently as they crushed
the crystals by the thousand. It seemed a sacrilege. The sastrugi
were large and high, and our sledge bumped very heavily over them
with a prodigious rattling of our aluminium cooking-gear. It was
clear that the blizzard winds blow over this part of the plateau
at times with great violence. Apparently all the winds in this
quarter, strong enough to form sastrugi, blow from south or west
of south or from the south-east. Our run to-day was twelve miles
one hundred and fifty yards.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 15.&mdash;We were up to-day at 6 a.m. and found
a cold southerly breeze blowing, the temperature being minus 19°
Fahr. at 6.30 a.m. Mawson got a good latitude determination
to-day, 72° 42'.</p>
<p>At about twenty minutes before true noon Mawson took magnetic
observations with the dip circle, and found the angle now only
fifteen minutes off the vertical, the dip being 89° 45'. We were
very much rejoiced to find that we were now so close to the
Magnetic Pole. The observations made by Bernacchi, during the two
years of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition's sojourn at their
winter quarters on Ross Island, showed that the amplitude of
daily swing of the magnet was sometimes considerable. The
compass, at a distance from the Pole, pointing in a slightly
varying direction at different times of the day, indicates that
the polar centre executes a daily round of wanderings about its
mean position. Mawson considered that we were now practically at
the Magnetic Pole, and that if we were to wait for twenty-four
hours taking constant observations at this spot the Pole would,
probably, during that time, come vertically beneath us. We
decided, however, to go on to the spot where he concluded the
approximate mean position of the Magnetic Pole would lie. That
evening the dip was 89° 48'. The run for the day was fourteen
miles.</p>
<p>From the rapid rate at which the dip had been increasing
recently, as well as from a comparison of Bernacchi's magnetic
observations, Mawson estimated that we were now about thirteen
miles distant from the probable mean position of the South
Magnetic Pole. He stated that in order to accurately locate the
mean position possibly a month of continuous observation would be
needed, but that the position he indicated was now as close as we
could locate it. We decided accordingly, after discussing the
matter fully that night, to make a forced march of thirteen miles
to the approximate mean position of the Pole on the following
day, put up the flag there, and return eleven miles back on our
tracks the same day. Our method of procedure on this journey of
twenty-four miles is described in the journal of the following
day.</p>
<p><i>Saturday, January</i> 16.&mdash;We were up at about 6 a.m.
and after breakfast we pulled on our sledge for two miles. We
then depôted all our heavy gear and equipment with the exception
of the tent, sleeping-bag, Primus stove and cooker, and a small
quantity of food, all of which we placed on the sledge together
with the legs of the dip circle and those of the theodolite to
serve as marks. We pulled on for two miles and fixed up the legs
of the dip circle to guide us back on our track, the compass
moving in a horizontal plane being now useless for keeping us on
our course. At two miles further we fixed up the legs of the
theodolite, and two miles further put up our tent, and had a
light lunch. We then walked five miles in the direction of the
Magnetic Pole so as to place us in the mean position calculated
for it by Mawson, 72° 25' South latitude, 155° 16' East
longitude. Mawson placed his camera so as to focus the whole
group, and arranged a trigger which would be released by means of
a string held in our hands so as to make the exposure by means of
the focal plane shutter. Meanwhile, Mackay and I fixed up the
flag-pole. We then bared our heads and hoisted the Union Jack at
3.30 p.m. with the words uttered by myself in conformity with
Lieutenant Shackleton's instructions, "I hereby take possession
of this area now containing the Magnetic Pole for the British
Empire." At the same time I fired the trigger of the camera by
pulling the string. Thus the group were photographed in the
manner shown on the plate. The blurred line connected with my
right hand represents the part of the string in focus blown from
side to side by the wind. Then we gave three cheers for his
Majesty the King.</p>

<p align="center"><small>51. POOL OF THAW WATER FORMED BY THE
EMERGENCE OF<br>
A SUB-GLACIAL STREAM SOUTH-EAST OF MOUNT LARSEN</small></p>
<p>There was a pretty sky at the time to the north of us with low
cumulus clouds, and we speculated at the time as to whether it
was possible that an arm of the sea, such as would produce the
moisture to form the cumulus, might not be very far distant. In
view of our subsequent discovery of a deep indent in the
coast-line in a southerly direction beyond Cape North, it is
possible that the sea at this point is at no very considerable
distance.</p>
<p>The temperature at the time we hoisted the flag was exactly 0°
Fahr. It was an intense satisfaction and relief to all of us to
feel that at last after so many days of toil, hardship and danger
we had been able to carry out our leader's instructions, and to
fulfil the wish of Sir James Clarke Ross that the South Magnetic
Pole should be actually reached, as he had already in 1831
reached the North Magnetic Pole. At the same time we were too
utterly weary to be capable of any great amount of exultation. I
am sure the feeling the was uppermost in all of us was one of
devout and heartfelt thankfulness to the kind Providence which
had so far guided our footsteps in safety to that goal. With a
fervent "Thank God" we all did a right-about turn, and as quick a
march as tired limbs would allow back in the direction of our
little green tent in the wilderness of snow.</p>
<p>It was a weary tramp back over the hard and high sastrugi and
we were very thankful when at last we saw a small dark cone,
which we knew was our tent, rising from above the distant snow
ridges. On reaching the tent we each had a little cocoa, a
biscuit and a small lump of chocolate. We then sledged slowly and
wearily back, picking up first the legs of the theodolite, then
those of the dip circle, and finally reached our depôt a little
before 10 p.m.</p>
<p>In honour of the event we treated ourselves that night to a
hoosh, which though modest was larger in volume than usual, and
was immensely enjoyed. Mawson repacked the sledge after hoosh
time, and we turned into the sleeping-bag faint and weary, but
happy with the great load of apprehension of possible failure,
that had been hanging over us for so many weeks, at last removed
from our minds. We all slept soundly after twenty-four miles of
travel.</p>

<p><b>I CALLED</b> the camp at a little before 10 a.m. the
following morning. We now discussed the situation and our chances
of catching the <i>Nimrod</i>, if she came in search of us along
the coast in the direction of our depôt on the Drygalski Glacier.
We had agreed, before we decided to do the extra four days' march
to the shifted position of the Magnetic Pole, that on our return
journey we would do not less than thirteen miles a day. At the
Magnetic Pole we were fully 260 statute miles distant, as the
skua flies, from our depôt on the Drygalski Glacier. As we had
returned eleven of these miles on the day previous we still had
249 miles to cover. It was now January 17, and the <i>Nimrod</i>
was due to start to search for us on February 1. As there was of
course plenty of sunlight day and night, we thought it quite
possible that she might be up to the Drygalski Glacier on
February 2&mdash;possibly on the morning of that day. We
accordingly decided to try and make back to our Drygalski depôt
by February 1. This gave us fifteen days. Consequently we would
have to average sixteen and two-thirds miles a day in order to
reach the coast in the time specified. This of course did not
allow of any delay on account of blizzards, and we had seen from
the evidence of the large sastrugi that blizzards of great
violence must occasionally blow in these quarters, and from the
direction of the sastrugi during our last few days' march it was
clear that the dominant direction of the blizzard would be
exactly in our teeth. The prospect, therefore, of reaching our
depôt in the specified time did not appear bright. Providentially
we had most beautiful and glorious weather for our start on
January 17. It remained fine for the whole day, and we were
greatly favoured by a light wind which now blew from between
north-west and west-north-west&mdash;a perfectly fair wind for
our journey. In fact the wind changed direction with us. It had
helped us by blowing from the south-east, just before we reached
the Magnetic Pole, and now it was blowing in the opposite
direction, helping us home. That day, in spite of the late start,
we sledged sixteen miles.</p>
<p>On January 18 the weather again was fine, and we had a hard
day's sledging. Unfortunately Mawson's left leg became very lame
and pained him a good deal. There was a strong radiant in the
clouds towards the north-west, and we were a little apprehensive
of the wind in consequence. Our run for the day was sixteen miles
two hundred yards. This was the end of my week's cooking, and we
were able to indulge that night in a fairly abundant hoosh, also
in very milky and sweet cocoa, and Mackay admitted that he
actually felt moderately full after it for the first time since
we had left the Drygalski Depôt.</p>
<p>The following day, January 19, we boiled the hypsometer at our
camp, and found the level to be about 7350 ft. above the sea. The
boiling-point was 196.75° Fahr. There was a cold fresh wind
blowing from the south-east, a head wind for us, the temperature
at the time being minus 11° Fahr. There were still low cumulus
clouds to the north of us. The wind freshened in the afternoon to
a mild blizzard, and we found pulling against it very severe
work. That morning we had quite an unusual diversion. Mawson, who
is a bold culinary experimenter, being messman for the week,
tried the experiment of surreptitiously introducing a lump of
sugar into the pemmican. Mackay detected an unusual flavour in
the hoosh, and cross-questioned Mawson severely on the subject.
Mawson admitted a lump of sugar. Mackay was thereupon roused to a
high pitch of indignation, and stated that this awful state of
affairs was the result of going out sledging with "two
foreigners". This mild blizzard partly obliterated our old sledge
tracks by piling over them new sastrugi of fine hard snow. We had
a great struggle that day to make our sixteen miles, but
fortunately the blizzard slackened off towards 9 p.m., and we
just managed it.</p>
<p>Owing to some miscalculation, for which I was responsible, we
discovered that we had no tea for this week, our sixth week out,
unless we took it out of the tea-bag for the seventh week.
Accordingly we halved the tea in the seventh week bag, and
determined to collect our old tea-bags at each of our old camps
as we passed them, and boil these bags together with the small
pittance of fresh tea. And here I may mention the tastes of the
party in the matter of tea somewhat differed. Mackay liked his
tea thoroughly well and long boiled, whereas Mawson and I liked
it made by just bringing the water to the boil; as soon as we
smelt the aroma of tea coming from underneath the outer lid of
the cooker we used to shut off the Primus lamp immediately and
decant the tea into the pannikins. Mackay had always objected to
this procedure when we were sledging along the sea ice where
water boils at about 212° Fahr.; now, however, he had a strong
scientific argument in his favour for keeping the pot boiling for
a few minutes after the tea had been put in. He pointed out that
at our present altitude water boiled at just over 196° Fahr., a
temperature which he maintained was insufficient to extract the
proper juices and flavour from the tea, unless the boiling was
very much prolonged. Mawson, however, averred&mdash;on chemical
and physical grounds&mdash;that with the diminished atmospheric
pressure certain virtuous constituents of the tea could be
extracted at a lower temperature. The discussion was highly
scientific and exhilarating, though not very finite. It was
agreed as a compromise to allow the boiling to continue for three
or four minutes after the water had come to the boil before the
tea was poured out. As in our progress coastwards we were
continually coming upon more old tea-bags at our old camps, and
always collected these and did not throw away any that had been
used before we soon had quite an imposing collection of muslin
bags with old tea leaves, and with the thorough boiling that they
now got there was a strong flavour of muslin superadded to that
of old tea. Nevertheless this drink was nectar.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 20.&mdash;We were still able to-day to follow
our sledge tracks, which was a great blessing, the magnetic
needle being of so little use to us. We had the wind slightly
against us bringing up a little low drift. Again we made our
sixteen-mile run, though with great difficulty, for the wind had
been blowing freshly all day on our starboard bow.</p>
<p>In view of the good progress that we had made, and after
carefully calculating out the provisions left over, Mawson, who
was at this time messman, proposed that we should return to
nearly full rations, as we were becoming much exhausted through
insufficient food. This proposal was, of course, hailed with
delight.</p>
<p>On <i>January</i> 21 there was a light wind with low
temperature, clear sky and hot sun, which combined to consolidate
the surface over which we were sledging. By this time Mackay and
Mawson's raw lips, which had been cracked and bleeding for about
a fortnight previously, were now much better. Mawson's lame leg
had also improved. Again we did our sixteen-mile run.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 22.&mdash;We were up soon after 7 a.m. It was a
clear day with bright sunshine. The wind started soon after 5
a.m., constantly freshening, as it usually did in this part of
the plateau, till about 3 p.m. Then it gradually died down by
about 10 p.m. The temperature at 7.15 a.m. was minus 20° Fahr.,
and at this altitude we found the wind at this temperature very
trying. To-day we had to sledge over a great deal of pie-crust
snow, which was very fatiguing. Again we did sixteen miles. We
had since the day before yesterday lost our old sledge tracks.
Mackay earned a pound of tobacco, to be given him when we
returned to civilisation, by being the first to make the "land
fall"&mdash;new mountain, west of Mount New Zealand&mdash;which
showed out now in the far distance very faintly a little to the
left of our course. It was a welcome sight to all of us. To-day
we sledged fifteen miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 23.&mdash;The weather was bright and cold with
a light southerly wind. This day was very fatiguing, the sledging
being over patches of soft snow and pie-crust snow. At the same
time we were conscious now that although we were sledging up and
down wide undulations we were on the whole going down hill, and
the new mountain was already showing up as an impressive massif.
The air was cold and piercing. Mawson's right leg was still
painful. That night we were all very much exhausted, and were
obliged to allow ourselves fully eight hours sleep. Our run was
sixteen miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 24.&mdash;To-day we had more heavy sledging
over a lot of pie-crust snow and soft snow. The wind was blowing
somewhat against us at about twelve miles an hour, the
temperature being minus 4 Fahr. in the afternoon. A low drift was
sweeping in waves over the snow desert; it was a desolate scene.
Later in the day we were cheered by the sight of Mount
Baxter.</p>
<p>Towards evening we had some discussion as to whether we were
following approximately our old outgoing tracks. Mackay thought
we were nearer to the new mountain than before, I thought we were
further to the south-west, Mawson, who was leading, contended
that we were pretty well on our old course. Just then I
discovered that we were actually on our old sledge tracks, which
showed up plainly for a short distance between the newly formed
sastrugi. This spoke volumes for Mawson's skill as a navigator.
Distance sledged sixteen miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 25.&mdash;It was blowing a mild blizzard. We
estimated at lunch time that we were about eighty and a half
miles distant now from our Mount Larsen Depôt. The temperature
during the afternoon was minus 3° Fahr. We all felt, as usual,
much fatigued after the day's sledging. For the past four or five
days we each took an Easton syrup tabloid for the last stage but
one before reaching camp, and this certainly helped to keep us
going. This evening the blizzard died down about 8 p.m., and
Mount Nansen was sighted just before we camped.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 26.&mdash;We lost our old sledge tracks again
to-day. The weather turned cloudy in the afternoon, and the light
was very bad. We now reached a surface of hard marble-like névé,
which descended by short steep slopes. We did not at first
realise that we were about to descend what we had termed the Ice
Falls on the outward journey. Every now and then the sledge would
take charge and rush down this marble staircase, bumping very
heavily over the steps. Mawson and I frequently came heavy
croppers. Mawson put on crampons outside his finnesko to enable
him to get a grip of the slippery surface, but my crampons were
frozen so hard and so out of shape that I was unable to get them
on, so I followed behind and steadied the sledge as it continued
bumping its way down the marble steps. At last we reached once
more a flattened surface and camped. Our run for the day was
fourteen and a half miles.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 27.&mdash;This morning we all felt very slack
after the night spent in the closely covered sleeping bag, the
sky at the time being cloudy. Under these circumstances, as we
now had come down from our highest altitude by about 4000 ft.,
and the temperature of course, had somewhat risen, we felt
stifled and depressed. During the morning fine snow fell and the
weather was quite thick to the south and east of us. Mawson
steered us by the trend of the sastrugi. As the day wore on, the
weather cleared up and we had a good view of the new mountain,
Mount New Zealand, and Mount Baxter. The pulling at first was
very hard work, being up-hill, but later we had a good run down
hill to the spot where we camped for lunch. After lunch we
sledged down a still steeper slope, the sledge occasionally take
charge. At this spot Mackay partially fell into a crevasse.
To-day we were much cheered by the sight at last of Mount Larsen.
By the time we reached the spot where we camped that night we had
a good clear view of Larsen. The distance travelled was sixteen
miles. We were now only about forty miles from our Mount Larsen
Depôt.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 28.&mdash;We turned out of the sleeping-bag
to-day at about 6.30 a.m. A blizzard was blowing, and after
breakfast we had much difficulty in the cold wind in getting up
the mast and sail. Mackay, who usually did the greater part of
this work, got his hands rather badly frost-bitten before our
preparations were completed. We used the thick green canvas
floorcloth as a sail; the tent-poles served us for a mast, and a
piece of bamboo did duty as a yard.</p>
<p>The wind was blowing at, perhaps, about twenty-five miles an
hour, and as soon as we started the sledge, it began to travel at
such a hot pace that Mackay and Mawson, with their long legs,
were kept walking at the top of their speed, while I, with my
shorter ones, was kept on a jog trot. Occasionally, in an extra
strong puff of wind, the sledge took charge. On one of these
occasions it suddenly charged into me from behind, knocked my
legs from under me, and nearly juggernauted me. I was quickly
rescued from this undignified position under the sledge runners
by Mawson and Mackay. We had now arrived at a part of the plateau
where the monotonous level or gently undulating surface gave
place to sharp descents. It was necessary in these cases for one
of us to untoggle from the front of the sledge and to toggle on
behind, so as to steer and steady it. About noon, when we were in
full career, the bow of the sledge struck one of the high
sastrugi obliquely and the sledge was capsized heavily, but
fortunately nothing was broken. After righting the sledge we
camped for lunch.</p>
<p>At lunch, with a faint hope of softening the stern heart of
our messman for the week&mdash;Mackay&mdash;and inducing him to
give us an extra ration of food, I mildly informed him that it
was my birthday. He took the hint and we all fared sumptuously at
lunch and dinner that day. The day's run was twenty miles. It had
been one of the most fatiguing days that we had as yet
experienced, and we were all utterly exhausted when we turned
into our sleeping-bag at 8.30 p.m.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 29.&mdash;We were up at about 8 a.m., and found
that the plateau wind was still blowing at a speed of about
fifteen miles an hour. After our experience of the preceding day
we decided that we would not make sail on the sledge, and as a
matter of fact, found that pulling the sledge in the ordinary way
was far less wearing than the sailing had proved the preceding
day. We pulled on steadily hour after hour, and Mounts Nansen and
Larsen grew every moment clearer and larger, and we began to hope
that we might be able to reach our depôt at Mount Larsen that
night. After we had sledged about ten miles, descending at a
gentle grade all the way, we found that there was a slight up
grade in the snow surface towards the foot of Mount Larsen, but
it was not steep enough to cause us any trouble. But later in the
day Mawson's sprained leg caused him a good deal of pain, and we
had almost decided to camp at a point nearly twenty miles from
our preceding camp, when Mackay's sharp eyes sighted, at a
distance of about a mile, our little blue flag, tied to the
ice-axe at our depôt. We soon reached the depôt, fixed up the
tent, had a good hoosh, and turned into the sleeping-bag past
midnight.</p>
<p>We were up at 9 a.m. on January 30. The day was sunny, but
ominous clouds were gathering overhead as well as to the south.
After breakfast we collected the material at our depôt, chiefly
ski-boots, ice-axes, oil, a little food, and geological
specimens, and loaded these on to our sledge. We found that,
owing to the alternate thawing and freezing of the snow at our
depôt, our ski-boots were almost filled with solid ice. The work
of chipping out this ice proved a slow and tedious job, and we
did not get started until about 11 a.m. Soon after we got going
we found ourselves for a time in a meshwork of crevasses. These
were from a foot up to about twenty feet in width. Nearly all of
them were roofed over with a hard layer of snow. The only visible
evidence of the existence of a crevasse was a slight depression
in the snow surface at the inner edges of the two walls bounding
the crevasses, the whole of the snow roof or lid being slightly
counter-sunk below the general level of the surrounding snow
surface.</p>
<p>This, however, was not always the case, and crevasses not
infrequently existed entirely concealed from view under a
perfectly smooth hard snow surface. On account of the fact, as
already explained, that the snow lids were thinner next to the
walls of the crevasse, and thicker towards a position central
between the walls, we always used to take care, if we could see
the little depression in the snow surface&mdash;a sure indication
of a crevasse&mdash;not to put our foot down near the edge of the
depression, but to alight on the snow lid some feet away from the
crevasse wall.</p>
<p>On stepping out on to one of these snow lids a large piece
suddenly gave way under me, and I was instantly precipitated into
the chasm below, but fortunately caught the Alpine rope under my
arm as I was falling; this broke the force of the jerk on my
sledge harness. I was down about six feet below the snow lid, and
Mawson and Mackay holding on to the harness and Alpine ropes
which were supporting me, I was able to climb out quickly, and we
resumed our journey. Shortly after this, and after crossing a
number of other crevasses, we discovered that the wheel of our
sledge meter had disappeared. Probably it had got into one of the
crevasses, and gone to the bottom. As we were now so close to the
end of our journey, the loss of this, which earlier in our
travels would have been a serious disaster, was not of much
importance. We had run about eight miles before this lunch,
previous to the loss of our sledge meter wheel. At lunch-time
Mawson compounded a wonderful new hoosh made out of seal liver,
pounded up with a geological hammer, and mixed with crushed
biscuit.</p>
<p>We had some discussion as to whether it would be better to
descend on to the sea ice by the old track up which we had come,
which we termed Backstairs Passage, or make down the main Larsen
Glacier to the point where it junctioned with the Drygalski
Glacier. Mackay was in favour of the former, Mawson and I of the
latter. Mackay thought the devil one knew was better than the
devil one didn't know, while Mawson and I feared that during the
thaw, which was rapidly breaking up the sea ice at the time when
we were ascending the plateau, the ice might have gone away from
the base of Backstairs Passage right up to the steep granite
cliffs of the coast. Had this been the case, and had we descended
by our old route, we should have had to retrace our steps and
become involved in a very arduous uphill piece of sledging
necessitating an ascent of at least 1000 to 1500 ft. in a
distance of a little over a mile. As subsequent events proved,
Mackay was right and we were wrong.</p>
<p>We held on down the main glacier with the imposing cliffs and
slopes of dark-red granite and blackish eruptive rock intermixed
with it close on our left. Mawson's leg was now so bad that it
was only with considerable pain and difficulty that he could
proceed, and both Mackay's and my eyes were affected a good deal
by snow-blindness and were painful. We found as we advanced that
at about six miles easterly from our lunch camp, the surface of
the Mount Larsen Glacier descended at a very steep angle.
Somewhat ahead to the right it was clear that, where it
junctioned with the Drygalski Glacier, it was seamed by enormous
crevasses and traversed by strong pressure ridges. We held on
with our sledge on a course which took us close to the north side
of the glacier. At last the descent became so steep that it was
with the utmost difficulty that we could hold the sledge back and
prevent its charging down the slope. We halted here and Mackay
went ahead to reconnoitre. Presently he came back and said that
the narrow strip of snow covering the glacier ice, near its
contact with the rocky cliffs on our left, was continuous right
down to the bottom of the slope, and he thought it was
practicable, if we made rope brakes for the runners on our
sledge, to lower it down this steep slope in safety. He fixed on
some brakes of brown tarred rope by just twisting the rope
spirally around the sledge runners. We then cautiously started
the sledge down the steepest bit of the slope, all of us ready to
let go in case the sledge took charge. The rope brake worked
wonders, and it was even necessary to put a slight pull on the
sledge in places in order to get it down the steep snow surface.
We had left the great crevasses and ice falls near the junction
of the Mount Larsen and Drygalski Glaciers a little to our
right.</p>
<p>We now found ourselves on an ice-surface quite unlike anything
which we had hitherto experienced. In the foreground were some
small frozen lakes close to the foot of the granite hills; on the
far side of the lakes were beautiful glacial moraines. All around
the lakes, and for a considerable distance up the ice slopes
descending towards them, the surface of the ice was formed of a
series of large thin anastomosing curved plates of ice. These
were pieced together in such a way as to form a pattern on a
large scale resembling the cups of some of the recent compound
corals, or the ancient extinct form known to geologists as
<i>Alveolites</i>. These curved ice plates or tiles sloped at an
angle of about 45°, and formed, of course, an immense obstruction
to sledging, as their sharp edges caught and held our sledge
runners. We found, too, that it was very distressing travelling
over this extraordinary surface, which, from a scenic point of
view, was exquisitely beautiful. As we stepped forwards, out feet
usually crashed through the ice tiles, and our legs were imbedded
in the formation up to our knees. Frequently, under these
circumstances, we would stumble forwards, and had some difficulty
in dragging our legs out. It was like sledging over a wilderness
of glass cucumber-frames set up at an angle of 45°. Another
moment one would find the tiles thick enough and strong enough to
support one, but their surfaces being at an angle of 45° to the
horizontal, our feet would slip down them sideways and we ran an
imminent risk of spraining our ankles. At every step we took we
did not know until after the event which of the above two
experiences would follow.</p>
<p>After sledging for a short distance over surfaces of this
kind, sloping somewhat steeply to the small lakes, we decided to
camp on the pale green ice of one of these lakes. Mawson tested
this ice and found that it was strong enough to hold, though
evidently of no great thickness. We sledged along this lake for a
few hundred yards to its north-east end. There was a little snow
here which would do for loading the skirt of our tent. By this
time the sky was thickly overcast. We fixed up the tent, chopping
little holes in the surface of the smooth ice, in which to socket
the ends of the tent-poles, and while Mackay cooked, Mawson and I
snowed the skirt. This was subsequent to a little reconnoitring
which we each did. It was 2 a.m. before we camped on the lake
ice, and 4 a.m. before we turned into our sleeping-bag.</p>
<p>Close to our tent was the most beautiful lateral moraine which
we had yet discovered. It was formed of blocks of bright red
granite, together with quartz porphyries with much rusty stain
due to oxidation of iron pyrites, and masses of dark brown rocks,
more basic, perhaps of an intermediate character between granite
and diorite. We found that immediately to the right of us, in an
easterly direction&mdash;that is, directly between us and our
depôt on the Drygalski Glacier&mdash;were great pressure ridges
of ice, and a vast entanglement of crevasses. In fact, in that
direction the glacier seemed impassable. The only possible outlet
for us with our sledge appeared to be close alongside of the
lateral moraine at the point where the glacier ice joined it.
Even this route was obviously a very difficult one, and we
decided before we turned in that on the morrow we should have to
unload our sledge and make a portage, or a plurality of portages.
The ice on the small lake on which we were camped was only
between two and three inches thick, and had obviously formed
quite recently after the thaw. It commenced to thaw now under the
influence of the warmth of our sleeping-bag, as we lay in it, and
we found shallow pools of water all around us when we awoke the
next morning.</p>
<p><i>January</i> 31.&mdash;We were up about 11 a.m., having
slept soundly after the very exhausting work of our previous
day's sledging. During the night it had snowed heavily, there
being fully from three to four inches of newly fallen snow
covering everything around us, and it was still snowing while we
were having breakfast. After breakfast the snow nearly ceased,
and we took half the load off our sledge and started with the
remainder to try and work a passage out of the ice-pressure
ridges of the combined Drygalski and Larsen Glaciers on to the
smoother sea ice, and eventually on to the Drygalski Ice Barrier.
While Mawson and Mackay pulled, I steadied the sledge on the
lower side in rounding the steep sidelings. We were still
sledging over the leafy or tile ice, which mostly crunched
underfoot with a sharp tinkling sound. We skirted the lateral
moraine for a distance of over half a mile, following a
depression in the ice-surface apparently produced by a stream,
the outlet of the waters of the small lakes. At one spot Mawson
crashed right through into the water beneath, and got wet up to
his thighs. In spite of my efforts to keep it on even keel, the
sledge frequently capsized on these steep sidelings. At last,
after struggling up and down heavy slopes, and over low-lying
areas of rotten ice, which every here and there let us through
into the water beneath, we arrived at the foot of an immense
ice-pressure ridge. It was a romantic-looking spot, though at the
time we did not exactly appreciate its beauties. To our left was
a huge cliff of massive granite rising up steeply to heights of
about 2000 ft. The combined pressure of the Drygalski and Mount
Larsen Glaciers had forced the glacier ice up into great ridges,
trending somewhat obliquely to the coast cliff.</p>
<p>We went back to the tent where we got some hot tea, of which
Mawson, particularly, was very glad, as he was somewhat cooled
down as the result of his wetting. Then we packed up the
remainder of our belongings on the sledge and dragged it down to
where we had dumped the half load on the near side of the
pressure ridge. Mackay reconnoitred ahead, and found that the
large-pressure ridge, which appeared to bar our progress towards
our depôt, gradually came nearer and nearer in to the granite
cliff, until it pressed hard against the cliff face. Obviously,
then, we were impounded by this huge pressure ridge, and would
have to devise some mean of getting over it. Taking our ice-axes
we smoothed a passage across part of the ridge. This proved a
very tough piece of work. We then unloaded the sledge and passed
each one of our packages over by hand. Finally we dragged the
sledge up and hoisted it over and lowered it down safely on the
other side. After this we reloaded the sledge and dragged it for
some considerable distance over more of the leafy ice-surface
alternating with flattish depressions of rotten ice and snow,
with water just beneath. We were now troubled, not only by the
tile-ice surface, but also by small channels with steep banks,
apparently eroded by glacial streams which had been flowing as
the result of the thaw while we were on the Magnetic Pole
plateau. We were also worried from time to time as to how to get
over the vast number of intersecting crevasses which lay in our
path.</p>
<p>Little by little the surface improved as we sledged towards
our depôt. The platy structure on the ice became less and less
pronounced, giving place to a surface like that of innumerable
frozen wavelets with sharp crests. By lunch-time we arrived at a
grand old glacial moraine. Amongst its boulders was a handsome
coarsely crystalline red granite of which Mackay secured a good
specimen. Numbers of boulders projected a few feet above the
surface of the ice, but most of them were wholly encased in ice.
After lunch, the sledging surface, though still heavy, owing to
the newly fallen snow, improved a little, but we soon found our
progress barred by what may be termed an ice donga, apparently an
old channel formed by a river of thaw water. We encountered three
such dongas that afternoon. They were from a few feet up to fifty
or a hundred feet or more in width, and from ten to twenty feet
deep, and bounded by precipitous or overhanging sides.</p>
<p>After a considerable amount of reconnoitring by Mackay and
Mawson, and often making considerable <i>détours</i> with our
sledge, we managed to cross them. Our difficulties were increased
by the innumerable crevasses and steep ice ridges. Some of these
crevasses were open, while others were roofed over with tough
snow. We fell into these crevasses from time to time, and on one
occasion, Mackay and I fell into the same crevasse
simultaneously, he up to his shoulders and I up to my waist.
Fortunately we were able, by throwing out our arms, to prevent
ourselves from falling right through the snow lid. While we were
sledging on through the night amongst this network of crevasses,
the sky became heavily overcast, and it commenced to snow. At
last we succeeded in getting within less than a mile of the
moraine containing the boulders of remarkable sphene-diorite,
specimens of which we had collected at that spot on our outward
journey. Here we camped and turned into our sleeping-bag at 7
a.m. on February 1.</p>
<p>It continued snowing heavily during the day, the fall being
about six inches in depth. The snow on the side of the tent
facing the sun thawed rapidly, and the thaw water dripped through
and formed pools on top of our sleeping-bag. Mawson's sprained
leg pained him a great deal. We estimated that we were now only
about sixteen miles, as the skua flies, from our depôt on the
Drygalski Glacier, but as we had only two days' food left, it
became imperative to push on without delay. We started sledging
in the thick driving snow on the evening of February 1. The
surface was covered with a layer of soft snow, nine inches in
thickness, but in the drifts it was, of course, deeper. The work
of sledging under these circumstances was excessively laborious
and exhausting, and besides it was impossible to keep our proper
course while the blizzard lasted. Accordingly, we camped at 8
p.m., and after our evening meal we rolled into our sleeping-bag
and slid into the dreamless sleep that comes to the worn and
weary wanderer.</p>
<p>At 8 a.m. on February 2 we were rejoiced to find the sun
shining in a clear sky. We intended making a desperate attempt
this day to reach our depôt, as we knew that the <i>Nimrod</i>
would be due&mdash;perhaps overdue&mdash;by the night. We saw as
we looked back that our track of yesterday was about as straight
as a corkscrew. Once more we pulled out over the soft snow, and
although refreshed somewhat by our good sleep we found the work
extremely trying and toilsome. We crossed an ice donga, and about
four miles out reached the edge of a second donga. Here we
decided to leave everything but our sledge, tent, sleeping-bag,
cooking-apparatus, oil and food, and make a forced march right on
to the Drygalski Depôt. Accordingly we camped, had tea and two
biscuits each, and fixed up our depôt, including the Lloyd-Creak
dip circle, theodolite and legs, geological collections, &amp;c.,
and marked the spot with a little blue flag tied on to an
ice-axe.</p>

src="1202761h-images/pic052.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>52. WATCHING FOR SEALS AT THE
ICE-EDGE</small></p>
<p>We now found the sledge, thus lightened, distinctly easier to
pull, and after making a slight <i>détour</i>, crossed the donga
by a snow bridge. Soon we reached another donga, and successfully
crossed it. At three and a half miles further at 8 p.m. we camped
again and had a little cheese and biscuit. After this short halt
we pulled on again, steering north-8°-east magnetic. Mawson
occasionally swept the horizon with our excellent field-glasses
in hopes of sighting our depôt. Suddenly he exclaimed that he saw
the depôt flag distinctly on its ice mound, apparently about
seven miles distant, but it was well round on the starboard bow
of our sledge on a bearing of south-38°-west magnetic. Mackay and
I were much excited at Mawson's discovery. Mackay seized the
field-glasses as soon as Mawson put them down and directed them
to the spot indicated, but could see no trace of the flag; then I
looked through the glasses with equally negative results. Mawson
opined that we must both be snow-blind. Then he looked through
them again, and at once exclaimed that he could see no trace of
the flag now. The horizon seemed to be walloping up and down,
just as though it was boiling, evidently the result of a mirage.
Mawson, however, was so confident that he had seen the flag when
he first looked, that we altered course to south-38°-west
magnetic, and after we had gone a little over a mile, and reached
the top of a slight eminence in the ice-surface, we were rejoiced
to hear the announcement that he could now see the depôt flag
distinctly'. We kept on sledging for several miles further. At
midnight, when the temperature had fallen to zero, I felt that
the big toe of my right foot was getting frost-bitten. My
ski-boots had all day been filled with the soft snow and the
warmth of my foot had thawed the snow, so that my socks were wet
through; and now, since the springing up of the wind and the
sudden fall in temperature, the water in the socks had turned to
ice. So we halted, got up the tent, started the Primus and
prepared for a midnight meal, while, with Mawson's assistance, I
got off my frozen ski-boots and socks and restored the
circulation in my toe, and put on some socks less icy than those
I had just taken off.</p>
<p>We were much refreshed by our supper, and then started off
again, thinking that at last we should reach our depôt, or at all
events, the small inlet a little over a mile distant from it, but
"the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft agley". There was
an ominous white streak ahead of us with a dark streak just
behind it, and we soon saw that this was due to a ravine or
barranca in the snow-and ice-surface interposing itself between
ourselves and our depôt. We soon reached the near cliff of the
barranca.</p>
<p>The barranca was about two hundred yards in width, and from
thirty to forty feet deep. It was bounded by a vertical cliff or
very steeply inclined slope on the near side, the north-west
side, and by an overhanging cliff festooned with stalactites on
the south-east side. To the north-east a strip of dark sea-water
was visible between the walls of the barranca, which evidently
communicated by a long narrow channel with the ocean outside,
some three miles distant. Inland, the barranca extended for many
miles as far as the eye could reach. The bottom of the barranca
immediately beneath us was floored with sea ice covered with a
few inches of snow. This ice was traversed by large tide-cracks,
and we were much excited to see that there were a number of seals
and Emperor penguins dotted over the ice floor. We determined to
try and cross the barranca. We looked up and down the near cliff
for a practicable spot where we could let down our sledge, and
soon found a suitable slope, a little to the north-east of us,
formed by a steep snow drift. We sledged on to this spot, and
making fast the Alpine rope to the bow of the sledge, lowered it
cautiously, stern first, to the bottom. The oil-cans in the rear
of the sledge were rattled up somewhat when it struck bottom, but
no harm was done. At the bottom we had some trouble in getting
the sledge over the gaping tide-cracks, some ten to fifteen feet
deep and three to five feet wide.</p>
<p>Arrived at the middle of the floor of the barranca, Mackay
killed two Emperor penguins, and took their breasts and livers to
replenish our exhausted larder. Meanwhile, Mawson crossed to the
far side of the floor of the barranca on the look-out for a
possible spot where we might swarm up. I joined him a few minutes
later, and as I was feeling much exhausted after the continuous
forced marches back from the Magnetic Pole, asked him to take
over the leadership of the expedition. I considered that under
the circumstances I was justified in taking this step. We had
accomplished the work assigned to us by our leader, having
reached the Magnetic Pole. We were within two or three miles of
our Drygalski Depôt, and although the only food left there was
two days' supply of broken biscuits with a little cheese, we had
a good prospect of meat-supply, as the barranca abounded in seals
and penguins, so that for the present we had no reason to
apprehend the danger of starvation. On the other hand, as regards
our ultimate personal safety, our position was somewhat critical.
We were not even certain that the <i>Nimrod</i> had arrived at
all in Ross Sea that season, though we thought it, of course,
very probable that she had. In the next case, on the assumption
that she had arrived, it was very possible that in view of the
great difficulties of making a thorough search along the two
hundred miles of coast, at any part of which we might have been
camped&mdash;difficulties arising from heavy belts of pack-ice
and icebergs, as well as from the deeply indented character of
that bold and rugged coast&mdash;it was quite possible that the
<i>Nimrod</i> would miss sighting our depôt flags altogether. In
the event of the <i>Nimrod</i> not appearing within a few days,
it would be necessary to take immediate and strenuous action with
a view either to wintering at the spot, or with a view to an
attempt to sledge back around the great mountain massifs and over
the many steeply crevassed glaciers for over two hundred miles to
our winter quarters at Cape Royds. Even now, in the event of some
immediate strenuous action being necessary, if the <i>Nimrod</i>
were to suddenly appear at some point along the coast, I thought
it would be best for Mawson, who was less physically exhausted
than myself, to be in charge. He had, throughout the whole
journey, shown excellent capacity for leadership, fully
justifying the opinion held of him by Lieutenant Shackleton when
providing in my instructions that in the event of anything
happening to myself Mawson was to assume the leadership. When I
spoke to him on the subject, he at first demurred, but finally
said that he would act for a time, and would think the matter
over at his leisure before definitely deciding to become
permanently the leader. I offered to give him authority in
writing as leader, but this he declined to receive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the examination of the cliff face on the south-east
side of the barranca showed that there was one very difficult but
apparently possible means of ascent. We returned to where we had
left Mackay, and then we three dragged the sledge around to the
edge of a rather formidable tide-crack, behind which lay the
mound of snow up which we hoped to climb; our idea being to
unpack our sledge, drag it to the top of this steep mound, and
rearing it on end at the top of the mound, use it as a ladder for
scaling the overhanging cliff above. Mackay managed to cross the
tide-crack, using the bamboo poles of our tent as a bridge, and
after some difficulty, reached the top of the snow mound under
the overhanging cliff. Much to our disappointment, however, he
discovered that the mound was formed of very soft snow, his
ice-axe sinking in to the whole depth of the handle directly he
placed it on top of the mound. It was obvious that as our sledge
would sink in to at least an equal depth, the top of it would
then be too short to enable any of us to scale the overhanging
cliff by its means. We were, therefore, reluctantly compelled to
drag our sledge back again over the tide-cracks to the north-west
side of the barranca down which we had previously lowered our
sledge. We then discovered that, as in classical times, while the
descent to Avernus was easy, it was difficult and toilsome to
retrace one's steps. With Mawson ahead with the ice-axe and
towing rope, and Mackay and I on either side of the sledge in the
rear, we managed by puffing and pushing together to force the
sledge up a few inches at a time. At each short halt, Mawson
would stick in the ice-axe, take a turn of the leading rope
around it, and support the sledge in this way for a brief
interval while we all got our breath. At last the forty feet of
steep slope was successfully negotiated, and we found ourselves
once more on the level plain at the top of the barranca, but of
course, on the wrong side in reference to our depôt. As we were
within three miles of the open sea we thought it would be safe to
camp here, as had the <i>Nimrod</i> sighted our depôt flag and
stood in to the coast, we could easily have hurried down to the
entrance of the inlet and made signals to her.</p>
<p>We had now been up since 8 a.m. on the previous day, and were
very thankful to be able to enter our tent, and have a meal off a
stew of minced penguin liver. We then turned into the
sleeping-bag at about 7 a.m. Just about a quarter of an hour
after we had turned in, as we learnt later, the <i>Nimrod</i>
must have passed, bound north towards Mount Melbourne, within
three miles of the ice cliff on which our tent was now situated.
Owing, however, to a light wind with snow drift she was unable to
sight either our depôt flag or tent.</p>

<h3>PROFESSOR DAVID'S NARRATIVE (<i>Concluded</i>)</h3>
<p><b>FEBRUARY 3</b>.&mdash;After sleeping in the bag from 7 a.m.
until 11 a.m. we got up and had breakfast, packed our sledge, and
started along the north bank of the snow cañon. The snow and ice
at the bottom were dotted with basking seals and moulting Emperor
penguins. Fully a hundred seals could be counted in places in a
distance of as many yards along the cañon. At about one mile from
the camp we reached a small branch cañon, which we had to head
off by turning to our right. We now proceeded about one and a
half miles further along the edge of the main cañon, and in our
then tired and weak state were much dispirited to find that it
still trended inland for a considerable distance. We now halted
by the sledge while Mackay went ahead to try and find a crossing,
and presently Mawson and I were rejoiced to hear him shout that
he had discovered a snow bridge across the cañon. Presently he
rejoined us, and together we pulled the sledge to the head of the
snow bridge. It was a romantic spot. A large slice of the snow or
névé cliff had fallen obliquely across the cañon, and its surface
had then been raised and partially levelled up with soft drift
snow. There was a crevasse at both the near and far ends of the
bridge, and the middle was sunk a good deal below the abutments.
Stepping over the crevasse at the near end we launched the sledge
with a run down to the centre of the bridge, then struggled up
the steep slope facing us, Mackay steadying the sledge from
falling off the narrow causeway, while we all three pulled for
all we were worth. In another minute or two we were safely across
with our sledge, thankful that we had now surmounted the last
obstacle that intervened between us and our depôt.</p>
<p>While heading for the depôt we sighted an Emperor penguin
close to our track. Mackay quickly slew him, and took his flesh
and liver for our cooking-pot. Two miles further on we camped.
Mawson minced the Emperor's flesh and liver, and after adding a
little snow, I boiled it over our Primus so as to make one and a
half pots of soupy mincemeat for each of us. This was the most
satisfying meal we had had for many a long day. After lunch we
sledged on for over one and a half miles further towards the
depôt, and at about 10.30 p.m. reached an ice mound on the south
side of the inlet in which the snow cañon terminated seawards.
This camping spot was a little over a mile distant from our
depôt. We were now all thoroughly exhausted and decided to camp.
The spot we had selected seemed specially suitable, as from the
adjacent ice mound we could get a good view of the ocean beyond
the Drygalski Barrier. While Mawson and I got up the tent, Mackay
went to kill a seal at the shore of the inlet. He soon returned
with plenty of seal meat and liver. He said that he had found two
young seals, and had killed one of them; that they had both
behaved in a most unusual manner, scuttling away quickly and
actively at his approach, instead of waiting without moving, as
did most of the Weddell seals of which we had hitherto had
experience. We discovered later that these two seals belonged to
the comparatively rare variety known as Ross seal. After a
delicious meal of seal blubber, blood and oil, with fried meat
and liver, cooked by Mawson. Mawson and I turned into the
sleeping-bag, leaving Mackay to take the first of our four hour
watches on the look-out for the <i>Nimrod</i>. During his watch
he walked up to our depôt and dug out our biscuit tin, which had
served us as a blubber lamp and cooker, together with the
cut-down paraffin tin which we had used as a frying-pan. Both
these he carried down to our tent. There he lit the blubber lamp
just outside the tent and cooked some penguin meat, regaling
himself at intervals during his four hour's watch with dainty
morsels from the savoury dish. When he called me up at 4 a.m. I
found that he had thoughtfully put into the frying-pan a junk of
Emperor's breast, weighing about two pounds, for me to toy with
during my watch. A chilly wind was blowing off the plateau, and I
was truly thankful for an occasional nibble at the hot penguin
meat. After cooking some more penguin meat I called up Mawson
soon after 8 a.m. on February 4, and immediately afterwards
turned into the bag, and at once dropped off sound asleep.</p>

<p align="center"><small>53. <i>NIMROD</i> PICKING UP THE
NORTHERN PARTY AT THE EDGE OF THE DRYGALSKI BARRIER</small></p>
<p>Mawson did not call Mackay and myself until after 2 p.m. We at
once rolled up the sleeping-bag, and Mawson cooked a generous
meal of seal and penguin meat and blubber, while Mackay made a
thin soupy broth on the Primus. Meanwhile, I went on to the ice
mound with the field-glasses, but could see nothing in the way of
a ship to seaward and returned to the tent. We all thoroughly
enjoyed our liberal repast, and particularly relished the seal's
blood, gravy and seal oil.</p>
<p>After the meal we discussed our future plans. We decided that
we had better move the tent that afternoon up to our old depôt,
where it would be a conspicuous object from the sea, and where,
too, we could command a more extensive view of the ocean. We also
talked over what we had best do in the event of the <i>Nimrod</i>
not turning up, and decided that we ought to attempt to sledge
overland to Hut Point, keeping ourselves alive on the way, as
best we might, with seal meat. It must be admitted that the
prospect of tackling two hundr-ed miles of coast, formed largely
of steep rocky foreshores, alternating with heavily crevassed
glacier ice, was not a very bright one. We also discussed the
date at which we ought to start trekking southwards. Mackay
thought we ought to commence making our preparations at once, and
that unless the <i>Nimrod</i> arrived within a few days we ought
to start down the coast with our sledge, tent, sleeping-bag,
cooker and seal meat, leaving a note at the depôt for the
<i>Nimrod</i> in case she should arrive later asking her to look
out for us along the coast, and if she couldn't sight us, to lay
depôts of food and oil for us at certain specified spots. He
considered that by this method we could make sure of beginning
the long journey in a sound state of health, and, if fortunate,
might reach Hut Point before the beginning of the equinoctial
gales in March. Mawson and I, on the other hand, thought that we
ought to wait on at our present camp until late in February.</p>
<p>From whatever point of view we looked at it, our present lot
was not a happy one. The possibility of a long wait in the gloomy
region of the Drygalski Glacier, with its frequent heavy snows at
this season of the year, and leaden sky vaulted over the dark
sea, was not pleasing to contemplate. Still less cheerful was the
prospect of a long, tedious and dangerous sledge journey towards
Hut Point. Even the diet of seal and penguin, just for the moment
so nice, largely because novel, would soon savour of <i>toujours
perdrix</i>.</p>
<p>Dispirited by forebodings of much toil and trouble, we were
just preparing to set our weary limbs in motion to pack up our
belongings for the short trek up to the depôt, when Bang! went
something, seemingly close to the door of our tent; the sound
thrilled us; in another instant the air reverberated with a big
boom! much louder than the first sound. Mawson gave tongue first,
roaring out, "A gun from the ship!" and dived for the tent door.
As the latter was narrow and funnel-shaped there was for the
moment some congestion of traffic. I dashed my head forwards to
where I saw a small opening, only in time to receive a few kicks
from the departing Mawson. Just as I was recovering my
equilibrium, Mackay made a wild charge, rode me down and trampled
over my prostrate body. When at length I struggled to my feet,
Mawson had got a lead of a hundred yards, and Mackay of about
fifty. "Bring something to wave", shouted Mawson, and I rushed
back to the tent and seized Mackay's rucksack. As I ran forward
this time, what a sight met my gaze. There was the dear old
<i>Nimrod</i>, not a quarter of a mile away, steaming straight
towards us up the inlet, her bows just rounding the entrance. At
the sight of the three of us running frantically to meet the
ship, hearty ringing cheers burst forth from all on board. How
those cheers stirred every fibre of one's being! It would be
hard, indeed, for any one, not situated as we had been, to
realise the sudden revulsion of our feelings. In a moment, as
dramatic as it was heavenly, we seemed to have passed from death
into life. My first feelings were of intense relief and joy; then
of fervent gratitude to the kind Providence which had so
mercifully led our friends to our deliverance.</p>
<p>A sudden shout from Mackay called me back to earth, "Mawson's
fallen into a deep crevasse. Look out, it's just in front of
you!" I then saw that Mackay was kneeling on the snow near the
edge of a small oblong sapphire-blue hole in the névé. "Are you
all right, Mawson?" he sang out, and from the depth, came up the
welcome word, "Yes". Mackay then told me that Mawson was about
twenty feet down the crevasse. We decided to try and pull him up
with the sledge harness, and hurried back to the sledge,
untoggled the harness, ran back with it to the crevasse, and let
one end down to Mawson. We found, however, that our combined
strength was insufficient to pull him up, and that there was a
risk, too, of the snow lid at the surface falling in on Mawson,
if weight was put upon it, unless it was strengthened with some
planking. Accordingly, we gave up the attempt to haul Mawson up,
and while I remained at the crevasse holding one end of the
sledge harness Mackay hurried off for help to the <i>Nimrod</i>,
which was now berthing alongside of the south wall of the inlet,
about two hundred yards distant. Mackay shouted to those on
board, "Mawson has fallen down a crevasse, and we got to the
Magnetic Pole." The accident had taken place so suddenly that
those on board had not realised in the least what had happened. A
clear, firm, cheery voice, that was strange to me, was now heard
issuing prompt orders for a rescue party. Almost in less time
than it takes to write it, officers and sailors were swarming
over the bows of the <i>Nimrod</i>, and dropping on to the ice
barrier beneath. I called down to Mawson that help was at hand.
He said that he was quite comfortable at present; that there was
sea water at the bottom of the crevasse, but that he had been
able to sustain himself a couple of feet above it on the small
ledge that had arrested his fall. Meanwhile, the rescue party,
headed by the first officer of the <i>Nimrod</i> J. K. Davis, had
arrived on the scene. The crevasse was bridged with a suitable
piece of sawn timber, and Davis, with that spirit of thoroughness
which characterises all his work, promptly had himself lowered
down the crevasse. On reaching the bottom he transferred the rope
by which he had been lowered to Mawson, and with a long pull and
a strong pull and a pull altogether, the company of the
<i>Nimrod</i> soon had Mawson safe on top, none the worse for the
accident with the exception that his back was slightly bruised.
As soon as the rope was cast free from Mawson, it was let down
again for Davis, and presently he, too, was safely on top.</p>
<p>And now we had a moment of leisure to see who constituted the
rescue party. There were the dear old faces so well known on our
voyage together the previous year, and interspersed with them
were a few new faces. Here were our old comrades Armytage and
Brocklehurst, Dr. Michell, Harbord (the officer who&mdash;as we
learned later&mdash;had sighted our depôt flag), our good
stewards Ansell and Ellis, the genial boatswain Cheetham, Paton,
and a number of others. What a joyous grasping of hands and
hearty all-round welcoming followed. Foremost among them all to
welcome us was Captain Evans, who had commanded the S.S.
<i>Koonya</i>, which towed the <i>Nimrod</i> from Lyttelton to
beyond the Antarctic Circle, and it goes without saying that the
fact that the <i>Nimrod</i> was now in command of a master of
such experience, so well and favourably known in the shipping
world of New Zealand and Australia, gave us the greatest
satisfaction. He hastened to assure me of the safety and good
health of my wife and family. While willing hands packed up our
sledge, tent and other belongings, Captain Evans walked with us
to the rope ladder hanging over the bows of the
<i>Nimrod</i>.</p>
<p>Quickly as all this had taken place, Mackay had already found
time to secure a pipe and some tobacco from one of our crew, and
was now puffing away to his heart's content. We were soon all on
the deck of the <i>Nimrod</i> once more, and were immediately
stood up in a row to be photographed. As soon as the cameras had
worked their wicked will upon us, for we were a sorry sight, our
friends hurried us off for afternoon tea. After our one hundred
and twenty-two days of hard toil over the sea ice of the coast
and the great snow desert of the hinterland, the little ship
seemed to us as luxurious as an ocean liner. To find oneself
seated once more in a comfortable chair, and to be served with
new-made bread, fresh butter, cake and tea, was Elysium.</p>
<p>We heard of the narrow escape of Armytage, Priestley and
Brocklehurst, when they were being carried out to sea, with only
two days' provisions, on a small ice-floe surrounded by Killer
whales; and how, just after the momentary grounding of the floe,
they were all just able to leap ashore at a spot where they were
picked up later by the <i>Nimrod</i>. We also heard of the
extraordinary adventures and escapes of Mackintosh and McGillan
in their forced march overland, without tent or sleeping-bag,
from Mount Bird to Cape Royds; of the departure of the
supporting-party to meet the Southern Party; and, in short, of
all the doings at Cape Royds and on the <i>Nimrod</i> since we
had last heard any news. Pleasantly the buzz of our friends'
voices blended itself with the gentle fizzing of steam from the
<i>Nimrod</i>'s boiler, and surely since the days of John Gilpin
"were never folk so glad" as were we three.</p>

<p align="center"><small>56. THE DECK OF THE <i>NIMROD</i> AFTER
A BLIZZARD</small></p>
<p>Here it may not perhaps be out of place to quote from Captain
Evans' private log in reference to the relief of our Northern
Party by the <i>Nimrod</i>. After hearing from the Western Party
under Armitage that we were long overdue at Butter Point, and
after consulting with Murray at Cape Royds, he decided to
commence to search for us, as suggested in Lieutenant
Shackleton's instructions on February 1. He left accordingly at
that date, and after looking for us in vain at the Butter Point
depôt, and at Granite Harbour he sailed northwards for the
Drygalski Ice Barrier Tongue, and when about three miles off our
depôt island had sighted our little flag and cairn, but was not
certain that it was a depôt. Nearer approach was precluded at the
time by the pack-ice.</p>
<p>Captain Evans' private log reads as follows:</p>
<p>"<i>February</i> 3, 1.30 a.m.&mdash;Cleared belt of
pack&mdash;proceeded westward along Drygalski Barrier edge.
Moderate to strong south-west wind, force four to eight with snow
drift; 7.30 a.m. to 9.30 a.m. off Barrier. (At this time the
<i>Nimrod</i> must have passed within about three miles of the
spot where we were at our last camp before reaching the inlet,
and had it not been for a little falling snow our flag and tent
would probably have been sighted on this occasion); 10 a.m. to
2.15 p.m.: coasted along the beach at distances of from one-fifth
of a mile to three-quarters of a mile in water from ten to fifty
fathoms; 1 p.m. wind dropped to calm; 2.15 p.m. bearing true
north-20°-east, distant twenty-four miles Mount Melbourne. Came
to top of bight (Gerlache Inlet) full of pack; sounded in
sixty-four fathoms; took bearings and stood eastward to search
Cape Washington; 3.30 p.m. entered the pack-ice.</p>
<p>Midnight: rounded Cape Washington at a distance of one and a
half cables in eleven to twenty fathoms, both sides of the cape
quite inaccessible&mdash;awful-looking ice cliffs northern
side&mdash;crevassed ice slopes south side. Fresh
south-south-west wind, force 5-5. . . . No sign of party or
record anywhere.</p>
<p>February 4, 1909, 10 a.m.&mdash;Pack-ice stretching east and
west to northward&mdash;turned back to try coast again to the
southward. Fresh southerly wind, force 6&mdash;clear and fine,
barometer 28.86, thermometer 17°. . . . Proceeding again along
Drygalski Barrier; 3 p.m. sighted two flags on Barrier edge and a
little back of it&mdash;small inlet developing. (The third
officer, Mr. A. Harbord, first sighted these flags, and came to
the captain and said, 'I think, sir, I see a flag', and then
Armytage, bringing his powerful deer-stalking telescope to bear
on the object, said to the captain, 'It's a dead sitter, sir.'
T.W.E.D.) 3.40 p.m. arrived at upper end of inlet&mdash;picked up
Professor David, Mawson and Mackay, just arrived back from
Magnetic Pole; 5 p.m. killed first Ross seal; 2 p.m. great
depression, 4 p.m. great elation. . . . At 3.30 p.m., upon
sighting the top of the Northern Party's tent, we fire a distress
double detonator. Upon hearing this in the tent we learn that
they all jumped up, and upset each other, and everything,
including the tin of seal blubber and blood which they were
drinking, and which Professor David pronounces good when you get
used to it, and rushed out, Mawson first, who almost immediately
went down a crevasse, from which Mr. Davis and a party from the
ship soon pulled him up. A great meeting&mdash;a tremendous
relief."</p>
<p>After afternoon tea came the joy of reading the home letters,
and finding that the news was good. Later we all three had a
novel experience, the first real wash for over four months. After
much diligent work with hot water, soap and towel some of the
outer casing of dirt was removed, and bits of our real selves
began to show through the covering of seal oil and soot. Dinner
followed at 6 p.m. and it is scarcely necessary to add that with
our raging appetites, and all the new types of dainty food around
us we over-ate ourselves. This did not prevent us from partaking
liberally of hot cocoa and gingerbread biscuits before turning in
at 10 p.m. None but those whose bed for months has been on snow
and ice can realise the luxury of a real bunk, blankets and
pillow in a snug little cabin. A few minutes' happy reverie
preceded sound sleep. At last our toilsome march was over, the
work that had been given us to do was done, and done just in the
nick of time; the safety of those nearest and dearest to us was
assured, and we could now lay down our weary limbs to rest.</p>
<p>Under Providence one felt one owed one's life to the patient
and thorough search, sound judgment and fine seamanship of
Captain Evans, and the devotion to duty of his officers and crew
and no pen can describe how that night one's heart overflowed
with thankfulness for all the blessings of that day. One's last
thought in the twilight that comes between wakefulness and sleep
is expressed in the words of our favourite record on the
gramophone, the hymn so grandly sung by Evan Williams:</p>
<p style="font-size:90%; margin-left:20%; text-indent:-15%;">"So
long Thy power hath blest me, sure it still will lead me on."</p>
<p>If one may be permitted to take a brief retrospect of our
journey the following considerations present themselves: The
total distance travelled from Cape Royds to the Magnetic Pole and
back to our depôt on the Drygalski Glacier was about 1260 miles.
Of this, 740 miles was relay work, and we dragged a weight of, at
first, a little over half a ton, and finally somewhat under half
a ton for the whole of this distance. For the remaining 520 miles
from the Drygalski Depôt to the Magnetic Pole and back we dragged
a weight at first, of 670 lb., but this finally became reduced to
about 450 lb., owing to consumption of food and oil, by the time
that we returned to our depôt.</p>
<p>We were absent on our sledge journey for one hundred and
twenty-two days, of which five days were spent in our tent during
heavy blizzards, and five days partly in experimenting in cooking
with blubber and partly in preparing supplies of seal meat for
the journey from the sea ice over the high plateau, and three
days in addition were taken up in reconnoitring, taking magnetic
observations, &amp;c. We therefore covered this distance of 1260
miles in 109 travelling days, an average of about eleven and a
half miles a day.</p>
<p>We had laid two depôts before our final start, but as these
were distant only ten miles and fifteen miles respectively, from
our winter quarters they did not materially help us. We had no
supporting-party, and with the exception of help from the
motor-car in laying out these short depôts we pulled the sledges
for the whole distance without assistance except, on rare
occasions, from the wind.</p>
<p>The travelling over the sea ice was at first pretty good, but
from Cape Bernacchi to the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier we were much
hampered by screwed pack-ice with accompanying high and hard snow
ridges. Towards the latter part of October and during November
and part of December the thawing surface of saline snow, clogging
and otherwise impeding our runners, made the work of sledging
extremely laborious. Moreover, on the sea ice&mdash;especially
towards the last part of our journey over it&mdash;we had ever
present the risk of a blizzard breaking the ice up suddenly all
around us, and drifting us out to sea. There can be no doubt, in
view of the wide lanes of open water in the sea ice on the south
side of the Drygalski Glacier, when we reached it on November 30,
that we got to glades fir ma only in the nick of time.</p>
<p>Then there was the formidable obstacle of the Drygalski
Glacier, with its wide and deep chasms, its steep ridges and
crevasses, the passage of this glacier proving so difficult that
although only a little over twenty miles in width it took us a
fortnight to get across. On the far side of the Drygalski was the
open sea forcing us to travel shorewards over the glacier
surface. Then had come the difficult task of pioneering a way up
to the high plateau&mdash;the attempt to force a passage up the
Mount Nansen Glacier&mdash;our narrow escapes from having our
sledge engulfed in crevasses&mdash;the heavy blizzard with deep
new fallen snow and then our retreat from that region of
high-pressure ridges and crevasse entanglements&mdash;our
abandonment of the proposed route up the snout of the
Bellingshausen Glacier, and finally our successful ascent up the
small tributary glacier, the "backstairs passage", to the south
of Mount Larsen.</p>
<p>On the high plateau was the difficulty of respiration, biting
winds with low temperatures, difficult sledging&mdash;sometimes
against blizzards&mdash;over broad undulations and high sastrugi,
the cracking of our lips, fingers and feet, exhaustion from
insufficient rations, disappointment at finding that the Magnetic
Pole had shifted further inland than the position previously
assigned to it. Then, after we had just succeeded by dint of
great efforts in reaching the Pole of verticity, came the
necessity for forced marches, with our sledge, of from sixteen to
twenty miles a day in order to reach the coast with any
reasonable prospect of our being picked up by the
<i>Nimrod</i>.</p>
<p>Then came our choice of the difficult route down the snout of
the Bellingshausen Glacier, and our consequent difficulties in
surmounting the ice-pressure ridges; then the difficulty of
sledging over the "tile-ice" surface, the opposing ice barrancas
formed by the thaw water while we were on the high plateau; the
final heavy snow blizzard; our loss of direction when sledging in
bad light and falling snow, and finally our arrest by the deep
barranca of what afterwards was known as Relief Inlet.</p>
<p>But ours were not the only, nor the greatest, difficulties
connected with our journey. There were many disappointments,
dangers and hardships for the captain, officers and crew of the
<i>Nimrod</i> in their search for us along that two hundred miles
of desolate and, for a great part, inaccessible coast-line. How
often black spots ashore, proving on nearer view to be seals or
penguins, had been mistaken for depôt flags; how often the glint
of sunlight off brightly reflecting facets of ice had been
thought to be "helios", only the disappointed ones can tell; how
often, too, the ship was all but aground, at other times all but
beset in the ice-pack in the efforts to get a clearer view of the
shore-line in order to discover our depôt! This is a tale that
the brave men who risked their lives to save ours will scorn to
tell, but is nevertheless true.</p>
<p>As the result of our journey to the Magnetic Pole and back,
Mawson was able to join up in his continuous triangulation
survey, Mount Erebus with Mount Melbourne, and to show with
approximate accuracy the outline of the coast-line, and the
position and height of several new mountains. He and I obtained
geological collections, sketches and notes&mdash;especially on
glacial geology&mdash;along the coast-line, and he also took a
series of photographs; while Mackay determined our altitudes on
the plateau by means of the hypsometer. Mawson also made magnetic
determinations, and I was able to gather some meteorological
information. A summary of this work is given in the Scientific
Appendix, and details will be supplied later in the Scientific
Memoirs of the expedition.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the time available during our journey was too
short for detailed magnetic, geological or meteorological
observations. Nevertheless, we trust that the information
obtained has justified the journey. At all events we have
pioneered a route to the Magnetic Pole, and we hope that the path
thus found will prove of use to future observers.</p>
<p>It is easy, of course, to be wise after the event, but there
is no doubt that had we known that there was going to be an
abundance of seals all along the coast, and had we had an
efficient team of dogs we could have accomplished our journey in
probably half the time that it actually occupied. Future
expeditions to the South Magnetic Pole would probably do well to
land a strong and well-equipped party, either at Relief Inlet, or
better, as near to "Backstairs Passage" as the ship can be taken,
and as early in December as the state of the sea ice makes
navigation possible. A party of three, with a supporting-party
also of three, with good dog teams and plenty of fresh seal meat,
could travel together for about seventy miles inland; then the
supporting-party might diverge and ascend Mount Nansen from its
inland extremity. The other party, meanwhile, might proceed to
the Magnetic Pole at not less than fifteen miles a day. This
should admit of their spending from a week to a fortnight at the
Pole, and they should then be able to return to the coast early
in February. Meanwhile, there would be plenty of scope for a
third party to explore the foothills of Mount Larsen and Mount
Nansen, search and map their wonderful moraines, and examine the
deeply indented rocky coastline from Nansen to the as yet untrod
volcano Mount Melbourne.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>ALL ABOARD: THE RETURN TO NEW ZEALAND</h3>
<p><b>THE</b> <i>Nimrod</i>, with the members of the Northern
Party aboard, got back to the winter quarters on February 11 and
landed Mawson. The hut party at this period consisted of Murray,
Priestley, Mawson, Day and Roberts. No news had been heard of the
Southern Party, and the Depôt Party, commanded by Joyce, was
still out. The ship lay under Glacier Tongue most of the time,
making occasional visits to Hut Point in case some of the men
should have returned. On February 20 it was found that the Depôt
Party had reached Hut Point, and had not seen the Southern Party.
The temperature was becoming lower, and the blizzards were more
frequent.</p>
<p>The instruction left by me had provided that if we had not
returned by February 25, a party was to be landed at Hut Point,
with a team of dogs, and on March 1 a search-party was to go
south. On February 21 Murray and Captain Evans began to make
preparations for the landing of the relief party. The ship
proceeded to Cape Royds where Mawson was picked up. In accordance
with my expressed wish he was offered the command of the relief
party, and accepted it. If it became necessary to go south in
search of the Southern Party the men landed at Hut Point would
have to spend another winter in the south, as the ship could not
wait until their return. It was therefore a serious matter for
those who stayed, but there was no lack of volunteers. These
arrangements being completed, most of the members of the
expedition then on board went ashore at Cape Royds to get the
last of their property packed ready for departure. The ship was
lying under Glacier Tongue when I arrived at Hut Point with Wild
on February 28, and after I had been landed with the relief party
in order to bring in Adams and Marshall, it proceeded to Cape
Royds in order to take on board the remaining members of the
shore-party and some specimens and stores.</p>
<p>The <i>Nimrod</i> anchored a short distance from the shore,
and two boats were launched. The only spot convenient for
embarkation near the ship's anchorage was at a low ice cliff in
Backdoor Bay. Everything had to be lowered by ropes over the
cliff into the boats. Some hours were spent in taking on board
the last of the collections, the private property, and various
stores.</p>
<p>A stiff breeze was blowing, making work with the boats
difficult, but by 6 a.m. on March 2 there remained to be taken on
board only the men and dogs. The operation of lowering the dogs
one by one into the boats was necessarily slow, and while it was
in progress the wind freshened to blizzard force, and the sea
began to run dangerously. The waves had deeply undercut the
ice-cliff, leaving a projecting shelf. One boat, in charge of
Davis, succeeded in reaching the ship, but a second boat,
commanded by Harbord, was less fortunate. It was heavily loaded
with twelve men and a number of dogs, and before it had proceeded
many yards from the shore an oar broke. The <i>Nimrod</i> was
forced to slip her moorings and steam out of the bay, as the
storm had become so severe that she was in danger of dragging her
anchors and going on the rocks. An attempt to float a buoy to the
boat was not successful, and for some time Harbord and the men
with him were in danger. They could not get out of the bay owing
to the force of the sea, and the projecting shelf of ice
threatened disaster if they approached the shore. The flying
spray had encased the men in ice, and their hands were numb and
half-frozen. At the end of an hour they managed to make fast to a
line stretched from an anchor a few yards from the cliff, the men
who had remained on shore pulling this line taut. The position
was still dangerous, but all the men and dogs were hauled up the
slippery ice-face into safety before the boat sank. Hot drinks
were soon ready in the hut, and the men dried their clothes as
best they could before the fire. Nearly all the bedding had been
sent on board, and the temperature was low, but they were
thankful to have escaped with their lives.</p>

<p align="center"><small>61. READY TO START HOME</small></p>
<p>The weather was bitter on the following morning (March 3), and
the <i>Nimrod</i>, which had been sheltering under Glacier
Tongue, came back to Cape Royds. A heavy sea was still running,
but a new landing-place was selected in the shelter of the cape,
and all the men and dogs were got aboard. The ship went back to
the Glacier Tongue anchorage to wait for the relief party.</p>
<p>About ten o'clock that night Mackintosh was walking the deck
engaged in conversation with some other members of the
expedition. Suddenly he became excited and said, "I feel that
Shackleton has arrived at Hut Point." He was very anxious that
the ship should go up to the Point, but nobody gave much
attention to him. Then Dunlop advised him to go up to the
crow's-nest if he was sure about it, and look for a signal.
Mackintosh went aloft, and immediately saw our flare at Hut
Point. The ship at once left for Hut Point, reaching it at
midnight, and by 2 a.m. on March 4 the entire expedition was safe
on board.</p>
<p>There was now no time to be lost if we were to attempt to
complete our work. The season was far advanced, and the condition
of the ice was a matter for anxiety, but I was most anxious to
undertake exploration with the ship to the eastward, towards
Adelie Land, with the idea of mapping the coast-line in that
direction. As soon as all the members of the expedition were on
board the <i>Nimrod</i>, therefore, I gave orders to steam north,
and in a very short time we were under way. It was evident that
the sea in our neighbourhood would be frozen over before many
hours had passed, and although I had foreseen the possibility of
having to spend a second winter in the Antarctic when making my
arrangements, we were all very much disinclined to face the long
wait if it could be avoided. I wished first to round Cape
Armitage and pick up the geological specimens and gear that had
been left at Pram Point, but there was heavy ice coming out from
the south, and this meant imminent risk of the ship being caught
and perhaps "nipped". I decided to go into shelter under Glacier
Tongue in the little inlet on the north side for a few hours, in
the hope that the southern wind, that was bringing out the ice,
would cease and that we would then be able to return and secure
the specimens and gear. This was about two o'clock on the morning
of March 4, and we members of the Southern Party turned in for a
much needed rest.</p>
<p>At eight o'clock on the morning of the 4th we again went down
the sound. Young ice was forming over the sea, which was now
calm, the wind having entirely dropped, and it was evident that
we must be very quick if we were to escape that year. We brought
the <i>Nimrod</i> right alongside the pressure ice at Pram Point,
and I pointed out the little depôt on the hillside. Mackintosh at
once went off with a party of men to bring the gear and specimens
down, while another party went out to the seal rookery to see if
they could find a peculiar seal that we had noticed on our way to
the hut on the previous night. The seal was either a new species
or the female of the Ross Seal. It was a small animal, about four
feet six inches long, with a broad white band from its throat
right down to its tail on the underside. If we had been equipped
with knives on the previous night we would have despatched it,
but we had no knives and were, moreover, very tired, and we
therefore left it. The search for the seal proved fruitless, and
as the sea was freezing over behind us I ordered all the men on
board directly the stuff from the depôt had been got on to the
deck, and the <i>Nimrod</i> once more steamed north. The breeze
soon began to freshen, and it was blowing hard from the south
when we passed the winter quarters at Cape Royds. We all turned
out to give three cheers and to take a last look at the place
where we had spent so many happy days. The hut was not exactly a
palatial residence and during our period of residence in it we
had suffered many discomforts, not to say hardships, but, on the
other hand, it had been our home for a year that would always
live in our memories. We had been a very happy little party
within its walls, and often when we were far away from even its
measure of civilisation, it had been the Mecca of all our hopes
and dreams. We watched the little hut fade away in the distance
with feelings almost of sadness, and there were few men aboard
who did not cherish a hope that some day they would once more
live strenuous days under the shadow of mighty Erebus.</p>
<p>I left at the winter quarters on Cape Royds a supply of stores
sufficient to last fifteen men for one year. The vicissitudes of
life in the Antarctic are such that such a supply might prove of
the greatest value to some future expedition. The hut was locked
up and the key hung up outside where it would be easily found,
and we readjusted the lashing of the hut so that it might be able
to withstand the attacks of the blizzards during the years to
come. Inside the hut I left a letter stating what had been
accomplished by the expedition, and giving some other information
that might be useful to a future party of explorers. The stores
left in the hut included oil, flour, jams, dried vegetables,
biscuits, pemmican, plasmon, matches and various tinned meats, as
well as tea, cocoa, and necessary articles of equipment. If any
party has to make use of our hut in the future, it will find
there everything that it requires.</p>
<p>The wind was still freshening as we went south under steam and
sail on March 4, and it was fortunate for us that this was so,
for the ice that had formed on the sea water in the sound was
thickening rapidly, assisted by the old pack, of which a large
amount lay across our course. I was anxious to pick up a depôt of
geological specimens on Depôt Island, left there by the Northern
Party, and with this end in view the <i>Nimrod</i> was taken on a
more westerly course than would otherwise have been the case. The
wind, however, was freshening to a gale, and we were passing
through streams of ice, which seemed to thicken as we neared the
shore. I decided that it would be too risky to send a party off
for the specimens, as there was no proper lee to this small
island, and the consequences of even a short delay might be
serious. I therefore gave instructions that the course should be
altered to due north. The following wind helped us, and on the
morning of March 6 we were off Cape Adare. I wanted to push
between the Balleny Islands and the mainland, and make an attempt
to follow the coastline from Cape North westward, so as to link
it up with Adelie Land. No ship had ever succeeded in penetrating
to the westward of Cape North, heavy pack having been encountered
on the occasion of each attempt. The <i>Discovery</i> had passed
through the Balleny Islands and sailed over part of the so-called
Wilkes Land of the maps, but the question of the existence of
this land in any other position had been left open.</p>

<p align="center"><small>62. NEW COASTLINE WEST OF CAPE NORTH
(Sketched by G. Marston)</small></p>
<p>We steamed along the pack-ice, which was beginning to thicken,
and although we did not manage to do all that I had hoped, we had
the satisfaction of pushing our little vessel along that coast to
longitude 166° 14' East, latitude 69° 47' South, a point further
west than had been reached by any previous expedition. On the
morning of March 8 we saw, beyond Cape North, a new coast-line
extending first to the southwards and then to the west for a
distance of over forty-five miles. We took angles and bearings,
and Marston sketched the main outlines. We were too far away to
take any photographs that would have been of value, but the
sketches show very clearly the type of the land. Professor David
was of opinion that it was the northern edge of the polar
plateau. The coast seemed to consist of cliffs, with a few bays
in the distance. We would all have been glad of an opportunity to
explore the coast thoroughly, but that was out of the question;
the ice was getting thicker all the time, and it was becoming
imperative that we should escape to clear water without further
delay. There was no chance of getting further west at that point,
and as the new ice was forming between the old pack of the
previous year and the land, we were in serious danger of being
frozen in for the winter at a place where we could not have done
any geological work of importance. We therefore moved north along
the edge of the pack, making as much westing as possible, in the
direction of the Balleny Islands. I still hoped that it might be
possible to skirt them and find Wilkes Land. It was awkward work,
and at times the ship could hardly move at all.</p>
<p>Finally, about midnight on March 9, I saw that we must go
north, and the course was set in that direction. We were almost
too late, for the ice was closing in and before long we were held
up, the ship being unable to move at all. The situation looked
black, but we discovered a lane through which progress could be
made, and in the afternoon of the 10th we were in fairly open
water, passing through occasional lines of pack. Our troubles
were over, for we had a good voyage up to New Zealand, and on
March 22 dropped anchor at the mouth of Lord's River, on the
south side of Stewart Island. I did not go to a port because I
wished to get the news of the expedition's work through to London
before we faced the energetic newspaper men.</p>
<p>That was a wonderful day to all of us. For over a year we had
seen nothing but rocks, ice, snow, and sea. There had been no
colour and no softness in the scenery of the Antarctic; no green
growth had gladdened our eyes, no musical notes of birds had come
to our ears. We had had our work, but we had been cut off from
most of the lesser things that go to make life worth while. No
person who has not spent a period of his life in those "stark and
sullen solitudes that sentinel the Pole" will understand fully
what trees and flowers, sun-flecked turf and running streams mean
to the soul of a man. We landed on the stretch of beach that
separated the sea from the luxuriant growth of the forest, and
scampered about like children in the sheer joy of being alive. I
did not wish to despatch my cablegrams from Half Moon Bay until
an hour previously arranged, and in the meantime we revelled in
the warm sand on the beach, bathed in the sea and climbed amongst
the trees. We lit a fire and made tea on the beach, and while we
were having our meal the wekas, the remarkable flightless birds
found only in New Zealand, came out from the bush for their share
of the good tidings. These quaint birds, with their long bills,
brown plumage and quick, inquisitive eyes have no fear of men,
and their friendliness seemed to us like a welcome from that
sunny land that had always treated us with such open-hearted
kindliness. The clear, musical notes of other birds came to us
from the trees, and we felt that we needed only good news from
home to make our happiness and contentment absolutely complete.
One of the scientific men found a cave showing signs of native
occupation in some period of the past, and was fortunate enough
to discover a stone adze made of the rare pounamu, or
greenstone.</p>

THE RETURN<br>
OF THE EXPEDITION. A BAY IN STEWART ISLAND</small></p>
<p>Early next morning we hove up the anchor, and at 10 a.m. we
entered Half Moon Bay. I went ashore to despatch my cablegram,
and it was strange to see new faces on the wharf after fifteen
months during which we had met no one outside the circle of our
own little party. There were girls on the wharf, too, and every
one was glad to see us in the hearty New Zealand way. I
despatched my cablegrams from the little office, and then went on
board again and ordered the course to be set for Lyttelton, the
port from which we had sailed on the first day of the previous
year. We arrived there on March 25 late in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The people of New Zealand would have welcomed us, I think,
whatever had been the result of our efforts, for their keen
interest in Antarctic exploration has never faltered since the
early days of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, and their attitude
towards us was always that of warm personal friendship, but the
news of the measure of success we had achieved had been published
in London, and flashed back to the southern countries, and we
were met out in the harbour and on the wharves by cheering
crowds. Enthusiastic friends boarded the <i>Nimrod</i> almost as
soon as she entered the heads, and when our little vessel came
alongside the quay the crowd on deck became so great that
movement was almost impossible. Then I was handed great bundles
of letters and cablegrams. The loved ones at home were well, the
world was pleased with our work, and it seemed as though nothing
but happiness could ever enter life again.</p>

<h3>BIOLOGY</h3>
<h4><small>NOTES BY</small> JAMES MURRAY, <small>BIOLOGIST OF THE
EXPEDITION</small></h4>
<p><b>ON</b> the calm evening of our departure for the south,
while the New Zealand coast was still in view, the <i>Nimrod</i>
was accompanied by a number of southern Blackback or Dominican
gulls, with their beautiful white-bordered black wings. An
occasional cormorant flew past. Next morning these shore birds
had left us, and their place had been taken by the albatrosses
and petrels which were to keep us company thenceforward till we
reached the Antarctic Circle.</p>
<p>The pretty little speckled cape pigeon just crossed the
Circle, and left us next day; the black-browed albatross was seen
for a day longer; the sooty albatross went furthest into the
Antarctic, and was last seen on January 18.</p>
<p>Just at the Antarctic Circle we were met by those peculiarly
Antarctic birds, the snowy and Antarctic petrels. The wide zone
of floating ice, a hundred miles or more across, would have been
gloomy indeed without those two birds, which frequented this zone
in large flocks. These beautiful petrels, the Antarctic, with
strongly contrasting brown and white, the Snowy, pure white
except for the black bill and feet, relieved by their bright
plumage and sprightly flight the loneliness of this region. A few
seals and penguins on the lower bergs were the only other living
things among the ice.</p>
<p>The giant petrel and the little Wilson's petrel were the only
birds that ranged right from the New Zealand coast to the shores
of Victoria Land.</p>
<p>In the open sea to the south of the belt of ice even the
Antarctic and Snowy petrels for the most part left us.</p>
<p>The desolation and lifelessness of the Antarctic were fully
realised as we approached the great Ice Barrier. There was no
living thing in sight as we steamed eastward, tracing the line of
this immense glacier. Towards midnight there opened suddenly to
our sight a scene of abounding life. The cliff of the Barrier
terminated, and a wide bay opened up, extending far to the south,
and partly filled by fast ice of one season's growth. Away to the
eastward the cliff recommenced. This bay, which we afterwards
referred to by the appropriate name of the Bay of Whales, was
teeming with all the familiar kinds of Antarctic life. Hundreds
of whales, killers, finners, and humpbacks, were rising and
blowing all around. On the ice groups of Weddell seals were
basking in the midnight sunshine. Emperor penguins were standing
about or tobogganing in unconcerned parties. Skua gulls were
flying heavily, or sitting drowsily on the ice. Only the Adelie
penguin (busy nesting elsewhere), and the rarer kinds of seal
were absent.</p>
<p>It could hardly be supposed that this was a chance gathering
of all these animals. Passing the same spot on the return journey
westward, there was still the same abundance of life. There was
probably land near by.</p>
<p><small>CAPE ROYDS.</small>&mdash;To the biologist, no more
uninviting desert is imaginable than Cape Royds seemed when we
made our first landing, and for long afterwards. Here is absolute
desolation, a black and white wilderness, rugged ridges of lava
alternating with snowdrifts for a few miles, ending to the north
and south in crevassed glaciers, and eastward in the snowfield
stretching up to the rocky crags of the cone of Mount Erebus.</p>
<p>On the very edge of the sea, the little colony of Adelie
penguins and the scattered skua gulls relieved the monotony.
Beyond was no living creature, no blade of grass, or tiniest
patch of welcome green.</p>
<p>Bleak and bare though it was, this stretch of two or three
miles of broken country, where rocky peaks and ridges, moraines
and snow drifts, diversified the surface, was the field of
operations for the biologist. The white waste of glacier and
snowfield was hopeless, the nearer country seemed little more
promising.</p>
<p>The sea was there, known to be teeming with varied life, but
it was inaccessible till the ice should bridge it over.</p>
<p>In the immediate vicinity of the camp were many little sharp
peaks of kenyte, and short valleys filled with a cindery gravel
derived from the decomposition of the same rock. Moraines covered
the rock in places, and many of the valleys contained frozen
ponds or lakes of various sizes up to half a mile in length.</p>
<p>The first walks over the hills did little to encourage the
biologist. The rugged kenyte, with its hard projecting felspar
crystals tearing the boots, supported no living thing. Little
could we suspect that far beneath the thick ice of the lakes was
plentiful life, dormant, it is true, but only waiting to be
thawed out to spring into activity.</p>
<p>Gradually, as we came to know it, it began to appear that the
barrenness was not so absolute as we at first supposed. On an
early walk, Mr. Shackleton brought home a scrap of moss and
lichen, but it was long afterwards that the melting of the snow
in the next summer revealed that fact that on some of the
moraines the growth of mosses and lichens was, comparatively
speaking, luxuriant. A little dried-up pool, some two yards
across, close by the penguin rookery, was quite covered by a film
formed of bright green filamentous algæ. Around the edges of some
of the smaller lakes, thick wrinkled sheets of a plant of a dingy
green or brown colour were seen, resembling some of the large
foliaceous lichens in form. Wild brought in some of the same
plant which he had found embedded in the transparent ice of a
lake afterwards known as Clear Lake. In this situation it was of
a beautiful orange red colour. Later on, this plant was found to
be abundant in all the lakes, and in many of them it formed
continuous sheets over the entire bed. Many of the gravelly
valleys showed a faint green tinge, showing where water had run
in the summer-time.</p>
<p align="center"><small>MICROSCOPIC LIFE</small><br></p>
<p>It was while examining a bit of the orange-coloured weed under
the microscope, that the first fresh-water animals were found.
Two or three little red worm-like creatures were seen, creeping
about like caterpillars, now and again coming to a stop and
putting out their heads to feed, when they showed themselves to
be rotifers, or wheel-bearing animalcules.</p>
<p>Having thus ascertained that there were microscopic animals on
this plant, a large quantity of it was gathered and washed in
water to remove the adhering organisms. The sediment obtained was
concentrated by straining, and a drop put under the microscope.
Myriads of living things appeared, animals and plants. The
plant-life consisted of various spheres and threads of green and
blue-green algæ, some of the latter resembling strings of
beads.</p>
<p>The animals were more abundant, and in greater variety. The
creeping rotifers were most plentiful, and there were several
kinds of them besides the blood-red one first noticed. Some were
of curious shapes.</p>
<p>Many were feeding, the two rotating wheels sweeping streams of
minute particles towards the mouth.</p>
<p>Small bear-like creatures were scratching among the
<i>débris</i> or fiercely "pawing the air" with great curved,
dangerous-looking claws. These were the water-bears.</p>
<p>Miniature snakes (thread-worms) were twisting in and out, and
lashing their tails. Some of the simplest of animals (protozoa),
each consisting of a single cell, were there, the active
infusoria swimming rapidly by means of their cilia, the
slower-moving rhizopods putting out their little soft fingers to
feed or creep about. Animals higher in the scale were not
wanting, though these were never seen alive. Skins of some mites
related to the cheese mite, and of some small shrimps (crustacea)
were occasionally found.</p>
<p>Among all these animals the rotifers and water-bears were most
important in point of numbers, and they lead such strange lives
that they will be more fully described in later paragraphs. At
any time during the winter an unlimited supply of these animals
could be got for study by simply melting a piece of ice
containing some weed. In summer, the ponds and smaller lakes were
completely melted for weeks, and then they were still more easily
got by washing some of the weed. A few animals not found in
winter then hatched out from eggs and swam about in the water. A
large and beautiful rotifer named <i>hydatina</i> appear in Coast
Lake only.</p>
<p>In Coast Lake also a curious thing happened in summer. The
stones at the margin became covered by bright red patches, as
though they had been sprinkled with blood. These patches were
found to be formed of rotifers, of the same kind which were
commonest among the weed in winter. The red stains appear to rise
owing to their rapid multiplication, and to their fixing
themselves side by side as close as they can pack. The photograph
shows a small part of one of these stains transferred by a brush
to the microscope slide.</p>
<p>In Coast Lake the largest of these patches of rotifers would
not be more than an inch in diameter, but Priestley tells us that
in a lake on the west side of the Sound they formed patches "as
large as a man's head" and of appreciable thickness. Though this
rotifer usually attaches itself by the foot when feeding, many of
them let go their hold and go swimming in the water, so that when
water from any of these lakes is taken for drinking it can be
seen that there is a fair sprinkling of red grains in it which
must be swallowed with the water.</p>
<p>In summer, too, in very shallow ponds and trickling streams an
alga of a brownish-green colour grows in large translucent
sheets.</p>
<p align="center"><small>LIFE IN THE ICE</small><br></p>
<p>As soon as animals were obtained from the weed enclosed in the
ice in the manner described above, it was obvious that mere
freezing did not kill them. They were first got in the shallow
lakes, where the weed could be seen through the transparent ice
at the margins. There were plenty in all the shallow lakes. A
shaft was sunk through fifteen feet of ice to the bottom of Blue
Lake. There was a film of yellow weed covering the gravel of
which the bottom was composed, and on this weed several kinds of
rotifers were found alive. This fact seemed more remarkable
later, when we found that Blue Lake did not melt during the two
summers that we spent at Cape Royds. This means that the animals
must be capable of remaining frozen for years, possibly for many
years, without being killed. Though enclosed in the ice, there
was no means of knowing how low temperatures they could endure,
for the ice in the lakes might never be so cold as the air.</p>

<p align="center"><small>73. THE COMMONEST WATER-BEAR<br>
IN THE CAPE ROYDS DISTRICT</small></p>
<p>A few simple experiments were carried out with the object of
finding what degree of cold they could survive. Afterwards the
experiments were extended in other directions; they were heated,
they were immersed in various saline mixtures; in short, they
were submitted to various tests such as they might be exposed to
in nature. It must be admitted that we did not ascertain what
limits of temperature they could endure. We only know that they
<i>live</i> at a certain low temperature; the Antarctic was not
cold enough to show us any temperature at which they
<i>die</i>.</p>
<p>From facts previously ascertained we may predicate
approximately what is the limit at the other end of the scale.
Animal protoplasm is known to coagulate at a point well below the
boiling-point of water. As the Antarctic was not cold enough, it
was intended to use the resources of civilisation in order to get
greater cold, by the use of liquid air. Unfortunately, the
animals had to be subjected for some weeks to an almost tropical
temperature, and were found to be all dead when they reached
Sydney.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Since this was written, examination of the
rotifers in London (in September 1909) has shown that they are
still living.]</p>
<p align="center"><small>TENACITY OF LIFE</small><br></p>
<p>To test the degree of cold which they could stand blocks of
ice were cut from the lakes and exposed to the air in the coldest
weather of the whole winter. By boring into the centre of the
blocks we found that they were as cold as the air. A temperature
of minus 40° Fahr. did not kill the animals.</p>
<p>Then they were alternately frozen and thawed weekly for a long
period, and took no harm. They were dried and frozen, and thawed
and moistened, and still they lived. At last they were dried, and
the bottle containing them was immersed in boiling water, which
was allowed to cool gradually and still a great many survived.
Again they were put into sea-water, and into the brine from the
bottom of Green Lake, which is so salt that it only freezes at
about zero (Fahr.). They were left in these salt waters for a
month, yet as soon as they were transferred to fresh water they
began to crawl about as though nothing had happened.</p>
<p>Such is the vitality of these little animals that they can
endure being taken from ice at a minus temperature, thawed, dried
and subjected to a temperature not very far short of
boiling-point, all within a few hours (a range of more than 200°
Fahr.). It is not the eggs merely that survive all these changes,
but the grown animals. These are animals comparatively high in
the scale. The rotifers are worms, and the water-bears (which
stood the same tests) are cousins to the insects and spiders.
Some very lowly plants are not killed by being put in boiling
water and doubtless many very simple animals can live through
cold greater than we found in the Antarctic. Men can endure
exposure for a time to very much lower temperatures, and to dry
heat far above the temperature of boiling water, but the case of
the rotifer is very different. Its little body actually takes
those different temperatures, man's body does not.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="colpicE" id="colpicE"></a><img alt=""
src="1202761h-images/colpicE.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>E. THE EMPERORS' CONCLAVE</small></p>
<p>It is a curious fact that these animals, which can endure such
extremes of heat and cold, and other unfavourable conditions,
readily die when left in cold water at a moderate temperature.
The water may get a few degrees warmer than they are accustomed
to, and may be insufficiently aerated, but there is nothing to
alarm them and induce them to make use of their remarkable means
of protection (whatever they may be). Exposed to low temperatures
or to salt water, they contract into little round balls, and in
this state they are (somehow) safe. In the cold water, which is
just slightly unfavourable, they see no cause for alarm, and so,
as Mr. Shackleton aptly expressed it when told about it, "they go
out without their Burberries", that being the great sin against
prudence on the part of a polar explorer.</p>
<p>The rotifer is not as a rule a long-lived animal. I have heard
of a patriarch of five months, which then came to an untimely
end. Generally their span is to be measured by days or weeks, or
at any rate, is limited by a single season. The majority of the
creeping rotifers can protect themselves against drying up, by
coating themselves with a kind of varnish, and so they prolong
what would be an ephemeral existence through a period of years.
As all activity is suspended it may be questioned whether the
animal gains anything by this marvellous protective capacity, but
at least the chances of the race surviving are greatly increased
by it. The Antarctic rotifers in like manner exist in a state of
suspended animation when frozen in ice for a long period. If the
lakes in which they live are only melted at long intervals and
for short periods, it may be that some very ancient rotifers are
alive beneath the ice, possibly scores of years old.</p>
<p align="center"><small>VIVIPAROUS ROTIFERS</small><br></p>
<p>Most rotifers lay eggs, but a good many kinds bring forth the
young alive and very completely developed. At Cape Royds, twelve
kinds of creeping rotifers were found. Eight of these were
well-known kinds which elsewhere lay eggs, and at Cape Royds they
are reproduced in the same way.</p>
<p>There were, however, two other kinds at Cape Royds, unknown
anywhere else, and these are greatly more abundant than any of
the others. It has been told how one of them forms blood-like
patches in the lakes. Now, these two species bring forth living
young, yet they belong to groups which usually lay eggs. One of
them belongs to a genius (<i>adineta</i>), no other known member
of which is viviparous; the other (<i>philodina gregaria</i>)
belongs to a section of the genus in which all the previously
known species are oviparous.</p>
<p>It is obvious that this mode of reproduction, being unusual in
the groups to which they belong, must have been developed as an
adaptation to the peculiar conditions, and their extraordinarily
abundance shows that it is perfectly successful. Yet this is
contrary to our preconception of what will be favourable under
severe conditions. It is usually supposed that eggs are better
protected against evil conditions than the adult animals, and
that production of winter eggs ensures the continuation of the
race when the animals perish, and it appears to be generally so
among the lower invertebrata. Yet here, in one of the severest
climates in the world, the process is reversed. Not only are the
animals viviparous, but parents and young are alike indifferent
to prolonged interruption of their activity by freezing, and when
thawing occurs, development proceeds from where it left off.
Since the viviparous rotifers are the most successful in the
struggle for existence at Cape Royds, it is rather curious to
note the total absence of animals of the genus <i>Rotifer</i>,
which are all normally viviparous.</p>

<br>
<p align="center"><small>LIFE IN SALT LAKES</small><br></p>
<p>Green Lake is very saline. We do not yet know how much saline
matter the water contains when the lake is entirely melted and
mixed up by wind. The fluid obtained from under the ice in winter
is a very dense and strong-smelling brine. There is abundance of
life in this lake, but the number of kinds is much less than in
the other lakes. Only two out of the twelve species of rotifers
known at Cape Royds live in it. One of these (<i>callidina
constricta</i>) is not very plentiful; the other (<i>adineta
grandis</i>) is extremely so. This animal, while developing the
power of enduring cold, has at the same time become accustomed to
living in salt water. Though they were not killed by the Green
Lake brine, which is so much salter than the sea-water, none of
these rotifers have been found in the sea.</p>
<p align="center"><small>WATER-BEARS IN ICE</small><br></p>
<p>Water-bears were found to live while frozen in ice just as
well as the rotifers did. It is an interesting fact that the only
abundant species at Cape Royds is an Arctic species
(<i>macrobiotus arcticus</i>) which was only previously known in
Spitzbergen and Franz Josef Land, and which has not yet been
detected in the various collections made on the other side of the
Antarctic by Bruce's and Nordenskjold's expeditions.</p>
<p align="center"><small>DISTRIBUTION OF ROTIFERS,
&amp;C.</small><br></p>
<p>Most of the rotifers and other animals were found generally
distributed in all the lakes visited. These covered a very
limited area, the most distant being no more than thirty miles
apart. The nature of the microscopic fauna of other parts of the
Antarctic is scarcely known. Some of the Cape Royds lakes are
richer than others, and the saline lakes are poorer, but the
general distribution of most of the animals suggests easy
dispersal from one to another. How are they conveyed? Only two
methods suggest themselves to one acquainted with the local
conditions. The skua gulls, which are so fond of bathing, may
transfer a few adhering to their feet when they go from one lake
to another. No other bird is at all likely to assist in this
process. The other method, which seems likely to be the general
one, is by wind. The weed at the margins of the lakes gets
exposed and dried by the evaporation of the water, or more
commonly by the ablation of the ice from the surface. It is then
very light and easily blown about by the Mind, carrying its
freight of dormant rotifers, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The experiments detailed above show that in course of this
dispersal they are scarcely exposed to danger at all. The hardest
frost or the hottest sun cannot harm them, and should they even
fall into the sea, they will not be killed if the plant which
forms a raft for them eventually reaches the shore, when they may
be again dried and driven by the wind till they find a suitable
place to resume living. A difficulty suggests itself in
considering this theory of dispersal by wind. The prevalent
wind-storms are all from the southward. Northerly winds of force
enough to move the dried plants are almost unknown. Though
northerly winds prevail for a somewhat greater number of hours
during the year than the southerlies, they are very light airs.
Dispersal would then be easy in one direction only, and might be
very slow, and dependent on the agency of the gulls in other
directions.</p>
<p align="center"><small>LIFE AMONG MOSS</small><br></p>
<p>The moss-dwellers are now well recognised among microscopic
animals. There are rotifers and water-bears among the mosses at
Cape Royds, but the mosses themselves are not very abundant, and
the creeping rotifers have found a better home among the weed in
the lakes.</p>
<p>Among the mosses the animals lead even a harder life than they
do in the lakes. In the lakes, when they do melt, the rotifers
enjoy a period of some weeks when they can move and feed and
multiply. Among mosses they feel at once the lowest temperatures
of the air. They are frozen during the greater part of the year.
They are frozen even in summer for the greater part of every day.
Only for a few hours daily for a short time in the height of
summer, the moss is thawed by the sun's rays. One wonders when
the beasts get any time to grow. Yet they are there in abundance.
They are all of different kinds from the lake dwellers. None of
the rotifers were recognised, but some of the water-bears
were.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BIOLOGICAL PROBLEMS</small><br></p>
<p>By what means do the rotifers survive freezing? It is not, as
with higher animals, that they can keep warm in spite of the
cold. They are too small for that. Their very blood, as the
watery fluid filling the body cavity may be called, freezes very
soon after the surrounding water.</p>
<p>Whence is the microscopic fauna derived? Are the rotifers and
water-bears survivors from the remote time when a milder climate
prevailed in Antarctica, when the country was covered with a
vegetation of the higher plants and the coal-beds were in course
of formation? Or are they colonists from the temperate regions,
which have migrated across the stormy Antarctic Ocean under
present-day conditions?</p>
<p>Some of the facts favour both theories. The small number of
species, and the fact that the majority of them are widely
distributed over the world, point to recent immigration.</p>
<p align="center"><small>PENGUINS</small><br></p>
<p>Though so much has been written about them, the penguins
always excite fresh interest in every one who sees them for the
first time. There is endless interest in watching them, the
dignified Emperor, dignified notwithstanding his clumsy waddle,
going along with his wife (or wives) by his side, the very
picture of a successful, self-satisfied, happy, unsuspicious
countryman, gravely bowing like a Chinaman before a yelping
dog&mdash;the little undignified matter-of-fact Adelie, minding
his own business in a way worthy of emulation. They are perfectly
adapted to a narrow round of life, and when compelled to face
matters outside of their experience they often behave with
apparent stupidity, but sometimes show a good deal of
intelligence.</p>
<p>Their resemblance to human beings is always noticed. This is
partly due to the habit of walking erect, but there are truly a
great many human traits about them. They are the civilised
nations of these regions, and their civilisation, if much simpler
than ours, is in some respects higher and more worthy of the
name. But there is a good deal of human nature in them, too. As
in the human race their gathering in colonies does not show any
true social instinct. They are merely gregarious; each penguin is
in the rookery for his own ends, there is no thought of the
general good. You might exterminate an Adelie rookery with the
exception of one bird, and he would be in no way concerned so
long as you left him alone.</p>
<p>Some little suggestion of altruism will appear in dealing with
the nesting habits of the Adelie. Thieving is known, among the
Adelies at least. One very pleasing trait is shown, which they
have in common with man. Eating is not with them the prime
business in life, as it is with the common fowl, and most
animals. Both Emperors and Adelies, when the serious business of
nesting is off their minds, show a legitimate curiosity. Having
fed and got into good condition they leave the sea and go off in
parties, apparently to see the country, and travel for days and
weeks.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE EMPEROR</small><br></p>
<p>We saw the Emperor only as a summer visitor. Having finished
nesting, fed up and become glossy and beautiful, they came up out
of the sea in large or small parties, apparently to have a good
time before moulting. While the Adelies were nesting they began
to come in numbers to inspect the camp. Passing among the
Adelies, the two kinds usually paid no attention to one another,
but sometimes an Adelie would think an Emperor came too close to
her nest, and a curious unequal quarrel would ensue, the little
impudence pecking and scolding, and the Emperor scolding back,
with some loss of dignity. Though more than able to hold her own
with the tongue, the Adelie knew the value of discretion whenever
the Emperor raised his flipper.</p>
<p>They were curious about any unusual object and would come a
long way to see a motor-car or a man. When out on these
excursions the leader of a party keeps them together by a long
shrill squawk. Distant parties salute in this way and continue
calling till they get pretty close. A party could be made to
approach by imitating this call. The first party to arrive
inspected the boat, then crossed the lake to the camp. Soon they
discovered the dogs, and thereafter all other interests were
swallowed up in the interest excited by them. After the first
discovery crowds came every day for a long time, and from the
manner in which they went straight to the kennels one was tempted
to believe that the fame of them had been noised abroad.</p>
<p align="center"><small>CEREMONIES OF MEETING</small><br></p>
<p>Emperors are very ceremonious in meeting other Emperors or men
or dogs. They come up to a party of strangers in a straggling
procession, some big important aldermanic fellow leading. At a
respectful distance from the man or dog they halt, the old male
waddles close up and bows gravely till his beak is almost
touching his breast. Keeping his head bowed he makes a long
speech, in a muttering manner, short sounds following in groups
of four or five. Having finished the speech the head is still
kept bowed a few seconds for politeness sake, then it is raised
and he describes with his bill as large a circle as the joints of
his neck will allow, looking in your face at last to see if you
have understood. If you have not comprehended, as is usually the
case, he tries again. He is very patient with your stupidity, and
feels sure that he will get it into your dull brain if he keeps
at it long enough. By this time his followers are getting
impatient. They are sure he is making a mess of it. Another male
will waddle forward with dignity, elbow the first aside as if to
say, "I'll show you how it ought to be done", and go through the
whole business again. Their most solemn ceremonies were used
towards the dogs, and three old fellows have been seen calmly
bowing and speaking simultaneously to a dog, which for its part
was yelping and straining at its chain in the effort to get at
them.</p>
<p>Left to themselves the Emperor penguins seem perfectly
peaceable, and no sign of quarrelling was ever noticed. When a
party of them was driven into a narrow space they resented the
jostling, and flippers were freely used, making resounding
whacks, which apparently are not felt through the dense feathery
fur. The flipper strikes with equal facility forward or
backward.</p>
<p>They seem to regard men as penguins like themselves. They are
quite unsuspicious and slow to take alarm, so long as you stay
still or move very slowly. If you walk too fast among them, or if
you touch them, they get frightened and run away, only fighting
when closely pressed. As one slowly retreats, fighting, he has a
ludicrous resemblance to a small boy being bullied by a big one,
his flipper towards the foe elevated in defence, and making quick
blows at the bully. It is well to keep clear of that flipper when
he strikes, for it is very powerful, and might break an arm.</p>
<p>Emperors were killed by the dogs, but it is likely that they
hunted in couples or in parties to do this. A long fight was
witnessed between an Emperor and the dog Ambrose, the largest of
our dogs native to the Antarctic. The penguin was quick enough in
movement to keep always facing the dog, and the flipper and long
sharp bill were efficient weapons, as Ambrose seemed to
appreciate. Only the bill was used, and it appeared to be due to
short sight that the blow always fell short. Many of the
apparently stupid acts of both kinds of penguins are doubtless to
be traced to their very defective sight in air.</p>
<p>The Emperor can hardly be said to migrate since he remains to
breed during the winter darkness, and spends the summer among the
ice or on shore in the same region. Yet he travels a good deal,
and the meaning of some of his journeyings remains a mystery. The
visits of touring-parties to the camp have been described. At the
same season (early summer), when the motor-car was making
frequent journeys southward to Glacier Tongue with stores for
depôt laying, we crossed on the way a great many penguin tracks.
Many of these were beaten roads, where large parties had passed,
some walking, some tobogganing. They all trended roughly to the
south-east, and the wing marks and foot marks showed that they
were all outward bound from the open sea towards the shores of
Ross Island. Some of the roads were twelve miles or more from the
open sea. There were no return tracks.</p>
<p>We expected to find that they had gone in to seek sheltered
moulting-places, but on a motor trip to the Turk's Head we
skirted a long stretch of the coast, and found no Emperors.</p>
<p>On journeys they often travel many miles walking erect, when
they get along at a very slow shuffle, making only a few inches
at each step. In walking thus they keep their balance by the
assistance of the tail, which forms a tripod with the legs. When
on a suitable snow surface they progress rapidly by tobogganing,
a very graceful motion, when they make sledges of their breasts
and propel themselves by the powerful legs, balancing and perhaps
improving their speed by means of the wings.</p>
<p>Eight of them visited the motor-car one day, near Tent Island,
sledging swiftly towards us. Two of them were very determined
fighters and refused to be driven away. One obstinate phlegmatic
old fellow, who wasn't going to be hurried by anybody, did learn
to hustle as the car bore down upon him.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE ADELIE</small><br></p>
<p>The Adelie is always comical. He pops out of the water with
startling suddenness, like a jack-in-the-box, alights on his
feet, gives his tail a shake, and toddles off about his business.
He always knows where he wants to go, and what he wants to do,
and isn't easily turned aside from his purpose.</p>

<p align="center"><small>85. AN ADELIE CALLING FOR A MATE AFTER
COMMENCING<br>
THE NEST</small></p>
<p>In the water the Adelie penguins move rapidly and circle in
the same way as a porpoise or dolphin, for which they are easily
mistaken at a little distance. On level ice or snow they can run
pretty fast, getting along about as fast as a man at a smart
walk. They find even a small crack a serious obstruction, and
pause and measure with the eye one of a few inches before very
cautiously hopping it. They flop down and toboggan over any
opening more than a few inches wide. They can climb hills of a
very steep angle, but on uneven ground they use their flippers as
balancers. They toboggan with great speed on snow or ice, or even
on the bare rocks when scared, but in that case their flippers
are soon bleeding. Very rarely they swim in the water like ducks.
They lie much lower in the water than the duck. The neck is below
the surface and the head is just showing.</p>
<p>The Adelie is very brave in the breeding-season. His is time
courage, not the courage of ignorance, for after he has learned
to know man, and fear him, he remains to defend the nest against
any odds. When walking among the nests one is assailed on all
sides by powerful bills. Most of the birds sit still on the
nests, but the more pugnacious ones run at you from a distance
and often take you unawares. We wore for protection long felt
boots reaching well above the knee. Some of the clever ones knew
that they were wasting their efforts on the felt boots, and would
come up behind, hop up and seize the skin above the boot, and
hang on tight, beating with their wings. One of these little
furies, hanging to your flesh and flapping his strong flippers so
fast that you can hardly see them move, is no joke. A man once
stumbled and fell into a colony of Adelies, and before he could
recover himself and scramble out, they were upon him, and he bore
the marks of their fury for some time.</p>
<p>Some birds became greatly interested in the camp, and wanted
to nest there. One bird (we believe it was always the same one)
couldn't be kept away, and came daily, sometimes bringing some
friends. As he passed among the dogs, which were barking and
trying to get at him, he stood and defied them all, and when we
turned out to try to drive him away, he offered to take us all on
too, and was finally saved against his will, and carried away by
Brocklehurst, a wildly struggling, unconquerable being.</p>
<p>The old birds enjoy play, while the young ones have no leisure
for play, being engrossed in satisfying the enormous appetites
they have when growing. Four or five Adelies were inlaying on the
ice-floe. One acted as leader, advanced to the edge of the floe,
waited for the others to line up, raised his flipper, when they
all dived in. In a few seconds they all popped out again, and
repeated the performance, always apparently directed by the one.
And so they went on for hours. While the <i>Nimrod</i> was frozen
in the pack, some dozens of them were disporting themselves in a
sea-pool alongside. They swam together in the duck fashion, then
at a squawk from one they all dived and came up at the other side
of the pool.</p>
<p>Early in October they began to arrive at the rookery, singly
or in pairs. The first to come were males, and they at once began
to scrape up the frozen ground to make hollows for their nests,
and to collect stones for the walls with which they surround
them. The digging is hard work and is done by the feet, the bird
lying prone and kicking out backward. As soon as any apology for
a nest is ready the males begin displaying, as shown in the
accompanying photograph. He points his bill vertically upwards,
flaps his wings slowly, inflates his chest, and makes a series of
low booming sounds, which increase in loudness, then die away
again, the throat vibrating strongly. Then he slowly subsides
into the usual attitude. We supposed this to be a part of his
courtship, or as some phrased it "advertising for a wife", but
there is good reason to suppose that the pairing is done before
the birds leave the sea. Generally the male's displaying passes
entirely disregarded. He continues it all through the
nesting-season, till the chicks are nearly fledged and the
moulting-time is near. An epidemic of displaying often took the
whole rookery at once, when the hens were mostly away disporting
themselves in the sea.</p>
<p>When the rookery is pretty well filled, and the nest-building
is in full swing, the birds have a busy and anxious time. To get
enough of suitable small stones is a matter of difficulty, and
may involve long journeys for each single stone. The temptation
is too strong for some of them, and they become habitual thieves.
The majority remain stupidly honest. Amusing complications
result. The bearing of the thief clearly shows that he knows he
is doing wrong. He has a conscience, at least a human conscience,
<i>i.e.</i>, the fear of being found out. Very different is the
furtive look of the thief, long after he is out of danger of
pursuit, from the expression of the honest penguin coming home
with a hard-earned stone.</p>
<p>An honest one was bringing stones from a long distance. Each
stone was removed by a thief as soon as the owner's back was
turned. The honest one looked greatly troubled as he found that
his heap didn't grow, but he seemed incapable of suspecting the
cause.</p>
<p>A thief, sitting on its own nest, was stealing from an
adjacent nest, whose honest owner was also at home, but looking
unsuspectingly in another direction. Casually he turned his head
and caught the thief in the act. The thief dropped the stone and
pretended to be busy picking up an infinitesimal crumb from the
neutral ground.</p>
<p>The stone gathering is a very strong part of the nesting
instinct. It was kept up while sitting on the eggs, and if at a
late stage they lost their eggs or young, they reverted to the
heaping of stones, which they did in a half-hearted way. Unmated
birds occupied the fringe of the rookery, and amused themselves
piling and stealing till the chicks began to hatch out.</p>
<p>After the two eggs were laid the males appeared to do most of
the work. At any hour the males predominated, a very few pairs
were at the nests, and relieving guard was rarely noticed. The
females were never seen in the majority. Those which had been
recently down to feed could be recognised by the fresh crustacea
round the nests. Judging by this sign, it would seem that some
birds never leave the nest to feed during the whole period of
incubation. Many birds lost their mates through the occasional
breaking loose of a dog. These birds couldn't leave the
nests.</p>
<p align="center"><small>REARING THE CHICKS</small><br></p>
<p>The rookery is most interesting after the chicks arrive. Many
curious things happen as they grow. The young clucks are silvery
or slaty-grey, with darker heads, which are for the first day or
so heavy and hang down helplessly. As soon as they are hatched
the mothers take equal share in tending them, whatever they may
have been doing before that. For some weeks the nest cannot be
left untended or the chicks would perish of cold or fall victims
to the skuas. The parents keep regular watches, going down in
turn to feed, and relieving guard is an interesting ceremony. The
bird just arrived from the sea hurries to the nest. It is anxious
to see the chick, and to feed it; the other is unwilling to
resign, but at last reluctantly gets off the nest, evidently very
stiff, stretches itself, and hangs about for a while before going
down to the sea.</p>

OF<br>
WELL-GROWN STRANGERS</small></p>
<p>When the young ones can hold up their heads the feeding
begins. At first the parent tries to induce its offspring to feed
by tickling its bill and throat. The old bird opens its mouth and
the chick puts its head right in and picks the food out of the
throat. The bird can be seen bringing it up into the throat by an
effort. If the young is unwilling to feed some food is thrown
right up on to the ground and a little of it picked up again and
placed on the chick's bill. After learning the way there is no
need for such inducement, and the parents are taxed to satisfy
the clamouring for more.</p>
<p>For some weeks after the young are hatched life in the rookery
goes smoothly along. One parent is always on the nest and the
young birds do not wander. Then the trouble begins. The young
begin to move about and if anything disturbs the colony they run
about in panic. As they don't know nest or parent they cannot
return home. They meet the case by adopting parents, and run
under any bird they come to. The old birds resent this and a
chick is often pecked away from nest after nest till exhausted.
The skuas get some at this time, but it is surprising how few.
Most of the chicks take some old one unawares and get in the
nest. She may have a chick already, or chicks, but as she doesn't
know which is her own she cannot drive the intruder away. A
sorely puzzled bird may be seen trying to cover four gigantic
chicks. Some of the less precocious youngsters stay at home long
enough to get to know the nest, and can find their way home after
wandering a few yards. Such homes keep together a little
longer.</p>
<p>The time comes when both parents must be absent together to
get enough food for the growing chicks. Then the social order of
the rookery breaks down and chaos begins. The social condition
which is evolved out of the chaos is one of the most remarkable
in nature, yet it serves its purpose and saves the race. A kind
of communism is established, but the old birds have no part in
it. They cherish the fiction that they have nests and children,
and when they come up from the sea after feeding it is their
intention to find the nest and feed their own young only. The
young ones for their part establish a community of parents, and
yet it isn't exactly that either, though it works out as if it
were. It is each bird for itself. The chick assumes the first old
one that comes within its reach to be its parent. Perhaps it
really thinks so, as they are all alike.</p>
<p>An old bird, coming up full of shrimps, is met by clamorous
youngsters before it has time to begin the search for its
hypothetical home. They order it to stand and deliver. It objects
and scolds, and runs off. It may be by the irony of fate that it
is its own young which accost it, but it can't know that. The
chickens are both imperative and wheedling. Then begins one of
those parent hunts which were so familiar at the end of the
season. The end is never in doubt from the first. Every now and
again the old one stops and expostulates. This shows weakness.
There is no indecision on the part of the young one. It never
seems anxious as to the result, but in the most matter-of-fact
and persistent manner hunts the old one down. The hunts are often
long and exhausting. One chase was witnessed at Pony Lake beside
the camp. Nine times they circled the lake, and the hunt was not
over when the watcher had to leave. On that occasion they must
have travelled miles. At the end the old one stops, and still
spluttering and protesting, delivers up. One would think that in
these circumstances the weaker chicks would go to the wall, but
it does not appear to be so. There are no ill-nourished young
ones to be seen. Perhaps the hunts take so long that all get a
chance.</p>
<p>A few days after the eggs began to hatch there was a severe
blizzard, which lasted several days. Snow was banked up round
most of the birds. A snowdrift crossed the densest part of the
rookery partly burying many birds. In the deepest part nests and
birds were covered out of sight, and the only indication of the
whereabouts of a bird was a little funnel in the snow, at the
bottom of which an anxious eye could be seen. Many less deeply
buried birds had freed one wing or both, which became stiff with
cold, as they could not be got back again. The snow, melting by
the heat of their bodies, and refreezing, made walls of ice round
the birds. Many got alarmed and left the nests, when the snow
fell in and buried them. In the warm sunny weather that followed
the melting snow filled many nests with pools of water. Some
birds showed ingenuity in dealing with these floods. They moved
their nests, stone by stone (always keeping a hollow for the eggs
or chicks) as much as their own width till they reached dry
ground. While the snowdrift remained some birds whose nests were
buried scraped hollows in the snow and collected a few stones. On
a moderate estimate about half the young perished in this
blizzard.</p>
<p>The old Adelies do not mind the cold. Their thick blubber and
dense fur sufficiently protect them. In a blizzard they will lie
still and let the snow cover them. Going to the rookery once
after a blizzard I could see no penguins; they had entirely
disappeared. Suddenly at some movement or noise I was surrounded
by them; they had sprung up out of the snow.</p>
<p align="center"><small>DOMESTIC ENTANGLEMENTS</small><br></p>
<p>While the Adelie appears to be entirely moral in his domestic
arrangements, his stupidity (or his short-sightedness which
causes him to seem stupid) gives rise to many domestic
complications. No doubt the presence of our camp upset the social
economy, and probably when undisturbed nothing of the kind would
occur. He has little sense of locality and one little heap of
stones is very like another, yet pairs seem to have no means of
recognising one another but by the rendezvous of the nest.
Husbands and wives, parents and children, do not know one
another, but if found at the nest are accepted as <i>bonâ
fide</i>.</p>
<p>All the birds go to their nests without hesitation when they
come from the sea by the familiar route, but if taken from their
nests to some other part of the rookery some find their way back
without difficulty, others are quite lost. They are most puzzled
when moved only a little away from home, and they will fight to
keep another bird's nest while their own is only a couple of feet
away. A bird will defend an egg or chick in the nest, but if it
is removed just outside it will peck at it and destroy it.</p>
<p>Considering these facts it will be evident that if the rookery
be disturbed confusion follows. A mere walk among the nests
caused innumerable entanglements. One bird would leave the nest
in fright, flop down a yard away beside a nest already occupied,
or on a nest left exposed by another scared bird. Then one-sided
fights would begin, one bird attacking another under the
impression that it had usurped its nest, the rightful owner
troubling little about the vicious pecking he was receiving,
sitting calmly in conscious rectitude. A fight of this Idnd has
been watched for an hour at a time, three neighbouring nests
having been disturbed. One bird had got into another's nest, a
second was trying to establish a claim to the occupied nest of a
third, and meanwhile the chicks of number one were neglected in
the cold. A bird which had no family came and covered the chicks,
but looked conscious of wrong doing and kept ready to bolt on a
second's notice. All these birds but the last wanted their own
nests and were within a yard of them without knowing it.</p>
<p>In all such cases, even when a bird got established on the
wrong nest, there was always an adjustment afterwards. When they
calmed down they became uneasy, probably observing the landmarks
more critically, and would even leave a nest with chicks for
their own empty nest. A chick removed from the nest and put
alongside was not recognised, and the old bird never seemed to
connect the facts of the empty nest and the chick beside it. If a
chick were taken from the nest under the old bird's very eyes and
held in front of it, it was always the chick that was viciously
attacked, not the aggressor.</p>
<p>Some experiments were tried on them in order to trace the
workings of the penguin mind. If a man stood between a bird and
its nest so as to prevent it from getting onto it, the bird would
make many attempts to reach home, rushing furiously at the man.
After a time it would appear to meditate, and then walk off
rather disconsolately, make a tour of the colony to which it
belonged, and approach the nest from another side. It appeared
greatly astonished that the intruder was still there. This
curious trait was often seen. It is like the ostrich burying its
head in the sand and imagining it is safe, or like a man refusing
to believe his own eyes. It appears to think that if it takes a
turn round, or comes to its nest from the other side, the
horrible vision will disappear.</p>
<p>A bird was taken from a nest which had a chick in it and put
down at a little distance. Meantime the chick was put in a
neighbour's nest. Presently the bird came running up. It started
back on seeing the empty nest, not in alarm or fear, but exactly
as if thinking; "I've come to the wrong house!" trotted off to a
distant part of the rookery. Her reasoning seemed to be this:
"There was a chick in my nest, therefore this empty nest can't be
mine." She couldn't imagine the chick leaving the nest, and so
never searched for it. It was only a yard from the nest all the
time. After half an hour's searching in vain for any place like
home she returned to the nest, and accepted the restored chick as
a matter of course.</p>
<p>A lost chick was never sought for. There would be no use; it
couldn't be recognised. On account of this peculiarity we were
able to make many readjustments of the family arrangements. When
the blizzard destroyed so many chicks we distributed the young
from nests where there were two to nests where there were none.
They were usually adopted eagerly and the plan was quite
successful.</p>
<p>When both birds are at a nest that is disturbed, or when the
mate comes up from feeding to relieve guard, there is an
interchange of civilities in the form of a loud squawking in
unison, accompanied by a curious movement. The birds' necks are
crossed, and at each squawk they are changed from side to side,
first right then left. The harsh complaining clamour which they
make was for long mistaken for quarrelling.</p>
<p>A bird returning from the sea came to the wrong nest and tried
to enter into conversation with the occupant, who would have
nothing to do with him. She knew her mate had just gone off for
the day, and wouldn't be such a fool as to come back too early,
so she sat still, indifferent to the squawking of the other. A
look of distress came into his face as he failed to get any
response, and he was slow to realise that he had made a
mistake.</p>
<p>A small colony was found with about two dozen large chicks,
unattended by any old birds. They were driven across the lake to
a larger colony. Half-way over a few old birds were squatted,
enjoying a rest. When the chicks saw them they ran up to them
joyfully, saying: "Here's pa and ma, hooray!" To their surprise
they got the reverse of a cordial welcome, being driven away with
vicious peckings. They were driven on to the larger colony and
were swallowed up in it.</p>
<p>The Adelies are not demonstrative of their affections. It is
difficult to discover if they have any beyond the instinctive
affection for the young. The pairing appears to be a purely
business matter, and the mates don't even show any power to
recognise one another. A penguin was injured by the dogs, but it
seemed possible that it might recover, so we did not at once put
it out of pain. In a couple of days it died. Shortly after we
noticed a live penguin standing by it. We removed the dead bird
to a distance, and after a while found the other standing beside
it as before. It was the general opinion that it was the dead
bird's mate which had found it out. Such an action is entirely
opposed to what we expect after a long study of their habits.
There are always plenty of dead birds about a rookery, and the
living go about entirely indifferent to them. It is puzzling in
any point of view, but it is less difficult to believe that the
bird found its dead mate than that it took an interest in a dead
stranger.</p>
<p align="center"><small>ALTRUISM</small><br></p>
<p>When the young birds are well grown if there is an alarm they
flock together, and any old birds present in the colony form a
wall of defence between the young and the enemy. This habit has
given rise to the belief that they are somewhat communistic in
their social order, and that the defence of the colony is a
concerted action. It is not so. Each bird is defending its own
young one only, and will often fight with another of the
defending birds, or peck at any young one which comes in its
way.</p>
<p>There are real instances of altruism or kindness to strangers.
Our passage through the rookery frightened away the parent of a
very young chick. A bird passing at the distance of a few yards
noticed it and came over to it. He cocked his head on one side
and looked at it, as if saying: "Hullo! this little beggar's
deserted; must do something for him." He tickled its bill, as the
parents do when coaxing the very young chicks to feed, but it was
too much frightened to feed. After coaxing it in this way for
some time he turned away and put some food upon the ground, and,
lifting a little in his bill, he put some on each side of the
chick's bill. Just then the rightful parent returned and the
helper ran off. This was not an isolated case, but was observed
on several occasions.</p>
<p>One incident seemed to reveal true social instinct. From a
small colony of about two dozen nests all the eggs but one were
taken in order to find out if the birds would lay again. As it
turned out they did not. The birds sat on their empty nests for
some time, then they disappeared. When the time came for the
solitary egg to hatch, about a dozen of the nests were reoccupied
and the birds took their share in defending the one chick.</p>
<p align="center"><small>DEPARTURE OF THE YOUNG</small><br></p>
<p>When they have shed most of their down the young birds
congregate at the edge of the sea. They cease from hunting the
old ones for food, and appear to be waiting for something. When
the right time comes, which they seem to know perfectly, they
dive into the sea, sometimes in small parties, sometimes singly,
disappear for a time, and may be seen popping up far out to sea.
They dive and come up very awkwardly, but swim well.</p>

<p align="center"><small>96. EMPERORS AT REST</small></p>
<p>It is marvellous how fully instinct makes these birds
independent. The parents do not take them to the water and teach
them to swim. They haven't even the example of the old birds,
which stay behind to moult. At an early age they become
independent of their own parents, and earn their living by
hunting any old bud they find. Though they have spent their lives
on land, and only know that food is something found in an old
bird's throat, when the time comes they leave the land and plunge
boldly into the sea, untaught, to get their living by straining
crustacea out of the water in the same way as the whale does.</p>
<p>Some of our party reported that they saw penguins teaching the
young to swim, but if this ever happens it is not general. Time
and again the young have been watched leaving as described,
entirely of their own accord. At that season nearly all the old
birds are in the moult and never venture into the water.</p>
<p>Like the Emperor the Adelie is fond of travelling when family
cares are off his mind. The great blizzard which wiped out half
the rookery left hundreds of old birds free. They began to
explore the adjacent country in bands. The round of the lakes was
a favourite trip and broad beaten roads marked this route. Tracks
also led to the summits of some of the hills, though the
short-sighted Adelie could hardly go there for the view.</p>
<p>There was no general trek southwards, such as the Emperors
made, yet the Southern Party found tracks of two at a distance of
some eighty miles from the sea.</p>
<p align="center"><small>NEBUCHADNEZZAR AND
NICODEMUS</small><br></p>
<p>These names dignified two penguin chicks. While chaos reigned
in the rookery I found them exhausted and covered with mire,
having been hunted and pecked through the rookery. They were
taken to the house, put in a large cage in the porch, and fed by
hand with sardines and fish-cakes. The feeding was disagreeable.
They didn't like the food and shook it out of their bills in
disgust. So it was necessary to force it down their throats till
it was beyond their reach.</p>
<p>In a few days they became quite tame and recognised those who
fed them. Familiar only with our peculiar method of feeding them,
one of them indicated when he was hungry by taking my finger into
his bill. We shortened their names to Nebby and Nicky, and they
answered to them, but they answered equally readily to the common
name of Bill. The sounds of the rookery reached them and
sometimes greatly excited them, and they made desperate efforts
to get through the netting of their cage. At these times we would
take them out for a walk. They made no attempt to go to the
rookery, and were rather frightened.</p>
<p>Nebuchadnezzar was a very friendly little fellow, and would
follow me about outside, and come running when called. The
feeding was unnatural, and for this reason doubtless in a few
weeks they died.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE RINGED PENGUIN</small><br></p>
<p>A single ringed penguin appeared at Cape Royds at the end of
the breeding-season, just as the Adelies were beginning to moult.
No ringed penguin had been seen in this part of the Antarctic
before. It was evidently a stray one which had come ashore to
moult. It is about the same size as the Adelie, but is more
agile. It was at the season when the young Adelies go off to sea.
At a little distance the ringed penguin, among a crowd of old
Adelies, looked somewhat like a young Adelie with the white
throat. I picked him up by the legs to investigate. To my
surprise he curled round and bit me on the hand. An Adelie could
not do so. A closer examination showed what he was.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="colpicF" id="colpicF"></a><img alt=""

<p align="center"><small>F. RETURN OF THE PENGUINS</small></p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>THE SKUA GULL</small><br></p>
<p>Some hundreds of skuas nested in the neighbourhood of Cape
Royds. At Green Lake and Coast Lake they were aggregated in what
were known as skuaries. Coast Lake was the most populous skuary.
Elsewhere they were widely scattered over the lower hills. There
is no doubt that they are not social or even gregarious birds,
and that they congregate at such places as Coast Lake out of
their fondness for fresh-water bathing. They do not love their
kind, nor have they any inducement to. Skua will prey on
skua.</p>
<p>They are callous, greedy, vulturous and disgusting. They may
be seen sitting in a circle round a sick or wounded penguin, and
they have been suspected of meditating an attack on the eyes of a
sleeping man. When the young penguins are hatching they squat
down right among the nests waiting for a chance to snatch
one.</p>
<p>When they have eggs or young they swoop down on an intruder in
a menacing manner, which is rather alarming when one knows how
sharp and strong are their bills and claws. They rarely strike,
however, thinking better of it at the last moment, and swerving
suddenly upwards. When they do strike it is probably through
miscalculation. Some birds were known which did habitually strike
at every swoop. These blows did no damage, as if they come in
front one involuntarily ducks, and from any other direction they
strike the cap only.</p>
<p>They were very bitter against dogs, and gave no attention to
men when they were present. Several of the dogs had learned to
eat skua eggs, and the birds no doubt knew of this. They have a
harsh cry, and the shrill chorus that went up when we had failed
to find a nest sounded very much like laughter. They are very
quarrelsome. When the rookery was strewn with fresh penguin
carcases, victims of some dogs which had broken loose, the skuas
would fight viciously over one, when there were plenty for
all.</p>
<p>The skua has no true courage like the penguin. On one occasion
we snared a skua and dragged it by a string into the midst of a
small colony of penguins in order to see how these ancient
enemies would behave when brought together. The penguins nearest
to the skua pecked at it without leaving their nests. It bit and
scratched for a very short while, and then gave it up and made no
attempt to defend itself, though it was not hurt. As it lay
motionless some one called out that the poor thing was killed,
and we began to feel remorse for our cruel experiment, but when
thrown up into the air the skua did not come down again. The
bird's one virtue is cleanliness. It enjoys its bath. Wherever
there is a pool of fresh water the skuas may be seen splashing
with great gusto, and they will bathe in a sea pool on
occasion.</p>
<p align="center"><small>WHALES</small><br></p>
<p>In summer whales were locally abundant, though nowhere else in
such numbers as we saw in the Bay of Whales at the Great Barrier.
As long as there was open water small schools of finners and
larger ones of killers were seen daily in McMurdo Sound. Even
when the Sound was densely filled with pack, they came to the
little sea-pools. For a long time in winter no whales were
reported.</p>

THEIR<br>
BLOW-HOLES</small></p>
<p>The finner with its little fin about half-way along the back,
and its long pointed head, came very near, and often grazed the
ship. One came vertically up close by the ship's side, the snout
ten or twelve feet out of the water. As usual in such emergencies
none of the cameras were ready.</p>
<p>The killers were often in family parties, or a few families
together, some bulls of great size, with magnificent triangular
fin, like a boat's sail, six or eight feet long, the cows with
much smaller, often curved tin, the calves following close by
their mothers' tails to avoid getting lost. Some very small
calves were seen in January.</p>
<p>The humpback, with little rounded fin set far back, and the
bottle-nose were rarely seen.</p>
<p>The killer sometimes rested his head on the edge of a floe and
looked about with his wicked little eye for a seal or penguin.
These he would try to knock off by rising under the floe, and on
one occasion a party of three men, who spent an anxious
twenty-four hours adrift on a floe, related that the killers were
trying this experiment with them.</p>
<p align="center"><small>SEALS</small><br></p>
<p>Of the four Antarctic seals only the Weddell was common at
Cape Royds. The crabeater kept to the pack and rarely came on
shore. The sea-leopard and the Ross seal were very rare.</p>
<p>The Weddell seal, or false sea-leopard, is a large and heavy
animal. The skin and blubber of one large seal made a full sledge
load. When it lies peacefully on the ice it is a shapeless lump.
If disturbed, as for instance by putting your foot on it or
throwing a dog at it, it shows ludicrous astonishment, curves
both ends towards the intruder, open its mouth astonishingly
wide, gasps and bleats with fear, its eyes starting from its
head. It is slow to think of escaping, though its blow-hole may
be close by, and prefers to roll over sideways.</p>
<p>Sometimes the Weddells pretend to be very fierce, and open the
mouth to emit a kind of bellow, but they have no belief in their
own fierceness and are usually looping away before the roar has
time to frighten the enemy. In autumn as many as one hundred
Weddells have been counted together on the ice of one little bay.
Even in winter they came up through the tide-cracks occasionally,
though sometimes several weeks would pass without any being seen.
They used the holes which we kept open for dredging as
blow-holes, and sometimes they reached there in a very exhausted
condition, as evidenced by their distressed breathing. At these
seasons there might be no other breathing-space for a long
distance.</p>
<p>The nearest rookery of Weddells was at Inaccessible Island,
about eight miles from the camp. When the first young were born
early in November we ran out frequently by motor-car to watch
them. They were in no way alarmed by the car.</p>
<p>The newly born calves, in their rough grey fur, already tried
the intimidating roar, but there was more fear than fierceness in
it. They can snap their lower jaws against the upper very
rapidly, but without much force.</p>
<p>Some of the mothers were very cowardly, and made for the
blow-holes, leaving the young to their fate. Others made a
determined stand against the intruders and looked so much like
business that we didn't care to venture too near, and a few
carried the war into the enemy's country and ran at us and chased
us off. The rough coat is cast and the smooth spotted skin like
the adult appears at a very early age. In the middle of November
we could scarcely find any that hadn't more or less moulted.</p>

<p align="center"><small>104. SOME OF THE DOGS</small></p>
<p>The crabeater can move much faster on ice or land than the
Weddell. When not frightened it progresses in the same way as the
Weddell, arching the back in caterpillar fashion very rapidly.
When alarmed and excited it goes along for a short time in
another manner, sweeping the tail end from side to side, much as
a fish swims and actually gets forward a little in this way. A
crabeater is able to hold its own against one dog, though it
might be overcome by several. A fight between one and the dog
Erebus lasted for an hour, if it could be called a fight where
they never came to close quarters. The lighter dog circled about,
snapping at the seal's neck and flippers. The crabeater always
turned smartly enough to be ready for him and frequently made a
feint of moving in one direction, then made a sudden turn and
snap, drawing his head close down to his shoulders and shooting
it out as he snapped, just as the sea-leopard is said to do. It
was much more fatiguing for the heavy seal than for the dog, and
it breathed heavily, making a continuous sound with its nostrils
like snoring, but at the end of the hour it was still able to
take care of itself. It became very angry as the dog's attack
continued, whereas the Weddell after any amount of baiting only
seems more and more astonished.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE DOGS</small><br></p>
<p>Our dogs, though of an originally Siberian strain, were reared
in the mild climate of New Zealand, being the descendants of dogs
left there some generations ago by a returning expedition. They
were small, and showed evidence of crossing with ignoble races.
Yet they showed no sign of degeneracy in their ability to endure
the unaccustomed severe climate, and on the short journeys for
which they were used they did splendid work.</p>
<p>They revelled in the cold, enjoyed nothing so much as a roll
and a fight in a snowdrift, and wouldn't use the kennels provided
for them, preferring to curl up in the snow, at most in the
shelter of the kennels, or to be on anything dark, such as a
coal-bag. They showed some characteristics of the wild northern
dog, and some had traces of their wolf ancestry. Gwen was purely
wolfish in her wildness and impatience of restraint, and her son
Terror was like her. It was attempted once to muzzle Gwen, after
some penguin hunting exploit, but she nearly went mad in her
efforts to get rid of the muzzle, turning and twisting so rapidly
that the eye couldn't follow her, and she had to be freed from
it.</p>
<p>The struggle for kingship was not so sanguinary as is common
with such dogs. Old Scamp's authority was never seriously
disputed, though Trip and Wolf occasionally fought him. Scamp was
not the heaviest or strongest dog, but he downed them all by his
vehemence. The females were very jealous, and were apt to eat one
another's litters. They make very good mothers. A litter was born
on the <i>Nimrod</i> while going south. After we landed one of
these pups was killed by the fall of a house during a blizzard.
The body was flung out on the hill-side, some distance away. The
mother. Possum, discovered it and nursed it for a whole day.
Though somewhat fierce and quarrelsome among themselves, the dogs
were very friendly to man. They would take the severest beating
when they had been misbehaving, and be friends the moment it was
over.</p>
<p>The young pups, born in the Antarctic, were very self-reliant
little things. When very young they used to issue from their
shelter, run out in the snow and bark in defiance of everything.
They got their drinking-water for a long time in the form of
snow, and when summer came and water was given to them, they did
not know what to make of it at first. They soon learned to
appreciate it, and to consider it as the most valuable of all
things, for of food there was always superabundance. In late
summer, when the snow had nearly all disappeared, and the lake by
the house was frozen, then came a sort of water famine. We had no
time to break the ice and give them water more than once a day.
They got pretty thirsty in the sun, and some of them showed a
good deal of intelligence in asking for and dealing with
water.</p>
<p>One day, on going out of the house, I heard the dog Roland
barking furiously. Roland was tied at a good distance from the
house, and for some time I paid no attention to the barking. When
at last I looked in the right direction, Roland picked up her
water tin and waved it frantically over her head.</p>
<p>An old dog, Wolf, was so convinced of the value of water that,
when a bowlful was given to him, he did not drink it all at once,
but tried to keep a reserve for future use. He tried to bury it,
as dogs habitually do with food. He carried the bowl carefully in
his mouth, placed it in a hollow, and covered it up with gravel.
Of course he lost the water, but the attempt deserved
success.</p>
<p>In their hunting they showed much intelligence. They took much
greater liberties with the helpless Weddell seal than with the
more active and aggressive crabeater, and as for the sea-leopard
they seemed to know enough to leave him alone altogether. They
hunted in couples or parties, and so got the better of the
penguins. The penguins appear to be provided with efficient
defensive weapons, but the dogs learned where to seize them
safely. While one dog kept the attention of a penguin in front,
another slipped round behind it and snapped at its leg. Some
bolder dogs attacked the penguin in front, waiting for chance to
bite at the neck. One snap finished the fight, the dogs usually
leaving the disabled bird to chase a fresh one.</p>
<p>After learning that penguin hunting was a punishable offence
the dogs became very cunning. They slipped away on their hunting
expeditions, without attracting attention, and the first
intimation we had of it was the distant barking as they
surrounded some poor bird. Though they could have but little
experience of the effect of shooting they stood in wholesome
terror of a gun. Daisy and Gwen especially knew that a gun could
hurt at a distance, and that flight was useless, so they slunk
home when a shot was fired, keeping cover as far as possible, and
hid below the house.</p>
<p>Daisy was the most inveterate hunter, and regularly took her
children away to teach them to become self-supporting. At last
her propensity led her, there is no reason to doubt, to a painful
death. She took her whole family once out hunting on the
pack-ice. The pack was blown out and the dogs were given up for
lost. Some days later they all came back, having evidently had a
trying experience, their faces matted with blood and sea salt.
Emboldened perhaps by this escape, Daisy again went hunting on
the pack, taking Roland with her, and again the pack went out to
sea. Roland returned, but Daisy never did.</p>
<p>When taken for a walk through the rookery, the dogs bore
themselves with a most virtuous air, looking with indifference at
the penguins as if they had no idea what they were good for. When
detected penguin-worrying, old Scamp made for his kennel, and sat
there pretending he had never been away, looking very innocent,
overlooking the fact that he was dripping with blood.</p>
<p align="center"><small>MARINE BIOLOGY</small><br></p>
<p>Towards mid-winter the ice in a little bay, bounding Cape
Royds on the south, was strong enough to permit of dredging at
depths of from six to twenty fathoms. The bottom here was a fine
black mud, with larger and small pebbles of kenyte in it. In the
mud were embedded large shell-fish, the fragile purple Pecten,
the siphon-bearing Anatina, and others. On the pebbles were
growing bush-like sponges, and large sea-anemones adhered to
them. One or two reddish-brown sea-weeds were plentiful and once
or twice we brought up great turnip-like fixed tunicates. Ugly
and greedy big-headed fishes (<i>Nototheia</i>), and equally
greedy carnivorous whelks of a large size (<i>Neobuccinum</i>)
crowded to any bait put down.</p>
<p>Among the sponges and seaweeds were numerous other forms of
fife, tube-dwelling worms with beautiful flower-like heads of
tentacles; delicate shells, almost invisible to the naked eye,
many larger and smaller crustacea, though none of any
considerable size; hairy worms like the sea-mouse with a double
row of phosphorescent lamps, flashing in succession from head to
tail. When captured these worms have a spiteful habit of breaking
themselves up into small pieces.</p>
<p>In this region there is a prevalence of yellow and orange-red
colours. The commonest sponges are yellow; so is the sea-anemone.
Some of the corals are very bright orange.</p>
<p>Most of the crustacea and many worms, starfish, &amp;c., are
orange-red or yellow. All these are bottom forms of life. With
the available methods of collecting very little was got in the
open water of the sea, away from the bottom, only a few small
crustacea, some diatirus, and occasionally a few sea-butterflies
(<i>Pteropods</i>) of large size and red colour.</p>
<p>The phosphorescence remarked in some of the bottom worms was
also found in the copepods of the open sea. The phosphorescence
is displayed by cold-blooded animals, living in a temperature
always some degrees below the freezing-point of fresh water, and
it is shown equally throughout the winter.</p>
<p>Dredging at greater depths than twenty fathoms was rarely
possible, owing to the nearness of open water in McMurdo Sound,
always within a mile of the camp. From this cause we did no deep
dredging at all, only on one or two occasions at nearly one
hundred fathoms. From the mouth of the bay down to the depth of
one hundred fathoms the bottom sloped steeply. Whether from this
cause or owing to the strong current in the sound, there was no
mud in this zone of the bottom. In the shallower parts there were
large and small kenyte pebbles, but at fifty fathoms and upwards
no pebbles were got. The bottom appears to be carpeted with a
dense growth of living things, as if the dredge merely bit and
was immediately drawn up it was usually full of stuff.</p>
<p>In this deeper region the animal life differed greatly from
that in the muddy bay, though many kinds were found throughout
both places. Here we first got the long-legged sea-spiders
(<i>Pycnogonida</i>), glassy sponges, the white shells of Lima,
the delicate lace-corals, &amp;c. The sponges were especially
abundant and in some variety, though rarely of much beauty. One
glassy sponge resembled an egg, with bundles of long glassy
spicules projecting at regular intervals from the smooth
surface.</p>
<p>In this region there was less orange and yellow colouring, the
tendency being to white. Most of the glass sponges and many of
the horny sponges were white or pale cream-coloured, and the Lima
shells and lace corals were white. There were still some yellow
sponges and most of the sea-spiders were reddish. At this depth
we got the same fish as in the bay. A fish-trap, baited, was put
down at twenty-five fathoms. It caught some dozens of pretty
large big-heads the first time it was drawn, and almost nothing
afterwards, unless left for a considerable time. This seems to
indicate that they are pretty plentiful, but that they grub very
closely among the sponges and don't travel fast or far, so that
the first haul exhausts the region immediately around the trap.
When the trap was brought up great red worms hung like ribbons,
one yard, or even two yards, below the trap. These could contract
until they would lie on the palm of the hand.</p>

<small>AND</small><br>
RAYMOND E. PRIESTLEY, <small>GEOLOGIST TO THE
EXPEDITION</small></h4>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>INTRODUCTORY.</small><br></p>
<p><b>THE</b> conclusions provisionally adopted in these notes
are based on the geological collections and observations obtained
by the Southern Party, the Western Party, and the Northern Party
of our expedition as well as by the whole party, when in winter
quarters at Cape Royds.</p>
<p>The only determinable fossil as yet found in the great Beacon
sandstone formation of Antarctica, the piece of coniferous wood,
figured in these notes, was obtained from the collection made by
the Southern Party.</p>
<p>As a result of the explorations, chiefly by Nordenskjold,
Larsen, Gunnar Andersson, Bruce, Charcot and Arçtowski, we now
know the following about the portion of Antarctica south of
America.</p>
<p>In parts of Graham Land there must be a foundation platform of
gneiss and gneissic granite, as boulders of these rocks, several
metres in diameter, are found deposited on the plateau of Seymour
Island, to the east of Graham Land, as recorded by Gunnar
Andersson.</p>
<p>In 1903 the French Antarctic expedition, under the command of
Dr. Charcot, landed on the South Shetland Islands, and after
exploring Palmer Archipelago and Gerlache Strait wintered at
Wandel Island. An interesting and detailed account of the
geological specimens collected has been given by Dr. E. Gourdon.*
Amongst the rocks described are hornblende granites, quartz
diorites, uralitic gabbros, trachyandesites with hornblende and
mica, dacites and andesites with associated tuffs, labradorite
rocks, diabase basalts, micro-granites with pyroxene and
soda-hornblende. He also describes crystalline schists,
quartzites and quartz veins.</p>

<p>Dr. Gourdon concludes that these rocks are part of the
eruptive series of the chain of the Andes. Nordenskjold is of the
same opinion in regard to the eruptives of Graham Land.</p>
<p>In the South Orkneys fossil graptolites, associated with
radiolarian jaspers, were discovered by Bruce's expedition. These
prove the existence there of older Palæozoic rocks, considered to
be of Ordovician age. As far as we can learn there is as yet no
evidence of the presence, in that region, of rocks older than
Ordovician, unless some of the crystalline rocks of south-western
Graham Land, such as those of Borchgrevink Nunatak, &amp;c.,
antedate that period.</p>
<p>The abundant fossil plants discovered by Nordenskjold's
expedition at Hope Bay, at the north-eastern end of Graham Land,
show that in that region, now continuously covered with ice and
snow, there existed in Jurassic times a rich and diversified
flora embracing ferns, cycads and conifers. Amongst the plants
found at Hope Bay the genera <i>Sagenopteris</i>,
<i>Thinfeldia</i>, <i>Cladophlebis</i>, <i>Pterophyllum</i>, and
<i>Otozamites</i> have been recorded as well from the Trias-Jura
rocks of Eastern Australia and India, some of the forms being
found also in South Africa and in the Argentine Republic. The
distribution is shown on the following table:</p>

<p>So far no trace has been found in this flora of any
representatives of the <i>Glossopteris</i> Flora of Gondwana
Land, such as the <i>Phyllotheca</i> discovered by Gunnar
Andersson in the Falkland Islands. Evidently in Jurassic time a
mild and a moist climate prevailed in Antarctica.</p>
<p>The abundance of Cretaceous <i>Ammonites</i> collected by the
Nordenskjold expedition at Snow Hill Island, to the east of
Graham Land, points to a continuance of mild conditions into
cretaceous time. The fossil Araucaria, Beech, &amp;c., unearthed
by the Nordenskjold expedition at Seymour Island, adjoining Snow
Hill Island on the north-east, prove that these mild conditions
were further prolonged into some part of Tertiary time.</p>
<p>In marine strata, also of Tertiary age, and considered by
Wilckens** to belong to Upper Oligocene or Lower Miocene, the
Nordenskjold expedition found numerous bird bones since referred
to five new genera, of penguins*** besides two vertebra? of a big
mammal, referred to the genus <i>Zeuglodon</i>. The marine
fossils associated with these remains enabled Wilckens to come to
the above decision as to the geological age of the formation.</p>

<p>At Cockburn Island, to the north of Seymour Island, Gunnar
Andersson describes a Pecten conglomerate 160 metres above
sea-level. This marine formation he considers to be probably of
Pliocene age, and the equivalent of the Parana beds of the north
of the Argentine Republic or of the Cape Fairweather beds of
Southern Patagonia.</p>
<p>Nordenskjold's expedition proved that during the maximum
glaciation, in late Geological time, the inland ice rose 300
metres higher than it does at present, in the neighbourhood of
Borchgrevink Nunatak, at the south-east end of Graham Land. This
was proved by the maximum height of erratic boulders found on the
slopes of the nunatak, above the present level of the surface of
the inland ice sheet. Gunnar Andersson mentions the occurrence of
raised beaches at Cockburn Island and also at Sidney Herbert
Sound.</p>
<p>These pieces of evidence prove an emergence of the land, since
the maximum glaciation, to the extent at all events of a few
metres, possibly as much as forty metres.</p>
<p>In the portion of the Antarctic visited by the German
expedition, 1902, under the leadership of Professor E. von
Drygalski, the following information has been obtained:</p>
<p>In latitude 66° 48' South, longitude 89° 30' East, there rises
at the edge of the inland ice a ridge-shaped remnant of a
volcanic cone, the Gaussberg. This attains a height of 366 metres
above the sea, and is formed of leucite-basalt tuff and
leucite-basalt rich in olivine, lumps up to the size of one's
fist being found in the lava. The top and slopes of the
Gaussberg, as recorded by Dr. Philippi, are strewn with
erratics.* These are formed of whitish garnet-bearing gneiss, a
darker biotite-gneiss, mica-schist, fragments of red quartzite,
&amp;c. The crystalline rocks are considered to be probably of
Archæan age.</p>

<p>In the Victoria Land region of the Antarctic the researches of
Ross, Borchgrevink, and above all of Captain R. F. Scott and the
geologist of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, H. T. Ferrar, prove
that there is developed in that region an ancient complex of
gneisses and gneissic granites, with mica-schists, calc-schists
and quartzites, and that these rocks are capped for a great
distance by a formation almost horizontally bedded, called by
Ferrar the "Beacon sandstone". A little argillaceous limestone
was observed by him associated with this sandstone. Ferrar found
plant remains in the sandstone, but in such an altered condition
that they could not be determined. Ferrar has given a detailed
and very valuable description of the geology of Victoria Land and
Ross Island explored by him on this expedition. The petrology of
the rocks collected has been worked out by G. T. Prior.**</p>
<p class="foot">[** National Antarctic Expedition, I901-1904,
Natural History, Vol. i.. Geology. British Museum, 1902.]</p>
<p>Amongst volcanic rocks are comprised hornblende-basalts,
olivine-basalts, dolerites, basalt tuffs, kenytes, phonolitic
trachytes and phonolites. Amongst the foundation rocks of South
Victoria Land, Prior records crystalline limestones with
chondrodite, gneiss, granites, diorites, camptonites, kersantites
and banakite. Amongst the sedimentary rocks he refers to
sandstones, somewhat carbonaceous, as well as black shaly to
slaty rocks.</p>
<p>The volcanic rocks, as pointed out by Prior, are closely
allied in chemical composition and mineral constitution to the
volcanic series described by Dr. P. Marshall, from the
neighbourhood of Dunedin, New Zealand. It may be noted that these
volcanic rocks are developed partly along the coastline of
Victoria Land, partly in islands arranged in lines subparallel to
this coastline.</p>
<p>It is worthy of comment that the volcanic zones of Victoria
Land were not definitely traced by Mr. Shackleton in the ranges
reached by him in his furthest south journey this year. No trace
whatever of volcanic rocks was noticed by him, either <i>in
situ</i> or in the moraines of the vast coast range which bounds
the Great Ice Barrier on its south-west side, near the latitude
of 84° to 86° South.</p>
<p align="center"><small>PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY</small><br></p>
<p>These observations relate wholly to the region between the
meridians of 170° East and 150° West. The shoreline in this
region of the Antarctic continent is deeply indented by the Ross
Sea. This commences just south of the parallel of 70°, and
extends to the parallel of 78° South. Ross Sea is bounded at its
east side by dense belts of pack-ice and low snowbergs, which
prevent any view of the coast-line being obtained excepting near
the extreme south-east corner of Ross Sea; there. Captain Scott,
in the <i>Discovery</i>, found a new range of mountains rising
from a land afterwards known as King Edward VII Land. Southwards
Ross Sea is bounded by the cliff of the Great Ice Barrier, which
has an extent of about 470 miles in an east and west direction.
This cliff averages about 150 ft. in height. In places it sinks
to nearly sea-level in low gullies. The surface beyond this Great
Barrier, except for certain broad shallow undulations and small
snow ridges (sastrugi). is practically level. Mr. Shackleton, on
his southern journey, proved that it extends southward for at
least 350 miles. Westwards the Great Barrier cliff terminates in
high-pressure ridges against Cape Crozier, the easternmost point
of Ross Island.</p>
<p>Ross Island with its towering volcanic cones rises like some
vast castle at the end of this huge white wall. It is formed of
four large volcanic cones, Mounts Terror, Terra Nova, Erebus and
Bird. The three first volcanoes appear to be situated on an east
and west line of fracture. Another fracture line probably passes
in a southerly direction from Mount Bird through Mount Erebus.
Thus, Erebus may be said to be at the junction of two important
systems of earth fracture. Still further south several smaller
craters are situated on what may be termed the Erebus Fracture
Zone, including that of Crater Hill, near Hut Point, the winter
quarters of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition. Still further south
are the volcanic islands. White Island and Black Island, and
somewhat to the south-south-west Mount Discovery with the long
volcanic promontory trending from it to the east-south-east,
known as Minna Bluff.</p>
<p>In the gaps between these islands and promontories the mass of
the Great Barrier moves slowly, but surely, seawards towards the
narrow south-westerly prolongation of Ross Sea known as McMurdo
Sound. Pressure ridges of ice in this part of the Great Barrier,
as well as actual measurements taken, prove that this part of the
Barrier is moving seawards, both to the west and to the east of
Ross Island.</p>

<p>McMurdo Sound is bounded on the south by the low terminal
cliff of the Great Barrier only a few feet in height. This low
ice cliff extends westwards across McMurdo Sound, for a distance
of about thirty miles, to the magnificent coast range of Victoria
Land. Majestic peaks of gneiss, granite, sandstone and limestone
capped by eruptive rocks rise almost sheer from the coast to
altitudes of from 8000 up to 12,000 ft. Throughout its entire
length from Cape North and the mountains recently discovered by
our expedition further west, down to the parallel of 86° South, a
distance of about 1100 miles, the ranges form a slightly elevated
border to an inland plateau. The continuity of these plateau
ranges is interrupted at intervals by wide valley-like
depressions, occupied by vast glaciers. These glaciers slope
steeply to the sea, or to the surface of the Great Barrier, and
are heavily crevassed. Further inland they ascend by gentle
slopes, interrupted occasionally by ice-falls, to the névé fields
of the plateau.</p>
<p>As one traces the coast-line northwards, from opposite Ross
Island in the direction in which the Northern Party travelled to
the South Magnetic Pole, one encounters some very remarkable
features which materially modify the form of the coast-line. The
first of these is called on the chart of the Antarctic Ocean,
prepared from observations under the direction of Captain R. F.
Scott, the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier Tongue. It is about six miles
in width, and projects twenty miles or more seawards from the
coast-line. There is reason to suppose that this Barrier, as well
as the one just to be described, is floating at its seaward
extremity.</p>
<p>North of the Nordenskjold Barrier is the Drygalski Barrier or
Ice Tongue. This is a huge glacier actively moving forwards into
the sea. It is a true glacier at its landward end, with immense
séracs, ridges and crevasses. The portion which projects seawards
beyond the coast is about twenty miles in width, and thirty miles
in length. Towards its seaward end, and also on its northern
side, where it receives the bulk of the snow drifted by southerly
blizzards, it partakes rather of a flat-topped barrier type than
of the glacier type with its characteristic rugged surface.</p>
<p>Just inland to the north of the Drygalski Ice Barrier Tongue
is a fine bay, Terra Nova Bay, inland from which, near its
northern end, rises the majestic Mount Nansen. This is a
flat-topped mountain, obviously capped by sedimentary rocks, and
as a matter of fact, it has shed lumps of limestone and sandstone
into the moraines beneath it.</p>
<p>Still further north the beautifully symmetrical volcanic cone
of Mount Melbourne attains a height of 8337 ft. The volcanic
rocks with which it is associated trend sharply to the
south-west, terminating in the high rugged cliffs of Cape
Washington.</p>
<p>To the north-east of Mount Melbourne is the deep indentation
known as Wood Bay, and thence the coast bends abruptly to the
east. It would seem indeed as though Mount Melbourne is probably
situated on some east and west line of earth fractures, like
Mounts Terror and Terra Nova. The coast-line then trends nearly
north again, forming the west boundary of Lady Newnes Bay. Then
it trends once more east to Cape Jones, an extinct volcano. Just
off Cape Jones lies the large volcanic island, Coulman Island.
From here the coast again trends chiefly northerly to Cape Adare.
Volcanic rocks are extensively developed at this cape, but the
ranges inland are formed of older rocks, such as granite, gneiss,
schist, slate, &amp;c., apparently still capped by the "Beacon
sandstone" formation. The island known as Possession
Island&mdash;also volcanic&mdash;lies to the south-south-east of
Cape Adare. This long cape, where the Southern Cross expedition,
under Borchgrevink, wintered, forms the north-east side of
Robertson's Bay. From this bay the coast trends at first
north-westwards for about 120 miles to Cape North. Near here,
some hills, a little distance back from the coast, give one a
strong impression of their being of volcanic origin, though it is
possible that they are merely out-lying sugar-loaf hills, relics
of a dissected plateau.</p>
<p>It was clear from the sight which we obtained of the part of
the coast, beyond Cape North on March 8, 1909, that the hills
were high, having an altitude of from 6000 to 7000 ft., as
measured by sextant, and that they formed the abrupt termination
seawards of a deeply denuded high plateau. This plateau is
undoubtedly a northern prolongation of the one travelled over by
the Northern Party of our expedition on their journey to the
South Magnetic Pole. It is also certainly continuous with the
plateau traversed by Captain R. F. Scott in his western journey,
in 1903, and it is proved now that it is part of the same plateau
to which Lieutenant Shackleton led the Southern Party, and over
which they travelled to an altitude of 10,000 ft. when they
reached their furthest point 88° 23' South.</p>
<p>Throughout the whole of this magnificent coastal range the
evidence of past ice action is extremely clear. Most of the
valleys are wide, but a few, like the Ferrar Glacier Valley, are
narrow. But whether wide or narrow, their rocky sides show most
impressively the abrasive work of the great ice plough, indeed
the rocky slopes bounding these glaciers are almost as even as
the banks of a deep railway cutting. One is at once struck with
the entire absence of those re-entering spurs and angles so
characteristic of river-worn valleys.</p>
<p>A curious feature, already mentioned by Ferrar, is the
development of an extensive coastal shelf, for at any rate about
150 miles northwards of the latitude of Cape Royds. This coastal
shelf may be possibly ascribed to step faulting, but it is also
possible that it may be due to an over-riding of the foothills of
the coast range, and a ploughing of them out by the former great
ice sheet of the Ice Barrier, at a time when its surface was
fully 1000 ft. higher than it is at present, and when it spread
northwards into the Ross Sea, probably at least 100 to 200 miles
north of its present seaward termination.</p>
<p>As regards the reason for the plateau of Victoria Land
terminating in such steep mountain slopes eastwards, it is of
course possible, as Ferrar suggests, that this is due to a heavy
fault or series of faults running parallel to the shore-line.
Certainly the scenery, particularly in the neighbourhood of Mount
Nansen, and between that and Mount Melbourne, suggests a
comparatively recent change of base, down to which the base level
forces have recently been working. In fact, these glacier-cut
valleys appear to us to be distinctly young in their origin. The
soundings in Ross Sea off this coast have some interest as
bearing on this question, as also the presence of raised beaches
in several places along the coast, and on Ross Island. McMurdo
Sound, from Ross Island to the coast of Victoria Land, is only
thirty miles wide, and yet the sea is nearly 500 fathoms in depth
within a few miles of the coast. As evidence of crust movements
raised beaches may be quoted. On Ross Island they were traced by
us up to altitudes of 160 ft., and organisms were found in these
beaches such as are found now living in the coastal waters, so
that they probably indicate an uplift since the deposition of
these organisms of a good deal more than 160 ft. At the Ferrar
Glacier on the mainland, raised beaches extended up to at least
50 ft. above sea-level, and they reached apparently to an
altitude of 20 to 30 ft. on the coast south-east of Mount Larsen,
200 miles further north. It is possible that the latter may be
due to upthrust of the marine sediments by glacier ice. These
changes in the level of the shore-line have taken place in quite
recent geological time. It is, of course, possible that such
changes might occur without being due to geological faulting.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D01. SECTION SHOWING FORMER THICKNESS OF
WEST<br>
BRANCH OF GREAT ICE BARRIER WHEN IT FILLED McMURDO<br>
SOUND AT MAXIMUM OF RECENT GLACIATION</small></p>
<p>The sectional drawing shows the state of Ross Sea, and of
McMurdo Sound during the maximum recent glaciation. It indicates
that the ice attained a maximum thickness formerly of nearly 4000
ft. in parts of McMurdo Sound from which it has now entirely
retreated. Since the voyage of Ross, in 1841, the front of the
Great Ice Barrier has retreated southwards in McMurdo Sound to
the extent of about thirty-five miles, as determined by Captain
Scott. Signs of waning glaciation are conspicuous all the way
from Mount Nansen to the furthest south mountains examined by the
Southern Party of this expedition in latitude 85° 15' South. For
example, the summit of Mount Hope, discovered by the Southern
Party in latitude 83° 33' South, was strewn with erratics, at an
altitude of fully 2000 ft. above the general level of the
adjacent surface of the glacier ice.</p>
<p align="center">GLACIOLOGY<br></p>
<p>The glacial phenomena of the region examined by us are due to
the action either (a) of Water substance in the form of (1)sea
ice, and ice-foot or shore ice; (2)glacier ice; (3)barrier snow
and ice-fields; (4)inland ice and névé fields; (5)icebergs;
(6)pack-ice; (7)thaw water forming surface lakes, and surface,
englacial or subglacial streams; or (b) to the action of wind; or
(c) to that of seasonal or diurnal changes of temperature.</p>
<p align="center"><small>(a) ACTION OF WATER
SUBSTANCE</small><br></p>
<p>(1) <small>SEA ICE</small>.&mdash;We made a series of
observations, by cutting holes from time to time through the sea
ice, to ascertain its maximum thickness throughout the area, and
also its methods of freezing. The maximum thickness measured by
us amounted to about 7 ft., in the case of ice formed, in a
sheltered position at Backdoor Bay near our winter quarters,
between the middle of March and middle of September 1908. Ice had
formed over the same area, a little earlier in March, to the
depth of a few inches, but this was cracked up, and drifted away
by the blizzards. This thickness of 7 ft. of ice was no doubt
increased between the middle of September and early in
December.</p>
<p>Ferrar states that the maximum thickness of sea ice which
formed during the year 1903 at Hut Point, McMurdo Sound, was 8
ft. 5¾ in. We observed that in places the sea ice was fractured,
through pressure of wind and tidal currents, and the broken slabs
were forced over one another forming pressure ridges, from 10 to
20 ft. in height.</p>
<p>It was interesting to note the effect on the sea ice of a
sudden fall of temperature. The contraction following on such a
fall would put the sea ice, especially at its surface, into a
high state of tension, and from time to time the surface would
crack open with a loud report. These contraction cracks gaped to
a width of 3 to 6 ft., and the sea water between the walls of the
crack, of course, began to freeze over. Frequently after ice had
formed to the thickness of a few inches a rise of temperature
would expand the ice. This expansion would tend to expend itself
on all weak spots, especially on the planks of thin ice formed
between the walls of the contraction cracks. These would be
buckled into small overfolds, until at last they became cracked
through excess of thrusting, and overthrust faults resulted. In
many of these cracks this process was frequently repeated.</p>
<p>Another feature worth noting in the sea ice is, that owing to
the great difference between the temperature of the sea water
below the ice and that of the air above it, as soon as a
contraction crack opened, the sea water appeared to be steaming.
A wall of thick vapour would rise along the whole length of each
crack. To this the term of frost-smoke is sometimes applied. The
water vapour, as it rose, was being constantly condensed and
deposited on the walls of the narrow cracks, so that gradually
the interspace became filled with ice, and not infrequently a
ridge of soft ice would be built up along the line of the old
crack, to a height of 6 in. or so above the general level of the
surrounding ice. As the ice was often traversed by a perfect
network of these cracks, the resulting ridges gave the
ice-surface the appearance of Indian paddy-fields, with their
dividing "bunds", or mud walls.</p>
<p>The sea ice was usually separated from the shore-ice, or
ice-foot, by one or more well-marked tide-cracks. In McMurdo
Sound, near our winter quarters, the tidal range of from 2 ft. to
3 ft. was quite sufficient to fracture the ice in contact with
the land. The seals took advantage of these tide-cracks, and used
them as blow-holes.</p>
<p>The chief geological work done by the sea ice, as far as we
could ascertain, was the transport seawards of windblown rock
detritus lodged on the shore-ice and ice-foot, in the manner
about to be described.</p>
<p><small>ICE-FOOT OR SHORE-ICE</small>.&mdash;On first arriving
on the shores of the Antarctic after the breaking up of sea ice,
towards the end of the summer, one is puzzled to account for the
low cliff, part snow, part ice, which almost everywhere fringes
the coast and so makes landing from a boat difficult. This fringe
is seen to be made up partly of ice at its base, resembling
somewhat the stalagmites of limestone caves, partly of layers of
compressed snow, in some cases alternating with bands of sand and
gravel. The ice-foot generally rises to a height of 6 to 10 ft.
above sea-level. It is usually in the form of a flat narrow
terrace from 20 to 100 ft, wide, sometimes in that of a sheer
cliff, occasionally as much as 80 ft. to over 100 ft. in height,
the summit of which ascends inland in a more or less steep snow
slope. At its base, in summer, the ice-foot is almost invariably
undercut by the sea, and from the overhanging roof thus produced
there depend vast numbers of beautiful icicles. These icicles
have, of course, been formed from the wash of the waves, and the
sea water in the process of being frozen has extruded its brine,
the salinity of which is such that the solution cannot freeze at
a temperature above zero Fahr. These icicles are generally moist,
and the moisture, in the form of concentrated brine, works
downwards, under the influence of gravity, to the tips of the
icicles, which thus become sticky. Hence when a blizzard springs
up and drives snowflakes against them, the flakes stick on
chiefly at the tips and gradually build out those foot-like
structures which we have termed foot-stalactites, and which are
illustrated.</p>
<p>During the winter of 1908 and the succeeding spring and
summer, we were able to see clearly the mode of growth of the
ice-foot. After the sea surface had been frozen over snow carried
by the wind from the land, or from the surface of the Great Ice
Barrier formed drifts of greater or less thickness over the sea
ice close inshore. These, at their shoreward end where the cliffs
are 80 or 100 ft. in height, may form drifts of equal thickness
with the height of the cliff. These drifts, of course, thin out
seawards. They are stratified and contain numerous dark bands
formed of chips of rock, broken crystals of felspar, &amp;c.
When, during the summer, strong blizzards disrupt the sea ice,
large rafts of ice are dislodged from near the shore, and these
carry away on their surfaces portions of the old snow-drifts. As
the work of destruction proceeds even the thick landward portions
of the snow-drifts are cracked off in large slices, and float
seawards, and thus in summer time is formed that almost universal
low cliff known as the ice-foot. During heavy weather when the
sea is open the waves wash over the lower portions of the
ice-foot, with the result that it is being constantly bathed in
salt water, which freezes in successive layers on its surface.
Thus, when the temperature is low the old masses of snow-drift,
of which the upper part of the ice-foot is formed, become cased
over with ice much in the same way as snow bergs become encased
as the result of their being splashed by sea spray.</p>
<p>(2) <small>GLACIER ICE AND NÉVÉ</small>.&mdash;The glacier ice
of the portion of the Antarctic area examined by us either
terminates inland in glaciers, some of which are hanging
glaciers, and some piedmont glaciers, or ice-slabs, or it comes
down to the sea where it is broken off from time to time to form
true icebergs, close to the shore-line; or&mdash;and this is a
feature emphasised already by Mr. H. T. Ferrar&mdash;the ice may
advance for a considerable distance from the shore-line into the
sea. in some cases from 20 to 30 miles, probably far more in the
case of the Great Ice Barrier, and thus discharge icebergs from
its sides as well as its snout. Such glaciers were described by
Ferrar as piedmonts-afloat, and we propose to retain this term
for them.</p>

<p align="center"><small>109. TWO ERRATIC BOULDERS OF GRANITE ON
THE SLOPES OF EREBUS</small></p>
<p><small>GLACIERS</small>.&mdash;A good example of this type was
to be seen a little over two miles southerly from our winter
quarters, just south of Cape Barne. The glacier there, called by
us the Cape Barne Glacier, terminates seawards in a cliff about
100 ft. in height, and some three miles in length. It has its
source in the névé fields of the western slope of Mount Erebus.
These are fed, not only by new falling snow, but also by large
quantities of drift snow swept over by the south-east blizzards
on to this, the lee side, of Erebus. The glacier was considerably
crevassed at its seaward extremity, and passed up gradually, at a
distance of some four or five miles inland, into the névé field.
This glacier was not moving actively, as we never observed any
trace of buckling or crushing of the sea ice, where it abutted
against the foot of the glacier cliff. Had there been any
appreciable forward movement it could not have failed to ridge up
or crush the opposing sheets of continuous sea ice. At the same
time the crevassed state of this glacier ice proved that movement
was still in progress.</p>
<p>A glacier of a Greenland type, also on a large scale, is the
Mount Nansen Glacier, occupying the wide depression between
Mounts Nansen and Larsen. This great glacier is from 12 to 20
miles in width, and 60 to 70 miles in length. It is very heavily
crevassed, and its surface is extremely irregular towards its
seaward end. Where the surface falls steeply, it has raised
immense pressure ridges in the sea ice along the shore, and
bristles with hummocks and séracs. So difficult was this surface
for sledging that we were forced to abandon it, after attempting
to take our sledge by way of this glacier on to the Magnetic Pole
plateau.</p>
<p>On striking the upper end of this glacier, some 60 miles
inland, we found that there was still a little ice present here
and there underneath the wide névé field. This névé field spread
out into a wide plain, and for a considerable distance before
reaching the Magnetic Pole, the latter being over 220 miles
inland at right angles to the coast-line&mdash;our horizon on all
sides was bounded by these same vast névé fields. It is obvious
that the Mount Nansen Glacier is moving steadily seawards, as
shown by the great pressure ridges which it has raised in the sea
ice opposing its advance. It must, therefore, still form an
outlet for the névé-formed ice of the inland plateau.</p>
<p>The interesting question here suggests itself, Is there
sufficient snowfall annually, on the area of the névé fields
drained by this glacier, to compensate for the ice which is lost
by ablation, or by being discharged as icebergs into the sea?
Until more data are available no accurate quantitative answer can
be given to this question. At the same time it may be remarked
that there is a tolerably heavy snowfall along this part of the
coast, and for a distance of at least 50 miles inland. Portions
of the high plateau, at a greater distance inland from the shore
than 50 miles at present probably receive only a very small snow
supply. It may be doubted whether the surface of this névé field
far inland is not on the whole being reduced in level through the
snow being drifted off it by the wind, or removed by the slow
process of ablation.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note that in front of the termination of
the Mount Nansen Glacier there is an immense old moraine of the
nature apparently of a medial moraine. We could trace this for
fully 23 miles in advance of the present glacier snout. It
follows that in comparatively recent geological time the Mount
Nansen Glacier has retreated by at least the amount quoted
above.</p>
<p><small>PIEDMONT GLACIERS ON LAND</small>.&mdash;A curious
feature observed along the greater part of the coast-line of
Victoria Land, from near Mount Discovery up to the Drygalski Ice
Barrier Tongue, is the development, on the great coastal shelf,
at an altitude of about 1000 ft. above sea-level, of a massive
covering of blue glacier ice. This, in some cases, reaches the
sea and breaks off to form bergs. In other cases the sheets do
not reach the sea, and, therefore, are probably on the wane. For
the latter Ferrar suggests the appropriate name of ice-slabs.</p>
<p>Several theories might be advanced to account for them. They
may represent actual relics of the old Barrier ice sheet, which
once filled McMurdo Sound and Ross Sea for probably fully 100
miles north of Ross Island. Another view is that they may be
local developments of ice resulting from a coalescing of a number
of small névé fields developed in the cirques among the foothills
of the plateau ranges. These foot-hills are frequently as much as
10 to 20 miles back from the edge of the coastline.</p>
<p><small>PIEDMONT GLACIERS AFLOAT</small>.&mdash;Three
well-marked examples of this type of glacier came under our
notice. The first was Glacier Tongue, between our winter quarters
and the old winter quarters of the <i>Discovery</i> at Hut Point.
Glacier Tongue, as shown on the Admiralty Charts and the Reports
of the <i>Discovery</i> expedition, is an elongated mass of ice
stretching from the shore-line into the sea for a distance of
about five miles. It has a width of about half a mile near its
seaward end, and about a mile where it rests against the land.
Both on its north and south side the Tongue is deeply indented
with a number of bays. Its height above sea-level varies from
about 40 ft. up to nearly 100 ft. While the <i>Nimrod</i> was
lying alongside this remarkable piedmont in February 1908,
Captain England took soundings at about a mile east of its
seaward end, and got a depth of 157 fathoms. As the maximum
height of the glacier above sea-level does not here exceed about
40 ft., and the sea is 940 ft. deep, if the ice were aground it
would have only one twenty-third of its volume above water, which
of course is physically impossible. We must, therefore, conclude
that this part of Glacier Tongue is afloat. At the same time it
should be mentioned that alongside of this glacier there are
traces of cracks, which some observers have considered to be
tide-cracks. There may be true tide-cracks near the shoreward end
of the glacier, but we were not satisfied that the cracks noticed
near its seaward end were really of the nature of tide-cracks.
While waiting for the arrival of the Southern Party, the
<i>Nimrod</i> lay in a snug natural dock, formed by one of the
bays on the north side of this glacier tongue, at about a mile
from its seaward end. We carefully watched for any evidence of
rise and fall of the tide in relation to the shore-line of the
glacier, but were unable to observe any. We concluded from this
circumstance that the glacier must be rising and falling in
unison with the tide. The sounding-tube of our Lucas
sounding-machine brought up a quantity of serpulæ and sponge
spicules from the sea bottom beneath the edge of the glacier
where our ship was moored.</p>
<p>The second piedmont-afloat is the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier
Tongue. This Ice Barrier Tongue is about 20 miles in length, and
5 to G miles in width. Its southern edge is formed of ice and
polished névé. Fierce blizzards have swept any loose snow off
this southern edge of the Barrier. The northern edge was formed
largely of snow, being chiefly of the nature of snow-drift, from
40 to 50 ft. in thickness. The latter terminates in a vertical
cliff with overhanging snow cornices. Obviously this cliff was
the combined result of the blizzard winds driving snow northwards
to the lee side of this piedmont-afloat, and to the breaking away
in summer time of the sea ice supporting the northernmost
portions of this snow-drift. Slices are thus removed from time to
time from the northern edges of the drifts, and so the cliff of
the portion left behind becomes higher in proportion as the
thicker ends of the wedges of snow-drift become broken away.
Certainly no true tide-crack was visible on the south side of
this Barrier, and only a small crack was seen on its north side.
Strange to say, this big mass of ice and consolidated snow, which
rises at its centre a little over 100 ft. above sea-level, does
not appear to communicate directly with a névé field at its
inland end. Apparently then the Nordenskjold Ice Barrier is not
now being directly fed from the inland névé fields. It appears to
represent an old piedmont-afloat, which is in the act of
dwindling away from want of supplies of ice from the
interior.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Drygalski Ice Barrier Tongue is also of the
nature of a piedmont-afloat. It is probably floating for at least
three-quarters of the distance of 30 miles to which it projects
from the shore into the sea. The surface of this glacier, where
it leaves the shore-line, is extremely rough and rugged, being
traversed, as stated in the narrative, by an immense number of
chasms, pressure ridges and crevasses. On the south side, where
the ice was still unbroken when we reached the glacier on
November 30, 1908, the old sea ice was forced up into strong
pressure ridges. The whole appearance suggested to us that this
glacier is moving actively from inland seawards. We could see
with our field-glasses that at a distance of about 50 miles
inland it descended by steep ice-falls from a high plateau
beyond. At the point where we crossed it, the glacier rose to an
altitude at its centre of about 200 ft. above sea-level. It was
here 12 miles in width. Further eastwards and therefore seawards,
the glacier ice was more and more levelled up with snow, until
eventually it passed into a true barrier type with a
comparatively smooth surface.</p>
<p>Captain Evans, after he brought the <i>Nimrod</i> into "Relief
Inlet", where he picked up the Northern Party just returned from
the Magnetic Pole, sounded alongside of the Drygalski Glacier and
found a depth of 655 to 668 fathoms, at a distance of only about
18 miles from the rocky shore-line.</p>
<p>As the Barrier here rises to a height not exceeding 50 ft.
above sea-level it must surely be afloat.</p>
<p>During the few weeks of thaw, in December and January,
torrents of water must rush off from this glacier in the form of
englacial or subglacial streams. These in some cases cut deep
open valleys with more or less precipitous sides; in other cases
they tunnel channels for themselves under the covering of hard
snow and ice, and the roofs of these tunnels collapsing through
want of support produce rugged ravines, very difficult to cross
with sledges.</p>
<p>This Drygalski Ice Barrier, on its northern side, contained in
places a considerable amount of moraine material. It was evident
that at the time when the glaciation of this region was at its
maximum it must have been continuous with the Mount Nansen
glacier. These two glaciers, when united, doubtless formed a huge
piedmont-afloat.</p>
<p>(3) <small>BARRIER SNOW-AND ICE-FIELDS</small>.&mdash;The
structure of the Nordenskjold and Drygalski Barriers throws
considerable light on one of the most difficult problems of the
Antarctic&mdash;the origin of the Great Ice Barrier. To ascertain
the amount of annual snowfall on this Great Barrier is of very
great importance, but we found this a hard problem, chiefly on
account of the difficulty of distinguishing between true newly
fallen snow and old snow which has been drifted along by
blizzards. We tried, during our observations in Antarctica, to
eliminate the drift snow from the true snowfall, and our general
conclusion now is, that at Cape Royds the annual snowfall is
equal to about 9½ in. of rain. On the journey of the southern
depôt party under Joyce, when laying a depôt for the relief of
the returning Southern Party in January-1909, the fortunate
discovery was made of Captain Scott's old Depot A. The sharp eyes
of Day discerned, at a distance of several miles, the top of the
depôt bamboo pole with just a wisp of the old black flag still
attached to it. Knowing the importance, from a scientific point
of view of estimating the extent and direction of movement of
this depôt, in the six years four months and a half that had
elapsed since Captain Scott left it there, the party visited it
and Mackintosh took a series of angles and measurements, which
enabled him to determine that the depôt had moved bodily to the
east-north-east at the rate of a little over 500 yards a year for
the past six years and six months. The party also dug down
through the hard snow to a depth of 8 ft. 2 in. when they came
upon the original snow-surface on which the depôt was formed.
They were thus able to show that, during the above period,
October 1, 1902, to February 15, 1909, on the average about 13
in. per year of hard snow had accumulated. In order to determine
the density of this snow they melted down a considerable quantity
of it, and measured the volume of the thaw-water resulting. This
showed that the annual accumulation of snow on this part of the
Great Ice Barrier is equal to about 7½ in. of rain.</p>
<p>This depôt is in the latitude of Minna Bluff, about 78° 40'
South. Further north, as, for example, in the neighbourhood of
Mount Nansen, the snowfall appeared to be considerably heavier,
and it seemed to be heavier still nearer to the Antarctic Circle.
As 7½ in. of rain is equal to 7½ ft. of snow it is obvious that
the accumulation of snow, even as far south as between latitude
78° and 79° is not inconsiderable, but on account of its great
density this compressed snow, near Minna Bluff, formed a layer
annually 13½ in. thick, instead of 7½ ft. thick.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity it may be assumed that the rate of
accumulation over the Great Barrier generally is about 1 ft.
annually. Now it has been proved that the Great Barrier extends
inland for fully 300 miles in places. From the observations at
Minna Bluff, and the rate of movement of Captain Scott's Depot A,
as measured by Captain Scott and again by Joyce, it may be
inferred that the Great Barrier there is travelling seawards at
the rate of about one-third of a mile per year. From this it may
be argued that a snowfall on any part of the Barrier 300 miles
inland would take 900 years to reach the edge of the Great Ice
Barrier, where bergs are discharged into the sea. At this rate,
if 1 ft. of snow is added to the Barrier every year a layer of
snow, formed 300 miles inland, 900 years ago, if it reaches the
Great Barrier cliffs at the present day will be covered by a
thickness of 900 ft. of snow. Obviously this theory gives a vast
thickness of snow to form the seaward end of the Great Barrier.
Theoretically then as the result of the calculations from the
observations of the southern depôt party, it might be argued that
a considerable thickness of the berg material derived from the
Great Ice Barrier was formed of consolidated snow and névé rather
than of true glacier ice. Practical proof of this was afforded us
by another series of observations. At the end of the breaking up
of the sea ice in the summer of 1907-8, three bergs drifted into
McMurdo Sound, and grounded between our winter quarters and Cape
Barne. During the following winter the sea was frozen over around
these bergs, and we were able to go over to them and study them.
Fortunately they were much tunnelled by sea-worn caves. This
enabled us to see their internal structure. We found that all
around the edge, particularly along the line of the wave-worn
groove which surrounds all bergs, a good deal of ice was
developed. This ice resulted evidently from the freezing of sea
water as the waves washed and dashed against the foot of the berg
cliff. In heavy weather a large quantity of spray would be flung
high up against the cliff faces of the berg, and the spray
freezing would encrust the exterior of the berg with ice. There
was no evidence, however, of the existence of any solid ice
inside the berg, this portion of it being formed purely of
compressed snow.</p>
<p>From this fact we were led to speculate as to whether the
whole of the berg might not be formed of hard snow, its submerged
portion saturated, but only superficially, with sea water. That
this was actually the case was proved later by Captain F. P.
Evans. He saw in these bergs an excellent shelter for his ship
from the blizzards, and moored the <i>Nimrod</i> to one of the
larger bergs. While here he took soundings around the most
typical of these tabular bergs, and found that whereas its cliff
face rose to a height of 80 ft. above sea-level, the berg was
aground in only thirteen fathoms of water; that is, the berg was
submerged to a depth of 78 ft., so that practically half of it
was out of the water and half immersed. This direct observation
is obviously of great importance as bearing on the mode of origin
and structure of the so-called icebergs of the Antarctic. There
can, we think, now be little doubt that a great proportion, in
some cases the whole, of the material of typical Antarctic bergs
is formed of consolidated snow rather than ice. These
observations may now be considered in their bearing on the origin
of the Great Ice Barrier. Captain Scott has shown that the Great
Ice Barrier for the greater part of its length, probably for 400
miles at least along its edge, is afloat. Wherever we got near to
the cliff face of the Barrier, and we were at times very close to
it, we were unable to see anything of the nature of true glacier
ice, even in eases where the cliff rose to a height of over 150
ft. above sea-level. On the other hand, there was every
appearance of the Barrier being formed of numbers of superimposed
layers of snow. On the line of argument previously given it is
not improbable that a thickness of 900 ft. of snow, or
thereabouts, may accumulate on a large proportion of the Barrier
near its terminal cliff, so that obviously, a great part of the
thickness of the Great Ice Barrier is probably due to this
compressed snow.</p>
<p>The question still remains, as to what becomes of the glacier
ice which undoubtedly does feed the Barrier at many spots along
its western and southern boundaries. For example, the great
glacier, 50 miles wide, up which the Southern Party travelled
from the spot where they were compelled to diverge from the
Barrier, latitude 83° South, must be discharging vast quantities
of ice into the Barrier. This same glacier had raised pressure
ridges on the Barrier surface for 20 miles out from its junction
with the Barrier. It is clear, too, from the fact established
both by the <i>Discovery</i> expedition and our own, that the
Great Ice Barrier is moving seawards. The propelling force can be
no other than that of glacier ice. This glacier ice descending
from the inland plateau must also move seawards, but as it gets
nearer to the Great Barrier ice cliff it becomes weighted down
with a vast thickness of superincumbent snow, and it is quite
possible that under these conditions a great deal of it may be
thawed off from below by the sea water.</p>
<p>The question here suggests itself, does the water circulating
beneath the Great Ice Barrier ever have a temperature high enough
to thaw fresh water ice? It does, of course, thaw the sea ice
quite rapidly.</p>

<p align="center"><small>110. THE BARRIER EDGE BREAKING AWAY FOUR
MILES SOUTH OF HUT POINT</small></p>
<p>(4) <small>INLAND ICE AND NÉVÉ FIELDS</small>.&mdash;Reference
has already been made to this type of ice under the head of
"Glaciers", in the description of the Mount Nansen Glacier. The
great glacier discovered by the Southern Party between 83° 33'
South and 85° South, over 100 miles in length and 50 miles in
width descended about 6000 ft. in that distance from a vast
inland snow plateau. This plateau is identical with that
traversed by Captain Scott's party of the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition, on their western journey in 1903. It is identical
also with the plateau travelled by the Northern Party of our
expedition in their journey inland to the South Magnetic Pole, as
well as with the new land discovered by our expedition to the
west of Cape North. This vast plateau extending, it is
practically certain, for over 1200 miles from north to south, and
over 200 miles from east to west, 7000 ft. high at its northern
end, and at least 10,000 ft. at its southern, is formed
superficially of névé. Doubtless beneath the névé is glacier ice.
The névé is possibly of no very great thickness, for the
horizontally bedded or gently inclined plateau rocks of the
Beacon sandstone formation rise to heights of 8000 to 10,000 ft.
above sea-level along the eastern border of the plateau.</p>
<p>This structure of the plateau is illustrated on the diagram
(D02).</p>
<p>(5) Icebergs have already been described under the heading
"Barrier Snow-and Ice-fields".</p>
<p>(6) Pack-ice has also been referred to under the heading "Sea
Ice". It may be noted that in the Ross Sea the bulk of the
pack-ice, formed chiefly of fractured masses of sea ice, partly
of small snowbergs and icebergs, impelled by the south-easterly
winds drifts past Cape Adare to the part of the Antarctic Ocean
which hes between Cape North and the Balleny Islands. This region
appears to be permanently beset with very old pack-ice and
icebergs. As most of the blocks of sea ice have been twisted and
piled on one another, this pack may be described as "screwed
pack".</p>
<p>(7) <small>THAW-WATER FORMING SURFACE LAKES, AND SURFACE,
ENGLACIAI, OR SUBGLACIAL STREAMS</small>.&mdash;Some of the
streams formed by thaw-water have already been described under
the head of glaciers, in the case of the Drygalski Glacier. In
the latitude of this glacier in 75° South, the thaw set in about
December 10 and lasted to about the third week in January.</p>
<p align="center"><small>LAKES AND LAKE ICE</small>.&mdash;We
found it difficult during the short period of our stay in the
Antarctic to ascertain to what thickness this ice formed during a
single season. The difficulty arose from the fact that in the
summer of 1908-1909 the fresh water ice of these lakes did not
entirely thaw.</p>
<p>Some of the lakes were slightly saline, and some of these,
such as Green Lake and Coast Lake, thawed completely during the
summer and during the winter the ice froze over them from top to
bottom until, in the case of Green Lake, in August 1908, only a
very little saline water, a few inches in depth, remained
unfrozen, below a thickness of 5 ft. of ice. At the same time of
year the water of "Coast Lake", also somewhat saline, was frozen
solid, the lake being a little under 5 ft. deep.</p>
<p>In the case of the fresh-water lake, known as Clear Lake, it
was noticed that during the summer the ice thawed chiefly on the
south side of the lake, where it was in contact with the black
rock, and where that rock was specially warmed by the sun's rays.
The sun being highest when it is due north, has its greatest
heating effect on southern slopes. The ice towards the middle and
north side of the lake did not wholly thaw. The same remark is
true of the ice of the Blue Lake near our winter quarters.</p>
<p>In the case of the Blue Lake we found, as the result of the
shafts sunk, that in the south-west division of this lake the ice
was at least 15 ft. in thickness, while in the north-western
division Brocklehurst sunk a shaft to 21 ft., but in his case a
little water was found beneath the ice, whereas in the first case
the ice was solid down to the bed rock. We are of opinion that
this Blue Lake ice had not been thawed for probably at least
three seasons.</p>
<p>As many of these small lakes were enriched by steep banks of
hard rock, the ice, expanding as it formed, was forced to curve
itself upwards in order to make room for itself, as it could not
burst the sides of the rock basin. Thus its surface was
frequently convex upwards. In this process of upward bulging of
the ice towards the lake's centre each successive fresh layer of
ice as it froze beneath the older and overlying layers, would
buckle them and bend them. The latter would at last crack open,
and so in the final stage of freezing of a small shallow lake, by
the time that the whole of the water had frozen from top to
bottom, the basin would be occupied by a biconvex cracked lens of
ice, the cracks being widest at the top and tapering away to
nothing below.</p>
<p>A curious feature which we observed in the lake ice was the
presence of what we termed "snow tabloids". We found that in some
cases these were merely empty bubble-like spaces in the ice
filled with air. In other cases, however, where the bubbles were
larger, 3 to 6 in. in width, they were occupied by snow. In some
cases patches of thin rippled snow were inter-stratified in this
lake ice.</p>
<p>Most of this fresh-water lake ice exhibited at its surface a
very beautiful structure, which we termed coralloidal
structure.</p>
<p>The mode of origin of this curious structure will be discussed
in the Scientific Memoirs of this Expedition.</p>

of finely divided rock material, chiefly in the form of sand, are
constantly being blown on to the sea ice by the wind. For some
distance seawards from the shore such wind-blown material must
form an appreciable amount of the sediments now forming on the
sea floor. Ferrar has already commented on the great importance
of the wind in these regions as a destructive agent.</p>
<p>By accelerating evaporation of snow and ice, and by its
mechanical erosive force on the surfaces of snowfields, the
blizzards are important contributors to the present deglaciation
of Antarctica. The amount of snow annually blown out to sea must
be very great, inasmuch as during blizzards, often of several
days duration, the air is frequently so thick with fine particles
of snow that one cannot see more than a few yards in front of
one. We observed that sledge tracks and footprints on the snows
of the coastal areas, or of the inland plateau, were nearly
always, after the expiry of a few weeks, left in relief. This
suggests that, at present, in many parts of Antarctica the
general surface of the snow and ice is being continually lowered
by ablation and wind drift.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><small>(c) CHANGES OF
TEMPERATURE</small><br></p>
<p>During spring and autumn when sunrise and sunset replace the
perpetual sunlight of summer, and the perpetual darkness of
winter, the range of temperature between noon and midnight is
most marked. On March 10, 1908, when at an altitude of about 9000
ft., on Mount Erebus, and with the thermometer at about 10°
Fahr., we observed that snow in contact with black lumps of
kenyte lava exposed to the sun's rays thawed rapidly, so that we
were able to get water to drink by laying a lump of snow in
saucer-shaped hollows on the surface of this lava. At night these
same rocks became very cold. There was no question here of the
survival of any original volcanic heat in the lava, as there was
no thaw whatever of the snow where it touched the lava in spots
shaded from the sun's heat. This absorption of heat by black
rocks partly explains the survival of lichens high up on the
slopes of Erebus. It also has the effect of prolonging a
superficial local thaw from summer far into spring, on the one
hand, and autumn on the other. Such a great diurnal range of
temperature, combined with the effects of summer thaw followed by
the severe frosts of winter, exerts a powerful disrupting force
upon the rocks, and accounts for the extensive rubble banks and
sheets and patches of loose and broken felspar crystals, which
are spread over such a large area of country near Mount Erebus,
&amp;c. At our winter quarters at Cape Royds we at first mistook
these for beds of volcanic tuff.</p>
<p align="center"><small>VOLCANIC ROCKS</small><br></p>
<p><small>ROSS ISLAND.</small>&mdash;As the chief varieties of
volcanic rocks met with in Ross Island have already been
described by Messrs. Ferrar and Prior, a brief description of
these will suffice.</p>
<p>At Ross Island we particularly studied the relations to one
another of the three principal types of rock there developed,
viz., kenyte, trachyte and basalt. We are now in a position to
say that, on the whole, the trachytes appear to have been the
oldest rocks, the kenytes to be of intermediate age, and the
basalts the newest. The evidence for this is as follows:</p>
<p>On the western slopes of Mount Erebus, above our winter
quarters, specimens were not infrequently found of what at first
sight appeared to be fragments of sandstone enclosed in kenyte
lava. A closer inspection of these showed that they were in
reality varieties of trachyte. Similar specimens were met with in
the kenytes near Cape Barne. It would seem from this that the
oldest lavas in this area were trachytes, and that later kenyte
eruptions followed, which partly destroyed the trachytes, and
thus the disrupted trachyte fragments subsequently became
embedded in the kenyte lava. In the next place we found that at
Cape Barne the kenyte had been very powerfully intruded by the
basalt. Large fragments of kenyte were frequently found entangled
in the basalt of the comparatively recent volcanic cone at Cape
Barne, and on a line trending inland in a south-easterly
direction. In the case also of the long spur which extends from
Mount Erebus to the old winter quarters of the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition at Hut Point it is clear that the latest volcanic
products of that locality are scoriaceous basalts. These basalts
are obviously newer than the trachytes of Observation Hill; they
are even newer than the olivine basalts of Sulphur Hill in the
same area. In our ascent of Erebus we found that not only were
there old kenyte lavas developed on its flanks, but that at
intervals on the way up the rock was still kenyte, becoming of
newer and newer age until the modern active crater was reached.
This crater was partly filled with molten lava from June to
September 1908. It is evident from this that some of the kenyte
is amongst the newest of all the volcanic products of Ross
Island. The following table shows the probable chronological
relations of these lavas in descending order:</p>
<table summary="pxxx" align="center" width="100%">
<colgroup>
<col width="60%">

&nbsp;</td>
<td style="text-align:right; vertical-align:bottom;">
Trachyte.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><small>EAST COAST OF VICTORIA LAND</small>.&mdash;The
succession, therefore, on the whole has been from trachyte
through kenyte to olivine-basalt. There can be no doubt that the
whole of the trachytic eruptions, the pre-basaltic kenyte, and
the olivine basalts antedate the epoch of greatest recent
glaciation.</p>
<p>The occurrence of large blocks of kenyte at Gneiss Point, a
few miles to the east-south-east of Granite Harbour, suggests the
possibility that some of the dark sheets of rock near the highest
portions of the plateau may perhaps be formed in part of kenyte.
At the same time it is possible that these kenyte boulders of
Gneiss Point have been drifted northwards from Ross Island
amongst the moraine material of the western branch of the former
gigantic Great Ice Barrier, when it occupied the whole of McMurdo
Sound. Dykes of dark rocks, resembling tinguaites, were not
uncommon from Granite Harbour northwards to near Geikie Inlet,
south of the Drygalski Glacier. We also observed dyke rocks full
of small black bright prismatic crystals of hornblende. These
appear to be of the nature of hornblende lamprophyres. Small
pieces of scoriaceous volcanic rocks were found by us as far
north as Cape Irizar. These fragments may have come from the
mountains of the western plateau.</p>
<p align="center"><small>FOUNDATION ROCKS</small><br></p>
<p>The oldest rocks seen by us in the Antarctic belong to the
series already described by Ferrar and Prior, and consist of
banded gneiss, gneissic granite granodiorite and diorite rich in
sphene. In some spots, as at Cape Bernacchi, masses of very
coarse white crystalline marble are interspersed in the
gneiss.</p>
<p>These foundation rocks have their planes of foliation sharply
folded in places, as is the case at Depôt Island, the axis of
folding there being approximately parallel to the trend of the
coast-line. Near the same spot huge enclosures can be seen in the
gnessic-granite. These are partly greenish grey quartzites in
masses ten to twenty feet in diameter, partly large lumps of
blackish green coarsely crystalline hornblende rock, with much
sphene and a white mineral, apparently either saussuritised
felspar, or scapolite. In other places, as at Cape Bernacchi,
black tourmaline schists with epidote were frequently
interspersed through the gneiss, and the gneiss was also
traversed by veins of white aplite, with small crystals of
garnet. The coarsely crystalline belt of marble in the gneiss at
Cape Bernacchi contained abundant graphite in the form of small
flakes. It appears to us that the marble and the quartzite
represent an old sedimentary formation, and the large enclosures
of hornblende-and-sphene rock an old amphibolite or gabbro, both
the former and the latter types of rock disrupted by the
intrusive gneissic granites.</p>
<p>Ferrar was of opinion that in the neighbourhood of the hill
marked (<i>d</i>) on his map showing the valley of the Ferrar
Glacier, the grey granite of these hills is older than the
dolerite which rests upon its even upper surface, but that the
pink granite of (<i>d</i>) is intrusive and later than the
dolerite.* This is an important observation. We did not see this
spot, but in other areas, as near Granite Harbour, the dolerite
appeared to be newer than the granites.</p>

<p align="center"><small>OLDER (?)PALÆOZOIC SEDIMENTARY
ROCKS</small><br></p>
<p>Apart from the large enclosures of quartzites, &amp;c., in
gneissic granite, already referred to, the next oldest
sedimentary rocks appear to be greenish grey slates brought back
by the Southern Party from the surface of the great glacier up
which they were travelling between Mount Hope and "The
Cloudmaker", in approximately latitude 84° South. These
fragments, as Lieutenant Shackleton informs us, were blown on to
the surface of the ice from what appeared to be mountains of
slate further west. The approximate relative position of these
slate hills and of the granite hill of Mount Hope, and the
nunatak of coal-bearing Beacon sandstone further south is shown
in the photograph.</p>
<p>At Cape Royds we found occasionally, but sparingly, erratics
of radiolarian chert. The radiolaria appear to be of older
Palæozoic type, but we were unable to discover any rock like it
<i>in situ</i>. Obviously at Cape Royds the erratics have
travelled from some spot to the south and west. It is possible
that these black and grey cherts belong to the limestone series
discovered by the Southern Party in 85° 15' South. This limestone
varies in colour from pink to dark grey. The pink limestone is
banded with some dull green earthy mineral; it contains numerous
obscure casts resembling those of radiolaria. The dark bluish
grey portion of this limestone does not show any trace of
organisms. Apparently it has been too much metamorphosed to
retain the outlines of any of its original fossils. It is
traversed in all directions by veins of white calcite. The
limestones appear to be almost horizontally bedded, and are
several hundreds of feet in thickness. The Southern Party were
unable to determine the relation of this massive limestone to the
adjacent Beacon sandstone, as unfortunately there was a break in
the continuity of the section which prevented the junction of
these two formations being seen. This limestone, 7000 ft. above
sea-level, is higher geographically than the Beacon sandstone
formation, but as the latter dips away from it towards the
north-east, the limestone may be stratigraphically below the
Beacon sandstone. The Southern Party discovered large blocks of
limestone breccia in the moraines near "The Cloudmaker". The
fragments in the morainic breccias near this mountain are formed
of limestones, not unlike those of the great nunatak, but whether
these breccias belong to the basal beds of the Beacon sandstone
formation, or to the base of the massive limestones, or to crush
breccia zones in the massive limestones is not as yet apparent.
It is even possible that they may be stratigraphically above the
Beacon sandstone, but this is improbable. Fragments of old
limestones were observed by us in the ancient moraines of the
Mount Nansen Glacier. These were associated with pieces of
sandstone and fragments of grey clay shale with obscure
impressions of fossil roots. This limestone appears to have been
derived from the Beacon sandstone formation. It is very much
altered through recrystallisation, and we have been unable to
recognise in it any fossils.</p>
<p>It may be mentioned that when journeying to the South Magnetic
Pole at a spot about twenty miles south-east of Granite Harbour
we found on a small island, Terrace Island, a large fragment of
argillaceous limestone. This had evidently been derived from the
Beacon sandstone formation in the adjacent hills. When broken
open it was found to contain small oval bodies, pointed at one
end, and about one-third of an inch in length resembling seeds of
fossil plants, possibly coniferous seeds.</p>
<p>This specimen was subsequently left at "Depôt Island", and has
not since been recovered.</p>
<p>The Beacon sandstone formation has now been proved to extend
from at least as far as Mount Nansen in the north to latitude 85°
South, where it was explored <i>in situ</i> by the Southern
Party, a distance of fully seven hundred miles. As described by
Ferrar its thickness in the Ferrar Glacier Valley amounts to
fully two thousand feet, and even then the base of the formation
was not seen.</p>
<p>The following is a generalised section of the Beacon sandstone
formation in 85° South, in descending order, from information
supplied by Mr. Shackleton and F. Wild of the Southern party:</p>
<p>500 ft. sandstone.</p>
<p>300 ft. sandstone with bands of shale, and about seven seams
of coal, or seams formed of black shale alternating with laminæ
of bright coal. In this belt the following seams were seen <i>in
situ</i>:</p>
<p class="margin2">1 ft. to 1½ ft. coal seam.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strata.<br>
7 ft. coal seam with bands of grey shale.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strata.<br>
5 ft. coal seam apparently formed of clean coal.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strata.<br>
3 ft. (about) coal seam.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strata.<br>
3 ft. (about) coal seam.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strata.<br>
3 ft. (about) coal seam.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strata.<br>
3 ft. (about) coal seam.</p>
<p>Seven-hundred-foot sandstones with numerous water-worn quartz
pebbles in the lower beds. These pebbles are from one to two
inches in diameter. Total 1500 ft.</p>
<p>In the medial moraine, below the great nunatak in 85° South,
the Southern Party obtained, amongst several specimens of
sandstone with much mother-of-coal, or mineral charcoal, one
specimen of special interest. It was a fragment of fine grained
hard sandstone, evidently derived from the Beacon sandstone
formation higher up, showing a black band one-quarter of an inch
thick running through it. Micro-slides of this examined at the
University prove that it is a coniferous wood. The following
description of it has been written by Mr. E. J. Goddard, B.Sc.,
Macleay Research Fellow of the Linnæan Society, New South
Wales:</p>
<p align="center"><small>SPECIMENS FROM MEDIAL MORAINE, DECEMBER
11, 1908 (No. 101)</small><br></p>
<p>"Longitudinal sections of the included dark masses give a
homogeneous banded appearance of a distinctly organic nature. The
banded appearance is due to the vascular nature of the organic
elements composing the mass. The whole structure recalls to one's
mind the appearance given by longitudinal sections of the xylem
portion of the vascular area of a gymnosperm, such as
<i>Pinus</i>. Only the xylem area is represented in the specimen,
no traces of medullary, cortical, or phloem tissue being visible.
Medullary rays are present as shown in the micro-photograph.</p>
<p>"The xylem itself is composed of a homogeneous mass of
vessels, tracheidal in nature, no differentiation as regards the
vascular elements being present. In places one may readily make
out in longitudinal sections dark opaque bands of much greater
size individually than the tracheides. These in all probability
represent resin passages belonging to the xylem. It would seem,
further, that these masses might be considered as being nothing
more than an aggregation of material similar in nature to that of
the walls, and due to changes under the process of petrifaction.
This, however, is opposed by the fact that they occur even in
these small sections fairly commonly, and at the same time are
all of exactly the same size as regards width. At all events they
represent some definite structure, and in all probability resin
passages.</p>
<p>"The walls of the tracheids themselves seen under the high
power of the microscope appear to be pitted, but the preservation
is by no means good enough to warrant any remarks on this beyond
that in the common wall of adjacent tracheides occur clear spaces
of the same relative importance as the bordered pits of such a
gymnosperm as <i>Pinus</i>. These clear spaces occur regularly
along the length of the tracheides, and stand out strongly
against the dark colour of the walls in their preserved
condition.</p>
<p>"The nature of the xylem itself leads to the conclusion that
it is a portion of a gymnospermous plant, resembling strongly in
nature the same portion of a coniferous plant."</p>
<p>If the conclusion as to the coniferous character of the wood
is correct, and there seems little reason to doubt its
correctness, the lower limit of the age of the Beacon sandstone
is perhaps Lower Carboniferous or Upper Devonian, unless conifers
in the Antarctic had a deeper range in geological time than
elsewhere.</p>
<p>The plate shows the general appearance under the microscope of
this fossil wood. The medullary rays are fairly distinct.</p>
<p>This is the first determinable fossil plant that has been
obtained from the Victoria Land portion of the Antarctic.</p>
<p>Although a date not older than Carboniferous or Devonian is
suggested by the presence of this coniferous wood, it is of
course possible that the Beacon sandstone is of higher geological
antiquity, and if the radiolarian rocks, already referred to, are
conformable with the Beacon sandstone, it may even go far down
into the older Palæozoic.</p>
<p>The degree of induration of these unfolded plateau sandstones
and the general absence of fossils from the limestones is
suggestive of a high geological antiquity.</p>

<p align="center"><small>RAISED BEACHES</small><br></p>
<p>Raised beaches were observed at two distinct localities on the
western slopes of Ross Island, also near the mouth of the Ferrar
Glacier, as well as to the south-east of Mount Larsen.</p>
<p>The first locality on Ross Island was discovered by Armytage;
the second locality by one of us; the raised beaches near the
Ferrar Glacier also by one of us; while the Mount Larsen raised
beaches were observed by the Northern Party on their journey to
the South Magnetic Pole. These four localities may be referred to
as:</p>
<p class="margin2">(1) Back Door Bay deposit.<br>
(2) Cape Barne deposit.<br>
(3) Ferrar Glacier deposit.<br>
(4) Mount Larsen deposit.</p>
<p>Deposit (1) lies at a height of 160 ft. above sea-level. It
was found at the bottom of a shallow flat-bottomed gulley sloping
down eastwards into a small arm of McMurdo's Sound, called by us
Back Door Bay. The area of the deposit was only a few square
yards. It consisted of a brownish earthy material with abundant
remains of crushed tubes of serpulæ. Diatoms were fairly abundant
in it. We were at first in some doubt as to whether this serpula
deposit was a genuine raised beach, or merely a mass of sandy
material from the sea floor pushed up by the ploughing action of
the old McMurdo Sound ice sheet. There has, of course, been a
similar question raised in regard to the so-called raised beaches
of Moel Tryfaen in North Wales. The subsequent discovery by one
of us of an extensive raised beach at an altitude of about 180
ft. near Cape Barne (deposit 2) is confirmatory evidence as to
the genuine raised beach character of the first-mentioned
deposit. At this Cape Barne deposit the material is largely
formed of spicules of siliceous sponges and molluscan shells, as
well as the remains of serpulæ. The nature of the organisms there
present is such as to render it probable that the deposit was
formed in water of some depth. It may therefore indicate an
elevation of this part of the coast near Cape Barne, not merely
of 180 ft., but perhaps of double that amount.</p>
<p>Deposit (3) near the entrance of the Ferrar Glacier Valley.
These deposits chiefly consist of brownish sands with very
numerous shells of a large species of pectens. They were
discovered by one of us, and traced to altitudes of from 50 to 60
ft. Further north at Cape Bernacchi there are strongly marked
terraces suggestive of raised beaches, which were observed by the
Northern Party to extend up to altitudes of 100 ft. At Terrace
Island, about twenty miles to the north of Cape Bernacchi we
observed well-marked terraces, ranging up to about 80 to 85 ft.
above sea-level. These had every appearance of having been laid
down by the action of the sea, though no sea-shells were found
amongst the sands and coarse gravel constituting this
deposit.</p>
<p>Deposit (4) south-east of Mount Larsen. A very curious type of
what may be termed a raised beach or possibly an upthrust area,
was observed by us on our journey from the sea ice near the
Drygalski Glacier to the foot of the small branch glacier at what
we called Backstairs Passage. This moraine deposit consisted of
greenish grey muds underlying coarse moraines of granite blocks
and quartz and felspar porphyry. Beneath the grey muds was ice;
the ice was just very sightly saline in places. These muds
contained remains of serpulæ in great quantity, an enormous
number of shells of that well-known Arctic type amongst the
foraminifera, <i>Biloculina</i>, numerous representatives of
horny polyzoa, siliceous sponges, and a perfect form of solitary
coral allied to a perfect shell of lyothyrina, &amp;c.,
dentalium, chiton, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The height of this deposit above sea-level could not be
definitely ascertained by us. It was at least 20 ft., possibly as
much as 30 ft., above the sea.</p>
<p>The evidence generally of these raised beaches is very
interesting, as showing the probability that when the ice, in
recent geological time, had its maximum extension in this region,
there was probably a subsidence, possibly due to the load, on
this part of the earth's crust, of such a vast extra thickness of
ice, and that after the subsidence, which probably lagged behind
the epoch of maximum glaciation, there has been a gradual
re-emergence to the amount of 150 to 200 ft. The brachiopod and
polyzoon in the raised marine mud from the Larsen area have
kindly been identified for us by Mr. C. Hedley and Mr. E. F.
Hallman respectively, of the Australian Museum.</p>
<p align="center"><small>PEAT DEPOSITS</small><br></p>
<p>Amongst formations of recent origin may be mentioned peat. A
deposit of peat was discovered by one of us formed on the bottom
of the lake called Coast Lake.</p>
<p>This peat is formed from the remains of a large fungoid plant,
which grows in profusion in the water of these coastal lakes when
the ice thaws in midsummer.</p>
<p>A deposit of mirabilite was discovered by one of us at the
spot shown on the map near Cape Barne, after the summer thaw had
set in. The white colour of the salt during winter rendered it
indistinguishable from the surrounding snow, but after the thaw
the difference of course was noticeable between this white salt
and the edges of the dark volcanic rock.</p>
<p>Apparently this mirabilite forms one of the products of
evaporation of an old lake. Numbers of these dried lake basins
were noticed by us amongst the glacial moraines on these western
slopes of Erebus near Cape Barne and our winter quarters.</p>
<p>In regard to the important theoretical question as to whether
the west coast of Victoria Land is of an Atlantic or of a Pacific
type, the following considerations present themselves.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="dia03" id="dia03"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202761h-images/dia03.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>D03. FUNGUS&mdash;PEAT AND ICE
DEPOSITS</small></p>
<p>As pointed out by H. T. Ferrar, the massive Beacon sandstone
formation terminates in steep, and in places precipitous, slopes
along the whole line of coast from beyond Cape North southerly to
Mount Discovery. From there to where Mr. Shackleton and his
Southern Party, after ascending the granite and slate mountains
of this coastal range in latitude 83° 33', longitude 170° East,
reached 85° South at an altitude of 6000 ft. sedimentary rocks
were found to cap the ranges. They were disposed in gently
dipping or nearly horizontal strata, and extended south-easterly
to at least 86° South.</p>
<p>At the Great Nunatak in latitude 85° South, longitude 165°
East, the sandstone beds containing the seven seams of coal dip
in a north-easterly direction at an angle of about 6° to 8°.
There was no evidence there, nor as far northwards as our
explorations extended, that is, to Mount Nansen, of any folding
in the Beacon sandstone formation.</p>
<p>At Depôt Island, to the north of Granite Harbour, the ancient
gneiss platform is there folded parallel with the coast-line, but
this structure appeared to be the exception rather than the
rule.</p>
<p>The Beacon sandstone, for reasons already given, is perhaps as
old as Palæozoic, possibly older Palæozoic. So, if the above
conclusions are correct, there has been no appreciable folding in
the part of Victoria Land examined by us since Palæozoic
time.</p>
<p>The coastline is, therefore, in our opinion, of the Atlantic
rather than of the Pacific type, and probably owes its trend and
position to a powerful fault or zone of faults, with a down-throw
to the east. The volcanoes Mount Melbourne, Mount Erebus, Mount
Discovery, &amp;c., are probably on this fracture, or zone of
fractures. If this view as to the Atlantic type of this part of
the coast is correct, what has become of the great Andean folds
developed on the west side of Graham Land?</p>
<p>Possibly as Wilckens has suggested, west of Alexander I Land
the Cordillera is submerged through faulting.*</p>
<p class="foot">[* Centralblatt für Min. Geol. und Pal., 1906,
No. 6, p. 179.]</p>
<p>In this case the Ross Sea subsidence area (if such it be)
would have approximately the same relation to the Andean
trend-lines in the Antarctic that the Gulf of Mexico and the
Antillean and West Indian fracture zones bear to the trend-lines
of the tropical Andes. It must, nevertheless, be admitted that
the Great South Polar Shield of ancient and practically
incompressible crystalline rock, intensely folded in the past,
would be incapable of being further folded now, and if the Andean
zone of disturbance traversed this shield it would be likely to
traverse it as a zone of fractures with local lava effusions,
rather than as a fold range of the Pacific type. This important
matter will be discussed by us in detail in the Geological Memoir
of this Expedition.</p>
<p><small>SUMMARY</small>.&mdash;The following inferences are
tentatively suggested in regard to the geology of Antarctica:</p>
<p>(1) The majority of the tabular bergs of this region are
largely, in some cases wholly, snowbergs, not icebergs.</p>
<p>(2) True icebergs are also found.</p>
<p>(3) Glaciers in the Antarctic push out in some cases thirty
miles from the coast, and must be afloat, as argued by Ferrar,
for the greater part of this length.</p>
<p>(4) The Great Ice Barrier is formed of true glacier ice at its
sides and inland extremity, but the centre and seaward portion is
formed, in its upper part, chiefly of snow. We agree with Captain
Scott's conclusions that the Great Barrier except at its edges
and perhaps at some distance inland must be afloat. At its
eastern side it has been moving seawards at the average rate of
about five hundred yards a year for the past seven years.</p>
<p>(5) Throughout the whole of the region of Antarctica examined
by us, for 16° of latitude, there is evidence of a recent great
diminution in the glaciation. In McMurdo Sound this arm of the
sea now free from land ice was formerly filled by a branch of the
Great Ice Barrier, whose surface rose fully 1000 ft. above
sea-level, and the Barrier ice in this sound, in areas from which
the ice has retreated, was formerly about 4000 ft. in
thickness.</p>
<p>(6) The snowfall at Cape Royds from February 1908 to February
1909 was equal to about 9½ in. of rain.</p>
<p>(7) The névé-fields of Antarctica are probably of no great
thickness.</p>
<p>(8) The southern and western sides of the sector of Antarctica
south of Australia is a plateau from 7000 to 10,000 ft. high,
which may possibly extend across the South Pole to Coat's Land
and Graham Land.</p>
<p>(9) Ross Sea is probably a great subsidence area.</p>
<p>(10) The Beacon sandstone formation which extends for at least
1100 miles from north to south in Antarctica contains coniferous
wood associated with coal seams. It is probably of Palæozoic
age.</p>
<p>(11) Limestones, pisolitic in places, in 85° 15' South, and
7000 ft, above sea-level contain obscure casts of radiolaria.</p>
<p>Radiolaria, in a fair state of preservation, occur in black
cherts amongst the erratics at Cape Royds. They appear to belong
to the same formation as the limestone. These radiolaria appear
to be of older Palæozoic age.</p>
<p>(12) The succession of lavas at Erebus appears to have been
first trachytes, then kenytes, then olivine basalts. Erebus is,
however, still erupting kenyte.</p>
<p>(13) Peat deposits, formed of fungus, are now forming on the
bottoms of some of the Antarctic glacial lakes near 77° and 78°
South.</p>
<p>(14) Raised beaches of recent origin extend at Ross Island to
a height of at least 160 ft. above sea-level.</p>

<small>AND</small> RAYMOND PRIESTLEY</h4>
<p align="center"><small>VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS</small><br></p>
<p><b>WE</b> observed that the eruptions of Erebus, like those of
Stromboli, were most frequent during a low barometer. The
following is a description of the chief eruption of Erebus
witnessed by us on June 14, 1908:</p>
<p>This morning, about 8.45 a.m., as the small blizzard of the
preceding night was subsiding we noticed that Erebus was more
than usually active; the steam cloud over its summit was broader
and taller than usual; and there were frequent outbursts of
steam.</p>
<p>At 11.30 a.m. it was noticed that an eruption of altogether
unprecedented vigour, as far as our experience of Erebus went,
was in progress. Immense masses of steam rushed upwards to at
least 2000 ft. above the summit in about half a minute, and
spread out to form a vast mushroom-shaped cloud. This rapidly
became asymmetrical; while the main steam column was bent over to
the left (northerly) by the return air current from the Pole, the
higher ascending portion, at about 2500 to 3000 ft. was carried
by the upper current in a southerly, or more probably
south-easterly direction. At about 2.30 p.m. there was a
specially grand outburst of steam. It rushed upwards nearly
vertically, just a trifle bent to the north, and dashed its head
with great violence through the mushroom-shaped cloud or canopy,
emerged on the other side, and must have ascended there from 1000
to 2000 ft. higher; in all about 5000 ft. above the summit of the
mountain.</p>

<p align="center"><small>115. EREBUS ERUPTION OF JUNE 14, 1908,
SHOWING UPPER AIR CURRENTS</small></p>
<p>At 3.15 p.m. a bright glow was seen on Erebus by Messrs.
Priestley, Murray and Mackay. It illuminated the whole steam
column to the base of the mushroom. We observed that the top of
this column then spread out gradually, first into a club-headed
lump, then into a mushroom-like form.</p>
<p>At 3.25 p.m. a remarkably bright glow suddenly lit up all the
lower part of the steam column above the crater. This was seen by
Shackleton, Priestley and Day.</p>
<p>By 3.45 p.m. the steam cloud had spread out much more and had
besides risen higher, and the first formed portions of the cloud
trailed away in long streamers to the south with one extensive
branch going first north by east, then north-westerly.</p>
<p>At 3.50 p.m. there was another bright glow. As regards the
uprushes of steam the interval may not have been constant, but it
seemed to be about four to five minutes.</p>
<p>Towards 6 p.m. the bend over the steam column to the
north-north-west or north-west was more strongly marked, and the
asymmetry of the steam cloud was due to a preponderating amount
of steam gathering to the north-west side of Erebus. By this time
the older part of the steam cloud had formed a species of thin
cirrus cloud, about 20,000 ft. to 30,000 ft. above sea-level.</p>
<p>At 6.40 p.m. Shackleton observed a very bright glow on the
steam cloud.</p>
<p>By 8 p.m. the eruption appeared to be subsiding, and the steam
cloud meanwhile stretched across the sky, now in a direction from
east-south-east to west-north-west (the surface wind was at the
time about north-north-east), and appeared to be passing almost
over Sandy Beach and Horseshoe Bay. It was now delicately draped
in the form of sinuous thin folds like a thin muslin skirt.
Evidently the wind direction had changed at the summit level to
about east-south-east to west-north-west.</p>
<p>That night there was a full moon. The sky a lovely deep blue
near the zenith, paler towards the horizon. When the moon came
over the great steam cloud of Erebus (22½° of arc) the scene was
sublime. Its light was brightly reflected from the small glaciers
at the south-west foot of the cone of Erebus; all the rest of the
west and north-west slope was in deep shadow. In middle distance
below the base of the cone soft white mist swathed the mountain.
Near Backdoor Bay and Cape Royds brightly moonlit patches of snow
showed up the black and dark brown patches of rock; our hut and
stable in the middle of the foreground with the dazzling white
surface of our little lake with its winding bays and coves.</p>
<p>On June 17, at 8 p.m., we noticed remarkable white cloud-like
dense white cumulus to north-north-east over the ridge at the
back of our hut and towards Horseshoe Bay.</p>
<p>At 11 p.m. (about) Mawson came running down from Anemometer
ridge to say that an eruption had broken out from a new quarter.
We rushed out and witnessed a distinct eruption amongst the huge
masses of steam hanging in the air to the north-north-east. The
new mass of steam, of great volume, rolled up rapidly, starting
at perhaps 2000 ft. above sea-level, to probably at least 5000
ft. above the sea. A photograph was taken of it, and afterwards
more distinct steam eruptions were witnessed.</p>
<p>The eruption appeared to have its origin on the southerly and
south-south-west slope of Mount Bird, at perhaps about 2000 ft.
above the sea-level. The steam cloud appeared to ascend to a
height of about 5000 ft. above sea-level in an incredibly short
space of time. These fumaroles or intermittent geysers must be
among the most powerful known. They appear to be developed near
the meridional earth crack which extends from Mount Bird
southerly through Mount Erebus.</p>
<p>A description of the craters of Erebus has already been given
in the narrative of this work, and the fact is emphasized that
the interior of the old crater is largely filled with layers of
large felspar crystals and pumice, alternating with beds of snow.
Five of these felspar crystals are figured on the accompanying
plate.</p>

ERUPTIONS</h3>
<h4><small>BY</small> JAMES MURRAY</h4>
<p><b>WE</b> were not so fortunate as to witness an eruption of
any great moment. The activity of Mount Erebus showed in the form
of increased volume of the steam-cloud or "smoke-cloud" ejected
from the crater, and in a red glow or flare at the crater, often
visible at night. There were also steam eruptions from fumaroles
more or less distant, sometimes many miles distant from the
active crater.</p>
<p><small>THE SMOKE-CLOUD</small>.&mdash;We referred to the cloud
of steam which issued from the crater as the "smoke-cloud", to
leave no chance of confounding it with the great laminated cloud
which commonly hung over the mountain. The variations in the
volume of the smoke-cloud were associated with high and low
barometer. Occasionally, for a few days, no smoke was visible,
and this was usually at times of high pressure. Even then we
could not be sure that there was no smoke issuing, as there is a
gap in the crater not visible from our camp. Great activity in
the ejection of steam occurred with the glass as high as 29.5
(very high for this region), and as low as 28.3 (pretty nearly
our minimum).</p>

<p align="center"><small>D05. ERUPTION OF NOVEMBER 27,

<p>A large volume of cloud was often thrown up with great force,
to a height of several thousand feet, sometimes as much as 5000
or 6000 ft., where it spread out and formed a "mushroom".
Commonly in these eruptions two columns could be distinguished
issuing from the crater, one white (steam), the other brown. When
the two columns were soon caught by the wind, the white one went
higher, and the dark one remained lower. Several times there were
three columns in the crater, and on April 11 there were two in
the crater, and one outside, well to the right. This last might
be of steam which had rolled out through the gap.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D06. GREAT STEAM ERUPTION, SEPTEMBER 8,
1908</small></p>
<p>One of the largest eruptions happened on June 14, when the
steam was repeatedly blown up to a great height, and getting into
a still region of several thousand feet above the crater, spread
out on both sides into a great mushroom cap. At one period, while
we were looking at it, a more forcible eruption took place, and
the ascending column penetrated the mushroom and formed a cone
above it, as shown in the figure.</p>
<p>A beautiful eruption occurred on November 27, while a party
was breaking camp at a height of about 1600 ft. on the mountain.
Many diverging columns of steam shot up simultaneously, forming a
design like Prince of Wales feathers. It was accompanied by
varied and curious cloud forms. An attempt to depict it is made
in the second illustration.</p>
<p>From May till September, when it was sufficiently dark to
allow it to be seen, a red glow was common at the mouth of the
crater. Usually it only lighted up at long intervals (ten minutes
or more), and appeared to be simply an illumination from some
heated matter hidden within the crater. Sometimes it flared up
frequently, flashing out every few seconds, with brighter glows
at longer intervals.</p>
<p>On several occasions (as on June 14 and 25), when the
voluminous smoke-cloud showed unusual activity, there appeared to
be red-hot or incandescent matter thrown out to a considerable
height (1000 to 2000 ft. perhaps), and the glow lighted up the
lower side of the mushroom cap. Nothing was ever seen to fall
outside the edge of the crater.</p>
<p>Dr. Mackay pointed out some fumaroles on the old crater, which
were visible from the camp at Cape Royds. They would not have
been detected had they not been seen by the party which ascended
the mountain. Occasionally little jets of steam could be seen
issuing from these, and on May 21 quite a large cloud of steam
came from one of them.</p>
<p>The greatest steam eruptions did not come from Mount Erebus,
but from a point low down between it and Mount Bird. In this
direction steam-clouds were seen rising in April, but in June
Mawson twice reported considerable eruptions. On June 17 many
jets of steam were seen, extending over a considerable area.</p>
<p>On September 8 a single jet of steam shot up to an immense
height, apparently to about twice the height of Mount Erebus. A
strong gale was blowing at the time, and the steam was carried
away in a few seconds, so that there was no time to take an
angle. In spite of the gale the steam shot up with such velocity
that the column appeared quite vertical. The figure shows it too
near Erebus, for the sake of comparison.</p>

<h3>SCIENTIFIC RESULTS OF THE WESTERN JOURNEY</h3>
<h3><a name="ch-21" id="ch-21"></a><small>SECTION I:</small><br>
GEOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL</h3>
<h4><small>BY</small> RAYMOND E. PRIESTLEY, <small>GEOLOGIST OF
THE EXPEDITION</small></h4>
<p><b>THE</b> stratigraphy of that portion of the western
mountains which forms the cliffs on either side of the Ferrar
Glacier has been well described by Mr. Ferrar in his account of
the geological work carried out by the National Antarctic
Expedition, 1901-3. In its broad outlines the sequence of rocks
may be sketched as follows: (1) at the base lies a thick series
of gneisses and schists; (2) a mass of granite with intrusive
sills of dolerites lies unconformably on the schistose series;
(3) this again is capped unconformably by the series of
sedimentary rocks and interbedded volcanics to which Mr. Ferrar
has given the name of the Beacon sandstone.</p>
<p>In the foothills on either side of the lower slopes of the
glacier a series of schists and gneisses, with occasional beds of
limestone, is exposed, and the most striking feature of this
series is the great variation in texture and mineral composition
of these metamorphic rocks. Further up the valley of the glacier
these are capped by great masses of granite and porphyry, which
are traversed by one sill of dolerite and capped by another.</p>
<p>The intrusive nature of these dolerites is abundantly proved
by the fact that in places thin veins arising from it can be seen
cutting across the granite both above and below, and even in one
or two cases enclosing large masses of that rock, which thus
appear to have been caught up in the dolerite.</p>
<p>On the north side of the Bluff, which forms the western and
upper extremity of the Kukri Hills and separates the east fork of
the glacier from the Dry Valley, this structure is very
conspicuous and the lower sill of dolerite appears to divide, one
branch running upward and joining the upper sill, whilst the
other and main branch runs downward at a slight angle for a short
distance, is lost for fifty yards behind a large talus heap, and
reappears at a lower level where it becomes first horizontal and
then can be traced as far as the horizon as a broad black band
with a very slight upward trend for the last mile or two. From
the upper dolerite sill small veins extend downward into the
granite below, and in the Bluff, at the upper end of the Kukri
Hills a branch runs from the lower to the upper sill.</p>
<p>The main object of our journey up the Ferrar Glacier was to
examine the Beacon sandstone at any accessible exposures with a
view to the discovery of any traces of former organic life, and
with this object I carefully examined at every halting-place the
sandstone blocks in the moraines amongst which we frequently
encamped, but without success. Had there been originally any
organic remains the probabilities are great that they would have
been in nine cases out of ten obliterated by the intense amount
of weathering that the rocks had undergone. The more resistant of
the blocks were coated, in many cases, with a hard crust of
carbonate of lime derived from the original cementing material,
and in places as much as an eighth of an inch in thickness, and
those which were originally held together by a soluble cement
were so friable that I was able to take blocks as big as my head
and break them up in my fingers with as much ease as I could a
similar-sized block of friable marl from the English Trias;
whilst in many cases large masses, when struck fairly hard with
the haft of my geological hammer, crumbled to a powder of
individual quartz grains. Each stone, owing to its greater
capacity for absorbing heat than that of the ice around it, had
melted a hollow round it of a size dependent on its own, and in
cases where the hollows had not been tapped by some of the many
interlacing cracks with which the face of the glacier was seamed,
they were full of thaw-water covered only when in shadow by a
thin sheet of ice, and the saline taste of this water, which we
frequently were compelled to use for cooking purposes, was an
eloquent tribute to the amount of matter filched from the
boulders.</p>
<p>Having examined the medial and lateral moraines up as far as
the Cathedral Rocks, and now approaching a region where, judging
from the map, there seemed some likelihood of reaching accessible
exposures of large masses of the Beacon sandstone, I asked
Armytage to make for the passage between the Solitary Rocks and
the north side of the glacier, and to make a <i>détour</i> on the
way in order to examine the foot of the Obelisk Range if
possible.</p>
<p>In pursuance of this plan we left the Cathedral Rocks on
December 20 and made for the north side of the glacier, examining
morainic matter on the way, and after successfully negotiating a
series of ice-falls by keeping well to the north, we camped
practically on the site of Scott's first camp after leaving the
Dry Valley, namely, at the north-western end of the Bluff, which
forms the upper end of the Kukri Hills. We had a good view of the
Solitary Rocks from here and of the islands beyond them, and, in
view of subsequent discoveries on closer inspection, I may here
say that from our camp of this might I would myself have declared
both that the Solitary Rocks were an island, that there were two
islands off the south-eastern end of them, and that in all
probability they were of Beacon sandstone, all three of which
suppositions were made by the <i>Discovery</i> sledge-parties,
and all three of which eventually turned out to be incorrect.</p>
<p>On the other hand, even from here the lowest three or four
thousand feet of the Obelisk Range, marked on the map as Beacon
sandstone, looked much more like the granite bluff under which we
were camped, and I was more than ever anxious to examine it as
closely as possible.</p>
<p>It was at this date that Armytage informed me that he was
afraid his orders would not allow us to reach the Depôt Nunatak
as he was due to meet the Northern Party at Butter Point on
January 3, and as that removed my chance of getting fossils from
the carbonaceous bands which occur in the sandstone of the
nunatak, I determined to give fuller attention to that lobe of
the glacier we were now entering and to examine the Obelisk
Range, if possible, and the Solitary Rocks, together with the
islands off them.</p>
<p>We therefore broke camp on the 21st and reached the north wall
of the glacier late in the afternoon, but found ourselves cut off
from the cliff exposure as the ice terminated in a sheer
precipice between two and three hundred feet high and with a
considerable and swift river running at the bottom. It was,
however, possible from where we were to see the grain of the
coarser varieties of the rock, and I had no hesitation whatever,
even then, in naming it in my diary as a similar granite, with
intrusions of a dark green porphyry to that seen in the Kukri
Hills.</p>
<p>On continuing round the lobe of the glacier, the next big fact
which forced itself on my recognition was that the Solitary Rocks
were not islands, but were connected with the north wall of the
glacier by a ridge of the same granite over a thousand feet
high.</p>
<p>We were obliged at the time that this first became clear to us
to move further towards the centre of the ice, as the edges of
the glacier had been swept clear of snow, and Armytage did not
care to camp on the bare ice with a strong wind blowing straight
towards the ice-cliff. After the camp had been pitched, Armytage
volunteered to go with me, and we walked down to to the edge of
the cliff opposite the north wall of the glacier and followed
this cliff round until we were opposite the Solitary Rocks, thus
clearly demonstrating that there is no passage for the glacier
ice to the north of these rocks, but that they are the butt end
of a peninsula banking up the ice above and forcing it round to
the southern side, where it descends as a series of ice-falls. At
the foot of the cliff, in the corner made by the isthmus and the
main mass of the Obelisk Range, there lies a lake of considerable
size which was fed by a stream from under the Solitary Rocks and
by many torrents from the gullies in the mountains. This lake
gives rise to the main drainage river, which follows the north
wall of the glacier. I subsequently saw this river at its mouth,
and found that in reaching the sea it splits into a number of
sluggish distributaries which have deposited a considerable delta
of fine detritus at the eastern extremity of the Dry Valley. The
amount of river denudation, although accomplished in a very small
portion of the year, must be of no mean geological result, since
all the many streams I saw during this thaw were choked with fine
sediment, and the lake was of a yellow colour owing to the amount
of fine material held in suspension in its waters.</p>

<p>At two points I was able, during the next day, to gain access
to the Solitary Rocks. These consist of alternate bands of black
and yellow rock which are identified on Ferrar's map as dolerite
and Beacon sandstone; but on December 22 I climbed down the
ice-cliff, crossed the frozen stream separating me from the
exposure, climbed up the talus scree and collected from the lower
yellow band of the Northern Solitary and found the rock to be a
granite similar to that of the Kukri Hills.</p>
<p>There were numerous specimens of the dark porphyry in the
scree, but I saw none <i>in situ</i>. I also picked up several
pieces of a dark fine-grained basaltic rock in the moraines, a
fact which points to the occurrence of basalts among the volcanic
rocks of the upper regions of the glacier. The large height at
which these last ice-worn specimens were found indicates to some
extent what shrinking there has been in the amount of ice
overflowing through this great glacier. It was at this exposure
that I observed many great blocks that had evidently fallen from
the upper yellow band, and as these proved to be a granite
differing from that of the lower band only in being of somewhat
finer and more compact texture, I decided to ask Armytage to
allow me to prolong my stay on this side of the glacier for a few
hours longer in order to collect if possible from this upper band
itself. In this attempt I was partially thwarted as I was unable
to find any accessible place where the scree reached right to the
upper band, but fortunately I was able at one other place to
collect from some blocks of the rock which had fallen on the top
of a scree sufficiently high to cover up the lower granite
completely and also half the dolerite band above it. I have not
the slightest hesitation, therefore, in mapping both the light
bands of the Solitary Rocks as granite.</p>
<p>Specimens were also collected from the lower dolerite band,
but the upper one proved inaccessible.</p>
<p>After leaving these rocks we decided to make a day's march
round by the islands mapped at their south-eastern extremity, and
from there to the bluff end of the Kukri Hills before proceeding
to the south side of the glacier to look for fossils in the
Beacon sandstone of the Knob Head Mountain and the Terracotta
Range. At the point where the island (for the two islands
indicated on the <i>Discovery</i> map proved to be one) was
struck, it proved inaccessible, but was sufficiently close for a
fairly accurate description to be noted down and a rough plan and
sketch were also taken. At the north-western end the sill of
dolerite still remained as a sheet of considerable thickness
capping the granite, and cutting across the granite were two
pipes of dolerite several feet thick which persisted until they
were lost beneath the ice. The middle of the island is much lower
than either end, and this causes the island, when viewed from
some distance, to have the appearance of two smaller ones. The
south-eastern end of the island is a low granite hill with one
shoulder capped by a thin portion of the dolerite sill, the
majority of which has been removed by denudation. A specimen
picked up proved the dolerite to be a much finer-grained variety
than that of the Solitary Rocks. The plan will be published in
the geological volume of the results of the expedition, together
with other sections illustrating different details.</p>
<p>Subsequently we moved across to Knob Head Mountain, and the
rest of the time before it was necessary for the party to return
was occupied by an exhaustive examination of the rocks of that
mountain and the Terracotta Mountains, which, though they yielded
no fossils, produced many fine specimens in different varieties
of the Beacon sandstones, and of junctions between the sandstone
and the dolerite. Specimens of many other types of rocks were
obtained from the moraines at the foot of the cliffs.</p>
<p>The cliffs at this spot are seamed with gullies, which must be
almost always swept by the strong winds which blew practically
continuously during the three or four days we stayed there. A
geological result of this overflow of cold air from the inland
plateau is that several beautiful instances of mechanical
weathering through the agency of the sand blast are to be seen.
The most marked instance of this type of weathering was to be
seen in the occurrence of numerous cups of sandstone beautifully
polished and concentrically striated on the outside and hollowed
out more or less perfectly inside, ranging in size from that of a
large cocoanut to that of an ordinary glass marble. We were for
some time puzzled to account for the origin of these potholes, as
we named them, but the mystery was cleared up when a block of
weathered sandstone was found which proved to be full of round
patches, anything up to half a foot in diameter, which were of a
different colour and consistency from the rest of the rock.
Several of these round nodules had weathered out and were lying
at different distances from the parent rock, and when one or two
of them were collected and broken across the middle with a hammer
they were seen to consist of a very hard and indurated outer
shell from an eighth to half in inch thick, enclosing a dark
green ferruginous-looking sandstone of larger grain and with less
cohesion between the grains. The mode of origin of these
structures was now clear for they were to be seen in all stages
of formation from the nodule which was left intact and only
polished on the outside, through the various intermediate stages,
to the perfect cup where the inside had been completely cleaned
out and only the polished outer shell was left, containing many
of the quartz grains which had been used by the wind as a file to
get rid of the less resistant portion of the stone. Even a
further stage was to be seen, for in time the outer shell itself
began to wear away and the cup became sufficiently light to be
moved by the wind and many had been lifted up and smashed to
pieces.</p>
<p>One other testimony to the power of the plateau wind as a
denuding agent was well shown at a height of 6000 ft. on the
Terracotta Mountain, where the talus became sufficiently thin for
the Beacon sandstone to be seen <i>in situ</i>. One of the beds
of sandstone was a fine grained white rock and this stood out in
ledges eighteen or twenty inches wide, and the underside of these
ledges had been weathered into a series of thin, roughly
hexagonal columns from one to nine inches long, and from a
quarter to half an inch thick.</p>
<p>Where these columns hung close together their original
structure seemed, as before mentioned, to be hexagonal, and it
appears probable that the weathering has been assisted in
producing this particular type by some secondary structure due to
alteration and secondary crystallisation in the rock itself. When
the columns hung further apart, owing to the gaps made by the
entire removal of some, they had lost all definite shape and
resembled nothing so much as stone icicles. Several specimens of
both types of weathered sandstone were collected, but those of
the latter type were extremely difficult to preserve during a
sledge journey over rough ice, and one or two also were damaged
in the transition from the Butter Point Depôt to the ship.</p>
<p>On the way down the glacier any specimens were collected which
had peculiar markings on them, and these and the other specimens
secured will be carefully examined when the detailed petrological
work is done, but it is very improbable that any of them will
reveal the presence of any organic remains sufficiently unaltered
to be identifiable.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the east fork of the glacier and on the
north side we passed and examined moraines which were essentially
different from the ordinary moraines met with higher up, and
there seems no doubt that the sea has played a considerable part
in the heaping up of this material at the mouth of the glacier.
It is proposed to deal more fully with this subject in that
section of the chapter having reference to the recent elevation
of land.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-22" id="ch-22"></a>SECTION II:<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE STRANDED MORAINES AND DRY VALLEY, WITH SPECIAL
REFERENCE TO THE RECENT ELEVATION OF THE LAND BORDERING McMURDO
SOUND</h3>
<p>We first visited the moraines on December 4, when I collected
a few specimens of rock and some moss and fungus for Murray, but
was not able to take much extra weight as we were already pulling
215 lb. per man. Subsequent visits were made on December 13 and
January 5, and it is from notes taken on these three visits that
I have compiled the description which follows.</p>
<p>The moraines are several miles long and of considerable
breadth, while many of their numerous small hills reach a height
of between a hundred and a hundred and fifty feet. They consist
of a heterogeneous collection of <i>débris</i> of numerous
varieties of rocks, and the material ranges in size from blocks
containing many cubic feet of rock to the finest dust. They are
separated from the Piedmont glacier which here fringes the
mountains by a stream-channel cut out almost to sea-level, and
the water which has accomplished this erosion is evidently the
result of the summer thaw, the stream being fed during that
season both from the glacier and from the snowdrifts on the
western side of the moraines. This stream is undercutting the
ice, and from the exposures of morainic material on its western
bank it appears probable that the mantle of <i>débris</i>
continues right up to the flanks of the foothills to the
west.</p>
<p>The <i>débris</i> being mostly of a dark colour the amount of
thaw in summer is considerable, and the whole district is seamed
with stream-channels which, during the few sunny days in the
height of summer, are filled with running water. Every basin-like
hollow between the ridges and peaks is filled with a lake
corresponding in size to that of the hollow. In spite of the
loose nature of the <i>débris</i> the lake basins are enabled to
hold water because at all periods of the year the ground at a
depth of a few feet is frozen hard. Even in summer, the whole
mass of the <i>débris</i>, except an outer mantle, is firmly
cemented, in consequence of the freezing at a slight depth of the
percolating water supplied by the melting snowdrifts.</p>
<p>Proof of this is seen where the streams have cut fairly deep
channels in the moraines. In the walls of these channels
lenticles of opaque ice fairly free from gravel and varying from
an inch or two to a couple of feet in thickness are to be seen in
many places, while in other places, if a few feet of the outer
mantle of the stream-cliff are removed, the gravel behind is
found to be firmly cemented.</p>
<p>Most of the streams run northwards, and at the northern end of
the moraines quite a thick alluvial deposit, having a strong
resemblance to a series of miniature deltas, is to be seen along
the ice-foot, awaiting subsequent removal to the sea. The amount
of material removed from the moraines in this way must be very
considerable. Another agency which must be fast reducing the size
of the moraines is the direct heat of the summer sun on the
cliffs at the northern end. Frequently while we were camped near
the moraines small avalanches of gravel and mud fell on to the
ice-foot, and many tons of material brought down in this manner
must be carried away when the ice-foot breaks up in the late
summer months. The wind also plays an important part in the
transport of finer material; the snow for several miles to the
north of the moraines being full of grit, which is so abundant
that, as I have observed in my diary, it accelerates considerably
the melting of the drift-snow and surface of the ice.</p>
<p>There is a much greater proportion of pebbles and larger
boulders in the upper layers of the morainic material than in the
lower, as seen in section in the northern cliff exposures. This
phenomenon, I think, is partially explained by the fact that the
finer material would gradually be carried down by the thaw-water
and used to increase the compactness of the lower layers at the
expense of the upper ones; but in addition I am inclined to
believe that when the glacier which borders the moraines was
actually providing an outlet for the ice accumulating on the
mountains above it, it brought down its quota of morainic
material from the local sources, which local material would reach
the moraines rather in the condition of large fragments than as
the finely divided <i>débris</i> which is essentially the result
of the prolonged trituration for which a long journey is
necessary. This latter explanation finds support in the abundance
of local erratics on that portion of the moraines nearest the
shore, erratics which are identical with the different great
formations which crop out in the sides of the glacier valleys
furrowing the western mountains. As for the material which makes
up the main mass of the moraines, a great proportion of it must
have come across the Sound, because while there is no evidence of
any other great outburst of kenytic material besides that of
Mount Erebus, large quantities of kenyte and kenytic fragmental
rocks were picked up by my companions and myself during our short
stay here.</p>
<p>With regard to the distribution of the local erratics, I will
quote a note from my diary of January 6, 1909, when I observed
that: "The southernmost portion of the moraines is almost
entirely composed of angular basaltic and kenytic <i>débris</i>
on the seaward side, the local boulders becoming more common as
the landward side is approached, though at the northern end of
the moraines these boulders become very numerous even on the
extreme seaward side."</p>
<p>An important characteristic in addition to those already noted
is the very isolated occurrence of some of the erratics.</p>
<p>Some small conical heaps consisting entirely of fragments of
one kind of rock were undoubtedly, from the angular nature of the
fragments, the final results of the frost weathering of very
large original blocks. Not so in all cases, however. In the case
of one basalt tuff particularly I noticed that it was found
entirely covering two or three small hills at the south-eastern
corner of the moraines, and I found it nowhere else. The pieces
were all rounded or subangular and they were too scattered to
have been the result of the weathering of a few large
boulders.</p>
<p>I have noticed in my diary a similar occurrence of olivine
basalt on one ol the mounds fringing the Terraced Lake at Cape
Barne, within two miles of winter quarters.</p>
<p>One fact points to recent elevation of these moraines. At the
north-eastern end of the moraines a number of flat-topped lulls
and ridges were of the same height and all capped by several
inches of a brownish deposit which proved, on examination, to be
a fungus similar to those found in the lakes at winter quarters.
The whole district seems, therefore, to have been at quite a
recent date a lake bed. The lake has been elevated and drained,
and its bed has been dissected by streams, whilst the higher land
which formerly existed to the east and constituted the boundary
of the lake, has been worn down and removed during the recent
elevation of the moraines by a combination of the successive
summer thaws and marine erosion.</p>
<p>I have given a fairly full description of these moraines
because their characteristics are interesting, and they are a
duplicate of those we afterwards examined in the north-eastern
fork of the Ferrar Glacier, to which Captain Scott gave the name
of Dry Valley. In describing the latter I wish to pay particular
attention to the raised beach there.</p>
<p>Specimens of moss, fungus and alga were secured, as also
numerous specimens of a peculiar rotifer living in the lakes, but
a striking feature of the life of the moraines was the absence of
any type of lichen.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE DRY VALLEY OF NEW
HARBOUR</small><br></p>
<p>It was originally intended that a sledge-party of three should
make an exhaustive examination of the area which was originally
occupied by the north-eastern arm of the Ferrar Glacier, but from
which the ice has at present retreated, and which is now covered
by a thick deposit of morainic <i>débris</i>. The plans were,
however, decidedly modified through the Northern Party failing to
return to Butter Point, and our operations being much restricted
by our orders, we were unfortunately unable to spend more than
two days in the Valley. On January 12 we left Butter Point for
New Harbour, and reached our objective at 6 p.m. the same
day.</p>
<p>The 13th and 14th were spent examining the moraines, and on
the 15th we returned to our permanent camping-place at the Point,
and resumed our wait for the Northern Party.</p>
<p>We had hardly been on shore half an hour when Armytage picked
up some fragments of <i>Pecten colbecki</i>, the shell of a
mollusc, which is still found living on the sea-floor at Back
Door Bay. Encouraged by this find we devoted all our energies
towards making similar discoveries at different points along the
foreshore, and were successful beyond my wildest hopes. Not only
were numerous fragments and many whole valves of the
<i>Pecten</i> obtained at all elevations up to fifty feet above
sea-level, but in several spots fragments of the shell of an
<i>Anatina</i>, a mollusc which still flourishes abundantly in
the sea on the other side, were very numerous, and in one place,
by digging down several inches into the sand with the lid of a
cocoa-tin, I secured two double-valve shells of another species
of bivalve which I have seen commonly in our biologist's
dredge.</p>
<p>From the abundance of the shells I have no doubt at all that
this was a genuine raised beach, and the recent nature of the
shells points to the probability of the rise of the land being
still in progress. A few shells might have been cast up by the
waves of a storm during the short time that the bay is free from
ice or ice-foot, but the vast number of the organic remains
precludes the possibility of their having all been cast up by
this means, while a still stronger point is the nature and
wholeness of the shells: both the <i>Pecten</i> and the
<i>Anatina</i> possess shells of extreme fragility, and we cannot
suppose that they could be hurled about by waves capable of
throwing them hundreds of yards up the gravel banks without being
smashed to atoms. Yet hundreds of valves of the <i>Pecten</i>
especially were practically intact, ears and all, and the only
way to account for their presence so far out of their native
element is on the supposition of a gradual rising of the land,
such as, from evidence recently brought to light, appears to be
taking place along large stretches of the western coast of the
Sound.</p>
<p>There were large mud-flats bordering the ice-foot in this
valley, and these reached their greatest extent where they were
augmented by the deltaic material of the many streams draining
the valley, and on them, a few feet above the present sea-level,
I secured numerous specimens of amphipods, and sea-spiders, and
one small fish, all in a much desiccated condition. It is not
necessary to postulate a recent rise in the level of the land to
account for these specimens, since, in the short period when the
sea is released from the control of its icy winter covering, a
strong wind blowing directly into the bay would inevitably cause
a rise in the level of the water sufficient to assure the
submergence of those portions of the mud-flats immediately
adjacent to the ice-foot. Upon the recession of the sea, numerous
animals would be left stranded in any slight depression in the
recently covered flats, and evaporation and ablation would remove
the sea water during the late summer and autumn, leaving the
desiccated remains of the animals and giving rise to an
efflorescence of salt on the surface of the mud. Indeed, this
sequence of events might very well have been caused by the very
blizzard which raged from February 20 to the 22nd, 1908, when the
<i>Nimrod</i> was driven north.</p>
<p>The remaining features of the Dry Valley moraines are very
much a repetition of those of the stranded moraines, but on a
much larger scale. I was unfortunately only able in the limited
time at my disposal to cursorily examine a few square miles of
the moraines, and in my longest excursion only penetrated three
or four miles inland. This particular walk, however, resulted in
one interesting observation, for I reached a height of between
five hundred and six hundred feet, and found that the abundance
of what might be called erratics foreign to the valley, namely,
kenyte and basalt and fragmental rocks appertaining to these two
types, had in no wise diminished in quantity, their proportion to
those rocks which obviously might have been derived from the
sides of the valley or from the higher reaches of the glacier
remaining much the same as at sea-level.</p>
<p>Only two of the many stream-channels which furrow the district
immediately round the camp are now active, the rest being at the
best only occupied by a series of stagnant pools, while numerous
depressions of smaller extent, with a heavy efflorescence of salt
coating the gravel, mark the site of former pools.</p>
<p>The most northerly and most flourishing stream in the Dry
Valley has cut a channel fifty feet deep through the stratified
gravel, the sides of which slope steeply at angles between 45°
and 75°. The water here was unfit to drink, owing to the amount
of fine sediment held in suspension. As the stream became
sluggish when breaking up into numerous branches and meandering
across the alluvial stretches of land at its mouth, this fine
sediment could quite easily be observed settling down in
sufficient quantity to add appreciably to the delta even in the
course of a few days.</p>
<p>During our stay at this camp I collected numerous specimens of
the more interesting erratics and bags of the finer material of
the deposits, and Brocklehurst secured specimens from New Harbour
Heights, including two pieces of fairly pure calcite from one of
the limestones interbedded with the Archæan schists.</p>
<p align="center"><small>BIOLOGICAL FIELD NOTES</small><br></p>
<p>Specimens of moss, fungus and lichen were obtained for Murray.
One of these specimens is worth individual notice, namely, a
fungus-like substance growing as a thick layer on the black mud
of the tide-flats just above the present level of the water and
well inside the region which must be covered either at an
ordinary high tide or during any unusual rise of the water.</p>
<p>The peculiar point about the plant which first struck me was
the formation of a series of cones, as much as six inches high,
and formed by the gas from the organic mud underneath collecting
as large bubbles under the impervious skin of fungus.</p>
<p>We saw altogether three whole specimens of Crabeater seals and
a like number of Weddells dead on the hills hereabouts, and the
moraines are covered with scattered remains. One of the Crabeater
carcases was lying at a steep angle on one of the banks bordering
the northern stream I have mentioned earlier in my notes, and at
a height above sea-level of considerably over two hundred feet,
but this does not compare with the heights at which we found
similar skeletons in the Ferrar Glacier Valley, no less than
three being found there between the two thousand-and three
thousand-foot levels.</p>
<p align="center"><small>MORAINES IN THE EAST FORK OF THE FERRAR
GLACIER</small><br></p>
<p>The last ten miles of the east valley of the Ferrar Glacier
below the first ice-falls is occupied by a peculiar variety of
ice which, at its highest point, is not forty feet above
sea-level, and is apparently composed largely of frozen slush
formed by the inundation of the winter snowdrifts by the summer
thaw-water. With this are intermingled patches of
macrocrystalline ice exactly comparable with the ice so common on
the lakes at Cape Royds, especially Blue Lake, and evidently
caused by the freezing of pure thaw-water. I propose to give the
detailed evidence regarding the nature of this stretch of ice
when the scientific results of the expedition are published in
full. At present I will only mention certain deposits, a portion
of which is visible as a series of small hills protruding above
the ice-surface, which hills, from their occurrence in a fairly
straight line, appear to be the more prominent peaks of a
partially submerged ridge. These deposits I examined carefully on
December 31, 1908, on our return from the glacier, and was able
to secure numerous specimens which rendered it certain that they
are exactly comparable with the stranded moraines and also with
those afterwards examined in the Dry Valley. Concerning these
deposits I have down in my diary the following notes: "Large
quantities of the <i>débris</i> are composed of the local
granites and schists, but in the space of half an hour I have
picked up specimens of two or three varieties of tuff
(consolidated volcanic ash), basalt, kenyte and an olivine and
augite kenyte which occurs sparsely at Cape Royds, and which I
have so named because it contains large porphyritic crystals of
augite and olivine besides the more common anorthoclase felspar,
and also various porphyries which I have not seen or heard of in
the valley itself."</p>
<p>Thus in the case of all three of these moraines, the stranded
moraines, those of the Dry Valley, and those of the East Fork of
the Ferrar Glacier, the conclusion is irresistible that a
considerable portion of the material composing them has either
been brought many miles up the coast of the Sound, or has been
carried right across the Sound. The three agencies which alone
could be responsible for this transport to any large extent are:
(1) Shoredrift. (2) A considerably greater extent of the
ice-sheet and all its affluents, such as glaciers, barriers,
&amp;c. Of such an extension there are abundant evidences, of
which I may here mention the finding of granite and schistose
erratics at a height of 1100 ft. on the slopes of Erebus by
Professor David, Armytage and myself in the autumn of last year.
(3) The third agency, and one which I have myself observed in
operation, is the transporting power of icebergs and pieces
broken off the ice-foot. At Cape Royds I have frequently seen,
especially around Flagstaff Point, large boulders of kenyte being
carried out on pieces of the ice-foot, and I have seen several
icebergs which were full of a fairly fine sediment. While the ice
is at its present extent, however, this last agency can only be a
minor one.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-23" id="ch-23"></a>SECTION III:<br>
EFFECT OF THE SUMMER SUN ON DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF ICE AND
SNOW</h3>
<p>The melting of large stretches of normally pure snow is
carried out by the increase of some grains to the detriment of
others, and this, in cases where the air temperature is low and
the upper crust is cooled by a cold breeze, results in the
formation of crusts of snow delicately equipoised over
considerable areas, for the vapour from the lower snow crystals
is cooled and condensed on those of the upper layer, and in time
the crystals of the latter become firmly joined together.
Underneath this layer the ablating process still continues,
leaving as a final product a powder of much larger granules of
snow than the particles of the original drift, whilst the upper
crust is only immediately supported from beneath in places few
and far between. Quite commonly, when the leader of the
sledge-party stepped on the edge of one of these areas, the whole
crust would shatter and fall to the ground with a soft sibilant
sound.</p>
<p>It is this process which causes the lessening in the amount of
true drift in the summer blizzards. In those winds during this
season which were free from snow the only drift was a low one,
seldom reaching above our thighs, and I should decidedly
attribute this to the fact that the granules of ice produced by
the summer ablation are sufficiently large and heavy to prevent
an ordinary wind from carrying them very far or high.</p>
<p>When this process is going on in the drifts above the sea-ice
it is somewhat modified, because the sea-ice melts at a
temperature between 28° and 29° Fahr., causing actual thawing of
the drift to take place from below and the ice-crust over the top
of the drifts to become much thicker. The thickness in cases of
deep drifts attains as much as a quarter of an inch. When this
crust breaks beneath the foot, an unwary explorer is liable to be
let down six or nine inches into a pool of salt water several
inches deep, and this rendered sledging over the sea ice in the
late summer particularly objectionable.</p>
<p>On December 21 the temperature of the air in the Ferrar
Glacier Valley reached 40° Fahr., and in the few hours during
which the air remained calm two inches of snow which had fallen
the previous night had either been entirely removed as thaw-water
or converted into a thin coating of rough ice, opaque through the
inclusion of air, which formed a distinct help to us in our
subsequent marches, as it very much reduced the slipperiness of
the ablation ripples.</p>
<p>The principal characteristics of this big thaw on an Antarctic
glacier are interesting, and some of them may be mentioned here.
Every stone in the glacial moraines is surrounded by a large
hollow, scooped out by the heat radiation from the boulder, and
these hollows are all, more or less, full of thaw-water, which is
also overflowing through every deep ablation ripple and crack. A
number of the small rivulets from these sources join up at a
little distance from their source to form a stream, and
innumerable streams are flowing down over the convex face of the
glacier to join the river which can be heard roaring at the foot
of the cliff which ends the ice-face. In searching for a camp on
the night of the 21st we passed across large areas of the glacier
face which were slightly depressed below the general level and at
the bottoms of these depressions we were compelled to wade
through stretches of water, three or four inches deep, for
hundreds of yards. Other characteristics of the thaw are
described in one of the extracts taken from my diary and drafted
into the general report of the journey in a previous part of the
book.</p>

<p align="center"><small>118. STREAM OF RUNNING WATER IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE FERRAR GLACIER IN MIDSUMMER</small></p>
<p>One other effect of the sun's heat on snow under peculiar
conditions, which I should like to mention here, is the case I
noticed of the snow surrounding many boulders in the lowest
reaches of the glacier below the first ice-falls. Much of the
larger morainic <i>débris</i> was here surrounded by a coating of
pure ice under the snow of the drift, and between each boulder
and the drift snow was to be seen a transitional granular stage
like that already mentioned, but much more exaggerated, many of
the grains nearest the boulder being a quarter of an inch or more
in diameter.</p>
<p>Finally, in closing this short report of the scientific
results of the western journey, I should like to pay a tribute to
the generous help I received from my companions, who thought
nothing of climbing screes many hundreds and even thousands of
feet in height at the end of a long day's march in order to
assist me in obtaining a representative geological collection, so
that many of the most valuable specimens secured were collected
by them. To Armytage especially, the leader of the party my
thanks are due for the unfailing consideration he showed for the
scientific work of the party and for the way he accompanied me on
every excursion I made after specimens of any description. For
reading the manuscript of this article and suggesting many
alterations in the text I am much indebted to Mr. T. F. Sibly,
D.Sc., F.G.S.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON PHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, AND MINERALOGY</h3>
<h3><a name="ch-25" id="ch-25"></a>IV.1: ICE AND SNOW</h3>
<h4><small>NOTES BY</small> DOUGLAS MAWSON, B.Sc., B.E.</h4>
<p><b>THE</b> most interesting results were obtained in a study
of ice in all its forms, the temperature conditions in such a
climate producing phenomena hardly to be realized by the student
of more temperate regions. At temperatures even far below
freezing-point, snow is able to compact itself and become quite
hard by a slow process of vaporisation and recrystallisation. The
tendency is for the smaller snow particles to disappear and the
larger to be added to at their expense, and when other conditions
are suitable well-formed crystals are built up in this way. Thus
well-developed hexagonal barrel-shaped crystals of ice were found
developed on a seal's liver, which had been buried during the
winter.</p>
<p>Variations in atmospheric temperatures were always accompanied
by phenomena such as this; for example, at times of falling
temperature, no matter through what limits, a development of
spicular ice formed over all exposed objects. This accompanied a
fall of even, say, from 50° Fahr. to 60° Fahr. below
freezing-point. Serious interference with spectroscopic work was
thus introduced on account of the camera lens becoming thickly
coated with ice. A similar phenomenon was continually produced in
a small laboratory built as an adjunct to the hut. This opened
indirectly by the outer passage to the interior of the hut. Moist
air from the living-quarters, kept at a mean temperature just
above freezing-point, circulated through the cracks around the
door and entered the laboratory, which for the most of the time
maintained a mean temperature of 40° Fahr. to 50° Fahr. below
freezing-point; there the water vapour crystallised out, coating
the walls and passages with a thick formation of ice blades. The
result was exquisitely beautiful, but most undesirable, finally
making it necessary to abandon the room for everything but ice
work.</p>

src="1202761h-images/pic120.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>120. ICE FORMATIONS</small></p>
<p>In the same way ice formations appeared on the colder portions
of the interior of the hut. In crevasses beautifully formed
crystals up to four inches in length were found developed on the
walls from circulating vapour. Along cracks in the sea ice during
winter such formations were abundantly produced. In such
situations the seawater actually "smokes", an effect due to the
freezing out of abundant water vapour present in the warmer air
ascending from it. This condensation produces beautiful fern-like
crystal formations, not only on the sides of the cracks but also
on the frozen sea surface itself; these ice flowers are best
developed when the surface waters freeze most rapidly.</p>
<p>During the formation of the surface ice some of the sea salts
are squeezed upward through capillary cracks to the surface and
there in the form of concentrated brine eventually freeze as
cryo-hydrates and form nuclei for additions from atmospheric
water vapour. The net result is the production of little
rosette-shaped aggregates of radiating crystal blades, which were
met with up to two inches in height.</p>
<p>As a rule, however, the moisture is precipitated from the
atmosphere in the form of snow. Rain is quite unknown in South
Victoria Land. Many varieties of snow were observed. When
precipitation occurred near freezing-point the snow fell as large
six-rayed feathery flakes. It appeared that even at the same
temperature, if the chilling of the vapour-laden air was more
rapid, the snow fell as tiny felted spheres, one-tenth of an inch
and more in diameter. This we referred to as sago, or tapioca
snow, according to the coarseness of the grain. Snow falling in
colder conditions, appears as tiny compact six-rayed crystals. At
times when low temperatures prevailed, the air was filled with
tiny crystals of ice about one-hundredth of an inch in diameter
descending from a cloudless sky.</p>
<p>Recently fallen snow is quite soft, but soon compacts itself.
This may take place in summer-time within a few hours should a
cold period succeed a warmer one. A piecrust-like surface is
produced in this way where a superficial hardening of the soft
snow has preceded, though not sufficiently strong to support a
heavily laden sledge. Very soon, however, the snow becomes more
firmly bound together, and the usual smooth-sledging type of
winter snow-ice surface is produced. What is known as barrier ice
in the Antarctic is an immensely thick formation of this
compacted snow horizontally stratified. This is what one sees in
the face of the Ross Barrier and numerous other small barriers
along the coast. Its characteristic horizontal surface, vertical
fractures, and dazzling whiteness distinguish it from other
varieties of ice even at a great distance. Nearer at hand, the
stratification lines, appearing every few inches apart, are
readily noticeable. Such barrier ice is really a snowfield afloat
and may be expected in tongue-like forms jutting out into the sea
at the debouchure of glaciers, or forming the cliffs along the
sea-fronts of piedmont glacier-slopes. The granules increase in
size and are more intimately interlocked in the lower portions of
such formations. The tabular icebergs typical of the Antarctic
which have originated by breaking off from the barriers, are,
owing to the nature of their formation, less dense and far more
buoyant than the transparent glacier-icebergs of the Arctic. The
plateau ice, existing under conditions of great cold, sparse
snowfall, and continuous strong winds, is predominantly hard. At
a short distance below the surface it is still finely granular,
but very compact. This is seen where the blizzards have abraded
the superficial softer formation and exposed the deeper ice in
channelled sastrugi; it then resembles polished Carrara marble.
The more typical glacier-ice consists of interlocking crystals an
inch or more in diameter.</p>
<p>In the vicinity of Cape Royds there are a number of small
lakes occupying rocky basins. The smaller of these thaw out each
year during summer, others are only partly thawed, or not at all.
In these, refrigeration during the autumn proceeds under tranquil
conditions. As a result the ice appears prismatic with the longer
axes of the prisms parallel and vertical. Winter snow, falling on
this surface, slowly consolidates, building at the same time
similarly oriented additions to the surface ends of the lake ice
prisms. Should several years succeed without thawing, a most
interesting structure is produced, the nature of which is made
evident by the subsequent removal by blizzards of the
unconsolidated snow. It then presents a smooth, polished surface
exhibiting a mosaic appearance, produced by clear ice prisms
separated by lines of white ice containing air cavities.</p>
<p>As refrigeration goes on in the lakes, the saline contents are
gradually concentrated in the residual liquid and a continuously
increasing cold is required to freeze each succeeding separation.
Ultimately a meshwork of ice and cryo-hydrate crystals is formed
at the bottom of the lakes. As some of the lakes are very saline,
this cryo-hydrate often bulks large. Some of it freezes at as low
a temperature as 50° Fahr. below freezing-point.</p>
<p>In the case of sea-ice the first stages differ somewhat from
those of lake-ice. On account of the wave movements, the regular
growth of vertical prisms is seldom possible in the initial
stages. Instead, delicate glancing scale-like crystals of ice
form on the surface and are seen floating about, even at the
depth of several feet. The single scales are but an inch or less
in diameter, but they soon unite to form freely floating
rosettes. Eventually, as these become more abundant, a complete
felt-work is produced. In this stage the ice, only one to three
inches in thickness, is partially transparent and appears dark,
as the colour of the sea shows through it. This ice is peculiarly
flexible. Unless a heavy swell intervenes the ice is now
sufficiently strong to hold together and to aid in maintaining
the sea in a tranquil state. If, however, the swell increases,
the ice is broken into pieces of a foot or more in diameter,
depending on its thickness at the time. These fragments, jostling
each other continuously, become rounded and develop a turned-up
rim. This is called pancake ice. Eventually, with the advent of
calmer conditions, the pancake ice may be firmly frozen together.
Crystallisation now proceeds by additions from below. Thus,
vertical prismatic ice similar to that found in the lakes is
produced. These prisms may be half an inch in diameter, and many
inches in length. A few hours of still, cold weather goes far to
freeze over the sea. If, however, the air temperature rises, the
active formation of ice is suspended, to be resumed when the
temperature again falls. By a succession of such variations in
temperature a horizontal banded appearance is produced in the
sea-ice; each band representing a separate period of
refrigeration. The lake-ice often showed a banded appearance
resembling this, and the greater or lesser abundance of air
bubbles set free from the frozen water and included in the ice is
due to a similar cause. The banding in the sea-ice is due to an
alteration of more and less opaque layers of ice, of half an inch
to several inches in thickness. The sea salt mechanically
separates from the ice as the latter forms and is partially
forced out into the sea water below, and partially included in
white vertical tracts between the ice prisms. When the unfrozen
sea surface is agitated by winds at very low temperatures, the
spray is apt to freeze as it scuds through the air and it falls
back as ice. In this way the whole surface of the sea may assume
a pea-soup-like consistency. Strong winds, producing a swell, may
break up the solid sea-ice and drive it along as a field of
separate floating masses. This is termed pack-ice, and may
eventually become frozen together as an irregular surface field
of ice. In cases of this kind huge icebergs are not infrequently
found frozen in amongst the smaller ice. Where the wind drives
floe ice before it, pressure ridges may be formed by the mounting
of some of the ice upon that in front; fragments may be piled up
to many feet in height, an operation usually accompanied by a
great crunching and grinding noise.</p>

<p>During the autumn, sea spray, dashing on the coast, remains
behind as ice. Thus a huge ice-foot develops along the coast.
Grottoes are not uncommon in this ice-foot, resembling limestone
eaves of remarkable beauty, filled with stalactites (up to
several feet in length), and stalagmites of ice. These owe their
origin largely to the fact that the more saline residual water
dripping from the roof is further chilled by exposure, and thus
continual additions are made to the formations from which the
drip has taken place. The water is highly saline and stalagmites
are produced only at very low temperatures, when they may consist
entirely of cryo-hydrate.</p>

BY</small> JAMES MURRAY</h4>
<p><small>SEA-ICE</small>.&mdash;When a crack opened out to a
yard or more in width it was very quickly filled with new ice.
The prisms composing this grew out horizontally from the older
ice at each side. They were straight and at right angles to the
edges of the crack, except where that was abruptly bent or
curved, when the adjustment to the influence of the two sides of
the angle produced oblique or even curved prisms. Good
photographs of this horizontal prismatic ice were obtained.</p>
<p>Polygonal plates of thin ice accumulated round the dredging
line when left undisturbed in the sea for some time, as
previously noticed by Hodgson. At Cape Royds this only occurred
late in the season, and seemed to be much less in amount than at
Hut Point, probably on account of the higher temperatures which
we experienced.</p>
<p><small>PRISMATIC ICE</small>.&mdash;It has been explained (by
Mawson) how the vertical prismatic structure of the irregular
surfaces of hardened snow found on the lakes has originated in
the building up of additions to the prisms of lake ice. Further
light on the formation of prismatic ice was afforded by
observations in summer when he was absent.</p>
<p>The freshwater ice found under tranquil conditions was clear
and transparent, and the prismatic structure was not evident. In
colder weather it became revealed as a very fine hexagonal
reticulation. On the surface of hardened snowdrifts prismatic
structure was developed while the lower layers of the drift
remained as snow, and therefore independently of the lake ice
prisms as a foundation.</p>

<p align="center"><small>124. ICE CRYSTALS FORMED ON A
LINE</small></p>
<p>The most interesting formation of prismatic structure was
observed at Clear Lake. On November 3, 1908, a large heap of
chips of ice were thrown out from a shaft. The chips were of hard
clear ice, and of all sizes up to several inches in diameter. On
February 24, 1909, it was found that prismatic structure had
developed in the heap, making it quite like the general surface
of the lake, which we supposed to have been derived from snow.
The prisms were most distinct at the surface, while within the
mass traces of the original chips were still visible.</p>
<p>The mosaic design showing on the surface of prismatic ice was
not uniform, nor yet was it irregular. It built up patterns, the
prisms arranging themselves round centres, as well shown in
Professor David's photographs. As the lake surfaces were more and
more smoothed by ablation the mosaic changed in character. The
prismatic structure became less distinct, and at some depth gave
place to rows of bubbles arranged in curvilinear designs, the
relation of which to the original hexagonal mosaic was not
apparent.</p>
<p>About midwinter a curious optical effect was noticed at Blue
Lake. The surface of the lake was almost entirely prismatic, but
had been much smoothed by ablation, and was marked by ripples
like those of the sand of the sea-shore, but much larger. On
walking across the lake the moonlight was constantly glancing
apparently from very large plane crystalline surfaces, several
inches in diameter, inclined at a low angle to the horizontal. On
touching these spots it was evident that there were no large
crystals on the surface, but only the smooth-rounded ripples. The
internal structure of vertical prisms made it unlikely that these
broad crystalline surfaces would exist within the ice.</p>
<p>In the heat of summer the prismatic layer on the surface of
Blue Lake became greatly eroded, large holes as much as two feet
in depth being formed. Parts of the lake were unsafe to walk on,
the loosened prisms crumbling away under foot.</p>
<p align="center"><small>LARGE CRYSTALS IN
CREVASSES</small><br></p>
<p>Similar crystals to those referred to elsewhere by Mawson,
several inches in diameter, were found in the shafts sunk in the
lakes. These were thin triangular plates, growing from the wall,
to which they were attached, sometimes by a side, sometimes by an
angle. They were regularly striated in lines parallel to one
side. Some were twinned, two series of striæ meeting in the
centre of a symmetrical plate. Designs were built up by the
growth of new crystals from the free edges of others, or even
from angles.</p>
<p>Ice-flowers occurred on freshwater ice at Clear Lake and Blue
Lake. They were on the ice rapidly and tranquilly formed in the
trenches sunk for the observation of temperature. They were much
smaller than those on the sea-ice, being only half an inch or
less in diameter.</p>
<p>In the height of summer the combined action of the sun and air
on compacted snowdrifts caused deep erosion of the snow. A kind
of stratification resulted which appeared to have no relation to
any original stratification of the snow. Thin flat layers of ice
were formed, separated by cavities. These dipped at a gentle
angle to the south, that is to say, their edges were directed
towards the sun at the time of day when it is highest. These ice
plates were so fragile that they collapsed in multitudes as we
walked over the drifts, and a slight breeze whirled quantities of
them along, often rolling on their edges.</p>
<p align="center"><small>TEMPERATURES OF LAKE-ICE</small><br></p>
<p>During the winter a series of shafts were cut through the ice
of most of the lakes, in order to observe the temperature at
different depths. The first trenches at Clear Lake were the work
of the whole scientific staff. After that the entire work
devolved upon Priestley till the end of winter. Then Brocklehurst
cut one in Blue Lake which proved the deepest of all reaching
water at 21 ft.</p>

<p align="center"><small>125. ICE CRYSTALS (The Reproduction of
the Compass on the<br>

<p>A single series of observations at each shaft was of but
little value, especially as the admission of air to the exposed
surfaces caused very rapid changes. One shaft at Blue Lake, in
which we had come on solid bottom at a depth of 15 ft., was kept
open for five months, from July to December. Here periodic
readings were taken, in order to watch the rate at which the
temperature at different depths changed in correspondence with
the air temperatures. After some experience the shaft was covered
with sacking to prevent it filling up with snow. This would also
reduce the circulation of air.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="dia07" id="dia07"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202761h-images/dia07.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>D07. TEMPERATURES OF ICE OF BLUE
LAKE</small></p>
<p>On the first day, when the shaft was sunk to a depth of 5 ft.,
there was a difference of 23° between the surface (minus 21.0°
F.) and the bottom (plus 2.0° F.). When the bottom at 15 ft. was
reached a week later the whole range from top to bottom was 26°
(top, minus 6.0°; bottom, plus 20.0°).</p>
<p>On account of the high temperatures at the bottom we found
these shafts very comfortable places to work in, and could lie
down to partake of lunch, on a luxurious couch made of ice chips,
in perfect comfort, when the air was down between minus 30.0° and
minus 40.0°.</p>
<p>Series of temperatures were taken at every 2 ft. in depth
daily for a about a fortnight. Afterwards a series was taken once
a month, as we had not time to read them oftener.</p>
<p>In the diagram are shown the curves of temperature for six
months, at one reading per month, compared with the curve of mean
air temperature for the four weeks preceding each reading of the
temperatures of the lake-ice.</p>
<p>The scale of temperature on the left side reads up and down,
from plus 28.0° Fahr. to minus 20.0° Fahr. The time reads from
left to right, in months, July to December. The lowest curve,
drawn thicker, is the mean air temperature. The dotted line is
the surface temperature. The other four lines reading from below
upward, are the temperatures at 4 ft., 8 ft., 12 ft., and 15 ft.
(bottom). The thin zigzag line is the weekly mean of the air
temperatures. The air curve is always much lower. The others
maintain their relative positions pretty steadily, except the
surface curve, which fluctuates, mid becomes highest of all in
December.</p>
<p>These curves show some points of interest. The similarity and
uniformity of all except the surface curve are remarkable. We
cannot build much theory on such curves, as the curves of
ice-temperature represent single observations in each month,
while the air curve is a real mean deduced from twenty-eight
daily means. Still the similar course traced by each curve cannot
be entirely chance. If there were no direct relation between the
air curve and the others we would expect greater differences at
different depths.</p>
<p>The monthly mean is selected as giving the nearest estimate as
to the rate at which the temperatures within the ice follow the
air temperatures. The daily mean of air temperature would not be
expected to correspond at all with the slower changes within the
ice, but the curve was drawn, and fluctuated extremely. Then the
mean for a week before each observation was taken, also the
weekly means for the entire period, and they showed no obvious
relation to the ice-temperatures. Even with the means for a
fortnight before each monthly series the correspondence is far
from close.</p>
<p>When the curve of the monthly means is drawn beside the others
it is at once evident that it takes a place in the series, but
that its range is much greater. All the curves converge steadily
after August, and approximate very closely in November and
December.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-27" id="ch-27"></a>IV.3: MINERALOGY AND
CHEMISTRY</h3>
<h4><small>NOTES BY</small> DOUGLAS MAWSON, B.Sc., B.E.</h4>
<p>A large variety of minerals, chiefly rock-forming types, were
met with by the expedition. The minerals included felspar,
pyroxenes, amphiboles, micas, garnet, &amp;c. Among the most
notable features was the occurrence of idiomorphic felspar
crystals a couple of inches in length, found abundantly scattered
about the old crater of Erebus. These had apparently been
expelled by the explosive force of steam from the molten lava in
which they occurred.</p>
<p>Epidote, actinolite, tourmaline and calcite in the form of
marble, were abundantly developed in the vicinity of Cape
Bernacchi. In the marble cubes of graphite and iron pyrites,
together with some tetrahedra of copper pyrites, were observed.
In a moraine in this vicinity also a boulder of reef quartz
containing iron pyrites was observed. Natrolite was found in
seams in boulders of basic lava in a moraine near Mount Larsen.
Titanium minerals appeared to be abundant in the eruptive rocks
and schists met with between Granite Harbour and Mount
Larsen.</p>
<p>An important occurrence of mirabilite near Cape Barne was
noted by Priestley. This he found in rough masses several pounds
in weight piled up at the northern end of one of the lakes. It is
at a situation some height above the present lake level, but no
doubt owes its origin to salts originally contained in the lake
water. Gypsum was found by Joyce in fissures amongst the kenyte
at the Penguin Rookery, Cape Royds. Mixtures of magnesium and and
sodium sulphates, apparently originally derived from the sea, are
to be found under most of the loose stones in the neighbourhood
of Cape Royds. Sea spray and blown saline snow has no doubt
carried these salts to their present resting-place.</p>

OPTICS</h3>
<h4><small>NOTES BY</small> DOUGLAS MAWSON, B.Sc., B.E.</h4>
<p align="center"><small>MIRAGE.</small><br></p>
<p>Wonderful exhibitions of mirage were of daily occurrence,
especially in the early morning hours. In summer time, travelling
over the sea-ice on the Magnetic Pole journey, it was usually
impossible to make theodolite observations between the hours of 1
a.m. and 6 a.m. on account of the extreme distortion of distant
objects due to mirage effects. This was attributable to the fact
that, at about this hour, a large body of cold dense air descends
from the great plateau of South Victoria Land, flowing down the
glacier valleys and mingling with the warmer air over the
sea-ice. For the same reason the western mountains observed from
Cape Royds, always loomed larger in the early morning. Distant
capes viewed over the open water often appeared to be hung up in
the sky.</p>
<p>The type of illusion known as <i>Fata Morgana</i> was of very
frequent occurrence in the case of distant floating ice rafts;
the warmer stratum of the air in proximity to the sea causing the
slight irregularities on the ice surface to appear as lofty
pinnacles.</p>
<p align="center"><small>RINGS AND CROSSES ROUND THE SUN AND
MOON</small><br></p>
<p>These phenomena, proceeding from the refraction of the light
of the sun and moon, were numerous and varied. Both large and
small rings were observed. Usually only those portions of the
ring appeared which neighboured on the horizontal line through
the sun or moon, normal to the line of sight. Parhelia and
parselene of this kind were of common occurrence.</p>
<p>In summer-time on the plateau we observed the most complicated
and gorgeous phenomena of this kind. These were always best seen
through coloured glasses.</p>
<p>During the winter a fine example of a parselene appeared
between us and Mount Erebus. The image must have been formed
within a mile or two of us.</p>
<p>In winter when the atmosphere was cold, clear and still,
similar rings could be artificially formed near the face by
breathing towards the moon. The moisture in the breath freezes
instantly on leaving the body, and the optical effect is produced
in the cloud of tiny floating ice particles.</p>
<p>Rings, coloured like the rainbow, closely investing the moon,
were of frequent occurrence during the winter night. On one
occasion a magnificent exhibition of this kind appeared as a
series of three coloured rings; that nearest the moon showed the
colours of the first order in Newton's scale; the second and
third rings showed the second and third orders respectively. The
effect was similar to that seen when viewing a uniaxial crystal
in convergent polarised light along the principal axis.</p>
<p align="center"><small>OTHER COLOUR EFFECTS</small><br></p>
<p>At certain periods of the year certain clouds are seen very
brightly coloured. This colouring is strong, and all the colours
of Newton's scale are seen as in the rainbow. This succession of
colours increases in a direction away from the sun. The orders of
colour increase successively with a corresponding reduction in
distinctiveness, until too faint for observation. An isolated
patch of cloud illuminated in this way resembles a fragment of a
mineral like olivine viewed through an analyser under polarised
light. This phenomenon was strongly shown only for the few days
preceding the departure and the arrival of the sun respectively
before and after the winter night.</p>
<p>Especially at the intermediate seasons of the year the advent
and departure of the sun each day was accompanied by prismatic
sunset and sunrise effects. Mount Erebus was often bathed in a
delicate pink light.</p>
<p>Purple lights are apt to be produced on snow surfaces when
obliquely lighted.</p>
<p>Cavities in snow formations appear of a wonderful azure blue
colour. Those in ice, on the other hand, appear bluish-green, or
greenish.</p>
<p align="center"><small>EARTH SHADOWS</small><br></p>
<p>The earth shadows, or dark shadow bands crossing the sky, seen
when the sun is very low on the horizon, were observed in a
variety of forms. Some of these certainly bore a relation to the
relative positions of Mount Erebus and the sun. When on top of
Mount Erebus we remarked the great conical shadow it threw at
sunrise over McMurdo Sound and even as far as the western
mountains. It was noted later on that a relationship existed
between some of the earth shadows seen in the sky from Cape Royds
and this conical shadow of Erebus.</p>
<p>Other forms of the shadows are not so easily explained. On one
occasion when the sun was low on the northern horizon near noon,
just after its return, we observed the sky overhead crossed by
six parallel earth shadow beams, directed from the sun supplying
a Noah's Ark appearance.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>370</u></p>
<h4><a name="ch-29" id="ch-29"></a>IV.5: <small>ADDITIONAL NOTES
BY</small> JAMES MURRAY</h4>
<p>The sun, prime source of all the optical phenomena referred
to, was seen for the last time before the long winter night on
April 27, 1908. One-third of its disc was above the horizon at
noon. It was again seen for the first time on August 17, 1908.
The entire disc was above the horizon, and the bottom edge one
quarter of the diameter from the horizon, so that it could
probably have been seen a day or so earlier if the weather had
been clear. The long night was therefore of 111 days (or less).
It is supposed that the night at latitude 77° 30' considered
astronomically, should be several days longer, and that the sun
was seen later and earlier on account of refraction.</p>
<p>The limits of the long day could not be so readily determined
(by observation) as the sun went behind the mountains. The first
year we had only a small part of the long day, and we supposed
that the sun began to set on February 22, the day the
<i>Nimrod</i> left us. The second year we experienced the entire
long day, from about October 17 to about February 22.</p>
<p>There was perpetual daylight on each side of the long day for
several weeks, and similarly the long night was tempered by very
good twilight during the day for some weeks at the beginning and
end.</p>
<p>Some of the most striking optical phenomena, as the earth
shadows, iridescent clouds, &amp;c., were only exhibited during
the short periods when the sun rose and set each day. Others,
like the prismatic sunrises and sunsets, continued long into the
night.</p>
<p>In addition to the optical effects familiar in polar regions,
such as mock suns and moons, halos and crosses, there were
observed a number of optical phenomena which are not so well
known.</p>
<p>Several of these (the prismatic sunsets and sunrises, the
curved earth-shadows, and the arched ice-blink of the Barrier,
are characterised by their arched form, their upper boundary
being an arc of a great circle.</p>
<p align="center"><small>PRISMATIC SUNRISES AND
SUNSETS</small><br></p>
<p>The phenomenon to which we gave this name consisted in a high
arch, coloured in bands like the solar spectrum, which appeared
in the sky opposite to the sun, before sunrise and after sunset.
It was of daily occurrence in clear weather, during the whole of
the two periods when the sun was rising and setting. Even during
the long night it was common at noon for nearly a month after the
sun had set, and it recommenced a month before the sun
reappeared.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="dia08" id="dia08"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202761h-images/dia08.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>D08. DIAGRAM OF PRISMATIC ARCH, MARCH
13</small></p>
<p>It began instantly when the sun set and got higher as the sun
sank further below the horizon, at least it appeared so, perhaps
through the arch becoming more distinct as the darkness deepened.
Some low arches which were measured were 25° and 30° above the
horizon, and it was estimated that at its highest the arch
reached to 45°. Round the horizon it extended for about 90° or
more.</p>
<p>The accompanying figure gives an idea of its size and of the
breadth of the bands of colour.</p>
<p>Though the rainbow colours are unmistakable, the bands are
very delicate, and their limits, as well as the boundary of the
whole arch, are very obscure, though the latter is clearly a
circular arc. The number of colours which can be distinguished by
the eye varies with the distinctness of the display, and with the
height of the arch. In a low arch usually only two bands were
visible, a lower one of slaty blue (greenish quite close to the
horizon), and a higher one of purple. When the arch was high,
other colours could be distinguished. The order of their
arrangement is here given as they appeared, without bias as to
the correct order in a solar spectrum. On March 13, 1908, the
colours noted were (reckoning from the horizon upwards) pale
blue, violet, orange, yellow, fading at the outer edge with pale
greenish blue. On April 7, at 7 a.m., the colours distinguished
were slaty blue, purple, pink, red, orange, yellow,
greenish-blue. No doubt these colours were affected by
atmospheric conditions, and by the colour of clouds in the
background, for the arch could often be seen against clouds.</p>
<p>Apparently the colours were not concentric bands, but those
near the horizon formed arcs of larger circles than the upper
ones. If not so the blue and purple bands would be very small,
but they have really the greatest horizontal extension. Sometimes
the reds and yellows did not appear to form arched bands like the
lower colours, but were limited to an elliptical area, as
indicated by dotted lines in the diagram.</p>
<p>On October 2 the blue zone rose to 15° above the horizon, and
the purple zone to 25°.</p>
<p>In all cases the whole arch, from the summit to the horizon,
was filled with bands of colour, thereby differing from rainbows
and halos.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the appearance of a prismatic arch,
opposite to the sun there were frequently to be seen, over the
sun's position, brilliant sunset colours, which also formed an
arch in which the colours were in inverse order to those of the
prismatic arch, ranging from orange at the horizon, through
yellow and green to blue. The bands were less distinct than in
the prismatic arch, but the colours were much brighter. The
prismatic arch often occurred without this complementary display
being visible. Though not confined to the Antarctic region this
phenomenon appears to be exceptionally distinct and frequent
there.</p>
<p align="center"><small>ICE-BLINK</small><br></p>
<p>The ice-blink of the Great Barrier, viewed from some little
distance, was always in the form of a low arch. On January 27 and
28, 1908, we coasted the Barrier all day long, but out of sight
of it. All the time the arched ice-blink accompanied us,
unvarying except in height as we receded or approached, and
apparently always bounded by a true circular arc. When close in
to the Barrier the white glare seemed to penetrate to a very
limited distance through the air, which was unaffected at a
higher level.</p>
<p align="center"><small>MOCK SUNS AND MOONS,
&amp;C.</small><br></p>
<p>No illustrations are available of the more complicated
displays of this kind observed on the western plateau. There are
some sketches of the simpler occurrences witnessed at Cape Royds.
Most commonly there were simply two bright patches equidistant on
each side of the sun or moon. These were not round mock suns and
moons, as frequently reported in the arctic regions, but were
bits of a ring concentric with the sun or moon. Less frequently a
similar patch was visible right over the sun or moon. Generally
the ring connecting these patches could not be seen, but
occasionally it was visible, and on June 12 there was a complete
ring round the moon, accompanied by the three bright patches, and
the lower part of the ring was between the observers and Mount
Erebus. All these parts, which are associated alike with sun and
moon, are shown in the figure. There is an additional vertical
beam shown.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D09. LUNAR HALO, BRIGHT PATCHES AND
BEAM, JUNE 12</small></p>
<p>After the lateral sun-dogs the commonest phenomenon was this
vertical beam of light, which rose from the sun or moon, and
passed beyond the ring, if one were present. In the case of the
sun the beam of light was yellow, that from the moon was often
decidedly red. It could not readily be seen when the whole disc
was in sight, but often the yellow beam was seen rising from
behind a hill, the sun itself being entirely hidden. It could
never be traced below the sun or moon, and we have no notes of a
horizontal beam of the same kind.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D10. INVERTED RINGS ROUND THE SUN,
FEBRUARY 7, 1909</small></p>
<p>A complete halo round the sun or moon was usually of uniform
brightness, without brighter spots or straight beams.</p>
<p>On February 7, 1909, there were seen portions of convex
towards the sun. The one over the sun was nearly in the zenith,
and more than an eighth part of the circle was visible. The
lateral ones were quite short, and like the ordinary sun-dogs,
but the centres of the circles away from the sun. This display is
here figured.</p>
<p>The iridescent colours of these sun-dogs were not disposed in
broad bands as in the rainbow, but in a succession of minute
coloured streaks, each repeating all the colours, and concentric
with the whole ring.</p>
<p align="center"><small>RAINBOW</small><br></p>
<p>On December 22 the only rainbow was seen, that is to say there
was a bow in the sky opposite to the sun, and rather less than a
semicircle. It was visible from 10.30 p.m. to near midnight, and
was therefore approximately in the north. It was like a moon
rainbow in the faintness of the colours. It looked simply like a
lighter streak amid the slight haze which prevailed. Some of
those who saw it could distinguish a faint red band on the outer
side of the bow, others could only distinguish a pale yellow and
a paler green towards the outside. There was a deep band on the
inside, of pale bluish or purple. It appeared quite near, coming
down in front of hills which were less than a quarter of a mile
away. The essential difference between such a bow as this, and
the prismatic arch seen at sunrise and sunset, is that it is a
band of narrow limits, while the spectrum of the other extends
from the top of the arch down to the horizon.</p>
<p align="center"><small>IRIDESCENT CLOUDS</small><br></p>
<p>The sketch is intended to show the bands of colour (vivid
purple, orange, green, &amp;c.) on the margins of the cloud, and
the central patch. Each cloud has a broad central tract of deep
clear blue, which looks exactly like a bit of ordinary blue sky,
seen through a gap in the cloud. A great bank of grey stratus
passing behind the wisps of illuminated cloud, proved that there
was no blue sky present.</p>
<p>The colours of the iridescent clouds were brighter than in any
of the other phenomena of the same class, such as the prismatic
sunrises and sunsets. They were brighter than any rainbow and
only to be compared with the spectrum of sunlight shown by a
glass prism.</p>

<p>The name is that used by Captain Scott, though perhaps their
appearance may be better suggested if they were called aerial
shadows. These shadows appear to be generally from mountain
peaks, but their source is often hidden. They most commonly take
the form of straight bands projected from the mountain into the
clear atmosphere (their visibility in which may be associated
with the presence of invisible particles of ice). These bands are
in the beginning sufficiently darker than the sky to be called
shadows, but they fade out upwards till there remains merely a
fine line which cannot be called either lighter or darker than
the sky.</p>

<p>The figure shows one of the first of these shadows noticed on
the western mountains, April 12, 1908. Two bands rose up at
different angles. As the sun went round the band on the left
became more nearly horizontal, the other went steeper, keeping
the same relation to one another. The line on the left could be
traced without interruption to the summit of Erebus as shown in

on the left was curved, but the fact was not remarked upon at the

<p align="center"><small>SHADOWS FROM MOUNT
EREBUS</small><br></p>
<p>The most remarkable "shadows" were those from Erebus. As early
as April 12, 1908, we noticed that the two shadows rising from
Mount Lister joined the ordinary shadow of Erebus cast upon the
foothills of Lister. There was at that time no suggestion made as
to the nature of these shadows, and it was not till later
detected that some of them were not straight.</p>
<p>On September 2 the curious curved "shadow" was first noticed,
and was afterwards observed frequently.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D15. EARTH SHADOWS, SEPTEMBER

<p>To illustrate this remarkable "shadow" it is necessary to make
a diagram in which perspective is everywhere violated. When
looking at the shadow on Mount Lister, Erebus was almost behind
us, and the whole curve could only be seen by turning the
head.</p>
<p>In the picture both mountains are shown, Erebus on the left,
Lister on the right. The shadow of Erebus falls up on Lister, and
the curved line joins them, broadening out near each end. In the
foreground is outlined Flagstaff Point, Cape Royds, near which
the observer stood.</p>

<p>While the broad ends of these curved "shadows" are appreciably
darker than the sky, the central portion is different. It is an
exceedingly fine line, neither lighter nor darker than the sky
above and below, yet perfectly well defined. In some instances
the darker ends have a bright line outside, and a blue zone
inside, which broadens at the ends. Usually the observer was in
the shadow of Erebus when these effects were seen, but similar
shadows could be detected from the outside, as on September 29,
when a curved shadow crossed the Ferrar Glacier, low down, the
sun being in the south-east. On the same day the curved shadow
from Erebus was measured, 30° above the horizon (to the north).
On this occasion it did not reach to the mountains, but ended on
the sea ice.</p>
<p>The two previous figures show shadows from Erebus. The
following one shows three peaks of the western mountains, with
shadows projected from them, the sun being behind them.</p>
<p>Almost as puzzling as the curved "shadows" are those instances
when several of the shadows diverge from one point as shown in
the figure below. On this occasion the sun was behind the
observer.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-30" id="ch-30"></a>IV.6: MAGNETIC
OBSERVATIONS<br>
THE MAGNETIC POLE AND THE AURORA</h3>
<h4><small>NOTES BY</small> DOUGLAS MAWSON, B.Sc., B.E.</h4>
<p>There are two* localities where the lines of magnetic force
stand perpendicular to the earth's surface. One of these is
situated in the Northern Hemisphere to the north-west of Hudson
Bay and is called the North Magnetic Pole; the other, in the
Southern Hemisphere, in the northern part of South Victoria Land,
is known as the South Magnetic Pole.</p>
<p class="foot">[* Observations of dip in the Northern Hemisphere
indicate the existence of two magnetic poles of unequal strength.
The stronger of these is regarded as the North Magnetic Pole, the
other is situated in Siberia and is generally referred to as the
Asiatic focus.]</p>
<p>The lines of magnetic force are imaginary lines passing
through any place in the direction along which a freely suspended
magnet will align itself. In the vicinity of the magnetic poles
such a magnet stands vertically and at intermediate positions
assumes an angle intermediate between a vertical and a horizontal
position. The south-seeking end of the magnet dips downwards and
is attracted towards the South Magnetic Pole in the Southern
Hemisphere, whilst in the Northern Hemisphere it is the
north-seeking end of the magnet which dips.</p>
<p>Magnets mounted as compasses are balanced on a vertical pivot
and consequently they are free to swing in a horizontal circle
only. They are controlled by the horizontal components of the
earth's magnetic force at the spot where any observations is made
and consequently, if used at the magnetic poles, where the whole
of the magnetic force is vertical, they are unaffected and
useless. The dip circle is the instrument used for measuring the
vertical component of magnetic force, and consequently it is a
very important instrument in the polar regions. It consists of a
magnetised needle swinging on a horizontal axis, and the readings
are taken in degrees from the vertical.</p>
<p>The magnetic poles, or ends of the magnetic axis of the earth,
do not bear any necessary relation to the geographical poles,
which are the extremities of the rotation axis of the earth. They
are not diametral, but are unsymmetrically placed. In this
connection one authority says: "In natural magnets the points at
which attraction takes place, otherwise called poles, are
generally unsymmetrically placed and depend entirely on the
internal structure of the magnet as well as on the irregularities
of its surface."</p>
<p>The magnetic poles are not fixed spots but are constantly
travelling onward, executing an unknown path and apparently
completing a cycle in a period of many hundreds of years. Besides
this onward movement of a few miles per year, there is a lesser
daily oscillation. The North Magnetic Pole was reached in 1831 by
Sir James Clark Ross, who afterwards visited the Antarctic in the
hope of securing the double event, but he was successful only in
locating the South Magnetic Pole by observations made on his ship
at a distance. In the interval between 1841, when these
observations were made, and 1902, when the <i>Discovery</i>
expedition again located the South Magnetic Pole, it had moved
about two hundred geographical miles to the eastward.</p>
<p>Observations of magnetic declination and dip were taken at
intervals along the route to the South Magnetic Pole. Those taken
on the coast, when compared with values determined by the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition, indicate that the magnetic pole has,
in the interval, moved in a northerly and westerly direction.
This fact was further ascertained by actually sledging inland
from the Drygalski Barrier, following as nearly as possible the
magnetic meridian, until the dip readings showed approximate
verticality. Here the flag was hoisted. The determination of the
exact centre of the magnetic polar area could not be made on the
spot, as it would involve a large number of readings taken at
positions surrounding the Pole. The execution of such
observations under conditions of such low temperature and
prevalent high winds is a matter of very great difficulty, and
when it is borne in mind that many days would be necessary for
the operations, the impossibility of such a course for
sledging-parties such as ours is obvious.</p>
<p align="center"><small>THE AURORA AUSTRALIS</small><br></p>
<p>The aurora was first observed during the evening of March 26,
1908. Earlier in the season the daylight overpowered the light of
the aurora, and therefore observations were not possible. After
October 4, 1908, likewise, observations were not possible on
account of the continuous daylight. Nevertheless, the aurora was
probably in the heavens during the summer-time, as observations
made by the ship's party in lower latitudes showed. As the
<i>Nimrod</i> travelled north into regions where dark nights
prevailed, auroral displays were observed both in the latter part
of February 1908 and early in March 1909. Between the dates of
March 26 and October 4 scarcely twenty-four hours passed without
some display. At times the auroral lights were present in the
heavens for many days together, though of course at full moon the
brilliancy of the light obscured the more delicate auroral
effects. Certain hours of the day were attended by greater
displays than others. About half-past seven in the evening a
brilliant display was to be expected and this continued with
little reduction in intensity throughout the evening hours. The
effect increased in brilliancy at about four o'clock in the
morning, and died away towards 7 a.m. At one period of the year
we experienced bright auroræ frequently about three o'clock in
the afternoon. Very little colour was observed in connection with
these auroræ other than the usual yellowish-green tints, but at
some times the luminosity showed yellower than at others. In some
of the most brilliant displays the curtains were bordered below
by a narrow zone of deep crimson colour. The displays were
usually in the form of arches, which showed minor convolutions
and appeared as beautifully draped curtains. These were sharply
defined below but merged insensibly into the heavens above; their
depth appears to have been many thousands of feet. Besides the
curtain auroræ, diffused nebulous lights were frequently
observed, often in connection with clouds. On still cold evenings
a faintly luminous mist enveloped Ross Island, and this seemed to
have some connection with the nebulous auroræ. In fact, very
early in the winter a nebulous type of aurora was seen on one
occasion to descend between us and the slopes of Erebus,
apparently only about five or six thousand feet in height above
us.</p>
<p>When at their greatest brilliancy the displays were powerful
enough to throw shadows but were yet insufficiently strong to
allow of their being photographed. We obtained impressions on
photographic plates after about ten minutes' exposure, but as the
curtains had altered their shape during the interval, the result
was of little value. With regard to the curtain auroræ, when once
outlined in the sky they experienced spasmodic kindling, the
waves of light travelling usually in one definite direction. This
has the effect of producing to the eye the appearance of ripples
of luminescence traversing the curtain at a very rapid rate. The
curtains, as a whole, slowly drift in a determined direction,
generally towards the magnetic pole. The displays, however, were
very seldom observed in that part of the heavens situated towards
the magnetic pole; they usually appeared in the north, through
east to south. The arches sometimes travelled towards us from the
south-east. Observations of electric potential showed nothing
remarkable during displays of the aurora.</p>
<p>I am informed by the Chief of the Telegraph Department of
South Australia that during September 12, 1908, the telegraph
lines, both north and south and east and west across Australia,
were much affected by earth currents. At the same time we
experienced considerable auroral displays. Since then, on May 14
and 15, 1909, the same authority reports further disturbed earth
currents, and it is interesting to note that brilliant auroral
displays were observed in the Southern Indian Ocean by a passing
steamer.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-31" id="ch-31"></a>IV.7: NOTES ON THE AURORA
AUSTRALIS</h3>
<h4><small>BY</small> JAMES MURRAY</h4>
<p>The different forms exhibited by the aurora could be much
better understood from a few pictures than from much description.
To depict the delicate and evanescent beams of auroral light by
harsh black lines is very unsatisfactory, but as some
illustration is desirable, these sketches attempt to give the
general forms. Marston's coloured picture gives a good idea of a
curtain aurora.</p>
<p><small>CURTAIN AURORA</small>.&mdash;At Cape Royds this was by
far the commonest type of aurora. It consists of broad
ribbon-like bands made up of transverse parallel fibres. It hangs
in folds like those assumed by heavy drapery, and looks very like
the fringe of separate threads bordering a curtain. The folds and
convolutions of these curtains are sometimes very complicated, as
shown in the figure.</p>
<p>The picture shows part of a magnificent display of curtain
aurora, which was seen on April 28, 1908. The whole sky was
covered by a series of curtains, from horizon to zenith, with
very little blank space. The curtains were much folded and
convoluted. Similar displays occurred on May 24, and on several
other occasions.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="dia16" id="dia16"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202761h-images/dia16.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>D16. PART OF CURTAIN DISPLAY, APRIL
28</small></p>
<p>Sometimes a single curtain formed a complete band, more or
less folded, which usually encircled the summit of Mount Erebus
at some distance. Such a band is shown in the figure of the
aurora of May 26.</p>
<p>Similar complete rings occurred which did not go behind the
mountain.</p>
<p>Curtains sometimes had the beams separated, or little groups
of beams separated from one another. These were spoken of as
disjointed curtains. Some curtains were not folded at all, but
stretched across the sky as simple bands, which were sometimes
called arches. An entirely different kind of arch could, however,
be distinguished.</p>
<p><small>ARCH AURORA</small>.&mdash;This consists of a series of
bright patches, arranged in a large arc or circle, and of long
tapering beams going upwards from each patch. Examined closely
there is a sharp distinction between the narrow tapering beam,
and the brighter expanded portion. The arch in its typical form
is much less common than the curtain. The rays are often seen
coming from beyond the horizon, or from behind hills, while the
basal arc is hidden. Similar beams often rise far apart, but
still apparently radiating from a centre. Others are unconnected,
and incline at various angles. These form a transition to the
searchlight type.</p>

26</small></p>
<p>The figure shows a typical arch, with a bright curtain beneath
it, witnessed on June 19, 1908.</p>
<p><small>SEARCHLIGHT AURORA</small>.&mdash;Long bright expanding
beams suggest a resemblance to searchlights, not only by their
form, but by the rapidity of their movements. They swing about in
the same manner, and shoot out suddenly from the horizon or from
a patch of nebulous aurora, and as suddenly disappear. They often
accompany other forms of aurora. Some searchlight beams are shown
in the figure of the very peculiar aurora of May 23, 1908.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D18. ARCH AND CURTAIN, JUNE
19</small></p>
<p><small>NEBULOUS AURORA</small>.&mdash;A nebulous auroral haze
is constantly associated with clouds, occurring on the upper
surface and showing at the edges. Sometimes the nebulous light
accompanied haze so thin that it would not be seen without the
illumination, and in such cases it might be seen drifting along
with the wind.</p>
<p><small>OTHER AURORÆ</small>.&mdash;All the definite types of
auroræ readily change into other types. Curtains lose their form
and become nebulous; the hazy border of a cloud gives out beams
like an arch or searchlights; any type will suddenly concentrate
into a single beam or into a shapeless patch. Some auroræ
occurred which could not be classed with any of the types
recognised, but they were not common enough to get special names.
Two of the most striking auroræ are figured.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="dia19" id="dia19"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202761h-images/dia19.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>D19. GREAT BEAM OF LIGHT, MAY 23,
1908</small></p>
<p>On May 23 at 11 a.m. a great broad beam of light appeared from
behind a stratus cloud in the west from Cape Royds, and grew
upwards till it reached the zenith. It was at first accompanied
by some searchlight beams (shown inclined to the right) which
soon disappeared. The broad beam illuminated some strips of
cirrus in its path, which were scarcely visible to right and left
of it.</p>
<p>It swung slowly down to the left, the lower end keeping in the
same apparent position, till it made an angle of forty-five
degrees with the horizon, when it faded. The whole display lasted
twenty minutes. The dotted line in the figure shows the last
position of the beam. It differed from the ordinary searchlights
in the great breadth and parallel sides of the beam as well as in
its steady motion.</p>
<p>This was one of the few auroræ somewhat in the direction of
the Magnetic Pole, but it did not appear to be very distant, to
judge from its illumination of cirrus clouds at a great
height.</p>

"1202761h-images/dia20.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>D20. AURORA ON AUGUST 31</small></p>
<p>On August 31 was seen the aurora figured below. Almost in the
zenith there was a large tract of sigmoid shape. From near this
there diverged very long faint streamers over the whole quarter
of the sky from east to north. Though pretty close together the
streamers were not joined as in a curtain, and were of unequal
lengths. On several other occasions similar displays, converging
on bright tracts in the zenith were seen, which approached the
corona type of aurora, as figured by Peters.</p>
<p><small>MOVEMENTS OF AURORA</small>.&mdash;Is there any general
direction in which auroræ move, or in which the shimmer or
kindling passes along the curtains, &amp;c.? Some notes bearing
on the question are available.</p>
<p>Those auroræ associated with clouds must travel simply with
the wind. Auroræ not connected with clouds may have their motions
determined by other causes.</p>
<p><i>May</i> 24.&mdash;An even arch appeared, trending from
north-west to south-east, about 30° above the south-west horizon.
The arch travelled towards the north-east till it reached the
zenith, and passed 20° beyond it. One end now rested on Mount
Erebus, when the motion ceased and the arch faded. The motion was
slow and intermittent.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 30[3?].&mdash;A disjointed curtain over the summit
of Erebus travelled southward, and at length concentrated in one
reddish beam.</p>
<p><i>June</i> 4, 8.30 p.m.&mdash;An auroral glow appeared in the
west. A curtain grew east from it to Erebus. A vivid green
shimmer passed slowly along from west to east, and faded just
over Erebus.</p>
<p>Earlier on the same day Professor David reported an arch
trending from north to south, and a shimmer passing along it from
north to south.</p>
<p><i>August</i> 26, 6.15 p.m.&mdash;A typical curtain low down
over Erebus, its ends bearing north-east and south-east. Waves of
brighter light passed along it from north to south.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-32" id="ch-32"></a>IV.8: TIDES AND CURRENTS</h3>
<h4><small>BY</small> JAMES MURRAY</h4>
<p>The coastline, always encumbered by the ice-foot, would render
littoral tide observations in Antarctica difficult or impossible.
Fortunately the fast ice, filling all confined waters during the
winter and spring months, gives a unique opportunity for such
observations, impossible in open waters. The ice-surface affords
a platform on which to erect any tide-observing instrument,
which, while rising and falling freely with the tides or other
dishevelling agencies, is undisturbed by any lateral movements.
By the combined efforts of most of the scientific staff, and the
skilful hands of our engineer. Day, a form of tide-recording
instrument was devised and made. It was set up on the ice of
Backdoor Bay, about one hundred yards from shore, by Dr. Mackay
and Professor David.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D23. TRACING OF TIDE RECORD FROM JULY 20
TO 27, 1908</small></p>
<p>The recording part of the instrument was a modified barograph.
A box weighted with stones was put down through a hole in the ice
as an anchor. The wire from this anchor was taken over a pulley
hung from a tripod of bamboo poles. It was then attached to one
end of a long lever of bamboo, which was weighed to keep the wire
taut. By the arrangement of the lever the record of the tide
movement was reduced to one twentieth and thus brought within the
limits of the barograph drum. The parts above the ice are shown
in the photograph. The wire in passing through the ice is
enclosed in a tube which is kept filled with oil, as used for the
same purpose on the <i>Discovery</i> expedition. The instrument
worked well, and a continuous record was got for about three
months interrupted only for half an hour weekly, when the papers
were changed. At the end of that time the wire broke from the box
at the bottom of the sea, and the tripod was blown down during a
severe blizzard. The ice was then so thick that it was found
impossible to cut a hole to put down another anchor.</p>
<p>The tide record obtained on the barograph drum was a simple
undulating curve with one maximum per day, attaining the greatest
amplitude at full and new moon, and diminishing almost to nothing
at the quarters, when shorter waves of less amplitude could be
seen.</p>
<p>When the record was analysed it was resolved into two
undulations, the larger one having the period equal to the lunar
day, the smaller one having a period of half a day. As one
maximum per day of the lesser tide coincides with the maximum of
the greater tide, its effect on the original record is to
increase the apparent amplitude in that phase, while the other
maximum of the lesser tide causes a flattening in the opposite
phase of the greater one.</p>
<p>This figure shows the results of an analysis of the same
portion of tide-record shown in the previous figure. The upper
curve is the larger side, and shows how it diminishes at the
first and third quarters (end of line to the left) and increases
at new and full (to right). The lower curve is the smaller tide,
and it is almost uniform through all phases of the moon, though
it is not always so uniform as in the portion figured.</p>
<p><small>SEICHES</small>.&mdash;The tide record shows what is
known as a "festooning", due to lesser undulations. These are
seen chiefly during blizzards, but they are known to occur also
in calms. The small scale on which the record is made prevents
any analysis of these undulations, but they were more clearly
seen on the first tide-measuring instrument which we used. Before
the recording tide-gauge was devised Dr. Mackay built an
instrument for measuring tides. In this there was simply a weight
sliding on an inclined plane which was marked as a scale. A
pencil working in a straight line gave the amount of the tides,
but to get the time of the different phases it had to be observed
at regular intervals. It was noticed that over and above the
steady rise and fall of the tide, the weight was constantly
rising and falling at intervals of one or a few minutes, and
sometimes to the extent of four inches or more.</p>
<p>It would have been possible to plot a detailed curve of these
oscillations by observing at intervals of half or quarter
minutes, but the cold was too great to permit uncovering the
hands to record the observations. These oscillations are
considered to be of the nature of seiche waves. Seiche was the
name given to certain free oscillations of enclosed bodies of
water, first observed in Swiss lakes by Professor Forel. Whatever
the origin of the inequalities of level which must precede the
oscillation, that continues as a seiche, diminishing till a state
of rest is again reached.</p>
<p>The period of the seiche (<i>i.e.</i>, the time between the
recurrences of the same phase of the oscillation) has a definite
relation to the dimensions of the body of water. Seiches are best
observed in enclosed basins of water, where they are not
interfered with by tides, but oscillations of the same nature are
of frequent occurrence in deep bays on the sea coast. These may
be set up by the ordinary lunar tides, but the recurring tidal
waves may often obscure them. The seiches at Cape Royds might
originate in this way. The Ross Sea is a deep bay of large size
in which secondary oscillations might be expected, and McMurdo
Sound is a similar bay of small dimensions. The seiches observed,
with periods of only a few minutes, and small amplitude, might be
supposed to be readily set up by winds.</p>
<p align="center"><small>CURRENTS IN McMURDO
SOUND</small><br></p>
<p>There were many indications of a permanent current setting
south past Cape Bird towards Cape Royds. About half a mile north
of Cape Royds, at Black Sand Beach, it was by some influence
deflected, and left the land, passing away southward for some
miles. The readings of the current indicator set up near Cape
Royds seem to show that the deflecting influence is another
current coming from the southward.</p>
<p>The first indication of the southward setting current was a
pretty one. On March 16, when the Sound was entirely open and no
large ice was in sight, a strong southerly wind was blowing. This
brought a quantity of fine broken ice with it which drifted along
the shore from Cape Royds northwards, forming a zone about one
hundred yards wide. In the figure the dark shading shows the band
of ice fragments, the small arrows the direction of the wind, and
the long arrow the currents from the north which stopped the
drift of the ice.</p>
<p>At Black Sand Beach the band of ice left the shore and swung
round and went away across the Sound in a direction south of
west. The north edge of the ice band was as clean as if it had
stopped against a solid, while the spindrift flying northward
showed that there was no change in the wind. The line followed by
this band of ice fragments became approximately the limit of the
fast ice later on.</p>
<p>After the permanent ice formed in the Sound, its edge
extending in a line south-west from Black Sand Beach, every gale
cleared the ice out from the sea north of this line. When calm
weather returned, pack-ice and bergs floated down the east side
of the Sound, till they struck the fast ice, when they began to
roll along its edge away south-westward.</p>

<p><small>CURRENT INDICATOR</small>.&mdash;This was devised by
Shackleton, and set up on the ice a short distance off Cape
Royds. It was put in charge of Brocklehurst, who visited it
several times a day when practicable, from June 30 to August 18,
when it was finally out of action. Only the earlier readings are
taken into account, as it is suspected that latterly the vane
beneath the ice became encumbered by the growth of the ice, and
the readings are therefore not so trustworthy.</p>
<p>These readings bring out two things: <i>first</i>, a current
nearly at right angles to that coming from Cape Bird;
<i>secondly</i>, an absence of any indication of tidal influence.
From June 30 to July 25, the current was steadily between north
and west, and most frequently north-west. The arrows show the
amount of variation in the direction.</p>

<h3>V.1: A SUMMARY OF RESULTS</h3>
<h4><small>BY PROFESSOR</small> T. W. EDGEWORTH DAVID, B.A.,
F.R.S.,<br>
<small>AND</small><br>
<small>LIEUTENANT</small> ADAMS, R.N.R.,<br>
<small>METEOROLOGIST TO THE EXPEDITION, 1907-1909</small></h4>
<p><b>SYSTEMATIC</b> meteorological observations were kept on the
voyage of the <i>Nimrod</i>, commencing on January 1, 1908, from
Port Lyttelton down to winter quarters at Cape Royds. These
observations were taken hourly. On the return voyage from Ross
Island to Port Lyttelton observations were taken during every
watch. On the return voyage of the <i>Nimrod</i> from Lyttelton
to Ross Island, on her cruises in the Antarctic, and the return
voyage to Lyttelton, meteorological observations were taken at
intervals of four hours.</p>
<p>At winter quarters, Cape Royds, systematic observations were
taken by one of us (Lieutenant Adams) during the day from March
to October 1908, observations at night being taken by whoever
happened at the time to be night watchman. These observations
were two hourly. From October 1908 till February 1909, the
biologist, J. Murray, who had previous experience of
meteorological work, was in charge of the meteorological
observations and records.</p>
<p>Attempts were made to ascertain the amount of annual snowfall
in the Antarctic in the neighbourhood of Ross Island. This task
was, of course, beset with the same difficulty which the
meteorologists of all other Antarctic expeditions experienced,
viz., that of distinguishing between fresh falling snow and old
snow drifted through the air by blizzards. We did our best to
make this discrimination, but the results can only be set down as
empirical and provisional. Our general conclusion is, that at
Cape Royds the snowfall from February 1908 to February 1909 was
equal to about 9½ in. of rain.</p>
<p>Mackintosh, when on the Southern Supporting-party's
expedition, in charge of Joyce, in January 1909, found as the
result of excavations made at the old Depot A of the
<i>Discovery</i> expedition near Minna Bluff, that the snowfall
there for the past six years had been equal to an annual rainfall
of 7½ in.</p>
<p>During the whole time of our residence in the Antarctic, from
February 1908, till this beginning of March 1909, no rain
whatever fell. The snow usually came with a blizzard. These
blizzards blew from a general southerly direction; at Cape Royds
they were mostly from the south-east. It is clear that the snow
brought by the blizzards is in part drift snow, in part new
falling snow. On several occasions we noticed that, whereas in
the earlier part of the blizzard the snow was largely
redistributed old snow in the form of drift, towards the end of a
blizzard fresh new falling snow would be deposited. As, at the
time of the blizzard, the wind was travelling very rapidly from
the south at the rate of perhaps sixty to seventy miles an hour,
we argued that this new falling snow was probably produced by
moisture carried by the upper currents. The temperature of the
atmosphere invariably increased considerably from the beginning
of a blizzard towards its end. This rise was very marked, for
whereas the initial temperature, at the beginning of a blizzard,
would be perhaps minus 30° Fahr., at the end of a blizzard, after
a lapse of possibly twenty-four to thirty hours, the temperature
would have risen to plus 12° or plus 15° Fahr.</p>
<p>This rise in temperature may have been due to causes of which
the more important are: First, the usual föhn effect, the
temperature of the air being raised through compression as the
air descends from higher levels to lower. This compression effect
ought theoretically to make itself strongly felt at the
atmospheric South Polar vortex. Secondly, the latent heat set
free when aqueous vapour in the atmosphere is passing into the
form of snow which, of course, tends to raise the atmospheric
temperature. It might also be suggested that as the atmospheric
circulation during a blizzard is immensely accelerated, probably
the upper winds under these conditions may transfer relatively
warm air from tropical regions polewards. If this be so, it is
quite possible that some of the snow which falls towards the
close of a blizzard was formed out of the moisture generated in
warmer climates.</p>
<p>The Southern Party specially studied the question of whether
much snow fell far south, and the Northern Party, who went to the
South Magnetic Pole, also paid special attention to this point of
whether the snowfall increased in proportion as one receded from
the South Pole. As the result of the observations of the Southern
Party it was clear that within ninety-seven geographical miles of
the South Pole there were still very strong south-south-east
winds, bringing with them a quantity of snow. During the time the
Southern Party were on the plateau no falls of fresh snow were
observed; but there was nothing to suggest that the annual
snowfall was less than at winter quarters.</p>
<p><small>TEMPERATURE</small>.&mdash;The lowest temperature we
experienced was minus 57° Fahr., near White Island on the Great
Ice Barrier, on August 14, 1908. We may refer to Mr. Murray's
notes for a comparison of the temperatures observed by us and by
other Antarctic expeditions.</p>

<p align="center"><small>131. CLOUD SPIRALS IN UPPER CURRENTS OF
AIR NEAR EREBUS</small></p>
<p><small>WINDS</small>.&mdash;These may be divided into surface
winds and high-level winds.</p>
<p>As regards surface winds, we found in Ross Sea that these were
controlled to a great extent by the presence or absence of ice
over Ross Sea. Once McMurdo Sound and the Ross Sea to the north
of it became firmly frozen over, we found that we enjoyed calmer
weather conditions than we did when the sea was open. Evidently
the presence of a large surface of comparatively warm water at
plus 28° Fahr. acts as a disturbing factor in the local
atmospheric circulation. The surface winds at our winter quarters
were either gentle northerly winds, whose speed seldom exceeded
twelve miles an hour, or gentle winds from the south-south-east
or south-east. If these latter winds become strongly developed
they pass over into a definite blizzard. One of the rarest winds
at Cape Royds was a north-westerly.</p>
<p>On the southern journey it was noted that south-south-east
winds predominated on the surface of the Great Barrier. These
sometimes swing round to between south-south-west and
west-south-west. The Southern Party experienced a violent
south-south-east blizzard at a point just beyond latitude 88°
South. At the furthest point south attained by them, latitude 88°
23', the sastrugi were large and high, and trended from
south-south-east to north-north-west. There was much soft snow on
this part of the plateau at an altitude of over 10,000 ft.</p>
<p>On the journey of the Northern Party to the South Magnetic
Pole it was found that the chief winds on the coast, as well as
on the high plateau, are from south-south-west to west, with
occasional blizzard winds from the south-south-east and
south-east. Both the Northern and Southern Party kept specially
careful records of the direction of the dominant sastrugi. Maps
of these will be published in the Meteorological Memoir. It is
certain that a good deal of the westerly wind experienced by the
Northern Party in their journey along the sea-ice near the coast
was practically a land breeze. It used to spring up soon after
midnight, and keep on blowing pretty freshly until about 10 a.m.
on the following day. It was observed that occasionally in the
neighbourhood of Mount Nansen a breeze would spring up from the
north-east off Ross Sea, carrying dense cumulus clouds
inland.</p>
<p><small>HIGH-LEVEL ATMOSPHERIC CURRENTS</small>.&mdash;On
January 14, 1908, Messrs. Leo. Cotton, Douglas Mawson and T. W.
Edgeworth David were able to get some observations of the
direction and rate of movement and height of the upper wind
current, in latitude 69° 53' South, longitude 179° 47' west. We
estimated that the mean height of the mackerel sky which seemed
to be formed at the base of the anti-trade wind was on this
occasion between 13,000 and 14,000 ft., and we determined that
the rate of movement of the mackerel clouds was about
twenty-miles per hour in a south-easterly direction. This does
not mean necessarily, of course, that the upper wind was not
moving at a still more rapid rate, but the figure may be looked
upon as the minimum speed for that current.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic132" id="pic132"></a><img alt=""
src="1202761h-images/pic132.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>132. DUMB-BELL CLOUD ABOVE
EREBUS</small></p>
<p>At Mount Erebus our winter quarters were situated in an
exceptionally favoured position for observing the upper currents
of the atmosphere. Not only had we the great cone of Erebus to
serve as a graduated scale against which we could read off the
heights of the various air currents as portrayed by the movements
of the clouds belonging to them, but we also had the magnificent
steam column in the mountain itself, which by its swaying from
side to side indicated exactly the direction of movement of the
higher atmosphere. Moreover, during violent eruptions Uke that of
June 14, 1908, the steam column rose to an altitude of over
20,000 ft. above sea-level. Under these circumstances it
penetrated far above the level of a current of air from the pole
northwards, so that its summit came well within the sweep of the
higher wind blowing in a southerly direction, the result being
that the steam-cloud in this region was dragged over powerfully
towards the south-east. On such occasions one usually saw
evidence of two high-level currents, the one coming from a
northerly direction, its under limit being about 15,000 ft. above
sea-level; and the other, or middle current from a southerly
quarter, usually blowing towards the east-north-east, meeting its
upper limit at 15,000 ft. normally while its lower limit was
between 6000 and 7000 ft. above sea-level. While these two
currents were blowing strongly, there would frequently be a
surface current blowing gently from the north. This would bring
up very dense masses of cumulus cloud from off Ross Sea. The
cumulus would drift up to the 6000 or 7000 ft. level on the
north-west slopes of Erebus, and then the tops of the cumulus
would be cut off by the lower edge of the northward flowing
middle current. Wisps of fleecy cloud would be swept along to the
east-north-east torn from the tops of these cumulus clouds by the
middle current. The whole appearance is illustrated in the
accompanying diagram.</p>
<p>It is of especial interest to note the effects of blizzards on
the direction of movement of the high-level currents, as well as
on their altitude. As the result of our ascent of Erebus we
ascertained that the whole of the snowfall lying within the rim
of the second great crater, at an altitude of from 11,500 to over
12,000 ft., is strongly ridged with sastrugi, which trend from
about west-south-west to east-north-east in the direction of the
prevalent middle-air current. The sharp points of these sastrugi
are directed towards the west-south-west, the quarter from which
of course the prevalent wind blows.</p>
<p>Our actual experience of a heavy blizzard, at a level of over
5000 ft. on Erebus, as well as our subsequent observations of the
height to which the blizzard wind extended, showed that during
blizzards the whole atmosphere from sea-level up to at least
11,000 ft. moves, near Cape Royds, from south-east to north-west,
and the speed of movement is from forty up to over sixty miles an
hour. The day that we reached the summit of Erebus, March 10,
1908, we found ourselves at the level of over 13,000 ft. within
the lower limit of the upper wind. Subsequent observations by us
of the point in the steam-cloud over Erebus, where the bend took
place at the junction of the lower limit of this current, with
the top limit of the middle current, showed that after and during
the blizzard the middle-air current, normally blowing from the
west-south-west, is temporarily abolished, being absorbed by the
immense outrushing air stream of the south-east blizzard. We
noticed that usually in winter time, especially when a blizzard
was impending, strong cloud radiants were developed towards the
north-west. These radiants were produced by the apparent
convergence, due to perspective, of long belts of cirro-stratus
clouds; they could be observed swinging round for several hours
from north-west to true north, and even east of north. When this
was the case a blizzard was certain to be impending.
Unfortunately, during a blizzard, the air was generally so thick
with snow that we were unable to see the top of Erebus. At the
end of a blizzard the air current over Erebus became suddenly
reversed, the steam-cloud swinging round from the south to the
north. After a time, following on the conclusion of a blizzard, a
high-level current was seen to be floating the cirrus clouds from
the south-east towards the north-west, and the steam of Erebus
would stream out towards the north-west. We could not account for
this high-level south-easterly current. It looked like a reversal
of the usual upper wind, and it appears to be a fact new to
meteorological science.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D27. THE CURVE OF ATMOSPHERIC
TEMPERATURE FROM<br>
CAPE ROYDS TO SUMMIT OF EREBUS</small></p>
<p>As regards the sequence of events during a blizzard, they
would seem to be as follows: First, there would be gentle
northerly winds at Cape Royds for perhaps one or two days;
temperatures would be low, and it would appear as though the air
flowing south was coming to supply the void which otherwise would
be caused by the contraction of the atmosphere near the pole.
Then would follow two or three days of absolute calm, the
temperature meanwhile continually falling. We may suggest
hypothetically this meant that a great mass of air near the pole
was constantly becoming heavier and denser as the result of the
increasing cold. Sooner or later, perhaps a week after the
northerly wind ceased to blow, this heavy mass of cold air would
seem to force a passage for itself equatorwards. It would
commence rushing out as a south-easterly blizzard, and as soon as
this rapid current was started, and even before it had got to the
latitude of Cape Royds, 77° 32' South, an acceleration of the
upper current above it had already set in. This led to the
curving of the upper current into a direction more or less
parallel to meridians as it rushed in to take the place of the
cold wind escaping from the neighbourhood of the pole. The
increased speed of circulation of the upper current increased the
normal föhn effect at the pole, and this, combined with the more
rapid transfer of warm air from the north to the south by the
medium of the upper current, together with the latent heat from
the snow formed combined to raise the polar atmospheric
temperature, and so temporarily, to make that region a region of
relatively low pressure instead of relatively high, that is,
relatively, as compared with the normal atmospheric pressure
there. As soon, however, as this warming of the polar air had
become general conditions for a blizzard wind ceased, and a
period of calm supervened. At the moment of the cessation of the
wind, conceivably, a species of hydraulic ram effect made itself
felt in the suddenly checked anti-trade wind current above, which
led to the stoppage of that great air stream temporarily, and its
resurging back equatorwards, thus producing a curious high-level
current frequently seen by us after a blizzard in the
neighbourhood of Erebus.</p>
<p>To return from this theoretical digression to observed facts,
an occasional precursor of the cessation of a blizzard was the
veering of the wind from south-east through east-south-east to
east.</p>
<p>That these blizzard winds occasionally blow right across the
Antarctic Circle, and reach the shores of Australasia, is
indicated by the experience of the <i>Nimrod</i>. When she left
Cape Royds on February 23, 1908, she left us in a light
south-easterly wind, the survival of a previous blizzard, and the
following four days it was still blowing a blizzard. Then, after
a partial cessation of the wind for two days more, the blizzard
freshened again on March 1, continuing to blow on March 2. The
<i>Nimrod</i> experienced these south-easterly winds all the way
back, from Cape Royds to Port Lyttelton in New Zealand, arriving
at the latter port within twelve and a half days after she left
Cape Royds.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D28. DIAGRAM SHOWING DAILY MEANS OF
BAROMETRIC PRESSURE, WIND AND AIR TEMPERATURE</small></p>
<p>It is, of course, premature as yet to generalise on the result
of these observations. It is hoped that when the Meteorological
Memoir is completed that the observations, especially on the
movements of the higher atmosphere, will contribute to our
knowledge of meteorological conditions and the laws which control
them in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p class="pagenum"><u>412</u></p>
<h4><a name="ch-35" id="ch-35"></a>V.2: <small>ADDITIONAL NOTES
BY</small> JAMES MURRAY</h4>
<p>In regard to the relation of barometric pressure and
temperature to wind-storms, the accompanying diagram shows the
curves traced by the daily means of barometric pressure, wind,
and air temperature. The curves are drawn to such scales as will
make them readily comparable.</p>
<p>The uppermost curve is that of the daily means of the
barometric readings, the middle curve is the wind, and the lowest
one is the temperature. The dates are marked at the top, and each
vertical line represents an interval of one day. The period
selected includes the whole of May and June 1908. The scales are
marked vertically at the left-hand side, the barometer in inches
and tenths, the wind in miles per hour (from zero up to 40), the
temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (from plus 20° to minus
20°).</p>
<p>The midwinter period is selected because at that time two
features characteristic of the Antarctic climate are best
developed. The first is the absence of constant and definite
correspondence between barometric movement and wind; the second
is the constant relation of temperature and wind.</p>
<p>It is not meant that wind-storms never accompany or follow
great changes of pressure, but that the relation often fails, and
is not constant and reliable. Severe wind-storms may occur when
the barometer is steady or shows only gentle movements, as in the
first few days of May 1908. On the other hand, and more commonly,
very great rises and falls of the barometer may occur in
comparatively calm weather, as between June 1 and 12, in which
period there was only a few hours of moderately fresh breeze on
the 4th. June 19 to 22 is a more striking example, when a very
rapid rise of barometer occurred, without any decided wind-storm.
But the wind-storms between May 5 and 15 accompanied considerable
fluctuations of the barometer.</p>
<p>The relation of wind and temperature is shown in the
remarkable parallelism of the two curves. A wind-storm is almost
invariably followed by a rise of temperature, as indicated by the
dotted lines. The only exception in the period illustrated is the
moderate storm of May 20 to 21, when there was no appreciable
rise of temperature.</p>
<p>Cold blizzards have been noted. The worst of all was that of
July 25 to 27, when the daily means ranged from minus 22.0° to
minus 29.0°, and as low as minus 35.0° was recorded.</p>
<p>The rise of temperature during a blizzard amounted to as much
as 32° on July 9, and even greater rises have been noted.</p>
<p>The intimate relation between wind and temperature continues
throughout the cold weather, but almost disappears in the summer
months. The relation of wind to barometric pressure (possibly on
account of the proximity of open sea) is also much more regular
in the summer.</p>
<p align="center"><small>ANTARCTIC TEMPERATURES</small><br></p>
<p>The accompanying diagram was drawn while in the south in order
to make a comparison of the temperatures experienced by all the
Antarctic expeditions (of which records, giving monthly means for
a period of one year or more, were available). The results of
plotting the temperature curves were so curious and interesting
that the diagram is here reproduced.</p>
<p>The months read from left to right, and the temperatures, in
degrees Fahrenheit, from above downwards.</p>
<p>The two uppermost curves are Dr. Bruce's records
(<i>Scotia</i> expedition) dot and dash &mdash;.&mdash; = his
first year (1903), dots&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. = his second
year (1904).</p>
<p>The thin plain line = Borschgrevinck's record (1899). (This
curve is taken from Mr. Armytage's book.)</p>
<p>The short dashes -&nbsp;-&nbsp;-&nbsp;- = the <i>Discovery</i>
records for the first year (1902), the long dashes &mdash;
&mdash; &mdash; = the second year (1903).</p>
<p>The thick plain line gives the curve for our expedition which
only covers ten months of the year 1908.</p>
<p>Dr. Bruce's temperatures were recorded much further north than
any of the others and outside the Antarctic Circle. They are much
higher throughout except in the summer months at which season all
the records approximate pretty closely. The remarkable feature in
these two series is the alternating of higher and lower
temperatures in the two years so that the two curves when plotted
together make a regular chain.</p>
<p>Borschgrevinck's curve is much higher than those of the
<i>Discovery</i> except in July and September which were equalled
in the second year of the <i>Discovery</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Discovery</i> curves for the two years show a
peculiarity similar to those of the <i>Scotia</i>. The second
year was colder throughout, till October, after which it was
warmer. The two curves diverge in April, meet in May and June,
diverge in July, meet in August, diverge in September, meet and
cross in October. Though there is only one crossing the chain is
almost as distinct as in the <i>Scotia</i> records.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="dia29" id="dia29"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202761h-images/dia29.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>D29. COMPARISONS OF
TEMPERATURE</small></p>
<p>Our curve for 1908 is first noticeable for the striking
parallelism from March till August, with the <i>Discovery</i>
second year. It lies between the two <i>Discovery</i> curves in
March and April, rises greatly in May and equals
Borschgrevinck's. In June it is well above Borschgrevinck's,
making the least cold June known in Victoria Land. From August to
November it is again the warmest season known in this region.</p>
<p>In all the records for Victoria Land the trough form of the
curves is very noticeable. The summer, as measured by
temperature, is very short: the approximate maximum is maintained
only for two months (December and January), and the curve falls
away steeply and steadily on each side. The temperature falls
rapidly till the approximate winter mean is reached, after which
it fluctuates about this mean for from four to six months, before
the next summer's rise sets in.</p>
<p>The winter mean was reached approximately as early as April in
the second year of the <i>Discovery</i> (1903), and in 1908. In
the <i>Discovery</i> first year (1902) it was reached in May, and
in 1899 (Borschgrevinck) as late as June. The rise began in all
cases in September, except in the second year of the
<i>Discovery</i> (1903), when it was a month later.</p>
<p>In Dr. Bruce's records the summer is longer, lasting for five
or six months, and the winter is much less marked, as far as
temperature goes. The difference between the highest monthly mean
for summer and the lowest for winter is only about 26° (Fahr.).
In 1908 the difference was 47°.</p>
<p>An important characteristic of Antarctica is the cold summers,
with the monthly mean rarely above freezing-point. The diagram
brings out the close approximation (within 10°) of all the means
recorded for December and January, from regions so far apart in
latitude as the wintering stations of the <i>Discovery</i> and
the <i>Scotia</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-36" id="ch-36"></a>V.3: NOTE ON THERMOMETERS FOR
POLAR WORK</h3>
<h4><small>BY</small> JAMES MURRAY</h4>
<p>For work in regions where temperatures below the freezing
point of mercury are to be expected it is customary to trust
entirely to spirit thermometers. We had reason to regret doing
so. Whatever may be their behaviour in temperate climates, in
polar regions the error of the spirit thermometers is apt to
fluctuate in a puzzling and irritating manner, especially in
thermometers which have to be carried about from place to
place.</p>
<p>For example, several thermometers were tested in the sea in
winter, when the temperature was just a small fraction above the
freezing-point of sea water. They showed errors varying from one
or two to many degrees. When tested immediately afterwards in
water from melting freshwater ice, they read quite correctly,
that is to say, they showed errors no greater than those
indicated on the Kew certificates.</p>
<p>To make corrections in the readings only for the certified
error would be most misleading. To attempt to restore the
thermometers by getting the displaced spirit back into the column
before beginning a series of observations was of no avail, as the
thermometers might go wrong at any moment.</p>
<p>The only means of giving the readings of spirit thermometers
any credibility at all was to test them constantly in comparison
with a mercury thermometer, which was itself tested occasionally
in melting fresh-water ice. Fortunately we had half a dozen
mercury thermometers, taken for other than meteorological
purposes. Unfortunately they were only graduated down to zero
(Fahr.). Had the scale gone down to near the freezing-point of
mercury, they might have seized for all our observations.
Whenever a series of temperatures (as in a shaft sunk through the
ice) came partly below and partly above zero (Fahr.), the whole
series was taken with spirit thermometer, but every one above
zero was repeated with a mercury thermometer, and the whole
series corrected in correspondence with its readings. This
practice at least minimised the chance of change in the error of
the spirit thermometer, by allowing the least possible time for
it.</p>
<p>In the meteorological screen a mercury thermometer was hung
beside the spirit one used for the dry-bulb readings. No
variation was ever detected in this one, which was undisturbed.
The maximum and minimum frequently went wrong, and had to be
corrected by observing the position at which they rested when
shaken down.</p>
<p>Greely remarks on the unreliability of spirit thermometers. It
is desirable for polar expeditions to be provided with mercury
thermometers graduated down as low as possible. We have no reason
to believe that our thermometers were not of excellent quality.
The defect is inherent and largely due to climate.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-37" id="ch-37"></a>V.4: CLOUD FORMS</h3>
<h4><small>BY</small> JAMES MURRAY</h4>
<p>Without treating them from the meteorological standpoint, some
notes and sketches of the more striking forms of cloud associated
with Mount Erebus may be of interest.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D31. SPIRAL CLOUD, JULY 23</small></p>
<p>This great isolated cone, standing between the open sea and
the boundless frozen plain, had an immense effect on the
moisture-laden currents of air, and gave rise to remarkable forms
of clouds which we saw nowhere else.</p>
<p><small>THE LAMINATED CLOUD</small>.&mdash;Most characteristic
of all the clouds of Erebus was the great bank of laminated
cloud, resting on one flank or other of the mountain, and
reaching to the summit and above it, often to the height of many
thousands of feet. The familiar shape of this cloud was given
when two gentle currents of air going in opposite directions, met
at some height above the crater. The lower current carried the
cloud a little bit one way, then it was carried back in the
opposite direction by the upper current, as shown in the
illustration.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="dia32" id="dia32"></a><img alt="" src=
"1202761h-images/dia32.jpg"></p>
<p align="center"><small>D32. SPIRAL CLOUD, SEPTEMBER
25</small></p>
<p>The disposition of the clouds shown in this sketch is unusual,
as there is a thin stratified band (not the smoke-cloud) trailing
off to the south, while the great bank hangs on the north.
Generally this great cloud rests on the north slope, but
occasionally the position is reversed.</p>
<p><small>SPIRAL CLOUD</small>.&mdash;A modification of the great
cloud-bank, produced by the meeting of very gentle currents,
resulted in the rolling up of the cloud into a spiral form.</p>
<p>On July 23 a spiral was formed from a bank on the south side
of the mountain, as figured below. The upper current on this
occasion was from the south. A similar spiral cloud is figured,

<p>The most remarkable spiral cloud observed was that of
September 25, 1908. The bank of cloud lay on the north flank. The
upper current was from the south, as on July 23. Its action was
so regular that the spiral could be traced for more than a
complete turn.</p>

<p align="center"><small>D37. SAW-EDGED STRATUS AND OTHER
CLOUDS,<br>
OCTOBER 1, 1908</small></p>
<p><small>WHALE-BACK CLOUDS</small>.&mdash;The most striking of
all the cloud forms on Erebus were those to which we gave the
name of whale-backs. They were small patches of cloud, isolated
or two or three together, one over another, with very evenly
rounded upper surfaces, the lower surfaces more indefinite, often
rounded too. A very good development of them occurred on
September 16, 1908. The largest stratified group of them formed
an object like a comet, the others were isolated. This display
went through many changes, slowly and gradually. Two stages are
figured. The first figure shows the clouds at an early stage, in
which they appear imbricated in a characteristic manner, observed
on many other occasions They were then stratified, showing
generally three layers in each group.</p>
<p>At a later stage, shown in the next figure, the whale-backs
were isolated, except the one large comet-like mass.</p>
<p>While usually evenly rounded, the curves were frequently
reversed at the ends, as shown in the lower group in the first
figure.</p>
<p>Whale-backs were usually seen after a blizzard, occasionally
before one. During the blizzard the mountain was generally
hidden, so that we could not tell if they were formed during the
storm.</p>
<p><small>UNDULATE CLOUDS</small>.&mdash;Narrow lines of cloud
were often arranged in regular or irregular undulations. The
first figure shows fairly regular undulations, over the summit of
Erebus, on July 28, 1908. The second figure shows a modification
of this form, in which the wisps of cloud are intricately
interlaced. This occurred on the south side of Erebus, on
September 16, at the same time as well-developed whale-backs on
the north side.</p>
<p>Sometimes, especially after storms, a great variety of clouds
were piled up over and around Erebus, including whale-backs,
cumulus undulate clouds, with perhaps a spiral cloud over
all.</p>
<p>One such accumulation is figured, in which there were,
cumulus, just below the summit, two banks of stratus at different
levels, the upper one with deeply serrated edge, and a spiral
cloud. Over all was a Noah's Ark of cirro-stratus, not figured,
and beyond the influence of Erebus. Saw-edged stratus was seen on
one or two other occasions, but was not common.</p>

<h3>REPORT ON THE HEALTH OF THE EXPEDITION</h3>
<h4><small>BY DR.</small> ERIC MARSHALL, M.R.C.S., L.R.C.P.</h4>
<p><b>THE</b> fact that there was no case of scurvy during the
period of the expedition's residence in the Antarctic may be
attributed to the fact that the utmost care had been taken in
provisioning the expedition with foods of the best quality
obtainable, in that variety which is essential under polar
conditions. Bottled and preserved fruits were used liberally
during the long winter, and when the spring approached and the
preparations for the spring and summer sledging involved an
increasing amount of physical work, the allowance of fresh meat
(penguin, seal and mutton) was increased. When the spring depôt
party started south on September 22, 1908, all the members of the
expedition had been on a liberal allowance of fresh meat for a
month. During the whole winter all the men took daily exercise in
the open air, this routine being interrupted only by the most
severe blizzards. There was no case of sickness.</p>
<p>We found, in the matter of clothing, that heavy-pilot-cloth
garments and furs were not essential provided that windproof
suits were worn, and that the body temperature was maintained by
a full diet. On the southern journey, when the rations had been
reduced to the minimum, and our clothing was worn and torn, so
that it no longer kept out the biting wind, our temperatures were
subnormal. At the end of a long day's march and in the face of a
blizzard wind, when our altitude was about ten thousand feet, our
temperatures were on several occasions reduced to 94° Fahr.,
rising to 97° or 98° after we had eaten a hot though scanty meal.
Frost-bites were more frequent at these times, and it was more
difficult to restore the part attacked.</p>
<p>It is an interesting fact that the members of the expedition
did not suffer from colds during their stay in the Antarctic save
in August 1908, when a bale of new clothing was opened in the
hut, and all the men were at once seized with acute nasal
catarrh. The symptoms were quickly dispelled when we took
exercise in the open, and those who remained in the hut recovered
after two or three days.</p>
<p>On the return of the expedition to New Zealand the
<i>Nimrod</i> laid up for one day at the mouth of Lord's river,
Stewart's Island, and a number of the staff went ashore to bathe
and fish, &amp;c. All who went ashore suffered considerably from
the inflammation caused by the bites of sand flies, yet it was
only those members, who, on arrival at Lyttelton and
Christchurch, New Zealand, who were not immediately seized with
colds.</p>
<p>The expedition was not entirely free from accidents, for on
arrival at the ice in January 1909, A. L. A. Mackintosh was
struck in the right eye by a hook while unloading cargo. The
accident necessitated the immediate removal of the eye. His
recovery was extremely satisfactory, so that on the fourth day he
was able to get about. This, however, prevented him from
remaining with the shore staff, as it was deemed necessary that
he should return to Australia.</p>
<p>During the ascent of Mount Erebus, Brocklehurst, while wearing
ski-boots, was frost-bitten in both feet, eight toes being
affected. Under treatment seven recovered, but the great toe of
the left foot showed no signs of improvement, and ultimately, dry
gangrene having set in, I amputated the last joint a month after
the accident. Recovery was slow owing to the limited amount of
healthy tissue for the posterior anterior flap. The ultimate
result was satisfactory. B. Day, while tobogganing, fractured the
base of the third metatarsal of his right foot. These accidents,
together with a few septic fingers, were all that arose in the
surgical line.</p>
<p>Weights and measurements were taken regularly, but although
sightly on the increase during the winter, did not vary much from
month to month, although one member has now well-marked linear
albicantes on both upper arms as a memento of the adiposea of the
south.</p>
<p>During one time or another all the members of the Southern
Party suffered more or less severely from dysentery. Some of the
pony meat was not wholesome, and as the supply of oil was small,
it was either eaten raw or warmed to about 100° Fahr., with the
result that we were unable to digest it. An acute enteritis
resulted and prostrated us from time to time. At this time we
were almost entirely dependent on the pony meat, the starch food
available being of the scantiest.</p>
<p>A considerable quantity of Easton Syrup tabloids were used on
the plateau and were found of assistance. Only on two or three
occasions did any one suffer from snow-blindness, and on each
occasion the snow goggles provided had not been worn.</p>
<p>The deep amber glasses were a sufficient protection, as they
cut out all the actinic rays, and had a very pleasing tone. A
combined flash red and worked green glass, giving an orange-brown
tone, was also provided. The glasses themselves entirely
eliminate the violet and ultraviolet rays and were an absolute
protection against snow-blindness, but a more complete system of
ventilation in the vulcanised fibre cylinders was required.</p>

<h3>SOUTHERN JOURNEY DISTANCES</h3>
<p><b>THE</b> following table gives detailed information
regarding the distances travelled day by day on the southern
journey. The geographical miles given in the first column cover
the period from November 15, when the party left Depot A, until
January 9, when the furthest south point was reached. The
distances have been taken from the chart after all corrections
have been made, and represent a direct line from camp to
camp.</p>
<p>In the second column will be found the noon latitudes,
calculated from observations taken as opportunity offered. The
observations have been checked by the officers of the Royal
Geographical Society in London.</p>
<p>The last column shows the distances travelled day by day
according to sledge-meter, and these figures of course take into
account all deviations and <i>détours</i>, so often rendered
necessary by the condition of the surface. That the sledge-meter
was reliable is proved by the fact that on the homeward journey
we were able to calculate our positions without taking latitude
observations. We took only one observation during the journey
back to the coast (January 31, noon position 82° 58' South), and
on that occasion the theodolite confirmed the record of the
sledge-meter.</p>
<p>Observations for variation were taken whenever we took a
latitude observation, and the results will be found recorded on
the chart.</p>
<p>The latitude observations noted in this table were taken with
a three-inch theodolite, which was carefully adjusted before the
start for the southern journey. An observation taken on the
return journey, in February, when the position was known from
bearings, showed that the instrument was correct. The
observations were only taken with the theodolite "face left", but
as the instrument was in good adjustment this was sufficient.</p>

<p>On the outward journey the last latitude observation was taken
in latitude 87° 22' South. The remainder of the distance marched
towards the south was calculated by sledge-meter and dead
reckoning. The accuracy of the sledge-meters used was proved by
the fact that on the return journey we were able to pick up the
depôts without taking observations. The "slip" was ascertained by
careful tests before the start of the journey.</p>
<p>The chronometer watches taken were rated before leaving and on
the return, and the error was only eight seconds. All bearing,
angles and azimuths were taken with the theodolite. Variation was
ascertained by means of a compass attached to the theodolite, and
the steering compasses were checked accordingly. At noon each day
the prismatic compasses were placed in the true meridian, and
checked against the theodolite compass and the steering
compasses.</p>
<p>The total distance marched, from October 29 to March 4, as
recorded on the sledge-meters, was 1755 miles, 209 yards statute,
this including relay work and back marches.</p>

<h3>THE <i>NIMROD</i>'S HOMEWARD VOYAGE. IN SEARCH OF DOUBTFUL
ISLANDS</h3>
<p><b>THE</b> homeward voyage of the <i>Nimrod</i>, after the
members of the shore-party had been landed at Port Lyttelton, was
made interesting by a search for some charted islands, the
existence of which was doubtful. J. K. Davis, who had been first
officer, was in command at this time, and he had under him the
members of the ship's staff, all the members of the shore-party
proceeding from New Zealand by the ordinary passenger routes. The
<i>Nimrod</i> went first to Sydney, where the naval authorities
very generously assisted in effecting certain necessary repairs.
The appended report by Captain Davis deals with the voyage from
that point.</p>
<p align="right">"MONTE VIDEO, <i>July</i> 8, 1909.</p>
<p>"Leaving Sydney on May 8, I steered south on the 151st
meridian against moderate southerly winds. On May 12, when the
position was latitude 43° South, longitude 151° East, the wind
came away fresh from the south-east, and as I did not consider
that I was far enough to windward of Macquarie Island to allow me
to stand east in that latitude, I stood west and decided to carry
out your instructions regarding the Royal Company Island if the
wind continued south-easterly. This was a fortunate decision, for
the wind continued from the south and east for four days, so that
on May 17 I was only ninety-seven miles from the position of the
islands as given on the chart. At noon, after ascertaining our
position, I took a sounding in 2430 fathoms. The bottom specimen
was lost through the wire parting while heaving in. On May 18, at
2 p.m., in fine clear weather, we sailed over the position
assigned to the Royal Company Island, with nothing in sight. I
stood east till 4 p.m., and then south, but saw nothing to
indicate the existence of land in the vicinity.</p>
<p>"On May 24, when 190 miles off Macquarie Island, we
encountered a heavy north-west gale, which the vessel weathered
with very little damage, though deeply loaded. This was followed
on the 25th by a heavy gale from the south-west, but at 11.45
p.m. of this day we sighted the island and managed to get to
leeward of it till daylight, when the wind and sea were less
violent. My instructions were to visit Macquarie Island for the
purpose of making zoological and geological collections to
connect those already obtained in the Antarctic with the life and
rocks of Australia and New Zealand, and also of observing whether
any Antarctic birds or penguins migrated there in the winter
months, as they (the penguins particularly) leave the far south
when the sea freezes over in April, and do not return until the
following summer; where they migrate to has so far not been
discovered. We sighted the island on the night of May 26, and
stood off till daylight, when we were soon able to make out its
distinctive features. Approaching from the eastward one is at
once struck by the rugged boldness of the coastline, which rises
sheer out of the water to a height of nearly 1500 ft. in places.
At the south-east extremity there is a reef of dangerous ragged
rocks on which the sea breaks heavily, and as we got nearer we
were able to see that the mountain slopes were green, and to
trace the course of several waterfalls. A wide bay or rather
curve in the coastline forms the southern anchorage called
Lusitania Road; close inshore is a line of rocks, and it is
through a break in these rocks that the landing-place is
reached.</p>
<p>"At 10 a.m. we anchored in eight fathoms about a quarter of a
mile from the shore. From the ship we could see two huts situated
on the lower ground at the foot of the hill. A large rookery of
penguins and some sea elephants appeared the only life visible. A
boat was soon lowered and sent ashore in charge of the chief
officer; the party succeeded in landing through the heavy surf
and the boat was hauled up into a bed of kelp. The men scattered
to collect specimens, &amp;c. They found the slopes of the hills
covered with a long coarse grass. There are no trees or even
shrubs on the island. A small river running down a valley formed
by the hills made the low ground swampy. Of the two huts the
larger was evidently a boiler-house for rendering down the
blubber of the sea elephants, and the smaller was the one in
which the sealers lived while engaged in this work during the
season. Both wore a very neglected and forlorn appearance. The
sea elephant, which is like a big seal and in some cases over
thirty feet long, is an awkward, clumsy animal and apparently
spends most of its time asleep in the long grass near the water.
It has large teeth which somewhat resemble tusks, but although it
appears very fierce is not dangerous. The penguins, of which
there were a great number, were of the King genus, and they keep
up a continuous squeaking. The young birds were just fledged and
were nearly ready to take to the water.</p>
<p>"We remained at anchor here for the night and at daybreak,
which was not till eight o'clock, we steamed along the coast
northwards. There was a fresh north-west wind, and it came down
the hillsides in violent gusts, called by the whalers
'willywaws', raising a sheet of foam on the water. About six
miles up the coast there is a break in the hills at a place
called Green Gorge, which is a wide valley running across the
island. Further on we could make out Nugget Point, from which
extends a reef of rocks for some distance seaward. As we drew
nearer to this point we could make out two huts on the shore and
also the wreck of a vessel high and dry on the beach. Suddenly,
to our surprise, a column of smoke rose from the smaller of the
two huts. As we had heard nothing of any one living on the island
this was extraordinary. Presently with the glass we could make
out the figure of a man standing at the door of the smaller of
the two huts watching our approach. We came to an anchor, and the
boat was lowered and headed for the shore. The man who had been
watching us from the hut now walked down to the beach accompanied
by two little dogs. There was a heavy surf, but our Crusoe-like
friend, after pointing out the best landing-place, walked into
the water and assisted in beaching the boat. Every one at once
wanted to know what he was doing there, was he alone, how long
had he been there, &amp;c., and the following information was
gathered in less time than it takes to write. Mr. W. McKibbon had
arrived at the island last March in a small vessel called the
<i>Jessie Nicoll</i>, belonging to a company that has the lease
of the island for the purposes of obtaining sea elephant and
penguin oil. This vessel brings down a number of men to work on
the island during the short season trying down blubber on shore,
&amp;c. When the previous season was over and the ship filled
with barrels of oil, instead of returning with the other men, our
friend had elected to remain behind on the island for the winter
by himself, and to collect oil for the next season.</p>
<p>"The next day I went ashore myself; we were met by our friend
of the day before who escorted me to his little hut, which was
very warm and comfortable and scrupulously clean. It consisted of
two rooms, both of which had fires; one of them was used as a
workroom and store, the other as a sleeping-place. I learnt, as I
sat in front of a comfortable little fire, that McKibbon was a
native of Carrick-on-Shannon, and had been in the navy for twenty
years; he was a typical sailor, clean-shaven, and despite of his
fifty years of active life was as keen and alert as a boy. 'I
never had an illness in my life', he said when I asked him what
would happen to him if he fell ill. He was nearly as surprised to
see us as we were to see him. 'I thought at first it was the New
Zealand Government lighthouse tender; then when you came closer I
saw you were a wooden vessel and put you down as a surveying
ship.' When he heard that we had just returned from the Antarctic
he told us that he had been in the Arctic in the paddle frigate
<i>Valorus</i>, which vessel took up stores for the expedition
under Nares and Markham.</p>
<p>"We spent four days at Macquarie Island, and obtained a good
collection of specimens. We left the island on May 30, and as
soon as we got from under its lee encountered a fresh westerly
gale with high seas. Running before this we passed over the
charted position of Emerald Island at 8 p.m. on the 31st. It was
a clear night, three days from full moon, and if there had been
even low land in the vicinity we should have seen it. I decided
to stand on, as it was blowing hard, and a high westerly sea made
soundings impracticable. On June 9 we arrived in the vicinity of
the position assigned to the Nimrod Islands, and at 1.15 a.m., in
fine clear weather, passed over this spot with nothing in sight.
The weather here again was much against us, a very high sea, with
fresh westerly wind and squally, and the barometer at 28.20.
After steaming east sixteen miles from the position, it being now
dark, I hove to and attempted to sound. This operation, being
performed in a kind of blizzard by lamplight, with the ship
rolling heavily all the time, was not a great success. We slacked
out 1140 fathoms but obtained no bottom, so hove in again as the
wind was coming away in fierce squalls from the south-west. I
found that we were setting fast to leeward, so decided to
continue our voyage.</p>
<p>"At noon on June 17 we were up by dead reckoning to the
position of Dougherty Island, as given by Captain Dougherty, but
as the weather was overcast could not be sure of our position.
Captain Keates places the island in the same latitude thirty-four
miles further east. I therefore continued eastward on the
parallel over this position (by dead reckoning). As it was now
dark and the weather moderate, I stood back again to the
westward, hoping to get sights at daylight and did so. Good star
observations were confirmed at noon, when the island, according
to Captain Dougherty's position, should have borne west distance
four miles. No land was in sight from the masthead in clear
weather. I stood east again, and at 4 p.m., when darkness was
just setting in, the island according to Captain Keates' position
should have borne east four miles; nothing in sight. At 4.30 we
passed over this position and continued eastward along the
parallel of 59° 21' South, but saw no indication of land. It is
just here that we met with ice during our passage, and I am
inclined to think Dougherty Island has melted. The darkness was
sixteen hours out of the twenty-four; it was, in fact, to quote
from the 'Directory', one long starless desolate night, a
perpetual gloom which the sun seems never to penetrate, and the
conditions made a search of this kind more or less doubtful.
Although I will not say these islands do not exist, I can with
confidence say they do not exist in the locality laid down or
anywhere near it. When in latitude 59° 31' South, longitude 107°
West, we encountered north-easterly winds, which drove us into
61½° South, where we met moderately warm weather and continual
rain. As the sun had only an altitude of 5° at noon there was
almost constant darkness. At 10.45 p.m. on June 27 we sighted the
Diego Ramirez Island right ahead at a distance of fourteen miles.
We made an extremely good landfall, and this satisfied me that
our chronometers, despite the changes of temperature to which
they had been subjected, were reliable. It was a cloudy moonlight
night, and the fact that we saw these islands, or rather rocks,
for the highest point is only 587 ft. above sea-level, so far off
convinces me that if the other islands had existed anywhere near
the localities laid down for them we could not have failed to see
them."</p>
<p>The <i>Nimrod</i> touched at Monte Video and arrived at
Falmouth on August 26. Four days later she was berthed in the
Thames, thus completing the most adventurous cruise of her
eventful career. She had been away from the Thames for nearly
twenty-five months.</p>
