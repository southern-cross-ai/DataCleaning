<p class="caption">Sanford Quest, Criminologist.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="first">The young man from the west had arrived in New York only that
afternoon, and his cousin, town born and bred, had already embarked upon the
task of showing him the great city. They occupied a table in a somewhat
insignificant corner of one of New York&rsquo;s most famous roof-garden
restaurants. The place was crowded with diners. There were many notabilities to
be pointed out. The town young man was very busy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that bunch of girls on the right?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;They
are all from the chorus in the new musical comedy&mdash;opens to-morrow.
They&rsquo;ve been rehearsing every day for a month. Some show it&rsquo;s going
to be, too. I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;ll be able to get you a seat,
but I&rsquo;ll try. I&rsquo;ve had mine for a month. The fair girl who is
leaning back, laughing, now, is Elsie Havers. She&rsquo;s the star&hellip;. You
see the old fellow with the girl, just in a line behind? That&rsquo;s Dudley
Worth, the multi-millionaire, and at the next table there is Mrs.
Atkinson&mdash;you remember her divorce case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all vastly interesting to the young man from the west, and he looked
from table to table with ever-increasing interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s fine to be here!&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;We have
this sort of thing back home, but we are only twelve stories up and there is
nothing to look at. Makes you kind of giddy here to look past the people, down
at the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New Yorker glanced almost indifferently at the one sight which to a
stranger is perhaps the most impressive in the new world. Twenty-five stories
below, the cable cars clanging and clashing their way through the narrowed
streets seemed like little fire-flies, children&rsquo;s toys pulled by an
invisible string of fire. Further afield, the flare of the city painted the
murky sky. The line of the river scintillated with rising and falling stars.
The tall buildings stabbed the blackness, fingers of fire. Here, midway to the
clouds, was another world, a world of luxury, of brilliant toilettes, of light
laughter, the popping of corks, the joy of living, with everywhere the vague
perfume and flavour of femininity.</p>
<p>The young man from the country touched his cousin&rsquo;s arm suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he enquired, &ldquo;who is the man at a table by
himself? The waiters speak to him as though he were a little god. Is he a
millionaire, or a judge, or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New Yorker turned his head. For the first time his own face showed some
signs of interest. His voice dropped a little. He himself was impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in luck, Alfred,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the most interesting man in New York&mdash;one of the most interesting in the
world. That&rsquo;s Sanford Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard of Sanford Quest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man whose privilege it was to have been born and lived all his
days in New York, drank half a glassful of wine and leaned back in his chair.
Words, for a few moments, were an impossibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sanford Quest,&rdquo; he pronounced at last, &ldquo;is the greatest
master in criminology the world has ever known. He is a magician, a scientist,
the Pierpont Morgan of his profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, do you mean that he is a detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The New Yorker steadied himself with an effort. Such ignorance was hard to
realise&mdash;harder still to deal with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said simply, &ldquo;you could call him that&mdash;just
in the same way you could call Napoleon a soldier or Lincoln a statesman. He is
a detective, if you like to call him that, the master detective of the world.
He has a great house in one of the backwater squares of New York, for his
office. He has wireless telegraphy, private chemists, a little troop of spies,
private telegraph and cable, and agents in every city of the world. If he moves
against any gang, they break up. No one can really understand him. Sometimes he
seems to be on the side of the law, sometimes on the side of the criminal. He
takes just what cases he pleases, and a million dollars wouldn&rsquo;t tempt
him to touch one he doesn&rsquo;t care about. Watch him go out. They say that
you can almost tell the lives of the people he passes, from the way they look
at him. There isn&rsquo;t a crook here or in the street who doesn&rsquo;t know
that if Sanford Quest chose, his career would be ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The country cousin was impressed at last. With staring eyes and opened
mouth, he watched the man who had been sitting only a few tables away from them
push back the plate on which lay his bill and rise to his feet. One of the
chief ma&icirc;tres d&rsquo;h&ocirc;tel handed him his straw hat and cane, two
waiters stood behind his chair, the manager hurried forward to see that the way
was clear for him. Yet there was nothing about the appearance of the man
himself which seemed to suggest his demanding any of these things. He was of
little over medium height, broad-shouldered, but with a body somewhat loosely
built. He wore quiet grey clothes with a black tie, a pearl pin, and a neat
coloured shirt. His complexion was a little pale, his features well-defined,
his eyes dark and penetrating but hidden underneath rather bushy eyebrows. His
deportment was quite unassuming, and he left the place as though entirely
ignorant of the impression he created. The little cluster of chorus girls
looked at him almost with awe. Only one of them ventured to laugh into his face
as though anxious to attract his notice. Another dropped her veil significantly
as he drew near. The millionaire seemed to become a smaller man as he glanced
over his shoulder. The lady who had been recently divorced bent over her plate.
A group of noisy young fellows talking together about a Stock Exchange deal,
suddenly ceased their clamour of voices as he passed. A man sitting alone, with
a drawn face, deliberately concealed himself behind a newspaper, and an
aldermanic-looking gentleman who was entertaining a fluffy-haired young lady
from a well-known typewriting office, looked for a moment like an errant
school-boy. Not one of these people did Sanford Quest seem to see. He passed
out to the elevator, tipped the man who sycophantly took him the whole of the
way down without a stop, walked through the crowded hall of the hotel and
entered a closed motor-car without having exchanged greetings with a soul. Yet
there was scarcely a person there who could feel absolutely sure that he had
not been noticed.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Sanford Quest descended, about ten minutes later, before a large and
gloomy-looking house in Georgia Square. The neighbourhood was, in its way,
unique. The roar and hubbub of the city broke like a restless sea only a block
or so away. On every side, this square of dark, silent houses seemed to be
assailed by the clamour of the encroaching city. For some reason or other,
however, it remained a little oasis of old-fashioned buildings, residences,
most of them, of a generation passed away. Sanford Quest entered the house with
a latch-key. He glanced into two of the rooms on the ground-floor, in which
telegraph and telephone operators sat at their instruments. Then, by means of a
small elevator, he ascended to the top story and, using another key, entered a
large apartment wrapped in gloom until, as he crossed the threshold, he touched
the switches of the electric lights. One realised then that this was a man of
taste. The furniture and appointments of the room were of dark oak. The
panelled walls were hung with a few choice engravings. There were books and
papers about, a piano in the corner. A door at the further end led into what
seemed to be a sleeping-apartment. Quest drew up an easy-chair to the
wide-flung window, touching a bell as he crossed the room. In a few moments the
door was opened and closed noiselessly. A young woman entered with a little
bundle of papers in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything for me, Laura?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you will think so, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she
answered calmly.</p>
<p>She drew a small table and a reading lamp to his side and stood quietly
waiting. Her eyes followed Quest&rsquo;s as he glanced through the letters, her
expression matched his. She was tall, dark, good-looking in a massive way, with
a splendid, almost unfeminine strength in her firm, shapely mouth and brilliant
eyes. Her manner was a little brusque but her voice pleasant. She was one of
those who had learnt the art of silence.</p>
<p>The criminologist glanced through the papers quickly and sorted them into
two little heaps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send these,&rdquo; he directed, &ldquo;to the police-station. There
is nothing in them which calls for outside intervention. They are all matters
which had better take their normal course. To the others simply reply that the
matter they refer to does not interest me. No further enquiries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Mr. Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She left the room almost noiselessly. Quest took down a volume from the
swinging book-case by his side, and drew the reading lamp a little closer to
his right shoulder. Before he opened the volume, however, he looked for a few
moments steadfastly out across the sea of roofs, the network of telephone and
telegraph wires, to where the lights of Broadway seemed to eat their way into
the sky. Around him, the night life of the great city spread itself out in
waves of gilded vice and black and sordid crime. Its many voices fell upon deaf
ears. Until long past midnight, he sat engrossed in a scientific volume.</p>
<h2><a name="ch2" id="ch2"></a>II.&mdash;THE APARTMENT-HOUSE MYSTERY</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">&ldquo;This habit of becoming late for breakfast,&rdquo; Lady
Ashleigh remarked, as she set down the coffee-pot, &ldquo;is growing upon your
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ella glanced up from a pile of correspondence through which she had been
looking a little negligently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he comes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I shall tell him what Clyde
says in his new play&mdash;that unpunctuality for breakfast and overpunctuality
for dinner are two of the signs of advancing age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; her mother advised. &ldquo;He hates
anything that sounds like an epigram, and I noticed that he avoided any
allusion to his birthday last month. Any news, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all, mother. My correspondence is just the usual sort of
rubbish&mdash;invitations and gossip. Such a lot of invitations,
by-the-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your age,&rdquo; Lady Ashleigh declared, &ldquo;that is the sort
of correspondence which you should find interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ella shook her head. She was a very beautiful young woman, but her
expression was a little more serious than her twenty-two years warranted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know I am not like that, mother,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I
have found one thing in life which interests me more than all this frivolous
business of amusing oneself. I shall never be happy&mdash;not really
happy&mdash;until I have settled down to study hard. My music is really the
only part of life which absolutely appeals to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Ashleigh sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so unnecessary,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Since Esther was
married you are practically an only daughter, you are quite well off, and there
are so many young men who want to marry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ella laughed gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sort of thing may come later on, mother,&rdquo; she
declared,&mdash;&ldquo;I suppose I am only human like the rest of us&mdash;but
to me the greatest thing in the whole world just now is music, my music. It is
a little wonderful, isn&rsquo;t it, to have a gift, a real gift, and to know
it? Oh, why doesn&rsquo;t Delarey make up his mind and let father know, as he
promised!&hellip; Here comes daddy, mum. Bother! He&rsquo;s going to shoot, and
I hoped he&rsquo;d play golf with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Ashleigh, who had stepped through some French windows at the farther
end of the terrace, paused for a few minutes to look around him. There was
certainly some excuse for his momentary absorption. The morning, although it
was late September, was perfectly fine and warm. The cattle in the park which
surrounded the house were already gathered under the trees. In the far
distance, the stubble fields stretched like patches of gold to ridges of
pine-topped hills, and beyond to the distant sea. The breakfast table at which
his wife and daughter were seated was arranged on the broad grey stone terrace,
and, as he slowly approached, it seemed like an oasis of flowers and fruit and
silver. A footman stood discreetly in the background. Half a dozen dogs of
various breeds came trotting forward to meet him. His wife, still beautiful
notwithstanding her forty-five years, had turned her pleasant face towards him,
and Ella, whom a great many Society papers had singled out as being one of the
most beautiful d&eacute;butantes of the season, was welcoming him with her
usual lazy but wholly good-humoured smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, your habits are getting positively disgraceful!&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;Mother and I have nearly finished&mdash;and our share of the
post-bag is most uninteresting. Please come and sit down, tell us where you are
going to shoot, and whether you&rsquo;ve had any letters this
morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Ashleigh loitered for a moment to raise the covers from the dishes upon
a side table. Afterwards he seated himself in the chair which the servant was
holding for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going out for an hour or two with Fitzgerald,&rdquo; he
announced. &ldquo;Partridges are scarcely worth shooting yet but he has
arranged a few drives over the hills. As for my being late&mdash;well, that has
something to do with you, young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ella looked at him with a sudden seriousness in her great eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Daddy, you&rsquo;ve heard something!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Ashleigh pulled a bundle of letters from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; he admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo; Ella begged. &ldquo;Tell us all about it? Don&rsquo;t
sit there, dad, looking so stolid. Can&rsquo;t you see I am dying to hear?
Quick, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father smiled, glanced for a moment at the plate which had been passed
to him from the side table, approved of it and stretched out his hand for his
cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard this morning,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;from your friend
Delarey. He went into the matter very fully. You shall read his letter
presently. The sum and substance of it all, however, is that for the first year
of your musical training he advises&mdash;where do you think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dresden,&rdquo; Lady Ashleigh suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Munich? Paris?&rdquo; Ella put in breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All wrong,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh declared. &ldquo;New York!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a momentary silence. Ella&rsquo;s eyes were sparkling. Her
mother&rsquo;s face had fallen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New York!&rdquo; Ella murmured. &ldquo;There is wonderful music
there, and Mr. Delarey knows it so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Ashleigh nodded portentously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not finished yet. Mr. Delarey wound up his letter by promising
to cable me his final decision in the course of a few days. This
cablegram,&rdquo; he went on, drawing a little slip of blue paper from his
pocket, &ldquo;was brought to me this morning whilst I was shaving. I found it
a most inconvenient time, as the lather&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother the lather, father!&rdquo; Ella exclaimed. &ldquo;Read the
cablegram, or let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father smoothed it out before him and read&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote"><tt>TO LORD ASHLEIGH, HAMBLIN HOUSE, DORSET, ENGLAND.<br>
I FIND A MAGNIFICENT PROGRAMME ARRANGED FOR AT METROPOLITAN OPERA HOUSE THIS
YEAR. HAVE TAKEN BOX FOR YOUR DAUGHTER, ENGAGED THE BEST PROFESSOR IN THE
WORLD, AND SECURED AN APARTMENT AT THE LEELAND, OUR MOST SELECT AND COMFORTABLE
RESIDENTIAL HOTEL. UNDERSTAND YOUR BROTHER IS STILL IN SOUTH AMERICA, RETURNING
EARLY SPRING, BUT WILL DO OUR BEST TO MAKE YOUR DAUGHTER'S YEAR OF STUDY AS
PLEASANT AS POSSIBLE. ADVISE HER SAIL ON SATURDAY BY MAURETANIA.</tt></p>
<p>&ldquo;On Saturday?&rdquo; Ella almost screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New York!&rdquo; Lady Ashleigh murmured disconsolately. &ldquo;How
impossible, George!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her husband handed over the letter and cablegram, which Ella at once pounced
upon. He then unfolded the local newspaper and proceeded to make an excellent
breakfast. When he had quite finished, he lit a cigarette and rose a little
abruptly to his feet as a car glided out of the stable yard and slowly
approached the front door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;leave you to talk over and
discuss this matter for the rest of the day. I believe you said, dear,&rdquo;
he added, turning to his wife, &ldquo;that we were dining alone
to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite alone, George,&rdquo; Lady Ashleigh admitted. &ldquo;We were to
have gone to Annerley Castle, but the Duke is laid up somewhere in
Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember,&rdquo; her husband assented. &ldquo;Very well, then, at
dinner-time to-night you can tell me your decision, or rather we will discuss
it together. James,&rdquo; he added, turning to the footman, &ldquo;tell Robert
I want my sixteen-bore guns put in the car, and tell him to be very careful
about the cartridges.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared through the French windows. Lady Ashleigh was studying the
letter stretched out before her, her brows a little knitted, her expression
distressed. Ella had turned and was looking out westwards across the park,
towards the sea. For a moment she dreamed of all the wonderful things that lay
on the other side of that silver streak. She saw inside the crowded Opera
House. She felt the tense hush, the thrill of excitement. She heard the low
sobbing of the violins, she saw the stage-setting, she heard the low notes of
music creeping and growing till every pulse in her body thrilled with her one
great enthusiasm. When she turned back to the table, her eyes were bright and
there was a little flush upon her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not sorry, mother?&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not really, dear,&rdquo; Lady Ashleigh answered resignedly.</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">Lord Ashleigh, who in many respects was a typical Englishman
of his class, had a constitutional affection for small ceremonies, an affection
nurtured by his position as Chairman of the County Magistrates and President of
the local Unionist Association. After dinner that evening, a meal which was
served in the smaller library, he cleared his throat and filled his glass with
wine. His manner, as he addressed his wife and daughter, was almost
official.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am to take it, I believe,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that you have
finally decided, Ella, to embrace our friend Delarey&rsquo;s suggestion and to
leave us on Saturday for New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; Ella murmured, with glowing eyes. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t tell you how grateful I am to you both for letting me
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is naturally a wrench to us,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh confessed,
&ldquo;especially as circumstances which you already know of prevent either
your mother or myself from being with you during the first few months of your
stay there. You have very many friends in New York, however, and your mother
tells me that there will be no difficulty about your chaperonage at the various
social functions to which you will, of course, be bidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that will be all right, dad,&rdquo; Ella ventured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will take your own maid with you, of course,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh
continued. &ldquo;Lenora is a good girl and I am sure she will look after you
quite well, but I have decided, although it is a somewhat unusual step, to
supplement Lenora&rsquo;s surveillance over your comfort by sending with you,
also, as a sort of courier and general attendant&mdash;whom do you think? Well,
Macdougal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Ashleigh looked across the table with knitted brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macdougal, George? Why, however will you spare him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can easily,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh declared, &ldquo;find a temporary
butler. Macdougal has lived in New York for some years, and you will doubtless
find this a great advantage, Ella. I hope that my suggestion pleases
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ella glanced over her shoulder at the two servants who were standing
discreetly in the background. Her eyes rested upon the pale, expressionless
face of the man who during the last few years had enjoyed her father&rsquo;s
absolute confidence. Like many others of his class, there seemed to be so
little upon which to comment in his appearance, so little room for surmise or
analysis in his quiet, negative features, his studiously low voice, his
unexceptionable deportment. Yet for a moment a queer sense of apprehension
troubled her. Was it true, she wondered, that she did not like the man? She
banished the thought almost as soon as it was conceived. The very idea was
absurd! His manner towards her had always been perfectly respectful. He seemed
equally devoid of sex or character. She withdrew her gaze and turned once more
towards her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think that you can really spare him, daddy,&rdquo; she asked,
&ldquo;and that it will be necessary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not altogether necessary, I dare say,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh admitted.
&ldquo;On the other hand, I feel sure that you will find him a comfort, and it
would be rather a relief to me to know that there is some one in touch with you
all the time in whom I place absolute confidence. I dare say I shall be very
glad to see him back again at the end of the year, but that is neither here nor
there. Mr. Delarey has sent me the name of some bankers in New York who will
honour your cheques for whatever money you may require.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are spoiling me, daddy,&rdquo; Ella sighed.</p>
<p>Lord Ashleigh smiled. His hand had disappeared into the pocket of his
dinner-coat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think so now,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;I do not know what
you will say to me presently. What I am doing now, Ella, I am doing with your
mother&rsquo;s sanction, and you must associate her with the gift which I am
going to place in your keeping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hand was slowly withdrawn from his pocket. He laid upon the table a very
familiar morocco case, stamped with a coronet. Even before he touched the
spring and the top flew open, Ella knew what was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our diamonds!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The Ashleigh
diamonds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The necklace lay exposed to view, the wonderful stones flashing in the
subdued light. Ella gazed at it, speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In New York,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh continued, &ldquo;it is the custom
to wear jewellery in public more, even, than in this country. The family
pearls, which I myself should have thought more suitable, went, as you know, to
your elder sister upon her marriage. I am not rich enough to invest large sums
of money in the purchase of precious stones, yet, on the other hand, your
mother and I feel that if you are to wear jewels at all, we should like you to
wear something of historic value, jewels which are associated with the history
of your own house. Allow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward. With long, capable fingers he fastened the necklace
around his daughter&rsquo;s neck. It fell upon her bosom, sparkling, a little
circular stream of fire against the background of her smooth, white skin. Ella
could scarcely speak. Her fingers caressed the jewels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our farewell present to you,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh declared.
&ldquo;I need not beg you to take care of them. I do not wish to dwell upon
their value. Money means, naturally, little to you, and when I tell you that a
firm in London offered me sixty thousand pounds for them for an American
client, I only mention it so that you may understand that they are likely to be
appreciated in the country to which you are going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clasped his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you are too good to me! It is all
too wonderful. I shall be afraid to wear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Ashleigh smiled reassuringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will be quite safe. I should
advise you to keep them, as a rule, in the strong box which you will doubtless
find in the hotel to which you are going. But for all ordinary occasions you
need feel, I am convinced, no apprehension. You can understand now, I dare say,
another reason why I am sending Macdougal with you as well as
Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ella, impelled by some curious impulse which she could not quite understand,
glanced quickly around to where the man-servant was standing. For once she had
caught him unawares. For once she saw something besides the perfect automaton.
His eyes, instead of being fixed at the back of his master&rsquo;s chair, were
simply riveted upon the stones. His mouth was a little indrawn. To her there
was a curious change in his expression. His cheekbones seemed to have become
higher. The pupils of his eyes had narrowed. Even while she looked at him, he
moistened a little his dry lips with the tip of his tongue. Then, as though
conscious of her observation, all these things vanished. He advanced to the
table, respectfully refilled his master&rsquo;s glass from the decanter of
port, and retreated again. Ella withdrew her eyes. A queer little feeling of
uneasiness disturbed her for the moment. It passed, however, as in glancing
away her attention was once more attracted by the sparkle of the jewels upon
her bosom. Lord Ashleigh raised his glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our love to you, dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Take care of the
jewels, but take more care of yourself. Your mother and I will come to New York
as soon as we can. In the meantime, don&rsquo;t forget us amidst the hosts of
your new friends and the joy of your new life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave them each a hand. She stooped first to one side and then to the
other, kissing them both tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never forget!&rdquo; she exclaimed, her voice breaking a
little. &ldquo;There could never be any one else in the world like you
two&mdash;and please may I go to the looking-glass?&rdquo;</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<p class="first">The streets of New York were covered with a thin, powdery snow
as the very luxurious car of Mrs. Delarey drew up outside the front of the
Leeland Hotel, a little after midnight. Ella leaned over and kissed her
hostess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear, ever so much for your delightful dinner,&rdquo; she
exclaimed, &ldquo;and for bringing me home. As for the music, well, I
can&rsquo;t talk about it. I am just going upstairs into my room to sit and
think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t sit up too late and spoil your pretty colour,
dear,&rdquo; Mrs. Delarey advised. &ldquo;Good-bye! Don&rsquo;t forget I am
coming in to lunch with you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car rolled off. Ella, a large umbrella held over her head by the
door-keeper, stepped up the little strip of drugget which led into the
softly-warmed hall of the Leeland. Behind her came her maid, Lenora, and
Macdougal, who had been riding on the box with the chauffeur. He paused for a
moment to wipe the snow from his clothes as Ella crossed the hall to the lift.
Lenora turned towards him. He whispered something in her ear. For a moment she
shook. Then she turned away and followed her mistress upstairs.</p>
<p>Arrived in her apartment, Ella threw herself with a little sigh of content
into a big easy-chair before the fire. Her sitting-room was the last word in
comfort and luxury. A great bowl of pink roses, arrived during her absence,
stood on the small table by her side. Lenora had just brought her chocolate and
was busy making preparations in the bedroom adjoining. Ella gave herself up for
a few moments to reverie. The magic of the music was still in her blood. She
had made progress. That very afternoon her master, Van Haydn, had spoken to her
of her progress&mdash;Van Haydn, who had never flattered a pupil in his life.
In a few weeks&rsquo; time her mother and father were coming out to her.
Meanwhile, she had made hosts of pleasant friends. Attentions of all sorts had
been showered upon her. She curled herself up in her chair. It was good to be
alive!</p>
<p>A log stirred upon the fire. She leaned forward lazily to replace it and
then stopped short. Exactly opposite to her was a door which opened on to a
back hall. It was used only by the servants connected with the hotel, and was
usually kept locked. Just as she was in the act of leaning forward, Ella became
conscious of a curious hallucination. She sat looking at the handle with
fascinated eyes. Then she called aloud to Lenora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora, come here at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid hurried in from the next room. Ella pointed to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora, look outside. See if any one is on that landing. I fancied
that the door opened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maid shook her head incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so, my lady,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;No one but
the waiter and the chambermaid who comes in to clean the apartment, ever comes
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crossed the room and tried the handle. Then she turned towards her
mistress in triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is locked, my lady,&rdquo; she reported.</p>
<p>Ella rose to her feet and herself tried the handle. It was as the maid had
reported. She, however, was not altogether reassured. She was a young woman
whose nerves were in a thoroughly healthy state, and by no means given to
imaginative fears. She stood a little away, looking at the handle. It was
almost impossible that she could have been mistaken. Her hands clasped for a
moment the necklace which hung from her neck. A queer presentiment of evil
crept like a grey shadow over her.</p>
<p>She looked at herself in the glass&mdash;the colour had left her cheeks. She
tried to laugh at her self.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is absurd!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Lenora, go down and ask
Macdougal to come up for a minute. I am going to have this thing explained.
Hurry, there&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure your ladyship doesn&rsquo;t mind being left?&rdquo; the
maid asked, a little doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not!&rdquo; Ella replied, with a laugh which was not
altogether natural. &ldquo;Hurry along, there&rsquo;s a good girl. I&rsquo;ll
drink my chocolate while you are gone, and get ready for bed, but I must see
Macdougal before I undress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something of her mistress&rsquo;s agitation seemed to have become
communicated to Lenora. Her voice shook a little as she stepped into the
elevator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you off to, young lady?&rdquo; the boy enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to go round to our quarters,&rdquo; Lenora explained.
&ldquo;Her ladyship wants to speak to Mr. Macdougal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone out, sure,&rdquo; the elevator boy remarked.
&ldquo;Shall I wait for you, Miss Lenora?&rdquo; he asked, as they descended
into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be more than a
minute or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She walked quickly to the back part of the hotel and ascended in another
elevator to the wing in which the servants&rsquo; quarters were situated. Here
she made her way along a corridor until she reached Macdougal&rsquo;s room. She
knocked, and knocked again. There was no answer. She tried the door and found
it was locked. Then she returned to the elevator and descended once more to the
floor upon which her mistress&rsquo;s apartments were situated. She opened the
door of the suite without knocking and turned at once to the sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry, my lady,&rdquo; she began&mdash;</p>
<p>Then she stopped short. The elevator boy, who had had a little trouble with
his starting apparatus and had not as yet descended, heard the scream which
broke from her lips, and a fireman in an adjacent corridor came running up
almost at the same moment. Lenora was on her knees by her mistress&rsquo;s
side. Ella was still lying in the easy-chair in which she had been seated, but
her head was thrown back in an unnatural fashion. There was a red mark just
across her throat. The small table by her side had been overturned, and the
chocolate was running in a little stream across the floor. The elevator boy was
the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Holy shakes!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Lenora shrieked. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
fainted! And the diamonds&mdash;the diamonds have gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fireman was already at the telephone. In less than a minute one of the
managers from the office came running in. Lenora was dashing water into
Ella&rsquo;s still, cold face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fainted!&rdquo; she shrieked. &ldquo;Fetch a doctor, some
one. The diamonds have gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man was already at the telephone. His hand shook as he took up the
receiver. He turned to the elevator boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run across to number seventy-three&mdash;Doctor
Morton&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you let any one come in,
fireman. Don&rsquo;t either of you say a word about this. Here, Exchange,
urgent call. Give me the police-station&mdash;yes, police-station!&hellip;
Don&rsquo;t be a fool, girl,&rdquo; he added under his breath. &ldquo;You
won&rsquo;t do any good throwing water on her like that. Let her alone for a
moment&hellip;. Yes! Manager, Leeland Hotel, speaking. A murder and robbery
have taken place in this hotel, suite number forty-three. I am there now.
Nothing shall be touched. Send round this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man hung up the receiver. Lenora was filling the room with her
shrieks. He took her by the shoulder and pushed her back into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, you fool!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do any
good making a noise like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said she saw the door handle turn,&rdquo; Lenora sobbed. &ldquo;I
went to fetch Macdougal. He&rsquo;d gone out. When I came back she was
there&mdash;like that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What door handle?&rdquo; the manager asked.</p>
<p>Lenora pointed. The young man crossed the room. The lock was still in its
place, the door refused to yield. As he turned around the doctor arrived. He
hurried at once to Ella&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands still warm,&rdquo; he muttered, as he felt them&hellip;.
&ldquo;My God! It&rsquo;s the double knot strangle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent over Ella for several moments. Then he rose to his feet. The door
from outside had been opened once more. A police inspector, followed by a
detective, had entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your affair, gentlemen, not mine,&rdquo; the doctor said
gravely. &ldquo;The young lady is dead. She has been cruelly strangled within
the last five or ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lock the outside door,&rdquo; he ordered his man. &ldquo;Has any one
left the room, Mr. Marsham?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one,&rdquo; the manager declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who discovered her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora rose to her feet. She seemed a little calmer but the healthy colour
had all gone from her cheeks and her lips were twitching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her ladyship had just come in from the Opera,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;She was sitting in her easy-chair. I was in the bedroom. She looked
toward the handle of that door. She thought it moved. She called me. I tried it
and found it fast locked. She sent for Mr. Macdougal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macdougal,&rdquo; Mr. Marsham explained, &ldquo;is a confidential
servant of Lord Ashleigh&rsquo;s. He was sent over here with Lady
Ella.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found Mr. Macdougal&rsquo;s door locked. He must have gone out.
When I came back here, I found this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector made a careful examination of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; he enquired, &ldquo;is this the young lady who owned
the wonderful Ashleigh diamonds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone!&rdquo; Lenora shrieked. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been
stolen! She was wearing them when I left the room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector turned to the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Marsham,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am afraid this will be a
difficult affair. I am going to take the liberty of calling in an expert.
Hello. I want Number One, New York City&mdash;Mr. Sanford Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>4.</h3>
<p><a id="pic2" name="pic2"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="1202801h-images/TheBlackBox02.jpg" title=
"A drawing room in which several characters stand around, and a woman lies on the floor">
<p class="caption">Sanford Quest is called upon to clear the<br>
mystery of the murder of Lord Ashleigh&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
</div>
<p class="first">There seemed to be nothing at all original in the methods
pursued by the great criminologist when confronted with this tableau of death
and robbery. His remarks to the Inspector were few and perfunctory. He asked
only a few languid questions of Macdougal and Lenora, who were summoned to his
presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had left the hotel, I understand, at the time when the crime
occurred?&rdquo; he asked the latter.</p>
<p>Macdougal, grave and respectful, made his answers with difficulty. His voice
was choked with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought my mistress home from the Opera, sir. I rode on the box
with Mrs. Delarey&rsquo;s chauffeur. After I had seen her safely in the hotel,
I went up to my room for two minutes and left the hotel by the back
entrance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one see you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The door-keeper, sir, and I passed a page upon the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t it rather late for you to go out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My days are a little dull here, sir,&rdquo; Macdougal replied,
&ldquo;and my attendance is not required early in the morning. I have made some
friends in the city and I usually go out to a restaurant and have some
supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite natural,&rdquo; Mr. Quest agreed. &ldquo;That will do,
thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Macdougal turned towards the door. Lenora was about to follow him but Quest
signed to her to remain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to have a little conversation with you about your
mistress,&rdquo; he said to her pleasantly. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I
will ask you to accompany me in my car. I will send the man back with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the girl stood quite still. Her face was already ghastly pale.
Her eyes alone seemed to indicate some fresh fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go to my rooms and put on my hat,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Quest pointed through the half-open door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be your hat and coat upon the bed there, won&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I am sorry to hurry you off but I have another
appointment. You will send, of course, for the young lady&rsquo;s
friends,&rdquo; he added, turning to Mr. Marsham, &ldquo;and cable her
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing more you can do, Mr. Quest?&rdquo; the hotel manager
asked, a little querulously. &ldquo;This affair must be cleared up for the
credit of my hotel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest shrugged his shoulders. He glanced through the open door to where
Lenora was arranging her coat with trembling fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be very little difficulty about that,&rdquo; he said
calmly. &ldquo;If you are quite ready, Miss Lenora. Is that your
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora is my name, sir,&rdquo; the girl replied.</p>
<p>They descended in the elevator together and Quest handed the girl into his
car. They drove quickly through the silent streets. The snow had ceased to fall
and the stars were shining brightly. Lenora shivered as she leaned back in her
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are cold, I am afraid,&rdquo; Quest remarked. &ldquo;Never mind,
there will be a good fire in my study. I shall only keep you for a few moments.
I dare not be away long just now, as I have a very important case
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing more that I can tell you,&rdquo; Lenora ventured, a
little fearfully. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you ask me what you want to, now, as we go
along?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have already arrived,&rdquo; Quest told her. &ldquo;Do you mind
following me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crossed the pavement and passed through the front door, which Quest was
holding open for her. They stepped into the little elevator, and a moment or
two later Lenora was installed in an easy-chair in Quest&rsquo;s sitting-room,
in front of a roaring fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lean back and make yourself comfortable,&rdquo; Quest invited, as he
took a chair opposite to her. &ldquo;I must just look through these
papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl did as she was told. She opened her coat. The room was delightfully
warm, almost overheated. A sense of rest crept over her. For the first moment
since the awful shock, her nerves seemed quieter. Gradually she began to feel
almost as though she were passing into sleep. She started up, but sank back
again almost immediately. She was conscious that Quest had laid down the
letters which he had been pretending to read. His eyes were fixed upon her.
There was a queer new look in them, a strange new feeling creeping through her
veins. Was she going to sleep?&hellip;</p>
<p>Quest&rsquo;s voice broke an unnatural silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are anxious to telephone some one,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You looked at both of the booths as we came through the hotel. Then
you remembered, I think, that he would not be there yet. Telephone now. The
telephone is at your right hand. You know the number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed almost at once. She took the receiver from the instrument by her
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number 700, New York City.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will ask,&rdquo; Quest continued, &ldquo;whether he is all right,
whether the jewels are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief silence, then the girl&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you there, James?&hellip; Yes, I am Lenora. Are you safe? Have
you the jewels?&hellip; Where?&hellip; You are sure that you are safe&hellip;.
No, nothing fresh has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are at the hotel,&rdquo; Quest said softly. &ldquo;You are going
to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot sleep,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;I am coming to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She set down the receiver. Quest leaned a little more closely over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where the jewels are hidden,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell me
where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her lips quivered. She made no answer. She turned uneasily in her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the place?&rdquo; Quest persisted.</p>
<p>There was still no response from the girl. There were drops of perspiration
on her forehead. Quest shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;You need not tell me. Only
remember this! At nine o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning you will bring those
jewels to this apartment&hellip;. Rest quietly now. I want you to go to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed without hesitation. Quest watched, for a moment, her regular
breathing. Then he touched a bell by his side. Laura entered almost at
once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the laboratory,&rdquo; Quest ordered. &ldquo;Then come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word or a glance towards the sleeping figure, she obeyed him. It
was a matter of seconds before she returned. Together they lifted and carried
the sleeping girl out of the room, across the landing, into a larger apartment,
the contents of which were wrapped in gloom and mystery. A single electric
light was burning on the top of a square mirror fixed upon an easel. Towards
this they carried the girl and laid her in an easy-chair almost opposite to
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battery is just on the left,&rdquo; Laura whispered.</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away for a moment and disappeared in the shadows. When she
returned, she carried a curved band of flexible steel. Quest took it from her,
attached it by means of a coil of wire to the battery, and with firm, soft
fingers slipped it on to Lenora&rsquo;s forehead. Then he stepped back. A rare
emotion quivered in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a subject, Laura&mdash;I&rsquo;m sure of it! Now for our
great experiment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They watched Lenora intently. Her face twitched uneasily, but she did not
open her eyes and her breathing continued regular. Quest bent over her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora,&rdquo; he said, slowly and firmly, &ldquo;your mind is full
of one subject. You see your mistress in her chair by the fireside. She is
toying with her diamonds. Look again. She lies there dead! Who was it entered
the room, Lenora? Look! Look! Gaze into that mirror. What do you see
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s eyes had opened. They were fixed now upon the
mirror&mdash;distended, full of unholy things. Quest wiped a drop of
perspiration from his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try harder, Lenora,&rdquo; he muttered, his own breath labouring.
&ldquo;It is there in your brain! Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura for the first time showed signs of emotion. She pointed towards the
mirror. Quest was suddenly silent. He seemed to have turned into a figure of
stone. For a single second the smooth surface of the mirror was obscured. A
room crept dimly like a picture into being, a fire upon the hearth, a girl
leaning back in her chair. A door in the background opened. A man stole out. He
crept nearer to the girl&mdash;his eyes fixed upon the diamonds, a thin, silken
cord twisted round his wrist. Suddenly she saw him&mdash;too late! His hand was
upon her lips,&mdash;his face seemed to start almost from the mirror&mdash;then
blackness!</p>

</div>
<br>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Lenora opened her eyes. She was still in the easy-chair before the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest!&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>He looked up from some letters which he had been studying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; he said politely. &ldquo;I really had forgotten
that you were here. But you know&mdash;that you have been to sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She half rose to her feet. She was perplexed, uneasy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Asleep?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;Have I? And I dreamed a horrible
dream!&hellip; Have I been ringing anyone up on the telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of,&rdquo; Quest assured her. &ldquo;As a matter of
fact, I was called downstairs to see one of my men soon after we got
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I go now?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I find
that I shall not need to ask you those questions, after all. A messenger from
the police-station has been here. He says they have come to the conclusion that
a very well-known gang of New York criminals are in this thing. We know how to
track them down all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may go now, then?&rdquo; she repeated, with immense relief.</p>
<p>Quest escorted the girl downstairs, opened the front door, blew his whistle
and his car pulled up at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take this young lady,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;wherever she wishes.
Good night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drove off. Quest watched the car disappear around the corner. Then
he turned slowly back and made preparations for his adventure&hellip;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number 700, New York,&rdquo; he muttered, half an hour later, as he
left his house. &ldquo;Beyond Fourteenth Street&mdash;a tough
neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment, feeling the articles in his overcoat
pocket&mdash;a revolver in one, a small piece of hard substance in the other.
Then he stepped into his car, which had just returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you leave the young lady?&rdquo; he asked the
chauffeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Broadway, sir. She left me and boarded a cross-town
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No finesse,&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<h3>5.</h3>
<p class="first">Sanford Quest was naturally a person unaffected by
presentiments or nervous fears of any sort, yet, having advanced a couple of
yards along the hallway of the house which he had just entered without
difficulty, he came to a standstill, oppressed with the sense of impending
danger. With his electric torch he carefully surveyed the dilapidated staircase
in front of him, the walls from which the paper hung down in depressing-looking
strips. The house was, to all appearances, uninhabited. The door had yielded
easily to his master-key. Yet this was the house connected with Number 700, New
York, the house to which Lenora had come. Furthermore, from the street outside
he had seen a light upon the first floor, instantly extinguished as he had
climbed the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one here?&rdquo; he asked, raising his voice a little.</p>
<p>There was no direct response, yet from somewhere upstairs he heard the half
smothered cry of a woman. He gripped his revolver in his fingers. He was a
fatalist, and although for a moment he regretted having come single-handed to
such an obvious trap, he prepared for his task. He took a quick step forward.
The ground seemed to slip from beneath his feet. He staggered wildly to recover
himself, and failed. The floor had given from beneath him. He was falling into
blackness&hellip;.</p>
<p>The fall itself was scarcely a dozen feet. He picked himself up, his
shoulder bruised, his head swimming a little. His electric torch was broken to
pieces upon the stone floor. He was simply in a black gulf of darkness.
Suddenly a gleam of light shone down. A trap-door above his head was slid a few
inches back. The flare of an electric torch shone upon his face, a man&rsquo;s
mocking voice addressed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the great Sanford Quest? This surely cannot be the greatest
detective in the world walking so easily into the spider&rsquo;s
web!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any chance of getting out?&rdquo; Quest asked laconically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None!&rdquo; was the bitter reply. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done enough
mischief. You&rsquo;re there to rot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why this animus against me, my friend Macdougal?&rdquo; Quest
demanded. &ldquo;You and I have never come up against one another before. I
didn&rsquo;t like the life you led in New York ten years ago, or your friends,
but you&rsquo;ve suffered nothing through me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I let you go,&rdquo; once more came the man&rsquo;s voice,
&ldquo;I know very well in what chair I shall be sitting before a month has
passed. I am James Macdougal, Mr. Sanford Quest, and I have got the Ashleigh
diamonds, and I have settled an old grudge, if not of my own, of one greater
than you. That&rsquo;s all. A pleasant night to you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door went down with a bang. Faintly, as though, indeed, the footsteps
belonged to some other world, Sanford Quest heard the two leave the house. Then
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A perfect oubliette,&rdquo; he remarked to himself, as he held a
match over his head a moment or two later, &ldquo;built for the purpose. It
must be the house we failed to find which Bill Taylor used to keep before he
was shot. Smooth brick walls, smooth brick floor, only exit twelve feet above
one&rsquo;s head. Human means, apparently, are useless. Science, you have been
my mistress all my days. You must save my life now or lose an earnest
disciple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt in his overcoat pocket and drew out the small, hard pellet. He
gripped it in his fingers, stood as nearly as possible underneath the spot from
which he had been projected, coolly swung his arm back, and flung the black
pebble against the sliding door. The explosion which followed shook the very
ground under his feet. The walls cracked about him. Blue fire seemed to be
playing around the blackness. He jumped on one side, barely in time to escape a
shower of bricks. For minutes afterwards everything around him seemed to rock.
He struck another match. The whole of the roof of the place was gone. By
building a few bricks together, he was easily able to climb high enough to
swing himself on to the fragments of the hallway. Even as he accomplished this,
the door was thrown open and a crowd of people rushed in. Sanford Quest
emerged, dusty but unhurt, and touched a constable on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest me,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;I am Sanford Quest. I must be
taken at once to headquarters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so, Mr. Quest? Stand on one side, you loafers,&rdquo; the man
ordered, pushing his way out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a taxicab,&rdquo; Quest decided.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any one else in the house?&rdquo; the policeman asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a soul,&rdquo; Quest answered.</p>
<p>They found a cab without much difficulty. It was five o&rsquo;clock when
they reached the central police-station. Inspector French happened to be just
going off duty. He recognized Quest with a little exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got your man to bring me here,&rdquo; Quest explained, &ldquo;so as
to get away from the mob.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;ve been in trouble!&rdquo; the Inspector remarked,
leading the way into his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bit of an explosion, that&rsquo;s all,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;I
shall be all right when you&rsquo;ve lent me a clothes-brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ashleigh diamonds, eh?&rdquo; the Inspector asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have them at nine o&rsquo;clock this morning,&rdquo; Sanford
Quest promised, &ldquo;and hand you over the murderer somewhere around
midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector scratched his chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what I can hear about the young lady&rsquo;s friends,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the murderer they are most anxious to see
nabbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll have him,&rdquo; Quest promised. &ldquo;Come round
about half-past nine and I&rsquo;ll hand over the diamonds to start
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest slept for a couple of hours, had a bath and made a leisurely toilet.
At a quarter to nine he sat down to breakfast in his rooms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he told his servant, &ldquo;a young
lady will call. Bring her up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was suddenly opened. Lenora walked in. Quest glanced in surprise at
the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fault!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We are slow. Good morning, Miss
Lenora!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came straight to the table. The servant, at a sign from Quest,
disappeared. There were black rims around her eyes; she seemed exhausted. She
laid a little packet upon the table. Quest opened it coolly. The Ashleigh
diamonds flashed up at him. He led Lenora to a chair and rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prepare a bedroom upstairs,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Ask Miss Roche
to come here. Laura,&rdquo; he added, as his secretary entered, &ldquo;will you
look after this young lady? She is in a state of nervous exhaustion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl nodded. She understood. She led Lenora from the room. Quest resumed
his breakfast. A few minutes later, Inspector French was announced. Quest
nodded in friendly manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some coffee, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have those diamonds!&rdquo; the Inspector
replied.</p>
<p>Quest threw them lightly across the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catch hold, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s bright work,&rdquo; he acknowledged. &ldquo;I
believe I could have laid my hands on the man, but it was the jewels that I was
afraid of losing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; Quest remarked. &ldquo;And now, French, will you be
here, please, at midnight with three men, armed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here?&rdquo; the Inspector repeated.</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is going to be mad enough to walk
into hell, even, when he finds out what he thinks has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t any of Jimmy&rsquo;s lot?&rdquo; the Inspector
asked.</p>
<p>Sanford Quest shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;French,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;keep mum, but it was the elderly
family retainer, Macdougal. I felt restless about him. He has lost the
girl&mdash;he was married to her, by-the-bye&mdash;and the jewels. No fear of
his slipping away. I shall have him here at the time I told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve a way of your own of doing these things, Mr.
Quest,&rdquo; the Inspector admitted grudgingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly luck,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;Take a cigar, and so long,
Inspector. They want me to talk to Chicago on another little piece of
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>It was a few minutes before midnight when Quest parted the curtains of a
room on the ground floor of his house in Georgia Square, and looked out into
the snow-white street. Then he turned around and addressed the figure lying as
though asleep upon the sofa by the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am going out. Stay here, if you
please, until I return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the room. For a few moments there was a profound silence. Then a
white face was pressed against the window. There was a crash of glass. A man,
covered with snow, sprang into the apartment. He moved swiftly to the sofa, and
something black and ugly swayed in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve deceived me, have you?&rdquo; he panted.
&ldquo;Handed over the jewels, chucked me, and given me the double cross!
Anything to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A piece of coal fell on to the grate. Not a sound came from the sofa.
Macdougal leaned forward, his white face distorted with passion. The
life-preserver bent and quivered behind him, cut the air with a swish and
crashed full upon the head.</p>
<p>The man staggered back. The weapon fell from his fingers. For a moment he
was paralysed. There was no blood upon his hand, no cry&mdash;silence inhuman,
unnatural! He looked again. Then the lights flashed out all around him. There
were two detectives in the doorway, their revolvers covering him,&mdash;Sanford
Quest, with Lenora in the background. In the sudden illumination,
Macdougal&rsquo;s horror turned almost to hysterical rage. He had wasted his
fury upon a dummy! It was sawdust, not blood, which littered the couch!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him, men,&rdquo; Quest ordered. &ldquo;Hands up, Macdougal. Your
number&rsquo;s up. Better take it quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The handcuffs were upon him before he could move. He was trying to speak,
but the words somehow choked in his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can send a wireless to Lord Ashleigh,&rdquo; Quest continued,
turning to French. &ldquo;Tell him that the diamonds have been recovered and
that his daughter&rsquo;s murderer is arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the young woman?&rdquo; the Inspector asked.</p>
<p>Lenora stood in an attitude of despair, her head downcast. She had turned a
little away from Macdougal. Her hands were outstretched. It was as though she
were expecting the handcuffs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can let her alone,&rdquo; Sanford Quest said quietly. &ldquo;A
wife cannot give evidence against her husband, and besides, I need her. She is
going to work for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">Lord Ashleigh accuses Lenora of being implicated<br>
in the crime, but Quest decides to the contrary.</p>
</div>
<p>Macdougal was already at the door, between the two detectives. He swung
around. His voice was calm, almost clear&mdash;calm with the concentration of
hatred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a wonderful man, Mr. Sanford Quest,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Make the most of your triumph. Your time is nearly up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep him for a moment,&rdquo; Sanford Quest ordered. &ldquo;You have
friends, then, Macdougal, who will avenge you, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no friends,&rdquo; Macdougal replied, &ldquo;but there is one
coming whose wit and cunning, science and skill are all-conquering. He will
brush you away, Sanford Quest, like a fly. Wait a few weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You interest me,&rdquo; Quest murmured. &ldquo;Tell me some more
about this great master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall tell you nothing,&rdquo; Macdougal replied. &ldquo;You will
hear nothing, you will know nothing. Suddenly you will find yourself opposed.
You will struggle&mdash;and then the end. It is certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They led him away. Only Lenora remained, sobbing. Quest went up to her, laid
his hand upon her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a rough time, Lenora,&rdquo; he said, with strange
gentleness. &ldquo;Perhaps the brighter days are coming.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="ch3" id="ch3"></a>III.&mdash;THE HIDDEN HANDS</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">Sanford Quest and Lenora stood side by side upon the steps of
the Courthouse, waiting for the automobile which had become momentarily
entangled in a string of vehicles. A little crowd of people were elbowing their
way out on to the sidewalk. The faces of most of them were still shadowed by
the three hours of tense drama from which they had just emerged. Quest, who had
lit a cigar, watched them curiously.</p>
<p><a id="pic5" name="pic5"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="1202801h-images/TheBlackBox05.jpg" title=
"A courtroom scene.">
<p class="caption">Ian Macdougal is given a life sentence for<br>
the murder of the daughter of Lord Ashleigh.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;No need to go into Court,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I could have
told you, from the look of these people, that Macdougal had escaped the death
sentence. They have paid their money&mdash;or rather their time, and they have
been cheated of the one supreme thrill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Imprisonment for life seems terrible enough,&rdquo; Lenora whispered,
shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see the sense of keeping such a man alive myself,&rdquo;
Quest declared, with purposeful brutality. &ldquo;It was a cruel murder,
fiendishly committed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora shivered. Quest laid his fingers for a moment upon her wrist. His
voice, though still firm, became almost kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never be afraid, Lenora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to admit the truth.
Come, we have finished with Macdougal now. Imprisonment for life will keep him
from crossing your path again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora sighed. She was almost ashamed of her feeling of immense relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry for him,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I wish there
were something one could do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing,&rdquo; Quest replied shortly, &ldquo;and if there
were, you would not be allowed to undertake it. You didn&rsquo;t happen to
notice the way he looked at you once or twice, did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the terror shone out of Lenora&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I had
forgotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were on the point of crossing the pavement towards the automobile when
Quest felt a touch upon his shoulder. He turned and found Lord Ashleigh
standing by his side. Quest glanced towards Lenora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run and get in the car,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;I will be there
in a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She dropped her veil and hastened across the pavement. The
Englishman&rsquo;s face grew sterner as he watched her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Macdougal&rsquo;s accomplice,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;We used to
trust that girl, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had nothing whatever to do with the actual crime, believe
me,&rdquo; Quest assured him. &ldquo;Besides, you must remember that it was
really through her that the man was brought to justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I harbour no ill-feelings towards the girl,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh
replied. &ldquo;Nevertheless, the sight of her for a moment was
disconcerting&hellip;. I would not have stopped you just now, Mr. Quest, but my
brother is very anxious to renew his acquaintance with you. I think you met
years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanford Quest held out his hand to the man who had been standing a little in
the background. Lord Ashleigh turned towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Quest, Edgar. You may remember my brother&mdash;Professor
Ashleigh&mdash;as a man of science, Quest? He has just returned from South
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two shook hands, curiously diverse in type, in expression, in all the
appurtenances of manhood. Quest was dark, with no sign of greyness in his
closely-trimmed black hair. His face was an epitome of forcefulness, his lips
hard, his eyes brilliant. He was dressed with the utmost care. His manner was
self-possessed almost to a fault. The Professor, on the other hand, though his
shoulders were broad, lost much of his height and presence through a very
pronounced stoop. His face was pale, his mouth sensitive, his smile almost
womanly in its sweetness. His clothes, and a general air of abstraction, seemed
rather to indicate the clerical profession. His forehead, however, disclosed as
he lifted his hat, was the forehead of a scholar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very proud to make your acquaintance again, Professor,&rdquo;
Quest said. &ldquo;Glad to know, too, that you hadn&rsquo;t quite forgotten
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; the Professor declared, as he released the
other&rsquo;s hand with seeming reluctance, &ldquo;I have thought about you
many times. Your doings have always been of interest to me. Though I have been
lost to the world of civilisation for so long, I have correspondents here in
New York to keep me in touch with all that is interesting. You have made a
great name for yourself, Mr. Quest. You are one of those who have made science
your handmaiden in a wonderful profession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind, Professor,&rdquo; Quest observed, flicking the ash
from his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; the other insisted. &ldquo;Not at all. I have the
greatest admiration for your methods.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; Quest remarked, &ldquo;that our first meeting here
should be under such distressing circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor nodded gravely. He glanced towards his brother, who was
talking to an acquaintance a few feet away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been a most melancholy occasion,&rdquo; he admitted, his voice
shaking with emotion. &ldquo;Still, I felt it my duty to support my brother
through the trial. Apart from that, you know, Mr. Quest, a scene such as we
have just witnessed has a peculiar&mdash;I might almost say fascination for
me,&rdquo; the Professor continued, with a little glint in his eyes.
&ldquo;You, as a man of science, can realise, I am sure, that the criminal side
of human nature is always of interest to an anthropologist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be so, of course,&rdquo; Quest agreed, glancing towards the
automobile in which Lenora was seated. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse me,
Professor, I think I must be getting along. We shall meet again, I
trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment,&rdquo; the Professor begged eagerly. &ldquo;Tell me, Mr.
Quest&mdash;I want your honest opinion. What do you think of my ape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of your what?&rdquo; Quest enquired dubiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of my anthropoid ape which I have just sent to the museum. You know
my claim? But perhaps you would prefer to postpone your final decision until
after you have examined the skeleton itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A light broke in upon the criminologist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;For the moment, Professor, I
couldn&rsquo;t follow you. You are talking about the skeleton of the ape which
you brought home from South America, and which you have presented to the museum
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally,&rdquo; the Professor assented, with mild surprise.
&ldquo;To what else? I am stating my case, Mr. Quest, in the <i>North American
Review</i> next month. I may tell you, however, as a fellow scientist, the
great and absolute truth. My claim is incontestable. My skeleton will prove to
the world, without a doubt, the absolute truth of Darwin&rsquo;s great
theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must go and see it,&rdquo; the Professor insisted, keeping by
Quest&rsquo;s side as the latter moved towards the automobile. &ldquo;You must
go and see it, Mr. Quest. It will be on view to the public next week, but in
the meantime I will telephone to the curator. You must mention my name. You
shall be permitted a special examination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very kind of you,&rdquo; Quest murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall meet again soon, I hope,&rdquo; the Professor concluded
cordially. &ldquo;Good morning, Mr. Quest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men shook hands, and Quest took his seat by Lenora&rsquo;s side in
the automobile. The Professor rejoined his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as they walked off together, &ldquo;I am
disappointed in Mr. Quest! I am very disappointed indeed. You will not believe
what I am going to tell you, but it is the truth. He could not conceal it from
me. He takes no interest whatever in my anthropoid ape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; the other replied grimly.</p>
<p>The Professor sighed as he hailed a taxicab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;are naturally not
in the frame of mind for the consideration of these great subjects. Besides,
you have no scientific tendencies. But in Sanford Quest I am disappointed. I
expected his enthusiasm&mdash;I may say that I counted upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that Quest has much of that quality to
spare,&rdquo; his brother remarked, &ldquo;for anything outside his own
criminal hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered the taxicab and were driven almost in silence to the
Professor&rsquo;s home&mdash;a large, rambling old house, situated in somewhat
extensive but ill-kept grounds on the outskirts of New York. The Englishman
glanced around him, as they passed up the drive, with an expression of
disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A more untidy-looking place than yours, Edgar, I never saw,&rdquo; he
declared. &ldquo;Your grounds have become a jungle. Don&rsquo;t you keep any
gardeners?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I keep other things,&rdquo; he said serenely. &ldquo;There is
something in my garden which would terrify your nice Scotch gardeners into
fits, if they found their way here to do a little tidying up. Come into the
library and I&rsquo;ll give you one of my choice cigars. Here&rsquo;s Craig
waiting to let us in. Any news, Craig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man-servant in plain clothes who admitted them shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing has happened, sir,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The telephone is
ringing in the study now, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will answer it myself,&rdquo; the Professor declared, bustling
off.</p>
<p>He hurried across the bare landing and into an apartment which seemed to be
half museum, half library. There were skeletons leaning in unexpected corners,
strange charts upon the walls, a wilderness of books and pamphlets in all
manner of unexpected places, mingled with quaintly-carved curios, gods from
West African temples, implements of savage warfare, butterfly nets. It was a
room which Lord Ashleigh was never able to enter without a shudder.</p>
<p>The Professor took up the receiver from the telephone. His
&ldquo;Hello&rdquo; was mild and enquiring. He had no doubt that the call was
from some admiring disciple. The change in his face as he listened, however,
was amazing. His lips began to twitch. An expression of horrified dismay
overspread his features. His first reply was almost incoherent. He held the
receiver away from him and turned towards his brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George,&rdquo; he gasped, &ldquo;the greatest tragedy in the world
has happened! My ape is stolen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His brother looked at him blankly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ape is stolen?&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skeleton of my anthropoid ape,&rdquo; the Professor continued,
his voice growing alike in sadness and firmness. &ldquo;It is the curator of
the museum who is speaking. They have just opened the box. It has lain for two
days in an anteroom. It is empty!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Ashleigh muttered something a little vague. The theft of a skeleton
scarcely appeared to his unscientific mind to be a realisable thing. The
Professor turned back to the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Francis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I cannot talk to you. I can say
nothing. I shall come to you at once. I am on the point of starting. Your news
has overwhelmed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid down the receiver. He looked around him like a man in a
nightmare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The taxicab is still waiting, sir,&rdquo; Craig reminded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is most fortunate,&rdquo; the Professor pronounced. &ldquo;I
remember now that I had no change with which to pay him. I must go back. Look
after my brother. And, Craig, telephone at once to Mr. Sanford Quest. Ask him
to meet me at the museum in twenty minutes. Tell him that nothing must stand in
the way. Do you hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hesitated. There was protest in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sanford Quest, sir?&rdquo; he muttered, as he followed his master
down the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great criminologist,&rdquo; the Professor explained eagerly.
&ldquo;Certainly! Why do you hesitate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was wondering, sir,&rdquo; Craig began.</p>
<p>The Professor waved his servant on one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as you are told,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Do as you are told,
Craig. You others&mdash;you do not realise. You cannot understand what this
means. Tell the taxi man to drive to the museum. I am overcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The taxicab man drove off, glad enough to have a return fare. In about
half-an-hour&rsquo;s time the Professor strode up the steps of the museum and
hurried into the office. There was a little crowd of officials there whom the
curator at once dismissed. He rose slowly to his feet. His manner was grave but
bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will waste no time in words.
Look here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw open the door of an anteroom behind his office. The apartment was
unfurnished except for one or two chairs. In the middle of the uncarpeted floor
was a long wooden box from which the lid had just been pried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday, as you know from my note,&rdquo; the curator proceeded,
&ldquo;I was away. I gave orders that your case should be placed here and I
myself should enjoy the distinction of opening it. An hour ago I commenced the
task. That is what I found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor gazed blankly at the empty box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing left except the smell,&rdquo; a voice from the open doorway
remarked.</p>
<p>They glanced around. Quest was standing there, and behind him Lenora. The
Professor welcomed them eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Quest, the great criminologist,&rdquo; he explained to
the curator. &ldquo;Come in, Mr. Quest. Let me introduce you to Mr. Francis,
the curator of the museum. Ask him what questions you will. Mr. Quest, you have
the opportunity of earning the undying gratitude of a brother scientist. If my
skeleton cannot be recovered, the work of years is undone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest strolled thoughtfully around the room, glancing out of each of the
windows in turn. He kept close to the wall, and when he had finished he drew
out a magnifying-glass from his pocket and made a brief examination of the box.
Then he asked a few questions of the curator, pointed out one of the windows to
Lenora and whispered a few directions to her. She at once produced what seemed
to be a foot-rule from the bag which she was carrying, and hurried into the
garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little invention of my own for measuring foot-prints,&rdquo; Quest
explained. &ldquo;Not much use here, I am afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of the affair so far, Mr. Quest?&rdquo; the
Professor asked eagerly.</p>
<p>The criminologist shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Incomprehensible,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;Can you think,
by-the-bye, of any other motive for the theft besides scientific
jealousy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There could be no other,&rdquo; the Professor declared sadly,
&ldquo;and it is, alas! too prevalent. I have had to suffer from it all my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest stood over the box for a moment or two and looked once more out of the
window. Presently Lenora returned. She carried in her hand a small object,
which she brought silently to Quest. He glanced at it in perplexity. The
Professor peered over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the little finger!&rdquo; he cried,&mdash;&ldquo;the little
finger of my ape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest held it away from him critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From which hand?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The right hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest examined the fastenings of the window before which he had paused
during his previous examination. He turned away with a shrug of the
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you later, Mr. Ashleigh,&rdquo; he concluded laconically.
&ldquo;Nothing more to be done at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor followed him to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said, his voice broken with emotion, &ldquo;it
is the work of my lifetime of which I am being robbed. You will use your best
efforts, you will spare no expense? I am rich. Your fee you shall name
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do my best,&rdquo; Quest promised, &ldquo;to find the
skeleton. Come, Lenora. Good morning, gentlemen!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>With his new assistant, Quest walked slowly from the museum and turned
towards his home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make anything of this, Lenora?&rdquo; he asked her.</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;It looks as though the
skeleton had been taken away through that window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marvellous!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are making fun of me,&rdquo; she protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I! But you see, my young friend, the point is this. Who in their
senses would want to steal an anthropoid skeleton except a scientific man, and
if a scientific man stole it out of sheer jealousy, why in thunder
couldn&rsquo;t he be content with just mutilating it, which would have
destroyed its value just as well&mdash;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short. A newsboy thrust the paper at them. Quest glanced at the
headlines. Lenora clutched at his arm. Together they read in great black
type&mdash;</p>
<p class="headline">ESCAPE OF CONVICTED PRISONER!<br>

<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">The windows of Mrs. Rheinholdt&rsquo;s town house were ablaze
with light. A crimson drugget stretched down the steps to the curbstone. A long
row of automobiles stood waiting. Through the wide-flung doors was visible a
pleasant impression of flowers and light and luxury. In the nearer of the two
large reception rooms Mrs. Rheinholdt herself, a woman dark, handsome, and in
the prime of life, was standing receiving her guests. By her side was her son,
whose twenty-first birthday was being celebrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whether that professor of yours will come,&rdquo; she
remarked, as the stream of incoming guests slackened for a moment.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to have him here, if it were only for a moment. Every
one&rsquo;s talking about him and his work in South America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hates receptions,&rdquo; the boy replied, &ldquo;but he promised
he&rsquo;d come. I never thought, when he used to drill science into us at the
lectures, that he was going to be such a tremendous big pot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rheinholdt&rsquo;s plump fingers toyed for a moment complacently with
the diamonds which hung from her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can never tell, in a world like this,&rdquo; she murmured.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I make a point of being civil to everybody. Your
laundry woman may become a multimillionaire, or your singing master a Caruso,
and then, just while their month&rsquo;s on, every one is crazy to meet them.
It&rsquo;s the Professor&rsquo;s month just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is, mother!&rdquo; the young man exclaimed suddenly.
&ldquo;Good old boy! I thought he&rsquo;d keep his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rheinholdt assumed her most encouraging and condescending smile as she
held out both hands to the Professor. He came towards her, stooping a little
more than usual. His mouth had drooped a little and there were signs of fatigue
in his face. Nevertheless, his answering smile was as delightful as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is perfectly sweet of you, Professor,&rdquo; Mrs. Rheinholdt
declared. &ldquo;We scarcely ventured to hope that you would break through your
rule, but Philip was so looking forward to have you come. You were his
favourite master at lectures, you know, and now&mdash;well, of course, you have
the scientific world at your feet. Later on in the evening, Professor,&rdquo;
she added, watching some very important newcomers, &ldquo;you will tell me all
about your anthropoid ape, won&rsquo;t you? Philip, look after Mr. Ashleigh.
Don&rsquo;t let him go far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rheinholdt breathed a sigh of relief as she greeted her new
arrivals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor Ashleigh, brother of Lord Ashleigh, you know,&rdquo; she
explained. &ldquo;This is the first house he has been to since his return from
South America. You&rsquo;ve heard all about those wonderful discoveries, of
course&hellip;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor made himself universally agreeable in a mild way, and his
presence created even more than the sensation which Mrs. Rheinholdt had hoped
for. In her desire to show him ample honour, she seldom left his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to take you into my husband&rsquo;s study,&rdquo; she
suggested, later on in the evening. &ldquo;He has some specimens of
beetles&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beetles,&rdquo; the Professor declared, with some excitement,
&ldquo;occupied precisely two months of my time while abroad. By all means,
Mrs. Rheinholdt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to go quite to the back of the house,&rdquo; she
explained, as she led him along the darkened passage.</p>
<p>The Professor smiled acquiescently. His eyes rested for a moment upon her
necklace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must really permit me, Mrs. Rheinholdt,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;to admire your wonderful stones! I am a judge of diamonds, and those
three or four in the centre are, I should imagine, unique.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held them out to him. The Professor laid the end of the necklace gently
in the palm of his hand and examined them through a horn-rimmed eyeglass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are wonderful,&rdquo; he murmured,&mdash;&ldquo;wonderful!
Why&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away a little abruptly. They had reached the back of the house and
a door from the outside had just been opened. A man had crossed the threshold
with a coat over his arm, and was standing now looking at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How extraordinary!&rdquo; the Professor remarked. &ldquo;Is that you,
Craig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment there was no answer. The servant was standing in the gloom of
an unlit portion of the passage. His eyes were fixed curiously upon the
diamonds which the Professor had just been examining. He seemed paler, even,
than usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;There is a rain storm, so I
ventured to bring your mackintosh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very thoughtful,&rdquo; the Professor murmured approvingly. &ldquo;I
have a weakness,&rdquo; he went on, turning to his hostess, &ldquo;for always
walking home after an evening like this. In the daytime I am content to ride.
At night I have the fancy always to walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t walk half enough.&rdquo; Mrs. Rheinholdt sighed,
glancing down at her somewhat portly figure. &ldquo;Dixon,&rdquo; she added,
turning to the footman who had admitted Craig, &ldquo;take Professor
Ashleigh&rsquo;s servant into the kitchen and see that he has something before
he leaves for home. Now, Professor, if you will come this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached a little room in the far corner of the house. Mrs. Rheinholdt
apologised as she switched on the electric lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a queer little place to bring you to,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but my husband used to spend many hours here, and he would never allow
anything to be moved. You see, the specimens are in these cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor nodded. His general attitude towards the forthcoming
exhibition was merely one of politeness. As the first case was opened, however,
his manner completely changed. Without taking the slightest further notice of
his hostess, he adjusted a pair of horn-rimmed spectacles and commenced to
mumble eagerly to himself. Mrs. Rheinholdt, who did not understand a word,
strolled around the apartment, yawned, and finally interrupted a little stream
of eulogies, not a word of which she understood, concerning a green beetle with
yellow spots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad you are interested, Professor,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t mind, I will rejoin my guests. You will find a
shorter way back if you keep along the passage straight ahead and come through
the conservatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly! With pleasure!&rdquo; the Professor agreed, without
glancing up.</p>
<p>His hostess sighed as she turned to leave the room. She left the door ajar.
The Professor&rsquo;s face was almost touching the glass case in which reposed
the green beetle with yellow spots.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Mrs. Rheinholdt&rsquo;s reception, notwithstanding the temporary absence of
its presiding spirit, was without doubt an unqualified success. In one of the
distant rooms the younger people were dancing. There were bridge tables, all of
which were occupied, and for those who preferred the more old-fashioned pastime
of conversation amongst luxurious surroundings, there was still ample space and
opportunity. Philip Rheinholdt, with a pretty young d&eacute;butante upon his
arm, came out from the dancing room and looked around amongst the little knots
of people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where mother is,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looking after some guests somewhere, for certain,&rdquo; the girl
replied. &ldquo;Your mother is so wonderful at entertaining, Philip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the hobby of her life,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Never so
happy as when she can get hold of somebody every one&rsquo;s talking about, and
show him off. Can&rsquo;t think what she&rsquo;s done with herself now, though.
She told me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man broke off in the middle of his sentence. He, too, like many
others in the room, felt a sudden thrill almost of horror at the sound which
rang without warning upon their ears&mdash;a woman&rsquo;s cry, a cry of fear
and horror, repeated again and again. There was a little rush towards the
curtained space which led into the conservatories. Before even, however, the
quickest could reach the spot, the curtains were thrown back and Mrs.
Rheinholdt, her hands clasping her neck, her splendid composure a thing of the
past, a panic-stricken, terrified woman, stumbled into the room. She seemed on
the point of collapse. Somehow or other, they got her into an easy-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My jewels!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;My diamonds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, mother?&rdquo; Philip Rheinholdt asked quickly.
&ldquo;Have you lost them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stolen!&rdquo; Mrs. Rheinholdt shrieked. &ldquo;Stolen there in the
conservatory!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gazed at her open-mouthed, incredulous. Then a still, quiet voice from
the outside of the little circle intervened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instruct your servants, Mr. Rheinholdt, to lock and bar all the doors
of the house,&rdquo; the Professor suggested. &ldquo;No one must leave it until
we have heard your mother&rsquo;s story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man obeyed almost mechanically. There was a general exodus of
servants from the room. Some one had brought Mrs. Rheinholdt a glass of
champagne. She sipped it and gradually recovered her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had just taken the Professor into the little room my husband used
to call the museum,&rdquo; she explained, her voice still shaking with
agitation. &ldquo;I left him there to examine some specimens of beetles. I
thought that I would come back through the conservatory, which is the quickest
way. I was about half-way across it when suddenly I heard the switch go behind
me and all the electric lights were turned out. I couldn&rsquo;t imagine what
had happened. While I hesitated, I saw&mdash;I saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She broke down again. There was no doubt about the genuineness of her
terror. She seemed somehow to have shrunken into the semblance of a smaller
woman. The pupils of her eyes were distended, she was white almost to the lips.
When she recommenced her story, her voice was fainter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw a pair of hands&mdash;just hands&mdash;no arms&mdash;nothing
but hands&mdash;come out of the darkness! They gripped me by the throat. I
suppose it was just for a second. I think&mdash;I lost consciousness for a
moment, although I was still standing up. The next thing I remember is that I
found myself shrieking and running here&mdash;and the jewels had
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw no one?&rdquo; her son asked incredulously. &ldquo;You heard
nothing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard no footsteps. I saw no one,&rdquo; Mrs. Rheinholdt
repeated.</p>
<p>The Professor turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will allow me,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;I am going to
telephone to my friend Mr. Sanford Quest, the criminologist. An affair so
unusual as this might attract him. You will excuse me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor hurried from the room. They brought Mrs. Rheinholdt more
champagne and she gradually struggled back to something like her normal self.
The dancing had stopped. Every one was standing about in little groups,
discussing the affair. The men had trooped towards the conservatory, but the
Professor met them on the portals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suggest,&rdquo; he said courteously, &ldquo;that we leave the
conservatory exactly as it is until the arrival of Mr. Sanford Quest. It will
doubtless aid him in his investigations if nothing is disturbed. All the
remaining doors are locked, so that no one can escape if by any chance they
should be hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all agreed without dissent, and there was a general movement towards
the buffet to pass the time until the coming of Mr. Sanford Quest. The
Professor met the great criminologist and his assistant in the hall upon their
arrival. He took the former at once by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;in a sense I must apologise for my
peremptory message. I am well aware that an ordinary jewel robbery does not
interest you, but in this case the circumstances are extraordinary. I ventured,
therefore, to summon your aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sanford Quest nodded shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a rule,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I do not care to take up one affair
until I have a clean slate. There&rsquo;s your skeleton still bothering me,
Professor. However, where&rsquo;s the lady who was robbed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take you to her,&rdquo; the Professor replied. Mrs.
Rheinholdt&rsquo;s story, by frequent repetition, had become a little more
coherent, a trifle more circumstantial, the perfection of simplicity and
utterly incomprehensible. Quest listened to it without remark and finally made
his way to the conservatory. He requested Mrs. Rheinholdt to walk with him
through the door by which she had entered, and stop at the precise spot where
the assault had been made upon her. There were one or two plants knocked down
from the tiers on the right-hand side, and some disturbance in the mould where
some large palms were growing. Quest and Lenora together made a close
investigation of the spot. Afterwards, Quest walked several times to each of
the doors leading into the gardens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are four entrances altogether,&rdquo; he remarked, as he lit a
cigar and glanced around the place. &ldquo;Two lead into the gardens&mdash;one
is locked and the other isn&rsquo;t&mdash;one connects with the back of the
house&mdash;the one through which you came, Mrs. Rheinholdt, and the other
leads into your reception room, into which you passed after the assault. I
shall now be glad if you will permit me to examine the gardens outside for a
few minutes, alone with my assistant, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For almost a quarter of an hour, Quest and Lenora disappeared. They all
looked eagerly at the criminologist on his return, but his face was sphinxlike.
He turned to Mrs. Rheinholdt, who with her son, the butler, and the Professor
were the only occupants of the conservatory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;that from the back part of
the house the quickest way to reach Mayton Avenue would be through this
conservatory and out of that door. There is a path leading from just outside
straight to a gate in the wall. Does any one that you know of use this means of
exit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rheinholdt shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The servants might occasionally,&rdquo; she remarked doubtfully,
&ldquo;but not on nights when I am receiving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The butler stepped forward. He was looking a little grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought, perhaps, to inform you, madam, and Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;that I did, only a short time ago, suggest to the
Professor&rsquo;s servant&mdash;the man who brought your mackintosh,
sir,&rdquo; he added, turning to the Professor&mdash;&ldquo;that he could, if
he chose, make use of this means of leaving the house. Mr. Craig is a personal
friend of mine, and a member of a very select little club we have for social
purposes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he follow your suggestion?&rdquo; Sanford Quest asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of that I am not aware, sir,&rdquo; the butler replied. &ldquo;I left
Mr. Craig with some refreshment, expecting that he would remain until my
return, but a few minutes later I discovered that he had left. I will enquire
in the kitchen if anything is known as to his movements.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried off. Quest turned to the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he been with you long, this man Craig, Professor?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>The Professor&rsquo;s smile was illuminating, his manner simple but
convincing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig,&rdquo; he asserted, &ldquo;is the best servant, the most
honest mortal who ever breathed. He would go any distance out of his way to
avoid harming a fly. I cannot even trust him to procure for me the simplest
specimens of insect or animal life. Apart from this, he is a man of some
property which he has no idea what to do with. He is, I think I may say, too
devoted to me to dream of ever leaving my service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think it would be out of the question, then,&rdquo; Quest asked,
&ldquo;to associate him with the crime?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor&rsquo;s confidence was sublime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could more readily associate you, myself, or young Mr. Rheinholdt
here with the affair,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>His words carried weight. The little breath of suspicion against the
Professor&rsquo;s servant faded away. In a moment or two the butler
returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears, madam,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;that Mr. Craig left
when there was only one person in the kitchen. He said good-night and closed
the door behind him. It is impossible to say, therefore, by which exit he left
the house, but personally I am convinced that, knowing of the reception here
to-night, he would not think of using the conservatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most unlikely, I should say,&rdquo; the Professor murmured.
&ldquo;Craig is a very shy man. He is at all times at your disposal, Mr. Quest,
if you should desire to question him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded absently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My assistant and I,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;would be glad to make
a further examination of the conservatory, if you will kindly leave us
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They obeyed without demur. Quest took a seat and smoked calmly, with his
eyes fixed upon the roof. Lenora went back to her examination of the overturned
plants, the mould, and the whole ground within the immediate environs of the
assault. She abandoned the search at last, however, and came back to
Quest&rsquo;s side. He threw away his cigar and rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing there?&rdquo; he asked laconically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; Lenora admitted.</p>
<p>Quest led the way towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;we are up against something big.
There&rsquo;s a new hand at work somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No theories yet, Mr. Quest?&rdquo; she asked, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the ghost of one,&rdquo; he admitted gloomily.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Along the rain-swept causeway of Mayton Avenue, keeping close to the shelter
of the houses, his mackintosh turned up to his ears, his hands buried in his
pockets, a man walked swiftly along. At every block he hesitated and looked
around him. His manner was cautious, almost furtive. Once the glare of an
electric light fell upon his face, a face pallid with fear, almost hopeless
with despair. He walked quickly, yet he seemed to have little idea as to his
direction. Suddenly he paused. He was passing a great building, brilliantly
lit. For a moment he thought that it was some place of entertainment. The
thought of entering seemed to occur to him. Then he felt a firm touch upon his
arm, a man in uniform spoke to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step inside, brother,&rdquo; he invited earnestly, almost eagerly,
notwithstanding his monotonous nasal twang. &ldquo;Step inside and find peace.
Step inside and the Lord will help you. Throw your burden away on the
threshold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s first impulse at being addressed had seemed to be one of
terror. Then he recognised the uniform and hesitated. The light which streamed
out from the building seemed warm and pleasant. The rain was coming down in
sheets. They were singing a hymn, unmusical, unaccompanied, yet something in
the unison of those human voices, one quality&mdash;the quality of earnestness,
of faith&mdash;seemed to make an irresistible appeal to the terrified wanderer.
Slowly he moved towards the steps. The man took him by the arm and led him in.
There were the best part of a hundred people taking their places after the
singing of the hymn. A girl was standing up before them on a platform. She was
commencing to speak but suddenly broke off. She held out her arms towards where
the Professor&rsquo;s confidential servant stood hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and tell us your sins,&rdquo; she called out. &ldquo;Come and
have them forgiven. Come and start a new life in a new world. There is no one
here who thinks of the past. Come and seek forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;Confess thy sins, my good man.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>For a moment this waif from the rain-swamped world hesitated. The light of
an infinite desire flashed in his eyes. Then he dropped his head. These things
might be for others. For him there was no hope. He shook his head to the girl
but sank into the nearest seat and on to his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He repents!&rdquo; the girl called out. &ldquo;Some day he will come!
Brothers and sisters, we will pray for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rain dashed against the windows. The only other sound from outside was
the clanging of the street cars. The girl&rsquo;s voice, frenzied, exhorting,
almost hysterical, pealed out to the roof. At every pause, the little gathering
of men and women groaned in sympathy. The man&rsquo;s frame was shaken with
sobs.</p>

<p class="first">Mr. Sanford Quest sat in his favourite easy-chair, his cigar
inclined towards the left hand corner of his mouth, his attention riveted upon
a small instrument which he was supporting upon his knee. So far as his
immobile features were capable of expression, they betrayed now, in the slight
parting of his lips and the added brightness of his eyes, symptoms of a lively
satisfaction. He glanced across the room to where Lenora was bending over her
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve done it this time, young woman,&rdquo; he declared
triumphantly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all O.K., working like a little
peach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora rose and came towards him. She glanced at the instrument which Quest
was fitting into a small leather case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that the pocket wireless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had Morrison out at Harlem all the morning to test
it,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent him at least half-a-dozen
messages from this easy-chair, and got the replies. How are you getting on with
the code?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so badly for a stupid person,&rdquo; Lenora replied.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not nearly so quick as Laura, of course, but I could make a
message out if I took time over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura, who had been busy with some papers at the further end of the room,
came over and joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, it&rsquo;s a dandy little affair, that, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she
exclaimed. &ldquo;I had a try with it, a day or so ago. Jim spoke to me from
Fifth Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got it tuned to a shade now,&rdquo; Quest declared.
&ldquo;Equipped with this simple little device, you can speak to me from
anywhere up to ten or a dozen miles. What are you working on this morning,
Laura?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same old stunt,&rdquo; the girl replied. &ldquo;I have been reading
up the records of the savants of New York. From what I can make out about them,
it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that there&rsquo;s one amongst the whole bunch
likely to have pluck enough to tamper with the Professor&rsquo;s
skeleton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest frowned a little gloomily. He rose to his feet and moved restlessly
about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, girls,&rdquo; he confessed, &ldquo;this is the first time in my
life I have been in a fix like this. Two cases on hand and nothing doing with
either of them. Criminologist, indeed! I guess I&rsquo;d better go over to
England and take a job at Scotland Yard. That&rsquo;s about what I&rsquo;m fit
for. Whose box is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest had paused suddenly in front of an oak sideboard which stood against
the wall. Occupying a position upon it of some prominence was a small black
box, whose presence there seemed to him unfamiliar. Laura came over to his side
and looked at it also in puzzled fashion.</p>
<p><a id="pic7" name="pic7"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

<p class="caption">The black box is introduced into the story.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;Never saw it before in my life,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Say, kid,
is this yours?&rdquo; she added, turning to Lenora.</p>
<p>Lenora shook her head. She, too, examined it a little wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t there a short time ago. I brought a duster and went
over the sideboard myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! No one else has been in the room, and it hasn&rsquo;t been
empty for more than ten minutes,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s
see what&rsquo;s inside, any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just be careful, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; Laura advised. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t get that box at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest pushed it with his forefinger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bomb inside, any way,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Here
goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted off the lid. There was nothing in the interior but a sheet of
paper folded up. Quest smoothed it out with his hand. They all leaned over and
read the following words, written in an obviously disguised hand:</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;You have embarked on a new study&mdash;anthropology.
What characteristic strikes you most forcibly in connection with it? Cunning?
The necklace might be where the skeleton is. Why not begin at the
beginning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The note was unsigned, but in the spot where a signature might have been
there was a rough pen drawing of two hands, with fingers extended, talon
fashion, menacingly, as though poised to strike at some unseen enemy. Quest,
after their first moment of stupefaction, whistled softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hands!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What hands?&rdquo; Lenora asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hands that gripped Mrs. Rheinholdt by the throat,&rdquo; he
reminded them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember? Hands without any
arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another brief, almost stupefied silence. Then Laura broke into
speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I want to know is,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;who brought the
thing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A most daring exploit, any way,&rdquo; Quest declared. &ldquo;If we
could answer your question, Laura, we could solve the whole riddle. We are up
against something, and no mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora shivered a little. The mystery of the thing terrified her, the
mystery which only stimulated her two companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hand which placed that box here,&rdquo; Quest continued slowly,
&ldquo;is capable of even more wonderful things. We must be cautious.
Hello!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door had opened. The Professor stood upon the threshold. He carried his
soft felt hat in his hand. He bowed to the two young women courteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust that I have done right in coming up?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Professor,&rdquo; Quest assured him. &ldquo;They know
well enough downstairs that I am always at liberty to you. Come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so anxious to learn,&rdquo; the Professor continued eagerly,
&ldquo;whether there is any news&mdash;of my skeleton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Professor, I am sorry to say,&rdquo; Quest replied.
&ldquo;Come in and shut the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor was obviously struggling with his disappointment. He did not,
however, at once close the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a young lady here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who caught me up
upon the landing. She, too, I believe, wishes to see you. My manners suffered,
I fear, from my eagerness to hear from your own lips if there was anything
fresh. I should have allowed her to precede me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw open the door and stood on one side. A young woman came a little
hesitatingly into the room. Her hair was plainly brushed back, and she wore the
severe dress of the Salvation Army. Nothing, however, could conceal the fact
that she was a remarkably sweet and attractive-looking young person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want to see me, young lady?&rdquo; Quest asked.</p>
<p>She held out a book.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Miss Quigg,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I want to ask you for
a subscription to our funds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest frowned a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about this house-to-house visitation,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only once a year that we come,&rdquo; the girl pleaded,
&ldquo;and we only go to people who we know can afford to help us, and who we
believe can appreciate our work. You know so much of the darker side of New
York, Mr. Quest. Wherever you go you must find signs of our labours. Even if I
put on one side, for a moment, the bare religious question, think how much we
do for the good and the welfare of the poor people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;You reach the
outcasts all right. There&rsquo;s many a one you save whom you had better leave
to die, but here and there, no doubt, you set one of them on their legs again
who&rsquo;s had bad luck. Very well, Miss Quigg. You shall have a donation. I
am busy to-day, but call at the same hour to-morrow and my secretary here shall
have a cheque ready for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled her gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very kind indeed, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;I
will be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor laid his hand upon her arm as she passed. He had been watching
her with curious intentness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;you seem very much in earnest
about your work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only the people in earnest, sir,&rdquo; she answered,
&ldquo;who can do any good in the world. My work is worth being in earnest
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you forgive an old man&rsquo;s question?&rdquo; the Professor
continued. &ldquo;I am one of the men of the world who are in earnest. My life
is dedicated to science. Science is at once my religion and my life. It seems
to me that you and I have something in common. You, too, move in the unusual
ways. Your life is dedicated to doing good amongst the unworthy of your sex.
Whether my brain approves of your efforts or not, you compel my
admiration&mdash;my most respectful admiration. May I, too, be
permitted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew out a pocket-book and passed over towards her a little wad of notes.
She took them without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation. Her eyes, as she thanked
him, were filled with gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is so kind of you,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;We never have any
hesitation in accepting money. May I know your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not necessary,&rdquo; the Professor answered. &ldquo;You can
enter me,&rdquo; he added, as he held open the door for her, &ldquo;as a
friend&mdash;or would you prefer a pseudonym?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pseudonym, if you please,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;We have so many
who send us sums of money as friends. Anything will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor glanced around the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What pseudonym shall I adopt?&rdquo; he ruminated. &ldquo;Shall I say
that an oak sideboard gives you five hundred dollars? Or a Chippendale sofa?
Or,&rdquo; he added, his eyes resting for a moment upon the little box,
&ldquo;a black box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls from the other side of the table started. Even Quest swung
suddenly around. The Professor, as though pleased with his fancy, nodded as his
fingers played with the lid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that will do very nicely,&rdquo; he decided. &ldquo;Put me
down&mdash;&lsquo;Black Box,&rsquo; five hundred dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl took out her book and began to write. The Professor, with a little
farewell bow, crossed the room towards Quest. Lenora moved towards the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see you out,&rdquo; she said to the girl pleasantly.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you find this collecting sometimes very hard
work?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Days like to-day,&rdquo; the girl replied, &ldquo;atone for
everything. When I think of the good that five hundred dollars will do, I feel
perfectly happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora opened the door. Both girls started. Only a few feet away Craig was
standing, his head a little thrust forward. For a moment the quiet self-respect
of his manner seemed to have deserted him. He seemed at a loss for words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; Lenora demanded.</p>
<p>Craig hesitated. His eyes were fixed upon the Salvation Army girl. The
changes in his face were remarkable. She, however, beyond smiling pleasantly at
him, gave no sign of any recognition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was waiting for my master,&rdquo; Craig explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not downstairs?&rdquo; Lenora asked suspiciously. &ldquo;You did
not come up with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am driving the Professor in his automobile,&rdquo; Craig explained.
&ldquo;It occurred to me that if he were going to be long here, I should have
time to go and order another tire. It is of no consequence, though. I will go
down and wait in the car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora stood at the top of the stairs and watched him disappear. Then she
went thoughtfully back to her work. The Professor and Quest were talking at the
farther end of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in hopes, in great hopes,&rdquo; the Professor admitted,
&ldquo;that you might have heard something. I promised to call at Mrs.
Rheinholdt&rsquo;s this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing to report at present, Mr. Ashleigh,&rdquo; he
announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me,&rdquo; the Professor murmured, &ldquo;this is very
disappointing. Is there no clue, Mr. Quest&mdash;no clue at all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the ghost of one,&rdquo; Quest acknowledged. &ldquo;I am as far
from solving the mystery of the disappearance of your skeleton and Mrs.
Rheinholdt&rsquo;s necklace, as I have ever been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor failed entirely to conceal his disappointment. His tone, in
fact, was almost peevish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have expected this from the regular officials of the law,
Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but I must say that in your hands I had
hoped&mdash;but there, there! Excuse me! I am an old man, Mr. Quest. I am
getting a little irritable. Disappointments affect me quickly. I must be
patient. I will be patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are certain evidences,&rdquo; Quest remarked, with his eyes
upon the black box, &ldquo;which seem to point to a new arrival in the criminal
world of New York. More than that I cannot tell you. I will simply ask you to
believe that I am doing my best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with that, Mr. Quest, I will be content,&rdquo; the Professor
promised. &ldquo;I will now pay my promised call upon Mrs. Rheinholdt. I shall
convey to her your assurance that everything that is possible is being done.
Good morning, young ladies,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;Good morning, Mr.
Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a courteous leave of them all and departed. Lenora crossed the room
to where Quest was seated at the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;do you believe in
inspiration?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I attribute a large amount of my success,&rdquo; Quest replied,
&ldquo;to my profound belief in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let me tell you,&rdquo; Lenora continued, &ldquo;that I have one
and a very strong one. Do you know that when I went to the door a few minutes
ago, the Professor&rsquo;s servant, Craig, was there, listening?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig?&rdquo; Quest repeated. &ldquo;Let me see, that was the man who
was at the Rheinholdts&rsquo; house the night of the robbery, and who might
have left through the conservatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did leave by it,&rdquo; Lenora declared. &ldquo;He is in a state
of panic at the present moment. What else do you suppose he was out there
listening for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor speaks very highly of him,&rdquo; Quest reminded
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor is just one of those amiable old idiots, absorbed in
his mouldy old work, who would never notice anything,&rdquo; Lenora persisted.
&ldquo;He is just the man to be completely hoodwinked by a clever
servant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is some sense in what the kid says,&rdquo; Laura remarked,
strolling up. &ldquo;The fact remains that Craig was one of the few men who
could have got at the necklace that night, and he is also one of the few who
knew about the skeleton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest sighed as he lit a cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a miserably obvious solution,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To tell
you the truth, girls, our friend Inspector French has had his men watching
Craig ever since the night of the robbery. What&rsquo;s that? Answer the
telephone, Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora obeyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Inspector French,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;He wants to
speak to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded, and held out his hand for the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, French,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Anything fresh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing much!&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;One of my men, though,
who has been up Mayton Avenue way, brought in something I found rather
interesting this morning. I want you to come round and see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go right ahead and tell me about it,&rdquo; Quest invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we&rsquo;ve been shadowing Craig,&rdquo; the Inspector
continued. &ldquo;Not much luck up till now. Fellow seems never to leave his
master&rsquo;s side. We have had a couple of men up there, though, and one of
them brought in a curious-looking object he picked up just outside the back of
the Professor&rsquo;s grounds. It&rsquo;s an untidy sort of neighbourhood, you
know&mdash;kind of waste ground they commenced to build over, and then the real
estate man who had it in hand, went smash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the thing?&rdquo; Quest asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I want to see whether you agree with me,&rdquo; French went on.
&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t come round, I&rsquo;ll come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No necessity,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got over
little difficulties of that sort. Laura, just tack on the phototelesme,&rdquo;
he added, holding the receiver away for a moment. &ldquo;One moment, French.
There, that&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; he added, as Laura, with deft fingers,
arranged what seemed to be a sensitised mirror to the instrument. &ldquo;Now,
French, hold up the article just in front of the receiver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>French&rsquo;s reply was a little brusque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you getting at, Quest?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;You are
not going to pretend that you can see from your room into this, are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll hold the object where I told you,&rdquo; Quest
replied, &ldquo;I can see it. I promise you that. There, that&rsquo;s right.
Hold it steady. I&rsquo;ve got the focus of it now. Say, French, where did you
say that was found?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just outside the Professor&rsquo;s back gates,&rdquo; French grunted,
&ldquo;but you&rsquo;re not kidding me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a finger from the Professor&rsquo;s skeleton you&rsquo;ve
got there,&rdquo; Quest interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How the blazes did you guess that?&rdquo; the Inspector demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kidding,&rdquo; Quest assured him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got a phototelesme at work here. I&rsquo;ve seen the bone all right. French,
this is interesting. I must think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest hung up the receiver and rang off. Then he turned towards his two
assistants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another finger from the Professor&rsquo;s skeleton,&rdquo; he
announced, &ldquo;has been found just outside his grounds. What do you suppose
that means?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig,&rdquo; Lenora declared confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig on your life,&rdquo; Laura echoed. &ldquo;Say, Mr. Quest,
I&rsquo;ve got an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get right ahead with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t the butler at Mrs. Rheinholdt&rsquo;s say that Craig
belonged to a servants&rsquo; club up town? I know the place well. Let me go
and see if I can&rsquo;t join and pick up a little information about the man.
He must have a night out sometimes. Let&rsquo;s find out what he does.
How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; Quest agreed. &ldquo;Get along, Laura. And you,
Lenora,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;put on your hat. We&rsquo;ll take a ride
towards Mayton Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">The exact spot where the bone of the missing skeleton was
discovered, was easily located. It was about twenty yards from a gate which led
into the back part of the Professor&rsquo;s grounds. The neighbourhood was
dreary in the extreme. There were half-finished houses, little piles of
building materials, heaps of stones, a watchman&rsquo;s shed, and all the
dreary paraphernalia of an abandoned building enterprise. Quest wasted very
little time before arriving at a decision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The discovery of the bone so near the Professor&rsquo;s house,&rdquo;
he decided, &ldquo;cannot be coincidence only. We will waste no time out here,
Lenora. We will search the grounds. Come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They advanced towards the gate but found it locked. The wall was unusually
high as though to obscure a view of anything that lay on the other side. Quest
noticed with interest that, in places where it had shown signs of crumbling
away, it had been repaired. He contemplated the lock thoughtfully and drew a
little instrument from his pocket, an instrument which had the appearance of a
many-sided key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like storming the fortress, eh?&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Here
goes, any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gate swung open with a single turn of the wrist. Quest glanced for a
moment at the lock and replaced the instrument in his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor&rsquo;s not looking for visitors,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;Gee! What a wilderness!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was hard to know which way to turn. Every path was choked with tangled
weeds and bushes. Here and there remained one or two wonderful old trees, but
the vegetation for the greater part consisted of laurel and other shrubs, which
from lack of attention had grown almost into a jungle. They wandered about
almost aimlessly for nearly half-an-hour. Then Quest came to a sudden
standstill. Lenora gripped his arm. They had both heard the same sound&mdash;a
queer, crooning little cry, half plaintive, half angry. Quest looked over his
right shoulder along a narrow, overgrown path which seemed to end abruptly in
an evergreen hedge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Lenora still clung to his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate this place,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;It terrifies me. What
are we looking for, Mr. Quest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say that I know exactly,&rdquo; the latter answered,
&ldquo;but I guess we&rsquo;ll find out where that cry came from. Sounded to me
uncommonly like a human effort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way up as far as the hedge, which they skirted for a few
yards until they found an opening. Then Quest gave vent to a little
exclamation. Immediately in front of them was a small hut, built apparently of
sticks and bamboos, with a stronger framework behind. The sloping roof was
grass-grown and entwined with rushes. The only apology for a window was a queer
little hole set quite close to the roof.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sort of place where the Professor might keep some of his
pets,&rdquo; Quest observed thoughtfully. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have a look
inside, any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a rude-looking door, but Quest, on trying it, found it locked.
They walked around the place but found no other opening. All the time from
inside they could hear queer, scuffling sounds. Lenora&rsquo;s cheeks grew
paler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must we stay?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I want
to see what&rsquo;s inside. Mr. Quest! Mr. Quest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clung to his arm. They were opposite the little aperture which served as
a window, and at that moment it suddenly framed the face of a creature, human
in features, diabolical in expression. Long hair drooped over one cheek, the
close-set eyes were filled with fury, the white teeth gleamed menacingly. Quest
felt in his pocket for his revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s some face!&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
hate to spoil it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he spoke, it disappeared. Quest took out the little gate opening
apparatus from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get inside there, Lenora,&rdquo; he announced,
stepping forward.</p>
<p>She followed him silently. A few turns of the wrist and the door yielded.
Keeping Lenora a little behind him, Quest gazed around eagerly. Exactly in
front of him, clad only in a loin cloth, with hunched-up shoulders, a necklace
around his neck, with blazing eyes and ugly gleaming teeth, crouched some
unrecognisable creature, human yet inhuman, a monkey and yet a man. There were
a couple of monkeys swinging by their tails from a bar, and a leopard chained
to a staple in the ground, walking round and round in the far corner, snapping
and snarling every time he glanced towards the new-comers. The creature in
front of him stretched out a hairy hand towards a club, and gripped it. Quest
drew a long breath. His eyes were set hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop that club,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>The creature suddenly sprang up. The club was waved around his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop it,&rdquo; Quest repeated firmly. &ldquo;You will sit down in
your corner. You will take no more notice of us. Do you hear? You will drop the
club. You will sit down in your corner. You will sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The club slipped from the hairy fingers. The tense frame, which had been
already crouched for the spring, was suddenly relaxed. The knees trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to that corner,&rdquo; Quest ordered, pointing.</p>
<p>Slowly and dejectedly, the ape-man crept to where he had been ordered and
sat there with dull, non-comprehending stare. It was a new force, this, a note
of which he had felt&mdash;the superman raising the voice of authority. Quest
touched his forehead and found it damp. The strain of those few seconds had
been intolerable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think these other animals will hurt,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have a look around the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The search took only a few moments. The monkeys ran and jumped around them,
gibbering as though with pleasure. The leopard watched them always with a snarl
and an evil light in his eye. They found nothing unusual until they came to the
distant corner, where a huge piano box lay on its side with the opening turned
to the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where the brute sleeps, I suppose,&rdquo; Quest remarked.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll turn it round, any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dragged it a few feet away from the wall, so that the opening faced
them. Then Lenora gave a little cry and Quest stood suddenly still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The skeleton!&rdquo; Lenora shrieked. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
skeleton!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest stooped down and drew away the matting which concealed some portion of
this strange-looking object. It was a skeleton so old that the bones had turned
to a dull grey. Yet so far as regards its limbs, it was almost complete. Quest
glanced towards the hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little fingers both missing,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
the skeleton all right, Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember the message!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;&lsquo;Where the
skeleton is, the necklace may be also.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned over everything in the place fruitlessly. There was no sign of
the necklace. At last they gave it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You get outside, Lenora,&rdquo; Quest directed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
just bring this beast round again and then we&rsquo;ll tackle the
Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora stepped back into the fresh air with a little murmur of relief. Quest
turned towards the creature which crouched still huddled up in its corner, its
eyes half-closed, rolling a little from side to side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>The creature obeyed. Once more its frame seemed to grow more virile and
natural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need sleep no longer,&rdquo; Quest said. &ldquo;Wake up and be
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effect of his words was instantaneous. Almost as he spoke, the creature
crouched for a spring. There was wild hatred in its close-set eyes, the snarl
of something fiend-like in its contorted mouth. Quest slipped quickly through
the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one may have that for a pet!&rdquo; he remarked grimly.
&ldquo;Come, Lenora, there&rsquo;s a word or two to be said to the Professor.
There&rsquo;s something here will need a little explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lit a cigar as they struggled back along the path. Presently they reached
the untidy-looking avenue, and a few minutes later arrived at the house. Quest
looked around him in something like bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, fancy keeping a big place like this, all overgrown and like a
wilderness!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;If the Professor can&rsquo;t afford a
few gardeners, why doesn&rsquo;t he take a comfortable flat down
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s a horrible place,&rdquo; Lenora agreed. &ldquo;I
hope I never come here again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well obsessed, these scientific men get,&rdquo; Quest
muttered. &ldquo;I suppose this is the front door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed under the portico and knocked. There was no reply. Quest
searched in vain for a bell. They walked round the piazza. There were no signs
of any human life. The windows were curtainless and displayed vistas of rooms
practically devoid of furniture. They came back to the front door. Quest tried
the handle and found it open. They passed into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hospitable sort of place, any way,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go in and wait, Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found their way to the study, which seemed to be the only habitable
room. Lenora glanced around at its strange contents with an expression almost
of awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy a man living in a muddle like this!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;Not a picture, scarcely a carpet, uncomfortable chairs&mdash;nothing but
bones and skeletons and mummies and dried-up animals. A man with tastes like
this, Mr. Quest, must have a very different outlook upon life from ordinary
human beings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He generally has,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Here comes our host, any
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A small motor-car passed the window, driven by Craig. The Professor
descended. A moment or two later he entered the room. He gazed from Quest to
Lenora at first in blank surprise. Then he held out his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have good news for me, my friends!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I
am sure of it. How unfortunate that I was not at home to receive you! Tell
me&mdash;don&rsquo;t keep me in suspense, if you please&mdash;you have
discovered my skeleton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have found the skeleton,&rdquo; Quest announced.</p>
<p>For a single moment the new-comer stood as though turned to stone. There was
a silence which was not without its curious dramatic significance. Then a light
broke across the Professor&rsquo;s face. He gave a great gulp of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My skeleton!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Mr. Quest, I knew it. You are
the greatest man alive. Now tell me quickly&mdash;I want to know everything,
but this first of all.&mdash;Where did you find the skeleton? Who was the
thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found the skeleton, Professor,&rdquo; Quest replied, &ldquo;within
a hundred yards of this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor&rsquo;s mouth was wide open. He looked like a bewildered
child. It was several seconds before he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Within a hundred yards of this house? Then it wasn&rsquo;t stolen by
one of my rivals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not,&rdquo; Quest admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Where exactly did you find it?&rdquo; the other insisted.</p>
<p>Quest was standing very still, his manner more reserved even than usual, his
eyes studying the Professor, weighing every spoken word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found it in a hut,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;hidden in a piano box. I
found there, also, a creature&mdash;a human being, I must call him&mdash;in a
state of captivity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hidden in a piano box?&rdquo; the Professor repeated wonderingly.
&ldquo;Why, you mean in Hartoo&rsquo;s sleeping box, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Mr. Hartoo is the gentleman who tried to club me, you are
right,&rdquo; Quest admitted. &ldquo;Mr. Ashleigh, before we go any further I
must ask you for an explanation as to the presence of that person in your
grounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor hesitated for a moment. Then he slowly crossed the room,
opened the drawer of a small escritoire, and drew out a letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard of Sir William Raysmore, the President of the Royal
Society?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This letter is from him,&rdquo; the Professor continued. &ldquo;You
had better read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The criminologist read it aloud. Lenora looked over his shoulder:&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;To Professor Edgar Ashleigh, New York.</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;My dear Professor,</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;Your communication gratifies and amazes me. I can say
no more. It fell to your lot to discover the skeleton of the anthropoid, a
marvellous thing, in its way, and needing only its corollary to form the
greatest discovery since the dark ages. Now you tell me that in the person of
Hartoo, the last of the Inyamo Race of South America, you have found that
corollary. You have supplied the missing link. You are in a position to give to
the world a definite and logical explanation of the evolution of man. Let me
give you one word of warning, Professor, before I write you at greater length
on this matter. Anthropologists are afflicted more, even, than any other race
of scientific men, with jealousy. Guard your secret well, lest the honour of
this discovery should be stolen from you.</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;William Raysmore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor nodded deliberately as Quest finished the letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, perhaps, you can understand,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;why it was
necessary to keep Hartoo absolutely hidden. In a month&rsquo;s time my papers
will be ready. Then I shall electrify the world. I shall write not a new page
but a new volume across the history of science. I shall&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was suddenly thrown open. Craig sprang in, no longer the
self-contained, perfect man-servant, but with the face of some wild creature.
His shout was one almost of agony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hut, Professor! The hut is on fire!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>His appearance on the threshold was like a flash. They heard his flying feet
down the hall, and without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation they all followed. The
Professor led the way down a narrow and concealed path, but when they reached
the little clearing in which the hut was situated, they were unable to approach
any nearer. The place was a whirlwind of flame. The smell of kerosene was
almost overpowering. The wild yell of the leopard rose above the strange,
half-human gibbering of the monkeys and the hoarse, bass calling of another
voice, at the sound of which Lenora and even Quest shuddered. Then, as they
came, breathless, to a standstill, they saw a strange thing. One side of the
hut fell in, and almost immediately the leopard with a mighty spring, leapt
from the place and ran howling into the undergrowth. The monkeys followed but
they came straight for the Professor, wringing their hands. They fawned at his
feet as though trying to show him their scorched bodies. Then for a single
moment they saw the form of the ape-man as he struggled to follow the others.
His strength failed him, however. He fell backwards into the burning chasm.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>The Professor bade them farewell, an hour later, on the steps of the house.
He seemed suddenly to have aged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done your best, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but Fate
has been too strong. Remember this, though. It is quite true that the cunning
of Hartoo may have made it possible for him to have stolen the skeleton and to
have brought it back to its hiding-place, but it was jealousy&mdash;cruel,
brutal, foul jealousy which smeared the walls of that hut with kerosene and set
a light to it. The work of a lifetime, my dreams of scientific immortality,
have vanished in those flames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned slowly away from them and re-entered the house. Quest and Lenora
made their way down the avenue and entered the automobile which was waiting for
them, almost in silence. The latter glanced towards his companion as they drove
off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this has been a bit tough for you,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to call somewhere and get you a glass of
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She tried to smile but her strength was almost gone. They drove to a
restaurant and sat there for a some little time. Lenora soon recovered her
colour. She even had courage to speak of the events of the afternoon when they
re-entered the automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;who do you suppose burned the
hut down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t say Craig, I suppose you will,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;I wonder whether Laura&rsquo;s had any luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were greeted, as they entered Quest&rsquo;s room, by a familiar little
ticking. Quest smiled with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the pocket wireless,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Let me
take down the message.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spelt it out to Lenora, who stood by his side:</p>
<p class="quote"><small>&ldquo;HAVE JOINED SERVANTS&rsquo; CLUB DISGUISED AS
YOUR BUTLER. CRAIG FREQUENT VISITOR HERE TEN YEARS AGO, COMES NOW OCCASIONALLY.
THURSDAY EVENINGS MOST LIKELY TIME. SHALL WAIT HERE ON CHANCE OF SEEING

<p class="caption">Quest and Lenora receive the message from Laura.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;Good girl, that,&rdquo; Quest remarked. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a rare
sticker, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away from the instrument and was crossing the room towards his
cigar cabinet. Suddenly he stopped. He looked intently towards the
sideboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Lenora asked.</p>
<p>He did not answer. She followed the direction of his gaze. Exactly in the
same spot as before reposed another but somewhat larger black box, of the same
shape and material as the previous one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, who put that there?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Lenora shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I locked the door when we went out,&rdquo; she assured him.</p>

<p class="caption">Quest is surprised at finding the stolen necklace in the

<br>
<p>Quest took the box into his hands and removed the lid. It seemed half full
of cotton-wool. On the top were a few lines of writing and beneath them the
signature of the parted hands. He read the form out slowly:</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;Drop all investigation. The hands that return these
jewels command it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest raised the cotton-wool. Beneath lay Mrs. Rheinholdt&rsquo;s
necklace!</p>

<br>
<h2><a name="ch5" id="ch5"></a>V.&mdash;AN OLD GRUDGE</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">Sanford Quest was smoking his after breakfast cigar with a
relish somewhat affected by the measure of his perplexities. Early though it
was, Lenora was already in her place, bending over her desk, and Laura, who had
just arrived, was busy divesting herself of her coat and hat. Quest watched the
latter impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Laura came forward, straightening her hair with her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No go,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I spent the evening in the club
and I talked with two men who knew Craig, but I couldn&rsquo;t get on to
anything. From all I could hear of the man, respectability is his middle
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Professor&rsquo;s own idea,&rdquo; Quest remarked
grimly. &ldquo;I merely ventured to drop a hint that Craig might not be quite
so immaculate as he seemed, and I never saw a man so horrified in my life. He
assured me that Craig was seldom out of his sight, that he hadn&rsquo;t a
friend in the world nor a single vicious taste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re fairly up against it, boss,&rdquo; Laura sighed.
&ldquo;The best thing we can do is to get on to another job. The Rheinholdt
woman has got her jewels back, or will have at noon to-day. I bet she
won&rsquo;t worry about the thief. Then the Professor&rsquo;s mouldy old
skeleton was returned to him, even if it was burnt up afterwards. I should take
on something fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t be done,&rdquo; Quest replied shortly. &ldquo;Look here,
girls, your average intellects are often apt to hit upon the truth, when a man
who sees too far ahead goes wrong. Rule Craig out. Any other possible person
occur to you?&mdash;Speak out, Lenora. You&rsquo;ve something on your mind, I
can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl swung around in her chair. There was a vague look of trouble upon
her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll laugh at me,&rdquo; she began
tentatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t hurt you if I do,&rdquo; Quest replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help thinking of Macdougal,&rdquo; Lenora continued
falteringly. &ldquo;He has never been recaptured, and I don&rsquo;t know
whether he&rsquo;s dead or alive. He had a perfect passion for jewels. If he is
alive, he would be desperate and would attempt anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest smoked in silence for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess the return of the jewels squelches the Macdougal
theory,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t be likely to part with the
stuff when he&rsquo;d once got his hands on it. However, I always meant, when
we had a moment&rsquo;s spare time, to look into that fellow&rsquo;s
whereabouts. We&rsquo;ll take it on straight away. Can&rsquo;t do any
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the section boss on the railway at the spot where he
disappeared,&rdquo; Laura announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then just take the train down to Mountways&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
nearest spot&mdash;and get busy with him,&rdquo; Quest directed. &ldquo;Try and
persuade him to loan us the gang&rsquo;s hand-car to go down the line. Lenora
and I will come on in the automobile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take you longer,&rdquo; Lenora remarked, as she moved off to put on
her jacket. &ldquo;The cars do it in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;Mrs.
Rheinholdt&rsquo;s coming here to identify her jewels at twelve o&rsquo;clock,
and I can&rsquo;t run any risk of there being no train back. You&rsquo;d better
be making good with the section boss. Take plenty of bills with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure! That&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo; Laura promised him.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be waiting for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried off and Quest commenced his own preparations. From his safe he
took one of the small black lumps of explosive to which he had once before owed
his life, and fitted it carefully in a small case with a coil of wire and an
electric lighter. He looked at his revolver and recharged it. Finally he rang
the bell for his confidential valet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;who else is here to-day besides
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one to-day, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well, perhaps,&rdquo; Quest observed. &ldquo;Listen, Ross. I
am going out now for an hour or two, but I shall be back at mid-day. Remember
that. Mrs. Rheinholdt and Inspector French are to be here at twelve
o&rsquo;clock. If by any chance I should be a few moments late, ask them to
wait. And, Ross, a young woman from the Salvation Army will call too. You can
give her this cheque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ross Brown, who was Quest&rsquo;s secretary-valet and general factotum,
accepted the slip of paper and placed it in an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no other instructions, sir?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll look out for the
wireless, and you had better switch the through cable and telegraph
communication on to headquarters. Come along, Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the house, entered the waiting automobile, and drove rapidly
towards the confines of the city. Quest was unusually thoughtful. Lenora, on
the other hand, seemed to have lost a great deal of her usual self composure.
She seldom sat still for more than a moment or two together. She was obviously
nervous and excited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s got hold of you, Lenora?&rdquo; Quest asked her once.
&ldquo;You seem all fidgets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced at him apologetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she confessed. &ldquo;If you knew of
the many sleepless nights I have had, of how I have racked my brain wondering
what could have become of James, you wouldn&rsquo;t really wonder that I am
excited now that there is some chance of really finding out. Often I have been
too terrified to sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We very likely shan&rsquo;t find out a thing,&rdquo; Quest reminded
her. &ldquo;French and his lot have had a try and come to grief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector French isn&rsquo;t like you, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; Lenora
ventured.</p>
<p>Quest laughed bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just now, at any rate, we don&rsquo;t seem to be any great
shakes,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;m glad we&rsquo;re on this
job. Much better to find out what has become of the fellow really, if we
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora&rsquo;s voice suddenly grew steady. She turned round in her place and
faced her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I like my work with you. You saved
me from despair. Sometimes it seems to me that life now opens out an entirely
new vista. Yet since this matter has been mentioned between us, let me tell you
one thing. I have known no rest, night or day, since we heard of&mdash;of
James&rsquo;s escape. I live in terror. If I have concealed it, it has been at
the expense of my nerves and my strength. I think that very soon I could have
gone on no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest&rsquo;s only reply was a little nod. Yet, notwithstanding his
imperturbability of expression, that little nod was wonderfully sympathetic.
Lenora leaned back in her place well satisfied. She felt that she was
understood.</p>
<p>By Quest&rsquo;s directions, the automobile was brought to a stand-still at
a point where it skirted the main railway line, and close to the section house
which he had appointed for his rendezvous with Laura. She had apparently seen
their approach and she came out to meet them at once, accompanied by a short,
thick-set man whom she introduced as Mr. Horan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mr. Horan, the section boss,&rdquo; she explained.</p>
<p>Mr. Horan shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ve heard of you, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;The young lady tells me you are some interested in that prisoner they
lost off the cars near here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Quest admitted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d like to go
to the spot if we could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s dead easy,&rdquo; the boss replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
take you along in the hand car. I&rsquo;ve been expecting you, Mr. Quest, some
time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; the criminologist asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Horan expelled a fragment of chewing tobacco and held out his hand for
the cigar which Quest was offering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been going the wrong way to work, these New York
police,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Just because there was a train on the other
track moving slowly, they got it into their heads that Macdougal had boarded it
and was back in New York somewhere. That ain&rsquo;t my theory. If I were
looking for James Macdougal, I&rsquo;d search the hillsides there. I&rsquo;ll
show you what I mean when we get alongside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right,&rdquo; Quest admitted. &ldquo;Anyway, we&rsquo;ll
start on the job.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The section boss turned around and whistled. From a little side track two
men jumped on to a hand-car, and brought it round to where they were standing.
A few yards away, the man who was propelling it&mdash;a great red-headed
Irishman&mdash;suddenly ceased his efforts. Leaning over his pole, he gazed at
Quest. A sudden ferocity darkened his coarse face. He gripped his mate by the
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See that bloke there?&rdquo; he asked, pointing at Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guy with the linen collar?&rdquo; the other answered. &ldquo;I
see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Quest, the detective,&rdquo; the Irishman went on
hoarsely. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man who got me five years in the pen, the
beast. That&rsquo;s the man I&rsquo;ve been looking for. You&rsquo;re my mate,
Jim, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; the other grunted. &ldquo;Are you going to try and
do him in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, you fellows,&rdquo; Horan shouted. &ldquo;What are you
hanging about there for, Red Gallagher? Bring the carriage up. You fellows can
go and have a smoke for an hour. I&rsquo;m going to take her down the line a
bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men obeyed and disappeared in the direction of the section house.
Quest looked after them curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big fellow,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;What did you
call him? Red Gallagher? I seem to have seen him before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the most troublesome fellow on the line once, although he was
the biggest worker,&rdquo; the boss replied. &ldquo;He got five years in the
penitentiary and that seems to have taken the spirit out of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I was in the case,&rdquo; Quest observed carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so! Now then, young ladies,&rdquo; Mr. Horan advised,
&ldquo;hold tight, and here goes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They ambled down the line for about half a mile. Then Horan brought them to
a standstill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the spot,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Now, if you want my
impressions, you are welcome to them. All the search has been made on the
right-hand side here, and in New York. I&rsquo;ve had my eye on that hill for a
long time. My impression is that he hid there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take your advice,&rdquo; Quest decided. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
spread out and take a little exercise in hill climbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good luck to you!&rdquo; the boss exclaimed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
excuse my waiting? It ain&rsquo;t a quarter of a mile back by the road, and
I&rsquo;m going a bit farther on, inspecting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest slipped something into his hand and the little party left the track,
crossed the road, scrambled down a bank and spread out. In front of them was a
slope some hundreds of feet high, closely overgrown with dwarf trees and
mountain shrubs. It was waste land, uncultivated and uninhabited. Quest made a
careful search of the shrubs and ground close to the spot which Horan had
indicated. He pointed out to his two companions the spot where the grass was
beaten down, and a few yards farther off where a twig had been broken off from
some overhanging trees, as though a man had pushed his way through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may have been done by the police search,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;or it may not. Don&rsquo;t spread out too far, girls, and go slowly. If
we find any trace of James Macdougal on this hill-side, we are going to find it
within fifty yards of this spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They searched carefully and deliberately for more than half an hour. Then
Lenora suddenly called out. They looked around to find only her head visible.
She scrambled up, muddy and with wet leaves clinging to her skirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that guy of a section boss told me to look out for caves.
I&rsquo;ve been in one, sure enough! Just saved myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried to where she was. Quest peered into the declivity down which
she had slipped. Suddenly he gave vent to a little exclamation. At the same
time Laura called out. An inch or two of tweed was clearly visible through the
strewn leaves. Quest, flat on his stomach, crawled a little way down, took out
his electric torch from his pocket and brushed the stuff away. Then he
clambered to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our search is over,&rdquo; he declared gravely, &ldquo;and your
troubles, Lenora. That is Macdougal&rsquo;s body. He may have slipped in as you
did, Laura, or he may have crept there to hide, and starved. Anyhow, it is
he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora&rsquo;s face sank into her hands for a moment. Quest stood on one
side while Laura passed her arm around the other girl&rsquo;s waist. Presently
he returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do no more,&rdquo; he pointed out; &ldquo;we must send for
help to bring the body up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall stay here, please,&rdquo; Lenora begged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;m foolish, please. I can&rsquo;t pretend I am sorry, but
I&rsquo;ll stay till some one comes and takes&mdash;it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is quite right,&rdquo; Laura declared, &ldquo;and I will stay
with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest glanced at his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to
get, but I&rsquo;ll send some one along. Cheer up, Lenora,&rdquo; he added
kindly. &ldquo;Look after her, Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet!&rdquo; that young woman declared brusquely.</p>
<p>Quest hastened along the road to the spot where he had left the car. The
chauffeur, who saw him coming, started up and climbed to his seat. Quest took
his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive to the office,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>The man slipped in his clutch. They were in the act of gliding off when
there was a tremendous report. They stopped short. The man jumped down and
looked at the back tire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow-out,&rdquo; he remarked laconically.</p>
<p>Quest frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long will it take?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four minutes,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got another
wheel ready. That&rsquo;s the queerest blow-out I ever saw, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men leaned over the tire. Suddenly Quest&rsquo;s expression changed.
His hand stole into his hip pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tom,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that wasn&rsquo;t a blow-out at all.
Look here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the small level hole. Almost at once he stood back and the
sunshine flashed upon the revolver clutched in his right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a bullet,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;Some one fired at that
tire. Tom, there&rsquo;s trouble about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked nervously around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a rifle bullet, sure,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>The car was drawn up by the side of the road, a few yards past the section
house. A little way farther up was the tool shed, and beyond, the tower house.
There was no one in sight at either of these places. On the other side of the
road were clumps of bushes, any one of which would prove sufficient for a man
in hiding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get on the wheel as quick as you can,&rdquo; Quest directed.
&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll give you a hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stooped down to unfasten the straps which held the spare wheel. It was
one of his rare lapses, realised a moment too late. Almost in his ears came the
hoarse cry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up, guvnor! Hands up this second or I&rsquo;ll blow you to
hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest glanced over his shoulder and looked into the face of Red Gallagher,
raised a little above the level of the road. He had evidently been hiding at
the foot of the perpendicular bank which divided the road from the track level.
A very ugly little revolver was pointed directly at Quest&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mate&rsquo;s got you covered on the other side of the road, too.
Hands up, both of you, or we&rsquo;ll make a quick job of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest shrugged his shoulders, threw his revolver into the road and obeyed.
As he did so, the other man stole out from behind a bush and sprang for the
chauffeur, who under cover of the car was stealing off. There was a brief
struggle, then the dull thud of the railway man&rsquo;s rifle falling on the
former&rsquo;s head. The chauffeur rolled over and lay in the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pitch him off in the bushes,&rdquo; Red Gallagher ordered. &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t want any one who comes by to see. Now lend me a hand with this
chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you propose to do with me?&rdquo; Quest asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll know soon enough,&rdquo; Red Gallagher answered.
&ldquo;A matter of five minutes&rsquo; talk, to start with. You see that
hand-car house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly well,&rdquo; Quest assented. &ldquo;My eyesight is quite
normal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get there, then. I&rsquo;m a yard behind you and my revolver&rsquo;s
pointing for the middle of your back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest looked at it anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the air, my red friend,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;of being
unaccustomed to those delicate weapons. Do keep your fingers off the trigger. I
will walk to the hand-car house and talk to you, with pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang lightly down from the road, crossed the few intervening yards and
stepped into the hand-car house.</p>
<p>Gallagher and his mate followed close behind. Quest paused on the
threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a filthy dirty hole,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t we have our little chat out here? Is it money you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallagher glanced around. Then with an ugly push of the shoulder he sent
Quest reeling into the shed. His great form blocked the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he cried fiercely, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not money I want this
time. Quest, you brute, you dirty bloodhound! You sent me to the pen for five
years&mdash;you with your cursed prying into other people&rsquo;s affairs.
Don&rsquo;t you remember me, eh? Red Gallagher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; Quest replied coolly. &ldquo;You garrotted and
robbed an old man and had the spree of your life. The old man happened to be a
friend of mine, so I took the trouble to see that you paid for it.
Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five years of hell, that&rsquo;s what I had,&rdquo; the man
continued, his eyes flashing, his face twitching with anger. &ldquo;Well,
you&rsquo;re going to have a little bit more than five years. This shed&rsquo;s
been burnt down twice&mdash;sparks from passing engines. It&rsquo;s going to be
burnt down for the third time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to make a bonfire of me, eh?&rdquo; Quest remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can sneer, my fine friend,&rdquo; the man growled.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve had a good many comfortable years of wearing fine clothes
and smoking twenty-five-cent cigars, swaggering about and hunting poor guys
that never did you any harm. This is where we are going to get a bit of our own
back. See here! We are locking this door&mdash;like that. It&rsquo;s a lonely
bit of the line. The man in the tower never takes his eyes off the signals and
there ain&rsquo;t a soul in sight. Me and my mate are off to the section house.
Two minutes will see us there and back. We&rsquo;re going to bring a can of oil
and an armful of waste. Can you tell what for, eh? We&rsquo;re going to burn
the place to a cinder in less than three minutes, and if you&rsquo;re alive
when the walls come down, we&rsquo;ll try a little rifle practise at you,
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds remarkably unpleasant,&rdquo; Quest admitted.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better hurry or the boss will be back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallagher finally slammed the door. Quest heard the heavy footsteps of the
two men as they turned towards the section house. He drew a little case from
his coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as well, perhaps,&rdquo; he said softly to himself, &ldquo;that
I perfected this instrument. It&rsquo;s rather close quarters here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened what seemed to be a little mahogany box, looked at the ball of
black substance inside, closed it up, placed it against the far wall, untwisted
the coil, stood back near the door and pressed the button. The result was
extraordinary. The whole of the far wall was blown out and for some distance in
front the ground was furrowed up by the explosion. Quest replaced the
instrument in his pocket, sprang through the opening and ran for the tower
house. Behind him, on its way to New York, he could see a freight train coming
along. He could hear, too, Red Gallagher&rsquo;s roar of anger. It was less
than fifty yards, yet already, as he reached the shelter of the tower, the
thunder of the freight sounded in Quest&rsquo;s ears. He glanced around. Red
Gallagher and his mate were racing almost beside it towards him. He rushed up
the narrow stairs into the signal room, tearing open his coat to show his
official badge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop the freight,&rdquo; he shouted to the operator. &ldquo;Quick!
I&rsquo;m Sanford Quest, detective&mdash;special powers from the chief
commissioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man moved to the signal. Another voice thundered in his ears. He turned
swiftly around. The Irishman&rsquo;s red head had appeared at the top of the
staircase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop that signal and I&rsquo;ll blow you into bits!&rdquo; he
shouted.</p>
<p>The operator hesitated, dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk towards me,&rdquo; Gallagher shouted. &ldquo;Look here, you guy,
this&rsquo;ll show you whether I&rsquo;m in earnest or not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bullet passed within a few inches of the operator&rsquo;s head. He came
slowly across the room. Below they could hear the roar of the freight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ain&rsquo;t your job,&rdquo; the Irishman continued savagely.
&ldquo;We want the cop, and we&rsquo;re going to have him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest had stolen a yard or two nearer during this brief colloquy.
Gallagher&rsquo;s mate from behind shouted out a warning just a second too
late. With a sudden kick, Quest sent the revolver flying across the room, and
before the Irishman could recover, he struck him full in the face.
Notwithstanding his huge size and strength, Gallagher reeled. The operator, who
had just begun to realize what was happening, flung himself bodily against the
two thugs. A shot from the tangled mass of struggling limbs whistled past
Quest&rsquo;s head as he sprang to the window which overlooked the track. The
freight had already almost passed. Quest steadied himself for a supreme effort,
crawled out on to the little steel bridge and poised himself for a moment. The
last car was just beneath. The gap between it and the previous one was slipping
by. He set his teeth and jumped on to the smooth top. For several seconds he
struggled madly to keep his balance. He felt himself slipping every minute down
to the ground which was spinning by. Then his right heel caught a bare ledge,
scarcely an inch high. It checked his fall. He set his teeth, carefully
stretched out his hand and gripped the back of the car. Then his knee touched
something&mdash;a chain. He caught it with his other hand. He lay there,
crouching, gripping wherever he could, his fingernails breaking, an intolerable
pain in his knee, death spinning on either side of him&hellip;.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Back behind the tower, Red Gallagher and his mate bent with horrified faces
over the body of the signalman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the hell did you want to plug him for?&rdquo; the latter
muttered. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t in the show at all. You&rsquo;ve done us, Red!
He&rsquo;s cooked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Red Gallagher staggered to his feet. Already the horror of the murderer was
in his eyes as he glanced furtively around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never meant to drop him,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I got mad at
seeing Quest get off. That man&rsquo;s a devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo; the other demanded hoarsely.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a quiet spot this, but there&rsquo;ll be some one round
before long. There goes the damned signals already!&rdquo; he exclaimed, as the
gong sounded in the tower.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the auto,&rdquo; Gallagher shouted. &ldquo;Come on.
Come on, man! I can fix the tire. If we&rsquo;ve got to swing for this job,
we&rsquo;ll have something of our own back first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crawled to the side of the road. Gallagher&rsquo;s rough, hairy fingers
were still trembling, but they knew their job. In a few minutes the tire was
fixed. Clumsily but successfully, the great Irishman turned the car round away
from the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a hummer,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll make her
go when we get the hang of it. Sit tight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drove clumsily off, gathering speed at every yard. Behind, in the
shadow of the tower, the signalman lay dead. Quest, half way to New York,
stretched flat on his stomach, was struggling for life with knees and hands and
feet.</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">Mrs. Rheinholdt welcomed the Inspector with a beaming smile as
he stepped out of his office and approached her automobile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nice of you to be so punctual, Mr. French,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
making room for him by her side. &ldquo;Will you tell the man to drive to Mr.
Quest&rsquo;s house in Georgia Square?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector obeyed and took his place in the luxurious limousine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautifully punctual we are!&rdquo; she continued, glancing at
the clock. &ldquo;Inspector, I am so excited at the idea of getting my jewels
back. Isn&rsquo;t Mr. Quest a wonderful man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a clever chap, all right,&rdquo; the Inspector admitted.
&ldquo;All the same, I&rsquo;m rather sorry he wasn&rsquo;t able to lay his
hands on the thief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s your point of view, of course,&rdquo; Mrs. Rheinholdt
remarked. &ldquo;I can think of nothing but having my diamonds back. I feel I
ought to go and thank the Professor for recommending Mr. Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector made no reply. Mrs. Rheinholdt was suddenly aware that she was
becoming a little tactless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; she sighed, &ldquo;it is disappointing not to be
able to lay your hands upon the thief. That is where I suppose you must find
the interference of an amateur like Mr. Quest a little troublesome sometimes.
He gets back the property, which is what the private individual wants, but he
doesn&rsquo;t secure the thief, which is, of course, the real end of the case
from your point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a queer affair about these jewels,&rdquo; the Inspector
remarked. &ldquo;Quest hasn&rsquo;t told me the whole story yet. Here we are on
the stroke of time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The car drew up outside Quest&rsquo;s house. The Inspector assisted his
companion to alight and rang the bell at the front door. There was a somewhat
prolonged pause. He rang again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never knew this to happen before,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;That
sort of secretary-valet of Mr. Quest&rsquo;s&mdash;Ross Brown, I think he calls
him&mdash;is always on the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They waited for some time. There was still no answer to their summons. The
Inspector placed his ear to the keyhole. There was not a sound to be heard. He
drew back, a little puzzled. At that moment his attention was caught by the
fluttering of a little piece of white material caught in the door. He pulled it
out. It was a fragment of white embroidery, and on it were several small
stains. The Inspector looked at them and looked at his fingers. His face grew
suddenly grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that there&rsquo;s been some
trouble here. I shall have to take a liberty. If you&rsquo;ll excuse me, Mrs.
Rheinholdt, I think it would be better if you waited in the car until I send
out for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think the jewels have been stolen again?&rdquo; she
gasped.</p>
<p>The Inspector made no reply. He had drawn from his pocket a little pass-key
and was fitting it into the lock. The door swung open. Once more they were both
conscious of that peculiar silence, which seemed to have in it some unnamable
quality. He moved to the foot of the stairs and shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! Any one there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply. He opened the doors of the two rooms on the right hand
side, where Quest, when he was engaged in any widespread affair, kept a
stenographer and a telegraph operator. Both rooms were empty. Then he turned
towards Quest&rsquo;s study on the left hand side. French was a man of iron
nerve. He had served his time in the roughest quarters of New York. He had
found himself face to face with every sort of crime, yet as he opened that
door, he seemed to feel some premonition of what was to come. He stepped across
the threshold. No power on earth could have kept back the cry which broke from
his lips.</p>
<p>The curtains of the window which looked out on to the street, were drawn,
and the light was none too good. It was sufficient for him, however, to see
without difficulty the details of a ghastly tragedy. A few feet away from the
door was stretched the body of the secretary-valet. On the other side of the
room, lying as though she had slipped from the sofa, her head fallen on one
side in hideous fashion, was the body of Miss Quigg, the Salvation Army young
woman. French set his teeth and drew back the curtains. In the clearer light,
the disorder of the room was fully revealed. There had been a terrible
struggle. Between whom? How?</p>
<p>There was suddenly a piercing shriek. The Inspector turned quickly around.
Mrs. Rheinholdt, who had disregarded his advice, was standing on the
threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What has happened? Oh, my
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She covered her face with her hands. French gripped her by the arm. At that
moment there was the sound of an automobile stopping outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep quiet for a moment,&rdquo; the Inspector whispered in her ear.
&ldquo;Pull yourself together, madam. Go to the other end of the room.
Don&rsquo;t look. Stay there for a few moments and then get home as quick as
you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed him mutely, pressing her hands to her eyes, shivering in every
limb. French stood back inside the room. He heard the front door open, he heard
Quest&rsquo;s voice outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ross! Where the devil are you, Ross?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no reply. The door was pushed open. Quest entered, followed by the
Professor and Craig. The Inspector stood watching their faces. Quest came to a
standstill before he had passed the threshold. He looked upon the floor and he
looked across to the sofa. Then he looked at French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>The Professor pushed past. He, too, looked around the room, and gazed at the
two bodies with an expression of blank and absolute terror. Then he fell back
into Craig&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poor girl!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Horrible! Horrible!
Horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig led him for a moment to one side. The Professor was overcome and
almost hysterical. Quest and French were left face to face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know anything about this?&rdquo; Quest asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; the Inspector replied. &ldquo;We arrived, Mrs.
Rheinholdt and I, at five minutes past twelve. There was no answer to our ring.
I used my pass-key and entered. This is what I found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest stood over the body of his valet for a moment. The man was obviously
dead. The Inspector took his handkerchief and covered up the head. A few feet
away was a heavy paper-weight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killed by a blow from behind,&rdquo; French remarked grimly,
&ldquo;with that little affair. Look here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They glanced down at the girl. Quest&rsquo;s eyebrows came together quickly.
There were two blue marks upon her throat where a man&rsquo;s thumbs might have
been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hands again!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>The Inspector nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you make anything of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; Quest confessed. &ldquo;I must think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector glanced at him curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where on earth have you been to?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been to?&rdquo; Quest repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look in the mirror!&rdquo; French suggested.</p>
<p>Quest glanced at himself. His collar had given way, his tie was torn, a
button and some of the cloth had been wrenched from his coat, his trousers were
torn, he was covered with dust.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you about my trouble a little later on,&rdquo; he
replied. &ldquo;Say, can&rsquo;t we keep those girls out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were too late. Laura and Lenora were already upon the threshold. Quest
swung round towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girls,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there has been some trouble here. Go
and wait upstairs, Lenora, or sit in the hall. Laura, you had better telephone
to the police station, and for a doctor. That&rsquo;s right, isn&rsquo;t it,
Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; the latter assented thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Lenora, white to the lips, staggered a few feet back into the hall. Laura
set her teeth and lingered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that Ross?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s his body,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been
murdered here, he and the Salvation Army girl who was to come this morning for
her cheque.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura turned away, half dazed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have trusted Ross with my life,&rdquo; Quest continued,
&ldquo;but he must have been alone in the house when the girl came. Do you
suppose it was the usual sort of trouble?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector French stooped down and picked up the paper-weight. Across it was
stamped the name of Sanford Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This yours, Quest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; Quest answered. &ldquo;Everything in the room
is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl would fight to defend herself,&rdquo; the Inspector remarked
slowly, &ldquo;but she could never strike a man such a blow as your valet died
from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more he stooped and picked up a small clock. It had stopped at
eleven-fifteen. He looked at it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to ask you a
question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Quest replied, looking quickly up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you at eleven-fifteen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On tower Number 10 of the New York Central, scrapping for my
life,&rdquo; Quest answered grimly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve reason to remember
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the Inspector&rsquo;s steady gaze seemed to inspire the
criminologist suddenly with a new idea. He came a step forward, a little frown
upon his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, French,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t&mdash;you
don&rsquo;t suspect me of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>French was unmoved. He looked Quest in the eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<h2><a name="ch6" id="ch6"></a>VI.&mdash;ON THE RACK</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">For the moment a new element had been introduced into the
horror of the little tableau. All eyes were fixed upon Quest, who had listened
to the Inspector&rsquo;s dubious words with a supercilious smile upon his
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he suggested, &ldquo;you would like to ask me a few
questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I may feel it my duty to do so,&rdquo; the Inspector replied
gravely. &ldquo;In the first place, then, Mr. Quest, will you kindly explain
the condition of your clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest looked down at himself quickly. More than ever he realised the
significance of his dishevelled appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I travelled from number ten tower, just outside New York, on top of a
freight car,&rdquo; he said grimly. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t a very comfortable
ride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you will explain what made you take it, then?&rdquo; the
Inspector continued.</p>
<p>Quest shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, then,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;This morning I decided
to make an attempt to clear up the mystery of Macdougal&rsquo;s disappearance.
I sent on my secretary, Miss Laura, to make friends with the section boss, and
Lenora and I went out by automobile a little later. We instituted a search on a
new principle, and before very long we found Macdougal&rsquo;s body.
That&rsquo;s one up against you, I think, Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; the Inspector observed. &ldquo;Go on,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left the two young ladies, at Miss Lenora&rsquo;s wish, to
superintend the removal of the body. I myself had an engagement to deliver over
her jewels to Mrs. Rheinholdt here at mid-day. I returned to where my
automobile was waiting, started for the city and was attacked by two thugs near
the section house. I got away from them, ran to the tower house to try and stop
the freight, was followed by the thugs, and jumped out on to the last car from
the signal arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a id="pic11" name="pic11"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

<div align="center"><img src="1202801h-images/TheBlackBox11.jpg" title=
"A man in a suit hangs between a trestle and a train.">
<p class="caption">Quest jumps from the signal tower on to the fast-moving
train.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>There was a dead silence. Quest began quietly to dust his clothes. The
Inspector stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Quest paused in his task and laid down the brush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any more questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your automobile?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No idea,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;I left it in the road. When I
jumped from the freight car, I took a taxicab to the Professor&rsquo;s and
called for him, as arranged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is perfectly true,&rdquo; the Professor intervened. &ldquo;Mr.
Quest called for us, as arranged previously, at ten minutes to
twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The inspector nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to ask you to excuse me for a moment,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;while I ring up Number 10 signal tower. If Mr. Quest&rsquo;s story
receives corroboration, the matter is at an end. Where shall I find a
telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In every room in the house,&rdquo; Quest answered shortly.
&ldquo;There is one outside in the passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector left the room almost immediately. The Professor crossed to
Quest&rsquo;s side. A kindly smile parted his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;our friend the
Inspector&rsquo;s head has been turned a little, beyond doubt, by these
horrible happenings! Permit me to assure you, for one, that I look upon his
insinuations as absurd.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a id="pic12" name="pic12"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="1202801h-images/TheBlackBox12.jpg" title=
"Quest sits at a table, oblivious to the hands behind him.">
<p class="caption">A pair of mysterious hands place the black box on
Quest&rsquo;s table.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;The man has gone off his head!&rdquo; Laura declared angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be all right directly he comes back,&rdquo; Lenora whispered,
laying her hand upon Quest&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only some one would give me my jewels and let me go!&rdquo; Mrs.
Rheinholdt moaned.</p>
<p>The door opened and the Inspector reappeared. He was looking graver than
ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quest,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;your alibi is useless&mdash;in
fact a little worse than useless. The operator at Number 10 has been found
murdered at the back of his tower!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest started.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought not to have left him to those thugs,&rdquo; he murmured
regretfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no automobile of yours in the vicinity,&rdquo; the Inspector
continued, &ldquo;nor any news of it. I think it will be as well now, Quest,
for this matter to take its obvious course. Will you, first of all, hand over
her jewels to Mrs. Rheinholdt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest drew the keys of the safe from his pocket, crossed the room and swung
open the safe door. For a moment afterwards he stood transfixed. His arm, half
outstretched, remained motionless. Then he turned slowly around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The jewels have been stolen,&rdquo; he announced with unnatural
calm.</p>

<p class="caption">When Quest goes to the safe to produce<br>

</div>
<br>
<p>Mrs. Rheinholdt pushed her way forward, wringing her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stolen again?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mr. Quest!
Inspector!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were there,&rdquo; Quest declared, &ldquo;when I left the house
this morning. It seems probable,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that the same person
who is responsible for this double tragedy has also taken the
jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector laid his hand heavily upon Quest&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does seem as though that might be so,&rdquo; he assented grimly.
&ldquo;You will kindly consider yourself under arrest, Quest. Ladies and
gentlemen, will you clear the room now, if you please? The ambulance I
telephoned for is outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a id="pic14" name="pic14"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="1202801h-images/TheBlackBox14.jpg" title=
"Several people stand around looking shocked.">
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Mr. Quest, your alibi has been found with a
bullet<br>
in his brain. I must put you under arrest.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>The Professor, who had been looking on as though dazed, suddenly
intervened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. French,&rdquo; he said earnestly, &ldquo;I am convinced that you
are making a great mistake. In arresting and taking away Mr. Quest, you are
removing from us the one man who is likely to be able to clear up this
mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector pushed him gently on one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will excuse me, Professor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but this is no
matter for argument. If Mr. Quest can clear himself, no one will be more glad
than I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Inspector will have his little joke,&rdquo; he observed drily.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, girls. Keep cool,&rdquo; he went on, as he saw the
tears in Lenora&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;Come round and see me in the Tombs, one of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can be of any assistance,&rdquo; the Professor exclaimed,
&ldquo;I trust that you will not fail to call upon me, Mr. Quest. I repeat,
Inspector,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I am convinced that you are making a very
grave mistake. Mrs. Rheinholdt, you must let me take you home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My jewels!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;Just as they had been recovered,
too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lady,&rdquo; the Professor reminded her, with a faint air of
reproach in his tone, &ldquo;I think we must remember that we are in the
presence of a graver tragedy than the loss of a few jewels.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>The ambulance men came and departed with their grim burden, the room on the
ground floor was locked and sealed, and the house was soon empty except for the
two girls. Towards three o&rsquo;clock, Lenora went out and returned with a
newspaper. She opened it out upon the table and they both pored over
it.&mdash;</p>
<p class="headline">WELL-KNOWN CRIMINOLOGIST ARRESTED FOR DOUBLE TRAGEDY!</p>
<p class="newspaper">&ldquo;Sanford Quest, the famous New York criminologist,
was arrested at noon to-day, charged with the murder of his valet, Ross Brown,
and Miss Quigg, Salvation Army canvasser. The crime seems to be mixed up in
some mysterious fashion with others. John D. Martin, of signal tower Number 10,
offered by Quest as an alibi, was found dead behind his tower. Quest claimed
that he travelled from the signal tower to New York on a freight train, leaving
his automobile behind, but neither machine nor chauffeur have been
discovered.</p>
<p class="newspaper">&ldquo;Justice Thorpe has refused to consider
bail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a guy, that Justice Thorpe, and so&rsquo;s the idiot who
wrote this stuff!&rdquo; Laura exclaimed, thrusting the paper away from her.
&ldquo;I guess the Professor was dead right when he told French he was locking
up the one man who could clear up the whole show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora nodded thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor spoke up like a man,&rdquo; she agreed, &ldquo;but,
Laura, I want to ask you something. Did you notice his servant&mdash;that man
Craig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t say I did particularly,&rdquo; Laura admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twice,&rdquo; Lenora continued, &ldquo;I thought he was going to
faint. I tell you he was scared the whole of the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you getting at, kid?&rdquo; Laura demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Craig, if I can,&rdquo; Lenora replied, moving towards the
telephone. &ldquo;Please give me the phototelesme. I am going to talk to the
Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura adjusted the mirror to the instrument and Lenora rang up. The
Professor himself answered the call.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you seen the three o&rsquo;clock edition, Professor?&rdquo;
Lenora asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never read newspapers, young lady,&rdquo; the Professor
replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you what they say about Mr. Quest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora commenced a rambling account of what she had read in the newspaper.
All the time the eyes of the two girls were fixed upon the mirror. They could
see the Professor seated in his chair with two huge volumes by his side, a pile
of manuscript, and a pen in his hand. They could even catch the look of
sympathy on his face as he listened attentively. Suddenly Lenora almost broke
off. She gripped Laura by the arm. The door of the study had been opened
slowly, and Craig, carrying a bundle, paused for a moment on the threshold. He
glanced nervously towards the Professor, who seemed unaware of his entrance.
Then he moved stealthily towards the fireplace, stooped down and committed
something to the flames. The relief on his face, as he stood up, was
obvious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I can do for Mr. Quest, young lady, I will,&rdquo; the Professor
promised. &ldquo;If you will forgive my saying so, you are a little
over-excited just now. Take my advice and rest for a short time. Call round and
see me whenever you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid the receiver down and the reflection on the mirror faded away.
Lenora started up and hastily put on her coat and hat, which were still lying
on the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going right down to the Professor&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she
announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think you can do there?&rdquo; Laura asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to see if I can find out what that man burnt,&rdquo; she
replied. &ldquo;I will be back in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura walked with her as far as the street car, and very soon afterwards
Lenora found herself knocking at the Professor&rsquo;s front door. Craig
admitted her almost at once. For a moment he seemed to shiver as he recognised
her. The weakness, however, was only momentary. He showed her into the study
with grave deference. The Professor was still immersed in his work. He greeted
her kindly, and with a little sigh laid down his pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;have you thought of
something I can do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took no notice of the chair to which he pointed, and rested her hand
upon his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;go and see Mr. Quest! He is in
the Tombs prison. It would be the kindest thing any one could possibly
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor glanced regretfully at his manuscript, but he did not
hesitate. He rose promptly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you think he would appreciate it, I will go at once,&rdquo; he
decided.</p>
<p>Her face shone with gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is really very kind of you, Professor,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will send for my coat and we will go together, if you like,&rdquo;
he suggested.</p>
<p>She smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going the other way, back to Georgia Square,&rdquo; she
explained. &ldquo;No, please don&rsquo;t ring. I can find my own way
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried from the room. Outside in the hall she paused, for a moment,
listening with beating heart. By the side wall was a hat rack with branching
pegs, from which several coats were hanging. She slipped quietly behind their
shelter. Presently the Professor came out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My coat, please, Craig,&rdquo; she heard him say.</p>
<p>Her heart sank. Craig was coming in her direction. Her discovery seemed
certain. Then, as his hand was half stretched out to remove one of the
garments, she heard the Professor&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think that I shall walk, Craig. I have been so much upset to-day
that the exercise will do me good. I will have the light coat from my
bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the shock of relief was so great that she almost lost
consciousness. A moment or two later she heard the Professor leave the house.
Very cautiously she stole out from her hiding place. The hall was empty. She
crossed it with noiseless footsteps, slipped into the study and moved
stealthily to the fireplace. There was a little heap of ashes in one distinct
spot. She gathered them up in her handkerchief and secreted it in her dress.
Then she moved hurriedly towards the door and stepped quietly behind the
curtain. She stood there listening intently. Craig was doing something in the
hall. Even while she was hesitating, the door was opened. He came in and moved
towards his master&rsquo;s table. Through a chink in the curtain she could see
that he was stooping down, collecting some letters. She stole out, ran down the
hall, opened the front door and hastened down the avenue. Her heart was beating
quickly. The front door handle had slipped from her fingers, and it seemed to
her that she could hear even now the slam with which it had swung to. At the
gates she looked back. There were no signs of life. The house still bore its
customary appearance, gloomy and deserted. With a sigh of relief, she hailed a
taxicab and sank back into the corner.</p>
<p>She found Laura waiting for her, and a few minutes afterwards the two girls
were examining the ashes with the aid of Quest&rsquo;s microscope. Among the
little pile was one fragment at the sight of which they both exclaimed. It was
distinctly a shred of charred muslin embroidery. Lenora pointed towards it
triumphantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that evidence?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
ring up Inspector French!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura shook her head doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; she advised. &ldquo;French is a good sort in his
way, but he&rsquo;s prejudiced just now against the boss. I&rsquo;m not sure
that this evidence would go far by itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s evidence enough for us to go for Craig, though! What we
have got to do is to get a confession out of him, somehow!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura studied her companion, for a moment, curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Taking some interest in Mr. Quest, kid, ain&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora looked up. Then her head suddenly sank into her hands. She knew quite
well that her secret had escaped her. Laura patted her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, child,&rdquo; she said soothingly.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see him through this, somehow or other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo; Lenora faltered, without raising her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; she replied promptly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not looking for
trouble of that sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora raised her head. There was an immense relief in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so glad,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I was afraid
sometimes&mdash;living here with him, you know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura interrupted her with an easy laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry,&rdquo; she assured her.</p>
<p>Lenora rose to her feet. She was quite herself again. There was a new look
of determination in her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura,&rdquo; she exclaimed, &ldquo;we will save Mr. Quest and we
will get hold of Craig! I have a plan. Listen.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">Craig&rsquo;s surprise was real enough as he opened the back
door of the Professor&rsquo;s house on the following morning and found Lenora
standing on the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, Miss Lenora,&rdquo; he apologised. &ldquo;The front
door bell must be out of order. I certainly didn&rsquo;t hear it ring. Mr.
Ashleigh is in his study, if you wish to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora smiled pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I really do not want
to see him,&mdash;at least, not just yet. I came to this door because I wanted
a little talk with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig&rsquo;s attitude was perfect. He was mystified, but he remained
respectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come inside?&rdquo; he invited.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she confided, &ldquo;of what I am going to say
being overheard. Come with me down to the garage for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed to the wooden building which stood about fifty yards away from
the house. Craig hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you wish it, miss,&rdquo; he assented doubtfully. &ldquo;I will
get the keys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared for a moment and came out again almost immediately afterwards
with a bunch of keys in his hand. He seemed a little disturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doing as you wish, Miss Lenora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but there
is nobody about here likely to overhear, and I have no secrets from my
master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; Lenora replied, &ldquo;but I have. The Professor
is a dear,&rdquo; she added hastily, &ldquo;but he is too wrapped up in his
scientific work to be able to see things like men of ordinary
common-sense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; Craig admitted. &ldquo;Mr. Ashleigh has
only one idea in his life&hellip;. This way, then, if you please,
miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door of the garage, leaving the keys in the lock, and they
both passed inside. The place was gloomy and lit only by a single narrow window
near the roof. The only vehicle it contained was the Professor&rsquo;s little
car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can say what you please here without the slightest fear of being
overheard, miss,&rdquo; Craig remarked.</p>
<p>Lenora nodded, and breathed a prayer to herself. She was nearer the door
than Craig by about half-a-dozen paces. Her hand groped in the little bag she
was carrying and gripped something hard. She clenched her teeth for a moment.
Then the automatic pistol flashed out through the gloom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig,&rdquo; she threatened, &ldquo;if you move I shall shoot
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as though the man were a coward. He began to tremble, his lips
twitched, his eyes grew larger and rounder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he faltered. &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this,&rdquo; Lenora said firmly. &ldquo;I suspect you to be
guilty of the crime for which Sanford Quest is in prison. I am going to have
you questioned. If you are innocent, you have nothing to fear. If you are
guilty, there will be some one here before long who will extract the truth from
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face was an epitome of terror. Even his knees shook. Lenora
felt herself grow calmer with every moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going outside to send a message,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I
shall return presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; he begged suddenly. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t leave
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew a step nearer. Once more the few inches of blue steel flashed out
between them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of your games,&rdquo; she warned him. &ldquo;I am in earnest,
and I am not afraid to shoot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come any nearer,&rdquo; he promised, &ldquo;but listen!
I am innocent&mdash;I have done nothing wrong. If you keep me here, you will do
more harm than you can dream of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for other people to decide about your innocence,&rdquo; Lenora
said calmly. &ldquo;I have nothing to do with that. If you are wise, you will
stop here quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you said anything to Mr. Ashleigh, miss?&rdquo; the man asked
piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An expression of relief shone for a moment upon his face. Lenora pointed to
a stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down there and wait quietly,&rdquo; she ordered.</p>
<p>He obeyed without a word. She left the place, locked the door securely, and
made her way round to the other side of the garage&mdash;the side hidden from
the house. Here, at the far corner, she drew a little pocket wireless from her
bag and set it on the window-sill. Very slowly she sent her message,&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote"><small>&ldquo;I HAVE CRAIG HERE IN THE PROFESSOR&rsquo;S
GARAGE, LOCKED UP. IF OUR PLAN HAS SUCCEEDED, COME AT ONCE. I AM WAITING HERE
FOR YOU.&rdquo;</small></p>
<p>There was no reply. She sent the message again and again. Suddenly, during a
pause, there was a little flash upon the plate. A message was coming to her.
She transcribed it with beating heart:</p>
<p class="quote"><small>&ldquo;O.K. COMING.&rdquo;</small></p>
<p>The guard swung open the wicket in front of Quest&rsquo;s cell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young woman to see you, Quest,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Ten
minutes, and no loud talking, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest moved to the bars. It was Laura who stood there. She wasted very
little time in preliminaries. Having satisfied herself that the guard was out
of hearing, she leaned as close as she could to Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Lenora&rsquo;s crazy with the idea
that Craig has done these jobs&mdash;Craig, the Professor&rsquo;s servant, you
know. We used the phototelesme yesterday afternoon and saw him burn something
in the Professor&rsquo;s study. Lenora went up straight away and got hold of
the ashes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smart girl,&rdquo; Quest murmured, nodding approvingly.
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are distinct fragments,&rdquo; Laura continued, &ldquo;of
embroidered stuff such as the Salvation Army girl might have been wearing. We
put them on one side, but they aren&rsquo;t enough evidence. Lenora&rsquo;s
idea is that you should try and get hold of Craig and hypnotise him into a
confession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Quest replied, &ldquo;but how am I to
get hold of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura glanced once more carelessly around to where the guard stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora&rsquo;s gone up to the Professor&rsquo;s again this afternoon.
She is going to try and get hold of Craig and lock him in the garage. If she
succeeds, she will send a message by wireless at three o&rsquo;clock. It is
half-past two now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Quest exclaimed. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can work this guard, if you want to,&rdquo; Laura went on.
&ldquo;I have seen you tackle much worse cases. He seems dead easy. Then let me
in the cell, take my clothes and leave me here. You did it before when you were
trying to hunt down those men in Chicago, and not a soul recognised
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest followed the scheme in his mind quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all right,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;but I am not at all sure
that they can really hold me on the evidence they have got. If they
can&rsquo;t, I shall be doing myself more harm than good this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no use unless you can get hold of Craig quickly,&rdquo;
Laura said. &ldquo;He is getting the scares, as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; Quest decided. &ldquo;Call the guard,
Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She obeyed. The man came good-naturedly towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young people, not quarrelling, I hope?&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>Quest looked at him steadfastly through the bars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come inside for a moment,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; the man demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to come inside for a moment,&rdquo; Quest repeated softly.
&ldquo;Unlock the door, please, take the key off your bunch and come
inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man hesitated, but all the time his fingers were fumbling with the keys.
Quest&rsquo;s lips continued to move. The warder opened the door and entered. A
few minutes later, Quest passed the key through the window to Laura, who was
standing on guard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t step over him. He is
sitting with his back to the wall, just inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura obeyed, and entered the cell. For a moment they were breathless with
alarm. A passing warder looked down their avenue. Eventually, however, he
turned in the other direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Off with your coat and skirt like lightning, Laura,&rdquo; Quest
ordered. &ldquo;This has got to be done quickly or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word, and with marvellous rapidity, the change was effected. Laura
produced from her hand-bag a wig, which she pinned inside her hat and passed
over to Quest. Then she flung herself on to the bed and drew the blanket up to
her chin.</p>
<p><a id="pic15" name="pic15"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

"A man and woman dress in each other's clothing in a brick room.">
<p class="caption">Quest and Laura change clothes so that Quest may make his
escape.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;How long will he stay like that?&rdquo; she whispered, pointing to
the warder, who was sitting on the floor with his arms folded and his eyes
closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half an hour or so,&rdquo; Quest answered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother
about him. I shall drop the key back through the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment or two later, Quest walked deliberately down the corridor of the
prison, crossed the pavement and stepped into a taxicab. He reached Georgia
Square at five minutes to three. A glance up and down assured him that the
house was unwatched. He let himself in with his own key and laughed softly as
he caught sight of his reflection in the mirror. The house was strangely quiet
and deserted, but he wasted no time in looking around. He ran quickly upstairs,
paused in his sitting-room only to take a cigar from the cabinet, passed on to
the bedroom, threw Laura&rsquo;s clothes off, and, after a few moments&rsquo;
hesitation, selected from the wardrobe a rough tweed suit with a thick lining
and lapels. Just as he was tying his tie, the little wireless which he had laid
on the table at his side began to record the message. He glanced at the clock.
It was exactly three.</p>
<p class="quote"><small>&ldquo;I HAVE CRAIG HERE IN THE PROFESSOR'S GARAGE,
LOCKED UP. IF OUR PLAN HAS SUCCEEDED, COME AT ONCE. I AM WAITING HERE FOR
YOU.&rdquo;</small></p>
<p>Quest&rsquo;s eyes shone for a moment with satisfaction. Then he sent off
his answering message, put on a duster and slouch hat, and left the house by
the side entrance. In a few moments he was in Broadway, and a quarter of an
hour later a taxicab deposited him at the entrance to the Professor&rsquo;s
house. He walked swiftly up the drive and turned towards the garage, hoping
every moment to see something of Lenora. The door of the place stood open. He
entered and walked around. It was empty. There was no sign of either Craig or
Lenora!&hellip;</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Quest, recovered from his first disappointment, stole carefully out and made
a minute examination of the place. Close to the corner from which Lenora had
sent her wireless message to him, he stooped and picked up a handkerchief,
which from the marking he recognised at once. A few feet away, the gravel was
disturbed as though by the trampling of several feet. He set his teeth. For a
single moment his own danger was forgotten. A feeling which he utterly failed
to recognise robbed him of his indomitable nerve. He realised with vivid but
scarcely displeasing potency a weakness in the armour of his complete
self-control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to find that girl,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Craig
can go to hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away and approached the house. The front door stood open and he
made his way at once to the library. The Professor, who was sitting at his desk
surrounded by a pile of books and papers, addressed him, as he entered, without
looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where on earth have you been, Craig?&rdquo; he enquired petulantly.
&ldquo;I have rung for you six times. Have I not told you never to leave the
place without orders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not Craig,&rdquo; Quest replied quietly. &ldquo;It is I,
Professor&mdash;Sanford Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor swung round in his chair and eyed his visitor in blank
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quest?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;God bless my soul! Have they let
you out already, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came out,&rdquo; Quest replied grimly. &ldquo;Sit down and listen
to me for a moment, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You came out?&rdquo; the Professor repeated, looking a little dazed.
&ldquo;You mean that you escaped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I made a mistake,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;but here I am.
Now listen, Professor. I know this will be painful to you, but give me your
best attention for a few minutes. These young women assistants of mine have
formed a theory of their own about the murder in my flat and the robbery of the
jewels. Hold on to your chair, Professor. They believe that the guilty person
was Craig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor&rsquo;s face was almost pitiful in its blank amazement. His
mouth was wide open like a child&rsquo;s, words seemed absolutely denied to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s their theory,&rdquo; Quest went on. &ldquo;They may be
right or they may be wrong&mdash;Lenora, at any rate, has collected some shreds
of evidence. They hatched a scheme between them, clever enough in its way. They
locked Craig up in your garage and got me out of the Tombs in Laura&rsquo;s
clothes. I have come straight up to find your garage open and Lenora
missing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor rose to his feet, obviously making a tremendous effort to
adjust his ideas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig locked up in my garage?&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Craig guilty
of those murders? Why, my dear Mr. Quest, a more harmless, a more inoffensive,
peace-loving and devoted servant than John Craig never trod this
earth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; Quest replied, &ldquo;but come out here, Mr.
Ashleigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor followed his companion out to the garage. Quest showed him the
open door and the marks of footsteps around where he had picked up the
handkerchief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what has become of your man Craig, and
what has become of my assistant Lenora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we had better search the house,&rdquo; the Professor
suggested. &ldquo;Craig? My dear Mr. Quest, you little know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he, then?&rdquo; Quest interrupted.</p>
<p>The Professor could do nothing but look around him a little vaguely.
Together they went back to the house and searched it without result. Then they
returned once more to the garage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going back,&rdquo; Quest announced. &ldquo;My only chance is the
wireless. If Lenora is alive or at liberty, she will communicate with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I come, too?&rdquo; the Professor asked timidly. &ldquo;This
matter has upset me thoroughly. I cannot stay here without Craig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, by all means,&rdquo; Quest assented. &ldquo;I will drive you
down in your car, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor hurried away to get his coat and hat, and a few minutes later
they started off. In Broadway, they left the car at a garage and made their way
up a back street, which enabled them to enter the house at the side entrance.
They passed upstairs into the sitting-room. Quest fetched the pocket wireless
and laid it down on the table. The Professor examined it with interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are marvellous, my friend,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;With all
these resources of science at your command, it seems incredible that you should
be in the position you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get out of that all right,&rdquo; he asserted confidently.
&ldquo;The only trouble is that while I am dodging about like this I cannot
devote myself properly to the task of running down this fiend of the Hands.
Just one moment, Professor, while I send off a message,&rdquo; he continued,
opening the little instrument. &ldquo;Where are you, Lenora?&rdquo; he
signalled. &ldquo;Send me word and I will fetch you. I am in my own house for
the present. Let me know that you are safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor leaned back, smoking one of Quest&rsquo;s excellent cigars. He
was beginning to show signs of the liveliest interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I wish I could induce you to dismiss
this extraordinary supposition of yours concerning my servant Craig. The man
has been with me for the best part of twenty years. He saved my life in South
America; we have travelled in all parts of the world. He has proved himself to
be exemplary, a faithful and devoted servant. I thought it absurd, Mr. Quest,
when you were suspected of these crimes. I should think it even more ridiculous
to associate Craig with them in any way whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you will tell me,&rdquo; Quest suggested, &ldquo;where
he is now, and why he has gone away? That does not look like complete
innocence, does it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Appearances are nothing,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Craig is a man of
highly nervous susceptibilities. The very idea of being suspected of anything
so terrible would be enough to drive him almost out of his mind. I am convinced
that we shall find him at home presently, with some reasonable explanation of
his absence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest paced the room for a few moments, moodily.</p>
<p>There was a certain amount of reason in the Professor&rsquo;s point of
view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway, I cannot stay here much longer, unless I mean to go back to
the Tombs,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; the Professor suggested, &ldquo;your innocence will
very soon be established?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing which will happen, without a doubt,&rdquo; Quest
replied. &ldquo;My auto and the chauffeur will be discovered. I have insisted
upon enquiries being sent out throughout the State of Connecticut. They tell
me, too, that the police are hard on the scent of Red Gallagher and the other
man. Unless they get wind of this and sell me purposely, their arrest will be
the end of my troubles. To tell you the truth, Professor,&rdquo; Quest
concluded, &ldquo;it is not of myself I am thinking at all just now. It is
Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor nodded sympathetically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young lady who shut Craig up in the garage, you mean? A plucky
young woman she must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a great many other good qualities besides courage,&rdquo;
Quest declared. &ldquo;Women have not counted for much with me, Professor, up
till now, any more than they have done, I should think, with you, but I tell
you frankly, if any one has hurt a hair of that girl&rsquo;s head I will have
their lives, whatever the penalty may be! It is for her sake&mdash;to find
her&mdash;that I broke out of prison and that I am trying to keep free. The
wisest thing to do, from my own point of view, would be to give myself up. I
can&rsquo;t bring myself to do that without knowing what has become of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor nodded again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A charming and well-bred young woman she seems,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;I fear that I should only be a bungler in your profession, Mr. Quest,
but if there is anything I can do to help you to discover her whereabouts, you
can count upon me. Personally, I am convinced that Craig will return to me with
some plausible explanation as to what has happened. In that case he will
doubtless bring news of the young lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest, for the third or fourth time, moved cautiously towards the window.
His expression suddenly changed. He glanced downwards, frowning slightly. An
alert light flashed into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re after me!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Sit still,
Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He darted into his room and reappeared again almost immediately. The
Professor gave a gasp of astonishment at his altered appearance. His tweed suit
seemed to have been turned inside out. There were no lapels now and it was
buttoned up to his neck. He wore a long white apron; a peaked cap and a
chin-piece of astonishing naturalness had transformed him into the semblance of
a Dutch grocer&rsquo;s boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off, Professor,&rdquo; Quest whispered. &ldquo;You shall
hear from me soon. I have not been here, remember!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran lightly down the steps and into the kitchen, picked up a basket,
filled it haphazard with vegetables and threw a cloth over the top. Then he
made his way to the front door, peered out for a moment, swung through it on to
the step, and, turning round, commenced to belabour it with his fist. Two
plain-clothes men stood at the end of the street. A police automobile drew up
outside the gate. Inspector French, attended by a policeman, stepped out. The
former looked searchingly at Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my boy, what are you doing here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot answer get,&rdquo; Quest replied, in broken English.
&ldquo;Ten minutes already have I wasted. I have knocked at all the
doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>French smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can hop it, Dutchie,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;By-the-bye, when
was that order for vegetables given?&rdquo; he added, frowning for a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is three times a week the same,&rdquo; Quest explained, whipping
the cloth from the basket. &ldquo;No word has been sent to alter
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector pushed him hurriedly in the direction of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You run along home,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and tell your master that
he had better leave off delivering goods here for the present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest went off, grumbling. He walked with the peculiar waddle affected by
young Dutchmen of a certain class, and was soon out of sight round the corner
of the street. French opened the door with a masterkey and secured it
carefully, leaving one of his men to guard it. He searched the rooms on the
ground floor and finally ascended to Quest&rsquo;s study. The Professor was
still enjoying his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, where&rsquo;s Quest?&rdquo; the Inspector asked promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you let him out already?&rdquo; the Professor replied, in a tone
of mild surprise. &ldquo;I thought he was in the Tombs prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector pressed on without answering. Every room in the house was
ransacked. Presently he came back to the room where the Professor was still
sitting. His usually good-humoured face was a little clouded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; he began&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that,
Miles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A plain-clothes man from the street had come hurrying into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mr. French,&rdquo; he reported, &ldquo;our fellows have got hold
of a newsie down in the street, who was coming along way round the back and saw
two men enter this house by the side entrance, half-an-hour ago. One he
described exactly as the Professor here. The other, without a doubt, was
Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>French turned swiftly towards the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear what this man says?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Mr.
Ashleigh, you&rsquo;re fooling me! You entered this house with Sanford Quest.
You must tell us where he is hiding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor knocked the ash from his cigar and replaced it in his mouth.
His clasped hands rested in front of him. There was a twinkle of something
almost like mirth in his eyes as he glanced up at the Inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. French,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Mr. Sanford Quest is my friend. I
am here in charge of his house. Believing as I do that his arrest was an
egregious blunder, I shall say or do nothing likely to afford you any
information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>French turned impatiently away. Suddenly a light broke in upon him, he
rushed towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That damned Dutchie!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>The Professor smiled benignly.</p>
<h2><a name="ch7" id="ch7"></a>VII.&mdash;THE UNSEEN TERROR</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">With a little gesture of despair, Quest turned away from the
instrument which seemed suddenly to have become so terribly unresponsive, and
looked across the vista of square roofs and tangled masses of telephone wires
to where the lights of larger New York flared up against the sky. From his
attic chamber, the roar of the City a few blocks away was always in his ears.
He had forgotten in those hours of frenzied solitude to fear for his own
safety. He thought only of Lenora. Under which one of those thousands of roofs
was she being concealed? What was the reason for this continued silence?
Perhaps they had taken her instrument away&mdash;perhaps she was being
ill-used. The bare thought opened the door to a thousand grim and torturing
surmises. He paced restlessly up and down the room. Inaction had never seemed
to him so wearisome. From sheer craving to be doing something, he paused once
more before the little instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora, where are you?&rdquo; he signalled. &ldquo;I have taken a
lodging in the Servants&rsquo; Club. I am still in hiding, hoping that Craig
may come here. I am very anxious about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still no reply! Quest drew a chair up to the window and sat there with
folded arms looking down into the street. Suddenly he sprang to his feet. The
instrument quivered&mdash;there was a message at last! He took it down with a
little choke of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where I am. I am terrified. I was outside the
garage when I was seized from behind. The Hands held me. I was unconscious
until I found myself here. I am now in an attic room with no window except the
skylight, which I cannot reach. I can see nothing&mdash;hear nothing. No one
has hurt me, no one comes near. Food is pushed through a door, which is locked
again immediately. The house seems empty, yet I fancy that I am being watched
all the time. I am terrified!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest drew the instrument towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have your message,&rdquo; he signalled. &ldquo;Be brave! I am
watching for Craig. Through him I shall reach you before long. Send me a
message every now and then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then there was a silence.</p>
<p>Quest was conscious of an enormous feeling of relief and yet an almost
maddening sense of helplessness. She was imprisoned by the Hands. She was in
their power, and up till now they had shown themselves ruthless enough. A room
with a roof window only! How could she define her whereabouts! His first
impulse was to rush madly out into the street and search for her. Then his
common sense intervened. His one hope was through Craig. Again he took up his
vigil in front of the window. Once more his eyes swept the narrow street with
its constant stream of passers-by. Each time a man stopped and entered the
building, he leaned a little further forward, and at each disappointment he
seemed to realise a little more completely the slenderness of the chance upon
which he was staking so much. Then suddenly he found himself gripping the
window-sill in a momentary thrill of rare excitement. His vigil was rewarded at
last. The man for whom he was waiting was there! Quest watched him cross the
street, glance furtively to the right and to the left, then enter the club. He
turned back to the little wireless and his fingers worked as though
inspired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am on Craig&rsquo;s track,&rdquo; he signalled. &ldquo;Be
brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited for no reply, but opened the door and stealing softly out of the
room, leaned over the banisters. His apartment was on the fourth story. The
floor below was almost entirely occupied by the kitchen and other offices. The
men&rsquo;s club room was on the second floor. From where he stood he heard the
steward of the club greeting Craig. He was a big man with a hearty voice, and
the sound of his words reached Quest distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mr. Craig, you&rsquo;re an authority on South America,
aren&rsquo;t you? I bought some beans in the market this morning which they
told me were grown down there, and my chef don&rsquo;t seem to know what to
make of &rsquo;em. I wonder whether you would mind stepping up and giving him
your advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig&rsquo;s much lower voice was inaudible but it was evident that he had
consented, for the two men ascended to the third floor together. Quest watched
them enter the kitchen. A moment or two later the steward was summoned by a
messenger and descended alone. Quest ran quickly down the stairs and planted
himself behind the kitchen door. He had hardly taken up his position before the
handle was turned. He heard Craig&rsquo;s last words, spoken as he looked over
his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want to just soak them for two hours longer than any other beans
in the world. That&rsquo;s all there is about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig appeared and the door swung back behind him. Before he could utter a
cry, Quest&rsquo;s left hand was over his mouth and the cold muzzle of an
automatic pistol was pressed to his ribs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn round and mount those stairs, Craig,&rdquo; Quest ordered.</p>
<p>The man shrunk away, trembling. The pistol pressed a little further into his
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upstairs,&rdquo; Quest repeated firmly. &ldquo;If you utter a cry I
shall shoot you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig turned slowly round and obeyed. He mounted the stairs with reluctant
footsteps, followed by Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the door to your right,&rdquo; the latter directed.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right! Now sit down in that chair facing me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest closed the door carefully. Craig sat where he had been ordered, his
fingers gripping the arms of the chair. In his eyes shone the furtive,
terrified light of the trapped criminal.</p>
<p>Quest looked him over a little scornfully. It was queer that a man with
apparently so little nerve should have the art and the daring to plan such
exploits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; Craig asked doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First of all,&rdquo; Quest replied, &ldquo;I want to know what you
have done with my assistant, the girl whom you carried off from the
Professor&rsquo;s garage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing about her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She locked you in the garage,&rdquo; Quest continued, &ldquo;and sent
for me. When I arrived, I found the garage door open, Lenora gone and you a
fugitive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bewilderment struggled for a moment with blank terror in Craig&rsquo;s
expression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that she locked me in the garage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest smiled, stretched out his right arm and his long fingers played softly
with the pocket wireless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In just the same way,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that I am sending
her this message at the present moment&mdash;a message which she will receive
and understand wherever she is hidden. Would you like to know what I am telling
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shivered. His eyes, as though fascinated, watched the little
instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am saying this, Craig,&rdquo; Quest continued. &ldquo;Craig is here
and in my power. He is sitting within a few feet of me and will not leave this
room alive until he has told me your whereabouts. Keep up your courage, Lenora.
You shall be free in an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trapped man looked away from the instrument into Quest&rsquo;s face.
There was a momentary flicker of something that might have passed for courage
in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a wonderful man, but there
are limits to your power. You can tear my tongue from my mouth but you cannot
force me to speak a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest leaned a little further forward in his chair, his gaze became more
concentrated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is where you are wrong, Craig. That is where you make a mistake.
In a very few minutes you will be telling me all the secrets of your
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig shivered, drew back a little in his chair, tried to rise and fell back
again helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Leave me alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you have told me the truth,&rdquo; Quest answered, swiftly,
&ldquo;and you will tell me all I want to know in a few moments&hellip;. Your
eyelids are getting a little heavy, Craig. Don&rsquo;t resist. Something which
is like sleep is coming over you. You see my will has yours by the
throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig seemed suddenly to collapse altogether. He fell over on one side.
Every atom of colour had faded from his cheeks. Quest leaned over him with a
frown. The man was in a stupor without a doubt, but it was a physical state of
unconsciousness into which he had subsided. He felt his pulse, unbuttoned his
coat, and listened for a moment to the beating of his heart. Then he crossed
the room, fetched the pitcher of water and dashed some of its contents in
Craig&rsquo;s face. In a few moments the man opened his eyes and regained
consciousness. His appearance, however, was still ghastly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are here in my room, at the Servants&rsquo; Club,&rdquo; Quest
replied. &ldquo;You are just about to tell me where I shall find
Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig shook his head. A very weak smile of triumph flickered for a moment at
the corners of his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your torture chamber trick won&rsquo;t work on me!&rdquo; he
exclaimed. &ldquo;You can never&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole gamut of emotions seemed already to have spent themselves in the
man&rsquo;s face, but at that moment there was a new element, an element of
terrified curiosity in the expression of his eyes as he stared towards the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this another trick of yours?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Quest, too, turned his head and sprang instantly to his feet. From
underneath the door came a little puff of smoke. There was a queer sense of
heat of which both men were simultaneously conscious. Down in the street arose
a chorus of warning shouts, increasing momentarily in volume. Quest threw open
the door and closed it again at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place is on fire,&rdquo; he announced briefly. &ldquo;Pull
yourself together, man. We shall have all we can do to get out of
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig turned to the door but staggered back almost immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stairs are going!&rdquo; he shrieked. &ldquo;It is the kitchen
that is on fire. We are cut off! We cannot get down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest was on his hands and knees, fumbling under his truckle bed. He pulled
out a crude form of fire escape, a rough sort of cradle with a rope
attached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know how to use this?&rdquo; he asked Craig quickly. &ldquo;Here,
catch hold. Put your arms inside this strap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going to send me down first?&rdquo; Craig exclaimed
incredulously.</p>
<p>Quest smiled. Then he drew the rope round the table and tied it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would like to have a chance of cutting the rope, wouldn&rsquo;t
you, when I was half way down?&rdquo; he asked grimly. &ldquo;Now then,
don&rsquo;t waste time. Get on to the window-sill. Don&rsquo;t brake too much.
Off you go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yard by yard, swinging a little in the air, Craig made his descent. When he
arrived in the street, there were a hundred willing hands to release him. Quest
drew up the rope quickly, warned by a roar of anxious voices. The walls of the
room were crumbling. Volumes of smoke were now pouring in underneath the door,
and through the yawning fissures of the wall. Little tongues of flame were
leaping out dangerously close to the spot where he must pass. He let fall the
slack of the rope and leaned from the window to watch it anxiously. Then he
commenced to descend, letting himself down hand over hand, always with one eye
upon that length of rope that swung below. Suddenly, as he reached the second
floor, a little cry from the crowd warned him of what had happened. Tongues of
flame curling out from the blazing building, had caught the rope, which was
being burned through not a dozen feet away from him. He descended a little
further and paused in mid-air.</p>
<p><a id="pic16" name="pic16"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="1202801h-images/TheBlackBox16.jpg" title=
"A huge crowd looks on as a man pulls an alarm.">
<p class="caption">One of the club&rsquo;s butlers turns in a fire alarm.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>A shout from the crowd reached him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cables! Try the cables!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced round. Seven or eight feet away, and almost level with him was a
double row of telegraph wires. Almost as he saw them the rope below him burned
through and fell to the ground. He swung a little towards the side of the
house, pushed himself vigorously away from it with his feet, and at the
farthest point of the outward swing, jumped. His hands gripped the telegraph
wires safely. Even in that tense moment he heard a little sob of relief from
the people below.</p>
<p>Hand over hand he made his way to the nearest pole and slipped easily to the
ground. The crowd immediately surged around him. Some one forced a drink into
his hand. A chorus of congratulations fell upon his deafened ears. Then the
coming of the fire engines, and the approach of a police automobile diverted
the attention of the on-lookers. Quest slipped about amongst them, searching
for Craig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the man who came down before me?&rdquo; he asked a
bystander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking to the police in the car over yonder,&rdquo; was the hoarse
reply. &ldquo;Say, Guv&rsquo;nor, you only just made that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest pushed his way through the crowd to where Craig was speaking eagerly
to Inspector French. He stopped short and stooped down. He was near enough to
hear the former&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. French, you saw that man come down the rope and swing on to the
cables? That was Quest, Sanford Quest, the man who escaped from the Tombs
prison. He can&rsquo;t have got away yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest drew off his coat, turned it inside out, and replaced it swiftly. He
coolly picked up a hat some one had lost in the crowd and pulled it over his
eyes. He passed within a few feet of where Craig and the Inspector were
talking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was hiding in the Servants&rsquo; Club,&rdquo; Craig continued,
&ldquo;he had just threatened to shoot me when the fire broke out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send the word round,&rdquo; French declared.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have him found, right enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a single moment Quest hesitated. He had a wild impulse to take Craig by
the neck and throw him back into the burning house. Then he heard French shout
to his men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boys, Sanford Quest is in the crowd here somewhere. He&rsquo;s
the man who jumped on to the cable lines. A hundred dollars for his
arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest turned reluctantly away. Men were rushing about in all directions
looking for him. He forced a passage through the crowd and in the general
confusion he passed the little line of police without difficulty. His face
darkened as he looked behind at the burning block. A peculiar sense of
helplessness oppressed him. His pocket wireless was by now a charred heap of
ashes. His one means of communication with Lenora was gone and the only man who
knew her whereabouts was safe under the protection of the police.</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">The Professor swung round in his chair and greeted Quest with
some surprise but also a little disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No news of Craig?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Quest sank into a chair. He was fresh from the Turkish baths and was
enjoying the luxury of clean linen and the flavour of an excellent cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got Craig all right,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;He came to the
Servants&rsquo; Club where I was waiting for him. My luck&rsquo;s out, though.
The place was burnt to the ground last night. I saved his life and then the
brute gave me away to the police. I had to make my escape as best I
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor tapped the table peevishly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is insufferable,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I have had no
shaving water; my coffee was undrinkable; I can find nothing. I have a most
important lecture to prepare and I cannot find any of the notes I made upon the
subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest stared at the Professor for a moment and then laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;you are rather an egoist, Professor,
aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am,&rdquo; the latter confessed. &ldquo;Still, you must
remember that the scientific world on those few occasions when I do appear in
public, expects much of me. My sense of proportion may perhaps be disarranged
by this knowledge. All that I can realise at the present moment, is this. You
seem to have frightened away the one man in the world who is indispensable to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest smoked in silence for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any mail for me, Professor?&rdquo; he asked, abruptly.</p>
<p>The Professor opened a drawer and handed him a telegram.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest opened it and read it through. It was from the Sheriff of a small town
in Connecticut:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote"><tt>THE MEN YOU ENQUIRED FOR ARE BOTH HERE. THEY HAVE SOLD AN
AUTOMOBILE AND SEEM TO BE SPENDING THE PROCEEDS. SHALL I ARREST?</tt></p>
<p>Quest studied the message for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, this is rather interesting, Professor,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; the latter replied tartly. &ldquo;You must forgive me
if I cannot follow the complications of your&mdash;pardon me for saying
Munchausen-like affairs. How does the arrest of these two men help
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; Quest explained. &ldquo;These are the two
thugs who set upon me up at the section house. They killed the signalman, who
could have been my alibi, and swiped my car, in which, as it cannot be found,
French supposes that I returned to New York. With their arrest the case against
me collapses. I tell you frankly, Professor,&rdquo; Quest continued, frowning,
&ldquo;I hate to leave the city without having found that girl; but I am not
sure that the quickest way to set things right would not be to go down, arrest
these men and bring them back here, clear myself, and then go tooth and nail
for Craig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you most heartily,&rdquo; the Professor declared.
&ldquo;I recommend any course which will ensure the return of my man
Craig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot promise you that you will ever have Craig here again,&rdquo;
Quest observed grimly. &ldquo;I rather fancy Sing-Sing will be his next
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be foolish, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; the Professor advised.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me lose confidence in you. Craig would not hurt a fly,
and as to abducting your assistant&mdash;if my sense of humour were developed
upon normal lines&mdash;well, I should laugh! What you have really done, you,
and that young lady assistant of yours, is to terrify the poor fellow into such
a state of nerves that he scarcely knows what he is doing. As a matter of fact,
how do you know that that young woman has been abducted at all? Such things are
most unlikely, especially in this part of the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What reason do you suggest, then, for her disappearance?&rdquo; Quest
enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At my age,&rdquo; the Professor replied, drily, &ldquo;I naturally
know nothing of these things. But she is a young woman of considerable personal
attractions&mdash;I should think it not unlikely that she is engaged in some
amorous adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest laughed derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not know Lenora, Mr. Ashleigh,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;However, if it interests you, I will tell you why I know she has been
abducted. Only a few hours ago, I was talking to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor turned his head swiftly towards Quest. There was a queer sort
of surprise in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking to her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our pocket wireless!&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Lenora has even
described to me the room in which she is hidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the neighbourhood also?&rdquo; the Professor demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of that she knows nothing,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;She is in a
room apparently at the top of a house and the only window is in the roof. She
can see nothing, hear nothing. When I get hold of the man who put her
there,&rdquo; Quest continued slowly, &ldquo;it will be my ambition to
supplement personally any punishment the law may be able to inflict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor&rsquo;s manner had lost all its petulance. He looked at Quest
almost with admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea of yours is wonderful,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;I am
beginning to believe in your infallibility, Mr. Quest. I am beginning to
believe that on this occasion, at any rate, you will triumph over your
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if I can keep out of my friend
French&rsquo;s way for a few hours longer, I think I can promise you that I
shall be a free man when I return from Bethel. I&rsquo;m off now, Professor.
Wish me good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; the Professor replied, &ldquo;I wish you the best
of luck, but more than anything else in the world,&rdquo; he added, a little
peevishly, &ldquo;I hope you may bring me back my servant Craig, and leave us
both in peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest stepped off the cars at Bethel a little before noon that morning. The
Sheriff met him at the depot and greeted him cordially but with obvious
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as they turned away, &ldquo;I
know these men are wanted on your charge, but I thought&mdash;you&rsquo;ll
excuse my saying so&mdash;that you were in some trouble yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m out of that&mdash;came out yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very glad to hear it,&rdquo; the Sheriff assured him heartily.
&ldquo;I never thought that they&rsquo;d be able to hold you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hadn&rsquo;t a chance,&rdquo; Quest admitted. &ldquo;Things
turned out a little awkwardly at first, but this affair is going to put me on
my feet again. The moment my car is identified and Red Gallagher and his mate
arrested, every scrap of evidence against me goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, here&rsquo;s the garage and the man who bought the car,&rdquo;
the Sheriff remarked, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s the car itself in the road.
It&rsquo;s for you to say whether it can be identified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest drew a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s mine, right enough,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Now for
the men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I want to tell you something,&rdquo; the Sheriff began
dubiously. &ldquo;These two are real thugs. They ain&rsquo;t going to take it
lying down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; Quest demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the worst saloon here,&rdquo; the Sheriff replied.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been there pretty well all night, drinking, and
they&rsquo;re there again this morning, hard at it. They&rsquo;ve both got
firearms, and though I ain&rsquo;t exactly a nervous man, Mr.
Quest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave it to me,&rdquo; Quest interrupted. &ldquo;This is my job
and I want to take the men myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never do it,&rdquo; the Sheriff declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Quest explained, &ldquo;if I let you and your men
go in, there will be a free fight, and as likely as not you will kill one, if
not both of the men. I want them alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s your show,&rdquo; the Sheriff admitted, stopping
before a disreputable-looking building. &ldquo;This is the saloon.
They&rsquo;ve turned the place upside down since they&rsquo;ve been here. You
can hear the row they&rsquo;re making now. Free drinks to all the toughs in the
town! They&rsquo;re pouring the stuff down all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Quest decided, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going in and I&rsquo;m
going in unarmed. You can bring your men in later, if I call for help or if you
hear any shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re asking for trouble,&rdquo; the Sheriff warned him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to do this my own way,&rdquo; Quest insisted.
&ldquo;Stand by now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed open the door of the saloon. There were a dozen men drinking
around the bar and in the centre of them Red Gallagher and his mate. They
seemed to be all shouting together, and the air was thick with tobacco smoke.
Quest walked right up to the two men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gallagher,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re my prisoner. Are you
coming quietly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallagher&rsquo;s mate, who was half drunk, swung round and fired a wild
shot in Quest&rsquo;s direction. The result was a general stampede. Red
Gallagher alone remained motionless. Grim and dangerously silent, he held a
pistol within a few inches of Quest&rsquo;s forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my number&rsquo;s up,&rdquo; he exclaimed ferociously, &ldquo;it
won&rsquo;t be you who&rsquo;ll take me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it will,&rdquo; Quest answered. &ldquo;Put that gun
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallagher hesitated. Quest&rsquo;s influence over him was indomitable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it away,&rdquo; Quest repeated firmly. &ldquo;You know you
daren&rsquo;t use it. Your account&rsquo;s pretty full up, as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gallagher&rsquo;s hand wavered. From outside came the shouts of the Sheriff
and his men, struggling to fight their way in through the little crowd who were
rushing for safety. Suddenly Quest backed, jerked the pistol up with his right
elbow, and with almost the same movement struck Red Gallagher under the jaw.
The man went over with a crash. His mate, who had been staggering about,
cursing viciously, fired another wild shot at Quest, who swayed and fell
forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done him!&rdquo; the man shouted. &ldquo;Get up, Red!
I&rsquo;ve done him all right! Finish yer drink. We&rsquo;ll get out of
this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent unsteadily over Quest. Suddenly the latter sprang up, seized him by
the leg and sent him sprawling. The gun fell from his hand. Quest picked it up
and held it firmly out, covering both men. Gallagher was on his knees, groping
for his own weapon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the handcuffs on them,&rdquo; Quest directed the Sheriff, who
with his men had at last succeeded in forcing his way into the saloon.</p>
<p>The Sheriff wasted no words till the two thugs, now nerveless and cowed,
were handcuffed. Then he turned to Quest. There was a note of genuine
admiration in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got the biggest
nerve of any man I have ever known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The criminologist smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This sort of bully is always a coward when it comes to the
pinch,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Crouching in her chair, her pale, terror-stricken face supported between her
hands, Lenora, her eyes filled with hopeless misery, gazed at the dumb
instrument upon the table. Her last gleam of hope seemed to be passing. Her
little friend was silent. Once more her weary fingers spelt out a final,
despairing message.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened to you? I am waiting to hear all the time. Has
Craig told you where I am? I am afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was still no reply. Her head sank a little lower on to her folded
arms. Even the luxury of tears seemed denied her. Fear, the fear which dwelt
with her day and night, had her in its grip. Suddenly she leaped, screaming,
from her place. Splinters of glass fell all around her. Her first wild thought
was of release; she gazed upwards at the broken pane. Then very faintly from
the street below she heard the shout of a boy&rsquo;s angry voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it now, Jimmy! You&rsquo;re a fine pitcher,
ain&rsquo;t you? Lost it, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ve gone and
done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thoughts formed themselves mechanically in her mind. Her eyes sought the
ball which had come crashing into the room. There was life once more in her
pulses. She found a scrap of paper and a pencil in her pocket. With trembling
fingers she wrote a few words:</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;Police head-quarters. I am Sanford Quest&rsquo;s
assistant, abducted and imprisoned here in the room where the ball has fallen.
Help! I am going mad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She twisted the paper, looked around the room vainly for string, and finally
tore a thin piece of ribbon from her dress. She tied the message around the
ball, set her teeth, and threw it at the empty skylight. The first time she was
not successful and the ball came back. The second time it passed through the
centre of the opening. She heard it strike the sound portion of the glass
outside, heard it rumble down the roof. A few seconds of breathless silence!
Her heart almost stopped beating. Had it rested in some ledge, or fallen into
the street below? Then she heard the boy&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee! Here&rsquo;s the ball come back again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new light shone into the room. She seemed to be breathing a different
atmosphere&mdash;the atmosphere of hope. She listened no longer with horror for
a creaking upon the stairs. She walked back and forth until she was
exhausted&hellip;. Curiously enough, when the end came she was asleep, crouched
upon the bed and dreaming wildly. She sprang up to find Inspector French, with
a policeman behind him, standing upon the threshold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector!&rdquo; she cried, rushing towards him. &ldquo;Mr. French!
Oh, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her feelings carried her away. She threw herself at his feet. She was
laughing and crying and talking incoherently, all at the same time. The
Inspector assisted her to a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s all this mean?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>She told him her story, incoherently, in broken phrases. French listened
with puzzled frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what about Quest?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t been
here at all, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! Mr. Quest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated. The Inspector laid his hand upon her wrist. Then he realised
that she was on the point of a nervous breakdown, and in no condition for
interrogations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of you
for a time, young lady, and I&rsquo;ll ask you a few questions later on. My men
are searching the house. You and I will be getting on, if you can tear yourself
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed hysterically and hurried him towards the door. As they passed
down the gloomy stairs she clung to his arm. The first breath of air seemed
wonderful to her as they passed out into the street. It was freedom!</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>The plain-clothes man, who was lounging in Quest&rsquo;s most comfortable
easy-chair and smoking one of his best cigars, suddenly laid down his paper. He
moved to the window. A large, empty automobile stood in the street outside,
from which the occupants had presumably just descended. He hastened towards the
door, which was opened, however, before he was half-way across the room. The
cigar slipped from his fingers. It was Sanford Quest who stood there, followed
by the Sheriff of Bethel, two country policemen, and Red Gallagher and his
mate, heavily handcuffed. Quest glanced at the cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, do you mind picking that up?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That
carpet cost me money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plain-clothes man obeyed at once. Then he edged a little towards the
telephone. Quest had opened his cigar cabinet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad you&rsquo;ve left me one or two,&rdquo; he remarked drily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, aren&rsquo;t you wanted down yonder, Mr. Quest?&rdquo; the man
enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right now,&rdquo; Quest told him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
ringing up Inspector French myself. You&rsquo;d better stand by the other
fellows there and keep your eye on Red Gallagher and his mate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess Mr. Quest is all right,&rdquo; the Sheriff intervened.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re ringing up headquarters ourselves, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The plain-clothes man did as he was told. Quest took up the receiver from
his telephone instrument and arranged the phototelesme.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police-station Number One, central,&rdquo; he
said,&mdash;&ldquo;through to Mr. French&rsquo;s office, if you please. Mr.
Quest wants to speak to him. Yes, Sanford Quest. No need to get
excited!&hellip; All right. I&rsquo;m through, am I?&hellip; Hullo,
Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A rare expression of joy suddenly transfigured Quest&rsquo;s face. He was
gazing downward into the little mirror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve found Lenora, then, Inspector?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Bully for you!&hellip; What do I mean? What I say! You forget that I am
a scientific man, French. No end of appliances here you haven&rsquo;t had time
to look at. I can see you sitting there, and Lenora and Laura looking as though
you had them on the rack. You can drop that, French. I&rsquo;ve got Red
Gallagher and his mate, got them here with the Sheriff of Bethel. They went off
with my auto and sold it. We&rsquo;ve got that. Also, in less than five minutes
my chauffeur will be here. He&rsquo;s been lying in a farmhouse, unconscious,
since that scrap. He can tell you what time he saw me last. Bring the girls
along, French&mdash;and hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest hung up the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given Inspector French something to think about,&rdquo; he
remarked, as he turned away. &ldquo;Now, Mr. Sheriff, if you can make yourself
at home for a quarter of an hour or so, French will be here and take these
fellows off your hands. I&rsquo;ve still a little more telephoning to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go right ahead,&rdquo; the Sheriff acquiesced.</p>
<p>Quest rang up the Professor. His response to the call was a little languid,
and his reception of the news of Quest&rsquo;s successful enterprise was almost
querulous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; the Professor said, &ldquo;your news gratifies me,
of course. Your rehabilitation, however, was a matter of certainty. With me
life has become a chaos. You can have no idea, with your independent nature,
what it means to entirely rely upon the ministrations of one person and to be
suddenly deprived of their help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No news of Craig, then?&rdquo; Quest demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; was the weary reply. &ldquo;What about your young
lady assistant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be here in five minutes,&rdquo; Quest told him.
&ldquo;You had better come along and hear her story. It ought to interest
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; the Professor exclaimed. &ldquo;I will certainly
come&mdash;certainly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest set down the receiver and paced the room thoughtfully for a moment or
two. Although his own troubles were almost over, the main problem before him
was as yet unsolved. The affair with the Gallaghers was, after all, only an
off-shoot. It was the mystery of Lenora&rsquo;s abduction, the mystery of the
black box, which still called for the exercise of all his ingenuity.</p>
<p>Inspector French was as good, even better, than his word. In a surprisingly
short time he entered the room, followed by Laura and Lenora. Quest gave them a
hand each, but it was into Lenora&rsquo;s eyes that he looked. Her coming, her
few words of greeting, timid though they were, brought him an immense sense of
relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, girls,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;both full of adventures, eh? What
did they do with you in the Tombs, Laura?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! What could they do?&rdquo; Laura replied. &ldquo;If
they&rsquo;re guys enough to be tricked by a girl, the best thing they can do
is to keep mum about it and let her go. That&rsquo;s about what they did to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector French, who was standing a little aloof, regarded Laura with an
air of unwilling admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s some girl, that Miss Laura,&rdquo; he muttered in an
undertone to Quest. &ldquo;She roasted us nicely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t stop to hear your story, Lenora,&rdquo; Quest said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re safe&mdash;that&rsquo;s the great thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found her in an empty house,&rdquo; French reported, &ldquo;out
Gayson Avenue way. Now, Mr. Quest, I don&rsquo;t want to come the official over
you too much, but if you&rsquo;ll kindly remember that you&rsquo;re an escaped
prisoner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a knock at the door. A young man entered in chauffeur&rsquo;s
livery, with his head still bandaged. Quest motioned him to come in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just repeat my story of that morning, French,&rdquo; Quest
said. &ldquo;We went out to find Macdougal, and succeeded, as you know. Just as
I was starting for home, those two thugs set upon me. They nearly did me up.
You know how I made my escape. They went off in my automobile and sold it in
Bethel. I arrested them there myself this morning. Here&rsquo;s the Sheriff,
who will bear out what I say, also that they arrived at the place in my
automobile.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; the Sheriff murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Further,&rdquo; Quest continued, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s my chauffeur.
He knows exactly what time it was when the tire of my car blew out, just as we
were starting for New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was eleven-ten, sir,&rdquo; the chauffeur declared. &ldquo;Mr.
Quest and I both took out our watches to see if we could make New York by
mid-day. Then one of those fellows hit me over the head and I&rsquo;ve been
laid up ever since. A man who keeps a store a little way along the road picked
me up and looked after me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inspector French held out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;ll have to
withdraw the case against you. No hard feeling, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; Quest replied promptly, taking his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; French declared.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought two more men with me. Perhaps, Mr. Sheriff, you
wouldn&rsquo;t mind escorting your prisoners around to headquarters? I&rsquo;ll
be there before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you girls,&rdquo; Quest insisted, &ldquo;go right to your room
and rest. I&rsquo;ll come upstairs presently and have a talk. Look after her,
Laura,&rdquo; he added, glancing a little anxiously at Lenora. &ldquo;She has
had about as much as she can bear, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls left the room. Quest stood upon the threshold, watching the
Sheriff and his prisoners leave the house. The former turned round to wave his
adieux to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s an elderly josser out here,&rdquo; he shouted;
&ldquo;seems to want to come in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest leaned forward and saw the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come right in, Mr. Ashleigh,&rdquo; he invited.</p>
<p>The Professor promptly made his appearance. His coat was ill-brushed and in
place of a hat he was wearing a tweed cap which had seen better days. His
expression was almost pathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Quest,&rdquo; he exclaimed, as he wrung his hand, &ldquo;my
heartiest congratulations! As you know, I always believed in your innocence. I
am delighted that it has been proved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in and sit down, Mr. Ashleigh,&rdquo; Quest invited. &ldquo;You
know the Inspector.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor shook hands with French, and then, feeling that his appearance
required some explanation, he took off his cap and looked at it ruefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am aware,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this is not a becoming
headgear, but I am lost&mdash;absolutely lost without my servant. If you would
earn my undying gratitude, Mr. Quest, you would clear up the mystery about
Craig and restore him to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest was helping the Inspector to the whisky at the sideboard. He paused to
light a cigar before he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I very much fear, Professor,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;that you will
never have Craig back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor sank wearily into an easy-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take a little whisky and one of your excellent cigars,
Quest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I must ask you to bear with me if I seem upset.
After more than twenty years&rsquo; service from one whom I have always treated
as a friend, this sudden separation, to a man of my age, is somewhat trying. My
small comforts are all interfered with. The business of my every-day life is
completely upset. I do not allude, as you perceive, Mr. Quest, to the horrible
suspicions you seem to have formed of Craig. My own theory is that you have
simply frightened him to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; the Inspector remarked thoughtfully, &ldquo;some
one who is still at large committed those murders and stole those jewels. What
is your theory about the jewels, Mr. Quest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t had time to frame one yet,&rdquo; the criminologist
replied. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been keeping me too busy looking after myself.
However,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s time something was done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took a magnifying glass from his pocket and examined very closely the
whole of the front of the safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No sign of finger-prints,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;The person who
opened it probably wore gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He fitted the combination and swung open the door. He stood there, for a
moment, speechless. Something in his attitude attracted the Inspector&rsquo;s
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mr. Quest?&rdquo; he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Quest drew a little breath. Exactly facing him, in the spot where the jewels
had been, was a small black box. He brought it to the table and removed the
lid. Inside was a sheet of paper, which he quickly unfolded. They all three
read the few lines together:&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;Pitted against the inherited cunning of the ages, you
have no chance. I will take compassion upon you. Look in the right-hand drawer
of your desk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Underneath appeared the signature of the Hands. Quest moved like a dream to
his cabinet and pulled open the right-hand drawer. He turned around and faced
the other two men. In his hand was Mrs. Rheinholdt&rsquo;s necklace!</p>
<h2><a name="ch8" id="ch8"></a>VIII.&mdash;THE HOUSE OF MYSTERY</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">Something in the nature of a conference was proceeding in
Quest&rsquo;s study. The Professor was there, seated in the most comfortable
easy-chair, smoking without relish one of his host&rsquo;s best cigars,
watching with nervous impatience the closed door. Laura and Lenora were seated
at the table, dressed for the street. They had the air of being prepared for
some excursion. Quest, realising the Professor&rsquo;s highly-strung state, had
left him alone for a few moments and was studying a map of New York. The
latter, however, was too ill at ease to keep silent for long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our friend French,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;gave you no clue, I
suppose, as to the direction in which his investigations are leading
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest glanced up from the map.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None at all. I know, however, that the house in which Lenora here was
confined, is being watched closely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor glanced towards the table before which Lenora was seated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems strange,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that the young lady
should have so little to tell us about her incarceration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora shivered for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could there be to tell,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;except that it
was all horrible, and that I felt things&mdash;felt dangers&mdash;which I
couldn&rsquo;t describe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor gave vent to an impatient little exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not speaking of fancies,&rdquo; he persisted. &ldquo;You had
food brought to you, for instance. Could you never see the hand which placed it
inside your room? Could you hear nothing of the footsteps of the person who
brought it? Could you not even surmise whether it was a man or a
woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora answered him with an evident effort. She had barely, as yet,
recovered from the shock of those awful hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The person who brought me the food,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;came at
night&mdash;never in the daytime. I never heard anything. The most I ever saw
was once&mdash;I happened to be looking towards the door and I saw a pair of
hands&mdash;nothing more&mdash;setting down a tray. I shrieked and called out.
I think that I almost fainted. When I found courage enough to look, there was
nothing there but the tray upon the floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never heard, for instance, the rustling of a gown or the sound of
a footstep?&rdquo; the Professor asked. &ldquo;You could not even say whether
your jailer were man or woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that I ever heard was the opening of the door. All that I ever
saw was that pair of hands. One night I fancied&mdash;but that must have been a
dream!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fancied what?&rdquo; the Professor persisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I saw a pair of eyes glaring at me,&rdquo; Lenora replied,
&ldquo;eyes without any human body. I know that I ran round the room, calling
out. When I dared to look again, there was nothing there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor sighed as he turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is evident, I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Miss
Lenora&rsquo;s evidence will help no one. As an expert in these affairs, Mr.
Quest, does it not seem to you that her imprisonment was just a little
purposeless? There seems to have been no attempt to harm her in any way
whatever, that I can see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever took the risk of abducting her,&rdquo; Quest pointed out
grimly, &ldquo;did it for a purpose. That purpose would probably have become
developed in course of time. However we look at it, Mr. Ashleigh, there was
only one man who must have been anxious to get her out of the way, and that man
was Craig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor&rsquo;s manner betrayed some excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then will you tell me this?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;The young lady
is confident that she locked Craig up in the coach-house and that the key was
on the outside of the door, a fact which would prevent the lock being picked
from inside, even if such a thing were possible. The window is small, and up
almost in the roof. Will you tell me how Craig escaped from the coach-house in
order to carry out this abduction&mdash;all within a few minutes, mind, of his
having been left there? Will you tell me that, Mr. Sanford Quest?&rdquo; the
Professor concluded, with a note of triumph in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the troubles we are up against,&rdquo; Quest
admitted. &ldquo;We have to remember this, though. The brain that planned the
two murders here, that stole and restored Mrs. Rheinholdt&rsquo;s jewels, that
sends us those little billets-doux from time to time, is quite capable of
finding a way out of a jerry-built garage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor sniffed. He turned once more to Lenora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will ask you this. I do not wish
to seem obstinate in my refusal to accept Craig&rsquo;s guilt as proved, but I
would like to put this simple question to you. Did Craig&rsquo;s demeanour
during your conversation seem to you to indicate the master criminal? Did he
seem to you to be possessed of supreme courage, of marvellous
intelligence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora smiled very faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;that this time I&rsquo;ll
have to satisfy the Professor. He was white and trembling all the time. I
thought him an arrant coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor smiled beatifically as he glanced around. He had the air of
one propounding an unanswerable problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear what Miss Lenora says? I ask you whether a man who even knew
the meaning of the word fear could have carried out these ghastly
crimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have known cases,&rdquo; Quest observed, &ldquo;where the most
cold-blooded criminals in the world have been stricken with the most deadly
fear when it has come to a question of any personal danger. However,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;here comes our friend French. I have an idea that he has
something to tell us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They glanced expectantly towards the door as French entered. The Inspector,
who was looking very spruce and well-brushed, wished them a general
good-morning. His eyes rested last and longest upon Laura, who seemed, however,
unconscious of his presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, then, French,&rdquo; Quest began, as he returned his greeting,
&ldquo;take a cigar, make yourself comfortable in that chair and let us have
your news. As you see, we have obeyed orders. We are all ready to follow you
anywhere you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be to the end of the world, anyway,&rdquo; the
Inspector remarked, as he lit his cigar. &ldquo;I am going to propose a little
excursion down Gayson Avenue way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Back to that house?&rdquo; Lenora exclaimed, with a grimace.</p>
<p>The Inspector nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have had those boys at the station,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and
we have questioned them carefully. It seems that after they had picked up the
ball, a man came out of the side entrance of the house, saw them reading Miss
Lenora&rsquo;s message, and shouted after them. The boys had sense enough to
scoot. The man ran after them, but had to give it up. Here is their description
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector took a piece of paper from his pocket. They all waited
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had to drag this out of the boys, bit by bit,&rdquo; the Inspector
proceeded, &ldquo;but boiled down and put into reasonable language, this is
what it comes to. The man was of medium height, rather thin, pale, and dressed
in black clothes. He had what they call anxious eyes, and after running a short
distance he put his hand to his heart, as though out of breath. One of the boys
thought his nose was a little hooked, and they both remarked upon the fact that
although he shouted after them, he used no swear words, but simply tried to
induce them to stop. This description suggest anything to you,
gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig,&rdquo; Lenora said firmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very accurate description of Craig,&rdquo; Sanford Quest
agreed.</p>
<p>The Professor looked troubled, also a little perplexed. He said nothing,
however.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under these circumstances,&rdquo; the Inspector continued, &ldquo;I
have had the house watched, and I propose that we now search it systematically.
It is very possible that something may transpire to help us. Of course, my men
went through it roughly when we brought Miss Lenora away, but that wasn&rsquo;t
anything of a search to count, if the place really has become a haunt of
criminals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the ownership of the house?&rdquo; Quest asked, as he took
up his hat.</p>
<p>The Inspector nodded approvingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am making a few enquiries in that direction,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;I expect to have something to report very shortly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor stood drawing on his gloves. The vague look of trouble still
lingered in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me again,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;the name of the avenue in
which this residence is situated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gayson Avenue,&rdquo; the inspector replied. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a bit
out of the way, but it&rsquo;s not a bad neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor repeated the address to himself softly. For a moment he stood
quite still. His manner showed signs of growing anxiety. He seemed to be trying
to remember something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The name,&rdquo; he admitted finally, as they moved towards the door,
&ldquo;suggests to me, I must confess&mdash;We are going to see the house,
Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are on our way there now, sir&mdash;that is, if the young ladies
are willing?&rdquo; he added, glancing at Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been waiting here with our hats on for the last
half-hour,&rdquo; Laura replied promptly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve stretched your
ten minutes out some, Mr. French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector manoeuvred to let the others pass on, and descended the stairs
by Laura&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; he confided, lowering his tone a
little. &ldquo;Had some information come in about that house I couldn&rsquo;t
quite size up. You&rsquo;re looking well this morning, Miss Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, who are you guying!&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it,&rdquo; the Inspector persisted. &ldquo;That hat seems to
suit you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura laughed at the top of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, kid,&rdquo; she exclaimed to Lenora, &ldquo;the Inspector
here&rsquo;s setting up as a judge of millinery!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora turned and looked at them both with an air of blank astonishment. The
Inspector was a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to give me away like that,&rdquo; he muttered, as they
reached the hall. &ldquo;Now then, ladies and gentlemen, if you are
ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took their places in the automobile and drove off. As they neared the
vicinity of Gayson Avenue, the Professor began to show signs of renewed
uneasiness. When they drew up at last outside the house, he gave a little
exclamation. His face was grave, almost haggard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Inspector French, I deeply regret
that I have a statement to make.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both turned quickly towards him. The Inspector smiled in a confidential
manner at Laura. It was obvious that he knew what was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some years ago,&rdquo; the Professor continued, &ldquo;I bought this
house and made a present of it to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom?&rdquo; Quest asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my servant Craig,&rdquo; the Professor admitted with a groan.</p>
<p>Lenora gave a little cry. She turned triumphantly towards the Inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All recollection as to its locality had escaped me,&rdquo; the
Professor continued sorrowfully. &ldquo;I remember that it was on the
anniversary of his having been with me for some fifteen years that I decided to
show him some substantial mark of my appreciation. I knew that he was looking
for a domicile for his father and mother, who are since both dead, and I
requested a house agent to send me in a list of suitable residences. This,
alas! was the one I purchased.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest glanced around the place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that the Professor&rsquo;s statement
now removes any doubt as to Craig&rsquo;s guilt. You are sure the house has
been closely watched, Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I received certain information,&rdquo; French replied, &ldquo;I
have had half-a-dozen of my best men in the vicinity. I can assure you that no
one has entered or left it during the last twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way to the piazza steps and entered by the front door. The
house was an ordinary framework one of moderate size, in poor repair, and
showing signs of great neglect. The rooms were barely furnished, and their
first cursory search revealed no traces of habitation. There was still the
broken skylight in the room which Lenora had occupied, and the bed upon which
she had slept was still crumpled. French, who had been tapping the walls
downstairs, called to them. They trooped down into the hall. The Inspector was
standing before what appeared to be an ordinary panel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, glancing out of the corner of his eye to
be sure that Laura was there, &ldquo;let me show you what I have just
discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He felt with his thumb for a spring. In a moment or two a portion of the
wall, about two feet in extent, slowly revolved, disclosing a small cupboard
fitted with a telephone instrument.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A telephone,&rdquo; the Inspector remarked, pointing to it, &ldquo;in
an unoccupied house and a concealed cupboard. What do you think of
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; he groaned.</p>
<p>French took the receiver from its rest and called up the exchange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inspector French speaking,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Kindly tell me
what is the number of the telephone from which I am speaking, and who is the
subscriber?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened to the reply and asked another question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me when this instrument was last used?&hellip;
When?&hellip; Thank you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector hung up the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The subscriber&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; he told them drily, &ldquo;is
Brown. The number is not entered in the book, by request. The telephone was
used an hour ago from a call office, and connection was established. That is to
say that some one spoke from this telephone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if your men have maintained their search properly, that some
one,&rdquo; Quest said slowly, &ldquo;must be in the house at the present
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without a doubt,&rdquo; the Inspector agreed. &ldquo;I should like to
suggest,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that the two young ladies wait for us now in
the automobile. If this man turns out as desperate as he has shown himself
ingenious, there may be a little trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They both protested vigorously. Quest shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must decide for themselves,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Personally, I
like Lenora, who has had less experience of such adventures, to grow accustomed
to danger&hellip;. With your permission, Inspector, I am going to search the
front room on the first floor before we do anything else. I think that if you
wait here I may be able to show you something directly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest ascended the stairs and entered a wholly unfurnished room on the
left-hand side. He looked for a minute contemplatively at a large but rather
shallow cupboard, the door of which stood open, and tapped lightly with his
forefinger upon the back part of it. Then he withdrew a few feet and, drawing
out his revolver, deliberately fired into the floor, a few inches inside. There
was a half stifled cry. The false back suddenly swung open and a man rushed
out. Quest&rsquo;s revolver covered him, but there was no necessity for its
use. Craig, smothered with dust, his face white as a piece of marble, even his
jaw shaking with fear, was wholly unarmed. He seemed, in fact, incapable of any
form of resistance. He threw himself upon his knees before Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me!&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;Help me to get away from this
house! You don&rsquo;t belong to the police. I&rsquo;ll give you every penny I
have in the world to let me go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest smiled at him derisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>Very slowly Craig obeyed him. He was a pitiful-looking object, but a single
look into Quest&rsquo;s face showed him the folly of any sort of appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk out of the room,&rdquo; Quest ordered, &ldquo;in front of
me&mdash;so! Now, then, turn to the right and go down the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all gave a little cry as they saw him appear, a trembling, pitiful
creature, glancing around like a trapped animal. He commenced to descend the
stairs, holding tightly to the banisters. Quest remained on the landing above,
his revolver in his hand. French waited in the hall below, also armed. Laura
gripped Lenora&rsquo;s arm in excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve got him now!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Got him,
sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the fourth or fifth stair, Craig hesitated. He suddenly saw the Professor
standing below. He gripped the banisters with one hand. The other he flung out
in a threatening gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me away to these bloodhounds!&rdquo; he
cried,&mdash;&ldquo;you, for whom I have toiled and slaved, whom I have
followed all over the world, whom I have served faithfully with the last breath
of my body and the last drop of blood in my veins! You have brought them
here&mdash;tracked me down! You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head sorrowfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have been the best servant man ever
had. If you are innocent of these crimes, you can clear yourself. If you are
guilty, a dog&rsquo;s death is none too good for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig seemed to sway for a moment upon his feet. Only Lenora, from the hall,
saw that he was fitting his right foot into what seemed to be a leather loop
hanging from the banisters. Then a wild shout of surprise broke from the lips
of all of them, followed by a moment of stupefied wonder. The whole staircase
suddenly began to revolve. Craig, clinging to the banisters, disappeared. In a
moment or two there was a fresh click. Another set of stairs, almost identical
to the first, had taken their place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cellar!&rdquo; Quest shouted, as he rushed down the stairs.
&ldquo;Quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They wrenched open the wooden door and hurried down the dark steps into the
gloomy, unlit cellar. The place was crowded with packing-cases, and two large
wine barrels stood in the corner. At the farther end was a door. Quest rushed
for it and stood on guard. A moment later, however, he called to Laura and
pressed his revolver into her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand here,&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Shoot him if he tries to run
out. I&rsquo;ll search in the packing-cases. He might be dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor, out of breath, was leaning against one of the pillars, his
arm passed around it for support. Lenora, with Quest and French, searched
hastily amongst the packing-cases. Suddenly there was a loud crack, the sound
of falling masonry, followed by a scream from Laura. French, with a roar of
anger, rushed towards her. She was lying on her side, already half covered by
falling bricks and masonry. He dragged her away, just in time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God, she&rsquo;s fainted!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Laura faltered, trying to open her eyes,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m not going to, but I think my arm&rsquo;s broken, and my
side hurts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s not down here, anyway,&rdquo; Quest declared.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s help her upstairs and get her out of this devil&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They supported her up the steps and found a chair for her in the hall. She
was white almost to the lips, but she struggled bravely to keep
consciousness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you bother about me,&rdquo; she begged.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that blackguard go! You find him. I shall be all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector swung open the telephone cupboard and called for an ambulance.
Then Quest, who had been examining the staircase, suddenly gave a little
exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done us!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Look here, French, this
is the original staircase. There&rsquo;s the leather loop. I know it because
there was a crack on the fourth stair. When we rushed down the cellar after
him, he swung the thing round again and simply walked out of the front door.
Damn it, man, it&rsquo;s open!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried outside. French blew his whistle. One of the plain-clothes men
came running up from the avenue. He was looking a little sheepish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; French demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone off,&rdquo; was the unwilling reply. &ldquo;I guess
that chap&rsquo;s given us the slip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak up,&rdquo; French insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The only place,&rdquo; the man went on, &ldquo;we hadn&rsquo;t our
eyes glued on, was the front door. He must have come out through that.
There&rsquo;s been a motor truck with one or two queer-looking chaps in it, at
the corner of the avenue there for the last ten minutes. I&rsquo;d just made up
my mind to stroll round and see what it was up to when Jim, who was on the
other side, shouted out. A man jumped up into it and they made off at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could he have come from this house?&rdquo; French asked sternly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess, if he&rsquo;d come out from the front door, he might just
have done it,&rdquo; the man admitted.</p>
<p>Quest and the Inspector exchanged glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s done us!&rdquo; Quest muttered,&mdash;&ldquo;done us like
a couple of greenhorns!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector&rsquo;s rubicund countenance was white with fury. His head
kept turning in the direction of Laura, to whom the Professor was busy
rendering first aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I never take another job on as long as I live,&rdquo; he declared,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that fellow before I&rsquo;m through!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">The Professor roused himself from what had apparently been a
very gloomy reverie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;I must go home. It has been very
kind of you, Mr. Quest, to keep me here for so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest glanced at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t hurry, Mr. Ashleigh,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We may get
some news at any moment. French has a dozen men out on the search and he has
promised to ring me up immediately he hears anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;who for twenty years can deceive
his master as utterly and completely as Craig has done me, who is capable of
such diabolical outrages, and who, when capture stares him in the face, is
capable of an escape such as he made to-day, is outside the laws of
probability. Personally, I do not believe that I shall ever again see the face
of my servant, any more than that you, Quest, will entirely solve the mystery
of these murders and the theft of the Rheinholdt jewels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora, who, with her hat on, was packing a small bag at the other end of
the room, glanced up for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man is a demon!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;He would have
sacrificed us all, if he could. When I think of poor Laura lying there in the
hospital, crushed almost to death, so that he could save his miserable carcass,
and realise that he is free, I feel&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped short. Quest looked at her and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind hurting our feelings, Lenora,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;French and I are up against it all right. We&rsquo;re second best, at
the present moment&mdash;I&rsquo;ll admit that&mdash;but the end hasn&rsquo;t
come yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I was led away for a moment.
But, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she went on piteously, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t we do
something? Laura&rsquo;s so brave. She tried to laugh when I left her, an hour
ago, but I could see all the time that she was suffering agony. Fancy a man
doing that to a woman! It makes me feel that I can&rsquo;t rest or sleep. I
think that when I have left the hospital I shall just walk up and down the
streets and watch and search.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That sort of thing won&rsquo;t do any good,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t any use, Lenora, working without a plan. That&rsquo;s why
I&rsquo;m here now, waiting. I want to formulate a plan first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are we,&rdquo; the Professor asked drearily, &ldquo;to make plans
against a fiend like that? What can we do against men who have revolving
staircases and trolley-loads of river pirates waiting for them? You may be a
scientific criminologist, Quest, but that fellow Craig is a scientific
criminal, if ever there was one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest crossed the room towards his cigar cabinet, and opened it. His little
start was apparent to both of them. Lenora laid down the bag which she had just
lifted up. The Professor leaned forward in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Quest?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Quest stretched out his hand and picked up from the top of the cigars a
small black box! He laid it on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unless I am very much mistaken,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is another
communication from our mysterious friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; the Professor exclaimed hoarsely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can he have been here?&rdquo; Lenora cried.</p>
<p>Quest removed the lid from the box and drew out a circular card. Around the
outside edge was a very clever pen and ink sketch of a lifebuoy, and inside the
margin were several sentences of clear handwriting. In the middle was the
signature&mdash;the clenched hands! Quest read the message aloud&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;In the great scheme of things, the Supreme Ruler of
the Universe divided an inheritance amongst His children. To one He gave power,
to another strength, to another beauty, but to His favourites He gave
cunning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all looked at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; Lenora gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lifebuoy!&rdquo; the Professor murmured.</p>
<p>They both stared at Quest, who remained silent, chewing hard at the end of
his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every message,&rdquo; he said, speaking half to himself, &ldquo;has
had some significance. What does this mean&mdash;a lifebuoy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silent for a moment. Then he turned suddenly to the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you call those men in the motor-truck, Professor&mdash;river
pirates? And a lifebuoy! Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crossed the room towards his desk and returned with a list in his hand.
He ran his finger down it, stopped and glanced at the date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Durham</i>,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;cargo cotton,
destination Southampton, sails at high tide on the 16th. Lenora, is that
calendar right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the 16th, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>Quest crossed the room to the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want Number One Central, Exchange,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Thank
you! Put me through to Mr. French&rsquo;s office&hellip;. Hullo, French!
I&rsquo;ve got an idea. Can you come round here at once and bring an
automobile? I want to get down to the docks&mdash;not where the passenger
steamers start from&mdash;lower down&hellip;. Good! We&rsquo;ll
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest hung up the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Professor,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that fellow
wouldn&rsquo;t dare to send this message if he wasn&rsquo;t pretty sure of
getting off. He&rsquo;s made all his plans beforehand, but it&rsquo;s my belief
we shall just get our hands upon him, after all. Lenora, you&rsquo;d better get
along round to the hospital. You don&rsquo;t come in this time. It&rsquo;s bad
enough to have Laura laid up&mdash;can&rsquo;t risk you. There&rsquo;ll be a
little trouble, too, before we&rsquo;re through, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora sighed as she picked up her bag.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it weren&rsquo;t for Laura,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;d
find it pretty hard to keep me away. I think that if I could see the handcuffs
put on that man, it would be the happiest moment of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him all right,&rdquo; Quest promised. &ldquo;Remember
me to Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And present my compliments, also,&rdquo; the Professor begged.</p>
<p>Lenora left them. The Professor, his spirits apparently a little improved by
the prospect of action, accepted some whisky and a cigar. Presently they heard
the automobile stop outside and French appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything doing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Quest showed him the card and the sailing list. The Inspector nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that fellow&rsquo;s some sport!&rdquo; he remarked admiringly.
&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t believe it just to look at him. That staircase this
afternoon, though, kind of teaches one not to trust to appearances. So you
think he&rsquo;s getting a move on him, Mr. Quest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he had a truck waiting for him at the corner of Gayson
Avenue,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;It was the machine my men went after. The
men looked like river thugs, although I shouldn&rsquo;t have thought of it if
the Professor hadn&rsquo;t used the word &lsquo;river pirates.&rsquo;
It&rsquo;s quite clear that they took Craig down to the river. There&rsquo;s
only one likely ship sailing to-night and that&rsquo;s the <i>Durham</i>.
It&rsquo;s my belief Craig&rsquo;s on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector glanced at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve got to make tracks,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;and
pretty quick, too. She&rsquo;ll be starting from somewhere about Number
Twenty-eight dock, a long way down. Come along, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hurried out to the automobile and started off for the docks. The latter
part of their journey was accomplished under difficulties, for the street was
packed with drays and heavy vehicles. They reached dock Number Twenty-eight at
last, however, and hurried through the shed on to the wharf. There were no
signs of a steamer there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the <i>Durham</i>?&rdquo; Quest asked one of the
carters, who was just getting his team together.</p>
<p>The man pointed out to the middle of the river, where a small steamer was
lying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There she is,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll be off in a few
minutes. You&rsquo;ll hear the sirens directly, when they begin to move
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest led the way quickly to the edge of the wharf. There was a small tug
there, the crew of which were just making her fast for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty dollars if you&rsquo;ll take us out to the <i>Durham</i> and
catch her before she sails,&rdquo; Quest shouted to the man who seemed to be
the captain. &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man spat out a plug of tobacco from his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d take you to hell for fifty dollars,&rdquo; he answered
tersely. &ldquo;Step in. We&rsquo;ll make it, if you look quick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They clambered down the iron ladder and jumped on to the deck of the tug.
The captain seized the wheel. The two men who formed the crew took off their
coats and waistcoats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it her, Jim,&rdquo; the former ordered. &ldquo;Now, then, here
goes! We&rsquo;ll just miss the ferry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They swung around and commenced their journey. Quest stood with his watch in
his hand. They were getting up the anchor of the <i>Durham</i>, and from higher
up the river came the screech of steamers beginning to move on their outward
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it all right,&rdquo; the captain assured them.</p>
<p>They were within a hundred yards of the <i>Durham</i> when Quest gave a
little exclamation. From the other side of the steamer another tug shot away,
turning back towards New York. Huddled up in the stern, half concealed in a
tarpaulin, was a man in a plain black suit. Quest, with a little shout,
recognised the man at the helm from his long brown beard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of those fellows who was in the truck,&rdquo; he
declared, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s Craig in the stern! We&rsquo;ve got him this
time. Say, Captain, it&rsquo;s that tug I want. Never mind about the steamer.
Catch it and I&rsquo;ll make it a hundred dollars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man swung round the wheel, but he glanced at Quest a little
doubtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what is this show?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Quest opened his coat and displayed his badge. He pointed to the
Inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police job. This is Inspector French, I am Sanford Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the bloke
wanted for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder,&rdquo; Quest answered shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That so?&rdquo; the other remarked. &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll get
him, sure! He&rsquo;s looking pretty scared, too. You&rsquo;d better keep your
eyes open, though. I don&rsquo;t know how many men there are on board, but that
tug belongs to the toughest crew up the river. Got anything handy in the way of
firearms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to worry,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
automatics here, but as long as we&rsquo;re heading them this way,
they&rsquo;ll know the game&rsquo;s up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got her!&rdquo; the captain exclaimed.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the ferry and the first of the steamers coming down in the
middle. They&rsquo;ll have to chuck it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Right ahead of them, blazing with lights, a huge ferry came churning the
river up and sending great waves in their direction. On the other side,
unnaturally large, loomed up the great bows of an ocean-going steamer. The tug
was swung round and they ran up alongside. The man with the beard leaned
over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s your trouble?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>The Inspector stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want that man you&rsquo;ve got under the tarpaulin,&rdquo; he
announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you ain&rsquo;t the river police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Inspector French from headquarters,&rdquo; was the curt
reply. &ldquo;The sooner you hand him over, the better for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear that, O&rsquo;Toole?&rdquo; the other remarked, swinging
round on his heel. &ldquo;Get up, you blackguard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man rose from underneath the oilskin. He was wearing Craig&rsquo;s
clothes, but his face was the face of a stranger. As quick as lightning, Quest
swung round in his place.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve lost our chance, guvnor,&rdquo; he pointed out,
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest set his teeth and gripped the Inspector&rsquo;s arm. The place where
the <i>Durham</i> had been anchored was empty. Already, half a mile down the
river, with a trail of light behind and her siren shrieking, the <i>Durham</i>
was standing out seawards.</p>
<h2><a name="ch9" id="ch9"></a>IX.&mdash;THE INHERITED SIN</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">&ldquo;Getting kind of used to these courthouse shows,
aren&rsquo;t you, Lenora?&rdquo; Quest remarked, as they stepped from the
automobile and entered the house in Georgia Square.</p>
<p>Lenora shrugged her shoulders. She was certainly a very different-looking
person from the tired, trembling girl who had heard Macdougal sentenced not
many weeks ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could anyone feel much sympathy,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;with those
men? Red Gallagher, as they all called him, is more like a great brute animal
than a human being. I think that even if they had sentenced him to death I
should have felt that it was quite the proper thing to have done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much sentiment about those things,&rdquo; Quest agreed, clipping
the end off a cigar. &ldquo;Men like that are better off the face of the earth.
They did their best to send me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a cablegram for you!&rdquo; Lenora exclaimed, bringing
it over to him. &ldquo;Mr. Quest, I wonder if it&rsquo;s from Scotland
Yard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest tore it open. They read it together, Lenora standing on tiptoe to peer
over his shoulder:</p>
<p class="quote"><tt>STOWAWAY ANSWERING IN EVERY RESPECT YOUR DESCRIPTION OF
CRAIG FOUND ON "DURHAM." HAS BEEN ARRESTED, AS DESIRED, AND WILL BE TAKEN TO
HAMBLIN HOUSE FOR IDENTIFICATION BY LORD ASHLEIGH. REPLY WHETHER YOU ARE COMING
OVER, AND FULL DETAILS AS TO CHARGE.</tt></p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for Scotland Yard!&rdquo; Quest declared. &ldquo;So
they&rsquo;ve got him, eh? All the same, that fellow&rsquo;s as slippery as an
eel. Lenora, how should you like a trip across the ocean, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should love it,&rdquo; Lenora replied. &ldquo;Do you mean it
really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow&rsquo;s fooled me pretty well,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;but somehow I feel that if I get my hands on him this time,
they&rsquo;ll stay there till he stands where Red Gallagher did to-day. I
don&rsquo;t feel content to let anyone else finish off the job. Got any
relatives over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an aunt in London,&rdquo; Lenora told him, &ldquo;the dearest
old lady you ever knew. She&rsquo;d give anything to have me make her a
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest moved across to his desk and took up a sailing list. He studied it for
a few moments and turned back to Lenora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send a cable off at once to Scotland Yard,&rdquo; he directed.
&ldquo;Say&mdash;&lsquo;Am sailing on <i>Lusitania</i> to-morrow. Hold
prisoner. Charge very serious. Have full warrants.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora wrote down the message and went to the telephone to send it off. As
soon as she had finished, Quest took up his hat again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;The machine&rsquo;s outside.
We&rsquo;ll just go and look in on the Professor and tell him the news. Poor
old chap, I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;ll never be the same man again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must miss Craig terribly,&rdquo; Lenora observed, as they took
their places in the automobile, &ldquo;and yet, Mr. Quest, it does seem to me a
most amazing thing that a man so utterly callous and cruel as Craig must be,
should have been a devoted and faithful servant to anyone through all these
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am beginning to frame a theory about that. You see, all the time
Craig has lived with the Professor, he has been a sort of dabbler with him in
his studies. Where the Professor&rsquo;s gone right into a thing and understood
it, Craig, you see, hasn&rsquo;t managed to get past the first crust. His brain
wasn&rsquo;t educated enough for the subjects into the consideration of which
the Professor may have led him. See what I&rsquo;m driving at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that he may have been mad?&rdquo; Lenora suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of that sort,&rdquo; Quest assented. &ldquo;Seems to me the
only feasible explanation. The Professor&rsquo;s a bit of a terror, you know.
There are some queer stories about the way he got some of his earlier specimens
in South America. Science is his god. What he has gone through in some of those
foreign countries, no one knows. Quite enough to unbalance any man of ordinary
nerves and temperament.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor himself is remarkably sane,&rdquo; Lenora observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; Quest agreed, &ldquo;but then, you see, his brain
was big enough, to start with. It could hold all there was for it to hold.
It&rsquo;s like pouring stuff into the wrong receptacle when a man like Craig
tries to follow him. However, that&rsquo;s only a theory. Here we are, and the
front door wide open. I wonder how our friend&rsquo;s feeling
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the Professor on his hands and knees upon a dusty floor.
Carefully arranged before him were the bones of a skeleton, each laid in some
appointed place. He had a chart on either side of him, and a third one on an
easel. He looked up a little impatiently at the sound of the opening of the
door, but when he recognised Quest and his companion the annoyance passed from
his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we disturbing you, Mr. Ashleigh?&rdquo; Quest enquired.</p>
<p>The Professor rose to his feet and brushed the dust from his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad of a rest,&rdquo; he said simply. &ldquo;You see what
I am doing? I am trying to reconstruct from memory&mdash;and a little
imagination, perhaps&mdash;the important part of my missing skeleton.
It&rsquo;s a wonderful problem which those bones might have solved, if I had
been able to place them fairly before the scientists of the world. Do you
understand much about the human frame, Mr. Quest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest shook his head promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still life doesn&rsquo;t interest me,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;Bones are bones, after all, you know. I don&rsquo;t even care who my
grandfather was, much less who my grandfather a million times removed might
have been. Let&rsquo;s step into the study for a moment, Professor, if you
don&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;Lenora here is a little sensitive
to smell, and a spray of lavender water on some of your bones wouldn&rsquo;t do
them any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor ambled amiably towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never notice it myself,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Very likely that is
because I see beyond these withered fragments into the prehistoric worlds
whence they came. I sit here alone sometimes, and the curtain rolls up, and I
find myself back in one of those far corners of South America, or even in a
certain spot in East Africa, and I can almost fancy that time rolls back like
an unwinding reel and there are no secrets into which I may not look. And then
the moment passes and I remember that this dry-as-dust world is shrieking
always for proofs&mdash;this extraordinary conglomeration of human animals in
weird attire, with monstrous tastes and extraordinary habits, who make up what
they call the civilized world. Civilized!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the study and Quest produced his cigar case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t imagine any world that existed before tobacco,&rdquo; he
remarked cheerfully. &ldquo;Help yourself, Professor. It does me good to see
you human enough to enjoy a cigar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never remember to buy any for myself,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
one of yours is always a treat. Miss Lenora, I am glad to see, is completely
recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am quite well, thank you, Mr. Ashleigh,&rdquo; Lenora replied.
&ldquo;I am even forgetting that I ever had nerves. I have been in the
courthouse all the morning, and I even looked curiously at your garage as we
drove up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good&mdash;very good, my dear!&rdquo; the Professor murmured.
&ldquo;At the courthouse, eh? Were those charming friends of yours from Bethel
being tried, Quest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red Gallagher and his mate! Yes, they got it in the neck,
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; the Professor exclaimed, his eyes sparkling with
appreciation of his own wit, &ldquo;I think that they ought to have got it
round the neck! However, let us be thankful that they are disposed of. Their
attack upon you, Mr. Quest, introduced rather a curious factor into our
troubles. Even now I find it a little difficult to follow the workings of our
friend French&rsquo;s mind. It seems hard to believe that he could really have
imagined you guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;French is all right,&rdquo; Quest declared. &ldquo;He fell into the
common error of the detective without imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that unhappy man Craig?&rdquo; the Professor asked
gloomily. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t the <i>Durham</i> almost due now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest took out the cablegram from his pocket and passed it over. The
Professor&rsquo;s fingers trembled a little as he read it. He passed it back,
however, without immediate comment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, they have been cleverer over there than we were,&rdquo;
Quest remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; the Professor assented. &ldquo;They seem, at least,
to have arrested the man. Even now I can scarcely believe that it is
Craig&mdash;my servant Craig&mdash;who is lying in an English prison. Do you
know that his people have been servants in the Ashleigh family for some
hundreds of years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest was clearly interested. &ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;d like to hear about
that!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You know, I&rsquo;m rather great on heredity,
Professor. What class did he come from then? Were his people just domestic
servants always?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor&rsquo;s face was for a moment troubled. He moved to his desk,
rummaged about for a time, and finally produced an ancient volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This really belongs to my brother, Lord Ashleigh,&rdquo; he
explained. &ldquo;He brought it over with him to show me some entries
concerning which I was interested. It contains a history of the Hamblin estate
since the days of Cromwell, and here in the back, you see, is a list of our
farmers, bailiffs and domestic servants. There was a Craig who was a tenant of
the first Lord Ashleigh and fought with him in the Cromwellian Wars as a
trooper and since those days, so far as I can see, there has never been a time
when there hasn&rsquo;t been a Craig in the service of our family. A fine race
they seem to have been, until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until when?&rdquo; Quest demanded.</p>
<p>The look of trouble had once more clouded the Professor&rsquo;s face. He
shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until Craig&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I am afraid I
must admit that we come upon a bad piece of family history here. Silas Craig
entered the service of my father in 1858, as under game-keeper. Here we come
upon the first black mark against the name. He appears to have lived reputably
for some years, and then, after a quarrel with a neighbour about some trivial
matter, he deliberately murdered him, a crime for which he was tried and
executed in 1867. John Craig, his only son, entered our service in 1880, and,
when I left England, accompanied me as my valet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s silence. Quest shook his head a little
reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a scientific man, you
appreciate the significance of heredity, yet during all this time, when you
must have seen for yourself the evidence culminating against Craig, you never
mentioned this&mdash;this&mdash;damning piece of evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor closed the book with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not mention it, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he acknowledged,
&ldquo;because I did not believe in Craig&rsquo;s guilt and I did not wish to
further prejudice you against him. That is the whole and simple truth. Now tell
me what you are going to do about his arrest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora and I are sailing to-morrow,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;We
are taking over the necessary warrants and shall bring Craig back here for
trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor smoked thoughtfully for some moments. Then he rose
deliberately to his feet. He had come to a decision. He announced it calmly but
irrevocably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall come with you,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I shall be glad of
a visit to England, but apart from that I feel it to be my duty. I owe it to
Craig to see that he has a fair chance, and I owe it to the law to see that he
pays the penalty, if indeed he is guilty of these crimes. Is Miss Laura
accompanying you, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From what the surgeons tell us,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it will be
some weeks before she is able to travel. At the same time, I must tell you that
I am glad of your decision, Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my duty,&rdquo; the latter declared. &ldquo;I cannot rest in
this state of uncertainty. If Craig is lost to me, the sooner I face the fact
the better. At the same time I will be frank with you. Notwithstanding all this
accumulated pile of evidence I feel in my heart the urgent necessity of seeing
him face to face, of holding him by the shoulders and asking him whether these
things are true. We have faced death together, Craig and I. We have done more
than that&mdash;we have courted it. There is nothing about him I can accept
from hearsay. I shall go with you to England, Mr. Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">The Professor rose from his seat in some excitement as the
carriage passed through the great gates of Hamblin Park. He acknowledged with a
smile the respectful curtsey of the woman who held it open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have now an opportunity, my dear Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;of appreciating one feature of English life not entirely reproducible in
your own wonderful country. I mean the home life and surroundings of our
aristocracy. You see these oak trees?&rdquo; he went on, with a little wave of
his hand. &ldquo;They were planted by my ancestors in the days of Henry the
Eighth. I have been a student of tree life in South America and in the dense
forests of Central Africa, but for real character, for splendour of growth and
hardiness, there is nothing in the world to touch the Ashleigh oaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re some trees,&rdquo; the criminologist admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You notice, perhaps, the smaller ones, which seem dwarfed. Their tops
were cut off by the Lord of Ashleigh on the day that Lady Jane Grey was
beheaded. Queen Elizabeth heard of it and threatened to confiscate the estate.
Look at the turf, my friend. Ages have gone to the making of that mossy, velvet
carpet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the house?&rdquo; Quest enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mile farther on yet. The woods part and make a natural avenue past
the bend of the river there,&rdquo; the Professor pointed out. &ldquo;Full of
trout, that river, Quest. How I used to whip that stream when I was a
boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They swept presently round a bend in the avenue. Before them on the
hill-side, surrounded by trees and with a great walled garden behind, was
Hamblin House. Quest gave vent to a little exclamation of wonder as he looked
at it. The older part and the whole of the west front was Elizabethan, but the
Georgian architect entrusted with the task of building a great extension had
carried out his work in a manner almost inspired. Lines and curves, sweeping
everywhere towards the same constructive purpose, had been harmonised by the
hand of time into a most surprising and effectual unity. The criminologist,
notwithstanding his unemotional temperament, repeated his exclamation as he
resumed his place in the carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where you&rsquo;ve got us beaten,&rdquo; he admitted.
&ldquo;Our country places are like gew-gaw palaces compared to this. Makes me
kind of sorry,&rdquo; he went on regretfully, &ldquo;that I didn&rsquo;t bring
Lenora along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were very wise,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My brother and Lady
Ashleigh have recovered from the shock of poor Lena&rsquo;s death in a
marvellous manner, I believe, but the sight of the girl might have brought it
back to them. You have left her with friends, I hope, Mr. Quest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has an aunt in Hampstead,&rdquo; the latter explained. &ldquo;I
should have liked to have seen her safely there myself, but we should have been
an hour or two later down here, and I tell you,&rdquo; he went on, his voice
gathering a note almost of ferocity, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m wanting to get my hands
on that fellow Craig! I wonder where they&rsquo;re holding him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the local police-station, I expect,&rdquo; the Professor replied.
&ldquo;My brother is a magistrate, of course, and he would see that proper
arrangements were made. There he is at the hall door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The carriage drew up before the great front, a moment or two later. Lord
Ashleigh came forward with outstretched hands, the genial smile of the
welcoming host upon his lips. In his manner, however, there was a distinct note
of anxiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edgar, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;I am delighted!
Welcome back to your home! Mr. Quest, I am very happy to see you here. You have
heard the news, of course?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have heard nothing!&rdquo; the Professor replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t go to Scotland Yard?&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t been to London at all,&rdquo; Quest explained.
&ldquo;We got on the boat train at Plymouth, and your brother managed to induce
one of the directors whom he saw on the platform to stop the train for us at
Hamblin Road. We only left the boat two hours ago. There&rsquo;s nothing wrong
with Craig, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Ashleigh motioned them to follow him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please come this way,&rdquo; he invited.</p>
<p>He led them across the hall&mdash;which, dimly-lit and with its
stained-glass windows, was almost like the nave of a cathedral,&mdash;into the
library beyond. He closed the door and turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have bad news for you both,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Craig has
escaped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither the Professor nor Quest betrayed any unusual surprise. So far as the
latter was concerned, his first glimpse at Lord Ashleigh&rsquo;s face had
warned him of what was coming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; the Professor murmured, sinking into an easy-chair.
&ldquo;This is most unexpected!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get him again,&rdquo; Quest declared quickly. &ldquo;Can
you let us have the particulars of his escape, Lord Ashleigh? The sooner we get
the hang of things, the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their host turned towards the butler, who was arranging a tray upon the
sideboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must permit me to offer you some refreshments after your
journey,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;Then I will tell you the whole story. I think
you will agree, when you hear it, that no particular blame can be said to rest
upon any one&rsquo;s shoulders. It was simply an extraordinary interposition of
chance. There is tea, whisky and soda, and wine here, Mr. Quest. Edgar, I know
you&rsquo;ll take some tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;English tea for me,&rdquo; the Professor remarked, watching the
cream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisky and soda here,&rdquo; Quest decided.</p>
<p>Lord Ashleigh himself attended to the wants of his guests. Then, at his
instigation, they made themselves comfortable in easy-chairs and he commenced
his narration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, of course,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that Craig was arrested
at Liverpool in consequence of communications from the New York police. I
understand that it was with great difficulty he was discovered, and it is quite
clear that some one on the ship had been heavily bribed. However, he was
arrested, brought to London, and then down here for purposes of identification.
I would have gone to London myself, and in fact offered to do so, but on the
other hand, as there are many others on the estate to whom he was well-known, I
thought that it would be better to have more evidence than mine alone.
Accordingly, they left London one afternoon, and I sent a dogcart to the
station to meet them. They arrived quite safely and started for here, Craig
handcuffed to one of the Scotland Yard men on the back seat, and the other in
front with the driver. About half a mile from the south entrance to the park,
the road runs across a rather desolate strip of country with a lot of low
undergrowth on one side. We have had a little trouble with poachers, as there
is a sort of gipsy camp on some common land a short distance away. My
head-keeper, to whom the very idea of a poacher is intolerable, was patrolling
this ground himself that afternoon, and caught sight of one of these gipsy
fellows setting a trap. He chased him, and more, I am sure, to frighten him
than anything else, when he saw that the fellow was getting away he fired his
gun, just as the dog-cart was passing. The horse shied, the wheel caught a
great stone by the side of the road, and all four men were thrown out. The man
to whom Craig was handcuffed was stunned, but Craig himself appears to have
been unhurt. He jumped up, took the key of the handcuffs from the pocket of the
officer, undid them, and slipped off into the undergrowth before either the
groom or the other Scotland Yard man had recovered their senses. To cut a long
story short, that was last Thursday, and up till now not a single trace of the
fellow has been discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest rose abruptly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to take this matter up right on the spot where Craig
disappeared,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t we do that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh agreed, touching a bell. &ldquo;We
have several hours before we change for dinner. I will have a car round and
take you to the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor acquiesced readily, and very soon they stepped out of the
automobile on to the side of a narrow road, looking very much as it had been
described. Further on, beyond a stretch of open common, they could see the
smoke from the gipsy encampment. On their left-hand side was a stretch of
absolutely wild country, bounded in the far distance by the grey stone wall of
the park. Lord Ashleigh led the way through the thicket, talking as he
went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig came along through here,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;The groom
and the Scotland Yard man who had been sitting by his side followed him. They
searched for an hour but found no trace of him at all. Then they returned to
the house to make a report and get help. I will now show you how Craig first
eluded them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way along a tangled path, doubled back, plunged into a little
spinney and came suddenly to a small shed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an ancient gamekeeper&rsquo;s shelter,&rdquo; he explained,
&ldquo;built a long time ago and almost forgotten now. What Craig did, without
a doubt, was to hide in this. The Scotland Yard man who took the affair in hand
found distinct traces here of recent occupation. That is how he made his first
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Well now, what about your more
extended search?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was coming to that,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh replied. &ldquo;As Edgar
will remember, no doubt, I have always kept a few bloodhounds in my kennels,
and as soon as we could get together one or two of the keepers and a few of the
local constabulary, we started off again from here. The dogs brought us without
a check to this shed, and started off again in this way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked another half a mile, across a reedy swamp. Every now and then
they had to jump across a small dyke, and once they had to make a detour to
avoid an osier bed. They came at last to the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I can show you exactly how that fellow put us off the scent
here,&rdquo; their guide proceeded. &ldquo;He seems to have picked up
something, Edgar, in those South American trips of yours, for a cleverer thing
I never saw. You see all these bullrushes everywhere&mdash;clouds of them, all
along the river?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We call them tules,&rdquo; Quest muttered. &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Craig arrived here,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh continued, &ldquo;he
must have heard the baying of the dogs in the distance and he knew that the
game was up unless he could put them off the scent. He cut a quantity of these
bullrushes from a place a little further behind those trees there, stepped
boldly into the middle of the water, waded down to that spot where, as you see,
the trees hang over, stood stock still and leaned them all around him. It was
dusk when the chase reached the river bank, and I have no doubt the bullrushes
presented quite a natural appearance. At any rate, although the dogs came
without a check to the edge of the river, where he stepped off, they never
picked the scent up again either on this side or the other. We tried them for
four or five hours before we took them home. The next morning, while the place
was being thoroughly searched, we came upon the spot where these bullrushes had
been cut down, and we found them caught in the low boughs of a tree, drifting
down the river.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor&rsquo;s tone was filled with something almost like
admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must confess,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I never realised for a
single moment that Craig was a person of such gifts. In all the small ways of
life, in campaigning, camping out, dealing with natural difficulties incidental
to our expeditions, I have found him invariably a person of resource,
ready-witted and full of useful suggestions. But that he should be able to
apply his gifts with such infinite cunning, to a suddenly conceived career of
crime, I must admit amazes me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest had lit a fresh cigar and was smoking vigorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What astonishes me more than anything,&rdquo; he pronounced, as he
stood looking over the desolate expanse of country, &ldquo;is that when one
comes face to face with the fellow he presents all the appearance of a
nerveless and broken-down coward. Then all of a sudden there spring up these
evidences of the most amazing, the most diabolical resource&hellip;.
Who&rsquo;s this, Lord Ashleigh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The latter turned his head. An elderly man in a brown velveteen suit, with
gaiters and thick boots, raised his hat respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my head-keeper, Middleton,&rdquo; his master explained.
&ldquo;He was with us on the chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor shook hands heartily with the newcomer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a day older, Middleton!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;So you are
the man who has given us all this trouble, eh? This gentleman and I have come
over from New York on purpose to lay hands on Craig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry, sir,&rdquo; the man replied. &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
have fired my gun if I had known what the consequences were going to be, but
them poaching devils that come round here rabbiting fairly send me furious and
that&rsquo;s a fact. It ain&rsquo;t that one grudges them a few rabbits, but my
tame pheasants all run out here from the home wood, and I&rsquo;ve seen
feathers at the side of the road there that no fox nor stoat had nothing to do
with. All the same, sir, I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;to have
been the cause of any inconvenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rather worse than inconvenience, Middleton,&rdquo; the
Professor said gravely. &ldquo;The man who has escaped is one of the worst
criminals of these days.&rdquo;</p>

"Several men stand around a pair of men crouched next to two bloodhounds.">
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Craig disappeared about here, sir&rdquo;&mdash;said
the gamekeeper.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get far, sir,&rdquo; the gamekeeper remarked, with a
little smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wild bit of country, this, and I admit that
men might search it for weeks without finding anything, but those gentlemen
from Scotland Yard, sir, if you&rsquo;ll excuse my making the remark, and
hoping that this gentleman,&rdquo; he added, looking at Quest, &ldquo;is in no
way connected with them&mdash;well, they don&rsquo;t know everything, and
that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gentleman is from the United States,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh
reminded him, &ldquo;so your criticism doesn&rsquo;t affect him. By-the-by,
Middleton, I heard this morning that you&rsquo;d been airing your opinions down
in the village. You seem to rather fancy yourself as a
thief-catcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as that, my lord,&rdquo; the man replied
respectfully, &ldquo;but still, I hope I may say that I&rsquo;ve as much common
sense as most people. You see, sir,&rdquo; he went on, turning to Quest,
&ldquo;the spots where he could emerge from this track of country are pretty
well guarded, and he&rsquo;ll be in a fine mess, when he does put in an
appearance, to show himself upon a public road. Yet by this time I should say
he must be nigh starved. Sooner or later he&rsquo;ll have to come out for food.
I&rsquo;ve a little scheme of my own, sir, I don&rsquo;t mind admitting,&rdquo;
the man concluded, with a twinkle in his keen brown eyes. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
giving it away. If I catch him for you, that&rsquo;s all that&rsquo;s wanted, I
imagine, and we shan&rsquo;t be any the nearer to it for letting any one into
my little secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His master smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have your rise out of the police, if you can,
Middleton,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;It seems queer, though, to believe that
the fellow&rsquo;s still in hiding round here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As though by common consent, they all stood, for a moment, perfectly still,
looking across the stretch of marshland with its boggy places, its scrubby
plantations, its clustering masses of tall grasses and bullrushes. The grey
twilight had become even more pronounced during the last few minutes. Little
wreaths of white mist hung over the damp places. Everywhere was a queer
silence. The very air seemed breathless. The Professor shivered and turned
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My nerves,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;are scarcely what they were. I
have listened in a primeval forest, listened for the soft rustling of a snake
in the undergrowth, or the distant roar of some beast of prey. I have listened
then with curiosity. I have not known fear. It seems to me, somehow, that in
this place there is something different afoot. I don&rsquo;t like it,
George&mdash;I don&rsquo;t like it. We will go home, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way, single file, to the road and up to the house. Lord
Ashleigh did his best to dispel a queer little sensation of uneasiness which
seemed to have arisen in the minds of all of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we must put aside our disappointment for
the present, and remember that after all the chances are that Craig will never
make his escape alive. Let us forget him for a little while&hellip;. Mr.
Quest,&rdquo; he added, a few minutes later, as they reached the hall,
&ldquo;Moreton here will show you to your room and look after you. Please let
me know if you will take an aperitif. I can recommend my sherry. We dine at
eight o&rsquo;clock. Edgar, you know your way. The blue room, of course. I am
coming up with you myself. Her ladyship back yet, Moreton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady Ashleigh,&rdquo; her husband explained, &ldquo;has gone to the
other side of the county to open a bazaar. She is looking forward to the
pleasure of welcoming you at dinner-time.&rdquo;</p>

"An aristocratic man dramatically points towards a down-trodden man.">
<p class="caption">Lord Ashleigh identifies the captured man as Craig.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Dinner, served, out of compliment to their transatlantic visitor, in the
great banqueting hall, was to Quest especially a most impressive meal. They sat
at a small round table lit by shaded lights, in the centre of an apartment
which was large in reality, and which seemed vast by reason of the shadows
which hovered around the unlit spaces. From the walls frowned down a long
succession of family portraits&mdash;Ashleighs in the queer Tudor costume of
Henry the Seventh; Ashleighs in chain armour, sword in hand, a charger waiting,
regardless of perspective, in the near distance; Ashleighs befrilled and
bewigged; Ashleighs in the Court dress of the Georges&mdash;judges, sailors,
statesmen and soldiers. A collection of armour which would have gladdened the
eye of many an antiquarian, was ranged along the black-panelled walls.
Everything was in harmony, even the grave precision of the solemn-faced butler
and the powdered hair of the two footmen. Quest, perhaps for the first time in
his life, felt almost lost, hopelessly out of touch with his surroundings, an
alien and a struggling figure. Nevertheless, he entertained the little party
with many stories. He struggled all the time against that queer sensation of
anachronism which now and then became almost oppressive.</p>
<p>The Professor&rsquo;s pleasure at finding himself once more amongst these
familiar surroundings was obvious and intense. The conversation between him and
his brother never flagged. There were tenants and neighbours to be asked after,
matters concerning the estate on which he demanded information. Even the very
servants&rsquo; names he remembered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a queer turn of fate, George,&rdquo; he declared, as he held
out before him a wonderfully chased glass filled with amber wine, &ldquo;which
sent you into the world a few seconds before me and made you Lord of Ashleigh
and me a struggling scientific man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world has benefited by it,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh remarked, with
more than fraternal courtesy. &ldquo;We hear great things of you over here,
Edgar. We hear that you have been on the point of proving most unpleasant
things with regard to our origin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there is no doubt about that,&rdquo; the Professor observed.
&ldquo;Where we came from and where we are going to are questions which no
longer afford room for the slightest doubt to the really scientific mind. What
sometimes does elude us is the nature of our tendencies while we are here on
earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine, I fancy, are obvious enough,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh
interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superficially, I grant it,&rdquo; his brother acknowledged. &ldquo;As
a matter of scientific fact, I recognize the probability of your actually being
a person utterly different from what you appear. Man becomes what he is
according to the circumstances by which he is assailed. Now your life here,
George, must be a singularly uneventful one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not during the last six months,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh remarked, with a
sigh. &ldquo;Even these last few days have been exciting enough. I must confess
that they have left me with a queer sort of nervousness. I find myself
listening intently sometimes,&mdash;conscious, as it were, of the influence or
presence of some indefinite danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very interesting,&rdquo; the Professor murmured. &ldquo;Spiritualism,
as an exact science, has always interested me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Ashleigh made a little grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t encourage George,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;He is much
too superstitious, as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a brief silence. The port had been placed upon the table and
coffee served. The servants, according to the custom of the house, had
departed. The great apartment was empty. Even Quest was impressed by some
peculiar significance in the long-drawn-out silence. He looked around him
uneasily. The frowning regard of that long line of painted warriors seemed
somehow to be full of menace. There was something grim, too, in the sight of
those empty suits of armour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be superstitious,&rdquo; Lord Ashleigh said, &ldquo;but there
are times, especially just lately, when I seem to find a new and hateful
quality in silence. What is it, I wonder? I ask you but I think I know. It is
the conviction that there is some alien presence, something disturbing lurking
close at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He suddenly rose to his feet, pushed his chair back and walked to the
window, which opened level with the ground. He threw it up and listened. The
others came over and joined him. There was nothing to be heard but the distant
hooting of an owl, and farther away the barking of some farmhouse dog. Lord
Ashleigh stood there with straining eyes, gazing out across the park.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was something here,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;something which
has gone. What&rsquo;s that? Quest, your eyes are younger than mine. Can you
see anything underneath that tree?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest peered out into the grey darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fancied I saw something moving in the shadow of that oak,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crossed the terrace, swung down on to the path, across a lawn, over a
wire fence and into the park itself. All the time he kept his eyes fixed on a
certain spot. When at last he reached the tree, there was nothing there. He
looked all around him. He stood and listened for several moments. A more
utterly peaceful night it would be hard to imagine. Slowly he made his way back
to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I imagine we are all a little nervous to-night,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing doing out there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They strolled about for an hour or more, looking into different rooms,
showing their guest the finest pictures, even taking him down into the
wonderful cellars. They parted early, but Quest stood, for a few moments before
retiring, gazing about him with an air almost of awe. His great room, as large
as an apartment in an Italian palace, was lit by a dozen wax candles in silver
candlesticks. His four-poster was supported by pillars of black oak, carved
into strange forms, and surmounted by the Ashleigh coronet and coat of arms. He
threw his windows open wide and stood for a moment looking out across the park,
more clearly visible now by the light of the slowly rising moon. There was
scarcely a breeze stirring, scarcely a sound even from the animal world.
Nevertheless, Quest, too, as reluctantly he made his preparations for retiring
for the night, was conscious of that queer sensation of unimagined and
impalpable danger.</p>
<h2><a name="ch10" id="ch10"></a>X.&mdash;LOST IN LONDON</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">Quest, notwithstanding the unusual nature of his surroundings,
slept that night as only a tired and healthy man can. He was awakened the next
morning by the quiet movements of a man-servant who had brought back his
clothes carefully brushed and pressed. He sat up in bed and discovered a small
china tea equipage by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your tea, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest drank half a cupful without protest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bath is ready at any time, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming right along,&rdquo; Quest replied, jumping out of
bed.</p>
<p>The man held up a dressing-gown and escorted him to an unexpectedly modern
bathroom at the end of the corridor. When Quest returned, his toilet articles
were all laid out for him with prim precision; the window was wide open, the
blinds drawn, and a soft breeze was stealing through into the room. Below him,
the park, looking more beautiful than ever in the morning sunshine, stretched
away to a vista of distant meadowlands and cornfields, with here and there a
little farm-house and outbuildings, gathered snugly together. The servant, who
had heard him leave the bathroom, reappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything further I can do for you, sir?&rdquo; he
enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, thanks,&rdquo; Quest assured him. &ldquo;What
time&rsquo;s breakfast?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breakfast is served at nine o&rsquo;clock, sir. It is now half-past
eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man withdrew and Quest made a brisk toilet. The nameless fears of the
previous night had altogether disappeared. To his saner morning imagination,
the atmosphere seemed somehow to have become cleared of that cloud of
mysterious depression. He was whistling to himself from sheer light-heartedness
as he turned to leave the room. Then the shock came. At the last moment he
stretched out his hand to take a handkerchief from his satchel. A sudden
exclamation broke from his lips. He stood for a moment as though turned to
stone. Before him, on the top of the little pile of white cambric, was a small
black box! With a movement of the fingers which was almost mechanical, he
removed the lid and drew out the customary little scrap of paper. He smoothed
it out before him on the dressing-case and read the message:&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;You will fail here as you have failed before. Better
go back. There is more danger for you in this country than you dream
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His teeth came fiercely together and his hands were clenched. His thoughts
had gone like a flash to Lenora. Was it possible that harm was intended to her?
He put the idea away from him almost as soon as conceived. The thing was
unimaginable. Craig was here, must be here, in the close vicinity of the house.
He could have had no time to communicate with confederates in London. Lenora,
at any rate, was safe. Then he glanced around the room and thought for a moment
of his own danger. In the dead of the night, as he had slept, mysterious feet
had stolen across his room, mysterious hands had placed those few words of half
mocking warning in that simple hiding-place! It would have been just as easy,
he reflected with a grim little smile, for those hands to have stretched their
death-dealing fingers over the bed where he had lain asleep. He looked once
more out over the park. Somehow, its sunny peace seemed to have become
disturbed. The strange sense of foreboding which he, in common with the others,
had carried about with him last night, had returned.</p>
<p>The atmosphere of the pleasant breakfast-room to which in due course he
descended, was cheerful enough. Lady Ashleigh had already taken her place at
the head of the table before a glittering array of silver tea and coffee
equipage. The Professor, with a plate in his hand, was making an approving
survey of the contents of the dishes ranged upon the sideboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An English breakfast, my dear Quest,&rdquo; he remarked, after they
had exchanged the usual greetings, &ldquo;will, I am sure, appeal to you. I am
not, I confess, given to the pleasures of the table, but if anything could move
me to enthusiasm in dietary matters, the sight of your sideboard, my dear
sister-in-law, would do so. I commend the bacon and eggs to you, Quest, or if
you prefer sausages, those long, thin ones are home-made and delicious. Does
Mrs. Bland still cure our hams, Julia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her daughter does,&rdquo; Lady Ashleigh replied, smiling. &ldquo;We
are almost self-supporting here. All our daily produce, of course, comes from
the home farm. Tea or coffee, Mr. Quest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee, if you please,&rdquo; Quest decided, returning from his visit
to the sideboard. &ldquo;Is Lord Ashleigh a late riser?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not by any means,&rdquo; his wife declared. &ldquo;He very often gets
up and rides in the park before breakfast. I don&rsquo;t know where he is this
morning. He didn&rsquo;t even come in to see me. I think we must send
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She touched an electric bell under her foot and a moment or two later the
butler appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go up and see how long your master will be,&rdquo; Lady Ashleigh
directed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, your ladyship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man was backing through the doorway in his usual dignified manner when
he was suddenly pushed to one side. The valet who had waited upon Quest, and
who was Lord Ashleigh&rsquo;s own servant, rushed into the room. His face was
white. He had forgotten all decorum. He almost shouted to Lady Ashleigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ladyship&mdash;the master! Something has happened! He
won&rsquo;t move! He&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all rose to their feet. Quest groaned to himself. The black box!</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Lady Ashleigh faltered. &ldquo;What do you
mean, Williams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man shook his head. He seemed almost incapable of speech.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something has happened to the master!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a id="pic20" name="pic20"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="1202801h-images/TheBlackBox20.jpg" title=
"A footman interrupts in the dining room.">
<p class="caption">&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, come! My master has been
strangled to death.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>They all trooped out of the room and up the stairs, the Professor leading
the way. They pushed open the door of Lord Ashleigh&rsquo;s bedchamber. In the
far corner of the large room was the four-poster, and underneath the clothes a
silent figure. The Professor turned down the sheets. Then he held out his hand.
His face, too, was blanched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia, don&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must know!&rdquo; she almost shrieked. &ldquo;I must
know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George is dead,&rdquo; the Professor said slowly.</p>
<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s awful silence, broken by a piercing scream from
Lady Ashleigh. She sank down upon the sofa and the Professor leaned over her.
Quest turned to the little group of frightened servants who were gathering
round the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Telephone for a doctor,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;also to the local
police-station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He, too, approached the bed and reverently lifted the covering. Lord
Ashleigh was lying there, his body a little doubled up, his arms wide
outstretched. On his throat were two black marks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the valet&mdash;Williams?&rdquo; Quest asked, as he turned
away.</p>
<p>The man came forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell us at once what you know?&rdquo; Quest demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came in, as usual, to call his lordship before I called you,&rdquo;
the man replied. &ldquo;He did not answer, but I thought, perhaps, that he was
sleepy. I filled his bath, which, as you see, opens out of the room, and then
came to attend on you. When you went down to breakfast, I returned to his
lordship&rsquo;s room expecting to find him dressed. Instead of that the room
was silent, the bath still unused. I spoke to him&mdash;there was no answer.
Then I lifted the sheet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had led Lady Ashleigh from the room. The Professor and Quest stood face
to face. The former&rsquo;s expression, however, had lost all his amiable
serenity. His face was white and pinched. He looked shrivelled up. It was as
though some physical stroke had fallen upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quest! Quest!&rdquo; he almost sobbed. &ldquo;My
brother!&mdash;George, whom I loved like nobody else on earth! Is he really
dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor gripped the oak pillar of the bedstead. He seemed on the point
of collapse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The mark of the Hands is upon his throat,&rdquo; Quest pointed
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hands! Oh, my God!&rdquo; the Professor groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not eat or drink or sleep,&rdquo; Quest declared fiercely,
&ldquo;until we have brought this matter to an end. Craig must be found. This
is the supreme horror of all. Pull yourself together, Mr. Ashleigh. We shall
need every particle of intelligence we possess. I begin to think that we are
fighting against something superhuman.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a id="pic21" name="pic21"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>

<div align="center"><img src="1202801h-images/TheBlackBox21.jpg" title=
"A roomful of people are overcome with grief while a man gesticulates.">
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Lady Ashleigh, I will find, and bring to justice, the
criminal.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>The butler made an apologetic appearance. He spoke in a hushed whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wanted downstairs, gentlemen. Middleton, the head-keeper, is
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As though inspired with a common idea, both Quest and the Professor hurried
out of the room and down the broad stairs. Their inspiration was a true one.
The gamekeeper welcomed them with a smile of triumph. By his side, the picture
of abject misery, his clothes torn and muddy, was Craig!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve managed this little job, sir,&rdquo; Middleton announced,
with a smile of slow triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you get him?&rdquo; Quest demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little idea of my own,&rdquo; the gamekeeper continued. &ldquo;I
guessed pretty well what he&rsquo;d be up to. He&rsquo;d tumbled to it that the
usual way off the moor was pretty well guarded, and he&rsquo;d doubled back
through the thin line of woods close to the house. I dug one of my
poachers&rsquo; pits, sir, and covered it over with a lot of loose stuff. That
got him all right. When I went to look this morning I saw where he&rsquo;d
fallen through, and there he was, walking round and round at the bottom like a
caged animal. Your servants have telephoned for the police, Mr.
Ashleigh,&rdquo; he went on, turning to the Professor, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d
like you just to point out to the Scotland Yard gentleman&mdash;called us
yokels, he did, when he first came down&mdash;that we&rsquo;ve a few ideas of
our own down here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest suddenly whispered to the Professor. Then he turned to the keeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring him upstairs, Middleton, for a moment,&rdquo; he directed.
&ldquo;Follow us, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor gripped Quest&rsquo;s arm as they ascended the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; he asked hoarsely. &ldquo;What is it you wish to
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just an idea of my own,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;I
rather believe in that sort of thing. I want to confront him with the result of
his crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor stopped short. His eyes were half-closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is too horrible!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be too horrible for an inhuman being like this,&rdquo;
Quest answered tersely. &ldquo;I want to see whether he&rsquo;ll commit
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed into the bedchamber. Quest signed to the keeper to bring Craig
to the side of the four-poster. Then he drew down the sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that your work?&rdquo; he asked sternly.</p>
<p>Craig, up till then, had spoken no word. He had shambled to the bedside, a
broken, yet in a sense, a stolid figure. The sight of the dead man, however,
seemed to galvanise him into sudden and awful vitality. He threw up his arms.
His eyes were horrible as they glared at those small black marks. His lips
moved, helplessly at first. Then at last he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strangled!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;One more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is your work,&rdquo; the criminologist said firmly.</p>
<p>Craig collapsed. He would have fallen bodily to the ground if
Middleton&rsquo;s grip had not kept him up. Quest bent over him. It was clear
that he had fainted. They led him from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better lock him up until the police arrive,&rdquo; Quest
suggested. &ldquo;I suppose there is a safe place somewhere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor awoke from his stupor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me show you,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;I know the way. We&rsquo;ve
a subterranean hiding-place which no criminal on this earth could escape
from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They led him down to the back part of the house, a miserable, dejected
procession. Holding candles over their heads, they descended two sets of
winding stone steps, passed along a gloomy corridor till they came to a heavy
oak door, which Moreton, the butler, who carried the keys, opened with some
difficulty. It led into a dry cellar which had the appearance of a prison cell.
There was a single bench set against the wall. Quest looked around quickly.</p>
<p><a id="pic22" name="pic22"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>

<p class="caption">As the Professor explained the cellar&rsquo;s history to

</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;This place has been used before now, in the old days, for
malefactors,&rdquo; the Professor remarked. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be safe there.
Craig,&rdquo; he added, his voice trembling, &ldquo;Craig&mdash;I&mdash;I
can&rsquo;t speak to you. How could you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was no answer. Craig&rsquo;s face was buried in his hands. They left
him there and turned the key.</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">Quest stood, frowning, upon the pavement, gazing at the
obviously empty house. He looked once more at the slip of paper which Lenora
had given him. There was no possibility of any mistake:&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;Mrs. Willet,<br>
157 Elsmere Road,<br>
Hampstead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was 157 and the house was empty. After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation he
rang the bell at the adjoining door. A woman who had been watching him from the
front room, answered the summons at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me,&rdquo; he enquired, &ldquo;what has become of the
lady who used to live at 157&mdash;Mrs. Willet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s moved,&rdquo; was the uncompromising reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know where to?&rdquo; Quest asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;West Kensington&mdash;Number 17 Princes&rsquo; Court Road. There was
a young lady here yesterday afternoon enquiring for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest raised his hat. It was a relief, at any rate, to have news of
Lenora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome!&rdquo; was the terse reply.</p>
<p>Quest gave the new address to the taxi-driver and was scarcely able to
restrain his impatience during the long drive. They pulled up at last before a
somewhat dingy-looking house. He rang the bell, which was answered by a
trim-looking little maid-servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mrs. Willet in?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>The maid-servant stood on one side to let him pass. Almost at the same
moment, the door of the front room opened and a pleasant-looking elderly lady
appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mrs. Willet,&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Mr. Quest,&rdquo; the criminologist told her quickly. &ldquo;You
may have heard your niece, Lenora, speak of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps you can tell me what has become of her?&rdquo; Mrs.
Willet observed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Willet shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a telegram from her from New York to say that she was coming,
but I&rsquo;ve seen nothing of her as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve changed your address, you know,&rdquo; Quest reminded
her, after a moment&rsquo;s reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote and told her,&rdquo; Mrs. Willet began. &ldquo;After all,
though,&rdquo; she went on thoughtfully, &ldquo;I am not sure whether she could
have had the letter. But if she went up to Hampstead, any one would tell her
where I had moved to. There&rsquo;s no secret about me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora did go up to 157 Elsmere Road yesterday,&rdquo; Quest told
her. &ldquo;They gave her your address here, as they have just given it to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what&rsquo;s become of the child?&rdquo; Mrs. Willet
demanded.</p>
<p>Quest, whose brain was working quickly, scribbled upon one of his cards the
address of the hotel where he had taken rooms, and passed it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why Lenora didn&rsquo;t come on to you here I can&rsquo;t
imagine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;However, I&rsquo;ll go back to the hotel where
she was to spend the night after she arrived. She may have gone back there.
That&rsquo;s my address, Mrs. Willet. If you hear anything, I wish you&rsquo;d
let me know. Lenora&rsquo;s quite a particular friend of mine and I am a little
anxious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Willet smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let you know certainly, sir,&rdquo; she promised,
&ldquo;and glad I shall be to hear of Lenora&rsquo;s being comfortably settled,
after that first unfortunate affair of hers. You&rsquo;ll excuse me a moment.
I&rsquo;m a little slower in my wits than you. Did you say that Lenora was at
Hampstead yesterday afternoon and they told her my address?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; Quest admitted.</p>
<p>The woman&rsquo;s face grew troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; she said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I,&rdquo; Quest agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;London&rsquo;s no place, nowadays,&rdquo; Mrs. Willet continued,
&ldquo;for girls as pretty as Lenora to be wandering about in. Such tales as
there have been lately in the Sunday papers as makes one&rsquo;s blood run cold
if one can believe them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have any&mdash;what we call the White Slave
Traffic&mdash;over here, do you?&rdquo; Quest asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve ever come across any case of it
myself, sir,&rdquo; the old lady replied. &ldquo;I was housekeeper to the Duke
of Merioneth for fifty years, and where we lived we didn&rsquo;t hear much
about London and London ways. You see, I never came to the town house. But
since I retired and came up here, and took to reading the Sunday papers, I
begin to be thankful that my ways have been country ways all my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to alarm ourselves, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Quest intervened,
making his way towards the door. &ldquo;Lenora is a particularly capable young
lady. I feel sure she&rsquo;d look after herself. I am going right back to the
hotel, Mrs. Willet, and I&rsquo;ll let you know directly I hear
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very anxious, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she reminded him,
earnestly, &ldquo;very anxious indeed. Lenora was my sister&rsquo;s favourite
child, and my sister&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest had already opened the front door for himself and passed out. He
sprang into the taxi which he had kept waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clifford&rsquo;s Hotel in Payne Street,&rdquo; he told the man
sharply.</p>
<p>He lit a cigar and smoked furiously all the way, throwing it on to the
pavement as he hurried into the quiet private hotel which a fellow-passenger on
the steamer had recommended as being suitable for Lenora&rsquo;s one night
alone in town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me if Miss Lenora Macdougal is staying here?&rdquo; he
asked at the office.</p>
<p>The woman shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Macdougal stayed here the night before last,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and her luggage is waiting for orders. She left here yesterday afternoon
to go to her aunt&rsquo;s, and promised to send for her things later on during
the day. There they stand, all ready for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest followed the direction of the woman&rsquo;s finger. Lenora&rsquo;s
familiar little belongings were there, standing in a corner of the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t heard from her, then, since she went out yesterday
afternoon?&rdquo; he asked, with sinking heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did she go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Directly after an early lunch. It must have been about two
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest hurried away. So after all there was some foundation for this queer
sense of depression which had been hovering about him for the last few
days!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scotland Yard,&rdquo; he told the taxi-driver.</p>
<p>He thrust another cigar between his teeth but forgot to light it. He was
amazed at his own sensations, conscious of fears and emotions of which he would
never have believed himself capable. He gave in his card, and after a few
moments&rsquo; delay he was shown into the presence of one of the chiefs of the
Detective Department, who greeted him warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Hardaway,&rdquo; the latter announced. &ldquo;Glad to meet
you, Mr. Quest. We&rsquo;ve heard of you over here. Take a chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To tell you the truth,&rdquo; Quest replied, &ldquo;my business is a
little urgent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to hear you&rsquo;ve got that fellow Craig,&rdquo; Mr. Hardaway
continued. &ldquo;Ridiculous the way he managed to slip through our fingers. I
understand you&rsquo;ve got him all right now, though?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is safe enough,&rdquo; Quest declared, &ldquo;but to tell you the
truth, I&rsquo;m worried about another little affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; the other invited.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My assistant, a young lady, Miss Lenora Macdougal, has disappeared!
She and I and Professor Ashleigh left the steamer at Plymouth and travelled up
in the boat train. It was stopped at Hamblin Road for the Professor and myself,
and Miss Macdougal came on to London. She was staying at Clifford&rsquo;s Hotel
in Payne Street for the night, and then going on to an aunt. Well, I&rsquo;ve
found that aunt. She was expecting the girl but the girl never appeared. I have
been to the hotel where she spent the night before last, and I find that she
left there at two o&rsquo;clock and left word that she would send for her
luggage. She didn&rsquo;t arrive at her aunt&rsquo;s, and the luggage is still
uncalled for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector was at first only politely interested. It probably occurred to
him that young ladies have been known before now to disappear from their
guardians for a few hours without serious results.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did this aunt live?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number 17, Princes&rsquo; Court Road, West Kensington,&rdquo; Quest
replied. &ldquo;She had just moved there from Elsmere Road, Hampstead. I went
first to Hampstead. Lenora had been there and learnt her aunt&rsquo;s correct
address in West Kensington. I followed on to West Kensington and found that her
aunt was still awaiting her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A new interest seemed suddenly to have crept into Hardaway&rsquo;s
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if she left Clifford&rsquo;s Hotel
about two, she would have been at Hampstead about half-past two. She would
waste a few minutes in making enquiries, then she probably left Hampstead for
West Kensington, say, at a quarter to three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somewhere between those two points,&rdquo; Quest pointed out,
&ldquo;she has disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me at once a description of the young lady,&rdquo; Mr. Hardaway
demanded.</p>
<p>Quest drew a photograph from his pocket and passed it silently over. The
official glanced at it and down at some papers which lay before him. Then he
looked at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is just possible that your visit
here has been an exceedingly opportune one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snatched his hat from a rack and took Quest by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along with me,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll talk as
we go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered a taxi and drove off westwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;for two months we have been on
the track of a man and a woman whom we strongly suspect of having decoyed half
a dozen perfectly respectable young women, and shipped them out to South
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The White Slave Traffic!&rdquo; Quest gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something of the sort,&rdquo; Hardaway admitted. &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ve been closing the net around this interesting couple, and last night
I had information brought to me upon which we are acting this afternoon.
We&rsquo;ve had them watched and it seems that they were sitting in a tea place
about three o&rsquo;clock yesterday afternoon, when a young woman entered who
was obviously a stranger to London. You see, the time fits in exactly, if your
assistant decided to stop on her way to Kensington and get some tea. She asked
the woman at the desk the best means of getting to West Kensington without
taking a taxi-cab. Her description tallies exactly with the photograph you have
shown me. The woman whom my men were watching addressed her and offered to show
her the way. They left the place together. My men followed them. The house has
been watched ever since and we are raiding it this afternoon. You and I will
just be in time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve left her there since yesterday afternoon? You&rsquo;ve
left her there all night?&rdquo; Quest exclaimed. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardaway touched his arm soothingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
want the woman alone; we want the man, too. Now the man was away. He only
visits the house occasionally, and I am given to understand that he is a member
of several West End clubs. When the two women entered that house yesterday
afternoon, there wasn&rsquo;t a soul in it except servants. The woman
telephoned for the man. He never turned up last night nor this morning. He
arrived at that house twenty minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest drew a little breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It gave me a turn,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Say, this is a slow
taxi!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector glanced out of the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is the young lady you&rsquo;re looking for,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be in plenty of time, never fear. What I am hoping is that
we may be able to catch my fellows before they try to rush the place. You
understand, with your experience, Mr. Quest, that there are two things
we&rsquo;ve got to think of. We not only want to put our hand upon the guilty
persons, but we want to bring the crime home to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that,&rdquo; Quest assented. &ldquo;How much farther is this
place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re there,&rdquo; Hardaway told him.</p>
<p>He stopped the cab and they got out. A man who seemed to be strolling
aimlessly along, reading a newspaper, suddenly joined them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dixon?&rdquo; his chief exclaimed.</p>
<p>The man glanced around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got three men round at the back, Mr. Hardaway,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible for any one to leave the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything fresh to tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two men in the place besides the governor&mdash;butler and
footman, dressed in livery. They sleep out, and only come after
lunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardaway paused to consider for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Quest suggested, &ldquo;they know all you, of
course, and they&rsquo;ll never let you in until they&rsquo;re forced to.
I&rsquo;m a stranger. Let me go. I&rsquo;ll get in all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardaway peered around the corner of the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;We shall follow you up pretty
closely, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest stepped back into the taxi and gave the driver a direction. When he
emerged in front of the handsome grey stone house he seemed to have become
completely transformed. There was a fatuous smile upon his lips. He crossed the
pavement with difficulty, stumbled up the steps, and held on to the knocker
with one hand while he consulted a slip of paper. He had scarcely rung the bell
before a slightly parted curtain in the front room fell together, and a moment
later the door was opened by a man in the livery of a butler, but with the face
and physique of a prize-fighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady of the house,&rdquo; Quest demanded. &ldquo;Want to see the lady
of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost immediately he was conscious of a woman standing in the hall before
him. She was quietly but handsomely dressed; her hair was grey; her smile,
although a little peculiar, was benevolent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better come in,&rdquo; she invited. &ldquo;Please do not
stand in the doorway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest, however, who heard the footsteps of the others behind him, loitered
there for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the lady whose name is on this piece of paper?&rdquo; he
demanded. &ldquo;This place is all right, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really do not know what you mean,&rdquo; the woman replied coldly,
&ldquo;but if you will come inside, I will talk to you in the
drawing-room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest, as though stumbling against the front-door, had it now wide open, and
in a moment the hall seemed full. The woman shrieked. The butler suddenly
sprang upon the last man to enter, and sent him spinning down the steps. Almost
at that instant there was a scream from upstairs. Quest took a running jump and
went up the stairs four at a time. The butler suddenly snatched the revolver
from Hardaway&rsquo;s hand and fired blindly in front of him, missing Quest
only by an inch or two.</p>
<p><a id="pic23" name="pic23"><!--Image Anchor--></a></p>
<br>
<div align="center"><img src="1202801h-images/TheBlackBox23.jpg" title=
"A man lies on the floor, women are fluttering about, and Quest stands looking angry.">
<p class="caption">Quest fights his way to the girl he loves.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Karl!&rdquo; the woman called out. &ldquo;The
game&rsquo;s up. Take it quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the shriek rang through the house. Quest rushed to the door of the
room from whence it came, tried the handle and found it locked. He ran back a
little way and charged it. From inside he could hear a turmoil of voices. White
with rage and passion, he pushed and kicked madly. There was the sound of a
shot from inside, a bullet came through the door within an inch of his head,
then the crash of broken crockery and a man&rsquo;s groan. With a final effort
Quest dashed the door in and staggered into the room. Lenora was standing in
the far corner, the front of her dress torn and blood upon her lip. She held a
revolver in her hand and was covering a man whose head and hands were bleeding.
Around him were the debris of a broken jug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest!&rdquo; she screamed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go near
him&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got him covered. I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest drew a long breath. The man who stood glaring at him was well-dressed
and still young. He was unarmed, however, and Quest secured him in a
moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl&rsquo;s mad!&rdquo; he said sullenly. &ldquo;No one wanted
to do her any harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardaway and his men came trooping up the stairs. Quest relinquished his
prisoner and went over to Lenora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been so frightened,&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;They got me
in here&mdash;they told me that this was the street in which my aunt
lived&mdash;and they wouldn&rsquo;t let me go. The woman was horrible. And this
afternoon this man came. The brute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t hurt you?&rdquo; Quest demanded fiercely, as he
passed his arm around her.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would never have done that,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I had my
hatpin in my gown and I should have killed myself first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest turned to Hardaway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take the young lady away,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know
where to find us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardaway nodded and Quest supported Lenora down the stairs and into the
taxi-cab, which was still waiting. She leaned back and he passed his arm around
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you faint?&rdquo; he asked anxiously, as they drove towards the
hotel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little,&rdquo; she admitted, &ldquo;not very. But oh! I am so
thankful&mdash;so thankful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned a little nearer towards her. She looked at him wonderingly.
Suddenly the colour flushed into her cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have done without you, Lenora,&rdquo; he whispered,
as he kissed her.</p>
<p>Lenora had almost recovered when they reached the hotel. Walking up and down
they found the Professor. His face, as he came towards them, was almost
pitiful. He scarcely noticed Lenora&rsquo;s deshabille, which was in a measure
concealed by the cloak which Quest had thrown around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend!&rdquo; he exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Quest! It is the
devil incarnate against whom we fight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Quest demanded.</p>
<p>The Professor wrung his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put him in our James the Second prison,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;Why should I think of the secret passage? No one has used it for a
hundred years. He found it, learnt the trick&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; Quest cried&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has escaped!&rdquo; the Professor broke in. &ldquo;Craig has
escaped again! They are searching for him high and low, but he has
gone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest&rsquo;s arm tightened for a moment in Lenora&rsquo;s. It was curious
how he seemed to have lost at that moment all sense of proportion. Lenora was
safe&mdash;the relief of that one thought overshadowed everything else in the
world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellow can&rsquo;t get far,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who knows?&rdquo; the Professor replied dolefully. &ldquo;The
passage&mdash;I&rsquo;ll show it you some day and you&rsquo;ll see how
wonderful his escape has been&mdash;leads on to the first floor of the house.
He must have got into my dressing-room, for his old clothes are there and he
went away in a suit of mine. No one has seen him or knows anything about him.
All that the local police can find out is that a man answering somewhat his
description caught the morning train for Southampton from Hamblin
Roads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had been standing together in a little recess of the hall. Suddenly
Lenora, whose face was turned towards the entrance doors, gave a little cry.
She took a quick step forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura!&rdquo; she exclaimed, wonderingly. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s
Laura!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all turned around. A young woman had just entered the hotel, followed
by a porter carrying some luggage. Her arm was in a sling and there was a
bandage around her forehead. She walked, too, with the help of a stick. She
recognized them at once and waved it gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, you people?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Soon run you to earth,
eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were for a moment dumbfounded; Lenora was the first to find words.
&ldquo;But when did you start, Laura?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I thought you
were too ill to move for weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl smiled contemptuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left three days after you, on the <i>Kaiser Frederic</i>,&rdquo;
she replied. &ldquo;There was some trouble at Plymouth, and we came into
Southampton early this morning, and here I am. But, before we go any farther,
tell me about Craig?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had him,&rdquo; Quest confessed, &ldquo;and lost him
again. He escaped last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where from?&rdquo; Laura asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hamblin House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that anywhere near the south coast?&rdquo; the girl demanded
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not far away,&rdquo; Quest replied quickly.
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you why,&rdquo; Laura explained. &ldquo;I was as sure
of it as any one could be. Craig passed me in Southampton Water this morning,
being rowed out to a steamer. Not only that but he recognized me. I saw him
draw back and hide his face, but somehow I couldn&rsquo;t believe that it was
really he. I was just coming down the gangway and I nearly fell into the sea, I
was so surprised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest was already turning over the pages of a time-table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the steamer?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found out,&rdquo; Laura told him. &ldquo;I tell you, I was so sure
of it&rsquo;s being Craig that I made no end of enquiries. It was the
<i>Barton</i>, bound for India, with first stop at Port Said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When does she sail?&rdquo; Quest asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night&mdash;somewhere about seven,&rdquo; Laura replied.</p>
<p>Quest glanced at the clock and threw down the time-table. He turned towards
the door. They all followed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for Southampton,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
going to try to get on board that steamer before she sails. Lenora, you&rsquo;d
better go upstairs and lie down. They&rsquo;ll give you a room here.
Don&rsquo;t you stir out till I come back. Professor, what about
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall accompany you,&rdquo; the Professor declared. &ldquo;The
discomforts of travelling without luggage are nothing compared with the
importance of discovering this human fiend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luggage&mdash;pshaw!&rdquo; Laura exclaimed. &ldquo;Who cares about
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing,&rdquo; Lenora declared firmly, as she caught at
Quest&rsquo;s arm, &ldquo;would keep me away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll telephone to Scotland Yard, in case they care to send a
man down,&rdquo; Quest decided. &ldquo;We must remember, though,&rdquo; he
reminded them, &ldquo;that it will very likely be a wild-goose
chase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be the first,&rdquo; Laura observed grimly, &ldquo;but
Craig&rsquo;s on board that ship all right.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>They caught a train to Southampton, where they were joined by a man from
Scotland Yard. The little party drove as quickly as possible to the docks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does the <i>Barton</i> start from?&rdquo; Quest asked the
pier-master.</p>
<p>The man pointed a little way down the harbor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not in dock, sir,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
lying out yonder. You&rsquo;ll barely catch her, I&rsquo;m afraid,&rdquo; he
added, glancing at the clock.</p>
<p>They hurried to the edge of the quay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; Quest cried, raising his voice, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
give a ten pound note to any one who gets me out to the <i>Barton</i> before
she sails.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little party were almost thrown into a tug, and in a few minutes they
were skimming across the smooth water. Just as they reached the steamer,
however, she began to move.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run up alongside,&rdquo; Quest ordered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t stop, sir,&rdquo; the Captain of the tug replied
doubtfully. &ldquo;She is an hour late, as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do as I tell you,&rdquo; Quest insisted.</p>
<p>They raced along by the side of the great steamer. An officer came to the
rail and shouted down to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Captain,&rdquo; Quest replied.</p>
<p>The Captain came down from the bridge, where he had been conferring with the
pilot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep away from the side there,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Who are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in search of a desperate criminal whom we believe to be on
board your steamer,&rdquo; Quest explained. &ldquo;Please take us on
board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you from Scotland Yard?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Have you got your
warrant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are from America,&rdquo; Quest answered, &ldquo;but we&rsquo;ve
got a Scotland Yard man with us, and a warrant, right enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any extradition papers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No time to get them yet,&rdquo; Quest replied, &ldquo;but the
man&rsquo;s wanted for murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you from the New York police?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a private detective,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I am working in
conjunction with the New York Police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am over an hour late,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s costing
me fifty pounds a minute. If I take you on board, you&rsquo;ll have to come
right along with me, unless you find the fellow before we&rsquo;ve left your
tug behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you risk it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; they all replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re coming, Captain,&rdquo; Quest decided.</p>
<p>A rope ladder was let down. The steamer began to slow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you girls manage it?&rdquo; Quest asked doubtfully.</p>
<p>Laura smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say so,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;I can go up that with
only one arm. You watch me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They cheered her on board the steamer as she hobbled up. The others
followed. The tug, the crew of which had been already well paid, raced along by
the side. The Captain spoke once more to the pilot and came down from the
bridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m forced to go full speed ahead to cross the bar,&rdquo; he
told Quest. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, but the tide&rsquo;s just on the
turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at one another a little blankly.</p>
<p>The Professor, however, beamed upon them all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always understood,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Port Said is a
most interesting place.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="ch11" id="ch11"></a>XI.&mdash;THE SHIP OF HORROR</h2>
<p class="first">Quest leaned a little forward and gazed down the line of
steamer chairs. The Professor, in a borrowed overcoat and cap, was reclining at
full length, studying a book on seagulls which he had found in the library.
Laura and Lenora were both dozing tranquilly. Mr. Harris of Scotland Yard was
deep in a volume of detective stories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a pleasure cruise,&rdquo; Quest remarked grimly, &ldquo;this
little excursion seems to be a complete success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura opened her eyes at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying to get my goat again, eh?&rdquo; she retorted. &ldquo;I
suppose that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re after. Going to tell me, I suppose, that
it wasn&rsquo;t Craig I saw board this steamer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are all liable to make mistakes,&rdquo; Quest observed, &ldquo;and
I am inclined to believe that this is one of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura&rsquo;s expression was a little dogged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s too clever for you and Mr. Harris,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that. I only know that he came on board. My eyes are
the one thing in life I do believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll excuse my saying so, Miss Laura,&rdquo; Harris
ventured, leaning deferentially towards her, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t a
passenger on board this ship, or a servant, or one of the crew, whom we
haven&rsquo;t seen. We&rsquo;ve been into every stateroom, and we&rsquo;ve even
searched the hold. We&rsquo;ve been over the ship, backwards and forwards. The
Captain&rsquo;s own steward has been our guide, and we&rsquo;ve conducted an
extra search on our own account. Personally, I must say I have come to the same
conclusion as Mr. Quest. At the present moment there is no such person as the
man we are looking for, on board this steamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he either changed on to another one,&rdquo; Laura declared
obstinately, &ldquo;or else he jumped overboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris, who was a very polite man, gazed thoughtfully seaward. Quest
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Laura&rsquo;s set on a thing,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;she
takes a little moving. What do you think about it, Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor laid down his book, keeping his finger in the place. He had
the air of a man perfectly content with himself and his surroundings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I boarded this steamer with only
one thought in my mind&mdash;Craig. At the present moment, I feel myself
compelled to plead guilty to a complete change of outlook. The horrors of the
last few months seem to have passed from my brain like a dream. I lie here, I
watch these white-winged birds wheeling around us, I watch the sunshine make
jewels of the spray, I breathe this wonderful air, I relax my body to the slow,
soothing movements of the boat, and I feel a new life stealing through me. Is
Craig really on board? Was it really he whom Miss Laura here saw? At the
present moment, I really do not care. I learn from the steward, who arranged my
bath this morning, that we are bound for India. I am very glad to hear it. It
is some time since I saw Bombay, and the thought of these long days of complete
peace fills me with a most indescribable satisfaction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest grunted a little as he knocked the ash from his cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much of the bloodhound about the Professor,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;What about you, Lenora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree entirely with the Professor,&rdquo; she murmured,
&ldquo;except that I am not quite so sure that I appreciate the rhythmical
movement of the boat as he seems to. For the rest, I have just that feeling
that I would like to go on and on and forget all the horrible things that have
happened, to live in a sort of dream, and wake up in a world from which Craig
had vanished altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enervating effect this voyage seems to be having upon you all,&rdquo;
Quest grumbled. &ldquo;Even Harris there looks far too well contented with
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective smiled. He was young and fresh-coloured, with a shrewd but
pleasant face. He glanced involuntarily at Laura as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t bring you on
the steamer so I don&rsquo;t feel any responsibility about it, but I must
confess that I am enjoying the trip. I haven&rsquo;t had a holiday this
year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest struggled to his feet and threw back the rug in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you all persist in turning this into a pleasure cruise,&rdquo; he
remarked, &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to alter my own point of view. Come
on, Harris, you and I promised to report to the Captain this morning. I
don&rsquo;t suppose he&rsquo;ll be any too pleased with us. Let&rsquo;s get
through with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men walked down the deck together. They found the Captain alone in
his room, with a chart spread out in front of him and a pair of compasses in
his hand. He turned round and greeted them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No luck, sir,&rdquo; Quest announced. &ldquo;Your steward has given
us every assistance possible and we have searched the ship thoroughly. Unless
he has found a hiding place unknown to your steward, and not apparent to us,
the man is not on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain frowned slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not suggesting that that is possible, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest did not at once reply. He was thinking of Laura&rsquo;s obstinacy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; he admitted, &ldquo;I should not have believed it
possible. The young lady of our party, however, who declares that she saw Craig
board the steamer, is quite immovable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain rose to his feet. He was a man of medium height, strongly built,
with short brown beard and keen blue eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This matter must be cleared up entirely,&rdquo; he declared
brusquely. &ldquo;If you will excuse me for a moment, I will talk to the young
lady myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked firmly down the deck to where the two girls were seated, and
paused in front of Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the young lady,&rdquo; he remarked, touching his cap,
&ldquo;who thinks that I come to sea with criminals stowed away on my
ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what your habits are, Captain,&rdquo; Laura
replied, &ldquo;but this particular criminal boarded your ship all right in
Southampton Harbour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything wrong with your eyesight?&rdquo; the Captain enquired
blandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Laura assured him. &ldquo;I saw the man, saw him just as
plainly as I see you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; the Captain persisted, &ldquo;that Mr. Quest and
Mr. Harris have searched every nook and corner of the ship? They have had an
absolutely free hand, and my own steward has been their guide. They have seen
every man, boy, woman and animal amongst my crew or passengers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been fooled somehow,&rdquo; Laura muttered.</p>
<p>The Captain frowned. He was on the point of a sharp rejoinder when he met
Laura&rsquo;s eyes. She was smiling very faintly and there was something in her
expression which changed his whole point of view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and make a few enquiries myself,&rdquo; he declared.
&ldquo;See you at dinner-time, I hope, young ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you keep her as steady as this,&rdquo; Laura promised,
&ldquo;there are hopes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared along the deck, and presently re-entered his room, where
Harris and Quest were waiting for him. He was followed by his steward, an
under-sized man with pallid complexion and nervous manner. He closed the door
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brown,&rdquo; he said, turning to the steward, &ldquo;I understand
you to say that you have taken these gentlemen into every corner of the ship,
that you have ransacked every possible hiding-place, that you have given them
every possible opportunity of searching for themselves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is quite true, sir,&rdquo; the man acknowledged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You agree with me that it is impossible for any one to remain hidden
in this ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear, gentlemen?&rdquo; the Captain continued. &ldquo;I really
can do no more. It is perfectly clear to me that the man you are seeking is not
on my ship. Your very charming young lady friend seems to think it impossible
that she could have been mistaken, but as a matter of fact she was. If I might
take the liberty, Mr. Quest, I would suggest that you ask her, at any rate, to
keep her suspicions to herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see she doesn&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; Quest promised.
&ldquo;Very sorry to have given you all this trouble, I&rsquo;m
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no trouble,&rdquo; the Captain replied, &ldquo;and apart
from the disagreeable nature of your business, I am delighted to have you on
board. If you can forget your suspicions about this fellow Craig, I shall do my
best to make your trip a pleasant one as far as Port Said, or on to India if
you decide to take the trip with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good of you, Captain, I&rsquo;m sure,&rdquo; Quest pronounced.
&ldquo;We shall go on keeping our eyes open, of course, but apart from that
we&rsquo;ll forget the fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am coming down to dinner to-night,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;and
shall hope to find you in your places. What the mischief are you hanging about
for, Brown?&rdquo; he asked, turning to the steward, who was standing by with a
carpet-sweeper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room wants cleaning out badly, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain glanced distastefully at the carpet-sweeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it when I am at dinner, then,&rdquo; he ordered, &ldquo;and take
that damned thing away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward obeyed promptly. Quest and Harris followed him down the
deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer-looking fellow, that,&rdquo; the latter remarked.
&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t seem quite at his ease, does he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seemed a trifle over-anxious, I thought, when he was showing us round
the ship,&rdquo; Quest agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;M-m,&rdquo; Harris murmured softly, &ldquo;as the gentleman who wrote
the volume of detective stories I am reading puts it, we&rsquo;d better keep
our eye on Brown.&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>The Captain, who was down to dinner unusually early, rose to welcome
Quest&rsquo;s little party and himself arranged the seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Miss Lenora,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will please sit on my left,
and you, Miss Laura, on my right. Mr. Quest, will you sit on the other side of
Miss Laura, and Mr. Harris two places down on my left. There is an old lady who
expects to be at the table, but the steward tells me she hasn&rsquo;t been in
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They settled down into the places arranged for them. Harris was looking a
little glum. Lenora and Quest exchanged a meaning glance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that I appreciate this arrangement,&rdquo; Harris
whispered to his neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be candid,&rdquo; Lenora replied, &ldquo;but you aren&rsquo;t
very polite, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harris almost blushed as he realized his slip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but to tell you the truth,&rdquo;
he added, glancing towards Quest, &ldquo;I fancied that you were feeling about
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We women are poor dissemblers,&rdquo; Lenora murmured. &ldquo;Do look
how angry this old woman seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An elderly lady, dressed in somewhat oppressive black, with a big cameo
brooch at her throat and a black satin bag in her hand, was being shown by the
steward to a seat by Quest&rsquo;s side. She acknowledged the Captain&rsquo;s
greeting acidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Captain,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I understood from the
second steward that the seat on your right hand would be reserved for me. I am
Mrs. Foston Rowe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain received the announcement calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very pleased to have you at the table, madam,&rdquo; he replied.
&ldquo;As to the seating, I leave that entirely to the steward. I never
interfere myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura pinched his arm, and Lenora glanced away to hide a smile. Mrs. Foston
Rowe studied the menu disapprovingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hors d&rsquo;oeuvres,&rdquo; she declared, &ldquo;I never touch. No
one knows how long they&rsquo;ve been opened. Bouillon&mdash;I will have some
bouillon, steward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In one moment, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor just then came ambling along towards the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear that I am a few moments late,&rdquo; he remarked, as he took
the chair next to Mrs. Foston Rowe. &ldquo;I offer you my apologies, Captain. I
congratulate you upon your library. I have discovered a most interesting book
upon the habits of seagulls. It kept me engrossed until the very last
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very disagreeable habits, those I&rsquo;ve noticed,&rdquo; Mrs.
Foston Rowe sniffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; the Professor assured her, &ldquo;yours is but a
superficial view. For myself, I must confess that the days upon which I learn
something new in life are days of happiness for me. To-day is an example; I
have learnt something new about seagulls, and I am hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;ll have to stay hungry a long time at this table,
then,&rdquo; Mrs. Foston Rowe snapped. &ldquo;Seems to me that the service is
going to be abominable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward, who had just arrived, presented a cup of bouillon to Quest. The
others had all been served. Quest stirred it thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as to the custom,&rdquo; Mrs. Foston Rowe continued, &ldquo;of
serving gentlemen before ladies, it is, I suppose, peculiar to this
steamer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest hastily laid down his spoon, raised the cup of bouillon and presented
it with a little bow to his neighbour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray allow me, madam,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;The steward was to
blame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Foston Rowe did not hesitate for a moment. She broke up some toast in
the bouillon and commenced to sip it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your politeness will at least teach them a lesson,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;I am used to travel by the P. &amp; O. and from what I have seen of this
steamer&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The spoon suddenly went clattering from her fingers. She caught at the sides
of the table, there was a strange look in her face. With scarcely a murmur she
fell back in her seat. Quest leaned hurriedly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Steward! Mrs. Foston Rowe is
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight commotion. The Doctor came hurrying up from the other
side of the salon. He bent over her and his face grew grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; the Captain demanded.</p>
<p>The Doctor glanced at him meaningly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had better be carried out,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>It was all done in a moment. There was nothing but Mrs. Foston Rowe&rsquo;s
empty place at the table and the cup of bouillon, to remind them of what had
happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a faint?&rdquo; Lenora asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall know directly,&rdquo; the Captain replied. &ldquo;Better
keep our places, I think. Steward, serve the dinner as usual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man held out his hand to withdraw the cup of bouillon, but Quest drew it
towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it wait for a moment,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>He glanced at the Captain, who nodded back. In a few moments the Doctor
reappeared. He leaned down and whispered to the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain gave no sign.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better call it heart failure,&rdquo; the Doctor continued.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll let the people know quietly. I don&rsquo;t in the least
understand the symptoms, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest turned around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I happen to have my chemical chest
with me, and some special testing tubes. If you&rsquo;ll allow me, I&rsquo;d
like to examine this cup of bouillon. You might come round, too, if you
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better stay here for a time,&rdquo; he decided.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow you presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The service of dinner was resumed. Laura, however, sent plate after plate
away. The Captain watched her anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know whether you&rsquo;ve had any talk with Mr. Quest, but we&rsquo;ve been
through some queer times lately. I guess this death business is getting on my
nerves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain was startled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t for a moment connect Mrs. Foston Rowe&rsquo;s death
with the criminal you are in search of?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Laura sat quite still for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bouillon was offered first to Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>The Captain called his steward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get the bouillon you served&mdash;that last cup
especially?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the pantry just as usual, sir,&rdquo; the man answered.
&ldquo;It was all served out from the same cauldron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any chance of any one getting at it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite impossible, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura rose to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; she apologized, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat anything.
I&rsquo;m off on deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain rose promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll escort you, if I may,&rdquo; he suggested.</p>
<p>Harris, too, rose from his place, after a final and regretful glance at the
menu, and joined the others. The Captain, however, drew Laura&rsquo;s arm
through his as they reached the stairs, and Harris, with a little shrug of the
shoulders, made his way to Quest&rsquo;s stateroom. The Doctor, the Professor,
Quest and Lenora were all gathered around two little tubes, which the
criminologist was examining with an electric torch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No reaction at all,&rdquo; the latter muttered. &ldquo;This
isn&rsquo;t an ordinary poison, any way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor, who had been standing on one side, suddenly gave vent to a
soft exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Wait! I have an idea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried off to his stateroom. The Doctor was poring over a volume of
tabulated poisons. Quest was still watching his tubes. Lenora sat upon the
couch. Suddenly the Professor reappeared. He was carrying a small notebook in
his hand; his manner betrayed some excitement. He closed the door carefully
behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you all,&rdquo; he begged, &ldquo;to listen very carefully to
me. You will discover the application of what I am going to read, when I am
finished. Now, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They looked at him wonderingly. It was evident that the Professor was very
much in earnest. He held the book a little way away from him and read slowly
and distinctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;is the diary of a tour made by Craig
and myself in Northern Egypt some fourteen years ago. Here is the first entry
of import:&mdash;</p>
<p class="journal">&ldquo;<b>Monday</b>. Twenty-nine miles south-east of Port
Said. We have stayed for two days at a little Mongar village. I have to-day
come to the definite conclusion that anthropoid apes were at one time denizens
of this country.</p>
<p class="journal">&ldquo;<b>Tuesday</b>. Both Craig and I have been a little
uneasy to-day. These Mongars into whose encampment we have found our way, are
one of the strangest and fiercest of the nomad tribes. They are descended,
without a doubt, from the ancient Mongolians, who invaded this country some
seven hundred years before Christ. They have interbred with the Arabs to some
extent, but have preserved in a marvellous way their individuality as a race.
They have the narrow eyes and the thick nose base of the pure Oriental; also
much of his cunning. One of their special weaknesses seems to be the invention
of the most hideous forms of torture, which they apply remorselessly to their
enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasant sort of people,&rdquo; Quest muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We escaped with our lives,&rdquo; the Professor explained earnestly,
&ldquo;from these people, only on account of an incident which you will find in
this next paragraph:&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="journal">&ldquo;<b>Wednesday</b>. This has been a wonderful day for
as, chiefly owing to what I must place on record as an act of great bravery by
Craig, my servant. Early this morning, a man-eating lion found his way into the
encampment. The Mongars behaved like arrant cowards. They fled right and left,
leaving the Chief&rsquo;s little daughter, Feerda, at the brute&rsquo;s mercy.
Craig, who is by no means an adept in the use of firearms, chased the animal as
he was making off with the child, and, more by good luck than anything else,
managed to wound it mortally. He brought the child back to the encampment just
as the Chief and the warriors of the tribe returned from a hunting expedition.
Our position here is now absolutely secure. We are treated like gods, and,
appreciating my weakness for all matters of science, the Chief has to-day
explained to me many of the secret mysteries of the tribe. Amongst other
things, he has shown me a wonderful secret poison, known only to this tribe,
which they call Veedemzoo. It brings almost instant death, and is exceedingly
difficult to trace. The addition of sugar causes a curious condensation and
resolves it almost to a white paste. The only antidote is a substance which
they use here freely, and which is exactly equivalent to our
camphor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor closed his book. Quest promptly rang the bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some sugar,&rdquo; he ordered, turning to the steward.</p>
<p>They waited in absolute silence. The suggestion which the Professor&rsquo;s
disclosure had brought to them was stupefying, even Quest&rsquo;s fingers, as a
moment or two later he rubbed two knobs of sugar together so that the particles
should fall into the tubes of bouillon, shook. The result was magical. The
bouillon turned to a strange shade of grey and began slowly to thicken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Mongar poison!&rdquo; the Professor cried, with breaking
voice.</p>
<p>They all looked at one another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig must be here amongst us,&rdquo; Quest muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the bouillon,&rdquo; Lenora cried, clasping Quest&rsquo;s arm,
&ldquo;the bouillon was meant for you!&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>There seemed to be, somehow, amongst all of them, a curious indisposition to
discuss this matter. Suddenly Lenora, who was sitting on the lounge underneath
the porthole, put out her hand and picked up a card which was lying by her
side. She glanced at it, at first curiously. Then she shrieked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A message!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;A message from the Hands!
Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They crowded around her. In that same familiar handwriting was scrawled
across the face of the card these few words&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;To Sanford Quest.</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;You have escaped this time by a chance of fortune, not
because your wits are keen, not because of your own shrewdness; simply because
Fate willed it. It will not be for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Underneath was the drawing of the clenched hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no longer any doubt,&rdquo; Lenora said calmly. &ldquo;Craig
is on board. He must have been on deck a few minutes ago. It was his hand which
placed this card in the porthole&hellip;. Listen! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a scream from the deck. They all recognised Laura&rsquo;s voice.
Harris was out of the stateroom first but they were all on deck within ten
seconds. Laura was standing with one hand clasping the rail, her hand fiercely
outstretched towards the lower part of the promenade deck. Through the darkness
they heard the sound of angry voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Laura?&rdquo; Lenora cried.</p>
<p>She swung round upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Craig! I saw his face as I sat in my
chair there, talking to the Captain. I saw a man&rsquo;s white
face&mdash;nothing else. He must have been leaning over the rail. He heard me
call out and he disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain came slowly out of the shadows, limping a little and followed by
his steward, who was murmuring profuse apologies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you find him?&rdquo; Laura demanded eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not,&rdquo; the Captain replied, a little tersely. &ldquo;I ran
into Brown here and we both had a shake-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he was there&mdash;a second ago!&rdquo; Laura cried out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, miss,&rdquo; Brown ventured, &ldquo;but the
deck&rsquo;s closed at the end, as you can see, with sail-cloth, and I was
leaning over the rail myself when you shrieked. There wasn&rsquo;t any one else
near me, and no one can possibly have passed round the deck, as you can see
plainly for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura stood quite still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doors are there on the side?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doors of my room only,&rdquo; the Captain replied, a little
shortly. &ldquo;It was Brown you saw, of course. He was standing exactly where
you thought you saw Craig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura walked to the end of the deck and back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you people had better get a
strait-waistcoat ready for me. If I didn&rsquo;t see Craig there, I&rsquo;m
going off my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest had disappeared some seconds ago. He came thoughtfully back, a little
later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;what shall you say if I tell you
that I have proof that Craig is on board?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain glanced at Laura and restrained himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should probably say a great many things which I should regret
afterwards,&rdquo; he replied grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down and we&rsquo;ll tell you what has happened in my
room,&rdquo; Quest continued.</p>
<p>He told the story, calmly and without remark. The Captain held his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;m convinced that I am a sane man,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but this sounds more like a Munchausen story than anything I&rsquo;ve
ever heard. I suppose you people are all real? You are in earnest about this,
aren&rsquo;t you? It isn&rsquo;t a gigantic joke?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are in deadly earnest,&rdquo; the Professor pronounced
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been down to the pantry,&rdquo; Quest went on. &ldquo;The
porthole has been open all day. It was just possible for a man to have reached
the cups of bouillon as they were prepared. That isn&rsquo;t the point,
however. Craig is cunning and clever enough for any devilish scheme on earth,
and that card proves that he is on board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship shall be searched,&rdquo; the Captain declared, &ldquo;once
more. We&rsquo;ll look into every crack and every cupboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora turned away with a little shiver. It was one of her rare moments of
weakness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t find him! You won&rsquo;t ever find him!&rdquo; she
murmured. &ldquo;And I am afraid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora grasped the rails of the steamer and glanced downwards at the great
barge full of Arab sailors and merchandise. In the near background were the
docks of Port Said. It was their first glimpse of Eastern atmosphere and
colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how happy I am,&rdquo; she declared to Quest,
&ldquo;to think that this voyage is over. Every night I have gone to bed
terrified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things have been quiet enough the last few days,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Harris on this barge. Look at Laura waving to
him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Scotland Yard man only glanced up at them. He was occupied in leaning
over towards Laura, who was on the deck below.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you said the word,&rdquo; he called out, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
be going back, Miss Laura. I&rsquo;d stick to the ship fast enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed at him gaily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not you! You&rsquo;re longing for your smoky old London already. You
cut it out, my friend. You&rsquo;re a good sort, and I hope we&rsquo;ll meet
again some day. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shook her head at him good-humouredly. He turned away, disappointed, and
waved his hand to Lenora and Quest on the upper deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming on shore, any of you?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may when the boat moves up,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;The
Professor went off on the first barge. Here he is, coming back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little boat had shot out from the docks, manned by a couple of Arabs. They
could see the Professor seated in the stern. He was poring over a small
document which he held in his hand. He waved to them excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got news!&rdquo; Quest muttered.</p>
<p>With much shouting the boat was brought to the side of the barge. The
Professor was hauled up. He stumbled blindly across towards the gangway and
came up the steps with amazing speed. He came straight to Quest and Lenora and
gripped the former by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out a card. Quest read it aloud:&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;There is not one amongst you with the wit of a Mongar
child. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;The Hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo; Quest demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point&mdash;the whole point!&rdquo; the Professor
exclaimed excitedly. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done us! He&rsquo;s landed! That paper
was pushed into my hand by a tall Arab, who mumbled something and hurried off
across the docks. On the landing-stage, mind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain came and put his head out of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can you spare me a moment? You can
all come, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved up towards him. The Captain closed the door of his cabin. He
pointed to a carpet-sweeper which lay against the wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at that,&rdquo; he invited.</p>
<p>They lifted the top. Inside were several sandwiches and a small can of
tea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is this?&rdquo; Quest demanded.</p>
<p>The Captain, without a word, led them into his inner room. A huge lounge
stood in one corner. He lifted the valance. Underneath were some crumbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he pointed out, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s room there for a
man to have hidden, especially if he could crawl out on deck at night. I
couldn&rsquo;t make out why the dickens Brown was always sweeping out my room,
and I took up this thing a little time ago and looked at it. This is what I
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Brown?&rdquo; Quest asked quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rang down for the chief steward,&rdquo; the Captain continued,
&ldquo;and ordered Brown to be sent up at once. The chief steward came himself
instead. It seems Brown went off without his wages but with a huge parcel of
bedding, on the first barge this morning, before any one was about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest groaned as he turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I am ashamed. He has been here
all the time and we&rsquo;ve let him slip through our fingers. Girls,&rdquo; he
went on briskly, turning towards Laura, who had just come up,
&ldquo;India&rsquo;s off. We&rsquo;ll catch this barge, if there&rsquo;s time.
Our luggage can be put on shore when the boat docks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain walked gloomily with them to the gangway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall miss you all,&rdquo; he told Laura.</p>
<p>She laughed in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ask me, I think you&rsquo;ll be glad to be rid of
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not of you, Miss Laura,&rdquo; he insisted.</p>
<p>She made a little grimace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as bad as Mr. Harris,&rdquo; she declared.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll come for another trip with you some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left him leaning disconsolately over the rails. The Professor and Quest
sat side by side on one of the trunks which was piled up on the barge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; Quest asked, &ldquo;how long would it take us to
get to this Mongar village you spoke about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two or three days, if we can get camels,&rdquo; the other replied.
&ldquo;I see you agree with me, then, as to Craig&rsquo;s probable
destination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of fellows are they, any way?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Will
it be safe for us to push on alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With me,&rdquo; the Professor assured him, &ldquo;you will be safe
anywhere. I speak a little of their language. I have lived with them. They are
far more civilized than some of the interior tribes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll find a comfortable hotel where we can leave the
girls&mdash;&rdquo; Quest began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can cut that out,&rdquo; Laura interrupted. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
know about the kid here, but if you think I&rsquo;m going to miss a camel ride
across the desert, you&rsquo;re dead wrong, so that&rsquo;s all there is to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest glanced towards Lenora. She leaned over and took his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I simply couldn&rsquo;t be left behind,&rdquo; she pleaded.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had quite enough of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The journey will not be an unpleasant one,&rdquo; the Professor
declared amiably, &ldquo;and the riding of a camel is an accomplishment easily
acquired. So far as I am aware, too, the district which we shall have to
traverse is entirely peaceable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They disembarked and were driven to the hotel, still discussing their
project. Afterwards they all wandered into the bazaars, along the narrow
streets, where dusky children pulled at their clothes and ran by their side,
where every now and then a brown-skinned Arab, on a slow-moving camel, made his
way through the throngs of veiled Turkish women, Syrians, Arabs, and Egyptians.
Laura and Lenora, at any rate, attracted by the curious novelty of the scene,
forgot the heat, the street smells, and the filthy clothes of the mendicants
and loafers who pressed against them. They bought strange jewellery, shawls,
beads and perfumes. The Professor had disappeared for some time but rejoined
them later.</p>

"The travellers gawk at a scantily veiled woman in a Middle-eastern marketplace.">
<p class="caption">&ldquo;While we are waiting, let&rsquo;s go in and be
shocked!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;It is all arranged,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I found a dragoman
whom I know. We shall have four of the best camels and a small escort ready to
start to-morrow morning. Furthermore, I have news. An Englishman whose
description precisely tallies with Craig&rsquo;s, started off, only an hour
ago, in the same direction. This time, at any rate, Craig cannot escape
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might go on past the Mongar camp,&rdquo; Quest suggested.</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mongar village,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;is placed practically
at a cul-de-sac so far as regards further progress southwards without making a
detour. It is flanked by a strip of jungle and desert on either side, in which
there are no wells for many miles. We shall find Craig with the
Mongars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way back to the hotel, dined in a cool, bare room, and
sauntered out again into the streets. The Professor led the way to a little
building, outside which a man was volubly inviting all to enter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall see one of the sights of Port Said,&rdquo; he promised.
&ldquo;This is a real Egyptian dancing girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took their seats in the front row of a dimly-lit, bare-looking room.
The stage was dark and empty. From some unseen place came the monotonous rhythm
of a single instrument. They waited for some time in vain. At last one or two
lights in front were lit, the music grew more insistent. A girl who seemed to
be dressed in little more than a winding veil, glided on to the stage, swaying
and moving slowly to the rhythm of the monotonous music. She danced a measure
which none of them except the Professor had ever seen before, coming now and
then so close that they could almost feel her hot breath, and Lenora felt
somehow vaguely disturbed by the glitter of her eyes. An odd perfume was shaken
into the air around them from her one flowing garment, through which her limbs
continually flashed. Lenora looked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rdquo; she said to Quest simply.</p>
<p>Suddenly Laura leaned forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at the Professor,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>They all turned their heads. A queer change seemed to have come into the
Professor&rsquo;s face. His teeth were gleaming between his parted lips, his
head was a little thrust forward, his eyes were filled with a strange, hard
light. He was a transformed being, unrecognisable, perturbing. Even while they
watched, the girl floated close to where he sat and leaned towards him with a
queer, mocking smile. His hand suddenly descended upon her foot. She laughed
still more. There was a little exclamation from Lenora. The Professor&rsquo;s
whole frame quivered, he snatched the anklet from the girl&rsquo;s ankle and
bent over it. She leaned towards him, a torrent of words streaming from her
lips. The Professor answered her in her own language. She listened to him in
amazement. The anger passed. She held out both her hands. The Professor still
argued. She shook her head. Finally he placed some gold in her palms. She
patted him on the cheek, laughed into his eyes, pointed behind and resumed her
dancing. The anklet remained in the Professor&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;ll get out of this,&rdquo; Quest said. &ldquo;The girls
have had enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor made no objection. He led the way, holding the anklet all the
time close to his eyes, and turning it round. They none of them spoke to him,
yet they were all conscious of an immense sense of relief when, after they had
passed into the street, he commenced to talk in his natural voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Congratulate me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have been a collector of
Assyrian gold ornaments all my life. This is the one anklet I needed to
complete my collection. It has the double mark of the Pharaohs. I recognised it
at once. There are a thousand like it, you would think, in the bazaars there.
In reality there may be, perhaps, a dozen more in all Egypt which are
genuine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all looked at one another. Their relief had grown too poignant for
words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early start to-morrow,&rdquo; Quest reminded them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home and bed for me, this moment,&rdquo; Laura declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camels,&rdquo; the Professor assented, &ldquo;will be round at
daybreak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora, a few nights later, looked down from the star-strewn sky which
seemed suddenly to have dropped so much nearer to them, to the shadows thrown
across the desert by the dancing flames of their fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the same world, I suppose,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A queer little place out of the same world,&rdquo; Quest agreed.
&ldquo;Listen to those fellows, how they chatter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The camel drivers and guides were sitting together in a little group, some
distance away. They had finished their supper and were chattering together now,
swaying back and forth, two of them at least in a state of wild excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever can they be talking about?&rdquo; Laura asked. &ldquo;They
sound as though they were going to fight every second.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last one was talking about the beauty of his fat lady
friend,&rdquo; he remarked drily. &ldquo;Just before, they were discussing
whether they would be given any backsheesh in addition to their pay. We are
quite off the ordinary routes here, and these fellows aren&rsquo;t much used to
Europeans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura rose to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get a drink,&rdquo; she announced.</p>
<p>The dragoman, who had been hovering around, bowed gravely and pointed
towards the waterbottles. Lenora also rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming too,&rdquo; she decided. &ldquo;It seems a sin to
think of going to sleep, though. The whole place is like a great silent sea. I
suppose this isn&rsquo;t a dream, is it, Laura?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no dream about my thirst, any way,&rdquo; Laura
declared.</p>
<p>She took the horn cup from the dragoman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have some yourself, if you want to, Hassan,&rdquo; she invited.</p>
<p>Hassan bowed gravely, filled a cup and drank it off. He stood for a moment
perfectly still, as though something were coming over him which he failed to
understand. Then his lips parted, his eyes for a moment seemed to shoot from
out of his dusky skin. He threw up his arms and fell over on his side. Laura,
who had only sipped her cup, threw it from her. She, too, reeled for a moment.
The Professor and Quest came running up, attracted by Lenora&rsquo;s
shriek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re poisoned!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Veedemzoo!&rdquo; Quest shouted. &ldquo;My God! Pull yourself
together, Laura. Hold up for a minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dashed back to their little encampment and reappeared almost immediately.
He threw Laura&rsquo;s head back and forced some liquid down her throat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s camphor,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all
right, Laura. Hold on to yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung round to where the dragoman was lying, forced his mouth open, but
it was too late&mdash;the man was dead. He returned to Laura. She stumbled to
her feet. She was pale, and drops of perspiration were standing on her
forehead. She was able to rise to her feet, however, without assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am all right now,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>Quest felt her pulse and her forehead. They moved back to the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are within a dozen miles or so of the Mongar village,&rdquo; Quest
said grimly. &ldquo;Do you suppose that fellow could have been
watching?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all talked together for a time in low voices. The Professor was
inclined to scout the theory of Craig having approached them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must remember,&rdquo; he pointed out, &ldquo;that the Mongars
hate these fellows. It was part of my arrangement with Hassan that they should
leave us when we got in sight of the Mongar Encampment. It may have been meant
for Hassan. The Mongars hate the dragomen who bring tourists in this direction
at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They talked a little while longer and finally stole away to their tents to
sleep. Outside, the camel drivers talked still, chattering away, walking now
and then around Hassan&rsquo;s body in solemn procession. Finally, one of them
who seemed to have taken the lead, broke into an impassioned stream of words.
The others listened. When he had finished, there was a low murmur of fierce
approval. Silent-footed, as though shod in velvet, they ran to the tethered
camels, stacked the provisions once more upon their backs, lashed the guns
across their own shoulders. Soon they stole away&mdash;a long, ghostly
procession&mdash;into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those fellows seem to have left off their infernal chattering all of
a sudden,&rdquo; Quest remarked lazily from inside the tent.</p>
<p>The Professor made no answer. He was asleep.</p>
<h2><a name="ch12" id="ch12"></a>XII.&mdash;A DESERT VENGEANCE</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">Quest was the first the next morning to open his eyes, to
grope his way through the tent opening and stand for a moment alone, watching
the alabaster skies. Away eastwards, the faint curve of the blood-red sun
seemed to be rising out of the limitless sea of sand. The light around him was
pearly, almost opalescent, fading eastwards into pink. The shadows had passed
away. Though the sands were still hot beneath his feet, the silent air was
deliciously cool. He turned lazily around, meaning to summon the Arab who had
volunteered to take Hassan&rsquo;s place. His arms&mdash;he had been in the act
of stretching&mdash;fell to his sides. He stared incredulously at the spot
where the camels had been tethered. There were no camels, no drivers, no Arabs.
There was not a soul nor an object in sight except the stark body of Hassan,
which they had dragged half out of sight behind a slight knoll. High up in the
sky above were two little black specks, wheeling lower and lower. Quest
shivered as he suddenly realised that for the first time in his life he was
looking upon the winged ghouls of the desert. Lower and lower they came. He
turned away with a shiver.</p>
<p>The Professor was still sleeping when Quest re-entered the tent. He woke him
up and beckoned him to come outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; the former exclaimed genially, as he adjusted his
glasses, &ldquo;I am not sure that my toilet&mdash;however, the young ladies, I
imagine, are not yet astir. You did well to call me, Quest. This is the rose
dawn of Egypt. I have watched it from solitudes such as you have never dreamed
of. After all, we are here scarcely past the outskirts of
civilisation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find we are far enough!&rdquo; Quest remarked grimly.
&ldquo;What do you make of this, Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to the little sandy knoll with its sparse covering of grass,
deserted&mdash;with scarcely a sign, even, that it had been the resting place
of the caravan. The Professor gave vent to a little exclamation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our guides!&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;And the camels! What has
become of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I woke you up to ask you that question?&rdquo; Quest replied,
&ldquo;but I guess it&rsquo;s pretty obvious. We might have saved the money we
gave for those rifles in Port Said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor hurried off towards the spot where the encampment had been
made. Suddenly he stood still and pointed with his finger. In the clearer,
almost crystalline light of the coming day, they saw the track of the camels in
one long, unbroken line stretching away northwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No river near, where they could have gone to water the camels, or
anything of that sort, I suppose?&rdquo; Quest asked.</p>
<p>The Professor smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing nearer than a little stream you may have heard of in the days
when you studied geography,&rdquo; he observed derisively,&mdash;&ldquo;the
Nile. I never liked the look of those fellows, Quest. They sat and talked and
crooned together after Hassan&rsquo;s death. I felt that they were up to some
mischief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced around a little helplessly. Quest took a cigar from his case, and
lit it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that an old campaigner like I am,&rdquo; the Professor
continued, in a tone of abasement, &ldquo;should be placed in a position like
this! There have been times when for weeks together I have slept literally with
my finger upon the trigger of my rifle, when I have laid warning traps in case
the natives tried to desert in the night. I have even had our pack ponies
hobbled. I have learnt the secret of no end of devices. And here, with a shifty
lot of Arabs picked up in the slums of Port Said, and Hassan, the dragoman,
dying in that mysterious fashion, I permit myself to lie down and go to sleep!
I do not even secure my rifle! Quest, I shall never forgive myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good worrying,&rdquo; Quest sighed. &ldquo;The question is how
best to get out of the mess. What&rsquo;s the next move, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor glanced towards the sun and took a small compass from his
pocket. He pointed across the desert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s exactly our route,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I reckon
we still must be two days from the Mongars, and how we are going to get there
ourselves, much more get the women there, without camels, I don&rsquo;t know.
There are no wells, and I don&rsquo;t believe those fellows have left us a
single tin of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any chance of falling in with a caravan?&rdquo; Quest enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not one in a hundred,&rdquo; the Professor replied gloomily.
&ldquo;If we were only this short distance out of Port Said, and on one of the
recognised trade routes, we should probably meet half-a-dozen before mid-day.
Here we are simply in the wilds. The way we are going leads to nowhere and
finishes in an utterly uninhabitable jungle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think we&rsquo;d better turn round and try and bisect one of the
trade routes?&rdquo; Quest suggested.</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should never know when we&rsquo;d struck it. There are no
milestones or telegraph wires. We shall have to put as brave a face on it as
possible, and push on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura put her head out of the tent in which the two women had slept.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, where&rsquo;s breakfast?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t smell the coffee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They turned and approached her silently. The two girls, fully dressed, came
out of the tent as they approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young ladies,&rdquo; the Professor announced, &ldquo;I regret to say
that a misfortune has befallen us, a misfortune which we shall be able, without
a doubt, to surmount, but which will mean a day of hardship and much
inconvenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the camels?&rdquo; Lenora asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Quest replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Arabs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone with them&mdash;we are left high and dry,&rdquo; Quest
explained. &ldquo;Those fellows are as superstitious as they can be, and
Hassan&rsquo;s death has given them the scares. They have gone back to Port
Said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is worse,&rdquo; the Professor added, with a groan,
&ldquo;they have taken with them all our stores, our rifles and our
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How far are we from the Mongar Camp?&rdquo; Lenora asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About a day&rsquo;s tramp,&rdquo; Quest replied quickly. &ldquo;We
may reach there by nightfall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s start walking at once, before it gets any
hotter,&rdquo; Lenora suggested.</p>
<p>Quest patted her on the back. They made a close search of the tents but
found that the Arabs had taken everything in the way of food and drink, except
a single half-filled tin of drinking water. They moistened their lips with this
carefully, Quest with the camphor in his hand. They found it good, however,
though lukewarm. Laura produced a packet of sweet chocolate from her
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s some breakfast, this,&rdquo; she remarked, as she handed
it round. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s get a move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I may be permitted to make the suggestion,&rdquo; the
Professor advised, &ldquo;not too much chocolate. It is sustaining, I know, but
this sweetened concoction encourages thirst, and it is thirst which we have
most to&mdash;from which we may suffer most inconvenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, two, three&mdash;march!&rdquo; Laura sung out. &ldquo;Come on,
everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started bravely enough, but by mid-day their little stock of water was
gone, and their feet were sorely blistered. No one complained, however, and the
Professor especially did his best to revive their spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have come further than I had dared to hope, in the time,&rdquo; he
announced. &ldquo;Fortunately, I know the exact direction we must take. Keep up
your spirits, young ladies. At any time now we may see signs of our
destination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Makes one sad to think of the drinks we could have had,&rdquo; Quest
muttered. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole party stopped short. Before them was a distant vision of white
houses, of little stunted groves of trees, the masts of ships in the
distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Port Said!&rdquo; Quest exclaimed. &ldquo;What the
mischief&mdash;have we turned round? Say, Professor, has your compass got the
jim-jams?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care where it is,&rdquo; Lenora faltered, with tears in
her eyes. &ldquo;I thought Port Said was a horrible place, but just now I
believe it&rsquo;s heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor turned towards them and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see?&rdquo; he pointed out. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a
mirage&mdash;a desert mirage. They are quite common at dusk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora for a moment was hysterical, and even Laura gave a little sob. Quest
set his teeth and glanced at the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always water near where there&rsquo;s a mirage, isn&rsquo;t there,
Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; the Professor agreed. &ldquo;We are coming to
something, all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They struggled on once more. Night came and brought with it a half soothing,
half torturing coolness. That vain straining of the eyes upon the horizon, at
any rate, was spared to them. They slept in a fashion, but soon after dawn they
were on their feet again. They were silent now, for their tongues were swollen
and talk had become painful. Their walk had become a shamble, but there was one
expression in their haggard faces common to all of them&mdash;the brave, dogged
desire to struggle on to the last. Suddenly Quest, who had gone a little out of
his way to mount a low ridge of sand-hills, waved his arm furiously. He was
holding his field-glasses to his eyes. It was wonderful how that ray of hope
transformed them. They hurried to where he was. He passed the glasses to the
Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A caravan!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I can see the camels, and
horses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor almost snatched the glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;It is a caravan crossing
at right angles to our direction. Come! They will see us before
long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora began to sob and Laura to laugh. Both were struggling with a tendency
towards hysterics. The Professor and Quest marched grimly side by side. With
every step they took the caravan became more distinct. Presently three or four
horsemen detached themselves from the main body and came galloping towards
them. The eyes of the little party glistened as they saw that the foremost had
a water-bottle slung around his neck. He came dashing up, waving his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lost, people?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Want water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They almost snatched the bottle from him. It was like pouring life into
their veins. They all, at the Professor&rsquo;s instigation, drank sparingly.
Quest, with a great sigh of relief, lit a cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some adventure, this!&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>The Professor, who had been talking to the men in their own language, turned
back towards the two girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a caravan,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;of peaceful merchants on
their way to Jaffa. They are halting for us, and we shall be able, without a
doubt, to arrange for water and food and a camel or two horses. The man here
asks if the ladies will take the horses and ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They started off gaily to where the caravan had come to a standstill. They
had scarcely traversed a hundred yards, however, before the Arab who was
leading Lenora&rsquo;s horse came to a sudden standstill. He pointed with his
arm and commenced to talk in an excited fashion to his two companions. From
across the desert, facing them, came a little company of horsemen, galloping
fast and with the sunlight flashing upon their rifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mongars!&rdquo; the Arab cried, pointing wildly. &ldquo;They
attack the caravan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three Arabs talked together for a moment in an excited fashion. Then,
without excuse or warning, they swung the two women to the ground, leapt on
their horses, and, turning northwards, galloped away. Already the crack of the
rifles and little puffs of white smoke showed them where the Mongars, advancing
cautiously, were commencing their attack. The Professor looked on
anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not at all sure,&rdquo; he said in an undertone to Quest,
&ldquo;about our position with the Mongars. Craig has a peculiar hold upon
them, but as a rule they hate white men, and their blood will be up&hellip;.
See! the fight is all over. Those fellows were no match for the Mongars. Most
of them have fled and left the caravan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fight was indeed over. Four of the Mongars had galloped away in pursuit
of the Arabs who had been the temporary escort of Quest and his companions.
They passed about a hundred yards away, waving their arms and shouting
furiously. One of them even fired a shot, which missed Quest by only a few
inches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They say they are coming back,&rdquo; the Professor muttered.
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s this? It&rsquo;s the Chief and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our search is over, at any rate,&rdquo; Quest interrupted.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Craig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They came galloping up, Craig in white linen clothes and an Arab cloak; the
Chief by his side&mdash;a fine, upright man with long grey beard; behind, three
Mongars, their rifles already to their shoulders. The Chief wheeled up his
horse as he came within twenty paces of the little party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;White! English!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Why do you seek death
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waited for no reply but turned to his men. Three of them dashed forward,
their rifles, which were fitted with an odd sort of bayonet, drawn back for the
plunge. Quest, snatching his field-glasses from his shoulders, swung them by
the strap above his head, and brought them down upon the head of his assailant.
The man reeled and his rifle fell from his hand. Quest picked it up, and stood
on guard. The other two Mongars swung round towards him, raising their rifles
to their shoulders. Quest held Lenora to him. It seemed as though their last
second had come. Suddenly Craig, who had been a little in the rear, galloped,
shouting, into the line of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; he ordered. &ldquo;Chief, these people are my friends.
Chief, the word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief raised his arm promptly. The men lowered their rifles, and Craig
galloped back to his host&rsquo;s side. The Chief listened to him, nodding
gravely. Presently he rode up to the little party. He saluted the Professor and
talked to him in his own language. The Professor turned to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief apologises for not recognising me,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;It seems that Craig had told him that he had come to the desert for
shelter, and he imagined at once, when he gave the order for the attack upon
us, that we were his enemies. He says that we are welcome to go with him to his
encampment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest stood for a moment irresolute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me we&rsquo;re in a pretty fix,&rdquo; he muttered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to owe our lives to that fellow Craig, anyway, and how
shall we be able to get him away from them, goodness only knows.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;You must thank him for your lives&mdash;<br>
the Mongars never take prisoners.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;That is for later,&rdquo; the Professor said gravely. &ldquo;At
present I think we cannot do better than accept the hospitality of the Chief.
Even now the Chief is suspicious. I heard him ask Craig why, if these were his
friends, he did not greet them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig turned slowly towards them. It was a strange meeting. His face was
thin and worn, there were hollows in his cheeks, a dull light in his sunken
eyes. He had the look of the hunted animal. He spoke to them in a low tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is necessary,&rdquo; he told them, &ldquo;that you should pretend
to be my friends. The Chief has ordered two of his men to dismount. Their
ponies are for the young ladies. There will be horses for you amongst the
captured ones from the caravan yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we meet at last, Craig,&rdquo; the Professor said sternly.</p>
<p>Craig raised his eyes and dropped them again. He said nothing. He turned
instead once more towards Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever there may be between us,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your lives
are mine at this moment, if I chose to take them. For the sake of the women, do
as I advise. The Chief invites you to his encampment as his guests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all turned towards the Chief, who remained a little on the outside of
the circle. The Professor raised his hat and spoke a few words in his own
language, then he turned to the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have accepted the invitation of the Chief,&rdquo; he announced.
&ldquo;We had better start.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may not be Delmonico&rsquo;s,&rdquo; Laura remarked, a few hours
later, with a little sigh of contentment, &ldquo;but believe me that goat-stew
and sherbet tasted better than any chicken and champagne I ever
tasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t quite know what tobacco this is,&rdquo; Quest
added, helping himself to one of a little pile of cigarettes which had been
brought in to them, &ldquo;but it tastes good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They moved to the opening of the tent and sat looking out across the silent
desert. Laura took the flap of the canvas in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do all these marks mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are cabalistic signs,&rdquo; the Professor replied, &ldquo;part
of the language of the tribe. They indicate that this is the guest tent, and
there are a few little maxims traced upon it, extolling the virtues of
hospitality. Out in the desert there we met the Mongars as foes, and we had, I
can assure you, a very narrow escape of our lives. Here, under the shelter of
their encampment, it is a very different matter. We have eaten their
salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange position,&rdquo; Quest remarked moodily.</p>
<p>Lenora leaned forward to where a little group of Mongars were talking
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish that beautiful girl would come and let us see her
again,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She,&rdquo; the Professor explained, &ldquo;is the Chief&rsquo;s
daughter, Feerda, whose life Craig saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And from the way she looks at him,&rdquo; Laura observed, &ldquo;I
should say she hadn&rsquo;t forgotten it, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor held up a warning finger. The girl herself had glided to their
side out of the shadows. She faced the Professor. The rest of the party she
seemed to ignore. She spoke very slowly and in halting English.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father wishes to know that you are satisfied?&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You have no further wants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None,&rdquo; the Professor assured her. &ldquo;We are very grateful
for this hospitality, Feerda.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you talk to us for a little time?&rdquo; Lenora begged,
leaning forward.</p>
<p>The girl made no responsive movement. She seemed, if anything, to shrink a
little away. Her head was thrown back, her dark eyes were filled with dislike.
She turned suddenly to the Professor and spoke to him in her own language. She
pointed to the signs upon the tent, drew her finger along one of the sentences,
flashed a fierce glance at them all and disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me we are not exactly popular with the young lady,&rdquo;
Quest remarked. &ldquo;What was she saying, Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She suspects us,&rdquo; the Professor said slowly, &ldquo;of wishing
to bring evil to Craig. She pointed to a sentence upon the tent. Roughly it
means &lsquo;Gratitude is the debt of hospitality.&rsquo; I am very much afraid
that the young lady must have been listening to our conversation a while
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think of any girl,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;caring for a fiend
like Craig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before they knew it she was there again, her eyes on fire, her tone
shaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You call him evil, he who saved your lives, who saved you from the
swords of my soldiers!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I wish that you had all died
before you came here. I hope that you yet may die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She passed away into the night. The Professor looked anxiously after
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a humiliating reflection,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but we are
most certainly in Craig&rsquo;s power. Until we have been able to evolve some
scheme for liberating ourselves and taking him with us, if possible, I think
that we had better avoid any reference to him as much as possible. That young
woman is quite capable of stirring up the whole tribe against us. The whole
onus of hospitality would pass if they suspected we meant evil to Craig, and
they have an ugly way of dealing with their enemies&hellip;. Ah!
Listen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor suddenly leaned forward. There was a queer change in his face.
From somewhere on the other side of that soft bank of violet darkness came what
seemed to be the clear, low cry of some animal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the Mongar cry of warning,&rdquo; he said hoarsely.
&ldquo;Something is going to happen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whole encampment was suddenly in a state of activity. The Mongars ran
hither and thither, getting together their horses. The Chief, with Craig by his
side, was standing on the outskirts of the camp. The cry came again, this time
much louder and nearer. Soon they caught the muffled trampling of a
horse&rsquo;s hoofs galloping across the soft sands, then the gleam of his
white garments as he came suddenly into sight, in the edge of the little circle
of light thrown by the fire. They saw him leap from his horse, run to the
Chief, bend double in some form of salute, then commence to talk rapidly. The
Chief listened with no sign of emotion, but in a moment or two he was giving
rapid orders. Camels appeared from some invisible place. Men, already on
horseback, were galloping hither and thither, collecting fire-arms and spare
ammunition. Pack-horses were being loaded, tents rolled up and every evidence
of breaking camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me there&rsquo;s a move on,&rdquo; Quest muttered, as they
rose to their feet. &ldquo;I wonder if we are in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A moment or two later Craig approached them. He came with his shoulders
stooped and his eyes fixed upon the ground. He scarcely raised them as he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Word has been brought to the Chief,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;that
the Arab who escaped from the caravan has fallen in with an outpost of British
soldiers. They have already started in pursuit of us. The Mongars will take
refuge in the jungle, where they have prepared hiding-places. We start at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about us?&rdquo; the Professor enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I endeavoured,&rdquo; Craig continued, &ldquo;to persuade the Chief
to allow you to remain here, when the care of you would devolve upon the
English soldiers. He and Feerda, however, have absolutely refused my request.
Feerda has overheard some of your conversation, and the Chief believes that you
will betray us. You will have to come along, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; Laura exclaimed, &ldquo;that we&rsquo;ve got to
tramp into what you call the jungle, and hide there because these thieves are
being chased?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig glanced uneasily around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will do well to speak little
here. They have long ears and quick understandings, these men. You may call
them a race of robbers. They only remember that they are the descendants of an
Imperial race, and what they take by the right of conquest they believe Allah
sends them. You must do the bidding of the Chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away towards where the Chief and Feerda, already on horseback,
were waiting for him. Quest leaned towards the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not tackle the Chief yourself?&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;Here
he comes now. Craig may be speaking the truth, but, on the other hand,
it&rsquo;s all to his interests to keep us away from the soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor rose at once to his feet and stepped out to where the Chief
was giving orders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chief,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;my friends desire me to speak with you.
We are worn out with our adventures. The young ladies who are with us are
unused to and ill-prepared for this hard life. We beg that you will allow us to
remain here and await the arrival of the English soldiers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chief turned his head. There was little friendliness in his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wise man,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I have sent you my bidding by him
who is our honoured guest. I tell you frankly that I am not satisfied with the
explanations I have received of your presence here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Feerda leaned forward, her beautiful eyes flashing in the dim light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but I know,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;they would bring harm to the
master. I can read it in their hearts as I have heard it from their own
lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What my daughter says is truth,&rdquo; the Chief declared.
&ldquo;Back, wise man, and tell your friends that you ride with us to-night,
either as guests or captives. You may take your choice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor returned to where the others were eagerly awaiting him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is useless,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;The girl, who is clearly
enamoured of Craig, suspects us. So does the Chief. Perhaps, secretly, Craig
himself is unwilling to leave us here. The Chief never changes his mind and he
has spoken. We go either as his captives or his guests. I have heard it
said,&rdquo; the Professor added grimly, &ldquo;that the Mongars never keep
captives longer than twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all rose at once to their feet, and a few moments later horses were
brought. The little procession was already being formed in line. Craig
approached them once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will mount now and ride in the middle of our caravan,&rdquo; he
directed. &ldquo;The Chief does not trust you. If you value your lives, you
will do as you are bidden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the idea of the jungle,&rdquo; Lenora sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gives me the creeps,&rdquo; Laura admitted, as she climbed upon her
horse. &ldquo;Any wild animals there, Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor became more cheerful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The animal life of the region we are about to traverse,&rdquo; he
observed, as they moved off, &ldquo;is in some respects familiar to me. Twelve
years ago I devoted some time to research a little to the westward of our
present route. I will, if you choose, as we ride, give you a brief account of
some of my discoveries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two girls exchanged glances. Quest, who had intercepted them, turned his
horse and rode in between the Professor and Lenora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go right ahead, Professor,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;Fortunately the
girls have got saddles like boxes&mdash;I think they both mean to go to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An intelligent listener of either sex,&rdquo; the Professor said
amiably, &ldquo;will be a stimulus to my memory.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">&ldquo;You can call this fairyland, if you want,&rdquo; Laura
remarked, gazing around her; &ldquo;I call it a nasty, damp, oozy
spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed very beautiful when we first came,&rdquo; Lenora sighed,
&ldquo;but that was after the heat and glare of the desert. There does seem
something a little unhealthy about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just about fed up with Mongars,&rdquo; Quest declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We do nothing but lie about, and they won&rsquo;t even let us fire a
gun off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Personally,&rdquo; the Professor confessed, holding up a glass bottle
in front of him from which a yellow beetle was making frantic efforts to
escape, &ldquo;I find this little patch of country unusually interesting. The
specimen which I have here&mdash;I spare you the scientific name for
him&mdash;belongs to a class of beetle which has for long eluded me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura regarded the specimen with disfavour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I am concerned,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t have cared if he&rsquo;d eluded you a little longer.
Don&rsquo;t you dare let him out, Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear young lady,&rdquo; the Professor assured her, &ldquo;the
insect is perfectly secure. Through the cork, as you see, I have bored a couple
of holes, hoping to keep him alive until we reach Port Said, when I can prepare
him as a specimen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Port Said!&rdquo; Lenora murmured. &ldquo;It sounds like
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest motioned them to sit a little nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I fancy we are all feeling about the
same except the Professor, and even he wants to get some powder for his beetle.
I had a moment&rsquo;s talk with Craig this morning, and from what he says I
fancy they mean to make a move a little further in before long. It&rsquo;ll be
all the more difficult to escape then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think we could get away?&rdquo; Lenora whispered eagerly.</p>
<p>Quest glanced cautiously around. They were surrounded by thick vegetation,
but they were only a very short distance from the camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;we shall have to try it some
day or other and I&rsquo;m all for trying it soon. Even if they caught us, I
don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;d dare to kill us, with the English soldiers so
close behind. I am going to get hold of two or three rifles and some
ammunition. That&rsquo;s easy, because they leave them about all the time. And
what you girls want to do is to hide some food and get a bottle of
water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Craig?&rdquo; the Professor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are going to take him along,&rdquo; Quest declared grimly.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s had the devil&rsquo;s own luck so far, but it can&rsquo;t
last forever. I&rsquo;ll see to that part of the business, if you others get
ready and wait for me to give the signal&hellip;. What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all looked around. There had been a little rustling amongst the canopy
of bushes. Quest peered through and returned, frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feerda again,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;She hangs around all the
time, trying to listen to what we are saying. She couldn&rsquo;t have heard
this, though. Now, girls, remember. When the food is about this evening, see
how much you can get hold of. I know just where to find the guns and the
horses. Let&rsquo;s separate now. The Professor and I will go on a beetle
hunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They dispersed in various directions. It was not until late in the evening,
when the Mongars had withdrawn a little to indulge in their customary orgy of
crooning songs, that they were absolutely alone. Quest looked out of the tent
in which they had been sitting and came back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura lifted her skirt and showed an unusual projection underneath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora and I have pinned up our petticoats,&rdquo; she announced.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got plenty of food and a bottle of water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest threw open the white Arab cloak which he had been wearing. He had
three rifles strapped around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor&rsquo;s got the ammunition,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
we&rsquo;ve five horses tethered a hundred paces along the track we came by,
just behind the second tree turning to the left. I want you all to go there now
at once and take the rifles. There isn&rsquo;t a soul in the camp and you can
carry them wrapped in this cloak. I&rsquo;ll join you in ten
minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about Craig?&rdquo; the Professor enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am seeing to him,&rdquo; Quest replied.</p>
<p>Lenora hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather a risk?&rdquo; she whispered fearfully.</p>
<p>Quest&rsquo;s face was suddenly stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig is going back with us,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be
careful, Lenora. Don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strolled out of the tent and came back again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coast&rsquo;s clear,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Off you
go&hellip;. One moment,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;there are some papers in this
little box of mine which one of you ought to take care of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bent hastily over the little wallet, which never left him. Suddenly a
little exclamation broke from his lips. The Professor peered over his
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest never said a word. From one of the spaces of the wallet he drew out a
small black box, removed the lid and held out the card. They read it
together:</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;Fools, all of you! The cunning of the ages defeats
your puny efforts at every turn.</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;The Hands!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the Professor&rsquo;s lips blanched a little as he read. Quest,
however, seemed suddenly furious. He tore the card and the box to pieces, flung
them into a corner of the tent and drew a revolver from his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;we are going to make an end of
the Hands! Out you go now, girls. You can leave me to finish things
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One by one they stole along the path. Quest came out and watched them
disappear. Then he gripped his revolver firmly in his hand and turned towards
Craig&rsquo;s tent. There was something in the breathless stillness of the
place, at that moment, which seemed almost a presage of coming disaster.
Without knowing exactly why, Quest&rsquo;s fingers tightened on the butt of his
weapon. Then, from the thick growth by the side of the clearing, he saw a dark
shape steal out and vanish in the direction of Craig&rsquo;s tent. He came to a
standstill, puzzled. There had been rumours of lions all day, but the Professor
had been incredulous. The nature of the country, he thought, scarcely favoured
the probability of their presence. Then the still, heavy air was suddenly rent
by a wild scream of horror. Across the narrow opening the creature had
reappeared, carrying something in its mouth, something which gave vent all the
time to the most awful yells. Quest fired his revolver on chance and broke into
a run. Already the Mongars, disturbed in their evening amusement, were breaking
into the undergrowth in chase. Quest came to a standstill. It was from
Craig&rsquo;s tent that the beast had issued!</p>
<p>He turned slowly around. If Craig had indeed paid for his crimes by so
horrible a death, there was all the more reason why they should make their
escape in the general confusion, and make it quickly. He retraced his steps.
The sound of shouting voices grew less and less distinct. When he reached the
meeting place, he found the Professor standing at the corner with the rest. His
face showed signs of the most lively curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the commotion,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;I believe that, after
all, a lion has visited the camp. The cries which we have heard were distinctly
the cries of a native.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lion&rsquo;s been here all right,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and he has
finished our little job for us. That was Craig. I saw him come out of
Craig&rsquo;s tent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor was dubious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are mistaken. There is nothing
more characteristic and distinct than the Mongar cry of fear. They seldom use
it except in the face of death. That was the cry of a native Mongar. As for
Craig, well, you see that tree that looks like a dwarfed aloe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig was lying there ten minutes ago. He sprang up when he heard the
yells from the encampment, but I believe he is there now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got the horses all right?&rdquo; Quest enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything is waiting,&rdquo; the Professor replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have one more try, then,&rdquo; Quest declared.</p>
<p>He made his way slowly through the undergrowth to the spot which the
Professor had indicated. Close to the trunk of a tree Craig was standing.
Feerda was on her knees before him. She was speaking to him in broken
English.</p>

<br>
<div align="center"><img src="1202801h-images/TheBlackBox26.jpg" title=
"A group sits outside a tent in the desert, while a man gesticulates.">
<p class="caption">Feerda, the chief&rsquo;s daughter, listens enraptured<br>
to Craig&rsquo;s tales of faraway America.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;Dear master, you shall listen to your slave. These people are your
enemies. It would be all over in a few minutes. You have but to say the word.
My father is eager for it. No one would ever know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig patted her head. His tone was filled with the deepest despondency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible, Feerda,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You do not
understand. I cannot tell you everything. Sometimes I almost think that the
best thing I could do would be to return with them to the countries you know
nothing of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you are going to do, any way,&rdquo; Quest
declared, suddenly making his appearance. &ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He covered Craig with his revolver, but his arm was scarcely extended before
Feerda sprang at him like a little wild-cat. He gripped her with his left arm
and held her away with difficulty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re coming with us. You
know the way to Port Said and we want you&mdash;you know why. Untie that sash
from your waist. Quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig obeyed. He had the stupefied air of a man who has lost for the time
his volition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tie it to the tree,&rdquo; Quest ordered. &ldquo;Leave room
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig did as he was told. Then he turned and held the loose ends up. Quest
lowered his revolver for a moment as he pushed Feerda toward it. Craig, with a
wonderful spring, reached his side and kicked the revolver away. Before Quest
could even stoop to recover it, he saw the glitter of the other&rsquo;s knife
pressed against his chest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Craig declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made up my mind. I
won&rsquo;t go back to America. I&rsquo;ve had enough of being hunted all over
the world. This time I think I&rsquo;ll rid myself of one of you, at any
rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interruption was so unexpected that Craig lost his nerve. Through an
opening in the trees, only a few feet away, Lenora had suddenly appeared. She,
too, held a revolver; her hand was as steady as a rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop your knife,&rdquo; she ordered Craig.</p>
<p>He obeyed without hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tie the sash around the girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He obeyed mechanically. Feerda, who had been fiercely resisting
Quest&rsquo;s efforts to hold her, yielded without a struggle as soon as Craig
touched her. She looked at him, however, with bitter reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would tie me here?&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;You would leave
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Fate,&rdquo; Craig muttered. &ldquo;I am worn out with trying
to escape, Feerda. They will come soon and release you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her lips to shriek, but Quest, who had made a gag of her linen
head-dress, thrust it suddenly into her mouth. He took Craig by the collar and
led him to the spot where the others were waiting. They hoisted him on to a
horse. Already behind them they could see the flare of the torches from the
returning Mongars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the way to Port Said,&rdquo; Quest whispered. &ldquo;See
that you lead us there. There will be trouble, mind, if you
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig made no reply. He rode off in front of the little troop, covered all
the time by Quest&rsquo;s revolver. Very soon they were out of the jungle and
in the open desert. Quest looked behind him uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To judge by the row those fellows are making,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;I should think that they&rsquo;ve found Feerda already.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; the Professor said gravely, &ldquo;let me
recommend you to push on as fast as possible. We have had one escape from them,
but nothing in the world can save us now that you have laid hands upon Feerda.
The Chief would never forgive that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got a start, any way,&rdquo; Quest observed, &ldquo;and
these are the five best horses in the camp. Girls, a little faster. We&rsquo;ve
got to trust Craig for the direction but I believe he is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as my instinct tells me,&rdquo; the Professor agreed, &ldquo;I
believe that we are heading in precisely the right direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They galloped steadily on. The moon rose higher and higher until it became
almost as light as day. Often the Professor raised himself in his saddle and
peered forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This column of soldiers would march at night,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;I am hoping all the time that we may meet them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest fell a little behind to his side, although he never left off watching
Craig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look behind you, Professor,&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>In the far distance were a number of little black specks, growing every
moment larger. Even at that moment they heard the low, long call of the
Mongars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are gaining on us,&rdquo; Quest muttered.</p>
<p>The two girls, white though they were, bent over their horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll stick to it till the last moment,&rdquo; Quest continued,
&ldquo;then we&rsquo;ll turn and let them have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They raced on for another mile or more. A bullet whistled over their heads.
Quest tightened his reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No good,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d better stay and fight it
out, Professor. Stick close to me, Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They drew up and hastily dismounted. The Mongars closed in around them. A
cloud had drifted in front of the moon, and in the darkness it was almost
impossible to see their whereabouts. They heard the Chief&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot first that dog of a Craig!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a shriek. Suddenly Feerda, breaking loose from the others, raced
across the little division. She flung herself from her horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell my father that you were not faithless,&rdquo; she pleaded.
&ldquo;They shall not kill you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clung to Craig&rsquo;s neck. The bullets were beginning to whistle
around them now. All of a sudden she threw up her arms. Craig, in a fury,
turned around and fired into the darkness. Then suddenly, as though on the
bidding of some unspoken word, there was a queer silence. Every one was
distinctly conscious of an alien sound&mdash;the soft thud of many
horses&rsquo; feet galloping from the right; then a sharp, English voice of
command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your fire, men. Close into the left there. Steady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cloud suddenly rolled away from the moon. A long line of horsemen were
immediately visible. The officer in front rode forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drop your arms and surrender,&rdquo; he ordered sternly.</p>
<p>The Mongars, who were outnumbered by twenty to one, obeyed without
hesitation. Their Chief seemed unconscious, even, of what had happened. He was
on his knees, bending over the body of Feerda, half supported in Craig&rsquo;s
arms. The officer turned to Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the party who left Port Said for the Mongar Camp?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They took us into the jungle&mdash;just escaped. They&rsquo;d caught
us here, though, and I&rsquo;m afraid we were about finished if you
hadn&rsquo;t come along. We are not English&mdash;we&rsquo;re
American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Same thing,&rdquo; the officer replied, as he held out his hand.
&ldquo;Stack up their arms, men,&rdquo; he ordered, turning around. &ldquo;Tie
them in twos. Dennis, take the young ladies back to the commissariat
camels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor drew a little sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Commissariat!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;That sounds most
inviting.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">Side by side they leaned over the rail of the steamer and
gazed shorewards at the slowly unfolding scene before them. For some time they
had all preserved an almost ecstatic silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but it&rsquo;s good to see home again!&rdquo; Laura sighed at
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,&rdquo; Quest agreed emphatically.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the wrong side of the continent, perhaps, but I&rsquo;m
aching to set my foot on American soil again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This the wrong side of the continent! I should say not!&rdquo; Laura
exclaimed, pointing to where in the distance the buildings of the Exposition
gleamed almost snow-white in the dazzling sunshine. &ldquo;Why, I have never
seen anything so beautiful in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor intervened amiably. His face, too, shone with pleasure as he
gazed landwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with the young lady,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;The blood and
sinews of life may seem to throb more ponderously in New York, but there is a
big life here on this western side, a great, wide-flung, pulsating life. There
is room here, room to breathe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is so beautiful,&rdquo; Lenora murmured.</p>
<p>Quest glanced a little way along the deck to where a pale-faced man stood
leaning upon his folded arms, gazing upon the same scene. There was no smile on
Craig&rsquo;s face, no light of anticipation in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s one of us here,&rdquo; Quest observed,
&ldquo;who is none too pleased to see America again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora shivered a little. They were all grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must, I think, admit,&rdquo; the Professor said, &ldquo;that
Craig&rsquo;s deportment during the voyage has been everything that could be
desired. He has even voluntarily carried out certain small attentions to my
person which I must confess that I had greatly missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Quest agreed. &ldquo;At the same time
I am afraid the moment has come now to remind him that the end is drawing
near.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest moved slowly down the deck towards Craig&rsquo;s side, and touched him
on the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me your left wrist, Craig,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>The man slunk away. There was a sudden look of horror in his white face. He
started back but Quest was too quick for him. In a moment there was the click
of a handcuff, the mate of which was concealed under the criminologist&rsquo;s
cuff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better take things quietly,&rdquo; the latter advised.
&ldquo;It will only hurt you to struggle. Step this way a little. Put your hand
in your pocket, so, and no one will notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig obeyed silently. They stepped along the deck towards the rest of the
party. Lenora handed her glasses to Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do look, Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;There is Inspector
French standing in the front row on the dock, with two enormous bunches of
flowers&mdash;carnations for me, I expect, and poinsettias for Laura.
They&rsquo;re the larger bunch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest took the glasses and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s French, right enough,&rdquo; he assented. &ldquo;Look at
him standing straightening his tie in front of that advertisement mirror!
Flowers, too! Say, he&rsquo;s got his eye on one of you girls. Not you, by any
chance, is it, Lenora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora laughed across at Laura, who had turned a little pink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess French has got sense enough to know I&rsquo;m not that
sort,&rdquo; the latter replied. &ldquo;The double-harness stuff doesn&rsquo;t
appeal to me, and he knows it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora made a little grimace as she turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s brave talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost,&rdquo; the Professor pointed out, &ldquo;Amazonian. Yet in
the ancient days even the Amazons were sometimes tamed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo; Laura exclaimed, turning away. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t see why the man wants to make himself look like a walking
conservatory, though,&rdquo; she added under her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think it&rsquo;s sweet of him,&rdquo; Lenora insisted.
&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s anything I&rsquo;m longing for, it&rsquo;s a breath of
perfume from those flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slowly the great steamer drifted nearer and nearer to the dock, hats were
waved from the little line of spectators, ropes were drawn taut. The Inspector
was standing at the bottom of the gangway as they all passed down. He shook
hands with every one vigorously. Then he presented Lenora with her carnations
and Laura with the poinsettias. Lenora was enthusiastic. Even Laura murmured a
few words of thanks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some flowers, those poinsettias,&rdquo; the Inspector agreed.</p>
<p>Quest gripped him by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;French,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I tell you I shall make your hair curl
when you hear all that we&rsquo;ve been through. Do you feel like having me
start in right away, on our way to the cars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>French withdrew his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing doing,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I want to talk to Miss
Laura. You can stow that criminal stuff. It&rsquo;ll wait all right.
You&rsquo;ve got the fellow&mdash;that&rsquo;s what matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest exchanged an amused glance with Lenora. The Inspector and Laura fell a
little behind. The former took off his hat for a moment and fanned himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Miss Laura,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a plain man, and a
poor hand at speeches. I&rsquo;ve been saying a few nice things over to myself
on the dock here for the last hour, but everything&rsquo;s gone right out of my
head. Look here, it sums up like this. How do you feel about quitting this
bunch right away and coming back to New York with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do I want to go to New York for?&rdquo; Laura demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on, Miss Laura, you know what I mean,&rdquo; French replied.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll slip off and get married here and then take this man Craig
to New York. Once get him safely in the Tombs and we&rsquo;ll go off on a
honeymoon anywhere you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura was on the point of laughing at him. Then the unwonted seriousness of
his expression appealed suddenly to her sympathy. She patted him kindly on the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good sort, Inspector, but you&rsquo;ve picked the
wrong girl. I&rsquo;ve run along on my own hook ever since I was born, I guess,
and I can&rsquo;t switch my ideas over to this married stuff. You&rsquo;d
better get a move on and get Craig back to New York before he slips us again.
I&rsquo;m going to stay here with the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector sighed. His face had grown long, and the buoyancy had passed
from his manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is some disappointment, believe me, Miss Laura,&rdquo; he
confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; she laughed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get over it all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the others waiting for them at the end of the great wooden shed.
Quest turned to French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, French,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you know I don&rsquo;t want
to hurry you off, but I don&rsquo;t know what we&rsquo;re going to do with this
fellow about in San Francisco. We don&rsquo;t want to lodge two charges, and we
should have to put him in jail to-night. Why don&rsquo;t you take him on right
away? There&rsquo;s a Limited goes by the southern route in an hour&rsquo;s
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>French assented gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits me,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be glad to get
rid of the fellow, too,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>They drove straight to the depot, found two vacant seats in the train, and
Quest with a little sigh of relief handed over his charge. Craig, who, though
still dumb, had shown signs of intense nervousness since the landing, sank back
in his corner seat, covering the upper part of his head with his hands.
Suddenly Lenora, who had been chatting with French through the window, happened
to glance towards Craig. She gave a little cry and stepped back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;The eyes! Those are the eyes that
haunted me all through those terrible days!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was suddenly white. Quest passed his arm through hers and glanced
through the carriage window. In the shaded light, Craig&rsquo;s eyes seemed
indeed to have suddenly grown in power and intensity. They shone fiercely from
underneath the hands which clasped his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the last you&rsquo;ll see of them,&rdquo; Quest
reminded her soothingly. &ldquo;Come, you&rsquo;re not going to break down now,
Lenora. We&rsquo;ve been through it all and there he is, safe and sound in
French&rsquo;s keeping. There is nothing more left in the world to frighten
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora pulled herself together with an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was silly,&rdquo; she confessed, &ldquo;yet even
now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, Miss Lenora,&rdquo; French cried from out of
the window. &ldquo;You can take my word for it the job&rsquo;s finished this
time. Good-bye, all of you! Good-bye, Miss Laura!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura waved her hand gaily. They all stood and watched the train depart.
Then they turned away from the depot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for a little holiday,&rdquo; Quest declared, passing
Lenora&rsquo;s arm through his. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just have a look round the
city and then get down to San Diego and take a look at the Exposition there. No
responsibilities, no one to look after, nothing to do but enjoy
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; the Professor agreed, beaming upon them all.
&ldquo;There is a collection of fossilised remains in the museum here, the
study of which will afford me the greatest pleasure and interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girls laughed heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you and I,&rdquo; Quest suggested, turning to them,
&ldquo;will part company with the Professor!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Quest and Lenora turned away from the window of the hotel, out of which they
had been gazing for the last quarter of an hour. Stretched out before them were
the lights of the Exposition, a blur of twinkling diamonds against the black
garb of night. Beyond, the flashing of a light-house and a faint background of
dark sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too beautiful,&rdquo; Lenora sighed.</p>
<p>Quest stood for a moment shaking his head. The Professor with a pile of
newspapers stretched out before him, was completely engrossed in their perusal.
Laura, who had been sitting in an armchair at the further end of the apartment,
was apparently deep in thought. The newspaper which she had been reading had
slipped unnoticed from her fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you two are no sort of people for a holiday,&rdquo; Quest
declared. &ldquo;As for you, Laura, I can&rsquo;t think what&rsquo;s come over
you. You never opened your mouth at dinner-time, and you sit there now looking
like nothing on earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am beginning to suspect her,&rdquo; Lenora chimed in. &ldquo;Too
bad he had to hurry away, dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura&rsquo;s indignation was not altogether convincing. Quest and Lenora
exchanged amused glances. The former picked up the newspaper from the floor and
calmly turned out the Professor&rsquo;s lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;this is the first night of our
holiday. I&rsquo;m going to run the party and I&rsquo;m going to make the
rules. No more newspapers to-night or for a fortnight. You understand? No
reading, nothing but frivolity. And no love-sickness, Miss Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love-sickness, indeed!&rdquo; she repeated scornfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having arranged those minor details,&rdquo; Quest concluded,
&ldquo;on with your hats, everybody. I am going to take you out to a
caf&eacute; where they play the best music in the city. We are going to have
supper, drink one another&rsquo;s health, and try and forget the last few
months altogether.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora clapped her hands and Laura rose at once to her feet. The Professor
obediently crossed the room for his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am convinced,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that our friend Quest&rsquo;s
advice is good. We will at any rate embark upon this particular frivolity which
he suggests.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">Quest took the dispatch which the hotel clerk handed to him
one afternoon a fortnight later, and read it through without change of
expression. Lenora, however, who was by his side, knew at once that it
contained something startling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He passed his arm through hers and led her down the hall to where the
Professor and Laura were just waiting for the lift. He beckoned them to follow
him to a corner of the lounge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s one thing I quite forgot, a fortnight ago,&rdquo; he
said, slowly, &ldquo;when I suggested that we should none of us look at a
newspaper all the time we were in California. Have you kept to our bargain,
Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, girls?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even seen one,&rdquo; Lenora declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; Laura echoed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a mistake,&rdquo; Quest confessed. &ldquo;Something has
happened which we ought to have known about. You had better read this
message&mdash;or, wait, I&rsquo;ll read it aloud:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote"><tt>TO SANFORD QUEST, GARFIELD HOTEL, SAN DIEGO. INJURED IN
WRECK OF LIMITED. RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS TODAY. CRAIG REPORTED BURNED IN WRECK
BUT THINK YOU HAD BETTER COME ON. FRENCH, SAMARITAN HOSPITAL, ALLGUEZ.</tt></p>
<p>&ldquo;When can we start?&rdquo; Laura exclaimed excitedly.</p>
<p>Lenora clutched at Quest&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it,&rdquo; she declared simply. &ldquo;I felt perfectly
certain, when they left San Francisco, that something would happen. We
haven&rsquo;t seen the end of Craig yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest, who had been studying a time-table, glanced once more at the
dispatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Allguez isn&rsquo;t so far out of
the way if we take the southern route to New York. Let&rsquo;s get a move on
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura led the way to the lift. She was in a state of rare discomposure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think that all the time we&rsquo;ve been giddying round,&rdquo;
she muttered, &ldquo;that poor man has been lying in hospital! Makes one feel
like a brute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been unconscious all the time,&rdquo; Quest reminded
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might have expected to find us there when he came-to, any way,&rdquo;
Laura insisted.</p>
<p>Lenora smiled faintly as she caught a glance from Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura&rsquo;s got a heart somewhere,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;only
it takes an awful lot of getting at!&rdquo;&hellip;</p>
<p>They found French, already convalescent, comfortably installed in the
private ward of a small hospital in the picturesque New Mexican town. Laura
almost at once established herself by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to lose your job here, nurse,&rdquo; Quest told
her, smiling.</p>
<p>The nurse glanced at French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The change seems to be doing him good, any way,&rdquo; she remarked.
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen him look so bright yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you remember anything about the wreck, French?&rdquo; Quest
enquired.</p>
<p>The Inspector passed his hand wearily over his forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems more like a dream&mdash;or rather a nightmare&mdash;than
anything,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;I was sitting opposite Craig when the
crash came. I was unconscious for a time. When I came to, I was simply pinned
down by the side of the car. I could see a man working hard to release me,
tugging and straining with all his might. Every now and then I got a glimpse of
his face. It seemed queer, but I could have sworn it was Craig. Then other
people passed by. I heard the shriek of a locomotive. I could see a doctor
bending over some bodies. Then it all faded away and came back again. The
second time I was nearly free. The man who had been working so hard was just
smashing the last bit of timber away, and again I saw his face and that time I
was sure that it was Craig. Anyway, he finished the job. I suddenly felt I
could move my limbs. The man stood up as though exhausted, looked at me, called
to the doctor, and then he seemed to fade away. It might have been because I
was unconscious myself, for I don&rsquo;t remember anything else until I found
myself in bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would indeed,&rdquo; the Professor remarked, &ldquo;be an
interesting circumstance&mdash;an interesting psychological circumstance, if I
might put it that way&mdash;if Craig, the arch-criminal, the man who has seemed
to us so utterly devoid of all human feeling, should really have toiled in this
manner to set free his captor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interesting or not,&rdquo; Quest observed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to
know whether it was Craig or not. I understand there were about a dozen
unrecognisable bodies found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse, who had left the room for a few minutes, returned with a small
package in her hand, which she handed to French. He looked at it in a puzzled
manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can that be?&rdquo; he muttered, turning it over.
&ldquo;Addressed to me all right, but there isn&rsquo;t a soul knows I&rsquo;m
here except you people. Will you open it, Miss Laura?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took it from him and untied the strings. A little breathless cry escaped
from her lips as she tore open the paper. A small black box was disclosed. She
opened the lid with trembling fingers and drew out a scrap of paper. They all
leaned over and read together:&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;You have all lost again. Why not give it up? You can
never win.</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;The Hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora was perhaps the calmest. She simply nodded with the melancholy air of
satisfaction of one who finds her preconceived ideas confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo; she exclaimed softly. &ldquo;I knew it at the
depot. Craig&rsquo;s time has not come yet. He may be somewhere near us, even
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She glanced uneasily around the ward. Quest, who had been examining the
post-mark on the package, threw the papers down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The post-mark&rsquo;s all blurred out,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about it, that fellow Craig has the devil&rsquo;s
own luck, but we&rsquo;ll get him&mdash;we&rsquo;ll get him yet. I&rsquo;ll
just take a stroll up to police head-quarters and make a few inquiries. You
might come with me, Lenora, and Laura can get busy with her amateur
nursing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall make inquiries,&rdquo; the Professor announced briskly,
&ldquo;concerning the local museum. There should be interesting relics
hereabouts of the prehistoric Indians.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<p class="first">A man sat on the steps of the range cook wagon, crouching as
far back as possible to take advantage of its slight shelter from the burning
sun. He held before him a newspaper, a certain paragraph of which he was
eagerly devouring. In the distance the mail boy was already disappearing in a
cloud of dust.</p>
<p class="headline">&ldquo;FAMOUS CRIMINOLOGIST IN ALLGUEZ</p>
<p class="newspaper">&ldquo;Sanford Quest and his assistants, accompanied by
Professor Lord Ashleigh, arrived in Allguez a few days ago to look for John
Craig, formerly servant to the scientist. Craig has not been seen since the
accident to the Limited, a fortnight ago, and by many is supposed to have
perished in the wreck. He was in the charge of Inspector French, and was on his
way to New York to stand his trial for homicide. French was taken to the
hospital, suffering from concussion of the brain, but is now
convalescent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man read the paragraph twice. Then he set down the paper and looked
steadily across the rolling prairie land. There was a queer, bitter little
smile upon his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it begins again!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>There was a cloud of dust in the distance. The man rose to his feet, shaded
his eyes with his hand and shambled round to the back of the wagon, where a
long table was set out with knives and forks, hunches of bread and tin cups. He
walked a little further away to the fire, and slowly stirred a pot of stew. The
little party of cowboys came thundering up. There was a chorus of shouts and
exclamations, whistlings and good-natured chaff, as they threw themselves from
their horses. Long Jim stood slowly cracking his whip and looking down the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boys, I think he&rsquo;s fixed things up all right,&rdquo; he
remarked. &ldquo;Come on with the grub, cookie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently the man filled each dish with the stew and laid it in its place.
Then he retired to the background and the cowboys commenced their meal. Long
Jim winked at the others as he picked up a biscuit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cookie, you&rsquo;re no good,&rdquo; he called out. &ldquo;The
stew&rsquo;s rotten. Here, take this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He flicked the biscuit, which caught the cook on the side of the head. For a
moment the man started. With his hand upon his temple he flashed a look of
hatred towards his assailant. Long Jim laughed carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, cookie,&rdquo; the latter went on, &ldquo;where did you get them
eyes? Guess we&rsquo;ll have to tame you a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meal was soon over, and Jim strolled across to where the others were
saddling up. He passed his left arm through the reins of his horse and turned
once more to look at Craig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you mind you do better to-night, young fellow. Eh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped short with a cry of pain. The horse had suddenly started,
wrenching at the reins. Jim&rsquo;s arm hung helplessly down from the
shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee, boys, he&rsquo;s broken it!&rdquo; he groaned. &ldquo;Say, this
is hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swore in agony. They all crowded around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s broken, sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrong, you helpless sons of loons!&rdquo; Jim yelled.
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t any of you do something?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook suddenly pushed his way through the little crowd. He took
Jim&rsquo;s shoulder firmly in one hand and his arm in the other. The cowboy
howled with pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go my arm!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Kill him, boys! My God,
I&rsquo;ll make holes in you for this!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He snatched at his gun with his other hand and the cowboys scattered a
little. The cook stepped back, the gun flashed out, only to be suddenly
lowered. Jim looked incredulously towards his left arm, which hung no longer
helplessly by his side. He swung it backwards and forwards, and a broad grin
slowly lit up his lean, brown face. He thrust the gun in his holster and held
out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cookie, you&rsquo;re all right!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done the trick this time. Say, you&rsquo;re a
miracle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your arm was just out of joint,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;It was
rather a hard pull but it&rsquo;s all right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked around at the others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to think that I might have killed him!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Cookie, you&rsquo;re a white boy. You&rsquo;ll do. We&rsquo;re going to
like you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig watched them ride off. The bitterness had passed from his face. Slowly
he began to clean up. Then he crept underneath the wagon and
rested&hellip;.</p>
<p>Evening came and with it a repetition of his labours. When everything was
ready to serve, he stepped from behind the wagon and looked across the rolling
stretch of open country. There was no one in sight. Softly, almost stealthily,
he crept up to the wagon, fetched out from its wooden case a small violin, made
his way to the further side of the wagon, sat down with his back to the wheel
and began to play. His eyes were closed. Sometimes the movements of his fingers
were so slow that the melody seemed to die away. Then unexpectedly he picked it
up, carrying the same strain through quick, convulsive passages, lost it again,
wandered as though in search of it, extemporising all the time, yet playing
always with the air of a man who feels and sees the hidden things. Suddenly the
bow rested motionless. A look of fear came into his face. He sprang up. The
cowboys were all stealing from the other side of the wagon. They had arrived
and dismounted without his hearing them. He sprang to his feet and began to
stammer apologies. Long Jim&rsquo;s hand was laid firmly upon his
shoulders.</p>

<p class="caption">Craig wins the cowpuncher&rsquo;s admiration by his skill as

</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;Say, cookie, you don&rsquo;t need to look so scared. You ain&rsquo;t
done nothing wrong. Me and the boys, we like your music. Sing us another tune
on that fiddle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t neglected anything,&rdquo; Craig faltered.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all ready to serve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grub can wait,&rdquo; Jim replied. &ldquo;Pull the bow, partner,
pull the bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook looked at him for a moment incredulously. Then he realised that the
cowboy was in earnest. He picked up the bow and commenced to play again. They
sat around him, wondering, absolutely absorbed. No one even made a move towards
the food. It was Craig who led them there at last himself, still playing. Long
Jim threw his arm almost caressingly around his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Cookie,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;there ain&rsquo;t never no
questions asked concerning the past history of the men who find their way out
here, just so long as they don&rsquo;t play the game yellow. Maybe you&rsquo;ve
fitted up a nice little hell for yourself somewhere, but we ain&rsquo;t none of
us hankering to know the address. You&rsquo;re white and you&rsquo;re one of us
and any time any guy wants to charge you rent for that little hell where you
got the furniture of your conscience stored, why, you just let us settle with
him, that&rsquo;s all. Now, one more tune, Cookie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig shook his head. He had turned away to where the kettle was hissing on
the range fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is time you had your food,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Long Jim took up the violin and drew the bow across it. There was a chorus
of execrations. Craig snatched it from him. He suddenly turned his back upon
them all. He had played before as though to amuse himself. He played now with
the complete, almost passionate absorption of the artist. His head was
uplifted, his eyes half closed. He was no longer the menial, the fugitive from
justice. He was playing himself into another world, playing amidst a silence
which, considering his audience, was amazing. They crouched across the table
and watched him. Long Jim stood like a figure of stone. The interruption which
came was from outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More of these damned tourists,&rdquo; Long Jim muttered.
&ldquo;Women, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig had stopped playing. He turned his head slowly. Quest was in the act
of dismounting from his horse. By his side was the Professor; just behind,
Lenora and Laura. Long Jim greeted them with rough cordiality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what are you folks looking for?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>Quest pointed to Craig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We want that man,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;This is Inspector
French from New York. I am Sanford Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tense silence. Craig covered his face with his hands, then
suddenly looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t come,&rdquo; he cried fiercely. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
hounded me all round the world. I am innocent. I won&rsquo;t come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest shrugged his shoulders. He took a step forward, but Long Jim, as
though by accident, sauntered in the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got a warrant?&rdquo; he asked tersely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need it,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s our
man, right enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right this minute he&rsquo;s our cook,&rdquo; drawled Long Jim,
&ldquo;and we ain&rsquo;t exactly particular about going hungry to please a
bunch of strangers. Cut it short, Mister. If you ain&rsquo;t got a warrant, you
ain&rsquo;t got this man. Maybe we don&rsquo;t sport finger-bowls and silk
socks, but we&rsquo;re civilised enough not to let no slim dude walk off with
one of our boys without proper authority. So you can just meander along back
where you come from. Ain&rsquo;t that right, boys?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sullen murmur of assent. Quest turned back and whispered for a
moment to the Inspector. Then he turned to Long Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;The Inspector here and I will
soon see to that. We&rsquo;ll ride back to the township. With your permission,
the ladies and our elderly friend will remain for a rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome to anything we&rsquo;ve got except our
cook,&rdquo; Jim replied, turning away&hellip;.</p>
<p>Darkness came early and the little company grew closer and closer to the
camp fire, where Craig had once more taken up the violin. The Professor had
wandered off somewhere into the darkness and the girls were seated a little
apart. They had been treated hospitably but coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem to cotton to us, these boys,&rdquo; Laura
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t like us,&rdquo; Lenora replied, &ldquo;because they
think we are after Craig. I wonder what Long Jim has been whispering to him,
and what that paper is he has been showing Craig. Do you know how far we are
from the Mexican border?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not more than five or six miles, I believe,&rdquo; Laura replied.</p>
<p>Lenora rose softly to her feet and strolled to the back of the range wagon.
In a few moments she reappeared, carrying a piece of paper in her hand. She
stooped down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig&rsquo;s saddling up,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Look what he
dropped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out the paper, on which was traced a roughly drawn map.</p>

<p class="caption">The cowboys consult a map while arranging for Craig&rsquo;s
escape.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;That line&rsquo;s the river that marks the Mexican border,&rdquo; she
explained. &ldquo;You see where Long Jim&rsquo;s put the cross? That&rsquo;s
where the bridge is. That other cross is the camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pointed away southwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the line,&rdquo; she continued. &ldquo;Laura,
where&rsquo;s the Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Laura replied. &ldquo;He rode off some
time ago, said he was going to meet Mr. Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only he were here!&rdquo; Lenora muttered. &ldquo;I feel sure
Craig means to escape. There he goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw him ride off into the darkness. Lenora ran to where her horse was
tethered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going after him,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;Listen,
Laura. If they arrive soon, send them after me. That&rsquo;s the line, as near
as I can tell you,&rdquo; she added, pointing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait; I&rsquo;m coming too!&rdquo; Laura exclaimed.</p>
<p>Lenora shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must stay here and tell them about it,&rdquo; she insisted.
&ldquo;I shall be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She galloped off while Laura was still undecided. Almost at that moment she
heard from behind the welcome sound of horses&rsquo; feet in the opposite
direction and Quest alone galloped up. Laura laid her hand upon his rein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are the others?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;French and two deputies from the township are about a mile
behind,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve had trouble with their
horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get off,&rdquo; Laura continued quickly. &ldquo;Craig has
escaped, riding towards the Mexican frontier. Lenora is following him.
He&rsquo;s gone in that direction,&rdquo; she added, pointing. &ldquo;When you
come to the river you&rsquo;ll have to hunt for the bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest frowned as he gathered up his reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid they&rsquo;d try something of the sort,&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;Tell the others where I&rsquo;ve gone, Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He galloped off into the darkness. Behind, there were some growls from the
little group of cowboys, none of whom, however, attempted to interfere with
him. Long Jim stood up and gazed sullenly southwards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cookie&rsquo;ll make the bridge all right,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;If the girl catches him, she can&rsquo;t do anything. And that last
guy&rsquo;ll never make it. Whoop! Here come the rest of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector, with two deputies, rode suddenly into the camp. The Inspector
paused to speak to Laura. Long Jim&rsquo;s eyes sparkled as he saw them
approach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s old Harris and fat Andy,&rdquo; he whispered.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have some fun with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The older of the two deputies approached them frowning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been at your games again, Long Jim?&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;I hear
you declined to hand over a criminal who&rsquo;s been sheltering on your ranch?
You&rsquo;ll get into trouble before you&rsquo;ve finished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got the warrant?&rdquo; Jim asked.</p>
<p>The deputy produced it. Long Jim looked at it curiously and handed it
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess the only other thing you want, then, is the man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better produce him quickly,&rdquo; the deputy advised.</p>
<p>Jim turned away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t do it. He&rsquo;s beat it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you&rsquo;ve let him go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go?&rdquo; Jim repeated. &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t got no right to
keep him. He took the job on at a moment&rsquo;s notice and he left at a
moment&rsquo;s notice. There&rsquo;s some of your party after him, all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deputies whispered to one another. The elder of the two turned
around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said to the cowboys, glancing around for Long
Jim, who had disappeared, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve had about enough of your
goings-on. I reckon we&rsquo;ll take one of you back and see what seven
days&rsquo; bread and water will do towards civilising you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a little mutter. The deputies stood side by side. With an almost
simultaneous movement they had drawn their guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Long Jim?&rdquo; the older one asked.</p>
<p>There was a sudden whirring about their heads. A lariat, thrown with
unerring accuracy, had gathered them both in its coil. With a jerk they were
drawn close together, their hands pinned to their side. Two cowboys quickly
disarmed them. Long Jim came sauntering round from the other side of the range
wagon, tightening the rope as he walked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;ve got a hell of a nerve, butting into a peaceable
camp like this. We ain&rsquo;t broke no laws. So you&rsquo;re a&rsquo;going to
civilise us, eh? Well, Mister Harris, we can play that civilising game, too.
Hey boys, all together, tie &rsquo;em up against that wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A dozen willing hands secured them. The two men spluttered wildly, half in
anger, half in fear of their tormentors, but in a few seconds they were secured
firmly against the canvas-topped wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now sit easy, gentlemen, sit easy. Nothing&rsquo;s going to hurt
you.&rdquo; Long Jim shoved fresh cartridges into his forty-five. &ldquo;That
is, unless you&rsquo;re unlucky. Line up there, boys, one at a time now. Bud,
you and Tim and Dough-head give them guys a singe, their hair&rsquo;s getting
too long. The rest of you boys just content yourselves doing a fancy decoration
on the canvas all around &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ll deevote my entire attenshun to
trimming them lugshuriant whiskers, Mister Harris is a-sporting. All ready
now,&mdash;one, two, three, let &rsquo;em whistle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two deputies gave a simultaneous yell as several bullets sung by their
ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoa, old horses,&rdquo; drawled Long Jim. &ldquo;Flies bothering you
some, eh? Sit easy, sit easy. Too dangerous hopping around that way. You might
stick yourselves right in the way of one of them spitballs. Some nerve tonic
this! A.X.X. Ranch brand, ready to serve at all hours, cheap at half the price.
Ah ha, pretty near shaved your upper lip that time, didn&rsquo;t I, Mister
Harris. My hand&rsquo;s a bit unsteady, what with all the excitement
hereabouts. Say, put a stem on that chrysanthemum you&rsquo;re doing,
Cotton-top.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men, racked with fury and terror, ridiculous in their trussed-up
state, motionless and strained, crouched in terror while the bullets passed all
around them. Inspector French tapped Long Jim on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he remonstrated, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re looking for
trouble. You can&rsquo;t treat the representatives of the law like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long Jim turned slowly around. His politeness was ominous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you got me scared,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Am I going to be
hung?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The law must be respected,&rdquo; French said firmly. &ldquo;Untie
those men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long Jim scratched his head for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mr. Inspector,&rdquo; he remarked, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a fine
man in your way but you weigh too much&mdash;that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the
matter with you. Boys,&rdquo; he added, turning around, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the
best exercise for reducing flesh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dancing,&rdquo; they shouted.</p>
<p>Long Jim grinned. He fell a little back. Suddenly he lowered his gun and
shot into the ground, barely an inch from French&rsquo;s feet. The Inspector
leaped into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once more, boys,&rdquo; the cowboy went on. &ldquo;Keep it up,
Inspector. Jump a little higher next time. You barely cleared that
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bullets buried themselves in the dust around the Inspector&rsquo;s feet.
Fuming with anger, French found himself continually forced to jump. The two
deputies, forgotten for the moment, watched with something that was almost like
a grin upon their faces. Laura, protesting loudly, was obliged more than once
to look away to hide a smile. Jim at last slipped his gun into his holster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more ammunition to waste, boys,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;Untie
the guys with the warrant and bring out the bottle of rye. Say,&rdquo; he went
on, addressing the deputies as they struggled to their feet, &ldquo;and you,
Mr. New-Yorker, is it to be friends and a drink, or do you want a
quarrel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deputies were very thirsty. The perspiration was streaming down
French&rsquo;s forehead. They all looked at one another. Laura whispered in
French&rsquo;s ear and he nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call it a drink,&rdquo; he decided.</p>

<p class="caption">Lenora knows that Quest is in danger and goes to find
him.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>The hunted man turned around with a little gasp. Before him was the rude
mountain bridge, and on the other side&mdash;freedom. Scarcely a dozen lengths
away was Lenora, and close behind her came Quest. He slackened speed as he
walked his horse cautiously on to the planked bridge. Suddenly he gave a little
cry. The frail structure, unexpectedly insecure, seemed to sway beneath his
weight. Lenora, who had been riding fast, was unable to stop herself. She came
on to the bridge at a half canter. Craig, who had reached the other side in
safety, threw up his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;My God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bridge suddenly collapsed as though it had been made of paper. Lenora,
grasping her horse, was thrown into the stream. Quest, galloping up, was only
able to check himself just in time. He flung himself from his horse, and
plunged into the stream. It was several moments before he was able to reach
Lenora. From the opposite bank Craig watched them, glancing once or twice at
the bridge. One of the wooden pillars had been sawn completely through.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hurt, dear?&rdquo; Quest gasped, as he drew Lenora to the
bank.</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just my side. Did Craig get away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest looked gloomily across the stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig&rsquo;s in Mexico, right enough,&rdquo; he answered savagely,
&ldquo;but I am beginning to feel that I could fetch him back out of
hell!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="ch14" id="ch14"></a>XIV.&mdash;TONGUES OF FLAME</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">From the shadows of the trees on the further side of the
river, Craig with strained eyes watched Quest&rsquo;s struggle. He saw him
reach Lenora, watched him struggle to the bank with her, waited until he had
lifted her on to his horse. Then he turned slowly around and faced the one
country in the world where freedom was still possible for him. He looked into a
wall of darkness, penetrated only at one spot by a little blaze of light.
Slowly, with his arm through the bridle of his horse, he limped towards it. As
he drew nearer and discovered its source, he hesitated. The light came through
the uncurtained windows of a saloon, three long, yellow shafts illuminating the
stunted shrubs and sandy places. Craig kept in the shadow between them and drew
a little nearer. From inside he could hear the thumping of a worn piano, the
twanging of a guitar, the rattle of glasses, the uproarious shouting of men,
the shrill laughter of women. The tired man and the lame horse stole
reluctantly a little nearer. Craig listened once more wearily. It was home he
longed for so much&mdash;and rest. The very thought of the place sickened him.
Even when he reached the door, he hesitated and instead of entering stood back
amongst the shadows. If only he could find any other sort of shelter!</p>
<p>Inside, the scene was ordinary enough. There was a long bar, against which
were lounging half-a-dozen typical Mexican cowpunchers. There was a small space
cleared for dancing, at the further end of which two performers were making
weird but vehement music. Three girls were dancing with cowboys, not
ungracefully considering the state of the floor and the frequent discords in
the music. One of them&mdash;the prettiest&mdash;stopped abruptly and pushed
her partner away from her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have drunk too much, Jos&eacute;!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
&ldquo;You cannot dance. You tread on my feet and you lean against me. I do not
like it. I will dance with you another night when you are sober. Go away,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her cavalier swayed for a moment on his feet. Then he looked down upon her
with an evil glitter in his eyes. He was tall and thin, with a black moustache
and yellow, unpleasant-looking teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you will not dance any longer with Jos&eacute;?&rdquo; he
muttered. &ldquo;Very well, you shall drink with him, then. We will sit
together at one of those little tables. Listen, you shall drink
wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want to drink wine with you. All that I wish is to be left
alone,&rdquo; the girl insisted curtly. &ldquo;Go and play cards, if you want
to. There is Pietro over there, and Diego. Perhaps you may win some money. They
say that drunkards have all the luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jos&eacute; leered at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Presently I will play cards,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Presently I will
win all their money and I will buy jewelry for you, Marta&mdash;stones that
look like diamonds and will sparkle in your neck and in your hair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned disdainfully away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not want your jewelry, Jos&eacute;,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>He caught her suddenly by the wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps this is what you want,&rdquo; he cried, as he stooped down to
kiss her.</p>
<p>She swung her right hand round and struck him on the face. He staggered back
for a moment. There was a red flush which showed through the tan of his cheek.
Then he drew a little nearer to her, and before she could escape he had passed
his long arm around her body. He drew her to the chair placed by the side of
the wall. His left hand played with the knife at his belt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marta, little sweetheart,&rdquo; he said mockingly, &ldquo;you must
pay for that blow. Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; he went on, as he drew the
knife across his leather breeches. &ldquo;A little scratch across your cheek,
so! It is but the brand of your master, a love-token from Jos&eacute;. Steady,
now, little Maverick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl struggled violently, but Jos&eacute; was strong, such brawls were
common, and those of the company who noticed at all, merely laughed at the
girl&rsquo;s futile struggles. Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s arm was already raised with
the knife in his hand, when a sudden blow brought a yell of pain to his lips.
The knife fell clattering to the floor. He sprang up, his eyes red with fury. A
man had entered the door from behind and was standing within a few feet of him,
a man with long, pale face, dark eyes, travel-stained, and with the air of a
fugitive. A flood of incoherent abuse streamed from Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s lips.
He stooped for the knife. Marta threw herself upon him. The two cowboys who had
been dancing suddenly intervened. The girls screamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s fault!&rdquo; Marta cried.
&ldquo;Jos&eacute; was mad. He would have killed me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig faced them all with sudden courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I came in,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;that man had his knife
raised to stab the girl. You don&rsquo;t allow that sort of thing, do you,
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two cowboys linked their arms through Jos&eacute;&rsquo;s and led him
off towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stranger&rsquo;s right, Jos&eacute;,&rdquo; one of them insisted.
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t carve a girl up in company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl clutched at Craig&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down here, please,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She disappeared for a moment and came back with a glass full of wine, which
she set down on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drink this,&rdquo; she invited. &ldquo;And thank you for saving
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig emptied the glass eagerly. He was beginning to be more than a little
conscious of his fatigue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just happened to be the first to see him,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;They aren&rsquo;t quite wild enough to allow that here, are
they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quien sabe? The girls do not like me! The men do not care,&rdquo; she
declared. &ldquo;Jos&eacute; took me by surprise, though, or I would have
killed him. But who are you, and where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just crossed the border,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>She nodded understandingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were they after you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! with a warrant for my arrest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She patted his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are safe now,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;We care that much for
a United States warrant,&rdquo; and she snapped her slim fingers. &ldquo;You
shall stay with us for a time. We will take care of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;there will be trouble. Wherever I go
there is trouble. I have been round the world looking for peace. I shall never
find it in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes filled with tears. There was something hopelessly pathetic in his
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall find it here,&rdquo; she promised.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Back in the camp, a spirit of deviltry had entered once more into Long Jim
and his mates. A tactless remark on the part of one of the deputies had set
alight once more the smouldering fire of resentment which the cowboys had all
the time felt against them. At a word from Long Jim they were taken by surprise
and again tied to the wagon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These guys ain&rsquo;t got a sufficiency yet, boys. Limber up them
guns again. Same order as before. Put a few more petals on them flowers, and
I&rsquo;ll trim their eyelashes for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deputies spluttered with rage and fear. Shots rained about them and the
canvas of the wagon was riddled. French began to get restless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said to Laura, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand this
any longer. It don&rsquo;t seem right to have two officers of the law treated
like that, any way. I guess I&rsquo;ll have to butt in again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Laura advised bluntly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get
yours if you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A yell from one of the deputies clinched the matter. French drew his
revolver and advanced into the centre of the little group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you fellows,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve got to
stop this! Those men came here on a legitimate errand and it&rsquo;s your duty
to respect them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long Jim strolled up to the Inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;re right, Mr. French,&rdquo; he remarked,
&ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a swoop of his long arm he snatched French&rsquo;s gun away, examined
it for a moment, looked at French and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too fat, Inspector,&rdquo; he declared sorrowfully,
&ldquo;still too fat. That&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter with you. Another
ten minutes&rsquo; exercise will do you all the good in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bullet struck the dust a few inches from French&rsquo;s feet. Furious with
rage, he found himself once more forced to resort to undignified antics. This
time, however, Laura intervened. She walked straight up into the little circle
and stood close to French&rsquo;s side, regardless of the levelled guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, Long Jim, or whatever your name is,&rdquo; she protested,
&ldquo;you just call your crowd off and stop this. Undo those two deputies. A
joke&rsquo;s a joke, but this has gone far enough. If you don&rsquo;t untie
them, I will. Take your choice and get a move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long Jim scratched his chin for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I guess that what the lady says goes. We
ain&rsquo;t often favoured with ladies&rsquo; society, boys, and I guess when
we are we&rsquo;d better do as we are told. Turn &rsquo;em loose,
boys.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They abandoned the sport a little reluctantly. Suddenly they all paused to
listen. The sound of a horse&rsquo;s slow footfall was heard close at hand.
Presently Quest appeared out of the shadows, carrying Lenora in his arms. Laura
rushed forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Is she hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest laid her tenderly upon the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had a spill at the bridge,&rdquo; he explained quickly. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know whether Craig loosened the supports. He got over all right,
but it went down under Lenora, who was following, and I had to get her out of
the river. Where&rsquo;s the Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor came ambling down from the tent where he had been lying. He
stooped at once over Lenora&rsquo;s still unconscious form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Dear me! Come, come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed his hand over her side and made a brief examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four ribs broken,&rdquo; he pronounced. &ldquo;It will be a week, at
any rate, before we are able to move her. Nothing more serious, so far as I can
see, Mr. Quest, but she&rsquo;ll need rest and all the comfort we can give
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s too bad!&rdquo; Long Jim declared. &ldquo;If
you&rsquo;ve got to stay around for a time, though, you can have the tents. We
boys can double up anywhere, or bunk on the ground. That&rsquo;s right,
ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he added, turning around to the cowboys.</p>
<p>There was a little grunt of acquiescence. They carried Lenora to the largest
of the tents and made her as comfortable as possible. She opened her eyes on
the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am so sorry,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just my side.
It&mdash;hurts. How did I get out of the stream?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fished you out,&rdquo; Quest whispered. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk
now. We are going to make you comfortable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She pressed his hand and closed her eyes again. The Professor returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make the young lady comfortable all right,&rdquo; he
assured them cheerfully, &ldquo;but there&rsquo;s one thing you can make up
your minds to. We are here for a week at the least.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all looked at one another. The Inspector was the only one who preserved
an air of cheerfulness, and he was glancing towards Laura.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;ll have to make the best of it,&rdquo; he
murmured.</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">The girl drew a low stool over to Craig&rsquo;s side. He was
sitting in a rough chair tilted back against the adobe wall of the saloon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As tired as ever?&rdquo; she asked, laying her hand upon his for a
moment.</p>
<p>He turned his head and looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Always tired,&rdquo; he answered listlessly.</p>
<p>She made a little grimace.</p>

<p class="caption">Marta tries to make friends with Craig.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>&ldquo;But you are so strange,&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;Over the hills
there are the steam cars. They would take you to some of our beautiful cities
where all is light and gaiety. You are safe here, whatever your troubles may
have been. You say that you have money, and if you are lonely,&rdquo; she
added, dropping her voice, &ldquo;you need not go alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He patted her hand affectionately but there was something a little forced
about the action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is so hard to make you understand. I
might lose myself for a few minutes, it is true, over yonder. Perhaps,
even,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you might help me to forget. And then there would
be the awakening. That is always the same. Sometimes at night I sleep, and when
I sleep I rest, and when my eyes are opened in the morning the weight comes
back and sits upon my heart, and the strength seems to pass from my limbs and
the will from my brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes were soft and her voice shook a little as she leaned towards him.
Something in his helplessness had kindled the protective spirit in her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has life been so terrible for you?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Have
you left behind&mdash;but no! you never could have been really wicked. You are
not very old, are you? Why do you not stand up and be a man? If you have done
wrong, then very likely people have done wrong things to you. Why should you
brood over these memories? Why&mdash;&hellip; What are you looking at? Who are
these people?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor, with Quest and Long Jim, suddenly appeared round the corner
of the building. They walked towards Craig. He shrank back in his place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If these are your enemies,&rdquo; the girl cried fiercely,
&ldquo;remember that they cannot touch you here. I&rsquo;ll have the boys out
in a minute, if they dare to try it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig struggled to his feet. He made no answer. His eyes were fixed upon the
Professor&rsquo;s. The girl passed her arm through his and dragged him into the
saloon. They passed Jos&eacute; in the doorway. He scoffed at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, the boss will fire you, Marta, if you waste all your time with
that Yankee,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Marta drew the red rose from the bosom of her dress and placed it in
Craig&rsquo;s buttonhole. Then she led him without a word to a seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If these men try any tricks in here,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;ll be trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost at that moment they all three entered. Long Jim nodded to Craig in
friendly fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, cookie,&rdquo; he told them. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
you look so scared. This is just a bit of parley-vous business, that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor held out a piece of paper. He handed it over to Craig.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;this is a dispatch which I found
in Allguez with my letters. It is addressed to you, but under the circumstances
you will scarcely wonder that I opened it. You had better read it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig accepted the cable-form and read it through slowly to
himself:&mdash;</p>
<p class="quote"><tt>TO JOHN CRAIG, C/O PROFESSOR LORD ASHLEIGH, YONKERS, NEW
YORK: YOUR SISTER DIED TO-DAY. HER DAUGHTER MARY SAILS ON TUESDAY TO JOIN YOU
IN NEW YORK. PLEASE MEET HER. COMPTON, SOLICITOR, LONDON.</tt></p>
<p>Craig sat for a moment as though stunned. The girl leaned over towards
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they trying to take you on a warrant?&rdquo; she whispered.
&ldquo;Remember you don&rsquo;t need to go unless you want to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is something quite different,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;Leave
me for a moment, Marta. I must talk to these people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slipped regretfully away from his side and out into the darkness. He sat
with his eyes fixed upon the cablegram. Then he turned towards Quest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fate seems to be too strong for me,&rdquo; he admitted. &ldquo;Leave
me alone and I promise you that I&rsquo;ll go at once to New York, settle
Mary&rsquo;s future, and then make a full disclosure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim touched him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he told him, &ldquo;you ain&rsquo;t no call to leave
here unless you want to. Those deputies don&rsquo;t go this side of the border.
You&rsquo;re safe as long as you like to stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig nodded gratefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I fear that I must
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor coughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure, Craig,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;that you have decided
wisely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig looked gloomily away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing else for me to do,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The child
must be met and looked after. Besides, I am sick of it all. You may as well
know the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not now?&rdquo; Quest suggested softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In New York,&rdquo; Craig replied, &ldquo;and not before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest and the Professor exchanged meaning glances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; the former decided, turning away, &ldquo;in a week
from to-day, Craig, I shall expect you to report at the Professor&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They left the room together. Long Jim lingered by Craig&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those guys have been scaring you some, I guess,&rdquo; he remarked.
&ldquo;Forget &rsquo;em, cookie. They can&rsquo;t touch you here. Of course, if
you go to New York it&rsquo;s your own show.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; Craig replied gloomily.</p>
<p>One of the girls passed her arm through Long Jim&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one dance,&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>He hesitated, looking out of the window. Then he shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired of those guys,&rdquo; he remarked to Craig with a
grin. &ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll stay here for a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig was left alone for a few minutes. Suddenly Marta glided in and sat by
his side. Her eyes were flashing with anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know what they said, those two, as they passed out?&rdquo; she
whispered hoarsely. &ldquo;I heard them. They are going to board the
eight-thirty train to-morrow morning. The dark man turned and said to the
other&mdash;&lsquo;If he is not on that, we&rsquo;ll wait till we find him.
Once we get him in New York, he&rsquo;s our man.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little exclamation of anger broke from Craig&rsquo;s lips. The girl caught
at his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go. There are
plenty of places near here where you can hide, where we could go together and
live quite simply. I&rsquo;d work for you. Take me away from this, somewhere
over the hills. Don&rsquo;t go to New York. They are cruel, those men. They are
hunting you&mdash;I can see it in their faces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig shook his head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little girl,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I should like to go with you
along that valley and over the hills and forget that I had ever lived in any
other world. But I can&rsquo;t do it. There&rsquo;s a child there now, on the
ocean, nearer to New York every day, my sister&rsquo;s own child and no one to
meet her. And&mdash;there are the other things. I have sinned and I must
pay&hellip;. My God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The room suddenly rang with Marta&rsquo;s shriek. Through the open window by
which they were sitting, an arm wrapped in a serape had suddenly hovered over
them. Craig, in starting back, had just escaped the downward blow of the knife,
which had buried itself in Marta&rsquo;s arm. She fell back, screaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jos&eacute;!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;The brute! The
beast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig swung to his feet, furious. Long Jim, cursing fiercely, drew his gun.
At that moment the door of the saloon was thrown open. Jos&eacute; came reeling
in, his serape over his shoulder, a drunken grin on his face. He staggered
towards them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jos&eacute;, you beast!&rdquo; the girl called out, and fell back,
fainting.</p>
<p>There was the sound of a revolver shot and Jos&eacute; reeled backwards and
fell with a cry across the sanded floor. Jim thrust his smoking gun into his
belt and caught Craig by the arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, we&rsquo;d better get out of this, cookie!&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p>They were hustled out. Apparently Jos&eacute; was unpopular, for every one
seemed only anxious to have them clear away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you into the camp quietly,&rdquo; Long Jim muttered.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be safer there for the night. Then you can make that
eighty-thirty in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Lenora, with her bed dragged to the opening of the tent, eagerly greeted the
little party on their return. Quest at once came and sat by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Laura,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;and the
Inspector?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled and pointed to the rising ground behind them. In the faint
moonlight two forms were just visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Inspector isn&rsquo;t taking &lsquo;no&rsquo; for an
answer,&rdquo; Lenora remarked cheerfully, &ldquo;and honestly, if you ask me,
I believe that Laura is weakening a little. She pretended she didn&rsquo;t want
to go out for a walk, and mumbled something about leaving me, but she soon
changed her mind when the Inspector pressed her. They have been up there for an
hour or more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;French has got it bad,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;almost as badly as
I have, Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed at him. Her face was a little drawn with pain but her eyes were
very soft.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you have it very badly,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>He held her hand for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you know,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>As they talked they heard the coyotes barking in the distance. Presently
Laura and the Inspector returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice sort of nurse I am,&rdquo; the former grumbled.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all the fault of this man. He would keep me out there talking
rubbish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were watching you, dear,&rdquo; Lenora said quietly.
&ldquo;Somehow it didn&rsquo;t seem to us that you were particularly anxious to
get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one for Miss Laura,&rdquo; he declared, with an air of
satisfaction. &ldquo;Little bit hard on me generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m all right if I&rsquo;m left alone,&rdquo; Laura
retorted, bustling around. &ldquo;Come along, you folks, if we are going to
have any supper to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat round the opening before Lenora&rsquo;s tent till the moon was high
in the heavens. Quest, who had been on the outside of the circle for some
little time, suddenly rose to his feet and crossed over to the cook wagon. Long
Jim, who was sitting on the steps, glanced up a little surlily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s inside there?&rdquo; Quest asked.</p>
<p>Long Jim removed his pipe from his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That don&rsquo;t sound none too civil a question for a guest,&rdquo;
he remarked, &ldquo;but if you want to know, our new Chinese cookie is
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry if I seemed abrupt,&rdquo; he apologised. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
been very good to us and I&rsquo;m sure we are uncommonly obliged to you, Jim.
The only reason I asked the question was that I saw a face in the door there
and it gave me a start. For a moment I thought it was Craig back
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to New York, or going to-morrow morning,&rdquo; Jim
replied. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;s so powerful fond of your company
that he&rsquo;d come round here looking for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest strolled off again and glanced at his watch as he rejoined the little
group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll turn in. Seven
o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning, Inspector. Jim&rsquo;s sending one of the boys
with us and we shall catch the Eastern Limited at the junction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector yawned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This open-air life makes me sleepy,&rdquo; he confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To bed, all of us,&rdquo; Quest concluded, turning away.</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<p class="first">Quest awoke the next morning, stretched out his hand and
glanced at the watch by the side of his bed. It was barely six o&rsquo;clock.
He turned over and dozed again, looked again at half-past six, and finally, at
a few minutes to seven, rose and made a hasty toilet. Then, in the act of
placing his watch in his waistcoat pocket, he gave a sudden start. By its side,
half covered by the handkerchief which he had thrown upon the little table,
stood a small black box! For a moment he was motionless. Then he stretched out
his hand, removed the lid and drew out the usual neatly folded piece of
paper:&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;Even time fights you. It loses that you may lose.</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;The Hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest for a moment was puzzled. Then he hurried into the next tent, where
the Professor was sleeping peacefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Professor, what&rsquo;s the time by your watch?&rdquo; Quest
asked, shaking him gently.</p>
<p>The Professor sat up and drew his chronometer from under his pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;five minutes past,
maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That seems all right,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll explain
later, Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hurried out into French&rsquo;s tent and found the Inspector just drawing
on his shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;French, what&rsquo;s the time?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three minutes past seven, or thereabouts,&rdquo; French replied,
yawning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming right along. We&rsquo;ve lots of time.
Three-quarters of an hour ought to do it, the boys say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest held out a strip of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gave me a turn,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;I found it in a
black box by the side of my bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>French gazed at it in a puzzled manner. They walked outside to the camp,
where the cowboys were finishing their breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, boss,&rdquo; one of them called out, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not
making that eight-thirty train to New York?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; Quest asked quickly. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only three
quarters of an hour&rsquo;s ride, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; the other replied, &ldquo;but as it&rsquo;s eight
now, your chances ain&rsquo;t looking lively. Kind of overslept, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men glanced once more at their watches. Then Quest thrust his back with
a little oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our watches have been set back!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;The Hands
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment they looked at one another, dumbfounded. Then Quest moved
towards the corral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, is there any quicker way to the depot?&rdquo; he enquired of the
cowboys.</p>
<p>They heard his question indifferently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty dollars,&rdquo; Quest continued, &ldquo;to any one who can take
me by a quicker route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of them rose slowly to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Waal,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;fifty dollars would come in kind of
handy. Yes, I reckon I can cut off a mile or two for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fifty dollars for you, then,&rdquo; Quest replied, as they hurried
towards the horses, &ldquo;and an extra ten if we make the train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They galloped off into the distance. The cowboys finished their breakfast
and went off to their work. Laura stole out from her tent and started off in
rather a shame-faced manner for a ride. Presently Lenora opened her eyes. She,
too, stretched out her hand for her watch. Suddenly she sat up in bed with a
little exclamation. On the table by her side was a small black box. She took
off the lid with trembling fingers, drew out a scrap of paper and
read:&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;Fools! Tongues of flame will cross Quest&rsquo;s path.
He will never reach the depot alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora glanced at Laura&rsquo;s empty bed. Then she staggered to the opening
of the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>There was no one there. The cowboys had all gone to their work, Laura had
passed out of sight across the ridge in the distance. Lenora staggered to the
cook wagon, where the Chinese cook was sitting cleaning plates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;They are in danger, the three men
who have gone off to the depot! If you&rsquo;ll ride after them, I will give
you a hundred dollars. Give them this,&rdquo; she added, holding out the scrap
of paper.</p>
<p>The Chinaman shook his head. He glanced at the slip of paper indifferently
and went on with his work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can ride, missee,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Lenora looked around helplessly. The camp was empty. She staggered across
towards her own horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and help me,&rdquo; she ordered.</p>
<p>The Chinaman came unwillingly. They found her saddle but he only gazed at it
in a stolid sort of fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No can fix,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Missee no can ride. Better go back
bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora pushed him on one side. With a great effort she managed to reach her
place in the saddle. Then she turned and, with her face to the depot, galloped
away. The pain was excruciating. She could only keep herself in the saddle with
an effort. Yet all the time that one sentence was ringing in her
mind&mdash;&ldquo;Tongues of flame!&rdquo; She kept looking around anxiously.
Suddenly the road dropped from a little decline. She was conscious of a wave of
heat. In the distance she could see the smoke rolling across the open. She
touched her horse with the quirt. The spot which she must pass to keep on the
track to the depot was scarcely a hundred yards ahead, but already the fire
seemed to be running like quicksilver across the ground licking up the dry
greasewood with indeed a flaming tongue. She glanced once behind, warned by the
heat. The fire was closing in upon her. A puff of smoke suddenly enveloped her.
She coughed. Her head began to swim and a fit of giddiness assailed her. She
rocked in her saddle and the pony came to a sudden standstill, faced by the
mass of rolling smoke and flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sanford!&rdquo; Lenora cried. &ldquo;Save me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pony reared. She slipped from the saddle and fell across the track.</p>
<h2><a name="ch15" id="ch15"></a>XV.&mdash;&rdquo;A BOLT FROM THE
BLUE&rdquo;</h2>
<h3>1.</h3>
<p class="first">There was a peculiar, almost a foreboding silence about the
camp that morning when Laura returned from her early ride. The only living
person to be seen was the Chinaman, sitting on a stool in front of the wagon,
with a dish of potatoes between his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, where&rsquo;s every one?&rdquo; Laura sung out, after she had
looked into Lenora&rsquo;s tent and found it empty.</p>
<p>The Chinaman continued to peel potatoes. He took no notice of the question.
Laura touched her horse with the whip and cantered over to his side. At the
last moment the animal swerved a little. The Chinaman, trying to draw back
hastily, let the bowl slip between his knees. He gazed at the broken pieces of
the dish in dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind your silly potatoes!&rdquo; Laura exclaimed. &ldquo;Tell
me where every one&rsquo;s gone to, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Chinaman looked up at her malevolently. He rose and made a stealthy
movement forward. Laura backed her horse. The purpose which had gleamed for a
moment in the man&rsquo;s narrowed eyes seemed to fade away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All gone,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Cowboy gone workee. Missee gone
hurry up find Mr. Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura hesitated, puzzled. Just then the Professor came cantering in with a
bundle of grass in his hand. He glanced down at the Chinaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Miss Laura!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem
to be getting on with our friend here,&rdquo; he added in an undertone.
&ldquo;If you would permit me to offer you just a word of advice, it really
doesn&rsquo;t pay to annoy these Chinese too much. They never forget. I
didn&rsquo;t like the way that fellow was looking at you. I was watching him
all the way from the rise there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Who cares what a Chink thinks! The
fellow&rsquo;s an idiot. I&rsquo;m worried, Professor. Lenora&rsquo;s gone out
after Mr. Quest and the Inspector. She wasn&rsquo;t fit to ride a horse. I
can&rsquo;t make out why she&rsquo;s attempted it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor unslung some field-glasses from his shoulder and gazed
steadily southward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just possible,&rdquo; he said softly, &ldquo;that she may have
received a warning of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed with his forefinger, and Laura peered forward. Something which
seemed to be just a faint cloud hung over the horizon. The Professor handed her
his glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a fire!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>The Professor nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a prairie fire,&rdquo; he replied,&mdash;&ldquo;very dangerous,
though, these dry seasons. The flames move so quickly that if you happen to be
in a certain position you might easily get cut off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura turned her horse round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, Professor!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what it
is. Lenora&rsquo;s gone to try and warn the others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is a very brave young lady,&rdquo; the Professor declared, as he
touched his pony with the spurs. &ldquo;All the same, Miss Laura, you take my
advice and leave that Chinaman alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rode to the very edge of the tract of country which was temporarily
enveloped with smoke and flame. Here they pulled in their horses, and the
Professor looked thoughtfully through his field-glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The road straight on is the ordinary way to the depot,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;but, as you can see, at the bend there it is becoming almost
impassable. The thing is, what did Lenora do? When she got as far as this, she
must have seen that further progress was dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura gave a little cry and pointed with her riding-whip. About twenty yards
further on, by the side of the road, was a small white object. She cantered on,
swung herself from her horse and picked it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora&rsquo;s handkerchief!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>The Professor waved his arm westward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here come Quest and the Inspector. They are making a circuit to avoid
the fire. The cowboy with them must have shown them the way. We&rsquo;d better
hurry up and find out if they&rsquo;ve seen anything of Miss Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They galloped across the rough country towards the little party, who were
now clearly in sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora isn&rsquo;t with them,&rdquo; Laura declared anxiously,
&ldquo;and look&mdash;what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the centre of one of the burning patches they saw a riderless horse
gallop out, stop for a moment with his head almost between its fore-legs, shake
himself furiously, and gallop blindly on again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lenora&rsquo;s horse!&rdquo; Laura cried. &ldquo;She must
have been thrown. Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura would have turned her horse, but the Professor checked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us wait for Quest,&rdquo; he advised. &ldquo;They are close
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cowboy, riding a little behind the two others, had unlimbered his
lariat, and, while they watched, swung it over his head and secured the
runaway. Quest galloped up to where Laura and the Professor were waving
frantically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that&rsquo;s some fire!&rdquo; Quest exclaimed. &ldquo;Did you
people come out to see it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, we came to find Lenora!&rdquo; Laura answered breathlessly.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s her horse. She started to meet you. She must be
somewhere&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora?&rdquo; Quest interrupted fiercely. &ldquo;What do you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I got back to the camp,&rdquo; Laura continued rapidly,
&ldquo;there wasn&rsquo;t a soul there except the Chinaman. He told me that
Lenora had ridden off a few minutes before to find you. We came to look for
her. We found her handkerchief on the road there, and that&rsquo;s her
horse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest did not wait for another word. He jumped a rough bush of scrub on the
right-hand side, galloped over the ground, which was already hot with the
coming fire, and followed along down the road by which Lenora had passed. When
he came to the first bend, he could hear the roar of flames in the trees. A
volume of smoke almost blinded him; his horse became wholly unmanageable. He
slipped from the saddle and ran on, staggering from right to left like a
drunken man. About forty yards along the road, Lenora was lying in the dust. A
volume of smoke rushed over her. The tree under which she had collapsed was
already afire. A twig fell from it as Quest staggered up, and her skirt began
to smoulder. He tore off his coat, wrapped it around her, beat out the fire
which was already blazing at her feet, and snatched her into his arms. She
opened her eyes for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;The fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Quest shouted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be
out of it in a moment. Hold tight to my neck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He braced himself for a supreme effort and ran along the pathway. His feet
were blistered with the heat; there was a great burn on one of his arms. At
last, however, he passed out of the danger zone and staggered up to where the
Professor, the Inspector and Laura were waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, that was a close shave,&rdquo; he faltered, as he laid Lenora
upon the ground. &ldquo;Another five minutes&mdash;well, we won&rsquo;t talk
about it. Let&rsquo;s lift her on to your horse, Laura, and get back to the
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>2.</h3>
<p class="first">The Professor laid down his book and gazed with an amiable
smile towards Quest and Lenora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; he remarked dolefully, &ldquo;that my little treatise
on the fauna of the Northern Orinoco scarcely appeals to you, Mr.
Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest, whose arm was in a sling but who was otherwise none the worse for his
recent adventure, pointed out of the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it, Professor,&rdquo; he begged.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been listening to every word. But say, Lenora, just look at
Laura and French!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all three peered anxiously out of the opening of the tent. Laura and
the Inspector were very slowly approaching the cook wagon. Laura was carrying a
large bunch of wild flowers, one of which she was in the act of fastening in
French&rsquo;s buttonhole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That fellow French has got grit,&rdquo; Quest declared. &ldquo;He
sticks to it all the time. He&rsquo;ll win out with Laura in the end, you mark
my words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he will,&rdquo; Lenora said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s a dear girl,
although she has got an idea into her head that she hates men and love-making.
I think the Inspector&rsquo;s just the man for her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two had paused outside the cook wagon. Laura held out the flowers to the
Chinaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you find me a bowl for these?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He looked slowly up at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No bowlee for flowers,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;All want for
eatee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura leaned over and shook him by the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll eatee off the ground,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Give
me a bowl, you slant-eyed old idiot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you obey the lady?&rdquo; French intervened.</p>
<p>Very slowly the Chinaman rose to his feet, disappeared inside the cook wagon
and reappeared with a basin, which he handed to Laura. She thanked him
carelessly, and they passed on. From where they stood, both Quest and Lenora
saw the look which for a moment flashed from the Chinaman&rsquo;s eyes. Lenora
shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be glad when we get away from here,&rdquo; she declared,
clinging to Quest&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;That Chinaman hates Laura like poison,
and I&rsquo;m afraid of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does seem to have put his back up,&rdquo; he agreed. &ldquo;As to
going on, I think we might just as well move tomorrow. My arm&rsquo;s all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m quite well,&rdquo; Lenora asserted eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve wired for them to meet Craig,&rdquo; Quest said. &ldquo;I
only hope they don&rsquo;t let him slip through their fingers. I haven&rsquo;t
much faith in his promise to turn up at the Professor&rsquo;s. Let&rsquo;s see
what Laura and French have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t see any sense in staying on here any longer,&rdquo; was
French&rsquo;s immediate decision, &ldquo;so long as you two invalids feel that
you can stand the journey. Besides, we&rsquo;re using up these fellows&rsquo;
hospitality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get everything in order to-night,&rdquo; Laura decided,
&ldquo;and start first thing to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They busied themselves for the next hour or two in making preparations.
After their evening meal, the two men walked with Lenora and Laura to their
tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you girls had better go to bed,&rdquo; Quest suggested.
&ldquo;Try and get a long night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all very well,&rdquo; French remarked, &ldquo;but
it&rsquo;s only eight o&rsquo;clock. What about a stroll, Miss Laura, just up
to the ridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura hesitated for a moment and glanced towards Lenora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please go,&rdquo; the latter begged. &ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t feel
like going to sleep just yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look after Lenora,&rdquo; Quest promised. &ldquo;You have
your walk. There&rsquo;s the Professor sitting outside his tent. Wouldn&rsquo;t
you like to take him with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laura glanced indignantly at him as they strolled out, and Lenora laughed
softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How dared you suggest such a thing!&rdquo; she murmured to Quest.
&ldquo;Do look at them. The Inspector wants her to take his watch, and she
can&rsquo;t quite make up her mind about it. Why, Laura&rsquo;s getting
positively frivolous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess we&rsquo;d better not watch them any longer,&rdquo; Quest
decided. &ldquo;What about a game of bezique?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should love it!&rdquo; Lenora assented. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find
the cards in that satchel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat and played for half an hour by the light of a lantern. Suddenly
Quest paused in the act of dealing and glanced over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the mischief was that?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounded as though the tent flapped,&rdquo; Lenora replied.</p>
<p>Quest rose, and with the lantern in his hand walked to the other side of the
tent. The flap was open, but there was no sign of any one in sight. He looked
around and came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer thing!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It sounded just as though
some one had pulled the flap of the tent back. The flap&rsquo;s open, but there
isn&rsquo;t a soul in sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect it was fancy,&rdquo; Lenora remarked. &ldquo;Still, there
isn&rsquo;t a breath of wind, is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest returned to his place, and they recommenced the game. Just at that
moment the entrance to the tent was lifted and Laura ran in. She plumped down
upon her bed with her hands on either side of her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that man&mdash;&rdquo; she began.</p>
<p>Suddenly she sprang up with a little cry which turned almost into a scream.
From a look of humorous indignation, her face suddenly assumed an expression of
absolute terror. She shrank away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something soft in the bed!&rdquo; she shrieked.
&ldquo;I felt it with my hand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all looked towards the cot. Quest held up the lantern. They distinctly
saw a movement under the bedclothes. The Inspector, stooping down, suddenly
entered the tent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s wrong here?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something in Laura&rsquo;s bed,&rdquo; Quest muttered.
&ldquo;Here, give me the camp-stool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stole towards the bed, gripping the camp-stool firmly with his right
hand, and slowly turning down the bedclothes with the feet of the chair.
Suddenly there was a piercing scream. A huge snake, coiled and quivering for
the spring, lifted its head. Even Quest seemed for the moment nerveless. Then
from the doorway came the sharp report of a revolver, and the snake fell, a
limp, inert thing. They all looked at the Professor as though fascinated. He
came a step farther into the tent, the revolver still smoking in his hand.
Standing over the snake, he deliberately fired again and again into the
body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he remarked, in his usual calm tones, &ldquo;that we
may consider the creature now beyond any power of doing harm. You will be
interested to hear,&rdquo; he continued, bending over the remains of the
creature, &ldquo;that this is an exceedingly rare species, a sort of second
cousin to the rattlesnake found only in this part of the world and fatally
poisonous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how could it have got there?&rdquo; Lenora faltered.</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that there can be no doubt about
that. I saw the Chinaman whom Laura is so fond of sneaking away from this tent
a few minutes ago, and I suspected some devilry. That is why I went and fetched
my revolver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a roar of anger from French. He snatched the weapon from the
Professor&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill that yellow dog!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Where is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He dashed across the open space towards the camp wagon. His teeth were set,
and there was murder in his blazing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that Chinaman?&rdquo; he yelled at the top of his
voice.</p>
<p>The cowboys struggled to their feet. The Chinaman, who was sitting inside
the cook wagon, poring over a book by the light of a lantern, recognised the
note of fury in French&rsquo;s tone and raised his head, startled. A paroxysm
of fear seized him. The very moment that French threw open the door of the
wagon, he kicked the lantern across the floor and plunged at the canvas sides
of the vehicle, slipping underneath until he reached the ground. French, left
in darkness, groped around for a moment and then emerged. The cowboys had
gathered together outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, Mr. Inspector French,&rdquo; one of them demanded,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s wrong with John Chinaman? You folks seem to have a sort of
grudge against our cooks. What&rsquo;s the Oriental been doing, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried to commit a filthy murder,&rdquo; French shouted.
&ldquo;Brought a snake and put it into the bed of one of the young
women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hesitated no longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; one of them cried. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to
see this matter through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found the spot where the Chinaman had escaped from the wagon, but even
at that moment they heard the sound of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs and saw a flying
figure in the distance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said he couldn&rsquo;t ride!&rdquo; French shouted. &ldquo;Told the
young lady so when she wanted him to go and warn us of the fire. Look at him
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, all of you,&rdquo; one of the cowboys yelled, as they rushed
for the horse. &ldquo;Bring your lariats. We&rsquo;ll have him,
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>French, with his start, was the first to reach a horse. The cowboys galloped
off through the shadows. Dimly visible, they now and then caught a glimpse of
their quarry; sometimes he faded out of sight altogether.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have him through that patch of brush,&rdquo; Long Jim
shouted. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t dare to ride the pace there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They saw him for a moment bending low over his horse, but they did not see
him slip easily from its back, roll over into the brushwood, and lie there
concealed. They heard the thunder of hoofs ahead, and they galloped by. When
they were out of sight, the Chinaman stole away into the darkness. Nearly an
hour later, the little party caught up with the riderless horse. The language
of the cowboys was picturesque.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spread out, boys. We&rsquo;ll round him up going back, if we
can,&rdquo; Long Jim directed. &ldquo;If he was spilled off, we&rsquo;ll get
him, sure. But if the dirty coyote has tricked us and slipped off into the
brush, it&rsquo;s good night. We&rsquo;ll never find him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>French&rsquo;s hand tightened upon his revolver, and his eyes pierced the
darkness to right and to left as he rode slowly back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;ll be no trial if I can get the drop on him,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p>Away in the distance, John Chinaman was reaching Allguez, and the little
party of cowboys rode into the camp without having seen a sign of him. French
was narrating his failure to the three others, when Quest in silence handed him
a cablegram, a messenger had just brought.</p>
<p class="quote"><tt>TO INSPECTOR FRENCH, ALLGUEZ, N.M. VERY SORRY. CRAIG GAVE
US SLIP AFTER LEAVING DEPOT. NIECE DISAPPEARED FROM ADDRESS GIVEN. NO CLUES AT
PRESENT. WHEN ARE YOU RETURNING?</tt></p>
<p>French swore softly for a moment. Then he dropped into a chair,
exhausted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;is our unlucky evening.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>3.</h3>
<p class="first">The woman who had just laid the cloth for a homely evening
meal, smiled across at the girl who stood at the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all ready now directly your uncle comes home,&rdquo; she
announced. &ldquo;Say, you never seem to tire of looking out of that
window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned around with a smile. She was very young and dressed in deep
mourning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen anything like it before, Mrs. Malony,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;It was quite quiet where we lived in London, and here, with
the street cars and the elevated railways and the clanging of bells, there
never seems to be a moment&rsquo;s peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Malony came to the girl&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your poor uncle looks as though a little peace would do him
good,&rdquo; she remarked.</p>
<p>The girl sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could do something for him!&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s in some kind of trouble, I think,&rdquo; Mrs. Malony
observed. &ldquo;He is not what you might call a communicative person, but
it&rsquo;s easy to see that he is far from being happy in himself. You&rsquo;ll
ring when you&rsquo;re ready, Miss Mary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was suddenly opened, and Craig entered. He was very pale and a
little out of breath. Before he closed the door, he listened for a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as we were speaking about you, Mr. Craig,&rdquo; the landlady
continued. &ldquo;I was saying to the young lady that there was only one thing
I could wish for you both, and that was that you weren&rsquo;t quite so worried
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig seemed scarcely to hear her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look across the road,&rdquo; he begged. &ldquo;Tell me if there is a
man in a blue serge suit and a bowler hat, smoking a cigar, looking across
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Malony and the girl both obeyed. The girl was the first to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;He is looking straight at these
windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig groaned and sank down upon a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave us, if you please, Mrs. Malony,&rdquo; he ordered.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ring when I&rsquo;m ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Malony hesitated with the door-knob in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not wishing to say anything that might sound
offensive,&rdquo; she observed slowly, &ldquo;but if it&rsquo;s a case of
trouble of any sort with the police, Mr. Craig&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; Craig interrupted. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t
anything of the sort you think. You are not likely to suffer by having me here,
Mrs. Malony, or by looking after my niece when I have gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlady left the room silently. The girl came over to her uncle and
threw her arm around his neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t talk about going away, uncle,&rdquo; she pleaded.
&ldquo;I have been so happy since I have been with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He patted her head, felt in his pocket, and drew out a little paper bag,
from which he shook a bunch of violets. The girl pinned them to her frock with
a little cry of pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How kind you are to me!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;You think of
everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had had you for a little longer, Mary,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;perhaps I should have been a better man. Go to the window, please, and
tell me if that man is still there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crossed the room with light footsteps. Presently she returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is just crossing the street,&rdquo; she announced. &ldquo;I think
that he seems to be coming here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig took the girl for a minute into his arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, dear,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I want you to take this paper
and keep it carefully. You will be cared for always, but I must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where must you go?&rdquo; she asked bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have an appointment at Professor Ashleigh&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he told
her. &ldquo;I cannot tell you anything more than that. Good-bye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her for a moment passionately. Then suddenly he tore himself away.
She heard him run lightly down the stairs. Some instinct led her to the back
window. She saw him emerge from the house and pass down the yard. Then she went
to the front. The man in the blue serge suit was talking to the landlady below.
She sank into a chair, puzzled and unhappy. Then she heard heavy footsteps. The
door was opened. The man in the blue serge suit entered, followed by the
protesting landlady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no sense in coming here to worry the young lady,&rdquo;
Mrs. Malony declared irritably. &ldquo;As for Mr. Craig, I told you that
he&rsquo;d gone out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone out, eh?&rdquo; the man repeated, speaking in a thick,
disagreeable tone. &ldquo;Why, I watched him in here not ten minutes ago. Now
then, young lady, guess you&rsquo;d better cough up the truth. Where&rsquo;s
this precious uncle of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle has gone out,&rdquo; the girl replied, drawing herself up.
&ldquo;He left five minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sneaked out by the back way, maybe,&rdquo; the man sneered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there was any fear of your stopping to speak to him, I should
think he would,&rdquo; the girl retorted boldly. &ldquo;My uncle is rather
particular about his acquaintances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that in your hand?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something my uncle gave me before he went out,&rdquo; the girl
replied. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t looked at it yet myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it here,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>She spread it out upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may look at it if you choose,&rdquo; she agreed. &ldquo;My uncle
did not tell me not to show it to any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They read it together. The few lines seemed to be written with great care.
They took, indeed, the form of a legal document, to which was affixed the seal
of a notary and the name of a witness.&mdash;</p>
<p class="letter">I, John Craig, being about to receive the just punishment for
all my sins, hereby bequeath to my niece, Mary Carlton, all monies and property
belonging to me, a list of which she will find at this address. I make one
condition only of my bequest and I beg my niece to fervently respect it. It is
that she never of her own consent or knowledge speak to any one of the name of
Ashleigh, or associate with any of that name.</p>
<p class="letter">John Craig.</p>
<p>The man folded up the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
yours, right enough. We&rsquo;ll just need to borrow it for a time. Go and get
your hat and coat on, miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not,&rdquo; the girl objected. &ldquo;My uncle told me, if
anything happened to him, that I was to remain here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And remain here she shall, so long as she likes,&rdquo; Mrs. Malony
insisted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve given my promise, too, to look after her, and Mr.
Craig knows that I am an honest woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be that,&rdquo; the man replied, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s just
as well for you both to understand this. I&rsquo;m from the police, and what I
say goes. No harm will come to the girl, Mrs. Malony, and she shall come back
here, but for the present she is going to accompany me to headquarters. If you
make any trouble, I only have to blow my whistle and I can fill your house with
policemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go,&rdquo; the girl whispered.</p>
<p>In silence she put on her hat and coat, in silence she drove with him to the
police-station, where she was shown at once into an inspector&rsquo;s office.
The man who had brought her whispered for a moment or two with his chief and
handed him the paper. Inspector French read it and whistled softly. He took up
the telephone by his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you&rsquo;ve something of a find here,&rdquo; he remarked to the
plain-clothes man. &ldquo;Put me through to Mr. Quest, please,&rdquo; he added,
speaking into the receiver.</p>
<p>The two men whispered together. The girl stole from her place and turned
over rapidly the pages of a directory which was on the round table before her.
She found the &ldquo;A&rsquo;s&rdquo; quickly. Her eye fell upon the name of
Ashleigh. She repeated the address to herself and glanced around. The two men
were still whispering. For the moment she was forgotten. She stole on tiptoe
across the room, ran down the stone steps, and hastened into the street.</p>
<h3>4.</h3>
<p class="first">The Professor, who was comfortably seated in Quest&rsquo;s
favourite easy-chair, glanced at his watch and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid, my friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that Craig&rsquo;s
nerve has failed him. A voluntary surrender was perhaps too much to hope
for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest smoked for a moment in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t understand those fellows letting him give them the
slip,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;He ought to have been under close surveillance
from the moment he set foot in New York. What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he added,
turning to the door.</p>
<p>His servant entered, bearing a note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This was left a few minutes ago, sir,&rdquo; he announced, &ldquo;by
a messenger boy. There was no answer required.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man retired and Quest unfolded the sheet of paper. His expression
suddenly changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p class="letter">To Sanford Quest.</p>
<p class="letter">Gather your people in Professor Ashleigh&rsquo;s library at
ten o&rsquo;clock to-night. I will be there and tell you my whole story.</p>
<p class="letter">John Craig.</p>
<p>The Professor sat for a moment speechless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he meant it, after all!&rdquo; he exclaimed at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems like it,&rdquo; Quest admitted. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just
telephone to French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor rose to his feet, knocked the ash from his cigar, struggled
into his coat, and took up his hat. Then he waited until Quest had completed
his conversation. The latter&rsquo;s face had grown grave and puzzled. It was
obvious that he was receiving information of some importance. He put down the
instrument at last with a curt word of farewell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me send a couple of men up with you, Professor,&rdquo; he begged.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to run any risk of having Craig there before we
arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is seldom in my life that I have
had to have recourse to physical violence, but I flatter myself that there is
no man who would do me any harm. We will meet, then, at my house. You will
bring the young ladies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;I am just sending word up to them
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Professor moved towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only this may prove to be the end!&rdquo; he sighed.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Quest spent the next hour or so in restless deliberations. There were still
many things which puzzled him. At about a quarter past nine Lenora and Laura
arrived, dressed for their expedition. Quest threw open the window and looked
out across the city. A yellowish haze which, accompanied by a sulphurous heat,
had been brooding over the city all day long, had suddenly increased in
density. The air was stifling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid we are in for a bad thunderstorm, girls,&rdquo;
Quest remarked.</p>
<p>Laura laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who cares? The automobile&rsquo;s there, Mr. Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go, then,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>They descended into the street and drove to the Professor&rsquo;s house in
silence. Even Laura was feeling the strain of these last hours of anxiety. On
the way they picked up French and a plain-clothes man, and the whole party
arrived at their destination just as the storm broke. The Professor met them in
the hall. He, too, seemed to have lost to some extent his customary
equanimity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come this way, my friends,&rdquo; he invited. &ldquo;If Craig keeps
his word, he will be here now within a few minutes. This way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They followed him into the library. Chairs were arranged around the table in
the middle of the room, and they all sat down. The Professor took out his
watch. It was five minutes to ten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a few minutes,&rdquo; he continued solemnly, &ldquo;this weight is
to be lifted from the minds of all of us. I have come to the conclusion that on
this occasion Craig will keep his word. I am not sure, mind, but I believe that
he is in the house at this present moment. I have heard movements in the room
which belonged to him. I have not interfered. I have been content to
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least he has not tried to escape,&rdquo; Quest remarked.
&ldquo;French here brought news of him. He has been living with his niece very
quietly, but without any particular attempt at concealment or any signs of
wishing to leave the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had that girl brought to my office,&rdquo; French remarked,
&ldquo;barely an hour ago, but she slipped away while we were talking. Say,
what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all rose quickly to their feet. In a momentary lull of the storm, they
could hear distinctly a girl&rsquo;s shrill call from outside, followed by the
clamour of angry voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bet that&rsquo;s the girl,&rdquo; French exclaimed.
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been looking up the Professor&rsquo;s address in a
directory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all hurried out into the hall. The plain-clothes man whom they had left
on guard was standing there with his hand upon Craig&rsquo;s collar. The girl,
sobbing bitterly, was clinging to his arm. Craig was making desperate efforts
to escape. Directly he saw the little party issue from the library, however,
the strength seemed to pass from his limbs. He remained in the clutches of his
captor, limp and helpless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I caught the girl trying to make her way into the house,&rdquo; the
latter explained. &ldquo;She called out, and this man came running down-stairs,
right into my arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite all right,&rdquo; the Professor said, in a dignified
tone. &ldquo;You may release them both. Craig was on his way to keep an
appointment here at ten o&rsquo;clock. Quest, will you and the Inspector bring
him in? Let us resume our places at the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little procession made its way down the hall. The girl was still
clinging to her uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they going to do to you, these people?&rdquo; she sobbed.
&ldquo;They shan&rsquo;t hurt you! They shan&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora passed her arm around the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, dear,&rdquo; she said soothingly. &ldquo;Your uncle
has come of his own free will to answer a few questions, only I think it would
be better if you would let me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lenora never finished her sentence. They had reached the entrance now to the
library. The Professor was standing in the doorway with extended hand,
motioning them to take their places at the table. Then, with no form of
warning, the room seemed suddenly filled with a blaze of blue light. It came at
first in a thin flash from the window to the table, became immediately
multiplied a thousand times, and played round the table in sparks which
suddenly expanded to sheets of leaping, curling flame. The roar of thunder
shook the very foundations of the house&mdash;and then silence. For several
seconds not one of them seemed to have the power of speech. An amazing thing
had happened. The oak table in the middle of the room was a charred fragment,
the chairs were every one blackened remnants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thunderbolt!&rdquo; French gasped at last.</p>
<p>Quest was the first to cross the room. From the table to the outside window
was one charred, black line which had burnt its way through the carpet. He
threw open the window. The wire whose course he had followed ended there with a
little lump of queer substance. He broke it off from the end of the wire, which
was absolutely brittle, and brought it into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Lenora faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got there?&rdquo; French echoed.</p>
<p>Quest examined the strange-looking lump of metal steadily. The most curious
thing about it seemed to be that it was absolutely sound and showed no signs of
damage. He turned to the Professor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are the only one who will be able to appreciate this,
Professor,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Look! It is a fragment of opotan&mdash;a
distinct and wonderful specimen of opotan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every one looked puzzled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what,&rdquo; Lenora enquired, &ldquo;is opotan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a new metal,&rdquo; Quest explained gravely, &ldquo;towards
which scientists have been directing a great deal of attention lately. It has
the power of collecting all the electricity from the air around us. There are a
dozen people, at the present moment, conducting experiments with it for the
purpose of cheapening electric lights. If we had been in the room ten seconds
sooner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused significantly. Then he swung round on his heel. Craig, a now
pitiful object, his hands nervously twitching, his face ghastly, was cowering
in the background.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your last little effort, Craig?&rdquo; he demanded sternly.</p>
<p>Craig made no reply. The Professor, who had disappeared for a moment, came
back to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a smaller room across the hall,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;which
will do for our purpose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craig suddenly turned and faced them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have changed my mind,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I have nothing to tell
you. Do what you will with me. Take me to the Tombs, deal with me any way you
choose, but I have nothing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>French smiled a little grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We may make you change your mind when we get you there,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one will ever make me change my mind,&rdquo; the man replied.
&ldquo;This is my last word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest pointed a threatening finger at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your last voluntary word, perhaps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but science
is still your master, Craig. Science has brought many criminals to their doom.
It shall take its turn with you. Bring him along, French, to my study. There is
a way of dealing with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Quest felt his forehead and found it damp. There were dark rims under his
eyes. Before him was Craig, with a little band around his forehead and the
mirror where they could all see it. The Professor stood a little in the
background. Laura and French were side by side, gazing with distended eyes at
the blank mirror, and Lenora was doing her best to soothe the terrified niece.
Twice Quest&rsquo;s teeth came together and once he almost reeled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fight of his life,&rdquo; he muttered at last,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve got him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost as he spoke, they could see Craig&rsquo;s resistance begin to weaken.
The tenseness of his form relaxed; Quest&rsquo;s will was triumphing. Slowly in
the mirror they saw a little picture creeping from outline into definite form,
a picture of the Professor&rsquo;s library. Craig himself was there with mortar
and trowel, and a black box in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming!&rdquo; Lenora moaned.</p>
<p>Quest stood perfectly tense. The picture suddenly flashed into brilliant
clearness. They saw Craig&rsquo;s features with almost lifelike detail. From
the corner of that room where the Professor was standing, came a smothered
groan. It was a terrifying, a paralysing moment. Even the silence seemed
charged with awful things. Then suddenly, without any warning, the picture
faded completely away. A cry which was almost a howl of anger broke from
Quest&rsquo;s lips. Craig had fallen sideways from his chair. There was an
ominous change in his face. Something seemed to have passed from the atmosphere
of the room, some tense and nameless quality. Quest moved forward and laid his
hand on Craig&rsquo;s heart. The girl was on her knees, crying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take her away,&rdquo; Quest whispered to Lenora.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about him?&rdquo; French demanded, as Lenora led the girl from
the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He fought too hard,&rdquo; Quest said gravely. &ldquo;He is dead.
Professor,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all looked around. The spot where he had been standing was empty. The
Professor had gone.</p>
<h2><a name="ch16" id="ch16"></a>XVI.&mdash;JUSTICE CHEATED</h2>
<p class="first">The first shock was over. Craig&rsquo;s body had been removed,
and the girls had taken Mary, half stunned with grief, to their room. French
and Quest were left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is some disappointment,&rdquo; the former remarked gloomily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a disappointment,&rdquo; Quest said slowly, &ldquo;which may
clear the way to bigger things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in your mind now?&rdquo; French enquired.</p>
<p>Quest shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A turmoil. First of all, where is the Professor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have scooted right away home,&rdquo; French suggested. &ldquo;He
was looking pretty sick all the time. Guess it must have been a powerful shock
for him, and he isn&rsquo;t so young as he used to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me that paper of Craig&rsquo;s again,&rdquo; Quest asked,
stretching out his hand.</p>
<p>The Inspector produced the document from his inner pocket, and Quest,
stretching it out upon his knee, read it word for word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never to communicate or to have anything to do with any one of the
name of Ashleigh, eh?&rdquo; he remarked, as he handed it back again.
&ldquo;Rather a queer provision, that, French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been thinking that myself,&rdquo; the Inspector admitted.
&ldquo;Seems to be rather reversing the positions, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest glanced at the clock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you&rsquo;re ready, Inspector,
we&rsquo;ll be getting along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo; French demanded.</p>
<p>Quest looked for a moment surprised. Just then Lenora entered the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going out?&rdquo; she asked Quest.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Inspector and I are going to have a look for that black
box,&rdquo; he told her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you want me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you girls have had as much as is good for you of this sort of
business,&rdquo; he declared grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s all over now,&rdquo; Lenora protested.</p>
<p>Quest buttoned up his coat and motioned to French to follow him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll &rsquo;phone
if we want you, Lenora. We shall be at the Professor&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men drove to the outskirts of the city almost in silence, while
several of the officers followed in another taxi. The Professor&rsquo;s house
seemed more than ever deserted as they drew up at the front door. They entered
without ringing and crossed the hall towards the library. On the threshold
Quest paused and held up his finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one is in there,&rdquo; he whispered, stepping quickly forward.
&ldquo;Come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw open the door. The room was empty, yet both Quest and French were
conscious of a curious conviction that it had been occupied within the last few
seconds. French even shook out the curtains and swung open the doors of a
bureau. There was no sign of anybody, however, nor any evidence as to how they
could have left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer, but it seemed to me I heard some one,&rdquo; French
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure of it,&rdquo; Quest replied, shaking the curtains at the
back of the door.</p>
<p>They stood still for a moment and listened. The silence in the empty house
was almost unnatural. Quest turned away with a shrug of the shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Craig&rsquo;s dying thoughts must
have been truthful. Come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He led the way to the fireplace, went down on his knees and passed his hands
over the bricks. The third one he touched, shook. He tapped it&mdash;without a
doubt it was hollow. With his penknife he loosened the mortar a little and drew
it out easily. The back was open. Inside was the black box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig&rsquo;s secret at last!&rdquo; French muttered hoarsely.
&ldquo;Bring it to the light, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were unemotional men but the moment was supreme. The key to the mystery
of these tragical weeks was there in their hands! Their eyes almost devoured
those few hastily scrawled words buried with so much care:</p>
<p class="letter"><b>See page 62, January number, American Medical Journal
1905.</b></p>
<p>They looked at one another. They repeated vaguely this most commonplace of
messages. As the final result of their strenuous enterprise, these cryptic
words seemed pitifully inadequate. Quest&rsquo;s face darkened. He crumpled the
paper in his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be some meaning in this,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;It
can&rsquo;t be altogether a fool&rsquo;s game we&rsquo;re on. Wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He moved towards a table which usually stood against the wall, but which had
obviously been dragged out recently into the middle of the room. It was covered
with bound volumes. Quest glanced at one and exclaimed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>American Medical Journal, 1905!</i> French, there&rsquo;s
something in this message, after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned over the pages rapidly. Then he came to a stop. Page 60 was there;
page 62 had been neatly removed with a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The Professor&rsquo;s been at
work here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men stood looking at one another across the table. Strange thoughts
were framing themselves in the brains of both of them. Then there came a
startling and in its way a dramatic interlude. Through the empty house came the
ringing of the electric bell from the front door, shrill and insistent. Without
a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, Quest hurried out, and French followed him. On the
door-step was another surprise. Lenora and Laura were there, the former
carrying a small, black-bound volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be cross,&rdquo; she begged quickly. &ldquo;We just had
to come. Look! We picked this up underneath the chair where Craig was sitting.
It must have slipped from his pocket. You see what is written on it? DIARY OF
JOHN CRAIG.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest took it in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ought to be interesting,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Come along
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed into the library. French lingered behind for a moment and caught
up with them just as they were opening the book underneath the electric
lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See what I&rsquo;ve found!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;It was just by
the side of the wall there. Where&rsquo;s that journal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spread out the piece of paper&mdash;it fitted exactly into the empty
space. They all read together:</p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;Professor Ashleigh, after being bitten by the
anthropoid, rapidly developed hydrophobia of a serious nature. After treatment
with a new serum the patient was relieved of the hydrophobic symptoms, but to
my horror this mild-mannered, humane man seems possessed at times of all the
characteristics of the brutal anthropoid&mdash;cunning, thievery, brutality. I
do not know what may come of this. I hesitate to put even these words on to
paper. I am doubtful as to what course, in the interests of humanity, I ought
to take.</p>
<p class="quote">(Signed) &ldquo;James Merrill, M.D.</p>
<p class="quote">&ldquo;Editor&rsquo;s Note. Just as we go to press, a cable
announces the terrible death of Doctor Merrill, the writer of the above notes.
He was attacked by wild animals while alone in a South American jungle, and
torn to pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a queer little silence among the company. No one seemed inclined
for speech. They looked at one another in dumb, wondering horror. Then Quest
drew a penknife from his pocket and with a turn of his wrist forced the lock of
the diary. They all watched him with fascinated eyes. It was something to
escape from their thoughts. They leaned over as he spread the book out before
him. Those first two sentences were almost in the light of a dedication:</p>
<p class="journal"><i>&ldquo;For ten years I have protected my master,
Professor Edgar Ashleigh, at the cost of my peace of mind, my happiness, my
reputation. This book, even though it be too late to help me, shall clear my
reputation.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>Quest closed the volume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;French,&rdquo; he decided, &ldquo;we must find the Professor. Will
you have your men search the house and grounds immediately?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Inspector left the room like a dazed man. They could hear him giving
orders outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next page,&rdquo; Lenora begged. &ldquo;Just one page
more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest hesitated for a moment. Then he turned it over. All three read
again:</p>
<p class="journal"><i>&ldquo;Ten years of horror, struggling all the while to
keep him from that other self, that thing of bestiality, to keep his horrible
secret from the world, to cover up his crimes, even though their shadow should
rest upon me. Now Sanford Quest has come. Will this mean
discovery?&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Another page,&rdquo; Lenora faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more,&rdquo; Quest said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see where it is
leading us? We have the truth here. Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode hastily to the door. French and one of the plain-clothes men were
descending the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Quest asked breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Professor is not in the house,&rdquo; French reported. &ldquo;We
are going to search the grounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest returned to the library. Lenora clung to his arm. The diary lay still
upon the table.</p>
<p>Quest opened the volume slowly. Again they all read together:</p>
<p class="journal"><i>&ldquo;The evil nature is growing stronger every day. He
is developing a sort of ferocious cunning to help him in his crimes. He wanders
about in the dark, wearing a black velvet suit with holes for his eyes, and
leaving only his hands exposed. I have watched him come into a half-darkened
room and one can see nothing but the hands and the eyes; sometimes if he closes
his eyes, only the hands.&rdquo;</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rheinholdt!&rdquo; Quest muttered. &ldquo;Wait. I know where
that suit is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hastened to a cupboard at the farther end of the room, snatched some
garments from it and vanished into the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One moment, girls,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I see now how he did it.
Wait. I&rsquo;ll show you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They stood quite still, a little terrified. In a moment or two the door
reopened. A finger turned out all the electric lights but one. Then there was
nothing to be seen but a pair of white hands, which seemed to come floating
towards them through the darkness&mdash;a pair of white hands and a pair of
gleaming eyes. Lenora screamed wildly. Even Laura was unnerved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo; she cried out. &ldquo;Who are you,
anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lights were suddenly turned on. Quest threw off his disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are,&rdquo; he exclaimed triumphantly. &ldquo;Ingenious,
but one ought to have seen through it long ago. The stroke of genius about it
was that as soon as he had used a dodge once or twice and set you thinking
about it, he dropped it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door was suddenly opened and French entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beaten!&rdquo; he exclaimed tersely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t found him?&rdquo; Quest asked.</p>
<p>French shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve searched every room, every cupboard, every scrap of the
cellar in the house,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been into every
corner of the grounds, searched all the place inside and out. There&rsquo;s no
sign of the Professor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest pocketed the diary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re perfectly certain that he is not in this house or
anywhere upon the premises?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certain sure!&rdquo; French replied.</p>
<p>Quest shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;d better get back,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You come,
too, French. We&rsquo;ll sit down and figure out some scheme for finding
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They made their way to the front door and crowded into the autos. The two
men left with marked reluctance. The two girls had but one idea in their
heads&mdash;to get away, and get away quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do start, please,&rdquo; Lenora begged. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s just one
thing in life I want, and that is to be in my own room, to feel myself away
from his world of horrible, unnatural mysteries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kid has the right idea,&rdquo; Laura agreed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
had enough myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were on the point of starting, the chauffeur with his hand upon the
starting handle, French with the steering wheel of the police car already in
his hand. And then the little party seemed suddenly turned to stone. For a few
breathless seconds not one of them moved. Out into the clammy night air came
the echoes of a hideous, inhuman, blood-curdling scream. Quest was the first to
recover himself. He leaped from his seat and rushed back across the empty hall
into the study, followed a little way behind by French and the others. An
unsuspected panel door which led into the garden, stood slightly ajar. The
Professor, with his hand on the back of a chair, was staring at the fireplace,
shaking as though with some horrible ague, his face distorted, his body
curiously hunched-up. He seemed suddenly to have dropped his humanity, to have
fallen back into the world of some strange creatures. He heard their footsteps,
but he did not turn his head. His hands were stretched out in front of him as
though to keep away from his sight some hateful object.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop him!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Take him away! It&rsquo;s
Craig&mdash;his spirit! He came to me in the garage, he followed me through the
grounds, he mocked at me when I hid in the tree. He&rsquo;s there now, kneeling
before the fireplace. Why can&rsquo;t I kill him! He is coming! Stop him, some
one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one spoke or moved; no one, indeed, had the power. Then at last Quest
found words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no one in the room, Professor,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;except
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of a human voice seemed to produce a strange effect. The Professor
straightened himself, shook his head, his hands dropped to his side. He turned
around and faced them. He was ghastly pale, but his smile was once more the
smile of the amiable naturalist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;forgive me. I am very old, and the
events of these last few hours have unnerved me. Forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He groped for a moment and sank into a chair. Quest fetched a decanter and a
glass from the sideboard, poured out some wine and held it to his lips. The
Professor drank it eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;you have saved me! I have
something to tell you, something I must tell you at once, but not here. I
loathe this place. Let me come with you to your rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; Quest answered calmly.</p>
<p>The Professor rose hastily to his feet. As he turned around, he saw French
concealing something in his hands. He shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need those!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;What are they?
Handcuffs? Ah, no! I am only too anxious to tell you all that I know. Take care
of me, Mr. Quest. Take me with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gripped Quest&rsquo;s arm. In silence they passed from the room, in
silence they took their places once more in the automobiles, in silence they
drove without a pause to Quest&rsquo;s rooms. The Professor seemed to breathe
more freely as they left the neighbourhood of his house behind. He walked up
the stairs to Quest&rsquo;s library almost blithely. If he was aware of it, he
took no notice of French and the two plain-clothes men behind. As he stepped
into the room, he drew a long sigh of relief. He made his way at once to his
favourite easy-chair, threw off his overcoat and leaned back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quest,&rdquo; he pronounced, &ldquo;you are the best friend I have in
my life! It is you who have rid me of my great burden. Tell me&mdash;help me a
little with my story&mdash;have you read that page from the <i>Medical
Journal</i> which Craig has kept locked up all these years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have all read it,&rdquo; Quest replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was forged,&rdquo; the Professor declared firmly, &ldquo;forged by
Craig. All the years since, he has blackmailed me. I have been his servant and
his tool. I have been afraid to speak. At last I am free of him. Thank
God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig, after all,&rdquo; French muttered.</p>
<p>The Professor sat with a faint, wistful smile upon the corners of his lips,
looking around at all of them. His face had become like the face of a child,
eager for sympathy and kindness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will trust me, I know,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;You will
believe me. All my life I have laboured for science. I have never been selfish.
I have laid up no store of gold or treasure. Knowledge has been my mistress,
knowledge has been my heaven. If I had been a wise man, I would have ridden
myself of this hideous burden, but I was foolish and afraid. I wanted to pursue
my studies, I wanted to be left in peace, so I let that fiend prey upon my
fears. But now&mdash;now I feel that the burden has rolled away. I shall tell
you my story, and afterwards I will do great things yet, great things for
science, great things for the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They listened to him, spellbound. Only Lenora stood a little apart with a
faint frown upon her forehead. She touched Quest on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Quest,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;he is lying!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest turned his head. His lips scarcely moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is lying!&rdquo; Lenora insisted. &ldquo;I tell you there&rsquo;s
another creature there, something we don&rsquo;t understand. Let me bring the
Electro-thought transference apparatus; let us read his mind. If I am wrong, I
will go down on my knees and beg for forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest nodded. Lenora hastened to the further end of the room, snatched the
cloth from the instrument and wheeled down the little mirror with its coils and
levers. The Professor watched her. Slowly his face changed. The benevolence
faded away, his teeth for a moment showed in something which was almost a
snarl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe me?&rdquo; he cried, turning to Quest. &ldquo;You are not
going to try that horrible thing on me&mdash;Professor Lord Ashleigh? I am all
broken up. I am not fit for it. Look at my hands, how they shake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Professor,&rdquo; Quest said sternly, &ldquo;we are surrounded by the
shadow of some terrible deeds for which as yet there is no explanation. I do
not say that we mistrust you, but I ask you to submit to this test.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I refuse!&rdquo; the Professor replied harshly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I insist,&rdquo; Quest muttered.</p>
<p>The Professor drew a little breath. He sat back in his chair. His face
became still, his lips were drawn closely together. Lenora wheeled up the
machine and with deft fingers adjusted the fittings on one side. Quest himself
connected it up on the other. The Professor sat there like a figure of stone.
The silence in the room was so intense that the ticking of the small clock upon
the mantelpiece was clearly audible. The silent battle of wills seemed like a
live and visible struggle. The very atmosphere seemed charged with the thrill
and wonder of it. Never before had Quest met with resistance so complete and
immovable. For the first time the thought of failure oppressed him. Even that
slight slackening of his rigid concentration brought relief to the Professor.
Without any knowledge as to the source of their conviction, the two girls who
watched felt that the Professor was becoming dominant. And then there came a
sudden queer change. The intangible triumph of the Professor&rsquo;s stony
poise seemed to fade away. His eyes had sought the corner of the room, his lips
quivered. The horror was there again, the horror they had seen before. He
crouched a little back. His hands were uplifted as though to keep off some evil
thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Craig!&rdquo; Lenora whispered. &ldquo;He thinks he sees Craig
again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest held up his hand. He realised that this was his moment. He leaned a
little farther forward. Sternly he concentrated the whole of his will power
upon his task. Almost at once there was a change. The Professor fell back in
the chair. The tense self-control had passed from his features, his lips
twitched. Simultaneously, the mirror for a moment was clouded,&mdash;then
slowly a picture upon it gathered outline and substance. There was a jungle,
strange, tall trees, and brushwood so thick that it reached to the waists of
the two men who were slowly making their way through it. One was the Professor,
clearly recognisable under his white sun helmet; the other a stranger to all of
them. Suddenly they stopped. The latter had crept a yard or so ahead, his gun
raised to his shoulder, his eyes fixed upon some possible object of pursuit.
There was a sudden change in the Professor. They saw him seize his gun by the
barrel and whirl it above his head. He seemed suddenly to lose his whole
identity. He crouched on his haunches, almost like an animal, and sprang at the
other&rsquo;s throat. They could almost hear the snarl from his lips as the two
men went down together into the undergrowth. The picture faded away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Merrill!&rdquo; Lenora faltered. &ldquo;Then it was not wild
beasts which killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost immediately figures again appeared in the mirror. This time they saw
the Professor in bed in a tent, Craig sitting by him, a violin in his hand. A
native servant entered with food, which he placed by the bedside with a low
obeisance. Slowly the Professor raised himself in bed. His face was distorted,
his mouth curved into strange lines. With a sudden spring he seized the native
servant by the throat and bore him back upon the floor. Craig passed his arm
through his master&rsquo;s and, exerting all his strength, dragged him away.
They saw the man run terrified from the room, they saw Craig soothe the
Professor and finally get him back to bed. Then he seized the violin and bent a
little forward, playing softly. Slowly the Professor relapsed into what seemed
to be a sleep. The scene faded away, to be replaced almost immediately by
another. There was a small passage which seemed to lead from the back entrance
of a house; the Professor with a black mantle, Craig following him, pleading,
expostulating. They saw the conservatory for a minute, and then blackness. The
Professor was leaning against a marble basin. There was nothing to be seen of
him but his eyes and hands. They saw him listen, for a moment or two in cold,
unresponsive silence, then stretch out his hand and push Craig away. The
picture glowed and faded and glowed again. Then they saw through the gloom the
figure of a woman approach, a diamond necklace around her neck. They saw the
hands steal out and encircle her throat&mdash;and then more darkness, silence,
obscurity. The mirror was empty once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Rheinholdt&rsquo;s jewels!&rdquo; Lenora cried. &ldquo;What
next? Oh! my God, what next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their eyes ached with the strain but there was not one of them who could
even glance away from the mirror. It was Quest&rsquo;s study which slowly
appeared then. The Salvation Army girl was there, talking to the Professor.
They saw him leave her, they saw him look back from the door, a strange, evil
glance. Then the secretary entered and spoke to her. Once more the door opened.
The hands were there, stretching and reaching, a paper-weight gripped in the
right-hand fingers. They saw it raised above the secretary&rsquo;s head, they
saw the other hand take the girl by the throat and push her towards the table.
A wild scream broke from Lenora&rsquo;s lips. Quest wavered for a moment. The
picture faded out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop it!&rdquo; Lenora begged. &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we seen
enough? We know the truth now. Stop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The criminologist made no reply. His eyes were still fixed upon the
Professor, who showed some signs of returning consciousness. He was gripping at
his collar. He seemed to have difficulty with his breathing. Quest suddenly
braced himself. He pushed Lenora back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something growing
in his mind. I can feel it. Wait!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again they all turned towards the mirror. They saw the hallway of Ashleigh
House, the pictures upon the walls, they could almost feel the quiet silence of
night. They saw the Professor come stealing down the stairs. He was wearing the
black velvet suit with the cowl in his hand. They watched him pause before a
certain door, draw on the cowl and disappear. Through the opening they could
see Lord Ashleigh asleep in bed, the moonlight streaming through the open
window across the counterpane. They saw the Professor turn with a strange,
horrible look in his face and close the door. Lenora burst into sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more!&rdquo; she begged. &ldquo;No more, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly, without any warning, Laura also began to sob hysterically. French
mopped his forehead with his handkerchief. His face was unrecognisable. He had
lost all his healthy colour, and his lips were twitching. Quest himself was as
pale as death, and there were black rims under his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had enough,&rdquo; he admitted, swaying a little on his
feet. &ldquo;Undo the other band, if you can, Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward and released their victim. The whole atmosphere of the
place seemed immediately to change. Lenora drew a long, convulsive breath and
sank into a chair. The Professor sat up, and gazed at them all with the air of
a man who had just awakened from a dream. His features relapsed, his mouth once
more resolved itself into pleasant and natural lines. He smiled at them
cordially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I, by any chance, slept?&rdquo; he asked.
&ldquo;Or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He never finished his sentence. His eyes fell upon the mirror, the metal
band lying by his side. He read the truth in the faces still turned towards
him. He rose to his feet. There was another and equally sudden change in his
demeanour and tone. He carried himself with the calm dignity of the
scientist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end of our struggle, I presume?&rdquo; he said to Quest, pointing
to the metal band. &ldquo;You will at least admit that I have shown you fine
sport?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one answered him. Even Quest had barely yet recovered himself. The
Professor shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recognise, of course,&rdquo; he said gravely, &ldquo;that this is
the end. A person <i>in extremis</i> has privileges. Will you allow me to write
just a matter of twenty lines at your desk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silently Quest assented. The Professor seated himself in the swing chair,
drew a sheet of paper towards him, dipped the pen in the ink and began to
write. Then he turned round and reached for his own small black bag which lay
upon the table. Quest caught him by the wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want out of that, Professor?&rdquo; he enquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely my own pen and ink,&rdquo; the Professor expostulated.
&ldquo;If there is anything I detest in the world, it is violet ink. And your
pen, too, is execrable. As these are to be the last words I shall leave to a
sorrowing world, I should like to write them in my own fashion. Open the bag
for yourself, if you will. You can pass me the things out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest opened the bag, took out a pen and a small glass bottle of ink. He
handed them to the Professor, who started once more to write. Quest watched him
for a moment and then turned away to French. The Professor looked over his
shoulder and suddenly bared his wrist. Lenora seized her employer by the
arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;What is he going to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest swung round, but he was too late. The Professor had dug the pen into
his arm. He sat in his chair and laughed as they all hurried towards him. Then
suddenly he sprang to his feet. Again the change came into his face which they
had seen in the mirror. French dashed forward towards him. The Professor
snarled, seemed about to spring, then suddenly once more stretched out his
hands to show that he was helpless and handed to Quest the paper upon which he
had been writing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have nothing to fear from me,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Here is
my last message to you, Sanford Quest. Read it&mdash;read it aloud. Always
remember that this was not your triumph but mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest held up the paper. They all read. The Professor&rsquo;s letters were
carefully formed, his handwriting perfectly legible.</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;You have been a clever opponent, Sanford Quest, but
even now you are to be cheated. The wisdom of the ages outreaches yours,
outreaches it and triumphs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest looked up quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil does he mean?&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>The Professor&rsquo;s arms shot suddenly above his head. Again that strange,
animal look convulsed his features. He burst into a loud, unnatural laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mean, you fool?&rdquo; he cried, holding out his wrist, which was
slowly turning black. &ldquo;Poisoned! That is what it means!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all stared at him. Quest seized the ink bottle, revealed the false top
and laid it down again with a little exclamation. Then, before they could
realize it, the end came. The Professor lay, a crumpled-up heap, upon the
floor. The last change of all had taken place in his face. His arms were
outstretched, his face deathly white, his lips faintly curved in the half
amiable, half supercilious smile of the savant who sees beyond. Quest stooped
over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p class="cp">* * * * *</p>
<p>Quest swung round in his chair as French entered the room, and held out his
left hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, French. Help yourself to a cigar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I want to smoke this morning just at present,
thank you,&rdquo; French replied.</p>
<p>Quest laid down his pen and looked up. French was fidgeting about with his
hat in his hand. He was dressed more carefully than usual, but he was obviously
ill at ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing wrong, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, there&rsquo;s nothing wrong,&rdquo; French admitted. &ldquo;I
just looked in&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest waited for a moment. Then he crossed his legs and assumed a patient
attitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the dickens did you look in for?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact of it is,&rdquo; French explained, &ldquo;I should like a
few words with Miss Laura.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest laughed shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why on earth couldn&rsquo;t you say so?&rdquo; he observed.
&ldquo;Never knew you bashful before, Inspector. She&rsquo;s up in the
laboratory. I&rsquo;ll ring for some one to show you the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest touched the bell and his new secretary entered almost at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take Inspector French up into the laboratory,&rdquo; Quest directed.
&ldquo;See you later, French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I hope so,&rdquo; the Inspector replied
nervously.</p>
<p>Quest watched him disappear, with a puzzled smile.</p>
<p>Then he sat down at his desk, drew a sheet of paper towards him and began to
write:</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;My dear Inspector,</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;I am taking this opportunity of letting you know that
out of deference to the wishes of the woman I hope soon to marry, I am
abandoning the hazardous and nerve-racking profession of criminology for a
safer and happier career. You will have, therefore, to find help elsewhere in
the future.</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;With best wishes,</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;Yours,</p>
<p class="letter">&ldquo;Sanford Quest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the sheet of paper upon the desk and, ringing the bell, sent for
Lenora. She appeared in a few moments and came over to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it, Mr. Quest?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He gave her the letter without remark. She read it through and, turning
slowly around, looked at him expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that seem to you?&rdquo; he asked, reaching out his hand
for a cigar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very sensible indeed,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no sort of life, this, for a married man,&rdquo; Quest
declared. &ldquo;You agree with me there, don&rsquo;t you, Lenora?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; she admitted, a little faintly.</p>
<p>Quest lit his cigar deliberately. Then he enclosed the letter in an envelope
and addressed it to Inspector French.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better deliver this to the Inspector,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;in case he doesn&rsquo;t call round here on his way out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed her the note. For a moment she looked at him, then she turned
quickly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall have it at once,&rdquo; she said in a low tone.</p>
<p>Quest watched her cross the room. She opened the door and passed out without
a backward glance. Then he shrugged his shoulders, hesitated for a moment, and
followed her. He heard the door of her apartment on the next floor close,
however, and made his way to the laboratory. He entered the room softly and
paused upon the threshold. His presence was altogether unobserved by the two
people who were standing at the other end of the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say, Miss Laura,&rdquo; the Inspector was saying, &ldquo;this has
got to come sometime or other. Why don&rsquo;t you make up your mind to it?
I&rsquo;m no great hand at love-making, but I&rsquo;m the right sort of man for
you and I think you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; Quest murmured to himself, &ldquo;is where Laura boxes
the Inspector&rsquo;s ears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing of the sort happened, however. There was a queer, a mystifying
change in Laura&rsquo;s expression. She was looking down at the floor. Suddenly
her face was hidden in her hands. The Inspector threw his arms around her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all the answer I want,&rdquo; he declared.</p>
<p>Quest stole softly away. As he regained the door of his study, Lenora,
dressed for the street, hurried out. She tried to pass him but he laid his hand
upon her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just going round to Mr. French&rsquo;s office,&rdquo; she
explained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Quest replied. &ldquo;The
Inspector&rsquo;s here. You can leave the note upon the table. Hi,
Parkins,&rdquo; he called out to his secretary in the next room, &ldquo;get my
hat and coat. Come back a moment, Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned into the room a little unwillingly and leaned against the table.
Quest stood by her side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lenora,&rdquo; he said quietly, &ldquo;that was kind of a brutal note
I told you to give to French, but I thought you&rsquo;d understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She raised her eyes suddenly to his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understand what?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>The secretary entered the room, helped Quest on with his coat and handed him
his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are quite ready, Lenora.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Where are we going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quest sighed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fancy having to explain all these things!&rdquo; he said, taking her
arm. &ldquo;I just want you to understand, Lenora, that I&rsquo;ve
waited&mdash;quite long enough. Parkins,&rdquo; he added, turning to his
secretary, &ldquo;if any one calls, just say that my wife and I will be back
early in the afternoon. And you&rsquo;d better step upstairs to the laboratory
and give my compliments to Inspector French, and say that I hope he and Miss
Laura will join us at Delmonico&rsquo;s for luncheon at one
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir,&rdquo; the man replied.</p>
<p>Lenora&rsquo;s face was suddenly transformed. She passed her arm through
Quest&rsquo;s. He stooped and kissed her as he led her towards the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You understand now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he whispered, smiling
down at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; she admitted, with a little sigh of content.</p>
