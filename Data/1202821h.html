<h3>PREFACE.</h3>
<h4><small>BY THE EDITOR.</small></h4>
<p>The form in which the present account of Colonel Warburton's remarkable
journey across the Western Interior of Australia is given to the public,
requires a few words of explanation.</p>
<p>The gallant leader of the expedition, on his return to Adelaide, enfeebled
by the privations and sufferings of his long journey, had little inclination to
pen a full narrative of the expedition. He fulfilled the duty of rendering a
Report of his proceedings, in the form of extracts from his Journal, to Messrs
Elder and Hughes, the gentlemen who bore the expenses of the undertaking; but
he had neither health nor desire to undergo the further literary labour
necessary to elaborate a complete narrative for general readers. The promoters
of the expedition, however, justly thought that some account of the first
successful attempt to traverse this vast unknown region&mdash;all efforts to
penetrate which had previously been baffled&mdash;was deserving of permanent
record, and would be likely to interest a large section of the reading public;
they transmitted, therefore, the original Report to England for publication,
with a recommendation that it should be accompanied by a narrative of the more
important of the many previous explorations in the same region. Colonel
Warburton himself subsequently, in November last, visited his native land,
after an absence of more than forty years, and consented to this arrangement,
selecting his relative, Mr. Charles H. Eden, who&mdash;from his knowledge of
Australia, obtained during a residence of some years in Queensland&mdash;was
well qualified for such a task, to write the required account of previous
explorations, which account forms the Introduction to the present volume.
During his brief stay in London, of less than six weeks, Colonel Warburton was
able to add but little to the information supplied by his Report; his failing
eyesight, caused by the fearful sufferings of his journey, rendering him
incapable of writing. Verbally, however, he supplied matter of considerable
interest and importance, which Mr. Eden has either interwoven into his
introductory chapters, or interpolated, within parentheses, in the Journal.
Some few amplifications of Colonel Warburton's own statements or descriptions,
supplied in the same way, have been incorporated, at the discretion of the
Editor, in the text of the Journal itself.</p>
<p>The majority of readers will, no doubt, see reason for satisfaction in the
circumstance that the efforts and struggles of the gallant party, with all
their hopes and fears when a lingering death seemed their inevitable fate, are
here given exactly as jotted down by the leader, whilst the agony was fresh in
his mind. To such the evident fidelity and absence of exaggeration of Colonel
Warburton's style will be an additional charm.</p>
<p>To Mr. Eden's very interesting summary of previous explorations, it needs
only to be added that the numerous efforts on the part of the Government and
Colonists of Western Australia to penetrate from their side the desert
interior, have at length been crowned with success in the brilliant exploit of
Mr. John Forrest, who, starting at about the time of the completion of Colonel
Warburton's traverse, struck across the <i>terra incognita</i> at a part where
it is much wider than where crossed by Warburton, and arrived safely at the
Peake Station, on the line of the overland telegraph. The spirit of
Geographical Exploration in Western Australia, which in former years had given
rise to the remarkable expeditions of Roe, Lefroy, and Hunt, has of late years
been greatly encouraged by Governor Weld, under whom the two Forrests, John and
Alexander, have successively pushed their investigation farther and farther
into the waste of salt-swamps, which seems to occupy the greater part of the
interior due east from the Swan River settlements. In 1870 Mr. John Forrest had
repeated Mr. Eyre's feat of journeying completely round the Great Bight (from
West to East), happily experiencing scarcely any of the hardships which were
nearly proving fatal to the whole of the party of the earlier explorer.</p>
<p>The relatives of Colonel Warburton, to whom, on his return to Australia, the
final arrangements of the present work were confided, desire to express their
especial thanks to Professor Owen, Dr. Hooker, Mr. J. Gould, and Dr. Henry
Trimen (of the Botanical Department of the British Museum), for the assistance
they have rendered in determining the species of animals and plants mentioned
in the Journal, and in furnishing notes in elucidation of various points. The
illustrations are by Mr. Ulick J. Burke.</p>

<p class="margin2"><small>Western Interior of Australia.&mdash;Settlement of
Swan River.&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation of the colony of South Australia.&mdash;Various<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opinions regarding the interior.</small></p>
<p><small>IN</small> the slight sketch of Australian Exploration that I propose
to lay before the reader as an introduction to the Journal of Colonel Egerton
Warburton, I shall confine myself entirely to the western half of the
Continent, and to the many attempts that have been made by enterprising men to
penetrate the mysteries of the interior of that portion. Though Western
Australia occupies a larger space upon the map than any of its sister colonies,
an observer cannot fail to be struck, by the vast extent of
unoccupied&mdash;even unknown&mdash;country that it contains, and this
desolation is the more remarkable when it is considered that within the
boundary of this colony are included the earliest discovered portions of the
Continent.</p>
<p>In 1829 Captain Stirling was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the new
settlement on the Swan River, and on his arrival in the month of August of that
year this officer found a number of anxious immigrants camped on the banks of
the Swan and Canning rivers, with no better shelter against the inclemency of
the Australian winter than the tents they had brought with them from England.
Every month added to their numbers and to the disorder that prevailed. Not an
acre of land had been surveyed; the settlers sat down at random on the river
banks; there was no money to procure the common necessaries of life from the
neighbouring colonies; even the Governor and his officials received large
grants of land instead of a salary; and to add to the distress, the immigrants
were of a class unaccustomed to manual labour, and totally unfitted for the
arduous task of founding a new settlement. By. March, 1830, fifty ships,
containing two thousand people with property&mdash;not money&mdash;to the
amount of 100,000<i>l</i>., had arrived, and as yet hardly twenty houses were
standing at the new township of Perth for their accommodation. Many of the
disappointed adventurers found their way to the adjoining colonies, and for
twenty years the remainder fought manfully for existence; yet so hard was the
struggle, and such the depression prevailing, that even so late as 1848 the
inhabitants seriously entertained the project of abandoning the settlement for
good. When the neighbouring colonies protested against the dregs of the
population being landed on their shores from the mother country. Western
Australia petitioned for them, and since the introduction of convict labour her
position has vastly improved; but still the energy of the colonists has been
fettered by the nature of the country and the small area of agricultural and
pastoral land yet discovered. Western Australia is ill adapted to the extensive
pursuit of agriculture, and, from the arid nature of the soil, the grasses are
scantier and less succulent than in the eastern colonies, hence the quantity of
wool at present exported is trifling when compared with the enormous weight
annually yielded by her more favoured sisters. In 1852 Governor Fitzgerald
wrote, "I fear that unless new grasses spring up, or are introduced into our
pastures, we shall never be able to rival in this respect the production of the
eastern colonies. Our lands fit for sheep are so small in extent in proportion
to the rest of the colony, that a limit will soon be arrived at unless better
pastures be discovered. Should such exist, they probably lie far to the
North-east."</p>
<p>South Australia was founded in 1836, and after the reverses always
inseparable from the infancy of a settlement, she rapidly rose into a wealthy
and populous colony. The land was found admirably adapted to the growth of
cereals, and enormous mineral wealth&mdash;chiefly copper&mdash;was discovered
within her bounds; but after a time the mines were found only to employ a
certain number of hands, and the wheat-fields became impoverished from
constantly bearing so exhaustive a crop. The South Australian statesmen were
not slow to remark this, and immediately all their energy was devoted to the
only remedy&mdash;the discovery of fresh lands towards the interior. Party
after party went forth to struggle with the fearful difficulties of penetrating
the desert regions to the north-east and north, and returned baffled yet not
beaten. In spite of every obstacle, daring men persevered where success seemed
impossible, and after repeated repulses the great end was achieved, and not
only a road, but a telegraph line now stretches across the breadth of the
entire Continent, from Adelaide to the northern seaboard. A volume would hardly
suffice to chronicle the deeds of these intrepid explorers, and in the slight
sketch which follows, it is only attempted to give a brief account of two or
three of the most prominent amongst their number.</p>
<p>After Stuart had finally succeeded in opening out a route, and more
particularly since the establishment of the telegraph line, a new base was
presented for western exploration, and both South and Western Australia threw
themselves heart and soul into the task of opening out overland communication.
Dr. G. Neumayer, in a paper advocating the scientific exploration of Central
Australia, read before the Royal Geographical Society on 8th June, 1868, says,
"A glance at the map shows us what an immense tract of land is entirely
unknown. Indeed, we might describe a circle in the portion lying to the west of
Stuart's track, enclosing an area of half a million of square miles, of which
our knowledge is absolutely <i>nil</i>. We should form a more adequate estimate
of the fact, if we considered that this is at the same time the greatest
absolute blank on the face of the globe&mdash;the polar regions excepted; as we
know more even of that great tract of country on the African Continent which
lies south of the equator and near the western coast. This 'Terra Australiensis
incognita' is somewhat less than one-fifth of the entire Continent, and forms
the western slope of what we are justified&mdash;according to all
appearances&mdash;in terming the Great Interior Basin." This gentleman,
speaking of Western Australia and the small settlements on the north-west
coast, says, "It is not difficult to see that these colonies, separated as they
are from their eastern sisters by a vast unknown territory, will have to
struggle hard to make any progress; indeed, such progress is scarcely possible
unless they extend their territory towards and across the watershed of the
interior basin, and unless overland communication be established between them
and the other colonies." Dr. Neumayer had no doubt whatever that an exploration
of that great blank on our map would materially assist, nay establish, such a
communication&mdash;practicable at all seasons&mdash;for the mutual benefit of
the colonies, and give thereby a fresh impetus to the spirit of enterprise in
the country.</p>
<p>From the above remarks, which embody the opinion of most of the colonists,
it will be seen that an overland route from east to west would be of
incalculable advantage to the inhabitants of both regions; South Australia has
capital lying idle, and is longing for fresh fields on which to expend it;
Western Australia is burning to break through the forbidding desert that
impinges on her very gates, and cripples the energies of her sons.</p>
<p>In the discussion on the above paper, Sir Charles Nicholson drew the
following conclusion from the expedition of Mr. Forrest towards the interior in
1869:&mdash;"That vast areas of the interior still remain untrodden by any
European is an undoubted fact; an ample supply of data exists, however,
enabling us to predicate with some degree of certainty as to the probable
physical and geographical characteristics of the regions yet untraversed by
civilized man; and there is little to justify any expectation that these will
be found to differ in character from the inhospitable wilderness, from the
confines of which so many enterprising travellers have been obliged to turn
their steps, and on the borders of which not a few have perished. It may, I
think, be reasonably assumed, that the whole interior region west of the 140th
degree of east longitude, and north of the 30th degree of south latitude, is of
the most unpromising kind; that it is without rivers, without mountains,
forming an inhospitable and dreary desert, similar to that traversed by Stuart,
Sturt, Burke, Wills, and Mr. Forrest; and I cannot forbear expressing my
conviction that, beyond the desirability of simply determining the
fact&mdash;and all knowledge, even of a negative character is
desirable&mdash;that there is little to tempt or repay an explorer in the
desolate region included within the limits above mentioned.
Portions&mdash;perhaps, not inconsiderable tracts&mdash;may be found along the
coast, and extending for a few miles inland on the northern and western shores;
but they will, I believe, be found to be a mere fringe, surrounding a
widespread Sahara." That the speaker formed a most correct estimate of the
interior&mdash;as at present known&mdash;is undeniable; but, despite his
forecast, we may venture to think that not until every means have been adopted
to ascertain beyond the possibility of a doubt the non-existence of an overland
route from east to west, should the attempt to gain that great end be
abandoned. How little did Sturt, when baffled and impeded by the stony desert,
dream of the country now laid open by Stuart lying a few hundred miles before
him! and may we not at least hope that endurance and energy will develop a
similar belt connecting the east with the west? It is yet early in the day to
predict the impossibility of such an achievement. Even at this moment, rumours
of a successful journey from Western to Southern Australia have reached
England, Ernest Giles has shown that the interior is not the blank wilderness
that we have hitherto supposed, and who knows what future explorations may not
bring forth? Let us hope for the best, and in the interim a brief account of
the earliest attempts to pierce the western interior can scarcely fail to
interest the reader.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-02" id="ch-02"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p align="center"><small>Eyre's journey along the shores of the Great
Bight.</small></p>
<p><small>BY</small> the year 1840 both Perth and Adelaide were sufficiently
advanced to contemplate an overland road between the two colonies.</p>
<p>A gentleman was then residing in South Australia, whose name had become
known in the colony as a daring explorer, and whose tenacity of purpose and
steadfastness in following up any undertaking to which he directed his
thoughts, had already become widely known. This man was Edward John Eyre, the
friend of Sturt, and the father of Western Australian exploration. The
principal object hoped to be attained by the expedition was the opening a route
by which stock could be transmitted from one colony to the other. During the
previous year Mr. Eyre had carefully examined the country westward of the then
settled districts, and convinced himself of the utter impracticability of
opening an overland route for stock in that direction. From his personal
observation he inclined to break ground towards the north in preference to the
west; hence, on the 23rd May, 1840, he wrote the following remarkable letter to
the <i>South Australian Register</i>, in which his sagacity, and thorough
knowledge of his subject are equally apparent:&mdash;"It may now therefore be a
question for those who are interested in the sending an expedition overland to
the Swan River, to consider what are likely to be the useful results from such
a journey. In a geographical point of view it will be exceedingly interesting
to know the character of the intervening country between this colony and
theirs, and to unfold the secrets hidden by those lofty and singular cliffs at
the head of the Great Bight, and so far, it might perhaps be practicable, since
it is possible that a light party might, in a favourable season, force their
way across; as regards the transit of stock, however, my own conviction is that
it is quite impracticable. The vast extent of desert country to the westward,
the scarcity of grass, the denseness of the scrub, and the all but total
absence of water, even in the most favourable seasons, are in themselves
sufficient bars to the transit of stock, even to a distance we are already
acquainted with; I would rather, therefore, turn the public attention to the
northward, as being the most probable point from which discoveries of
importance maybe made, or such as are likely to prove beneficial to this and
the other colonies, and from which it is possible the veil may be lifted from
the still unknown and mysterious interior of this vast Continent."</p>
<p>Any suggestion emanating from such a man as Eyre was certain to be received
by the colonists with respect, and the public attention, consequent on this
letter, became centred in northern exploration. Feeling that this change in
opinion was chiefly owing to himself, Mr. Eyre at once volunteered to lead a
party into the interior. His offer was accepted, an exploration fund
instituted, to which the inhabitants freely contributed, the Government
furthering the undertaking by a grant of 100<i>l</i>., and every assistance
that lay within their power; and, to use Mr. Eyre's own words, "My arrangements
proceeded rapidly and unremittingly, whilst the kindness of the Governor, the
committee of colonists, my private friends, and the public generally, relieved
me of many difficulties, and facilitated my preparations in a manner that I
could hardly have hoped or expected."</p>
<p>It will be seen from the above how early in its history South Australia lent
its capital and its energy to the task of opening up the central portion of the
Continent. That this public spirit is still extant, I think the sequel of this
volume will show.</p>
<p>On the 18th of June the party, consisting of six Europeans and two black
boys, started forth, accompanied for some distance by the Governor and most of
the leading inhabitants. Mr. Eyre's intention was to examine Lake Torrens in
the first place, and then to push northward; many and various were the
conjectures then rife concerning the great interior. Some thought that a vast
inland sea would be discovered, an Australian Mediterranean, by means of which
communication could be established with the habitable belt fringing the
Northern coast. A few desponding people were inclined to think the adventurers
would encounter a huge saltpan, lying white and glistening in the sun, and
forbidding farther progress. Captain Sturt differed from both these opinions. I
quote a speech made by him at the time. "With regard to an observation which he
(Captain Sturt) had made on Friday evening, regarding this Continent having
been formerly an Archipelago, he stated that he was of opinion that a
considerable space of barren land in all probability existed between this
district and what had formerly been the next island. This space was likely to
be barren, though of course it would be impossible to say how far it extended.
He had every reason to believe, from what he had seen of the Australian
Continent, that at some distance to the northward a large tract of barren
country would be found, or perhaps a body of water, beyond which a good country
would in all probability exist."</p>
<p>For months Mr. Eyre and his party struggled to penetrate northward; but in
every direction Lake Torrens, overlapping them like a monster horseshoe,
checked their progress. Owing to the extreme rarefaction of the atmosphere,
everything wore a distorted aspect; what had from a distance appeared as rocks,
turning on inspection into very small lumps of dirt or clay lying in the bed of
the lake. The lake was penetrated for six miles, and so far found devoid of
surface-water. It was nothing but a bed of mud, becoming softer and softer as
the party advanced, which they persevered in doing until the horses sinking in
the slime up to their bellies rendered their return imperative. The whole of
this surface of mud was covered with a coating of salt about one-eighth of an
inch in thickness; a glittering belt, dazzling to the eye, but heart-breaking
to the explorer. As further efforts in that direction would have been in vain,
the party struck westward, and reached "Fowler's Bay", in the Great Bight. From
this point they tried to push round the head of the Bight, being driven back
twice from want of water, but in a third attempt Eyre was more successful, and
managed to penetrate fifty miles along the coast beyond the northern point of
the ocean. These repeated efforts had cost the expedition dear, for they lost
their best horses, which rendered it impossible to carry provisions for so
large a party. The leader was therefore reluctantly compelled to send some of
their number back in the small Government cutter which had been placed at his
disposal. During the absence of the little vessel Eyre meditated bitterly on
the obstacles that had hitherto impeded his progress, and came to the desperate
determination that on the return of the cutter with forage he would make his
way round the Great Bight to Western Australia with pack-horses only, a
distance exceeding 1000 miles of trackless desert.</p>
<p>On the 26th January, 1841, the boat returned, having on board a favourite
black boy of Mr. Eyre's, a native of King George's Sound, named Wylie. She also
brought a letter from the Governor, informing him that the cutter could not be
employed outside South Australian waters, though she was perfectly at his
disposal within their limits. This was a bitter disappointment, and completely
frustrated his plans. To take his already reduced party across the desert would
now be impossible, for the horses could not carry food enough to support them.
Only one means remained, and to this Mr. Eyre was compelled to resort, viz. to
still further reduce his following. On the 31st January the cutter sailed,
every man on board her watching with straining eyes the small party on the
beach. With only one white companion the gallant leader had determined to
traverse that fearful wilderness, "firmly determined never to return
unsuccessful, but either to accomplish the object he had in view or to perish
in the attempt", and now only waited the restoration of the horses to good
condition, to sally forth into the desert.</p>
<p>In explaining his motives for the change in the destination of his
expedition, Mr. Eyre says,&mdash;"It will be remembered, that in stating the
origin and commencement of the northern expedition, it was remarked that a
previously contemplated expedition to the westward was made to give way to it,
and that I had myself been principally instrumental in changing the direction
of public attention from the one to the other; it will be remembered also what
publicity had been given to our departure, how great was the interest felt in
the progress of our labours, and how sanguine were the expectations formed as
to the results; alas, how signally had these hopes been dashed to the ground!
After the toils, anxieties, and privations of eight months, neither useful nor
valuable discoveries had been made; hemmed in by an impracticable desert, or
the bed of an impassable lake, I had been baffled and defeated in every
direction, and to have returned now would have been to have rendered of no
avail the great expenses that had been incurred in the outfit of the
expedition, to have thrown away the only opportunity presented to me of making
some amends for past failure, and of endeavouring to justify the confidence
that had been reposed, in me, by carrying through the exploration which had
been originally again set out, every moment expecting to see a break in the
line of cliffs along which they had now toiled so far. Alas! they still
continued stretching as far as the eye could see to the westward, and as fast
as they arrived at one point, it was but to be met with the view of another
beyond. Thus hour after hour passed away, mile after mile was traversed, and
yet no change was observable. By noon, 110 miles from the last water was
reached, and still the country continued the same. The sheep still travelled,
but were getting so tired, and their pace was so slow, that it was decided to
leave them behind, and, by moving on more rapidly, endeavour to save the lives
of their horses and themselves. Setting to work, Mr. Eyre and the boy made a
strong enclosure of shrubs, in which they shut up the wretched sheep. A note
was hastily written to the overseer, directing him to bury the loads of the
horses, and hasten on with the animals alone. To attract attention a long
stick, to which was attached a red handkerchief, was raised above the
sheep-yard, and by one o'clock they were again pursuing their weary way, though
much more rapidly than before. In a few miles they came to a well-beaten native
road, and hopes were raised that their sufferings would soon be at an end. It
was not to be, for the rocky holes to which the track led were <i>dry!</i> They
had now been four days without any water for their horses, their own scanty
store was exhausted, and there appeared as little probability of their soon
procuring it as there had been two days ago. At dark they had left the
sheep-yard fifteen miles behind, and followed another native path, which, like
its predecessor, led them only to dry holes in the rock. Staggering onward
along the top of the cliffs, the wanderers found a new obstacle to impede their
progress, for the country, which had hitherto been tolerably open, now became
scrubby, and it was found impossible either to keep a straight course, or to
make any way through it in the dark. Still they kept perseveringly onward,
leading their horses, and forcing a passage as they best could. They were,
however, soon compelled to desist. The black boy could hardly move; Eyre
himself was but little better, and both were suffering from a parching thirst,
so they laid down to wait for daylight. The boy, ignorant of the dangers which
beset him, was soon sound asleep, but no soothing slumber visited the eyelids
of the weary white man, whose own distresses were lost in the apprehensions
which he entertained for those who were left behind. They were now 128 miles
from the last water, whilst the horses had not had a drop for four whole days
and nights, and had been almost without food also, for they could not feed on
the parched and withered grass. The state the poor animals were in was truly
pitiable: what, then, was likely to be the condition of those that were coming
after and carrying heavy packs? A wretched vigil indeed must Eyre have kept
that night, for he says, "It was clear, that unless I discovered water early in
the morning, the whole of our horses must perish, whilst it would be very
doubtful if we could succeed even in saving our own lives."</p>
<p>Early in the morning (March 11th) they moved on, and on reaching the edge of
the cliffs noticed some sandhills which they had passed the previous night, but
had not seen owing to the darkness. The agonizing thought now occurred to the
leader, that the water spoken of by the natives might be amongst these
sandhills, and that he was going away from instead of approaching it. The bare
idea of such a possibility was almost maddening, and the brave man stood for a
moment undecided, and irresolute what he ought to do. Should he go back, the
horses could never return if the sandhills failed to yield the wished for
supply. For a few minutes he carefully scanned the line of coast extended
before him. In the distance was faintly discernible a low sandy shore, and Eyre
made up his mind at once to advance. What self-possession and iron nerve must
have been brought to bear on this momentous decision, I leave the reader to
imagine. Seven miles brought them to a point where the cliffs receded from the
seashore, and, as they inclined inland, left a low sandy country between them
and some high, bare sandhills near the sea. A native road led down to the
seashore, and in a mile and a half from where they descended they reached the
white sand-drifts. Upon turning into these to search for water, they were
fortunate enough to strike the very place where the natives had dug little
wells; "and thus," says Mr. Eyre himself, "on the fifth day of our sufferings,
we were again blessed with abundance of water, nor could I help considering it
as a special instance of the goodness of Providence, that we had passed the
sandy valley in the dark, and had thereby been deterred from descending to
examine the sandhills it contained; had we done so, the extra fatigue to our
horses and the great length of time it would have taken up, would probably have
prevented the horses from ever reaching the water we were now at." After a few
hours of indispensable rest, Mr. Eyre and the boy hurried back to the relief of
Baxter and his party, carrying a three-gallon keg of water. Without this timely
succour the latter could never have survived; but at last they were all once
more assembled together, and remained at the sandhills a week, recruiting the
horses, and recovering the stores that had been left behind by the
overseer.</p>
<p>On the 18th March they set forward again, and by the evening of the
following day had accomplished forty miles; but the desolate appearance of the
country convincing Mr. Eyre that a long distance would have to be traversed
before again reaching an oasis, he resolved to leave the baggage where it was,
to send back the horses to the last water, rest them for two or three days, and
then load them with as much of the precious element as they could carry. This
was done; the whole party returned, except one. Edward Eyre remained alone in
the desert to watch the sheep, with <i>six pints of water to last him as many
days.</i> On examining the charts, he found that they had still 600 miles to
traverse, measured in a straight line, and, owing to circuits and inequalities,
it would be impossible to accomplish this in less than 800 miles of distance,
which would take eight weeks under the most favourable circumstances, most
probably twelve when impediments were taken into consideration. For subsistence
during this period they possessed three sheep and 142 pounds of flour, to be
shared amongst five people, and the country was so indescribably wretched that
no relief could be expected from roots or game. Can anything more horrible be
conceived than the position in which Eyre now found himself, desolation all
around him, the shore strewn with oars, planks, and fragments of wrecks, and no
companionship but his own thoughts? Still, never for one moment did the idea of
retreat present itself to his mind; during those days of thirst and solitude
the indomitable will remained unbroken, and but one word rose to the parched
lips, that word was. Onward. When the party rejoined him the six pints of water
were exhausted, evaporation had robbed him of some, and once or twice he had
spilled a little.</p>
<p>When seventy-two miles were made the sand ridges became so harassing that it
was necessary to still further lighten the loads of the horses. The leader and
Baxter therefore resorted all the baggage, throwing away every article that was
not absolutely indispensable. All clothes, but a single spare shirt and pair of
boots for each, were discarded; most of the pack-saddles, all the buckets but
one, the medicines, some of the firearms, the ammunition, and last, most of the
kegs for carrying water, besides a variety of other things, were here
abandoned. Forward once more, the route lying by the seashore, where the drift
seaweed drove them into the loose heavy sand above high-water mark, and the
utmost vigilance was requisite to prevent the thirsty horses from plunging
their muzzles into the pitiless ocean and draining the salt draught of
destruction. 102 miles from the last water and fifty still from the next. The
Timor pony gave in, and had to be left to its fate. For five days the horses
had been without water, and 112 miles of country had been traversed without the
possibility of procuring food for them, other than the dry and sapless remains
of last year's grass. Whenever the party halted they followed them about like
dogs, looking to their masters only for aid, "and exhibiting that confidence in
us which I trust we all reposed in the Almighty, for most truly did we feel,
that in His mercy and protection alone our safety could now ever be hoped
for."</p>
<p>Baxter, the overseer, though still performing his duty with cheerfulness and
assiduity, unfortunately began at this crisis to entertain gloomy anticipations
of the future. He doubted the existence of water ahead, and the possibility of
saving the horses. But though his mind was constantly occupied with thoughts of
returning, which he believed was the only means of saving their lives, he never
gave way to despondency, but looked calmly to the future, considering and
reasoning upon the plan it might be best to adopt. With respect to the black
boys, they appeared to think or care but little about the future; insensible of
their danger as long as there was anything left to eat or drink, they played,
laughed, and joked with each other as much as ever. Everything was now
abandoned except two guns, the keg with a little water, and a very small
quantity of flour, tea, and sugar. Before many miles two of the horses gave in,
and had to be left behind, and at nine in the evening of the 28th March, with
feet inflamed by the salt water, the party came to a halt, when, as usual, the
natives enjoyed an undisturbed repose, and the two Europeans had to watch the
horses by turns throughout the night. Morning dawned, the prospect was
cheerless and gloomy, and they were 126 miles from the last water; their own
scanty store was nearly exhausted and they were unable to afford any for
breakfast. Travelling painfully onward, evening at length overtook them, their
last and long husbanded drop of water was consumed, and the horses were turned
out behind the nearest sand ridge; completely worn out by the labours of the
day, neither the leader nor the overseer were capable of watching them. At
day-dawn Eyre was afoot, and endeavoured with a sponge to collect some of the
dew which was hanging in spangles upon the grass and shrubs. When the sponge
was saturated he squeezed it into a quart pot, and in an hour's time had filled
the little vessel. The black boys had been employed in the same manner, using a
handful of fine grass instead of a sponge, and their several collections united
in one common stock were made into tea and divided amongst the whole party.
When, if ever, would they again taste liquid? None knew.</p>
<p>The morning of March 30th was misty and the nature of the country could not
be discerned. The cavalcade crept slowly along, and gradually the landscape
showed symptoms of a change, the chines and ridges near the sea were of pure
white sand, whilst those farther back were high and covered with bushes. Upon
ascending one of these. Eyre obtained a good view, and, to his inexpressible
pleasure and relief, saw the high drifts of sand so anxiously looked for lying
ahead of them at about five miles' distance. But even now, when the
long-expected goal was in sight, it still seemed doubtful whether they could
save the horses, for so great was the heat that a halt was imperative. In
despair Eyre and Baxter looked around them to ascertain if no place was near
where water might be procured by sinking. A hollow was selected between the two
front ridges of white sand, and the boys called up to assist in digging. The
suspense increased every moment as the well deepened, under the pliant hands of
the natives. At five feet moisture commenced to show itself, and now the
supreme moment had arrived, for, were it salt, their last hope of saving the
horses was gone. It was tasted and pronounced fresh, but this intelligence was
too joyful to be implicitly believed, and again and again the damp sand was
subjected to the test, and in every instance the same verdict was returned.
With their hands, and with every available utensil, the boys now worked away;
by sinking another foot the question was put beyond all doubt, fresh sweet
water in abundance filled the well, and thus, on the seventh day of their
distress, when hope itself seemed almost extinguished, their earnest prayers to
God for assistance were heard; "And I trust," says Mr. Eyre in his diary, "that
in our deliverance we recognized and acknowledged with sincerity and
thankfulness His guiding and protecting hand."</p>
<p>The utmost caution was now necessary in ministering to the horses. They had
been seven days deprived of any fluid, and though the poor beasts were
suffering agonies, it was impossible to water them freely. Each animal
therefore was given only four gallons then, and the same quantity later on.
Gradually both men and beasts recovered from their trials, and by the 5th of
April the overseer and one boy were ready to go back for the stores that had
been abandoned forty-seven miles away. Mr. Eyre, thinking that they would have
severe exercise, generously gave them almost all the food he had with him;
consequently he and the two boys suffered severely from hunger, and were
compelled to eke out their daily half-pound of flour with pounded roots. In
addition to starvation, they were deprived of sleep at night by the cold, for
they were visited by severe frosts, and their clothing was of the scantiest. At
last the overseer returned, with the boy and a single horse. His dismal tale
was soon told. They had reached their destination on the 7th, but in returning
one of the three horses became blind, and, with his load, had to be abandoned.
A second horse had become unable to proceed, and both he and his load were left
behind; but this happening only a few miles from the camp, both were eventually
recovered.</p>
<p>Their position was now terrible indeed. They were still 650 miles from King
George's Sound, with barely enough provisions to last three weeks, at a very
reduced rate of allowance. Their cattle were so jaded that they could literally
scarcely crawl, and it was evident they would be unable to move on again at all
without many days of rest. By remaining in inactivity they were only consuming
their provisions, and the idea of abandoning the horses could not even be
entertained, for it had become evident that they must eventually have recourse
to killing the poor animals for food. Another journey of 150 miles without
water lay before them, but an equally arid tract lay in their rear; and Mr.
Eyre never once wavered in his opinion that to push on would be best. Baxter
differed from him on this point. The last desperate march had produced a strong
impression on his mind, and he could not divest himself of the idea that the
farther they went to the westward the more arid the country would be found, and
that eventually they should all perish from want of water. All arguments were
useless, but with characteristic fidelity and obedience he readily acquiesced
in any plan Mr. Eyre might decide upon adopting, and though he had just
returned from a severe journey, volunteered for the important and pressing duty
of recovering the stores which had been left behind. This, however, the leader
determined to undertake himself; and, accompanied by a black boy, set out on
foot; and in four days they returned, bringing on their backs such stores as
were absolutely necessary. During their absence Baxter had examined the country
ahead, and seemed quite discouraged at its appearance. Some fish that they had
speared disagreed with the whole party, and a horse was killed for food, on
which they fed until it became quite putrid, and both the Europeans were seized
with violent dysentery. During their helplessness the two elder native boys
stole the provisions and showed signs of disaffection, threatening to leave. In
vain Mr. Eyre attempted to reason with them; they could not understand the food
being economized; and at last, after breakfast on the 22nd April, they took up
the spears they had been preparing for the last two days, and walked sulkily
from the camp in a westerly direction. The youngest boy would have followed,
but as he was too young to know what he was doing, the leader detained him. In
three days the runaways turned up again and begged to be received, as they
found they could get nothing to eat for themselves. The King George's Sound
native expressed sorrow, but the other one sat silently and sullenly at the
fire.</p>
<p>On April 27th, after nearly a month spent in trying to restore the horses,
the camp was broken up, and the party once more proceeded, knowing that they
had at least 150 miles to traverse before they could again hope to meet water.
On the 29th Mr. Eyre intended to have travelled all night, to make up for a
compulsory halt during the day; but as the weather looked rainy, and the ground
was well adapted to catch any water that might fall, the overseer earnestly
begged him to stop, and, in opposition to his own judgment, he yielded. It was
blowing a gale, and the horses having been hobbled and turned out to feed, the
whole party proceeded to make break-winds of boughs before lying down for the
night. The overseer asked Mr. Eyre which watch he would prefer, and, not
feeling sleepy, he chose the first. At a little before six he went to look
after the horses, having previously seen Baxter and the natives reposing, each
at their respective break-wind, ten or a dozen yards apart from one another.
The arms and provisions, as was customary, were piled up under an oilskin
between the leader's break-wind and that of the overseer, with the exception of
one gun, which was always kept by Mr. Eyre's sleeping-place. This minute detail
is necessary, because of the fearful consequences that followed.</p>
<p>The night was cold, and the horses fed tolerably well, but rambled a good
deal, treading in and out among the belts of scrub, until the leader, who was
following them, hardly knew in which quarter the camp lay. At half-past ten he
headed them back, as he thought, in the right direction, to be ready to call
the overseer, whose watch commenced at eleven. Whilst looking steadfastly round
among the scrub to see if he could anywhere detect the embers of the fire, Mr.
Eyre was startled by a sudden flash, followed by the report of a gun, not a
quarter of a mile away. Thinking that the overseer had mistaken the hour of the
night, and had taken that method of attracting his attention, he hurried
towards the camp, and at about a hundred yards from it, he met the King
George's Sound boy (Wylie), who was running in great alarm and crying out, "Oh,
massa, oh, massa, come here!" In a few bounds the camp was reached, and there,
weltering in his blood and in the last agonies of death, the leader found his
faithful friend and companion Baxter.</p>
<p>Upon raising the body, the unfortunate man was found beyond all human aid; a
ball had penetrated his left breast, and but few minutes elapsed before he
expired in Mr. Eyre's arms. Then as he gazed speechless on the familiar face,
now still for ever, the awful, the appalling truth burst upon the survivor,
that he was alone in the desert. The faithful being who had for so many years
followed his fortunes, and whose attachment had induced him to enter on the
fatal journey, now lay cold and rigid at his feet. Small wonder that as this
rushed tumultuously through his brain, the strong man felt for a few instants a
wish to change places with the murdered form before him. The horrors of his
situation glared upon him in such startling reality, as for an instant almost
to paralyze the mind. At the dead hour of night, in the wildest and most
inhospitable wastes of Australia, with the fierce wind raging in unison with
the awful scene before him. Eyre was left with a single native, whose fidelity
he could not rely on, and who for aught he knew might be in league with the
other two, who perhaps were even then lurking about to take away his life, as
they had done that of his follower. It was three days since they had left the
last water, and it was very doubtful where any more would be found. Six hundred
miles had to be traversed before he could hope to obtain the slightest aid or
assistance, whilst he knew not if a single drop of water or an ounce of flour
had been left by the murderers, from a stock that had previously been so small.
Rarely indeed has a human being had to face a more terrible position.</p>
<p>On searching for his double-barrelled gun its place was found empty, and a
similar weapon that had belonged to the overseer was gone. These were the only
arms at the time in a serviceable condition, for though there were a brace of
pistols, cartridges were absent, and Mr. Eyre's rifle had become useless from a
ball sticking fast in the breech, which he had in vain endeavoured to extract.
A few days previous to their leaving the last water, the overseer had attempted
to wash out the rifle, not knowing it was loaded, and the powder being wetted,
it could neither be fired off, nor the ball got out. A small canvas bag
containing a little ammunition, which had been overlooked by the murderers in
their hurry, was at length found, and, retaining possession of this. Eyre
rushed away from the fearful scene, accompanied by Wylie, to search for the
horses, knowing that if they got away now, no chance whatever would remain of
saving their lives. With great difficulty they were found, for the wretched
animals had wandered to a considerable distance, and both men remained watching
them during the remainder of the night. Mr. Eyre thus describes
it:&mdash;"Every moment appeared to be protracted to an hour, and it seemed as
if the daylight would never appear. About midnight the wind ceased, and the
weather became bitterly cold and frosty. I had nothing on but a shirt and a
pair of trousers, and suffered most acutely from the cold; to mental anguish
was now added intense bodily pain. Suffering and distress had well-nigh
overwhelmed me, and life seemed hardly worth the effort necessary to prolong
it. Ages can never efface the horrors of this single night, nor would the
wealth of the world ever tempt me to go through similar ones again."</p>
<p>Daylight at length dawned, and on driving the horses back to the camp, a sad
and heart-rending scene presented itself. The corpse of the murdered man lay
extended on the ground, with the eyes open, but cold and glazed; whilst the
same stem resolution, and fearless open look, which had characterized him when
living, stamped the expression of his countenance in death. He had fallen upon
his breast four or five yards from where he had been sleeping, and was dressed
only in his shirt. In all probability, the noise made by the natives in
plundering the camp, had awaked him, and upon his jumping up with a view of
stopping them, they had fired upon and killed him.</p>
<p>All around lay scattered the harness of the horses, and the remains of the
stores that had been the temptation to the bloody deed. On examination, the
miscreants were found to have carried off the whole of the baked bread,
amounting to twenty pounds in weight, some mutton, tea and sugar, the
overseer's pipes and tobacco, a keg full of water, some clothes, two guns, with
nearly all the ammunition, and a few other small articles. There were still
left forty pounds of flour, a little tea and sugar, and four gallons of water.
Everything but the bare necessaries of life had now to be abandoned, and,
whilst a little bread was cooking. Eyre attempted to put the rifle&mdash;his
only serviceable weapon&mdash;in order. Unable to extract the ball, he resolved
to melt it out, and for that purpose took the barrel off the stock, and put the
breech in the fire, holding the muzzle in his hand. Buried in agonizing
thought, he was rudely recalled to himself by the explosion of the charge, and
the whiz of the bullet as it just cleared his head. The escape was miraculous;
but the gun was once more fit for use, and, carefully loading it, Mr. Eyre felt
a comparative degree of confidence and security, to which he had hitherto been
a stranger.</p>
<p>At last the horses had received their slender burdens, and nothing remained,
before proceeding, but to perform the last sad offices of humanity towards him
whose career had been cut short in SO untimely a manner. Even this duty was
rendered more than ordinarily painful by the nature of the country, one vast
unbroken surface of sheet rock extending in every direction, and precluding the
possibility of making a grave. The survivor could therefore only wrap a blanket
round the body of his comrade, and, leaving it enshrouded where it fell, escape
from the melancholy scene, accompanied by Wylie.</p>
<p>For all that day they travelled slowly and silently onward, the boy
preceding, leading one of the horses. Eyre following behind, and driving the
others. In the afternoon the attention of the leader was called by Wylie to two
white objects advancing towards them, which he at once recognized as the native
boys, covered with their blankets only. The horrors of the situation were now
multiplied, for their lives could at any moment be attempted by the murderers
in the thick scrub or during the night. With these bloodhounds on their trail
safety was at an end, for, with their usual improvidence, the natives would
soon devour the stolen provisions, and would then resort to another murder to
possess themselves of the remainder. But one resource was left to the leader by
which he might hope to save his own life and that of the black boy with him,
viz. to shoot the elder of the two, if they still persisted in following. He
halted, and endeavoured to enter into parley with them, with a view to
persuading them to return eastward, and thus obviate the necessity of taking
away the life of the elder, but they carefully avoided all close contact,
calling out incessantly to Wylie to come and join them. Time was too precious
to be wasted in vain attempts to reason with the murderers, so Eyre pushed on
according to the system of march he had adopted in the morning. When the
natives saw this, and found that Wylie would not desert his master, they set up
a wild and plaintive cry, still following in the brush parallel to the line of
route, and never ceasing in their importunities, until the denseness of the
scrub, and the closing in of night, concealed one party from the other. Eyre
now resolved to make a night march and outstrip the miscreants who were dogging
his footsteps, and in this he was completely successful, for, laden with the
stolen bread and water, they could never have kept up, and most likely camped
soon after sundown. Day after day he urged the jaded horses onward, and
finally, on the seventh day since leaving the last dep&ocirc;t, they again
found water, after haying crossed 150 miles of a rocky, barren, and
inhospitable tableland.</p>
<p>Having now got fairly beyond all the cliffs bounding the Great Bight, the
intrepid leader trusted that the greatest difficulties were overcome. The
vegetation of the country had undergone a decided change. Banksias abounded,
and the tracks of natives were numerous, though they kept themselves concealed.
It was to be hoped that no more fearful stages of 150 miles without water would
occur, but that they would be enabled to procure it once at least in every
forty or fifty miles, if not oftener. A strict watch was kept in case the two
boys should reappear, but they were never seen again, and there seems no doubt
whatever that they perished. At the time Mr. Eyre last saw them they were
sixty-three miles from the nearest water to the eastward, and eighty-seven from
the sand ridges where he was now camped. The stolen property would retard their
progress, and they would doubtless have consumed the keg of water they carried
with them, when they found its weight inconvenient, without the slightest
regard for the wants of the morrow. Then difficulties and distress would
gradually but certainly increase upon them; they would fling away their guns
and bread; and thus left in that awful desert, unarmed, and devoid of both food
and water, a dreadful and lingering death would terminate their existence,
their last moments embittered by the consciousness that their fearful condition
was entirely owing to their own treachery. Mr. Eyre, on calm reflection, finds
some extenuation for the boys. After all they were but savages, and the unlucky
opinions regarding the future, openly expressed by Baxter, doubtless had a
depressing effect upon them. Probably the thought of murder had never entered
their minds, and only when the ill-fated overseer awoke and found them engaged
in rifling the stores, did such a method of securing their retreat flash upon
them, unfortunately to be acted upon with fatal promptitude. The boys were old
servants of Eyre's, the elder having been with him two years and a half, the
younger more than four years, and that either of them should have planned a
wilful, barbarous, and cold-blooded murder, is hardly to be believed, more
particularly as no object was to be attained by it. The body of the murdered
man having been shot through the chest, many yards in advance of where he was
sleeping, showed that not until he had arisen from his resting-place, and
advanced towards them, was the fatal shot fired. This of course is at the best
but surmise, though it indicates clearly a love of justice in the breast of the
leader thus treacherously abandoned, and a repugnance to condemn even an
Australian black unheard.</p>
<p>From the 7th of May to the end of that month, the wanderers struggled
westward, meeting with water more frequently, but becoming daily weaker and
more emaciated. Horse-flesh, an occasional kangaroo, and fish were their sole
food, which produced excruciating pains in the white man, and little less
suffering to the black, from the reckless way in which he gorged himself. Some
idea of a native's appetite may be gathered from the following
extract:&mdash;"May 18th. Having seen some large kangaroos near our camp, I
sent Wylie with the rifle to try and get one. At dark he returned, bringing
home a young one, large enough for two good meals; upon this we feasted all
night, and for once Wylie admitted that his belly was full. He commenced by
eating a pound and a half of horse-flesh, and a little bread; he then ate the
entrails, paunch, liver, lights, tail, and two hind legs of the young kangaroo,
next followed a penguin, that he had found dead upon the beach, upon this he
forced down the whole of the hide of the kangaroo, after singeing the hair off,
and wound up this meal by swallowing the tough skin of the penguin; he then
made a little fire, and laid down to sleep and dream of the pleasures of
eating, nor do I think he was ever happier in his life than at that moment."
Mr. Eyre also tells the following curious anecdote, which illustrates admirably
the character of the blacks:&mdash;"During the day Wylie had caught two
opossums, and as these were entirely the fruit of his own labour and skill, I
did not interfere in their disposal. I was curious, moreover, to see how far I
could rely upon his kindness and generosity, should circumstances ever compel
me to depend upon him for a share of what he might procure. At night,
therefore, I sat philosophically watching him whilst he proceeded to get supper
ready, as yet ignorant whether I was to partake of it or not. After selecting
the larger of the two animals, he prepared and cooked it, and then put away the
other where he intended to sleep. I now saw that he had not the remotest
intention of giving any to me, and asked him what he intended to do with the
other one. He replied that he should be hungry in the morning, and meant to
keep it until then. Upon hearing this, I told him that his arrangements were
very good, and that for the future I would follow the same system also; and
that each should depend upon his own exertions in procuring food; hinting to
him that as he was so much more skilful than I was, and as we had so very
little flour left, I should be obliged to reserve this entirely for myself, but
that I hoped he would have no difficulty in procuring as much food as he
required. I was then about to open the flour-bag and take a little out for my
supper, when he became alarmed at the idea of getting no more, and stopped me,
offering the other opossum, and volunteering to cook it properly for me.
Trifling as this little occurrence was, it read me a lesson of caution, and
taught me what value was to be placed upon the assistance or kindness of my
companion, should circumstances ever place me in a situation to be dependent
upon him. I felt a little hurt, too, at experiencing so little consideration
from one whom I had treated with the greatest kindness, and who had been
clothed and fed upon my bounty for the last fifteen months."</p>
<p>On the last day of May, Mr. Eyre had a narrow escape of broken bones from a
horse jumping upon him, when he would have been in a dreadful position, and in
all probability must have perished. On the 2nd of June they saw two black
objects to seaward, and made them out, after much anxious watching, to be
whale-boats. Feeling sure that the vessel to which they belonged must be
somewhere in the neighbourhood, the horizon was keenly scanned in every
direction, and at last they were delighted beyond measure to perceive to the
westward the masts of a large ship peeping above a rocky island which had
heretofore concealed her from their view. The poor black boy's joy now knew no
bounds, and he leapt with delight at the prospect of plenty to eat. Mr. Eyre's
chief fear was lest she should disappear before they could get to her, or
attract the attention of those on board. Mounting the strongest horse, he
pushed on by himself as fast as the heavy nature of the ground would permit,
leaving Wylie to bring on the other animals. A short time brought him to a
rocky bay, opposite to which lay at anchor a fine barque, less than a quarter
of a mile from the shore. The people on board were busy, and did not at first
perceive the wanderer, but on his making a smoke and hailing, a boat was
instantly put off, and in a few moments he had the inexpressible pleasure of
being again among civilized beings, and of shaking hands with a
fellow-countryman in the person of Captain Rossiter, commanding the French
whaler "Mississippi", by whom they were both received with the greatest
kindness and hospitality.</p>
<p>For a fortnight Mr. Eyre and Wylie remained on board the friendly vessel,
the latter not a little amusing her crew by his capacity for eating, with the
exception of his first meal, when the immense number of biscuits he devoured,
and the marvellous rapidity with which they disappeared, not only astounded,
but absolutely alarmed them. During the whole of this time the weather was so
boisterous, cold, and wet, that with the scanty clothing remaining to them,
they could never have lived through it. It seemed indeed as though a kind
Providence had sent the weary men shelter when exposure would have carried with
it death. The French blacksmith shod the horses, and Captain Rossiter supplied
everything that was wanted to continue the journey. Nothing seems to have been
more kind than this gentleman's behaviour; he would receive no payment for the
twelve days his visitors had resided on board, and pressed many articles of
warm clothing and other little comforts on Mr. Eyre and his follower. Into the
remaining portion of this eventful journey I shall not enter. Rain now fell
heavily, and both men and horses suffered dreadfully from cold and rheumatism.
On the 7th July, amidst pouring rain, they ascended the hill that overlooks the
town of Albany. Not a living creature was in sight&mdash;not even an
animal&mdash;the place looked uninhabited, so completely had the inclemency of
the weather cleared the streets. Mr. Eyre could not but recall the party as
more than a year before it had set out, with horses, drays, and well-ordered
appointments. Two poor wanderers on foot only had reached the goal, and a tear
to the memory of those lost arose to his eye.</p>
<p>Such is briefly an account of the first attempt to pierce the centre of
Australia, and to open up communication between the western colony and her
southern sister. The account from beginning to end relates to nothing but a
miserable, arid, desolate region, where, as we have seen, even a native
perishes from thirst and starvation. Throughout the whole length of the Great
Bight not even the most paltry rivulet discharges itself into the sea.
Desolation reigns supreme. Mr. Eyre, however, by his indomitable pluck, cleared
up one point most satisfactorily, viz. that if the pastoral interests of South
and Western Australia made a land communication absolutely necessary, it was in
vain to look for it on the borders of the Great Bight. He had been foiled in
attempting to penetrate the interior; beyond vague conjectures nothing
concerning this enormous tract was known, and if a road was to be opened, it
became manifest that the mystery enveloping Central Australia should be cleared
up. How this was partially done will be shown in the following chapter.</p>

<h2><a name="ch-03" id="ch-03"></a>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p align="center"><small>Early explorations continued.&mdash;Discovery of
Victoria River.&mdash;<br>
Captain Sturt's journey.</small></p>
<p><small>IN</small> the meanwhile the work of exploration had been progressing
in the north. H.M. surveying ship "Beagle" discovered at the head of King's
Sound a fine freshwater river, named the Fitzroy, and her boats traced its
course for some twenty miles, returning only when their farther progress was
stopped by clusters of islands and d&eacute;bris, which choked the channel.
Soon afterwards the officers of the same vessel, while examining the coast
between Melville Island and the mainland, found another river of considerable
size named the Adelaide. At the head of Queen's Channel the features of the
coast gave promise of inland waters, and a party were despatched to verify
this. Captain Stokes, then a lieutenant in the "Beagle", thus describes the
excursion:&mdash;"Our preparations were rapidly made, a few days' provisions
were stowed away in the boat, and as the western sky glowed red in the expiring
light of day, the gig was running before a north-west breeze, for the chasm in
the distant highland, bearing S. 20 E. twelve miles from the ship. As we
advanced, the separations in the range became more marked and distinct, as long
as the light served us, but presently darkness wrapped all in impenetrable
mystery. Still we ran on, keeping close to the eastern lowland, and just as we
found that the course we held no longer appeared to follow the direction of the
channel, out burst the moon above the hills in all its glory, shedding a
silvery stream of light upon the water, and revealing to our anxious eyes the
long-looked-for river, rippling and swelling, as it forced its way between high
rocky ranges. Under any circumstances the discovery would have been delightful,
but the time, the previous darkness, the moon rising and spreading the whole
before us like a panorama, made the scene so unusually exciting, that I forbear
any attempt to describe the mingled emotions of that moment of triumph. As we
ran in between the frowning heights, the lead gave a depth of eighteen and
twenty fathoms, the velocity of the stream at the same time clearly showing how
large a body of water was pouring through. 'This is indeed a noble river!'
burst from several lips at the same moment. 'And worthy', continued I, 'of
being honoured with the name of her most gracious Majesty the Queen': which
Captain Wickham fully concurred in, by at once bestowing upon it the name of
Victoria River." The vessel herself ascended fifty miles up this fine stream,
while boat expeditions went considerably farther. Captain Stokes considered
that they had neither overrated its importance, nor acted hastily in calling it
the Victoria, and he compares it in importance to the Murray. That its
discovery gave rise to great excitement is undoubted, all who upheld the theory
of an inland sea fondly imagining that this was the channel by which its
drainage reached the ocean. We shall arrive at the real character of the
newly-found river when the course of this narrative brings us to Mr. Gregory's
explorations. Several other streams were discovered by the officers of the
"Beagle", amongst them the Flinders and the Albert in the Gulf of Carpentaria,
both of which lie too far eastward to claim any description in this volume.</p>
<p>The reader will see that hitherto exploration had tended rather to increase
the mystery in which the interior was wrapt than to throw any definite light
upon the subject. Eyre had proved that for 1500 miles no inland waters mingled
with the southern ocean. From the very beach perpendicular and inaccessible
precipices rose upward, as if to bar out the rash intruder. Where at intervals
this barrier receded, the thirsty desert rushed in to fill up the gap. The
Murray and Darling rivers, though draining the whole of the south-eastern
portion of the continent, were not in their whole course joined by any one
stream coming from the west or the north-west. Yet that country must have some
outlet for its waters other than evaporation. Where could such outlet be? This
was the question that Australians were day by day more anxious to solve. For
fourteen years Charles Sturt had been reposing after his splendid discoveries.
Now once again he buckled on his harness, and set forth resolute to conquer.
His theory regarding the interior will be best conveyed by quoting his own
words, nor need we have any scruple in laying before the reader the
speculations of all these eminent men regarding the dismal wilderness they so
nobly essayed to pierce&mdash;speculations which, though now proved to have
been in many cases erroneous, must still possess much interest both for the
geologist and for the general public. "I had adopted an impression", says
Captain Sturt,"that this immense tract of land had formerly been an archipelago
of islands, and that the apparently boundless plains into which I had descended
on my former expeditions were, or rather had been, the sea-beds of the channels
which at that time separated one island from the other. It was impossible,
indeed, to traverse them as I had done and not feel convinced that they had at
one period or the other been covered by the waters of the sea. It naturally
struck me that, if I was correct in this conjecture, the difficulty or facility
with which the interior might be penetrated would entirely depend on the
breadth and extent of these once submarine plains, which in such case would now
separate the available parts of the continent from each other, as when covered
with water they formerly separated the islands. This hypothesis, if I may so
call it, was based on observations which, however erroneous they may appear to
be, were made with an earnest desire on my part to throw some light on the
apparently anomalous structure of the Australian interior. No one could have
watched the changes of the country through which had passed with more attention
than did I&mdash;not only from a natural curiosity, but from an anxious desire
to acquit myself to the satisfaction of the Government by which I was
employed."</p>
<p>In the month of August, 1844, Captain Sturt and his party left Adelaide,
consisting of 18 men, including the leader and two natives, 11 horses, 30
bullocks, 200 sheep, and 6 dogs, besides drays and a boat. They proceeded up
the Murray and Darling rivers as far as some water-holes called Laidley Ponds,
and then struck across to the north-west for the Barrier Ranges, where the
leader hoped to find some practicable means of gaining the interior. On the
28th of December, after great hardship, the summit of the Barrier Range was
reached. If this had been of any great extent, it should have thrown off some
rivers running in a northerly direction&mdash;nay, the Victoria itself might
rise amongst these rugged hills. But no such welcome sight greeted the eyes of
the wanderers. The dark and unbroken line of the range lay to the south; to the
eastward were hills that had already been visited; whilst from the south-west
round to the east northwards, the whole face of the country was covered with a
gloomy scrub that extended to the very horizon. Leaving the main body of his
party camped on a fast-failing creek, Sturt with three men pushed to the
northward. Some flat-topped hills appeared and were visited. Their geological
formation was perfectly new, being composed of indurated or compact quartz;
neither did they resemble in character ranges, properly so called, but were a
group of flat-topped hills, similar to those figured by Flinders and other
navigators. Some were altogether detached from the main group, not more than
two-thirds of a mile in length, with less than a third of that breadth, and an
elevation of between three and four hundred feet. These detached hills were
perfectly level at the top, and their sides declined at an angle of 54&deg;.
The main group appeared to consist of a number of projecting points, connected
by semicircular sweeps of greater or less depth. There was no vegetation on the
sides either of the detached hills or of the projecting points, but they
consisted of a compact white quartz, that had been split by solar heat into
innumerable fragments in the form of parallelograms. Vast heaps of these laid
at the base of the hills, and formed a great resemblance to a town ruined by an
earthquake. On proceeding, Sturt and his companions found themselves in a
perfect desert. At first the scrub was broken at intervals by sandy flats, but
soon the formation changed, and the sand ridges succeeded each other like waves
of the sea; no sooner had they descended one than they were ascending another,
and the heat between them was fearful. Hitherto grass had been abundant, now
not a blade could be seen; no vegetation but the dreadful spinifex, through
which they found difficulty in forcing their way, and some bushes of acacia,
cassia, casuarina, &amp;c., which had leaves only at the termination of their
upper branches, the underleaves having dropped off, withered by the intensity
of the heat. On attaining the summit of a small eminence a vast extent of
desolation without any break met the view, nor was there the slightest
indication of a change in the country.</p>
<p>To attempt to go farther in that direction would have been folly, and the
explorer resolved on returning to his main camp. Had any hills broken the
gloomy horizon, he would have held his course; none such presented itself, and
he was fain to retrace his steps. This must have been the more bitter to him,
as he thought that they could not be very far from the outskirts of an inland
sea, so closely did the wretched country resemble a low and barren
sea-coast.</p>
<p>On returning, Captain Sturt was hailed with the good news that an ample
supply of water had been found by Mr. Poole, the second in command, in a rocky
glen near their present camp, and to this they at once removed. The
Dep&ocirc;t, as their new site was termed, was established on the 27th January,
1846, and their tents were not again struck until the 17th July following. The
reader will doubtless wonder at so prolonged a period of inactivity, but his
astonishment will increase when he learns its cause&mdash;Sturt, his men, his
cattle, and his horses, were prisoners, confined to that lonely glen by an
agency more powerful by far than any bolts or bars forged by human hands. It
was long before the leader could bring himself to realize the misfortune that
had overtaken his party, and not until every creek in the neighbourhood had
been run down, and the country searched carefully in all directions, did the
truth flash across his mind that they were locked up in that desolate and
heated region as effectually as though they had wintered at the Pole. In
whatever quarter they sought egress the same insurmountable barrier presented
itself&mdash;the total absence of water. What would have been their fate had
not Providence conducted them to this one oasis in the howling wilderness that
surrounded them seems too horrible to contemplate. That they would have
perished, both men and cattle, is undoubted; perished, and by that most fearful
of deaths&mdash;thirst. The dep&ocirc;t was shaded by large trees and by high
cliffs, notwithstanding which the party suffered terribly from the intense
heat. The mean of the thermometer for the months of December, January, and
February was 101&deg;, 104&deg;, and 101&deg; respectively in the shade. Under
its effects every screw in their boxes had been drawn, and the horn handles of
their instruments, as well as their combs, were split into fine laminae. The
lead dropped out of their pencils, owing to the shrinking of the wood; the
signal-rockets, a most valuable item in the equipment of the expedition, were
entirely spoiled; their hair, as well as the wool on the sheep, ceased to grow,
and their nails became brittle as glass. Nor was personal inconvenience all the
mischief wrought by this fiery atmosphere, for it was found to reduce the
provisions alarmingly. The flour lost more than eight per cent, of its original
weight; the bran in which their store of bacon was packed became perfectly
saturated, and weighed almost as heavy as the meat; they were obliged to bury
their wax candles, to save them from running into a shapeless mass; even a
bottle of citric acid became liquid, and, escaping, burnt some linen; whilst it
was with the utmost difficulty that they could either write or paint, so
rapidly did the fluid dry in the pens and brushes. During the whole of this
trying period the leading-members of the expedition never ceased in their
attempts to find some means of escaping from this oven. To east, west, north,
and south they rode, the heated stirrup-irons blistering their feet, and the
horses reeking with perspiration though never put beyond a walk. At last
Captain Sturt was seized with violent headaches, pains in the joints, a coppery
taste in the mouth, and sponginess of the gums&mdash;scurvy had attacked him,
and both Mr. Poole, the second in command, and Mr. Browne, the doctor, were
also suffering from this dread disease. What care was displayed for the men
under their command by these gallant gentlemen may be gathered from the fact
that the officers alone were stricken. The men lived on fresh mutton, and were
in comparative idleness; the officers were exposed without respite, and whilst
absent their only diet was salt bacon.</p>
<p>On the 11th of May a most curious incident occurred. During the afternoon
Captain Sturt was aroused by the dogs springing up simultaneously and rushing
across the creek, their continued barking indicating that they had brought
something to bay. It was soon discovered that their quarry was a solitary
native, who contended manfully against his formidable antagonists. The dogs
were called off and the wanderer conducted to the camp, where, after drinking
copiously and eating ravenously, he coiled himself up in a blanket and went to
sleep. He was an elderly man, dreadfully emaciated, and half dead from hunger
and thirst. Where this desert waif arrived from, why he was thus alone, without
companion, kith, or kin, the explorers were unable to divine. His whole
behaviour was surprising, for he exhibited no curiosity at the novelties by
which he was surrounded, but remained calm and self-possessed, as though
determined not to be betrayed into the slightest display of fear or timidity.
After a few days he became quite communicative; and now comes the most
extraordinary part of this episode. On seeing the boat, he appeared perfectly
aware of its use, intimating that it was turned upside down, and pointing to
the <i>north-west as the quarter in which she should be used</i>. He mistook
the net in which the sheep were penned for a fishing-net, and explained that in
those waters were found fish so large that they would be unable to escape
through the meshes. It appeared to Captain Sturt quite clear that he was aware
of the existence of a large expanse of water somewhere or other to the
northward and westward, for he conveyed that waves higher than his head broke
upon the shore, and recognized several of the seafish figured in Cuvier's
works, as well as the turtle. He expressed his readiness to accompany the
expedition when rain fell, though this, he intimated, would not be for some
time. No wonder the leader was elated at this unexpected confirmation of his
surmises, and that he longed more than ever for the rain which would unlock his
prison doors. At the end of a fortnight the old black&mdash;who had been fed on
crows, which he preferred to mutton, and had picked up wonderfully in
condition&mdash;left the camp, with the promise of returning speedily; and from
the careful way in which he concealed the different little articles that had
been presented to him, there seemed every reason to suppose he would have done
so; but he was never seen again, and Captain Sturt thinks that the poor old
fellow perished from want of water in endeavouring to return to his
kindred.</p>
<p>The leader's journal vividly describes their position after his departure.
"With him all our hopes vanished, for even the presence of that savage was
soothing to us, and so long as he remained we indulged in anticipations as to
the future. From the time of his departure a gloomy silence pervaded the camp.
We were indeed placed under the most trying circumstances&mdash;everything
combined to depress our spirits and exhaust our patience. We had gradually been
deserted by every beast of the field and every fowl of the air. We had
witnessed migration after migration of the feathered tribes to that point to
which we were so anxious to push our way. Flights of cockatoos, of parrots, of
pigeons, and of bitterns, birds also whose notes had cheered us in the
wilderness, all had taken the same high-road to a better and more hospitable
region. The vegetable kingdom was at a stand, and there was nothing either to
engage the attention or attract the eye. Our animals had laid the ground bare
for miles around the camp, and never came towards it but to drink. The axe had
made a broad gap in the line of gum trees which ornamented the creek, and had
destroyed its appearance. We had to witness the gradual and fearful diminution
of the water, on the possession, of which our lives depended. Day after day we
saw it sink lower and lower, dissipated alike by the sun and the winds. From
its original depth of nine feet it now scarcely measured two, and instead of
extending from bank to bank, it occupied only a narrow line in the centre of
the channel. Had the drought continued for a month longer than it pleased the
Almighty to terminate it, that creek would have been as dry as the desert on
either side."</p>
<p>Meanwhile Mr. Poole was getting weaker and weaker, and suffering greatly.
Except to visit him. Captain Sturt and Mr. Browne now rarely left their tents.
During May and June there was no indication of a break in the weather, though
it had been bitterly cold during parts of that period, the thermometer
descending to 24&ordm;. At last, on the 12th of July, the wind veered from east
to north, and at noon a gentle rain set in. It had been decided that Mr. Poole
should be sent back, and on the 14th, the day appointed to carry him, he was
able to move. The parting between the companions was very painful, and the poor
invalid wept bitterly at the last moment. On the evening of the 17th the man
who had been told off to look after Mr. Poole, came into camp with the sad news
of his death. The body was brought back to the dep&ocirc;t and buried under a
grevillia tree; the initials J. P. and the year 1845 alone mark the lonely spot
where the explorer is at rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Piesse and two men were sent back to the civilized districts with
despatches, and the leader, with his now reduced party, pushed on sixty miles
in a north-west direction and established another dep&ocirc;t, named Fort Grey.
A more westerly direction was now taken, and after crossing a most desolate
country, with sand ridges that resembled lines of dead brick walls, further
progress was checked by an immense shallow and sandy basin, dry immediately
opposite to the party, but containing broad sheets of water both to the
southward and northward, of a deep indigo hue, and as salt as brine. This was a
portion of the everlasting Lake Torrens, that had baffled Mr. Eyre, but Captain
Sturt was to the north-east of it, and escaped being shut in by its horseshoe
bend. By the temperature of bailing water here the surface of the lake was
shown to be below sea-level, so none of its drainage can flow into the southern
ocean.</p>
<p>Determined to make a bold push for the interior, Captain Sturt returned to
Fort Grey, and made preparations to set out, accompanied only by Mr. Browne and
three men; for he had satisfied himself that from the nature of the country, to
venture into it with the whole party, would be in the highest degree imprudent.
The position of Fort Grey was lat. 29&deg; south, and long. 141&deg; east, and
by steering north-west he trusted to gain the 138th meridian about the centre
of the continent, and felt sure that if there were any mountain chains or
ranges of hills to the westward, connected with the north-east angle of the
continent, he would by this route discover them. On the 14th of August the
little party started, carrying fifteen weeks' provisions; the men at the
dep&ocirc;t had made a strong stockade, in case of an attack by the natives,
and the last order given by the leader was that the boat should be thoroughly
repaired, and a good coat of paint given her, in case her services should be
required. At first the country was very bad, though better than it had been in
the immediate neighbourhood of Lake Torrens, but gradually it assumed a more
cheerful aspect, box trees appearing with grass growing under their shade. The
spirits of the party rose proportionately, and the leader and Mr. Browne even
ventured to indulge in pleasing anticipations. Suddenly their hopes were
annihilated, for before them rose a wall of sand, lying directly across their
course, and over which they had to toil for twenty miles, each ridge assuming a
steeper and more difficult character. Upon ascending an eminence to view the
country, the prospect was most disheartening. An immense plain stretched from
the south round to the eastward of north, and upon this abutted and terminated
sand ridges such as they had just traversed, like so many headlands running
into the ocean; for from the point on which they stood, the dark purple waste
appeared perfectly level. A line of low trees stood far away towards the
north-east, otherwise the plain was devoid of vegetation, and its horizon was
like that of the ocean. Towards the point the leader wished to proceed, nothing
was to be seen but this stone-clad plain, forbidding, arid, and boundless.
Undeterred by the desolation before him, Sturt boldly entered this wilderness
on the 26th, and travelled twenty miles into it before halting. A closer
inspection proved it to be undulating, with shining hollows in which it
appeared water sometimes collected. The ground was covered so thickly with
stones as to exclude all vegetation, and the stones themselves were peculiar,
ranging from one to six inches in length, rounded by attrition, and coated with
oxide of iron. In going over this dreary waste the iron-shod hoof of the horses
left no track, and that of the cart was only visible at intervals. From the
spot on which the adventurous men camped, no object of any kind broke the line
of the horizon, they were as much dependent on a very unsteady compass as they
would have been in an open boat in the midst of the Atlantic ocean; and
although the little patch of soil on which they pitched their tent was not more
than a few yards square, and produced little or nothing to eat, the horses,
unhobbled and free as they were, shrunk aghast from the stony wilderness, and
made no attempt to wander on the adamantine plain. On the following day the
journey was continued, and the course kept by taking the bearings of any slight
object in front. After ten painful miles there was a sensible fall in the Stony
Desert, and now a feature of totally different character presented itself
Before them lay an earthy plain, as bare as its predecessor, and resembling a
boundless piece of ploughed land, on which floods had settled and subsided.
Over this the weary horses toiled all day, their riders not knowing whether
they were getting out of the waste or plunging deeper into it. About an hour
before sunset a line of hills showed above the horizon, and, inspirited by
this, they pulled up for the night at a little water, and mounted some dwarf
box-trees to examine the distant mountains, failing, however, to make out
whether they were rock or sand. At this bivouac there was not a blade of grass
for the horses, who were fastened to the three solitary trees, at whose dry
bark they gnawed all the night long. At early dawn the party started, and at
last arrived within a mile and a half of the hills. A small rise was eagerly
ascended to survey them more distinctly. Then they revealed themselves in their
hideous nakedness. Sand ridges stood before them, sand ridges as bare and
desolate as those they had left fifty miles behind. Bitterly disappointed, the
leader ascended the nearest, and found it flanked on either side by other hills
that terminated in the ploughed plain, as those before seen terminated in the
Stony Desert.</p>
<p>It will now be desirable to quote somewhat at length from Captain Sturt's
journal, for he here advances a hypothesis regarding this desolate region, that
it would be wrong to overlook. The sand ridges met with before, on the
south-east side of the desert, were running at an angle of about 18&deg; to the
west of north, having gradually changed from the original direction of about
6&deg; to the eastward of that point. "I myself", he writes, "had marked this
gradual change with great interest, because it was strongly corroborative of my
views as to the course the current I have supposed to have swept over the
central parts of the continent must have taken, i.e. a course at right-angles
to the ridges. It is a remarkable fact that here on the northern side of the
desert, and after an open interval of more than fifty miles, the same sand
ridges should occur, running in parallel lines at the same angle as before,
into the very heart of the interior, as if they absolutely were never to
terminate. Here, on both sides of us, to the eastward and to the westward, they
followed each other like the waves of the sea in endless succession, suddenly
terminating&mdash;as I have already observed&mdash;on the vast plain into which
they ran. What, I will ask, was I to conclude from these facts? That the wind
had formed these remarkable accumulations of sand, as straight as an arrow,
lying on the ground without a break in them for more than ninety miles at a
stretch, and which we had already followed up for hundreds of miles; that is to
say, across six degrees of latitude? No! winds may indeed have assisted in
shaping their outlines, but I cannot think that these constituted the
originating cause of their formation. They exhibit a regularity that water
alone could have given, and to water, I believe, they plainly owe their first
existence. It struck me then, and calmer reflection confirms the impression,
that the whole of the low interior I had traversed was formerly a seabed, since
raised from its submarine position by natural though hidden causes; that when
this process of elevation so changed the state of things as to make a
continuous continent of that which had been an archipelago of islands, a
current would have passed across the central parts of it, the direction of
which must have been parallel to the sandy ridges, and consequently from east
to west, or nearly so, <i>that</i> also being the present dip of the interior,
as I shall elsewhere prove. I further think that the line of the Stony Desert
being the lowest part of the interior, the current must there have swept along
it with greater force, and have either made the breach in the sandy ridges now
occupied by it, or have prevented their formation at the time when, under more
favourable circumstances, they were thrown Tip on either side of it. I do not
know if I am sufficiently clear in explanation, finding it difficult to lay
down on paper all that crowds my own mind on this subject; neither can I,
without destroying the interest my narrative may possess, now bring forward the
arguments that gradually developed themselves in support of the foregoing
hypothesis." Captain Sturt now became doubtful of the immediate proximity of an
inland sea, though many circumstances combined to strengthen the impression he
entertained that such a feature had existed on the very ground over which they
had made their way.</p>
<p>Gloomy as the prospect in front seemed, the leader was unflinching in his
determination to go forward. As the sand ridges lay nearly parallel to their
course, they rode up a kind of valley, and at some distance arrived at a forest
of box, through which they pushed their way, the ground beneath the horses'
feet being destitute of vegetation, and the soil composed of the whitish clay
peculiar to the flooded lands of the interior. Birds of many kinds now awoke
the echoes with their cries, and astonished the travellers by their number and
variety. This looked promising, for as may easily be imagined during the last
few days, not a feather had been seen, and they were soon gratified by coming
to a large creek, the bed of which was dry and clothed with couch grass.
Expecting momentarily to open out a pond, they rode on, and seeing two
magnificent trees growing in the creek, they approached them and found a native
well of unusual dimensions, twenty-two feet in depth, and eight in breadth at
the top. Here they camped and were watched with dismay by the birds coming for
water, who crowded the trees; and the reader may judge how scarce was the
precious element, when he learns that they dived into the dark well to procure
it. Though Sturt would gladly have rested here for a few days, the scanty
supply of water drove him forward. On emerging from the forest a plain was
entered, whose surface, subject to floods and exposed to a vertical sun, was
absolutely so torn and rent by solar heat, that there was scarcely room for the
horses to tread, and their hind feet were constantly slipping into chasms from
eight to ten feet deep, into which the earth fell with a hollow, rumbling
sound, as if into a grave. With much difficulty this abominable flat, which
extended for six miles, was got over, and a creek reached with a shallow pond
and plenty of grass. Here a halt was made for the day, two of the party being
unwell, and the horses swollen and griped. Pursuing their journey for several
days over sand ridges and flats, the leader was cheered by arriving, on the 4th
September, at a fine creek containing both grass and water, which he named
after Mr. Eyre. Beyond this the country was wretched in the extreme; close and
matted spinifex, to avoid which the wearied horses were obliged to lift their
feet straight up, and a species of mesembryanthemum formed the only vegetation;
the ridges extended in parallel lines beyond the range of vision, to the north,
to the east, and to the west. The sand was of a deep red colour; and a bright
narrow line of it showed out from amidst the sickly vegetation, marking the top
of each ridge. Familiar as they were with similar scenes, Sturt records that
his companion uttered an exclamation of amazement on first beholding it. "Good
heavens!" said he, "did ever man see such a country?" They were now thirty-four
miles beyond Eyre Creek, and the water was decreasing every day. Mr. Browne was
seriously ill, he seldom spoke, and his hands were constantly employed in
pressing or supporting his back, to give some small relief to the pain he
suffered; day by day the leader dreaded that his companion would sink as Mr.
Poole had done, and, in addition to this, the three men were very unwell. They
were 400 miles from the dep&ocirc;t, with a fearful return journey before them.
All that man could do, Sturt and his gallant companions had done nobly. Both
water, food, and health had failed them, and there remained no alternative but
to turn back, a course which the brave leader reluctantly adopted. He had
penetrated much farther into Central Australia than any man had hitherto done.
When his advance was stopped he had attained lat. 24&deg; 40' S. and long.
138&deg; E., being within one degree of the tropic of Capricorn, and 150 miles
of the central point of the Continent. When it is remembered that the object of
the expedition was limited by the Home Government "to ascertaining the
existence and the character of a supposed chain of hills, trending down from
N.E. to S.W., and forming a great natural division of the Continent", it must
be acknowledged that he completed his arduous task nobly and fully, clearing up
beyond the possibility of doubt, the non-existence of such a dividing range.
Such a chain of mountains would entirely change the peculiar character of the
Australian climate; and had they attained as great an altitude as even the
snow-clad Alps lying at the south-east corner, their peaks would have caught
the clouds, precipitating them in genial showers; noble rivers, to which the
Darling and Murray would have been but as stagnant drains, would have found
birth in their recesses, rolling downward to the south and west rich alluvial
deposits, and turning into one giant cornfield the dismal wilderness on which
countless sand ridges now lay their forbidding length. In one word, a lofty
dividing range would have made Australia the richest country in the world. It
is absent, and in consequence the curse of desolation lies over the whole
interior.</p>
<p>It is unnecessary to follow Captain Sturt any farther in his explorations.
He returned to the dep&ocirc;t, and, after resting, started off afresh,
discovering Cooper's Creek, beyond which he encountered his old enemies, the
sand ridges. He mentions the effect of a hot N.E. gale. The blasts of heat were
so terrific that he wondered the grass did not fire. This was nothing ideal,
for everything, both animate and inanimate, gave way before it; the horses
stood with their backs to the wind, and their noses sunk upon the ground,
without the muscular strength to raise their heads; the birds sat upon the
boughs mute and terrified, and the parched leaves fell like snow; whilst a
thermometer graduated to 127&deg; burst its tube, owing to the expansion of the
mercury. Before fresh supplies reached them, the leader had lost the use of his
limbs from scurvy; his skin became black and the muscles contracted. At length,
on the 19th of January, 1846, the gallant band were once more safely at home,
after seventeen months of hardship and adventure; and all eventually recovered
their health and strength.</p>

Gregory's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expedition.&mdash;McDouall Stuart's journey across the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continent from Adelaide.</small></p>
<p><small>IN</small> the same year Sir Thomas Mitchell was working towards the
interior, and advanced within 260 miles of Cooper's Creek. Kennedy pushed on
farther still, gaining a point within a hundred miles of Sturt's extreme
position on that creek. Leichhardt had made a successful expedition into the
N.E., crossing Arnheim's Land, and eventually reaching Port Essington. He now
bent his steps again into the wilderness, proposing to traverse the Continent
from east to west. In 1847 he quitted Moreton Bay with provisions for two years
and a half. Twenty-seven years have now elapsed, and no trace of the party has
ever been discovered. Many search expeditions have been sent out to try and
solve the mystery, but all have returned unsuccessful. There are not wanting
people at this day in Australia who think he may still survive&mdash;an old
man&mdash;held in captivity by the blacks. This is highly improbable. Central
Australia accomplishes its work, whether by drought or by flood, too completely
to leave any reasonable hope that any of the ill-fated expedition escaped. If
the former and more lingering fate befell them, some traces may still be found
in years to come; if the latter, the swollen waters will have hurried away
every Vestige, and not the smallest clue to the tragedy will ever be
forthcoming.</p>
<p>The next expedition with which we are concerned in this volume is that of
Mr. Augustus C. Gregory, in 1855, commonly called the North Australian
Expedition. The reader will remember the discovery by Stokes of a noble river
on the north coast, named the Victoria. Mr. Gregory's object was to penetrate
the interior by means of this river, an enterprise which had as yet remained
unattempted, though most sanguine hopes of the key to the desert being
eventually found in this direction were entertained by many scientific and
practical men. This was the first real effort made from the north, and
possesses peculiar interest to us, from Colonel Warburton's expedition passing
within a very few miles of the farthest point attained by Gregory in 1856.</p>
<p>The party, consisting of eighteen, left Moreton Bay on the 12th of August,
1855. They were in two vessels, a barque and a small schooner named the "Tom
Tough", the latter of which was to remain at the leader's disposal. Proceeding
through Torres Straits, the two vessels reached Treachery Bay in the middle of
September, when the barque, having fulfilled her mission, departed, and the
schooner, with eight of the party, sailed for the Victoria River, where they
had orders to await Gregory, who, with the remaining nine men, took the
overland route. Of the fifty horses originally embarked at Moreton Bay, nine
had been either drowned in landing, or died on the voyage, and the remainder
were much weakened by confinement. On the 6th of October the party started,
and, crossing the McAdam range, arrived on the 10th at the Fitzmaurice River.
Whilst camped here, the horses betrayed much restlessness at night, and when
day dawned it was ascertained that they had been attacked by alligators, and
three of them severely bitten and scratched. On the 16th the Victoria was
sighted, but the descent was so steep that it could only be accomplished by
forming&mdash;with great labour&mdash;a path for the horses, in which chasms
had to be filled up, and huge rocks removed, or rather toppled over with
levers, when they thundered down into the valley beneath. On gaining the
river-bank the "Tom Tough" was not to be found. At last it was discovered that
the schooner had got ashore on a nasty ledge of rocks, and was in a very
dangerous condition. She had leaked considerably, and a large quantity of
stores had been destroyed or damaged; whilst the mischief was much increased by
the supply of water on board failing, owing to which all the sheep but about
fifty had died of thirst. However, when 1856 was only three days old, they got
fairly away, and followed the course of the Victoria for upwards of a hundred
miles. The country varied, the river sometimes running through fine, grassy
plains, but more commonly through a rocky gorge, from 600 to 800 feet in depth,
cut in the tableland, which here averaged 1000 feet above sea-level. The
Victoria, which had been diminishing in size as they proceeded, forked into two
branches in lat. 16&deg; 26' S., each of which was carefully followed up until
it shrank into a little rivulet, and then died out. Thus ended the stream that
its first discoverers had compared to the Murray, and from which so much
benefit had been expected. Like most of the coast rivers, it drained a tract of
country running a couple of hundred miles inland, and then totally disappeared.
In lat. 18&deg; 11' S., the country commenced to slope towards the southward in
the shape of one uninterrupted desert, with an unbroken horizon, the vast plain
being clothed with just sufficient spinifex and brush to hide the red sand when
seen at a distance. No practicable route appearing to the southward, the leader
decided on following the northern limit of the desert to the west, until a
break of some kind should occur, and then branching off again on his old course
south. On February 22nd a fine creek was reached, which was named after Captain
Sturt, and its waters keeping a general south-west course, hopes of at last
having found a path into the interior were raised. But as they journeyed
onward, its fair promise died out in desolate plains, on which only brackish
water was to be found; and once more the desert stood, in all its hideous
monotony, before them, Mr. Gregory thus describes it:&mdash;"Nothing could have
been more forbidding than the long, straight lines of drift sand, which, having
nearly an east and west direction, rose beyond each other like the waves of the
sea, and though the red glare of the sand was partially concealed by a scanty
growth of triodia (spinifex), the reflection from its surface caused the
passing clouds to be coloured a deep purple. We had long passed the limit to
which the tropical rains of the north-west coast extend, and the country south
of 19&deg; seemed only to be visited by occasional thunderstorms; thus, for a
few miles the grass would be fresh and green, then there would be a long
interval of dry, parched country, where no rain appeared to have fallen for
twelve months. The channel of the creek also decreased in size, and the
frequent occurrence of salicornia indicated the saline nature of the soil; the
water became brackish, then salt, and finally spread out and terminated in the
dry bed of a salt lake, a mile in diameter, which communicated with a second of
larger size, nine miles long and five miles wide. Though now quite dry, there
were marks of water having stood for considerable periods ten to fifteen feet
deep, as the shells of mussels, in their natural position, were abundant more
than a mile from the ordinary bank of the lake, showing that a large tract of
country is sometimes inundated. As the mussels are a species which live in
fresh water, it is evident that at such times the lake is not salt; but it
would appear that as the waters evaporate and recede they become saline, as the
shells found within the limits of the lake were of other species, which affect
brackish or salt water." The leader now travelled east for the purpose of
discovering any outlet to the waters of this lake, and, after passing through a
forest of acacia, entered the sandy desert. Some low, rocky hills were visible
to the east, for which he steered, and ascended the highest, which was barely
eighty feet above the plain, and formed of sandstone in horizontal strata. From
the summit of this hill nothing was visible but one unbounded waste of sandy
ridges and low, rocky hillocks. All was one inhospitable desert, as the flat,
sandy country which absorbed the waters of the creek and lakes was incapable of
originating water-courses. On this miserable little mound Gregory bestowed the
name of Mount Wilson, and it marks the farthest point towards the interior that
the North Australian Expedition reached. It became evident to the leader that
they had arrived at one of those centres of depression for which Australia is
remarkable, where the waters of the surrounding country, collecting in wet
seasons, are so rapidly evaporated in the dry seasons which usually intervene,
that they alternately assume the character of shallow lakes and dry mud plains.
Gregory was naturally bitterly disappointed at the promising waters of Sturt
Creek not guiding him to any important outlet of the waters of the interior. It
was the first water-course encountered which trended towards the south, and it
seemed reasonable to suppose that it would either gather strength from
tributaries, or add its quota to some larger river. He and his party followed
it for more than 300 miles, and it ended&mdash;in salt lakes and sandhills. It
had, however, served them to a great extent; for, without it, they could never
have made so much southing. Gregory had approached within 730 miles of Captain
Sturt's farthest point, by starting from the opposite side of the Continent.
Both had been baffled by precisely similar country&mdash;by countless ridges of
red sand; and it is not a little singular that both gentlemen make use of the
same simile regarding these phenomena, likening them repeatedly to "waves of
the sea". Mr. Gregory and his party headed north again, and made many
interesting discoveries before arriving at the settled districts on the east
coast. Amongst other things they found an old camp of the lost explorer,
Leichhardt, in which the ashes of the fire were still visible, and a great
number of goat's bones scattered around. A large tree was marked with the
letter L and the word DIG; but a hollow in the ground showed that whatever had
been deposited was removed, for, on clearing out the earth, nothing could be
found. This portion of his narrative, being confined to the Gulf of Carpentaria
and the parts of Queensland between Port Denison and the Burnet River, need not
be entered upon here; but before taking leave of this expedition it may be well
to mention one very important fact discovered by Gregory, viz. that the
northern country traversed by him much exceeds in altitude the depressed basin
visited by Sturt&mdash;the salt lake near Mount Wilson being more than 800 feet
above the level of the Stony Desert. This proves that the land slopes towards
the south, and that did any rivers, or an inland sea, exist, they would find an
outlet in this direction. That there is no such outlet. Eyre, by travelling
round the Great Bight, sufficiently proved.</p>
<p>The next explorer whose tracks the reader is invited to follow, is Mr. John
McDouall Stuart, whose splendid discoveries opened out a line across the
Continent from Adelaide to the Indian Ocean, who in some measure dissipated the
idea that the whole of the interior was a desert, and along whose route now
runs the electric telegraph, reaching from Port Darwin to the capital of South
Australia, by means of which all important events happening in England are
known a few hours later at the Antipodes, and the mother country and her
distant offspring brought into daily&mdash;nay, into hourly communication.</p>
<p>Mr. Stuart had formed one of the party in Sturt's attempt to penetrate the
interior described above, being draughtsman to the expedition. Undeterred by
the desolation he then witnessed, and being generously assisted by Messrs.
Chambers and Finke, Mr. Stuart made three several expeditions in the vicinity
of Lake Torrens, discovering much valuable pastoral country, a large tract of
which was presented to him by the South Australian Government. But these
journeys, which were performed in the years 1858, 1859, were only preparatory
to a longer flight. Since the time when he had accompanied the "Father of
Australian Exploration", Sturt, into the sandy desert, the great dream of Mr.
Stuart's life had been to penetrate the interior. Through the liberality of his
friends he was enabled to equip an expedition&mdash;small indeed, for it
consisted but of two men&mdash;Kekwick and Head&mdash;besides himself; and with
this slender following and thirteen horses, he left Mr. Chambers' station on
March 2nd, 1860. The country which he now traversed, is the same that Colonel
Warburton passed through on his way to Alice springs, and if given somewhat at
length here, it will be merely for the purpose of avoiding recapitulation
hereafter.</p>
<p>A fortnight after starting, a sad accident befell the explorer. The horse
that was carrying his instruments broke away from the man who was leading him,
burst the girths, and threw the saddlebags on the ground. On examination, the
instruments were found to be very much damaged, in fact nearly ruined. When the
immense utility of a sextant on a journey such as this is considered, the
mischief wrought by the mishap may be understood. In long. 135&deg;, on the
Neale River, good country was found, with saltbush and a plentiful supply of
grass. Following this to the north-west, a scrubby country was encountered,
through which they had much difficulty in forcing their way, and only did so at
the expense of their packs and saddlebags, which were torn almost to pieces by
the stubborn brushwood. Unable to extricate themselves from this, the course
was altered to north-east, when five miles brought them to the junction of
three creeks, the water in one still running. Following one of these towards
the north, an open country was reached with a little saltbush; but an immense
quantity of green grass, growing above a foot high, which gave the scene a most
beautiful appearance. During the whole day this continued, and Mr. Stuart says
in his diary, "The whole of the country we have travelled through today is the
best for grass I have ever gone through; I have nowhere seen its equal." How
different is this from the desolation encountered by Sturt! and yet they were
in the same latitude as the Stony Desert, which lay only four degrees to the
eastward. On the following day the course had to be altered repeatedly to avoid
the mulga (<i>Acacia aneura</i>) scrub, which gave them a great deal of
trouble; but fine holes of standing water were discovered, with numerous plants
growing on their banks, amongst others, wild oats four feet in height; and
again it is stated, "The country gone over today, although stony, was
completely covered with grass and saltbush; it is even better than that passed
yesterday. Some of the grass resembled the drake, some the wild wheat, and some
the rye." On the 1st day of April Mr. Stuart, whose eyes had been inflamed for
a long time, found that his right eye had become useless to him in taking
observations with the patched-up sextant, for he saw two suns instead of one.
Shortly afterwards a splendid creek was reached, with fine gum trees of all
heights and sizes, and here a new kind of parrot was found, together with
cockatoos and numerous other birds. This beautiful water-course was named by
Stuart after Mr. Finke, his sincere and tried friend, and one of the liberal
supporters of the exploration. After leaving it, they passed over a plain of as
fine a country as any man would wish to see&mdash;a beautiful red soil covered
with grass a foot high. "I have not", says the leader, "passed through such
splendid country since I have been in the colony." On the 6th April a most
remarkable hill was seen, which at a distance had the appearance of a
locomotive engine with its funnel. On reaching this, it proved to be a pillar
of sandstone, standing on a hill upwards of 100 feet high. From the base of the
column to the top was about 150 feet, its breadth twenty feet, and its depth
ten. The summit was divided into two small peaks, and from the shaft being
quite perpendicular, it formed a most prominent object in the landscape, and
"Chambers' Pillar", as it was called by its discoverer, will always remain an
unmistakeable landmark to the traveller. Two days more brought the little party
to another fine creek named the Hugh, and here a low but very tedious range was
encountered, the scrub being so thick that the horses could with difficulty be
brought to face it, and the course intercepted by deep perpendicular ravines,
which they were compelled to round, having their saddlebags torn to pieces, and
their skins and clothes in the same predicament. Travelling onward, the
McDonnell Range was reached, the country being very good for pastoral purposes.
Stuart had now reached the same latitude as Sturt's furthest advance into the
interior in 1845, which lay east of him about five degrees. But what a
different country he had travelled through! His difficulties had been many; but
the route by which he had arrived so far, was as a land flowing with milk and
honey compared to the sterile desert that had foiled his old leader. The feed
for the horses had been exceedingly good, and the supply of water abundant;
indeed, on glancing at his map, the number of springs therein delineated is
most remarkable.</p>
<p>Moving onward towards the north, nothing occurred of importance until
Sunday, 22nd April, when we find the task that so many brave men for years past
had been attempting, was at length achieved, and this great deed is inserted in
Mr. Stuart's diary with so much simplicity and modesty, that it had best be
given in his own words:&mdash;"Today I find from my observations of the sun,
111&ordm; 00' 30", that I am camped in the centre of Australia. I have marked a
tree and planted the British flag there. There is a high mount about two miles
and a half to the north-north-east&mdash;I wish it had been in the centre; but
on it tomorrow I will raise a cone of stones, plant the flag there, and name it
Central Mount Stuart.</p>
<p>"<i>Monday, 23rd April, Centre</i>.&mdash;Took Kekwick and the flag, and
went to the top of the mount, but found it to be much higher and more difficult
of ascent than I anticipated. After a great deal of labour, slips, and knocks,
we at last arrived at the top. It was quite as high as Mount Serle (discovered
by Eyre in 1840), if not higher. The view to the north is over a large plain of
gums, mulga, and spinifex, with water-courses running through it. The large
gum-creek that we crossed winds round this hill in a north-east direction; at
about ten miles it is joined by another&mdash;after joining they take a course
more north, and I lost sight of them in the far-distant plain. To the
north-north-east is the termination of the hills; to the north-east, east, and
south-east are broken ranges, and to the north-north-west the ranges on the
west side of the plain terminate. To the north-west are broken ranges, and to
the west is a very high peak, between which and this place to the south-west
are a number of isolated hills. Built a large cone of stones, in the centre of
which I placed a pole with the British flag nailed to it. Near the top of the
cone I placed a small bottle, in which there is a slip of paper with our
signatures to it, stating by whom it was raised. We then gave three hearty
cheers for the flag, the emblem of civil and religious liberty, and may it be a
sign to the natives that the dawn of liberty, civilization, and Christianity is
about to break upon them! We can see no water from the top. Descended, but did
not reach the camp till after dark. This water still continues, which makes me
think there must certainly be more higher up. I have named the range John
Range, after my friend and well-wisher, John Chambers, Esq., brother to James
Chambers, Esq., one of the promoters of this expedition."</p>
<p>Can the reader imagine with what feelings of gratification this simple entry
must have been made by the explorer on returning to his tent after the fatigues
of that eventful day? There is something so inexpressibly touching in these two
solitary Englishmen rearing their nation's flag and raising their voices to
salute it, that though some portions of the above extract refer only to the
surrounding country, it would be doing injustice to our countrymen to abridge a
single word recorded on that day by the gallant leader.</p>
<p>Another hill about two miles from Mount Stuart was named Mount Esther, after
the lady whose fair fingers worked the flag now floating in the breeze. A rose
of a beautiful description was also found, having thorns on its branches, a
sweet strong perfume, and a seed-vessel resembling a gherkin; the native orange
also abounded. I mention this to show that however desolate the surrounding
region may be, the centre of the continent itself is by no means wanting in
vegetation.</p>
<p>Having followed Mr. Stuart thus far over a tract of country nearly all of
which was subsequently travelled by Colonel Warburton and his party before
striking to the westward, a very cursory sketch of his further proceedings must
suffice. Central Mount Stuart lies in latitude 22&deg; south, and the little
party pushed their way north as far as latitude 18&deg; 41' south, when the
natives became so threatening that they were compelled to return homeward,
being too weak numerically to set the savages at defiance. After two months'
rest the explorer started off again with a party numbering twelve men and
forty-nine horses. They advanced a hundred miles north of the leader's farthest
point in the previous year, but a barrier of impenetrable scrub barred the way,
and provisions failing, they were again compelled to head south. Stimulated
rather than depressed by these repeated failures, in December, 1861, he once
more took the field with a party of ten men, and this time, though not without
encountering many difficulties from the dense scrub, the hostility of the
natives, and from sickness, his pluck and perseverance were rewarded, and he
stood on the shores of the Indian Ocean. The latter part of his journey is most
interesting, and its capabilities may be estimated by the following description
from the pen of the great explorer himself:&mdash;"Judging from the experience
I have had in travelling through the Continent of Australia for the last
twenty-two years, and also from the description that other explorers have given
of the different portions they have examined in their journeys, I have no
hesitation in saying that the country that I have discovered on and around the
banks of the Adelaide River is more favourable than any other part of the
continent for the formation of a new colony. The soil is generally of the
richest nature ever formed for the benefit of mankind; black and alluvial, and
capable of producing anything that could be desired, and watered by one of the
finest rivers in Australia. This river was found by Lieutenant Helpman to be
about four to seven fathoms deep at the mouth, and at 120 miles up (the
farthest point he reached) it was found to be about seven fathoms deep, and
nearly 100 yards broad, with a clear passage all the way up. I struck it about
this point, and followed it down, encamping fifteen miles from its mouth, and
found the water perfectly fresh, and the river broader, and apparently very
deep; the country around most excellent, abundantly supplied with fresh water,
running in many flowing streams into the Adelaide River, the grass in many
places growing six feet high, and the herbage very close&mdash;a thing seldom
seen in a new country. The timber is chiefly composed of stringybark, gum,
myall, casuarina, pine, and many other descriptions of large timber, all of
which will be most useful to new colonists. There is also a plentiful supply of
stone in the low rises suitable for building purposes, and any quantity of
bamboo can be obtained from the river from two to fifty feet long. I measured
one fifteen inches in circumference, and saw many larger. The river abounds in
fish and waterfowl of all descriptions. On my arrival from the coast I kept
more to the eastward of my north course, with the intention of seeing farther
into the country. I crossed the sources of the running streams before alluded
to, and had great difficulty in getting more to the west. They take their rise
from large bodies of springs coming from extensive grassy plains, which proves
there must be a very considerable underground drainage, as there are no hills
of sufficient elevation to cause the supply of water in these streams. I feel
confident that if a new settlement is formed in this splendid country, in a few
years it will become one of the brightest gems in the British Crown. To South
Australia and some of the more remote Australian colonies, the benefits to be
derived from the formation of such a colony would be equally advantageous,
creating an outlet for their surplus beef and mutton, which would be eagerly
consumed by the races in the Indian Islands, and payment made by the shipment
of their useful ponies, and the other valuable products of those islands;
indeed, I see one of the finest openings I am aware of for trading between
these islands and a colony formed where proposed." Mr. Stuart was also of
opinion that a herd of horses could be taken across the continent at any time,
for although during his journey he was not fortunate in meeting with
thunder-showers or rain, yet he was only two nights without water. In
consequence of the favourable report thus made, the Northern territory was
annexed to South Australia by commission under the Great Seal bearing date 8th
July, 1863, a settlement was founded, and now, as mentioned before, the
telegraph-line follows the route opened by the indomitable energy of John
McDouall Stuart, and through him hundreds of thousands of fertile acres have
been added to the land of his adoption, South Australia.</p>

<p align="center"><small>Explorations of Mr. Frank Gregory from the West
Coast</small></p>
<p><small>BEFORE</small> Stuart set out on his last successful expedition the
news reached Adelaide of the sad fate of Messrs. Burke and Wills, who, after
accomplishing the journey from Melbourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria, had
perished from starvation on Cooper's Creek, where their dep&ocirc;t had been
formed, and where they had looked forward to a termination of their sufferings.
This fearful page in the history of Australian exploration cannot be entered
upon here, neither can we follow Mr. McKinlay in his arduous journey from sea
to sea&mdash;for both expeditions traversed ground to the eastward of the 135th
meridian, and therefore to the east of the boundary chosen as separating the
eastern and western halves of the continent&mdash;the reader therefore will
only be asked to follow a brief sketch of Mr. Frank Gregory's explorations in
North-west Australia.</p>
<p>Aided by both the Imperial and Colonial Governments, and also by private
subscriptions, Mr. Gregory&mdash;a brother of Augustus Gregory, whose
explorations on the Victoria River have been already described&mdash;took the
field in April, 1861, sailing from Perth in a small vessel named the "Dolphin",
and arriving at Nichol Bay, to the southward and eastward of the Dampier
Archipelago, about the middle of May. The party consisted of nine men and
twenty horses, all of which were successfully landed by the 21st, and four days
afterwards the expedition got fairly away. Their course at first lay towards
the south-west, but a large river named the Fortescue was soon struck, and this
stream having its source to the south-east, it was resolved to follow it up.
The travelling now became very fatiguing, owing to the stony nature of the bed,
which was also full of huge rocks that materially impeded the progress of the
party. As they advanced the country improved; deep pools became more
continuous, and grass abundant; but the water-worn rocks frequently jammed the
horses into narrow passes, from whence they could not be extricated without
meeting with severe falls; their shoes also soon became loose or wrenched off,
so they made small headway each day, the desolate nature of the country without
the valley of the river compelling them to continue in its bed. On the 5th of
June the valley narrowed, until the channel of the river was walled in on both
banks by perpendicular cliffs, and farther progress was checked in that
direction. A range of hills had been seen for the last two days to the south,
running parallel with the river, and for this the leader now struck; but
finding it was impossible to cross the chain, he again made for the Fortescue,
hitting it some distance farther east, and finding that it had opened into deep
reaches of water containing abundance of fish of large size. A few miles
further on it broke up into a number of small channels in an open, grassy
plain, and was lost as a river. Another attempt to find a pass through the
Hammersley Range failed, but the main bed of the Fortescue was once more
encountered, and, following this up, the mountains that had so long opposed
their passage were left behind. Whilst the party formed a camp, Mr. Gregory
climbed the hills to get a view of the country in advance. A laborious ascent
of nearly an hour brought him to one of the highest summits of the range, at an
elevation of about 2700 feet above the sea, and 700 feet above the bed of the
river. From this point he saw fair hope of succeeding in pushing south, and
reaching a large extent of open level plain in that direction. On descending to
the camp, he accidentally dislodged with his foot a fragment of rock of several
tons weight, and to his horror the leader saw it rushing with fearful velocity
towards the deep gorge in which the horses were feeding. After carrying all
before it for a quarter of a mile, it made a clear spring over a cliff two
hundred feet in depth, and plunged into the waters below with a sound like
thunder, leading the people at the camp to suppose that a large portion of the
cliff had fallen. Fortunately, it did not frighten the horses enough to produce
a stampede, as a similar occurrence had done once before. Pushing on in a
general southerly direction, Mr. Gregory met with two rivers, named by him
respectively the Hardey and the Ashburton, and at length he came within sight
of Mount Augustus, on the Lyons River, discovered by him three years before,
and having thus joined the two surveys he returned to the "Dolphin" to recruit,
the horses being too much worn to attempt farther eastward exploration in their
present condition. The journey back was not over the old ground, for after
leaving the Hammersley Ranges Mr. Gregory struck north-west, and discovering
the Sherlock River, reached Nichol Bay from the eastward on the 19th July, the
horses all suffering fearfully, many of them almost hoofless.</p>
<p>On the 29th of July the explorers set out again with nineteen horses and
eighty-seven days' rations, reaching their old camp on the Sherlock four days
afterwards. Here they had been compelled to abandon a horse whose hoofs were
worn quite through, and though the water and feed were both abundant, the poor
brute had never stirred; mortification had probably set in, and the body was
found, half devoured by crows and native dogs. Gregory now struck eastward,
despite the information elicited from a native that no water lay in that
direction. With two companions only, he searched for an available route, and at
last found a river about 300 yards wide, in which were a few pools of water,
and, following it up, a gorge in a granite range was reached with sufficient
grass to supply all the horses, and splendid lakes, a quarter of a mile wide,
teeming with water-fowl. This river was named the Yule, and to it the rest of
the party were brought forward. Still going eastward, and meeting with a
variety of country with which I shall not trouble the reader, the rivers
Strelley and Shaw were discovered; and on the 27th of August a river was
reached which received several tributaries, and formed a stream of some
importance. This was named the De Grey, in honour of Earl De Grey (now the
Marquis of Ripon) who was formerly President of the Geographical Society. Still
bent on making towards the east, Gregory and his party advanced, passing
through such stony, bad country that some of the horses were disabled, and
three of the party had to take their turn on foot. Though the horses were sadly
in want of rest, the season was too far advanced to venture on incurring any
delay, and still the east course was maintained. At length the country opened
out into an extensive plain of white waving grass&mdash;to the north
uninterrupted by a single elevation; while to the east and south, at eight or
ten miles distant, rose ranges of granite hills, capped with horizontal
sandstones. At the opposite edge of the plain they came upon a river 200 yards
wide, running to the northward. The long drought had reduced it to a few
shallow pools, running from one to the other through the deep sand in the bed;
but the scenery in its vicinity was most beautiful&mdash;grassy plains,
extending to the distant horizon, and the banks of the stream itself overhung
by the graceful foliage of the cajeput, or tea-tree (<i>Melaleuca
leucodendron</i>). This river was named by Gregory the Oakover.</p>
<p>For two days the party followed the channel of this stream; but, finding it
turned too much towards the west, they left it and entered the range, getting
through it only to emerge upon open sandy plains of vast extent, no object
being observable from N.N.E. round to S.S.E. except low ridges of red
drift-sand, in many parts nearly bare of vegetation. Into this wilderness
Gregory attempted to penetrate, and entered the sand-plain, travelling between
the ridges, which ran in straight lines, parallel to each other, at the
distance of several hundred yards apart, the sand being thrown by the
south-east gales into acute ridges, thirty to sixty feet high, their direction
being almost invariably N. 109&deg; E. They got over eighteen miles of this
miserable waste, the valleys yielding little else but triodia, with occasional
patches of stunted gum-forest, where was scattered a little good grass. No
water could be found, no change in the features of the country were observable
ahead; so Gregory was obliged to have recourse to the expedient of falling back
and forming a dep&ocirc;t, and in doing this they were compelled to abandon a
horse.</p>
<p>On the 5th of September, leaving the party to rest, the leader walked twelve
miles along the foot of the range in search of water, and to ascertain if a
better line of country could be found in that direction; but the same aridity
continued to display itself, and he only found one pool, in a gully about four
miles from the camp. Thus disappointed, Gregory started off on the following
day with only Messrs. Brown and Harding, taking six of the strongest horses,
sixteen days' rations, and six gallons of water, and having instructed the
party left behind to remain in their present camp for three days, and then fall
back upon the Oakover. The leader and his two companions steered S.S.E. along
the ranges for several miles, looking for some stream bed that might lead
through the plains; but these all disappeared within a mile of the hills.
Crossing the ridges proving, most fatiguing to the horses, they determined to
run eastward between the sand-waves, which they did for fifteen miles, when,
the animals again showed signs of failing, and they were compelled to make for
some deep rocky gorges in the hills ten miles to the south, which involved
their meeting the ridges at right-angles and climbing them. This course,
however, presented the least risk, and was adopted, though only four out of the
ten miles were accomplished before the horses gave in, and they were compelled
to halt for the night. At daylight on the following morning three gallons of
water were divided amongst the horses, and the party started off, hoping to
reach the ranges by noon; but they had hardly gone three miles when one of the
pack animals failed, though carrying a load of only forty pounds' weight, and
this was transferred to the leader's saddle-horse. Even when thus relieved, the
worn-out horse could only stagger a couple of miles farther, when they were
compelled to abandon him, leaving him under the shade of the only tree that
they could find. Gregory, seeing that many hours would be occupied in bringing
the horses to the hills, started ahead on foot, directing his companions to
come on slowly, while he was to make a signal by fires in case of finding
water. Two hours' heavy toil through the burning sand, under a vertical sun,
brought him to the ranges, but ravine after ravine was hunted without success,
and at five in the afternoon no water had been found. For twelve hours, on a
scanty breakfast, and without a drop to wet his parched lips, the leader had
been walking, with the thermometer over 100&deg; of Fahrenheit, and when he
rejoined his companions, who were anxiously awaiting him, it was as much as he
could do to carry his rifle and accoutrements. The horses were in a miserable
plight, and it became evident that, in case of not finding water, the only
chance of saving them lay in abandoning the pack-saddles, provisions, &amp;c.
They therefore encamped for the night on the last plot of grass they could
find, and made arrangements for an early start in the morning. A few pints of
water were still left in the keg, and this enabled the weary men to recruit
their strength with a little tea and damper.</p>
<p>At four o'clock they were afoot, and having suspended in a large tree the
whole of their equipment, except the riding-saddles and firearms, and having
divided a pint of water amongst them for breakfast, early dawn found them
driving their famished horses before them towards the dep&ocirc;t, now
thirty-two miles distant. For the first eight miles they got on pretty well,
but the moment the fierce sun commenced to pour down its fiery rays, the
animals flagged greatly, and they were soon obliged to relinquish another,
quite unable to proceed. By nine o'clock the leader found that the severe
exercise of the previous day, combined with the small allowance of food, were
beginning to tell upon him, and that it was probable he could not reach the
dep&ocirc;t until next morning, by which time the party left there were to fall
back to the Oakover; he therefore directed Mr. Brown, who was somewhat fresher
than himself, to push on for the camp, and to bring out fresh horses with
water, whilst Mr. Harding and Gregory would do their best to bring on any
straggling horses that could not keep up with him. The anxiety of the leader
must indeed have been terrible, for their lives hung solely on the chance of
Brown reaching the depot before night. The men left there would start for the
Oakover the first thing in the morning, and if this happened, the doom of the
three adventurers was sealed; they would surely die, would perish miserably of
starvation. Brown soon shot ahead, and the other two struggled onward, and by
dark had succeeded in reaching to within nine miles of the dep&ocirc;t, finding
unmistakeable evidence towards evening of the wretched condition to which the
horses taken on by their companion were reduced, by the saddles, guns, hobbles,
and even bridles scattered along the line of march, which had been flung aside
to enable them to go on a few miles farther. At dawn the two men arose from
their beds of sand, stiff and giddy, though much refreshed by the cold night
air. Without assistance they must soon have given in; flesh and blood could not
stand another day without water in that burning oven. But happily relief was at
hand, and they had not toiled more than half the distance that still separated
them from the dep&ocirc;t, when their eyes were gladdened by the sight of Mr.
Brown bringing fresh horses and a supply of water. He had struggled on
gallantly, and had reached the camp at eight o'clock on the previous evening,
with one horse only, the remainder having knocked up and been abandoned, one by
one, towards the close of his eventful journey. This gentleman followed their
back tracks, for the purpose of recovering the articles thrown away the
previous evening. These were all picked up, but the stores left at the granite
range were too distant to be attempted, and are probably still mouldering
beneath the tree wherein the explorers placed them. Three of the horses were
also recovered, but the two first abandoned were never seen again. Mr. Gregory
remarks upon the singular effects of excessive thirst upon the eyes of the
horses. "They absolutely sunk into their heads, until there was a hollow of
sufficient depth to entirely bury the thumb in it, and there was an appearance
as though the whole of the head had shrunk with them, producing a very
unpleasant and ghastly expression." On taking into consideration the reduced
number and strength of the horses, it became evident to the leader, that any
attempt to cross the wilderness, that had already caused them so much loss and
trouble, would be useless. He gives the following reasons for supposing that
some great river was in his immediate neighbourhood, and I extract the passage
<i>verbatim</i> from his journal, as demonstrating the opinions held by an
observant man and an intrepid explorer, on the features of the
interior:&mdash;</p>
<p>"Not only had we now attained within a very few miles of the longitude in
which, from various geographical data, there are just grounds for believing a
large river may be found to exist, draining Central Australia; but the
character of the country appeared strongly to indicate the vicinity of such a
feature; added to which the gradual decline in the elevation of the country,
notwithstanding our increasing distance from the coast, tended towards the same
conclusion. Nor should we omit the strong evidences that the remarkable ridges
of drift-sand which encumbered the plains must, in the first instance, have
been brought from the interior by water, and then have been blown by the strong
prevailing south-east winds across the country, in a direction at least 50&deg;
from that which they originally came from. This, with the clean, water-worn
appearance of the sand, the bold outlines of the hills seen to the far east,
and the number of native fires observed in the same direction, must all tend to
support the hypothesis that the western half of Australia is probably drained
by a large river in about this meridian. I could not, therefore, help
regretting more than ever, that we should be driven back at such an interesting
spot; but mature reflection convinced me that any further attempt, with our
present means, at this period of the year, was almost certain to be attended
with the most disastrous results." Mr. Gregory accordingly fell back on the
Oakover, ran that river down until it was joined by the De Grey, and traced the
latter to its mouth at Breaker Inlet. After exploring the Strelley, he returned
to Nichol Bay with his party, where the "Dolphin" lay at anchor awaiting them;
and on the 17th of October they re-embarked, and reached the Swan River in
safety on the 9th of November. This exploration was eminently useful to Western
Australia, opening out for her children many fine rivers, thousands of acres of
good pasture-land, and conclusively showing that that portion of the continent
was not of the villainous character that had hitherto been ascribed to it.</p>
<p>Several other explorers made attempts to penetrate to the eastward from
Western Australia; but the general features of the country proved it unfit for
settlement.</p>
<p>This brief outline will enable the reader to understand how much had been
performed by the principal pioneers in the western half of the continent. We
have followed Sturt until a sea of sand checked his progress; we have seen the
brothers Gregory, one striking from the north, the other from the north-west,
both brought to a standstill by the same obstacle; and of the arid nature of
the country bordering the Great Bight, Mr. Eyre's terrible journey has
sufficiently taught us. On the other hand, we have Stuart discovering a
wonderful belt, running due north and south through the very centre of the
continent, by means of which the communication between the two seas has been
rendered comparatively easy. Diverge from it fifty miles east or west and the
sand ridges in all their hideous uniformity are before the traveller. Colonel
Egerton Warburton availed himself of Stuart's route until he gained the centre
of the continent, and then struck boldly into that terrible western desert of
which his predecessors had given so appalling a description.</p>

<p class="margin2"><small>Introduction of camels into Australia: their value in
journeys<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of exploration.&mdash;Project of an expedition across the interior<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the central line of telegraph.</small></p>
<p><small>NOTWITHSTANDING</small> the many attempts and the partial successes
we have recorded, it was generally felt by the Governments and colonists, both
of South and Western Australia, that the Western interior still remained to all
intents and purposes a <i>terra incognita</i>. Public attention continued
steadily fixed on this point, some people surmising that good country still lay
there unknown, others wishing the matter cleared up for the advancement of
science. The attention of the Government was constantly directed towards the
desirability of effecting this important discovery by many of its leading
citizens, pre-eminent among whom stood Mr. Thomas Elder, a wealthy inhabitant
of Adelaide, and a member of the Legislative Council for South Australia; and
Mr. Walter W. Hughes, a large sheep-owner and an influential inhabitant of the
same colony. The disinterested generosity and the public spirit displayed by
both these gentlemen are beyond all praise, and their names will always be
remembered by their fellow-colonists with respect and gratitude as the
initiators and promoters of Colonel Egerton Warburton's memorable expedition
into the interior.</p>
<p>A most important element in the eventual success of the enterprise was the
introduction of camels into Australia. Without these animals no such journey as
that of Colonel Warburton could under any possibility have been successfully
accomplished.</p>
<p>The first idea of employing the camel in Australian exploration seems to
have originated with a member of the Royal Geographical Society, for we find
Sir Roderick Murchison, in his address to that body in
1844,<sup><small>1</small></sup> saying, "Others again say, with our member,
Mr. Gowen, that a thorough exploration of the interior of Australia will never
be effected until we import thither camels from our eastern possessions, and
thus at once get rid of the vast difficulties attending the want of water." The
suggestion seems to have borne fruit, for in 1846 we hear of a camel
accompanying Mr. Horrocks on an expedition in South Australia. Messrs. Burke
and Wills, as well as McKinlay, had a few of these animals with them on their
journeys, but they seem never to have been very plentiful until Mr. Elder
conceived the idea of introducing them on a large scale. In 1866 a gentleman
named Stuckey was despatched to India by Mr. Elder for the purpose of
purchasing a number of camels and asses. Out of 124 of the former shipped at
Kurrachee, 121 were landed in South Australia in perfectly good condition;
three were lost on the voyage from cold, which produced inflammation of the
lungs. They bore the confinement of the passage remarkably well, in fact from
being too liberally supplied with native grass, hay, and the chaff of rape and
of wheat, they became so fat that it became necessary to place them on a
shorter scale of diet. Their allowance of water consisted of from two to three
gallons each daily. No dressing or bedding was used, simply coir matting nailed
upon the deck to prevent their feet from slipping; neither were partitions of
any kind necessary, the docile animals lying or standing quietly side by side,
fastened only by the head. After landing, the camels commenced rapidly to
increase, but an epidemic attacked them, a kind of mange, by which disease more
than seventy were swept away. The Afghan drivers, some dozen in number, who had
accompanied their animals, stated that this complaint was common to the camel
in its own country, and that it could be cured by means of oil extracted from
certain shrubs. But none of the requisite specific could be found in Australia,
and a grave objection to the importation of camels seemed likely to present
itself, for the sudden loss of so large a number at one fell swoop was a
serious matter. The luxuriant feed seemed to encourage the disease, and a
remedy was looked for in vain. At length it was proposed to apply Stockholm tar
externally, and to administer the same ingredient mixed up with oil,
internally; and the experiment was attended with the happiest effects, the
Afghans themselves pronouncing it far superior to the native medicines. It was
found that the Australian vegetation was admirably adapted to the camels, in
fact they seemed to thrive better in barren than in rich districts. From the
height and long neck of these animals they are enabled to feed upon the bushes
which form their natural food at a distance from the ground far above the reach
of horse or bullock, and therefore they can live and flourish where either of
the latter would infallibly starve; for though grass is frequently a scarce
commodity in the bush, yet the most sterile tracts are commonly clothed with
scrubby shrubs. Their digestion being wonderfully strong, no green food comes
amiss to them. Saltbush, prickly acacia, sandalwood, mulga, she-oak, all are
devoured with apparent relish, and if really hungry they will not flinch from
mallee, wattle, gum, or as far as is yet known from any tree that grows. In
fact it seems ascertained beyond a doubt that camels will thrive, and perform
heavy work where any other beast of burden would be sure to starve.</p>
<p><small>[<sup>1</sup> Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. xiv. p.
cii.]</small></p>
<p>Another merit possessed by these animals must not be overlooked. From the
peculiar construction of the stomach they are able to pass several days without
water, and suffer no great inconvenience from the privation. With this
characteristic of the camel every child is familiar, but perhaps it is not so
generally known that though they all possess this capability, yet training is
necessary to develop it fully. A camel not accustomed to abstinence would
neglect to husband the store contained within it, and would soon show symptoms
of distress; while another, inured to privation, would make a march of several
days without suffering.</p>
<p>Mr. Elder imported camels of three different breeds; namely, the fast or
Mekrana camel for riding purposes; the hill camel from Scinde, suitable for
riding or baggage, being the common camel of Western India; and the hairy camel
from Candahar, fine, strong, thickset animals, eight, nine and ten feet high,
the best kind for heavy loads. The female breeds about four times in five
years, and gives a large quantity of beautiful milk, allowing herself to be
handled like a cow. At four years of age the young camel sheds two teeth and
continues this each year like the sheep, until the seventh, when it is full
mouthed, with eight teeth. At ten years it is in its prime, it may then be
likened to a four-year-old horse, and it continues in good working condition
for thirty years longer. But little trouble is necessary to break camels in.
They are handled when quite young, and are capable of bearing a light load at
three years old. Mr. Elder's herd was accompanied by Afghan camel-drivers who
were accustomed to the animals from their boyhood, and hence has arisen an
impression that Europeans are unequal to their management. This is entirely a
mistake. A colonist can learn to handle camels in a few weeks, and with
patience will manage them as well as an Afghan; but he must remember that a
drove of camels require widely different treatment from a team of bullocks. The
harsh shout and the whip employed in driving the latter must be entirely cast
aside, and a system of kindness substituted. The most remarkable feature in the
management of camels by the native drivers is the entire absence of punishment.
They never beat them, and have impressed their fellow bushmen with a wholesome
dread of the dire consequences that would follow the use of the stick. Mr.
Stuckey considers them the most docile of animals. The result of several years'
experience has shown him that vice occurs less often with camels than with
ordinary stock, and that the only reason why Europeans cannot manage them is
the want of patience and experience. They are exceedingly sure of foot, and
will travel over the most rugged places without inconvenience. The only
difficulty in the way of rearing and breeding camels <i>ad libitum</i> is that
paddocks are necessary to prevent them wandering in every direction; for,
unlike other stock, they neither herd nor attach themselves to any particular
place or part of the country. The native drivers are quite right in warning
white men not to irritate the camel by ill-usage, for when excited to anger he
becomes a terrible antagonist, and his attack is likely enough to end fatally
for any man who is the object of it. His strength, long neck, height, weight,
and tremendous teeth or tusks make it almost impossible to beat him off
single-handed, and he has an ugly habit of suddenly dropping on his knees upon
the body of a prostrate enemy, which tends very much to reduce the chance of
the latter escaping with life; indeed those most familiar with them, say, that
in an open plain, escape from an infuriated camel is impossible. One great
inconvenience in using camels in Australia is to be found in the difficulty of
familiarizing horses and bullocks to their presence or neighbourhood, and in
the terror with which they always inspire these animals at first sight. The
colonial horses can hardly be called timid, yet it is stated, that however long
a time one of them may have worked or fed beside camels, he is certain to make
a bolt, if one of the latter fairly faces him, and will often do so if only
looked at unexpectedly. This, however, must not be regarded as insurmountable,
for in India and Africa they undoubtedly work in company.</p>
<p>Regarding the capability of Mr. Elder's camels for burden, on one occasion a
string of more than sixty travelled with an average load of 600lbs. of wool
each, making from seventeen to eighteen miles per diem, and enduring four and
five days' thirst easily. A heavy camel carried an Afghan with the mail 350
miles in a week; and Mr. Stuckey rode from Puttapa to Umberatana, a distance of
eighty miles, in one day, and thinks that 400 miles might easily be
accomplished in five days on a riding camel. The latter travel at from seven to
ten miles an hour for many hours together, but during hot weather they do not
travel so well in the heat of the day as at night. At Port Augusta on one
occasion, and in consequence of a bet between the men as to what one of the
camels&mdash;a large one, seven years old&mdash;could do, ten bags of flour, or
2000lbs., were placed upon its back when kneeling, and it rose and carried this
load without difficulty round the camp. The same animal drew six dead camels
nearly a mile over sand, one at a time, with only a rope round its neck, and it
has frequently drawn a sixty-gallon bucket from a whip-well. These instances
will give some idea of the power of the camel both for burden and draught. The
following extract from "McKinlay's Tracks" will show the reader the opinion
formed of the camel on that expedition:&mdash;"McKinlay took four camels, in
company of a goodly quadrupedal assemblage, consisting besides of twenty-four
horses, twelve bullocks, and a hundred sheep. The camel disputes with the horse
the palm of usefulness in the Australian expeditions. In powers of endurance
the camel seemed quite the equal of his rival, but he was more unruly and
troublesome, and very uncompanionable with the other animals, his
fellow-travellers. McKinlay found a decided convenience in the height of his
back, as compared with that of the horse, in keeping the supplies of the party
out of the water on the occasion of traversing the flooded parts of the march.
But both horse and camel alike proved useful in other ways less premeditated.
Necessity cures many prejudices, and hunger is a sauce to reconcile us to a
very miscellaneous diet. As the stock diminished, and as the appetite
increased, even horse-flesh proved no unsavoury morsel, lean, tough, and jaded
as it too often was. Horse after horse fell under the 'jerking' process,
consisting of cutting the flesh into long strips to be dried in the sun. The
camel, too, took his turn under the knife, and our travellers were even far
more anxious to secure an adequate quantity than to differ about the quality of
their fare. Only once was the case otherwise, when one of the camels, 'old and
worn out, with sores all over him', was doomed to the knife and the jerking.
Refractory even in the pot, the tough liver and kidneys defy the teeth of the
hungry travellers, and the cook is able to boast for once on the journey that
there was superfluity on the board."</p>
<p>Mr. Elder's camels have made a number of trips with stores to northern
stations, bringing back wool, which is packed in smaller bales than usual for
the purpose of easy handling and carriage, and is slung, one bale on each side
of a pack-saddle. They were also employed in the construction of the
Trans-Continental telegraph line, and were found most useful in transporting
posts, &amp;c. In short, both Mr. Elder and those who have had the care and
charge of them since their arrival, have formed a high opinion of their value,
of their capacity for work, and of their suitability for many places and
purposes where, or for which, cattle and horses could not be used. Their value
for the purposes of exploration will be clearly demonstrated in the following
pages. No sufficient estimate of their powers could be obtained from McKinlay's
journey, for he was hampered by a flock of sheep, and from the nature of the
country the camels became footsore, and had to be fitted with boots or hides of
leather. Still he was favourably impressed with their powers of endurance when
fed upon the roughest or poorest scrub; and his horses on several occasions
fell away rapidly and alarmingly in condition, whilst the camels caused no
anxiety on this account. Colonel Warburton's expedition may therefore be
regarded as the first true trial of the capability of the camel for exploring
purposes in Australia.</p>
<p>In the month of August, 1872, the advisability of exploring the interior
between Central Mount Stuart and Perth was brought before the Government of
South Australia in such a way as practically to leave no course open to them
except acquiescence. The public urged the matter, the press were equally
determined, and in the most liberal manner Mr. Elder placed his camels at the
disposal of the Government, and offered to provide native drivers, both free of
expense. The Government accepted the proposal, Colonel Egerton Warburton was
named as leader of the expedition, a sufficient number of camels and horses tot
transport service being placed at his disposal. Through various causes the
arrangements thus made broke down; but Mr. Elder, who was bent upon the
undertaking, resolved to carry, it out independently of the Government, and, in
conjunction with Mr. Walter W. Hughes, who volunteered to share the expense
with him, he entrusted Colonel Warburton with the chief command, authorizing
him to organize such a party and procure such an outfit as he deemed necessary
for the successful accomplishment of the object in view. The plan first
proposed by Messrs Elder and Hughes was that the party should muster at Beltana
Station, the headquarters of the camels, and from thence proceed to the Peake,
in latitude 28&deg; S., which latter place had gained some celebrity as one of
the principal depots of the party employed in the construction of the overland
telegraph. Here it was intended that Colonel Warburton would quit the telegraph
line, and make a d&eacute;tour to the westward, rejoining the line again at
Central Mount Stuart. This circuit would be through unknown country, and,
besides enabling him to gain a tolerably correct idea of the capabilities of
the camels, would serve to familiarize the whole party with the character of
the territory they would have hereafter to penetrate. At Mount Stuart he was to
receive a reinforcement of camels, and, thus strengthened, to strike out
straight for the capital of Western Australia. Having reached their
destination, and recruited their strength, it was proposed that the party
should return overland in such a direction as to bisect the territory between
their outward route and Eyre's coast track, thus striking the telegraph line
again somewhere in the neighbourhood of the Peake, the spot where, formerly,
they had first quitted it. This latter portion of the work, and the exact
direction, they would take, would of course depend in a great measure on the
success of the earlier part of the expedition, and nothing beyond the general
outline was settled regarding it.</p>
<p>But in the meanwhile the Government of South Australia had not remained
idle. They had organized an expedition of which they accepted the sole
responsibility, and placed it under the command of Mr. William Gosse, a
gentleman who had for many years conducted Government surveys in various parts
of South Australia, and had thus undergone a training well calculated to fit
him for the important post now assigned to him. He was to be accompanied by Mr.
Henry Grosse, who from having been employed in the construction of the overland
telegraph line, was well acquainted with the character of the country through
which, at the outset, the course of the party would lie. The point of departure
fixed upon by the Government was the Finke River, which, taking its rise near
the MacDonnell Ranges, runs for the most part in a southerly direction. It had
been already traced as far as latitude 25&deg; 30' S., and it was believed that
by following its farther course Mr. Gosse would be forwarded a very
considerable distance on his way towards Fremantle, which was to be the
westerly terminus of the Government expedition as well as of the party under
the command of Colonel Warburton. Beltana Station was also their rendezvous,
and there Mr. Gosse was to receive a portion of his equipment, consisting of
camels and their requisites, generously furnished by Mr. Elder, accompanied by
three Afghan drivers, also provided at that gentleman's expense. From Beltana
ho was to follow the telegraph line to Lady Charlotte Waters, a little north of
the 26th parallel, where a number of staunch horses hitherto employed in the
telegraph service would join him; and, his arrangements thus completed, he
would make for the capital of Western Australia, taking a south-west by west
course, and entirely distinct from Colonel Warburton, who, starting from a more
northern point would require to head farther south in order to reach his
destination.</p>
<p>It is perhaps difficult to convey to Englishmen the great interest excited
in the breasts of the colonists by the equipment of these two expeditions.
Though both were initiated in South Australia, the greater portion of the
territory through which they would pass belonged to the sister colony. Still
some hundred thousand square miles of unexamined country lay within the
boundary of the former, and on this account alone the Government had ample
justification for taking the field. Neither should the liberality of Messrs
Elder and Hughes here pass unnoticed. Not the slightest personal benefit could
accrue to either of these gentlemen whether their expedition was successful or
the reverse. A pure public spirit animated them both, and such was Mr. Elder's
attachment to the cause of science, that while bearing half the present outlay,
he wrote to Baron Von Mueller of Melbourne&mdash;a gentleman whose practical
interest in the advance of geographical knowledge is widely acknowledged beyond
the colonies&mdash;offering to supply camels for the use of any further
expeditions that Victoria or the more eastern settlements might think fib to
organize for the examination of the unknown country lying between them and the
Trans-Australian Telegraph.</p>
<p>The annals of the expedition equipped by Messrs. Elder and Hughes will be
found in Colonel Egerton Warburton's journal, which it is now time to introduce
to the reader, and a record of terrible suffering more nobly borne has rarely
been given to the world. The country traversed was in the main barren and
inhospitable&mdash;a dreary waste, a howling wilderness. No glimpses of
gorgeous scenery, no noble rivers flowing through fertile plains, gladdened the
hearts of the gallant band as they fought their way westward. Yet though
pleasing landscapes may have been absent, the impress of a stern determination
that no suffering could quell and no hardships daunt is apparent in every line
of the narrative&mdash;a narrative so simply and unaffectedly told that no mere
embellishment of language could add to its charm or heighten its effect. Some
little explanation, gathered from the gallant traveller's own lips, is however
occasionally added where necessary for the better comprehension of the
subject.</p>
<p>But before commencing the journal itself, it may not be amiss to give a
brief sketch of the leader's earlier career. Peter Egerton Warburton was born
on the 15th of August, 1813. After pursuing the usual course of study at
Addiscombe, he entered the Bombay army as a subaltern in the year 1834, and
served in India until the year 1853, passing the greater part of the time in
the Adjutant-General's Department, and rising through each grade until he
attained his majority, and became Deputy Adjutant-General at Headquarters. He
then resigned the service in order that he might proceed with his wife and
family to New Zealand, of which island he had resolved to become a colonist.
Circumstances caused some modification of his original intention, for instead
of making New Zealand his home, he took up his abode in the colony of South
Australia. Soon after his arrival at Adelaide he was appointed to command the
police forces of the whole colony, which onerous situation he held for thirteen
years. During this time his excessive love of exploration developed itself, and
on three or four different occasions, when in the course of duty he visited the
distant outposts under his command, he took with him a couple of troopers, and,
with the sanction of the Government, pushed three and four hundred miles into
unknown parts of the colony, making valuable additions to the known area of
pastoral country. After relinquishing the Commissionership of Police, Major
Egerton Warburton was made Commandant of the Volunteer Forces of the Colony of
South Australia, with the local rank of Colonel, and this office he ably filled
as long as the Corps was embodied. Such is in a few words the previous history
of the leader of the expedition; how he was selected for that important post,
first by the Government and afterwards by Mr. Elder, has been already
related.</p>
<p>Mr. Richard Egerton Warburton, son of the Colonel, and his second in
command, who plotted the map of the Route from which the one illustrating the
present volume has been derived, was born in 1840, and ever since arriving at
the age of manhood had been regarded as a first-class bushman. How ably he
seconded his gallant father the sequel will show.</p>

<h5>OF</h5>
<br>
<h3>COLONEL P. EGERTON WARBURTON</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p><small>THE HON. T. ELDER, AND W. W. HUGHES, ESQ.,</small>&mdash;</p>
<p>As it is scarcely worth troubling you with any detailed account of the
proceedings of your exploring party whilst traversing the known country from
Adelaide to Alice Springs, near the centre of the continent, I shall give
merely an outline of that part of our journey.</p>
<p>We left Adelaide on the 21st September, 1872, reached Beltana Station on the
26th, and started thence for Alice Springs on the 3rd October.</p>
<p>A fortnight was spent in examining the country about the Neales, westward of
Mount O'Halloran; but, finding nothing fit for permanent occupation, we struck
off for the Alberga river, running it down to its junction with the Stevenson,
on which we were detained for a few days by rain and thunderstorms.</p>
<p>Ascending the Stevenson, which was well watered and fringed with excellent
pastoral country, we reached Charlotte Waters on the 25th November, where we
were very kindly received by Mr. Johnstone, in charge of the telegraph
station.</p>
<p>On the 21st December, 1872, we arrived at the station which was to be our
starting-point for our journey westward, namely, Alice Springs. Long. 133&deg;
53' 14" east; lat., 23&deg; 40' south. About 1120 miles distant from
Adelaide.</p>
<blockquote>[It maybe remembered that the original plan was that, on arrival at
the Peake, Colonel Warburton should quit the telegraph line and make a
d&eacute;tour to the westward, rejoining the line about the centre of the
continent. This he did, in company with his son and another companion; but the
country proved to be so totally unfitted for pastoral purposes that the leader
deemed it unadvisable to continue in it, and accordingly the d&eacute;tour was
considerably shortened, and the telegraph line struck at Charlotte Waters,
instead of farther north. During this little expedition only horses were used
by the explorers, the main body of the expedition, with the camels, proceeding
steadily towards Alice Springs.]</blockquote>
<p>Being assured by those who had resided two years in that part of the country
that the summer rains would prevent my moving till the early part of April, I
sent Mr. Burt down to Adelaide and Beltana for four months' additional supplies
to meet the expenditure of the forced detention. I had much reason to regret
this measure; for, instead of long-continued tropical rain, as prognosticated,
there was none at all, and I might just as well have started at once.</p>
<p>Mr. Burt, on his return from Adelaide, declined to accompany the party, and
my son, as next in seniority, took his place.</p>
<p>The party now consisted of myself, my son (Richard Egerton Warburton), J. W.
Lewis, Sahleh and Halleem (two Afghan camel-drivers), Dennis White (cook and
assistant camel-man), and "Charley" (a native lad). We had four riding, twelve
baggage, and one spare camel, with six months' provisions, and started from
Alice Springs on the 15th April, 1873. From this date I shall offer you
extracts from my daily journal, which will enable you to follow out our course
on the map more readily.</p>
<br>
<h4>EXTRACTS FROM JOURNAL.</h4>
<p><a name="ch-08" id="ch-08"></a><i>April</i> 15<i>th</i>, 1873.&mdash;As was
to be expected, our first day's work was a mere getting under weigh. Two
saddles broke, and the loads were unsteady. Partly owing to the camels being so
fat, the saddles would not fit over their humps. This is a fault on the right
side. Camped on the telegraph line, about five miles from the springs. Our road
over low rocky hills, with mulga scrub (<i>acacia aneura</i>), a gentle ascent
all the way.</p>
<blockquote>[All the camels with the expedition were one-humped, and the
saddles were formed of two longitudinal wooden battens, united by three arched
hoops. The foremost hoop formed the pommel of the front seat; the middle hoop
went over the hump, just clear of the skin; and the aftermost hoop formed the
back of the hind seat. Perhaps it would render the description more
intelligible if I said that there were two seats, one before and one behind the
hump. If only one man rode on the camel, he invariably occupied the rear seat,
and thus formed a most grotesque object from a short distance, for he presented
the appearance of being perched on the very croupe of the animal. The hollow in
which the rider sat was filled up and made soft with his own blankets, &amp;c.,
and the stirrups were fastened on either side to the battens. The forepart of
the saddle was commonly occupied by the personal effects of the rider&mdash;his
spare clothes, boots, arms, ammunition, a small canvas water-bottle, &amp;c.;
and the baggage animals were packed as most convenient, the load of each
varying according to the nature and bulk of his burden. Both pack and riding
saddles were fastened on by two leather girths, one at either end of the
framework, but only the foremost was drawn tight; the after-girth, passing over
the tender part of the stomach, was left moderately slack. When required to be
loaded, the camels were made to kneel down by word of command. The body of the
animal then rested on a horny pad supplied by nature for this purpose, and a
space being left between the belly and the ground, the girths could be passed
whilst in that position. It was then also that the rider mounted, and some
little experience was at first required to prevent a fall, from the peculiar
motion imparted to the animal's body when rising. The means of guiding the
camel consisted of a wooden button passed through the cartilage of the nose, to
the end of which was attached a light piece of string. Though this may seem but
a slender headstall for so large an animal, experience proved that it was amply
sufficient. Colonel Warburton describes them as very sagacious and docile, and
readily obeying the slightest gesture of the rider. The baggage camels were
always kept in two parties of five each, the nose-rope of the rear animal being
lightly tied to the breaching of its leader, and so on until the string was
completed. I said "lightly tied", because this was necessary; for in case of
any sudden panic, unless the string gave way, the button would be torn out of
the nose. At night it was only requisite to tie them by this string to any
little shrub, and they would generally remain quiet until dawn, lying down and
sleeping. Single file is their favourite way of travelling.]</blockquote>

<br>
<b>2. The Start</b></p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;The first six miles over similar country to that of
yesterday. Took in a supply of water at a creek, then entered a scrubby flat.
The scrub is not of that formidable description it had been represented to be,
and would have been quite passable, even had there been no road cut through it.
The light rain which fell on the 12th, though leaving no surface-water, made
parts of the road so boggy that we could not have crossed them had we started a
day earlier. One saddle broken again today. We camped in the scrub, and have
had a treat which few in like circumstances get&mdash;rum and fresh milk. I
have often abused camels, and persecuted, or rather prosecuted, sly
grog-sellers. I will never do so again.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;On the telegraph line. Road still boggy in places.
Country good, but especially the last ten or twelve miles to Burt Creek,
consisting of fine, open grassy plains. We camped on the Burt. There was a
little water in a hole from the late rain, but the government well was quite
dry. Have again reason to praise camels and contrabandists. Weather looks like
rain, but none has fallen.</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;West-south-westerly direction towards the western end of
the Mount Hay Range. We had unfortunately neglected to collect the small
addition to our water which we might have got; indeed the Burt had been
represented such a sure creek for water, that I thought I could turn in to it
at any time if I found no water on the more direct course to Mount Hay. The
first part of the journey over good open grassy plains, the same as yesterday,
but no water. Then the scrub commenced. It became thicker and the grass worse
as we went on. Seeing no prospect of water on our direct course, we turned to
the north-west, to cut the "well-watered Burt"; but after a few miles the
country became still worse, and spinifex took the place of grass. Halted, and
though we had but little water, the want did not trouble us, as we fully
expected to cut the Hugh river next day.</p>
<p>The Burt is not a creek at all in the proper meaning of the term; it is
merely a slight superficial depression on flat ground, carrying off the
surface-drainage when the rain is sufficiently heavy and continuous to leave
more than the soil can soak up or the shallow pans hold. When there is plenty
of water all over the country there is some in the Burt too, no doubt.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started on our old course west-south-west for Mount Hay,
full of hopes that we must tumble into the Hugh, which had been represented as
running <i>through</i> the McDonnell Ranges under Brinkley's Bluff. Travelled
all day, but there was no such creek as the Hugh, nor indeed was there any
creek at all properly so called, though there were one or two just appreciable
depressions over which water would flow when it could not go anywhere else. At
six or seven miles' distance from the foot of Mount Hay we emerged from the
scrub and entered on the finest grassy plains I have ever seen. There are some
shallow water-courses which take off the surplus water and I dare say carry it
to feed the Hugh, but that the Hugh as a creek does not exist north of the
McDonnell Ranges I am quite satisfied. We camped, or rather threw off the
loads, and laid down in the dark after nearly thirteen hours' unbroken riding.
We have not seen a drop of water, and have only about one quart, kept for any
one who may fall ill for want of it. No fire lighted, as we could not cook
without water. Hungry and thirsty, we lay down in silence. I did not spend a
pleasant night.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Our first consideration on waking was how
to supply our urgent need of water. We could not find any near us, I therefore
sent Lewis with the two Afghans and four camels, our empty casks and
water-bags, to make their way to "Hamilton Springs", twenty-five miles distant.
I know merely the direction and probable distance of those springs, it was
therefore doubtful whether they could be found at all, but, if successful, the
party could not return till late at night. We were in great want both of good
food and water, but lay down to wait patiently, some of the party suffering
much from want of food and water. We had little hope of speedy relief, but, by
the goodness of Providence, a blessed shower of rain fell upon us at 1 p.m. All
the tarpaulins were quickly spread, and we got two or three buckets of water.
What a change! All was now activity, cheerfulness, and heartfelt thanksgiving.
A cake and a pot of tea were soon in the hands of each, and we were as happy
and contented as kings. About 3 p.m. Lewis returned with a full supply of water
from clay-pans, without having to go so far as the springs. I hope we may never
forget this day.</p>
<p>In the early part of the night rain fell again. We are camped on a low level
flat, and have to dig a trench round the fire. All were wet through, but we
laid down where we could and slept in peace.</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Spent the day in drying our clothes and baggage.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;We skirted the north side of the Hay Range, crossed three
small gum creeks, all dry; at twelve miles came to a good-sized creek with
sandy bed. We followed it down till it turned north-east, and then camped. In
ordinary seasons this creek would have given a fair supply of water, and we
obtained a little by sinking.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Started in a west-south-west direction, varying slightly,
now to the southward, and now to the westward. Country lightly scrubbed and
beautifully grassed, in parts open glades and good plains; grass in abundance,
but no water. Camped under a hill about 200 feet high, from whence we fixed
tomorrow's course. Had there been permanent water, a radius of three miles from
this hill would have made as pretty a small run as could be desired.</p>
<p>24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Hitherto the camels have been tied up every night, but
this did not allow them sufficient time to feed, so we left them loose. One
broke its hobbles and refused to be caught in the morning, which delayed our
departure.<sup><small>1</small></sup></p>
<p><small>[<sup>1</sup> Hobbles consist of a few links of chain with a swivel
in the middle and a stout strap with a buckle at either end. These are made
fast round the fore legs of the animal just above the hoof, and, confining the
feet together, effectually prevent straying.]</small></p>
<p>I have been hoping for some days to out the Finke, and am bearing in towards
the McDonnell Ranges for this purpose. At two miles we struck a small creek
coming from the range. Altered the course a little to clear some hills. Country
good. At noon came to a large sandy gum creek, but its course was wrong for the
Finke.</p>
<p>This creek is a very fine one, with old, wide-spreading gum-trees, and would
in ordinary seasons furnish a good supply of water, but there was none now on
the surface. We ascended it for two miles and found a native well. Camped and
sunk another, getting plenty of good water. This water must be permanent, as we
are travelling in a year of drought. I shall remain here until Monday, the
28th, to rest the camels, arrange our loads, and issue rations. This is the
first water of a permanent character we have met with for nine days.</p>
<p>I went with Richard up to the head of the creek, which runs in a narrow
gorge; we found no water, but many marks of there being plenty in usual
seasons.</p>
<p>25<i>th</i> and 26<i>th</i>.&mdash;I have taken every means of fixing our
position as accurately as possible, because this place will become a fresh
starting-point; the latitude is 23&deg; 25' 27"; the longitude, by account,
132&deg; 34' 0"; and the variation of the compass, 2&deg; 30' 0" east.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Resting in part. Rations issued or a week.
Map and journal brought up. Water-bags filled. Dampers baked and meat boiled.
Camels brought in and saddled. Everything ready for an early start
tomorrow.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;A pleasant ride through a well-grassed country. Camped at
4 p.m. on a fine gum creek&mdash;the Dashwood. No surface water.</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Several camels strayed, so we could not start until 1
p.m. At a short distance up the creek we found a native well in the sand, and
filled all our bags. After travelling a couple of miles south-west by south, we
turned south to examine a cascade 280 feet high, with some nice pools of water
in the rocky ledges. Struck the creek again and camped on it, but it contained
no surface-water.</p>
<p>The country today has been beautiful, with park-like scenery and splendid
grass. Water procurable at easy depth in the creek. Strong south-easterly wind
all night.</p>
<p>30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thermometer down to 41&deg; Fahrenheit this morning.
Travelled up to head of the creek, finding a good pool of water in a rocky
glen. As the present has been a year of drought, I think this water must be
permanent. Both banks of the Dashwood abound in springs, and water might be got
anywhere in ten minutes.</p>
<p>Leaving the glen, had to return nearly to our camp before we could head
westward. Turned south in the afternoon, to try whether the Finke really did
run through the McDonnell Ranges, as confidently stated by some. We camped at
4.30 p.m. under a granite hillock. Country not so good.</p>
<p><a name="ch-09" id="ch-09"></a><i>May</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Following a
south-westerly course, we found a shallow claypan and watered the camels. We
came upon a large creek, but running the wrong way for the Finke; two hours
afterwards struck another creek, also running in the wrong direction. This is
our last hope, and it is now quite certain that the Finke does not run through
the McDonnell Ranges but takes its rise in the midst of them.</p>
<p>It was necessary to settle this question, as my future course depended upon
it. Had the Finke come from anywhere north of the McDonnell Ranges, I should
have steadily run it up. We shall trouble ourselves now no more about this
fable. Obtained a midday observation and started afresh to the northward and
westward. At 2 p.m. struck a small, poor-looking creek, but it had a pool of
surface water, so we camped here, congratulating ourselves upon our first camp
near surface water. The camels drank with apparent satisfaction, but when it
came to our turn the water was so intensely bitter we could not use it. This
water was beautifully clear, and had every appearance of being perfectly
drinkable. Its bitterness was most intense, though none of the party were able
to ascertain from whence this arose. This creek crosses the Tropic of
Capricorn.</p>
<p>2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Rounded what we supposed to be Haast's Bluff, of Giles,
and at 9 a.m. struck a fine sandy creek, fringed with gum-trees, but with a
clear level bed. At a distance of four or five miles down the creek we found
water and shot two black cockatoos (probably either <i>Calyptorhynchus
funereus</i>, or <i>C. Baudini</i>, Gould). We continued down the water-course
and camped on its left bank. This is certainly a beautiful creek to look at. It
must at times carry down an immense body of water, but there is none now on its
surface, nor did its bed show spots favourable for retaining pools when the
floods subsided.</p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;We still continued down the creek, hoping to find a lake
at its mouth. It continued for ten or twelve miles farther&mdash;a magnificent
water-course&mdash;but after that it fell off. As it reaches the lower level,
its banks cannot confine the floods which inundate the flats; the channel
narrows, trees take root, and sand-banks intercept the stream, which finally
splits into narrow water-courses and spreads itself over the plains, and so it
ends as a creek.</p>
<p>Camped at the end of the creek. No water.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sent two of the party with spades up the creek to look for
water, and followed myself shortly afterwards with the rest. Water was found in
a clay hole on the right bank, and we halted for Sunday.</p>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started north-west by west over sandy scrub. At eight
miles the country became more open, with spinifex and casuarina-trees. Crossed
low sand ridges running east and west.</p>
<p>Nothing but spinifex, mulga scrub, and casuarina forest all day, the latter
giving a melancholy beauty to the scenery, more resembling a Turkish cemetery
than anything else. The trees are straight-stemmed and tall. I should think
they would be well suited for telegraph poles, if it were possible to cart them
away. They stand in thousands and thousands, but there is not a scrap of feed
nor a drop of water in the country.</p>
<p>6<i>th</i>.&mdash;The camels went off in the night; no great wonder, as they
had nothing else to do. Starting at noon, we travelled eleven miles over the
same soft of country as yesterday, and reached the western end of Central Mount
Wedge. We could not find any water, and things were not looking well. Camped in
the afternoon under the mount and on the edge of our first salt lake. In the
night wild dogs were heard, and water-birds flew over us&mdash;both good
signs.</p>
<p>7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thinking it possible we might have to return to Sunday's
camp, I halted for the double purpose of resting the camels and searching for
water. I sent out in three different directions, and one of the party returned
quickly, having found a rock-hole with a soakage spring near the camp.</p>
<p>Thus relieved from anxiety, I proceeded to measure Central Mount Wedge. It
is a very remarkable hill in the Mount Wedge Range. When I first saw it from a
moderate elevation, at a distance of seventy or eighty miles, no other part of
the range was visible, and it stood out as an isolated hill from a sea of
scrub, bearing a striking resemblance to Mount Wedge Island (a small island
situated near the coast of Western Australia), as seen from a distance at
sea.</p>
<p>Measuring with all the care I could, its total height from the high saddle
on which it stood proved to be 1650 feet; the eastern point being a
perpendicular scarp of red rock, 615 feet above the slope of the mountain; it
was this sharp-cut face that I had seen from a distance.</p>
<p>The hill was too formidable for me to ascend. Two of the party, however,
went up for me, as I wanted the bearing of some hills to check my longitude; it
was a very arduous task, and on reaching the summit a thick haze prevented
anything being seen distinctly. The barometer also was of little use, as it
fell below its marked scale. In descending, one of the men had a narrow escape
from a large piece of rock which grazed him as it fell.</p>
<p>One of the water-searchers returned in the evening, having found some
splendid waters in glens in the range. The Afghans, who had also gone out in
the morning, returned; they had found no water, but, what was much worse, had
contrived to lose a camel, or rather to let it run away with saddle and all
equipments. This camel was a serious loss. It seems, from the account given by
its rider, that he dismounted to pick up some object which attracted his
attention, and tied the animal up, but that it broke his nose-rope, and
immediately made off.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>.&mdash;I sent off the Afghan on my riding camel to recover the
runaway animal, and moved the camp in the afternoon seven miles along the range
opposite the glens found yesterday, promising to remain there till he returned.
He joined us again in the evening, but without the camel; he stated that he had
ridden sixty miles and lost the tracks. This accident never ought to have
happened at the hands of a professed camel-driver; the loss was very heavy, the
animal being one of our best riding camels.</p>
<p>9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Saddled the camels and took them as far up the first glen
as they would go; but they were so frightened at the stupendous rocks that they
could not be got to the water; we therefore sent them round to the second glen,
which is more easy of access, but the same thing occurred there, the
perpendicular walls of rock which towered above them excited such terror that
they would not taste the water even when brought to them in a bucket. This was
unfortunate, as we particularly wished them to lay in a good supply, to carry
us through the dry country we are now in.</p>
<p>We went to explore the glens. I might, perhaps, by degrees, convey to
another person in conversation some idea of these places, but I cannot attempt
it in writing; they are very grand and imposing. At the entrance of the first
glen a huge column of basalt has been launched from a height of about 300 feet,
and has stuck perpendicularly in the ground; the base has been worn away by the
torrent, and cannot much longer support this heavy top. It stands a sentry to
guard the beautiful pool, which occupies the whole width of the entrance to the
glen. I had no time for accurate measurements, and give only estimates. The
pool is about fifteen feet wide, fifty long, and the basaltic walls which
enclose it are about 300 feet in perpendicular height. Looking from the
entrance, the view does not extend beyond thirty yards, but after scrambling
that far, another turn in the glen at a right angle to the first, shows a still
grander split in the mountain, with a large circular pool of deep clear water,
almost wholly roofed over by a single huge slab of basalt. As the sun cannot
reach this water, it never can fail.</p>
<p>The second glen is on the whole less rugged and grand, but more picturesque.
We ascended to the head of this glen, finding many springs and much running
water. It is impossible to do these grand places justice by any verbal
description; they must be seen to be rightly appreciated. I have called the
first "Glen Elder", the second "Glen Hughes", after the public-spirited
projectors under whose auspices this expedition has been sent out.</p>
<p>I could have spent a week at this interesting place pleasantly, and in the
afternoon left it with regret. We travelled over eleven miles of alternate
porcupine-grass (<i>triodia pungens</i>, or spinifex) and scrub, towards a low
hill to the north-west. No signs of water; but we seemed to have passed out of
the region of the salt lagoons.</p>
<p>10<i>th</i>.&mdash;North by west over this wretched country, no
water-courses, no grass, nothing but porcupine-grass and scrub. Advanced
seventeen unites towards what I suppose to be a part of the Reynold's Range,
our latitude being 22&deg; 25' 5".</p>
<blockquote>[A short description of the Spinifex, mentioned so often by
explorers in the interior of Australia, maybe interesting to the reader. It is
a sharp spiny grass, growing in tussocks of from eighteen inches to five feet
in diameter. When quite young the shoots are green, but as they mature their
colour becomes of nearly the same hue as wheat straw, and, instead of
enlivening, serves only to add desolation to the aspect of the wilderness. It
is quite uneatable even for camels, who are compelled to thread their way
painfully through its mazes, never planting a foot on the stools, if they can
possibly avoid it. To horses it has on more than one occasion proved most
destructive, piercing and cutting their legs, which in a very short time become
fly-blown, when the animals have either to be destroyed or abandoned. The spiny
shoots are of all heights, from the little spike that wounds the fetlock to the
longer blade that penetrates the hock. It is one of the most cheerless objects
that an explorer can meet, and it is perhaps unnecessary to say that the
country it loves to dwell in is utterly useless for pastoral purposes. It is
called indifferently porcupine-spinifex or <i>triodia</i>.]</blockquote>
<p>Sunday 11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Obliged to move, to try for water for the camels.
Sent two of the party on ahead in different directions to look for it. They
each found a little, and we camped on a rock-hole that in ordinary seasons
would have supplied all our wants.</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Pursued a westerly course along a well-grassed valley,
between two ranges. Halted at the end of the valley, to await the return of two
water-seekers in the ranges. Some water had been found in the upper part of a
sandy creek. I went to see it, and then settled to send the camels at daylight
next morning, bare-backed, to feed and drink all day.</p>
<p>I was much vexed at my carelessness in not knowing there was to be a total
eclipse of the moon. I might have been prepared to some extent by rating my
Adelaide timekeeper, and getting my true time at camp, and though I had no
telescope that would note the different contacts and phases accurately, I might
have approximately corrected my longitude. Taken by surprise, when the eclipse
commenced, I could get nothing to be safely relied upon, though I tried. It was
a splendid sight, and our view was perfect. The moon was at its full, and the
eclipse commenced shortly after sundown, lasting for about two hours, during
half of which time it was total. After an hour the shadow began to move
off.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Halt. Recruiting camels and filling water-bags.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled twenty miles towards a granite range, over good
country, grassy scrub, with patches of salt and
cotton-bush.<sup><small>2</small></sup> For the last six miles the plain was
dotted over with large granite mounds, and intersected by several creeks
running northward.</p>
<p><small>[<sup>2</sup> Dr. Hooker is of opinion that the "cotton-bush"
mentioned in the text is probably <i>Gossypium Sturtii</i>. The "saltbush" and
the "salt-plant", seen for the first time later in the journey and boiled for
food, were probably species of <i>Salicornia</i> but, as Dr. Hooker remarks,
there are many salt-plants.&mdash;[<small>ED.</small>]]</small></p>
<p>In the evening two of us scrambled up some steep, bare, smooth sheets of
granite, which formed the southern face of part of the range. I did not like
the task, being obliged to take off my boots and clamber up on hands and knees.
We found a fine hole in the face of the rock, perfectly round and nearly full
of water. This hole was entirely a work of nature, and, strange to say, was on
the point of a smooth <i>projecting</i> part of the rock, where it might have
been supposed impossible for any water to lodge. How it could have been formed
in such a place I cannot conceive, but so prominent was its position as to be
visible from the plain at a considerable distance. The descent was, to me,
nearly as bad as the ascent; a sitting slide, feet and fingers acting as skids.
The portion of the rock in which this hole was situated presented a convex
form, and was more than 100 feet above the level of the plain.</p>
<p>One camel useless from sore back. This never ought to have happened, but the
fault cannot now be remedied, so it need not be laid upon any particular
shoulders.</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Proceeding on a westerly course over a scrubby plain,
between two ridges, we struck a fine creek, and camped of course upon it. There
was no surface water, but we found fine springs about a mile or two up the
creek.</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sent camels and water-bags up to Annie's Springs. We
started in the afternoon, and made ten miles of good westing; passed a
likely-looking place for water, but, not being in immediate want of it, I did
not stop to examine it.</p>
<p>We did eighteen miles today, but not on one course; the final result,
however, was nearly west, there being only a few seconds' difference between
our latitudes of today and yesterday.</p>
<p>Our camp is on very high ground at the foot of granite rooks in the range;
the spot is very pretty, and the hill under which we are located has two
immense boulders of red granite at the top. This is a marked lull, and, though
of no great altitude above us, is still very high and can be seen from a great
distance.</p>
<p>Lewis, though far from well, discovered a fine water-hole in a gap in the
range, and as we have also found water near the camp, we are all thankful and
happy at the prospect of a fine Sunday.</p>
<p><i>Sunday,</i> 18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Halt. Weekly rations issued; true time at
camp taken, variation of compass, 1&deg; 16' east; lat., 22&deg; 11' 48" south;
long., by account, 130&deg; 40' east.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Proceeding north a short way, to round the hills, then
turned west ten miles. Struck a small creek, which we went up six miles, but
found only a little water, not enough for our wants. Camped in thick scrub; our
general course upon the creek was south-east, but we made little headway;
Sunday's camp bearing north, 63&deg; east, about seven miles.</p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;We are now amongst a jumble of low granite hills
surrounded with thick scrub. No leading water-course, and the country due north
and west looks bad; little hope of water. Sent the empty bags to the small
drainage-hole down the creek to be filled, and ascended a neighbouring hill, to
see what course would be the best. Two out of the three sides open to us looked
very dismal; therefore altered the course S.S.E. for a promising-looking break
in the range we had been leaving behind us. This is a great disappointment, and
it keeps us hanging about the same locality, but there is no help for it.</p>
<p>Went six miles through thick scrub and camped at the foot of the range. My
two assistants looking for water, found likely places, but they were all
dry.</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Kept the camp standing to save the camels, and again sent
out my two companions to examine the range ahead. They found a splendid
water-hole in a gorge about six miles off, so our minds are now relieved from
the fear of having to make backtracks.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Five miles south-west along the foot of the range brought
us to the water found yesterday. This is a fine place, and the source of a long
creek; the whole ground over which the waters first emerge from the hills maybe
called one spring, as water is procurable anywhere on the flat. The centre
water-course was running, though there could not have been any rain for a long
time. It is the best place we have yet seen for a camp; running water,
bulrushes, and gum-trees, with good feed for the camels, are not found every
day in the centre of Australia in a year of drought.</p>
<p>The name "Eva Springs", with our camp brand W., and the year, are carved on
a tree. This gorge has two branches, in both of which there is water; but that
in the right-hand one, though more abundant, is not accessible to animals. It
could never, however, be wanted, as the springs would give an inexhaustible
supply. Some parts of the water are covered with a greasy slime, from what
cause I know not; the water itself is quite pure and good, the oily scum not
mixing with it. This greasy covering was iridescent, but perfectly
tasteless.</p>
<p>The place being so favourable, I left the camp standing, under Lewis's
charge, with directions to do his best to mend the camels' backs and their
saddles, to rearrange their loads, and throw away everything we could safely
dispense with, whilst my son and I went out for a week, to try what the country
ahead could produce.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;I started with Richard and Charley (the black boy),
south-west along the range, over villainous country. Something in the scrub
frightened the leading camel, it turned suddenly round, and ran off as fast as
it could; of course the other two followed its example, and shared its fright,
though they could not have seen what caused it.<sup><small>3</small></sup>
Three men rushing wildly through the bush on runaway camels, which they dared
not try to pull up for fear of breaking the nose-ropes, must have been a
ludicrous sight, and when we collected our scattered forces and recovered our
dropped articles, we all had a hearty laugh at each other.</p>
<p><small>[<sup>3</sup> Professor Owen, in a note to the editor on this
subject, says, "The several species of poisonous serpents and their deadly
character in the deserts of Arabia and Lybia have engendered an instinctive
dread of them in the camels or dromedaries of the Bedouins; and I suspect that
the 'something in the scrub', suggested by the sudden bolt of the camels at
full speed, may have been some large serpent."]</small></p>
<p>Luckily camels are not much given to running away, otherwise it would prove
a serious matter. If the rider pulls at the single string that forms the means
of guiding the animals, the only result is that its head is brought round to
the fore part of the saddle, without in the least diminishing its headlong
career; and as the camel can form no idea of where he is going, either a heavy
fall or the laceration of the cartilage would be the most probable effect of an
attempt to pull up. Though these animals prefer travelling in single file, they
scatter wildly in every direction when terrified. On this occasion each of the
three camels took a different course, and the ludicrous effect was much
heightened by the peculiar position of the riders on the hind seat of the
saddles.</p>
<p>Passing through an opening in the range, we reached a better travelling
country, and camped in the afternoon on a high plain with more scrub. South by
west were three remarkable hills, distant about twenty-five miles, one
table-topped, quite flat and scarped all round, the middle one saddle-backed,
and the third wedge-shaped and scarped at the point. All three seemed very
high, and high also were our hopes of finding something good about them. A few
drops of rain fell in the evening.</p>

<br>
<b>3. 24th. of May&mdash;"The Queen."</b></p>
<p>24<i>th</i>&mdash;Started for the hills over good travelling country,
lightly scrubbed. At twelve miles struck a large gum-creek, bordered by
exuberant vegetation, and forming a very fine piece of country. We crossed the
creek, expecting to find water amongst the gum-trees ahead, but found none.
Coming upon some good patches of cotton-bush, we camped, thinking to do the
camels a kindness, but they would not remain on them because we had put them
there.</p>
<p>It was a most uncomfortable place for us; the ants swarmed over everything,
and over us; indeed they wanted to take away the cockatoos we had for dinner,
but we rescued them. We had a little drop of rum, and did not forget to drink
the health of "the Queen", this being her Majesty's birthday. Finding the
camels would not stay where we wanted, there was no inducement for us to
remain, so we saddled up and went back to the creek, where we had at least
clean sand and no ants.</p>
<p><i>Sunday,</i> 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;We were obliged to move, not having found
any water since leaving our dep&ocirc;t. We examined the mouth of the creek,
which expended itself by inundating a large tract of level country, the
vegetation exuberant but dry, with dry beds of backwater lagoons. Were it not a
year of absolute drought, we should here have found plenty of water.</p>
<p>At 9.30 a.m. started for Table Mountain, but on getting near it could see
nothing that indicated a lodgment of water, nor any water-course; so as we were
nearly at the end of our own supply, we could not afford to run the risk of
losing the whole of next day in what might turn out a fruitless search. Under
the circumstances, it was better to shorten our distance from the dep&ocirc;t
rather than to increase it, we therefore turned so as to cut our creek higher
up than we had at first struck it, and then run it up.</p>
<p>Camped in the creek again near a native well, in which at first a few drops
of water were visible; but it was only the drainage of a light shower on
Saturday, and disappeared on the removal of a little sand from the bottom.</p>
<p>26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Rode ten miles up the creek without seeing any place that
promised water. At last our eyes were gladdened by a comparative verdure at a
spot on the right bank. Here we found a native well, and, clearing it out. Came
upon a splendid spring of excellent water. Thus relieved, we were at liberty to
extend our trip, instead of returning crestfallen to the dep&ocirc;t.</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;West by north, eight miles. Scrub all the way. Examined
some low granite hills, found a drainage-hole, dry, also native tracts, some
sticks burning at a camp, and a chopped tree, but no water.</p>
<p>We travelled ten miles farther through scrub between low hills, until,
reaching a dead flat expanse of sandy scrub, I deemed it hopeless to look for
water in such a locality. We camped in the scrub, tormented with flies, worked
hard to cut out a native bees' hive, but got no honey, their house was
empty.<sup><small>4</small></sup></p>
<p><small>[<sup>4</sup> The abode of the native Australian bee is usually a
hollow tree, of which there is no lack in the bush. The blacks are very clever
at finding the combs and chop them out with their stone tomahawks. The insect
itself is much smaller than our English bee, hardly exceeding the common
house-fly in size, and is stingless. The honey is remarkably sweet, and
esteemed a great delicacy by bushmen, amongst whom a nest is termed a
"sugar-bag".]</small></p>
<p>The weather all day was cloudy and very hot, unlike a tropical May day. At
night we were blessed with a heavy thunderstorm and drenching rain.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;It rained all night, and we spent the whole morning
drying our clothes. In the afternoon we started eastward on our return to the
dep&ocirc;t. After eleven miles, partly through bad scrub, we camped under the
lee of a low granite hill; it rained again heavily during the night, but, being
now on a slope, we were not obliged, as we had been the night before, to dig
trenches round our blankets to prevent being flooded out. The rain is a
blessing; personal discomfort, therefore, is of no consequence.</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Returned to the dep&ocirc;t through a good deal of scrub,
but there was abundance of water all about, and the creek which we had left so
dry two days before was now running.</p>
<p>30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Hoping to push through the bad country before us on the
rain that had fallen, I broke up the camp and started west. Bad scrub part of
the way; camped near a small creek we had passed on our return yesterday. There
was every appearance of rain in the evening, but it turned off into heavy
dew.</p>
<p>31<i>st</i>.&mdash;Foggy. Travelled west. Found a creek running east and
west, which we had not seen before when up here. There was no surface water,
although the heavy rain was so recent. Turned south and camped on some
claypans.</p>
<p><a name="ch-10" id="ch-10"></a><i>Sunday, June</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Rest
and water.</p>
<p>2<i>nd</i>,&mdash;Travelled west thirteen miles, through scrub all day, more
or less thick. We found a small clay hole just sufficient for a night's supply,
and camped.</p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Sixteen miles over high sandy tableland, moderately
scrubby. There was no hope of water in such a country; no water-course was met
with all day, and no hills seen to the westward. Bad place for camels, but no
better to be found.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continuing west, we saw some crested
doves,<sup><small>5</small></sup> and spent an hour looking all round for
water, but found none. After travelling twenty-miles, camped under a sand
ridge.</p>
<p><small>[<sup>5</sup> <i>The Crested Dove, or Top-knot Pigeon of Warburton
(Ocyphaps Lophotes</i>).&mdash;"The chasteness of its colouring, the extreme
elegance of its form, and the graceful crest which flows backwards from its
occiput, all tend to render this pigeon one of the most lovely of its tribe
inhabiting Australia; and in fact I consider it not surpassed in beauty by any
other from any part of the world. It is to be regretted that, owing to its
being exclusively an inhabitant of the plains of the interior, it can never
become an object of general observation; but, like the <i>Peristera
histrionica</i> and <i>Geophaps scripta</i>, it can only be seen by those of
our enterprising countrymen whose love of exploring new countries prompts them
to leave for a time the haunts of civilized man, to wander among the wilds of
the distant interior&mdash;a portion of the country never to be regarded as
solitary or uninteresting by those who look with admiration upon the wonderful
works of their Creator. The fauna of the interior of Australia has in fact, as
I have frequently had occasion to remark in the course of the present work,
features peculiarly its own, and its members are eminently interesting, both
for their novelty and for the beauty and elegance of their form.</small></p>
<p><small>"As might be supposed, this bird has attracted the notice of all our
travellers who have journeyed across the colonial line of demarcation. Captain
Sturt mentions it as being numerous on the plains of Wellington Valley, and in
the neighbourhood of the Murrumbidgee. It would seem to affect marshy
situations in preference to others; for Captain Sturt observes that he took its
appearance to be a sure sign of his approach to a country more than ordinarily
subject to over-flow; since, or the Macquarie and the Darling, these birds were
only found to inhabit the regions of marshes, or spaces covered by the
<i>Acacia pendula</i>, or the <i>Polygonum junceum</i>. . . . It frequently
assembles in very large flocks, and when it visits the lagoons or riversides
for water, during the dry seasons, generally selects a single tree, or even a
particular branch, on which to congregate; very great numbers, perching side by
side, and all descending simultaneously to drink: so closely are they packed
while thus engaged, that I have heard of dozens of them being killed by a
single discharge of the gun. Its powers of flight are so rapid as to be
unequalled by those of any member of the group to which it belongs; an impetus
being acquired by a few quick flaps of the wings; its going, skimming off
apparently without any further movement of the pinions. Upon alighting on a
branch, it elevates its tail and throws back its head, so as to bring them
nearly together, at the same time erecting its crest, and showing itself off to
the utmost advantage.</small></p>
<p><small>"I met with the nest of this species in a low tree, on the great
plain near Gundermain, on the Lower Namoi, on the 23rd of December, 1839; like
that of the other species of pigeon, it was a slight structure of small twigs,
and contained two white eggs, which were one inch and a quarter long, and
nearly an inch broad, upon which the female was then sitting.</small></p>
<p><small>"The sexes are alike in plumage. Head, face, throat, breast, and
abdomen, grey; lengthened occipital plumes, black; back of the neck, back,
rump, flanks, upper and under tail-coverts light olive-brown; the upper
tail-coverts tipped with white; sides of the neck washed with pinky
salmon-colour; feathers covering the insertion of the wing deep buff, each
crossed near the tip with a line of deep black, giving this part of the plumage
a barred appearance; greater wing-coverts shining bronzy green, margined with
white; primaries brown, becoming of a deeper tint as they approach the body,
the third, fourth, and fifth, finely-margined on the apical half of their
external web with brownish-white, the remainder with a narrow line of white
bounding the extremities of both webs; secondaries brown on their inner webs,
bronzy purple on their outer webs at the base, and brown at the extremity,
broadly margined with white; two centre tailfeathers brown, the remainder
blackish brown, glossed with green on their outer webs, and tipped with white;
irides buffy orange; orbits, naked, wrinkled, and of a pink-red; nostrils and
base of the bill, olive-black; tip, black; legs and feet, pink-red."
(<i>Gould's Birds of Australia</i>, vol. v., plate 70.)]</small></p>
<p>The sand ridges here have gum-trees of an inferior description growing on
the top of them; I never saw this before, and hoped to obtain water by sinking,
but all our efforts were useless.</p>
<p>There being so slight a prospect of water ahead, I did not like to take the
party farther away from the clay pans on which we had camped on the 31st.</p>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Left the camp standing. Took Lewis and started west, for
four miles through level scrub country between sand ridges; five more through a
burnt, bare casuarina forest. Two miles farther a slight but extensive
depression under a sand ridge. Here the vegetation was exuberant, tea-tree
(<i>Leptospermum</i> or <i>Melaleuca</i>), spinifex, and scrub; searched all
over it diligently for water, but found none; in fact, surface water cannot
lodge on this country much longer than ten minutes, it must sink through the
sand. This was a place which evidently received such excess of water as the
surrounding country could not at once absorb, but it held none within our
reach. We continued our journey; country slightly changing, and apparently
improving. Camped, after doing forty miles, under a low stony hill. We were now
some few miles within Western Australia; being the first, I think, who had
entered that province from South Australia, excepting just on the coast line. I
greatly wished to go on next day, but our camels were not over-fresh, and it
would have entailed an extra two days' halt on the main party, and have made it
ten days before we could reach our nearest known water.</p>
<p>6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Ascended again the hill under which we had camped. The
setting sun of the previous day had painted the prospect ahead in fairer
colours than the reality of the rising sun confirmed, and I had less reason to
regret my inability to go forward. The Table Mountain which I had visited on
the 25th ult., was visible at eighty or ninety miles' distance.</p>
<p>Reached the camp at 7 p.m. The only result of our eighty-mile ride being a
conviction that for the present, at least, we must return to the clay pans of
the 31st ult., and, if dried up, then back to the dep&ocirc;t creek.</p>
<p>7<i>th</i>.&mdash;The morning broke with an appearance of rain, but it will
do us little good beyond what we can collect in a tarpaulin. As usual, when
most wanted, ten camels had strayed back on the track and delayed our
start.</p>
<p>Rain came on in the afternoon when we were on better holding-ground, and
enabled us to water the camels. On to camp at eighteen miles.</p>
<p><i>Sunday,</i> 8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued on our backtracks. All the
surface water of the previous afternoon was dried up, and there was a cold
south-easterly wind all day. Ascended a hill a few miles off the track, to
examine what appeared a distant range to the northward, running east and west.
We thought very favourably of it, and hoped to make west again into West
Australia by its aid. Camped at the place where we had been on the 2nd.</p>
<p>9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started for the range seen yesterday; found some clay
pans, and watered the camels. Sunk some holes for the water to drain into,
should we again have to come back.</p>
<p>After travelling fourteen miles, we unexpectedly struck a short creek
running east and west; it had plenty of water from the late rain, this will
give us a dep&ocirc;t, should the range prove unprofitable.</p>
<p>10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded down the creek; it had a good holding bottom of
indurated clay and sand, with plenty of water, and many native wells. But it
ran out in a couple of miles, and lost itself in a flat. We continued towards
the range, which we reached in the evening, and found to be worthless,
consisting only of low broken hills standing on very high ground. There was no
sign of water, except the sight of two wild dogs.</p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Returned to camp of the 9th, examining the country right
and left for water, without success.</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Halted today, in order to rest the camels and prepare for
an eight days' trip to the northward.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;I started with my son and Charley towards a prominent
bluff in the range, seventeen miles distant; the ground as we approached
appeared to improve in its firmness, but the rain had run off it into a flat
that would not hold. We looked in vain for water, and, ascending the bluff,
about 360 feet high, the prospect all round (except where we had come from) was
far from exhilarating; a flat, sandy, scrubby country, lightly dotted here and
there with clumps of casuarina, and covered with the never-failing spinifex,
was all that could be seen. There were, however, natives in the neighbourhood,
but we cannot get near them, and they won't come to us. They must have water
somewhere, but we can find no trace of it.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;North course twenty-four miles; camped under a sand
ridge. On our way we surprised three blacks, who fled from their camp at our
approach. They left their fire burning, and their weapons behind them. We took
a Boomerang for Charley, and left a piece of blanket in exchange.</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled twenty-eight miles through thick spinifex, a
most hopeless country indeed.</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled thirteen miles north; the spinifex thicker than
ever, and covering the whole country as far as could be seen. Found a few small
Leichhardt trees for the first time. It being useless to fatigue the camels by
taking them any farther through this interminable spinifex, we camped, and
decided to retrace our steps next day. We had travelled eighty miles due north,
and the country was getting worse and worse.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Returning.</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Returning. Caught sight of a <i>Lubra</i> (a native
woman) with a small boy and an infant. My companions gave chase, but their
camels did not like leaving the track, and would not step out; they bellowed
lustily, which made the woman run faster; she tossed away everything but the
baby, and escaped. Charley, however, captured the lad, who showed not the
slightest fear, but looked at us and our camels as if quite accustomed to the
sight. We put him on the camel, in front of Charley, and made signs for him to
show us where we could find water. Even this unusual exaltation and mode of
progression did not seem to frighten the urchin, who kept chattering and
pointing to the west. We turned in that direction, but before we had got far
Charley's sharp eyes detected some diamond-sparrows<sup><small>6</small></sup>
rising from the ground, and he immediately ran off to look for water.</p>
<p><small>[<sup>6</sup> "No species of the genus to which this bird
(<i>Pardalotus punctatus</i>, or <i>Spotted Pardalote</i>) belongs is more
widely and generally distributed. It inhabits the whole of the southern parts
of the Australian Continent, from the western to the eastern extremities of the
country, and is very common in Van Diemen's Land. It is nearly always engaged
in searching for insects among the foliage, both of trees of the highest growth
and of the lowest shrubs; it frequents gardens and enclosures as well as the
open forest; and is exceedingly active in its actions, clinging about in every
variety of position both above and beneath the leaves with equal
facility.</small></p>
<p><small>"With regard to the nidification of this species, it is a singular
circumstance that in the choice of situation for the reception of its nest, it
differs from every other known member of the genus; for, while they always
place their nests in the holes of trees, this species descends to the ground,
and, availing itself of any little shelving bank that occurs in its vicinity,
excavates a hole just large enough to admit of the passage of its body, in a
nearly horizontal direction, to the depth of two or three feet, at the end of
which a chamber is formed in which the nest is deposited. The nest itself is a
neat and beautifully built structure, formed of strips of the inner bark of the
Eucalypti, and lined with finer strips of the same or similar materials; it is
of a spherical contour, about four inches in diameter, with a small hole in the
side for an entrance. The chamber is generally somewhat higher than the mouth
of the hole, by which means the risk of its being inundated upon the occurrence
of rain is obviated. I have been fortunate enough to discover many of the nests
of this species; but they are most difficult to detect, and are only to be
found by watching for the egress or ingress of the parent birds from or into
its hole or entrance, which is frequently formed in a part of the bank overhung
by herbage, or beneath the overhanging roots of a tree. How so neat a structure
as is the nest of the Spotted Pardalote, should be constructed at the end of a
hole where no light can possibly enter, is beyond our comprehension, and is one
of those wonderful results of instinct so often presented to our notice in the
history of the animal creation, without our being in any way able to account
for them. The present species rears two broods in the course of the year, the
eggs upon each occasion being four or five in number, rather round in form, of
a beautiful polished, fleshy white, seven and a half lines long by six and a
half lines broad.</small></p>
<p><small>"Its voice is a rather harsh, piping note of two syllables often
repeated.</small></p>
<p><small>"The male has the crown of the head, wings, and tail, black, each
feather having a round spot of white near the tip; a stripe of white commences
at the nostrils, and passes over the eye; ear-coverts and sides of the neck,
grey; feathers of the back, grey at the base, succeeded by a triangular-shaped
spot of fawn colour, and edged with black; rump rufous brown; upper
tail-coverts, crimson; throat, chest, and under tail-coverts, yellow; abdomen
and flanks, tawny; irides, dark brown; bill, brownish black; feet,
brown.</small></p>
<p><small>The female may be distinguished by the less strongly contrasted tints
of her colouring, and by the absence of the bright yellow on the throat."

<p>He found a native well with some water, and we soon saw another close by.
This discovery caused us immense joy, for we saw the water draining in as fast
as we drew it out, and we thought we had now got the key of the country and
would be able to get water by sinking in any suitable flat. The lad only
indirectly benefited us, as he was going past the wells, but we here offered
him some food, and let him go; he refused to eat, and sneaked away, thinking,
no doubt, how cleverly he had eluded us, when he got out of sight. Watered the
camels and filled our bags, then went on our way rejoicing that our long ride
had not been useless. These we named the "Waterloo Wells".</p>
<blockquote>[The native wells, on the discovery of which so often hung the
lives of the expedition, and owing to which they were eventually successful in
crossing the continent, would hardly come up to an English reader's
preconceived notion of a well. They were little holes sunk in the sand with a
slight curve, so that the water was often invisible from the surface, and being
thus shielded from the burning sun, the evaporation was less, and the liquid
cooler. The average depth of the wells was about five feet, though some
attained a much greater magnitude. It would be easy to pass within half a dozen
yards of these precious reservoirs by daylight and not perceive them, whilst at
night their discovery was quite impossible. It is curious to speculate on the
instinct that enables the degraded inhabitants of this wilderness to find the
few spots where the precious element is attainable. The savage has the
advantage of the European in this respect. Out of forty-nine or fifty attempts
made by Colonel Warburton's party to find water by sinking, only one was
successful, although in the selection of likely spots they brought all their
experience and desert-craft to bear. How often, when travelling in the dark,
and perishing from thirst, they may have unconsciously passed wells, a
knowledge of which would have been as new life and strength to both man and
beast, it is impossible to say.]</blockquote>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Returning to main camp.</p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;We made a d&eacute;tour round the bluff range to look on
all sides of it for water, but found none. Reached our dep&ocirc;t on "Ethel
Creek" in the afternoon.</p>
<p>21<i>st and</i> 22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Spent these days resting our three camels
and preparing to start for the wells. Lewis had been up the creek, which he
found spread out into flats and got lost, then picked itself up again, and
became a creek once more. This being the case up the creek, I thought probable
it might be the same down it, but on examination this proved not to be so; it
was finally lost in the flat to which we had before traced it.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>, 24<i>th</i>, and 25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Returned with the whole
party to Waterloo Wells. We enlarged, cleared, and deepened them, getting an
abundant supply of delicious water. Sahleh, one of the camel-men, was now very
ill with scurvy; the other one is also lame and ailing, but not so bad. Towards
evening Sahleh made his will, which he dictated to me in Hindustanee.</p>
<p>26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sahleh is no worse today, but he won't allow that he is
any better. The two wells which we cleared and enlarged yesterday have an
abundant supply of water; they have sufficient for a dep&ocirc;t, should we be
driven back again in our endeavours to cross this high tableland; but I hope we
shall not be compelled to use them.</p>
<p>We started at 10 a.m. towards the west. After five miles' march we turned
north-west, across a sand ridge; the country becoming slightly undulating with
low hills visible to the north-west. Camped at 4 p.m., after travelling
eighteen miles, between two widely separated sand ridges. Spinifex, scrub, and
sands as usual.</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;I sent the camels on, and went with one companion to the
top of a small ironstone hill; the view was anything but cheerful. Found two
stone slabs* marked, and a round stone hidden in a hole on the top of the hill;
brought them away as curiosities. Heard a wild dog in the
night,<sup><small>7</small></sup> but found no water.</p>
<blockquote>[* These slabs were thin, flat stones, measuring about fifteen
inches by six, of an oblong shape and rounded at the ends. They were marked
with unintelligible scrawls, and were secreted in a hole from whence Colonel
Warburton ferreted them out, in company with a spherical stone about the size
of an orange. No clue could be gained as to what they meant, or why they were
deposited there. Unfortunately these interesting objects had to be thrown away
before the termination of the journey.]</blockquote>
<p><small>[<sup>7</sup> The wild dog or dingo is a pretty sure sign of water,
for these animals are rarely found far from its vicinity. This animal, the
<i>Canis Dingo</i>, is admirably figured in Gould's "Mammals of Australia". It
is not regarded by Mr. Gould as indigenous to the Australian Continent. He
believes, on the contrary, that it has followed the Black Man's wanderings from
Asia, through the Indian Islands to Australia, the southern portion of which
appears to be its limits in that direction. From what he saw of the animal in a
state of nature he could only regard it as a variety, to which the lapse of
ages had given a wildness of air and disposition; it has, in fact, all the
habits of a skulking, low-bred dog, and none of the determined air or ferocity
of the wolf or jackal. It is of about the size of an English foxhound, and
affords considerable amusement to the Nimrods of Australia, who hunt it
precisely as the fox is hunted in England. The dingo, like all dogs in a state
of nature, never barks, only whines, howls, or growls.]</small></p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Cloudy; a few drops of rain fell.&mdash;Travelled
seventeen miles in a north-westerly course. The country today has been
improving, if tea-tree plats be an indication of water. At 3 p.m. we crossed a
stony ridge, and camped in a tea-tree plat, where we expected to find as much
water as we wanted; but on sinking we were soon undeceived&mdash;there was
none.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Cloudy. We deepened last night's well, but
with no better result than yesterday. Started in a north-westerly direction and
sunk another hole near a sand ridge, but found no water. Went on a little way,
then turned south-west, as the country ahead gave no hope of water. We then
camped, and dug three more wells in different places, all with the same
unsuccessful result. We did not make more than five miles today, as it was
unadvisable to increase our distance from the last known water, already fifty
miles away; but we hoped, by digging on the return journey, not to be obliged
to go so far back as the Waterloo Wells.</p>
<p>30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Whilst at the wells the camels were not thirsty, and
would not drink when water was offered to them, so they have had none, since
leaving "Ethel Creek". Now that there is none for them they want it, and as the
feed is both scanty and dry, they wander, and when we particularly wish to make
an early start on their account, they are absent without leave. We started at
11 a.m., on our return&mdash;a great disappointment! Dug three more useless
wells on the way, and camped at 5 p.m.</p>
<p><a name="ch-11" id="ch-11"></a><i>July</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Camels again
absent. Started at 9 a.m.; more digging today, and no water.</p>
<p>2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Dug two wells on the way&mdash;both dry. But we found two
native wells at about two miles west of the Waterloo Wells; they had, however,
very little water, and would have required many hours' labour to fit them for
our service, so we went on. One of our wells was found in good order, half of
the other had fallen in. We fished out the drowned rats and watered all the
camels before sunset.<sup><small>8</small></sup></p>
<p><small>[<sup>8</sup> Rats are very plentiful in Western Australia, where
they have their nests in the clefts of the rocks. Nearly a dozen species are
figured in Gould's "<i>Australian Mammals</i>". Most of them are smaller than
the ordinary rat common in England. In the absence of specimens of the animals
or their skulls, Professor Owen has been unable to determine whether these rats
may have been true <i>Murin&aelig;</i>, or rat-like Marsupials, such as belong
to <i>Hapalotis, Antechinus, Dromicia</i>, and other genera. With regard to the
paucity of Mammals met with by Colonel Warburton, Professor Owen remarks that
most of the species are nocturnal in their habits, and that the few seen or
caught by day may give an erroneous or inadequate idea of the Mammalian life of
the tract explored.]</small></p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Sahleh is so very ill that I must remain here several days
to give him a chance of his life.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>, 5<i>th, and</i> 6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sahleh has been nearly dead;
he has lost the use both of his legs and arms; cannot move; can scarcely speak,
and cannot take any food but rice-water. He is utterly powerless, and unable to
travel unless I strap him on to a camel like a bag of flour, and this would
probably kill him; so I shall remain here, and send out a reconnoitring party
tomorrow.</p>
<p>7<i>th</i>.&mdash;I sent Lewis and Dennis with three camels, a good supply
of water, and ten days' provisions. Lewis' instructions are to hunt and dig for
water in any likely-looking places, in any direction except one with easting in
it.</p>
<p>I think Sahleh looks a little better today.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sahleh looks worse; he is in a critical state, and must
either mend or die. We have nothing but citric acid to give him; he cannot
eat.</p>
<p>9<i>th and</i> 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sahleh is certainly better; we have
discovered a small yellow berry in the scrub, which, after proving it not to be
poisonous, we have made him eat.</p>
<p>11<i>th and</i> 12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Ice a quarter of an inch thick in the
buckets in the morning.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Induced a black to come to our camp, but he trembled with
fright, particularly when he saw the camels.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>, 15<i>th, and</i> 16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sahleh fast recovering.
Lewis ought to be back today.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Lewis is not yet returned, and I am getting anxious about
him. Six natives came to the camp, but we could not understand each other. We
watched these scamps with the utmost care and closeness, as we thought, but
they were too much for us, and stole an axe; this of course put an end to their
visits. These blacks had been seen prowling about in the neighbourhood of the
camp, and, by means of shouting and beckoning, were induced to visit it. They
were fine, well-made men, most of them bearded, and, considering the wretched
hand-to-mouth life they lead, were in very fair bodily condition. Clothing they
possessed none; they were armed with spears and waddies, or short clubs, the
latter of which they use to knock over the wallabies, a small species of
kangaroo, on which they seem mainly to subsist.</p>
<p>After sunset Lewis returned, to our great relief. He brings good news,
having found a place 100 miles distant, where water is procurable by digging.
This is all we want, and gives us another secure step in our journey. He went
forty miles farther westward, and came upon a dry salt lake; I shall be careful
to round this to the northward.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 20<i>th</i>.&mdash;A happy day, at the prospect of leaving
this place tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the evening, our native, Charley, who shepherds the camels, reported that
three had run away southward. He had followed the tracks for several miles, and
one camel had broken its hobbles. This was bad news, but Halleem, the
camel-man, requested to be allowed to go after them, and said he would bring
them back. I lent him "Hosee", my riding camel, and he started a little before
5 p.m. I expected him to push on five or six miles, then camp for the night,
and to run the tracks smartly at daylight on Monday, when he would overtake the
runaways and bring them back by midday.</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Looking every moment for Halleem and the camels. Sahleh,
who had been seen walking in the vicinity of the camp with a gun, returned in
the evening with the astounding intelligence that he had seen "Hosee's"
<i>return</i> tracks, coming near the camp, and then branching off to the
northward of east; he professed to be intimately acquainted with the tracks of
each camel, and quite able to distinguish one from another. This alarming news
threw us into a maze of perplexity and doubt.</p>
<p>It was now also told me for the first time that Halleem was occasionally
subject to fits, which rendered him quite unconscious of what he was doing, or
where he was going. This made the matter worse, as such a man was unfit to be
trusted alone, and it became a question whether Halleem had lost his camel or
his wits; the latter seemed to me the more probable, as I could not believe
that Hosee would come so near the other camels and not join them.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;I sent my son and Charley with a week's provisions on our
backtracks, to try for Halleem first; but, in the event of not finding his
<i>foot</i> tracks, to continue on, and endeavour to recover the camels. Lewis
also went in the other direction, to run up Hosee's tracks, so that I hoped
that by one or other of these means I should learn what had become of Halleem.
Unfortunately, Lewis, supposing he had only a few hours' work, took neither
food nor water. Now, 6 p.m., it is beginning to rain, and Lewis has not
returned. I know ho will stick to the tracks as long as he can, but I wish lie
were back; if Halleem be demented, he may urge the camel on sixty or seventy
miles without stopping, and thus get a start in his mad career that will make
it impossible for Lewis to help him.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;It has rained lightly all night. Lewis is still absent; I
am greatly grieved at his having nothing to eat.</p>
<p>1 p.m.&mdash;Lewis returned; he had camped with Richard, and so was all
right.</p>
<p>It appears from his report that Sahleh, whilst, out "birding", must have
stumbled upon a mare's nest, for Lewis soon abandoned the track he started on,
and turned after Richard to find Halleem's first camp. They did not find this,
but they fell on his tracks of next day, steadily following the runaway camels;
it is clear, therefore, that Sahleh has done his countryman some injustice, and
caused much unnecessary alarm. His mistake, however, has done good, for a
second party is now out with food, which will relieve Halleem (when they find
him) from starvation. Richard returned, having seen Halleem, and promised to
take out provisions to meet him on his return.</p>
<p>24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Stormy; clouds and light rain. Found several more wells a
short distance north of our camp. We must have passed close to these on the
18th June without seeing them; it is scarcely possible to find these unmarked
holes without some clue.</p>
<p>25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Cold, wet, and stormy; rain all night.</p>
<p>26th.&mdash;The weather cleared up. Sahleh shot an emu (<i>Dromaius
Nov&aelig; Hollandi&aelig;</i>)&mdash;a welcome addition to our larder. Every
scrap of this bird was eaten up except the feathers. The liver is a great
delicacy, and the flesh by no means unpalatable.</p>
<p>27<i>th and</i> 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sent provisions to Ethel Creek for
Halleem.</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;The camel-hunters returned in the evening, but without
the camels. This is a double loss; the camels are gone, and so is our time; our
means of locomotion are much reduced, whilst the necessity of getting on is
greatly increased. Halleem has, however, done all he could do; he followed the
camels nearly 100 miles, but as they travelled night and day, whilst he could
only track them by day, he never could have overtaken them. No doubt these
animals will go back to Beltana, where alarm will be created as soon as they
are recognized as belonging to our party.</p>
<p>The bolting of the camels was caused by a young bull, who cut off two cows
and drove them away before him.</p>
<p>I had hoped to have been close to Perth by this time; how greatly have my
expectations been disappointed! Difficulties and delays have beset us ever
since the 23rd May, and but for these we should have been near our journey's
end, for though we have not progressed, we have one way with another ridden
1700 miles.</p>
<p>30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Lewis, when last out, sunk a well about twelves miles
from here, the only one out of nearly fifty in which water was procured. We
started for it today. After deepening the well and cleaning out dead rats, we
had not time to get the water before one whole side fell in, and the work had
to be done over again. I hope we have now bid a final adieu to the Waterloo
Wells; they have been as a city of refuge to us in our distress, but one does
not wish to reside permanently in a city of refuge, however pleasant a short
stay may have been. The day has been cloudy and threatening rain.</p>
<p>31<i>st</i>.&mdash;Travelled eighteen miles west-north-west. Bad ground and
sand-hills. Weather cloudy, with a few drops of rain.</p>
<p><a name="ch-12" id="ch-12"></a><i>August</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;We continued
the same general course for seventeen miles. Weather very sultry; rain seems to
be near. The spinifex is so slippery the camels cannot keep their footing on
it. Rain in the morning, and continued all night.</p>
<p>2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Raining still, so we did not move, and are thankful for
it. It cleared up in the afternoon; the clouds are very low, and there was a
fog at night.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Halted for the day.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;The camels were away in the morning, and we made a late
start. Accomplished twenty-one miles in a direction a little north of west.</p>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled towards Mary Springs, passing a fine rock-hole,
with water. Mount Russell, an isolated hill of no great altitude, but a good
landmark for finding the rock-hole, lies south-west from the water, distant
about twelve miles. Mary Springs is a notable place; it is the nearest
permanent water on the boundary. The supply is abundant and easily got at, in a
sandy gully between two sandstone hills. Unfortunately I have lost the book
containing the calculations of astronomical observations, but to the best of my
recollection the variation of the compass was so slight at Mary Springs (under
thirty minutes) as to justify the belief that the line of no variation runs
very close to that place. This is the third time we have crossed into Western
Australia; I hope our footing there is at last secure.</p>
<p>6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Pursued a north-west course for fourteen miles. Camped
early, in consequence of finding tracks of natives, which gave promise of water
not far off. Found a shallow clay pan about two miles to the west of our camp.
We found good feed here for the camels, but the sand-hills appear to be
increasing in number and size. We have got amongst the half-dried salt lagoons,
so our further progress north-west is cut off. We must keep clear of these, or
they may drive us still farther north.<sup><small>9</small></sup></p>
<p><small>[<sup>9</sup> The salt lagoons are large open tracts, either wet or
filled with mud, crusted over with a saline deposit. It is by no means
necessary that the country should be depressed where salt lakes exist, for they
are often found on elevated tracts of land.]</small></p>
<p>7<i>th</i>.&mdash;A camel calved this morning. We cut the calf's throat and
deferred the start till the afternoon. This is our second calf; the camel-men
ate the first at Waterloo Wells. We started with full water-bags from the clay
pan. Halted close by a salt lagoon, the edge of which looked as though we might
get water by sinking. We are quite amongst salt lakes&mdash;a large one lies to
the westward of us, sending out its arms to every point. We must round the
eastern end of them, as camels and salt bogs do not agree at all. The country
in no respect so good as yesterday; still I hope to find a clay pan here and
there.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>.&mdash;We tried to cross the salt lagoon, but had to turn back.
Went thirteen miles. Country is very bad&mdash;dense spinifex, high, steep sand
ridges, with timber in the flats, and nothing but the bushes that camels eat.
Any man attempting to cross this country with horses must perish.</p>
<p>9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled fifteen miles northward and westward. A strong
easterly wind prevailed, blowing up clouds of sand and ashes from the burnt
ground. Truly this is a desert! We camped on a salt lagoon, on the south side
of which water was procurable, but it was quite salt.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued towards the north-west, to an
isolated hill. Country opening out. Reached the mount at 12.30 p.m. We had
great expectations of this place, but distance had deceived us&mdash;the hill
is rubbish, and we obtained no hopeful view from it. There are signs of natives
on some yam-ground near it. From this place we continued our course towards an
apparent gap in a broken basaltic range, and camped near it.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic04" id="id06"></a><img alt="" src=

<br>
<b>4. The Dust Storm.&mdash;Under the Lee.</b></p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;I sent three parties out to look for water in different
directions. Countless thousands of shell and other small parrots flew over the
camp, disturbed by the riders. Our water-searchers returned in the afternoon
unsuccessful, those who had examined the range pronouncing that part of the
country hopeless for water. We were, however, induced to think there must be
water somewhere in the direction taken by the third searcher, as he reported
having seen flock-pigeons. He may have been mistaken, and the chance would have
led us farther from the last water; so we should run the hazard of losing time
and lengthening the distance, should our opinion prove wrong. I sent two men in
the evening on our backtrack, to see if they could trace to water the natives
whose yam-digging marks we had seen yesterday at Yam Hill. This is our last
chance; if it fail, we must go over those terrible sand-hills again to our last
water! It will ruin the camels, and place us in an ugly predicament, but there
is no alternative. I dare not work them on a chance. What they can do must be
all on a certainty of getting water at the end.</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;I took the party on our backtracks to meet those I sent
out yesterday evening, and found them at breakfast near Yam Hill. They had
tracked the natives to their camp, near which they had a well. This is a
blessing indeed to us. I had a perfect dread of again crossing the frightful
desert we had got over. I trust that all may now be well with us for the
present. The camels must have some days' rest, as they have not had their
weekly spell for a long time.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Halt.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;We ran up some blacks' tracks for twelve miles,
discovered their well, and camped near a bluff. Found afterwards two other
wells not far off.</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;On rounding the bluff a high hill came in view in front
of us, towards which we travelled over pretty easy ground, which had been
burnt. Near the bluff the country presented a more hopeful appearance, but it
soon fell off into sandy desert. Camped about fifty-two miles south of the
hill.</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;We had scarcely travelled five miles today before a thick
smoke arose close before us. How the blacks let themselves into this trap I
don't know; they never would have set fire to the country had they seen us so
close. Of course they paid the penalty of their carelessness, for we soon
invaded their camp and took possession of an excellent well. This gave me an
opportunity of fixing the camp for some days, whilst my son and I went out to
see if we could find any break in the country to indicate the vicinity of Sturt
Creek, discovered by A. C. Gregory in 1856. We started in the afternoon, and
camped under a hill. Unfortunately my rough book, in which I worked my
observations, has been lost, but I remember taking a lunar, which gave a
longitude within four or five miles of that by account. I therefore concluded
we must be somewhere near the salt lake into which Sturt Creek empties itself;
and as this lake is stated to be only 300 feet above the level of the sea,
whilst the barometer and our own convictions told us we must be on very high
land, I had expected to find some very marked depression in the country.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Ascended the hill, but could see no sign at all of Sturt
Creek or the lake. As far as eye could reach high land alone was visible. We
had long been on elevated ground and were now on a high hill, but there was no
fall in the country such as required by a lake on a low level. Went part of the
way back to camp, having neither food nor water for further search.</p>
<blockquote>[Colonel Warburton and his companions had now arrived within a very
few miles of Mr. Augustus Gregory's farthest on the 5th of March, 1856. The
series of hills to which Mount Wilson belonged are described as only eighty
feet high, and might therefore have been easily overlooked. However, the fact
remains that Colonel Warburton had penetrated and pushed his way through an
arid wilderness that had baffled even so intrepid an explorer as Gregory. The
latter, after viewing the country from the summit of Mount Wilson, says, "As
the whole country to the south was one vast desert, destitute of any
indications of the existence of water, it was clear that no useful results
could arise from an attempt to penetrate this inhospitable region, especially
as the loss of any of the horses might deprive the expedition of the means for
carrying out the explorations towards the Gulf of Carpentaria." Accordingly he
turned back, which was by far the most judicious course he could have adopted.
With horses only any attempt to push south would probably have terminated
fatally for the explorers. Warburton, provided with enduring camels, was
enabled to traverse ground that had hitherto remained a sealed book to
Europeans, and though he did not actually sight either Mount Wilson or the Salt
Lake, yet he could only have been eight or ten miles distant from them, and may
be said to have virtually connected Gregory's farthest with the centre of the
continent. Had his expedition achieved nothing more than this, it would have
rendered great service to geography.]</blockquote>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Returned to our standing camp. A reed-topped spear and an
old iron tomahawk had been found in the camp of the natives, apparently
significant of Sturt Creek not being very far off.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;My son and I started again north by east towards a
high-looking range, in search of some signs of Sturt Creek. Travelled twenty
miles over a most desolate, burnt country. Camels will eat almost all sorts of
scrub, but we had difficulty in finding a mouthful for them here, and we
ourselves were tormented all the afternoon and night by small black ants. We
could get no firewood, so altogether had a pretty miserable time of it.</p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Continued our course towards the range, a gale of wind
blowing the dust and ashes of the burnt ground in our faces. To our surprise,
after travelling about seven miles, we struck a gum creek with good trees but
no water. We had never anticipated such a find in such a vile country, but it
did us no good. Reached the range and ascended the highest point, but there was
no probability of such a lake as we were looking for. All was high tableland.
Camped under the range.</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;We followed the gum creek through the range and ran it up
to its head. Not a drop of water! Rode all day in different directions, looking
for signs of the lake, but in vain. Returned to the west side of the range
through a long, bad gap, and camped near the same place as yesterday. We could
not afford to spend any more time looking for the lake, and I presume there
must be some error in the longitude. The Basaltic hills, looking very high from
a distance, were there, but they were worse than useless, having no water near
them.</p>
<p>I had been under an impression that these "fine Basaltic ranges", as they
are called by Baron von Mueller, would lead us into a better country, but I was
disappointed. Whatever they may be in good seasons, they are as bad as they
could be now, and there is more hope of water in the sand ridges than amongst
these hills.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Returning to our standing camp, we came upon some soft
boggy ground on which the camels would not put a foot. It is a surface-water
channel branching into the gum creek. In good seasons there must be water
about, and I dare say we might have found it by digging, but we had no spade.
It was dry enough for horses, but the camels would not cross it. Our return
line was over a better country, and we camped within a few miles of our
companions.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Reached the standing camp.</p>
<p>It would appear now that we were about ten miles east of the dry Salt Lake
into which Sturt Creek empties itself. The sand-hills prevented our seeing
it.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Halt.</p>
<p>25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded west-south-west, five miles, to a native well
found by Lewis during our absence.</p>
<p>26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Thirteen miles west by south, to a well in black soil. It
was a strong spring. We dug dogs' bones out of it, and when cleared it was a
fine well. As far as we could judge the water is permanent.</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Eighteen miles west. Ascended a small hill, hoping to see
something cheerful. We were disappointed, but still I know there is no
dependence to be placed on a cursory view from a height. The country may turn
out better than it looks.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelling west. Lewis found a plot of ground where water
was procurable at about a couple of feet. This would have been a fine place had
we been in want of water, but we had some with us, and our great anxiety now
was to get on. Crossed a large plain and saw, for the first time,
flock-pigeons. They were very wild, and we could only kill three or four. These
pigeons are excellent eating. We have accomplished eighteen miles to day, and
hope, from the change in the country, and the pigeons, to find something good
soon.</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sent Lewis south of our course to examine a
likely-looking place, and took the rest of the party fourteen miles west,
camping between sand ridges. Lewis, on his return, reported having found a glen
and a beautiful pool of water. I had made preparations to go to this place, but
in the evening, the existence of a lake ahead of us being reported, I thought
it better not to go backward. I give the following extract from Lewis's account
of the place he found, which I have called "Bishop's Glen":&mdash;</p>
<p>"After travelling six miles, we reached a beautiful clump of large
gum-trees, growing in a swamp at the bottom of a small creek, which was hemmed
in by a high sand-hill, and then ran through a rocky ridge in which there were
fine, clear, deep water-holes 100 feet in circumference. The green foliage of
the gum-trees contrasted pleasantly with the red sand-hills on either side, and
the barren, rocky ridge in front. Bustard, bronze-wing
pigeons,<sup><small>1</small></sup> owls, and other birds were seen in the
glen, and the whole formed a most gratifying sight after the dreary sand-hill
country over which we have travelled. It was a sight which would well repay a
few miles' journey in any country."</p>
<p><small>[<sup>1</sup> "The Bronze-wing Pigeon (<i>Peristera chalcoptera</i>)
is so generally distributed in Australia, that the colonists of every
settlement have found the surrounding country inhabited by this fine bird.
Specimens from Port Essington, Swan River, Van Diemen's Land, and New South
Wales, differ so little from each other, either in their size or markings, that
they must all he considered as one and the same species; the slight differences
that do occur being too trivial to be considered as other than mere local
variations. It is a plump, heavy bird, weighing, when in good condition, nearly
a pound; and its pectoral muscles being deep and fleshy, it constitutes a most
excellent viand, and is constantly eaten by every class of persons, being
equally acceptable at the table of the Governor and at that of the inmate of a
log-hut in the interior of the country. Its amazing powers of flight enable it
to pass in an incredibly short space of time over a great expanse of country,
and just before sunset it may be observed swiftly winging its way over the
plains or down the gullies to its drinking-place. During the long drought of
1839-40, when I was encamped at the northern extremity of the Brezi range, I
had daily opportunities of observing the arrival of this bird to drink; the
only water for miles, as I was assured by the natives, being in the immediate
vicinity of my tent, and that was merely the scanty supply left in a few small
natural basins in the rocks, which had been filled by the rain of many months
before. This peculiar situation afforded me an excellent opportunity for
observing not only the Bronze-wing, but every other bird inhabiting the
neighbourhood. Few, if any, of the true insectivorous or fissirostral birds,
came to the water-holes; but, on the other hand, those species that live upon
grain and seeds, particularly the parrots and honey-eaters (<i>Trichoglossi</i>
and <i>Meliphagi</i>), were continually rushing down to the edges of the pools,
utterly regardless of my presence&mdash;their thirst for water quite overcoming
their sense of danger; seldom, if ever, however, did the Bronze-wing make its
appearance during the heat of the day, but at sundown, on the contrary, it
arrived with arrow-like swiftness, either singly or in pairs. It did not
descend at once to the edge of the pool, but dashed down to the ground at about
ten yards' distance, remained quiet for a short time, then walked leisurely to
the water, and, after taking libations deep and frequent, winged its way to its
roosting-place for the night: with a knowledge, therefore, of the habits of
this bird, the weary traveller may always perceive when he is in the vicinity
of water; and however arid the appearance of the country may be, if he observes
the Bronze-wing wending its way from all quarters to a given point, he may be
certain to procure a supply of food and water. When rain has fallen in
abundance, and the rivers and lagoons are filled not only to the brim, but the
water has spread over the surface of the surrounding country the case is
materially altered; then the Bronze-wing and other birds are not so easily
procured&mdash;the abundant supply of the element so requisite to their
existence rendering it no longer necessary that they should brave every danger
in procuring it. . . . .</small></p>
<p><small>"The Bronze-wing feeds entirely upon the ground, where it finds the
various kinds of leguminous seeds that constitute its food. It breeds during
August and the four following months, and often rears two or more broods; the
eggs are white and two in number, one inch and three-eighths long, and one inch
broad. Its nest, which is very similar to that of the other members of the
family, is a frail structure of small twigs, rather hollow in form, and is
usually placed on the horizontal branch of an apple or gum-tree near the
ground&mdash;those trees growing on flat meadow-land near water being evidently
preferred. This species is very frequently seen in confinement, both in its
native country and in England; but I have not heard whether it will or will not
breed in captivity. At Swan River it is said to be migratory, and to be met
with in the interior of that part of the country in large flocks. At Port
Essington, on the contrary, it would seem to be stationary, as Mr. Gilbert
mentions that it is found equally abundant in all parts of the country; its
nest is there placed upon the branches of the Banksias.</small></p>
<p><small>"The forehead in some is deep buff, in others huffy white; a line
under the eye and the chin, yellowish white; the crown of the head and occiput
dark brown, bounded on the sides with plum-colour; sides of the neck, grey;
back of the neck and all the upper surface, brown, each feather margined with
tawny brown; wings brown, with paler edges; each of the coverts with an oblong
spot of rich, lustrous coppery-bronze, on the outer web near the base, the
outline of which, towards the extremity of the feather, is sharply defined; tip
of each of the coverts grey, fading into white on the extreme tip; two or three
of the tertiaries with an oblong spot of lustrous green on their outer webs at
the base, bounded by a narrow line of buff; two centre tail-feathers, brown;
the remainder deep grey, crossed by a band of black near the tip; under surface
of the wing and inner edges of the primaries and secondaries, ferruginous;
breast deep vinaceous, passing into greyish on the centre of the abdomen and
under tail-coverts; irides dark reddish brown; bill, blackish grey; legs and
feet, carmine-red." (<i>Gould's Birds of Australia</i>, vol. v., plate
64.]</small></p>
<p>30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Proceeded thirteen miles north-north-west to a fine
freshwater lake&mdash;large, but not deep all over. There were plenty of ducks,
flock-pigeons,<sup><small>2</small></sup> and parrots. This is indeed a rare
treat to us, and, considering the present size of the lake, it must be very
large (for fresh water) in a season when three months' tropical rain has
fallen.</p>
<p><small>[<sup>2</sup> Several species of Australian pigeon congregate in
immense flocks. Besides the Bronze-winged mentioned above, another species, the
<i>Tribonyx ventralis</i>, visited the colony of Swan River in 1833, in such
countless myriads that whole fields of corn were trodden down and destroyed in
a single night.]</small></p>
<p>3l<i>st</i>.&mdash;Halted for the day. Shot all we could, but the lake is
too large for good sport.</p>
<p><a name="ch-13" id="ch-13"></a><i>September</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;We left
the lake, and at four miles west-north-west found another; this second was
circular, with beautifully clear, fresh water resting on a pebbly bed. The
shelving banks were dry, but there was a considerable body of deep water in the
centre. From here we made fourteen miles, with very thick spinifex part of the
way.</p>
<p>On the 30th, just before reaching the lake, we had captured a young native
woman; this was considered a great triumph of art, as the blacks all avoided us
as though we had been plague-stricken. We kept her a close prisoner, intending
that she should point out native wells to us; but whilst we were camped today
the creature escaped from us by gnawing through a thick hair-rope, with which
she was fastened to a tree. We were quickly on her tracks, directly we
discovered our loss, but she was too much for us, and got clear away. We had
not allowed her to starve during her captivity, but she supplied herself from
the head of a juvenile relation with an article of diet which our stores did
not furnish.</p>
<p>2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;West again today, eighteen miles over bad sand-hills and
rough spinifex. Ran up a smoke, and found a native well. There are hills in
sight; those towards the north look high and hopeful, but they are quite out of
our course. Other detached, broken hills lie to the west, so our intention is
to go towards them.</p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;North-west by west, to a sandstone hill, but, arrived at
the top, nothing was to be seen from it except several "hunting smokes" in
different directions. Found a deep well in a gully some distance up the hill,
but we could not use it, for, when cleared out, the sides fell, and it was
dangerous for any one to descend.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Marched six miles west, and found a native camp and a
well. Could not catch a native there, they being too quick for us; not far,
however, from the camp a howling, hideous old hag was captured, and, warned by
the former escape, we secured this old witch by tying her thumbs behind her
back, and haltering her by the neck to a tree. She kept up a frightful howling
all night, during which time we had to watch her by turns, or she would have
got away also. I doubt whether there is any way of securing these creatures if
you take your eyes off them for ten minutes. North of us there is rather a
good-looking range, running east and west, with a hopeful bluff at its western
end; but I cannot go farther north whilst there is a hope of getting west.</p>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Made eighteen miles westing over bad country&mdash;and no
water.</p>
<p>6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Followed a general westerly course, eight miles. Smoke
being seen a little to the south, we ran it up, and found a camp and well, but
could not see any natives.</p>
<p>We let the old witch go. She was the most alarming specimen of a woman I
ever saw; she had been of no use to us, and her sex alone saved her from
punishment, for under pretence of leading us to some native wells, she took us
backwards and forwards over heavy sand-hills, exhausting the camels as well as
my small stock of patience. The well we found was in the opposite direction to
the one she was taking us to.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;I had hoped for a halt and a good rest for
the camels, but our well turned out badly, being very deep, and containing not
enough water for us or for a single camel. We could not find anything better,
so at sunset I sent the camels back to our last water, remaining myself with
one companion at the camp, in charge of our baggage, and as our last well was
not a good one, I fear the camels cannot get back for three days. This not only
causes great loss of time, which is the same as loss of provisions, but it
gives the poor camels too much extra work. We are now on short allowance of
flour, and the camels have more before them than they can well do, so they do
not stand in need of additional work by going <i>back</i>; there is, however,
no help for it.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>, 9<i>th</i>, and 10<i>th</i>.&mdash;I and my comrade remain at
camp. At 11.30 a.m. the party and camels returned; there had been much
difficulty and hard work in watering them, the supply being scanty, and it took
a whole night as well as the day to satisfy them. The heat is now very great,
and the camels are suffering from travelling during the day over the hot sand
and steep hills; we are therefore obliged to send them on in the evening, but I
shall continue day travelling myself, as long as I can get a camel to stand
up.</p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;I started the baggage camels last night under Lewis. My
son and I left this morning, and made twenty-one miles of westing, with no sign
of water anywhere on the march.</p>
<p>Charley has been taking a turn round our camp, and reports a native well and
a camp of blacks about four miles off. I shall start at daylight, so as to
surprise their camp, and endeavour to catch one of the natives.</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;We reached the native camp, six miles distant, just at
daylight, but our blackbirds had taken wing. The wells are excellent; shallow,
in a sandy hollow, with plenty of water. There is a small salt lagoon near us;
it had some ducks when we arrived, but they declined our company. We got a few
bronze-wing pigeons. There are two more small soda-holes near us. Baggage
started when the moon rose.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>,&mdash;My son and I found two dry wells and a dry tea-tree
swamp. We reached our camp after a twenty miles' march. The Leichhardt trees
are increasing in number and size. Casuarina trees there are none;
oak<sup><small>3</small></sup> few, but sand ridges and spinifex continue in
unabated vigour. The country, though very dry, is yet a little more hopeful,
and though, perhaps, unable to find wells, we may be able to <i>make</i> them.
The weather is getting very hot; the natives cannot hunt far from water, we
shall therefore turn north-west by north tomorrow, in hope of finding
something.</p>
<p><small>[<sup>3</sup> Probably <i>Hakeas</i>, miscalled oaks by the
colonists. There are no true oaks in Australia.]</small></p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Having no water to halt upon, we are
obliged to move on. Baggage started with the moon; the course variable so as to
cross the sand-hills at the easiest slope.</p>
<p>On reaching our camp eighteen miles distant, we found that the advance party
had found a splendid well, or rather had made one in a good place; we have
reason to be thankful, as this well saves us from going back over the stiff
sand-hills we have crossed. The country has not improved, as I had hoped. I
shall resume a west course tomorrow; my riding-camel has completely broken
down, and could not bring me into camp today. She lay down, and we could only
get her on her legs again by lighting some spinifex under her tail; but it was
of no use, she could not travel, so I tied her to a bush and walked in.</p>
<p>I sent a man to lead in my camel; it is quite clear I must give up day
travelling, the camels will be ruined by it.</p>
<blockquote>[Some little explanation of the sand ridges encountered by Colonel
Warburton is necessary, or the reader may be misled regarding them. They varied
considerably both in their height and in their distance from each other, but
eighty feet may be regarded as an average in the former respect, and 300 yards
in the latter. They ran parallel to each other in an east and west direction,
so that while pursuing either of these courses the travellers kept in the
valley formed by two of them, and got along without much exertion. It was when
it became necessary to cross them at a great angle that the strain on the
camels proved severe, for on the slopes their feet sank deeply into the sand,
and their labours were most distressing to witness. But the chief feature about
this inhospitable region is its utter dissimilarity to any other known part of
the globe. In Arabia and Africa are found vast tracts of sandy desert where
water is unknown and no vestige of vegetation exists, as, for example, in the
Great Sahara; though equally inhospitable as regards water, the countless sand
ridges of Central Australia possess this advantage, that they are clothed with
many varieties of shrubs and flowers, and with trees, such as acacias and
different species of Eucalyptus. This not only supplies food for camels, but
detracts much from the dismal appearance that bare sand ridges would present.
The shrubs supply nothing edible to a human being, neither do the trees give
the smallest indication of water; still they serve to clothe the nakedness of
the sterile region in which they grow, and destroy the impression ordinarily
conveyed by the term "desert". The truth is that for such a country
<i>desert</i> is a misnomer, and the more correct term is
<i>wilderness</i>&mdash;a wilderness divested of animal life, painfully
monotonous, and portions of it appearing as though they had recently formed
part of the bed of the ocean.]</blockquote>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Obliged to halt; our master bull camel has eaten poison,
and is very ill; this animal is of immense value, not only on account of his
great strength, but because without his aid we shall scarcely be able to keep
the young bulls in order, and they may run off with all our camels. Our lives
almost depend on this sick camel. We have nothing to give the poor beast but a
bottle of mustard, and that does not seem to do it much good. I hope a day's
rest may help both it and my own riding-camel. At 4 p.m. the young bulls
already began to be troublesome, and we are obliged to take extra precautions
to keep them fast; the old one seems worse, will not be able to move tomorrow,
and I cannot stay longer, for want of provisions.</p>
<blockquote>[In every herd of camels there Is found a master bull, who, by his
strength, keeps his younger brethren in subjection. These juvenile members of
the party are always ambitious of possessing a harem to themselves, and if
allowed an opportunity will cut off three or four cows from the main body, and
drive them for hundreds of miles at full speed, an event which had already
happened to the expedition on the 20th July. As long as the young bulls are
under the management of the master they are quiet enough, but if illness or any
accident befall him, they break out of all bounds and become intractable, each
one seeking an opportunity of asserting his own supremacy. The anxiety of the
whole party when the master was attacked by sickness may therefore easily be
imagined, for unless the young bulls were most minutely watched, they would
each drive off as many cows as they could get and leave the travellers without
any means of transport, or, in other words, leave them to perish miserably in
the wilderness. With a marvellous instinct, the young bulls were aware that the
master was ailing, almost before it was apparent to the camel-men, and at once
showed signs of insubordination by running after the cows. The most stringent
precautions were therefore adopted, by watching at night and by knee-haltering,
and happily these measures were successful in preventing another elopement.<br>
<br>
Mustard may seem rather a curious remedy for poison, but it was the only
substance the party possessed strong enough to have any hope of effect on the
strong stomach of a camel. It was mixed with water in a quart pot until thin
enough to pour out easily, and then tilted down the animal's throat. Perhaps
this is the first instance in which Colman's mustard was thus
employed.]</blockquote>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Made fourteen miles west. The old camel is unable to
stand, so we are obliged to leave it. We cut a ramp down to the water in the
well, that it might get water if it lived. Passed two small ponds strongly
impregnated with soda. We have been obliged to knee-halter the young bulls.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Progressed fifteen miles towards the west, and reached a
well found by one of the camel-men; it is a very poor one. The weather gets
hot; this moment it is 104&deg; under my fly.</p>
<p>By lunar distance taken yesterday on the march, our longitude was observed
to be 124&deg; 30' E.; by account it is 124&deg; 37' 0" E. Lunars are not much
to be depended on, but as the two longitudes come near each other, I think
their mean may approximate the truth, and if they don't, no great harm is
done.</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Made eleven miles more to the west. Obliged to abandon
two riding-camels at our last camp; they could not stir. We at first thought
they were poisoned, but it now appears that they have been struck in the loins
by the night wind. My son's riding-camel is also struck, it cannot drag its
hind legs after it, so we kill it here for meat instead of leaving it to die.
What destruction to us I our strongest bull and three riding-camels all gone in
a day or so! What is to become of us, if this continue, I know not.</p>
<p>We do our best by covering their backs at night. The camel-men say the
disease is common in their country; that it always comes in the night, and
prevails when a certain star is in the ascendant but what star they cannot tell
me, and as I am not a believer in the malign influence of the stars it does not
much signify.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Happy to say we have no more sick camels this morning. We
started so as to reach a smoke we had seen yesterday about ten miles off. Found
a dry well, but the country at times very bad. We jerked our camel-meat as well
as we could; but it is very poor food; the animal was old and quite worn out.
The travelling these dark nights over such bad ground is necessarily very slow;
hitherto I have allowed the sand-hills to be my guide; not only on account of
the difficulty of crossing them, but also because the smokes we have seen have
been mostly a little north of west; I cannot, however, go any farther with
them, as they are running more to the north of west, whilst my proper course
hes a little to the south of it; and thus by and by I should have to cross them
nearly at right angles, which would be ruinous.</p>
<blockquote>[It may be as well here to insert the method in which the camel
meat was cured, and the animal generally disposed of, for many more than this
one were doomed to fall under the knife, and the treatment in every case was
precisely similar. The inner portions of the beast were first eaten, not the
liver and other dainty parts only, but <i>all</i>, every single scrap was
greedily devoured, and whenever eating is mentioned, it must be taken <i>au
pied de la lettre</i>, and not with the loose signification we attach to it in
England; to eat a bird meant with the explorer to pluck him and then to eat him
<i>right through</i> and to eat a camel meant exactly the same thing. No shred
was passed over; head, feet, hide, tail, all went into the boiling pot, even
the very bones were stewed down for soup first, and then broken for the sake of
the marrow they contained. The flesh was cut into thin flat strips and hung
upon the bushes to dry in the sun, three days being requisite to effect the
process properly. The tough thick hide was cut up and parboiled, the coarse
hair was then scraped off with a knife, and the leather-like substance replaced
in the pot and stewed until it became like the inside of a carpenter's
glue-pot, both to the taste and to the smell. Nourishment there was little or
none; but it served to fill up space, and as such was valuable to starving men,
who could afford to discard nothing. The head was steadily attacked and soon
reduced to a polished skull, tongue, brains, and cheeks all having disappeared;
the foot was much esteemed as a delicacy, though a great deal of time was
requisite to cook it to perfection. The method of preparing one is as
follows:&mdash;Light a good fire some time beforehand, and let the wood burn
down to bright glowing embers; cut the foot off at the hock, and scrape and
singe as much hair off it as time and appetite will permit of. Having done
this, stick the end into the glowing coals, burn it for some considerable time,
and then, withdrawing it, place it on its side on the ground, and strike the
other side smartly with the back of a tomahawk, when, if charred enough, the
sole will come off, a large flat slab composed of tough spongy horn; if it
refuses to part from the flesh, stuff it into the fire again until it becomes
more reasonable. This would seem rather a long process for a hungry man to
perform, and the reader doubtless thinks he is now about to reap the reward of
his patience, having no further task but to devour the dainty morsel. Not so.
Having got the sole off, place the foot in a bucket, and keep it steadily
boiling for thirty-six hours; if your fire goes out, or you drop asleep, of
course it will require longer; then at last you may venture to hope that your
teeth&mdash;if good&mdash;will enable you to masticate your long-deferred
dinner.<br>
<br>
Out of the whole number of camels killed for food by Colonel Warburton not one
threw to the surface of the cooking bucket a single particle of fat. Worn out
and diseased, they afforded no more nutriment than is found in the bark of a
tree, and yet on such wretched stuff the party preserved their lives for many
weeks. Poor as it was, it was their all, and without it they must have
infallibly perished.]</blockquote>
<p>Though now relieved from the immediate want of food, we are much in need of
the camels; they suffer greatly from the heat, and cannot travel by day. As I
will not move any farther from water on an uncertainty, we have decided in
council to halt here tomorrow; two going out on camels to hunt for water on
some tracks of natives we have seen this morning, and two more on foot to
search towards the south. Should both parties fail, then we must try a night
march back to No. 86, get all the water we can there, and then press on next
night to No. 84.</p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;It is one year today since we left Adelaide! The two
parties started as determined upon yesterday; owing to the reduced number (two
only) and weak state of our riding-camels, we have been obliged to throw away
the tents and most of our private property&mdash;keeping only guns and
ammunition, and clothing enough for decency. The party on foot returned
unsuccessful. They found a well, but could not dig to water, as the sand poured
in from the sides faster than they could take it out.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. Charley returned with news that they had tracked the natives round
from north-west to south-west, and found their well. Lewis remained there to
clear it out, and I shall move on towards it this afternoon, in time to water
the camels.</p>
<p>Those only who have been in like circumstances can rightly estimate the
blessing this well is to us; we should have been obliged to go back fifty
miles, giving the camels an extra hundred before we could have recovered our
present position, and we have neither time nor strength for so heavy an
addition. We ourselves are all quite well, but very hungry. Reached the well at
5.30; it is a very fine one, and we watered all the camels.</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>&mdash;Closely as I am pressed for time, I think it best to
remain here a few days. The season is one of drought, the country thickly
covered with sand-hills and spinifex, the destructive heat makes it impossible
to work our few camels during the day, and it is almost equally impossible to
get over this rough ground in the dark. By remaining a few days I shall refresh
the camels, and the waxing moon will help us over the ground; unfortunately I
cannot make the best of my time, as I cannot use the camels to scour the
country round our front.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Halt. Our sick camel is not improving much, the others
are doing well.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Halt. A small bit of hoop iron sharpened at one end, like
a chisel, has been found here; I can only suppose it to have been obtained from
the kegs, which Mr. F. Gregory abandoned some twelve years ago on his way to
Mount McPherson. Two of our party have been away today; they have just
returned, and report the discovery of a good well about seven miles off.</p>
<p>24<i>th</i>.&mdash;Cloudy, with a hot wind blowing; the flies innumerable
today, which is a tolerably good sign of rain.</p>
<p>25<i>th</i>.&mdash;Travelled today parallel to the sand ridges to the well,
which we found to be a very good one.</p>
<p>26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Progressed nine miles. Richard is ill today; indeed we
are all more or less afflicted with diarrh&oelig;a. The ants are very
troublesome.</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Made twelve miles, but met with no water; it is useless
to go farther from our last water till we have secured another in front.</p>
<p>The sick camel that had detained me five days has now given in, although it
has carried nothing for the last fortnight. Slight as our progress is the work
is too hard for the camels, yet they are the most patient and enduring animals.
We have now only eight left out of the seventeen we originally started with. A
flock of wild geese flew over in the evening from the west; we hail it as a
good omen; but our speculations have not as yet turned out very happy ones.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Halt today for the purpose of trying the
country all round for water before we turn back; as we must do if unsuccessful.
I sent out two of the party to search. The sand-hills are running us down too
much to the north, but we cannot cross them in the dark without great danger to
our camels. In addition to the common flies which are quite bad enough, and the
ants which nearly eat us up, we have the Australian bee or honey-fly to torment
us. These insects stick to one most perseveringly, and though they don't sting,
they smell badly, which is perhaps the reason they persist in walking up our
nostrils.</p>
<p>Our water-searchers returned unsuccessful. Painful as retrogression is, it
is the only safe course under the circumstances in which we are placed, so that
in ten days we shall only have made a few miles progress. We are now on very
short allowance, and seem to have the prospect of starvation before us.</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started with the moon. Halted when she sank and went on
again in the morning. Reached camp No. 90 by 9.30 a.m. on Monday the 29th. We
saw nothing of the knocked-up camel we had left on Saturday, and suppose it had
turned aside to die. We crossed the tracks of two natives this morning, and
shall endeavour to run them up.</p>
<p>30<i>th</i>,&mdash;Sent Lewis and Charley at daylight to follow up the
native tracks; Charley returned at 10 a.m. with news of a good well about five
miles to the north-west. Lewis stayed at the well to save the camel.</p>
<p>Took the party to the water in the evening; it is by far the best we have
seen for months; it is more a rock-hole than a well, though it is certainly fed
by a spring.</p>
<p><a name="ch-14" id="ch-14"></a><i>October</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;An immense
number of bronze-wing pigeons came to water at this hole, but they are most
difficult to get; we are obliged to shoot for the pot as our supply of
ammunition will not allow of reckless or doubtful shots.</p>
<p>Our hopes are raised at finding a different class of water, and although it
has taken us down to latitude 20&deg; 2', we must follow its line; our great
disadvantage Hes in being unable to make any extensive search in our front for
want of camels, or to travel by day on account of the heat, which utterly
prostrates them; when we move we can't see, when we stop we can't search.</p>
<p>Travelled ten miles west along the flat, then camped, as one of the
riding-camels got lame.</p>
<p>Night cloudy, with a suffocating heat; the ants enjoy this weather, the
creatures never sleep, and won't let us either.</p>
<p>2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;It is very hot today, but less cloudy. Two of the party
went out on foot a few miles, and saw several smokes, but no water; the smokes
were most probably many miles farther than they appeared to be, and trudging
over these hills of loose burning sand is enough to kill a strong well-fed man.
A very short walk is all we can manage.</p>
<p>In order slightly to modify the evil of night-travelling we shall go over a
few miles in the evening, then sit down and start again as the day breaks,
halting when the heat oppresses the camels, and looking for water on the way.
By night travelling, without the means of finding water, we are only working
the camels for nothing, because the farther we press on the farther we have to
go back. Our condition is indeed becoming very serious, owing to our want of
provisions. We are placed in this dilemma: if we press forward, we run the
chance of losing our camels and dying of thirst; if we stand still, we can only
hope to prolong our lives, as God may enable us, on sun-dried camel flesh.</p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Progressed about five miles farther to the west, but found
no improvement in the country so far as we can see. The heat has been most
oppressive for the last few days; no wonder the camels are unable to stand it,
even we feel it. Today it is a little cooler, so we must cease to expect
rain.</p>
<p>Those improvident Afghans have consumed all their flour and meat, so I shall
be obliged to give them some of our meat. We were all supplied originally with
equal quantities, but whilst we have economized our store, they, who profess to
be able to do with less than any one else, have now none at all.</p>
<p>Richard, Lewis, and Charley all out, looking for tracks. Our condition is so
critical that I am determined, should it please God to give us once more water,
so that we may not be compelled to go farther back, to risk everything, and
make a final push for the river Oakover. Some of us might reach it, if all
could not. I do not imagine the country we are now in is really any worse than
that we have come through, but the loss of our riding-camels, and the length of
time it has taken us to get through it, has left us without the means of
searching, and without food, if we were able to search.</p>
<p>This day completes the year since we left Beltana. Early in the morning
there was a moist haze from the westward; by noon a strong hot north-wind
sprung up. Lewis and Charley were still out at sunset. Richard is suffering
severely from toothache. Charley returned at 8 p.m.; Lewis remained behind, ill
from extreme heat and fatigue. I sent Charley after his supper, on my camel,
with water for Lewis.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Lewis and Charley got back to camp about 5 a.m. It appears
that Lewis came upon the native tracks about 11 a.m. yesterday, and supposing
the blacks must have left water at eight or nine, he ran the tracks back, viz.
from south to north, expecting soon to reach the water from which he supposed
the day's journey had been commenced. He ran these tracks till 3 p.m. and was
then obliged to turn back. It had been very hard work for them both. We started
at 6.15, course westward, and camped after five miles' march on the native
tracks. Lewis and Charley now continue yesterday's work on camels, and run the
tracks southward, that is in the direction in which they are going; and as the
tracks were run backwards yesterday a long way without water, we hope it is not
many miles ahead. We have just finished all our camel-meat, and there is
nothing whatever we can either gather or shoot for food.</p>
<p>There are no signs yet of the country sloping to lower level. It has been
elevated land throughout our whole journey. It has been too cloudy for several
nights to take observations. A smoke was seen a little north of west, and I
sent an Afghan out to look after it.</p>
<p>Lewis' riding-camel, which has hitherto been one of our best, is fast
breaking up, and is no longer fit for work. Lewis had to walk all the way this
morning, after his heavy work yesterday on foot. The former camels were struck
in the loins, just as horses are struck by the land-wind in India, but this one
is diseased in the hips, and quite lame; this is the fifth riding-camel we have
lost out of seven.</p>
<p>The Afghan returned, having found a well, but without water, though perhaps
a little might be got by deeper digging. He reports it to be deep already, so I
shall not trouble it. Charley returned, reporting that they had found a
suitable well twelve miles to the south-west. Lewis was obliged to remain at
the well, as his camel was knocked up.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 5<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at 3.45 a.m.; and reached the well
at 8.30. We were obliged to make frequent stoppages from having to cross the
sand-hills at right angles. Lewis not there, I don't know where he can be; the
well is a very poor one, and I am much afraid of it; I had hoped to remain here
a day or two, to jerk the camel-meat we require, but I fear we shall find the
water quite inadequate to our wants.</p>
<p>Evening. My fears are realized; the supply of water is quite insufficient.
There is another well about two miles off, but it is of the same character, and
does not give water enough for one camel. Lewis returned; his camel had
knocked, up, and he was trying to get it a little water at the farther well. He
had done all that man could do.</p>
<p>We must stay here tonight to test the wells. Killed the lame camel for meat.
Lewis slept at the farther well and got all he could for the camel he had with
him. We worked at our well all night, taking the water as it came in at the
rate of one bucket every three hours; we contrived, however, during the day and
night to give each camel one bucket.</p>
<p>6<i>th</i>.&mdash;The well is quite a failure. I sent Lewis and Charley to
run the tracks a short way from the farther well. We must try everything, and
man can do no more.</p>
<p>Lewis returned in three hours, reporting two more wells, but he could not
tell what they might yield; he sent Charley farther on, to continue tracking
the blacks, in the hopes he might find some better supply of water.</p>
<p>Were employed today in cutting up and jerking the camel-meat.</p>
<p>I have determined to send the camels bare-backed tonight to the water at
camp 93, which I estimate to be about twenty-five miles east, one half north of
me, but owing to the cloudy sky I was unable to take a latitude from that camp.
I have tested the well here and find it gives one quart of water in thirty-five
minutes, so there is a sufficiency, if the yield do not decrease and the sides
do not fall in (as they most probably will), for three men, who will remain
here whilst the camels are away. We are reduced to seven camels in all, and
three of these are in such a weak state, I have little hope they will be able
to reach the water even when bare-backed. I shall send the two casks, and the
empty water-bags, so that water may be carried back to any camels we may be
compelled to leave behind. The intense heat, and the difficulty of the ground,
when added to the poor food and the insufficient supply of water, are quite
sufficient to account for the camels failing so quickly, and I know full well
that every camel we lose carries away with it one of the hopes of our being
able to save our lives. We are in the hands of God, and there is always hope
whilst there is life. I am thankful to say I have neither fear nor fretfulness.
I am not afraid of evil tidings. 3 p.m., Richard, Lewis, and Charley returned
to camp with hopeful news. The two first had found several wells almost filled
up, but with a little water; they sent Charley on to run the tracks, which took
him to a well, that, when cleared out, he thinks will water our camels. Water
has been given to the two camels which most needed it, and I shall send them
all on without loads this evening to Charley's well, which I trust will turn
out as good as he thinks it is. The question, however, is quite an open one; it
is impossible to tell what these wells may be till we have deepened and tried
them; should it turn out sufficient for the wants of the camels, and not run
dry after a bucket or two is taken, then indeed it will be a signal blessing to
us, saving, not only an extra fifty miles, but probably the lives of two or
three camels. Three men go with the camels, four remain here. We may have a
little want of water in our camp, but shall be able to get a small quantity
from the well two miles off. We have knocked out the bottom of one of our
buckets, and by sinking it into the wet sand, we are better able to bale out
our little drops of water.</p>

<b>5. Facing the Enemy.</b></p>
<p>7<i>th</i>.&mdash;A strong hot wind from the south is blowing today. Our
camels returned in the evening from water; they had gone off from the well of
their own accord straight to a good water-hole, with limestone and sand; this
is the first time they ever found water for themselves. All credit be to them
for the same. We have a place where we may recruit our camels a little.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started with the baggage at 6 a.m. One of the camels,
which appeared quite well last night, was scarcely able to stand; for this
reason my son and I took it in turns to walk. I had the first turn at walking,
and owing to stoppages from loads slipping off at the sand hills, I got ahead
of the camels. I lost and picked up again yesterday's tracks several times, at
last I lost them altogether, and continued on the course I supposed the
water-hole to lie. Suddenly, hearing a slight noise behind me, I turned and
beheld nine armed blacks running towards me. We stopped and faced each other
about fifteen yards apart; two youngsters poised their spears at me, but I
think it was more out of bravado than anything else; for when I advanced upon
them, pistol in hand, they lowered their spears. We became on speaking terms
with each other, but without much mutual edification, I fancy.</p>
<p>Whilst they were all jabbering round me, I heard a shot, as I supposed on my
right front. It turned out to have been fired from the very opposite direction,
and I should have answered the signal, only that, being amongst so many
natives, I did not like to lose one of the three charges in my pistol; and
perhaps my black friends might have thought that one discharge had exhausted my
resources, and be then induced to commence hostilities. I went with them to
their camp and got a little water; the women and children would not come near
me, but, thanks to my grey beard, the few who were similarly adorned
fraternized readily with me. We passed our hands over each other's beards, for
what purpose I cannot exactly say, unless it was to assure ourselves, that they
were not tied on; and after this little formality we were good friends. I
continued my walks over the sand-hills on a south-easterly direction, till I
thought I must have covered the required distance, then stopped, lighted a
fire, and smoked a pipe. I felt much inclined for a little sleep, but the ants
would not allow this; so after several unsuccessful attempts, I determined to
go back to the blacks' camp and get some water. Just as I was starting my two
comrades came up with Charley, who had followed up my tracks; they brought me
some water, and we retraced our steps, for I was far beyond my camp, having
missed the turn from the well to which the camels had been sent to the water
they had found for themselves. Repassing the native camp, we bartered with the
blacks for a wallaby, without which I should not have reached our camp that
night, for I was utterly exhausted by heat, hunger, and fatigue. My comrades
kindly accommodated themselves to my weakness, and with their help I managed to
stagger into camp about 6 p.m.</p>
<p>9<i>th</i>.&mdash;A very hot day. This is a good place for the camels, and
though time is so important to us we must stay here some days, sacrificing
everything to them, as, humanly speaking, our own lives depend upon their
ability to get through this desert. We shot some Gular parrots, and bronze-wing
and topknot pigeons.</p>
<p>10<i>th</i>.&mdash;Today it is cloudy and cooler. What a relief! shooting
away every time We can get near, and eating all we kill: trying to save our
last morsel of flour and tea as long as possible: we know not to what extremity
we may be reduced. If our camels were equal to travelling in the day, we might
get on, as there would then be a hope of water; but nothing can be done in the
night, and we have not a single animal on which I dare send any one out to look
for water whilst the others are resting.</p>
<p>The camel-man reports favourably of the improvement of the camels, but these
men always attribute unlimited power to their animals till those powers are
called into exercise, and then, when they break down, the failure is attributed
to Providence, and not to the simple fact that the poor beasts are done up, and
cannot stand the hard work.</p>
<p>There is a small dry claypan near this water; we have not seen such a thing
for a long time. I endeavour to eke out my meagre fare with a mess of boiled
salt-plant (<i>salicornia</i>); this is the first place where we have seen
it.</p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;Cloudy and pretty hot; but I fear rain is as far off as
ever. We manage to kill a few birds, and they are most acceptable.</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Still cloudy; the nights are so overcast that I cannot
get an observation. I should have taken a lunar had there been a favourable
opportunity; but, after all, it does not much signify, for I reason, that
should a lunar put me more to the eastward than our mapped position, it might
create a little despondency; whilst supposing I have not mapped as far to the
west as I ought, we shall some day or other get the benefit of the mistake.</p>
<p>Were it not for our starving condition, this, delay would be of no
consequence; yet, on the other hand, had we plenty of provisions, we could not
carry them; we have more things now than we can carry.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;Cloudy today, but no rain. The camels seem pretty fresh
now, so I shall break ground tomorrow at sunset, and go to the native camp,
about three miles distant, towards the south-west; this will save our carrying
water for a short distance over the sand-hills. Dennis White is ill; what is
the matter with him, or what has caused his illness, I cannot tell; he seems to
imagine the saltbush is at fault, but I think I have eaten more of it than any
one else, and have felt no ill effects. Most probably the camel-meat is the
delinquent. Got a good latitude by a lucky hit in the middle of the night;
Alpha Arietis and Canopus put me in latitude 20&deg; 7' 30", so I have nearly
one degree of latitude to play upon should want of water compel me to make more
southing than my westerly course requires. Half a gale of wind from the
south-east.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Cloudy in the morning, but cleared up at eight o'clock.
Dennis White still ailing, but not worse; he has had all the medicine our means
afford, and our medical ignorance can prescribe. Fortunately sickness in the
bush is rare.</p>
<p>Sent my son and Charley to the native camp, to make the blacks a little
present in return for the wallaby, but they had left, taking a west-south-west
course. I shall do the same; for as they had their women and children, as well
as a lame man on one leg and a stick, with them, they are not likely to have
gone away far from water. It is seldom that a crippled native is seen. This man
had met with some accident by which the sinew of his leg became contracted. I
shall stop at the well tomorrow to fill the bags and casks, and to look for the
best course. If we can only get on fifty or sixty miles more to the west, and
find a water to rest the camels on once more, I shall make a final push for the
Oakover River.</p>
<p>On reaching the native camp at 7 p.m., we found the well choked up with sand
from the gale on Monday. We were roused up at midnight by thunder and
lightning, and got everything under cover, and hoped for rain, but none
came.</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Cool air in the morning, which we found very reviving to
us all. We are weakened by want of food, and the extremely exhausting weather.
The well, when cleared, proves to be just sufficient for our personal use, but
there is no water for the camels. I sent Charley to run the tracks of the
natives who lately left this well; he reported that after running a short
distance south-west they turned south-east. Of course, no amount of water to
the south-east could be of any use to us, it would only take us farther from
the place we are trying to reach. I sent the camels back to No. 98 this evening
for water, and shall start tomorrow as nearly west as the sand-hills permit,
taking what Providence may be pleased to send us. I dare not take the camels
more than fifteen miles from water.</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;A strong south-west wind blowing. We started at 5 a.m.
towards the west, and crossed the sand-hills, which here run a little south of
west. Camped at a distance of eight miles. I think the country we have come
over this morning looks drier than any we have had for some time. Leichhardt
trees are again appearing, and they indicate a dry country. I shall halt here
tomorrow, and send Charley on my camel to see what hope there may be for us
ahead; if there is none, the camels will have only about eleven miles to get
back to No. 98. The prospect is gloomy enough, but it may brighten up a
little.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Windy, from the south-east. Sent Halleem and Charley on
camels to look after some smoke seen yesterday to the north-north-west. They
returned in the evening, quite unsuccessful.</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Smokes having been seen in the southward and westward, I
determined to have a trial in that direction before turning back. Sent Lewis
and Charley out early in the morning.</p>
<p>I took today a lunar distance of Pollux, computing the altitude of the moon,
which was too low to be got into the horizon glass; this put us in east
longitude 123&deg; 23' 45", a very close approximation to my dead reckoning,
which is 123.26. Lewis and Charley returned at 8 p.m.; they could find no
water, nor could they see any tracks. We are evidently in an evil piece of
country, no resource now left us but a return to No. 98.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started at daylight, and reached No. 98 at 9.15 a.m. We
here feel the advantage of not travelling very far from our last water, whilst
any uncertainty exists of our finding any before us.</p>
<p>One camel-man quite unable to move from a bad leg. He had an old sore on his
ankle, and one of the camels struck him upon it last night; it is an ugly
wound; I have plastered it as well as I can, and hope it will be better in a
few days.</p>
<p>This is Sunday. How unlike one at home!</p>
<p>Half-a-quart of flour and water, at 4 a.m.; a hard, sinewy bit of raw, that
is, sun-dried, but uncooked, camel meat, for dinner at 2 p.m. Supper uncertain,
perhaps some roasted acacia seeds; this is our bill of fare. These seeds are
not bad, but very small and very hard; they are on bushes, not trees, and the
natives use them roasted and pounded.<sup><small>4</small></sup></p>
<p><small>[<sup>4</sup> The acacia seeds here mentioned are contained in a long
pod, something like the shell of the French bean.]</small></p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Got a pigeon, and some flour and water for breakfast. We
can only allow ourselves a spoonful of flour each at a time, and it won't last
many days even at this rate.</p>
<p>Killed a large camel for food at sunset. We would rather have killed a worse
one, but this bull had, in the early part of our journey got a very bad back,
and was unable to work for a long time. His wound was not quite healed, when we
were compelled to load him, in consequence of the loss of our master bull, and
so the sore had broken out again, and would have rendered him unfit for work in
a day or two; and he might have fallen a prey to the maggots, as a former
sore-backed camel did, for they breed in these sores with such wonderful
rapidity, and in such prodigious numbers, that they eat the camel up in a short
time.</p>
<blockquote>[The number of flies in Australia, and the rapidity with which they
breed, are quite horrible. Nothing in the shape of meat can be left exposed for
a moment, otherwise a swarm of flies descend and seem to emit living maggots on
the flesh. They assail the ears, nostrils, and eyes of the traveller, who is
unable to stir without a veil, and in Colonel Warburton's expedition the
additional precaution of rubbing Holloway's ointment round the eye had to be
taken. Owing to the flies and the impoverished condition of the blood, the
slightest abrasion of the skin led to its festering and becoming an ugly wound.
A little scratch, that under other circumstances would pass unnoticed, here
became a troublesome, ulcerous sore. Some idea of the condition of this camel's
back may be imagined when the reader hears that the maggots were <i>scooped out
with a pint pot!</i>]</blockquote>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Cutting up and jerking camel-meat. The inside has given
us a good supper and breakfast. This is a much better beast than the old,
worn-out cow we killed before, and we have utilized every scrap, having had a
sharp lesson as to the value of anything we can masticate.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;A very hot day. Sent two men out with three days'
provisions to look for water to the southward. I hope they may succeed, as they
will be able to get to a distance of twenty or thirty miles. It is now a
fortnight since we first came to the water; all our efforts to get away have as
yet failed; we are imprisoned for the present as safely as we should be in
jail, only we are much worse fed.</p>
<p>I begin to think it is just possible we may be stopped here till the summer
tropical rains fall in January. The heat is now so fierce, that neither we nor
our camels could live long without an abundant supply of water; but such a
contingency as this would only be a prolongation of our sufferings, it would
not save us. I don't want to go south, for it increases the difficulty of
crossing the sand-hills, without diminishing the distance from the Oakover
River, but if we can find water, any direction (except east) is better than
staying here; we are all sick of the place.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Another roasting day.</p>
<p>24<i>th</i>.&mdash;A close, cloudy heat; looks like rain.</p>
<p>25<i>th</i>.&mdash;A little cooler. All the camel-meat has been successfully
jerked, and we have lived since the 20th on bone-broth and gristle. The birds
were getting shy, so when we killed the camel we gave them a rest; today we go
at them again. I hope the water-searchers will return this evening; our
prospects are not very bright under any circumstances, but if we get water
anywhere between south and west, we shall have a prospect of overcoming the
difficulties and dangers that threaten us.</p>
<p>Got a fair bag of Gular parrots today; they thought, perhaps, we had
forgotten them; I don't think they will stand this fun many more days.</p>
<p>26<i>th</i>.&mdash;A very oppressive, cloudy day, Lewis and Charley
returned, having found some moderate wells to the southward. They will not
advance us towards the river, but we have some southing to make, and we can do
it on known water, without which we dare not do much direct crossing the
sand-hills, and only by very short journeys. We must stay here a day or two to
give rest to the camels that have been out. If we can get to latitude 20&deg;
35' or 40', by easy steps, with water, then we may, perhaps, be able to run
from thence on a line nearly parallel with the sand-hills.</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camped.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Had hoped to have started this evening, but one of the
camels lately out looks in want of longer rest. I dare not move a tired camel
from here; they will need all the strength we can give them.</p>
<p>Excessive heat; distant thunder. Took a lunar last night, using Antaris by
computed altitude, it being too low for observation. The longitude is exactly
to a second the same as the last; a distance of about six miles hes between the
two places of observation. The first was taken with a waning moon at 4.30 a.m.
by Pollux, east of moon; the altitude of the moon was computed in the first
case, that of Antaris in the second. Every argument employed differed in one
instance from the other, yet both give exactly the same result, from which I
infer that neither are further in error than lunars usually are, and a few
miles one side or the other will not injuriously affect us. I may take the
result as near enough for our purposes.</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;A short rain-squall passed over us last evening; it has
cooled the ground a little. Economy is of course the order of the day in
provisions. My son and I have managed to hoard up about one pound of flour and
a pinch of tea; all our sugar is gone. Now and then we afford ourselves a
couple of spoonfuls of flour, made into paste. When we indulge in tea the
leaves are boiled twice over. I eat my sun-dried camel-meat uncooked, as far as
I can bite it; what I cannot bite goes into the quart-pot, and is boiled down
to a sort of poor-house broth. When we get a bird we dare not clean it, lest we
should lose anything.</p>
<p>More disasters this morning. One of our largest camel's very ill; the only
thing we could do for it was to pound four boxes of Holloway's pills, and
drench the animal I hope it may recover, for the loss would be ruinous, leaving
us with only five camels, and two of them very weak and uncertain.</p>
<p>One of the Afghans apparently wrong in his head; but it would answer no good
purpose to enter into details; he has caused us much inconvenience and
trouble.</p>
<p>In the evening the camel was still very sick. When once ill there is little
hope of them without suitable medicine, which we have not got, and long rest,
which we cannot give.</p>
<p>Very cloudy, but no rain, though it appears to be falling to the
southward.</p>
<p>30<i>th</i>.&mdash;Camel still very bad; going to try an enema from the
double-barrelled breech-loader. Our difficulty of getting on will be greatly
increased by the loss of this camel, which carries two men. We shall only have
five indifferent camels to carry seven men, with provisions and water, the
former light enough; but the water is very heavy, yet quite indispensable.
Should the animal be unable to travel, we must kill it, and cut off as much
fresh meat as we can carry.</p>
<p>The camel-man all right again, and the camel much better this evening. A
very cloudy and close night.</p>
<p>3l<i>st</i>.&mdash;Half a gale from the eastward; most disagreeable, as it
blows the sand over everything, and prevents our lighting a fire.</p>
<p>We started from camp No. 98 at 4.15 a.m., our general course being slightly
to the westward of south for eleven miles. The camels did the journey well. The
wind choked up the well, but it answers our purpose when cleared. We are all
most thankful to have got away from No. 98 at last. We have now two known
waters to the southward, which will give us all the southing we want; but
unfortunately no westing, and leaves us a longer distance for our rush than I
like; but I fear we must try it.</p>
<p>The weather being a little cooler, and the camels well watered, we started
again at 3.30 p.m. Reached our first well, over heavy sand-hills, at 7.30.
There is not much water, but enough for our uses. We are now in lat. 20&deg;
20', and long. by account 123&deg; 10'; so our position is good.</p>
<p><a name="ch-15" id="ch-15"></a><i>November</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Moderately
cool; sent to try the western well. If good enough for us to camp a day or two
upon, we shall go to it this morning; if not, we must camp at the middle one,
and get what water we can for the camels out of the three wells, distant about
a mile or two from each other. Camped at the middle well; the other one having
too much sand in it for a man to clear out. Tormented all night by the
ants.</p>
<blockquote>[A small black ant seems to have been the avowed enemy of this
expedition. The ground literally swarmed with them, and a stamp of the foot
brought them up in thousands. When the wearied men threw themselves down under
the shade of a bush, to snatch the half-hour's slumber their exhausted frames
required, the merciless little insects attacked them, and not only effectually
routed sleep, but even rendered a recumbent position impossible. The scanty
clothing possessed by the travellers was no protection; so feeble a bulwark was
speedily underrun by the enemy, and their successful invasion announced by
sharp painful nips from their powerful mandibles. Often, when the vertical sun
poured down in full fierceness on their heads, and the poor shade afforded even
by a bush would have been an inestimable blessing, the travellers were driven
away from the shelter by their relentless persecutors, and in despair flung
themselves down on the burning sand, where it was too hot even for an ant. By
day or by night the little insects gave them no respite.]</blockquote>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;The well affords sufficient for us, and I
send the camels to the others. The ants prevent our doing anything; they leave
us no peace. I am afraid of losing the moon, and the comparatively cool nights;
we are also eating up our small stock of camel-meat, so I must try to commence
our flight on the 4th.</p>
<p>The gale of adversity sends us scudding under bare poles; but it seems our
only chance to make a rush for the Oakover. We cannot hit upon any water more
to the westward to start from, so we must take our chance of finding a little
somewhere in the 150 miles of desert which separate us from that river. We had
the misfortune to lose our bottomless bucket by the falling in of our well
yesterday; fortunately no one was down it at the time, or he would have been
instantly killed, and we should have known nothing about it for a long time.
The depth of this well was unusually great, being over nine feet.</p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Hot day. The camels' well is a good one, and sufficient
for their wants.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;We are to commence our flight to the Oakover at sunset.
God grant us strength to get through! Richard is very weak, and so am I. To get
rid of a small box, we selected a few bottles of homoeopathic medicines for use
and ate up all the rest. How much of our property we had thrown away before we
resorted to this expedient of lightening the loads may be guessed. I started
later than we intended; our course about west by south. The sand-hills are more
troublesome than we have had them for some time. When we wanted to look north
and south for water, the sand-hills generally ran east and west; now, when we
particularly wish to avoid crossing them, we are compelled to do so from their
running north-west by west. The eclipse of the moon darkened our journey for
several hours, but we made a favourable stretch westward for the last few miles
of our night's journey. I could not go so far as I had hoped, from the
fatiguing character of the country. Camped at 3.15 a.m.</p>

<b>6. March during an Eclipse.</b></p>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;A strong east wind is blowing. We are compelled to give up
smoking whilst on short allowance of water. It is a deprivation, for smoke and
water stand in the place of food. We started west-south-west at 6.30 p.m., and
made twenty-five miles, though we had most trying sand-hills to cross. I became
quite unable to continue the journey, being reduced to a skeleton by thirst,
famine, and fatigue. I was so emaciated and weak I could scarcely rise from the
ground, or stagger half a dozen steps when up. Charley had been absent all day,
and we were alarmed about him when he did not return at sunset. I knew not what
to do. Delay was death to us all, as we had not water enough to carry us
through; on the other hand, to leave the camp without the lad seemed an inhuman
act, as he must then perish. It was six against one, so I waited till the moon
was well up, and started at 9 p.m. We made about eight miles, and whilst
crossing a flat heard, to our intense delight, a "cooee", and Charley joined
us. Poor lad, how rejoiced we were to see him again so unexpectedly! The lad
had actually walked about twenty miles after all the fatigue of the previous
night's travelling; he had run up a large party of natives, and gone to their
water. This news of more water permitted us to use at once what we had with us,
and the recovery of Charley put us in good spirits. It may, I think, be
admitted that the hand of Providence was distinctly visible in this instance. I
had deferred starting until 9 p.m., to give the absent boy a chance of
regaining the camp. It turned out afterwards that had we expedited our
departure by ten minutes, or postponed it for the same length of time, Charley
would have missed us; and had this happened there is little doubt that not only
myself, but probably other members of the expedition would have perished from
thirst. The route pursued by us was at right angles with the course taken by
the boy, and the chances of our stumbling up against each other in the dark
were infinitesimally small. Providence mercifully directed it otherwise, and
our departure was so timed that, after travelling from two to two hours and a
half, when all hope of the recovery of the wanderer was almost abandoned, I was
gladdened by the "cooee" of the brave lad, whose keen ears had caught the sound
of the bells attached to the camels' necks. To the energy and courage of this
untutored native may, under the guidance of the Almighty, be attributed the
salvation of the party. It was by no accident that he encountered the friendly
well. For fourteen miles he followed up the tracks of some blacks, though
fatigued by a day of severe work, and, receiving a kindly welcome from the
natives, lie had hurried back, unmindful of his own exhausted condition, to
apprise his companions of the important discovery he had made. We turned
towards the native camp, and halted a short distance from it, that we might not
frighten them away. I was so utterly exhausted when we camped, at 3 a.m., that
it was evident I never could have gone on after that night without more food
and water. I would therefore thankfully acknowledge the goodness and mercy of
God in saving my life by guiding us to a place where we got both.</p>
<p>7<i>th</i>.&mdash;Reached the well at 6 a.m. The natives fled at our
approach, but returned after a little time. Wallaby were procured from them by
barter. The fresh meat and plenty of water restored me for a time from my
forlorn condition. There are so many natives that they drink more of their own
water than we can well spare them. We obtained here the rest we all so much
needed.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>.&mdash;The natives all disappeared at daylight, and our hope of
more food goes with them. I have invariably throughout the journey carried my
pistol in my belt, but for the last few days its weight was too much for me,
and I had put it in my bag. Whilst lying under the shade of a blanket, with my
head on the bag, one barrel unaccountably went off, and had not the muzzle been
turned from me, I should have had the ball through my head. My life has again
been given to me. Our position now is lat. 20&deg; 41', long. (by account)
122&deg; 30'; so I hope we are not more than three days' journey from the
Oakover, and we expect to find some tributary before reaching the river itself.
We trust a better country may supply us with some means of getting food. The
natives at this camp have a large seashell for a drinking-cup; they have also
an old butcher's knife, and seem to be acquainted with cattle. I think they
have seen white men before. That they possessed a knowledge of cattle was
inferred from the signs they made, and from a tolerably good imitation of
lowing when they saw the camels. All these things cheer us with the hope of our
reaching a country in which we may find something to eat. The terrible
sand-hills we have crossed have impeded our progress, and the country yields us
nothing whatever; I cannot get even a crow or a snake. The sun-dried
camel-meat, affords us only a nominal subsistence; there is not a particle of
nourishment in it. We are not particular, and whatever we could get we should
eat. One of the camels reported to be ailing. These animals, though most
enduring when well, appear liable to many sudden and unaccountable maladies. We
started towards the west at 7 p.m. Crossed some sand ridges; but the flats,
though more extensive, are very bad for travelling over, being thickly covered
with immense tussocks of spinifex. This and the ailing camel lessened our
progress. Passed one small dry claypan and several ant-hills, which looks as if
we were gradually clearing those frightful sand-hills that have worn us out and
cost us so many camels. Camped at 3.30 a.m.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started west at 6.15 p.m. Crossed a few
sand ridges and wide plains thickly covered with spinifex, also two or three
water-courses (what a delight it is to see one again!) running, so far as we
could judge in the dark, from south to north. The ground seems to be rising.
Travelled about twenty-two miles.</p>
<p>10<i>th</i>.&mdash;After careful consideration of probabilities, and of the
general appearance of the country, I incline to the opinion that having got
into long. 121&deg; 50' (by account) it will be safer to run more to the
southward and get nearer to lat. 21&deg;. There seems to be no coast range
extending from north to south across us. There are only continuous high plains,
broken with sand ridges, running west-north-west, and thus it is possible we
might travel a long way parallel to the Oakover on a westerly course. Somewhere
farther south this high land must break into the watershed of all the rivers
that fall into the western sea, and we shall be likely to cut the Oakover
sooner by making twenty miles more southing. It is a most difficult country,
and nothing better than a guess can be made as to what its features are at a
short distance off. Certainly the view ahead is most cheerless, but it is
unsafe to build upon appearances. I fancy the high open land with sand ridges
extends north-west to the sea and is broken to the south-ward by the coast
range; but it is useless to hazard opinions in this country, for there is not a
single thing upon which we have formed strong conjectures and expectations that
has not turned out in the end quite different from our anticipations. We have
hoped for the best, but met with the worst; still we have much reason to be
thankful, for we are all alive and pretty well. Were it not for the sickness of
our camels, our own starving condition, and continued want of water, the doubts
about the physical geography of the country could soon be set at rest.</p>
<p>We are now at our last morsel of camel-meat, and if we can get water I must
kill again.</p>
<p>Started at 5.40 p.m., crossing a succession of very high sand-hills. At 8
p.m. saw what we took for a native fire to our left; turned towards it, but in
a couple of miles it disappeared and we renewed our course. Latterly sand-hills
have become more distant from each other and less high. Travelled over a good
deal of burnt ground, but got on pretty well. Camped at 3 a.m.</p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;With all the care we can take of the camels, and with the
lightest possible loads, they can barely do twenty miles in the whole night, so
we have yet a good stretch of country between us and the river.</p>
<p>We killed our last meat on the 20th October; a large bull-camel has
therefore fed us for three weeks. It must be remembered that we have no flour,
tea, or sugar, neither have we an atom of salt, so we cannot salt our meat. We
are seven in all, and are living entirely upon sun-dried slips of meat which
are as tasteless and innutritious as a piece of dead bark. Unless the game
drops into our hands in great abundance we must kill another camel directly we
get to water. Most of us are nearly exhausted from starvation, and our only
resource is a camel, which would disappear from before us in a twinkling.</p>
<p>Started at 6.15 p.m. Travelled five hours, then took a latitude, which put
us in 21&deg; 2', so we turned west for three hours more, completing twenty
miles over very hard country and heavy sand-hills.</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;We find no appearance of change in the country, and
suppose that we are either more to the eastward than we suppose, or else the
head of the Oakover is laid down more to the eastward than it is. The error is
most probably mine, as it is difficult to keep the longitude quite correct
after travelling so many months on a general westerly course. Our position is
most critical in consequence of the weakness of the camels. They cannot get
over this terrible country and stand the fierce heat without frequent watering
and rest. Without water we are helpless.</p>
<p>3 p.m. I have decided to send Lewis, the two camel-men, and the black boy on
ahead with the best and strongest camels, to try and reach the river, returning
to us with water if successful. My son and Dennis White and myself remain
behind, but following the first party as fast as our jaded camels can take us.
We have abandoned everything but our small supply of water and meat, and each
party has a gun.</p>
<p>Lewis and his party started at 6 p.m. We left ourselves at 6.30. We could
only make about four miles, when we lay down till 2 a.m. Starting again, we had
made about eight miles when we were surprised by a voice, and found we had
overtaken the advanced party, one of whose camels had knocked up on the
previous night. This was a death-blow to our hopes of getting relief by sending
them on first. We are hemmed in on every side; every trial we make fails, and I
can now only hope that some one or more of the party may reach water sooner or
later. As for myself, I can see no hope of life, for I cannot hold up without
food and water. I have given Lewis written instructions to justify his leaving
me, should I die, and have made such arrangement as I can for the preservation
of my journal and maps. The advance party has started again, and we followed
till a little after sunrise, when our camels showed signs of distress, and we
camped. Should the advance party see likely smokes they are to turn to
them.</p>
<p>My party at least are now in that state that, unless it please God to save
us, we cannot live more than twenty-four hours. We are at our last drop of
water, and the smallest bit of dried meat chokes me. I fear my son must share
my fate, as he will not leave me. God have mercy upon us, for we are brought
very low, and by the time death reaches us we shall not regret exchanging our
present misery for that state in which the weary are at rest.</p>
<p>We have tried to do our duty, and have been disappointed in all our
expectations. I have been in excellent health during the whole journey, and am
so still, being merely worn out from want of food and water. Let no
self-reproaches afflict any one respecting me. I undertook the journey for the
benefit of my family, and I was quite equal to it under all the circumstances
that could be reasonably anticipated, but difficulties and losses have come
upon us so thickly for the last few months that we have not been able to move;
thus our provisions are gone, but this would not have stopped us could we have
found water without such laborious search. The country is terrible. I do not
believe men ever traversed so vast an extent of continuous desert.</p>

<br>
<b>7. Worn out by Starvation.</b></p>
<p>We follow this afternoon on the advance tracks as far as our camels can take
us. Richard shot me a little bird. It was only about the size of a sparrow, but
it did me good. If the country would only give any single thing we could eat, I
should do very well, but we cannot find a snake, kite, or crow. There are a few
wallabies in the spinifex, but we cannot get them. Our miseries are not a
little increased by the ants. We cannot get a moment's rest, night or day, for
them.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;My rear party could only advance eight miles, when the
camels gave in. Our food is scanty enough, but our great want is water. We have
a little, but dare not take more than a spoonful at a time, whilst the heat is
so great that the slightest exposure and exertion bring on a parching thirst.
We are as low and weak as living men well can be, and our only hope of
prolonging our lives is in the advance-party finding some native camp; we have
seen smokes, but are in too crippled a state to go to them.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;Early this morning my son took our man White, and started
in the direction of the smoke we had last seen. At midday, whilst I was sipping
in solitude a drop of water out of a spoon, Lewis came up with a bag of water.
Never shall I forget the draught of water I then got, but I was so weak that I
almost fainted shortly after drinking it. The advance party had run tip a smoke
and found a well about twelve miles off. Our lives were saved, but poor Charley
was nearly killed. He had gone forward alone (at his own request, and as he had
done before) to the native camp, the remainder of the party with the camels,
keeping out of sight. The blacks treated Charley kindly, and gave him water,
but when he cooed for the party to come up, and the camels appeared, then I
suppose the men were frightened, and supposed Charley had entrapped them; they
instantly speared him in the back and arm, cut his skull with a waddy, and
nearly broke his jaw. I do not think this attack was made with any premeditated
malice, but doubtless they would have killed the lad, had not the remainder of
the party, rushing to his rescue, frightened them away. Unfortunately, the few
medicines we had not eaten had, by some oversight, been left behind at the
camp, where we abandoned almost everything but the clothes we happened to stand
up in. Lewis returned to the well, and was to come out and meet us next day
with more water. We started at sunset, but could not keep on the tracks for
more than two miles when we camped.</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;We made another effort at daylight to get on, but one of
the camels broke down, though it had not carried a saddle. The poor beast had
become quite blind, and staggered about in a most alarming way. We could not
get her beyond a mile and a half, when she knocked up under the shade of a
bush, and would go no farther. We therefore also sat down to await the water to
be sent out to us. The heat was intense, and my son, having been obliged to
walk because the camel could not carry him, suffered very greatly from thirst,
and had not water been brought us before midday, it would have gone ill with
him. Between 10 and 11 a.m. Lewis returned with water from the well.</p>
<p>The camel, though we gave it some water, could not move from the shade of
the bush. We tried to drive it, and to drag it, but to no purpose, therefore we
shot it. My son and White returned to the well for more water and to bring out
camels to carry the meat. Lewis remained with me to cut up the camel and
prepare it for carriage. We sent the head and tail, with the liver and half the
heart and kidneys, to make soup for Charley, and a little picking for the rest.
I hope the fact of the camel's head not having been turned towards Mecca, or
its throat cut by a "True Believer", may not prejudice the camel-men against
the use of what we send.</p>
<p>Cutting up the camel, and eating the "titbits", was the work of the day. We
have now only five camels, and one of them so weak it cannot carry a saddle.
Could we but reach the Oakover, we might manage some way or other, but the
camels <i>must</i> take us there, or we shall never see it. I am sanguine now
that we shall get there with at least four camels; two days ago I never
expected to be able to leave the spot I was lying upon.</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Last night there was a moist sea air and things we have
not had for a long time. Lewis and I stand steadily to the flesh-pots, the meat
is now all ready for transport when the camels come up. A little food, plenty
of water, and a sound night's rest have done me much good, though I am still
too shaky to walk more than a few yards. I took a latitude that night 21&deg;
0' 28", and time altitudes; watches 0&deg; 1' 25" slow. I have lost the shades
of my prismatic compass, and don't like meddling much with the sun, having
already lost the sight of my left eye.</p>
<p>Richard came up with the camels. Took ourselves and our small quantity of
scraggy meat to camp, where I found Charley better than I had expected, and I
have now strong hopes he will survive. Native Australians take an immense deal
of piercing and pounding without much permanent damage.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;Dew again, and a westerly wind at night. We have found at
this camp two large seashells, an old iron tomahawk, and part of the tire of a
dray, which looks hopeful. The well here is a good one, so I shall not move the
party from it till I know the distance I am from the river. I have made two
attempts at a rush to cover unknown distances, each one bringing us close up to
death. I will risk it no more, but shall send Lewis, who is the strongest of
the party, and one companion with the two best camels, on a course from west by
south to west-south-west. Two long night-marches ought, I think, to bring him
to some change in the country indicative of the vicinity of the Oakover.</p>
<p>A few days ago I thought we had done with the sand-hills. It was a bitter
mistake, we are as thick in them now as we were some months ago. Charley
progressing favourably.</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;A good south-west wind all yesterday, with cloudy sky
last night. This morning is calm, and it looks like rain to the west; not that
rain would be of much benefit to us now, for none of this country could hold a
drop of surface water for ten minutes together, but it would cool the air and
the ground, which is now almost red hot. Latitude by Aldebaran 20&deg; 55'
31".</p>
<p>Our detention here will most probably extend over this week. Lewis, who is
to start tonight in quest of the river, can scarcely get back under five days,
if so soon, and when he returns, the camels must have two or three days' rest.
It is thus we are so dreadfully delayed, whilst a close approach to starvation
is continually urging us forward. We have scarcely any meat, and that of the
worst possible quality, part of the old scarecrow camel. She was very old,
completely worn out and shrunk, so her meat can only last us a few days, and
gives us no nourishment. It is certainly no better than the dog's meat from a
knacker's yard, still it was better to eat her than let her die uselessly, for
she could not move. We have, however, plenty of water, which is an inestimable
blessing, and makes all our other wants comparatively unimportant.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;The heat was so oppressive yesterday afternoon that
Lewis's departure was put off till 5 a.m. today, when he and Halleem started,
well laden with water, but very deficient in food; my reckoning places us in
longitude 121&deg; 23', lat. 20&deg; 55', so I hope we may soon get to the
river.</p>
<p>My son is very ill, and so weak he can scarcely move. We have finished all
the meat we could scrape up to boil, and are now reduced again to a few bits of
dried camel and water for our daily fare. Very great heat.</p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;Very hot wind and unsettled weather. Nothing
doing&mdash;nothing to be done, except weak attempts to soften our scraps of
tasteless food.</p>
<p>Charley going on famously, and I hope by the time we are able to leave this
camp he may be all right.</p>
<p>My great anxiety is now how to keep the party alive. The meat we have will
not last more than a week; it is so insufficient in quantity and quality that
we are scarcely able to stand, and if there were any work to be done we should
not have strength to do it. If to meet this pressing want I am obliged to kill
another camel, the number will be so reduced that some of the party must walk,
whilst none are equal to the exertion.</p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;Thunder in the morning, every appearance of rain.
Forenoon, rain seems passing away from us, indeed it would be better for us if
it did, for we do not want water here, having no shelter and very scanty
clothing.</p>
<p>My son and I, like drowning men, catch at the smallest straw that seems to
offer a hope of escape from our present miserable condition, and we now fancy
that the entire absence of birds at this well may betoken the existence of
surface water, and better food for them, not very far off; but this, like all
other hopes and expectations, is probably a delusion. We must wait patiently
for Lewis's return. God grant us strength to bear bad news if he bring it! The
weather today is gusty, but a little cooler. Richard is very ill, and scarcely
able to crawl.</p>
<p>At 4.30 p.m. there was a short thunderstorm and a little rain. The night was
cloudy and damp.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Shot a kite, which served for dinner. Our dried meat,
such as it is, will not last two days more, if so long. This half-dead
creature, only gave us about 3 lbs. of dried meat each, and not a bubble of fat
was ever seen to rise on the buckets-full of its belongings that were
boiled.</p>
<p>There was thunder in the afternoon, but no rain. Cool and pleasant, damp
night.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Cool morning; southerly wind, thunder at
night. We are beginning to look anxiously for the return of our scanty party.
Three out of us five have been without any food for two days, excepting a few
small fruits that grow about here; they are filled with black seeds, which are
extremely bitter and have to be carefully extracted. We eat them raw and
boiled; the fruit is not absolutely unpleasant, but would not be esteemed a
delicacy had we anything else.<sup><small>5</small></sup></p>
<p><small>[<sup>5</sup> It is well for the travellers that the bitter seeds
were so carefully extracted. Dr. Hooker believes them to have belonged to a
species of <i>Strychnos</i>.]</small></p>
<p>We have but five camels left, one a weak, sickly cow; we may get a few days'
work out of her after this long rest, and I do not wish to kill her; first,
because she has not meat enough on her old bones to find us ten days' food; and
secondly, because if I can save any camels to take into the settled parts of
Western Australia, I should like to take a cow. It would cripple us greatly to
kill a bull, but it would keep us probably for three weeks. No doubt this
camel-killing will read badly, but the only alternative we have is to sit down
and die, and they after us, for they could not get a drop of water without our
help. Whether we kill or whether we don't kill, we are in a bad plight, and
cannot help ourselves.</p>
<p>Richard is very weak today; firewood is scarce, and we can scarcely collect
enough to boil a quart pot of water.</p>
<p>25<i>th</i>.&mdash;A very cool morning, which is a comfort to us. We have
cleared up all the wild fruit in the vicinity of our camp, and are not able to
go far to look for more.</p>
<p>I must defer killing till the last moment, but I don't see how I can put it
off beyond tomorrow. 5 p.m. Lewis has returned; from his report I infer that he
has struck the higher sources of the Oakover; the distance is greater than I
expected, but might I think be shortened by a due west course. The party being
now all together, we killed a camel at sunset, and supped largely off heart and
liver.</p>
<p>26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Boiled the kidneys and tongue for breakfast; we can
scarcely believe it. All hands are employed in cutting up and jerking meat. The
weather has been comparatively cool for the last day or two, which is a great
relief to us.</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;A cool pleasant morning. I am most anxious to move on
again, but our meat must be dried, and as soon as Richard is strong enough I
wish him to go back, and recover a gun and ammunition we left behind. It would
be awkward to find ourselves amongst game on the river and have no gun.</p>
<p>On plotting-out Lewis's journal, I see he reached as high as lat. 21&deg;
30'. I had never wished to get higher than 21&deg;, and if, instead of
following his course, we were to keep due west, I think the same distance of
travelling would put us thirty-miles or so lower down the river, and probably
give us better ground for the camels; moreover, as the northern bend of the
river runs down to 20&deg; 40', we must cut it at right angles, and could not
possibly be in danger of running parallel with it. My assistants are, however,
both averse to any other course than the known one, so I relinquish the plan,
though I still think it best.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;I sent off this morning to recover the gun and the rest
of the things we had left behind. I had a narrow escape from a snake-bite last
night. Whilst making from the camp-fire to my rug, I saw the reptile clearly in
the moonlight, but not in time to alter my stride, and trod upon it about six
inches above the tail. It turned upon me, of course, but whether it bit my
trousers or not I don't know; if it did, I derived some advantage from my extra
thinness, as it could not find the leg inside them.</p>
<blockquote>[They had seen very few snakes during the whole journey; indeed,
their absence was much regretted, for a snake nicely roasted in the ashes is a
delicacy not despised by bushmen who have good beef and mutton at their
command, and is a favourite article of diet with the natives throughout the
Australian Continent. This was the second time the leader had narrowly escaped
death within the last few days; first, by the unexpected explosion of his
pistol, and again by the bite of this reptile.]</blockquote>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;A little light rain. I hope the summer rains are not
going to set in early this year, as we have no protection whatever against
them. The country we are now in would not hold surface-water, and when we get
on the river we shall have plenty, so that heavy rain now would only perhaps
introduce fever and ague amongst us. We have suffered greatly from starvation;
but in other respects we are all in good health. 11 a.m.; Richard returned,
bringing the gun and our water-casks.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 30<i>th</i>.&mdash;We hope to start this evening if the
water-casks will hold. My two comrades joined this day with me in the prayers
and lessons of the first Sunday in Advent. I trust our misfortunes may yet bear
good fruit. 4 p.m.; casks will not hold, and I cannot go without them. The day
has been very hot. We have had our last boiling of bones, but got nothing to
eat off them, and the water they are boiled in is not so palatable as plain
water. We must commence on the jerked meat; but our supply is so small, that
injurious as it must be to our progress, another camel must fall when we get to
water, or near the river. A camel looks a very large animal, but gives little
meat compared with a bullock; and we have not a scrap of anything else, not
even a pinch of salt. Firewood is so scarce here, and our cooking utensils so
few, that we could scarcely keep our bucket boiling, or cook more than small
portions of the hide; it takes about forty-eight hours continuous boiling, and
is then very good.</p>
<p><a name="ch-16" id="ch-16"></a><i>December</i> 1<i>st</i>.&mdash;Unable to
start last night, and I dislike starting in the morning, because, on account of
those who have to walk, an early halt is necessary before the sun gets too hot;
and thus we consume a whole day's water, whilst performing a half-day's
work.</p>
<p>I trust we may get off with the moonlight. It is very unlucky that Charley,
who is by far our best walker, should be now unable to walk. We must do our
utmost to get on to some water quickly, that we may shorten our protracted
starvation, and its consequent sickness. I hope to do so on the fourth day.</p>
<p>A high hot wind all day. We have four days of great trial to men in our weak
condition; but if we can scramble over the next sixty miles we may hope to get
some game. This is a most desolate camp; no firewood, little for the camels to
eat, and not a living creature but ourselves. Even when the camel carcase was
on the ground, not a single kite had the curiosity to come and see what was
going on. There is water, but nothing else.</p>
<p>Started at 10 p.m.; the earliest hour at which we could get water enough to
satisfy all the camels. As three of the party had to walk, and the flats and
sand-hills were extremely bad, our progress was slow; by 3.30 a.m. we had made
ten miles; then camped.</p>
<p>2<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Toiled along for twenty miles; hoped to have got an hour
or two of sleep, but the ants forbade it. Night-work, tropical heat, no sleep,
poor food, and very limited allowance of water, are, when combined, enough to
reduce any man's strength; it is no wonder then that I can scarcely crawl. What
a country! did ever men before traverse such a tract of desert? I think
not.</p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Another twenty miles. Again tormented with ants, and could
get no rest. They will not allow us to have any shade. I cannot stay under a
bush, but am compelled in sheer despair to throw myself on the burning sand,
and let the sun pour down upon me; this makes it too hot for the ants, and
almost too hot for me also.</p>
<p>4<i>th</i>.&mdash;Moved off this wretched place at noon; the camels did not
feed, and we could get no rest, so there was no use in stopping; but one camel
quickly knocked up with the heat, and we camped till 7 p.m. I became so ill
this afternoon that I was quite unable to sit on the camel, and had to be tied
at full length on the animal's back. What a jolting I got, as the long-legged
animal took me head-foremost down the steep sand-hills.</p>
<p>These sand-hills never left us till we got on to the stony range, where at
2.15 a.m. we camped on a rocky creek, tributary to the Oakover.</p>
<p>We are all most thankful to have escaped with our lives out of the horrible
desert which has so long hemmed us in on every side. We are now clear, and if
we can by any means procure subsistence on the river and save our camels, we
shall get down nicely. I cannot describe our joy at being once more on
surface-water. The camels behaved nobly, and carried us over this last twenty
miles in seven hours.</p>
<p>5<i>th</i>.&mdash;We halted on the creek; it is a very stony place, and
there is little to be got, except some small red-rock pigeons, and a few
bronze-wings in the evening; but these are very difficult to get at, and I
think nearly all that were shot were kindly given to me. I am much better, but
Richard is lamentably weak, and in trying to walk across some rocks, fell, and
gave himself a very ugly wound in the leg. A sharp rock cut a large piece out
of the shin. This unfortunate accident gave much pain and inconvenience.</p>
<p>6<i>th</i>.&mdash;Started early down the creek. What a change from the
terrible country we have so long been on! How beautiful the trees and the rank
vegetation looked!</p>
<p>We saw a nice place, with plenty of eatable birds flying about it, but could
not stop there, as two of the party had gone on to look for a lost book, and
they expected us to overtake them.</p>
<p>At 10.30 we camped on a brackish water, a poor place, and unfit to remain
in. Some of the party had been two days without food, and the only thing we
could get here was bulrush roots.<sup><small>6</small></sup> They are very
nutritious, and indeed very good, when of proper age, and either roasted in the
ashes or boiled.</p>
<p align="center"><small>[<sup>6</sup> Probably a species of
<i>Typha</i>.]</small></p>
<p>We returned to the place we had left in the morning. My son remained in a
stony gap we passed, to try to shoot some wallaby. We camped on the creek, at
the urgent request of the camel-men, who said they were quite exhausted. Killed
a camel by moonlight. We supped off the handiest parts of the inside, and lay
down thoroughly tired. The ground was covered with stones, and infested with
ants, so we could not be still for half an hour.</p>
<p><i>Sunday</i>, 7<i>th</i>.&mdash;A most miserable day. Trifling as it may
appear, the ants prevent our having a moment's rest, night or day, and we don't
know where or how to escape them. We cut up and jerked the camel-meat; it is
surprising how little nourishment there is in this food; it appears to do us no
good. Caught a few small fish, which were greatly relished, and of real
benefit.</p>
<p>8<i>th</i>.&mdash;A few more small fish were caught today. As we must let
our meat dry, and eat up all that can be got from the bones, I remain here.</p>
<p>The three camels now left will be all the better for a few days' rest, with
plenty of water. This is a very rough creek, but it is even now, after this
long drought, splendidly supplied with water. There are large rocky cisterns,
as square and smooth as if cut by the hands of a man.</p>
<p>Whether a more generous diet will restore me, I cannot say; but at present,
though not starving, I am so shaken by past suffering, that I require support
from some one when travelling over anything like broken ground. Richard is in
great pain from his wound, and a perfect cripple. The heat is very trying.</p>
<p>I now find my aneroid barometer is spoilt. This is a great misfortune, as I
don't know when, it got injured, and therefore cannot tell the date up to which
its daily readings can be relied upon. I never anticipated such an instrument
going wrong; but it was a great mistake on my part not to have taken a second
one. I have three watches constantly going, and perhaps an explorer should have
each instrument in triplicate, that he may more readily detect the one in
error.</p>
<p>9<i>th</i>.&mdash;Two of us slept, or rather passed the night, on the banks
of another waterhole (or basin), to try for some fish at daylight, but we could
not get a single bite. A light twine-net would now be worth its weight in
diamonds to us, let no Australian traveller ever go out again without one.</p>
<p>For the last three days we have been living on fresh meat, but none of us
find ourselves a bit stronger, in fact we are falling off day by day, and if
this continue, the strongest will be unequal to the least exertion.</p>
<p>The only plan I can devise, though full of danger in consequence of the near
approach of the summer tropical rains, is to locate the party on the best place
we can find on the Oakover, then to send two men down the river, to look for
the station of the settlers, and procure us some help both in food and
carriage; without flour we shall never recover our strength to walk. By this
plan, too, I should be able to send word that we are still alive.</p>
<p>We had no sleep again last night, owing to the tormenting ants. These
terrible insects never sleep, and are just as numerous and busy on the bare
rock as they were on the soft sand or loose stones.</p>
<p>10<i>th</i>.&mdash;We started on the journey down the creek, but could only
make three miles over very rough but pretty country, with many magnificent
gorges; if we had only provisions and time, these ranges would well repay a
careful examination.<sup><small>7</small></sup></p>
<p><small>[<sup>7</sup> "I observe that they have not been named; had it been
within my province to name them, I should have liked to have marked them as the
Rawlinson Ranges. This would have given me a double pleasure, as a tribute to
the high talent that has raised Sir Henry Rawlinson to his present eminent
position as President of the Royal Geographical Society; also, because we were
at one time brother-officers in the Bombay army, Sir Henry being, if I rightly
recollect, an ensign in the 1st Grenadiers Regiment, when I was an ensign
attached to the 2nd Grenadiers; but as the ranges belong to Western Australia,
and were not discovered by me, I could not take this liberty without the
special sanction of his Excellency Governor Weld, whom I was not fortunate
enough to meet."&mdash;P. E. W.]</small></p>
<p>I have never seen any creek so splendidly watered, although there does not
appear to have been any rain here for the last twenty months. Most of the
waters are in large rocky basins, and there is no escape for them except by
evaporation; the high, indelible marks on the rocks show the great depth of
water in good seasons, as well as the length of time it remains at that level.
There is no district half as well watered in the MacDonnell Ranges, so far as
we saw.</p>
<p>11<i>th</i>.&mdash;We continued down the creek, and cut the Oakover at the
distance of about seven miles, a little below where the creek joins it. Our
latitude is 21&deg; 11' 23". We branded a tree, to mark the spot at which we
came upon the river.</p>
<p>This must be a noble river when the floods come down. The bed is wide and
gravelly, fringed with magnificent cajeput or paperbark trees. How grateful is
its lovely and shady refuge from the burning sun after the frightful sandhills
in which we have been so long baked! I was lost in admiration. We camped on a
waterhole, but the bed of the river was dry.</p>
<p>We shot some cockatoos, and had some camel's foot for a meal. This latter is
a delicacy, but troublesome to cook. I shall, no doubt, appear to dwell too
much upon eating; but it is difficult for starving men to keep their minds from
thinking of what they once had, and now so urgently need. The heat is
increasing daily.</p>
<p>12<i>th</i>.&mdash;Went three miles down the river to another waterhole and
camped, as I am anxious to send Lewis off without delay. We had a beautiful
ride, but this is not a better place for birds than the one we left. I obtained
a shag&mdash;<i>Phalacrocorax Carbo&iuml;des</i>
(Gould)<sup><small>8</small></sup>&mdash;for breakfast; the flesh is not
particularly delicate, but the inner parts are large and savoury.</p>
<p><small>[<sup>8</sup> The habits of this bird are precisely similar to those
of the Cormorant of Europe.]</small></p>
<p>Wrote my letters; whether they will ever reach their destination, I know
not.</p>
<p>13<i>th</i>.&mdash;I sent off Lewis and one Afghan on the only two camels
that would travel. They are to look for the station of Messrs. Harper and Co.;
we do not know how far it may be, or whether it may not have been abandoned;
but must take our chance; it is the only one we have.</p>
<p>It blew today half a gale of wind from the north-ward. Richard's leg is
still very bad, and he is quite unable to walk.</p>
<p>14<i>th</i>.&mdash;I should have liked during Lewis's absence to have crept
down the river, so as to reduce his return distance, but our only camel is
completely done up, and we can get no more work out of the poor beast. Neither
my son nor myself can walk a hundred yards. Dennis White has no boots, so he
cannot get over the stones. The Afghan and Charley might travel a couple of
miles a day; still, could we all walk a little, we must have some animal to
carry our blankets and the bucket we cook in. The camel has plenty of water and
good-looking feed, but it keeps falling off; the desert has been too much for
it, as it has been for us. We must kill the creature in due course for food,
and can only hope it will not die before its day arrives. We cannot get any
game at this hole, and the ground is too low to be safe at this uncertain time
of year, so we move down a little tomorrow. Floods occur in Australia without
much or any warning.</p>
<p>15<i>th</i>.&mdash;Went a short way down the river to a gully with a good
water-hole, and fixed our camp on high ground on the edge of the river.</p>
<p>Trusting to game is a very precarious mode of getting food. One day a few
small fish may be caught, next day not one will look at the bait. There are
bustards, but we can only see them; there are no opossums; the ducks dislike
sitting down by us, and we are not able to go to them. The trees have all been
carefully searched by the blacks for native honey, they have left none for us;
could we find some, it would be an indescribable treat after having been so
long without sugar and salt. Though we are in a better country, we can get
little beyond our camel-meat. Richard does his best, but he is quite lame, and
very weak; as for myself, I cannot stagger 100 yards, and the recoil of a gun
would knock me down.</p>
<p>I am quite satisfied that we could not have travelled three miles a day, and
that our only chance lies in getting succour from the station.</p>
<p>A rough high wind all day; cloudy, and threatening rain, which will damage
us greatly, as we have no clothes and no shelter.</p>
<p>A steady rain fell all night, after a heavy gale of wind. We have large fish
in our water-hole, but can't catch them.</p>
<p>16<i>th</i>.&mdash;Cloudy and cool. We have a beautiful place for bathing,
and enjoy it greatly in our dirty, dilapidated condition. Rain off and on all
day and night, greatly increasing our discomfort and spoiling the few things we
possess; we are nearly naked, lying on the wet ground, and wet through
ourselves; yet we none of us suffer in point of health, it is simply
unpleasant.</p>
<p>17<i>th</i>.&mdash;A fine forenoon; dried ourselves. Misfortune seems, both
in small and great matters, to dog us with unwearied persistence. Richard got a
large fish at his bait this morning, but before he could land it his line was
bitten in two; the loss of a delicious breakfast was no small disappointment to
hungry men.</p>
<p>The day has been fine, and we are all well dried again, ready for the next
soaking. This is the first rain we have had since the 1st August; when we were
in the sandy desert, it would have been beyond all price to us&mdash;but now
that we are well supplied with water, rainy weather seems likely to stop us as
much as want of water did before. I waited four months at Alice Springs for the
summer rain to help me over the country&mdash;none fell; now I am about 100
miles from the finish, the summer rain seems likely to come on early, and may
keep us out till we are web-footed and speckle-stomached. We count the hours of
Lewis's absence, and hope for his return in about ten days; we cannot realize
the idea of getting a bit of bread again. Our camp-followers are not provident
with their food, and I shall have to kill our last camel soon.</p>
<p>18<i>th</i>.&mdash;Richard went up the river to try for some birds. He shot
one teal, and a hawk was kind enough to strike a fine black duck which he
rescued from its talons, and which gave us a splendid dinner. We cannot get the
fish to bite, which is very tantalizing. Night set in squally and wet with
strong north wind.</p>
<p>19<i>th</i>.&mdash;I hope the new moon may bring us fine weather. We cannot
jerk our meat without the sun, and we must kill it immediately, there not being
a scrap of food in the camp. Shot a bird which looked like a pheasant, but
unfortunately rather small.<sup><small>9</small></sup> It cleared up at noon,
so we killed, skinned, and cut up our last camel. Heavy-feeding all evening;
fine night.</p>
<p><small>[<sup>9</sup> This very remarkable bird has all the appearance of a
pheasant, although it is in reality much more nearly allied to the cuckoos. It
is no doubt the <i>Centropus maelurus</i>, which is probably a mere variety of
<i>C. Phasianus</i> (the "pheasant-cuckoo of Australia"), figured in Gould's
<i>Birds of Australia</i>. Little is known of the habits of either, but they
are distributed over the entire Australian continent.]</small></p>
<p>20<i>th</i>.&mdash;To our great surprise we were awakened at 3 a.m. by the
roaring of running water. The river was down, running with a current of about
three knots an hour. In the evening there was not a drop of water in the bed of
the river,&mdash;in the morning a stream 300 yards wide was sweeping down with
timber and ducks floating on it. It was well for us we had shifted our camp and
got on high ground. The sight was most beautiful at sunrise, and indeed this is
a noble river, even high up it as we are.</p>
<p>Jerking meat and eating all day; the weather is most favourable. What a
change, from draining a quart pot an hour from a sand-hole under intense heat
and thirst, to our present quiet admiration of a gliding stream such as the
Oakover!</p>

<br>
<b>8. The Last Camel.&mdash;Camp on the Oakover.</b></p>
<p>21<i>st</i>.&mdash;A beautiful day; the meat is drying nicely, but there is
very little of it; and that very poor; no wonder, as the beast was quite worn
out, and had been carrying a load from February to December without a rest. We
are boiling down the hide, and hope for good food from it; the head, feet, and
tail are the treasures.</p>
<p>The river is drying up again, but this flood will fill all the water-holes,
and we shall find water everywhere when we begin to travel down stream.</p>
<p>22<i>nd</i>.&mdash;Another fine day for our meat; a good roasting sun. The
flood has left us a magnificent water-hole, thirty to forty feet deep, and
nicely shaded. We enjoy floating in it, for we are so weak on land, we feel a
peculiar delight in the support the water affords us.</p>
<p>23<i>rd</i>.&mdash;A very hot day. Obtained two wood-ducks (<i>Dendrocygna
Gouldii</i>) and a scrap of honey; how delicious it was, after having been so
long deprived of the strengthening and useful properties of sugar! My son and I
no longer eat the hide; we do not find it does us the least good in adding to
our strength, whilst it smells and tastes so exactly like a carpenter's
glue-pot, it makes us sick.</p>
<p>Our camp is infested with scorpions, which is unpleasant, as we all go about
bare-footed. Sahleh the camel-man is a professed oriental snake-charmer, and
declares he can handle snakes and scorpions with impunity. I listen with
becoming outward gravity, but as he happens to have lost the use of one hand
and arm from the stroke of a scorpion, I have not much inward faith in his
powers of enchantment. He himself accounts for the mishap by a disparaging
statement in respect to the scorpion's birth, it was a base-born scorpion, and
stung him whilst he was asleep. Thunder and lightning with a little rain during
the night.</p>
<p>24<i>th</i>.&mdash;It looks as if heavy rain were not far from us. We are
now on our jerked meat again. Got today a small wallaby and a cock pheasant.
This bird has regular black bristles on its neck instead of feathers.</p>
<p>I am now beginning to hope for Lewis's speedy return. If there really be any
station on the De Grey, he ought to have reached it in five days, and allowing
the same time to come back, with two or three days at the station to collect
horses and stores, he should be due after a fortnight's absence. This is his
twelfth day.</p>
<p>Our great fear is that there may be no station at all upon the De Grey
(these far-off stations are sometimes suddenly abandoned), and that he may make
for Roebourne, How he can hold out for such a distance on his scanty supply of
food, or how we are to keep up on ours for such a length of time, I know not.
We must hope no such misfortune will happen to us, for we are quite unable to
walk.</p>
<p><i>Christmas Day</i>.&mdash;We cannot but draw a mental picture of our
friends in Adelaide sitting down to their Christmas dinner, whilst we lie
sweltering on the ground starving, and should be thankful to have the pickings
out of any pig's trough. This is no exaggeration, but literal truth. We cut out
three bee-holes today, but found no honey in any of them. No sign of Lewis. If
he is not here by the close of Sunday next, I shall be obliged to suppose he
has gone to Roebourne, in which case there can be no hope of his return for the
next three weeks, and, except God grant us His help, we cannot live so long on
our present supply.</p>
<p>Our lives have been preserved through many and great dangers, so my trust is
in God's mercy towards us; it never fails, though it does not take always the
course we look for.</p>
<p>We fancied we should find many opossums in the gum-trees, but have not seen
one. We have fish close to us, but though we deprive ourselves of the entrails
of a bird as bait, they will not take it. We eat everything clean through, from
head to tail. Prejudiced cooks may not accept my advice, but I am quite
satisfied all birds ought to be cooked whole, extracting what you please
afterwards. We omitted the latter operation, but this is a matter depending on
circumstances.</p>
<p>Our last Christmas at Alice Springs was miserable enough, as we then
thought, but the present one beats it out and out.</p>
<p>26<i>th</i>.&mdash;Desperately hot, but still dry. Obtained a shag and two
white cockatoos. Richard's leg is improving, yet he is exceedingly weak; not
very much better than I am.</p>
<p>27<i>th</i>.&mdash;Passed in our ordinary heated idleness.</p>
<p>28<i>th</i>.&mdash;Threatening rain, but none fell. How heavily time hangs
on our hands! We drink, smoke, and sleep as much as we can, then talk about
what we should like to eat.</p>
<p>29<i>th</i>.&mdash;Sahleh's finger is very bad indeed from the scorpion
sting. The state of our blood allows no wound to heal of itself, and I have no
medicine suitable to his case. If it continues to get worse without any
prospect of surgical aid, some one (not I) will have to chop his finger off
with a tomahawk, or he will lose his arm and his life.</p>
<p>Lewis not having returned, I am compelled to think either that there is no
station on the De Grey, or that he has missed it and gone on to Roebourne, in
which case he cannot be back for a fortnight. Our position stands
thus:&mdash;We have abundance of water, a little tobacco, and a few bits of
dried camel. Occasionally an iguana or a cockatoo enlivens our fare; and
lastly, I hope the late rain will bring up some thistles or some pig-weed that
we can eat. Our difficulties are, to make our meat last, though, so far from
doing us good, we are all afflicted with scurvy, diarrh&oelig;a, and affection
of the kidneys from the use of it. We cannot catch the fish, we cannot find
opossums or snakes, the birds won't sit down by us, and we can't get up to go
to them. We thought we should have no difficulty in feeding ourselves on the
river, but it turns out that from one cause or another we can get very little,
and we are daily dropping down a peg or two lower.</p>
<p>I am, however, satisfied that sending down to look for the station was our
best plan; if it fail, the two who have been sent may save their lives, and we
have a chance of saving ours if we can only hold out, whereas had we all
remained, we should have eaten the two camels that are gone, and scarcely have
progressed twenty miles; after that our case would have been hopeless. I cannot
tell how it may turn out, but I do not regret the measure. We must wait
patiently. I am sure Lewis will do all that can be done. His endurance,
perseverance, and judgment are beyond all praise, and his various services have
been most valuable. My great fear is that the summer rains may set in and stop
his return, but we must hope for the best.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<p>A few hours after making the above entry in my journal Lewis returned with
an ample supply for all our wants, and with six horses to carry us down!</p>
<p>I need not say how thankful we were, or how quickly we set to work at the
food. The camels with the heavier supplies are to come up tomorrow. We all feel
most grateful to Messrs. Grant, Harper, and Anderson for their promptitude and
liberality.</p>
<p>30<i>th and</i> 31<i>st</i>.&mdash;My companions are all eating to the
extent of their powers; for myself, I was too weak to stand the sudden change
of food, and am ill in consequence.</p>
<p align="center"><a name="pic09" id="id11"></a><img alt="" src=

<b>9. The Relief.</b></p>
<p><a name="ch-17" id="ch-17"></a><i>January</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1874.&mdash;I am
still on the sick-list, but improving. The horses and camels will, I hope, be
ready to start on Saturday. It appears that the station is sixteen miles from
the coast and 170 miles from us. I never dreamt of its being such a
distance.</p>
<p>I trust this new year may be more happy to us all than the last has been.
Perhaps few men ever spent a more miserable one than we have.</p>
<p>Sahleh's finger looks very angry indeed. He may escape the tomahawk, but can
hardly be spared the knife.</p>
<p>Thunderstorm in the evening.</p>
<p>2<i>nd</i>,&mdash;All hands recruiting.</p>
<p>3<i>rd</i>.&mdash;Started today on our journey down the river. For the first
few days I had to be lifted on the horse's back, but exercise and food
gradually enabled me to get through the day's work, and we reached the station,
170 miles distant, on the 11th January, 1874.</p>
<p>On the 21st we started on Messrs. Grant and Co.'s horses for Roebourne, and
arrived there, 170 miles farther, on the 26th.</p>
<p>On the 17th February we left Copack on board the "Mary Ann" schooner, put
back on account of leaks on the 18th, and sailed again on the 21st, arriving at
Fremantle on the 25th March, and proceeding to Perth the same day. Travelled
300 miles from Perth to Albany. On Wednesday sailed from Albany, and landed at
Glenelg on Easter Sunday, 2.30 a.m.</p>
<hr>
<br>
<p>I have now only to close my journal. All distances forwards and backwards
included, our land travelling, as nearly as I can estimate it, has amounted to
4000 miles, and our sea voyage to 2000.</p>
<p>We have all got through our trials better than could have been expected. I
believe my son and myself are the only two European sufferers. I have lost the
sight of one eye, and my son is much shaken in health. Sahleh the Afghan left
his finger in Roebourne. Beyond this I know of no harm that has been done.</p>
<p>We started with seventeen camels and ended with two. The following is the
list of casualties:&mdash;1 camel poisoned; 4 lost (they ran away); 3 left
behind in the desert, unable to move; 7 killed for food; 2 survivors left on
the De Grey&mdash;total, 17.</p>
<p>And now, in conclusion, I would desire first to acknowledge with praise and
thanksgiving the goodness and mercy of the Almighty God towards us in saving
our lives through many perils. Then I would express our gratitude to the whole
colony of Western Australia. Nothing could possibly exceed the hospitality,
kindness, and generosity with which we were treated by private individuals, by
communities, and by the Government. All our wants were anticipated; we were
received as honoured guests, and welcomed everywhere by all classes. All our
expenses were paid by the Government, and we were landed at the cost of Western
Australia on the jetty at Glenelg.</p>
<p>The settlers in the north-west honoured us at Roebourne with a complimentary
address and a public dinner. We were unavoidably detained there a long time,
and I cannot therefore forbear mentioning the names of some gentlemen from whom
we received special kindness. These were&mdash;Messrs. Grant, Harper, and
Anderson, De Grey Station; Mr. McKay, of the Yule River; Mr. Sholl, Government
Resident at Roebourne; Messrs. Pearse, Blackall, and others, also of Roebourne.
To Mr. G. Howlett also we are particularly indebted, not only for hospitality
and kindness during our long stay at Roebourne, but also for his unremitted
care for our comfort and welfare on board the schooner "Mary Ann", of which he
was owner and our fellow-passenger.</p>
<p>On our arrival at Fremantle, at Perth, and at Albany, every possible honour
and kindness were shown us by the municipalities, and by private persons, the
Government at each place giving its official stamp to the general feeling of
the colony by its desire to do us honour, and by the liberality with which that
desire was carried into effect.</p>
<p>Our journey has been a very hard one, and we have suffered great privations;
but they could not have been guarded against, because we did not know the
nature of the country we had to cross. Others who may follow us will, I hope,
find better country, and, as a necessary consequence, have easier work.</p>

<h4><a name="ch-18" id="ch-18">NOTE.</a></h4>
<p>The following general remarks on the physical configuration of Australia and
its geological causes, by Professor Owen, communicated in a note to a friend of
Colonel Warburton, will be read with great interest:&mdash;</p>
<p>In one of those wave-movements of earth's crust, which at its height divides
the waters and "makes the dry land appear", the present continent of Australia
resulted. But as such earth-wave attains the level which the sea is compelled
by gravitation to keep, the contest begins between land and water. Attaining
the upper fathoms of sea put in motion by planetary, atmospheric, and
terrestrial influences, the opposition of the risen crust to the currents,
undulations, storm-waves, leads to wear, waste, and destruction proportionate
to the time elapsing ere the headlands finally emerge above the dash of the
highest tide-waves.</p>
<p>The south-eastern part of Australia has benefited by this battle, through
the resulting loss, or capture by the sea, of much of the later (tertiary)
deposits which it had received during its time of submergence, prior to the
upheaval.</p>
<p>The consequent exposure of the older secondary, but especially of the
primary or "Pal&aelig;ozoic" formations, is the main geological condition, not
only of the access to mineral wealth, but of the fertility of the Provinces of
Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia; through the quaternary
subaerial formations which have here and there accumulated since those parts of
Australia became dry land. Where the tertiary submarine formations have escaped
the denuding action of the land's rise, they are, in the main, of a barren,
sandy nature, opposing thirsty spinifex plains to the progress of the
explorer.</p>
<p>Under the name "Western Australia", about one-third of the continent is
assigned to this province. Such observation as has hitherto been made,
recognizes a poor or barren sand and sandstone with small oases, few and far
between. The testimony of Colonel Warburton coincides with this view of its
geology; but conclusions should not be arbitrarily stretched beyond experience,
nor further explorations discouraged.</p>
<p>According to the limits of present geological observation, what is the
exception in the east and south-east becomes the rule in the west and
south-west of Australia. Sandy gravels, or infertile whitish marls, become, to
the westward, more uniformly barren sandstones of tertiary and cretaceous ages,
and such seem, as a rule, to have formed the soil over which Colonel Warburton
perseveringly pushed on his course.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-19" id="ch-19">NOTE ON THE VALUE OF CAMELS IN AUSTRALIAN
EXPLORATION.</a></h3>
<h4>BY COLONEL P. E. WARBURTON.</h4>
<p align="center">(<i>Note appended to his Journal.</i>)</p>
<p>It may perhaps be useful to others, should they have an opportunity of
getting camels, to know that, in my opinion, they are of all animals the most
suitable to Australian explorations. It is quite certain we never should have
reached the western coast with any others. No doubt in some countries it may be
expedient to have horses as well as camels, but this entirely depends upon the
character of the country. No horses could have lived with us.</p>
<p>Camels alone can travel over any but a boggy country. Horses alone are
useless where there is no feed and little water, but excellent where both are
abundant. I, however, have never found any such country.</p>
<p>Camels <i>and</i> horses <i>may</i> do well together, but the chances are
they will be in each other's way&mdash;that is, in dry, grassless country the
camels get on and the horses cannot. Amongst salt lakes, swamps, &amp;c.,
horses will do well and camels are useless, so they stop each other, unless the
country is all through good for both&mdash;a very rare occurrence indeed.</p>

<h3><a name="ch-20" id="ch-20">SUBSEQUENT PROCEEDINGS</a> OF THE
EXPEDITION,</h3>
<h5><small>AND</small></h5>
<h3>RETURN TO ADELAIDE.</h3>
<h4><small>BY C. H. EDEN.</small></h4>
<br>
<blockquote>It will be seen that after reaching the station of Messrs. Grant,
Harper, and Anderson, Colonel Warburton says but little of himself and his
companions, for the civilized districts had been attained, and his work as an
explorer was over. But it is only due to the party to mention the enthusiastic
reception they met with in every portion of Western Australia, where the
importance of the work so successfully achieved was perhaps more apparent to
the inhabitants of that colony than it could be to the people of England.
Living on the spot, they knew the dangers and difficulties that had been
surmounted, and their hearty recognition of the achievements of the explorers
proved the great value they attached to their labours.
<p>How terribly slowly the days must have dragged away for the five men left on
the Oakover, the reader of the journal may well imagine. Fish were seen close
to them, but they refused to be caught; other game they were too weak to look
for; death by starvation stared them in the face, unless Mr. Lewis speedily
returned. The following is a copy of the letter addressed by Colonel Warburton
to Mr. Elder, and entrusted to Mr. Lewis; it gives a better idea in a few words
of the forlorn condition of the party than even the leader's entries in his
diary:&mdash;</p>
<p align="right">"Camp on the Oakover, lat. 21&deg; 9',&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
"December 13, 1873.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<small>DEAR MR. ELDER</small>,&mdash;We are all alive, and that is all. We
have lost everything, and have only two camels left out of seventeen. Our
journey has been difficult beyond all I had supposed possible. We are reduced
to such a state by famine that we can scarcely crawl 100 yards, and are quite
incapable of hard work, or indeed any work at all.</p>
<p>"I send two men with two camels to try to get some help from the station on
the De Grey, and this goes by them. I cannot now give you details, not knowing
who your agents in Perth are. I have written to the Governor of Western
Australia to take steps through your agent to send a small craft to take us to
Perth. This is the only way we can get there. We are unable to go by land. It
would require an entire new fit out, and would cost much.</p>
<p>"I may safely say no exploring party ever endured such protracted suffering
as we have done, nor did any one ever cross, with their lives, so vast an
extent of continuous bad country. A man gets great credit for exploring such a
country as we are now in: it is mere child's play; whilst we unfortunates, I
suppose, shall be called fools for fighting for months against misfortunes and
difficulties which have turned back others in two or three days.</p>
<p>"I hope to be able, when in Adelaide, to satisfy you that I have done all
that could be done to get across. We have succeeded, and that is one
consolation, but our lives have been saved only by the mercy and goodness of
God, Our own arm could not help us out of the shadow of death that has fallen
darkly upon us on several occasions.</p>
<p>"We are gaunt pictures of suffering, and have nothing but the few rags we
stand up in.</p>
<p>"The monsoon may delay me.</p>
<p>"I shall of course hasten to Adelaide.</p>
<p align="center">"Ever yours faithfully,</p>
<p align="right">"<small>P. EGERTON WARBURTON</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The Hon. <small>T. ELDER, M.L.C</small>, Adelaide."</p>
<p>On the 29th of December the Colonel and his son were lying down near their
bough hut, listlessly watching the boy Charley, who had climbed a tree, in
hopes of finding a little honey; suddenly the latter gave a yell, and the two
white men started up, thinking some accident had befallen the lad, but before
they could regain their feet, the cause of the black boy's emotion became
visible: from the height he had attained he had seen the little cavalcade
approaching; a few seconds more and there broke from out the scrub a string of
horses driven by the gallant Mr. Lewis, who was accompanied by another white
man from the De Grey station&mdash;the relief had arrived, their troubles were
over.</p>
<p>Five days afterwards they all moved by easy stages down the river, and on
the 11th of January they reached the hospitable dwelling of Messrs. Grant,
Harper, and Anderson, and for the first time since 1872 the wanderers slept
beneath the shelter of a roof. Owing to the kindness and solicitude of their
hosts, who supplied the worn-out men with milk, eggs, bottled ale, &amp;c.,
they were sufficiently restored to start from the station on the 21st of
January, and arrived at Roebourne, a small township on the shores of the Indian
Ocean, on the 26th.</p>
<p>Here all preparations to receive the visitors had been made by Mr. Sholl,
the Government Resident; apartments were taken for them at the hotel, at the
Government expense, and a public meeting convened, at which it was decided to
do honour to Colonel Warburton and his party, by giving them a dinner, and by
presenting an Address. Into the particulars of the banquet I need not enter,
the Address was as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center">"<small>NORTH DISTRICT, WESTERN AUSTRALIA</small>.<br>
"<i>To Colonel Warburton</i>.</p>
<p>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;We who are now present, acting not only for
ourselves, but for those belonging to our community who are prevented from
being present on this auspicious occasion, beg to offer you and your party a
sincere, warm, and hearty welcome to this the North District of Western
Australia, and to congratulate you that, after boldly planning and undertaking
the conduct of an expedition through a vast, arid, and totally unknown portion
of Central Australia, you have nobly encountered and overcome difficulties and
dangers of all kinds, which up to this time were apparently insurmountable, and
have finally risen victorious over all obstacles without having sacrificed the
life of even one human being to your heroic enterprise.</p>
<p>"This is a result for which we cannot be too thankful to an ever-watchful
and Omnipotent Providence, and it is our opinion that the indomitable pluck,
energy, and perseverance shown by yourself and party have entitled you to the
lasting gratitude of the inhabitants of your own and neighbouring colonies.</p>
<p>"That your wanderings should have terminated in this district is a matter of
congratulation to us, as we cannot but feel that the pastoral and mineral
capabilities of our adopted country only required to be viewed and reported
upon by a competent and disinterested person, for the natural result to follow
of a large influx of settlers and stock to our vast pastoral lands, and of
miners and capital to our neglected minerals.</p>
<p>"In conclusion, we beg to reiterate our hearty welcome to yourself and
party, and trusting that you will soon be re-united to your expectant families
and friends in South Australia, have the honour to subscribe ourselves,
sir,</p>
<p align="center">"Your sincere well-wishers,</p>
<p class="poem">&nbsp;&nbsp;"R. T. SHOLL.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"H. W. VENN.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"FREDK. PEARSE.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;"T. RUTHERFORD RYLEY."<br>
&amp;c., &amp;c. (Forty names in all).</p>
<p>The Colonel and his companions were unfortunate in the selection of a vessel
to carry them southwards, for the "Mary Ann", the little craft in which they
embarked, was both leaky and slow. Having been compelled to put back once, they
got fairly away on the 2 1st of February, and, after a tedious passage of five
weeks, reached Fremantle on the 25th of March. Here great preparations had been
made to do them honour, but owing to some mistake, the Colonel was landed at
the wrong jetty, at the imminent risk of a capsize on the bar, and the formal
reception intended was a failure, to the great disappointment of the
inhabitants. A little later on the Volunteers were under arms, and on the
Colonel presenting himself, the following Address was read:&mdash;</p>
<p align="center"><i>"To Colonel P. Egerton Warburton, commanding Exploring<br>
Party from South Australia.</i></p>
<p>"Sir,&mdash;We the Municipal Council and inhabitants of Fremantle offer you
and your brave comrades our warmest congratulations on the successful
completion of your long and trying journey, through what has been hitherto an
unknown country, and your safe arrival at the principal port of the colony of
Western Australia.</p>
<p>"The difficulties to be overcome in the work of Australian exploration are
acknowledged to be as formidable as are to be found in any part of our globe,
and to meet these difficulties requires a combination of intelligence, energy,
perseverance, and fortitude that few men possess; and the fact that you Lave
surmounted all obstacles, and borne up under so many privations, has awakened
in all our minds the deepest feelings of gratitude and admiration.</p>
<p>"The discoveries now to be revealed to the world by your report of the
country through which you have passed will be not only an acquisition to
scientific knowledge, but a boon to the growing population of this island
continent, destined, we believe, at some future day, to be the seat of a great,
a free, and intelligent nation.</p>
<p>"Among the names of the pioneers of civilization, yours, sir, will hold a
distinguished place; and when we remember with regret, that so many brave
men&mdash;such as Leichhardt, Burke, and Wills&mdash;have perished in similar
attempts to explore the unknown portions of Australia, we rejoice that you and
your companions in your journey are spared to receive our congratulations.</p>
<p>"We are deeply grateful to Almighty God, by Whose kind Providence your lives
have been preserved, and it is our hope, sir, that you may live for many years
in the enjoyment of health and strength, cheered by the esteem of your
fellow-men, and with the consciousness that you have accomplished a great and
noble work.</p>
<p>"Signed on behalf of the Town Council and inhabitants of Fremantle,</p>
<p align="center">"<small>W. E. MARMION</small>,</p>
<p align="right">"<i>Chairman, Town Council,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><small>"Fremantle, March, 1874."</small></p>
<br>
<p>At Perth a hearty reception awaited the Colonel, and another Address was
read:&mdash;</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><i>"To Colonel Peter Egerton Warburton, Leader of the
South<br>
Australian Exploring Expedition.</i></p>
<p>"<small>SIR</small>,&mdash;We the Council and Burgesses of the city of Perth
congratulate you on the successful termination of your enterprise. The brave
spirit which animated Captain Roe, the Gregorys, and Austin, on our side of the
continent, equally impelled Oxley, Sturt, Mitchell, Leichhardt, Stuart, and
yourself on its eastern side. The results to civilization have been vast, and,
purchased with much suffering, have placed your names in the front rank of
benefactors to mankind. Last on the list, it must be cheering to you to know
that, under Divine Providence having accomplished the difficult and hazardous
undertaking entrusted to you, you have thus prepared the way for future
explorers still further to, disclose to us the characteristics and resources of
our island continent. We feel pride in being the first representatives of an
Australian city to express to yon their thanks and admiration of the energy,
skill, and prudence you have displayed in the cause of exploration. We would
also record our gratitude to God, Who has preserved the lives of yourself and
brave companions through all the perils of the way, and thus enabled us to give
you our hearty greeting today.</p>
<p>"On behalf of the Council and Burgesses of Perth,</p>
<p align="right">"G. RANDELL,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
<i>"Chairman of Perth Municipality."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p>
<p>From Perth Colonel Warburton travelled overland to Albany, where he also met
with an enthusiastic reception. But enough has been already said to show the
spirit in which this colony received the wanderers. Too much praise can hardly
be accorded to the West Australian community for the kindness and honours they
showered down upon the explorers. The latter entered their boundaries worn-out,
feeble, dying, and the colonists lodged them, fed them, and transported them
from place to place, free of all charge, and were only too happy whenever an
opportunity of helping the new arrivals in some form or another presented
itself. It must be remembered that Western Australia had her own explorers in
the field, but no littleness or jealousy of the achievements wrought by a party
initiated in another colony was shown; a hearty welcome everywhere met the
wanderers, combined with the utmost liberality on the part of all, from the
distant Oakover in the North, to the port of Albany, where the explorers
quitted Western Australian soil.</p>
<p>It is almost needless to say with what enthusiasm South Australia welcomed
home her wandering sons. A great banquet, at which the Governor presided, and
220 people sat down, was given to the explorers. The Legislative Assembly voted
the sum of 1000<i>l</i>. to the leader, and 500<i>l</i>. to be divided amongst
the other members of his party; but the greatest honour conferred upon Colonel
Egerton Warburton was the award of the gold medal of the Royal Geographical
Society for the year 1874, which was made in May, soon after the first
intelligence of his achievement had been received. He revisited his native
country in November last, after an absence of more than forty years, finding
his aged mother, whom he had not seen during that period, still alive to greet
him. The climate of England he found insupportable, after so long a residence
in Australia, and he returned to Adelaide after a brief stay of five or six
weeks. It will, no doubt, have been to him a source of much gratification to
learn that Her Majesty the Queen, by the advice of the Secretary of State for
the Colonies, has shown her appreciation of the importance of his work, by
making him since his departure Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St.
George.</p>
