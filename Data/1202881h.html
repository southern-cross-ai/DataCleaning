  <h2>I. INTRODUCING MR. PETER RUFF</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Oct 1909</h3>

  <p class="first">There was nothing about the supper party on that particular
  Sunday evening in November at Daisy Villa, Green Street, Streatham, which
  seemed to indicate in any way that one of the most interesting careers
  connected with the world history of crime was to owe its very existence to
  the disaster which befell that little gathering. The villa was the residence
  and also&mdash;to his credit&mdash;the unmortgaged property of Mr. David
  Barnes, a struggling but fairly prosperous coal merchant of excellent
  character, some means, and Methodist proclivities. His habit of sitting
  without his coat when carving, although deprecated by his wife and daughter
  on account of the genteel aspirations of the latter, was a not unusual one in
  the neighbourhood; and coupled with the proximity of a cold joint of beef,
  his seat at the head of the table, and a carving knife and fork grasped in
  his hands, established clearly the fact of his position in the household,
  which a somewhat weak physiognomy might otherwise have led the casual
  observer to doubt. Opposite him, at the other end of the table, sat his wife,
  Mrs. Barnes, a somewhat voluminous lady with a high colour, a black satin
  frock, and many ornaments. On her left the son of the house, eighteen years
  old, of moderate stature, somewhat pimply, with the fashion of the moment
  reflected in his pink tie with white spots, drawn through a gold ring, and
  curving outwards to seek obscurity underneath a dazzling waistcoat. A white
  tube-rose in his buttonhole might have been intended as a sort of compliment
  to the occasion, or an indication of his intention to take a walk after
  supper in the fashionable purlieus of the neighbourhood. Facing him sat his
  sister&mdash;a fluffy-haired, blue-eyed young lady, pretty in her way, but
  chiefly noticeable for a peculiar sort of self-consciousness blended with
  self-satisfaction, and possessed only at a certain period in their lives by
  young ladies of her age. It was almost the air of the cat in whose interior
  reposes the missing canary, except that in this instance the canary obviously
  existed in the person of the young man who sat at her side, introduced
  formally to the household for the first time. That young man's name
  was&mdash;at the moment&mdash;Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald.</p>

  <p>It seems idle to attempt any description of a person who, in the past, had
  secured a certain amount of fame under a varying personality; and who, in the
  future, was to become more than ever notorious under a far less aristocratic
  pseudonym than that by which he was at present known to the inhabitants of
  Daisy Villa. There are photographs of him in New York and Paris, St.
  Petersburg and Chicago, Vienna and Cape Town, but there are no two pictures
  which present to the casual observer the slightest likeness to one another.
  To allude to him by the name under which he had won some part, at least, of
  the affections of Miss Maud Barnes, Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, as he sat there,
  a suitor on probation for her hand, was a young man of modest and genteel
  appearance. He wore a blue serge suit&mdash;a little underdressed for the
  occasion, perhaps; but his tie and collar were neat; his gold-rimmed
  spectacles&mdash;if a little disapproved of by Maud on account of the air of
  steadiness which they imparted&mdash;suggested excellent son-in-lawlike
  qualities to Mr. and Mrs. Barnes. He had the promise of a fair moustache, but
  his complexion generally was colourless. His features, except for a certain
  regularity, were undistinguished. His speech was modest and correct. His
  manner varied with his company. To-night it had been pronounced, by excellent
  judges&mdash;genteel.</p>

  <p>The conversation consisted&mdash;naturally enough, under the
  circumstances&mdash;of a course of subtle and judicious pumping, tactfully
  prompted, for the most part, by Mrs. Barnes. Such, for instance, as the
  following:</p>

  <p>"Talking about Marie Corelli's new book reminds me, Mr.
  Fitzgerald&mdash;your occupation is connected with books, is it not?" his
  prospective mother-in-law enquired, artlessly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fitzgerald bowed assent.</p>

  <p>"I am cashier at Howell &amp; Wilson's in Cheapside," he said. "We sell a
  great many books there&mdash;as many, I should think, as any retail
  establishment in London."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Mrs. Barnes purred. "Very interesting work, I am sure. So nice
  and intellectual, too; for, of course, you must be looking inside them
  sometimes."</p>

  <p>"I know the place well," Mr. Adolphus Barnes, Junior, announced
  condescendingly,&mdash;"pass it every day on my way to lunch."</p>

  <p>"So much nicer," Mrs. Barnes continued, "than any of the ordinary
  businesses&mdash;grocery or drapery, or anything of that sort."</p>

  <p>Miss Maud elevated her eyebrows slightly. Was it likely that she would
  have looked with eyes of favour upon a young man engaged in any of these
  inferior occupations?</p>

  <p>"There's money in books, too," Mr. Barnes declared with sudden
  inspiration. His prospective son-in-law turned towards him deferentially.</p>

  <p>"You are right, sir," he admitted. "There is money in them. There's money
  for those who write, and there's money for those who sell. My occupation," he
  continued, with a modest little cough, "brings me often into touch with
  publishers, travellers and clerks, so I am, as it were, behind the scenes to
  some extent. I can assure you," he continued, looking from Mr. Barnes to his
  wife, and finally transfixing Mr. Adolphus&mdash;"I can assure you that the
  money paid by some firms of publishers to a few well-known authors&mdash;I
  will mention no names&mdash;as advances against royalties, is something
  stupendous!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Mr. Barnes murmured, solemnly shaking his head.</p>

  <p>"Marie Corelli, I expect, and that Hall Caine," remarked young
  Adolphus.</p>

  <p>"Seems easy enough to write a book, too," Mrs. Barnes said. "Why, I
  declare that some of those we get from the library&mdash;we subscribe to a
  library, Mr. Fitzgerald&mdash;are just as simple and straightforward that a
  child might have written them. No plot whatsoever, no murders or mysteries or
  anything of that sort&mdash;just stories about people like ourselves. I don't
  see how they can pay people for writing stories about people just like those
  one meets every day!"</p>

  <p>"I always say," Maud intervened, "that Spencer means to write a book some
  day. He has quite the literary air, hasn't he, mother?"</p>

  <p>"Indeed he has!" Mrs. Barnes declared, with an appreciative glance at the
  gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>Mr. Fitzgerald modestly disclaimed any literary aspirations.</p>

  <p>"The thing is a gift, after all," he declared, generously. "I can keep
  accounts, and earn a fair salary at it, but if I attempted fiction I should
  soon be up a tree."</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnes nodded his approval of such sentiments.</p>

  <p>"Every one to his trade, I say," he remarked. "What sort of salaries do
  they pay now in the book trade?" he asked guilelessly.</p>

  <p>"Very fair," Mr. Fitzgerald admitted candidly,&mdash;"very fair
  indeed."</p>

  <p>"When I was your age," Mr. Barnes said reflectively, "I was
  getting&mdash;let me see&mdash;forty-two shillings a week. Pretty good pay,
  too, for those days."</p>

  <p>Mr. Fitzgerald admitted the fact.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said apologetically, "salaries are a little higher now all
  round. Mr. Howell has been very kind to me,&mdash;in fact I have had two
  raises this year. I am getting four pounds ten now."</p>

  <p>"Four pounds ten per week?" Mrs. Barnes exclaimed, laying down her knife
  and fork.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Mr. Fitzgerald answered. "After Christmas, I have some reason
  to believe that it may be five pounds."</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnes whistled softly, and looked at the young man with a new
  respect.</p>

  <p>"I told you that&mdash;Mr.&mdash;that Spencer was doing pretty well,
  Mother," Maud simpered, looking down at her plate.</p>

  <p>"Any one to support?" her father asked, transferring a pickle from the
  fork to his mouth.</p>

  <p>"No one," Mr. Fitzgerald answered. "In fact, I may say that I have some
  small expectations. I haven't done badly, either, out of the few investments
  I have made from time to time."</p>

  <p>"Saved a bit of money, eh?" Mr. Barnes enquired genially.</p>

  <p>"I have a matter of four hundred pounds put by," Mr. Fitzgerald admitted
  modestly, "besides a few sticks of furniture. I never cared much about
  lodging-house things, so I furnished a couple of rooms myself some time
  ago."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Barnes rose slowly to her feet.</p>

  <p>"You are quite sure you won't have a small piece more of beef?" she
  enquired anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Just a morsel?" Mr. Barnes asked, tapping the joint insinuatingly with
  his carving knife.</p>

  <p>"No, I thank you!" Mr. Fitzgerald declared firmly. "I have done
  excellently."</p>

  <p>"Then if you will put the joint on the sideboard, Adolphus," Mrs. Barnes
  directed, "Maud and I will change the plates. We always let the girl go out
  on Sundays, Mr. Fitzgerald," she explained, turning to their guest. "It's
  very awkward, of course, but they seem to expect it."</p>

  <p>"Quite natural, I'm sure," Mr. Fitzgerald murmured, watching Maud's light
  movements with admiring eyes. "I like to see ladies interested in domestic
  work."</p>

  <p>"There's one thing I will say for Maud," her proud mother declared,
  plumping down a dish of jelly upon the table, "she does know what's what in
  keeping house, and even if she hasn't to scrape and save as I did when David
  and I were first married, economy is a great thing when you're young. I have
  always said so, and I stick to it."</p>

  <p>"Quite right, Mother," Mr. Barnes declared.</p>

  <p>"If instead of sitting there," Mrs. Barnes continued in high good humour,
  "you were to get a bottle of that port wine out of the cellarette, we might
  drink Mr. Fitzgerald's health, being as it's his first visit."</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnes rose to his feet with alacrity. "For a woman with sound ideas,"
  he declared, "commend me to your mother!"</p>

  <p>Maud, having finished her duties, resumed her place by the side of the
  guest of the evening. Their hands met under the tablecloth for a moment. To
  the girl, the pleasure of such a proceeding was natural enough, but
  Fitzgerald asked himself for the fiftieth time why on earth he, who,
  notwithstanding his present modest exterior, was a young man of some
  experience, should from such primitive love-making derive a rapture which
  nothing else in life afforded him. He was, at that moment, content with his
  future,&mdash;a future which he had absolutely and finally decided upon. He
  was content with his father-in-law and his mother-in-law, with Daisy Villa,
  and the prospect of a Daisy Villa for himself,&mdash;content, even, with
  Adolphus! But for Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, these things were not to be! The
  awakening was even then at hand.</p>

  <p>The dining room of Daisy Villa fronted the street, and was removed from it
  only a few feet. Consequently, the footsteps of passers-by upon the flagged
  pavement were clearly distinguishable. It was just at the moment when Mrs.
  Barnes was inserting a few fresh almonds into a somewhat precarious tipsy
  cake, and Mr. Barnes was engaged with the decanting of the port, that two
  pairs of footsteps, considerably heavier than those of the ordinary
  promenader, paused outside and finally stopped. The gate creaked. Mr. Barnes
  looked up.</p>

  <p>"Hullo!" he exclaimed. "What's that? Visitors?"</p>

  <p>They all listened. The front-door bell rang. Adolphus, in response to a
  gesture from his mother, rose sulkily to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Job I hate!" he muttered as he left the room.</p>

  <p>The rest of the family, full of the small curiosity of people of their
  class, were intent upon listening for voices outside. The demeanour of Mr.
  Spencer Fitzgerald, therefore, escaped their notice. It is doubtful, in any
  case, whether their perceptions would have been sufficiently keen to have
  enabled them to trace the workings of emotion in the countenance of a person
  so magnificently endowed by Providence with the art of subterfuge. Mr.
  Spencer Fitzgerald seemed simply to have stiffened in acute and earnest
  attention. It was only for a moment that he hesitated. His unfailing
  inspiration told him the truth!</p>

  <p>His course of action was simple,&mdash;he rose to his feet and strolled to
  the window.</p>

  <p>"Some people who have lost their way in the fog, perhaps," he remarked.
  "What a night!"</p>

  <p>He laid his hand upon the sash&mdash;simultaneously there was a rush of
  cold air into the room, a half-angry, half-frightened exclamation from
  Adolphus in the passage, a scream from Miss Maud&mdash;and no Mr. Spencer
  Fitzgerald! No one had time to be more than blankly astonished. The door was
  opened, and a police inspector, in very nice dark braided uniform and a
  peaked cap, stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>Mr. Barnes dropped the port, and Mrs. Barnes, emulating her daughter's
  example, screamed. The inspector, as though conscious of the draught, moved
  rapidly toward the window.</p>

  <p>"You had a visitor here, Mr. Barnes," he said quickly&mdash;"a Mr. Spencer
  Fitzgerald. Where is he?"</p>

  <p>There was no one who could answer! Mr. Barnes was speechless between the
  shock of the spilt port and the appearance of a couple of uniformed policemen
  in his dining room. John Dory, the detective, he knew well enough in his
  private capacity, but in his uniform, and attended by policemen, he presented
  a new and startling appearance! Mrs. Barnes was in hysterics, and Maud was
  gazing like a creature turned to stone at the open window, through which
  little puffs of fog were already drifting into the room. Adolphus, with an
  air of bewilderment, was standing with his mouth and eyes wider open than
  they had ever been in his life. And as for the honoured guest of these
  admirable inhabitants of Daisy Villa, there was not the slightest doubt but
  that Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald had disappeared through the window!</p>

  <p>Fitzgerald's expedition was nearly at an end. Soon he paused, crossed the
  road to a block of flats, ascended to the eighth floor by an automatic lift,
  and rang the bell at a door which bore simply the number II. A trim
  parlourmaid opened it after a few minutes' delay.</p>

  <p>"Is Miss Emerson at home?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Miss Emerson is in," the maid admitted, with some hesitation, "but I am
  not sure that she will see any one to-night."</p>

  <p>"I have a message for her," Fitzgerald said.</p>

  <p>"Will you give me your name, sir, please?" the maid asked.</p>

  <p>An inner door was suddenly opened. A slim girl, looking taller than she
  really was by reason of the rug upon which she stood, looked out into the
  hall&mdash;a girl with masses of brown hair loosely coiled on her head, with
  pale face and strange eyes. She opened her lips as though to call to her
  visitor by name, and as suddenly closed them again. There was not much
  expression in her face, but there was enough to show that his visit was not
  unwelcome.</p>

  <p>"You!" she exclaimed. "Come in! Please come in at once!"</p>

  <p>Fitzgerald obeyed the invitation of the girl whom he had come to visit.
  She had retreated a little into the room, but the door was no sooner closed
  than she held out her hands.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"Peter!" she exclaimed. "Peter, you have come to me at last!"</p>

  <p>Her lips were a little parted; her eyes were bright with pleasure; her
  whole expression was one of absolute delight. Fitzgerald frowned, as though
  he found her welcome a little too enthusiastic for his taste.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "please don't look at me as though I were a prodigal
  sheep. If you do, I shall be sorry that I came."</p>

  <p>Her hands fell to her side, the pleasure died out of her face&mdash;only
  her eyes still questioned him. Fitzgerald carefully laid his hat on a vacant
  chair.</p>

  <p>"Something has happened?" she said. "Tell me that all that madness is
  over&mdash;that you are yourself again!"</p>

  <p>"So far as regards my engagement with Messrs. Howell &amp; Wilson," he
  said, despondently, "you are right. As regards&mdash;Miss Barnes, there has
  been no direct misunderstanding between us, but I am afraid, for the present,
  that I must consider that&mdash;well, in abeyance."</p>

  <p>"That is something!" she exclaimed, drawing a little breath of relief.
  "Sit down, Peter. Will you have something to eat? I finished dinner an hour
  ago, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Fitzgerald interrupted, "I supped&mdash;extremely well in
  Streatham!"</p>

  <p>"In Streatham!" she repeated. "Why, how did you get there? The fog is
  awful."</p>

  <p>"Fogs do not trouble me," Fitzgerald answered. "I walked. I could have
  done it as well blindfold. I will take a whisky and soda, if I may."</p>

  <p>She led him to an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"I will mix it myself," she said.</p>

  <p>Without being remarkably good-looking, she was certainly a pleasant and
  attractive-looking young woman. Her cheeks were a little pale; her
  hair&mdash;perfectly natural&mdash;was a wonderful deep shade of soft brown.
  Her eyes were long and narrow&mdash;almost Oriental in shape&mdash;and they
  seemed in some queer way to match the room; he could have sworn that in the
  firelight they flashed green. Her body and limbs, notwithstanding her extreme
  slightness, were graceful, perhaps, but with the grace of the tigress. She
  wore a green silk dressing jacket, pulled together with a belt of lizard
  skin, and her neck was bare. Her skirt was of some thin black material. She
  was obviously in deshabille, and yet there was something neat and trim about
  the smaller details of her toilette.</p>

  <p>"Go on, please, Peter," she begged. "You are keeping me in suspense."</p>

  <p>"There isn't much to tell," he answered. "It's over&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>She drew a sharp breath through her teeth.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to marry that girl&mdash;that bourgeois doll in
  Streatham?"</p>

  <p>Fitzgerald sat up in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, seriously, "don't you call her names. If I'm not
  going to marry her, it isn't my fault. She is the only girl I have ever
  wanted, and probably&mdash;most probably&mdash;she will be the only one I
  ever shall want. That's honest, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>The girl winced.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she said, "it is honest!"</p>

  <p>"I should have married her," the young man continued, "and I should have
  been happy. I had my eye on a villa&mdash;not too near her parents&mdash;and
  I saw my way to a little increase of salary. I should have taken to
  gardening, to walks in the Park, with an occasional theatre, and I should
  have thoroughly enjoyed a fortnight every summer at Skegness or
  Sutton-on-Sea. We should have saved a little money. I should have gone to
  church regularly, and if possible I should have filled some minor public
  offices. You may call this bourgeois&mdash;it was my idea of happiness."</p>

  <p>"Was!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Is still," he declared, sharply, "but I shall never attain to it.
  To-night I had to leave Maud&mdash;to leave the supper table of Daisy
  Villa&mdash;through the window!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"The police," he explained. "That brute Dory was at the bottom of it."</p>

  <p>"But surely," she murmured, "you told me that you had a bona-fide
  situation&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"So I had," he declared, "and I was a fool not to be content with it. It
  was my habit of taking long country walks, and their rotten auditing, which
  undid me! You understand that this was all before I met Maud? Since the day I
  spoke to her, I turned over a new leaf. I have left the night work alone, and
  I repaid every penny of the firm's money which they could ever have possibly
  found out about. There was only that one little affair of mine down at
  Sudbury."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what you are going to do?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I have no alternative," he answered. "The law has kicked me out from the
  respectable places. The law shall pay!"</p>

  <p>She looked at him with glowing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Have you any plans?" she asked, softly.</p>

  <p>"I have," he answered. "I have considered the subject from a good many
  points of view, and I have decided to start in business for myself as a
  private detective."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"My dear Peter!" she murmured. "Couldn't you be a little more
  original?"</p>

  <p>"That is only what I am going to call myself," he answered. "I may tell
  you that I am going to strike out on somewhat new lines."</p>

  <p>"Please explain," she begged.</p>

  <p>He recrossed his knees and made himself a little more comfortable.</p>

  <p>"The weak part of every great robbery, however successful," he began, "is
  the great wastage in value which invariably results. For jewels which
  cost&mdash;say five thousand pounds, and to procure which the artist has to
  risk his life as well as his liberty, he has to consider himself lucky if he
  clears eight hundred. For the Hermitage rubies, for instance, where I nearly
  had to shoot a man dead, I realized rather less than four hundred pounds. It
  doesn't pay."</p>

  <p>"Go on," she begged.</p>

  <p>"I am not clear," he continued, "how far this class of business will
  attract me at all, but I do not propose, in any case, to enter into any
  transactions on my own account. I shall work for other people, and for cash
  down. Your experience of life, Violet, has been fairly large. Have you not
  sometimes come into contact with people driven into a situation from which
  they would willingly commit any crime to escape if they dared? It is not with
  them a question of money at all&mdash;it is simply a matter of ignorance.
  They do not know how to commit a crime. They have had no experience, and if
  they attempt it, they know perfectly well that they are likely to blunder. A
  person thoroughly experienced in the ways of criminals&mdash;a person of
  genius like myself&mdash;would have, without a doubt, an immense clientele,
  if only he dared put up his signboard. Literally, I cannot do that. Actually,
  I mean to do so! I shall be willing to accept contracts either to help
  nervous people out of an undesirable crisis; or, on the other hand, to
  measure my wits against the wits of Scotland Yard, and to discover the
  criminals whom they have failed to secure. I shall make my own bargains, and
  I shall be paid in cash. I shall take on nothing that I am not certain
  about."</p>

  <p>"But your clients?" she asked, curiously. "How will you come into contact
  with them?"</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I am not afraid of business being slack," he said. "The world is full of
  fools."</p>

  <p>"You cannot live outside the law, Peter," she objected. "You are clever, I
  know, but they are not all fools at Scotland Yard."</p>

  <p>"You forget," he reminded her, "that there will be a perfectly legitimate
  side to my profession. The other sort of case I shall only accept if I can
  see my way clear to make a success of it. Needless to say, I shall have to
  refuse the majority that are offered to me."</p>

  <p>She came a little nearer to him.</p>

  <p>"In any case," she said, with a little sigh, "you have given up that
  foolish, bourgeois life of yours?"</p>

  <p>He looked down into her face, and his eyes were cold.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "this is no time for misunderstandings. I should like
  you to know that apart from one young lady, who possesses my whole
  affection&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"All of it?" she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"All!" he declared emphatically. "She will doubtless be faithless to
  me&mdash;under the circumstances, I cannot blame her&mdash;but so far as I am
  concerned, I have no affection whatever for any one else."</p>

  <p>She crept back to her place.</p>

  <p>"I could be so useful to you," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"You could and you shall, if you will be sensible," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Tell me how?" she begged.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Are you acting now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am understudying Molly," she answered, "and I have a very small part at
  the Globe."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"There is no reason to interfere with that," he said, "in fact, I wish you
  to continue your connection with the profession. It brings you into touch
  with the class of people among whom I am likely to find clients."</p>

  <p>"Go on, please," she begged.</p>

  <p>"On two conditions&mdash;or rather one," he said, "you can, if you like,
  become my secretary and partner&mdash;and find the money we shall require to
  make a start."</p>

  <p>"Conditions?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You must understand, once and for all," he said, "that I will not be made
  love to, and that I can treat you only as a working; companion. My name will
  be Peter Ruff, and yours Miss Brown. You will have to dress like a secretary,
  and behave like one. Sometimes there will be plenty of work for you, and
  sometimes there will be none at all. Sometimes you will be bored to death,
  and sometimes there will be excitement. I do not wish to make you vain, but I
  may add, especially as you are aware of my personal feelings toward you, that
  you are the only person in the world to whom I would make this offer."</p>

  <p>She sighed gently.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Peter," she asked, "when do you mean to start this new
  enterprise?"</p>

  <p>"Not for six months&mdash;perhaps a year," he answered. "I must go to
  Paris&mdash;perhaps Vienna. I might even have to go to New York. There are
  certain associations with which I must come into touch&mdash;certain
  information I must become possessed of."</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "I like your scheme, but there is just one thing. Such
  men as you should be the brains of great enterprises. Don't you understand
  what I mean? It shouldn't be you who does the actual thing which brings you
  within the power of the law. I am not over-scrupulous, you know. I hate
  wrongdoing, but I have never been able to treat as equal criminals the poor
  man who steals for a living, and the rich financier who robs right and left
  out of sheer greed. I agree with you that crime is not an absolute thing. The
  circumstances connected with every action in life determine its morality or
  immorality. But, Peter, it isn't worth while to go outside the law!"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"You are a sensible girl," he said, "I have always thought that. We'll
  talk over my cases together, if they seem to run a little too close to the
  line."</p>

  <p>"Very well, Peter," she said, "I accept."</p>

  <h2>II. A NEW CAREER</h2>

  <h3>No record of magazine publication</h3>

  <p class="first">About twelve months after the interrupted festivities at
  Daisy Villa, that particular neighbourhood was again the scene of some
  rejoicing. Standing before the residence of Mr. Barnes were three carriages,
  drawn in each case by a pair of grey horses. The coachmen and their steeds
  were similarly adorned with white rosettes. It would have been an insult to
  the intelligence of the most youthful of the loungers-by to have informed
  them that a wedding was projected.</p>

  <p>At the neighbouring church all was ready. The clerk stood at the door, the
  red drugget was down, the usual little crowd were standing all agog upon the
  pavement. There was one unusual feature of the proceedings: Instead of a
  solitary policeman, there were at least a dozen who kept clear the entrance
  to the church. Their presence greatly puzzled a little old gentleman who had
  joined the throng of sightseers. He pushed himself to the front and touched
  one of them upon the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Policeman," he said, "will you tell me why there are so many of you
  to keep such a small crowd in order?"</p>

  <p>"Bridegroom's a member of the force, sir, for one reason," the man
  answered good-humouredly.</p>

  <p>"And the other?" the old gentleman persisted.</p>

  <p>The policeman behaved as though he had not heard&mdash;a proceeding which
  his natural stolidity rendered easy. The little old gentleman, however, was
  not so easily put off. He tapped the man once more upon the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"And the other reason, Mr. Policeman?" he asked insinuatingly.</p>

  <p>"Not allowed to talk about that, sir," was the somewhat gruff reply.</p>

  <p>The little old gentleman moved away, a trifle hurt. He was a very nicely
  dressed old gentleman indeed, and everything about him seemed to savour of
  prosperity. But he was certainly garrulous. An obviously invited guest was
  standing upon the edge of the pavement stroking a pair of lavender kid
  gloves. The little old gentleman sidled up to him.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said, raising his hat. "I am just back from
  Australia&mdash;haven't seen a wedding in England for fifty years. Do you
  think that they would let me into the church?"</p>

  <p>The invited guest looked down at his questioner and approved of him.
  Furthermore, he seemed exceedingly glad to be interrupted in his somewhat
  nervous task of waiting for the wedding party.</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," he replied cheerfully. "Come along in with me, and I'll
  find you a seat."</p>

  <p>Down the scarlet drugget they went&mdash;the big best man with the red
  hands and the lavender kid gloves and the opulent-looking old gentleman with
  the gold-rimmed spectacles and the handsome walking stick.</p>

  <p>"Dear me, this is very interesting!" the latter remarked. "Is it the
  custom, sir, always, may I ask, in this country, to have so many policemen at
  a wedding?"</p>

  <p>The big man looked downward and shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Special reason," he said mysteriously. "Fact is, young lady was engaged
  once to a very bad character&mdash;a burglar whom the police have been
  wanting for years. He had to leave the country, but he has written her once
  or twice since in a mysterious sort of way&mdash;wanted her to be true to
  him, and all that sort of thing. Dory&mdash;that's the bridegroom&mdash;has
  got a sort of an idea that he may turn up to-day."</p>

  <p>"This is very exciting&mdash;very!" the little old gentleman remarked.
  "Reminds me of our younger days out in Australia."</p>

  <p>"You sit down here," the best man directed, ushering his companion into an
  empty pew. "I must get back again outside, or I shall have the bridegroom
  arriving."</p>

  <p>"Good-day to you, sir, and many thanks!" the little old gentleman said
  politely.</p>

  <p>Soon the bridegroom arrived&mdash;a smart young officer, well thought of
  at Scotland Yard, well set up, wearing a long tail coat a lilac and white
  tie, and shaking in every limb. He walked up the aisle accompanied by the
  best man, and the little old gentleman from Australia watched him genially
  from behind those gold-rimmed glasses. And, then, scarcely was he at the
  altar rails when through the open church door one heard the sounds of horses'
  feet, one heard a rustle, the murmur of voices, caught a glimpse of a waiting
  group arranging themselves finally in the porch of the church. Maud, on the
  arm of her father, came slowly up the aisle. The little old gentleman turned
  his head as though this was something upon which he feared to look. He saw
  nothing of Mr. Barnes, in a new coat, with tuberose and spray of maidenhair
  in his coat, and exceedingly tight patent leather boots on his feet; he saw
  nothing of Mrs. Barnes, clad in a gown of the lightest magenta, with a bonnet
  smothered with violets.</p>

  <p>It was in the vestry that the only untoward incident of that highly
  successful wedding took place. The ceremony was over! Bride, bridegroom and
  parents trooped in. And when the register was opened, one witness had already
  signed! In the clear, precise writing his name stood out upon the virgin
  page&mdash;</p>

  <p>Spencer Fitzgerald</p>

  <p>The bridegroom swore, the bride nearly collapsed. The clerk pressed into
  the hands of the latter an envelope.</p>

  <p>"From the little old gentleman," he announced, "who was fussing round the
  church this morning."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Dory tore it open and gave a cry of delight. A diamond cross, worth
  all the rest of her presents put together, flashed soft lights from a
  background of dull velvet. Her husband had looked over her shoulder, and with
  a scowl seized the morocco case and threw it far from him.</p>

  <p>It was the only disturbing incident of a highly successful function!</p>

  <p>At precisely the same moment when the wedding guests were seated around
  the hospitable board of Daisy Villa, a celebration of a somewhat different
  nature was taking place in the more aristocratic neighbourhood of Curzon
  Street. Here, however, the little party was a much smaller one, and the
  innocent gaiety of the gathering at Daisy Villa was entirely lacking. The
  luncheon table around which the four men were seated presented all the
  unlovely signs of a meal where self-restraint had been abandoned&mdash;where
  conviviality has passed the bounds of licence. Edibles were represented only
  by a single dish of fruit; the tablecloth, stained with wine and cigar ash,
  seemed crowded with every sort of bottle and every sort of glass. A magnum of
  champagne, empty, another half full, stood in the middle of the table;
  whisky, brandy, liqueurs of various sorts were all represented;
  glasses&mdash;some full, some empty, some filled with cigar ash and cigarette
  stumps&mdash;an ugly sight!</p>

  <p>The guest in chief arose. Short, thick-set, red-faced, with bulbous eyes,
  and veins about his temples which just now were unpleasantly prominent, he
  seemed, indeed, a very fitting person to have been the recipient of such
  hospitality. He stood clutching a little at the tablecloth and swaying upon
  his feet. He spoke as a drunken man, but such words as he pronounced clearly
  showed him to be possessed of a voice naturally thick and raspy. It was
  obvious that he was a person of entirely different class from his three
  companions.</p>

  <p>"G&mdash;gentlemen," he said, "I must be off. I thank you very much for
  this&mdash;hospitality. Honoured, I'm sure, to have sat down in
  such&mdash;such company. Good afternoon, all!"</p>

  <p>He lurched a little toward the door, but his neighbour at the
  table&mdash;who was also his host&mdash;caught hold of his coat tail and
  pulled him back into his chair.</p>

  <p>"No hurry, Masters," he said. "One more liqueur, eh? It's a raw
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"N&mdash;not another drop, Sir Richard!" the man declared. "Not another
  drop to drink. I am very much obliged to you all, but I must be off. Must be
  off," he repeated, making another effort to rise.</p>

  <p>His host held him by the arm. The man resented it&mdash;he showed signs of
  anger.</p>

  <p>"D&mdash;n it all! I&mdash;I'm not a prisoner, am I?" he exclaimed
  angrily. "Tell you I've got&mdash;appointment&mdash;club. Can't you see it's
  past five o'clock?"</p>

  <p>"That's all right, Masters," the man whom he had addressed as Sir Richard
  declared soothingly. "We want just a word with you on business first, before
  you go&mdash;Colonel Dickinson, Lord Merries and myself."</p>

  <p>Masters shook his head.</p>

  <p>"See you to-morrow," he declared. "No time to talk business now. Let me
  go!"</p>

  <p>He made another attempt to rise, which his host also prevented.</p>

  <p>"Masters, don't be a fool!" the latter said firmly. "You've got to hear
  what we want to say to you. Sit down and listen."</p>

  <p>Masters relapsed sullenly into his chair. His little eyes seemed to creep
  closer to one another. So they wanted to talk business! Perhaps it was for
  that reason that they had bidden him sit at their table&mdash;had entertained
  him so well! The very thought cleared his brain.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said shortly.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard lit a cigarette and leaned further back in his chair. He was a
  man apparently about fifty years of age&mdash;tall, well dressed, with good
  features, save for his mouth, which resembled more than anything a rat trap.
  He was perfectly bald, and he had the air of a man who was a careful liver.
  His eyes were bright, almost beadlike; his fingers long and a trifle
  over-manicured. One would have judged him to be what he was&mdash;a man of
  fashion and a patron of the turf.</p>

  <p>"Masters," he said, "we are all old friends here. We want to speak to you
  plainly. We three have had a try, as you know&mdash;Merries, Dickinson and
  myself&mdash;to make the coup of our lives. We failed, and we're up against
  it hard."</p>

  <p>"Very hard, indeed," Lord Merries murmured softly.</p>

  <p>"Deuced hard!" Colonel Dickinson echoed.</p>

  <p>Masters was sitting tight, breathing a little hard, looking fixedly at his
  host.</p>

  <p>"Take my own case first," the latter continued. "I am Sir Richard Dyson,
  ninth baronet, with estates in Wiltshire and Scotland, and a town house in
  Cleveland Place. I belong to the proper clubs for a man in my position, and,
  somehow or other&mdash;we won't say how&mdash;I have managed to pay my way.
  There isn't an acre of my property that isn't mortgaged for more than its
  value. My town house&mdash;well, it doesn't belong to me at all! I have
  twenty-six thousand pounds to pay you on Monday. To save my life, I could not
  raise twenty-six thousand farthings! So much for me."</p>

  <p>The man Masters ground his teeth.</p>

  <p>"So much for you!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Take the case next," Sir Richard continued, "of my friend Merries here.
  Merries is an Earl, it is true, but he never had a penny to bless himself
  with. He's tried acting, reporting, marrying&mdash;anything to make an honest
  living. So far, I am afraid we must consider Lord Merries as something of a
  failure, eh?"</p>

  <p>"A rotten failure, I should say," that young nobleman declared
  gloomily.</p>

  <p>"Lord Merries is, to put it briefly, financially unsound," Sir Richard
  declared.</p>

  <p>"What is the amount of your debt to Mr. Masters, Jim?"</p>

  <p>"Eleven thousand two hundred pounds," Lord Merries answered.</p>

  <p>"And we may take it, I presume, for granted that you have not that sum,
  nor anything like it, at your disposal?" Sir Richard asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a fiver!" Lord Merries declared with emphasis.</p>

  <p>"We come now, Mr. Masters, to our friend Colonel Dickinson," Sir Richard
  continued. "Colonel Dickinson is, perhaps, in a more favourable situation
  than any of us. He has a small but regular income, and he has expectations
  which it is not possible to mortgage fully. At the same time, it will be many
  years before they can&mdash;er&mdash;fructify. He is, therefore, with us in
  this somewhat unpleasant predicament in which we find ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Cut it short," Masters growled. "I'm sick of so much talk. What's it all
  mean?"</p>

  <p>"It means simply this, Mr. Masters," Sir Richard said, "we want you to
  take six months' bills for our indebtedness to you."</p>

  <p>Masters rose to his feet. His thick lips were drawn a little apart. He had
  the appearance of a savage and discontented animal.</p>

  <p>"So that's why I've been asked here and fed up with wine and stuff, eh?"
  he exclaimed thickly. "Well, my answer to you is soon given. NO! I'll take
  bills from no man! My terms are cash on settling day&mdash;cash to pay or
  cash to receive. I'll have no other!"</p>

  <p>Sir Richard rose also to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Masters, I beg of you to be reasonable," he said. "You will do
  yourself no good by adopting this attitude. Facts are facts. We haven't got a
  thousand pounds between us."</p>

  <p>"I've heard that sort of a tale before," Masters answered, with a sneer.
  "Job Masters is too old a bird to be caught by such chaff. I'll take my
  risks, gentlemen. I'll take my risks."</p>

  <p>He moved toward the door. No one spoke a word. The silence as he crossed
  the room seemed a little ominous. He looked over his shoulder. They were all
  three standing in their places, looking at him. A vague sense of uneasiness
  disturbed his equanimity.</p>

  <p>"No offence, gents," he said, "and good afternoon!"</p>

  <p>Still no reply. He reached the door and turned the handle. The door was
  fast. He shook it&mdash;gently at first, and then violently. Suddenly he
  realized that it was locked. He turned sharply around.</p>

  <p>"What game's this?" he exclaimed, fiercely. "Let me out!"</p>

  <p>They stood in their places without movement. There was something a little
  ominous in their silence. Masters was fast becoming a sober man.</p>

  <p>"Let me out of here," he exclaimed, "or I'll break the door down!"</p>

  <p>Sir Richard Dyson came slowly towards him. There was something in his
  appearance which terrified Masters. He raised his fist to strike the door. He
  was a fighting man, but he felt a sudden sense of impotence.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Masters," Sir Richard said suavely, "the truth is that we cannot
  afford to let you go&mdash;unless you agree to do what we have asked. You see
  we really have not the money or any way of raising it&mdash;and the
  inconvenience of being posted you have yourself very ably pointed out. Change
  your mind, Mr. Masters. Take those bills. We'll do our best to meet
  them."</p>

  <p>"I'll do nothing of the sort," Masters answered, striking the door
  fiercely with his clenched fist. "I'll have cash&mdash;nothing but the
  cash!"</p>

  <p>There was a dull, sickening thud, and the bookmaker went over like a shot
  rabbit. His legs twitched for a moment&mdash;a little moan that was scarcely
  audible broke from his lips. Then he lay quite still. Sir Richard bent over
  him with the life preserver still in his hand.</p>

  <p>"I've done it!" he muttered, hoarsely. "One blow! Thank Heaven, he didn't
  want another! His skull was as soft as pudding! Ugh!"</p>

  <p>He turned away. The man who lay stretched upon the floor was an ugly
  sight. His two companions, cowering over the table, were not much better.
  Dyson's trembling fingers went out for the brandy decanter. Half of what he
  poured out was spilled upon the tablecloth. The rest he drank from a tumbler,
  neat.</p>

  <p>"It's nervous work, this, you fellows," he said, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"It's hellish!" Dickinson answered. "Let's have some air in the room. By
  God, it's close!"</p>

  <p>He sank back into his chair, white to the lips. Dyson looked at him
  sharply.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he exclaimed, "I hold you both to our bargain! I was to be
  the one he attacked and who struck the blow&mdash;in self-defence! Remember
  that&mdash;it was in self-defence! I've done it! I've done my share! I hope
  to God I'll forget it some day. Andrew, you know your task. Be a man, and get
  to work!"</p>

  <p>Dickinson rose to his feet unsteadily. "Yes!" he said. "What was it? I
  have forgotten, for the moment, but I am ready."</p>

  <p>"You must get his betting book from his pocket," Sir Richard directed.
  "Then you must help Merries downstairs with him, and into the car. Merries
  is&mdash;to get rid of him."</p>

  <p>Merries shivered. His hand, too, went out for the brandy.</p>

  <p>"To get rid of him," he muttered. "It sounds easy!"</p>

  <p>"It is easy," Sir Richard declared. "You have only to keep your nerve, and
  the thing is done. No one will see him inside the car, in that motoring coat
  and glasses. You can drive somewhere out into the country and leave him."</p>

  <p>"Leave him!" Merries repeated, trembling. "Leave him&mdash;yes!"</p>

  <p>Neither of the two men moved.</p>

  <p>"I must do more than my share, I suppose," Sir Richard declared
  contemptuously. "Come!"</p>

  <p>They dragged the man's body on to a chair, wrapped a huge coat around him,
  tied a motoring cap under his chin, fixed goggles over his eyes. Sir Richard
  strolled into the hall and opened the front door. He stood there for a
  moment, looking up and down the street. When he gave the signal they dragged
  him out, supported between them, across the pavement, into the car. Ugh! His
  attitude was so natural as to be absolutely ghastly. Merries started the car
  and sprang into the driver's seat. There were people in the Square now, but
  the figure reclining in the dark, cushioned interior looked perfectly
  natural.</p>

  <p>"So long, Jimmy," Sir Richard called out. "See you this evening."</p>

  <p>"Right O!" Merries replied, with a brave effort.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, summoned by telephone from his sitting room, slipped down the
  stairs like a cat&mdash;noiseless, swift. The voice which had summoned him
  had been the voice of his secretary&mdash;a voice almost
  unrecognisable&mdash;a voice shaken with fear. Fear? No, it had been
  terror!</p>

  <p>On the landing below, exactly underneath the room from which he had
  descended, there was a door upon which his name was written upon a small
  brass plate&mdash;Mr. Peter Ruff. He opened and closed it behind him with a
  swift movement which he had practised in his idle moments. He found himself
  looking in upon a curious scene.</p>

  <p>Miss Brown, with the radiance of her hair effectually concealed, in plain
  black skirt and simple blouse&mdash;the ideal secretary&mdash;had risen from
  the seat in front of her typewriter, and was standing facing the door through
  which he had entered, with a small revolver&mdash;which he had given her for
  a birthday present only the day before&mdash;clasped in her outstretched
  hand. The object of her solicitude was, it seemed to Peter Ruff, the most
  pitiful-looking object upon which he had ever looked. The hours had dwelt
  with Merries as the years with some people, and worse. He had lost his cap;
  his hair hung over his forehead in wild confusion; his eyes were red,
  bloodshot, and absolutely aflame with the terrors through which he had
  lived&mdash;underneath them the black marks might have been traced with a
  charcoal pencil. His cheeks were livid save for one burning spot. His
  clothes, too, were in disorder&mdash;the starch had gone from his collar, his
  tie hung loosely outside his waistcoat. He was cowering back against the
  wall. And between him and the girl, stretched upon the floor, was the body of
  a man in a huge motor coat, a limp, inert mass which neither moved nor seemed
  to have any sign of life. No wonder that Peter Ruff looked around his office,
  whose serenity had been so tragically disturbed, with an air of mild
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"Dear me," he exclaimed, "something seems to have happened! My dear
  Violet, you can put that revolver away. I have secured the door."</p>

  <p>Her hand fell to her side. She gave a little shiver of relief. Peter Ruff
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is more comfortable," he declared. "Now, perhaps, you will
  explain&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"That young man," she interrupted, "or lunatic&mdash;whatever he calls
  himself&mdash;burst in here a few minutes ago, dragging&mdash;that!" She
  pointed to the motionless figure upon the floor. "If I had not stopped him,
  he would have bolted off without a word of explanation."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, with his back against the door, shook his head gravely.</p>

  <p>"My dear Lord Merries," he said, "my office is not a mortuary."</p>

  <p>Merries gasped.</p>

  <p>"You know me, then?" he muttered, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Ruff answered. "It is my profession to know everybody. Go and
  sit down upon that easy-chair, and drink the brandy and soda which Miss Brown
  is about to mix for you. That's right."</p>

  <p>Merries staggered across the room and half fell into an easy-chair. He
  leaned over the side with his face buried in his hands, unable still to face
  the horror which lay upon the floor. A few seconds later, the tumbler of
  brandy and soda was in his hands. He drank it like a man who drains fresh
  life into his veins.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps now," Peter Ruff suggested, pointing to the motionless figure,
  "you can give me some explanation as to this!"</p>

  <p>Merries looked away from him all the time he was speaking. His voice was
  thick and nervous.</p>

  <p>"There were three of us lunching together," he began&mdash;"four in all.
  There was a dispute, and this man threatened us. Afterwards there was a
  fight. It fell to my lot to take him away, and I can't get rid of him! I
  can't get rid of him!" he repeated, with something that sounded like a
  sob.</p>

  <p>"I still do not see," Peter Ruff argued, "why you should have brought him
  here and deposited him upon my perfectly new carpet."</p>

  <p>"You are Peter Ruff," Merries declared. "'Crime Investigator and Private
  Detective,' you call yourself. You are used to this sort of thing. You will
  know what to do with it. It is part of your business."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," Peter Ruff answered, "that you are under a delusion as
  to the details of my profession. I am Peter Ruff," he admitted, "and I call
  myself a crime investigator&mdash;in fact, I am the only one worth speaking
  of in the world. But I certainly deny that I am used to having dead bodies
  deposited upon my carpet, and that I make a habit of disposing of
  them&mdash;especially gratis."</p>

  <p>Merries tore open his coat.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, his voice shaking hysterically, "I must get rid of it
  or go mad. For two hours I have been driving about in a motor car
  with&mdash;it for a passenger. I drove to a quiet spot and I tried to lift it
  out&mdash;a policeman rode up! I tried again, a man rushed by on a motor
  cycle, and turned to look at me! I tried a few minutes later&mdash;the
  policeman came back! It was always the same. The night seemed to have eyes. I
  was watched everywhere. The&mdash;the face began to mock me. I'll swear that
  I heard it chuckle once!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff moved a little further away.</p>

  <p>"I don't think I'll have anything to do with it," he declared. "I don't
  like your description at all."</p>

  <p>"It'll be all right with you," Merries declared eagerly. "It's my nerves,
  that's all. You see, I was there&mdash;when the accident happened. See here,"
  he added, tearing a pocketbook from his coat, "I have three hundred and
  seventy pounds saved up in case I had to bolt. I'll keep seventy&mdash;three
  hundred for you&mdash;to dispose of it!"</p>

  <p>Ruff leaned over the motionless body, looked into its face, and
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Masters, the bookmaker," he remarked. "H'm! I did hear that he had a lot
  of money coming to him over the Cambridgeshire."</p>

  <p>Merries shuddered.</p>

  <p>"May I go?" he pleaded. "There's the three hundred on the table. For God's
  sake, let me go!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd saved a little more," he said. "However&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He turned the lock and Merries rushed out of the room. Ruff looked across
  the room towards his secretary.</p>

  <p>"Ring up 1535 Central," he ordered, sharply.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff had descended from his apartments on the top floor of the
  building, in a new brown suit with which he was violently displeased, to meet
  a caller.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to intrude&mdash;Mr. Ruff, I believe it is?" Sir Richard Dyson
  said, a little irritably&mdash;"but I have not a great deal of time to
  spare&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Most natural!" Peter Ruff declared. "Pray take a chair, Sir Richard. You
  want to know, of course, about Lord Merries and poor Masters."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard stared at his questioner, for a moment, without speech. Once
  more the fear which he had succeeded in banishing for a while, shone in his
  eyes&mdash;revealed itself in his white face.</p>

  <p>"Try the easy-chair, Sir Richard," Ruff continued, pleasantly. "Leave your
  hat and cane on the table there, and make yourself comfortable. I should like
  to understand exactly what you have come to me for."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard moved his head toward Miss Brown.</p>

  <p>"My business with you," he said, "is more than ordinarily private. I have
  the honour of knowing Miss&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Miss Brown," Peter interrupted quickly. "In these offices, this young
  lady's name is Miss Violet Brown."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"It is of no importance," he said, "only, as you may understand, my
  business with you scarcely requires the presence of a third party, even one
  with the discretion which I am sure Miss&mdash;Brown possesses."</p>

  <p>"In these matters," Ruff answered, "my secretary does not exist apart from
  myself. Her presence is necessary. She takes down in shorthand notes of our
  conversation. I have a shocking memory, and there are always points which I
  forget. At the conclusion of our business, whatever it may be, these notes
  are destroyed. I could not work without them, however."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard glanced a little doubtfully at the long, slim back of the girl
  who sat with her face turned away from him. "Of course," he began, "if you
  make yourself personally responsible for her discretion&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I am willing to do so," Ruff interrupted, brusquely. "I guarantee it. Go
  on, please."</p>

  <p>"I do not know, of course, where you got your information from," Sir
  Richard began, "but it is perfectly true that I have come here to consult you
  upon a matter in which the two people whose names you have mentioned are
  concerned. The disappearance of Job Masters is, of course, common talk; but I
  cannot tell what has led you to associate with it the temporary absence of
  Lord Merries from this country."</p>

  <p>"Let me ask you this question," Ruff said. "How are you affected by the
  disappearance of Masters?"</p>

  <p>"Indirectly, it has caused me a great deal of inconvenience," Sir Richard
  declared.</p>

  <p>"Facts, please," murmured Peter.</p>

  <p>"It has been rumoured," Sir Richard admitted, "that I owed Masters a large
  sum of money which I could not pay."</p>

  <p>"Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"It has also been rumoured," Sir Richard continued, "that he was seen to
  enter my house that day, and that he remained there until late in the
  afternoon."</p>

  <p>"Did he?" asked Ruff.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Sir Richard answered.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff yawned for a moment, but covered the indiscretion with his
  hand.</p>

  <p>"Respecting this inconvenience," he said, "which you admit that the
  disappearance of Job Masters has caused you, what is its tangible side?"</p>

  <p>Sir Richard drew his chair a little nearer to the table where Ruff was
  sitting. His voice dropped almost to a whisper.</p>

  <p>"It seems absurd," he said, "and yet, what I tell you is the truth. I have
  been followed about&mdash;shadowed, in fact&mdash;for several days. Men, even
  in my own social circle, seem to hold aloof from me. It is as though," he
  continued slowly, "people were beginning to suspect me of being connected in
  some way with the man's disappearance."</p>

  <p>Ruff, who had been making figures with a pencil on the edge of his
  blotting paper, suddenly turned round. His eyes flashed with a new light as
  they became fixed upon his companion's.</p>

  <p>"And are you not?" he asked, calmly. Sir Richard bore himself well. For a
  moment he had shrunk back. Then he half rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ruff!" he said. "I must protest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff used no violent gesture. Only his forefinger tapped the desk in
  front of him. His voice was as smooth as velvet.</p>

  <p>"Tell me as much or as little as you please, Sir Richard," he said, "but
  let that little or that much be the truth! On those terms only I may be able
  to help you. You do not go to your physician and expect him to prescribe to
  you while you conceal your symptoms, or to your lawyer for advice and tell
  him half the truth. I am not asking for your confidence. I simply tell you
  that you are wasting your time and mine if you choose to withhold it."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard was silent. He recognized a new quality in the man&mdash;but
  the truth was an awful thing to tell! He considered&mdash;then told.</p>

  <p>Ruff briskly asked two questions. "In alluding to your heavy settlement
  with Masters, you said just now that you could not have paid
  him&mdash;then."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Sir Richard admitted. "That is the rotten part of the whole
  affair. Four days later a wonderful double came off&mdash;one in which we
  were all interested, and one which not one of us expected. We've drawn a
  considerable amount already from one or two bookies, and I believe even
  Masters owes us a bit now."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Ruff said. "I think that I know everything now. My fee is
  five hundred guineas."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard looked at him.</p>

  <p>"What?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Five hundred guineas," Ruff repeated.</p>

  <p>"For a consultation?" Sir Richard asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"More than that," he said. "You are a brave man in your way, Sir Richard
  Dyson, but you are going about now shivering under a load of fear. It sits
  like a devil incarnate upon your shoulders. It poisons the air wherever you
  go. Write your cheque, Sir Richard, and you can leave that little black devil
  in my wastebasket. You are under my protection. Nothing will happen to
  you."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard sat like a man mesmerised. The little man with the amiable
  expression and the badly fitting suit was leaning back in his chair, his
  finger tips pressed together, waiting.</p>

  <p>"Nothing will happen!" Sir Richard repeated, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not. I guarantee you against any inconvenience which might
  arise to you from this recent unfortunate affair. Isn't that all you
  want?"</p>

  <p>"It's all I want, certainly," Sir Richard declared, "but I must understand
  a little how you propose to secure my immunity."</p>

  <p>Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I have my own methods," he said. "I can help only those who trust
  me."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard drew a cheque book from his pocket. "I don't know why I should
  believe in you," he said, as he wrote the cheque.</p>

  <p>"But you do," Peter Ruff said, smiling. "Fortunately for you, you do!"</p>

  <p>It was not so easy to impart a similar confidence into the breast of
  Colonel Dickinson, with whom Sir Richard dined that night tete-a-tete.
  Dickinson was inclined to think that Sir Richard ad been "had."</p>

  <p>"You've paid a ridiculous fee," he argued, "and all that you have in
  return is the fellow's promise to see you through. It isn't like you to part
  with money so easily, Richard. Did he hypnotise you?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Sir Richard answered. "I wasn't conscious of it."</p>

  <p>"What sort of a fellow is he?" Dickinson asked.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard looked reflectively into his glass.</p>

  <p>"He's a vulgar sort of little Johnny," he said. "Looks as though he were
  always dressed in new clothes and couldn't get used to them."</p>

  <p>Three men entered the room. Two remained in the background. John Dory came
  forward towards the table.</p>

  <p>"Sir Richard Dyson," he said, gravely, "I have come upon an unpleasant
  errand."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Sir Richard said, fingering something hard inside pocket of his
  coat.</p>

  <p>"I have a warrant for your arrest," Dory continued, "in connection with
  the disappearance of Job Masters on Saturday, the 10th of November last. I
  will read the terms of the warrant, if you choose. It is my duty to warn you
  that anything you may now say can be used in evidence against you. This
  gentleman, I believe, is Colonel Dickinson?"</p>

  <p>"That is my name, sir," Dickinson answered, with unexpected fortitude.</p>

  <p>"I regret to say," the detective continued, "that I have also a warrant
  for your arrest in connection with the same matter."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard had hold of the butt end of his revolver then. Like grisly
  phantoms, the thoughts chased one another through his brain. Should he shoot
  and end it&mdash;pass into black nothingness&mdash;escape disgrace, but die
  like a rat in a corner? His finger was upon the trigger. Then suddenly his
  heart gave a great leap. He raised his head as though listening. Something
  flashed in his eyes&mdash;something that was almost like hope. There was no
  mistaking that voice which he had heard in the hall! He made a great
  rally.</p>

  <p>"I can only conclude," he said, turning to the detective, "that you have
  made some absurd blunder. If you really possess the warrants you speak of,
  however, Colonel Dickinson and I will accompany you wherever you choose."</p>

  <p>Then the door opened and Peter Ruff walked in, followed by Job Masters,
  whose head was still bandaged, and who seemed to have lost a little flesh and
  a lot of colour. Peter Ruff looked round apologetically. He seemed surprised
  not to find Sir Richard Dyson and Colonel Dickinson alone. He seemed more
  than ever surprised to recognize Dory.</p>

  <p>"I trust," he said smoothly, "that our visit is not inopportune. Sir
  Richard Dyson, I believe?" he continued, bowing&mdash;"my friend, Mr. Masters
  here, has consulted me as to the loss of a betting book, and we ventured to
  call to ask you, sir, if by any chance on his recent visit to your
  house&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"God in Heaven, it's Masters!" Dyson exclaimed. "It's Job Masters!"</p>

  <p>"That's me, sir," Masters admitted. "Mr. Ruff thought you might be able to
  help me find that book."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard swayed upon his feet. Then the blood rushed once more through
  his veins.</p>

  <p>"Your book's here in my cabinet, safe enough," he said. "You left it here
  after our luncheon that day. Where on earth have you been to, man?" he
  continued. "We want some money from you over Myopia."</p>

  <p>"I'll pay all right, sir," Masters answered. "Fact is, after our luncheon
  party I'm afraid I got a bit fuddled. I don't seem to remember much."</p>

  <p>He sat down a little heavily. Peter Ruff hastened to the table and took up
  a glass.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me if I give him a little brandy, won't you, sir?" he
  said. "He's really not quite fit for getting about yet, but he was worrying
  about his book."</p>

  <p>"Give him all the brandy he can drink," Sir Richard answered.</p>

  <p>The detective's face had been a study. He knew Masters well enough by
  sight&mdash;there was no doubt about his identity! His teeth came together
  with an angry little click. He had made a mistake! It was a thing which would
  be remembered against him forever! It was as bad as his failure to arrest
  that young man at Daisy Villa.</p>

  <p>"Your visit, Masters," Sir Richard said, with a curious smile at the
  corners of his lips, "is, in some respects, a little opportune. About that
  little matter we were speaking of," he continued, turning towards the
  detective.</p>

  <p>"We have only to offer you our apologies, Sir Richard," Dory answered.</p>

  <p>Then he crossed the room and confronted Peter Ruff.</p>

  <p>"Do I understand, sir, that your name is Ruff&mdash;Peter Ruff?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"That is my name, sir," Peter Ruff admitted, pleasantly "Yours I believe,
  is Dory. We are likely to come across one another now and then, I suppose.
  Glad to know you."</p>

  <p>The detective stood quite still, and there was no geniality in his
  face.</p>

  <p>"I wonder&mdash;have we ever met before?" he asked, without removing his
  eyes from the other's face. Peter Ruff smiled.</p>

  <p>"Not professionally, at any rate," he answered. "I know that Scotland Yard
  you don't think much of us small fry, but we find out things sometimes!"</p>

  <p>"Why didn't you contradict all those rumours as to his disappearance?" the
  detective asked, pointing to where Job Masters was contentedly sipping his
  brandy and water.</p>

  <p>"I was acting for my client, and in my own interests," replied Peter. "It
  was surely no part of my duty to save you gentlemen at Scotland Yard from
  hunting up mare's nests!"</p>

  <p>John Dory went out, followed by his men. Sir Richard took Peter Ruff by
  the arm, and, leading him to the sideboard, mixed him a drink.</p>

  <p>"Peter Ruff," he said, "you're a clever scoundrel, but you've earned your
  five hundred guineas. Hang it, you're welcome to them! Is there anything else
  I can do for you?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff raised his glass and set it down again. Once more he eyed with
  admiration his client's well-turned out figure.</p>

  <p>"You might give me a letter to your tailors, Sir Richard," he begged.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard laughed outright&mdash;it was some time since he had
  laughed!</p>

  <p>"You shall have it, Peter Ruff," he declared, raising his glass&mdash;"and
  here's to you!"</p>

  <h2>III. VINCENT CAWDOR, COMMISSION AGENT</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Nov 1909</h3>

  <p class="first">For the second time since their new association, Peter Ruff
  had surprised that look upon his secretary's face. This time he wheeled
  around in his chair and addressed her.</p>

  <p>"My dear Violet," he said, "be frank with me. What is wrong?"</p>

  <p>Miss Brown turned to face her employer. Save for a greater demureness of
  expression and the extreme simplicity of her attire, she had changed very
  little since she had given up her life of comparative luxury to become Peter
  Ruff's secretary. There was a sort of personal elegance which clung to her,
  notwithstanding her strenuous attempts to dress for her part, except for
  which she looked precisely as a private secretary and typist should look. She
  even wore a black bow at the back of her hair.</p>

  <p>"I have not complained, have I?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Do not waste time," Peter Ruff said, coldly. "Proceed."</p>

  <p>"I have not enough to do," she said. "I do not understand why you refuse
  so many cases."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I did not bring my talents into this business," he said, "to watch
  flirting wives, to ascertain the haunts of gay husbands, or to detect the
  pilferings of servants."</p>

  <p>"Anything is better than sitting still," she protested.</p>

  <p>"I do not agree with you," Peter Ruff said. "I like sitting still very
  much indeed&mdash;one has time to think. Is there anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Shall I really go on?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"By all means," he answered.</p>

  <p>"I have idea," she continued, "that you are subordinating your general
  interests to your secret enmity&mdash;to one man. You are waiting until you
  can find another case in which you are pitted against him."</p>

  <p>"Sometimes," Peter Ruff said, "your intelligence surprises me!"</p>

  <p>"I came to you," she continued, looking at him earnestly, "for two
  reasons. The personal one I will not touch upon. The other was my love of
  excitement. I have tried many things in life, as you know, Peter, but I have
  seemed to carry always with me the heritage of weariness. I thought that my
  position here would help me to fight against it."</p>

  <p>"You have seen me bring a corpse to life," Peter Ruff reminded her, a
  little aggrieved.</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"It was a month ago," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that sort of thing every day," he declared.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," she answered; "but you have refused four cases within the
  last five days."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff whistled softly to himself for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Seen anything of our new neighbour in the flat above?" he asked, with
  apparent irrelevance.</p>

  <p>Miss Brown looked across at him with upraised eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I have been in the lift with him twice," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Fancy his appearance?" Ruff asked, casually.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least!" Violet answered. "I thought him a vulgar, offensive
  person!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff chuckled. He seemed immensely delighted.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vincent Cawdor he calls himself, I believe," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," Miss Brown declared. The subject did not appeal to
  her.</p>

  <p>"His name is on a small copper plate just over the letter-box," Ruff said.
  "Rather neat idea, by the bye. He calls himself a commission agent, I
  believe."</p>

  <p>Violet was suddenly interested. She realized, after all, that Mr. Vincent
  Cawdor might be a person of some importance.</p>

  <p>"What is a commission agent?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It might mean anything," he declared. "Never trust any one who is not a
  little more explicit as to his profession. I am afraid that this Mr. Vincent
  Cawdor, for instance, is a bad lot."</p>

  <p>"I am sure he is," Miss Brown declared.</p>

  <p>"Looks after a pretty girl, coughs in the lift&mdash;all that sort of
  thing, eh?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Disgusting!" she exclaimed, with emphasis.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed, and glanced at the clock. The existence of Mr. Vincent
  Cawdor seemed to pass out of his mind.</p>

  <p>"It is nearly one o'clock," he said. "Where do you usually lunch,
  Violet?"</p>

  <p>"It depends upon my appetite," she answered, carelessly. "Most often at an
  A B C."</p>

  <p>"To-day," Peter Ruff said, "you will be extravagant&mdash;at my
  expense."</p>

  <p>"I had a poor breakfast," Miss Brown remarked, complacently.</p>

  <p>"You will leave at once," Peter Ruff said, "and you will go to the French
  Cafe at the Milan. Get a table facing the courtyard, and towards the hotel
  side of the room. Keep your eyes open and tell me exactly what you see."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with parted lips. Her eyes were full of eager
  questioning.</p>

  <p>"Mere skirmishing," Peter Ruff continued, "but I think&mdash;yes, I think
  that it may lead to something."</p>

  <p>"Whom am I to watch?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Any one who looks interesting," Peter Ruff answered. "For instance, if
  this person Vincent Cawdor should be about."</p>

  <p>"He would recognize me!" she declared.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"One must hold the candle," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I decline to flirt with him," she declared. "Nothing would induce me to
  be pleasant to such an odious creature."</p>

  <p>"He will be too busy to attempt anything of the sort. Of course he may not
  be there. It may be the merest fancy on my part. At any rate, you may rely
  upon it that he will not make any overtures in a public place like the Milan.
  Mr. Vincent Cawdor may be a curious sort of person, but I do not fancy that
  he is a fool!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," Miss Brown said, "I will go."</p>

  <p>"Be back soon after three," Peter Ruff said. "I am going up to my room to
  do my exercises."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I shall have my lunch sent in," he answered. "Don't hurry back, though. I
  shall not expect you till a quarter past three."</p>

  <p>It was a few minutes past that time when Miss Brown returned. Peter Ruff
  was sitting at his desk, looking as though he had never moved. He was
  absorbed by a book of patterns sent in by his new tailor, and he only glanced
  up when she entered the room.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, earnestly, "come in and sit down. I want to consult
  you. There is a new material here&mdash;a sort of mouse-coloured cheviot. I
  wonder whether it would suit me?"</p>

  <p>Violet was looking very handsome and a little flushed. She raised her veil
  and came over to his side.</p>

  <p>"Put that stupid book away, Peter," she said. "I want to tell you about
  the Milan."</p>

  <p>He leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said. "I had forgotten! Was Mr. Vincent Cawdor there?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she answered, still a little breathless. "There was some one else
  there, too, in whom you are still more interested."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Vincent Cawdor," she continued, "came in alone. He looked just as
  objectionable as ever, and he stared at me till I nearly threw my wine glass
  at him."</p>

  <p>"He did not speak to you?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"I was afraid that he was going to," Miss Brown said, "but fortunately he
  met a friend who came to his table and lunched with him."</p>

  <p>"A friend," Ruff remarked. "Good! What was he like?"</p>

  <p>"Fair, slight, Teutonic," Miss Brown answered. "He wore thick spectacles,
  and his moustache was positively yellow."</p>

  <p>Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said.</p>

  <p>"Towards the end of luncheon," she continued, "an American came up to
  them."</p>

  <p>"An American?" Peter Ruff interrupted. "How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>Miss Brown smiled.</p>

  <p>"He was clean-shaven and he wore neat clothes," she said. "He talked with
  an accent you could have cut with a knife and he had a Baedeker sticking out
  of his pocket. After luncheon, they all three went away to the smoking
  room."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Anything else?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The girl smiled triumphantly.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she declared. "There was something else&mdash;something which I
  think you will find interesting. At the next table to me there was a
  man&mdash;alone. Can you guess who he was?"</p>

  <p>"John Dory," Ruff said, calmly.</p>

  <p>The girl was disappointed.</p>

  <p>"You knew!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"My dear Violet," he said, "I did not send you there on a fool's
  errand."</p>

  <p>"There is something doing, then?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"There is likely," he answered, grimly, "to be a great deal doing!"</p>

  <p>The two men who stood upon the hill, and Peter Ruff, who lay upon his
  stomach behind a huge boulder, looked upon a new thing.</p>

  <p>Far down in the valley from out of a black shed&mdash;the only sign of
  man's handiwork for many miles&mdash;it came&mdash;something grey at first,
  moving slowly as though being pushed down a slight incline, then afloat in
  the air, gathering speed&mdash;something between a torpedo with wings and a
  great prehistoric insect. Now and then it described strange circles, but
  mostly it came towards them as swift and as true as an arrow shot from a bow.
  The two men looked at one another&mdash;the shorter, to whose cheeks the
  Cumberland winds had brought no trace of colour, gave vent to a hoarse
  exclamation.</p>

  <p>"He's done it!" he growled.</p>

  <p>"Wait!" the other answered.</p>

  <p>Over their heads the thing wheeled, and seemed to stand still in the air.
  The beating of the engine was so faint that Peter Ruff from behind the
  boulder, could hear all that was said. A man leaned out from his seat&mdash;a
  man with wan cheeks but blazing eyes.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said. "Take your glasses. There&mdash;due north&mdash;can you
  see a steeple?"</p>

  <p>The men turned their field glasses in the direction toward which the other
  pointed. "Yes!" they answered. "It is sixteen miles, as the crow flies, to
  Barnham Church&mdash;thirty-two miles there and back. Wait!"</p>

  <p>He swung round, dived till he seemed about to touch the hillside, then
  soared upwards and straight away. Peter Ruff took out his watch. The other
  two men gazed with fascinated eyes after the disappearing speck.</p>

  <p>"If he does it&mdash;" the shorter one muttered.</p>

  <p>"He will do it!" the other answered.</p>

  <p>He was back again before their eyes were weary of watching. Peter Ruff,
  from behind the boulder, closed his watch. Thirty-two miles in less than half
  an hour! The youth leaned from his seat.</p>

  <p>"Is it enough?" he asked, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"It is enough!" the two men answered together. "We will come down."</p>

  <p>The youth touched a lever and the machine glided down towards the valley,
  falling all the while with the effortless grace a parachute. The shed from
  which his machine had issued was midway down a slope, with a short length of
  rails which ran, apparently, through it. The machine seemed to hover for
  several moments above the building, then descended slowly on to the rails and
  disappeared in the shed. The two men were already half-way down the hill.
  Peter Ruff rose from behind the boulder, stretched himself with a sense of
  immense relief, and lit a pipe. As yet he dared not descend. He simply
  changed his hiding place for a spot which enabled him to command a view of
  the handful of cottages at the back of the hill. He had plenty to think
  about. It was a wonderful thing&mdash;this&mdash;which he had seen!</p>

  <p>The youth, meanwhile, was drinking deep of the poisonous cup. He walked
  between the two men&mdash;his cheeks were flushed, his eyes on fire.</p>

  <p>"If all the world to-day had seen what we have seen," the older man was
  saying, "there would be no more talk of Wilbur Wrights or Farmans. Those men
  are babies, playing with their toys."</p>

  <p>"Mine is the ideal principle," the youth declared. "No one else has
  thought of it, no one else has made use of it. Yet all the time I am
  afraid&mdash;it is so simple."</p>

  <p>"Sell quick, then," the fair-headed man advised. "By to-morrow night I can
  promise you fifty thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>The youth stopped. He drew a deep breath.</p>

  <p>"I shall sell," he declared. "I need money. I want to live. Fifty thousand
  pounds is enough. Eleven weary months I have slept and toiled there in the
  shed."</p>

  <p>"It is finished," the older man declared. "To-night you shall come with us
  to London. To-morrow night your pockets shall be full of gold. It will be a
  change for you."</p>

  <p>The youth sobbed.</p>

  <p>"God knows it will," he muttered. "I haven't two shillings in the world,
  and I owe for my last petrol."</p>

  <p>The two men laughed heartily. The elder took a little bundle of notes from
  his pocket and handed them to the boy.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "not for another moment shall you feel as poor as that.
  Money will have no value for you in the future. The fifty thousand pounds
  will only be a start. After that, you will get royalties. If I had it, I
  would give you a quarter of a million now for your plans; I know that I can
  get you more."</p>

  <p>The youth laughed hysterically. They entered the tiny inn and drank
  home-made wine&mdash;the best they could get. Then a great car drew up
  outside, and the older&mdash;the clean-shaven man, who looked like an
  American&mdash;hurried out, and dragging a hamper from beneath the seat
  returned with a gold-foiled bottle in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "a toast! We have one bottle left&mdash;one bottle of the
  best!"</p>

  <p>"Champagne!" the youth cried eagerly, holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>"The only wine for the conquerors," the other declared, pouring it out
  into the thick tumblers. "Drink, all of you, to the Franklin Flying Machine,
  to the millions she will earn&mdash;to to-morrow night!"</p>

  <p>The youth drained his glass, watched it replenished, and drained it again.
  Then they went out to the car.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing yet to be done," he said. "Wait here for me."</p>

  <p>They waited whilst he climbed up toward the shed. The two men watched him.
  A little group of rustics stood open-mouthed around the great car. Then there
  was a little shout. From above their heads came the sound of a great
  explosion&mdash;red flames were leaping up from that black barn to the sky.
  The two men looked at one another. They rushed to the hill and met the youth
  descending.</p>

  <p>"What the&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped them.</p>

  <p>"I dared not leave it here," he explained. "It would have been madness. I
  am perfectly certain that I have been watched during the last few days. I can
  build another in a week. I have the plans in my pocket for every part."</p>

  <p>The older man wiped the perspiration from his forehead.</p>

  <p>"You are sure&mdash;that you have the plans?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The youth struck himself on the chest.</p>

  <p>"They are here," he answered, "every one of them!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are right, then," the other man answered. "It gave me a turn,
  though. You are sure that you can make it again in the time you say?"</p>

  <p>"Of course!" the youth answered, impatiently. "Besides, the thing is so
  simple. It speaks for itself."</p>

  <p>They climbed into the car, and in a few minutes were rushing away
  southwards.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow night&mdash;to-morrow night it all begins!" the youth
  continued. "I must start with ready-made clothes. I'll get the best I can,
  eat the best I can, drink wine, go to the music halls. To-morrow night."</p>

  <p>His speech ended in a wail&mdash;a strange, half-stifled cry which rang
  out with a chill, ghostly sound upon the black silence. His face was covered
  with a wet towel, a ghastly odor was in his nostrils, his lips refused to
  utter any further sound. He lay back among the cushions, senseless. The car
  slowed down.</p>

  <p>"Get the papers, quick!" the elder man muttered, opening the youth's coat.
  "Here they are! Catch hold, Dick! My God! What's that?"</p>

  <p>He shook from head to foot. The little fair man looked at him with
  contempt.</p>

  <p>"A sheep bell on the moor," he said. "Are you sure you have
  everything?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" the other muttered.</p>

  <p>They both stood up and raised the prostrate form between them. Below them
  were the black waters of the lake.</p>

  <p>"Over with him!" the younger said. "Quick!"</p>

  <p>Once more his companion shrank away.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he muttered, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>They both held their breaths. From somewhere along the road behind came a
  faint sound like the beating of an engine.</p>

  <p>"It's a car!" the elder man exclaimed. "Quick! Over with him!"</p>

  <p>They lifted the body of the boy, whose lips were white and speechless now,
  and threw him into the water. With a great splash he disappeared. They
  watched for a moment. Only the ripples flowed away from the place where he
  had sunk. They jumped back to their seats.</p>

  <p>"There's something close behind," the older man muttered. "Get on! Fast!
  Fast!"</p>

  <p>The younger man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he said slowly, "it would be better to wait and see who it is
  coming up behind. Our young friend there is safe. The current has him, and
  the tarn is bottomless."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's indecision&mdash;a moment which was to count for much
  in the lives of three men. Then the elder one's counsels prevailed. They
  crept away down the hill, smoothly and noiselessly. Behind them, the faint
  throbbing grew less and less distinct. Soon they heard it no more. They drove
  into the dawn and through the long day.</p>

  <p>Side by side on one of the big leather couches in the small smoking room
  of the Milan Hotel, Mr. James P. Rounceby and his friend Mr. Richard Marnstam
  sat whispering together. It was nearly two o clock, and they were alone in
  the room. Some of the lights had been turned out. The roar of life in the
  streets without had ceased. It was an uneasy hour for those whose consciences
  were not wholly at rest!</p>

  <p>The two men were in evening dress&mdash;Rounceby in dinner coat and black
  tie, as befitted his role of travelling American. The glasses in front of
  them were only half-filled, and had remained so for the last hour. Their
  conversation had been nervous and spasmodic. It was obvious that they were
  waiting for some one.</p>

  <p>Three o'clock struck by the little timepiece on the mantel shelf. A little
  exclamation of a profane nature broke from Rounceby's lips. He leaned toward
  his companion.</p>

  <p>"Say," he muttered, in a rather thick undertone, "how about this fellow
  Vincent Cawdor? You haven't any doubts about him, I suppose? He's on the
  square, all right, eh?"</p>

  <p>Marnstam wet his lips nervously.</p>

  <p>"Cawdor's all right," he said. "I had it direct from headquarters at
  Paris. What are you uneasy about, eh?"</p>

  <p>Rounceby pointed towards the clock.</p>

  <p>"Do you see the time?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He said he'd be late," Marnstam answered.</p>

  <p>Rounceby put his hand to his forehead and found it moist.</p>

  <p>"It's been a silly game, all along," he muttered. "We'd better have
  brought the young ass up here and jostled him!"</p>

  <p>"Not so easy," Marnstam answered. "These young fools have a way of turning
  obstinate. He'd have chucked us, sure. Anyhow, he's safer where he is."</p>

  <p>They relapsed once more into silence. A storm of rain beat upon the
  window. Rounceby glanced up. It was as black out there as were the waters of
  that silent tarn! The man shivered as the thought struck him. Marnstam, who
  had no nerves, twirled his moustache and watched his companion with
  wonder.</p>

  <p>"You look as though you saw a ghost," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I do!" Rounceby growled.</p>

  <p>"You had better finish your drink, my dear fellow," Marnstam advised.
  "Afterwards&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Suddenly he stiffened into attention. He laid his hand upon his
  companion's knee.</p>

  <p>"Listen!" he said. "There is some one coming."</p>

  <p>They leaned a little forward. The swing doors were opened. A girl's
  musical laugh rang out from the corridor. Tall and elegant, with her black
  lace skirt trailing upon the floor, her left hand resting upon the shoulder
  of the man into whose ear she was whispering, and whom she led straight to
  one of the writing tables, Miss Violet Brown swept into the room. On her
  right, and nearest to the two men, was Mr. Vincent Cawdor.</p>

  <p>"Now you can go and talk to your friends!" she exclaimed, lightly. "I am
  going to make Victor listen to me."</p>

  <p>Cawdor left his two companions and sank on to the couch by Rounceby's
  side. The young man, with his opera hat still on his head, and the light
  overcoat which he had been carrying on the floor by his side, was seated
  before the writing table with his back to them. Miss Brown was leaning over
  him, with her hand upon the back of his chair. They were out of hearing of
  the other three men.</p>

  <p>"Well, Rounceby, my friend," Mr. Vincent Cawdor remarked, cheerfully,
  "you're having a late sitting, eh?"</p>

  <p>"We've been waiting for you, you fool!" Rounceby answered. "What on earth
  are you thinking about, bringing a crowd like this about with you, eh?"</p>

  <p>Cawdor smiled, reassuringly.</p>

  <p>"Don't you worry," he said, in a lower tone. "I know my way in and out of
  the ropes here better than you can teach me. A big hotel like this is the
  safest and the most dangerous place in the world&mdash;just how you choose to
  make it. You've got to bluff 'em all the time. That's why I brought the young
  lady&mdash;particular friend of mine&mdash;real nice girl, too!"</p>

  <p>"And the young man?" Rounceby asked, suspiciously.</p>

  <p>Cawdor grew more serious.</p>

  <p>"That's Captain Lowther," he said softly&mdash;"private secretary to
  Colonel Dean, who's the chief of the aeronaut department at Aldershot. He has
  a draft in his pocket for twenty thousand pounds. It is yours if he is
  satisfied with the plans."</p>

  <p>"Twenty thousand pounds!" Marnstam said, thoughtfully. "It is very
  little&mdash;very little indeed for the risks which we have run!"</p>

  <p>Cawdor moved his place and sat between the men. He laid a hand upon
  Marnstam's shoulder&mdash;another on Rounceby's knee.</p>

  <p>"My dear friends," he said, impressively, "if you could have built a
  model, or conducted these negotiations in the usual way, you might have asked
  a million. As it is, I think I am the only man in England who could have
  dealt with this matter&mdash;so satisfactorily."</p>

  <p>Rounceby glanced suspiciously at the young man to whom Miss Brown was
  still devoting the whole of her attention.</p>

  <p>"Why don't he come out and talk like a man?" he asked. "What's the idea of
  his sitting over there with his back to us?"</p>

  <p>"I want him never to see your faces&mdash;to deal only with me," Cawdor
  explained. "Remember that he is in an official position. The money he is
  going to part with is secret service money."</p>

  <p>The two men were beginning to be more reassured. Rounceby slowly produced
  a roll of oilskin from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"He'll look at them as he sits there," he insisted. "There must be no
  copying or making notes, mind."</p>

  <p>Cawdor smiled in a superior fashion.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "you are dealing with the emissary of a
  government&mdash;not one of your own sort."</p>

  <p>Rounceby glanced at his companion, who nodded. Then he handed over the
  plans.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to look sharp," he said. "It's not so late but that there may be
  people in here yet."</p>

  <p>Cawdor crossed the room with the plans, and laid them down before the
  writing table. Rounceby rose to his feet and lit a cigar. Marnstam walked to
  the further window and back again. They stood side by side. Rounceby's whole
  frame seemed to have stiffened with some new emotion.</p>

  <p>"There's something wrong, Jim," Marnstam whispered softly in his ear.
  "You've got the old lady in your pocket?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" Rounceby answered thickly, "and, by Heavens, I'm going to use
  it!"</p>

  <p>"Don't shoot unless it's the worst," Marnstam counselled. "I shall go out
  of that window, into the tree, and run for the river. But bluff first,
  Jim&mdash;bluff for your life!"</p>

  <p>There were swinging doors leading into the room from the hotel side, and a
  small door exactly opposite which led to the residential part of the place.
  Both of these doors were opened at precisely the same moment. Through the
  former stepped two strong looking men in long overcoats, and with the
  unmistakable appearance of policemen in plain clothes. Through the latter
  came John Dory! He walked straight up to the two men. It spoke volumes for
  his courage that, knowing their characters and believing them to be in
  desperate straits, he came unarmed.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I hold warrants for your arrest. I will not trouble
  you with your aliases. You are known to-day, I believe, as James Rounceby and
  Richard Marnstam. Will you come quietly?"</p>

  <p>Marnstam's expression was one of bland and beautiful surprise.</p>

  <p>"My dear sir," he said, edging, however, a little toward the
  window&mdash;"you must be joking! What is the charge?"</p>

  <p>"You are charged with the wilful murder of a young man named Victor
  Franklin," answered Dory. "His body was recovered from Longthorp Tarn this
  afternoon. You had better say nothing. Also with the theft of certain papers
  known to have been in his possession."</p>

  <p>Now it is possible that at this precise moment Marnstam would have made
  his spring for the window and Rounceby his running fight for liberty. The
  hands of both men were upon their revolvers, and John Dory's life was a thing
  of no account. But at this juncture a thing happened. There were in the room
  the two policemen guarding the swing doors, and behind them the pale faces of
  a couple of night porters looking anxiously in. Vincent Cawdor and Miss Brown
  were standing side by side, a little in the background, and the young man who
  had been their companion had risen also to his feet. As though with some
  intention of intervening, he moved a step forward, almost in line with Dory.
  Rounceby saw him, and a new fear gripped him by the heart. He shrank back,
  his fingers relaxed their hold of his weapon, the sweat was hot upon his
  forehead. Marnstam, though he seemed for a moment stupefied, realised the
  miracle which had happened and struck boldly for his own.</p>

  <p>"If this is a joke," he said, "it strikes me as being a particularly bad
  one. I should like to know, sir, how you dare to come into this room and
  charge me and my friend&mdash;Mr. Rounceby&mdash;with being concerned in the
  murder of a young man who is even now actually standing by your side."</p>

  <p>John Dory started back. He looked with something like apprehension at the
  youth to whom Marnstam pointed.</p>

  <p>"My name is Victor Franklin," that young man declared. "What's all this
  about?"</p>

  <p>Dory felt the ground give beneath his feet. Nevertheless, he set his teeth
  and fought for his hand.</p>

  <p>"You say that your name is Victor Franklin?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly!"</p>

  <p>"You are the inventor of a flying machine?"</p>

  <p>"I am."</p>

  <p>"You were in Westmoreland with these two men a few days go?"</p>

  <p>"I was," the young man admitted.</p>

  <p>"You left the village of Scawton in a motor car with them?"</p>

  <p>"Yes! We quarrelled on the way, and parted."</p>

  <p>"You were robbed of nothing?"</p>

  <p>Victor Franklin smiled.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he answered. "I had nothing worth stealing except my
  plans, and they are in my pocket now."</p>

  <p>There was a few moments' intense silence. Dory wheeled suddenly round, and
  looked to where Mr. Vincent Cawdor had been standing.</p>

  <p>"Where is Mr. Cawdor?" he asked, sharply.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman with the grey moustache left a few seconds ago," one of the
  men at the door said. Dory was very pale.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I have to offer you my apologies. I have apparently
  been deceived by some false information. The charge is withdrawn."</p>

  <p>He turned on his heel and left the room. The two policemen followed
  him.</p>

  <p>"Keep them under observation," Dory ordered shortly, "but I am afraid this
  fellow Cawdor has sold me."</p>

  <p>He found a hansom outside, and sprang into it.</p>

  <p>"Number 27, Southampton Row," he ordered.</p>

  <p>Rounceby and his partner were alone in the little smoking room. The former
  was almost inarticulate. The night porter brought them brandy, and both men
  drank.</p>

  <p>"We've got to get to the bottom of this, Marnstam," Mr. Rounceby
  muttered.</p>

  <p>Mr. Marnstam was thinking.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember that sound through the darkness," he said&mdash;"the
  beating of an engine way back on the road?"</p>

  <p>"What of it?" Rounceby demanded.</p>

  <p>"It was a motor bicycle," Marnstam said quietly. "I thought so at the
  time."</p>

  <p>"Supposing some one followed us and pulled him out," Rounceby said,
  hoarsely, "why are we treated like this? I tell you we've been made fools of!
  We've been treated like children&mdash;not even to be punished! We'll have
  the truth somehow out of that devil Cawdor! Come!"</p>

  <p>They made their way to the courtyard and found a cab.</p>

  <p>"Number 27, Southampton Row!" they ordered.</p>

  <p>They reached their destination some time before Dory, whose horse fell
  down in the Strand, and who had to walk. They ascended to the fourth floor of
  the building and rang the bell of Vincent Cawdor's room&mdash;no answer. They
  plied the knocker&mdash;no result. Rounceby peered through the keyhole.</p>

  <p>"He hasn't come home yet," he remarked. "There is no light anywhere in the
  place."</p>

  <p>The door of a flat across the passage was quietly opened. Mr. Peter Ruff,
  in a neat black smoking suit and slippers, and holding a pipe in his hand,
  looked out.</p>

  <p>"Excuse me, gentlemen," he said, "but I do not think that Mr. Cawdor is
  in. He went out early this evening, and I have not heard him return."</p>

  <p>The two men turned away.</p>

  <p>"We are much obliged to you, sir," Mr. Marnstam said.</p>

  <p>"Can I give him any message?" Peter Ruff asked, politely. "We generally
  see something of one another in the morning."</p>

  <p>"You can tell him&mdash;" Rounceby began.</p>

  <p>"No message, thanks!" Marnstam interrupted. "We shall probably run across
  him ourselves to-morrow."</p>

  <p>John Dory was nearly a quarter of an hour late. After his third useless
  summons, Mr. Peter Ruff presented himself again.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "you will not find my neighbour at home. There
  have been several people enquiring for him to-night, without any result."</p>

  <p>John Dory came slowly across the landing.</p>

  <p>"Good evening, Mr. Ruff!" he said.</p>

  <p>"Why, it's Mr. Dory!" Peter Ruff declared. "Come in, do, and have a
  drink."</p>

  <p>John Dory accepted the invitation, and his eyes were busy in that little
  sitting room during the few minutes which it took his host to mix that whisky
  and soda.</p>

  <p>"Nothing wrong with our friend opposite, I hope?" Peter Ruff asked,
  jerking his head across the landing.</p>

  <p>"I hope not, Mr. Ruff," John Dory said. "No doubt in the morning he will
  be able to explain everything. I must say that I should like to see him
  to-night, though."</p>

  <p>"He may turn up yet," Peter Ruff remarked, cheerfully. "He's like
  myself&mdash;a late bird."</p>

  <p>"I fear not," Dory answered, drily. "Nice rooms you have here, sir. Just a
  sitting room and bedroom, eh?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff stood up and threw open the door of the inner apartment.</p>

  <p>"That's so," he answered. "Care to have a look round?"</p>

  <p>The detective did look round, and pretty thoroughly. As soon as he was
  sure that there was no one concealed upon the premises, he drank his whisky
  and soda and went.</p>

  <p>"I'll look in again to see Cawdor," he remarked&mdash;"to-morrow, perhaps,
  or the next day."</p>

  <p>"I'll let him know if I see him about," Peter Ruff declared. "Sorry the
  lift's stopped. Three steps to the left and straight on. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>Miss Brown arrived early the following morning, and was disposed to be
  inquisitive.</p>

  <p>"I should like to know," she said, "exactly what has become of Mr. Vincent
  Cawdor."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff took her upstairs. There was a little mound of ashes in the
  grate.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I imagined that," she said. "But why did you send me out to watch
  yourself?"</p>

  <p>"My dear Violet," Peter Ruff answered, "there is no man in the world
  to-day who is my equal in the art of disguising himself. At the same time, I
  wanted to know whether I could deceive you. I wanted to be quite sure that my
  study of Mr. Vincent Cawdor was a safe one. I took those rooms in his name
  and in his own person. I do not think that it occurred even to our friend
  John Dory to connect us in his mind."</p>

  <p>"Very well," she went on. "Now tell me, please, what took you up to
  Westmoreland?"</p>

  <p>"I followed Rounceby and Marnstam," he answered, "I knew them when I was
  abroad, studying crime&mdash;I could tell you a good deal about both those
  men if it were worth while&mdash;and I knew, when they hired a big motor car
  and engaged a crook to drive it, that they were worth following. I saw the
  trial of the flying machine, and when they started off with young Franklin, I
  followed on a motor bicycle. I fished him out of the tarn where they left him
  for dead, brought him on to London, and made my own terms with him."</p>

  <p>"What about the body which was found in the Longthorp Tarn?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>"I had that telegram sent myself," Peter Ruff answered.</p>

  <p>She looked at him severely.</p>

  <p>"You went out of your way to make a fool of John Dory!" she said, frowning
  at him.</p>

  <p>"That I admit," he answered.</p>

  <p>"It seems to me," she continued, "that that, after all, has been the chief
  object of the whole affair. I do not see that we&mdash;that is the
  firm&mdash;profit in the least."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff chuckled.</p>

  <p>"We've got a fourth share in the Franklin Flying Machine," he answered,
  "and I'm hanged if I'd sell it for a hundred thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>"You've taken advantage of that young man's gratitude," she declared.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I earned the money," he answered.</p>

  <h2>IV. THE INDISCRETION OF LETTY SHAW</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Dec 1909</h3>

  <p class="first">Amidst a storm of whispered criticisms, the general opinion
  was that Letty Shaw was a silly little fool who ought to have known better.
  When she had entered the restaurant a few minutes before midnight, followed
  by Austen Abbott, every one looked to see a third person following them. No
  third person, however, appeared. Gustav himself conducted them to a small
  table laid for two, covered with pink roses, and handed his fair client the
  menu of a specially ordered supper. There was no gainsaying the fact that
  Letty and her escort proposed supping alone!</p>

  <p>The Cafe at the Milan was, without doubt, the fashionable rendezvous of
  the moment for those ladies connected with the stage who, after their
  performance, had not the time or the inclination to make the conventional
  toilet demanded by the larger restaurants. Letty Shaw, being one of the
  principal ornaments of the musical comedy stage, was well known to every one
  in the room. There was scarcely a person there who within the last fortnight
  had not found an opportunity of congratulating her upon her engagement to
  Captain the Honourable Brian Sotherst. Sotherst was rich, and one of the most
  popular young men about town. Letty Shaw, although she had had one or two
  harmless flirtations, was well known as a self-respecting and hard-working
  young actress who loved her work, and against whom no one had ever had a word
  to say. Consequently, the shock was all the greater when, within a fortnight
  of her engagement, she was thus to be seen openly supping alone with the most
  notorious woman hunter about town&mdash;a man of bad reputation, a man, too,
  towards whom Sotherst was known to have a special aversion. Nothing but a
  break with Sotherst or a fit of temporary insanity seemed to explain, even
  inadequately, the situation.</p>

  <p>Her best friend&mdash;the friend who knew her and believed in
  her&mdash;rose to her feet and came sailing down the room. She nodded gaily
  to Abbott, whom she hated, and whom she had not recognized for years, and
  laid her hand upon Letty's arm.</p>

  <p>"Where's Brian?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Letty shrugged her shoulders&mdash;it was not altogether a natural
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"On duty to-night," she answered.</p>

  <p>Her best friend paused for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Come over and join our party, both of you," she said. "Dicky Pennell's
  here and Gracie Marsh&mdash;just landed. They'd love to meet you."</p>

  <p>Letty shook her head slowly. There was a look in her face which even her
  best friend did not understand.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid that we can't do that," she said. "I am Mr. Abbott's
  guest."</p>

  <p>"And to-night," Austen Abbott intervened, looking up at the woman who
  stood between them, "I am not disposed to share Miss Shaw with anybody."</p>

  <p>Her best friend could do no more than shake her head and go away. The two
  were left alone for the rest of the evening. When they departed together,
  people who knew felt that a whiff of tragedy had passed through the room.
  Nobody understood&mdash;or pretended to understand. Even before her
  engagement, Letty had never been known to sup alone with a man. That she
  should do so now, and with this particular man, was preposterous!</p>

  <p>"Something will come of it," her best friend murmured, sadly, as she
  watched Austen Abbott help his companion on with her cloak.</p>

  <p>Something did!</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff rose at his accustomed time the following morning, and attired
  himself, if possible, with more than his usual care. He wore the grey suit
  which he had carefully put out the night before, but he hesitated long
  between the rival appeals of a red tie with white spots and a plain mauve
  one. He finally chose the latter, finding that it harmonised more
  satisfactorily with his socks, and after a final survey of himself in the
  looking-glass, he entered the next room, where his coffee was set out upon a
  small round table near the fire, together with his letters and
  newspapers.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was, after all, like the rest of us, a creature of habit. He
  made an invariable rule of glancing through the newspapers before he paid any
  regard at all to his letters or his breakfast. In the absence of anything of
  a particularly sensational character, he then opened his letters in leisurely
  fashion, and went back afterwards to the newspaper as he finished his meal.
  This morning, however, both his breakfast and letters remained for some time
  untouched. The first paragraph which caught his eye as he shook open the
  Daily Telegraph was sufficiently absorbing. There it was in great black
  type:</p>
  <pre>
      TERRIBLE TRAGEDY IN THE FLAT OF A WELL-KNOWN ACTRESS!
                   AUSTEN ABBOTT SHOT DEAD!
                  ARREST OF CAPTAIN SOTHERST
</pre>

  <p>Beyond the inevitable shock which is always associated with the taking of
  life, and the unusual position of the people concerned in it, there was
  little in the brief account of the incident to excite the imagination. A
  policeman on the pavement outside the flat in which Miss Shaw and her mother
  lived fancied that he heard, about two o'clock in the morning, the report of
  a revolver shot. As nothing further transpired, and as the sound was very
  indistinct, he did not at once enter the building, but kept it, so far as
  possible, under observation. About twenty minutes later, a young gentleman in
  evening dress came out into the street, and the policeman noticed at once
  that he was carrying a small revolver, which he attempted to conceal. The
  constable thereupon whistled for his sergeant, and accompanied by the young
  gentleman&mdash;who made no effort to escape&mdash;ascended to Miss Shaw's
  rooms, where the body of Austen Abbott was discovered lying upon the
  threshold of the sitting room with a small bullet mark through the forehead.
  The inmates of the house were aroused and a doctor sent for. The deceased man
  was identified as Austen Abbott&mdash;a well-known actor&mdash;and the man
  under arrest gave his name at once as Captain the Honourable Brian Sotherst.
  Peter Ruff sighed as he laid down the paper. The case seemed to him perfectly
  clear, and his sympathies were altogether with the young officer who had
  taken the law into his own hands. He knew nothing of Miss Letty Shaw, and,
  consequently, did her, perhaps, less than justice in his thoughts. Of Austen
  Abbott, on the other hand, he knew a great deal&mdash;and nothing of good. It
  was absurd, after all, that any one should be punished for killing such a
  brute!</p>

  <p>He descended, a few minutes later, to his office, and found Miss Brown
  busy arranging a bowl of violets upon his desk.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it horrible?" she cried, as he entered, carrying a bundle of papers
  under his arm. "I never have had such a shock!"</p>

  <p>"Do you know any of them, then?" Peter Ruff asked, straightening his tie
  in the mirror.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" she answered. "Why, I was in the same company as Letty Shaw
  for a year. I was at the Milan, too, last night. Letty was there having
  supper alone with Austen Abbott. We all said that there'd be trouble, but of
  course we never dreamed of this! Isn't there any chance for him, Peter? Can't
  he get off?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid not," he answered. "They may be able to bring evidence of a
  quarrel and reduce it to manslaughter, but what you've just told me about
  this supper party makes it all the worse. It will come out in the evidence,
  of course."</p>

  <p>"Captain Sotherst is such a dear," Miss Brown declared, "and so
  good-looking! And as for that brute Austen Abbott, he ought to have been shot
  long ago!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff seated himself before his desk and hitched up his trousers at
  the knees.</p>

  <p>"No doubt you are right, Violet," he said, "but people go about these
  things so foolishly. To me it is simply exasperating to reflect how little
  use is made of persons such as myself, whose profession in life it is to
  arrange these little matters. Take the present case, for example. Captain
  Sotherst had only to lay these facts before me, and Austen Abbott was a
  ruined man. I could have arranged the affair for him in half-a-dozen
  different ways. Whereas now it must be a life for a life&mdash;the life of an
  honest young English gentleman for that of a creature who should have been
  kicked out of the world as vermin!... I have some letters give you, Violet,
  if you please."</p>

  <p>She swung round in her chair reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"I can't help thinking of that poor young fellow," she said, with a
  sigh.</p>

  <p>"Sentiment after office hours, if you please!" said Peter.</p>

  <p>Then there came a knock at the door.</p>

  <p>His visitor lifted her veil, and Peter Ruff recognized her
  immediately.</p>

  <p>"What can I do for you, Lady Mary?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She saw the recognition in his eyes even before he spoke, and wondered at
  it.</p>

  <p>"You know me?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I know most people," he answered, drily; "it is part of my
  profession."</p>

  <p>"Tell me&mdash;you are Mr. Peter Ruff," she said, "the famous specialist
  in the detection of crime? You know that Brian Sotherst is my brother?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I know it! I am sorry&mdash;very sorry, indeed."</p>

  <p>He handed her a chair. She seated herself with a little tightening of the
  lips.</p>

  <p>"I want more than sympathy from you, Mr. Ruff," she warned him. "I want
  your help."</p>

  <p>"It is my profession," he admitted, "but your brother's case makes
  intervention difficult, does it not?"</p>

  <p>"You mean&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>"Your brother himself does not deny his guilt, I understand."</p>

  <p>"He has not denied it," she answered&mdash;"very likely he will not do so
  before the magistrate&mdash;but neither has he admitted it. Mr. Ruff, you are
  such a clever man. Can't you see the truth?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff looked at her steadily for several moments.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary," he said, "I can see what you are going to suggest. You are
  going on the assumption that Austen Abbott was shot by Letty Shaw and that
  your brother is taking the thing on his shoulders."</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it!" she declared. "The girl did it herself, beyond a doubt.
  Brian would never have shot any one. He might have horsewhipped him,
  perhaps&mdash;even beaten him to death&mdash;but shot him in cold
  blood&mdash;never!"</p>

  <p>"The provocation&mdash;" Ruff began.</p>

  <p>"There was no provocation," she interrupted. "He was engaged to the girl,
  and of course we hated it, but she was an honest little thing, and devoted to
  him."</p>

  <p>"Doubtless," Ruff admitted. "But all the same, as you will hear before the
  magistrates, or at the inquest, she was having supper alone with Austen
  Abbott that night at the Milan."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary's eyes flashed.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it!" she declared.</p>

  <p>"It is nevertheless true," Peter Ruff assured her. "There is no shadow of
  doubt about it."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary was staggered. For a few moment she seemed struggling to
  rearrange her thoughts.</p>

  <p>"You see," Ruff continued, "the fact that Miss Shaw was willing to sup
  with Austen Abbott tete-a-tete renders it more improbable that she should
  shoot him in her sitting room, an hour or so later, and then go calmly up to
  her mother's room as though nothing had happened."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary had lost some of her confidence, but she was not daunted.</p>

  <p>"Even if we have been deceived in the girl," she said,
  thoughtfully&mdash;"even if she were disposed to flirt with other
  men&mdash;even then there might be a stronger motive than ever for her
  wishing to get rid of Abbott. He may have become jealous, and threatened
  her."</p>

  <p>"It is, of course, possible," Ruff assented, politely. "Your theory would,
  at any rate, account for your brother's present attitude."</p>

  <p>She looked at him steadfastly.</p>

  <p>"You believe, then," she said, "that my brother shot Austen Abbott?"</p>

  <p>"I do," he admitted frankly. "So does every man or woman of common sense
  in London. On the facts as they are stated in the newspapers, with the
  addition of which I have told you, no other conclusion is possible."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary rose.</p>

  <p>"Then I may as well go," she said tearfully.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Peter Ruff declared. "Listen. This is a matter of business
  with me. I say that on the facts as they are known, your brother's guilt
  appears indubitable. I do not say that there may not be other facts in the
  background which alter the state of affairs. If you wish me to search for
  them, engage me, and I will do my best."</p>

  <p>"Isn't that what I am here for?" the girl exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Very well," Peter Ruff said. "My services are at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"You will do your best&mdash;more than your best, won't you?" she begged.
  "Remember that he is my brother&mdash;my favourite brother!"</p>

  <p>"I will do what can be done," Peter Ruff promised. "Please sit down at
  that desk and write me two letters of introduction."</p>

  <p>She drew off her gloves and prepared to obey him.</p>

  <p>"To whom?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"To the solicitors who are defending your brother," he said, "and to Miss
  Letty Shaw."</p>

  <p>"You mean to go and see her?" Lady Mary asked, doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Peter Ruff answered. "If your supposition is correct, she
  might easily give herself away under a little subtle cross-examination. It is
  my business to know how to ask people questions in such a way that if they do
  not speak the truth their words give some indication of it. If she is
  innocent I shall know that I have to make my effort in another
  direction."</p>

  <p>"What other direction can there be?" Lady Mary asked dismally.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff said nothing. He was too kind-hearted to kindle false
  hopes.</p>

  <p>"It's a hopeless case, of course," Miss Brown remarked, after Lady Mary
  had departed.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so," Peter Ruff answered. "Still I must earn my money. Please
  get some one to take you to supper to-night at the Milan, and see if you can
  pick up any scandal."</p>

  <p>"About Letty?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"About either of them," he answered. "Particularly I should like to know
  if any explanation has cropped up of her supping alone with Austen
  Abbott."</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you can't take me yourself," she remarked. "You are on
  the side of the law this time, at any rate."</p>

  <p>"I will," he answered, after a moment's hesitation. "I will call for you
  at eleven o'clock to-night."</p>

  <p>He rose and closed his desk emphatically.</p>

  <p>"You are going out?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am going to see Miss Letty Shaw," he answered.</p>

  <p>He took a taxicab to the flats, and found a handful of curious people
  still gazing up at the third floor. The parlourmaid who answered his summons
  was absolutely certain that Miss Shaw would not see him. He persuaded her,
  after some difficulty, to take in his letter while he waited in the hall.
  When she returned, she showed him into a small sitting room and pulled down
  the blinds.</p>

  <p>"Miss Shaw will see you, sir, for a few minutes," she announced, in a
  subdued tone. "Poor dear young lady," she continued, "she has been crying her
  eyes out all the morning."</p>

  <p>"No wonder," Peter Ruff said, sympathetically. "It's a terrible business,
  this!"</p>

  <p>"One of the nicest young men as ever walked," the girl declared, firmly.
  "As for that brute, he deserved all he's got, and more!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was left alone for nearly a quarter of an hour. Then the door
  was softly opened and Letty Shaw entered. There was no doubt whatever about
  her suffering. Ruff, who had seen her only lately at the theatre, was
  shocked. Under her eyes were blacker lines than her pencil had ever traced.
  Not only was she ghastly pale, but her face seemed wan and shrunken. She
  spoke to him the moment she entered, leaning with on hand upon the
  sideboard.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary writes that you want to help us," she said. "How can you? How
  is it possible?"</p>

  <p>Even her voice had gone. She spoke hoarsely, and as though short of
  breath. Her eyes searched his face feverishly. It seemed cruelty not to
  answer her at once, and Peter Ruff was not a cruel man. Nevertheless, he
  remained silent, and it seemed to her that his eyes were like points of fire
  upon her face.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" she cried, with breaking voice. "What have you come
  for? Why don't you speak to me?"</p>

  <p>"Madam," Peter Ruff said, "I should like to help you, and I will do what I
  can. But in order that I may do so, it is necessary that you should answer me
  two questions&mdash;truthfully!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes grew wider. It was the face of a terrified child.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she exclaimed. "What have I to conceal?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff's expression never changed. There was nothing about him, as he
  stood there with his hands behind him, his head thrown a little forward, in
  the least inspiring&mdash;nothing calculated to terrify the most timid
  person. Yet the girl looked at him with the eyes of a frightened bird.</p>

  <p>"Remember, then," he continued, smoothly, "that what you say to me is
  sacred. You and I are alone without witnesses or eavesdroppers. Was it Brian
  Sotherst who shot Abbott&mdash;or was it you?"</p>

  <p>She gave a little cry. Her hands clasped the sides of her head in
  horror.</p>

  <p>"I!" she exclaimed, "I! God help me!"</p>

  <p>He waited. In a moment she looked up.</p>

  <p>"You cannot believe that," she said, with a calmness for which he was
  scarcely prepared. "It is absurd. I left the room by the inner door as he
  took up his hat to step out into the hall."</p>

  <p>"Incidentally," he asked&mdash;"this is not my other question,
  mind&mdash;why did you not let him out yourself?"</p>

  <p>"We had disagreed," she answered, curtly.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff bent his head in assent.</p>

  <p>"I see," he remarked. "You had disagreed. Abbott probably hoped that you
  would relent, so he waited for a few minutes. Brian Sotherst, who had escaped
  from his engagement in time, he thought, to come and wish you good night,
  must have walked in and found him there. By the bye, how would Captain
  Sotherst get in?"</p>

  <p>"He had a key," the girl answered. "My mother lives here with me, and we
  have only one maid. It was more convenient. I gave him one washed in gold for
  a birthday present only a few days ago."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Peter Ruff said. "The revolver, I understand, was your
  property?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was a present from Brian," she said. "He gave it to me in a joke, and
  I had it on the table with some other curiosities."</p>

  <p>"The first question," Peter Ruff said, "is disposed of. May I proceed to
  the second?"</p>

  <p>The girl moistened her lips.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" she answered.</p>

  <p>"Why did you sup alone with Austen Abbott last night?"</p>

  <p>She shrank a little away.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You have been on the stage, my dear Miss Shaw," Peter Ruff continued,
  "for between four and five years. During the whole of that time, it has been
  your very wise habit to join supper parties, of course, when the company was
  agreeable to you, but to sup alone with no man! Am I not right?"</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a great deal about me," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Am I not right?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>"Yes!"</p>

  <p>"You break your rule for the first time," Peter Ruff continued, "in favour
  of a man of notoriously bad character, a few weeks after the announcement of
  your engagement to an honourable young English gentleman. You know very well
  the construction likely to be put upon your behaviour&mdash;you, of all
  people, would be the most likely to appreciate the risk you ran. Why did you
  run it? In other words, I repeat my question. Why did you sup alone with
  Austen Abbott last night?"</p>

  <p>All this time she had been standing. She came a little forward now, and
  threw herself into an easy-chair.</p>

  <p>"It doesn't help!" she exclaimed. "All this doesn't help!"</p>

  <p>"Nor can I help you, then," Peter Ruff said, stretching out his hand for
  his hat.</p>

  <p>She waved to him to put it down.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," she said. "It has nothing to do with the case, but
  since you ask, you shall know. There is a dear little girl in our
  company&mdash;Fluffy Dean we all call her&mdash;only eighteen years old. We
  all love her, she is so sweet, and just like I was when I first went on the
  stage, only much nicer. She is very pretty, she has no money, and she is such
  an affectionate little dear that although she is as good as gold, we are all
  terrified for her sake whenever she makes acquaintances. Several of us who
  are most interested made a sort of covenant. We all took it in turns to look
  after her, and try to see that she did not meet any one she shouldn't. Yet,
  for all our precautions, Austen Abbott got hold of her and turned her silly
  little head. He was a man of experience, and she was only a child. She
  wouldn't listen to us&mdash;she wouldn't hear a word against him. I took what
  seemed to me to be the only chance. I went to him myself&mdash;I begged for
  mercy, I begged him to spare the child. I swore that if&mdash;anything
  happened to her, I would start a crusade against him, I would pledge my word
  that he should be cut by every decent man and woman on the stage! He listened
  to what I had to say and at first he only smiled. When I had finished, he
  made me an offer. He said that if I would sup with him alone at the Milan,
  and permit him to escort me home afterwards, he would spare the child. One
  further condition he made&mdash;that I was to tell no one why I did it. It
  was the man's brutal vanity! I made the promise, but I break it now. You have
  asked me and I have told you. I went through with the supper, although I
  hated it. I let him come in for a drink as though he had been a friend. Then
  he tried to make love to me. I took the opportunity of telling him exactly
  what I thought of him. Then I showed him the door, and left him.
  Afterwards&mdash;afterwards&mdash;Brian came in! They must have met upon the
  very threshold!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"Thank you!" he said.</p>

  <p>"You see," she continued, drearily, "that it all has very little to do
  with the case. I meant to keep it to myself, because, of course, apart from
  anything else, apart from Brian's meeting him coming out of my rooms, it
  supplies an additional cause for anger on Brian's part."</p>

  <p>"I see," he answered. "I am much obliged to you, Miss Shaw. Believe me
  that you have my sincere sympathy!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff's farewell words were unheard. Letty had fallen forward in her
  chair, her head buried in her hands.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff went to Berkeley Square and found Lady Mary waiting for him.
  Sir William Trencham, the great solicitor, was with her. Lady Mary introduced
  the two men. All the time she was anxiously watching Ruff's face.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ruff has been to see Miss Shaw," she explained to Sir William. "Mr.
  Ruff, tell me quickly," she continued, with her hand upon his shoulder, "did
  she say anything? Did you find anything out?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No!" he said. "I found nothing out!"</p>

  <p>"You don't think, then," Lady Mary gasped, "that there is any
  chance&mdash;of getting her to confess&mdash;that she did it herself?"</p>

  <p>"Why should she have done it herself?" Peter Ruff asked. "She admits that
  the man tried to make love to her. She simply left him. She was in her own
  home, with her mother and servant within call. There was no struggle in the
  room&mdash;we know that. There was no necessity for any."</p>

  <p>"Have you made any other enquiries?" Lady Mary asked.</p>

  <p>"The few which I have made," Peter Ruff answered gravely, "point all in
  the same direction. I ascertained at the Milan that your brother called there
  late last night, and that he heard Miss Shaw had been supping alone with
  Austen Abbott. He followed them home. I have ascertained, too, that he had a
  key to Miss Shaw's flat. He apparently met Austen Abbott upon the
  threshold."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary covered her face with her hands. She seemed to read in Ruff's
  words the verdict of the two men&mdash;the verdict of common sense.
  Nevertheless, he made one more request before leaving.</p>

  <p>"I should like to see Captain Sotherst, if you can get me an order," he
  said to Sir William.</p>

  <p>"You can go with me to-morrow morning," the lawyer answered. "The
  proceedings this morning, of course, were simply formal. Until after the
  inquest it will be easy to arrange an interview."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"There is still something in your mind, then?" she asked. "You think that
  there is a bare chance?"</p>

  <p>"There is always the hundredth chance!" Peter Ruff replied.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff and Miss Brown supped at the Milan that night as they had
  arranged, but it was not a cheerful evening. Brian Sotherst had been very
  popular among Letty Shaw's little circle of friends, and the general feeling
  was one of horror and consternation at this thing which had befallen him.
  Austen Abbot, too, was known to all of them, and although a good many of the
  men&mdash;and even the women&mdash;were outspoken enough to declare at once
  that it served him right, nevertheless, the shock of death&mdash;death
  without a second's warning&mdash;had a paralysing effect even upon those who
  were his severest critics. Violet Brown spoke to a few of her
  friends&mdash;introduced Peter Ruff here and there&mdash;but nothing was said
  which could throw in any way even the glimmerings of a new light upon the
  tragedy. It all seemed too hopelessly and fatally obvious.</p>

  <p>About twenty minutes before closing time, the habitues of the place were
  provided with something in the nature of a sensation. A little party entered
  who seemed altogether free from the general air of gloom. Foremost among them
  was a very young and exceedingly pretty girl, with light golden hair waved in
  front of her forehead, deep blue eyes, and the slight, airy figure of a
  child. She was accompanied by another young woman, whose appearance was a
  little too obvious to be prepossessing, and three or four young
  men&mdash;dark, clean-shaven, dressed with the irritating exactness of their
  class&mdash;young stockbrokers or boys about town. Miss Brown's eyes grew
  very wide open.</p>

  <p>"What a little beast!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Who?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"That pretty girl there," she answered&mdash;"Fluffy Dean her name is. She
  is Letty Shaw's protege, and she wouldn't have dreamed of allowing her to
  come out with a crowd like that. Tonight, of all nights," she continued,
  indignantly, "when Letty is away!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was interested.</p>

  <p>"So that is Miss Fluffy Dean," he remarked, looking at her curiously. "She
  seems a little excited."</p>

  <p>"She's a horrid little wretch!" Miss Brown declared. "I hope that some one
  will tell Letty, and that she will drop her now. A girl who would do such a
  thing as that when Letty is in such trouble isn't worth taking care of! Just
  listen to them all!"</p>

  <p>They were certainly becoming a little boisterous. A magnum of champagne
  was being opened. Fluffy Dean's cheeks were already flushed, and her eyes
  glittering. Every one at the table was talking a great deal and drinking
  toasts.</p>

  <p>"This is the end of Fluffy Dean," Violet Brown said, severely. "I hate to
  be uncharitable, but it serves her right."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff paid his bill.</p>

  <p>"Let us go," he said.</p>

  <p>In the taxicab, on their way back to Miss Brown's rooms, Ruff was
  unusually silent, but just before he said good night to her&mdash;on the
  pavement, in fact, outside her front door&mdash;he asked a question.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "would you like to play detective for an hour or
  two?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him in some surprise.</p>

  <p>"You know I always like to help in anything that's going," she said.</p>

  <p>"Letty Shaw was an Australian, wasn't she?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"She was born there, and lived there till she was nearly eighteen&mdash;is
  that true?" he asked again.</p>

  <p>"Quite true," Miss Brown answered.</p>

  <p>"You know the offices of the P.&amp; O. line of steamers in Pall Mall?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Get a sailing list to Australia&mdash;there should be a boat going
  Thursday. Present yourself as a prospective passenger. See how many young
  women alone there are going out, and ask their names. Incidentally put in a
  little spare time watching the office."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with parted lips and wide-open eyes.</p>

  <p>"Do you think&mdash;" she began.</p>

  <p>He shook her hand warmly and stepped back into the taxicab.</p>

  <p>"Good night!" he said. "No questions, please. I sha'n't expect you at the
  office at the usual time to-morrow, at any rate. Telephone or run around if
  you've anything to tell me."</p>

  <p>The taxicab disappeared round the corner of the street. Miss Brown was
  standing still upon the pavement with the latchkey in her hand.</p>
  <hr>

  <p>It was afternoon before the inquest on the body of Austen Abbott, and
  there was gathered together in Letty Shaw's parlor a curiously assorted
  little group of people. There was Miss Shaw herself&mdash;or rather what
  seemed to be the ghost of herself&mdash;and her mother; Lady Mary and Sir
  William Trencham; Peter Ruff and Violet Brown&mdash;and Mr. John Dory. The
  eyes of all of them were fixed upon Peter Ruff, who was the latest arrival.
  He stood in the middle of the room, calmly taking off his gloves, and
  glancing complacently down at his well-creased trousers.</p>

  <p>"Lady Mary," he said, "and Miss Shaw, I know that you are both anxious for
  me to explain why I ask you to meet me here this afternoon, and why I also
  requested my friend Mr. Dory from Scotland Yard, who has charge of the case
  against Captain Sotherst, to be present. I will tell you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dory nodded, a little impatiently.</p>

  <p>"Unless you have something very definite to say," he remarked, "I think it
  would be as well to postpone any general discussion of this matter until
  after the inquest. I must warn you that so far as I, personally, am
  concerned, I must absolutely decline to allude to the subject at all. It
  would be most unprofessional."</p>

  <p>"I have something definite to say," Peter Ruff declared, mildly.</p>

  <p>Lady Mary's eyes flashed with hope&mdash;Letty Shaw leaned forward in her
  chair with white, drawn face.</p>

  <p>"Let it be understood," Peter Ruff said, with a slight note of gravity
  creeping into his tone, "that I am here solely as the agent of Lady Mary
  Sotherst. I am paid and employed by her. My sole object is on her behalf,
  therefore, to discover proof of the innocence of Captain Sotherst. I take it,
  however," he added, turning towards the drooping figure in the easy-chair,
  "that Miss Shaw is as anxious to have the truth known."</p>

  <p>"Of course! Of course!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"In France," Peter Ruff continued, "there is a somewhat curious custom,
  which, despite a certain theatricality, yet has its points. The scene of a
  crime is visited, and its events, so far as may be, reconstructed. Let us
  suppose for a moment that we are now engaged upon something of the sort."</p>

  <p>Letty Shaw shrank back in her chair. Her thin white fingers were gripping
  its sides. Her eyes seemed to look upon terrible things.</p>

  <p>"It is too&mdash;awful!" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"Madam," Peter Ruff said, firmly, "we seek the truth. Be so good as to
  humour me in this. Dory, will you go to the front door, stand upon the
  mat&mdash;so? You are Captain Sotherst&mdash;you have just entered. I am
  Austen Abbott. You, Miss Shaw, have just ordered me from the room. You see, I
  move toward the door. I open it&mdash;so. Miss Shaw," he added, turning
  swiftly towards her, "once more will you assure me that every one who was in
  the flat that night, with the exception of your domestic servant, is present
  now?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Good! Then who," he asked, suddenly pointing to a door on the
  left&mdash;"who is in that room?"</p>

  <p>They had all crowded after him to the threshold&mdash;thronging around him
  as he stood face to face with John Dory. His finger never wavered&mdash;it
  was pointing steadily towards that closed door a few feet to the left.
  Suddenly Letty Shaw rushed past them with a loud shriek.</p>

  <p>"You shall not go in!" she cried. "What business is it of his?"</p>

  <p>She stood with her back to the door, her arms outstretched like a cross.
  Her cheeks were livid. Her eyes seemed starting from her head.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff and John Dory laid their hands upon the girl's wrists. She
  clung to her place frantically. She was dragged from it, screaming. Peter
  Ruff, as was his right, entered first. Almost immediately he turned round,
  and his face was very grave.</p>

  <p>"Something has happened in here, I am afraid," he said. "Please come in
  quietly."</p>

  <p>On the bed lay Fluffy Dean, fully dressed&mdash;motionless. One hand hung
  down toward the floor&mdash;from the lifeless fingers a little phial had
  slipped. The room was full of trunks addressed to&mdash;</p>

  <p class="sign">MISS SMITH,<br>
  Passenger to Melborne.<br>
  S.S. Caroline.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff moved over toward the bed and took up a piece of paper, upon
  which were scribbled a few lines in pencil.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that I must read these aloud. You all have a right to
  hear them."</p>

  <p>No one spoke. He continued:</p>

  <p class="letter">"Forgive me, Letty, but I cannot go to Australia. They
  would only bring me back. When I remember that awful moment, my brain
  burns&mdash;I feel that I am going mad! Some day I should do
  this&mdash;better now. Give my love to the girls.&mdash; FLUFFY.</p>

  <p>They sent for a doctor, and John Dory rang up Scotland Yard. Letty Shaw
  had fainted, and had been carried to her room. While they waited about in
  strange, half-benumbed excitement, Peter Ruff once more spoke to them.</p>

  <p>"The reconstruction is easy enough now," he remarked. "The partition
  between this sitting room and that little bedroom is only an artificial
  one&mdash;something almost as flimsy as a screen. You see," he continued,
  tapping with his knuckles, "you can almost put your hand through it. If you
  look a little lower down, you will see where an opening has been made. Fluffy
  Dean was being taken care of by Miss Shaw&mdash;staying with her here, even.
  Miss Dean hears her lover's voice in this room&mdash;hears him pleading with
  Miss Shaw on he night of the murder. She has been sent home early from the
  theatre, and it is just possible that she saw or had been told that Austen
  Abbott had fetched Miss Shaw after the performance and had taken her to
  supper. She was mad with anger and jealousy. The revolver was there upon the
  table, with a silver box of cartridges. She possessed herself of it and
  waited in her room. What she heard proved, at least, her lover's infidelity.
  She stood there at her door, waiting. When Austen Abbott comes out, she
  shoots, throws the revolver at him, closes her door, and goes off into a
  faint. Perhaps she hears footsteps&mdash;a key in the door. At any rate,
  Captain Sotherst arrives a few minutes later. He finds, half in the hall,
  half on the threshold of the sitting room, Austen Abbott dead, and Miss
  Shaw's revolver by the side of him. If he had been a wise young man, he would
  have aroused the household. Why he did not do so, we can perhaps guess. He
  put two and two together a little too quickly. It is certain that he believed
  that the dead man had been shot by his fiancee. His first thought was to get
  rid of the revolver. At any rate, he walked down to the street with it in his
  hand, and was promptly arrested by the policeman who had heard the shot.
  Naturally he refused to plead, because he believed that Miss Shaw had killed
  the man, probably in self-defence. She, at first, believed her lover guilty,
  and when afterwards Fluffy Dean confessed, she, with feminine lack of common
  sense, was trying to get the girl out of the country before telling the
  truth. A visit of hers to the office of the steamship company gave me the
  clue I required."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary grasped both his hands.</p>

  <p>"And Scotland Yard," she exclaimed, with a withering glance at Dory, "have
  done their best to hang my brother!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Dear Lady Mary," he said, "remember that it is the business of Scotland
  Yard to find a man guilty. It is mine, when I am employed for that purpose,
  to find him innocent. You must not be too hard upon my friend Mr. Dory. He
  and I seem to come up against each other a little too often, as it is."</p>

  <p>"A little too often!" John Dory repeated, softly. "But one cannot tell.
  Don't believe, Lady Mary," he added, "that we ever want to kill an innocent
  man."</p>

  <p>"It is your profession, though," she answered, "to find
  criminals&mdash;and his," she added, touching Peter Ruff on the shoulder, "to
  look for the truth."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff bowed low&mdash;the compliment pleased him.</p>

  <h2>V. DELILAH FROM STREATHAM</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Jan 1910</h3>

  <p class="first">It was a favourite theory with Peter Ruff that the morning
  papers received very insufficient consideration from the majority of the
  British public. A glance at the headlines and a few of the spiciest
  paragraphs, a vague look at the leading article, and the sheets were thrown
  away to make room for more interesting literature. It was not so with Peter
  Ruff. Novels he very seldom read&mdash;he did not, in fact, appreciate the
  necessity for their existence. The whole epitome of modern life was, he
  argued, to be found among the columns of the daily press. The police news,
  perhaps, was his favourite study, but he did not neglect the advertisements.
  It followed, therefore, as a matter of course, that the appeal of "M" in the
  personal column of the Daily Mail was read by him on the morning of its
  appearance&mdash;read not once only nor twice&mdash;it was a paragraph which
  had its own peculiar interest for him.</p>

  <p>Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, if still in England, is requested to communicate
  with "M," at Vagali's Library, Cook's Alley, Ledham Street, Soho.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff laid the paper down upon his desk and looked steadily at a box
  of India-rubber bands. Almost his fingers, as he parted with the newspaper,
  had seemed to be shaking. His eyes were certainly set in an unusually
  retrospective stare. Who was this who sought to probe his past, to renew an
  acquaintance with a dead personality? "M" could be but one person! What did
  she want of him? Was it possible that, after all, a little flame of sentiment
  had been kept alight in her bosom, too&mdash;that in the quiet moments her
  thoughts had turned towards him as his had so often done to her? Then a
  sudden idea&mdash;an ugly thought&mdash;drove the tenderness from his face.
  She was no longer Maud Barnes&mdash;she was Mrs. John Dory, and John Dory was
  his enemy! Could there be treachery lurking beneath those simple lines?
  Things had not gone well with John Dory lately. Somehow or other, his cases
  seemed to have crumpled into dust. He was no longer held in the same esteem
  at headquarters. Yet could even John Dory stoop to such means as these?</p>

  <p>He turned in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Miss Brown," he said, "please take your pencil."</p>

  <p>"I am quite ready, sir," she answered.</p>

  <p>He marked the advertisement with a ring and passed it to her.</p>

  <p>"Reply to that as follows," he said:</p>

  <p class="quote">"DEAR SIR:&mdash; I notice in the <i>Daily Mail</i> of this
  morning that you are enquiring through the 'personal' column for the
  whereabouts of Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald. That gentleman has been a client of
  mine, and I have been in occasional communication with him. If you will
  inform me of the nature of your business, I may, perhaps, be able to put you
  in touch with Mr. Fitzgerald. You will understand, however, that, under the
  circumstances, I shall require proofs of your good faith. Truly yours, PETER
  RUFF."</p>

  <p>Miss Brown glanced through the advertisement and closed her notebook with
  a little snap.</p>

  <p>"Did you say&mdash;'Dear Sir'?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly!" Peter Ruff answered.</p>

  <p>"And you really mean," she continued, with obvious disapproval, "that I am
  to send this?"</p>

  <p>"I do not usually waste my time," Peter Ruff reminded her, mildly, "by
  giving you down communications destined for the waste-paper basket."</p>

  <p>She turned unwillingly to her machine.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Fitzgerald is very much better where he is," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"That depends," he answered.</p>

  <p>She adjusted a sheet of paper into her typewriter.</p>

  <p>"Who do you suppose 'M' is?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"With your assistance," Peter Ruff remarked, a little
  sarcastically&mdash;"with your very kind assistance&mdash;I propose to find
  out!"</p>

  <p>Miss Brown sniffed, and banged at the keys of her typewriter.</p>

  <p>"That coal-dealer's girl from Streatham!" she murmured to herself....</p>

  <p>A few politely worded letters were exchanged. "M" declined to reveal her
  identity, but made an appointment to visit Mr. Ruff at his office. The
  morning she was expected, he wore an entirely new suit of clothes and was
  palpably nervous. Miss Brown, who had arrived a little late, sat with her
  back turned upon him, and ignored even his usual morning greeting. The
  atmosphere of the office was decidedly chilly! Fortunately, the expected
  visitor arrived early.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff rose to receive his former sweetheart with an agitation
  perforce concealed, yet to him poignant indeed. For it was indeed Maud who
  entered the room and came towards him with carefully studied embarrassment
  and half doubtfully extended hand. He did not see the cheap millinery, the
  slightly more developed figure, the passing of that insipid prettiness which
  had once charmed him into the bloom of an over-early maturity. His eyes were
  blinded with that sort of masculine chivalry&mdash;the heritage only of fools
  and very clever men&mdash;which takes no note of such things. It was Miss
  Brown who, from her place in a corner of the room, ran over the cheap
  attractions of this unwelcome visitor with an expression of scornful
  wonder&mdash;who understood the tinsel of her jewellery, the cheap shoddiness
  of her ready-made gown; who appreciated, with merciless judgment, her mincing
  speech, her cheap, flirtatious method.</p>

  <p>Maud, with a diffidence not altogether assumed, had accepted the chair
  which Peter Ruff had placed for her, and sat fidgeting, for a moment, with
  the imitation gold purse which she was carrying.</p>

  <p>"I am sure, Mr. Ruff," she said, looking demurely into her lap, "I ought
  not to have come here. I feel terribly guilty. It's such an uncomfortable
  sort of position, too, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that you find it so," Peter Ruff said. "If there is anything I
  can do&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," she murmured, half raising her eyes to his and
  dropping them again, "but, you see, we are perfect strangers to one another.
  You don't know me at all, do you? And I have only heard of you through the
  newspapers. You might think all sorts of things about my coming here to make
  enquiries about a gentleman."</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," Peter Ruff said, sincerely, "that you need have no
  fears&mdash;no fears at all. Just speak to me quite frankly. Mr. Fitzgerald
  was a friend of yours, was he not?"</p>

  <p>Maud simpered.</p>

  <p>"He was more than that," she answered, looking down. "We were engaged to
  be married."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed.</p>

  <p>"I knew all about it," he declared. "Fitzgerald used to tell me
  everything."</p>

  <p>"You were his friend?" she asked, looking him in the face.</p>

  <p>"I was," Peter Ruff answered fervently, "his best friend! No one was more
  grieved than I about that&mdash;little mistake."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"In some ways," she remarked softly, "you remind me of him."</p>

  <p>"You could scarcely say anything," Peter Ruff murmured "which would give
  me more pleasure. I am flattered."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It isn't flattery," she said, "it's the truth. You may be a few years
  older, and Spencer had a very nice moustache, which you haven't, but you are
  really not unlike. Mr. Ruff, do tell me where he is!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff coughed.</p>

  <p>"You must remember," he said, "that Mr. Fitzgerald's absence was caused by
  events of a somewhat unfortunate character."</p>

  <p>"I know all about it," she answered, with a little sigh.</p>

  <p>"You can appreciate the fact, therefore," Peter Ruff continued, "that as
  his friend and well-wisher I can scarcely disclose his whereabouts without
  his permission. Will you tell me exactly why you want to meet him again?"</p>

  <p>She blushed&mdash;looked down and up again&mdash;betrayed, in fact, all
  the signs of confusion which might have been expected from her.</p>

  <p>"Must I tell you that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You are married, are you not?" Peter Ruff asked, looking down at her
  wedding ring.</p>

  <p>She bit her lip with vexation. What a fool she had been not to take it
  off!</p>

  <p>"Yes! Well, no&mdash;that is to say&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Never mind," Peter Ruff interrupted. "Please don't think that I want to
  cross-examine you. I only asked these questions because I have a sincere
  regard for Fitzgerald. I know how fond he was of you, and I cannot see what
  there is to be gained, from his point of view, by reopening old wounds."</p>

  <p>"I suppose, then," she remarked, looking at him in such a manner that Miss
  Brown had to cover her mouth with her hands to prevent her screaming
  out&mdash;"I suppose you are one of those who think it a crime for a woman
  who is married even to want to see, for a few moments, an old
  sweetheart?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," Peter Ruff answered, "as a bachelor, I have no
  convictions of any sort upon the subject."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am glad of that," she said.</p>

  <p>"I am to understand, then," Peter Ruff remarked, "that your reason for
  wishing to meet Mr. Fitzgerald again is purely a sentimental one?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it is," she murmured; "I have thought of him so often lately.
  He was such a dear!" she declared, with enthusiasm.</p>

  <p>"I have never been sufficiently thankful," she continued, "that he got
  away that night. At the time, I was very angry, but often since then I have
  wished that I could have passed out with him into the fog and been
  lost&mdash;but I mustn't talk like this! Please don't misunderstand me, Mr.
  Ruff. I am happily married&mdash;quite happily married!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed.</p>

  <p>"My friend Fitzgerald," he remarked, "will be glad to hear that."</p>

  <p>Maud fidgeted. It was not quite the effect she had intended to
  produce!</p>

  <p>"Of course," she remarked, looking away with a pensive air, "one has
  regrets."</p>

  <p>"Regrets!" Peter Ruff murmured.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dory is not well off," she continued, "and I am afraid that I am very
  fond of life and going about, and everything is so expensive nowadays. Then I
  don't like his profession. I think it is hateful to be always trying to catch
  people and put them in prison&mdash;don't you, Mr. Ruff?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff smiled.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," he answered. "Your husband and I work from the opposite poles
  of life. He is always seeking to make criminals of the people whom I am
  always trying to prove worthy members of society."</p>

  <p>"How noble!" Maud exclaimed, clasping her hands and looking up at him. "So
  much more remunerative, too, I should think," she added, after a moment's
  pause.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Peter Ruff admitted. "A private individual will pay more to
  escape from the clutches of the law than the law will to secure its victims.
  Scotland Yard expects them to come into its arms automatically&mdash;regards
  them as a perquisite of its existence."</p>

  <p>"I wish my husband were in your profession, Mr. Ruff," Maud said, with a
  sidelong glance of her blue eyes which she had always found so effective upon
  her various admirers. "I am sure that I should be a great deal fonder of
  him."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff leaned forward in his chair. He, too, had expressive eyes at
  times.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said&mdash;and stopped. But Maud blushed, all the same.</p>

  <p>She looked down into her lap.</p>

  <p>"We are forgetting Mr. Fitzgerald," she murmured.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff glanced up at the clock.</p>

  <p>"It is a long story," he said. "Are you in a hurry, Mrs. Dory?</p>

  <p>"Not at all," she assured him, "unless you want to close you office, or
  anything. It must be nearly one o'clock."</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he asked, "if you would do me the honour of lunching with me?
  We might go to the Prince's or the Carlton&mdash;whichever you prefer. I will
  promise to talk about Mr. Fitzgerald all the time."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I couldn't!" Maud declared, with a little gasp. "At least&mdash;well,
  I'm sure I don't know!"</p>

  <p>"You have no engagement for luncheon?" Peter Ruff asked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no!" she answered; "but, you see, we live so quietly. I have never
  been to one of those places. I'd love to go&mdash;but if we were seen!
  Wouldn't people talk?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff smiled. Just the same dear, modest little thing!</p>

  <p>"I can assure you," he said, "that nothing whatever could be said against
  our lunching together. People are not so strict nowadays, you know, and a
  married lady has always a great deal of latitude."</p>

  <p>She looked up at him with a dazzling smile.</p>

  <p>"I'd simply love to go to Prince's!" she declared.</p>

  <p>"Cat!" Miss Brown murmured, as Peter Ruff and his client left the room
  together.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff returned from his luncheon in no very jubilant state of mind.
  For some time he sat in his easy-chair, with his legs crossed and his finger
  tips pressed close together, looking steadily into space. Contrary to his
  usual custom, he did not smoke. Miss Brown watched him from behind her
  machine.</p>

  <p>"Disenchanted?" she asked calmly.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff did not reply for several moments.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he admitted, hesitatingly, "that marriage with John Dory
  has&mdash;well, not had a beneficial effect. She allowed me, for instance, to
  hold her hand in the cab! Maud would never have permitted a stranger to take
  such a liberty in the old days."</p>

  <p>Miss Brown smiled curiously.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff felt that he was in the confessional.</p>

  <p>"She certainly did seem," he admitted, "to enjoy her champagne a great
  deal, and she talked about her dull life at home a little more, perhaps, than
  was discreet to one who was presumably a stranger. She was curious, too,
  about dining out. Poor little girl, though. Just fancy, John Dory has never
  taken her anywhere but to Lyons' or an A B C, and the pit of a theatre!"</p>

  <p>"Which evening is it to be?" Miss Brown asked.</p>

  <p>"Something was said about Thursday," Peter Ruff admitted.</p>

  <p>"And her husband?" Miss Brown enquired.</p>

  <p>"He happens to be in Glasgow for a few days," Peter Ruff answered.</p>

  <p>Miss Brown looked at her employer steadily. She addressed him by his
  Christian name, which was a thing she very seldom did in office hours.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "are you going to let that woman make a fool of
  you?"</p>

  <p>He raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he said; "say anything you want to&mdash;only, if you please,
  don't speak disrespectfully of Maud."</p>

  <p>"Hasn't it ever occurred to you at all," Miss Brown continued, rising to
  her feet, "that this Maud, or whatever you want to call her, may be playing a
  low-down game of her husband's? He hates you, and he has vague suspicions.
  Can't you see that he is probably making use of your infatuation for his
  common, middle-class little wife, to try and get you to give yourself away?
  Can't you see it, Peter? You are not going to tell me that you are so blind
  as all that!"</p>

  <p>"I must admit," he answered with a sigh, "that, although I think you go
  altogether too far, some suspicion of the sort has interfered with my perfect
  enjoyment of the morning."</p>

  <p>Miss Brown drew a little breath of relief. After all, then, his folly was
  not so consummate as it had seemed!</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do about it, then?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff coughed&mdash;he seemed in an unusually amenable frame of mind,
  and submitted to cross-examination without murmur.</p>

  <p>"The subject of Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald," he remarked, "seemed, somehow or
  other, to drop into the background during our luncheon. I propose, therefore,
  to continue to offer to Mrs. John Dory my most respectful admiration. If she
  accepts my friendship, and is satisfied with it, so much the better. I must
  admit that it would give me a great deal of pleasure to be her occasional
  companion&mdash;at such times when her husband happens to be in Glasgow!"</p>

  <p>"And supposing," Miss Brown asked, "that this is not all she
  wants&mdash;supposing, for instance, that she persists in her desire for
  information concerning Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald?"</p>

  <p>"Then," Peter Ruff admitted, "I'm afraid that I must conclude that her
  unchivalrous clod of a husband has indeed stooped to make a fool of her."</p>

  <p>"And in that case," Miss Brown demanded, "what shall you do?"</p>

  <p>"I was just thinking that out," Peter Ruff said mildly, "when you
  spoke...."</p>

  <p>The friendship of Peter Ruff with the wife of his enemy certainly appeared
  to progress in most satisfactory fashion. The dinner and visit to the theatre
  duly took place. Mr. Ruff was afterwards permitted to offer a slight supper
  and to accompany his fair companion a portion of the way home in a taxicab.
  She made several half-hearted attempts to return to the subject of Spencer
  Fitzgerald, but her companion had been able on each occasion to avoid the
  subject. Whether or not she was the victim of her husband's guile, there was
  no question about the reality of her enjoyment during the evening. Ruff, when
  he remembered the flash of her eyes across the table, the touch of her
  fingers in the taxi, was almost content to believe her false to her truant
  lover. If only she had not been married to John Dory, he realised, with a
  little sigh, that he might have taught her to forget that such a person
  existed as Spencer Fitzgerald, might have induced her to become Mrs. Peter
  Ruff!</p>

  <p>On their next meeting, however, Peter Ruff was forced to realise that his
  secretary's instinct had not misled her. It was, alas, no personal and
  sentimental regrets for her former lover which had brought the fair Maud to
  his office. The pleasures of her evening&mdash;they dined at Romano's and had
  a box at the Empire&mdash;were insufficient this time to keep her from
  recurring continually to the subject of her vanished lover. He tried
  strategy&mdash;jealousy amongst other things.</p>

  <p>"Supposing," he said, as they sat quite close to one another in the box
  during the interval, "supposing I were to induce our friend to come to
  London&mdash;I imagine he would be fairly safe now if he kept out of your
  husband's way&mdash;what would happen to me?"</p>

  <p>"You!" she murmured, glancing at him from behind her fan and then dropping
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Certainly&mdash;me!" he continued. "Don't you think that I should be
  doing myself a very ill turn if I brought you two together? I have very few
  friends, and I cannot afford to lose one. I am quite sure that you still care
  for him."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not a scrap!" she declared.</p>

  <p>"Then why did you put that advertisement in the paper?" Ruff asked, with
  smooth but swift directness.</p>

  <p>She was not quick enough to parry his question. He read the truth in her
  disconcerted face. Knowing it now for a certainty, he hastened to her
  aid.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me," he said, looking away. "I should not have asked that
  question&mdash;it is not my business. I will write to Fitzgerald. I will tell
  him that you want to see him, and that I think it would be safe for him to
  come to London."</p>

  <p>Maud recovered herself quickly. She thanked him with her eyes as well as
  her words.</p>

  <p>"And you needn't be jealous, really," she whispered behind her fan. "I
  only want to see him once for a few minutes&mdash;to ask a question. After
  that, I don't care what becomes of him."</p>

  <p>A poor sort of Delilah, really, with her flushed face, her too elaborately
  coiffured hair with its ugly ornament, her ready-made evening dress with its
  cheap attempts at smartness, her cleaned gloves, indifferent shoes. But Peter
  Ruff thought otherwise.</p>

  <p>"You mean that, after I have found him for you, you will still come out
  with me again sometimes?" he asked wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" she answered. "Whenever I can without John knowing," she
  added, with an unpleasant little laugh. "If you only knew how I loved the
  music and the theatres, and this sort of life! What a good time your wife
  would have, Mr. Ruff!" she added archly.</p>

  <p>It was no joking matter with him. He had to remember that he was, in
  effect, her tool, that she was making use of him, willing to betray her
  former lover at her husband's bidding. It was enough to make him, on his
  side, burn for revenge! Yet he put the thought away from him with a shiver.
  She was still the woman he had loved&mdash;she was still sacred to him! That
  night he pleaded an engagement, and sent her home in a taxicab alone.</p>

  <p>John Dory, waiting patiently at home for his wife's return, felt a certain
  uneasiness when she swept into their little sitting room in all her cheap
  splendour, with flushed cheeks&mdash;an obvious air of satisfaction with
  herself and disdain for her immediate surroundings. John Dory was a
  commonplace looking man&mdash;the absence of his collar, and his somewhat
  shabby carpet slippers, did not improve his appearance. He had neglected to
  shave, and he was drinking beer. At headquarters he was not considered quite
  the smart young officer which he had once shown signs of becoming. He looked
  at his wife with darkening face, and his wife, on her part, thought of Peter
  Ruff in his immaculate evening clothes.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked, grumblingly, "you seem to find a good deal of
  pleasure in this gadding about!"</p>

  <p>She threw her soiled fan on the table.</p>

  <p>"If I do," she answered, "you are not the one to sit there and reproach me
  with it, are you?"</p>

  <p>"It's gone far enough, anyway," John Dory said. "It's gone further than I
  meant it to go. Understand me, Maud&mdash;it's finished! I'll find your old
  sweetheart for myself."</p>

  <p>She laughed heartily.</p>

  <p>"You needn't trouble," she answered, with a little toss of the head. "I am
  not such a fool as you seem to think me. Mr. Ruff has made an appointment
  with him."</p>

  <p>There was a change in John Dory's face. The man's eyes were
  bright&mdash;they almost glittered.</p>

  <p>"You mean that your friend Mr. Ruff is going to produce Spencer
  Fitzgerald?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"He has promised to," she answered. "John," she declared, throwing herself
  into an easy-chair, "I feel horrid about it. I wonder what Mr. Ruff will
  think when he knows!"</p>

  <p>"You can feel how you like," John Dory answered bluntly, "so long as I get
  the handcuffs on Spencer Fitzgerald's wrists!"</p>

  <p>She shuddered. She looked at her husband with distaste.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk about it!" she begged sharply. "It makes me feel the meanest
  creature that ever crawled. I can't help feeling, too, that Mr. Ruff will
  think me a wretch&mdash;quite the gentleman he's been all the time! I never
  knew any one half so nice!"</p>

  <p>John Dory set down his empty glass.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he said, looking at her thoughtfully, "what made him take such
  a fancy to you! Rather sudden, wasn't it, eh?"</p>

  <p>Maud tossed her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't see anything so wonderful about that," she declared.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me, Maud," her husband said, rising to his feet. "You aren't a
  fool&mdash;not quite. You've spent some time with Peter Ruff. How
  much&mdash;think carefully&mdash;how much does he remind you of Spencer
  Fitzgerald?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," she answered promptly. "Why, he is years older, and though
  Spencer was quite the gentleman, there's something about Mr. Ruff, and the
  way he dresses and knows his way about&mdash;well, you can tell he's been a
  gentleman all his life."</p>

  <p>John Dory's face fell.</p>

  <p>"Think again," he said.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Can't see any likeness," she declared. "He did remind me a little of him
  just at first, though," she added, reflectively&mdash;"little things he said,
  and sort of mannerisms. I've sort of lost sight of them the last few times,
  though."</p>

  <p>"When is this meeting with Fitzgerald to come off?" John Dory asked
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>She did not answer him at once. A low, triumphant smile had parted her
  lips.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow night," she said; "he is to meet me in Mr. Ruff's office."</p>

  <p>"At what time?" John Dory asked.</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock," she answered. "Mr. Ruff is keeping his office open
  late on purpose. Spencer thinks that afterwards he is going to take me out to
  dinner."</p>

  <p>"You are sure of this?" John Dory asked eagerly. "You are sure that the
  man Ruff does not suspect you? You believe he means that you shall meet
  Fitzgerald?"</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it," she answered. "He is even a little jealous," she
  continued, with an affected laugh. "He told me&mdash;well, never mind!"</p>

  <p>"He told you what?" John Dory asked.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Never you mind," she said. "I have done what you asked me anyway. If Mr.
  Ruff had not found me an agreeable companion he would not have bothered about
  getting Spencer to meet me. And now he's done it," she added, "I do believe
  he's a little jealous."</p>

  <p>John Dory glared, but he said nothing. It seemed to him that his hour of
  revenge was close at hand!</p>

  <p>It was the first occasion upon which words of this sort had passed between
  Peter Ruff and his secretary. There was no denying the fact that Miss Violet
  Brown was in a passion. It was an hour past the time at which she usually
  left the office. For an hour she had pleaded, and Peter Ruff remained
  unmoved.</p>

  <p>"You are a fool!" she cried to him at last. "I am a fool, too, that I have
  ever wasted my thoughts and time upon you. Why can't I make you see? In every
  other way, heaven knows, you are clever enough! And yet there comes this
  vulgar, commonplace, tawdry little woman from heaven knows where, and makes
  such a fool of you that you are willing to fling away your career&mdash;to
  hold your wrists out for John Dory's handcuffs!"</p>

  <p>"My dear Violet," Peter Ruff answered deprecatingly, "you really worry
  me&mdash;you do indeed!"</p>

  <p>"Not half so much as you worry me," she declared. "Look at the time. It's
  already past seven. At eight o'clock Mrs. Dory&mdash;your Maud&mdash;is
  coming in here hoping to find her old sweetheart."</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Why not, indeed?" Miss Brown answered angrily. "Don't you
  know&mdash;can't you believe&mdash;that close on her heels will come her
  husband&mdash;that Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, if ever he comes to life in this
  room, will leave it between two policemen?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed.</p>

  <p>"What a pessimist you are, my dear Violet!" he said.</p>

  <p>She came up to him and laid her hands upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "I will tell you something&mdash;I must! I am fond of
  you, Peter. I always have been. Don't make me miserable if there is no need
  for it. Tell me honestly&mdash;do you really believe in this woman?"</p>

  <p>He removed her hands gently, and raised them to his lips.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl," he said, "I believe in every one until I find them out. I
  look upon suspicion as a vice. But, at the same time," he added, "there are
  always certain precautions which one takes."</p>

  <p>"What precautions can you take?" she cried. "Can you sit there and make
  yourself invisible? John Dory is not a fool. The moment he is in this room
  with the door closed behind him, it is the end."</p>

  <p>"We must hope not," Peter Ruff said cheerfully. "There are other things
  which may happen, you know."</p>

  <p>She turned away from him a little drearily.</p>

  <p>"You do not mind if I stay?" she said. "I am not working to-night.
  Perhaps, later on, I may be of use!"</p>

  <p>"As you will," he answered. "You will excuse me for a little time, won't
  you? I have some preparations to make."</p>

  <p>She turned her head away from him. He left the room and ascended the
  stairs to his own apartments.</p>

  <p>Eight o'clock was striking from St. Martin's Church when the door of Peter
  Ruff's office was softly opened and closed again. A man in a slouch hat and
  overcoat entered, and after feeling along the wall for a moment, turned up
  the electric light. Violet Brown rose from her place with a little sob. She
  stretched out her hand to him.</p>

  <p>"Peter!" she cried. "Peter!"</p>

  <p>"My name," the newcomer said calmly, "is Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald."</p>

  <p>"Oh, listen to me!" she begged. "There is still time, if you hurry. Think
  how many clever men before you have been deceived by the woman in whom they
  trusted. Please, please go! Hurry upstairs and put those things away."</p>

  <p>"Madam," the newcomer said, "I am much obliged to you for your interest,
  but I think that you are making a mistake. I have come here to
  meet&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He stopped short. There was a soft knocking at the door. A stifled scream
  broke from Violet Brown's lips.</p>

  <p>"It is too late!" she cried. "Peter! Peter!"</p>

  <p>She sank into her chair and covered her face with her hands. The door was
  opened and Maud came in. When she saw who it was who sat in Peter Ruff's
  place, she gave a little cry. Perhaps after all, she had not believed that
  this thing would happen.</p>

  <p>"Spencer!" she cried, "Spencer! Have you really come back?"</p>

  <p>He held out his hands.</p>

  <p>"You are glad to see me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She came slowly forward. The man rose from his place and came towards her
  with outstretched hands. Then through the door came John Dory, and one caught
  a glimpse of others behind him.</p>

  <p>"If my wife is not glad to see you, Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald," he aid, in a
  tone from which he vainly tried to keep the note of triumph, "I can assure
  you that I am. You slipped away from me cleverly at Daisy Villa, but this
  time I think you will not find it so easy."</p>

  <p>Maud shrank back, and her husband took her place. But Mr. Spencer
  Fitzgerald looked upon them both as one who looks upon figures in a dream.
  Miss Brown rose hurriedly from her seat. She came over to him and thrust her
  arm through his.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, taking his hand in hers, "don't shoot. It isn't worth
  while. You should have listened to me."</p>

  <p>The little man in the gold-rimmed spectacles looked at her, looked at Mr.
  John Dory, looked at the woman who was shrinking back now against the
  wall.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "this is the most extraordinary situation in which I
  ever found myself!"</p>

  <p>"We will help you to realise it," John Dory cried, and the triumph in his
  tone had swelled into a deeper note. "I came here to arrest Mr. Fitzgerald,
  but I hear this young lady call you 'Peter.' Perhaps this may be the
  solution&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The little man struck the table with the flat of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "this is getting a bit too thick. First of
  all&mdash;you," he said, turning to Miss Brown&mdash;"my name is not Peter,
  and I have no idea of shooting anybody. As for that lady against the wall, I
  don't know her&mdash;never saw her before in my life. As for you," he added,
  turning to John Dory, "you talk about arresting me&mdash;what for?"</p>

  <p>Mr. John Dory smiled.</p>

  <p>"There is an old warrant," he said, "which I have in my pocket, but I
  fancy that there are a few little things since then which we may have to
  enquire into."</p>

  <p>"This beats me!" the little man declared. "Who do you think I am?"</p>

  <p>"Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald, to start with," John Dory said. "It seems to me
  not impossible that we may find another pseudonym for you."</p>

  <p>"You can find as many as you like," the little man answered testily, "but
  my name is James Fitzgerald, and I am an actor employed at the Shaftesbury
  Theatre, as I can prove with the utmost ease. I never called myself Spencer;
  nor, to my knowledge, was I ever called by such a name. Nor, as I remarked
  before, have I ever seen any one of you three people before with the
  exception of Miss Brown here, whom I have seen on the stage."</p>

  <p>John Dory grunted.</p>

  <p>"It was Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald," he said, "a clerk in Howell &amp;
  Wilson's bookshop, who leapt out of the window of Daisy Villa two years ago.
  It may be Mr. James Fitzgerald now. Gentlemen of your profession have a knack
  of changing their names."</p>

  <p>"My profession's as good as yours, anyway!" the little man exclaimed. "We
  aren't all fools in it! My friend Mr. Peter Ruff said to me that there was a
  young lady whom I used to know who was anxious to meet me again, and would I
  step around here about eight o'clock. Here I am, and all I can say is, if
  that's the young lady, I never saw her before in my life."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's breathless silence. Then the door was softly opened.
  Violet Brown went staggering back like a woman who sees a ghost. She bit her
  lips till the blood came. It was Peter Ruff who stood looking in upon
  them&mdash;Peter Ruff, carefully dressed in evening clothes, his silk hat at
  exactly the correct angle, his coat and white kid gloves upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Dear me," he said, "you don't seem to be getting on very well! Mr. Dory,"
  he added, with a note of surprise in his tone, "this is indeed an unexpected
  pleasure!"</p>

  <p>The man who stood by the desk turned to him. The others were stricken
  dumb.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "there's some mistake. You told me to come here at
  eight o'clock to meet a young lady whom I used to know. Well, I never saw her
  before in my life," he added, pointing to Maud. "There's a man there who
  wants to arrest me&mdash;Lord knows what for! And here's Miss Brown, whom I
  have seen at the theatre several times but who never condescended to speak to
  me before, telling me not to shoot! What's it all about, Ruff? Is it a
  practical joke?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff laid down his coat and hat, and sat upon the table with his
  hands in his pockets.</p>

  <p>"Is it possible," he said, "that I have made a mistake? Isn't your second
  name Spencer?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My name is James Fitzgerald," he said. "I haven't missed a day at the
  Shaftesbury Theatre for three years, as you can find out by going round the
  corner. I never called myself Spencer, I was never clerk in a bookshop, and I
  never saw that lady before in my life."</p>

  <p>Maud came out from her place against the wall, and leaned eagerly forward.
  John Dory turned his head slowly towards his wife. A sickening fear had
  arisen in his heart&mdash;gripped him by the throat. Fooled once more, and by
  Peter Ruff!</p>

  <p>"It isn't Spencer!" Maud said huskily. "Mr. Ruff," she added, turning to
  him, "you know very well that this is not the Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald whom you
  promised to bring here to-night&mdash;Mr. Spencer Fitzgerald to whom I was
  once engaged."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff pointed to the figure of her husband.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said, "my invitation did not include your husband."</p>

  <p>John Dory took a step forward, and laid his hands upon the shoulders of
  the man who called himself Mr. James Fitzgerald. He looked into his face long
  and carefully. Then he turned away, and, gripping his wife by the arm, he
  passed out of the room. The door slammed behind him. The sound of heavy
  footsteps was heard descending to the floor below.</p>

  <p>Violet Brown crossed the room to where Peter Ruff was still sitting with a
  queer look upon his face, and, gripping him by the shoulders, shook him.</p>

  <p>"How dare you!" she exclaimed. "How dare you! Do you know that I have
  nearly cried my eyes out?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff came back from the world into which, for the moment, his
  thoughts had taken him.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "you have known me for some years. You have been my
  secretary for some months. If you choose still to take me for a fool, I
  cannot help it."</p>

  <p>"But," she exclaimed, pointing to Mr. James Fitzgerald&mdash;</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I have been practising on him for some time," he said, with an air of
  self-satisfaction.</p>

  <p>"A thin, mobile face, you see, and plenty of experience in the art of
  making up. It is astonishing what one can do if one tries."</p>

  <p>Mr. James Fitzgerald picked up his hat and coat.</p>

  <p>"It was worth more than five quid," he growled; "when I saw the handcuffs
  in that fellow's hand, I felt a cold shiver go down my spine."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff counted out two banknotes and passed them to his
  confederate.</p>

  <p>"You have earned the money," he said. "Go and spend it. Perhaps, Violet,"
  he added, turning towards her, "I have been a little inconsiderate. Come and
  have dinner with me, and forget it."</p>

  <p>She drew a little sigh.</p>

  <p>"You are sure," she murmured, "that you wouldn't rather take Maud?"</p>

  <h2>VI. THE LITTLE LADY FROM SERVIA</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Feb 1910</h3>

  <p class="first">Westward sped the little electric brougham, driven without
  regard to police regulations or any rule of the road: silent and swift,
  wholly regardless of other vehicles&mdash;as though, indeed, its occupants
  were assuming to themselves the rights of Royalty. Inside, Peter Ruff, a
  little breathless, was leaning forward, tying his white cravat with the aid
  of the little polished mirror set in the middle of the dark green cushions.
  At his right hand was Lady Mary, watching his proceedings with an air of
  agonised impatience.</p>

  <p>"Let me tell you&mdash;" she begged.</p>

  <p>"Kindly wait till I have tied this and put my studs in," Peter Ruff
  interrupted. "It is impossible for me to arrive at a ball in this condition,
  and I cannot give my whole attention to more than one thing at a time."</p>

  <p>"We shall be there in five minutes!" she exclaimed. "What is the good,
  unless you understand, of your coming at all?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff surveyed his tie critically. Fortunately, it pleased him. He
  began to press the studs into their places with firm fingers. Around them
  surged the traffic of Piccadilly; in front, the gleaming arc of lights around
  Hyde Park Corner. They had several narrow escapes. Once the brougham swayed
  dangerously as they cut in on the wrong side of an island lamp-post. A
  policeman shouted after them, another held up his hand&mdash;the driver of
  the brougham took no notice.</p>

  <p>"I am ready," Peter Ruff said, quietly.</p>

  <p>"My younger brother&mdash;Maurice," she began, breathlessly&mdash;"you've
  never met him, I know, but you've heard me speak of him. He is private
  secretary to Sir James Wentley&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Minister for Foreign Affairs?" Ruff asked, swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Maurice wants to go in for the Diplomatic Service. He is a dear, and
  so clever!"</p>

  <p>"Is it Maurice who is in trouble?" Peter Ruff asked. "Why didn't he come
  himself?"</p>

  <p>"I am trying to explain," Lady Mary protested. "This afternoon he had an
  important paper to turn into cipher and hand over to the Prime Minister at
  the Duchess of Montford's dance to-night. The Prime Minister will arrive in a
  motor car from the country at about two o'clock, and the first thing he will
  ask for will be that paper. It has been stolen!"</p>

  <p>"At what time did your brother finish copying it, and when did he discover
  its loss?" Ruff asked, with a slight air of weariness. These preliminary
  enquiries always bored him.</p>

  <p>"He finished it in his own rooms at half-past seven," Lady Mary answered.
  "He discovered its loss at eleven o'clock&mdash;directly he had arrived at
  the ball."</p>

  <p>"Why didn't he come to me himself?" Peter Ruff asked. "I like to have
  these particulars at first hand."</p>

  <p>"He is in attendance upon Sir James at the ball," Lady Mary answered.
  "There is trouble in the East, as you know, and Sir James is expecting
  dispatches to-night. Maurice is not allowed to leave."</p>

  <p>"Has he told Sir James yet?"</p>

  <p>"He had not when I left," Lady Mary answered. "If he is forced to do so,
  it will be ruin! Mr. Ruff, you must help us Maurice is such a dear, but a
  mistake like this, at the very beginning of his career, would be fatal. Here
  we are. That is my brother waiting just inside the hall."</p>

  <p>A young man came up to them in the vestibule. He was somewhat pale, but
  otherwise perfectly self-possessed. From the shine of his glossy black hair
  to the tips of his patent boots he was, in appearance, everything that a
  young Englishman of birth and athletic tastes could hope to be. Peter Ruff
  liked the look of him. He waited for no introduction, but laid his hand at
  once upon the young man's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Between seven-thirty and arriving here," he said, drawing him on one
  side&mdash;"quick! Tell me, whom did you see? What opportunities were there
  of stealing the paper, and by whom?"</p>

  <p>"I finished it at five and twenty past seven," the young man said, "sealed
  it in an official envelope, and stood it up on my desk by the side of my coat
  and hat and muffler, which my servant had laid there, ready for me to put on.
  My bedroom opens out from my sitting room. While I was dressing, two men
  called for me&mdash;Paul Jermyn and Count von Hern. They walked through to my
  bedroom first, and then sat together in the sitting room until I came out.
  The door was wide open, and we talked all the time."</p>

  <p>"They called accidentally?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;by appointment," the young man replied. "We were all coming on
  here to the dance, and we had agreed to dine together first at the
  Savoy."</p>

  <p>"You say that you left the paper on your desk with your coat and hat?"
  Peter Ruff asked. "Was it there when you came out?"</p>

  <p>"Apparently so," the young man answered. "It seemed to be standing in
  exactly the same place as where I had left it. I put it into my breast
  pocket, and it was only when I arrived here that I fancied the envelope
  seemed lighter. I went off by myself and tore it open. There was nothing
  inside but half a newspaper!"</p>

  <p>"What about the envelope?" Peter Ruff asked. "That must have been the same
  sort of one as you had used or you would have noticed it?"</p>

  <p>"It was," the Honorable Maurice answered.</p>

  <p>"It was a sort which you kept in your room?"</p>

  <p>"Yes!" the young man admitted.</p>

  <p>"The packet was changed, then, by some one in your room, or some one who
  had access to it," Peter Ruff said. "How about your servant?"</p>

  <p>"It was his evening off. I let him put out my things and go at seven
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>"You must tell me the nature of the contents of the packet," Peter Ruff
  declared. "Don't hesitate. You must do it. Remember the alternative."</p>

  <p>The young man did hesitate for several moments, but a glance into his
  sister's appealing face decided him.</p>

  <p>"It was our official reply to a secret communication from Russia
  respecting&mdash;a certain matter in the Balkans."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Where is Count von Hern?" he asked abruptly.</p>

  <p>"Inside, dancing."</p>

  <p>"I must use a telephone at once," Peter Ruff said. "Ask one of the
  servants here where I can find one."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was conducted to a gloomy waiting room, on the table of which
  stood a small telephone instrument. He closed the door, but he was absent for
  only a few minutes. When he rejoined Lady Mary and her brother they were
  talking together in agitated whispers. The latter turned towards him at
  once.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you suspect Count von Hern?" he asked, doubtfully. "He
  is a friend of the Danish Minister's, and every one says that he's such a
  good chap. He doesn't seem to take the slightest interest in
  politics&mdash;spends nearly all his time hunting or playing polo."</p>

  <p>"I don't suspect any one," Peter Ruff answered. "I only know that Count
  von Hern is an Austrian spy, and that he took your paper! Has he been out of
  your sight at all since you rejoined him in the sitting room? I mean to
  say&mdash;had he any opportunity of leaving you during the time you were
  dining together, or did he make any calls en route, either on the way to the
  Savoy or from the Savoy here?"</p>

  <p>The young man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"He has not been out of my sight for a second."</p>

  <p>"Who is the other man&mdash;Jermyn?" Peter Ruff asked. "I never heard of
  him."</p>

  <p>"An American&mdash;cousin of the Duchess. He could not have had the
  slightest interest in the affair."</p>

  <p>"Please take me into the ballroom," Peter Ruff said to Lady Mary. "Your
  brother had better not come with us. I want to be as near the Count von Hern
  as possible."</p>

  <p>They passed into the crowded rooms, unnoticed, purposely avoiding the
  little space where the Duchess was still receiving the late comers among her
  guests. They found progress difficult, and Lady Mary felt her heart sink as
  she glanced at the little jewelled watch which hung from her wrist. Suddenly
  Peter Ruff came to a standstill.</p>

  <p>"Don't look for a moment," he said, "but tell me as soon as you
  can&mdash;who is that tall young man, like a Goliath, talking to the little
  dark woman? You see whom I mean?"</p>

  <p>Lady Mary nodded, and they passed on. In a moment or two she answered
  him.</p>

  <p>"How strange that you should ask!" she whispered in his ear. "That is Mr.
  Jermyn."</p>

  <p>They were on the outskirts now of the ballroom itself. One of Lady Mary's
  partners came up with an open programme and a face full of reproach.</p>

  <p>"Do please forgive me, Captain Henderson," Lady Mary begged. "I have hurt
  my foot, and I am not dancing any more."</p>

  <p>"But surely I was to take you in to supper?" the young officer protested,
  good-humouredly. "Don't tell me that you are going to cut that?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to cut everything to-night with everybody," Lady Mary said.
  "Please forgive me. Come to tea to-morrow and I'll explain."</p>

  <p>The young man bowed, and, with a curious glance at Ruff, accepted his
  dismissal. Another partner was simply waved away.</p>

  <p>"Please turn round and come back," Peter Ruff said. "I want to see those
  two again."</p>

  <p>"But we haven't found Count von Hern yet," she protested. "Surely that is
  more important, is it not? I believe that I saw him dancing just
  now&mdash;there, with the tall girl in yellow."</p>

  <p>"Never mind about him, for the moment," Ruff answered. "Walk down this
  corridor with me. Do you mind talking all the time, please? It will sound
  more natural, and I want to listen."</p>

  <p>The young American and his partner had found a more retired seat now,
  about three quarters of the way down the pillared vestibule which bordered
  the ballroom. He was bending over his companion with an air of unmistakable
  devotion, but it was she who talked. She seemed, indeed, to have a good deal
  to say to him. The slim white fingers of one hand played all the time with a
  string of magnificent pearls. Her dark, soft eyes&mdash;black as aloes and
  absolutely un-English&mdash;flashed into his. A delightful smile hovered at
  the corners of her lips. All the time she was talking and he was listening.
  Lady Mary and her partner passed by unnoticed. At the end of the vestibule
  they turned and retraced their steps. Peter Ruff was very quiet&mdash;he had
  caught a few of those rapid words. But the woman's foreign accent had
  troubled him.</p>

  <p>"If only she would speak in her own language!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>Lady Mary's hand suddenly tightened upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Look!" she exclaimed. "That is Count von Hern!"</p>

  <p>A tall, fair young man, very exact in his dress, very stiff in his
  carriage, with a not unpleasant face, was standing talking to Jermyn and his
  companion. Jermyn, who apparently found the intrusion an annoyance, was
  listening to the conversation between the two, with a frown upon his face and
  a general attitude of irritation. As Lady Mary and her escort drew near, the
  reason for the young American's annoyance became clearer&mdash;his two
  companions were talking softly, but with great animation, in a foreign
  language, which it was obvious that he did not understand. Peter Ruff's elbow
  pressed against his partner's arm, and their pace slackened. He ventured,
  even, to pause for a moment, looking into the ballroom as though in search of
  some one, and he had by no means the appearance of a man likely to understand
  Hungarian. Then, to Lady Mary's surprise, he touched the Count von Hern on
  the shoulder and addressed him.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon, sir," he said, "but I fancy that we accidentally
  exchanged programmes, a few minutes ago, at the buffet. I have lost mine and
  picked up one which does not belong to me. As we were standing side by side,
  it is possibly yours."</p>

  <p>"I believe not, sir," he answered, with that pleasant smile which had gone
  such a long way toward winning him the reputation of being "a good fellow"
  amongst a fairly large circle of friends. "I believe at any rate," he added,
  glancing at his programme, "that this is my own. You mistake me, probably,
  for some one else."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, without saying a word, was actor enough to suggest that he was
  unconvinced. The Count good-humouredly held out his programme.</p>

  <p>"You shall see for yourself," he remarked. "That is not yours, is it?
  Besides, I have not been to the buffet at all this evening."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff cast a swift glance down the programme which the Count had
  handed him. Then he apologised profusely.</p>

  <p>"I was mistaken," he admitted. "I am very sorry."</p>

  </div>

  <p>The Count bowed.</p>

  <p>"It is of no consequence, sir," he said, and resumed his conversation.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff passed on with Lady Mary. At a safe distance, she glanced at
  him enquiringly.</p>

  <p>"It was his programme I wanted to see," Peter Ruff explained. "It is as I
  thought. He has had four dances with the Countess&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Who is she?" Lady Mary asked, quickly.</p>

  <p>"The little dark lady with whom he is talking now," Peter Ruff continued.
  "He seems, too, to be going early. He has no dances reserved after the
  twelfth. We will go downstairs at once, if you please. I must speak to your
  brother."</p>

  <p>"Have you been able to think of anything?" she asked, anxiously. "Is there
  any chance at all, do you think?"</p>

  <p>"I believe so," Peter Ruff answered. "It is most interesting. Don't be too
  sanguine, though. The odds are against us, and the time is very short. Is the
  driver of your electric brougham to be trusted?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," she assured him. "He is an old servant."</p>

  <p>"Will you lend him to me?" Peter Ruff asked, "and tell him that he is to
  obey my instructions absolutely?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," she answered. "You are going away, then?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded. He was a little sparing of words just then. The
  thoughts were chasing one another through his brain. He was listening, too,
  for the sweep of a dress behind.</p>

  <p>"Is there nothing I can do?" Lady Mary begged, eagerly.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head. In the distance he saw the Honourable Maurice
  come quickly toward them. With a firm but imperceptible gesture he waved him
  away.</p>

  <p>"Don't let your brother speak to me," he said. "We can't tell who is
  behind. What time did you say the Prime Minister was expected?"</p>

  <p>"At two o'clock," Lady Mary said, anxiously.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff glanced at his watch. It was already half an hour past
  midnight.</p>

  <p>"Very well," he said, "I will do what I can. If my theory is wrong, it
  will be nothing. If I am right&mdash;well, there is a chance, anyhow. In the
  meantime&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"In the meantime?" she repeated, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"Take your brother back to the ballroom," Peter Ruff directed. "Make him
  dance&mdash;dance yourself. Don't give yourselves away by looking anxious.
  When the time is short&mdash;say at a quarter to two&mdash;he can come down
  here and wait for me."</p>

  <p>"If you don't come!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Then we shall have lost," Peter Ruff said, calmly. "If you don't see me
  again to-night, you had better read the newspapers carefully for the next few
  days."</p>

  <p>"You are going to do something dangerous!" she protested.</p>

  <p>"There is danger in interfering at all in such a matter as this," he
  answered, "but you must remember that it is not only my profession&mdash;it
  is my hobby. Remember, too," he added, with a smile, "that I do not often
  lose!"</p>

  <p>For twenty minutes Peter Ruff sat in the remote corner of Lady Mary's
  electric brougham, drawn up at the other side of the Square, and waited. At
  last he pressed a button. They glided off. Before them was a large, closed
  motor car. They started in discreet chase.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, however, the chase was not a long one. The car which Peter
  Ruff had been following was drawn up before a plain, solid-looking house,
  unlit and of gloomy appearance. The little lady with the wonderful eyes was
  already halfway up the flagged steps. Hastily lifting the flap and looking
  behind as they passed, her pursuer saw her open the door with a latchkey, and
  disappear. Peter Ruff pulled the check-string and descended. For several
  moments he stood and observed the house into which the lady whom he had been
  following had disappeared. Then he turned to the driver.</p>

  <p>"I want you to watch that house," he said, "never to take your eyes off
  it. When I reappear from it, if I do at all, I shall probably be in a hurry.
  Directly you see me be on your box ready to start. A good deal may depend
  upon our getting away quickly."</p>

  <p>"Very good, sir," the man answered. "How long am I to wait here for
  you?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff's lips twisted into a curious little smile.</p>

  <p>"Until two o'clock," he answered. "If I am not out by then, you needn't
  bother any more about me. You can return and tell your mistress exactly what
  has happened."</p>

  <p>"Hadn't I better come and try and get you out, sir?" the man asked.
  "Begging your pardon, but her Ladyship told me that there might be queer
  doings. I'm a bit useful in a scrap, sir," he added. "I do a bit of sparring
  regularly."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If there's any scrap at all," he said, "you had better be out of it. Do
  as I have said."</p>

  <p>The motor car had turned round and disappeared now, and in a few moments
  Peter Ruff stood before the door of the house into which the little lady had
  disappeared. The problem of entrance was already solved for him. The door had
  been left unlatched; only a footstool had been placed against it inside.
  Peter Ruff, without hesitation, pushed the door softly open and entered,
  replaced the footstool in its former position, and stood with his back to the
  wall, in the darkest corner of the hall, looking around him&mdash;listening
  intently. Nearly opposite the door of a room stood ajar. It was apparently
  lit up, but there was no sound of any one moving inside. Upstairs, in one of
  the rooms on the first floor, he could hear light footsteps&mdash;a woman's
  voice humming a song. He listened to the first few bars, and understanding
  became easier. Those first few bars were the opening ones of the Servian
  national anthem!</p>

  <p>With an effort, Peter Ruff concentrated his thoughts upon the immediate
  present. The little lady was upstairs. The servants had apparently retired
  for the night. He crept up to the half-open door and peered in. The room, as
  he had hoped to find it, was empty, but Madame's easy-chair was drawn up to
  the fire, and some coffee stood upon the hob. Stealthily Peter Ruff crept in
  and glanced around, seeking for a hiding place. A movement upstairs hastened
  his decision. He pushed aside the massive curtains which separated this from
  a connecting room. He had scarcely done so when light footsteps were heard
  descending the stairs.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff found his hiding place all that could have been desired. This
  secondary room itself was almost in darkness, but he was just able to
  appreciate the comforting fact that it possessed a separate exit into the
  hall. Through the folds of the curtain he had a complete view of the further
  apartment. The little lady had changed her gown of stiff white satin for one
  of flimsier material, and, seated in the easy-chair, she was busy pouring
  herself out some coffee. She took a cigarette from a silver box, and lighting
  it, curled herself up in the chair and composed herself as though to listen.
  To her as well as to Peter Ruff, as he crouched in his hiding place, the
  moments seemed to pass slowly enough. Yet, as he realised afterward, it could
  not have been ten minutes before she sat upright in a listening attitude.
  There was some one coming! Peter Ruff, too, heard a man's firm footsteps come
  up the flagged stones.</p>

  <p>The little lady sprang to her feet.</p>

  <p>"Paul!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Paul Jermyn came slowly to meet her. He seemed a little out of breath. His
  tie was all disarranged and his collar unfastened.</p>

  <p>The little lady, however, noticed none of these things. She looked only
  into his face.</p>

  <p>"Have you got it?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>He thrust his hand into his breast-coat pocket, and held an envelope out
  toward her.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" he answered. "I promised!"</p>

  <p>She gave a little sob, and with the packet in her hand came running
  straight toward the spot where Peter Ruff was hiding.</p>

  <p>He shrank back as far as possible. She stopped just short of the curtain,
  opened the drawer of a table which stood there, and slipped the packet in.
  Then she came back once more to where Paul Jermyn was standing.</p>

  <p>"My friend!" she cried, holding out her hands&mdash;"my dear, dear friend!
  Shall I ever be able to thank you enough?"</p>

  <p>"Why, if you try," he answered, smiling, "I think that you could!"</p>

  <p>She laid her hand upon his arm&mdash;a little caressing, foreign
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she said, "how did you manage it?"</p>

  <p>"We left the dance together," Jermyn said. "I could see that he wanted to
  get rid of me, but I offered to take him in my motor car. I told the man to
  choose some back streets, and while we were passing through one of them, I
  took Von Hern by the throat. We had a struggle, of course, but I got the
  paper."</p>

  <p>"What did you do with Von Hern?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I left him on his doorstep," the young American answered. "He wasn't
  really hurt, but he was only half conscious. I don't think he'll bother any
  one to-night."</p>

  <p>"You dear, brave man!" she murmured. "Paul, what am I to say to you?"</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"That's what I'm here to ask," he declared. "You wouldn't give me my
  answer at the ball. Perhaps you'll give it me now?"</p>

  <p>They sprang apart. Ruff felt his nerves stiffen&mdash;felt himself
  constrained to hold even his breath as he widened a little the crack in the
  curtains. This was no stealthy entrance. The door had been flung open. Von
  Hern, his dress in wild disorder, pale as a ghost, and with a great
  bloodstain upon his cheek, stood confronting them.</p>

  <p>"When you have done with your love-making," he called out, "I'll trouble
  you to restore my property!"</p>

  <p>The electric light gleamed upon a small revolver which flashed out toward
  the young American. Paul Jermyn never hesitated for a moment. He seized the
  chair by his side and flung it at Von Hern. There was a shot, the crash of
  the falling chair, a cry from Jermyn, who never hesitated, however, in his
  rush. The two men closed. A second shot went harmlessly to the ceiling. The
  little lady stole away&mdash;stole softly across the room toward the table.
  She opened the drawer. Suddenly the blood in her veins was frozen into fear.
  From nowhere, it seemed to her, came a hand which held her wrists like
  iron!</p>

  <p>"Madam," Peter Ruff whispered from behind the curtain, "I am sorry to
  deprive you of it, but this is stolen property."</p>

  <p>Her screams rang through the room. Even the two men released one
  another.</p>

  <p>"It is gone! It is gone!" she cried. "Some one was hiding in the room!
  Quick!"</p>

  <p>She sprang into the hall. The two men followed her. The front door was
  slammed. They heard flying footsteps outside. Von Hern was out first,
  clearing the little flight of steps in one bound. Across the road he saw a
  flying figure. A level stream of fire poured from his hand&mdash;twice, three
  times. But Peter Ruff never faltered. Round the corner he tore. The man had
  kept his word&mdash;the brougham was already moving slowly.</p>

  <p>"Jump in, sir," the man cried. "Throw yourself in. Never mind about the
  door."</p>

  <p>They heard the shouts behind. Peter Ruff did as he was bid, and sat upon
  the floor, raising himself gradually to the seat when they had turned another
  corner. Then he put his head out of the window.</p>

  <p>"Back to the Duchess of Montford's!" he ordered.</p>

  <p>The latest of the guests had ceased to arrive&mdash;a few were already
  departing. It was an idle time, however, with the servants who loitered in
  the vestibules of Montford House, and they looked with curiosity upon this
  strange guest who arrived at five minutes to two, limping a little, and
  holding his left arm in his right hand. One footman on the threshold nearly
  addressed him, but the words were taken out of his mouth when he saw Lady
  Mary and her brother&mdash;the Honorable Maurice Sotherst&mdash;hasten
  forward to greet him.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff smiled upon them benignly.</p>

  <p>"You can take the paper out of my breast-coat pocket," he said.</p>

  <p>The young man's fingers gripped it. Through Lady Mary's great
  thankfulness, however, the sudden fear came shivering.</p>

  <p>"You are hurt!" she whispered. "There is blood on your sleeve."</p>

  <p>"Just a graze," Peter Ruff answered. "Von Hern wasn't much good at a
  running target. Back to the ballroom, young man," he added. "Don't you see
  who's coming?"</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister came up the tented way into Montford House. He, too,
  wondered a little at the man whom he met on his way out, holding his left
  arm, and looking more as though he had emerged from a street fight than from
  the Duchess of Montford's ball. Peter Ruff went home smiling.</p>

  <h2>VII. THE DEMAND OF THE DOUBLE-FOUR</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Mar 1910</h3>

  <p class="first">It was about this time that Peter Ruff found among his
  letters one morning a highly-scented little missive, addressed to him in a
  handwriting with which he had once been familiar. He looked at it for several
  moments before opening it. Even as the paper cutter slid through the top of
  the envelope, he felt that he had already divined the nature of its
  contents.</p>

  <p class="letter">FRIVOLITY THEATRE<br>
  March 10th</p>

  <p class="letter">MY DEAR Mr. RUFF:&mdash; I expect that you will be
  surprised to hear from me again, but I do hope that you will not be annoyed.
  I know that I behaved very horridly a little time ago, but it was not
  altogether my fault, and I have been more sorry for it than I can tell
  you&mdash;in fact, John and I have never been the same since, and for the
  present, at any rate, I have left him and gone on the stage. A lady whom I
  knew got me a place in the chorus here, and so far I like it immensely.<br>
  <br>
  Won't you come and meet me after the show to-morrow night, and I will tell
  you all about it? I should like so much to see you again.<br>
  <br>
  MAUD.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff placed this letter in his breast-coat pocket, and withheld it
  from his secretary's notice. He felt, however, very little pleasure at the
  invitation it conveyed. He hesitated for some time, in fact, whether to
  accept it or not. Finally, after his modest dinner that evening, he bought a
  stall for the Frivolity and watched the piece. The girl he had come to see
  was there in the second row of the chorus, but she certainly did not look her
  best in the somewhat scant costume required by the part. She showed no signs
  whatever of any special ability&mdash;neither her dancing nor her singing
  seemed to entitle her to any consideration. She carried herself with a
  certain amount of self-consciousness, and her eyes seemed perpetually fixed
  upon the occupants of the stalls. Peter Ruff laid down his glasses with
  something between a sigh and a groan. There was something to him
  inexpressibly sad in the sight of his old sweetheart so transformed, so
  utterly changed from the prim, somewhat genteel young person who had accepted
  his modest advances with such ladylike diffidence. She seemed, indeed, to
  have lost those very gifts which had first attracted him. Nevertheless, he
  kept his appointment at the stage-door.</p>

  <p>She was among the first to come out, and she greeted him
  warmly&mdash;almost noisily. With her new profession, she seemed to have
  adopted a different and certainly more flamboyant deportment.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd come to-night," she declared, with an arch look. "I felt
  certain I saw you in the stalls. You are going to take me to supper, aren't
  you? Shall we go to the Milan?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff assented without enthusiasm, handed her into a hansom, and took
  his place beside her. She wore a very large hat, untidily put on; some of the
  paint seemed still to be upon her face; her voice, too, seemed to have become
  louder, and her manner more assertive. There were obvious indications that
  she no longer considered brandy and soda an unladylike beverage. Peter Ruff
  was not pleased with himself or proud of his companion.</p>

  <p>"You'll take some wine?" he suggested, after he had ordered, with a few
  hints from her, a somewhat extensive supper.</p>

  <p>"Champagne," she answered, decidedly. "I've got quite used to it,
  nowadays," she went on. "I could laugh to think how strange it tasted when
  you first took me out."</p>

  <p>"Tell me," Peter Ruff said, "why you have left your husband?"</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Because he was dull and because he was cross," she answered, "and because
  the life down at Streatham was simply intolerable. I think it was a little
  your fault, too," she said, making eyes; at him across the table. "You gave
  me a taste of what life was like outside Streatham, and I never forgot
  it."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff did not respond&mdash;he led the conversation, indeed, into
  other channels. On the whole, the supper was scarcely a success. Maud, who
  was growing to consider herself something of a Bohemian, and who certainly
  looked for some touch of sentiment on the part of her old admirer, was
  annoyed by the quiet deference with which he treated her. She reproached him
  with it once, bluntly.</p>

  <p>"Say," she exclaimed, "you don't seem to want to be so friendly as you
  did! You haven't forgiven me yet, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is not that," he said, "but I think that you have scarcely done a wise
  thing in leaving your husband. I cannot think that this life on the stage is
  good for you."</p>

  <p>She laughed, scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "I never thought to have you preaching at me!"</p>

  <p>They finished their supper. Maud accepted a cigarette and did her best to
  change her companion's mood. She only alluded once more to her husband.</p>

  <p>"I don't see how I could have stayed with him, anyhow," she said. "You
  know, he's been put back&mdash;he only gets two pounds fifteen a week now. He
  couldn't expect me to live upon that."</p>

  <p>"Put back?" Peter Ruff repeated.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"He seemed to have a lot of bad luck this last year," she said. "All his
  cases went wrong, and they don't think so much of him at Scotland Yard as
  they did. I am not sure that he hasn't begun to drink a little."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to hear it," Peter Ruff said, gravely.</p>

  <p>"I don't see why you should be," she answered, bluntly. "He was no friend
  of yours, nor isn't now. He may not be so dangerous as he was, but if ever
  you come across him, you take my tip and be careful. He means to do you a
  mischief some day, if he can. I am not sure," she added, "that he doesn't
  believe that it was partly your fault about my leaving home."</p>

  <p>"I should be sorry for him to think that," Peter Ruff answered. "While we
  are upon the subject, can't you tell me exactly why your husband dislikes me
  so?"</p>

  <p>"For one thing, because you have been up against him in several of his
  cases, and have always won."</p>

  <p>"And for the other?"</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, doubtfully, "he seems to connect you in his mind,
  somehow, with a boy who was in love with me once&mdash;Mr. Spencer
  Fitzgerald&mdash;you know who I mean."</p>

  <p>Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"He still has that in his mind, has he?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he's mad!" she declared. "However, don't let us talk about him any
  more."</p>

  <p>The lights were being put out. Peter Ruff paid his bill and they rose
  together.</p>

  <p>"Come down to the fiat for an hour or so," she begged, taking his arm. "I
  have a dear little place with another girl&mdash;Carrie Pearce. I'll sing to
  you, if you like. Come down and have one drink, anyhow."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head firmly.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said, "but you must excuse me. In some ways, I am very
  old-fashioned," he added. "I never sit up late, and I hate music."</p>

  <p>"Just drive as far as the door with me, then," she begged.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You must excuse me," he said, handing her into the hansom. "And, Maud,"
  he added&mdash;"if I may call you so&mdash;take my advice: give it
  up&mdash;go back to your husband and stick to him&mdash;you'll be better off
  in the long run."</p>

  <p>She would have answered him scornfully, but there was something impressive
  in the crisp, clear words&mdash;in his expression, too, as he looked into her
  eyes. She threw herself back in a corner of the cab with an affected little
  laugh, and turned her head away from him.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff walked back into the cloak-room for his coat and hat, and
  sighed softly to himself. It was the end of the one sentimental episode of
  his life!</p>

  <p>It had been the study of Peter Ruff's life, so far as possible, to
  maintain under all circumstances an equable temperament, to refuse to
  recognize the meaning of the word "nerves," and to be guided in all his
  actions by that profound common sense which was one of his natural gifts. Yet
  there were times when, like any other ordinary person, he suffered acutely
  from presentiments. He left his rooms, for instance, at five o'clock on the
  afternoon of the day following his supper with Maud, suffering from a sense
  of depression for which he found it altogether impossible to account. It was
  true that the letter which he had in his pocket, the appointment which he was
  on his way to keep, were both of them probable sources of embarrassment and
  annoyance, if not of danger. He was being invited, without the option of
  refusal, to enter upon some risky undertaking which would yield him neither
  fee nor reward. Yet his common sense told him that it was part of the game.
  In Paris, he had looked upon his admittance into the order of the
  "Double-Four" as one of the stepping-stones to success in his career. Through
  them he had gained knowledge which he could have acquired in no other way.
  Through them, for instance, he had acquired the information that Madame la
  Comtesse de Pilitz was a Servian patriot and a friend of the Crown Prince;
  and that the Count von Hern, posing in England as a sportsman and an idler,
  was a highly paid and dangerous Austrian spy. There had been other occasions,
  too, upon which they had come to his aid. Now they had made an appeal to
  him&mdash;an appeal which must be obeyed. His time&mdash;perhaps, even, his
  safety&mdash;must be placed entirely at their disposal. It was only an
  ordinary return a thing expected of him&mdash;a thing which he dared not
  refuse. Yet he knew very well what he could not explain to them&mdash;that
  the whole success of his life depended so absolutely upon his remaining free
  from any suspicion of wrong-doing, that he had received his summons with
  something like dismay, and proceeded to obey it with unaccustomed
  reluctance.</p>

  <p>He drove to Cirey's cafe in Regent Street, where he dismissed the driver
  of his hansom and strolled in with the air of an habitue. He selected a
  corner table, ordered some refreshment, and asked for a box of dominoes. The
  place was fairly well filled. A few women were sitting about; a sprinkling of
  Frenchmen were taking their aperitif; here and there a man of affairs, on his
  way from the city, had called in for a glass of vermouth. Peter Ruff looked
  them over, recognizing the type&mdash;recognizing, even, some of their faces.
  Apparently, the person whom he was to meet had not yet arrived.</p>

  <p>He lit a cigarette and smoked slowly. Presently the door opened and a
  woman entered in a long fur coat, a large hat, and a thick veil. She raised
  it to glance around, disclosing the unnaturally pale face and dark, swollen
  eyes of a certain type of Frenchwoman. She seemed to notice no one in
  particular. Her eyes traveled over Peter Ruff without any sign of interest.
  Nevertheless, she took a seat somewhere near his and ordered some vermouth
  from the waiter, whom she addressed by name. When she had been served and the
  waiter had departed, she looked curiously at the dominoes which stood before
  her neighbor.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur plays dominoes, perhaps?" she remarked, taking one of them into
  her fingers and examining it. "A very interesting game!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff showed her a domino which he had been covering with his
  hand&mdash;it was a double four. She nodded, and moved from her seat to one
  immediately next him.</p>

  <p>"I had not imagined," Peter Ruff said, "that it was a lady whom I was to
  meet."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is not disappointed, I trust?" she said, smiling. "If I talk
  banalities, Monsieur must pardon it. Both the waiters here are spies, and
  there are always people who watch. Monsieur is ready to do us a service?"</p>

  <p>"To the limits of my ability," Peter Ruff answered. "Madame will remember
  that we are not in Paris; that our police system, if not so wonderful as
  yours, is still a closer and a more present thing. They have not the brains
  at Scotland Yard, but they are persistent&mdash;hard to escape."</p>

  <p>"Do I not know it?" the woman said. "It is through them that we send for
  you. One of us is in danger."</p>

  <p>"Do I know him?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"It is doubtful," she answered. "Monsieur's stay in Paris was so brief. If
  Monsieur will recognize his name&mdash;it is Jean Lemaitre himself."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff started slightly.</p>

  <p>"I thought," he said, with some hesitation, "that Lemaitre did not visit
  this country."</p>

  <p>"He came well disguised," the woman answered. "It was thought to be safe.
  Nevertheless, it was a foolish thing. They have tracked him down from hotel
  to apartments, till he lives now in the back room of a wretched little cafe
  in Soho. Even from there we cannot get him away&mdash;the whole district is
  watched by spies. We need help."</p>

  <p>"For a genius like Lemaitre," Peter Ruff said, thoughtfully, "to have even
  thought of Soho, was foolish. He should have gone to Hampstead or Balham. It
  is easy to fool our police if you know how. On the other hand, they hang on
  to the scent like leeches when once they are on the trail. How many warrants
  are there out against Jean in this country?"</p>

  <p>"Better not ask that," the woman said, grimly. "You remember the raid on a
  private house in the Holloway Road, two years ago, when two policemen were
  shot and a spy was stabbed? Jean was in that&mdash;it is sufficient!"</p>

  <p>"Are any plans made at all?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"But naturally," the woman answered. "There is a motor car, even now, of
  sixty-horse-power, stands ready at a garage in Putney. If Jean can once reach
  it, he can reach the coast. At a certain spot near Southampton there is a
  small steamer waiting. After that, everything is easy."</p>

  <p>"My task, then," Peter Ruff said, thoughtfully, "is to take Jean Lemaitre
  from this cafe in Soho, as far as Putney, and get him a fair start?"</p>

  <p>"It is enough," she answered. "There is a cordon of spies around the
  district. Every day they seem to chose in upon us. They search the houses,
  one by one. Only last night, the Hotel de Netherlands&mdash;a miserable
  little place on the other side of the street&mdash;was suddenly surrounded by
  policemen and every room ransacked. It may be our turn to-night."</p>

  <p>"In one hour's time," Peter Ruff said, glancing at his watch, "I shall
  present myself as a doctor at the cafe. Tell me the address. Tell me what to
  say which will insure my admission to Jean Lemaitre!"</p>

  <p>"The cafe," she answered, "is called the Hotel de Flandres. You enter the
  restaurant and you walk to the desk. There you find always Monsieur Antoine.
  You say to him simply&mdash;'The Double-Four!' He will answer that he
  understands, and he will conduct you at once to Lemaitre."</p>

  <p>Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," he said, "let it be understood in the cafe&mdash;if
  there is any one who is not in the secret&mdash;that one of the waiters is
  sick. I shall come to attend him."</p>

  <p>She nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"As well that way as any other," she answered. "Monsieur is very kind. A
  bientot!"</p>

  <p>She shook hands and they parted. Peter Ruff drove back to his rooms, rang
  up an adjoining garage for a small covered car such as are usually let out to
  medical men, and commenced to pack a small black bag with the outfit
  necessary for his purpose. Now that he was actually immersed in his work, the
  sense of depression had passed away. The keen stimulus of danger had
  quickened his blood. He knew very well that the woman had not exaggerated.
  There was no man more wanted by the French or the English police than the man
  who had sought his aid, and the district in which he had taken shelter was,
  in some respects, the very worst for his purpose. Nevertheless, Peter Ruff,
  who believed, at the bottom of his heart, in his star, went on with his
  preparations feeling morally certain that Jean Lemaitre would sleep on the
  following night in his native land.</p>

  <p>At precisely the hour agreed upon, a small motor brougham pulled up
  outside the door of the Hotel de Flandres and its occupant&mdash;whom
  ninety-nine men out of a hundred would at once, unhesitatingly, have declared
  to be a doctor in moderate practice&mdash;pushed open the swing doors of the
  restaurant and made his way to the desk. He was of medium height; he wore a
  frock-coat&mdash;a little frayed; gray trousers which had not been recently
  pressed; and thick boots.</p>

  <p>"I understand that one of your waiters requires my attendance," he said,
  in a tone not unduly raised but still fairly audible. "I am Dr. Gilette."</p>

  <p>"Dr. Gilette," Antoine repeated, slowly.</p>

  <p>"And number Double-Four," the doctor murmured.</p>

  <p>Antoine descended from his desk.</p>

  <p>"But certainly, Monsieur!" he said. "The poor fellow declares that he
  suffers. If he is really ill, he must go. It sounds brutal, but what can one
  do? We have so few rooms here, and so much business. Monsieur will come this
  way?"</p>

  <p>Antoine led the way from the cafe into a very smelly region of narrow
  passages and steep stairs.</p>

  <p>"It is to be arranged?" Antoine whispered, as they ascended.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," the doctor answered. "Were there spies in the
  cafe?"</p>

  <p>"Two," Antoine answered.</p>

  <p>The doctor nodded, and said no more. He mounted to the third story.
  Antoine led him through a small sitting-room and knocked four times upon the
  door of an inner room. It suddenly was opened. A man&mdash;unshaven,
  terrified, with that nameless fear in his face which one sees reflected in
  the expression of some trapped animal&mdash;stood there looking out at
  them.</p>

  <p>"'Double-Four'!" the doctor said, softly. "Go back into the room, please.
  Antoine will kindly leave us."</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" the man gasped.</p>

  <p>"'Double-Four'!" the doctor answered. "Obey me, and be quick for your
  life! Strip!"</p>

  <p>The man obeyed.</p>

  <p>Barely twenty minutes later, the doctor&mdash;still carrying his
  bag&mdash;descended the stairs. He entered the cafe from a somewhat remote
  door. Antoine hurried to meet him, and walked by his side through the place.
  He asked many questions, but the doctor contented himself with shaking his
  head. Almost in silence he left Antoine, who conducted him even to the door
  of his motor. The proprietor of the cafe watched the brougham disappear, and
  then returned to his desk, sighing heavily.</p>

  <p>A man who had been sipping a liqueur dose at hand, laid down his
  paper.</p>

  <p>"One of your waiters ill, did I understand?" he asked. Monsieur Antoine
  was at once eloquent. It was the ill-fortune which had dogged him for the
  last four months! The man had been taken ill there in the restaurant. He was
  a Gascon&mdash;spoke no English&mdash;and had just arrived. It was not
  possible for him to be removed at the moment, so he had been carried to an
  empty bedroom. Then had come the doctor and forbidden his removal. Now for a
  week he had lain there and several of his other voyageurs had departed. One
  did not know how these things got about, but they spoke of infection. The
  doctor, who had just left&mdash;Dr. Gilette of Russell Square, a most famous
  physician&mdash;had assured him that there was no infection&mdash;no fear of
  any. But what did it matter&mdash;that? People were so hard to convince.
  Monsieur would like a cigar? But certainly! There were here some of the
  best.</p>

  <p>Antoine undid the cabinet and opened a box of Havanas. John Dory selected
  one and called for another liqueur.</p>

  <p>"You have trouble often with your waiters, I dare say," he remarked. "They
  tell me that all Frenchmen who break the law in their own country, find their
  way, sooner or later, to these parts. You have to take them without
  characters, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Antoine lifted his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"But what could one do?" he exclaimed. "Characters, they were easy enough
  to write&mdash;but were they worth the paper they were written on? Indeed
  no!"</p>

  <p>"Not only your waiters," Dory continued, "but those who stay in the hotels
  round here have sometimes an evil name."</p>

  <p>Antoine shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"For myself," he said, "I am particular. We have but a few rooms, but we
  are careful to whom we let them."</p>

  <p>"Do you keep a visitors' book?"</p>

  <p>"But no, Monsieur!" Antoine protested. "For why the necessity? There are
  so few who come to stay for more than the night&mdash;just now scarcely any
  one at all."</p>

  <p>There entered, at that moment, a tall, thin man dressed in dark clothes,
  who walked with his hands in his overcoat pockets, as though it were a habit.
  He came straight to Dory and handed him a piece of paper.</p>

  <p>John Dory glanced it through and rose to his feet. A gleam of satisfaction
  lit his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Antoine," he said, "I am sorry to cause you any inconvenience,
  but here is my card. I am a detective officer from Scotland Yard, and I have
  received information which compels me with your permission, to examine at
  once the sleeping apartments in your hotel."</p>

  <p>Antoine was fiercely indignant.</p>

  <p>"But, Monsieur!" he exclaimed. "I do not understand! Examine my rooms? But
  it is impossible! Who dares to say that I harbor criminals?"</p>

  <p>"I have information upon which I can rely," John Dory answered, firmly.
  "This comes from a man who is no friend of mine, but he is well-known. You
  can read for yourself what he says."</p>

  <p>Monsieur Antoine, with trembling fingers, took the piece of paper from
  John Dory's hands. It was addressed to&mdash;</p>

  <p class="letter">Mr. JOHN DORY, DETECTIVE:<br>
  If you wish to find Jean Lemaitre, search in the upper rooms of the Hotel de
  Flandres. I have certain information that he is to be found there.<br>
  PETER RUFF.</p>

  <p>"Never," Antoine declared, "will I suffer such an indignity!"</p>

  <p>Dory raised a police whistle to his lips.</p>

  <p>"You are foolish," he said. "Already there is a cordon of men about the
  place. If you refuse to conduct me upstairs I shall at once place you under
  arrest."</p>

  <p>Antoine, white with fear, poured himself out a liqueur of brandy.</p>

  <p>"Well, well," he said, "what must be done, then! Come!"</p>

  <p>He led the way out into that smelly network of passages, up the stairs to
  the first floor. Room after room he threw open and begged Dory to examine.
  Some of them were garishly furnished with gilt mirrors, cheap lace curtains
  tied back with blue ribbons. Others were dark, miserable holes, into which
  the fresh air seemed never to have penetrated. On the third floor they
  reached the little sitting-room, which bore more traces of occupation than
  some of the rooms below. Antoine would have passed on, but Dory stopped
  him.</p>

  <p>"There is a door there," he said. "We will try that."</p>

  <p>"It is the sick waiter who lies within," Antoine protested. "Monsieur can
  hear him groan."</p>

  <p>There was, indeed, something which sounded like a groan to be heard, but
  Dory was obstinate.</p>

  <p>"If he is so ill," he demanded, "how is he able to lock the door on the
  inside? Monsieur Antoine, that door must be opened."</p>

  <p>Antoine knocked at it softly.</p>

  <p>"Francois," he said, "there is another doctor here who would see you. Let
  us in."</p>

  <p>There was no answer, Antoine turned to his companion with a little shrug
  of the shoulders, as one who would say&mdash;"I have done my best. What would
  you have?"</p>

  <p>Dory put his shoulder to the door.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he shouted through the keyhole, "Mr. Sick Waiter, or whoever you
  are, if you do not unlock this door, I am coming in!"</p>

  <p>"I have no key," said a faint voice. "I am locked in. Please break open
  the door."</p>

  <p>"But that is not the Voice of Francois!" Antoine exclaimed, in
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"We'll soon see who it is," Dory answered.</p>

  <p>He charged at the door fiercely. At the third assault it gave way. They
  found themselves in a small back bedroom, and stretched on the floor, very
  pale, and apparently only half-conscious, lay Peter Ruff. There was a strong
  smell of chloroform about. John Dory threw open the window. His fingers
  trembled a little. It was like Fate&mdash;this! At the end of every
  unsuccessful effort there was this man&mdash;Peter Ruff!</p>

  <p>"What the devil are you doing here?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff groaned.</p>

  <p>"Help me up," he begged, "and give me a little brandy."</p>

  <p>Antoine set him in an easy-chair and rang the bell furiously.</p>

  <p>"It will come directly!" he exclaimed. "But who are you?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff waited for the brandy. When he had sipped it, he drew a little
  breath as though of relief.</p>

  <p>"I heard," he said, speaking still with an evident effort, "that Lemaitre
  was here. I had secret information. I thought at first that I would let you
  know&mdash;I sent you a note early this morning. Afterwards, I discovered
  that there was a reward, and I determined to track him down myself. He was in
  here hiding as a sick waiter. I do not think," Peter Ruff added, "that
  Monsieur Antoine had any idea. I presented myself as representing a
  charitable society, and I was shown here to visit him. He was too clever,
  though, was Jean Lemaitre&mdash;too quick for me."</p>

  <p>"You were a fool to come alone!" John Dory said. "Don't you know the man's
  record? How long ago did he leave?"</p>

  <p>"About ten minutes," Peter Ruff answered. "You must have missed him
  somewhere as you came up. I crawled to the window and I watched him go. He
  left the restaurant by the side entrance, and took a taxicab at the corner
  there. It went northward toward New Oxford Street."</p>

  <p>Dory turned on his heel&mdash;they heard him descending the stairs. Peter
  Ruff rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, as he plunged his head into a basin of water, and
  came into the middle of the room rubbing it vigorously with a small towel, "I
  am afraid that our friend John Dory will get to dislike me soon! He passed
  out unnoticed, eh, Antoine?"</p>

  <p>Antoine's face wore a look of great relief.</p>

  <p>"There was not a soul who looked," he said. "We passed under the nose of
  the gentleman from Scotland Yard. He sat there reading his paper; and he had
  no idea. I watched Jean step into the motor. Even by now he is well on his
  way southwards. Twice he changes from motor to train, and back. They will
  never trace him."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, who was looking amazingly better, sipped a further glass of
  liqueur. Together he and Antoine descended to the street.</p>

  <p>"Mind," Peter Ruff whispered, "I consider that accounts are squared
  between me and 'Double-Four' now. Let them know that. This sort of thing
  isn't in my line."</p>

  <p>"For an amateur," Antoine said, bowing low, "Monsieur commands my
  heartfelt congratulations!"</p>

  <h2>VIII. Mrs. BOGNOR'S STAR BOARDER</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Apr 1910</h3>

  <p class="first">In these days, the duties of Miss Brown as Peter Ruff's
  secretary had become multifarious. Together with the transcribing of a vast
  number of notes concerning cases, some of which he undertook and some of
  which he refused, she had also to keep his cash book, a note of his
  investments and a record of his social engagements. Notwithstanding all these
  demands upon her time, however, there were occasions when she found herself,
  of necessity, idle. In one of these she broached the subject which had often
  been in her mind. They were alone, and not expecting callers. Consequently,
  she sat upon the hearthrug and addressed her employer by his Christian
  name.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said softly, "do you remember the night when you came through
  the fog and burst into my little flat?"</p>

  <p>"Quite well," he answered, "but it is a subject to which I prefer that you
  do not allude."</p>

  <p>"I will be careful," she answered. "I only spoke of it for this reason.
  Before you left, when we were sitting together, you sketched out the career
  which you proposed for yourself. In many respects, I suppose, you have been
  highly successful, but I wonder if it has ever occurred to you that your work
  has not proceeded upon the lines which you first indicated?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I think I know what you mean," he said. "Go on."</p>

  <p>"That night," she murmured softly, "you spoke as a hunted man; you spoke
  as one at war with Society; you spoke as one who proposes almost a campaign
  against it. When you took your rooms here and called yourself Peter Ruff, it
  was rather in your mind to aid the criminal than to detect the crime. Fate
  seems to have decreed otherwise. Why, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>"Things have gone that way," Peter Ruff remarked.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you why," she continued. "It is because, at the bottom of
  your heart, there lurks a strong and unconquerable desire for respectability.
  In your heart you are on the side of the law and established things. You do
  not like crime; you do not like criminals. You do not like the idea of
  associating with them. You prefer the company of law-abiding people, even
  though their ways be narrow. It was part of that sentiment, Peter, which led
  you to fall in love with a coal-merchant's daughter. I can see that you will
  end your days in the halo of respectability."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was a little thoughtful. He scratched his chin and contemplated
  the tip of his faultless patent boot. Self-analysis interested him, and he
  recognized the truth of the girl's words.</p>

  <p>"You know, I am rather like that," he admitted. "When I see a family
  party, I envy them. When I hear of a man who has brothers and sisters and
  aunts and cousins, and gives family dinner-parties to family friends, I envy
  him. I do not care about the loose ends of life. I do not care about
  restaurant life, and ladies who transfer their regards with the same facility
  that they change their toilettes. You have very admirable powers of
  observation, Violet. You see me, I believe, as I really am."</p>

  <p>"That being so," she remarked, "what are you going to say to Sir Richard
  Dyson?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was frank.</p>

  <p>"Upon my soul," he answered, "I don't know!"</p>

  <p>"You'll have to make up your mind very soon," she reminded him. "He is
  coming here at twelve o'clock."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I shall wait until I hear what he has to say," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"His letter gave you a pretty clear hint," Violet said, "that it was
  something outside the law."</p>

  <p>"The law has many outposts," Peter Ruff said. "One can thread one's way in
  and out, if one knows the ropes. I don't like the man, but he introduced me
  to his tailor. I have never had any clothes like those he has made me."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"You are a vain little person," she said.</p>

  <p>"You are an impertinent young woman!" he answered. "Get back to your work.
  Don't you hear the lift stop?"</p>

  <p>She rose reluctantly, and resumed her place in front of her desk.</p>

  <p>"If it's risky," she whispered, leaning round towards him, "don't you take
  it on. I've heard one or two things about Sir Richard lately."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded. He, too, quitted his easy-chair, and took up a bundle
  of papers which lay upon his desk. There was a sharp tap at the door.</p>

  <p>"Come in!" he said.</p>

  <p>Sir Richard Dyson entered. He was dressed quietly, but with the perfect
  taste which was obviously an instinct with him, and he wore a big bunch of
  violets in his buttonhole. Nevertheless, the spring sunshine seemed to find
  out the lines in his face. His eyes were baggy&mdash;he had aged even within
  the last few months.</p>

  <p>"Well, Mr. Ruff," he said, shaking hands, "how goes it?"</p>

  <p>"I am very well, Sir Richard," Peter Ruff answered. "Please take a
  chair."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard took the easy-chair, and discovering a box of cigarettes upon
  the table, helped himself. Then his eyes fell upon Miss Brown.</p>

  <p>"Can't do without your secretary?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Impossible!" Peter Ruff answered. "As I told you before, I am her
  guarantee that what you say to me, or before her, is spoken as though to the
  dead."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard nodded.</p>

  <p>"Just as well," he remarked, "for I am going to talk about a man who I
  wish were dead!"</p>

  <p>"There are few of us," Peter Ruff said, "who have not our enemies."</p>

  <p>"Have you any experience of blackmailers?" Sir Richard asked.</p>

  <p>"In my profession," Peter Ruff answered, "I have come across such
  persons."</p>

  <p>"I have come to see you about one," Sir Richard proceeded. "Many years
  ago, there was a fellow in my regiment who went to the bad&mdash;never mind
  his name. He passes to-day as Ted Jones&mdash;that name will do as well as
  another. I am not," Sir Richard continued, "a good-natured man, but some
  devilish impulse prompted me to help that fellow. I gave him money three or
  four times. Somehow, I don't think it's a very good thing to give a man
  money. He doesn't value it&mdash;it comes too easily. He spends it and wants
  more."</p>

  <p>"There's a good deal of truth in what you say, Sir Richard," Peter Ruff
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"Our friend, for instance, wanted more," Sir Richard continued. "He came
  to me for it almost as a matter of course. I refused. He came again; I lost
  my temper and punched his head. Then his little game began."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"He had something to work upon, I suppose?" he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Most certainly he had," Sir Richard admitted. "If ever I achieved
  sufficient distinction in any branch of life to make it necessary that my
  biography should be written, I promise you that you would find it in many
  places a little highly colored. In other words, Mr. Ruff, I have not always
  adhered to the paths of righteousness."</p>

  <p>A faint smile flickered across Peter Ruff's face.</p>

  <p>"Sir Richard," he said, "your candor is admirable."</p>

  <p>"There was one time," Sir Richard continued, "when I was really on my last
  legs. It was just before I came into the baronetcy. I had borrowed every
  penny I could borrow. I was even hard put to it for a meal. I went to Paris,
  and I called myself by another man's name. I got introduced to a somewhat
  exclusive club there. My assumed name was a good one&mdash;it was the name,
  in fact, of a relative whom I somewhat resembled. I was accepted without
  question. I played cards, and I lost somewhere about eighteen thousand
  francs."</p>

  <p>"A sum," Peter Ruff remarked, "which you probably found it inconvenient to
  pay."</p>

  <p>"There was only one course," Sir Richard continued, "and I took it. I went
  back the next night and gave checks for the amount of my
  indebtedness&mdash;checks which had no more chance of being met than if I
  were to draw to-night upon the Bank of England for a million pounds. I went
  back, however, with another resolve. I was considered to have discharged my
  liabilities, and we played again. I rose a winner of something like sixty
  thousand francs. But I played to win, Mr. Ruff! Do you know what that
  means?"</p>

  <p>"You cheated!" Peter Ruff said, in an undertone.</p>

  <p>"Quite true," Sir Richard admitted. "I cheated! There was a scandal, and I
  disappeared. I had the money, and though my checks for the eighteen thousand
  francs were met, there was a considerable balance in my pocket when I escaped
  out of France. There was enough to take me out to America&mdash;big game
  shooting in the far West. No one ever associated me with the impostor who had
  robbed these young French noblemen&mdash;no one, that is to say, except the
  person who passes by the name of Teddy Jones."</p>

  <p>"How did he get to know?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"The story wouldn't interest you," Sir Richard answered. "He was in Paris
  at the time&mdash;we came across one another twice. He heard the scandal, and
  put two and two together. I shipped him off to Australia when I came into the
  title. He has come back. Lately, I can tell you, he has pretty well drained
  me dry. He has become a regular parasite a cold-blooded leech. He doesn't get
  drunk now. He looks after his health. I believe he even saves his, money.
  There's scarcely a week I don't hear from him. He keeps me a pauper. He has
  brought me at last to that state when I feel that there must be an
  ending!"</p>

  <p>"You have come to seek my help," Peter Ruff said, slowly. "From what you
  say about this man, I presume that he is not to be frightened?"</p>

  <p>"Not for a single moment," Sir Richard answered. "The law has no terrors
  for him. He is as slippery as an eel. He has his story pat. He even has his
  witnesses ready. I can assure you that Mr. Teddy Jones isn't by any means an
  ordinary sort of person."</p>

  <p>"He is not to be bluffed," Peter Ruff said, slowly; "he is not to be
  bribed. What remains?"</p>

  <p>"I have come here," Sir Richard said, "for your advice, Mr. Ruff."</p>

  <p>"The blackmailer," Peter Ruff said, "is a criminal."</p>

  <p>"He is a scoundrel!" Sir Richard assented.</p>

  <p>"He is not fit to live," Peter Ruff repeated.</p>

  <p>"He contaminates the world with every breath he draws!" Sir Richard
  assented.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Peter Ruff said, "you had better give me his address, and the
  name he goes under."</p>

  <p>"He lives at a boarding-house in Russell Street, Bloomsbury," Sir Richard
  said. "It is Mrs. Bognor's boarding-house. She calls it, I believe, the
  'American Home from Home.' The number is 17."</p>

  <p>"A boarding-house," Peter Ruff repeated, thoughtfully. "Makes it a little
  hard to get at him privately, doesn't it?"</p>

  <p>"Fling him a bait and he will come to you," Sir Richard answered. "He is
  an adventurer pure and simple, though perhaps you wouldn't believe it to look
  at him now. He has grown fat on the money he has wrung from me."</p>

  <p>"You had better leave the matter in my hands for a few days," Peter Ruff
  said. "I will have a talk with this gentleman and see whether he is really so
  unmanageable. If he is, there is, of course, only one way, and for that way,
  Sir Richard, you would have to pay a little high."</p>

  <p>"If I were to hear to-morrow," Sir Richard said quietly, "that Teddy Jones
  was dead, I would give five thousand pounds to the man who brought me the
  information!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"It would be worth that," he said&mdash;"quite! I will drop you a line in
  the course of the next few days."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard took up his hat, lit another of Peter Ruff's cigarettes, and
  departed. They heard the rattle of the lift as it descended. Then Miss Brown
  turned round in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Don't you do it, Peter!" she said solemnly. "The time has gone by for
  that sort of thing. The man may be unfit to live, but you don't need to risk
  as much as that for a matter of five thousand pounds."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he said; "quite right, Violet. At the same time, five
  thousand pounds is an excellent sum. We must see what can be done."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff's method of seeing what could be done was at first the very
  obvious one of seeking to discover any incidents in the past of the person
  known as Teddy Jones likely to reflect present discredit upon him if brought
  to light. From the first, it was quite clear that the career of this
  gentleman had been far from immaculate. His researches proved, beyond a
  doubt, that the gentleman in question had resorted, during the last ten or
  fifteen years, to many and very questionable methods of obtaining a living.
  At the same time, there was nothing which Peter Ruff felt that the man might
  not brazen out. His present mode of life seemed&mdash;on the surface, at any
  rate&mdash;to be beyond reproach. There was only one association which was
  distinctly questionable, and it was in this one direction, therefore, that
  Peter Ruff concentrated himself. The case, for some reason, interested him so
  much that he took a close and personal interest in it, and he was rewarded
  one day by discovering this enemy of Sir Richard's sitting, toward five
  o'clock in the afternoon, in a cafe in Regent Street, engrossed in
  conversation with a person whom Peter Ruff knew to be a very black sheep
  indeed&mdash;a man who had been tried for murder, and concerning whom there
  were still many unpleasant rumors. From behind his paper in a corner of the
  cafe, Peter Ruff watched these two men. Teddy Jones&mdash;or Major Edward
  Jones, as it seemed he was now called&mdash;was a person whose appearance no
  longer suggested the poverty against which he had been struggling most of his
  life. He was well dressed and tolerably well turned out. His face was a
  little puffy, and he had put on flesh during these days of his ease. His
  eyes, too, had a somewhat furtive expression, although his general deportment
  was one of braggadocio. Peter Ruff, quick always in his likes or dislikes,
  found the man repulsive from the start. He felt that he would have a genuine
  pleasure, apart from the matter of the five thousand pounds, in accelerating
  Major Jones's departure from a world which he certainly did not adorn.</p>

  <p>The two men conducted their conversation in a subdued tone, which made it
  quite impossible for Peter Ruff, in his somewhat distant corner, to overhear
  a single word of it. It was obvious, however, that they were not on the best
  of terms. Major Jones's companion was protesting, and apparently without
  success, against some course of action or speech of his companions. The
  conversation, on the other hand, never reached a quarrel, and the two men
  left the place together apparently on ordinary terms of friendliness. Peter
  Ruff at once quitted his seat and crossed the room toward the spot where they
  had been sitting. He dived under the table and picked up a newspaper&mdash;it
  was the only clue left to him as to the nature of their conversation. More
  than once, Major Jones who had, soon after their arrival, sent a waiter for
  it, had pointed to a certain paragraph as though to give weight to his
  statements. Peter Ruff had noticed the exact position of that paragraph. He
  smoothed out the paper and found it at once. It was an account of the murder
  of a wealthy old woman, living on the outskirts of a country village not far
  from London. Peter Ruff's face did not change as he called for another
  vermouth and read the description, slowly. Yet he was aware that he had
  possibly stumbled across the very thing for which he had searched so
  urgently! The particulars of the murder he already knew well, as at one time
  he had felt inclined to aid the police in their so far fruitless
  investigations. He therefore skipped the description of the tragedy, and
  devoted his attention to the last paragraph, toward which he fancied that the
  finger of Major Jones had been chiefly directed. It was a list of the stolen
  property, which consisted of jewelry, gold and notes to a very considerable
  amount. With the waiter's permission, he annexed the paper, cut out the list
  of articles with a sharp penknife, and placed it in his pocketbook before he
  left the cafe.</p>

  <p>In the course of some of the smaller cases with which Peter Ruff had been
  from time to time connected, he had more than once come into contact with the
  authorities at Scotland Yard, and he had several acquaintances
  there&mdash;not including Mr. John Dory&mdash;to whom, at times, he had given
  valuable information. For the first time, he now sought some return for his
  many courtesies. He drove straight from the cafe to the office of the Chief
  of the Criminal Investigation Department. The questions he asked there were
  only two, but they were promptly and courteously answered. Peter Ruff left
  the building and drove back to his rooms in a somewhat congratulatory frame
  of mind. After all, it was chance which was the chief factor in the solution
  of so many of these cases! Often he had won less success after months of
  untiring effort than he had gained during that few minutes in the cafe in
  Regent Street.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff became an inmate of that very select boarding-house carried on
  by Mrs. Bognor at number 17 Russell Street, Bloomsbury. He arrived with a
  steamer trunk, an elaborate traveling-bag and a dressing-case; took the best
  vacant room in the house, and dressed for dinner. Mrs. Bognor looked upon him
  as a valuable addition to her clientele, and introduced him freely to her
  other guests. Among these was Major Edward Jones. Major Jones sat at Mrs.
  Bognor's right hand, and was evidently the show guest of the boarding-house.
  Peter Ruff, without the least desire to attack his position, sat upon her
  left and monopolized the conversation. On the third night it turned, by
  chance, upon precious stones. Peter Ruff drew a little chamois leather bag
  from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that my tastes are peculiar. I have been in the
  East, and I have seen very many precious stones in their uncut state. To my
  mind, there is nothing to be compared with opals. These are a few I brought
  home from India. Perhaps you would like to look at them, Mrs. Bognor."</p>

  <p>They were passed round, amidst a little chorus of admiration.</p>

  <p>"The large one with the blue fire," Peter Ruff remarked, "is, I think,
  remarkably beautiful. I have never seen a stone quite like it."</p>

  <p>"It is wonderful!" murmured the young lady who was sitting at Major
  Jones's right hand. "What a fortunate man you are, Mr. Ruff, to have such a
  collection of treasures!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff bowed across the table. Major Jones, who was beginning to feel
  that his position as show guest was in danger, thrust his hand into his
  waistcoat pocket and produced a lady's ring, in which was set a single
  opal.</p>

  <p>"Very pretty stones," he remarked carelessly, "but I can't say I am very
  fond of them. Here's one that belonged to my sister, and my grandmother
  before her. I have it in my pocket because I was thinking of having the stone
  reset and making a present of it to a friend of mine."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff's popularity waned&mdash;he had said nothing about making a
  present to any one of even the most insignificant of his opals! And the one
  which Major Jones now handed round was certainly a magnificent stone. Peter
  Ruff examined it with the rest, and under the pretext of studying the
  setting, gazed steadfastly at the inside through his eyeglass. Major Jones,
  from the other side of the table, frowned, and held out his hand for the
  ring.</p>

  <p>"A very beautiful stone indeed!" Peter Ruff declared, passing it across
  the tablecloth. "Really, I do not think that there is one in my little
  collection to be compared with it. Have you many treasures like this, Major
  Jones?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, a few!" the Major answered carelessly, "family heirlooms, most of
  them."</p>

  <p>"You will have to give me the ring, Major Jones," the young lady on his
  right remarked archly. "It's bad luck, you know, to give it to any one who is
  not born in October, and my birthday is on the twelfth."</p>

  <p>"My dear Miss Levey," Major Jones answered, whispering in her ear, "more
  unlikely things have happened than that I should beg your acceptance of this
  little trifle."</p>

  <p>"Sooner or later," Peter Ruff said genially, "I should like to have a
  little conversation with you, Major. I fancy that we ought to be able to find
  plenty of subjects of common interest."</p>

  <p>"Delighted, I'm sure!" the latter answered, utterly unsuspicious. "Shall
  we go into the smoking-room now, or would you rather play a rubber
  first?"</p>

  <p>"If it is all the same to you," Peter Ruff said, "I think we will have a
  cigar first. There will be plenty of time for bridge afterwards."</p>

  <p>"May I offer you a cigar, sir?" Major Jones inquired, passing across a
  well-filled case.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid, Major," he said, "that there is scarcely time. You see, I
  have a warrant in my pocket for your arrest, and I am afraid that by the time
  we got to the station&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Major Jones leaned forward in his chair. He gripped the sides tightly with
  both hands. His eyes seemed to be protruding from his head.</p>

  <p>"For my what?" he exclaimed, in a tone of horror.</p>

  <p>"For your arrest," Peter Ruff explained calmly. "Surely you must have been
  expecting it! During all these years you must have grown used to expecting it
  at every moment!"</p>

  <p>Major Jones collapsed. He looked at Ruff as one might look at a man who
  has taken leave of his senses. Yet underneath it all was the coward's
  fear!</p>

  <p>"What are you talking about, man?" he exclaimed. "What do you mean? Lower
  your voice, for heaven's sake! Consider my position here! Some one might
  overhear! If this is a joke, let me tell you that it's a d&mdash;&mdash;d
  foolish one!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish," he said, "to create a disturbance&mdash;my manner of
  coming here should have assured you of that. At the same time, business is
  business. I hold a warrant for your arrest, and I am forced to execute
  it."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that you are a detective, then?" Major Jones demanded.</p>

  <p>He was a big man, but his voice seemed to have grown very small
  indeed.</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Peter Ruff answered. "I should not come here without
  authority."</p>

  <p>"What is the charge?" the other man faltered.</p>

  <p>"Blackmail," Peter Ruff said slowly. "The information against you is
  lodged by Sir Richard Dyson."</p>

  <p>It seemed to Peter Ruff, who was watching his companion closely, that a
  wave of relief passed over the face of the man who sat cowering in his chair.
  He certainly drew a little gasp&mdash;stretched out his hands, as though to
  thrust the shadow of some fear from him. His voice, when he spoke, was
  stronger. Some faint show of courage was returning to him.</p>

  <p>"There is some ridiculous mistake," he declared. "Let us talk this over
  like sensible men, Mr. Ruff. If you will wait until I have spoken to Sir
  Richard, I can promise you that the warrant shall be withdrawn, and that you
  shall not be the loser."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid it is too late for anything of that sort," Peter Ruff said.
  "Sir Richard's patience has been completely exhausted by your repeated
  demands."</p>

  <p>"He never told me so," Major Jones whined. "I quite thought that he was
  always glad to help an old friend. As a matter of fact, I had not meant to
  ask him for anything else. The last few hundreds I had from him was to have
  closed the thing up. It was the end."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "it was not the end! It never would have been the end! Sir
  Richard sought my advice, and I gave it him without hesitation. Sooner or
  later, I told him, he would have to adopt different measures. I convinced
  him. I represent those measures!"</p>

  <p>"But the matter can be arranged," Major Jones insisted, with a little
  shudder, "I am perfectly certain it can be arranged. Mr. Ruff, you are not an
  ordinary police officer&mdash;I am sure of that. Give me a chance of having
  an interview with Sir Richard before anything more is done. I will satisfy
  him, I promise you that. Why, if we leave the place together like this, every
  one here will get to know about it!"</p>

  <p>"Be reasonable," Peter Ruff answered. "Of course everyone will get to know
  about it! Blackmailing cases always excite a considerable amount of interest.
  Your photograph will probably be in the Daily Mirror tomorrow or the next
  day. In the meantime, I must trouble you to pay your respects to Mrs. Bognor
  and to come with me."</p>

  <p>"To Sir Richard's house?" Major Jones asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"To the police-stations," Peter Ruff answered.</p>

  <p>Major Jones did not rise. He sat for a few moments with his head buried in
  his hands.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ruff," he said hoarsely, "listen to me. I have been fortunate lately
  in some investments. I am not so poor as I was. I have my check-book in my
  pocket, and a larger balance in the bank now than I have ever had before. If
  I write you a check for, say, a hundred&mdash;no, two!&mdash;five!" he cried,
  desperately, watching Peter Ruff's unchanging face&mdash;"five hundred
  pounds, will you come round with me to Sir Richard's house in a hansom at
  once?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Five thousand pounds would not buy your liberty from me, Major Jones," he
  said.</p>

  <p>The man became abject.</p>

  <p>"Have pity, then," he pleaded. "My health is not good&mdash;I couldn't
  stand imprisonment. Think of what it means to a man of my age suddenly to
  leave everything worth having in life just because he may have imposed a
  little on the generosity of a friend! Think how you would feel, and be
  merciful!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head slowly. His face was immovable, but there was a
  look in his eyes from which the other man shrank.</p>

  <p>"Major Jones," he said, "you ask me be merciful. You appeal to my pity.
  For such as you I have no pity, nor have I ever shown any mercy. You know
  very well, and I know, that when once the hand of the law touches your
  shoulder, it will not be only a charge o' blackmail which the police will
  bring against you!"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing else&mdash;nothing else!" he cried. "Take half my
  fortune, Mr. Ruff. Let me get away. Give me a chance&mdash;just a sporting
  chance!"</p>

  <p>"I wonder," Peter Ruff said, "what chance that poor old lady in Weston
  had? No, I am not saying you murdered her. You never had the pluck. Your
  confederate did that, and you handled the booty. What were the initials
  inside that ring you showed us to-night, Major Jones?"</p>

  <p>"Let me go to my bedroom," he said, in a strange, far-away tone. "You can
  come with me and stand outside."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff assented.</p>

  <p>"To save scandal," he said, "yes!"</p>

  <p>Three flights of stairs they climbed. When at last they reached the door,
  the trembling man made one last appeal.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ruff," he said, "have a little mercy. Give me an hour's
  start&mdash;just a chance for my life!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff pushed him in the door.</p>

  <p>"I am not a hard man," he said, "but I keep my mercy for men!"</p>

  <p>He took the key from the inside of the door, locked it, and with the key
  in his pocket descended to the drawing-room. The young lady who had sat on
  Major Jones's right was singing a ballad. Suddenly she paused in the middle
  of her song. The four people who were playing bridge looked up. Mrs. Bognor
  screamed.</p>

  <p>"What was that?" she asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"It sounded," Peter Ruff said, "very much like revolver shot."</p>

  <p>"I see," Sir Richard remarked, with a queer look in his eyes, as he handed
  over a roll of notes to Peter Ruff, "the jury brought it in 'Suicide'! What I
  can't understand is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't try," Peter Ruff interrupted briskly. "It isn't in the bond that
  you should understand."</p>

  <p>Sir Richard helped himself to a drink. A great burden had passed from his
  shoulders, but he was not feeling at his best that morning. He could scarcely
  keep his eyes from Peter Ruff.</p>

  <p>"Ruff," he said, "I have known you some time, and I have known you to be a
  square man. I have known you to do good-natured actions. I came to you in
  desperation but I scarcely expected this!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff emptied his own tumbler and took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"Sir Richard," he said, "you are like a good many other people. Now that
  the thing is done, you shrink from the thought of it. You even wonder how I
  could have planned to bring about the death of this man. Listen, Sir Richard.
  Pity for the deserving, or for those who have in them one single quality, one
  single grain, of good, is a sentiment which deserves respect. Pity for
  vermin, who crawl about the world leaving a poisonous trail upon everything
  they touch, is a false and unnatural sentiment. For every hopelessly corrupt
  man who is induced to quit this life there is a more deserving one, somewhere
  or other, for whom the world is a better place."</p>

  <p>"So that, after all, you are a philanthropist, Mr. Ruff," Sir Richard
  said, with a forced smile.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"A philosopher," he answered, buttoning up his notes.</p>

  <h2>IX. THE PERFIDY OF MISS BROWN</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), May 1910</h3>

  <p class="first">Peter Ruff came down to his office with a single letter in
  his hand, bearing a French postmark. He returned his secretary's morning
  greeting a little absently, and seated himself at his desk.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he asked, "have you ever been to Paris?"</p>

  <p>She looked at him compassionately.</p>

  <p>"More times than you, I think, Peter," she answered.</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"That," he exclaimed, "is very possible! Could you get ready to leave by
  the two-twenty this afternoon?"</p>

  <p>"What, alone?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"No&mdash;with me," he answered.</p>

  <p>She shut down her desk with a bang.</p>

  <p>"Of course I can!" she exclaimed. "What a spree!"</p>

  <p>Then she caught sight of a certain expression on Peter Ruff's face, and
  she looked at him wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Is anything wrong, Peter?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "I cannot say that anything is wrong. I have had an
  invitation to present myself before a certain society in Paris of which you
  have some indirect knowledge. What the summons means I cannot say."</p>

  <p>"Yet you go?" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I go," he answered. "I have no choice. If I waited here twenty-four
  hours, I should hear of it."</p>

  <p>"They can have nothing against you," she said. "On the contrary, the only
  time they have appealed for your aid, you gave it&mdash;very valuable aid it
  must have been, too."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I cannot see," he admitted, "what they can have against me. And yet,
  somehow, the wording of my invitation seemed to me a little ominous.
  Perhaps," he added, walking to the window and standing looking out for a
  moment, "I have a liver this morning. I am depressed. Violet, what does it
  mean when you are depressed?"</p>

  <p>"Shall you wear your gray clothes for traveling?" she asked, a little
  irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"I have not made up my mind," Peter Ruff answered. "I thought of wearing
  my brown, with a brown overcoat. What do you suggest?"</p>

  <p>"I like you in brown," she answered, simply. "I should change, if I were
  you."</p>

  <p>He smiled faintly.</p>

  <p>"I believe," he said, "that you have a sort of superstition that as I
  change my clothes I change my humors."</p>

  <p>"Should I be so very far wrong?" she asked. "Don't think that I am
  laughing at you, Peter. The greatest men in the world have had their
  foibles."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff frowned.</p>

  <p>"We shall be away for several days," he said. "Be sure that you take some
  wraps. It will be cold, crossing."</p>

  <p>"Are you going to close the office altogether?" she asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"Put up a notice," he said&mdash;"'Back on Friday.' Pack up your books and
  take them round to the Bank before you leave. The lift man will call you a
  taxi-cab."</p>

  <p>He watched her preparations with a sort of gloomy calm.</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd tell me what is the matter with you?" she asked, as she
  turned to follow her belongings.</p>

  <p>"I do not know," Peter Ruff said. "I, suppose I am suffering from what you
  would call presentiments. Be at Charing-Cross punctually."</p>

  <p>"Why do you go at all?" she asked. "These people are of no further use to
  you. Only the other day, you were saying that you should not accept any more
  outside cases."</p>

  <p>"I must go," Peter Ruff answered. "I am not afraid of many things, but I
  should be afraid of disobeying this letter."</p>

  <p>They had a comfortable journey down, a cool, bright crossing, and found
  their places duly reserved for them in the French train. Miss Brown, in her
  neat traveling clothes and furs, was conscious of looking her best, and she
  did all that was possible to entertain her traveling companion. But Peter
  Ruff seemed like a man who labors under some sense of apprehension. He had
  faced death more than once during the last few years&mdash;faced it without
  flinching, and with a certain cool disregard which can only come from the
  highest sort of courage. Yet he knew, when he read over again in the train
  that brief summons which he was on his way to obey, that he had passed under
  the shadow of some new and indefinable fear. He was perfectly well aware,
  too, that both on the steamer and on the French train he was carefully
  shadowed. This fact, however, did not surprise him. He even went out of his
  way to enter into conversation with one of the two men whose furtive glances
  into their compartment and whose constant proximity had first attracted his
  attention. The man was civil but vague. Nevertheless, when they took their
  places in the dining-car, they found the two men at the next table. Peter
  Ruff pointed them out to his companion.</p>

  <p>"'Double-Fours'!" he whispered. "Don't you feel like a criminal?"</p>

  <p>She laughed, and they took no more notice of the men. But as the train
  drew near Paris, he felt some return of the depression which had troubled him
  during the earlier part of the day. He felt a sense of comfort in his
  companion's presence which was a thing utterly strange to him. On the other
  hand, he was conscious of a certain regret that he had brought her with him
  into an adventure of which he could not foresee the end.</p>

  <p>The lights of Paris flashed around them&mdash;the train was gradually
  slackening speed. Peter Ruff, with a sigh, began to collect their
  belongings.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "I ought not to have brought you." Something in his
  voice puzzled her. There had been every few times, during all the years she
  had known him, when she had been able to detect anything approaching
  sentiment in his tone&mdash;and those few times had been when he had spoken
  of another woman.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff looked out into the blackness, through the glittering arc of
  lights, and perhaps for once he suffered his fancy to build for him visions
  of things that were not of earth. If so, however, it was a moment which
  swiftly passed. His reply was in a tone as matter of fact as his usual
  speech.</p>

  <p>"Because," he said, "I do not exactly see the end of my present
  expedition&mdash;I do not understand its object."</p>

  <p>"You have some apprehension?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"None at all," he answered. "Why should I? There is an unwritten bargain,"
  he added, a little more slowly, "to which I subscribed with our friends here,
  and I have certainly kept it. In fact, the balance is on my side. There is
  nothing for me to fear."</p>

  <p>The train crept into the Gare du Nord, and they passed through the usual
  routine of the Customs House. Then, in an omnibus, they rumbled slowly over
  the cobblestones, through the region of barely lit streets and untidy cafes,
  down the Rue Lafayette, across the famous Square and into the Rue de
  Rivoli.</p>

  <p>"Our movements," Peter Ruff remarked dryly, "are too well known for us to
  attempt to conceal them. We may as well stop at one of the large hotels. It
  will be more cheerful for you while I am away."</p>

  <p>They engaged rooms at the Continental. Miss Brown, whose apartments were
  in the wing of the hotel overlooking the gardens, ascended at once to her
  room. Peter Ruff, who had chosen a small suite on the other side, went into
  the bar for a whiskey and soda. A man touched him on the elbow.</p>

  <p>"For Monsieur," he murmured, and vanished.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff turned and opened the note. It bore a faint perfume, it had a
  coronet upon the flap of the envelope, and it was written in a delicate
  feminine handwriting.</p>

  <p class="letter">DEAR Mr. RUFF:&mdash; If you are not too tired with your
  journey, will you call soon after one o'clock to meet some old
  friends?&mdash; BLANCHE DE MAUPASSIM.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff drank his whiskey and soda, went up to his rooms, and made a
  careful toilet. Then he sent a page up for Violet, who came down within a few
  minutes. She was dressed with apparent simplicity in a high-necked gown, a
  large hat, and a single rope of pearls. In place of the usual gold purse, she
  carried a small white satin bag, exquisitely hand-painted. Everything about
  her bespoke that elegant restraint so much a feature of the Parisian woman of
  fashion herself. Peter Ruff, who had told her to prepare for supping out, was
  at first struck by the simplicity of her attire. Afterwards, he came to
  appreciate its perfection.</p>

  <p>They went to the Cafe de Paris, where they were the first arrivals.
  People, however, began to stream in before they had finished their meal, and
  Peter Ruff, comparing his companion's appearance with the more flamboyant
  charms of these ladies from the Opera and the theatres, began to understand
  the numerous glances of admiration which the impressionable Frenchmen so
  often turned in their direction. There was between them, toward the end of
  the meal, something which amounted almost to nervousness.</p>

  <p>"You are going to keep your appointment to-night, Peter?" his companion
  asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"As soon as I have taken you home," he said. "I shall probably return
  late, so we will breakfast here to-morrow morning, if you like, at half-past
  twelve. I will send a note to your room when I am ready."</p>

  <p>She looked him in the eyes.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "supposing that note doesn't come!"</p>

  <p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"My dear Violet," he said, "you and I&mdash;or rather I, for you are not
  concerned in this&mdash;live a life which is a little different from the
  lives of most of the people around us. The million pay their taxes, and they
  expect police protection in times of danger. For me there is no such
  resource. My life has its own splendid compensations. I have weapons with
  which to fight any ordinary danger. What I want to explain to you is
  this&mdash;that if you hear no more of me, you can do nothing. If that note
  does not come to you in the morning, you can do nothing. Wait here for three
  days, and after that go back to England. You will find a letter on your desk,
  telling you there exactly what to do."</p>

  <p>"You have something in your mind," she said, "of which you have not told
  me."</p>

  <p>"I have nothing," he answered, firmly. "Upon my honor, I know of no
  possible cause of offense which our friends could have against me. Their
  summons is, I will admit, somewhat extraordinary, but I go to obey it
  absolutely without fear. You can sleep well, Violet. We lunch here to-morrow,
  without a doubt."</p>

  <p>They drove back to the hotel almost in silence. Violet was looking fixedly
  out of the window of the taxicab, as though interested in watching the crowds
  upon the street. Peter Ruff appeared to be absorbed in his own thoughts. Yet
  perhaps they were both of them nearer to one another than either surmised.
  Their parting in the hall of the Continental Hotel was unemotional enough.
  For a moment Peter Ruff had hesitated while her hand had lain in his. He had
  opened his lips as though he had something to say. Her eyes grew suddenly
  softer&mdash;seemed to seek his as though begging for those unspoken words.
  But Peter Ruff did not say them then.</p>

  <p>"I shall be back all right," he said. "Good night, Violet! Sleep
  well!"</p>

  <p>He turned back towards the waiting taxicab.</p>

  <p>"Number 16, Rue de St. Quintaine," he told the man. It was not a long
  ride. In less than a quarter of an hour, Peter Ruff presented himself before
  a handsome white house in a quiet, aristocratic-looking street. At his
  summons, the postern door flew open, and a man-servant in plain livery stood
  at the second entrance.</p>

  <p>"Madame la Marquise?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>The man bowed in silence, and took the visitor's hat and overcoat. He
  passed along a spacious hall and into a delightfully furnished reception
  room, where an old lady with gray hair sat in the midst of a little circle of
  men. Peter Ruff stood, for a moment, upon the threshold, looking around him.
  She held out her hands.</p>

  <p>"It is Monsieur Peter Ruff, is it not? At last, then, I am gratified. I
  have wished for so long to see one who has become so famous."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff took her hands in his and raised them gallantly to his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said, "this is a pleasure indeed. At my last visit here, you
  were in Italy."</p>

  <p>"I grow old," she answered. "I leave Paris but little now. Where one has
  lived, one should at least be content to die."</p>

  <p>"Madame speaks a philosophy," Peter Ruff answered, "which as yet she has
  no need to learn."</p>

  <p>The old lady turned to a man who stood upon her right:</p>

  <p>"And this from an Englishman!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>There were others who took Peter Ruff by the hand then. The servants were
  handing round coffee in little Sevres cups. On the sideboard was a choice of
  liqueurs and bottles of wine. Peter Ruff found himself hospitably entertained
  with both small talk and refreshments. But every now and then his eyes
  wandered back to where Madame sat in her chair, her hair as white as
  snow&mdash;beautiful still, in spite of the cruel mouth and the narrow
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"She is wonderful!" he murmured to a man who stood by his side.</p>

  <p>"She is eighty-six," was the answer in a whisper, "and she knows
  everything."</p>

  <p>As the clock struck two, a tall footman entered the room and wheeled
  Madame's chair away. Several of the guests left at the same time. Ruff, when
  the door was closed, counted those who remained. As he had imagined would be
  the case, he found that there were eight.</p>

  <p>A tall, gray-bearded man, who from the first had attached himself to Ruff,
  and who seemed to act as a sort of master of ceremonies, now approached him
  once more and laid his hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Mon ami," he said, "we will now discuss, if it pleases you, the little
  matter concerning which we took the liberty of asking you to favor us with a
  visit."</p>

  <p>"What, here?" Peter Ruff asked, in some surprise.</p>

  <p>His friend, who had introduced himself as Monsieur de Founcelles,
  smiled.</p>

  <p>"But why not?" he asked. "Ah, but I think I understand!" he added, almost
  immediately. "You are English, Monsieur Peter Ruff, and in some respects you
  have not moved with the times. Confess, now, that your idea of a secret
  society is a collection of strangely attired men who meet in a cellar, and
  build subterranean passages in case of surprise. In Paris, I think, we have
  gone beyond that sort of thing. We of the 'Double-Four' have no headquarters
  save the drawing-room of Madame; no hiding-places whatsoever; no
  meeting-places save the fashionable cafes or our own reception rooms. The
  police follow us&mdash;what can they discover?&mdash;nothing! What is there
  to discover?&mdash;nothing! Our lives are lived before the eyes of all Paris.
  There is never any suspicion of mystery about any of our movements. We have
  our hobbies, and we indulge in them. Monsieur the Marquis de Sogrange here is
  a great sportsman. Monsieur le Comte owns many racehorses. I myself am an
  authority on pictures, and own a collection which I have bequeathed to the
  State. Paris knows us well as men of fashion and mark&mdash;Paris does not
  guess that we have perfected an organization so wonderful that the whole
  criminal world pays toll to us."</p>

  <p>"Dear me," Peter Ruff said, "this is very interesting!"</p>

  <p>"We have a trained army at our disposal," Monsieur de Founcelles
  continued, "who numerically, as well as in intelligence, outnumber the whole
  force of gendarmes in Paris. No criminal from any other country can settle
  down here and hope for success, unless he joins us. An exploit which is
  inspired by us cannot fail. Our agents may count on our protection, and
  receive it without question."</p>

  <p>"I am bewildered," Peter Ruff said, frankly. "I do not understand how you
  gentlemen&mdash;whom one knows by name so well as patrons of sport and
  society, can spare the time for affairs of such importance."</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles nodded.</p>

  <p>"We have very valuable aid," he said. "There is below us&mdash;the
  'Double-Four'&mdash;the eight gentlemen now present, an executive council
  composed of five of the shrewdest men in France. They take their orders from
  us. We plan, and they obey. We have imagination, and special sources of
  knowledge. They have the most perfect machinery for carrying out our schemes
  that it is possible to imagine. I do not wish to boast, Mr. Ruff, but if I
  take a directory of Paris and place after any man's name, whatever his
  standing or estate, a black cross, that man dies before seven days have
  passed. You buy your evening paper&mdash;a man has committed suicide! You
  read of a letter found by his side: an unfortunate love affair&mdash;a tale
  of jealousy or reckless speculation. Mr. Ruff, the majority of these
  explanations are false. They are invented and arranged for by us. This year
  alone, five men in Paris, of position, have been found dead, and accounted,
  for excellent reasons, suicides. In each one of these cases, Monsieur Ruff,
  although not a soul has a suspicion of it, the removal of these men was
  arranged for by the' Double-Four.'"</p>

  <p>"I trust," Peter Ruff said, "that it may never be my ill-fortune to incur
  the displeasure of so marvelous an association."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, Monsieur Ruff," the other answered, "the attention of
  the association has been directed towards certain incidents of your career in
  a most favorable manner. We have spoken of you often lately, Mr. Ruff,
  between ourselves. We arrive now at the object for which we begged the honor
  of your visit. It is to offer you the Presidency of our Executive
  Council."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff had thought of many things, but he had not thought of this! He
  gasped, recovered himself, and realized at once the dangers of the position
  in which he stood.</p>

  <p>"The Council of Five!" he said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Precisely," Monsieur de Founcelles replied. "The salary&mdash;forgive me
  for giving such prominence to a matter which you doubtless consider of
  secondary importance&mdash;is ten thousand pounds a year, with a residence
  here and in London&mdash;also servants."</p>

  <p>"It is princely!" Peter Ruff declared. "I cannot imagine, Monsieur, how
  you could have believed me capable of filling such a position."</p>

  <p>"There is not much about you, Mr. Ruff, which we do not know," Monsieur de
  Founcelles answered. "There are points about your career which we have marked
  with admiration. Your work over here was rapid and comprehensive. We know all
  about your checkmating the Count von Hern and the Comtesse de Pilitz. We have
  appealed to you for aid once only&mdash;your response was prompt and
  brilliant. You have all the qualifications we desire. You are still young,
  physically you are sound, you speak all languages, and you are
  unmarried."</p>

  <p>"I am what?" Peter Ruff asked, with a start.</p>

  <p>"A bachelor," Monsieur de Founcelles answered. "We who have made crime and
  its detection a life-long study, have reduced many matters concerning it to
  almost mathematical exactitude. Of one thing we have become absolutely
  convinced&mdash;it is that the great majority of cases in which the police
  triumph are due to the treachery of women. The criminal who steers clear of
  the other sex escapes a greater danger than the detectives who dog his heels.
  It is for that reason that we choose only unmarried men for our executive
  council."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff made a gesture of despair. "And I am to be married in a month!"
  he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of dismay. If those other seven men had not once
  intervened, it was because the conduct of the affair had been voted into the
  hands of Monsieur de Founcelles, and there was little which he had left
  unsaid. Nevertheless, they had formed a little circle around the two men.
  Every word passing between them had been listened to eagerly. Gestures and
  murmured exclamations had been frequent enough. There arose now a chorus of
  voices which their leader had some difficulty in silencing.</p>

  <p>"It must be arranged!"</p>

  <p>"But it is impossible&mdash;this!"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Ruff amuses himself with us!"</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," Peter Ruff said, "I can assure you that I do nothing of the
  sort. The affair was arranged some months ago, and the young lady is even now
  in Paris, purchasing her trousseau."</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles, with a wave of the hand, commanded silence. There
  was probably a way out. In any case, one must be found.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur Ruff," he said, "putting aside, for one moment, your sense of
  honor, which of course forbids you even to consider the possibility of
  breaking your word&mdash;supposing that the young lady herself should
  withdraw&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You don't know Miss Brown!" Peter Ruff interrupted. "It is a pleasure to
  which I hope to attain," Monsieur de Founcelles declared, smoothly. "Let us
  consider once more my proposition. I take it for granted that, apart from
  this threatened complication, you find it agreeable?"</p>

  <p>"I am deeply honored by it," Peter Ruff declared.</p>

  <p>"Well, that being so," Monsieur de Founcelles said, more cheerfully, "we
  must see whether we cannot help you. Tell me, who is this fortunate young
  lady&mdash;this Miss Brown?"</p>

  <p>"She is a young person of good birth and some means," Peter Ruff declared.
  "She is, in a small way, an actress; she has also been my secretary from the
  first." Monsieur de Founcelles nodded his head thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Ah!" he said. "She knows your secrets, then, I presume?"</p>

  <p>"She does," Peter Ruff assented. "She knows a great deal!"</p>

  <p>"A young person to be conciliated by all means," Monsieur de Founcelles
  declared. "Well, we must see. When, Monsieur Ruff, may I have the opportunity
  of making the acquaintance of this young lady?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning, or rather this morning, if you will," Peter Ruff
  answered. "We are taking breakfast together at the cafe de Paris. It will
  give me great pleasure if you will join us."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," Monsieur de Founcelles declared, "I must beg of you
  slightly to alter your plans. I will ask you and Mademoiselle to do me the
  honor of breakfasting at the Ritz with the Marquis de Sogrange and myself, at
  the same hour. We shall find there more opportunity for a short
  discussion."</p>

  <p>"I am entirely at your service," Peter Ruff answered. There were signs now
  of a breaking-up of the little party.</p>

  <p>"We must all regret, dear Monsieur Ruff," Monsieur de Founcelles said, as
  he made his adieux, "this temporary obstruction to the consummation of our
  hopes. Let us pray that Mademoiselle will not be unreasonable."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," Peter Ruff murmured.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff drove through the gray dawn to his hotel, in the splendid
  automobile of Monsieur de Founcelles, whose homeward route lay in that
  direction. It was four o'clock when he accepted his key from a sleepy-looking
  clerk, and turned towards the staircase. The hotel was wrapped in semi-gloom.
  Sweepers and cleaners were at work. The palms had been turned out into the
  courtyard. Dust sheets lay over the furniture. One person only, save himself
  and the untidy-looking servants, was astir. From a distant corner which
  commanded the entrance, he saw Violet stealing away to the corridor which led
  to her part of the hotel. She had sat there all through the night to see him
  come in&mdash;to be assured of his safety! Peter Ruff stared after her
  disappearing figure as one might have watched a ghost.</p>

  <p>The luncheon-party was a great success. Peter Ruff was human enough to be
  proud of his companion&mdash;proud of her smartness, which was indubitable
  even here, surrounded as they were by Frenchwomen of the best class; proud of
  her accent, of the admiration which she obviously excited in the two
  Frenchmen. His earlier enjoyment of the meal was a little clouded from the
  fact that he felt himself utterly outshone in the matter of general
  appearance. No tailor had ever suggested to him a coat so daring and yet so
  perfect as that which adorned the person of the Marquis de Sogrange. The deep
  violet of his tie was a shade unknown in Bond Street&mdash;inimitable&mdash;a
  true education in color. They had the bearing, too, these Frenchmen! He
  watched Monsieur de Founcelles bending over Violet, and he was suddenly
  conscious of a wholly new sensation. He did not recognize&mdash;could not
  even classify it. He only knew that it was not altogether pleasant, and that
  it set the warm blood tingling through his veins.</p>

  <p>It was not until they were sitting out in the winter garden, taking their
  coffee and liqueurs, that the object of their meeting was referred to. Then
  Monsieur de Founcelles drew Violet a little away from the others, and the
  Marquis, with a meaning smile, took Peter Ruff's arm and led him on one side.
  Monsieur de Founcelles wasted no words at all.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "Monsieur Ruff has doubtless told you that last
  night I made him the offer of a great position among us."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with twinkling eyes.</p>

  <p>"Go on, please," she said.</p>

  <p>"I offered him a position of great dignity&mdash;of great responsibility,"
  Monsieur de Founcelles continued. "I cannot explain to you its exact nature,
  but it is in connection with the most wonderful organization of its sort
  which the world has ever known."</p>

  <p>"The 'Double-Four,'" she murmured.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"Attached to the post is a princely salary and but one condition,"
  Monsieur de Founcelles said, watching the girl's face. "The condition is that
  Mr. Ruff remains a bachelor."</p>

  <p>Violet nodded.</p>

  <p>"Peter's told me all this," she remarked. "He wants me to give him
  up."</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles drew a little closer to his companion. There was a
  peculiar smile upon his lips.</p>

  <p>"My dear young lady," he said softly, "forgive me if I point out to you
  that with your appearance and gifts a marriage with our excellent friend is
  surely not the summit of your ambitions! Here in Paris, I promise you,
  here&mdash;we can do much better than that for you. You have not, perhaps, a
  dot? Good! That is our affair. Give up our friend here, and we deposit in any
  bank you like to name the sum of two hundred and fifty thousand francs."</p>

  <p>"Two hundred and fifty thousand francs!" Violet repeated, slowly.</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is enough?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It is not enough," she answered.</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"We do not bargain," he said coldly, "and money is not the chief thing in
  the world. It is for you, then, to name a sum."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur de Founcelles," she said, "can you tell me the amount of the
  national debt of France?"</p>

  <p>"Somewhere about nine hundred million francs, I believe," he answered.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"That is exactly my price," she declared.</p>

  <p>"For giving up Peter Ruff?" he gasped.</p>

  <p>She looked at her employer thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"He doesn't look worth it, does he?" she said, with a queer little smile.
  "I happen to care for him, though&mdash;that's all."</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Founcelles shrugged his shoulders. He knew men and women, and
  for the present he accepted defeat. He sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate our friend, and I envy him," he said. "If ever you should
  change your mind, Mademoiselle&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is our privilege, isn't it?" she remarked, with a brilliant smile. "If
  I do, I shall certainly let you know."</p>

  <p>On the way home, Peter Ruff was genial&mdash;Miss Brown silent. He had
  escaped from a difficult position, and his sense of gratitude toward his
  companion was strong. He showed her many little attentions on the voyage
  which sometimes escaped him. From Dover, they had a carriage to
  themselves.</p>

  <p>"Peter," Miss Brown said, after he had made her comfortable, "when is it
  to be?"</p>

  <p>"When is what to be?" he asked, puzzled.</p>

  <p>"Our marriage," she answered, looking at him for a moment in most
  bewildering fashion and then suddenly dropping her eyes.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff returned her gaze in blank amazement.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean, Violet?" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Just what I say," she answered, composedly. "When are we going to be
  married?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff frowned.</p>

  <p>"What nonsense!" he said. "We are not going to be married. You know that
  quite well."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no, I don't!" she declared, smiling at him in a heavenly fashion. "At
  your request I have told Monsieur de Founcelles that we were engaged.
  Incidentally, I have refused two hundred and fifty thousand francs and, I
  believe, an admirer, for your sake. I declared that I was going to marry you,
  and I must keep my word."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff began to feel giddy.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Violet," he said, "you know very well that we arranged all
  that between ourselves."</p>

  <p>"Arranged all that?" she repeated, with a little laugh. "Perhaps we did.
  You asked me to marry you, and you posed as my fiancee. You kept it up just
  as long as you&mdash;it suits me to keep it up a little longer."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say&mdash;do you seriously mean that you expect me to
  marry you?" he asked, aghast.</p>

  <p>"I do," she admitted. "I have meant you to for some time, Peter!"</p>

  <p>She was very alluring, and Peter Ruff hesitated. She held out her hands
  and leaned towards him. Her muff fell to the floor. She had raised her veil,
  and a faint perfume of violets stole into the carriage. Her lips were a
  little parted, her eyes were saying unutterable things.</p>

  <p>"You don't want me to sue you, do you, Peter?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sighed&mdash;and yielded.</p>

  <h2>X. WONDERFUL JOHN DORY</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Jun 1910</h3>

  <p class="first">The woman who had been Peter Ruff's first love had fallen
  upon evil days. Her prettiness was on the wane&mdash;powder and rouge, late
  hours, and excesses of many kinds, had played havoc with it, even in these
  few months. Her clothes were showy but cheap. Her boots themselves, unclean
  and down at heel, told the story. She stood upon the threshold of Peter
  Ruff's office, and looked half defiantly, half doubtfully at Violet, who was
  its sole occupant.</p>

  <p>"Can I do anything for you?" the latter asked, noticing the woman's
  hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I want to see Mr. Ruff," the visitor said.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Ruff is out at present," Violet answered.</p>

  <p>"When will he be in?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you," Violet said. "Perhaps you had better leave a message.
  Or will you call again? Mr. Ruff is very uncertain in his movements."</p>

  <p>Maud sank into a chair.</p>

  <p>"I'll wait," she declared.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," Violet remarked, raising her eyebrows, "whether that will
  be convenient. There may be other clients in. Mr. Ruff himself may not be
  back for several hours."</p>

  <p>"Are you his secretary?" Maud asked, without moving.</p>

  <p>"I am his secretary and also his wife," Violet declared. The woman raised
  herself a little in her chair.</p>

  <p>"Some people have all the luck," she muttered. "It's only a few months ago
  that Mr. Ruff was glad enough to take me out. You remember when I used to
  come here?"</p>

  <p>"I remember," Violet assented.</p>

  <p>"I was all right then," the woman continued, "and now&mdash;now I'm down
  and out," she added, with a little sob. "You see what I am like. You look as
  though you didn't care to have me in the office, and I don't wonder at it.
  You look as though you were afraid I'd come to beg, and you are right&mdash;I
  have come to beg."</p>

  <p>"I am sure Mr. Ruff will do what he can for you," Violet said,
  "although&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I see you know all about it," Maud interrupted, with a hard little laugh.
  "I came once to wheedle information out of him. I came to try and betray the
  only man who ever really cared for me. Mr. Ruff was too clever, and I am
  thankful for it. I have been as big a fool as a woman can be, but I am
  paying&mdash;oh, I am paying for it right enough!"</p>

  <p>She swayed in her chair, and Violet was only just in time to catch her.
  She led the fainting woman to an inner room, made her comfortable upon a
  sofa, and sent out for some food and a bottle of wine. Down in the street
  below, John Dory, who had tracked his wife to the building, was walking away
  with face as black as night. He knew that Maud had lost her position, that
  she was in need of money&mdash;almost penniless. He had waited to see to whom
  she would turn, hoping&mdash;poor fool as he called himself&mdash;that she
  would come back to him. And it was his enemy to whom she had gone! He had
  seen her enter the building; he knew that she had not left it. In the morning
  they brought him another report&mdash;she was still within. It was the end,
  this, he told himself! There must be a settlement between him and Peter
  Ruff!</p>

  <p>Mr. John Dory, who had arrived at Clenarvon Court in a four-wheel cab from
  the nearest railway station, was ushered by the butler to the door of one of
  the rooms on the ground floor, overlooking the Park. A policeman was there on
  guard&mdash;a policeman by his attitude and salute, although he was in plain
  clothes. John Dory nodded, and turned to the butler.</p>

  <p>"You see, the man knows me," he said. "Here is my card. I am John Dory
  from Scotland Yard. I want to have a few words with the sergeant."</p>

  <p>The butler hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Our orders are very strict, sir," he said. "I am afraid that I cannot
  allow you to enter the room without a special permit from his lordship. You
  see, we have had no advice of your coming."</p>

  <p>John Dory nodded.</p>

  <p>"Quite right," he answered. "If every one were to obey his orders as
  literally, there would be fewer robberies. However, you see that this man
  recognizes me."</p>

  <p>The butler turned toward an elderly gentleman in a pink coat and
  riding-breeches, who had just descended into the hall.</p>

  <p>"His lordship is here," he said. "He will give you permission, without a
  doubt. There is a gentleman from Scotland Yard, your lordship," he explained,
  "who wishes to enter the morning-room to speak with the sergeant."</p>

  <p>"Inspector John Dory, at your lordship's service," saluting. "I have been
  sent down from town to help in this little business."</p>

  <p>Lord Clenarvon smiled.</p>

  <p>"I should have thought that, under the circumstances," he said, "two of
  you would have been enough. Still, it is not for me to complain. Pray go in
  and speak to the sergeant. You will find him inside. Rather dull work for
  him, I'm afraid, and quite unnecessary."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure, your lordship," Dory answered. "The Clenarvon diamonds
  are known all over the world, and I suppose there isn't a thieves' den in
  Europe that does not know that they will remain here exposed with your
  daughter's other wedding presents."</p>

  <p>Lord Clenarvon smiled once more and shrugged his shoulders. He was a man
  who had unbounded faith in his fellow-creatures.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he said, "it is the penalty one has to pay for historical
  possessions. Go in and talk to the sergeant, by all means, Mr. Dory. I hope
  that Graves will succeed in making you comfortable during your stay
  here."</p>

  <p>John Dory was accordingly admitted into the room which was so jealously
  guarded. At first sight, it possessed a somewhat singular appearance. The
  windows had every one of them been boarded up, and the electric lights
  consequently fully turned on. A long table stood in the middle of the
  apartment, serving as support for a long glass showcase, open at the top.
  Within this, from end to end, stretched the presents which a large circle of
  acquaintances were presenting to one of the most popular young women in
  society, on the occasion of her approaching marriage to the Duke of
  Rochester. In the middle, the wonderful Clenarvon diamonds, set in the form
  of a tiara, flashed strange lights into the somberly lit apartment. At the
  end of the table a police sergeant was sitting, with a little pile of
  newspapers and illustrated journals before him. He rose to his feet with
  alacrity at his superior's entrance.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, Saunders," John Dory said. "I see you've got it pretty snug
  in here."</p>

  <p>"Pretty well, thank you, sir," Saunders answered. "Is there anything
  stirring?"</p>

  <p>John Dory looked behind to be sure that the door was closed. Then he
  stopped for a moment to gaze at the wonderful diamonds, and finally sat on
  the table by his subordinate's side.</p>

  <p>"Not exactly that, Saunders," he said. "To tell you the truth, I came down
  here because of that list of guests you sent me up."</p>

  <p>Saunders smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think I can guess the name you singled out, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"It was Peter Ruff, of course," Dory said. "What is he doing here in the
  house, under his own name, and as a guest?"</p>

  <p>"I have asked no questions, sir," Saunders answered. "I underlined the
  name in case it might seem worth your while to make inquiries."</p>

  <p>John Dory nodded.</p>

  <p>"Nothing has happened, of course?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," Saunders answered. "You see, with the windows all boarded up,
  there is practically only the ordinary door to guard, so we feel fairly
  secure."</p>

  <p>"No one hanging about?" the detective asked. "Mr. Ruff himself, for
  instance, hasn't been trying to make your acquaintance?"</p>

  <p>"No sign of it, sir," the man answered. "I saw him pass through the hall
  yesterday afternoon, as I went off duty, and he was in riding clothes all
  splashed with mud. I think he has been hunting every day."</p>

  <p>John Dory muttered something between his lips, and turned on his heel.</p>

  <p>"How many men have you here, Saunders?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Only two, sir, beside myself," the man replied.</p>

  <p>The detective went round the boarded windows, examining the work carefully
  until he reached the door.</p>

  <p>"I am going to see if I can have a word with his lordship," he said.</p>

  <p>He caught Lord Clenarvon in the act of mounting his horse in the great
  courtyard.</p>

  <p>"What is it, Mr. Dory?" the Earl asked, stooping down.</p>

  <p>"There is one name, your lordship, among your list of guests, concerning
  which I wish to have a word with you," the detective said&mdash;"the name of
  Mr. Peter Ruff."</p>

  <p>"Don't know anything about him," Lord Clenarvon answered, cheerfully. "You
  must see my daughter, Lady Mary. It was she who sent him his invitation.
  Seems a decent little fellow, and rides as well as the best. You'll find Lady
  Mary about somewhere, if you'd like to ask her."</p>

  <p>Lord Clenarvon hurried off, with a little farewell wave of his crop, and
  John Dory returned into the house to make inquiries respecting Lady Mary. In
  a very few minutes he was shown into her presence. She smiled at him
  cheerfully.</p>

  <p>"Another detective!" she exclaimed. "I am sure I ought to feel quite safe
  now. What can I do for you, Mr. Dory?"</p>

  <p>"I have had a list of the guests sent to me," Dory answered, "in which I
  notice the name of Mr. Peter Ruff."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I have just spoken to his lordship," the detective continued, "and he
  referred me to you."</p>

  <p>"Do you want to know all about Mr. Ruff?" Lady Mary asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>"If your ladyship will pardon my saying so, I think that neither you nor
  any one else could tell me that. What I wished to say was that I understood
  that we at Scotland Yard were placed in charge of your jewels until after the
  wedding. Mr. Peter Ruff is, as you may be aware, a private detective
  himself."</p>

  <p>"I understand perfectly," Lady Mary said. "I can assure you, Mr. Dory,
  that Mr. Ruff is here entirely as a personal and very valued friend of my
  own. On two occasions he has rendered very signal service to my
  family&mdash;services which I am quite unable to requite."</p>

  <p>"In that case, your ladyship, there is nothing more to be said. I conceive
  it, however, to be my duty to tell you that in our opinion&mdash;the opinion
  of Scotland Yard&mdash;there are things about the career of Mr. Peter Ruff
  which need explanation. He is a person whom we seldom let altogether out of
  our sight."</p>

  <p>Lady Mary laughed frankly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Dory," she said, "this is one of the cases, then, in which I
  can assure you that I know more than Scotland Yard. There is no person in the
  world in whom I have more confidence, and with more reason, than Mr. Peter
  Ruff."</p>

  <p>John Dory bowed.</p>

  <p>"I thank your ladyship," he said. "I trust that your confidence will never
  be misplaced. May I ask one more question?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Lady Mary replied, "so long as you make no insinuations
  whatever against my friend."</p>

  <p>"I should be very sorry to do so," John Dory declared. "I simply wish to
  know whether Mr. Ruff has any instructions from you with reference to the
  care of your jewels?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Lady Mary replied, decidedly. "Mr. Ruff is here entirely
  as my guest. He has been in the room with the rest of us, to look at them,
  and it was he, by the bye, who discovered a much more satisfactory way of
  boarding the windows. Anything else, Mr. Dory?"</p>

  <p>"I thank your ladyship, nothing!" the detective answered. "With your
  permission, I propose to remain here until after the ceremony."</p>

  <p>"Just as you like, of course," Lady Mary said. "I hope you will be
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>John Dory bowed, and returned to confer with his sergeant. Afterwards,
  finding the morning still fine, he took his hat and went for a walk in the
  park.</p>

  <p>As a matter of fact, this, in some respects the most remarkable of the
  adventures which had ever befallen Mr. Peter Ruff, came to him by accident.
  Lady Mary had read the announcement of his marriage in the paper, had driven
  at once to his office with a magnificent present, and insisted upon his
  coming with his wife to the party which was assembling at Clenarvon Court in
  honor of her own approaching wedding. Peter Ruff had taken few holidays of
  late years, and for several days had thoroughly enjoyed himself. The matter
  of the Clenarvon jewels he considered, perhaps, with a slight professional
  interest; but so far as he could see, the precautions for guarding them were
  so adequate that the subject did not remain in his memory. He had, however, a
  very distinct and disagreeable shock when, on the night of John Dory's
  appearance, he recognized among a few newly-arrived guests the Marquis de
  Sogrange. He took the opportunity, as soon as possible, of withdrawing his
  wife from a little circle among whom they had been talking, to a more retired
  corner of the room. She saw at once that something had happened to disturb
  him.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "don't look behind now&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I recognized him at once," she interrupted. "It is the Marquis de
  Sogrange."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"It will be best for you," he said, "not to notice him. Of course, his
  presence here may be accidental. He has a perfect right to enter any society
  he chooses. At the same time, I am uneasy."'</p>

  <p>She understood in a moment.</p>

  <p>"The Clenarvon diamonds!" she whispered. He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is just the sort of affair which would appeal to the 'Double-Four,'"
  he said. "They are worth anything up to a quarter of a million, and it is an
  enterprise which could scarcely be attempted except by some one in a peculiar
  position. Violet, if I were not sure that he had seen me, I should leave the
  house this minute."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked, wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Don't you understand," Peter Ruff continued, softly, "that I myself am
  still what they call a corresponding member of the 'Double-Four,' and they
  have a right to appeal to me for help in this country, as I have a right to
  appeal to them for help or information in France? We have both made use of
  one another, to some extent. No doubt, if the Marquis has any scheme in his
  mind, he would look upon me as a valuable ally."</p>

  <p>She turned slowly pale.</p>

  <p>"Peter," she said, "you wouldn't dream&mdash;you wouldn't dare to be so
  foolish?"</p>

  <p>He shook his head firmly.</p>

  <p>"My dear girl," he said, "we talked that all out long ago. A few years
  since, I felt that I had been treated badly, that I was an alien, and that
  the hand of the law was against me. I talked wildly then, perhaps. When I put
  up my sign and sat down for clients, I meant to cheat the law, if I could.
  Things have changed, Violet. I want nothing of that sort. I have kept my
  hands clean and I mean to do so. Why, years ago," he continued, "when I was
  feeling at my wildest, these very jewels were within my grasp one foggy
  night, and I never touched them."</p>

  <p>"What would happen if you refused to help?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," Peter Ruff answered. "The conditions are a little severe.
  But, after all, there are no hard and fast rules. It rests with the Marquis
  himself to shrug his shoulders and appreciate my position. Perhaps he may not
  even exchange a word with me. Here is Lord Sotherst coming to talk to you,
  and Captain Hamilton is waiting for me to tell him an address. Remember,
  don't recognize Sogrange."</p>

  <p>Dinner that night was an unusually cheerful meal. Peter Ruff, who was an
  excellent raconteur, told many stories. The Marquis de Sogrange was perhaps
  the next successful in his efforts to entertain his neighbors. Violet found
  him upon her left hand, and although he showed not the slightest signs of
  having ever seen her before, they were very soon excellent friends. After
  dinner, Sogrange and Peter Ruff drifted together on their way to the
  billiard-room. Sogrange, however, continued to talk courteously of trifles
  until, having decided to watch the first game, they found themselves alone on
  the leather divan surrounding the room.</p>

  <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure, my friend," Sogrange said, watching the
  ash of his cigar. "Professional?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head. "Not in the least," he answered. "I have had
  the good fortune to render Lady Mary and her brother, at different times,
  services which they are pleased to value highly. We are here as ordinary
  guests&mdash;my wife and I." The Marquis sighed.</p>

  <p>"Ah, that wife of yours, Ruff," he said. "She is charming, I admit, and
  you are a lucky man; but it was a price&mdash;a very great price to pay."</p>

  <p>"You, perhaps, are ambitious, Marquis," Peter Ruff answered. "I have not
  done so badly. A little contents me."</p>

  <p>Sogrange looked at him as though he were some strange creature.</p>

  <p>"I see!" he murmured. "I see! With you, of course, the commercial side
  comes uppermost. Mr. Ruff, what do you suppose the income from my estate
  amounts to?" Peter Ruff shook his head. He did not even know that the Marquis
  was possessed of estates!</p>

  <p>"Somewhere about seven millions of francs," Sogrange declared. "There are
  few men in Paris more extravagant than I, and I think that we Frenchmen know
  what extravagance means. But I cannot spend my income. Do you think that it
  is for the sake of gain that I have come across the Channel to add the
  Clenarvon diamonds to our coffers?"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff sat very still.</p>

  <p>"You mean that?" he said.</p>

  <p>"Of course!" Sogrange answered. "Didn't you realize it directly you saw
  me? What is there, do you think, in a dull English house-party to attract a
  man like myself? Don't you understand that it is the gambler's
  instinct&mdash;the restless desire to be playing pitch-and-toss with fate,
  with honor, with life and death, if you will&mdash;that brings such as myself
  into the ranks of the 'Double-Four'? It is the weariness which kills, Peter
  Ruff. One must needs keep it from one's bones."</p>

  <p>"Marquis," Peter Ruff answered, "I do not profess to understand you. I am
  not weary of life, in fact I love it. I am looking forward to the years when
  I have enough money&mdash;and it seems as though that time is not far
  off&mdash;when I can buy a little place in the country, and hunt a little and
  shoot a little, and live a simple out-of-door life. You see, Marquis, we are
  as far removed as the poles."</p>

  <p>"Obviously!" Sogrange answered.</p>

  <p>"Your confidence," Peter Ruff continued, "the confidence with which you
  have honored me, inspires me to make you one request. I am here, indeed, as a
  friend of the family. You will not ask me to help in any designs you may have
  against the Clenarvon jewels?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange leaned back in his chair and laughed softly. His lips, when they
  parted from his white teeth, resolved themselves into lines which at that
  moment seemed to Peter Ruff more menacing than mirthful. Sogrange was, in
  many ways, a man of remarkable appearance.</p>

  <p>"Oh, Peter Ruff," he said, "you are a bourgeois little person! You should
  have been the burgomaster in a little German town, or a French mayor with a
  chain about your neck. We will see. I make no promises. All that I insist
  upon, for the present, is that you do not leave this house-party without
  advising me&mdash;that is to say, if you are really looking forward to that
  pleasant life in the country, where you will hunt a little and shoot a
  little, and grow into the likeness of a vegetable. You, with your charming
  wife! Peter Ruff, you should be ashamed to talk like that! Come, I must play
  bridge with the Countess. I am engaged for a table."</p>

  <p>The two men parted. Peter Ruff was uneasy. On his way from the room, Lord
  Sotherst insisted upon his joining a pool.</p>

  <p>"Charming fellow, Sogrange," the latter remarked, as he chalked his cue.
  "He has been a great friend of the governor's&mdash;he and his father before
  him. Our families have intermarried once or twice."</p>

  <p>"He seems very agreeable," Peter Ruff answered, devoting himself to the
  game.</p>

  <p>The following night, being the last but one before the wedding itself, a
  large dinner-party had been arranged for, and the resources of even so
  princely a mansion as Clenarvon Court were strained to their utmost by the
  entertainment of something like one hundred guests in the great
  banqueting-hall. The meal was about half-way through when those who were not
  too entirely engrossed in conversation were startled by hearing a dull,
  rumbling sound, like the moving of a number of pieces of heavy furniture.
  People looked doubtfully at one another. Peter Ruff and the Marquis de
  Sogrange were among the first to spring to their feet.</p>

  <p>"It's an explosion somewhere," the latter cried. "Sounds close at hand,
  too."</p>

  <p>They made their way out into the hall. Exactly opposite now was the room
  in which the wedding presents had been placed, and where for days nothing had
  been seen but a closed door and a man on duty outside. The door now stood
  wide open, and in place of the single electric light which was left burning
  through the evening, the place seemed almost aflame.</p>

  <p>Ruff, Sogrange and Lord Sotherst were the first three to cross the
  threshold. They were met by a rush of cold wind. Opposite to them, two of the
  windows, with their boardings, had been blown away. Sergeant Saunders was
  still sitting in his usual place at the end of the table, his head bent upon
  his folded arms. The man who had been on duty outside was standing over him,
  white with horror. Far away in the distance, down the park, one could faintly
  hear the throbbing of an engine, and Peter Ruff, through the chasm, saw the
  lights of a great motor-car flashing in and out amongst the trees. The room
  itself&mdash;the whole glittering array of presents&mdash;seemed untouched.
  Only the great center-piece&mdash;the Clenarvon diamonds&mdash;had gone. Even
  as they stood there, the rest of the guests crowding into the open door, John
  Dory tore through, his face white with excitement. Peter Ruff's calm voice
  penetrated the din of tongues.</p>

  <p>"Lord Sotherst," he said, "you have telephones in the keepers' lodges.
  There is a motor-car being driven southwards at full speed. Telephone down,
  and have your gates secured. Dory, I should keep every one out of the room.
  Some one must telephone for a doctor. I suppose your man has been hurt."</p>

  <p>The guests were wild with curiosity, but Lord Clenarvon, with an insistent
  gesture, led the way back to the diningroom.</p>

  <p>"Whatever has happened," he said, "the people who are in charge there know
  best how to deal with the situation. There is a detective from Scotland Yard
  and his subordinates, and a gentleman in whom I also have most implicit
  confidence. We will resume our dinner, if you please, ladies and
  gentlemen."</p>

  <p>Unwillingly, the people were led away. John Dory was already in his
  great-coat, ready to spring into the powerful motor-car which had been
  ordered out from the garage. A doctor, who had been among the guests, was
  examining the man Saunders, who sat in that still, unnatural position at the
  head of the table.</p>

  <p>"The poor fellow has been shot in the back of the head with some peculiar
  implement," he said. "The bullet is very long&mdash;almost like a
  needle&mdash;and it seems to have penetrated very nearly to the base of the
  brain."</p>

  <p>"Is he dead?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>The doctor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No!" he answered. "An inch higher up and he must have died at once. I
  want some of the men-servants to help me carry him to a bedroom, and plenty
  of hot water. Some one else must go for my instrument case."</p>

  <p>Lord Sotherst took these things in charge, and John Dory turned to the man
  whom they had found standing over him.</p>

  <p>"Tell us exactly what happened," he said, briefly.</p>

  <p>"I was standing outside the door," the man answered. "I heard no sound
  inside&mdash;there was nothing to excite suspicion in any way. Suddenly there
  was this explosion. It took me, perhaps, thirty or forty seconds to get the
  key out of my pocket and unlock the door. When I entered, the side of the
  room was blown in like that, the diamonds were gone, Saunders was leaning
  forward just in the position he is in now, and there wasn't another soul in
  sight. Then you and the others came."</p>

  <p>John Dory rushed from the room; they had brought him word that the car was
  waiting. At such a moment, he was ready even to forget his ancient enmity. He
  turned towards Peter Ruff, whose calm bearing somehow or other impressed even
  the detective with a sense of power.</p>

  <p>"Will you come along?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Thank you, Dory, no!" he said. "I am glad you have asked me, but I think
  you had better go alone."</p>

  <p>A few seconds later, the pursuit was started. Saunders was carried out of
  the room, followed by the doctor. There remained only Peter Ruff and the man
  who had been on duty outside. Peter Ruff seated himself where Saunders had
  been sitting, and seemed to be closely examining the table all round for some
  moments. Once he took up something from between the pages of the book which
  the Sergeant had apparently been reading, and put it carefully into his own
  pocketbook. Then he leaned back in the chair, with his hands clasped behind
  his head and his eyes fixed upon the ceiling, as though thinking
  intently.</p>

  <p>"Hastings," he said to the policeman, who all the time was pursuing a
  stream of garrulous, inconsequent remarks, "I wonder whether you'd step
  outside and see Mr. Richards, the butler. Ask him if he would be so good as
  to spare me a moment."</p>

  <p>"I'll do it, sir," the man answered, with one more glance through the open
  space. "Lord!" he added, "they must have been in through there and out again
  like cats!"</p>

  <p>"It was quick work, certainly," Peter Ruff answered, genially, "but then,
  an enterprise like this would, of course, only be attempted by experts."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was not left alone long. Mr. Richards came hurrying in.</p>

  <p>"This is a terrible business, sir!" he said. "His lordship has excused me
  from superintending the service of the dinner. Anything that I can do for you
  I am to give my whole attention to. These were my orders."</p>

  <p>"Very good of you, Richards," Peter Ruff answered, "very thoughtful of his
  lordship. In the first place, then, I think, we will have the rest of this
  jewelry packed in cases at once. Not that anything further is likely to
  happen," he continued, "but still, it would be just as well out of the way. I
  will remain here and superintend this, if you will send a couple of careful
  servants. In the meantime, I want you to do something else for me."</p>

  <p>"Certainly, sir," the man answered.</p>

  <p>"I want a plan of the house," Peter Ruff said, "with the names of the
  guests who occupy this wing."</p>

  <p>The butler nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"I can supply you with it very shortly, sir," he said. "There is no
  difficulty at all about the plan, as I have several in my room; but it will
  take me some minutes to pencil in the names."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff nodded.</p>

  <p>"I will superintend things here until you return," he said.</p>

  <p>"It is to be hoped, sir," the man said, as he retreated, "that the
  gentleman from Scotland Yard will catch the thieves. After all, they hadn't
  more than ten minutes' start, and our Daimler is a flyer."</p>

  <p>"I'm sure I hope so," Peter Ruff answered, heartily.</p>

  <p>But, alas! no such fortune was in store for Mr. John Dory. At daybreak he
  returned in a borrowed trap from a neighboring railway station.</p>

  <p>"Our tires had been cut," he said, in reply to a storm of questions. "They
  began to go, one after the other, as soon as we had any speed on. We traced
  the car to Salisbury, and there isn't a village within forty miles that isn't
  looking out for it."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, who had just returned from an early morning walk, nodded
  sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"Shall you be here all day, Mr. Dory?" he asked. "There's just a word or
  two I should like to have with you."</p>

  <p>Dory turned away. He had forced himself, in the excitement of the moment,
  to speak to his ancient enemy, but in this hour of his humility the man's
  presence was distasteful to him.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," he said, shortly. "It depends on how things may turn
  out."</p>

  <p>The daily life at Clenarvon Court proceeded exactly as usual. Breakfast
  was served early, as there was to be big day's shoot. The Marquis de Sogrange
  and Peter Ruff smoked their cigarettes together afterwards in the great hall.
  Then it was that Peter Ruff took the plunge.</p>

  <p>"Marquis," he said, "I should like to know exactly how I stand with
  you&mdash;the 'Double-Four,' that is to say&mdash;supposing I range myself
  for an hour or so on the side of the law?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange smiled.</p>

  <p>"You amuse yourself, Mr. Ruff," he remarked genially.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Peter Ruff answered. "I am serious."</p>

  <p>Sogrange watched the blue cigarette smoke come down his nose.</p>

  <p>"My dear friend," he said, "I am no amateur at this game. When I choose to
  play it, I am not afraid of Scotland Yard. I am not afraid," he concluded,
  with a little bow, "even of you!"</p>

  <p>"Do you ever bet, Marquis?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"Twenty-five thousand francs," Sogrange said, smiling, "that your efforts
  to aid Mr. John Dory are unavailing."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff entered the amount in his pocketbook. "It is a bargain," he
  declared. "Our bet, I presume, carries immunity for me?"</p>

  <p>"By all means," Sogrange answered, with a little bow.</p>

  <p>The Marquis beckoned to Lord Sotherst, who was crossing the hall.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "do tell me the name of your hatter in London.
  Delions failed me at the last moment, and I have not a hat fit for the
  ceremony to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"I'll lend you half-a-dozen, if you can wear them," Lord Sotherst
  answered, smiling. "The governor's sure to have plenty, too."</p>

  <p>Sogrange touched his head with a smile.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" he said. "My head is small, even for a Frenchman's. Imagine
  me&mdash;otherwise, I trust, suitably attired&mdash;walking to the church
  to-morrow in a hat which came to my ears!"</p>

  <p>Lord Sotherst laughed.</p>

  <p>"Scotts will do you all right," he said. "You can telephone."</p>

  <p>"I shall send my man up," Sogrange determined. "He can bring me back a
  selection. Tell me, at what hour is the first drive this morning, and are the
  places drawn yet?"</p>

  <p>"Come into the gun-room and we'll see," Lord Sotherst answered.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff made his way to the back quarters of the house. In a little
  sitting-room he found the man he sought, sitting alone. Peter Ruff closed the
  door behind him.</p>

  <p>"John Dory," he said, "I have come to have a few words with you."</p>

  <p>The detective rose to his feet. He was in no pleasant mood. Though the
  telephone wires had been flashing their news every few minutes, it seemed,
  indeed, as though the car which they had chased had vanished into space.</p>

  <p>"What do you want to say to me?" he asked gruffly.</p>

  <p>"I want, if I can," Peter Ruff said earnestly, "to do you a service."</p>

  <p>Dory's eyes glittered.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that I can do without your services."</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish," Peter Ruff said. "You are harboring a grievance
  against me which is purely an imaginary one. Now listen to the facts. You
  employ your wife&mdash;which after all, Dory, I think, was not quite the
  straight thing&mdash;to try and track down a young man named Spencer
  Fitzgerald, who was formerly, in a small way, a client of mine. I find your
  wife an agreeable companion&mdash;we become friends. Then I discover her
  object, and know that I am being fooled. The end of that little episode you
  remember. But tell me why should you bear me ill-will for defending my friend
  and myself?"</p>

  <p>The detective came slowly up to Peter Ruff. He took hold of the lapel of
  the other's coat with his left hand, and his right hand was clenched. But
  Peter Ruff did not falter.</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," said Dory. "I will tell you what grudge I bear against
  you. It was your entertainment of my wife which gave her the taste for luxury
  and for gadding about. Mind, I don't blame you for that altogether, but there
  the fact remains. She left me. She went on the stage."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Peter Ruff said. "You must still hold me blameless. She wrote to
  me. I went out with her once. The only advice I gave her was to return to
  you. So far as I am concerned, I have treated her with the respect that I
  would have shown my own sister."</p>

  <p>"You lie!" Dory cried, fiercely. "A month ago, I saw her come to your
  fiat. I watched for hours. She did not leave it&mdash;she did not leave it
  all that night!"</p>

  <p>"If you object to her visit," Peter Ruff said quietly, "it is my wife whom
  you must blame."</p>

  <p>John Dory relaxed his hand and took a quick step backwards.</p>

  <p>"Your wife?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Exactly!" Peter Ruff answered. "Maud&mdash;Mrs. Dory&mdash;called to see
  me; she was ill&mdash;she had lost her situation&mdash;she was even, I
  believe, faint and hungry. I was not present. My wife talked to her and was
  sorry for her. While the two women were there together, your wife fainted.
  She was put to bed in our one spare room, and she has been shown every
  attention and care. Tell me, how long is it since you were at home?"</p>

  <p>"Not for ten days," Dory answered, bitterly. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"Because when you go back, you will find your wife there," Peter Ruff
  answered. "She has given up the stage. Her one desire is to settle down and
  repay you for the trouble she has caused you. You needn't believe me unless
  you like. Ask my wife. She is here. She will tell you."</p>

  <p>Dory was overcome. He went back to his seat by the window, and he buried
  his face for a moment in his hands.</p>

  <p>"Ruff," he said, "I don't deserve this. I've had bad times lately, though.
  Everything has gone against me. I think I have been a bit careless, with the
  troubles at home and that."</p>

  <p>"Stop!" Peter Ruff insisted. "Now I come to the immediate object of my
  visit to you. You have had some bad luck at headquarters. I know of it. I am
  going to help you to reinstate yourself brilliantly. With that, let us shake
  hands and bury all the soreness that there may be between us."</p>

  <p>John Dory stared at his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean this?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I do," answered Peter. "Please do not think that I mean to make any
  reflection upon your skill. It is just a chance that I was able to see what
  you were not able to see. In an hour's time, you shall restore the Clenarvon
  diamonds to Lord Clenarvon. You shall take the reward which he has just
  offered, of a thousand pounds. And I promise you that the manner in which you
  shall recover the jewels shall be such that you will be famous for a long
  time to come."</p>

  <p>"You are a wonderful man!" said Dory, hoarsely. "Do you mean, then, that
  the jewels were not with those men in the motor-car?"</p>

  <p>"Of course not!" Peter Ruff answered. "But come along. The story will
  develop."</p>

  <p>At half-past ten that morning, a motor-car turned out from the garage at
  Clenarvon Court, and made its way down the avenue. In it was a single
  passenger&mdash;the dark-faced Parisian valet of the Marquis de Sogrange. As
  the car left the avenue and struck into the main road, it was hailed by Peter
  Ruff and John Dory, who were walking together along the lane.</p>

  <p>"Say, my man," Peter Ruff said, addressing the chauffeur, "are you going
  to the station?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!" the man answered. "I am taking down the Marquis de Sogrange's
  servant to catch the eleven o'clock train to town."</p>

  <p>"You don't mind giving us a lift?" Peter Ruff asked, already opening the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not, sir," the man answered, touching his hat.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff and John Dory stepped into the tonneau of the car. The man
  civilly lifted the hatbox from the seat, and made room for his enforced
  companions. Nevertheless, it was easy to see that he was not pleased.</p>

  <p>"There's plenty of room here for three," Peter Ruff said, cheerfully, as
  they sat on either side of him. "Drive slowly, please, chauffeur. Now, Mr.
  Lemprise," Peter Ruff added, "we will trouble you to change places."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" the man called out, suddenly pale as death.</p>

  <p>He was held as though in a vice. John Dory's arm was through his on one
  side, and Peter Ruff's on the other. Apart from that, the muzzle of a
  revolver was pressed to his forehead.</p>

  <p>"On second thoughts," Peter Ruff said, "I think we will keep you like
  this. Driver," he called out, "please return to the Court at once."</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You recognize the gentleman who is with me?" Peter Ruff said. "He is the
  detective from Scotland Yard. I have full authority from Lord Clenarvon over
  all his servants. Please do as I say."</p>

  <p>The man hesitated no more. The car was backed and turned, the Frenchman
  struggling all the way like a wild cat. Once he tried to kick the hatbox into
  the road, but John Dory was too quick for him. So they drove up to the front
  door of the Court, to be welcomed with cries of astonishment from the whole
  of the shooting party, who were just starting. Foremost among them was
  Sogrange. They crowded around the car. Peter Ruff touched the hatbox with his
  foot.</p>

  <p>"If we could trouble your Lordship," he said, "to open that hatbox, you
  will find something that will interest you. Mr. Dory has planned a little
  surprise for you, in which I have been permitted to help."</p>

  <p>The women, who gathered that something was happening, came hastening out
  from the hall. They all crowded round Lord Clenarvon, who was cutting through
  the leather strap of the hatbox. Inside the silk hat which reposed there,
  were the Clenarvon diamonds. Monsieur le Marquis de Sogrange was one of the
  foremost to give vent to an exclamation of delight.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur le Marquis," Peter Ruff said, "this should be a lesson to you, I
  hope, to have the characters of your servants more rigidly verified. Mr. Dory
  tells me that this man came into your employ at the last moment with a forged
  recommendation. He is, in effect, a dangerous thief."</p>

  <p>"You amaze me!" Sogrange exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"We are all interested in this affair," Peter Ruff said, "and my friend
  John Dory here is, perhaps, too modest properly to explain the matter. If you
  care to come with me, we can reconstruct, in a minute, the theft."</p>

  <p>John Dory and Peter Ruff first of all handed over their captive, who was
  now calm and apparently resigned, to the two policemen who were still on duty
  in the Court. Afterwards, Peter Ruff led the way up one flight of stairs, and
  turned the handle of the door of an apartment exactly over the morning-room.
  It was the bedroom of the Marquis de Sogrange.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dory's chase in the motor-car," he said, "was, as you have doubtless
  gathered now, merely a blind. It was obvious to his intelligence that the
  blowing away of the window was merely a ruse to cover the real method of the
  theft. If you will allow me, I will show you how it was done."</p>

  <p>The floor was of hardwood, covered with rugs. One of these, near the
  fireplace, Peter Ruff brushed aside. The seventh square of hardwood from the
  mantelpiece had evidently been tampered with. With very little difficulty, he
  removed it.</p>

  <p>"You see," he explained, "the ceiling of the room below is also of paneled
  wood. Having removed this, it is easy to lift the second one, especially as
  light screws have been driven in and string threaded about them. There is now
  a hole through which you can see into the room below. Has Dory returned? Ah,
  here he is!"</p>

  <p>The detective came hurrying into the room, bearing in his hand a
  peculiar-shaped weapon, a handful of little darts like those which had been
  found in the wounded man's head, and an ordinary fishing-rod in a linen
  case.</p>

  <p>"There is the weapon," Peter Ruff said, "which it was easy enough to fire
  from here upon the man who was leaning forward exactly below. Then here, you
  will see, is a somewhat peculiar instrument, which shows a great deal of
  ingenuity in its details."</p>

  <p>He opened the linen case, which was, by the bye, secured by a padlock, and
  drew out what was, to all appearance, an ordinary fishing-rod, fitted at the
  end with something that looked like an iron hand. Peter Ruff dropped it
  through the hole until it reached the table, moved it backwards and forwards,
  and turned round with a smile.</p>

  <p>"You see," he said, "the theft, after all, was very simple. Personally, I
  must admit that it took me a great deal by surprise, but my friend Mr. Dory
  has been on the right track from the first. I congratulate him most
  heartily."</p>

  <p>Dory was a little overcome. Lady Mary shook him heartily by the hand, but
  as they trooped downstairs she stooped and whispered in Peter Ruff's ear.</p>

  <p>"I wonder how much of this was John Dory," she said, smiling.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff said nothing. The detective was already on the telephone,
  wiring his report to London. Every one was standing about in little knots,
  discussing this wonderful event. Sogrange sought Lord Clenarvon, and walked
  with him, arm in arm, down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"I cannot tell you, Clenarvon," he said, "how sorry I am that I should
  have been the means of introducing a person like this to the house. I had the
  most excellent references from the Prince of Strelitz. No doubt they were
  forged. My own man was taken ill just before I left, and I had to bring some
  one."</p>

  <p>"My dear Sogrange," Lord Clenarvon said, "don't think of it. What we must
  be thankful for is that we had so brilliant a detective in the house."</p>

  <p>"As John Dory?" Sogrange remarked, with a smile. Lord Clenarvon
  nodded.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "I don't see why we should lose a day's sport because the
  diamonds have been recovered. I always felt that they would turn up again
  some day or other. You are keen, I know, Sogrange."</p>

  <p>"Rather!" the Marquis answered. "But excuse me for one moment. There is
  Mrs. Ruff looking charming there in the corner. I must have just a word with
  her."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room and bowed before Violet.</p>

  <p>"My dear lady," he said, "I have come to congratulate you. You have a
  clever husband&mdash;a little cleverer, even, than I thought. I have just had
  the misfortune to lose to him a bet of twenty-five thousand francs."</p>

  <p>Violet smiled, a little uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Peter doesn't gamble as a rule," she remarked.</p>

  <p>Sogrange sighed.</p>

  <p>"This, alas, was no gamble!" he said. "He was betting upon certainties,
  but he won. Will you tell him from me, when you see him, that although I have
  not the money in my pocket at the moment, I shall pay my debts. Tell him that
  we are as careful to do that in France as we are to keep our word!"</p>

  <p>He bowed, and passed out with the shooting-party on to the terrace. Peter
  Ruff came up, a few minutes later, and his wife gave him the message.</p>

  <p>"I did that man an injustice," Peter Ruff said with a sigh of relief. "I
  can't explain now, dear. I'll tell you all about it later in the day."</p>

  <p>"There's nothing wrong, is there?" she asked him, pleadingly.</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," Peter Ruff declared, "everything is right. I have made
  friends with Dory, and I have won a thousand pounds. When we leave here, I am
  going to look out for that little estate in the country. If you come out with
  the lunch, dear, I want you to watch that man Hamilton's coat. It's exactly
  what I should like to wear myself at my own shooting parties. See if you can
  make a sketch of it when he isn't looking."</p>

  <p>Violet laughed.</p>

  <p>"I'll try," she promised.</p>

  <h2>I. RECALLED BY THE DOUBLE-FOUR</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Jan 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">It is the desire of Madame that you should join our circle
  here on Thursday evening next at ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>The man looked up from the sheet of note-paper which he held in his hand,
  and gazed through the open French-windows before which he was standing. It
  was a very pleasant and very peaceful prospect. There was his croquet lawn,
  smooth-shaven, the hoops neatly arranged, the chalk-mark firm and distinct
  upon the boundary. Beyond, the tennis court, the flower gardens, and, to the
  left, the walled fruit garden. A little farther away was the paddock and
  orchard, and a little farther still, the farm, which for the last four years
  had been the joy of his life. His meadows were yellow with buttercups; a thin
  line of willows showed where the brook wound its lazy way through the bottom
  fields. It was a home, this, in which a man could well lead a peaceful life,
  could dream away his days to the music of the west wind, the gurgling stream,
  the song of birds, and the low murmuring of insects. Peter Ruff stood like a
  man turned to stone, for, even as he looked, these things passed away from
  before his eyes, the roar of the world beat in his ears&mdash;the world of
  intrigue, of crime, the world where the strong man hewed his way to power,
  and the weaklings fell like corn before the sickle.</p>

  <p>"It is the desire of Madame!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff clenched his fists as he stood there. It was a message from a
  world every memory of which had been deliberately crushed, a world, indeed,
  in which he had seemed no longer to hold any place. Scarcely yet of middle
  age, well-preserved, upright, with neat figure dressed in the conventional
  tweeds and gaiters of an English country gentleman, he not only had loved his
  life, but he looked the part. He was Peter Ruff, Esquire, of Aynesford Manor,
  in the county of Somerset. It could not be for him, this strange summons.</p>

  <p>The rustle of a woman's soft draperies broke in upon his reverie. He
  turned around with his usual morning greeting upon his lips. If country life
  had agreed with Peter Ruff, it had transformed his wife. Her cheeks were no
  longer pale; the extreme slimness of her figure was no longer apparent. She
  was just a little more matronly, perhaps, but without doubt a most beautiful
  woman. She came smiling across the room&mdash;a dream of white muslin and
  pink ribbons.</p>

  <p>"Another forage bill, my dear Peter?" she demanded, passing her arm
  through his. "Put it away and admire my new morning gown. It came straight
  from Paris, and you will have to pay a great deal of money for it."</p>

  <p>He pulled himself together&mdash;he had no secrets from his wife.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, and read aloud:</p>

  <p class="letter">"RUE DE ST. QUINTAINE.<br>
  PARIS.<br>
  <br>
  "DEAR Mr. RUFF, It is a long time since we had the pleasure of a visit from
  you. It is the desire of Madame that you should join our circle here on
  Thursday evening next at ten o'clock.&mdash; SOGRANGE."</p>

  <p>Violet was a little perplexed. She failed, somehow, to recognize the
  sinister note underlying those few sentences, "It sounds friendly enough,"
  she remarked. "You are not obliged to go, of course."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"Yes, it sounds all right," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"They won't expect you to take any notice of it, surely?" she continued.
  "When you bought this place, Peter, and left your London offices, you gave
  them definitely to understand that you had retired into private life, that
  all these things were finished with you."</p>

  <p>"There are some things," Peter Ruff said, slowly, "which are never
  finished."</p>

  <p>"But you resigned," she reminded him. "I remember your letter
  distinctly."</p>

  <p>"From the Double-Four," he answered, "no resignation is recognized save
  death. I did what I could and they accepted my explanations, gracefully and
  without comment. Now that the time has come, however, when they think they
  need my help, you see they do not hesitate to claim it."</p>

  <p>"You will not go, Peter? You will not think of going?" she begged.</p>

  <p>He twisted the letter between his fingers and sat down to his
  breakfast.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I shall not go."</p>

  <p>That morning Peter Ruff spent upon his farm, looking over his stock,
  examining some new machinery, and talking crops with his bailiff. In the
  afternoon he played his customary round of golf. It was the sort of day
  which, as a rule, he found completely satisfactory, yet, somehow or other, a
  certain sense of weariness crept in upon him toward its close.</p>

  <p>Two days later he received another letter. This time it was couched in
  different terms. On a square card, at the top of which was stamped a small
  coronet, he read as follows:</p>

  <p>Madame de Maupassim at home, Saturday evening, May 2nd, at ten
  o'clock.</p>

  <p>In small letters at the bottom left-hand corner were added the words:</p>

  <p>To meet friends.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff put the card upon the fire and went out for a morning's rabbit
  shooting with his keeper. When he returned luncheon was ready, but Violet was
  absent. He rang the bell.</p>

  <p>"Where is your mistress, Jane?" he asked the parlor-maid.</p>

  <p>The girl had no idea. Mrs. Ruff had left for the village several hours
  before; since then she had not been seen. Peter Ruff ate his luncheon alone,
  and understood. The afternoon wore on, and at night he traveled up to London.
  He knew better than to waste time by purposeless inquiries. Instead he took
  the nine o'clock train the next morning to Paris.</p>

  <p>It was a chamber of death into which he was ushered, dismal&mdash;yet, of
  its sort, unique, marvelous. The room itself might have been the sleeping
  apartment of an empress&mdash;lofty, with white paneled walls, adorned simply
  with gilded lines; with high windows, closely curtained now, so that neither
  sound nor the light of day might penetrate into the room. In the middle of
  the apartment upon a canopy bedside, which had once adorned a king's palace,
  lay Madame de Maupassim. Her face was already touched with the finger of
  death, yet her eyes were undimmed and her lips unquivering. Her hands,
  covered with rings, lay out before her upon the lace coverlid. Supported by
  many pillows, she was issuing her last instructions with the cold precision
  of the man of affairs who makes the necessary arrangements for a few days,
  absence from his business.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff, who had not even been allowed sufficient time to change his
  traveling clothes, was brought without hesitation to her bedside. She looked
  at him in silence for a moment, with a cold glitter in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"You are four days late, Monsieur Peter Ruff," she remarked. "Why did you
  not obey your first summons?</p>

  <p>"Madame," he answered, "I thought there must be a misunderstanding. Four
  years ago, I gave notice to the council that I had married and retired into
  private life. A country farmer is of no further use to the world."</p>

  <p>The woman's thin lip curled.</p>

  <p>"From death and the Double Four," she said, "there is no resignation which
  counts. You are as much our creature to-day, as I am the creature of the
  disease which is carrying me across the threshold of death."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff remained silent. The woman's words seemed full of dread
  significance. Besides, how was it possible to contradict the dying?</p>

  <p>"It is upon the unwilling of the world," she continued, speaking slowly,
  yet with extraordinary distinctness, "that its greatest honors are often
  conferred. The name of my successor has been balloted for, secretly. It is
  you, Peter Ruff, who have been chosen."</p>

  <p>This time he was silent because he was literally bereft of words. This
  woman was dying and fancying strange things! He looked from one to the other
  of the stern, pale faces of those who were gathered around her bedside. Seven
  of them there were&mdash;the same seven. At that moment their eyes were all
  focused upon him. Peter Ruff shrank back.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he murmured, "this cannot be."</p>

  <p>Her lips twitched as though she would have smiled. "What we have decided,"
  she said, "we have decided. Nothing can alter that, not even the will of Mr.
  Peter Ruff."</p>

  <p>"I have been out of the world for four years," Peter Ruff protested. "I
  have no longer ambitions, no longer any desire&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You lie!" the woman interrupted. "You lie or you do yourself an
  injustice. We gave you four years, and looking into your face, I think that
  it has been enough. I think that the weariness is there already. In any case,
  the charge which I lay upon you in these my last moments, is one which you
  can escape by death only."</p>

  <p>A low murmur of voices from those others repeated her words.</p>

  <p>"By death only!"</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff opened his lips, but closed them again without speech. A wave
  of emotion seemed passing through the room. Something strange was happening.
  It was Death itself, which had come among them.</p>

  <p>A morning journalist wrote of the death of Madame eloquently, and with
  feeling. She had been a broad-minded aristocrat, a woman of brilliant
  intellect and great friendships, a woman of whose inner life during the last
  ten or fifteen years little was known, yet who, in happier times, might well
  have played a great part in the history of her country.</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff drove back from the cemetery with the Marquis de Sogrange, and,
  for the first time since the death of Madame, serious subjects were spoken
  of.</p>

  <p>"I have waited here patiently," he declared, "but there are limits. I want
  my wife."</p>

  <p>Sogrange took him by the arm and led him into the library of the house in
  the Rue de St. Quintaine. The six men who were already there waiting rose to
  their feet.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," the Marquis said, "is it your will that I should be
  spokesman?"</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of assent. Then Sogrange turned toward his companion,
  and something new seemed to have crept into his manner&mdash;a solemn, almost
  a threatening note.</p>

  <p>"Peter Ruff," he continued, "you have trifled with the one organization in
  this world which has never allowed liberties to be taken with it. Men who
  have done greater service than you have died, for the disobedience of a day.
  You have been treated leniently, according to the will of Madame. According
  to her will, and in deference to the position which you must now take up
  among us, we will treat you as no other has ever been treated by us. The
  Double-Four admits your leadership and claims you for its own."</p>

  <p>"I am not prepared to discuss anything of the sort," Peter Ruff declared,
  doggedly, "until my wife is restored to me."</p>

  <p>The Marquis smiled.</p>

  <p>"The traditions of your race, Mr. Ruff," he said, "are easily manifest in
  you. Now hear our decision. Your wife shall be restored to you on the day
  when you take up this position to which you have become entitled. Sit down
  and listen."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff was a rebel at heart, but he felt the grip of iron.</p>

  <p>"During these four years when you, my friend, have been growing turnips
  and shooting your game, events in the great world have marched, new powers
  have come into being, a new page of history has been opened. As everything
  which has good at the heart evolves toward the good, so we of the Double-Four
  have lifted our great enterprise onto a higher plane. The world of criminals
  is still at our beck and call, we still claim the right to draw the line
  between moral theft and immoral honesty, but to-day the Double-Four is
  concerned with greater things. Within the four walls of this room, within the
  hearing of these my brothers, whose fidelity is as sure as the stones of
  Paris, I tell you a great secret. The government of our country has craved
  for our aid and the aid of our organization. It is no longer the wealth of
  the world alone, which we may control, but the actual destinies of
  nations."</p>

  <p>"What I suppose you mean to say is," Peter Ruff remarked, "that you've
  been going in for politics?"</p>

  <p>"You put it crudely, my English bull-dog," Sogrange answered, "but you are
  right. We are occupied now by affairs of international importance. More than
  once, during the last few month, ours has been the hand which has changed the
  policy of an empire."</p>

  <p>"Most interesting," Peter Ruff declared, "but so far as I, personally, am
  concerned&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Listen," interrupted the Marquis. "Not a hundred yards from the French
  Embassy, in London, there is waiting for you a house and servants no less
  magnificent than the Embassy itself. You will become the ambassador in London
  of the Double-Four, titular head of our association, a personage whose power
  is second to none in your great city. I do not address words of caution to
  you, my friend, because we have satisfied ourselves as to your character and
  capacity before we consented that you should occupy your present position.
  But I ask you to remember this. The will of Madame lives even beyond the
  grave. The spirit which animated her when alive breathes still in all of us.
  In London you will wield a great power. Use it for the common good. And,
  remember this&mdash;the Double-Four has never failed, the Double-Four never
  can fail."</p>

  <p>"I am glad to hear you are so confident," Peter Ruff said. "Of course, if
  I have to take this thing on, I shall do my best, but if I might venture to
  allude, for a moment, to anything so trifling as my own domestic affairs, I
  am very anxious to know about my wife."</p>

  <p>Sogrange smiled.</p>

  <p>"You will find Mrs. Ruff awaiting you in London," he announced. "Your
  address is Porchester House, Porchester Square."</p>

  <p>"When do I go there?" Peter Ruff asked.</p>

  <p>"To-night," was the answer.</p>

  <p>"And what do I do when I get there?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>"For three days," the Marquis told him, "you will remain indoors, and give
  audience to whoever may come to you. At the end of that time, you will
  understand a little more of our purpose and our objects&mdash;perhaps, even,
  of our power."</p>

  <p>"I see difficulties," Peter Ruff remarked. "There will be a good many
  people who will remember me when I had offices in Southampton Row. My name,
  you see, is uncommon."</p>

  <p>Sogrange drew a document from the breast pocket of his coat.</p>

  <p>"When you leave this house to-night," he proclaimed, "we bid good-by
  forever to Mr. Peter Ruff. You will find in this envelope the title deeds of
  a small property which is our gift to you. Henceforth you will be known by
  the name and title of your estates."</p>

  <p>"Title!" Peter Ruff gasped.</p>

  <p>"You will reappear in London," Sogrange continued, "as the Baron de
  Grost."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It won't do," he declared, "people will find me out."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to be found out," the Marquis went on, a little wearily.
  "Your country life has dulled your wits, Baron. The title and the name are
  justly yours&mdash;they go with the property. For the rest, the history of
  your family, and of your career up to the moment when you enter Porchester
  House to-night, will be inside this packet. You can peruse it upon the
  journey, and remember that we can, at all times, bring a hundred witnesses,
  if necessary, to prove that you are who you declare yourself to be. When you
  get to Charing-Cross, do not forget that it will be the carriage and servants
  of the Baron de Grost which await you."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, thoughtfully, "I suppose I shall get used to it."</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Sogrange answered. "For the moment, we are passing through a
  quiet time, necessitated by the mortal illness of Madame. You will be able to
  spend the next few weeks in getting used to your new position. You will have
  a great many callers, inspired by us, who will see that you make the right
  acquaintances and that you join the right clubs. At the same time, let me
  warn you always to be ready. There is trouble brewing just now all over
  Europe. In one way or another, we may become involved at any moment. The
  whole machinery of our society will be explained to you by your secretary.
  You will find him already installed at Porchester House. A glass of wine,
  Baron, before you leave."</p>

  <p>Peter Ruff glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"There are my things to pack," he began&mdash;</p>

  <p>Sogrange smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your valet is already on the front seat of the automobile which is
  waiting," he remarked. "You will find him attentive and trustworthy. The
  clothes which you brought with you we have taken the liberty of dispensing
  with. You will find others in your trunk, and at Porchester House you can
  send for any tailor you choose. One toast, Baron. We drink to the
  Double-Four&mdash;to the great cause!"</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of voices. Sogrange lifted once more his glass.</p>

  <p>"May Peter Ruff rest in peace!" he said. "We drink to his ashes. We drink
  long life and prosperity to the Baron de Grost!"</p>

  <h2>II. PRINCE ALBERT'S CARD DEBTS</h2>

  <h3>No record of magazine publications found</h3>

  <p class="first">It was half past twelve, and every table at the Berkeley
  Bridge Club was occupied. On the threshold of the principal room a visitor,
  who was being shown around, was asking questions of the secretary.</p>

  <p>"Is there any gambling here?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>The secretary shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that some of them go a little beyond the club points," he
  answered. "You see that table against the wall? They are playing shilling
  auction there."</p>

  <p>The table near the wall was, perhaps, the most silent. The visitor looked
  at it last and most curiously.</p>

  <p>"Who is the dissipated-looking boy playing there?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Prince Albert of Trent," the secretary answered.</p>

  <p>"And who is the little man, rather like Napoleon, who sits in the
  easy-chair and watches?"</p>

  <p>"The Baron de Grost."</p>

  <p>"Never heard of him," the visitor declared.</p>

  <p>"He is a very rich financier who has recently blossomed out in London,"
  the secretary said. "One sees him everywhere. He has a good-looking wife, who
  is playing in the other room."</p>

  <p>"A good-looking wife," the visitor remarked, thoughtfully. "But, yes! I
  thank you very much, Mr. Courtledge for showing me round. I will find my
  friends now."</p>

  <p>He turned away, leaving Courtledge alone, for a minute or two, on the
  threshold of the card room. The secretary's attention was riveted upon the
  table near the wall, and the frown on his face deepened. Just as he was
  moving off, the Baron de Grost rose and joined him.</p>

  <p>"They are playing a little high in here this evening," the latter remarked
  quietly.</p>

  <p>Courtledge frowned.</p>

  <p>"I wish I had been in the club when they started," he said, gloomily. "My
  task is all the more difficult now."</p>

  <p>The Baron de Grost looked pensively, for a moment, at the cigarette which
  he was carrying.</p>

  <p>"By the bye, Mr. Courtledge," he asked, with apparent irrelevance, "what
  was the name of the tall man with whom you were talking just now?"</p>

  <p>"Count von Hern. He was brought in by one of the attaches at the German
  Embassy."</p>

  <p>Baron de Grost passed his arm through the secretary's and led him a little
  way through the corridor.</p>

  <p>"I thought I recognized our friend," he remarked. "His presence here this
  evening is quite interesting."</p>

  <p>"Why this evening?"</p>

  <p>Baron de Grost avoided the question.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Courtledge," he said, "I think that you will allow me to ask you
  something without thinking me impertinent. You know that my wife and I have
  taken some interest in Prince Albert. It is on his account, is it not, that
  you look so gloomy to-night, as though you had an execution in front of
  you?"</p>

  <p>Courtledge nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he announced, "that we have come to the end of our tether
  with that young man. It's a pity, too, for he isn't a bad sort, and it will
  do the club no good if it gets about. But he hasn't settled up for a
  fortnight, and the matter came before the committee this afternoon. He owes
  one man over seven hundred pounds."</p>

  <p>The Baron de Grost listened gravely.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to speak to him to-night?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I must. I am instructed by the committee to ask him not to come to the
  club again until he has discharged his obligations."</p>

  <p>De Grost smoked thoughtfully for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I suppose there is no getting out of it. Don't rub it in
  too thick, though. I mean to have a talk with the boy afterwards, and if I am
  satisfied with what he says, the money will be all right."</p>

  <p>Courtledge raised his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"You know, of course, that he has a very small income and no
  expectations?"</p>

  <p>"I know that," Baron de Grost answered. "At the same time, it is hard to
  forget that he really is a member of the royal house, even though the kingdom
  is a small one."</p>

  <p>"Not only is the kingdom a small one," Courtledge remarked, "but there are
  something like five lives between him and the succession. However, it's very
  good-natured of you, Baron, to think of lending him a hand. I'll let him down
  as lightly as I can. You know him better than any one; I wonder if you could
  make an excuse to send him out of the room? I'd rather no one saw me talking
  to him."</p>

  <p>"Quite easy," said the Baron. "I'll manage it."</p>

  <p>The rubber was just finishing as De Grost re-entered the room. He touched
  the young man, who had been the subject of their conversation, upon the
  shoulder.</p>

  <p>"My wife would like to speak to you for a moment," he said. "She is in the
  other room."</p>

  <p>Prince Albert rose to his feet. He was looking very pale, and the ash-tray
  in front of him was littered with cigarette ends.</p>

  <p>"I will go and pay my respects to the Baroness," he declared. "It will
  change my luck, perhaps. Au revoir!"</p>

  <p>He passed out of the room and all eyes followed him.</p>

  <p>"Has the Prince been losing again to-night?" the Baron asked.</p>

  <p>One of the three men at the table shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"He owes me about five hundred pounds," he said, "and to tell you the
  truth, I'd really rather not play any more. I don't mind high points, but his
  doubles are absurd."</p>

  <p>"Why not break up the table?" the Baron suggested. "The boy can scarcely
  afford such stakes."</p>

  <p>He strolled out of the room in time to meet the Prince, who was standing
  in the corridor. A glance at his face was sufficient&mdash;the secretary had
  spoken. He would have hurried off, but the Baron intercepted him.</p>

  <p>"You are leaving, Prince?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes!" was the somewhat curt reply.</p>

  <p>"I will walk a little way with you, if I may," De Grost continued. "My
  wife brought Lady Brownloe, and the brougham only holds two comfortably."</p>

  <p>Prince Albert made no reply. He seemed just then scarcely capable of
  speech. When they had reached the pavement, however, the Baron took his
  arm.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he inquired, "how much does it all amount to?"</p>

  <p>The Prince turned towards him with darkening face.</p>

  <p>"You knew, then," he demanded, "that Mr. Courtledge was going to speak to
  me of my debts?"</p>

  <p>"I was sorry to hear that it had become necessary," the Baron answered.
  "You must not take it too seriously. You know very well that at a club like
  the Berkeley, which has such a varied membership, card debts must be settled
  on the spot."</p>

  <p>"Mine will be settled before mid-day to-morrow," the young man declared,
  sullenly. "I am not sure that it may not be to-night."</p>

  <p>De Grost was silent for a moment. They had turned into Piccadilly. He
  summoned a taxicab.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind coming round to my house and talking to me, for a few
  minutes?" he asked.</p>

  <p>The young man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I'll come round later on," he suggested. "I have a call to make
  first."</p>

  <p>De Grost held open the door of the taxicab.</p>

  <p>"I want a talk with you," he said, "before you make that call."</p>

  <p>"You speak as though you knew where I was going," the Prince remarked.</p>

  <p>His companion made no reply, but the door of the taxicab was still open
  and his hand had fallen ever so slightly upon the other's shoulder. The
  Prince yielded to the stronger will. He stepped inside.</p>

  <p>They drove in silence to Porchester Square. The Baron led the way through
  into his own private sanctum, and closed the door carefully. Cigars,
  cigarettes, whiskey and soda, and liqueurs were upon the sideboard.</p>

  <p>"Help yourself, Prince," he begged, "and then, if you don't mind, I am
  going to ask you a somewhat impertinent question."</p>

  <p>The Prince drank the greater part of a whiskey and soda and lit a
  cigarette. Then he set his tumbler down and frowned.</p>

  <p>"Baron de Grost," he said, "you have been very kind to me since I have had
  the pleasure of your acquaintance. I hope you will not ask me any question
  that I cannot answer."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary," his host declared, "the question which I shall ask will
  be one which it will be very much to your advantage to answer. I will put it
  as plainly as possible. You are going, as you admit yourself, to pay your
  card debts to-night or to-morrow morning, and you are certainly not going to
  pay them out of your income. Where is the money coming from?"</p>

  <p>Albert of Trent seemed suddenly to remember that after all he was of royal
  descent. He drew himself up and bore himself, for a moment, as a Prince
  should.</p>

  <p>"Baron de Grost," he said, "you pass the limits of friendship when you ask
  such a question. I take the liberty of wishing you good-night."</p>

  <p>He moved towards the door. The Baron, however, was in the way&mdash;a
  strong, motionless figure, and his tone, when he spoke again, was
  convincing.</p>

  <p>"Prince," he declared, "I speak in your own interests. You have not chosen
  to answer my question. Let me answer it for you. The money to pay your debts,
  and I know not how much besides, was to come from the Government of a country
  with whom none of your name or nationality should willingly have
  dealings."</p>

  <p>The Prince started violently. The shock caused him to forget his new-found
  dignity.</p>

  <p>"How, in the devil's name, do you know that?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"I know more," the Baron continued. "I know the consideration which you
  were to give for this money."</p>

  <p>Then the Prince began plainly to show the terror which had crept into his
  heart&mdash;the terror and the shame. He looked at his host like a man dazed
  with hearing strange things.</p>

  <p>"It comes to nothing," he said, in a hard, unnatural tone. "It is a
  foolish bargain, indeed. Between me and the throne are four lives. My promise
  is not worth the paper it is written upon. I shall never succeed."</p>

  <p>"That, Prince, is probably where you are misinformed," the Baron replied.
  "You are just now in disgrace with your family, and you hear from them only
  what the newspapers choose to tell."</p>

  <p>"Has anything been kept back from me?" the Prince asked.</p>

  <p>"Tell me this first," De Grost insisted. "Am I not right in assuming that
  you have signed a solemn undertaking that, in the event of your succeeding to
  the throne of your country, you will use the whole of your influence towards
  concluding a treaty with a certain Power, one of the provisions of which is
  that that Power shall have free access to any one of your ports in the event
  of war with England?"</p>

  <p>There was a moment's silence. The Prince clutched the back of the chair
  against which he was leaning.</p>

  <p>"Supposing it were true?" he muttered. "It is, after all, an idle
  promise."</p>

  <p>The Baron shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"Prince," he said, "it is no such idle promise as it seems. The man who is
  seeking to trade upon your poverty knew more than he would tell you. You may
  have read in the newspapers that your two cousins are confined to the palace
  with slight colds. The truth has been kept quiet, but it is none the less
  known to a few of us. The so-called cold is really a virulent attack of
  diphtheria, and, according to to-night's reports, neither Prince Cyril nor
  Prince Henry are expected to live."</p>

  <p>"Is this true?" the Prince gasped.</p>

  <p>"It is true," his host declared. "My information can be relied upon."</p>

  <p>The Prince sat down suddenly. He was looking whiter than ever, and very
  scared.</p>

  <p>"Even then," he murmured, "there is John."</p>

  <p>"You have been out of touch with your family for some months," De Grost
  reminded his visitor. "One or two of us, however, know what you, probably,
  will soon hear. Prince John has taken the vows and solemnly resigned, before
  the Archbishop, his heirship. He will be admitted into the Roman Catholic
  Church in a week or two, and will go straight to a monastery."</p>

  <p>"It's likely enough," the Prince gasped. "He always wanted to be a
  monk."</p>

  <p>"You see now," the Baron continued, "that your friend's generosity was not
  so wonderful a thing. Count von Hern was watching you to-night at the Bridge
  Club. He has gone home; he is waiting now to receive you. Apart from that,
  the man Nisch, with whom you have played so much, is a confederate of his, a
  political tout, not to say a spy."</p>

  <p>"The brute!" Prince Albert muttered. "I am obliged to you, Baron, for
  having warned me," he added, rising slowly to his feet. "I shall sign
  nothing. There is another way."</p>

  <p>De Grost shook his head.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "there is another way, indeed, but not the way
  you have in your mind at this moment. I offer you an alternative. I will give
  you notes for the full amount you owe to-night, so that you can, if you will,
  go back to the club direct from here and pay everything&mdash;on one
  condition."</p>

  <p>"Condition!"</p>

  <p>"You must promise to put your hand to no document which the Count von Hern
  may place before you, and pledge your word that you have no further dealings
  with him."</p>

  <p>"But why should you do this for me?" the Prince exclaimed. "I do not know
  that I shall ever be able to pay you."</p>

  <p>"If you succeed to the throne, you will pay me," the Baron de Grost said.
  "If you do not succeed, remember that I am a rich man, and that I shall miss
  this money no more than the sixpence which you might throw to a
  crossing-sweeper."</p>

  <p>The Prince was silent. His host unlocked a small cabinet and took from it
  a bundle of notes.</p>

  <p>"Tell me the whole amount you owe," he insisted, "every penny, mind."</p>

  <p>"Sixteen hundred pounds," was the broken reply.</p>

  <p>De Grost counted a little roll and laid it upon the table.</p>

  <p>"There are two thousand pounds," he said. "Listen, Prince. A name such as
  you bear carries with it certain obligations. Remember that, and try and
  shape your life accordingly. Take my advice&mdash;go back to your own country
  and find some useful occupation there, even if you only rejoin your regiment
  and wear its uniform. The time may come when your country will require you,
  for her work comes sooner or later to every man. You are leading a rotten
  life over here, a life which might have led to disaster and dishonor, a life,
  as you know, which might have ended in your rooms to-night with a small
  bullet hole in your forehead. Brave men do not die like that. Take up the
  money, please."</p>

  <p>The Baron de Grost sent a cipher dispatch to Paris that night, and
  received an answer which pleased him.</p>

  <p>"It is a small thing," he read, "but it is well done. Particulars of a
  matter of grave importance will reach you to-morrow." letter.</p>

  <h2>III. THE AMBASSADOR'S WIFE</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Feb 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">Alone in his study, with fast-locked door, Peter, Baron de
  Grost, sat reading, word by word, with zealous care the despatch from Paris
  which had just been delivered into his hands. From the splendid suite of
  reception rooms which occupied the whole of the left-hand side of the hall
  came the faint sound of music. The street outside was filled with automobiles
  and carriages setting down their guests. Madame was receiving to-night a
  gathering of very distinguished men and women, and it was only for a few
  moments, and on very urgent business indeed, that her husband had dared to
  leave her side.</p>

  <p>The room in which he sat was in darkness except for the single heavily
  shaded electric lamp which stood by his elbow. Nevertheless, there was
  sufficient illumination to show that Peter had achieved one, at least, of his
  ambitions. He was wearing court dress, with immaculate black silk stockings
  and diamond buckles upon his shoes. A red ribbon was in his buttonhole and a
  French order hung from his neck. His passion for clothes was certainly amply
  ministered to by the exigencies of his new position. Once more he read those
  last few words of this unexpectedly received despatch, read them with a frown
  upon his forehead and the light of trouble in his eyes. For three months he
  had done nothing but live the life of an ordinary man of fashion and wealth.
  His first task, for which, to tell the truth, he had been anxiously waiting,
  was here before him, and he found it little to his liking. Again, he read
  slowly to himself the last paragraph of Sogrange's letter.</p>

  <p class="letter">As ever, dear friend, one of the greatest sayings which the
  men of my race have ever perpetrated once more justifies
  itself&mdash;"Cherchez la femme!" Of Monsieur we have no manner of doubt. We
  have tested him in every way. And to all appearance Madame should also be
  above suspicion. Yet those things of which I have spoken have happened. For
  two hours this morning I was closeted with Picon here. Very reluctantly he
  has placed the matter in my hands. I pass it on to you. It is your first
  undertaking, cher Baron, and I wish you bon fortune. A man of gallantry, as I
  know you are, you may regret that it should be a woman, and a beautiful
  woman, too, against whom the finger must be pointed. Yet, after all, the
  fates are strong and the task is yours.&mdash; SOGRANGE.</p>

  <p>The music from the reception rooms grew louder and more insistent. Peter
  rose to his feet, and moving to the fireplace, struck a match and carefully
  destroyed the letter which he had been reading. Then he straightened himself,
  glanced for a moment at the mirror, and left the room to join his guests.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur le Baron jests," the lady murmured.</p>

  <p>The Baron de Grost shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, no, Madame!" he answered earnestly. "France has offered us
  nothing more delightful in the whole history of our entente than the loan of
  yourself and your brilliant husband. Monsieur de Lamborne makes history among
  us politically, while Madame&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The Baron sighed, and his companion leaned a little towards him; her dark
  eyes were full of sentimental regard.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she murmured. "Continue. It is my wish."</p>

  <p>"I am the good friend of Monsieur de Lamborne," the Baron said, and in his
  tone there seemed to lurk some far-away touch of regret, "yet Madame knows
  that her conquests here have been many."</p>

  <p>The Ambassador's wife fanned herself and remained silent for a moment, a
  faint smile playing at the corners of her full, curving lips. She was,
  indeed, a very beautiful woman&mdash;elegant, a Parisienne to the
  finger-tips, with pale cheeks, but eyes dark and soft, eyes trained to her
  service, whose flash was an inspiration, whose very droop had set beating the
  hearts of men less susceptible than the Baron de Grost. Her gown was
  magnificent, of amber satin, a color daring, but splendid; the outline of her
  figure, as she leaned slightly back in her seat, might indeed have been
  traced by the inspired finger of some great sculptor. De Grost, whose
  reputation as a man of gallantry was well established, felt the whole charm
  of her presence&mdash;felt, too, the subtle indications of preference which
  she seemed inclined to accord to him. There was nothing which eyes could say
  which hers were not saying during those few minutes. The Baron, indeed,
  glanced around a little nervously. His wife had still her moments of
  unreasonableness; it was just as well that she was engaged with some of her
  guests at the farther end of the apartments.</p>

  <p>"You are trying to turn my head," his beautiful companion whispered. "You
  flatter me."</p>

  <p>"It is not possible," he answered.</p>

  <p>Again the fan fluttered for a moment before her face. She sighed.</p>

  <p>"Ah. Monsieur!" she continued, dropping her voice until it scarcely rose
  above a whisper, "there are not many men like you. You speak of my husband
  and his political gifts. Yet what, after all, do they amount to? What is his
  position, indeed, if one glanced behind the scenes, compared with yours?"</p>

  <p>The face of the Baron de Grost became like a mask. It was as though
  suddenly he had felt the thrill of danger close at hand, danger even in that
  scented atmosphere wherein he sat.</p>

  <p>"Alas, Madame!" he answered, "it is you, now, who are pleased to jest.
  Your husband is a great and powerful ambassador. I, unfortunately, have no
  career, no place in life save the place which the possession of a few
  millions gives to a successful financier."</p>

  <p>She laughed very softly, and again her eyes spoke to him. "Monsieur," she
  murmured, "you and I together could make a great alliance, is it not so?"</p>

  <p>"Madame," he faltered, doubtfully, "if one dared hope&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Once more the fire of her eyes, this time not only voluptuous. Was the man
  stupid, she wondered, or only cautious?</p>

  <p>"If that alliance were once concluded," she said, softly, "one might hope
  for everything."</p>

  <p>"If it rests only with me," he began, seriously, "oh, Madame!"</p>

  <p>He seemed overcome. Madame was gracious, but was he really stupid or only
  very much in earnest?</p>

  <p>"To be one of the world's money kings," she whispered, "it is
  wonderful&mdash;that. It is power&mdash;supreme, absolute power. There is
  nothing beyond, there is nothing greater."</p>

  <p>Then the Baron, who was watching her closely, caught another gleam in her
  eyes, and he began to understand. He had seen it before among a certain type
  of her countrywomen&mdash;the greed of money. He looked at her jewels and he
  remembered that, for an ambassador, her husband was reputed to be a poor man.
  The cloud of misgiving passed away from him; he settled down to the game.</p>

  <p>"If money could only buy the desire of one's heart," he murmured.
  "Alas!"</p>

  <p>His eyes seemed to seek out Monsieur de Lamborne among the moving throngs.
  She laughed softly, and her hand brushed his.</p>

  <p>"Money and one other thing, Monsieur le Baron," she whispered in his ear,
  "can buy the jewels from a crown&mdash;can buy, even, the heart of a
  woman&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A movement of approaching guests caught them up, and parted them for a
  time. The Baroness de Grost was at home from ten till one, and her rooms were
  crowded. The Baron found himself drawn on one side, a few minutes later, by
  Monsieur de Lamborne himself.</p>

  <p>"I have been looking for you, De Grost," the latter declared. "Where can
  we talk for a moment?"</p>

  <p>His host took the ambassador by the arm and led him into a retired corner.
  Monsieur de Lamborne was a tall, slight man, somewhat cadaverous looking,
  with large features, hollow eyes, thin but carefully arranged gray hair, and
  a pointed gray beard. He wore a frilled shirt, and an eye-glass suspended by
  a broad black ribbon hung down upon his chest. His face, as a rule, was
  imperturbable enough, but he had the air, just now, of a man greatly
  disturbed.</p>

  <p>"We cannot be overheard here," De Grost remarked. "It must be an affair of
  a few words only, though."</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Lamborne wasted no time in preliminaries. "This afternoon," he
  said, "I received from my Government papers of immense importance, which I am
  to hand over to your Foreign Minister at eleven o'clock to-morrow
  morning."</p>

  <p>The Baron nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>De Lamborne's thin fingers trembled as they played nervously with the
  ribbon of his eye-glass.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he continued, dropping his voice a little. "Bernadine has
  undertaken to send a copy of their contents to Berlin by to-morrow night's
  mail."</p>

  <p>"How do you know that?"</p>

  <p>The ambassador hesitated.</p>

  <p>"We, too, have spies at work," he remarked, grimly. "Bernadine wrote and
  sent a messenger with the letter to Berlin. The man's body is drifting down
  the Channel, but the letter is in my pocket."</p>

  <p>"The letter from Bernadine?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"What does he say?"</p>

  <p>"Simply that a verbatim copy of the document in question will be
  despatched to Berlin to-morrow evening, without fail."</p>

  <p>"There are no secrets between us," De Grost declared, smoothly. "What is
  the special importance of this document?"</p>

  <p>De Lamborne shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Since you ask," he said, "I will tell you. You know of the slight
  coolness which there has been between our respective Governments. Our people
  have felt that the policy of your ministers in expending all their energies
  and resources in the building of a great fleet to the utter neglect of your
  army is a wholly one-sided arrangement, so far as we are concerned. In the
  event of a simultaneous attack by Germany upon France and England, you would
  be utterly powerless to render us any measure of assistance. If Germany
  should attack England alone, it is the wish of your Government that we should
  be pledged to occupy Alsace-Lorraine. You, on the other hand, could do
  nothing for us, if Germany's first move were made against France."</p>

  <p>The Baron was deeply interested, although the matter was no new one to
  him.</p>

  <p>"Go on," he directed. "I am waiting for you to tell me the specific
  contents of this document."</p>

  <p>"The English Government has asked us two questions: first, how many
  complete army corps we consider she ought to place at our disposal in this
  eventuality; and, secondly, at what point should we expect them to be
  concentrated. The despatch which I received to-night contains the reply to
  these questions."</p>

  <p>"Which Bernadine has promised to forward to Berlin to-morrow night," the
  Baron remarked, softly.</p>

  <p>De Lamborne nodded.</p>

  <p>"You perceive," he said, "the immense importance of the affair. The very
  existence of that document is almost a casus belli."</p>

  <p>"At what time did the despatch arrive," the Baron asked, "and what has
  been its history since?"</p>

  <p>"It arrived at six o'clock, and went straight into the inner pocket of my
  coat; it has not been out of my possession for a single second. Even while I
  talk to you I can feel it."</p>

  <p>"And your plans? How are you intending to dispose of it to-night?"</p>

  <p>"On my return to the Embassy I shall place it in the safe, lock it up, and
  remain watching it until morning."</p>

  <p>"There doesn't seem to be much chance for Bernadine," the Baron remarked,
  thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"But there must be no chance&mdash;no chance at all," Monsieur de Lamborne
  asserted, with a note of passion in his thin voice. "It is incredible,
  preposterous, that he should even make the attempt. I want you to come home
  with me and share my vigil. You shall be my witness in case anything happens.
  We will watch together."</p>

  <p>De Grost reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Bernadine makes few mistakes," he said, thoughtfully. Monsieur de
  Lamborne passed his hand across his forehead.</p>

  <p>"Do I not know it?" he muttered. "In this instance, though, it seems
  impossible for him to succeed. The time is so short and the conditions so
  difficult. I may count upon your assistance, Baron?"</p>

  <p>The Baron drew from his pocket a crumpled piece of paper.</p>

  <p>"I received a telegram from headquarters this after noon," he said, "with
  instructions to place myself entirely at your disposal."</p>

  <p>"You will return with me, then, to the Embassy?" Monsieur de Lamborne
  asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>The Baron de Grost did not at once reply. He was standing in one of his
  characteristic attitudes, his hands clasped behind him, his head a little
  thrust forward, watching with every appearance of courteous interest the
  roomful of guests, stationary just now, listening to the performance of a
  famous violinist. It was, perhaps, by accident that his eyes met those of
  Madame de Lamborne, but she smiled at him subtly, more, perhaps, with her
  wonderful eyes than her lips themselves. She was the centre of a very
  brilliant group, a most beautiful woman holding court, as was only right and
  proper, among her admirers. The Baron sighed.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I shall not return with you, De Lamborne. I want you to
  follow my suggestions, if you will."</p>

  <p>"But, assuredly!"</p>

  <p>"Leave here early and go to your club. Remain there until one, then come
  to the Embassy. I shall be there awaiting your arrival."</p>

  <p>"You mean that you will go there alone? I do not understand," the
  ambassador protested. "Why should I go to my club? I do not at all
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, do as I say," De Grost insisted. "For the present, excuse
  me. I must look after my guests."</p>

  <p>The music had ceased, there was a movement toward the supper-room. The
  Baron offered his arm to Madame de Lamborne, who welcomed him with a
  brilliant smile. Her husband, although, for a Frenchman, he was by no means
  of a jealous disposition, was conscious of a vague feeling of uneasiness as
  he watched them pass out of the room together. A few minutes later he made
  his excuses to his wife and with a reluctance for which he could scarcely
  account left the house. There was something in the air, he felt, which he did
  not understand. He would not have admitted it to himself, but he more than
  half divined the truth. The vacant seat in his wife's carriage was filled
  that night by the Baron de Grost.</p>

  <p>At one o'clock precisely Monsieur de Lamborne returned to his house and
  heard with well-simulated interest that Monsieur le Baron de Grost awaited
  his arrival in the library. He found De Grost gazing with obvious respect at
  the ponderous safe let into the wall.</p>

  <p>"A very fine affair&mdash;this," he remarked, motioning with his head
  toward it.</p>

  <p>"The best of its kind," Monsieur de Lamborne admitted. "No burglar yet has
  ever succeeded in opening one of its type. Here is the packet," he added,
  drawing the document from his pocket. "You shall see me place it in safety
  myself."</p>

  <p>The Baron stretched out his hand and examined the sealed envelope for a
  moment closely. Then he moved to the writing-table, and, placing it upon the
  letter scales, made a note of its exact weight. Finally, he watched it
  deposited in the ponderous safe, suggested the word to which the lock was
  set, and closed the door. Monsieur de Lamborne heaved a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"I fancy this time," he said, "that our friends at Berlin will be
  disappointed. Couch or easy-chair, Baron?"</p>

  <p>"The couch, if you please," De Grost replied, "a strong cigar, and a long
  whiskey and soda. So! Now, for our vigil."</p>

  <p>The hours crawled away. Once De Grost sat up and listened.</p>

  <p>"Any rats about?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>The ambassador was indignant.</p>

  <p>"I have never heard one in my life," he answered. "This is quite a modern
  house."</p>

  <p>De Grost dropped his match-box and stooped to pick it up.</p>

  <p>"Any lights on anywhere, except in this room?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Monsieur de Lamborne answered. "It is past three o'clock,
  and every one has gone to bed."</p>

  <p>The Baron rose and softly unbolted the door. The passage outside was in
  darkness. He listened intently, for a moment, and returned, yawning.</p>

  <p>"One fancies things," he murmured, apologetically.</p>

  <p>"For example?" De Lamborne demanded.</p>

  <p>The Baron shook his head.</p>

  <p>"One mistakes," he declared. "The nerves become over sensitive."</p>

  <p>The dawn broke and the awakening hum of the city grew louder and louder.
  De Grost rose and stretched himself.</p>

  <p>"Your servants are moving about in the house," he remarked. "I think that
  we might consider our vigil at an end."</p>

  <p>Monsieur de Lamborne rose with alacrity.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said, "I feel that I have made false pretenses to you.
  With the day I have no fear. A thousand pardons for your sleepless
  night."</p>

  <p>"My sleepless night counts for nothing," the Baron assured him, "but,
  before I go, would it not be as well that we glance together inside the
  safe?"</p>

  <p>De Lamborne shook out his keys.</p>

  <p>"I was about to suggest it," he replied.</p>

  <p>The ambassador arranged the combination and pressed the lever. Slowly the
  great door swung back. The two men peered in.</p>

  <p>"Untouched!" De Lamborne exclaimed, a little note of triumph in his
  tone.</p>

  <p>De Grost said nothing, but held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Permit me," he interposed.</p>

  <p>De Lamborne was conscious of a faint sense of uneasiness. His companion
  walked across the room and carefully weighed the packet.</p>

  <p>"Well?" De Lamborne cried. "Why do you do that? What is wrong?"</p>

  <p>The Baron turned and faced him.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said, "this is not the same packet." The ambassador stared
  at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"You are jesting!" he exclaimed. "Miracles do not happen. The thing is
  impossible."</p>

  <p>"It is the impossible, then, which has happened," De Grost replied,
  swiftly. "This packet can scarcely have gained two ounces in the night.
  Besides, the seal is fuller. I have an eye for these details."</p>

  <p>De Lamborne leaned against the back of the table. His eyes were a little
  wild, but he laughed hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"We fight, then, against the creatures of another world," he declared. "No
  human being could have opened that safe last night."</p>

  <p>The Baron hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur de Lamborne," he said, "the room adjoining is your wife's."</p>

  <p>"It is the salon of Madame," the ambassador admitted.</p>

  <p>"What are the electrical appliances doing there?" the Baron demanded.
  "Don't look at me like that, De Lamborne. Remember that I was here before you
  arrived."</p>

  <p>"My wife takes an electric massage every day," Monsieur de Lamborne
  answered, in a hard, unnatural voice. "In what way is Monsieur le Baron
  concerned in my wife's doings?"</p>

  <p>"I think that there need be no answer to that question," De Grost said,
  quietly. "It is a greater tragedy which we have to face."</p>

  <p>Quick as lightning, the Frenchman's hand shot out. De Grost barely avoided
  the blow.</p>

  <p>"You shall answer to me for this, sir," De Lamborne cried. "It is the
  honor of my wife which you assail."</p>

  <p>"I maintain only," the Baron answered, "that your safe was entered from
  that room. A search will prove it."</p>

  <p>"There will be no search there," De Lamborne declared, fiercely. "I am the
  Ambassador of France, and my power under this roof is absolute. I say that
  you shall not cross that threshold."</p>

  <p>De Grost's expression did not change. Only his hands were suddenly
  outstretched with a curious gesture&mdash;the four fingers were raised, the
  thumbs depressed. Monsieur De Lamborne collapsed.</p>

  <p>"I submit," he muttered. "It is you who are the master. Search where you
  will."</p>

  <p>"Monsieur has arrived?" the woman demanded, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>The proprietor of the restaurant himself bowed a reply. His client was
  evidently well-known to him. He answered her in French&mdash;French, with a
  very guttural accent.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur has ascended some few minutes ago. Myself, I have not had the
  pleasure of wishing him bon aperitif, but Fritz announced his coming."</p>

  <p>The woman drew a little sigh of relief. A vague misgiving had troubled her
  during the last few hours. She raised her veil as she mounted the narrow
  staircase which led to the one private room at the Hotel de Lorraine. She
  entered, without tapping, the room at the head of the stairs, pushing open
  the ill-varnished door with its white-curtained top. At first she thought
  that the little apartment was empty.</p>

  <p>"Are you there?" she exclaimed, advancing a few steps.</p>

  <p>The figure of a man glided from behind the worn screen close by her side,
  and stood between her and the door.</p>

  <p>"Madame!" De Grost said, bowing low.</p>

  <p>Even then she scarcely realized that she was trapped. "You?" she cried.
  "You, Baron? But I do not understand. You have followed me here?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, Madame," he answered. "I have preceded you."</p>

  <p>Her colossal vanity triumphed over her natural astuteness. The man had
  employed spies to watch her! He had lost his head. It was an awkward matter,
  this, but it was to be arranged. She held out her hands.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," she said, "let me beg you now to go away. If you care to, come
  and see me this evening. I will explain everything. It is a little family
  affair which brings me here."</p>

  <p>"A family affair, Madame, with Bernadine, the enemy of France," De Grost
  declared, gravely.</p>

  <p>She collapsed miserably, her fingers grasping at the air, the cry which
  broke from her lips harsh and unnatural. Before he could tell what was
  happening, she was on her knees before him.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"Spare me!" she begged, trying to seize his hands.</p>

  <p>"Madame," De Grost answered, "I am not your judge. You will kindly hand
  over to me the document which you are carrying."</p>

  <p>She took it from the bosom of her dress. De Grost glanced at it, and
  placed it in his breast-pocket.</p>

  <p>"And now?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>De Grost sighed&mdash;she was a very beautiful woman.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said, "the career of a spy is, as you have doubtless
  sometimes realized, a dangerous one."</p>

  <p>"It is finished," she assured him, breathlessly. "Monsieur le Baron, you
  will keep my secret? Never again, I swear it, will I sin like this. You,
  yourself, shall be the trustee of my honor."</p>

  <p>Her eyes and arms besought him, but it was surely a changed
  man&mdash;this. There was none of the suaveness, the delicate responsiveness
  of her late host at Porchester House. The man who faced her now possessed the
  features of a sphinx. There was not even pity in his face.</p>

  <p>"You will not tell my husband?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Your husband already knows, Madame," was the quiet reply. "Only a few
  hours ago I proved to him whence had come the leakage of so many of our
  secrets lately."</p>

  <p>She swayed upon her feet.</p>

  <p>"He will never forgive me," she cried.</p>

  <p>"There are others," De Grost declared, "who forgive more rarely, even,
  than husbands."</p>

  <p>A sudden illuminating flash of horror told her the truth. She closed her
  eyes and tried to run from the room.</p>

  <p>"I will not be told," she screamed. "I will not hear. I do not know who
  you are. I will live a little longer."</p>

  <p>"Madame," De Grost said, "the Double-Four wages no war with women, save
  with spies only. The spy has no sex. For the sake of your family, permit me
  to send you back to your husband's house."</p>

  <p>That night, two receptions and a dinner party were postponed. All London
  was sympathizing with Monsieur de Lamborne, and a great many women swore
  never again to take a sleeping draught. Madame de Lamborne lay dead behind
  the shelter of those drawn blinds, and by her side an empty phial.</p>

  <h2>IV. THE MAN PROM THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Mar 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">Bernadine, sometimes called the Count von Hern, was lunching
  at the Savoy with the pretty wife of a Cabinet Minister, who was just
  sufficiently conscious of the impropriety of her action to render the
  situation interesting.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would tell me, Count von Hern," she said, soon after they had
  settled down in their places, "why my husband seems to object to you so much.
  I simply dared not tell him that we were going to lunch together, and as a
  rule he doesn't mind what I do in that way."</p>

  <p>Bernadine smiled slowly.</p>

  <p>"Ah, well," he remarked, "your husband is a politician and a very cautious
  man. I dare say he is like some of those others, who believe that, because I
  am a foreigner and live in London, therefore I am a spy."</p>

  <p>"You a spy," she laughed. "What nonsense!"</p>

  <p>"Why nonsense?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders. She was certainly a very pretty woman, and her
  black gown set off to fullest advantage her deep red hair and fair
  complexion.</p>

  <p>"I suppose because I can't imagine you anything of the sort," she
  declared. "You see, you hunt and play polo, and do everything which the
  ordinary Englishmen do. Then one meets you everywhere. I think, Count von
  Hern, that you are much too spoilt, for one thing, to take life
  seriously."</p>

  <p>"You do me an injustice," he murmured.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she chattered on, "I don't really know what spies do. One
  reads about them in these silly stories, but I have never felt sure that as
  live people they exist at all. Tell me, Count, what could a foreign spy do in
  England?"</p>

  <p>Bernadine twirled his fair moustache and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, my dear lady," he admitted, "I scarcely know what a spy could do
  nowadays. A few years ago, you English people were all so trusting. Your
  fortifications, your battleships, not to speak of your country itself, were
  wholly at the disposal of the enterprising foreigner who desired to acquire
  information. The party who governed Great Britain then seemed to have some
  strange idea that these things made for peace. To-day, however, all that is
  changed."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know something about it," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that mine is really only the superficial point of view," he
  answered, "but I do know that there is a good deal of information, which
  seems absolutely insignificant in itself, for which some foreign countries
  are willing to pay. For instance, there was a Cabinet Council yesterday, I
  believe, and some one was going to suggest that a secret, but official, visit
  be paid to your new harbor works up at Rosyth. An announcement will probably
  be made in the papers during the next few days as to whether the visit is to
  be undertaken or not. Yet there are countries who are willing to pay for
  knowing even such an insignificant item of news as that, a few hours before
  the rest of the world."</p>

  <p>Lady Maxwell laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well, I could earn that little sum of money," she declared gayly, "for my
  husband has just made me cancel a dinner-party for next Thursday, because he
  has to go up to the stupid place."</p>

  <p>Bernadine smiled. It was really a very unimportant matter, but he loved to
  feel, even in his idle moments, that he was not altogether wasting his
  time.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said, "that I am not myself acquainted with one of these
  mythical personages that I might return you the value of your marvelous
  information. If I dared think, however, that it would be in any way
  acceptable, I could offer you the diversion of a restaurant dinner-party for
  that night. The Duchess of Castleford has kindly offered to act as hostess
  for me and we are all going on to the Gaiety afterwards."</p>

  <p>"Delightful!" Lady Maxwell exclaimed. "I should love to come."</p>

  <p>Bernadine bowed.</p>

  <p>"You have, then, dear lady, fulfilled your destiny," he said. "You have
  given secret information to a foreign person of mysterious identity, and
  accepted payment."</p>

  <p>Now, Bernadine was a man of easy manners and unruffled composure. To the
  natural insouciance of his aristocratic bringing up, he had added the steely
  reserve of a man moving in the large world, engaged more often than not in
  some hazardous enterprise. Yet, for once in his life, and in the midst of the
  idlest of conversations, he gave himself away so utterly that even this woman
  with whom he was lunching&mdash;a very butterfly lady, indeed could not fail
  to perceive it. She looked at him in something like astonishment. Without the
  slightest warning his face had become set in a rigid stare, his eyes were
  filled with the expression of a man who sees into another world. The healthy
  color faded from his cheeks, he was white even to the parted lips, the wine
  dripped from his raised glass onto the tablecloth.</p>

  <p>"Why, whatever is the matter with you?" she demanded. "Is it a ghost that
  you see?"</p>

  <p>Bernadine's effort was superb, but he was too clever to deny the
  shock.</p>

  <p>"A ghost, indeed," he answered, "the ghost of a man whom every newspaper
  in Europe has declared to be dead."</p>

  <p>Her eyes followed his. The two people who were being ushered to a seat in
  their immediate vicinity were certainly of somewhat unusual appearance. The
  man was tall, and thin as a lath, and he wore the clothes of the fashionable
  world without awkwardness, yet with the air of one who was wholly
  unaccustomed to them. His cheek-bones were remarkably high, and receded so
  quickly towards his pointed chin that his cheeks were little more than
  hollows. His eyes were dry and burning, flashing here and there as though the
  man himself were continually oppressed by some furtive fear. His thick black
  hair was short cropped, his forehead high and intellectual. He was a strange
  figure, indeed, in such a gathering, and his companion only served to
  accentuate the anachronisms of his appearance. She was, above all things, a
  woman of the moment&mdash;fair, almost florid, a little thick-set, with
  tightly-laced, yet passable figure. Her eyes were blue, her hair
  light-colored. She wore magnificent furs, and, as she threw aside her boa,
  she disclosed a mass of jewelry around her neck and upon her bosom, almost
  barbaric in its profusion and setting.</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary couple!" Lady Maxwell whispered.</p>

  <p>Bernadine smiled.</p>

  <p>"The man looks as though he had stepped out of the Old Testament," he
  murmured.</p>

  <p>Lady Maxwell's interest was purely feminine, and was riveted now upon the
  jewelry worn by the woman. Bernadine, under the mask of his habitual
  indifference, which had easily reassumed, seemed to be looking away out of
  the restaurant into the great square of a half-savage city, looking at that
  marvelous crowd, numbered by their thousands, even by their hundreds of
  thousands, of men and women whose arms flashed out toward the snow-hung
  heavens, whose lips were parted in one chorus of rapturous acclamation;
  looking beyond them to the tall, emaciated form of the bare-headed priest in
  his long robes, his wind-tossed hair and wild eyes, standing alone before
  that multitude, in danger of death, or worse, at any moment&mdash;their idol,
  their hero. And again, as the memories came flooding into his brain, the
  scene passed away, and he saw the bare room with its whitewashed walls and
  blocked-up windows; he felt the darkness, lit only by those flickering
  candles. He saw the white, passion-wrung faces of the men who clustered
  together around the rude table, waiting; he heard their murmurs, he saw the
  fear born in their eyes. It was the night when their leader did not come.</p>

  <p>Bernadine poured himself out a glass of wine and drank it slowly. The
  mists were clearing away now. He was in London, at the Savoy Restaurant, and
  within a few yards of him sat the man with whose name all Europe once had
  rung&mdash;the man hailed by some as martyr, and loathed by others as the
  most fiendish Judas who ever drew breath. Bernadine was not concerned with
  the moral side of this strange encounter. How best to use his knowledge of
  this man's identity was the question which beat upon his brain. What use
  could be made of him, what profit for his country and himself? And then a
  fear&mdash;a sudden, startling fear. Little profit, perhaps, to be made, but
  the danger&mdash;the danger of this man alive with such secrets locked in his
  bosom! The thought itself was terrifying, and even as he realized it a
  significant thing happened&mdash;he caught the eye of the Baron de Grost,
  lunching alone at a small table just inside the restaurant.</p>

  <p>"You are not at all amusing," his guest declared. "It is nearly five
  minutes since you have spoken."</p>

  <p>"You, too, have been absorbed," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"It is that woman's jewels," she admitted. "I never saw anything more
  wonderful. The people are not English, of course. I wonder where they come
  from."</p>

  <p>"One of the Eastern countries, without a doubt," he replied,
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>Lady Maxwell sighed.</p>

  <p>"He is a peculiar-looking man," she said, "but one could put up with a
  good deal for jewels like that. What are you doing this
  afternoon&mdash;picture-galleries or your club?"</p>

  <p>"Neither, unfortunately," Bernadine answered. "I have promised to go with
  a friend to look at some polo ponies."</p>

  <p>"Do you know," she remarked, "that we have never been to see those
  Japanese prints yet?"</p>

  <p>"The gallery is closed until Monday," he assured her, falsely. "If you
  will honor me then, I shall be delighted."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders but said nothing. She had an idea that she was
  being dismissed, but Bernadine, without the least appearance of hurry, gave
  her no opportunity for any further suggestions. He handed her into the
  automobile, and returned at once into the restaurant. He touched Baron de
  Grost upon the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"My friend, the enemy!" he exclaimed, smiling.</p>

  <p>"At your service in either capacity," the Baron replied. Bernadine made a
  grimace and accepted the chair which De Grost had indicated.</p>

  <p>"If I may, I will take my coffee with you," he said. "I am growing old. It
  does not amuse me so much to lunch with a pretty woman. One has to entertain,
  and one forgets the serious business of lunching. I will take my coffee and
  cigarettes in peace."</p>

  <p>De Grost gave an order to the waiter and leaned back in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Now," he suggested, "tell me exactly what it is that has brought you back
  into the restaurant?"</p>

  <p>Bernadine shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Why not the pleasure of this few minutes' conversation with you?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>The Baron carefully selected a cigar, and lit it.</p>

  <p>"That," he said, "goes well, but there are other things."</p>

  <p>"As, for instance?"</p>

  <p>De Grost leaned back in his chair, and watched the smoke of his cigar curl
  upwards.</p>

  <p>"One talks too much," he remarked. "Before the cards are upon the table,
  it is not wise."</p>

  <p>They chatted upon various matters. De Grost himself seemed in no hurry to
  depart, nor did his companion show any signs of impatience. It was not until
  the two people whose entrance had had such a remarkable effect upon
  Bernadine, rose to leave, that the mask was, for a moment, lifted. De Grost
  had called for his bill and paid it. The two men strolled out together.</p>

  <p>"Baron," Bernadine said, suavely, linking his arm through the other man's
  as they passed into the foyer, "there are times when candor even among
  enemies becomes an admirable quality."</p>

  <p>"Those times, I imagine," De Grost answered, grimly, "are rare. Besides,
  who is to tell the real thing from the false?"</p>

  <p>"You do less than justice to your perceptions, my friend," Bernadine
  declared, smiling.</p>

  <p>De Grost merely shrugged his shoulders. Bernadine persisted.</p>

  <p>"Come," he continued, "since you doubt me, let me be the first to give you
  a proof that on this occasion, at any rate, I am candor itself. You had a
  purpose in lunching at the Savoy to-day. That purpose I have discovered by
  accident. We are both interested in those people." The Baron de Grost shook
  his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"Really," he began&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Let me finish," Bernadine insisted. "Perhaps when you have heard all that
  I have to say, you may change your attitude. We are interested in the same
  people, but in different ways. If we both move from opposite directions, our
  friend will vanish&mdash;he is clever enough at disappearing, as he has
  proved before. We do not want the same thing from him, I am convinced of
  that. Let us move together and made sure that he does not evade us."</p>

  <p>"Is it an alliance which you are proposing?" De Grost asked, with a quiet
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Why not? Enemies have united before to-day against a common foe."</p>

  <p>De Grost looked across the palm court to where the two people who formed
  the subject of their discussion were sitting in a corner, both smoking, both
  sipping some red-colored liqueur.</p>

  <p>"My dear Bernadine," he said, "I am much too afraid of you to listen any
  more. You fancy because this man's presence here was an entire surprise to
  you, and because you find me already on his track, that I know more than you
  do and that an alliance with me would be to your advantage. You would try to
  persuade me that your object with him would not be my object. Listen. I am
  afraid of you&mdash;you are too clever for me. I am going to leave you in
  sole possession."</p>

  <p>De Grost's tone was final and his bow valedictory. Bernadine watched him
  stroll in a leisurely way through the foyer, exchanging greetings here and
  there with friends, watched him enter the cloakroom, from which he emerged
  with his hat and overcoat, watched him step into his automobile and leave the
  restaurant. He turned back with a clouded face, and threw himself into an
  easy chair.</p>

  <p>Ten minutes passed uneventfully. People were passing backwards and
  forwards all the time, but Bernadine, through his half-closed eyes, did
  little save watch the couple in whom he was so deeply interested. At last the
  man rose, and, with a word of farewell to his companion, came out from the
  lounge, and made his way up the foyer, turning toward the hotel. He walked
  with quick, nervous strides, glancing now and then restlessly about him. In
  his eyes, to those who understood, there was the furtive gleam of the hunted
  man. It was the passing of one who was afraid.</p>

  <p>The woman, left to herself, began to look around her with some curiosity.
  Bernadine, to whom a new idea had occurred, moved his chair nearer to hers,
  and was rewarded by a glance which certainly betrayed some interest. A swift
  and unerring judge in such matters, he came to the instant conclusion that
  she was not unapproachable. He acted immediately and upon impulse. Rising to
  his feet, he approached her, and bowed easily but respectfully.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he said, "it is impossible that I am mistaken. I have had the
  pleasure, have I not, of meeting you in St. Petersburg?"</p>

  <p>Her first reception of his coming was reassuring enough. At his mention of
  St. Petersburg, however, she frowned.</p>

  <p>"I do not think so," she answered, in French. "You are mistaken. I do not
  know St. Petersburg."</p>

  <p>"Then it was in Paris," Bernadine continued, with conviction. "Madame is
  Parisian, without a doubt."</p>

  <p>She shook her head, smiling.</p>

  <p>"I do not think that I remember meeting you, Monsieur," she replied,
  doubtfully, "but perhaps&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She looked up, and her eyes dropped before his. He was certainly a very
  personable looking man, and she had spoken to no one for so many months.</p>

  <p>"Believe me, Madame, I could not possibly be mistaken," Bernadine assured
  her, smoothly. "You are staying here for long?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows!" she declared. "My husband he has, I think, what you call
  the wander fever. For myself, I am tired of it. In Rome we settle down, we
  stay five days, all seems pleasant, and suddenly my husband's whim carries us
  away without an hour's notice. The same thing at Monte Carlo, the same in
  Paris. Who can tell what will happen here? To tell you the truth, Monsieur,"
  she added, a little archly, "I think that if he were to come back at this
  moment, we should probably leave England to-night."</p>

  <p>"Your husband is very jealous?" Bernadine whispered, softly.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Partly jealous, and partly, he has the most terrible distaste for
  acquaintances. He will not speak to strangers himself, or suffer me to do so.
  It is sometimes&mdash;oh! it is sometimes very triste."</p>

  <p>"Madame has my sympathy," Bernadine assured her. "It is an impossible
  life&mdash;this. No husband should be so exacting."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with her round, blue eyes, a touch of added color in her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>"If one could but cure him!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"I would ask your permission to sit down," Bernadine remarked, "but I fear
  to intrude. You are afraid, perhaps, that your husband may return."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It will be better that you do not stay," she declared. "For a moment or
  two he is engaged. He has an appointment in his room with a gentleman, but
  one never knows how long he may be."</p>

  <p>"You have friends in London, then," Bernadine remarked, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"Of my husband's affairs," the woman said, "there is no one so ignorant as
  I. Yet since we left our own country, this is the first time I have known him
  willingly speak to a soul."</p>

  <p>"Your own country," Bernadine repeated, softly. "That was Russia, of
  course. Your husband's nationality is very apparent."</p>

  <p>The woman looked a little annoyed with herself. She remained silent.</p>

  <p>"May I not hope," Bernadine begged, "that you will give me the pleasure of
  meeting you again?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a moment.</p>

  <p>"He does not leave me," she replied. "I am not alone for five minutes
  during the day."</p>

  <p>Bernadine scribbled the name by which he was known in that locality, on a
  card, and passed it to her.</p>

  <p>"I have rooms in St. James's Street, quite close to here," he said. "If
  you could come and have tea with me to-day or to-morrow, it would give me the
  utmost pleasure."</p>

  <p>She took the card, and crumpled it in her hand. All the time, though, she
  shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur is very kind," she answered. "I am afraid&mdash;I do not think
  that it would be possible. And now, if you please, you must go away. I am
  terrified lest my husband should return."</p>

  <p>Bernadine bent low in a parting salute.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he pleaded, "you will come?"</p>

  <p>Bernadine was a handsome man, and he knew well enough how to use his soft
  and extraordinarily musical voice. He knew very well, as he retired, that
  somehow or other she would accept his invitation. Even then, he felt
  dissatisfied and ill at ease, as he left the place. He had made a little
  progress, but, after all, was it worth while? Supposing that the man with
  whom her husband was even at this moment closeted, was the Baron de Grost! He
  called a taxicab and drove at once to the Embassy of his country.</p>

  <p>Even at that moment, De Grost and the Russian&mdash;Paul Hagon he called
  himself&mdash;were standing face to face in the latter's sitting-room. No
  conventional greetings of any sort had been exchanged. De Grost had scarcely
  closed the door behind him before Hagon addressed him breathlessly, almost
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Who are you, sir," he demanded, "and what do you want with me?"</p>

  <p>"You had my letter?" De Grost inquired.</p>

  <p>"I had your letter," the other admitted. "It told me nothing. You speak of
  business. What business have I with any here?"</p>

  <p>"My business is soon told," De Grost replied, "but in the first place, I
  beg that you will not unnecessarily alarm yourself. There is, believe me, no
  need for it, no need whatever, although, to prevent misunderstandings, I may
  as well tell you at once that I am perfectly well aware who it is that I am
  addressing."</p>

  <p>Hagon collapsed into a chair. He buried his face in his hands and
  groaned.</p>

  <p>"I am not here necessarily as an enemy," De Grost continued. "You have
  very excellent reasons, I make no doubt, for remaining unknown in this city,
  or wherever you may be. As yet, let me assure you that your identity is not
  even suspected, except by myself and one other. Those few who believe you
  alive, believe that you are in America. There is no need for any one to know
  that Father&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Stop!" the man begged, piteously. "Stop!"</p>

  <p>De Grost bowed.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said.</p>

  <p>"Now tell me," the man demanded, "what is your price? I have had money.
  There is not much left. Sophia is extravagant and traveling costs a great
  deal. But why do I weary you with these things?" he added. "Let me know what
  I have to pay for your silence."</p>

  <p>"I am not a blackmailer," De Grost answered, sternly. "I am myself a
  wealthy man. I ask from you nothing in money&mdash;I ask you nothing in that
  way at all. A few words of information, and a certain paper, which I believe
  you have in your possession, is all that I require."</p>

  <p>"Information," Hagon repeated, shivering.</p>

  <p>"What I ask," De Grost declared, "is really a matter of justice. At the
  time when you were the idol of all Russia and the leader of the great
  revolutionary party, you received funds from abroad."</p>

  <p>"I accounted for them," Hagon muttered. "Up to a certain point I accounted
  for everything."</p>

  <p>"You received funds from the Government of a European power," De Grost
  continued, "funds to be applied towards developing the revolution. I want the
  name of that Power, and proof of what I say."</p>

  <p>Hagon remained motionless for a moment. He had seated himself at the
  table, his head resting upon his hand and his face turned away from De
  Grost.</p>

  <p>"You are a politician, then?" he asked, slowly.</p>

  <p>"I am a politician," De Grost admitted. "I represent a great secret power
  which has sprung into existence during the last few years. Our aim, at
  present, is to bring closer together your country and Great Britain. Russia
  hesitates because an actual rapprochement with us is equivalent to a
  permanent estrangement with Germany."</p>

  <p>Hagon nodded.</p>

  <p>"I understand," he said, in a low tone. "I have finished with politics. I
  have nothing to say to you."</p>

  <p>"I trust," De Grost persisted, suavely, "that you will be better
  advised."</p>

  <p>Hagon turned round and faced him.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he demanded, "do you believe that I am afraid of death?"</p>

  <p>De Grost looked at him steadfastly.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "you have proved the contrary."</p>

  <p>"If my identity is discovered," Hagon continued, "I have the means of
  instant death at hand. I do not use it because of my love for the one person
  who links me to this world. For her sake I live, and for her sake I bear
  always the memory of the shameful past. Publish my name and whereabouts, if
  you will. I promise you that I will make the tragedy complete. But for the
  rest, I refuse to pay your price. A great power trusted me, and whatever its
  motives may have been, its money came very near indeed to freeing my people.
  I have nothing more to say to you, sir."</p>

  <p>The Baron de Grost was taken aback. He had scarcely contemplated
  refusal.</p>

  <p>"You must understand," he explained, "that this is not a personal matter.
  Even if I myself would spare you, those who are more powerful than I will
  strike. The society to which I belong does not tolerate failure. I am
  empowered even to offer you its protection, if you will give me the
  information for which I ask."</p>

  <p>Hagon rose to his feet, and, before De Grost could foresee his purpose,
  had rung the bell.</p>

  <p>"My decision is unchanging," he said. "You can pull down the roof upon my
  head, but I carry next my heart an instant and unfailing means of
  escape."</p>

  <p>A waiter stood in the doorway.</p>

  <p>"You will take this gentleman to the lift," Hagon directed.</p>

  <p>There was once more a touch in his manner of that half divine authority
  which had thrilled the great multitude of his believers. De Grost was forced
  to admit defeat.</p>

  <p>"Not defeat," he said to himself, as he followed the man to the lift,
  "only a check."</p>

  <p>Nevertheless, it was a serious check. He could not, for the moment, see
  his way further. Arrived at his house, he followed his usual custom and made
  his way at once to his wife's rooms. Violet was resting upon a sofa, but laid
  down her book at his entrance.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he declared, "I have come for your advice."</p>

  <p>"He refuses, then?" she asked, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"Absolutely. What am I to do? Bernadine is already upon the scent. He saw
  him at the Savoy to-day, and recognized him."</p>

  <p>"Has Bernadine approached him yet?" Violet inquired.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. He is half afraid to move. I think he realizes, or will very
  soon, how serious this man's existence may be for Germany."</p>

  <p>Violet was thoughtful for several moments, then she looked up quickly.</p>

  <p>"Bernadine will try the woman," she asserted. "You say that Hagon is
  infatuated?"</p>

  <p>"Blindly," De Grost replied. "He scarcely lets her out of his sight."</p>

  <p>"Your people watch Bernadine?"</p>

  <p>"Always."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," Violet went on, "you will find that he will attempt an
  intrigue with the woman. The rest should be easy for you."</p>

  <p>De Grost sighed as he bent over his wife.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said, "there is no subtlety like the subtlety of a
  woman."</p>

  <p>Bernadine's instinct had not deceived him, and the following afternoon his
  servant, who had already received orders, silently ushered Madame Hagon into
  his apartments. She was wrapped in magnificent sables and heavily veiled.
  Bernadine saw at once that she was very nervous and wholly terrified. He
  welcomed her in as matter-of-fact a manner as possible.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he declared, "this is quite charming of you. You must sit in my
  easy-chair here, and my man shall bring us some tea. I drink mine always
  after the fashion of your country, with lemon, but I doubt whether we make it
  so well. Won't you unfasten your jacket? I am afraid that my rooms are rather
  warm."</p>

  <p>Madame had collected herself, but it was quite obvious that she was unused
  to adventures of this sort. Her hand, when he took it, trembled, and more
  than once she glanced furtively toward the door.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have come," she murmured. "I do not know why. It is not right for
  me to come. Yet there are times when I am weary, times when Paul seems fierce
  and when I am terrified. Sometimes I even wish that I were back&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your husband seems very highly strung," Bernadine remarked. "He has
  doubtless led an exciting life."</p>

  <p>"As to that," she replied, gazing around her now and gradually becoming
  more at her ease, "I know but little. He was a student professor at
  Moschaume, when I met him. I think that he was at one of the universities in
  St. Petersburg."</p>

  <p>Bernadine glanced at her covertly. It came to him as an inspiration that
  the woman did not know the truth.</p>

  <p>"You are from Russia, then, after all," he said, smiling. "I felt sure of
  it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," reluctantly. "Paul is so queer in these things. He will not let me
  talk of it. He prefers that we are taken for French people. Indeed, it is not
  I who desire to think too much of Russia. It is not a year since my father
  was killed in the riots, and two of my brothers were sent to Siberia."</p>

  <p>Bernadine was deeply interested.</p>

  <p>"They were among the revolutionaries?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered.</p>

  <p>"And your husband?"</p>

  <p>"He, too, was with them in sympathy. Secretly, too, I believe that he
  worked among them. Only he had to be careful. You see, his position at the
  college made it difficult."</p>

  <p>Bernadine looked into the woman's eyes and he knew then that she was
  speaking the truth. This man was, indeed, a great master; he had kept her in
  ignorance!</p>

  <p>"Always," Bernadine said, a few minutes later, as he passed her tea, "I
  read with the deepest interest of the people's movement in Russia. Tell me,
  what became eventually of their great leader&mdash;the wonderful Father
  Paul?"</p>

  <p>She set down her cup untasted, and her blue eyes flashed with a fire which
  turned them almost to the color of steel.</p>

  <p>"Wonderful indeed!" she exclaimed "Wonderful Judas! It was he who wrecked
  the cause. It was he who sold the lives and liberty of all of us for
  gold."</p>

  <p>"I heard a rumor of that," Bernadine remarked, "but I never believed
  it."</p>

  <p>"It was true," she declared passionately.</p>

  <p>"And where is he now?" Bernadine asked.</p>

  <p>"Dead!" she answered fiercely. "Torn to pieces, we believe, one night in a
  house near Moscow. May it be so!"</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment, as though engaged in prayer. Bernadine spoke
  no more of these things. He talked to her kindly, keeping up always his role
  of respectful but hopeful admirer.</p>

  <p>"You will come again soon?" he begged, when, at last, she insisted upon
  going.</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"It is so difficult," she murmured. "If my husband knew&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Bernadine laughed, and touched her fingers caressingly.</p>

  <p>"Need one tell him?" he whispered. "You see, I trust you. I pray that you
  will come-"</p>

  <p>Bernadine was a man rarely moved towards emotion of any sort. Yet even he
  was conscious of a certain sense of excitement, as he stood looking out upon
  the Embankment from the windows of Paul Hagon's sitting-room, a few days
  later. Madame was sitting on the sofa, close at hand. It was for her answer
  to a certain question that he waited.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," she said at last, turning slowly towards him, "it must be no.
  Indeed, I am sorry, for you have been very charming to me, and without you I
  should have been dull. But to come to your rooms and dine alone to-night, it
  is impossible."</p>

  <p>"Your husband cannot return before the morning, Bernadine reminded
  her.</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference," she answered. "Paul is sometimes fierce and
  rough, but he is generous, and all his life he has worshiped me. He behaves
  strangely at times, but I know that he cares&mdash;all the time more,
  perhaps, than I deserve."</p>

  <p>"And there is no one else," Bernadine asked softly, "who can claim even
  the smallest place in your heart?"</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," the woman begged, "you must not ask me that. I think that you
  had better go away."</p>

  <p>Bernadine stood quite still for several moments. It was the climax towards
  which he had steadfastly guided the course of this mild intrigue.</p>

  <p>"Madame," he declared, "you must not send me away. You shall not."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand.</p>

  <p>"Then you must not ask impossible things," she answered.</p>

  <p>Then Bernadine took the plunge. He became suddenly very grave.</p>

  <p>"Sophia," he said, "I am keeping a great secret from you and I can do it
  no longer. When you speak to me of your husband you drive me mad. If I
  believed that you really loved him, I would go away and leave it to chance
  whether or not you ever discovered the truth. As it is&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?" she interposed breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"As it is," he continued, "I am going to tell you now. Your husband has
  deceived you&mdash;he is deceiving you every moment."</p>

  <p>She looked at him incredulously.</p>

  <p>"You mean that there is another woman?"</p>

  <p>Bernadine shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Worse than that," he answered. "Your husband stole even your love under
  false pretenses. You think that his life is a strange one, that his nerves
  have broken down, that he flies from place to place for distraction, for
  change of scene. It is not so. He left Rome, he left Nice, he left Paris, for
  one and the same reason. He left because he was in peril of his life. I know
  little of your history, but I know as much as this. If ever a man deserved
  the fate from which he flees, your husband deserves it."</p>

  <p>"You are mad," she faltered.</p>

  <p>"No, I am sane," he went on. "It is you who are mad, not to have
  understood. Your husband goes ever in fear of his life. His real name is one
  branded with ignominy throughout the world. The man whom you have married, to
  whom you are so scrupulously faithful, is the man who sent your father to
  death and your brothers to Siberia."</p>

  <p>"Father Paul!" she screamed.</p>

  <p>"You have lived with him, you are his wife," Bernadine declared.</p>

  <p>The color had left her cheeks; her eyes, with their penciled brows, were
  fixed in an almost ghastly stare; her breath was coming in uneven gasps. She
  looked at him in silent terror.</p>

  <p>"It is not true," she cried at last; "it cannot be true."</p>

  <p>"Sophia," he said, "you can prove it for yourself. I know a little of your
  husband and his doings. Does he not carry always with him a black box which
  he will not allow out of his sight?"</p>

  <p>"Always," she assented. "How did you know? By night his hand rests upon
  it. By day, if he goes out, it is in my charge."</p>

  <p>"Fetch it now," Bernadine directed, "and I will prove my words."</p>

  <p>She did not hesitate for a moment. She disappeared into the inner room;
  and came back, only a few moments absent, carrying in her hand a black
  leather despatch-box.</p>

  <p>"You have the key?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered, looking at him and trembling, "but I dare
  not&mdash;oh, I dare not open it!"</p>

  <p>"Sophia," he said, "if my words are not true, I will pass out of your life
  for always. I challenge you. If you open that box you will know that your
  husband is, indeed, the greatest scoundrel in Europe."</p>

  <p>She drew a key from a gold chain around her neck.</p>

  <p>"There are two locks," she told him. "The other is a combination, but I
  know the word. Who's that?"</p>

  <p>She started suddenly. There was a loud tapping at the door. Bernadine
  threw an antimacassar half over the box, but he was too late. De Grost and
  Hagon had crossed the threshold. The woman stood like some dumb creature.
  Hagon, transfixed, stood with his eyes riveted upon Bernadine. His face was
  distorted with passion, he seemed like a man beside himself with fury. De
  Grost came slowly forward into the middle of the room.</p>

  <p>"Count von Hern," he said, "I think that you had better leave."</p>

  <p>The woman found words.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," she cried, "not yet! Paul, listen to me. This man has told me a
  terrible thing."</p>

  <p>The breath seemed to come through Hagon's teeth like a hiss.</p>

  <p>"He has told you!"</p>

  <p>"Listen to me," she continued. "It is the truth which you must tell now.
  He says that you&mdash;you are Father Paul."</p>

  <p>Hagon did not hesitate for a second.</p>

  <p>"It is true," he admitted.</p>

  <p>Then there was a silence&mdash;short, but tragical. Hagon seemed suddenly
  to have collapsed. He was like a man who has just had a stroke. He stood
  muttering to himself.</p>

  <p>"It is the end&mdash;this&mdash;the end!" he said, in a low tone.
  "Sophia!"</p>

  <p>She shrank away from him. He drew himself up. Once more the great light
  flashed in his face.</p>

  <p>"It was for your sake," he said simply, "for your sake, Sophia. I came to
  you poor and you would have nothing to say to me. My love for you burned in
  my veins like fever. It was for you I did it&mdash;for your sake I sold my
  honor, the love of my country, the freedom of my brothers. For your sake I
  risked an awful death. For your sake I have lived like a hunted man, with the
  cry of the wolves always in my ears, and the fear of death and of eternal
  torture with me day by day. No other man since the world was made has done
  more. Have pity on me!"</p>

  <p>She was unmoved; her face had lost all expression. No one noticed in that
  rapt moment that Bernadine had crept from the room.</p>

  <p>"It was you," she cried, "who killed my father, and sent my brothers into
  exile."</p>

  <p>"God help me!" he moaned.</p>

  <p>She turned to De Grost.</p>

  <p>"Take him away with you, please," she said. "I have finished with
  him."</p>

  <p>"Sophia!" he pleaded.</p>

  <p>She leaned across the table and struck him heavily upon the cheek.</p>

  <p>"If you stay here," she muttered, "I shall kill you myself...."</p>

  <p>That night, the body of an unknown foreigner was found in the attic of a
  cheap lodging-house in Soho. The discovery itself and the verdict at the
  inquest occupied only a few lines in the morning newspapers. Those few lines
  were the epitaph of one who was very nearly a Rienzi. The greater part of his
  papers De Grost mercifully destroyed, but one in particular he preserved.
  Within a week the much delayed treaty was signed at Paris, London and St.
  Petersburg.</p>

  <h2>V. THE FIRST SHOT</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Apr 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">De Grost and his wife were dining together at the corner
  table in a fashionable but somewhat Bohemian restaurant. Both had been in the
  humor for reminiscences, and they had outstayed most of their neighbors.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what people really think of us," Violet remarked pensively. "I
  told Lady Amershal, when she asked us to go there this evening, that we
  always dined together alone somewhere once a week, and she absolutely refused
  to believe me. 'With your own husband, my dear?' She kept on repeating."</p>

  <p>"Her Ladyship's tastes are more catholic," the Baron declared dryly. "Yet,
  after all, Violet, the real philosophy of married life demands something of
  this sort."</p>

  <p>Violet smiled and fingered her pearls for a minute.</p>

  <p>"What the real philosophy of married life may be I do not know," she said,
  "but I am perfectly content with our rendering of it. What a fortunate thing,
  Peter, with your intensely practical turn of mind, that nature endowed you
  with so much sentiment."</p>

  <p>De Grost gazed reflectively at the cigarette which he had just selected
  from his case.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked, "there have been times when I have cursed myself for
  a fool, but, on the whole, sentiment keeps many fires burning."</p>

  <p>She leaned towards him and dropped her voice a little. "Tell me," she
  begged, "do you ever think of the years we spent together in the country? Do
  you ever regret?"</p>

  <p>He smiled thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"It is a hard question, that," he admitted. "There were days there which I
  loved, but there were days, too, when the restlessness came, days when I
  longed to hear the hum of the city and to hear men speak whose words were of
  life and death and the great passions. I am not sure, Violet, whether, after
  all, it is well for one who has lived to withdraw absolutely from the thrill
  of life."</p>

  <p>She laughed, Softly but gayly.</p>

  <p>"I am with you," she declared, "absolutely. I think that the fairies must
  have poured into my blood the joy of living for its own sake. I should be an
  ungrateful woman indeed, if I found anything to complain of, nowadays. Yet
  there is one thing that troubles me," she went on, after a moment's
  pause.</p>

  <p>"And that?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The danger," she said, slowly. "I do not want to lose you, Peter. There
  are times when I am afraid."</p>

  <p>De Grost flicked the ash from his cigarette.</p>

  <p>"The days are passing," he remarked, "when men point revolvers at one
  another, and hire assassins to gain their ends. Now, it is more a battle of
  wits. We play chess on the board of Life still, but we play with ivory pieces
  instead of steel and poison. Our brains direct and not our muscles."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"It is only the one man of whom I am afraid. You have outwitted him so
  often and he does not forgive."</p>

  <p>De Grost smiled. It was an immense compliment&mdash;this.</p>

  <p>"Bernadine," he murmured, softly, "otherwise, our friend the Count von
  Hern."</p>

  <p>"Bernadine!" she repeated. "All that you say is true, but when one fails
  with modern weapons, one changes the form of attack. Bernadine at heart is a
  savage."</p>

  <p>"The hate of such a man," De Grost remarked complacently, "is worth
  having. He has had his own way over here for years. He seems to have found
  the knack of living in a maze of intrigue and remaining untouchable. There
  were a dozen things before I came upon the scene which ought to have ruined
  him. Yet there never appeared to be anything to take hold of. Even the
  Criminal Department once thought they had a chance. I remember John Dory
  telling me in disgust that Bernadine was like one of those marvelous
  criminals one only reads about in fiction, who seem, when they pass along the
  dangerous places, to walk upon the air, and, leave no trace behind."</p>

  <p>"Before you came," she said, "he had never known a failure. Do you think
  that he is a man likely to forgive?"</p>

  <p>"I do not," De Grost answered grimly. "It is a battle, of course, a battle
  all the time. Yet, Violet, between you and me, if Bernadine were to go, half
  the savor of life for me would depart with him."</p>

  <p>Then there came a curious and wholly unexpected interruption. A man in
  dark, plain clothes, still wearing his overcoat, and carrying a bowler hat,
  had been standing in the entrance of the restaurant for a moment or two,
  looking around the room as though in search of some one. At last he caught
  the eye of the Baron de Grost and came quickly toward him.</p>

  <p>"Charles," the Baron remarked, raising his eyebrows. "I wonder what he
  wants."</p>

  <p>A sudden cloud had fallen upon their little feast. Violet watched the
  coming of her husband's servant, and the reading of the note which he
  presented to his master, with an anxiety which she could not wholly conceal.
  The Baron read the note twice, scrutinizing a certain part of it closely with
  the aid of the monocle which he seldom used. Then he folded it up and placed
  it in the breast pocket of his coat.</p>

  <p>"At what hour did you receive this, Charles?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"A messenger brought it in a taxicab about ten minutes ago, sir," the man
  replied. "He said that it was of the utmost importance, and that I had better
  try and find you."</p>

  <p>"A district messenger?"</p>

  <p>"A man in ordinary clothes," Charles answered. "He looked like a porter in
  a warehouse, or something of that sort. I forgot to say that you were rung up
  on the telephone three times previously by Mr. Greening."</p>

  <p>The Baron nodded.</p>

  <p>"You can go," he said. "There is no reply."</p>

  <p>The man bowed and retired. De Grost called for his bill.</p>

  <p>"Is it anything serious?" Violet inquired.</p>

  <p>"No, not exactly serious," he answered. "I do not understand what has
  happened, but they have sent for me to go&mdash;well, where it was agreed
  that I should not go except as a matter of urgent necessity."</p>

  <p>Violet knew better than to show any signs of disquietude.</p>

  <p>"It is in London?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," her husband replied. "I shall take a taxicab from here. I am
  sorry, dear, to have one of our evenings disturbed in this manner. I have
  always done my best to avoid it, but this summons is urgent."</p>

  <p>She rose and he wrapped her cloak around her.</p>

  <p>"You will drive straight home, won't you?" he begged. "I dare say that I
  may be back within an hour myself."</p>

  <p>"And if not?" she asked, in a low tone.</p>

  <p>"If not, there is nothing to be done."</p>

  <p>Violet bit her lip, but, as he handed her into the small electric brougham
  which was waiting, she smiled into his face.</p>

  <p>"You will come back, and soon, Peter," she declared, confidently.
  "Wherever you go I am sure of that. You see, I have faith in my star which
  watches over you."</p>

  <p>He kissed her fingers and turned away. The commissionaire had already
  called him a taxicab.</p>

  <p>"To London Bridge," he ordered, after a moment's hesitation, and drove
  off.</p>

  <p>The traffic citywards had long since finished for the day, and he reached
  his destination within ten minutes of leaving the restaurant. Here he paid
  the man, and, entering the station, turned to the refreshment room and
  ordered a liqueur brandy. While he sipped it, he smoked a cigarette and
  carefully reread in a strong light the note which he had received. The
  signature especially he pored over for some time. At last, however, he
  replaced it in his pocket, paid his bill, and, stepping out once more on to
  the platform, entered a telephone booth. A few minutes later he left the
  station, and, turning to the right, walked slowly as far as Tooley Street. He
  kept on the right-hand side until he arrived at the spot where the great
  arches, with their scanty lights, make a gloomy thoroughfare into Bermondsey.
  In the shadow of the first of these he paused, and looked steadfastly across
  the street. There were few people passing and practically no traffic. In
  front of him was a row of warehouses, all save one of which was wrapped in
  complete darkness. It was the one where some lights were still burning which
  De Grost stood and watched.</p>

  <p>The lights, such as they were, seemed to illuminate the ground floor only.
  From his hidden post he could see the shoulders of a man apparently bending
  over a ledger, diligently writing. At the next window a youth, seated upon a
  tall stool, was engaged in presumably the same occupation. There was nothing
  about the place in the least mysterious or out of the way. Even the blinds of
  the offices had been left undrawn. The man and the boy, who were alone
  visible, seemed, in a sense, to be working under protest. Every now and then
  the former stopped to yawn, and the latter performed a difficult balancing
  feat upon his stool. De Grost, having satisfied his curiosity, came presently
  from his shelter, almost running into the arms of a policeman, who looked at
  him closely. The Baron, who had an unlighted cigarette in his mouth, stopped
  to ask for a light, and his appearance at once set at rest any suspicions the
  policeman might have had.</p>

  <p>"I have a warehouse myself down in these parts," he remarked, as he struck
  the match, "but I don't allow my people to work as late as that."</p>

  <p>He pointed across the way, and the policeman smiled.</p>

  <p>"They are very often late there, sir," he said. "It's a Continental wine
  business, and there's always one or two of them over time."</p>

  <p>"It's bad business, all the same," De Grost declared pleasantly. "Good
  night, policeman!"</p>

  <p>"Good night, sir!"</p>

  <p>De Grost crossed the road diagonally, as though about to take the short
  cut across London Bridge, but as soon as the policeman was out of sight he
  retraced his steps to the building which they had been discussing, and
  turning the battered brass handle of the door, walked calmly in. On his right
  and left were counting houses framed with glass; in front, the cavernous and
  ugly depths of a gloomy warehouse. He knocked upon the window-pane on the
  right and passed forward a step or two, as though to enter the office. The
  boy, who had been engaged in the left-hand counting house, came gliding from
  his place, passed silently behind the visitor and turned the key of the outer
  door. What followed seemed to happen as though by some mysteriously directed
  force. The figures of men came stealing out from the hidden places. The clerk
  who had been working so hard at his desk calmly divested himself of a false
  mustache and wig, and, assuming a more familiar appearance, strolled out into
  the warehouse. De Grost looked around him with absolutely unruffled
  composure. He was the centre of a little circle of men, respectably dressed,
  but every one of them hard-featured, with something in their faces which
  suggested not the ordinary toiler, but the fighting animal&mdash;the man who
  lives by his wits and knows something of danger. On the outskirts of the
  circle stood Bernadine.</p>

  <p>"Really," De Grost declared, "this is most unexpected. In the matter of
  dramatic surprises, my friend Bernadine, you are certainly in a class by
  yourself."</p>

  <p>Bernadine smiled.</p>

  <p>"You will understand, of course," he said, "that this little entertainment
  is entirely for your amusement&mdash;well stage-managed, perhaps, but my
  supers are not to be taken seriously. Since you are here, Baron, might I ask
  you to precede me a few steps to the tasting office?</p>

  <p>"By all means," De Grost answered cheerfully. "It is this way, I
  believe."</p>

  <p>He walked with unconcerned footsteps down the warehouse, on either side of
  which were great bins and a wilderness of racking, until he came to a small,
  glass-enclosed office, built out from the wall. Without hesitation he entered
  it, and removing his hat, selected the more comfortable of the two chairs.
  Bernadine alone of the others followed him inside, closing the door behind.
  De Grost, who appeared exceedingly comfortable, stretched out his hand and
  took a small black bottle from a tiny mahogany racking fixed against the wall
  by his side.</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me, my dear Bernadine," he said, "but I see my friend
  Greening has been tasting a few wines. The 'XX' upon the label here signifies
  approval. With your permission."</p>

  <p>He half filled a glass and pushed the bottle toward Bernadine.</p>

  <p>"Greening's taste is unimpeachable," De Grost declared, setting down his
  glass empty. "No use being a director of a city business, you know, unless
  one interests oneself personally in it. Greening's judgment is simply
  marvelous. I have never tasted a more beautiful wine. If the boom in sherry
  does come," he continued complacently, "we shall be in an excellent position
  to deal with it."</p>

  <p>Bernadine laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my friend&mdash;Peter Ruff, or Baron de Grost, or whatever you may
  choose to call yourself," he said, "I am indeed wise to have come to the
  conclusion that you and I are too big to occupy the same little spot on
  earth!"</p>

  <p>De Grost nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"I was beginning to wonder," he remarked, "whether you would not soon
  arrive at that decision."</p>

  <p>"Having arrived at it," Bernadine continued, looking intently at his
  companion, "the logical sequence naturally occurs to you."</p>

  <p>"Precisely, my dear Bernadine," De Grost asserted. "You say to yourself,
  no doubt, 'One of us two must go!' Being yourself, you would naturally
  conclude that it must be I. To tell you the truth, I have been expecting some
  sort of enterprise of this description for a considerable time."</p>

  <p>Bernadine shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Your expectations," he said, "seem scarcely to have provided you with a
  safe conduct."</p>

  <p>De Grost gazed reflectively into his empty glass.</p>

  <p>"You see," he explained, "I am such a lucky person. Your arrangements
  to-night, however, are, I perceive, unusually complete."</p>

  <p>"I am glad you appreciate them," Bernadine remarked dryly.</p>

  <p>"I would not for a moment," De Grost continued, "ask an impertinent or an
  unnecessary question, but I must confess that I am rather concerned to know
  the fate of my manager&mdash;the gentleman whom you yourself with the aid, I
  presume, of Mr. Clarkson, so ably represented."</p>

  <p>Bernadine sighed.</p>

  <p>"Alas!" he said, "your manager was a very obstinate person."</p>

  <p>"And my clerk?"</p>

  <p>"Incorruptible, absolutely incorruptible. I congratulate you, De Grost.
  Your society is one of the most wonderful upon the face of this earth. I know
  little about it, but my admiration is very sincere. Their attention to
  details, and the personnel of their staff, is almost perfect. I may tell you
  at once that no sum that could be offered, tempted either of these men."</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to hear it," De Grost replied, "but I must plead guilty to
  a little temporary anxiety as to their present whereabouts."</p>

  <p>"At this moment," Bernadine remarked, "they are within a few feet of us,
  but, as you are doubtless aware, access to your delightful river is
  obtainable from these premises. To be frank with you, my dear Baron, we are
  waiting for the tide to rise."</p>

  <p>"So thoughtful about these trifles," De Grost murmured. "But their present
  position? They are, I trust, not uncomfortable?"</p>

  <p>Bernadine stood up and moved to the further end of the office. He beckoned
  his companion to his side and, drawing an electric torch from his pocket,
  flashed the light into a dark corner behind an immense bin. The forms of a
  man and a youth, bound with ropes and gagged, lay stretched upon the floor.
  De Grost sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that Mr. Greening, at any rate, is most
  uncomfortable."</p>

  <p>Bernadine turned off the light.</p>

  <p>"At least, Baron," he declared, "if such extreme measures should become
  necessary, I can promise you one thing&mdash;you shall have a quicker passage
  into Eternity than they."</p>

  <p>De Grost resumed his seat.</p>

  <p>"Has it really come to that?" he asked. "Will nothing but so crude a
  proceeding as my absolute removal satisfy you?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing else is, I fear, practicable," Bernadine replied, "unless you
  decide to listen to reason. Believe me, my dear friend, I shall miss you and
  our small encounters exceedingly, but, unfortunately, you stand in the way of
  my career. You are the only man who has persistently balked me. You have
  driven me to use against you means which I had grown to look upon as
  absolutely extinct in the upper circles of our profession."</p>

  <p>De Grost peered through the glass walls of the office.</p>

  <p>"Eight men, not counting yourself," he remarked, "and my poor manager and
  his faithful clerk lying bound and helpless. It is heavy odds,
  Bernadine."</p>

  <p>"There is no question of odds, I think," Bernadine answered smoothly. "You
  are much too clever a person to refuse to admit that you are entirely in my
  power."</p>

  <p>"And as regards terms? I really don't feel in the least anxious to make my
  final bow with so little notice," De Grost said. "To tell you the truth, I
  have been finding life quite interesting lately."</p>

  <p>Bernadine eyed his prisoner keenly. Such absolute composure was in itself
  disturbing. He was, for the moment, aware of a slight sensation of
  uneasiness, which his common sense, however, speedily disposed of.</p>

  <p>"There are two ways," he announced, "of dealing with an opponent. There is
  the old-fashioned one&mdash;crude, but in a sense eminently
  satisfactory&mdash;which sends him finally to adorn some other sphere."</p>

  <p>"I don't like that one," De Grost interrupted. "Get on with the
  alternative."</p>

  <p>"The alternative," Bernadine declared, "is when his capacity for harm can
  be destroyed."</p>

  <p>"That needs a little explanation," De Grost murmured.</p>

  <p>"Precisely. For instance, if you were to become absolutely discredited, I
  think that you would be effectually out of my way. Your people do not
  forgive."</p>

  <p>"Then discredit me, by all means," De Grost begged. "It sounds unpleasant,
  but I do not like your callous reference to the river."</p>

  <p>Bernadine gazed at his ancient opponent for several moments. After all,
  what was this but the splendid bravado of a beaten man, who is too clever not
  to recognize defeat?</p>

  <p>"I shall require," he said, "your code, the keys of your safe, which
  contains a great many documents of interest to me, and a free entry into your
  house."</p>

  <p>De Grost drew a bunch of keys reluctantly from his pocket and laid them
  upon the desk.</p>

  <p>"You will find the code bound in green morocco leather," he announced, "on
  the left-hand side, underneath the duplicate of a proposed Treaty between
  Italy and some other Power. Between ourselves, Bernadine, I really expect
  that that is what you are after."</p>

  <p>Bernadine's eyes glistened.</p>

  <p>"What about the safe conduct into your house?" he asked.</p>

  <p>De Grost drew his case from his pocket and wrote few lines on the back of
  one of his cards.</p>

  <p>"This will insure you entrance there," he said, "and access to my study.
  If you see my wife, please reassure her as to my absence."</p>

  <p>"I shall certainly do so," Bernadine agreed, with a faint smile.</p>

  <p>"If I may be pardoned for alluding to a purely personal matter," De Grost
  continued, "what is to become of me?"</p>

  <p>"You will be bound and gagged in the same manner as your manager and his
  clerk," Bernadine replied, smoothly. "I regret the necessity, but you see, I
  can afford to run no risks. At four o'clock in the morning, you will be
  released. It must be part of our agreement that you allow the man who stays
  behind the others for the purpose of setting you free, to depart unmolested.
  I think I know you better than to imagine you would be guilty of such
  gaucherie as an appeal to the police."</p>

  <p>"That, unfortunately," De Grost declared, with a little sigh, "is, as you
  well know, out of the question. You are too clever for me, Bernadine. After
  all, I shall have to go back to my farm."</p>

  <p>Bernadine opened the door and called softly to one of his men. In less
  than five minutes De Grost was bound hand and foot. Bernadine stepped back
  and eyed his adversary with an air of ill-disguised triumph.</p>

  <p>"I trust, Baron," he said, "that you will be as comfortable as possible,
  under the circumstances."</p>

  <p>De Grost lay quite still. He was powerless to move or speak.</p>

  <p>"Immediately," Bernadine continued, "I have presented myself at your
  house, verified your safe conduct, and helped myself to certain papers which
  I am exceedingly anxious to obtain," he went on, "I shall telephone here to
  the man whom I leave in charge and you will be set at liberty in due course.
  If, for any reason, I meet with treachery and I do not telephone, you will
  join Mr. Greening and his young companion in a little&mdash;shall we call it
  aquatic recreation? I wish you a pleasant hour and success in the future,
  Baron&mdash;as a farmer."</p>

  <p>Bernadine withdrew and whispered his orders to his men. Soon the electric
  light was turned out and the place was in darkness. The front door was opened
  and closed; the group of confederates upon the pavement lit cigarettes and
  wished one another good night with the brisk air of tired employees, released
  at last from long labors. Then there was silence.</p>

  <p>It was barely eleven when Bernadine reached the west end of London. His
  clothes had become a trifle disarranged and he called for a few minutes at
  his rooms in St. James's Street. Afterwards, he walked to Porchester House
  and rang the bell. To the servant who answered it, he handed his master's
  card.</p>

  <p>"Will you show me the way to the library?" he asked. "I have some papers
  to collect for the Baron de Grost."</p>

  <p>The man hesitated. Even with the card in his hand, it seemed a somewhat
  unusual proceeding.</p>

  <p>"Will you step inside, sir?" he begged. "I should like to show this to the
  Baroness. The master is exceedingly particular about any one entering his
  study."</p>

  <p>"Do what you like so long as you do not keep me waiting," Bernadine
  replied. "Your master's instructions are clear enough."</p>

  <p>Violet came down the great staircase a few moments later, still in her
  dinner gown, her face a little pale, her eyes luminous. Bernadine smiled as
  he accepted her eagerly offered hand. She was evidently anxious. A thrill of
  triumph warmed his blood. Once she had been less kind to him than she seemed
  now.</p>

  <p>"My husband gave you this!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"A few minutes ago," Bernadine answered. "He tried to make his
  instructions as clear as possible. We are jointly interested in a small
  matter which needs immediate action."</p>

  <p>She led the way to the study.</p>

  <p>"It seems strange," she remarked, "that you and he should be working
  together. I always thought that you were on opposite sides."</p>

  <p>"It is a matter of chance," Bernadine told her. "Your husband is a wise
  man, Baroness. He knows when to listen to reason."</p>

  <p>She threw open the door of the study, which was in darkness.</p>

  <p>"'If you will wait a moment," she said, closing the door, "I will turn on
  the electric light."</p>

  <p>She touched the knobs in the wall and the room was suddenly flooded with
  illumination. At the further end of the apartment was the great safe. Close
  to it, in an easy chair, his evening coat changed for a smoking jacket, with
  a neatly tied black tie replacing his crumpled white cravat, the Baron de
  Grost sat awaiting his guest. A fierce oath broke from Bernadine's lips. He
  turned toward the door only in time to hear the key turn. Violet tossed it
  lightly in the air across to her husband.</p>

  <p>"My dear Bernadine," the latter remarked, "on the whole, I do not think
  that this has been one of your successes. My keys, if you please."</p>

  <p>Bernadine stood for a moment, his face dark with passion. He bit his lip
  till the blood came, and the veins at the back of his clenched hands were
  swollen and thick. Nevertheless, when he spoke he had recovered in great
  measure his self-control.</p>

  <p>"Your keys are here, Baron de Grost," he said, placing them upon the
  table. "If a bungling amateur may make such a request of a professor, may I
  inquire how you escaped from your bonds, passed through the door of a locked
  warehouse and reached here before me?"</p>

  <p>The Baron de Grost smiled as he pushed the cigarettes across to his
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "you have only to think for yourself for a moment, my
  dear Bernadine, and you will understand. In the first place, the letter you
  sent me signed 'Greening' was clearly a forgery. There was no one else
  anxious to get me into their power, hence I associated it at once with you.
  Naturally, I telephoned to the chief of my staff&mdash;I, too, am obliged to
  employ some of these un-uniformed policemen, my dear Bernadine, as you may be
  aware. It may interest you to know, further, that there are seven entrances
  to the warehouse in Tooley Street. Through one of these something like twenty
  of my men passed and were already concealed in the place when I entered. At
  another of the doors a motor-car waited for me. If I had chosen to lift my
  finger at any time, your men would have been overpowered and I might have had
  the pleasure of dictating terms to you in my own office. Such a course did
  not appeal to me. You and I, as you know, dear Count von Hern, conduct our
  peculiar business under very delicate conditions, and the least thing we
  either of us desire is notoriety. I managed things, as I thought, for the
  best. The moment you left the place my men swarmed in. We kindly, but gently,
  ejected your guard, released Greening and my clerk, and I passed you myself
  in Fleet Street, a little more comfortable, I think, in my forty-horsepower
  motor-car than you in that very disreputable hansom. As to my presence here,
  I have an entrance from the street there which makes me independent of my
  servants. The other details are too absurdly simple; one need not enlarge
  upon them."</p>

  <p>Bernadine turned slowly to Violet.</p>

  <p>"You knew?" he muttered. "You knew when you brought me here?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," she answered. "We have telephones in every room in the
  house."</p>

  <p>"I am at your service," Bernadine declared, calmly.</p>

  <p>De Grost laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "need I say that you are free to come or go, to
  take a whiskey and soda with me, or to depart at once, exactly as you feel
  inclined? The door was locked only until you restored to me my keys."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room, fitted the key in the lock and turned it.</p>

  <p>"We do not make war as those others," he remarked, smiling.</p>

  <p>Bernadine drew himself up.</p>

  <p>"I will not drink with you," he said, "I will not smoke with you. But some
  day this reckoning shall come."</p>

  <p>He turned to the door. De Grost laid his finger upon the bell.</p>

  <p>"Show Count von Hern out," he directed the astonished servant who appeared
  a moment or two later.</p>

  <h2>VI. THE SEVEN SUPPERS OF ANDREA KORUST</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), May 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">Peter, Baron de Grost, was enjoying what he had confidently
  looked forward to as an evening's relaxation, pure and simple. He sat in one
  of the front rows of the stalls of the Alhambra, his wife by his side and an
  excellent cigar in his mouth. An hour or so ago he had been in telephonic
  communication with Paris, had spoken with Sogrange himself, and received his
  assurance of a calm in political and criminal affairs amounting almost to
  stagnation. It was out of season, and, though his popularity was as great as
  ever, neither he nor his wife had any social engagements; hence this evening
  at a music hall, which Peter, for his part, was finding thoroughly
  amusing.</p>

  <p>The place was packed&mdash;some said owing to the engagement of Andrea
  Korust and his brother, others to the presence of Mademoiselle Sophie Celaire
  in her wonderful danse des apaches. The violinist that night had a great
  reception. Three times he was called before the curtain; three times he was
  obliged to reiterate his grateful but immutable resolve never to yield to the
  nightly storm which demanded more from a man who has given of his best. Slim,
  with the worn face and hollow eyes of a genius, he stood and bowed his
  thanks, but when he thought the time had arrived, he disappeared, and though
  the house shook for minutes afterwards, nothing could persuade him to
  reappear.</p>

  <p>Afterwards came the turn which, notwithstanding the furore caused by
  Andrea Korust's appearance, was generally considered to be equally
  responsible for the packed house&mdash;the apache dance of Mademoiselle
  Sophie Celaire. Peter sat slightly forward in his chair as the curtain went
  up. For a time he seemed utterly absorbed by the performance. Violet glanced
  at him once or twice curiously. It began to occur to her that it was not so
  much the dance as the dancer in whom her husband was interested.</p>

  <p>"You have seen her before&mdash;this Mademoiselle Celaire?" she
  whispered.</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Peter, nodding, "I have seen her before."</p>

  <p>The dance proceeded. It was like many others of its sort, only a little
  more daring, a little more finished. Mademoiselle Celaire, in her
  tight-fitting, shabby black frock, with her wild mass of hair, her flashing
  eyes, her seductive gestures, was, without doubt, a marvelous person. Peter,
  Baron de Grost, watched her every movement with absorbed attention. When the
  curtain went down he forgot to clap. His eyes followed her off the stage.
  Violet shrugged her shoulders. She was looking very handsome herself in a
  black velvet dinner gown, and a hat so exceedingly Parisian that no one had
  had the heart to ask her to remove it.</p>

  <p>"My dear Peter," she remarked, reprovingly, "a moderate amount of
  admiration for that very agile young lady I might, perhaps, be inclined to
  tolerate; but, having watched you for the last quarter of an hour, I am bound
  to confess that I am becoming jealous."</p>

  <p>"Of Mademoiselle Celaire?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Of Mademoiselle Sophie Celaire."</p>

  <p>He leaned a little towards her. His lips were parted; he was about to make
  a statement or a confession. Just then a tall commissionaire leaned over from
  behind and touched him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"For Monsieur le Baron de Grost," he announced, handing Peter a note.</p>

  <p>Peter glanced towards his wife.</p>

  <p>"You permit me?" he murmured, breaking the seal.</p>

  <p>Violet shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly. Her husband was already
  absorbed in the few lines hastily scrawled across the sheet of notepaper
  which he held in his hand.</p><br>

  <p class="letter">"MONSIEUR BARON DE GROST.</p>

  <p class="letter">"Dear Monsieur le Baron,<br>
  Come to my dressing-room, without fail, as soon as you receive
  this.&mdash;<br>
  Sophie Celaire.</p><br>

  <p>Violet looked over his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"The hussy!" she exclaimed, indignantly. Her husband raised his eyebrows.
  With his forefinger he merely tapped the two numerals.</p>

  <p>"The Double-Four!" she gasped.</p>

  <p>He looked around and nodded. The commissionaire was waiting. Peter took up
  his silk hat from under the seat.</p>

  <p>"If I am detained, dear," he whispered, "you'll make the best of it, won't
  you? The car will be here and Frederick will be looking out for you."</p>

  <p>"Of course," she answered, cheerfully. "I shall be quite all right."</p>

  <p>She nodded brightly and Peter took his departure. He passed through a door
  on which was painted "Private," and through a maze of scenery and stage hands
  and ballet ladies by a devious route to the region of the dressing-rooms. His
  guide conducted him to the door of one of these and knocked.</p>

  <p>"Entrez, monsieur," a shrill feminine voice replied.</p>

  <p>Peter entered and closed the door behind him. The commissionaire remained
  outside. Mademoiselle Celaire turned to greet her visitor.</p>

  <p>"It is a few words I desire with you as quickly as possible, if you
  please, Monsieur le Baron," she said, advancing towards him. "Listen."</p>

  <p>She had brushed out her hair and it hung from her head straight and a
  little stiff, almost like the hair of an Indian woman. She had washed her
  face, too, free of all cosmetics and her pallor was almost waxen. She wore a
  dressing gown of green silk. Her discarded black frock lay upon the
  floor.</p>

  <p>"I am entirely at your service, mademoiselle," Peter answered, bowing.
  "Continue, if you please."</p>

  <p>"You sup with me to-night&mdash;you are my guest."</p>

  <p>He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"I am very much honored," he murmured. "It is an affair of urgency, then?
  Mademoiselle will remember that I am not alone here."</p>

  <p>She threw out her hands scornfully.</p>

  <p>"They told me in Paris that you were a genius!" she exclaimed. "Cannot you
  feel, then, when a thing is urgent? Do you not know it without being told?
  You must meet me with a carriage at the stage door in forty minutes. We sup
  in Hamilton Place with Andrea Korust and his brother."</p>

  <p>"With whom?" Peter asked, surprised.</p>

  <p>"With the Korust Brothers," she repeated. "I have just been talking to
  Andrea. He calls himself a Hungarian. Bah! They are as much Hungarian, those
  young men, as I am!"</p>

  <p>Peter leaned slightly against the table and looked thoughtfully at his
  companion. He was trying to remember whether he had ever heard anything of
  these young men.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," he said, "the prospect of partaking of any meal in your
  company is in itself enchanting, but I do not know your friends, the Korust
  Brothers. Apart from their wonderful music, I do not recollect ever having
  heard of them before in my life. What excuse have I, then, for accepting
  their hospitality? Pardon me, too, if I add that you have not as yet spoken
  as to the urgency of this affair."</p>

  <p>She turned from him impatiently and, throwing herself back into the chair
  from which she had risen at his entrance, she began to exchange the thick
  woolen stockings which she had been wearing upon the stage for others of fine
  silk.</p>

  <p>"Oh, la, la!" she exclaimed. "You are very slow, Monsieur le Baron. It is,
  perhaps, my stage name which has misled you. I am Marie Lapouse. Does that
  convey anything to you?"</p>

  <p>"A great deal," Peter admitted, quickly. "You stand very high upon the
  list of my agents whom I may trust."</p>

  <p>"Then stay here no longer," she begged, "for my maid waits outside and I
  need her services. Go back and make your excuses to your wife. In forty
  minutes I shall expect you at the stage door."</p>

  <p>"An affair of diplomacy, this, or brute force?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Heaven knows what may happen!" she replied. "To tell you the truth, I do
  not know myself. Be prepared for anything, but, for Heaven's sake, go now! I
  can dress no further without my maid, and Andrea Korust may come in at any
  moment. I do not wish him to find you here."</p>

  <p>Peter made his way thoughtfully back to his seat. He explained the
  situation to his wife so far as he could, and sent her home. Then he waited
  about until the car returned, smoking a cigarette and trying once more to
  remember if he had ever heard anything from Sogrange of Andrea Korust or his
  brother. Punctually at the time stated he was outside the stage door of the
  music-hall, and a few minutes later Mademoiselle Celaire appeared, a dazzling
  vision of fur and smiles and jewelry imperfectly concealed. A small crowd
  pressed around to see the famous Frenchwoman. Peter handed her gravely across
  the pavement into his waiting car. One or two of the loungers gave vent to a
  groan of envy at the sight of the diamonds which blazed from her neck and
  bosom. Peter smiled as he gave the address to his servant and took his place
  by the side of his companion.</p>

  <p>"They see only the externals, this mob," he remarked. "They picture to
  themselves, perhaps, a little supper for two. Alas!"</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Celaire laughed at him softly.</p>

  <p>"You need not trouble to assume that most disconsolate of expressions, my
  dear Baron," she assured him. "Your reputation as a man of gallantry is
  beyond question; but remember that I know you also for the most devoted and
  loyal of husbands. We waste no time in folly, you and I. It is the business
  of the Double-Four."</p>

  <p>Peter was relieved, but his innate politeness forbade his showing it.</p>

  <p>"Proceed," he said.</p>

  <p>"The Brothers Korust," she went on, leaning towards him, "have a week's
  engagement at the Alhambra. Their salary is six hundred pounds. They play
  very beautifully, of course, but I think that it is as much as they are
  worth."</p>

  <p>Peter agreed with her fervently. He had no soul for music.</p>

  <p>"They have taken the furnished house belonging to one of your dukes, in
  Hamilton Place, for which we are now bound; taken it, too, at a fabulous
  rent," Mademoiselle Celaire continued. "They, have installed there a chef and
  a whole retinue of servants. They are here for seven nights; they have issued
  invitations for seven supper parties."</p>

  <p>"Hospitable young men they seem to be," Peter murmured. "I read in one of
  the stage papers that Andrea is a Count in his own country, and that they
  perform in public only for the love of their music and for the sake of the
  excitement and travel."</p>

  <p>"A paragraph wholly inspired and utterly false," Mademoiselle Celaire
  declared, firmly, sitting a little forward in the car, and laying her hand,
  ablaze with jewels, upon his coat sleeve. "Listen. They call themselves
  Hungarians. Bah! I know that they are in touch with a great European court,
  both of them, the court of the country to which they belong. They have plans,
  plans and schemes connected with their visit here, which I do not understand.
  I have done my best with Andrea Korust, but he is not a man to be trusted. I
  know that there is something more in these seven supper parties than idle
  hospitality. I and others like me, artistes and musicians, are invited, to
  give the assembly a properly Bohemian tone; but there are to be other guests,
  attracted there, no doubt, because the papers have spoken of these
  gatherings."</p>

  <p>"You have some idea of what it all means, in your mind?" Peter
  suggested.</p>

  <p>"It is too vague to put into words," she declared, shaking her head. "We
  must both watch. Afterwards, we will, if you like, compare notes."</p>

  <p>The car drew up before the doors of a handsome house in Hamilton Place. A
  footman received Peter and relieved him of his hat and overcoat. A trim maid
  performed the same office for Mademoiselle Celaire. They met, a moment or two
  later, and were ushered into a large drawing-room in which a dozen or two of
  men and women were already assembled, and from which came a pleasant murmur
  of voices and laughter. The apartment was hung with pale green satin; the
  furniture was mostly Chippendale, upholstered in the same shade. A
  magnificent grand piano stood open in a smaller room, just visible beyond.
  Only one thing seemed strange to the two newly arrived guests. The room was
  entirely lit with shaded candles, giving a certain mysterious but not
  unpleasant air of obscurity to the whole suite of apartments. Through the
  gloom, the jewels and eyes of the women seemed to shine with a new
  brilliance. Slight eccentricities of toilette, for a part of the gathering
  was distinctly Bohemian, were softened and subdued. The whole effect was
  somewhat weird, but also picturesque.</p>

  <p>Andrea Korust advanced from a little group to meet his guests. Off the
  stage he seemed at first sight frailer and slighter than ever. His dress coat
  had been exchanged for a velvet dinner jacket, and his white tie for a
  drooping black bow. He had a habit of blinking nearly all the time, as though
  his large brown eyes, which he seldom wholly opened, were weaker than they
  appeared to be. Nevertheless, when he came to within a few paces of his newly
  arrived visitors, they shone with plenty of expression. Without any change of
  countenance, however, he held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Dear Andrea," Mademoiselle Celaire exclaimed, "you permit me that I
  present to you my dear friend, well known in Paris&mdash;alas! many years
  ago&mdash;Monsieur le Baron de Grost. Monsieur le Baron was kind enough to
  pay his respects to me this evening, and I have induced him to become my
  escort here."</p>

  <p>"It was my good fortune," Peter remarked, smiling, "that I saw
  Mademoiselle Celaire's name upon the bills this evening&mdash;my good
  fortune, since it has procured for me the honor of an acquaintance with a
  musician so distinguished."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, Monsieur le Baron," Korust replied.</p>

  <p>"You stay here, I regret to hear, a very short time?"</p>

  <p>"Alas!" Andrea Korust admitted, "it is so. For myself I would that it were
  longer. I find your London so attractive, the people so friendly. They fall
  in with my whims so charmingly. I have a hatred, you know, of solitude. I
  like to make acquaintances wherever I go, to have delightful women and
  interesting men around, to forget that life is not always gay. If I am too
  much alone, I am miserable, and when I am miserable I am in a very bad way
  indeed. I cannot then make music."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled gravely and sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"And your brother? Does he, too, share your gregarious instincts?"</p>

  <p>Korust paused for a moment before replying. His eyes were quite wide open
  now. If one could judge from his expression, one would certainly have said
  that the Baron de Grost's attempts to ingratiate himself with his host were
  distinctly unsuccessful.</p>

  <p>"My brother has exactly opposite instincts," he said slowly. "He finds no
  pleasure in society. At the sound of a woman's voice, he hides."</p>

  <p>"He is not here, then?" Peter asked, glancing around.</p>

  <p>Andrea Korust shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It is doubtful whether he joins us this evening at all," he declared. "My
  sister, however, is wholly of my disposition. Monsieur le Baron will permit
  that I present him."</p>

  <p>Peter bowed low before a very handsome young woman with flashing black
  eyes, and a type of features undoubtedly belonging to one of the countries of
  eastern Europe. She was picturesquely dressed in a gown of flaming red silk,
  made as though in one piece, without trimming or flounces, and she seemed
  inclined to bestow upon her new acquaintance all the attention that he might
  desire. She took him at once into a corner and seated herself by his side. It
  was impossible for Peter not to associate the empressement of her manner with
  the few words which Andrea Korust had whispered into her ear at the moment of
  their introduction.</p>

  <p>"So you," she murmured, "are the wonderful Baron de Grost. I have heard of
  you so often."</p>

  <p>"Wonderful!" Peter repeated, with twinkling eyes. "I have never been
  called that before. I feel that I have no claims whatever to distinction,
  especially in a gathering like this."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders and glanced carelessly across the room.</p>

  <p>"They are well enough," she admitted, "but one wearies of genius on every
  side of one. Genius is not the best thing in the world to live with, you
  know. It has whims and fancies. For instance, look at these rooms&mdash;the
  gloom, the obscurity&mdash;and I love so much the light."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is the privilege of genius," he remarked, "to have whims and to
  indulge in them."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"To do Andrea justice," she said, "it is, perhaps, scarcely a whim that he
  chooses to receive his guests in semi-darkness. He has weak eyes and he is
  much too vain to wear spectacles. Tell me, you know every one here?"</p>

  <p>"No one," Peter declared. "Please enlighten me, if you think it necessary.
  For myself," he added, dropping his voice a little, "I feel that the
  happiness of my evening is assured, without making any further
  acquaintances."</p>

  <p>"But you came as the guest of Mademoiselle Celaire," she reminded him,
  doubtfully, with a faint regretful sigh and a provocative gleam in her
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"I saw Mademoiselle Celaire to-night for the first time for years," Peter
  replied. "I called to see her in her dressing-room and she claimed me for an
  escort this evening. I am, alas! a very occasional wanderer in the pleasant
  paths of Bohemia."</p>

  <p>"If that is really true," she murmured, "I suppose I must tell you
  something about the people, or you will feel that you have wasted your
  opportunity."</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle," Peter whispered.</p>

  <p>She held out her hand and laughed into his face.</p>

  <p>"No!" she interrupted. "I shall do my duty. Opposite you is Mademoiselle
  Trezani, the famous singer at Covent Garden. Do I need to tell you that, I
  wonder? Rudolf Maesterling, the dramatist, stands behind her there in the
  corner. He is talking to the wonderful Cleo, whom all the world knows.
  Monsieur Guyer there, he is manager, I believe, of the Alhambra; and talking
  to him is Marborg, the great pianist. One of the ladies talking to my brother
  is Esther Braithwaite, whom, of course, you know by sight; she is leading
  lady, is she not, at the Hilarity? The other is Miss Ransome; they tell me
  that she is your only really great English actress."</p>

  <p>Peter nodded appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"It is all most interesting," he declared. "Now tell me, please, who is
  the military person with the stiff figure and sallow complexion, standing by
  the door? He seems quite alone."</p>

  <p>The girl made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I ought to be looking after him," she admitted, rising
  reluctantly to her feet. "He is a soldier just back from India&mdash;a
  General Noseworthy, with all sorts of letters after his name. If Mademoiselle
  Celaire is generous, perhaps we may have a few minutes' conversation later
  on," she added, with a parting smile.</p>

  <p>"Say, rather, if Mademoiselle Korust is kind," De Grost replied, bowing.
  "It depends upon that only."</p>

  <p>He strolled across the room and rejoined Mademoiselle Celaire a few
  moments later. They stood apart in a corner.</p>

  <p>"I should like my supper," Peter declared.</p>

  <p>"They wait for one more guest," Mademoiselle Celaire announced.</p>

  <p>"One more guest! Do you know who it is?"</p>

  <p>"No idea," she answered. "One would imagine that it was some one of
  importance. Are you any wiser than when you came, dear master?" she added,
  under her breath.</p>

  <p>"Not a whit," he replied, promptly.</p>

  <p>She took out her fan and waved it slowly in front of her face.</p>

  <p>"Yet you must discover what it all means to-night or not at all," she
  whispered. "The dear Andrea has intimated to me most delicately that another
  escort would be more acceptable if I should honor him again."</p>

  <p>"That helps," he murmured. "See, our last guest arrives."</p>

  <p>A tall,&mdash;spare-looking man was just being announced. They heard his
  name as Andrea presented him to a companion&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Colonel Mayson!"</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Celaire saw a gleam in her companion's eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is coming&mdash;the idea?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"Very vaguely," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Who is this Colonel Mayson?"</p>

  <p>"Our only military aeronaut," Peter replied.</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Aeronaut!" she repeated, doubtfully. "I see nothing in that. Both my own
  country and Germany are years ahead of poor England in the air. Is it not
  so?"</p>

  <p>Peter smiled and held out his arm.</p>

  <p>"See," he said, "supper has been announced. Afterwards, Andrea Korust will
  play to us, and I think that Colonel Mayson and his distinguished brother
  officer from India will talk. We shall see."</p>

  <p>They passed into a room whose existence had suddenly been revealed by the
  drawing back of some beautiful brocaded curtains. Supper was a delightful
  meal, charmingly served. Peter, putting everything else out of his head for
  the moment, thoroughly enjoyed himself, and, remembering his duty as a guest,
  contributed in no small degree towards the success of the entertainment. He
  sat between Mademoiselle Celaire and his hostess, both of whom demanded much
  from him in the way of attention. But he still found time to tell stories
  which were listened to by every one, and exchanged sallies with the gayest.
  Only Andrea Korust, from his place at the head of the table, glanced
  occasionally towards his popular guest with a curious, half-hidden expression
  of distaste and suspicion.</p>

  <p>The more the Baron de Grost shone, the more uneasy he became. The signal
  to rise from the meal was given almost abruptly. Mademoiselle Korust hung on
  to Peter's arm. Her own wishes and her brother's orders seemed absolutely to
  coincide. She led him towards a retiring corner of the music room. On the
  way, however, Peter overheard the introduction which he had expected.</p>

  <p>"General Noseworthy is just returned from India, Colonel Mayson," Korust
  said, in his usual quiet, tired tone. "You will, perhaps, find it interesting
  to talk together a little. As for me, I play because all are polite enough to
  wish it, but conversation disturbs me not in the least."</p>

  <p>Peter passed, smiling, on to the corner pointed out by his companion,
  which was the darkest and most secluded in the room. He took her fan and
  gloves, lit her cigarette, and leaned back by her side.</p>

  <p>"How does your brother, a stranger to London, find time to make the
  acquaintance of so many interesting people?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He brought many letters," she replied. "He has friends everywhere."</p>

  <p>"I have an idea," Peter remarked, "that an acquaintance of my own, the
  Count von Hern, spoke to me once about him."</p>

  <p>She took her cigarette from her lips and turned her head slightly. Peter's
  expression was one of amiable reminiscence. His cheeks were a trifle flushed,
  his appearance was entirely reassuring. She laughed at her brother's caution.
  She found her companion delightful.</p>

  <p>"Yes, the Count von Hern is a friend of my brother's," she admitted,
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>"And of yours?" he whispered, his arm slightly pressed against hers.</p>

  <p>She laughed at him silently and their eyes met. Decidedly Peter, Baron de
  Grost, found it hard to break away from his old weakness! Andrea Korust, from
  his place near the piano, breathed a sigh of relief as he watched. A moment
  or two later, however, Mademoiselle Korust was obliged to leave her companion
  to receive a late but unimportant guest, and almost simultaneously Colonel
  Mayson passed by on his way to the farther end of the apartment. Andrea
  Korust was bending over the piano to give some instructions to his
  accompanist. Peter leaned forward and his face and tone were strangely
  altered.</p>

  <p>"You will find General Noseworthy of the Indian Army a little inquisitive,
  Colonel," he remarked.</p>

  <p>The latter turned sharply round. There was meaning in those few words,
  without doubt! There was meaning, too, in the still, cold face which seemed
  to repel his question. He passed on thoughtfully. Mademoiselle Korust, with a
  gesture of relief, came back and threw herself once more upon the couch.</p>

  <p>"We must talk in whispers," she said, gayly. "Andrea always declares that
  he does not mind conversation, but too much noise is, of course, impossible.
  Besides, Mademoiselle Celaire will not spare you to me for long."</p>

  <p>"There is a whole language," he replied, "which was made for whispers. And
  as for Mademoiselle Celaire&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>He laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Celaire is, I think, more your brother's friend than mine,"
  he murmured. "At least, I will be generous. He has given me a delightful
  evening. I resign my claims upon Mademoiselle Celaire."</p>

  <p>"It would break your heart," she declared.</p>

  <p>His voice sank even below a whisper. Decidedly, Peter, Baron de Grost, did
  not improve!</p>

  <p>He rose to leave precisely at the right time, neither too early nor too
  late. He had spent altogether a most amusing evening. There were one or two
  little comedies which had diverted him extremely. At the moment of parting,
  the beautiful eyes of Mademoiselle Korust had been raised to his very
  earnestly.</p>

  <p>"You will come again very soon&mdash;to-morrow night?" she had whispered.
  "Is it necessary that you bring Mademoiselle Celaire?"</p>

  <p>"It is altogether unnecessary," Peter replied.</p>

  <p>"Let me try and entertain you instead, then!"</p>

  <p>It was precisely at that instant that Andrea had sent for his sister.
  Peter watched their brief conversation with much interest and intense
  amusement. She was being told not to invite him there again and she was
  rebelling! Without a doubt, he had made a conquest! She returned to him
  flushed and with a dangerous glitter in her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur le Baron," she said, leading him on one side, "I am ashamed and
  angry."</p>

  <p>"Your brother is annoyed because you have asked me here to-morrow night?"
  he asked, quickly.</p>

  <p>"It is so," she confessed. "Indeed, I thank you that you have spared me
  the task of putting my brother's discourtesy into words. Andrea takes violent
  fancies like that sometimes. I am ashamed, but what can I do?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing, mademoiselle," he admitted, with a sigh. "I obey, of course. Did
  your brother mention the source of his aversion to me?"</p>

  <p>"He is too absurd sometimes," she declared. "One must treat him like a
  great baby."</p>

  <p>"Nevertheless, there must be a reason," Peter persisted, gently.</p>

  <p>"He has heard some foolish thing from Count von Hern," she admitted,
  reluctantly. "Do not let us think anything more about it. In a few days it
  will have passed. And meanwhile&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She paused. He leaned a little towards her. She was looking intently at a
  ring upon her finger.</p>

  <p>"If you would really like to see me," she whispered, "and if you are sure
  that Mademoiselle Celaire would not object, could you not ask me to tea
  to-morrow&mdash;or the next day?"</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," Peter insisted, with a becoming show of eagerness. "Shall we
  say at the Canton at five?"</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Isn't that rather a public place?" she objected.</p>

  <p>"Anywhere else you like."</p>

  <p>She was silent for a moment. She seemed to be waiting for some suggestion
  from him. None came, however.</p>

  <p>"The Carlton at five," she murmured. "I am angry with Andrea. I feel,
  even, that I could break his wonderful violin in two!"</p>

  <p>Peter sighed once more.</p>

  <p>"I should like to twist von Hern's neck," he declared. "Lucky for him that
  he's in St. Petersburg! Let us forget this unpleasant matter, mademoiselle.
  The evening has been too delightful for such memories."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Celaire turned to her escort eagerly as soon as they were
  alone together in the car.</p>

  <p>"As an escort, let me tell you, my dear Baron," she exclaimed, with some
  pique, "that you are a miserable failure! For the rest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"For the rest, I will admit that I am puzzled," Peter said. "I need to
  think. I have the glimmerings of an idea&mdash;no more."</p>

  <p>"You will act? It is an affair for us&mdash;for the Double-Four?"</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt&mdash;an affair and a serious one," Peter assured her. "I
  shall act; exactly how I cannot say until after to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow?" she repeated, inquiringly.</p>

  <p>"Mademoiselle Korust takes tea with me," he explained.</p>

  <p>In a quiet sort of way, the series of supper parties given by Andrea
  Korust became the talk of London. The most famous dancer in the world broke
  through her unvarying rule and night after night thrilled the distinguished
  little gathering. An opera singer, the "star" of the season, sang, a great
  genius recited, and Andrea himself gave always of his best. Apart from this
  wonderful outpouring of talent, Andrea Korust himself seemed to possess the
  peculiar art of bringing into touch with one another people naturally
  interested in the same subjects. On the night after the visit of Peter, Baron
  de Grost, His Grace the Duke of Rosshire was present, the man in whose hands
  lay the destinies of the British Navy; and, curiously enough, on the same
  night, a great French writer on naval subjects was present, whom the Duke had
  never met, and with whom he was delighted to talk for some time apart. On
  another occasion, the Military Secretary to the French Embassy was able to
  have a long and instructive chat with a distinguished English general on the
  subject of the recent maneuvers, and the latter received, in the strictest
  confidence, some very interesting information concerning the new type of
  French guns. On the following evening, the greatest of our Colonial
  statesmen, a red-hot Imperialist, was able to chat about the resources of the
  Empire with an English politician of similar views whom he chanced never to
  have previously met. Altogether, these parties seemed to be the means of
  bringing together a series of most interesting people, interesting not only
  in themselves, but in their relations to one another. It was noticeable,
  however, that from this side of his little gatherings Andrea Korust remained
  wholly apart. He frankly admitted that music and cheerful companionship were
  the only two things in life he cared for. Politics or matters of world import
  seemed to leave him unmoved. If a serious subject of conversation were
  started at supper time, he was frankly bored, and took no particular pains to
  hide the fact. It is certain that whatever interesting topics were alluded to
  in his presence, he remained entirely outside any understanding of them.
  Mademoiselle Celaire, who was present most evenings, although with other
  escorts, was entirely puzzled. She could see nothing whatever to account for
  the warning which she had received, and which she had passed on, as was her
  duty, to the Baron de Grost. She failed, also, to understand the faint but
  perceptible enlightenment to which Peter himself had admittedly attained
  after that first evening. Take that important conversation, for instance,
  between the French military attach, and the English general. Without a doubt
  it was of interest, and especially so to the country which she was sure
  claimed his allegiance, but it was equally without doubt that Andrea Korust
  neither overheard a word of that conversation nor betrayed the slightest
  curiosity concerning it. Mademoiselle Celaire was a clever woman and she had
  never felt so hopelessly at fault....</p>

  <p>The seventh and last of these famous supper parties was in full swing.
  Notwithstanding the shaded candles, which left the faces of the guests a
  little indistinct, the scene was a brilliant one. Mademoiselle Celaire was
  wearing her famous diamonds, which shone through the gloom like pin-pricks of
  fire. Garda Desmaines, the wonderful Garda, sat next to her host, her bosom
  and hair on fire with jewels, yet with the most wonderful light of all
  glowing in her eyes. A famous actor, who had thrown his proverbial reticence
  to the winds, kept his immediate neighbors in a state of semi-hysterical
  mirth. The clink of wine glasses, the laughter of beautiful women, the murmur
  of cultivated voices, rising and swelling through the faint, mysterious
  gloom, made a picturesque, a wonderful scene. Pale as a marble statue, with
  the covert smile of the gracious host, Andrea Korust sat at the head of his
  table, well pleased with his company, as indeed he had the right to be. By
  his side was a great American statesman, who was traveling around the world
  and yet had refused all other invitations of this sort. He had come for the
  pleasure of meeting the famous Dutch writer and politician, Mr. Van Jool. The
  two were already talking intimately. It was at this point that tragedy, or
  something like it, intervened. A impatient voice was heard in the hall
  outside, a voice which grew louder and louder, more impatient, finally more
  passionate. People raised their heads to listen. The American statesman, who
  was, perhaps, the only one to realize exactly what was coming, slipped his
  hand into his pocket and gripped something cold and hard. Then the door was
  flung open. An apologetic and much disturbed butler made the announcement
  which had evidently been demanded of him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Von Tassen!"</p>

  <p>A silence followed&mdash;breathless&mdash;the silence before the bursting
  of the storm. Mr. Von Tassen was the name of the American statesman, and the
  man who rose slowly from his place by his host's side was the exact double of
  the man who stood now upon the threshold, gazing in upon the room. The
  expression of the two alone was different. The newcomer was furiously angry,
  and looked it. The sham Mr. Von Tassen was very much at his ease. It was he
  who broke the silence, and his voice was curiously free from all trace of
  emotion. He was looking his double over with an air of professional
  interest.</p>

  </div>

  <p>"On the whole," he said calmly, "very good. A little stouter, I perceive,
  and the eyebrows a trifle too regular. Of course, when you make faces at me
  like that, it is hard to judge of the expression. I can only say that I did
  the best I could."</p>

  <p>"Who the devil are you, masquerading in my name?" the newcomer demanded,
  with emphasis. "This man is an impostor!" he added, turning to Andrea Korust.
  "What is he doing at your table?"</p>

  <p>Andrea leaned forward and his face was an evil thing to look upon.</p>

  <p>"Who are you?" he hissed out.</p>

  <p>The sham Mr. Von Tassen turned away for a moment and stooped down. The
  trick has been done often enough upon the stage, often in less time, but
  seldom with more effect. The wonderful wig disappeared, the spectacles, the
  lines in the face, the make-up of diabolical cleverness. With his back to the
  wall and his fingers playing with something in his pocket, Peter, Baron de
  Grost, smiled upon his host.</p>

  <p>"Since you insist upon knowing&mdash;the Baron de Grost, at your service!"
  he announced.</p>

  <p>Andrea Korust was, for the moment, speechless. One of the women shrieked.
  The real Mr. Von Tassen looked around him helplessly.</p>

  <p>"Will some one be good enough to enlighten me as to the meaning of this?"
  he begged. "Is it a roast? If so, I only want to catch on. Let me get to the
  joke, if there is one. If not, I should like a few words of explanation from
  you, sir," he added, addressing Peter.</p>

  <p>"Presently," the latter replied. "In the meantime, let me persuade you
  that I am not the only impostor here."</p>

  <p>He seized a glass of water and dashed it in the face of Mr. Van Jool.
  There was a moment's scuffle, and no more of Mr. Van Jool. What emerged was a
  good deal like the shy Maurice Korust, who accompanied his brother at the
  music hall, but whose distaste for these gatherings had been Andrea's
  continual lament. The Baron de Grost stepped back once more against the wall.
  His host was certainly looking dangerous. Mademoiselle Celaire was leaning
  forward, staring through the gloom with distended eyes. Around the table
  every head was turned towards the centre of the disturbance. It was Peter
  again who spoke.</p>

  <p>"Let me suggest, Andrea Korust," he said, "that you send your
  guests&mdash;those who are not immediately interested in this
  affair&mdash;into the next room. I will offer Mr. Von Tassen then the
  explanation to which he is entitled."</p>

  <p>Andrea Korust staggered to his feet. The nerve had failed. He was shaking
  all over. He pointed to the music room.</p>

  <p>"If you would be so good, ladies and gentlemen?" he begged. "We will
  follow you immediately."</p>

  <p>They went with obvious reluctance. All their eyes seemed focussed upon
  Peter. He bore their scrutiny with calm cheerfulness. For a moment he had
  feared Korust, but that moment had passed. A servant, obeying his master's
  gesture, pulled back the curtains after the departing crowd. The four men
  were alone.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Von Tassen," Peter said, easily, "you are a man who loves adventures.
  To-night you experience a new sort of one. Over in your great country, such
  methods are laughed at as the cheap device of sensation mongers.
  Nevertheless, they exist. To-night is a proof that they exist."</p>

  <p>"Get on to facts, sir," the American admonished. "You've got to explain to
  me what you mean by passing yourself off as Thomas Von Tassen, before you
  leave this room."</p>

  <p>Peter bowed.</p>

  <p>"With much pleasure, Mr. Von Tassen," he declared. "For your information,
  I might tell you that you are not the only person in whose guise I have
  figured. In fact, I have had quite a busy week. I have been&mdash;let me
  see&mdash;I have been Monsieur le Marquis de Beau Kunel on the night when our
  shy friend, Maurice Korust, was playing the part of General Henderson. I have
  also been His Grace the Duke of Rosshire when my friend Maurice here was
  introduced to me as Francois Defayal, known by name to me as one of the
  greatest writers on naval matters. A little awkward about the figure I found
  His Grace, but otherwise I think that I should have passed muster wherever he
  was known. I have also passed as Sir William Laureston, on the evening when
  my rival artist here sang the praises of Imperial England."</p>

  <p>Andrea Korust leaned forward with venomous eyes.</p>

  <p>"You mean that it was you who was here last night in Sir William
  Laureston's place?" he almost shrieked.</p>

  <p>"Most certainly," Peter admitted, "but you must remember that, after all,
  my performances have been no more difficult than those of your shy but
  accomplished brother. Whenever I took to myself a strange personality I found
  him there, equally good as to detail, and with his subject always at his
  finger tips. We settled that little matter of the canal, didn't we?" Peter
  remarked, cheerfully, laying his hand upon the shoulder of the young man.</p>

  <p>They stared at him, those two white-faced brothers, like tiger-cats about
  to spring. Mr. Von Tassen was getting impatient.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he protested, "you may be clearing matters up so far as
  regards Mr. Andrea Korust and his brother, but I'm as much in the fog as
  ever. Where do I come in?"</p>

  <p>"Your pardon, sir," Peter replied. "I am getting nearer things now. These
  two young men&mdash;we will not call them hard names&mdash;are suffering from
  an excess of patriotic zeal. They didn't come and sit down on a camp stool
  and sketch obsolete forts, as those others of their countrymen do when they
  want to pose as the bland and really exceedingly ignorant foreigner. They
  went about the matter with some skill. It occurred to them that it might be
  interesting to their country to know what Sir William Laureston thought about
  the strength of the Imperial Navy, and to what extent his country was willing
  to go in maintaining their allegiance to Great Britain. Then there was the
  Duke of Rosshire. They thought they'd like to know his views as to the
  development of the Navy during the next ten years. There was that little
  matter, too, of the French guns. It would certainly be interesting to them to
  know what Monsieur le Marquis de Beau Kunel had to say about them. These
  people were all invited to sit at the hospitable board of our host here. I,
  however, had an inkling on the first night of what was going on, and I was
  easily able to persuade those in authority to let me play their several
  parts. You, sir," Peter added, turning to Mr. Von Tassen, "you, sir, floored
  me. You were not an Englishman, and there was no appeal which I could make. I
  simply had to risk you. I counted upon your not turning up. Unfortunately,
  you did. Fortunately, you are the last guest. This is the seventh
  supper."</p>

  <p>Mr. Von Tassen glanced around at the three men and made up his mind.</p>

  <p>"What do you call yourself?" he asked Peter.</p>

  <p>"The Baron de Grost," Peter replied.</p>

  <p>"Then, my friend the Baron de Grost," Von Tassen said, "I think that you
  and I had better get out of this. So I was to talk about Germany with Mr. Van
  Jool, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I have already explained your views," Peter declared, with twinkling
  eyes. "Mr. Van Jool was delighted."</p>

  <p>Mr. Von Tassen shook with laughter.</p>

  <p>"Say," he exclaimed, "this is a great story! If you're ready, Baron de
  Grost, lead the way to where we can get a whiskey and soda and a chat."</p>

  <p>Mademoiselle Celaire came gliding out to them.</p>

  <p>"I am not going to be left here," she whispered, taking Peter's arm.</p>

  <p>Peter looked back from the door.</p>

  <p>"At any rate, Mr. Andrea Korust," he said, "your first supper was a
  success. Colonel Mayson was genuine. Our real English military aeronaut was
  here, and he has disclosed to you, Maurice Korust, all that he ever knew.
  Henceforth, I presume your great country will dispute with us for the mastery
  of the air.</p>

  <p>"Queer country, this!" Mr. Von Tassen remarked, pausing on the step to
  light a cigar. "Seems kind of humdrum after New York, but there's no use
  talking. Things do happen over here, anyway!"</p>

  <h2>VII. MAJOR KOSUTH'S MISSION</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Jun 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">His host, very fussy as he always was on the morning of his
  big shoot, came bustling towards Peter, Baron de Grost, with a piece of paper
  in his hand. The party of men had just descended from a large brake and were
  standing about on the edge of the common, examining cartridges, smoking a
  last cigarette before the business of the morning, and chatting together over
  the prospects of the day's sport. In the distance, a cloud of dust indicated
  the approach of a fast traveling motor-car.</p>

  <p>"My dear Baron," Sir William Bounderby said, "I want you to change your
  stand to-day. I must have a good man at the far corner as the birds go off my
  hand from there, and Addington was missing them shockingly yesterday.
  Besides, there is a new man coming on your left and I know nothing of his
  shooting&mdash;nothing at all!"</p>

  <p>Peter smiled.</p>

  <p>"Anywhere you choose to put me, Sir William," he assented. "They came
  badly for Addington yesterday, and well for me. However, I'll do my
  best."</p>

  <p>"I wish people wouldn't bring strangers, especially to the one shoot where
  I'm keen about the bag. I told Portal he could bring his brother-in-law, and
  he's bringing this foreign fellow instead. Don't suppose he can shoot for
  nuts! Did you ever hear of him, I wonder? The Count von Hern, he calls
  himself."</p>

  <p>The motor-car had come to a standstill by this time. From it descended Mr.
  Portal himself, a large neighboring land owner, a man of culture and travel.
  With him was Bernadine, in a very correct shooting suit and Tyrolese hat. On
  the other side of Mr. Portal was a short, thick set man, with olive
  complexion, keen black eyes, black mustache and imperial, who was dressed in
  city clothes. Sir William's eyebrows were slightly raised as he advanced to
  greet the party. Peter was at once profoundly interested.</p>

  <p>Mr. Portal introduced his guests.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive me, I am sure, for bringing a spectator, Bounderby," he
  said. "Major Kosuth, whom I have the honor to present&mdash;Major Kosuth, Sir
  William Bounderby&mdash;is high up in the diplomatic service of a country
  with whom we must feel every sympathy&mdash;the young Turks. The Count von
  Hern, who takes my brother-in-law's place, is probably known to you by
  name."</p>

  <p>Sir William welcomed his visitors cordially.</p>

  <p>"You do not shoot, Major Kosuth?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Very seldom," the Turk answered. "I come to-day with my good friend,
  Count von Hern, as a spectator, if you permit."</p>

  <p>"Delighted," Sir William replied. "We will find you a safe place near your
  friend."</p>

  <p>The little party began to move toward the wood. It was just at this moment
  that Bernadine felt a touch upon his shoulder, and, turning around, found
  Peter by his side.</p>

  <p>"An unexpected pleasure, my dear Count," the latter declared, suavely. "I
  had no idea that you took interest in such simple sports."</p>

  <p>The manners of Count von Hern were universally quoted as being almost too
  perfect. It is a regrettable fact, however, that at that moment he
  swore&mdash;softly, perhaps, but with distinct vehemence. A moment later he
  was exchanging the most cordial of greetings with his old friend.</p>

  <p>"You have the knack, my dear De Grost," he remarked, "of turning up in the
  most surprising places. I certainly did not know that among your many
  accomplishments was included a love for field sports."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled quietly. He was a very fine shot, and knew it.</p>

  <p>"One must amuse oneself these days," he said. "There is little else to
  do."</p>

  <p>Bernadine bit his lip.</p>

  <p>"My absence from this country, I fear, has robbed you of an
  occupation."</p>

  <p>"It has certainly deprived life of some of its savor," Peter admitted,
  blandly. "By the bye, will you not present me to your friend? I have the
  utmost sympathy with the intrepid political party of which he is a
  member."</p>

  <p>Von Hern performed the introduction with a reluctance which he wholly
  failed to conceal. The Turk, however, had been walking on his other side, and
  his hat was already lifted. Peter had purposely raised his voice.</p>

  <p>"It gives me the greatest pleasure, Major Kosuth," Peter said, "to welcome
  you to this country. In common, I believe, with the majority of my country
  people, I have the utmost respect and admiration for the movement which you
  represent."</p>

  <p>Major Kosuth smiled slowly. His features were heavy and unexpressive.
  There was something of gloom, however, in the manner of his response.</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, Baron," he replied, "and I welcome very much this
  expression of your interest in my party. I believe that the hearts of your
  country people are turned towards us in the same manner. I could wish that
  your country's political sympathies were as easily aroused."</p>

  <p>Bernadine intervened promptly.</p>

  <p>"Major Kosuth has been here only one day," he remarked, lightly. "I tell
  him that he is a little too impatient. See, we are approaching the wood. It
  is as well here to refrain from conversation."</p>

  <p>"We will resume it later," Peter said, softly. "I have interests in
  Turkey, and it would give me great pleasure to have a talk with Major
  Kosuth."</p>

  <p>"Financial interests?" the latter inquired, with some eagerness.</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>"I will explain after the first drive," he said, turning away.</p>

  <p>Peter walked rather quickly until he reached a bend in the wood, and
  overtaking his host, paused for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Lend me a loader for half an hour, Sir William," he begged. "I have to
  send my servant to the village with a telegram."</p>

  <p>"With pleasure!" Sir William answered. "There are several to spare. I'll
  send one to your stand. There's Von Hern going the wrong way!" he exclaimed,
  in a tone of annoyance.</p>

  <p>Peter was just in time to stop the whistle from going to his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Do me another favor, Sir William," he pleaded. "Give me time to send off
  my telegram before the Count sees what I'm doing. He's such an inquisitive
  person," he went on, noticing his host's look of blank surprise. "Thank you
  ever so much."</p>

  <p>Peter hurried on to his place. It was round the corner of the wood and for
  the moment out of sight of the rest of the party. He tore a sheet from his
  pocket-book and scribbled out a telegram. His man had disappeared and a
  substitute taken his place by the time von Hern arrived. The latter was now
  all amiability. It was hard to believe, from his smiling salutation, that he
  and the man to whom he waved his hand in so airy a fashion had ever declared
  war to the death!</p>

  <p>The shooting began a few minutes later. Major Kosuth, from a campstool a
  few yards behind his friend, watched with somewhat languid interest. He gave
  one, indeed, the impression that his thoughts were far removed from this
  simple country party, the main object of whose existence for the present
  seemed to be the slaying of a certain number of inoffensive birds. He watched
  the indifferent performance of his friend and the remarkably fine shooting of
  his neighbor on the left, with the same lack-luster eye and want of
  enthusiasm. The beat was scarcely over before Peter, resigning his smoking
  guns, lit a cigarette and strolled across to the next stand. He plunged at
  once into a conversation with Kosuth, notwithstanding Bernadine's
  ill-concealed annoyance.</p>

  <p>"Major Kosuth," he began, "I sympathize with you. It is a hard task for a
  man whose mind is centered upon great events, to sit still and watch a
  performance of this sort. Be kind to us all and remember that this represents
  to us merely a few hours of relaxation. We, too, have our more serious
  moments."</p>

  <p>"You read my thoughts well," Major Kosuth declared. "I do not seek to
  excuse them. For half a life-time we Turks have toiled and striven, always in
  danger of our lives, to help forward those things which have now come to
  pass. I think that our lives have become tinged with somberness and
  apprehension. Now that the first step is achieved, we go forward, still with
  trepidation. We need friends, Baron de Grost."</p>

  <p>"You cannot seriously doubt but that you will find them in this country,"
  Peter remarked. "There has never been a time when the English nation has not
  sympathized with the cause of liberty."</p>

  <p>"It is not the hearts of your people," Major Kosuth said, "which I fear.
  It is the antics of your politicians. Sympathy is a great thing, and good to
  have, but Turkey to-day needs more. The heart of a nation is big, but the
  number of those in whose hands it remains to give practical expression to its
  promptings, is few."</p>

  <p>Bernadine, who had stood as much as he could, seized forcibly upon his
  friend.</p>

  <p>"You must remember our bargain, Kosuth," he insisted, "no politics to-day.
  Until to-morrow evening we rest. Now I want to introduce you to a very old
  friend of mine&mdash;the Lord-Lieutenant of the county."</p>

  <p>No man was better informed in current political affairs, but Peter,
  instead of joining the cheerful afternoon tea party at the close of the day,
  raked out a file of the Times from the library, and studied it carefully in
  his room. There were one or two items of news concerning which he made pencil
  notes. He had scarcely finished his task before a servant brought in a
  dispatch. He opened it with interest and drew pencil and paper towards him.
  It was from Paris, and in the code which he had learned by heart, no written
  key of which existed. Carefully he transposed it on to paper and read it
  through. It was dated from Paris a few hours back.</p>

  <p>Kosuth left for England yesterday. Envoy from new Turkish Government.
  Requiring loan one million pounds. Asked for guarantee that it was not for
  warlike movement against Bulgaria, declined to give same. Communicated with
  English Ambassador and informed Kosuth yesterday that neither government
  would sanction loan unless undertaking were given that the same was not to be
  applied for war against Bulgaria. Turkey is under covenant to enter into no
  financial obligations with any other Power while the interest of former loans
  remains in abeyance. Kosuth has made two efforts to obtain loan privately,
  from prominent English financier and French Syndicate. Both have declined to
  treat on representations from government. Kosuth was expected return direct
  to Turkey. If, as you say, he is in England with Bernadine, we commend the
  affair to your utmost vigilance. Germany exceedingly anxious enter into close
  relations with new government of Turkey. Fear Kosuth's association with
  Bernadine proof of bad faith. Have had interview with Minister for foreign
  affairs, who relies upon our help. French Secret Service at your disposal, if
  necessary.</p>

  <p>Peter read the message three times with the greatest care. He was on the
  point of destroying it when Violet came into the room. She was wearing a long
  tea jacket of sheeny silk. Her beautiful hair was most becomingly arranged,
  her figure as light and girlish as ever. She came into the room humming gayly
  and swinging a gold purse upon her finger.</p>

  <p>"Won three rubbers out of four, Peter," she declared, "and a compliment
  from the Duchess. Am I a pupil to be proud of?"</p>

  <p>She stopped short. Her lips formed themselves into the shape of a whistle.
  She knew very well the signs. Her husband's eyes were kindling, there was a
  firm set about his lips, the palm of his hand lay flat upon that sheet of
  paper.</p>

  <p>"It was true?" she murmured. "It was Bernadine who was shooting
  to-day?"</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>"He was on the next stand," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Then there is something doing, of course," Violet continued. "My dear
  Peter, you may be an enigma to other people. To me you have the most
  expressive countenance I ever saw. You have had a cable which you have just
  transcribed. If I had been a few minutes later, I think you would have torn
  up the result. As it is, I think I have come just in time to hear all about
  it."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled, grimly but fondly. He uncovered the sheet of paper and
  placed it in her hands.</p>

  <p>"So far," he said, "there isn't much to tell you. Von Hern turned up this
  morning with a Major Kosuth, who was one of the leaders of the revolution in
  Turkey. I wired Paris and this is the reply."</p>

  <p>She read the message through thoughtfully and handed it back. Peter lit a
  match, and standing over the fireplace calmly destroyed it.</p>

  <p>"A million pounds is not a great sum of money," Violet remarked. "Why
  could not Kosuth borrow it for his country from a private individual?"</p>

  <p>"A million pounds is not a large sum to talk about," Peter replied, "but
  it is an exceedingly large sum for any one, even a multi-millionaire, to
  handle in cash. And Turkey, I gather, wants it at once. Besides,
  considerations which might be a security from a government, are no security
  at all as applied to a private individual."</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that Kosuth means to go behind the existing treaty and
  borrow from Germany?"</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I can't quite believe that," he said. "It would mean the straining of
  diplomatic relations with both countries. It is out of the question."</p>

  <p>"Then where does Bernadine come in?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," Peter answered.</p>

  <p>Violet laughed.</p>

  <p>"What is it that you are going to try and find out?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am trying to discover who it is that Bernadine and Kosuth are waiting
  to see," Peter replied. "The worst of it is, I daren't leave here. I shall
  have to trust to the others."</p>

  <p>She glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Well, go and dress," she said. "I'm afraid I've a little of your blood in
  me, after all. Life seems more stirring when Bernadine is on the scene."</p>

  <p>The shooting party broke up two days later and Peter and his wife returned
  at once to town. The former found the reports which were awaiting his arrival
  disappointing. Bernadine and his guest were not in London, or if they were
  they had carefully avoided all the usual haunts. Peter read his reports over
  again, smoked a very long cigar alone in his study, and finally drove down to
  the city and called upon his stockbroker, who was also a personal friend.
  Things were flat in the city, and the latter was glad enough to welcome an
  important client. He began talking the usual market shop until his visitor
  stopped him.</p>

  <p>"I have come to you, Edwardes, more for information than anything," Peter
  declared, "although it may mean that I shall need to sell a lot of stock. Can
  you tell me of any private financier who could raise a loan of a million
  pounds in cash within the course of a week?"</p>

  <p>The stockbroker looked dubious.</p>

  <p>"In cash," he repeated. "Money isn't raised that way, you know. I doubt
  whether there are many men in the whole city of London who could put up such
  an amount with only a week's notice."</p>

  <p>"But there must be some one," Peter persisted. "Think! It would probably
  be a firm or a man not obtrusively English. I don't think the Jews would
  touch it, and a German citizen would be impossible."</p>

  <p>"Semi-political, eh?"</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>"It is rather that way," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Would your friend Count von Hern be likely to be concerned in it?"</p>

  <p>"Why?" Peter asked, with immovable face.</p>

  <p>"Nothing, only I saw him coming out of Heseltine-Wrigge's office the other
  day," the stockbroker remarked, carelessly.</p>

  <p>"And who is Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge?"</p>

  <p>"A very wealthy American financier," the stockbroker replied, "not at all
  an unlikely person for a loan of the sort you mention."</p>

  <p>"American citizen?" Peter inquired.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt. Of German descent, I should say, but nothing much left
  of it in his appearance. He settled over here in a huff because New York
  society wouldn't receive his wife."</p>

  <p>"I remember all about it," Peter declared. "She was a chorus girl, wasn't
  she? Nothing particular against her, but the fellow had no tact. Do you know
  him, Edwardes?"</p>

  <p>"Slightly," the stockbroker answered.</p>

  <p>"Give me a letter to him," Peter said. "Give my credit as good a leg as
  you can. I shall probably go as a borrower."</p>

  <p>Mr. Edwardes wrote a few lines and handed them to his client.</p>

  <p>"Office is nearly opposite," he remarked. "Wish you luck, whatever your
  scheme is."</p>

  <p>Peter crossed the street and entered the building which his friend had
  pointed out. He ascended in the lift to the third floor, knocked at the door
  which bore Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge's name, and almost ran into the arms of a
  charmingly dressed little lady, who was being shown out by a
  broad-shouldered, typical American. Peter hastened to apologize.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said, raising his hat. "I was rather in a hurry
  and I quite thought I heard some one say 'Come in.'"</p>

  <p>The lady replied pleasantly. Her companion, who was carrying his hat in
  his hand, paused reluctantly.</p>

  <p>"Did you want to see me?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"If you are Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, I did," Peter admitted. "I am the Baron
  de Grost, and I have a letter of introduction to you from Mr. Edwardes."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge tore open the envelope and glanced through the
  contents of the note. Peter, meanwhile, looked at his wife with genuine but
  respectfully cloaked admiration. The lady obviously returned his
  interest.</p>

  <p>"Why, if you're the Baron de Grost," she exclaimed, "didn't you marry Vi
  Brown? She used to be at the Gaiety with me, years ago."</p>

  <p>"I certainly did marry Violet Brown," Peter confessed, "and, if you will
  allow me to say so, Mrs. Heseltine-Wrigge, I should have recognized you
  anywhere from your photographs."</p>

  <p>"Say, isn't that queer?" the little lady remarked, turning to her husband.
  "I should love to see Vi again."</p>

  <p>"If you will give me your address," Peter declared, promptly, "my wife
  will be delighted to call upon you."</p>

  <p>The man looked up from the note.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to talk business with me, Baron?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"For a few moments only," Peter answered. "I am afraid I am a great
  nuisance, and if you wish it I will come down to the city again."</p>

  <p>"That's all right," Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge replied. "Myra won't mind waiting
  a minute or two. Come through here."</p>

  <p>He turned and led the way into a quiet-looking suite of offices, where one
  or two clerks were engaged writing at open desks. They all three passed into
  an inner room.</p>

  <p>"Any objections to my wife coming in?" Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge asked.
  "there's scarcely any place for her out there."</p>

  <p>"Delighted," Peter answered.</p>

  <p>She glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Remember we have to meet the Count von Hern at half past one at Prince's,
  Charles," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>Her husband nodded. There was nothing in Peter's expression to denote that
  he had already achieved the first object of his visit!</p>

  <p>"I shall not detain you," he said. "Your name has been mentioned to me,
  Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, as a financier likely to have a large sum of money at
  his disposal. I have a scheme which needs money. Providing the security is
  unexceptionable, are you in a position to do a deal?"</p>

  <p>"How much do you want?" Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge asked.</p>

  <p>"A million to a million and a half," Peter answered.</p>

  <p>"Dollars?</p>

  <p>"Pounds."</p>

  <p>It was not Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge's pose to appear surprised. Nevertheless,
  his eyebrows were slightly raised.</p>

  <p>"Say, what is this scheme?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"First of all," Peter replied, "I should like to know whether there's any
  chance of business if I disclose it."</p>

  <p>"Not an atom," Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge declared. "I have just committed
  myself to the biggest financial transaction of my life and it will clean me
  out."</p>

  <p>"Then I won't waste your time," Peter announced, rising.</p>

  <p>"Sit down for a moment," Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge invited, biting the end off
  a cigar and passing the box toward Peter. "That's all right. My wife doesn't
  mind. Say, it strikes me as rather a curious thing that you should come in
  here and talk about a million and a half, when that's just the amount
  concerned in my other little deal."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact, it isn't at all queer," he answered. "I don't want
  the money. I came to see whether you were really interested in the other
  affair&mdash;the Turkish loan, you know."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge withdrew his cigar from his mouth and looked steadily
  at his visitor.</p>

  <p>"Say, Baron," he declared, "you've got a nerve!"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Peter replied. "I'm here as much in your interests as my
  own."</p>

  <p>"Whom do you represent, anyway?" Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge inquired.</p>

  <p>"A company you have never heard of," Peter replied. "Our offices are in
  the underground places of the world, and we don't run to brass plates. I am
  here because I am curious about that loan. Turkey hasn't a shadow of security
  to offer you. Everything which she can pledge is pledged, to guarantee the
  interest on existing loans to France and England. She is prevented by treaty
  from borrowing in Germany. If you make a loan without security, Mr.
  Heseltine-Wrigge, I suppose you understand your position. The loan may be
  repudiated at any moment."</p>

  <p>"Kind of a philanthropist, aren't you, Baron?" Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge
  remarked quietly.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," Peter assured him. "I know there is some tricky work
  going on and I haven't brains enough to get to the bottom of it. That's why
  I've come blundering in to you, and why I suppose you'll be telling the whole
  story to the Count von Hern at luncheon in an hour's time."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge smoked in silence for a moment or two.</p>

  <p>"This transaction of mine," he said at last, "Isn't one I can talk about.
  I guess I'm on to what you want to know, but I simply can't tell you. The
  security is unusual, but it's good enough for me."</p>

  <p>"It seems so to you, beyond a doubt," Peter replied. "Still, you have to
  do with a remarkably clever young man in the Count von Hern. I don't want to
  ask you any questions you feel I ought not to, but I do wish you'd tell me
  one thing."</p>

  <p>"Go right ahead," Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge invited. "Don't be shy."</p>

  <p>"What day are you concluding this affair?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge scratched his chin for a moment thoughtfully and
  glanced at his diary. "Well, I'll risk that," he decided. "A week to-day I
  hand over the coin."</p>

  <p>Peter drew a little breath of relief. A week was an immense time! He rose
  to his feet.</p>

  <p>"That ends our business, then, for the present," he said. "Now I am going
  to ask both of you a favor. Perhaps I have no right to, but as a man of
  honor, Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, you can take it from me that I ask it in your
  interests as well as my own. Don't tell the Count von Hern of my visit to
  you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he declared. "You hear, Myra?"</p>

  <p>"I'll be dumb, Baron," she promised. "Say, when do you think Vi can come
  and see me?"</p>

  <p>Peter was guilty of snobbery. He considered it quite a justifiable
  weapon.</p>

  <p>"She is at Windsor this afternoon," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"What, at the Garden-Party?" Mrs. Heseltine-Wrigge almost shrieked.</p>

  <p>Peter nodded.</p>

  <p>"I believe there's some fete or other to-morrow," he said, "but we're
  alone this evening. Why won't you dine with us, say at the Carlton?"</p>

  <p>"We'd love to," the lady assented, promptly.</p>

  <p>"At eight o'clock," Peter said, taking his leave.</p>

  <p>The dinner party was a great success. Mrs. Heseltine-Wrigge found herself
  among the class of people with whom it was her earnest desire to become
  acquainted, and her husband was well satisfied to see her keen longing for
  society likely to be gratified. The subject of Peter's call at the office in
  the city was studiously ignored. It was not until the very end of the
  evening, indeed, that the host of this very agreeable party was rewarded by a
  single hint. It all came about in the most natural manner. They were speaking
  of foreign capitals.</p>

  <p>"I love Paris," Mrs. Heseltine-Wrigge told her host. "Just adore it.
  Charles is often there on business and I always go along."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled. There was just a chance here.</p>

  <p>"Your husband does not often have to leave London though," he remarked,
  carelessly.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Not often enough," she declared. "I just love getting about. Last week we
  had a perfectly horrible trip, though. We started off for Belfast quite
  unexpectedly, and I hated every minute of it."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled inwardly, but he said never a word. His companion was already
  chattering on about something else. Peter crossed the hall a few minutes
  later, to speak to an acquaintance, slipped out to the telephone booth and
  spoke to his servant.</p>

  <p>"A bag and a change," he ordered, "at Euston Station at twelve o'clock, in
  time for the Irish mail. Your mistress will be home as usual."</p>

  <p>An hour later the dinner party broke up. Early the next morning, Peter
  crossed the Irish Channel. He returned the following day and crossed again
  within a few hours. In five days the affair was finished, except for the
  denouement.</p>

  <p>Peter ascended in the lift to Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge's office the following
  Thursday, calm and unruffled as usual, but nevertheless a little exultant. It
  was barely half an hour since he had become finally prepared for this
  interview. He was looking forward to it now with feelings of undiluted
  satisfaction. Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge was in, he was told, and he was at once
  admitted to his presence. The financier greeted him with a somewhat curious
  smile.</p>

  <p>"Say, this is very nice of you to look me up again!" he exclaimed. "Still
  worrying about that loan, eh?"</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"No, I'm not worrying about that any more," he answered, accepting one of
  his host's cigars. "The fact of it is that if it were not for me, you would
  be the one who would have to do the worrying."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge stopped short in the act of lighting his cigar.</p>

  <p>"I'm not quite on," he remarked. "What's the trouble?"</p>

  <p>"There is no trouble, fortunately," Peter replied. "Only a little
  disappointment for our friends the Count von Hern and Major Kosuth. I have
  brought you some information which I think will put an end to that affair of
  the loan."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge sat quite still for a moment. He brows were knitted,
  he showed no signs of nervousness.</p>

  <p>"Go right on," he said.</p>

  <p>"The security upon which you were going to advance a million and a half to
  the Turkish Government," Peter continued, "consisted of two Dreadnoughts and
  a cruiser, being built to the order of that country by Messrs. Shepherd &amp;
  Hargreaves at Belfast."</p>

  <p>"Quite right," Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge admitted, quietly. "I have been up and
  seen the boats. I have seen the shipbuilders, too."</p>

  <p>"Did you happen to mention to the latter," Peter inquired, "that you were
  advancing money upon those vessels?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge replied. "Kosuth wouldn't hear of
  such a thing. If the papers got wind of it, there'd be the devil to pay. All
  the same, I have got an assignment from the Turkish Government."</p>

  <p>"Not worth the paper it's written on," Peter declared, blandly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge rose unsteadily to his feet. He was a strong, silent
  man, but there was a queer look about his mouth.</p>

  <p>"What the devil do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Briefly, this," Peter explained. "The first payment, when these ships
  were laid down, was made not by Turkey but by an emissary of the German
  Government, who arranged the whole affair in Constantinople. The second
  payment was due ten months ago, and not a penny has been paid. Notice was
  given to the late government twice and absolutely ignored. According to the
  charter, therefore, these ships reverted to the shipbuilding companies who
  retained possession of the first payment as indemnity against loss. The Count
  von Hern's position was this. He represents the German Government. You were
  to find a million and a half of money with the ships as security. You also
  have a contract from the Count von Hern to take those ships off your hands
  provided the interest on the loan became overdue, a state of affairs which I
  can assure you would have happened within the next twelve months.
  Practically, therefore, you were made use of as an independent financier to
  provide the money with which the Turkish Government, broadly speaking, have
  sold the ships to Germany. You see, according to the charter of the
  shipbuilding company, these vessels cannot be sold to any foreign government
  without the consent of Downing Street. That is the reason why the affair had
  to be conducted in such a roundabout manner."</p>

  <p>"All this is beyond me," Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge said, hoarsely. "I don't
  care a d-n who has the ships in the end so long as I get my money!"</p>

  <p>"But you would not get your money," Peter pointed out, "because there will
  be no ships. I have had the shrewdest lawyers in the world at work upon the
  charter, and there is not the slightest doubt that these vessels are, or
  rather were, the entire property of Messrs. Shepherd &amp; Hargreaves. To-day
  they belong to me. I have bought them and paid two hundred thousand pounds
  deposit. I can show you the receipt and all the papers."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge, said only one word, but that word was profane.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, of course, that you have lost the business," Peter concluded,
  "but surely it's better than losing your money?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge struck the table fiercely with his fist. There was a
  gray and unfamiliar look about his face.</p>

  <p>"D-n it, the money's gone!" he declared, hoarsely. "They changed the day.
  Kosuth had to go back. I paid it twenty-four hours ago."</p>

  <p>Peter whistled softly.</p>

  <p>"If only you had trusted me a little more!" he murmured. "I tried to warn
  you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge snatched up his hat.</p>

  <p>"They don't leave till the two-twenty," he shouted. "We'll catch them at
  the Milan. If we don't, I'm ruined! By God, I'm ruined!"</p>

  <p>They found Major Kosuth in the hall of the hotel. He was wearing a fur
  coat and was otherwise attired for traveling. His luggage was already being
  piled upon a cab. Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge wasted no words upon him.</p>

  <p>"You and I have got to have a talk, right here and now," he declared.
  "Where's the Count?"</p>

  <p>Major Kosuth frowned gloomily.</p>

  <p>"I do not understand you," he said, shortly. "Our business is concluded
  and I am leaving by the two-twenty train."</p>

  <p>"You are doing nothing of the sort," the American answered, standing
  before him, grim and threatening.</p>

  <p>The Turk showed no sign of terror. He gripped his silver-headed cane
  firmly.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that there is no one here who will prevent me."</p>

  <p>Peter, who saw a fracas imminent, hastily intervened. "If you will permit
  me for a moment," he said, "there is a little explanation I should perhaps
  make to Major Kosuth."</p>

  <p>The Turk took a step towards the door.</p>

  <p>"I have no time to listen to explanations from you or any one," he
  replied. "My cab is waiting. I depart. If Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge is not
  satisfied with our transaction, I am sorry, but it is too late to alter
  anything."</p>

  <p>For a moment it seemed as though a struggle between the two men was
  inevitable. Already people were glancing at them curiously, for Mr.
  Heseltine-Wrigge came of a primitive school, and he had no intention whatever
  of letting his man escape. Fortunately, at that moment Count von Hern came up
  and Peter at once appealed to him.</p>

  <p>"Count," he said, "may I beg for your good offices? My friend, Mr.
  Heseltine-Wrigge here, is determined to have a few words with Major Kosuth
  before he leaves. Surely this is not an unreasonable request when you
  consider the magnitude of the transaction which has taken place between them!
  Let me beg of you to persuade Major Kosuth to give us ten minutes. There is
  plenty of time for the train, and this is not the place for a brawl."</p>

  <p>"It will not take us long, Kosuth, to hear what our friend has to say," he
  remarked. "We shall be quite quiet in the smoking-room. Let us go in there
  and dispose of the affair."</p>

  <p>The Turk turned unwillingly in the direction indicated. All four men
  passed through the cafe, up some stairs, and into the small smoking-room. The
  room was deserted. Peter led the way to the far corner, and standing with his
  elbow leaning upon the mantelpiece, addressed them.</p>

  <p>"The position is this," he said. "Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge has parted with a
  million and a half of his own money, a loan to the Turkish Government, on
  security which is not worth a snap of the fingers."</p>

  <p>"It is a lie!" Major Kosuth exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"My dear Baron, you are woefully misinformed," the Count declared.</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I am not misinformed. My friend here has parted with the
  money on the security of two battleships and a cruiser, now building in
  Shepherd &amp; Hargreaves' yard at Belfast. The two battleships and cruiser
  in question belong to me. I have paid two hundred thousand pounds on account
  of them, and hold the shipbuilder's receipt."</p>

  <p>"You are mad!" Bernadine cried, contemptuously.</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head and continued.</p>

  <p>"The battleships were laid down for the Turkish Government, and the money
  with which to start them was supplied by the Secret Service of Germany. The
  second installment was due ten months ago and has not been paid. The time of
  grace provided for has expired. The shipbuilders, in accordance with their
  charter, were consequently at liberty to dispose of the vessels as they
  thought fit. On the statement of the whole of the facts to the head of the
  firm, he has parted with these ships to me. I need not say that I have a
  purchaser within a mile from here. It is a fancy of mine, Count von Hern,
  that those ships will sail better under the British flag."</p>

  <p>There was a moment's tense silence. The face of the Turk was black with
  anger. Bernadine was trembling with rage.</p>

  <p>"This is a tissue of lies!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Peter shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"The facts are easy enough for you to prove," he said, "and I have here,"
  he added, producing a roll of papers, "copies of the various documents for
  your inspection. Your scheme, of course, was simple enough. It fell through
  for this one reason only. A final notice, pressing for the second installment
  and stating the days of grace, was forwarded to Constantinople about the time
  of the recent political troubles. The late government ignored it. In fairness
  to Major Kosuth, we will believe that the present government was ignorant of
  it. But the fact remains that Messrs. Shepherd &amp; Hargreaves became at
  liberty to sell those vessels, and that I have bought them. You will have to
  give up that money, Major Kosuth."</p>

  <p>"By God, he shall!" the American muttered.</p>

  <p>Bernadine leaned a little towards his enemy.</p>

  <p>"You must give us a minute or two," he insisted. "We shall not go away, I
  promise you. Within five minutes you shall hear our decision."</p>

  <p>Peter sat down at the writing-table and commenced a letter. Mr.
  Heseltine-Wrigge mounted guard over the door and stood there, a grim figure
  of impatience. Before the five minutes was up, Bernadine crossed the
  room.</p>

  <p>"I congratulate you, Baron," he said, dryly. "You are either an
  exceedingly lucky person or you are more of a genius than I believe. Kosuth
  is even now returning his letters of credit to your friend. You are quite
  right. The loan cannot stand."</p>

  <p>"I was sure," Peter answered, "that you would see the matter
  correctly."</p>

  <p>"You and I," Bernadine continued, "know very well that I don't care a fig
  about Turkey, new or old. The ships I will admit that I intended to have for
  my own country. As it is, I wish you joy of them. Before they are completed,
  we may be fighting in the air."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled, and, side by side with Bernadine, strolled across to
  Heseltine-Wrigge, who was buttoning up a pocket-book with trembling
  fingers.</p>

  <p>"Personally," Peter said, "I believe that the days of wars are over."</p>

  <p>"That may or may not be," Bernadine answered. "One thing is very certain.
  Even if the nations remain at peace, there are enmities which strike only
  deeper as the years pass. I am going to take a drink now with my disappointed
  friend Kosuth. If I raise my glass 'To the Day!' you will understand."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled.</p>

  <p>"My friend Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge and I are for the same destination," he
  replied, pushing open the swing door which led to the bar. "I return your
  good wishes, Count. I, too, drink 'To the Day!'"</p>

  <p>Bernadine and Kosuth left, a few minutes afterwards. Mr. Heseltine-Wrigge,
  who was feeling himself again, watched them depart with ill-concealed
  triumph.</p>

  <p>"Say, you had those fellows on toast, Baron," he declared, admiringly. "I
  couldn't follow the whole affair, but I can see that you're in for big things
  sometimes. Remember this. If money counts at any time, I'm with you."</p>

  <p>Peter clasped his hand.</p>

  <p>"Money always counts," he said, "and friends!"</p>

  <h2>VIII. THE MAN BEHIND THE CURTAIN</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Jul 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">Peter, Baron de Grost, glanced at the card which his butler
  had brought in to him, carelessly at first, afterwards with that curious
  rigidity of attention which usually denotes the setting free of a flood of
  memories.</p>

  <p>"The gentleman would like to see you, sir," the man announced.</p>

  <p>"You can show him in at once," Peter replied. The servant withdrew. Peter,
  during those few minutes of waiting, stood with his back to the room and his
  face to the window, looking out across the square, in reality seeing nothing,
  completely immersed in this strange flood of memories. John Dory&mdash;Sir
  John Dory now&mdash;his quondam enemy, and he, had met but seldom during
  these years of their prosperity. The figure of this man, who had once loomed
  so largely in his life, had gradually shrunk away into the background. Their
  avoidance of each other arose, perhaps, from a sort of instinct which was
  certainly no matter of ill-will. Still, the fact remained that they had
  scarcely exchanged a word for years, and Peter turned to receive his
  unexpected guest with a curiosity which he did not trouble wholly to
  conceal.</p>

  <p>Sir John Dory&mdash;Chief Commissioner now of Scotland Yard, a person of
  weight and importance&mdash;had changed a great deal during the last few
  years. His hair had become gray, his walk more dignified. There was the
  briskness, however, of his best days in his carriage and in the flash of his
  brown eyes. He held out his hand to his ancient foe with a smile.</p>

  <p>"My dear Baron," he said, "I hope you are going to say that you are glad
  to see me."</p>

  <p>"Unless," Peter replied, with a good-humored grimace, "your visit is
  official, I am more than glad&mdash;I am charmed. Sit down. I was just going
  to take my morning cigar. You will join me? Good! Now I am ready for the
  worst that can happen."</p>

  <p>The two men seated themselves. John Dory pulled at his cigar
  appreciatively, sniffed its flavor for a moment, and then leaned forward in
  his chair.</p>

  <p>"My visit, Baron," he announced, "is semi-official. I am here to ask you a
  favor."</p>

  <p>"An official favor?" Peter demanded quickly.</p>

  <p>His visitor hesitated as though he found the question hard to answer.</p>

  <p>"To tell you the truth," he declared, "this call of mine is wholly an
  inspiration. It does not in any way concern you personally, or your position
  in this country. What that may be I do not know, except that I am sure it is
  above any suspicion."</p>

  <p>"Quite so," Peter murmured. "How diplomatic you have become, my dear
  friend!"</p>

  <p>John Dory smiled.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am fencing about too much," he said. "I know, of course, that
  you are a member of a very powerful and wealthy French Society, whose object
  and aims, so far as I know, are entirely harmless."</p>

  <p>"I am delighted to be assured that you recognize that fact," Peter
  admitted.</p>

  <p>"I might add," John Dory continued, "that this harmlessness&mdash;is of
  recent date."</p>

  <p>"Really, you do seem to know a good deal," Peter confessed.</p>

  <p>"I find myself still fencing," Dory declared. "A matter of habit, I
  suppose. I didn't mean to when I came. I made up my mind to tell you simply
  that Guillot was in London, and to ask you if you could help me to get rid of
  him."</p>

  <p>Peter looked thoughtfully into his companion's face, but he did not speak.
  He understood at such moments the value of silence.</p>

  <p>"We speak together," Dory continued softly, "as men who understand one
  another. Guillot is the one criminal in Europe whom we all fear; not I alone,
  mind you&mdash;it is the same in Berlin, in Petersburg, in Vienna. He has
  never been caught. It is my honest belief that he never will be caught. At
  the same time, wherever he arrives the thunder-clouds gather. He leaves
  behind him always a trail of evil deeds."</p>

  <p>"Very well put," Peter murmured. "Quite picturesque."</p>

  <p>"Can you help me to get rid of him?" Dory inquired. "I have my hands full
  just now, as you can imagine, what with the political crisis and these
  constant mass meetings. I want Guillot out of the country. If you can manage
  this for me, I shall be your eternal debtor."</p>

  <p>"Why do you imagine," Peter asked, "that I can help you in this
  matter?"</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. John Dory knocked the ash from his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Times have changed," he said. "The harmlessness of your great Society, my
  dear Baron, is at present admitted. But there were days&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Exactly," Peter interrupted. "As shrewd as ever, I perceive. Do you know
  anything of the object of his coming?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"Anything of his plans?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing."</p>

  <p>"You know where he is staying?"</p>

  <p>"Naturally," Dory answered. "He has taken a second-floor flat in Crayshaw
  Mansions, Shaftesbury Avenue. As usual, he is above all petty artifices. He
  has taken it under the name of Monsieur Guillot."</p>

  <p>"I really don't know whether there is anything I can do," Peter decided,
  "but I will look into the matter for you, with pleasure. Perhaps I may be
  able to bring a little influence to bear&mdash;indirectly, of course. If so,
  it is at your service. Lady Dory is well, I trust?"</p>

  <p>"In the best of health," Sir John replied, accepting the hint and rising
  to his feet. "I shall hear from you soon?"</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," Peter answered. "I must certainly call upon Monsieur
  Guillot."</p>

  <p>Peter certainly wasted no time in paying his promised visit. That same
  afternoon he rang the bell at the flat in Crayshaw Mansions. A typical French
  butler showed him into the room where the great man sat. Monsieur Guillot,
  slight, elegant, pre-eminently a dandy, was lounging upon a sofa, being
  manicured by a young lady. He threw down his Petit Journal and rose to his
  feet, however, at his visitor's entrance.</p>

  <p>"My dear Baron," he exclaimed, "but this is charming of you!
  Mademoiselle," he added, turning to the manicurist, "you will do me the favor
  of retiring for a short time. Permit me."</p>

  <p>He opened the door and showed her out. Then he came back to Peter.</p>

  <p>"A visit of courtesy, Monsieur le Baron?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," Peter replied.</p>

  <p>"It is beyond all measure charming of you," Guillot declared, "but let me
  ask you a little question. Is it peace or war?"</p>

  <p>"It is what you choose to make it," Peter answered.</p>

  <p>The man threw out his hands. There was the shadow of a frown upon his pale
  forehead. It was a matter for protest, this.</p>

  <p>"Why do you come?" he demanded. "What have we in common? The Society has
  expelled me. Very well, I go my own way. Why not? I am free of your control
  to-day. You have no more right to interfere with my schemes than I with
  yours."</p>

  <p>"We have the ancient right of power," Peter said, grimly. "You were once a
  prominent member of our organization, the spoilt protege of Madame, a
  splendid maker, if you will, of criminal history. Those days have passed. We
  offered you a pension which you have refused. It is now our turn to speak. We
  require you to leave this city in twenty-four hours."</p>

  <p>The face was livid with anger. He was of the fair type of Frenchman, with
  deep-set eyes, and a straight, cruel mouth only partly concealed by his
  golden mustache. Just now, notwithstanding the veneer of his too perfect
  clothes and civilized air, the beast had leaped out. His face was like the
  face of a snarling animal.</p>

  <p>"I refuse!" he cried. "It is I who refuse! I am here on my own affairs.
  What they may be is no business of yours or of any one else's. That is my
  answer to you, Baron de Grost, whether you come to me for yourself or on
  behalf of the Society to which I no longer belong. That is my
  answer&mdash;that and the door," he added, pressing the bell. "If you will,
  we fight. If you are wise, forget this visit as quickly as you can."</p>

  <p>Peter took up his hat. The man-servant was already in the room.</p>

  <p>"We shall probably meet again before your return, Monsieur Guillot," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>Guillot had recovered himself. His smile was wicked, but his bow
  perfection.</p>

  <p>"To the fortunate hour, Monsieur le Baron!" he replied.</p>

  <p>Peter drove hack to Berkeley Square, and without a moment's hesitation
  pressed the levers which set to work the whole underground machinery of the
  great power which he controlled. Thenceforward, Monsieur Guillot was
  surrounded with a vague army of silent watchers. They passed in and out of
  his fiat, their motor cars were as fast as his in the streets, their fancy in
  restaurants identical with his. Guillot moved through it all like a man
  wholly unconscious of espionage, showing nothing of the murderous anger which
  burned in his blood. The reports came to Peter every hour, although there
  was, indeed, nothing worth chronicling. Monsieur Guillot's visit to London
  would seem, indeed, to be a visit of gallantry. He spent most of his time
  with Mademoiselle Louise, the famous dancer. He was prominent at the Empire,
  to watch her nightly performance, they were a noticeable couple supping
  together at the Milan afterwards. Monsieur Guillot was indeed a man of
  gallantry, but he had the reputation of using these affairs to cloak his real
  purposes. Those who watched him, watched only the more closely. Monsieur
  Guillot, who stood it very well at first, unfortunately lost his temper. He
  drove in the great motor car which he had brought with him from Paris, to
  Berkeley Square, and confronted Peter.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he exclaimed, though indeed the glitter in his eyes knew
  nothing of friendship, "it is intolerable, this! Do you think that I do not
  see through these dummy waiters, these obsequious shopmen, these ladies who
  drop their eyes when I pass, these commissionaires, these would-be
  acquaintances? I tell you that they irritate me, this incompetent, futile
  crowd. You pit them against me! Bah! You should know better. When I choose to
  disappear, I shall disappear, and no one will follow me. When I strike, I
  shall strike, and no one will discover what my will may be. You are out of
  date, dear Baron, with your third-rate army of stupid spies. You succeed in
  one thing only&mdash;you succeed in making me angry."</p>

  <p>"It is at least an achievement, that," Peter declared.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Monsieur Guillot admitted, fiercely. "Yet mark now the result.
  I defy you, you and all of them. Look at your clock. It is five minutes to
  seven. It goes well, that clock, eh?"</p>

  <p>"It is the correct time," Peter said.</p>

  <p>"Then by midnight," Guillot continued, shaking his fist in the other's
  face, "I shall have done that thing which brought me to England and I shall
  have disappeared. I shall have done it in spite of your watchers, in spite of
  your spies, in spite, even, of you, Monsieur le Baron de Grost. There is my
  challenge. Voila. Take it up if you will. At midnight you shall hear me
  laugh. I have the honor to wish you good-night!"</p>

  <p>Peter opened the door with his own hands.</p>

  <p>"This is excellent," he declared. "You are now, indeed, the Monsieur
  Guillot of old. Almost you persuade me to take up your challenge."</p>

  <p>Guillot laughed derisively.</p>

  <p>"As you please!" he exclaimed. "By midnight tonight!"</p>

  <p>The challenge of Monsieur Guillot was issued precisely at four minutes
  before seven. On his departure, Peter spent the next half-hour studying
  certain notes and sending various telephone messages. Afterwards, he changed
  his clothes at the usual time and sat down to a tete-a-tete dinner with his
  wife. Three times during the course of the meal he was summoned to the
  telephone, and from each call he returned more perplexed. Finally, when the
  servants had left the room, he took his chair around to his wife's side.</p>

  <p>"Violet," he said, "you were asking me just now about the telephone. You
  were quite right. These were not ordinary messages which I have been
  receiving. I am engaged in a little matter which, I must confess, perplexes
  me. I want your advice, perhaps your help."</p>

  <p>"I am quite ready," she answered, smiling. "It is a long time since you
  gave me anything to do."</p>

  <p>"You have heard of Guillot?"</p>

  <p>She reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"You mean the wonderful Frenchman," she asked, "the head of the criminal
  department of the Double-Four?"</p>

  <p>"The man who was at its head when it existed. The criminal department, as
  you know, has all been done away with. The Double-Four has now no more
  concern with those who break the law, save in those few instances where great
  issues demand it."</p>

  <p>"But Monsieur Guillot still exists?"</p>

  <p>"He not only exists," answered Peter, "but he is here in London, a rebel
  and a defiant one. Do you know who came to see me the other morning?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Sir John Dory," Peter continued. "He came here with a request. He begged
  for my help. Guillot is here, committed to some enterprise which no one can
  wholly fathom. Dory has enough to do with other things, as you can imagine,
  just now. Besides, I think he recognizes that Monsieur Guillot is rather a
  hard nut for the ordinary English detective to crack."</p>

  <p>"And you?" she demanded, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"I join forces with Dory," Peter admitted. "Sogrange agrees with me.
  Guillot was associated with the Double-Four too long for us to have him make
  scandalous history either here or in Paris."</p>

  <p>"You have seen him?"</p>

  <p>"I have not only seen him, but declared war against him."</p>

  <p>"And he?"</p>

  <p>"Guillot is defiant," Peter replied. "He has been here only this evening.
  He mocks at me. He swears that he will bring off this enterprise, whatever it
  may be, before midnight to-night, and he has defied me to stop him."</p>

  <p>"But you will," she murmured, softly.</p>

  <p>Peter smiled. The conviction in his wife's tone was a subtle compliment
  which he did not fail to appreciate.</p>

  <p>"I have hopes," he confessed, "and yet, let me tell you this, Violet. I
  have never been more puzzled. Ask yourself, now. What enterprise is there
  worthy of a man like Guillot, in which he could engage himself here in London
  between now and midnight? Any ordinary theft is beneath him. The purloining
  of the crown jewels, perhaps, he might consider, but I don't think that
  anything less in the way of robbery would bring him here. He has his code and
  he is as vain as a peacock. Yet money is at the root of everything he
  does."</p>

  <p>"How does he spend his time here?" Violet asked.</p>

  <p>"He has a handsome flat in Shaftesbury Avenue," Peter answered, "where he
  lives, to all appearance, the life of an idle man of fashion. The whole of
  his spare time is spent with Mademoiselle Louise, the danseuse at the Empire.
  You see, it is half-past eight now. I have eleven men altogether at work, and
  according to my last report he was dining with her in the grill-room at the
  Milan. They have just ordered their coffee ten minutes ago, and the car is
  waiting outside to take Mademoiselle to the Empire. Guillot's box is engaged
  there, as usual. If he proposes to occupy it, he is leaving himself a very
  narrow margin of time to carry out any enterprise worth speaking of."</p>

  <p>Violet was thoughtful for several moments. Then she crossed the room, took
  up a copy of an illustrated paper, and brought it across to Peter. He smiled
  as he glanced at the picture to which she pointed, and the few lines
  underneath.</p>

  <p>"It has struck you, too, then!" he exclaimed. "Good! You have answered me
  exactly as I hoped. Somehow, I scarcely trusted myself. I have both cars
  waiting outside. We may need them. You won't mind coming to the Empire with
  me?"</p>

  <p>"Mind!" she laughed. "I only hope I may be in at the finish."</p>

  <p>"If the finish," Peter remarked, "is of the nature which I anticipate, I
  shall take particularly good care that you are not."</p>

  <p>The curtain was rising upon the first act of the ballet as they entered
  the most popular music-hall in London and were shown to the box which Peter
  had engaged. The house was full&mdash;crowded, in fact, almost to excess.
  They had scarcely taken their seats when a roar of applause announced the
  coming of Mademoiselle Louise. She stood for a moment to receive her nightly
  ovation, a slim, beautiful creature, looking out upon the great house with
  that faint, bewitching smile at the corners of her lips, which every
  photographer in Europe had striven to reproduce. Then she moved away to the
  music, an exquisite figure, the personification of all that was alluring in
  her sex. Violet leaned forward to watch her movements as she plunged into the
  first dance. Peter was occupied looking around the house. Monsieur Guillot
  was there, sitting insolently forward in his box, sleek and immaculate. He
  even waved his hand and bowed as he met Peter's eye. Somehow or other, his
  confidence had its effect. Peter began to feel vaguely troubled. After all,
  his plans were built upon a surmise. It was so easy for him to be wrong. No
  man would show his hand so openly, unless he were sure of the game. Then his
  face cleared a little. In the box adjoining Guillot's, the figure of a
  solitary man was just visible, a man who had leaned over to applaud Louise,
  but who was now sitting back in the shadows. Peter recognized him at once,
  notwithstanding the obscurity. This was so much to the good, at any rate. He
  took up his hat.</p>

  <p>"For a quarter of an hour you will excuse me, Violet," he said. "Watch
  Guillot. If he leaves his place, knock at the door of your own box, and one
  of my men, who is outside, will come to you at once. He will know where to
  find me."</p>

  <p>Peter hurried away, pausing for a moment in the promenade, to scribble a
  line or two at the back of one of his own cards. Presently he knocked at the
  door of the box adjoining Guillot's and was instantly admitted. Violet
  continued her watch. She remained alone until the curtain fell upon the first
  act of the ballet. A few minutes later, Peter returned. She knew at once that
  things were going well. He sank into a chair by her side.</p>

  <p>"I have messages every five minutes," he whispered in her ear, "and I am
  venturing upon a bold stroke. There is still something about the affair,
  though, which I cannot understand. You are absolutely sure that Guillot has
  not moved?"</p>

  <p>Violet pointed with her program across the house. "There he sits," she
  remarked. "He left his chair as the curtain went down, but he could scarcely
  have gone out of the box, for he was back within ten seconds."</p>

  <p>Peter looked steadily across at the opposite box. Guillot was sitting a
  little further back now, as though he no longer courted observation.
  Something about his attitude puzzled the man who watched him. With a sudden
  quick movement he caught up the glasses which stood by his wife's side. The
  curtain was going up for the second act, and Guillot had turned his head.
  Peter held the glasses only for a moment to his eyes, and then glanced down
  at the stage.</p>

  <p>"My God!" he muttered. "The man's a genius! Violet, the small motor is
  coming for you."</p>

  <p>He was out of the box in a single step. Violet looked after him, looked
  down upon the stage and across at Guillot's box. It was hard to
  understand.</p>

  <p>The curtain had scarcely rung up upon the second act of the ballet when a
  young lady who met from all the loungers, and even from the doorkeeper
  himself, the most respectful attention, issued from the stage-door at the
  Empire and stepped into the large motor car which was waiting, drawn up
  against the curb. The door was opened from inside and closed at once. She
  held out her hands, as yet ungloved, to the man who sat back in the
  corner.</p>

  <p>"At last!" she murmured. "And I thought, indeed, that you had forsaken
  me."</p>

  <p>He took her hands and held them tightly, but he answered only in a
  whisper. He wore a sombre black cloak and a broad-brimmed black hat. A
  muffler concealed the lower part of his face. She put her finger upon the
  electric light, but he stopped her.</p>

  <p>"I must not be recognized," he said thickly. "Forgive me, Louise, if I
  seem strange at first, but there is more in it than I can tell you. No one
  must know that I am in London to-night. When we reach this place to which you
  are taking me, and we are really alone, then we can talk. I have so much to
  say."</p>

  <p>She looked at him doubtfully. It was indeed a moment of indecision with
  her. Then she began to laugh softly.</p>

  <p>"Dear one, but you have changed!" she exclaimed, compassionately. "After
  all, why not? I must not forget that things have gone so hardly with you. It
  seems odd, indeed, to see you sitting there, muffled up like an old man,
  afraid to show yourself. You know how foolish you are? With your black cape
  and that queer hat, you are so different from all the others. If you seek to
  remain unrecognized, why do you not dress as all the men do? Any one who was
  suspicious would recognize you from your clothes."</p>

  <p>"It is true," he muttered. "I did not think of it."</p>

  <p>She leaned towards him.</p>

  <p>"You will not even kiss me?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," he answered.</p>

  <p>She made a little grimace.</p>

  <p>"But you are cold!"</p>

  <p>"You do not understand," he answered. "They are watching me&mdash;even
  to-night they are watching me. Oh, if you only knew, Louise, how I have
  longed for this hour that is to come!"</p>

  <p>Her vanity was assuaged. She patted his hand but came no nearer.</p>

  <p>"You are a foolish man," she said, "very foolish."</p>

  <p>"It is not for you to say that," he replied. "If I have been foolish, were
  not you often the cause of my folly?" Again she laughed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, la, la! It is always the same! It is always you men who accuse! For
  that presently I shall reprove you. But now&mdash;as for now, behold, we have
  arrived!"</p>

  <p>"It is a crowded thoroughfare," the man remarked, nervously, looking up
  and down Shaftesbury Avenue.</p>

  <p>"Stupid!" she cried, stepping out. "I do not recognize you to-night,
  little one. Even your voice is different. Follow me quickly across the
  pavement and up the stairs. There is only one flight. The flat I have
  borrowed is on the second floor. I do not care very much that people should
  recognize me either, under the circumstances. There is nothing they love so
  much," she added, with a toss of the head, "as finding an excuse to have my
  picture in the paper."</p>

  <p>He followed her down the dim hall and up the broad, flat stairs, keeping
  always some distance behind. On the first landing she drew a key from her
  pocket and opened a door. It was the door of Monsieur Guillot's sitting-room.
  A round table in the middle was laid for supper. One light alone, and that
  heavily shaded, was burning.</p>

  <p>"Oh, la, la!" she exclaimed. "How I hate this darkness! Wait till I can
  turn on the lights, dear friend, and then you must embrace me. It is from
  outside, I believe. No, do not follow. I can find the switch for myself.
  Remain where you are. I return instantly."</p>

  <p>She left him alone in the room, closing the door softly. In the passage
  she reeled for a moment and caught at her side. She was very pale. Guillot,
  coming swiftly up the steps, frowned as he saw her.</p>

  <p>"He is there?" he demanded, harshly.</p>

  <p>"He is there," Louise replied, "but, indeed, I am angry with myself. See,
  I am faint. It is a terrible thing, this, which I have done. He did me no
  harm, that young man, except that he was stupid and heavy, and that I never
  loved him. Who could love him, indeed! But, Guillot&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He passed on, scarcely heeding her words, but she clung to his arm.</p>

  <p>"Dear one," she begged, "promise that you will not really hurt him.
  Promise me that, or I will shriek out and call the people from the streets
  here. You would not make an assassin of me? Promise!"</p>

  </div>

  <p>Guillot turned suddenly towards her and there were strange things in his
  face. He pointed down the stairs.</p>

  <p>"Go back, Louise," he ordered, "back to your rooms, for your own sake.
  Remember that you have left the theatre too ill to finish your performance.
  You have had plenty of time already to get home. Quick! Leave me to deal with
  this young man. I tell you to go."</p>

  <p>She retreated down the stairs, dumb, her knees shaking with fear. Guillot
  entered the room, closing the door behind him. Even as he bowed to that dark
  figure standing in the corner, his left hand shot forward the bolt.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he said&mdash;</p>

  <p>"What is the meaning of this?" the visitor interrupted, haughtily. "I am
  expecting Mademoiselle Louise. I did not understand that strangers had the
  right of entry into this room."</p>

  <p>Guillot bowed low.</p>

  <p>"Monsieur," he said once more, "it is a matter for my eternal regret that
  I am forced to intrude even for a moment upon an assignation so romantic. But
  there is a little matter which must first be settled. I have some friends
  here who have a thing to say to you."</p>

  <p>He walked softly, with catlike tread, along by the wall to where the thick
  curtains shut out the inner apartment. He caught at the thick velvet, dragged
  it back, and the two rooms were suddenly flooded with light. In the recently
  discovered one, two stalwart-looking men in plain clothes, but of very
  unmistakable appearance, were standing waiting. Guillot staggered back. They
  were strangers to him. He was like a man who looks upon a nightmare. His eyes
  protruded. The words which he tried to utter, failed him. Then, with a swift,
  nervous presentiment, he turned quickly around towards the man who had been
  standing in the shadows. Here, too, the unexpected had happened. It was
  Peter, Baron de Grost, who threw his muffler and broad-brimmed hat upon the
  table.</p>

  <p>"Five minutes to eleven, I believe, Monsieur Guillot," Peter declared. "I
  win by an hour and five minutes."</p>

  <p>Guillot said nothing for several seconds. After all, though, he had great
  gifts. He recovered alike his power of speech and his composure.</p>

  <p>"These gentlemen," he said, pointing with his left hand towards the inner
  room&mdash;"I do not understand their presence in my apartments."</p>

  <p>Peter shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"They represent, I am afraid, the obvious end of things," he explained.
  "You have given me a run for my money, I confess. A Monsieur Guillot who is
  remarkably like you, still occupies your box at the Empire, and Mademoiselle
  Jeanne Lemere, the accomplished understudy of the lady who has just left us,
  is sufficiently like the incomparable Louise to escape, perhaps, detection
  for the first few minutes. But you gave the game away a little, my dear
  Guillot, when you allowed your quarry to come and gaze even from the shadows
  of his box at the woman he adored."</p>

  <p>"Where is&mdash;he?" Guillot faltered.</p>

  <p>"He is on his way back to his country home," Peter replied. "I think that
  he will be cured of his infatuation for Mademoiselle. The assassins whom you
  planted in that room are by this time in Bow Street. The price which others
  beside you knew, my dear Guillot, was placed upon that unfortunate young
  head, will not pass this time into your pocket. For the rest&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"The rest is of no consequence," Guillot interrupted, bowing. "I admit
  that I am vanquished. As for those gentlemen there," he added, waving his
  hand towards the two men who had taken a step forward, "I have a little oath
  which is sacred to me concerning them. I take the liberty, therefore, to
  admit myself defeated, Monsieur le Baron, and to take my leave."</p>

  <p>No one was quick enough to interfere. They had only a glimpse of him as he
  stood there with the revolver pressed to his temple, an impression of a sharp
  report, of Guillot staggering back as the revolver slipped from his fingers
  on to the floor. Even his death cry was stifled. They carried him away
  without any fuss, and Peter was just in time, after all, to see the finish of
  the second act of the ballet. The sham Monsieur Guillot still smirked at the
  sham Louise, but the box by his side was empty.</p>

  <p>"It is over?" Violet asked, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"It is over," Peter answered.</p>

  <p>It was, after all, an unrecorded tragedy. In an obscure corner of the
  morning papers one learned the next day that a Frenchman, who had apparently
  come to the end of his means, had committed suicide in a furnished flat of
  Shaftesbury Avenue. Two foreigners were deported without having been brought
  up for trial, for being suspected persons. A little languid interest was
  aroused at the inquest when one of the witnesses deposed to the deceased's
  having been a famous French criminal. Nothing further transpired, however,
  and the readers of the halfpenny press for once were deprived of their
  sensation. For the rest, Peter received, with much satisfaction, a remarkably
  handsome signet ring, bearing some famous arms, and a telegram from Sogrange:
  "Well done, Baron! May the successful termination of your enterprise nerve
  you for the greater undertaking which is close at hand. I leave for London by
  the night train. Sogrange."</p>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Aug 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">"We may now," Sogrange remarked, buttoning up his ulster,
  and stretching himself out to the full extent of his steamer chair, "consider
  ourselves at sea. I trust, my friend, that you are feeling quite
  comfortable."</p>

  <p>Peter, lying at his ease upon a neighboring chair, with a pillow behind
  his head, a huge fur coat around his body, and a rug over his feet, had all
  the appearance of being very comfortable indeed. His reply, however, was a
  little short&mdash;almost peevish.</p>

  <p>"I am comfortable enough for the present, thank you. Heaven knows how long
  it will last!"</p>

  <p>Sogrange waved his arms towards the great uneasy plain of blue sea, the
  showers of foam leaping into the sunlight, away beyond the disappearing coast
  of France.</p>

  <p>"Last!" he repeated. "For eight days, I hope. Consider, my dear Baron!
  What could be more refreshing, more stimulating to our jaded nerves than
  this? Think of the December fogs you have left behind, the cold, driving
  rain, the puddles in the street, the gray skies&mdash;London, in short, at
  her ugliest and worst."</p>

  <p>"That is all very well," Peter protested, "but I have left several other
  things behind, too."</p>

  <p>"As, for instance?" Sogrange inquired, genially.</p>

  <p>"My wife," Peter informed him. "Violet objects very much to these abrupt
  separations. This week, too, I was shooting at Saxthorpe, and I had also
  several other engagements of a pleasant nature. Besides, I have reached that
  age when I find it disconcerting to be called out of bed in the middle of the
  night to answer a long distance telephone call, and told to embark on a White
  Star liner leaving Liverpool early the next morning. It may be your idea of a
  pleasure trip. It isn't mine."</p>

  <p>Sogrange was amused. His smile, however, was hidden. Only the tip of his
  cigarette was visible.</p>

  <p>"Anything else?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing much, except that I am always seasick," Peter replied
  deliberately. "I can feel it coming on now. I wish that fellow would keep
  away with his beastly mutton broth. The whole ship seems to smell of it."</p>

  <p>Sogrange laughed, softly but without disguise.</p>

  <p>"Who said anything about a pleasure trip?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>Peter turned his head.</p>

  <p>"You did. You told me when you came on at Cherbourg that you had to go to
  New York to look after some property there, that things were very quiet in
  London, and that you hated traveling alone. Therefore, you sent for me at a
  few hours' notice."</p>

  <p>"Is that what I told you?" Sogrange murmured.</p>

  <p>"Yes! Wasn't it true?" Peter asked, suddenly alert.</p>

  <p>"Not a word of it," Sogrange admitted. "It is quite amazing that you
  should have believed it for a moment."</p>

  <p>"I was a fool," Peter confessed. "You see, I was tired and a little cross.
  Besides, somehow or other, I never associated a trip to America
  with&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Sogrange interrupted him quietly, but ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>"Lift up the label attached to the chair next to yours. Read it out to
  me."</p>

  <p>Peter took it into his hand and turned it over. A quick exclamation
  escaped him.</p>

  <p>"Great Heavens! The Count von Hern&mdash;Bernadine!"</p>

  <p>"Just so," Sogrange assented. "Nice clear writing, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Peter sat bolt upright in his chair.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to say that Bernadine is on board?" Sogrange shook his
  head.</p>

  <p>"By the exercise, my dear Baron," he said, "of a superlative amount of
  ingenuity, I was able to prevent that misfortune. Now lean over and read the
  label on the next chair."</p>

  <p>Peter obeyed. His manner had acquired a new briskness. "La Duchesse della
  Nermino," he announced.</p>

  <p>Sogrange nodded.</p>

  <p>"Everything just as it should be," he declared. "Change those labels, my
  friend, as quickly as you can."</p>

  <p>Peter's fingers were nimble and the thing was done in a few seconds.</p>

  <p>"So I am to sit next the Spanish lady," he remarked, feeling for his
  tie.</p>

  <p>"Not only that, but you are to make friends with her," Sogrange replied.
  "You are to be your captivating self, Baron. The Duchesse is to forget her
  weakness for hot rooms. She is to develop a taste for sea air and your
  society."</p>

  <p>"Is she," Peter asked, anxiously, "old or young?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange showed a disposition to fence with the question. "Not old," he
  answered; "certainly not old. Fifteen years ago she was considered to be one
  of the most beautiful women in the world."</p>

  <p>"The ladies of Spain," Peter remarked, with a sigh, "are inclined to
  mature early."</p>

  <p>"In some cases," Sogrange assured him, "there are no women in the world
  who preserve their good looks longer. You shall judge, my friend. Madame
  comes! How about that sea-sickness now?"</p>

  <p>"Gone," Peter declared, briskly. "Absolutely a fancy of mine. Never felt
  better in my life."</p>

  <p>An imposing little procession approached along the deck. There was the
  deck steward leading the way; a very smart French maid carrying a wonderful
  collection of wraps, cushions and books; a black-browed, pallid man-servant,
  holding a hot water bottle in his hand, and leading a tiny Pekinese spaniel,
  wrapped in a sealskin coat; and finally Madame la Duchesse. It was so
  obviously a procession intended to impress, that neither Peter nor Sogrange
  thought it worth while to conceal their interest.</p>

  <p>The Duchesse, save that she was tall and wrapped in magnificent furs,
  presented a somewhat mysterious appearance. Her features were entirely
  obscured by an unusually thick veil of black lace, and the voluminous nature
  of her outer garments only permitted a suspicion as to her figure, which was,
  at that time, at once the despair and the triumph of her corsetiere. With
  both hands she was holding her fur-lined skirts from contact with the deck,
  disclosing at the same time remarkably shapely feet encased in trim patent
  shoes with plain silver buckles, and a little more black silk stocking than
  seemed absolutely necessary. The deck steward, after a half-puzzled scrutiny
  of the labels, let down the chair next to the two men. The Duchesse
  contemplated her prospective neighbors with some curiosity, mingled with a
  certain amount of hesitation. It was at that moment that Sogrange, shaking
  away his rug, rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Madame la Duchesse permits me to remind her of my existence?" he said,
  bowing low. "It is some years since we met, but I had the honor of a dance at
  the Palace in Madrid."</p>

  <p>She held out her hand at once, yet somehow Peter felt sure that she was
  thankful for her veil. Her voice was pleasant, and her air the air of a great
  lady. She spoke French with the soft, sibilant intonation of the
  Spaniard.</p>

  <p>"I remember the occasion perfectly, Marquis," she admitted. "Your sister
  and I once shared a villa in Mentone."</p>

  <p>"I am flattered by your recollection, Duchesse," Sogrange murmured.</p>

  <p>"It is a great surprise to meet with you here, though," she continued. "I
  did not see you at Cherbourg or on the train."</p>

  <p>"I motored from Paris," Sogrange explained, "and arrived, contrary to my
  custom, I must confess, somewhat early. Will you permit that I introduce an
  acquaintance, whom I have been fortunate enough to find on
  board&mdash;Monsieur le Baron de Grost&mdash;Madame la Duchesse della
  Nermino."</p>

  <p>Peter was graciously received and the conversation dealt, for a few
  moments, with the usual banalities of the voyage. Then followed the business
  of settling the Duchesse in her place. When she was really installed, and
  surrounded with all the paraphernalia of a great and fanciful lady, including
  a handful of long cigarettes, she raised for the first time her veil. Peter,
  who was at the moment engaged in conversation with her, was a little shocked
  by the result. Her features were worn, her face dead-white, with many signs
  of the ravages wrought by the constant use of cosmetics. Only her eyes had
  retained something of their former splendor. These latter were almost violet
  in color, deep-set, with dark rims, and were sufficient almost in themselves
  to make one forget for a moment the less prepossessing details of her
  appearance. A small library of books was by her side, but after a while she
  no longer pretended any interest in them. She was a born conversationalist, a
  creature of her country entirely and absolutely feminine, to whom the subtle
  and flattering deference of the other sex was the breath of life itself.
  Peter burned his homage upon her altar with a craft which amounted to genius.
  In less than half an hour, Madame la Duchesse was looking many years younger.
  The vague look of apprehension had passed from her face. Their voices had
  sunk to a confidential undertone, punctuated often by the music of her
  laughter. Sogrange, with a murmured word of apology, had slipped away long
  ago. Decidedly, for an Englishman, Peter was something of a marvel!</p>

  <p>Madame la Duchesse moved her head towards the empty chair.</p>

  <p>"He is a great friend of yours&mdash;the Marquis de Sogrange?" she asked,
  with a certain inflection in her tone which Peter was not slow to notice.</p>

  <p>"Indeed no!" he answered. "A few years ago I was frequently in Paris. I
  made his acquaintance then, but we have met very seldom since."</p>

  <p>"You are not traveling together, then?"</p>

  <p>"By no means. I recognized him only as he boarded the steamer at
  Cherbourg."</p>

  <p>"He is not a popular man in our world," she remarked. "One speaks of him
  as a schemer."</p>

  <p>"Is there anything left to scheme for in France?" Peter asked, carelessly.
  "He is, perhaps, a monarchist?"</p>

  <p>"His ancestry alone would compel a devoted allegiance to royalism," the
  Duchesse declared, "but I do not think that he is interested in any of these
  futile plots to reinstate the House of Orleans. I, Monsieur le Baron, am
  Spanish."</p>

  <p>"I have scarcely lived so far out of the world as to have heard nothing of
  the Duchesse della Nermino," Peter replied with empressement. "The last time
  I saw you, Duchesse, you were in the suite of the Infanta."</p>

  <p>"Like all Englishmen, I see you possess a memory," she said, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Duchesse," Peter answered, lowering his voice, "without the memories
  which one is fortunate enough to collect as one passes along, life would be a
  dreary place. The most beautiful things in the world cannot remain always
  with us. It is well, then, that the shadow of them can be recalled to us in
  the shape of dreams."</p>

  <p>Her eyes rewarded him for his gallantry. Peter felt that he was doing very
  well indeed. He indulged himself in a brief silence. Presently she returned
  to the subject of Sogrange.</p>

  <p>"I think," she remarked, "that of all the men in the world I expected
  least to see the Marquis de Sogrange on board a steamer bound for New York.
  What can a man of his type find to amuse him in the New World?"</p>

  <p>"One wonders, indeed," Peter assented. "As a matter of fact, I did read in
  a newspaper a few days ago that he was going to Mexico in connection with
  some excavations there. He spoke to me of it just now. They seem to have
  discovered a ruined temple of the Incas, or something of the sort."</p>

  <p>The Duchesse breathed what sounded very much like a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"I had forgotten," she admitted, "that New York itself need not
  necessarily be his destination."</p>

  <p>"For my own part," Peter continued, "it is quite amazing, the interest
  which the evening papers always take in the movements of one connected ever
  so slightly with their world. I think that a dozen newspapers have told their
  readers the exact amount of money I am going to lend or borrow in New York,
  the stocks I am going to bull or bear, the mines I am going to purchase. My
  presence on an American steamer is accounted for by the journalists a dozen
  times over. Yours, Duchesse, if one might say so without appearing over
  curious, seems the most inexplicable. What attraction can America possibly
  have for you?"</p>

  <p>She glanced at him covertly from under her sleepy eyelids. Peter's face
  was like the face of a child.</p>

  <p>"You do not, perhaps, know," she said, "that I was born in Cuba. I lived
  there, in fact, for many years. I still have estates in the country."</p>

  <p>"Indeed?" he answered. "Are you interested, then, in this reported salvage
  of the Maine?"</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. Peter, who had not been looking at her when he
  had asked his question, turned his head, surprised at her lack of response.
  His heart gave a little jump. The Duchesse had all the appearance of a woman
  on the point of fainting. One hand was holding a scent bottle to her nose;
  the other, thin and white, ablaze with emeralds and diamonds, was gripping
  the side of her chair. Her expression was one of blank terror. Peter felt a
  shiver chill his own blood at the things he saw in her face. He himself was
  confused, apologetic, yet absolutely without understanding. His thoughts
  reverted at first to his own commonplace malady.</p>

  <p>"You are ill, Duchesse!" he exclaimed. "You will allow me to call the deck
  steward? Or perhaps you would prefer your own maid? I have some brandy in
  this flask."</p>

  <p>He had thrown off his rug, but her imperious gesture kept him seated. She
  was looking at him with an intentness which was almost tragical.</p>

  <p>"What made you ask me that question?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>His innocence was entirely apparent. Not even Peter could have dissembled
  so naturally.</p>

  <p>"That question?" he repeated, vaguely. "You mean about the Maine? It was
  the idlest chance, Duchesse, I assure you. I saw something about it in the
  paper yesterday and it seemed interesting. But if I had had the slightest
  idea that the subject was distasteful to you, I would not have dreamed of
  mentioning it. Even now&mdash;I do not understand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She interrupted him. All the time he had been speaking she had shown signs
  of recovery. She was smiling now, faintly and with obvious effort, but still
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"It is altogether my own fault, Baron," she admitted, graciously. "Please
  forgive my little fit of emotion. The subject is a very sore one among my
  countrypeople, and your sudden mention of it upset me. It was very
  foolish."</p>

  <p>"Duchesse, I was a clumsy idiot!" Peter declared, penitently. "I deserve
  that you should be unkind to me for the rest of the voyage."</p>

  <p>"I could not afford that," she answered, forcing another smile. "I am
  relying too much upon you for companionship. Ah! could I trouble you?" she
  added. "For the moment I need my maid. She passes there."</p>

  <p>Peter sprang up and called the young woman, who was slowly pacing the
  deck. He himself did not at once return to his place. He went instead in
  search of Sogrange, and found him in his stateroom. Sogrange was lying upon a
  couch, in a silk smoking suit, with a French novel in his hand and an air of
  contentment which was almost fatuous. He laid down the volume at Peter's
  entrance.</p>

  <p>"Dear Baron," he murmured, "why this haste! No one is ever in a hurry upon
  a steamer. Remember that we can't possibly get anywhere in less than eight
  days, and there is no task in the world, nowadays, which cannot be
  accomplished in that time. To hurry is a needless waste of tissue, and, to a
  person of my nervous temperament, exceedingly unpleasant."</p>

  <p>Peter sat down on the edge of the bunk.</p>

  <p>"I presume you have quite finished?" he said. "If so, listen to me. I am
  moving in the dark. Is it my fault that I blunder? By the merest accident I
  have already committed a hideous faux pas. You ought to have warned me."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

  <p>"I have spoken to the Duchesse of the Maine disaster."</p>

  <p>The eyes of Sogrange gleamed for a moment, but he lay perfectly still.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he asked. "A good many people are talking about it. It is one
  of the strangest things I have ever heard of, that after all these years they
  should be trying to salve the wreck."</p>

  <p>"It seems worse than strange," Peter declared. "What can be the use of
  trying to stir up bitter feelings between two nations who have fought their
  battles and buried the hatchet? I call it an act of insanity."</p>

  <p>A bugle rang. Sogrange yawned and sat up.</p>

  <p>"Would you mind touching the bell for my servant, Baron," he asked.
  "Dinner will be served in half an hour. Afterwards, we will talk, you and
  I."</p>

  <p>Peter turned away, not wholly pleased.</p>

  <p>"The sooner, the better," he grumbled, "or I shall be putting my foot into
  it again."...</p>

  <p>After dinner, the two men walked on deck together. The night was dark but
  fine, with a strong wind blowing from the northwest. The deck steward called
  their attention to a long line of lights, stealing up from the horizon on
  their starboard side.</p>

  <p>"That's the Lusitania, sir. She'll be up to us in half an hour."</p>

  <p>They leaned over the rail. Soon the blue fires began to play about their
  mast head. Sogrange watched them thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"If one could only read those messages," he remarked, with a sigh, "it
  might help us."</p>

  <p>Peter knocked the ash from his cigar and was silent for a time. He was
  beginning to understand the situation.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he said at last, "I have been doing you an injustice. I have
  come to the conclusion that you are not keeping me in ignorance of the vital
  facts connected with our visit to America, willfully. At the present moment
  you know just a little more, but a very little more than I do."</p>

  <p>"What perception!" Sogrange murmured. "My dear Baron, sometimes you amaze
  me. You are absolutely right. I have some pieces and I am convinced that they
  would form a puzzle the solution of which would be interesting to us, but how
  or where they fit in, I frankly don't know. You have the facts so far."</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Peter replied.</p>

  <p>"You have heard of Sirdeller?"</p>

  <p>"You mean the Sirdeller?" Peter asked.</p>

  <p>"Naturally. I mean the man whose very movements sway the money markets of
  the world, the man who could, if he chose, ruin any nation, make war
  impossible; who could if he had ten more years of life and was allowed to
  live, draw to himself and his own following the entire wealth of the
  universe."</p>

  <p>"Very eloquent," Peter remarked. "We'll take the rest for granted."</p>

  <p>"Then," Sogrange continued, "you have probably also heard of Don Pedro,
  Prince of Marsine, one time Pretender to the Throne of Spain?"</p>

  <p>"Quite a striking figure in European politics," Peter assented, quickly.
  "He is suspected of radical proclivities, and is still, it is rumored, an
  active plotter against the existing monarchy."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Sogrange said. "Now listen carefully. Four months ago,
  Sirdeller was living at the Golden Villa, near Nice. He was visited more than
  once by Marsine, introduced by the Count von Hern. The result of those visits
  was a long series of cablegrams to certain great engineering firms in
  America. Almost immediately, the salvage of the Maine was started. It is a
  matter of common report that the entire cost of these works is being
  undertaken by Sirdeller."</p>

  <p>"Now," Peter murmured, "you are really beginning to interest me."</p>

  <p>"This week," Sogrange went on, "it is expected that the result of the
  salvage works will be made known. That is to say, it is highly possible that
  the question of whether the Maine was blown up from outside or inside, will
  be settled once and for all. This week, mind, Baron. Now see what happens.
  Sirdeller returns to America. The Count von Hern and Prince Marsine come to
  America. The Duchesse della Nermino comes to America. The Duchesse, Sirdeller
  and Marsine are upon this steamer. The Count von Hern travels by the
  Lusitania only because it was reported that Sirdeller at the last minute
  changed his mind and was traveling by that boat. Mix these things up in your
  brain&mdash;the conjurer's hat, let us call it," Sogrange concluded, laying
  his hand upon Peter's arm, "Sirdeller, the Duchesse, Von Hern, Marsine, the
  raising of the Maine&mdash;mix them up and what sort of an omelette
  appears?"</p>

  <p>Peter whistled softly.</p>

  <p>"No wonder," he said, "that you couldn't make the pieces of the puzzle
  fit. Tell me more about the Duchesse?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange considered for a moment.</p>

  <p>"The principal thing about her which links her with the present
  situation," he explained, "is that she was living in Cuba at the time of the
  Maine disaster, married to a rich Cuban."</p>

  <p>The affair was suddenly illuminated by the searchlight of romance. Peter,
  for the first time, saw not the light, but the possibility of it.</p>

  <p>"Marsine has been living in Germany, has he not?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He is a personal friend of the Kaiser," Sogrange replied.</p>

  <p>They both looked up and listened to the crackling of the electricity above
  their heads.</p>

  <p>"I expect Bernadine is a little annoyed," Peter remarked.</p>

  <p>"It isn't pleasant to be out of the party," Sogrange agreed. "Nearly
  everybody, however, believed at the last moment that Sirdeller had
  transferred his passage to the Lusitania."</p>

  <p>"It's going to cost him an awful lot in marconigrams," Peter said. "By the
  bye, wouldn't it have been better for us to have traveled separately, and
  incognito?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange shrugged his shoulders slightly.</p>

  <p>"Von Hern has at least one man on board," he replied. "I do not think that
  we could possibly have escaped observation. Besides, I rather imagine that
  any move we are able to make in this matter must come before we reach Fire
  Island."</p>

  <p>"Have you any theory at all?" Peter asked.</p>

  <p>"Not the ghost of a one," Sogrange admitted. "One more fact, though, I
  forgot to mention. You may find it important. The Duchesse comes entirely
  against Von Hern's wishes. They have been on intimate terms for years, but
  for some reason or other he was exceedingly anxious that she should not take
  this voyage. She, on the other hand, seemed to have some equally strong
  reason for coming. The most useful piece of advice I could give you would be
  to cultivate her acquaintance."</p>

  <p>"The Duchesse&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Peter never finished his sentence. His companion drew him suddenly back
  into the shadow of a lifeboat.</p>

  <p>"Look!"</p>

  <p>A door had opened from lower down the deck, and a curious little
  procession was coming towards them. A man, burly and broad-shouldered, who
  had the air of a professional bully, walked by himself ahead. Two others of
  similar build walked a few steps behind. And between them a thin,
  insignificant figure, wrapped in an immense fur coat and using a strong
  walking stick, came slowly along the deck. It was like a procession of prison
  warders guarding a murderer, or perhaps a nerve-racked royal personage moving
  the end of his days in the midst of enemies. With halting steps the little
  old man came shambling along. He looked neither to the left nor to the right.
  His eyes were fixed and yet unseeing, his features were pale and bony. There
  was no gleam of life, not even in the stone-cold eyes. Like some machine-made
  man of a new and physically degenerate age, he took his exercise under the
  eye of his doctor, a strange and miserable-looking object.</p>

  <p>"There goes Sirdeller," Sogrange whispered. "Look at him&mdash;the man
  whose might is greater than any emperor's. There is no haven in the universe
  to which he does not hold the key. Look at him&mdash;master of the
  world!"</p>

  <p>Peter shivered. There was something depressing in the sight of that
  mournful procession.</p>

  <p>"He neither smokes nor drinks," Sogrange continued. "Women, as a sex, do
  not exist for him. His religion is a doubting Calvinism. He has a doctor and
  a clergyman always by his side to inject life and hope if they can. Look at
  him well, my friend. He represents a great moral lesson."</p>

  <p>"Thanks!" Peter replied. "I am going to take the taste of him out of my
  mouth with a whiskey and soda. Afterwards, I'm for the Duchesse."</p>

  <p>But the Duchesse, apparently, was not for Peter. He found her in the
  music-room with several of the little Marconi missives spread out before her,
  and she cut him dead. Peter, however, was a brave man, and skilled at the
  game of bluff. So he stopped by her side and without any preamble addressed
  her.</p>

  <p>"Duchesse," he said, "you are a woman of perceptions. Which do you
  believe, then, in your heart to be the more trustworthy&mdash;the Count von
  Hern or I?"</p>

  <p>She simply stared at him. He continued promptly.</p>

  <p>"You have received your warning, I see."</p>

  <p>"From whom?"</p>

  <p>"From the Count von Hern. Why believe what he says? He may be a friend of
  yours&mdash;he may be a dear friend&mdash;but in your heart you know that he
  is both unscrupulous and selfish. Why accept his word and distrust me? I, at
  least, am honest."</p>

  <p>She raised her eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Honest?" she repeated. "Whose word have I for that save your own? And
  what concern is it of mine if you possess every one of the bourgeois
  qualities in the world? You are presuming, sir."</p>

  <p>"My friend Sogrange will tell you that I am to be trusted," Peter
  persisted.</p>

  <p>"I see no reason why I should trouble myself about your personal
  characteristics," she replied, coldly. "They do not interest me."</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, Duchesse," Peter continued, fencing wildly, "you have
  never in your life been more in need of any one's services than you are of
  mine."</p>

  <p>The conflict was uneven. The Duchesse was a nervous, highly strung woman.
  The calm assurance of Peter's manner oppressed her with a sense of his
  mastery. She sank back upon the couch from which she had arisen.</p>

  <p>"I wish you would tell me what you mean," she said. "You have no right to
  talk to me in this fashion. What have you to do with my affairs?"</p>

  <p>"I have as much to do with them as the Count von Hem," Peter insisted,
  boldly.</p>

  <p>"I have known the Count von Hern," she answered, "for very many years. You
  have been a shipboard acquaintance of mine for a few hours."</p>

  <p>"If you have known the Count von Hern for many years," Peter asserted,
  "you have found out by this time that he is an absolutely untrustworthy
  person."</p>

  <p>"Supposing he is," she said, "will you tell me what concern it is of
  yours? Do you suppose for one moment that I am likely to discuss my private
  affairs with a perfect stranger?"</p>

  <p>"You have no private affairs," Peter declared, sternly. "They are the
  affairs of a nation."</p>

  <p>She glanced at him with a little shiver.</p>

  <p>From that moment he felt that he was gaining ground. She looked around the
  room. It was still filled, but in their corner they were almost
  unobserved.</p>

  <p>"How much do you know?" she asked in a low tone which shook with
  passion.</p>

  <p>Peter smiled enigmatically.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps more, even, than you, Duchesse," he replied. "I should like to be
  your friend. You need one&mdash;you know that."</p>

  <p>She rose abruptly to her feet.</p>

  <p>"For to-night it is enough," she declared, wrapping her fur cloak around
  her. "You may talk to me to-morrow, Baron. I must think. If you desire really
  to be my friend, there is, perhaps, one service which I may require of you.
  But to-night, no!"</p>

  <p>Peter stood aside and allowed her to step past him. He was perfectly
  content with the progress he had made. Her farewell salute was by no means
  ungracious. As soon as she was out of sight, he returned to the couch where
  she had been sitting. She had taken away the marconigrams, but she had left
  upon the floor several copies of the New York Herald. He took them up and
  read them carefully through. The last one he found particularly interesting,
  so much so that he folded it up, placed it in his coat pocket, and went off
  to look for Sogrange, whom he found at last in the saloon, watching a noisy
  game of "Up Jenkins!" Peter sank upon the cushioned seat by his side.</p>

  <p>"You were right," he remarked. "Bernadine has been busy."</p>

  <p>Sogrange smiled.</p>

  <p>"I trust," he said, "that the Duchesse is not proving faithless?"</p>

  <p>"So far," Peter replied, "I have kept my end up. Tomorrow will be the
  test. Bernadine had filled her with caution. She thinks that I know
  everything&mdash;whatever everything may be. Unless I can discover a little
  more than I do now, to-morrow is going to be an exceedingly awkward day for
  me."</p>

  <p>"There is every prospect of your acquiring a great deal of valuable
  information before then," Sogrange declared. "Sit tight, my friend. Something
  is going to happen."</p>

  <p>On the threshold of the saloon, ushered in by one of the stewards, a tall,
  powerful-looking man, with a square, well-trimmed black beard, was standing
  looking around as though in search of some one. The steward pointed out, with
  an unmistakable movement of his head, Peter and Sogrange. The man approached
  and took the next table.</p>

  <p>"Steward," he directed, "bring me a glass of Vermouth and some
  dominoes."</p>

  <p>Peter's eyes were suddenly bright. Sogrange touched his foot under the
  table and whispered a word of warning. The dominoes were brought. The
  newcomer arranged them as though for a game. Then he calmly withdrew the
  double-four and laid it before Sogrange.</p>

  <p>"It has been my misfortune, Marquis," he said, "never to have made your
  acquaintance, although our mutual friends are many, and I think I may say
  that I have the right to claim a certain amount of consideration from you and
  your associates. You know me?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly, Prince," Sogrange replied. "I am charmed. Permit me to present
  my friend, the Baron de Grost."</p>

  <p>The newcomer bowed and glanced a little nervously around.</p>

  <p>"You will permit me," he begged. "I travel incognito. I have lived so long
  in England that I have permitted myself the name of an Englishman. I am
  traveling under the name of Mr. James Fanshawe."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Fanshawe, by all means," Sogrange agreed. "In the
  meantime&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I claim my rights as a corresponding member of the Double-Four," the
  newcomer declared. "My friend the Count von Hern finds menace to certain
  plans of ours in your presence upon this steamer. Unknown to him, I come to
  you openly. I claim your aid, not your enmity."</p>

  <p>"Let us understand one another clearly," Sogrange said. "You claim our aid
  in what?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Fanshawe glanced around the saloon and lowered his voice.</p>

  <p>"I claim your aid towards the overthrowing of the usurping House of
  Brangaza and the restoration to power in Spain of my own line."</p>

  <p>Sogrange was silent for several moments. Peter was leaning forward in his
  place, deeply interested. Decidedly, this American trip seemed destined to
  lead towards events!</p>

  <p>"Our active aid towards such an end," Sogrange said at last, "is
  impossible. The Society of the Double-Four does not interfere in the domestic
  policy of other nations for the sake of individual members."</p>

  <p>"Then let me ask you why I find you upon this steamer?" Mr. Fanshawe
  demanded, in a tone of suppressed excitement. "Is it for the sea voyage that
  you and your friend the Baron de Grost cross the Atlantic this particular
  week, on the same steamer as myself, as Mr. Sirdeller, and&mdash;and the
  Duchesse? One does not believe in such coincidences! One is driven to
  conclude that it is your intention to interfere."</p>

  <p>"The affair almost demands our interference," Sogrange replied, smoothly.
  "With every due respect to you, Prince, there are great interests involved in
  this move of yours."</p>

  <p>The Prince was a big man, but for all his large features and bearded face
  his expression was the expression of a peevish and passionate child. He
  controlled himself with an effort.</p>

  <p>"Marquis," he said, "this is necessary&mdash;I say that it is necessary
  that we conclude an alliance."</p>

  <p>Sogrange nodded approvingly.</p>

  <p>"It is well spoken," he said, "but remember&mdash;the Baron de Grost
  represents England and the English interests of our Society."</p>

  <p>The Prince of Marsine's face was not pleasant to look upon.</p>

  <p>"Forgive me if you are an Englishman by birth, Baron," he said, turning
  towards him, "but a more interfering nation in other people's affairs than
  England has never existed in the pages of history. She must have a finger in
  every pie. Bah!"</p>

  <p>Peter leaned over from his place.</p>

  <p>"What about Germany&mdash;Mr. Fanshawe?" he asked, with emphasis.</p>

  <p>The Prince tugged at his beard. He was a little nonplussed.</p>

  <p>"The Count von Hern," he confessed, "has been a good friend to me. The
  rulers of his country have always been hospitable and favorably inclined
  towards my family. The whole affair is of his design. I myself could scarcely
  have moved in it alone. One must reward one's helpers. There is no reason,
  however," he added, with a meaning glance at Peter, "why other helpers should
  not be admitted."</p>

  <p>"The reward which you offer to the Count von Hern," Peter remarked, "is of
  itself absolutely inimical to the interests of my country."</p>

  <p>"Listen!" the Prince demanded, tapping the table before him. "It is true
  that within a year I am pledged to reward the Count von Hern in certain
  fashion. It is not possible that you know the terms of our compact, but from
  your words it is possible that you have guessed. Very well. Accept this from
  me. Remain neutral now, allow this matter to proceed to its natural
  conclusion, let your government address representations to me when the time
  comes, adopting a bold front, and I promise that I will obey them. It will
  not be my fault that I am compelled to disappoint the Count von Hern. My
  seaboard would be at the mercy of your fleet. Superior force must be
  obeyed."</p>

  <p>"It is a matter, this," Sogrange said, "for discussion between my friend
  and me. I think that you will find that we are neither of us unreasonable. In
  short, Prince, I see no insuperable reason why we should not come to
  terms."</p>

  <p>"You encourage me," the Prince declared, in a gratified tone. "Do not
  believe, Marquis, that I am actuated in this matter wholly by motives of
  personal ambition. No, it is not so. A great desire has burned always in my
  heart, but it is not that alone which moves me. I assure you that of my
  certain knowledge Spain is honeycombed&mdash;is rotten with treason. A
  revolution is a certainty. How much better that that revolution should be
  conducted in a dignified manner; that I, with my reputation for democracy
  which I have carefully kept before the eyes of my people, should be elected
  President of the new Spanish Republic, even if it is the gold of the American
  which places me there. In a year or two, what may happen who can say? This
  craving for a republic is but a passing dream. Spain, at heart, is
  monarchial. She will be led back to the light. It is but a short step from
  the president's chair to the throne."</p>

  <p>Sogrange and his companion sat quite still. They avoided looking at each
  other.</p>

  <p>"There is one thing more," the Prince continued, dropping his voice, as
  if, even at that distance, he feared the man of whom he spoke. "I shall not
  inform the Count von Hern of our conversation. It is not necessary, and,
  between ourselves, the Count is jealous. He sends me message after message
  that I remain in my stateroom, that I seek no interview with Sirdeller, that
  I watch only. He is too much of the spy&mdash;the Count von Hern. He does not
  understand that code of honor, relying upon which I open my heart to
  you."</p>

  <p>"You have done your cause no harm," Sogrange assured him, with subtle
  sarcasm. "We come now to the Duchesse."</p>

  <p>The Prince leaned towards him. It was just at this moment that a steward
  entered with a marconigram, which he presented to the Prince. The latter tore
  it open, glanced it through, and gave vent to a little exclamation. The
  fingers which held the missive trembled. His eyes blazed with excitement. He
  was absolutely unable to control his feelings.</p>

  <p>"My two friends," he cried, in a tone broken with emotion, "it is you
  first who shall hear the news! This message has just arrived. Sirdeller will
  have received its duplicate. The final report of the works in Havana Harbor
  will await us on our arrival in New York, but the substance of it is this.
  The Maine was sunk by a torpedo, discharged at close quarters underneath her
  magazine. Gentlemen, the House of Brangaza is ruined!"</p>

  <p>There was a breathless silence.</p>

  <p>"Your information is genuine?" Sogrange asked, softly.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," the Prince replied. "I have been expecting this
  message. I shall cable to Von Hern. We are still in communication. He may not
  have heard."</p>

  <p>"We were about to speak of the Duchesse," Peter reminded him.</p>

  <p>The Prince shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Another time," he declared. "Another time."</p>

  <p>He hurried away. It was already half past ten and the saloon was almost
  empty. The steward came up to them.</p>

  <p>"The saloon is being closed for the night, sir," he announced.</p>

  <p>"Let us go on deck," Peter suggested.</p>

  <p>They found their way up on to the windward side of the promenade, which
  was absolutely deserted. Far away in front of them now were the disappearing
  lights of the Lusitania. The wind roared by as the great steamer rose and
  fell on the black stretch of waters. Peter stood very near to his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Sogrange," he said, "the affair is clear now save for one
  thing."</p>

  <p>"You mean Sirdeller's motives?"</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Peter answered. "An hour ago, I came across the explanation
  of these. The one thing I will tell you afterwards. Now listen. Sirdeller
  came abroad last year for twelve months' travel. He took a great house in San
  Sebastian."</p>

  <p>"Where did you hear this?" Sogrange asked.</p>

  <p>"I read the story in the New York Herald," Peter continued. "It is grossly
  exaggerated, of course, but this is the substance of it. Sirdeller and his
  suite were stopped upon the Spanish frontier and treated in an abominable
  fashion by the customs officers. He was forced to pay a very large sum,
  unjustly I should think. He paid under protest, appealed to the authorities,
  with no result. At San Sebastian he was robbed right and left, his privacy
  intruded upon. In short, he took a violent dislike and hatred to the country
  and every one concerned in it. He moved with his entire suite to Nice, to the
  Golden Villa. There he expressed himself freely concerning Spain and her
  Government. Count von Hern heard of it and presented Marsine. The plot was,
  without doubt, Bernadine's. Can't you imagine how he would put it? 'A
  revolution,' he would tell Sirdeller, 'is imminent in Spain. Here is the new
  President of the Republic. Money is no more to you than water. You are a
  patriotic American. Have you forgotten that a warship of your country with
  six hundred of her devoted citizens was sent to the bottom by the treachery
  of one of this effete race? The war was an inefficient revenge. The country
  still flourishes. It is for you to avenge America. With money Marsine can
  establish a republic in Spain within twenty-four hours.' Sirdeller hesitates.
  He would point out that it had never been proved that the destruction of the
  Maine was really due to Spanish treachery. It is the idea of a business man
  which followed. He, at his own expense, would raise the Maine. If it were
  true that the explosion occurred from outside, he would find the money. You
  see, the message has arrived. After all these years the sea has given up its
  secret. Marsine will return to Spain with an unlimited credit behind him. The
  House of Brangaza will crumble up like a pack of cards."</p>

  <p>Sogrange looked out into the darkness. Perhaps he saw in that great black
  gulf the pictures of these happenings which his companion had prophesied.
  Perhaps, for a moment, he saw the panorama of a city in flames, the passing
  of a great country under the thrall of these new ideas. At any rate, he
  turned abruptly away from the side of the vessel, and taking Peter's arm,
  walked slowly down the deck.</p>

  <p>"You have solved the puzzle, Baron," he said, gravely. "Now tell me the
  one thing. Your story seems to dovetail everywhere."</p>

  <p>"The one thing," Peter said, "is connected with the Duchesse. It was she,
  of her own will, who decided to come to America. I believe that, but for her
  coming, Bernadine and the Prince would have waited in their own country.
  Money can flash from America to England over the wires. It does not need to
  be fetched. They have still one fear. It is connected with the Duchesse. Let
  me think."</p>

  <p>They walked up and down the deck. The lights were extinguished one by one,
  except in the smoking-room. A strange breed of sailors from the lower deck
  came up with mops and buckets. The wind changed its quarter and the great
  ship began to roll. Peter stopped abruptly.</p>

  <p>"I find this motion most unpleasant," he said. "I am going to bed.
  To-night I cannot think. To-morrow, I promise you, we will solve this.
  Hush!"</p>

  <p>He held out his hand and drew his companion back into the shadow of a
  lifeboat. A tall figure was approaching them along the deck. As he passed the
  little ray of light thrown out from the smoking-room, the man's features were
  clearly visible. It was the Prince. He was walking like one absorbed in
  thought. His eyes were set like a sleep-walker's. With one hand he
  gesticulated. The fingers of the other were twitching all the time. His head
  was lifted to the skies. There was something in his face which redeemed it
  from its disfiguring petulance.</p>

  <p>"It is the man who dreams of power," Peter whispered. "It is one of his
  best moments, this. He forgets the vulgar means by which he intends to rise.
  He thinks only of himself, the dictator, king, perhaps emperor. He is of the
  breed of egoists."</p>

  <p>Again and again the Prince passed, manifestly unconscious even of his
  whereabouts. Peter and Sogrange crept away unseen to their staterooms.</p>

  <p>In many respects the room resembled a miniature court of justice. The
  principal sitting-room of the royal suite, which was the chief glory of the
  Adriatic, had been stripped of every superfluous article of furniture or
  embellishment. Curtains had been removed, all evidences of luxury disposed
  of. Temporarily the apartment had been transformed into a bare, cheerless
  place. Seated on a high chair, with his back to the wall, was Sirdeller. At
  his right hand was a small table, on which stood a glass of milk, a phial, a
  stethoscope. Behind his doctor. At his left hand a smooth-faced, silent young
  man&mdash;his secretary. Before him stood the Duchesse, Peter and Sogrange.
  Guarding the door was one of the watchmen, who, from his great physique,
  might well have been a policeman out of livery. Sirdeller himself, in the
  clear light which streamed through the large window, seemed more aged and
  shrunken than ever. His eyes were deep set. No tinge of color was visible in
  his cheeks. His chin protruded, his shaggy gray eyebrows gave him an unkempt
  appearance. He wore a black velvet gown, a strangely cut black morning coat
  and trousers, felt slippers, and his hands were clasped upon a stout ash
  walking-stick. He eyed the newcomers keenly but without expression.</p>

  <p>"The lady may sit," he said.</p>

  <p>He spoke almost in an undertone, as though anxious to avoid the fatigue of
  words. The guardian of the door placed a chair, into which the Duchesse
  subsided. Sirdeller held his right hand towards his doctor, who felt his
  pulse. All the time Sirdeller watched him, his lips a little parted, a world
  of hungry excitement in his eyes. The doctor closed his watch with a snap and
  whispered something in Sirdeller's ear, apparently reassuring.</p>

  <p>"I will hear this story," Sirdeller announced. "In two minutes every one
  must leave. If it takes longer, it must remain unfinished."</p>

  <p>Peter spoke up briskly.</p>

  <p>"The story is this," he began. "You have promised to assist the Prince of
  Marsine to transform Spain into a republic, providing the salvage operations
  on the Maine prove that that ship was destroyed from outside. The salvage
  operations have been conducted at your expense and finished. It has been
  proved that the Maine was destroyed by a mine or torpedo from the outside.
  Therefore, on the assumption that it was the treacherous deed of a Spaniard
  or Cuban imagining himself to be a patriot, you are prepared to carry out
  your undertaking and supply the Prince of Marsine with means to overthrow the
  Kingdom of Spain."</p>

  <p>Peter paused. The figure on the chair remained motionless. No flicker of
  intelligence or interest disturbed the calm of his features. It was a silence
  almost unnatural. "I have brought the Duchesse here," Peter continued, "to
  tell you the truth as to the Maine disaster."</p>

  <p>Not even then was there the slightest alteration in those ashen gray
  features. The Duchesse looked up. She had the air of one only too eager to
  speak and finish.</p>

  <p>"In those days," she said, "I was the wife of a rich Cuban gentleman,
  whose name I withhold. The American officers on board the Maine used to visit
  at our house. My husband was jealous; perhaps he had cause."</p>

  <p>The Duchesse paused. Even though the light of tragedy and romance side by
  side seemed suddenly to creep into the room, Sirdeller listened as one come
  back from a dead world.</p>

  <p>"One night," the Duchesse went on, "my husband's suspicions were changed
  into knowledge. He came home unexpectedly. The American&mdash;the
  officer&mdash;I loved him&mdash;he was there on the balcony with me. My
  husband said nothing. The officer returned to the ship. That night my husband
  came into my room. He bent over my bed. 'It is not you,' he whispered, 'whom
  I shall destroy, for the pain of death is short. Anguish of mind may live.
  To-night six hundred ghosts may hang about your pillow!'"</p>

  <p>Her voice broke. There was something grim and unnatural in that curious
  stillness. Even the secretary was at last breathing a little faster. The
  watchman at the door was leaning forward. Sirdeller simply moved his hand to
  the doctor, who held up his finger while he felt the pulse. The beat of his
  watch seemed to sound through the unnatural silence. In a minute he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"The lady may proceed," he announced.</p>

  <p>"My husband," the Duchesse continued, "was an officer in charge of the
  Mines and Ordnance Department. He went out that night in a small boat, after
  a visit to the strong house. No soul has ever seen or heard of him since, or
  his boat. It is only I who know!"</p>

  <p>Her voice died away. Sirdeller stretched out his hand and very
  deliberately drank a tablespoonful or two of his milk.</p>

  <p>"I believe the lady's story," he declared. "The Marsine affair is
  finished. Let no one be admitted to have speech with me again upon this
  subject."</p>

  <p>He had half turned towards his secretary. The young man bowed. The doctor
  pointed towards the door. The Duchesse, Peter and Sogrange filed slowly out.
  In the bright sunlight the Duchesse burst into a peal of hysterical laughter.
  Even Peter felt, for a moment, unnerved. Suddenly he, too, laughed.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that you and I had better get out of the way,
  Sogrange, when the Count von Hern meets us at New York!"</p>

  <h2>X. THE AFFAIR or AN ALIEN SOCIETY</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Sep 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">Sogrange and Peter, Baron de Grost, standing upon the
  threshold of their hotel, gazed out upon New York and liked the look of it.
  They had landed from the steamer a few hours before, had already enjoyed the
  luxury of a bath, a visit to an American barber's, and a genuine
  cocktail.</p>

  <p>"I see no reason," Sogrange declared, "why we should not take a week's
  holiday."</p>

  <p>Peter, glancing up into the blue sky and down into the faces of the
  well-dressed and beautiful women who were streaming up Fifth Avenue, was
  wholly of the same mind.</p>

  <p>"If we return by this afternoon's steamer," he remarked, "we shall have
  Bernadine for a fellow passenger. Bernadine is annoyed with us just now. I
  must confess that I should feel more at my ease with a few thousand miles of
  the Atlantic between us."</p>

  <p>"Let it be so," Sogrange assented. "We will explore this marvelous city.
  Never," he added, taking his companion's arm, "did I expect to see such women
  save in my own, the mistress of all cities. So chic, my dear Baron, and such
  a carriage! We will lunch at one of the fashionable restaurants and drive in
  the Park afterwards. First of all, however, we must take a stroll along this
  wonderful Fifth Avenue."</p>

  <p>The two men spent a morning after their own hearts. They lunched
  astonishingly well at Sherry's and drove afterwards in Central Park. When
  they returned to the hotel, Sogrange was in excellent spirits.</p>

  <p>"I feel, my friend," he announced, "that we are going to have a very
  pleasant and, in some respects, a unique week. To meet friends and
  acquaintances, everywhere, as one must do in every capital in Europe, is, of
  course, pleasant, but there is a monotony about it from which one is glad
  sometimes to escape. We lunch here and we promenade in the places frequented
  by those of a similar station to our own, and behold! we know no one. We are
  lookers on. Perhaps for a long time it might gall. For a brief period there
  is a restfulness about it which pleases me."</p>

  <p>"I should have liked," Peter murmured, "an introduction to the lady in the
  blue hat."</p>

  <p>"You are a gregarious animal," Sogrange declared. "You do not understand
  the pleasures of a little comparative isolation with an intellectual
  companion such as myself... What the devil is the meaning of this!"</p>

  <p>They had reached their sitting-room and upon a small round table stood a
  great collection of cards and notes. Sogrange took them up helplessly, one
  after the other, reading the names aloud and letting them fall through his
  fingers. Some were known to him, some were not. He began to open the notes.
  In effect they were all the same&mdash;what evening would the Marquis de
  Sogrange and his distinguished friend care to dine, lunch, yacht, golf,
  shoot, go to the opera, join a theatre party? Of what clubs would they care
  to become members? What kind of hospitality would be most acceptable?</p>

  <p>Sogrange sank into a chair.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he exclaimed, "they all have to be answered&mdash;that
  collection there! The visits have to be returned. It is magnificent, this
  hospitality, but what can one do?"</p>

  <p>Peter looked at the pile of correspondence upon which Sogrange's inroad,
  indeed, seemed to have had but little effect.</p>

  <p>"One could engage a secretary, of course," he suggested, doubtfully. "But
  the visits! Our week's holiday is gone."</p>

  <p>"Not at all," Sogrange replied. "I have an idea."</p>

  <p>The telephone bell rang. Peter took up the receiver and listened for a
  moment. He turned to Sogrange, still holding it in his hand.</p>

  <p>"You will be pleased, also, to hear," he announced, "that there are half a
  dozen reporters downstairs waiting to interview [Transcriber's note: word
  missing]."</p>

  <p>Sogrange received the information with interest.</p>

  <p>"Have them sent up at once," he directed, "every one of them."</p>

  <p>"What, all at the same time?" Peter asked.</p>

  <p>"All at the same time it must be," Sogrange answered. "Give them to
  understand that it is an affair of five minutes only."</p>

  <p>They came trooping in. Sogrange welcomed them cordially.</p>

  <p>"My friend, the Baron de Grost," he explained, indicating Peter. "I am the
  Marquis de Sogrange. Let us know what we can do to serve you."</p>

  <p>One of the men stepped forward.</p>

  <p>"Very glad to meet you, Marquis, and you, Baron," he said. "I won't bother
  you with any introductions, but I and the company here represent the Press of
  New York. We should like some information for our papers as to the object of
  your visit here and the probable length of your stay."</p>

  <p>Sogrange extended his hands.</p>

  <p>"My dear friend," he exclaimed, "the object of our visit was, I thought,
  already well known. We are on our way to Mexico. We leave to-night. My friend
  the Baron is, as you know, a financier. I, too, have a little money to
  invest. We are going out to meet some business acquaintances with a view to
  inspecting some mining properties. That is absolutely all I can tell you. You
  can understand, of course, that fuller information would be impossible."</p>

  <p>"Why, that's quite natural, Marquis," the spokesman of the reporters
  replied. "We don't like the idea of your hustling out of New York like this,
  though?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"It is unavoidable," he declared. "We are relying upon you, gentlemen, to
  publish the fact, because you will see," he added, pointing to the table,
  "that we have been the recipients of a great many civilities, which it is
  impossible for us to acknowledge properly. If it will give you any pleasure
  to see us upon our return, you will be very welcome. In the meantime, you
  will understand our haste."</p>

  <p>There were a few more civilities and the representatives of the Press took
  their departure. Peter looked at his companion doubtfully, as Sogrange
  returned from showing them out.</p>

  <p>"I suppose this means that we have to catch to-day's steamer, after all?"
  he remarked.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," Sogrange answered. "I have a plan. We will leave for
  the Southern depot, wherever it may be. Afterwards, you shall use that
  wonderful skill of yours, of which I have heard so much, to effect some
  slight change in our appearance. We will then go to another hotel, in another
  quarter of New York, and take our week's holiday incognito. What do you think
  of that for an idea?"</p>

  <p>"Not much," Peter replied. "It isn't so easy to dodge the newspapers and
  the Press in this country. Besides, although I could manage myself very well,
  you would be an exceedingly awkward subject. Your tall and elegant figure,
  your aquiline nose, the shapeliness of your hands and feet, give you a
  distinction which I should find it hard to conceal."</p>

  <p>Sogrange smiled.</p>

  <p>"You are a remarkably observant fellow, Baron. I quite appreciate your
  difficulty. Still, with a club foot, eh, and spectacles instead of my
  eyeglass&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Oh, no doubt, something could be managed," Peter interrupted. "You're
  really in earnest about this, are you?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," Sogrange declared. "Come here!"</p>

  <p>He drew Peter to the window. They were on the twelfth story, and to a
  European there was something magnificent in that tangled mass of buildings
  threaded by the elevated railway, with its screaming trains, the clearness of
  the atmosphere, and in the white streets below, like polished belts through
  which the swarms of people streamed like insects.</p>

  <p>"Imagine it all lit up!" Sogrange exclaimed. "The sky-signs all ablaze,
  the flashing of fire from those cable wires, the lights glittering from those
  tall buildings! This is a wonderful place, Baron. We must see it. Ring for
  the bill. Order one of those magnificent omnibuses. Press the button, too,
  for the personage whom they call the valet. Perhaps, with a little gentle
  persuasion, he could be induced to pack our clothes."</p>

  <p>With his finger upon the hell, Peter hesitated. He, too, loved adventures,
  but the gloom of a presentiment had momentarily depressed him.</p>

  <p>"We are marked men, remember, Sogrange," he said. "An escapade of this
  sort means a certain amount of risk, even in New York."</p>

  <p>Sogrange laughed.</p>

  <p>"Bernadine caught the midday steamer! We have no enemies here that I know
  of."</p>

  <p>Peter pressed the button. An hour or so later, the Marquis de Sogrange and
  Peter, Baron de Grost, took their leave of New York.</p>

  <p>They chose a hotel on Broadway, within a stone's throw of Rector's. Peter,
  with whitened hair, gold-rimmed spectacles, a slouch hat and a fur coat,
  passed easily enough for an English maker of electrical instruments; while
  Sogrange, shabbier, and in ready-made American clothes, was transformed into
  a Canadian having some connection with the theatrical business. They plunged
  into the heart of New York life, and found the whole thing like a tonic. The
  intense vitality of the people, the pandemonium of Broadway at midnight, with
  its flaming illuminations, its eager crowd, its inimitable restlessness,
  fascinated them both. Sogrange, indeed, remembering the decadent languor of
  the crowds of pleasure seekers thronging his own boulevards, was never weary
  of watching these men and women. They passed from the streets to the
  restaurants, from the restaurants to the theatre, out into the streets again,
  back to the restaurants, and once more into the streets. Sogrange was like a
  glutton. The mention of bed was hateful to him. For three days they existed
  without a moment's boredom.</p>

  <p>On the fourth evening, Peter found Sogrange deep in conversation with the
  head porter. In a few minutes he led Peter away to one of the bars where they
  usually took their cocktail.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he announced, "to-night I have a treat for you. So far we
  have looked on at the external night life of New York. Wonderful and
  thrilling it has been, too. But there is the underneath, also. Why not? There
  is a vast polyglot population here, full of energy said life. A criminal
  class exists as a matter of course. To-night we make our bow to it."</p>

  <p>"And by what means?" Peter inquired.</p>

  <p>"Our friend the hall-porter," Sogrange continued, "has given me the card
  of an ex-detective who will be our escort. He calls for us to-night, or
  rather to-morrow morning, at one o'clock. Then behold! the wand is waved, the
  land of adventures opens before us."</p>

  <p>Peter grunted.</p>

  <p>"I don't want to damp your enthusiasm, my Canadian friend," he said, "but
  the sort of adventures you may meet with to-night are scarcely likely to fire
  your romantic nature. I know a little about what they call this underneath
  world in New York. It will probably resolve itself into a visit to Chinatown,
  where we shall find the usual dummies taking opium and quite prepared to talk
  about it for the usual tip. After that we shall visit a few low dancing
  halls, be shown the scene of several murders, and the thing is done."</p>

  <p>"You are a cynic," Sogrange declared. "You would throw cold water upon any
  enterprise. Anyway, our detective is coming. We must make use of him, for I
  have engaged to pay him twenty-five dollars."</p>

  <p>"We'll go where you like," Peter assented, "so long as we dine on a roof
  garden. This beastly fur coat keeps me in a state of chronic
  perspiration."</p>

  <p>"Never mind," Sogrange said, consolingly, "it's most effective. A roof
  garden, by all means."</p>

  <p>"And recollect," Peter insisted, "I bar Chinatown. We've both of us seen
  the real thing, and there's nothing real about what they show you here."</p>

  <p>"Chinatown is erased from our program," Sogrange agreed. "We go now to
  dine. Remind me, Baron, that I inquire for those strange dishes of which one
  hears Terrapin, Canvas-backed Duck, Green Corn, Strawberry Shortcake."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled grimly.</p>

  <p>"How like a Frenchman," he exclaimed, "to take no account of seasons!
  Never mind, Marquis, you shall give your order and I will sketch the waiter's
  face. By the bye, if you're in earnest about this expedition to-night, put
  your revolver into your pocket."</p>

  <p>"But we 're going with an ex-detective," Sogrange replied.</p>

  <p>"One never knows," Peter said, carelessly.</p>

  <p>They dined close to the stone palisading of one of New York's most famous
  roof gardens. Sogrange ordered an immense dinner but spent most of his time
  gazing downwards. They were higher up than at the hotel and they could see
  across the tangled maze of lights even to the river, across which the great
  ferry-boats were speeding all the while&mdash;huge creatures of streaming
  fire and whistling sirens. The air where they sat was pure and crisp. There
  was no fog, no smoke, to cloud the almost crystalline clearness of the
  night.</p>

  <p>"Baron," Sogrange declared, "if I had lived in this city I should have
  been a different man. No wonder the people are all conquering."</p>

  <p>"Too much electricity in the air for me," Peter answered. "I like a little
  repose. I can't think where these people find it."</p>

  <p>"One hopes," Sogrange murmured, "that before they progress any further in
  utilitarianism, they will find some artist, one of themselves, to express all
  this."</p>

  <p>"In the meantime," Peter interrupted, "the waiter would like to know what
  we are going to drink. I've eaten such a confounded jumble of things of your
  ordering that I should like some champagne."</p>

  <p>"Who shall say that I am not generous!" Sogrange replied, taking up the
  wine carte. "Champagne it shall be. We need something to nerve us for our
  adventures."</p>

  <p>Peter leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"Sogrange," he whispered, "for the last twenty-four hours I have had some
  doubts as to the success of our little enterprise. It has occurred to me more
  than once that we are being shadowed."</p>

  <p>Sogrange frowned.</p>

  <p>"I sometimes wonder," he remarked, "how a man of your suspicious nature
  ever acquired the reputation you undoubtedly enjoy."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is because of my suspicious nature," Peter said. "There is a
  man staying in our hotel whom we are beginning to see quite a great deal of.
  He was talking to the head porter a few minutes before you this afternoon. He
  supped at the same restaurant last night. He is dining now three places
  behind you to the right, with a young lady who has been making flagrant
  attempts at flirtation with me, notwithstanding my gray hairs."</p>

  <p>"Your reputation, my dear Peter," Sogrange murmured&mdash;</p>

  <p>"As a decoy," Peter interrupted, "the young lady's methods are too
  vigorous. She pretends to be terribly afraid of her companion, but it is
  entirely obvious that she is acting on his instructions. Of course, this may
  be a ruse of the reporters. On the other hand, I think it would be wise to
  abandon our little expedition to-night."</p>

  <p>Sogrange shook his head.</p>

  <p>"So far as I am concerned," he said, "I am committed to it."</p>

  <p>"In which case," Peter replied, "I am certainly committed to being your
  companion. The only question is whether one shall fall to the decoy and
  suffer oneself to be led in the direction her companion desires, or whether
  we shall go blundering into trouble on our own account with your friend the
  ex-detective."</p>

  <p>Sogrange glanced over his shoulder, leaned back in his chair for a moment,
  as though to look at the stars, and finally lit a cigarette.</p>

  <p>"There is a lack of subtlety about that young person, Baron," he declared,
  "which stifles one's suspicions. I suspect her to be merely one more victim
  to your undoubted charms. In the interests of Madame your wife, I shall take
  you away. The decoy shall weave her spells in vain."</p>

  <p>They paid their bill and departed a few minutes later. The man and the
  girl were also in the act of leaving. The former seemed to be having some
  dispute about the bill. The girl, standing with her back to him, scribbled a
  line upon a piece of paper, and, as Peter went by, pushed it into his hand
  with a little warning gesture. In the lift he opened it. The few penciled
  words contained nothing but an address: Number 15, 100th Street, East.</p>

  <p>"Lucky man!" Sogrange sighed.</p>

  <p>Peter made no remark, but he was thoughtful for the next hour or so.</p>

  <p>The ex-detective proved to be an individual of fairly obvious appearance,
  whose complexion and thirst indicated a very possible reason for his life of
  leisure. He heard with surprise that his patrons were not inclined to visit
  Chinatown, but he showed a laudable desire to fall in with their schemes,
  provided always that they included a reasonable number of visits to places
  where refreshment could be obtained. From first to last, the expedition was a
  disappointment. They visited various smoke-hung dancing halls, decorated for
  the most part with oleographs and cracked mirrors, in which sickly-Looking
  young men of unwholesome aspect were dancing with their feminine
  counterparts. The attitude of their guide was alone amusing.</p>

  <p>"Say, you want to be careful in here!" he would declare, in an awed tone,
  on entering one of these tawdry palaces. "Guess this is one of the toughest
  spots in New York City. You stick close to me and I'll make things all
  right."</p>

  <p>His method of making things all right was the same in every case. He would
  form a circle of disreputable-looking youths, for whose drinks Sogrange was
  called upon to pay. The attitude of these young men was more dejected than
  positively vicious. They showed not the slightest signs of any desire to make
  themselves unpleasant. Only once, when Sogrange incautiously displayed a gold
  watch, did the eyes of one or two of their number glisten. The ex-detective
  changed his place and whispered hoarsely in his patron's ear.</p>

  <p>"Say, don't you flash anything of that sort about here! That young cove
  right opposite to you is one of the best known sneak-thieves in the city.
  You're asking for trouble that way."</p>

  <p>"If he or any other of them want my watch," Sogrange answered calmly, "let
  them come and fetch it. However," he added, buttoning up his coat, "no doubt
  you are right. Is there anywhere else to take us?"</p>

  <p>The man hesitated.</p>

  <p>"There ain't much that you haven't seen," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Sogrange laughed softly as he rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"A sell, my dear friend," he said to Peter. "This terrible city keeps its
  real criminal class somewhere else rather than in the show places."</p>

  <p>A man who had been standing in the doorway, looking in for several
  moments, strolled up to them. Peter recognized him at once and touched
  Sogrange on the arm. The newcomer accosted them pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Say, you'll excuse my butting in," he began, "but I can see you're kind
  of disappointed. These suckers"&mdash;indicating the ex-detective&mdash;"talk
  a lot about what they're going to show you, and when they get you round it
  all amounts to nothing. This is the sort of thing they bring you to, as
  representing the wickedness of New York! That's so, Rastall, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>The ex-detective looked a little sheepish.</p>

  <p>"Yes, there ain't much more to be seen," he admitted. "Perhaps you'll take
  the job on if you think there is."</p>

  <p>"Well, I'd show the gentlemen something of a sight more interesting that
  this," the newcomer continued. "They don't want to sit down and drink with
  the scum of the earth."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Sogrange suggested, "this gentleman has something in his mind
  which he thinks would appeal to us. We have a motor car outside and we are
  out for adventures."</p>

  <p>"What sort of adventures?" the newcomer asked, bluntly.</p>

  <p>Sogrange shrugged his shoulders lightly.</p>

  <p>"We are lookers-on merely," he explained. "My friend and I have traveled a
  good deal. We have seen something of criminal life in Paris and London,
  Vienna and Budapest. I shall not break any confidence if I tell you that my
  friend is a writer, and material such as this is useful."</p>

  <p>The newcomer smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well," he exclaimed, "in a way, it's fortunate for you that I happened
  along! You come right with me and I'll show you something that very few other
  people in this city know of. Guess you'd better pay this fellow off," he
  added, indicating the ex-detective. "He's no more use to you."</p>

  <p>Sogrange and Peter exchanged questioning glances.</p>

  <p>"It is very kind of you, sir," Peter decided, "but for my part I have had
  enough for one evening."</p>

  <p>"Just as you like, of course," the other remarked, with studied
  unconcern.</p>

  <p>"What sort of place would it be?" Sogrange asked.</p>

  <p>The newcomer drew them on one side, although, as a matter of fact, every
  one else had already melted away.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever heard of the Secret Societies of New York?" he inquired.
  "Well, I guess you haven't, any way&mdash;not to know anything about them.
  Well, then, listen. There's a Society meets within a few steps of here, which
  has more to do with regulating the criminal classes of the city than any
  police establishment. There'll be a man there within an hour or so, who, to
  my knowledge, has committed seven murders. The police can't get him. They
  never will. He's under our protection."</p>

  <p>"May we visit such a place as you describe without danger?" Peter asked,
  calmly.</p>

  <p>"No!" the man answered. "There's danger in going anywhere, it seems to me,
  if it's worth while. So long as you keep a still tongue in your head and
  don't look about you too much, there's nothing will happen to you. If you get
  gassing a lot, you might tumble in for almost anything. Don't come unless you
  like. It's a chance for your friend, as he's a writer, but you'd best keep
  out of it if you're in any way nervous."</p>

  <p>"You said it was quite close?" Sogrange inquired.</p>

  <p>"Within a yard or two," the man replied. "It's right this way."</p>

  <p>They left the hall with their new escort. When they looked for their motor
  car, they found it had gone.</p>

  <p>"It don't do to keep them things waiting about round here," their new
  friend remarked, carelessly. "I guess I'll send you back to your hotel all
  right. Step this way."</p>

  <p>"By the bye, what street is this we are in?" Peter asked.</p>

  <p>"100th Street," the man answered.</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I'm a little superstitious about that number," he declared. "Is that an
  elevated railway there? I think we've had enough, Sogrange."</p>

  <p>Sogrange hesitated. They were standing now in front of a tall gloomy
  house, unkempt, with broken gate&mdash;a large but miserable-looking abode.
  The passers-by in the street were few. The whole character of the
  surroundings was squalid. The man pushed open the broken gate.</p>

  <p>"You cross the street right there to the elevated," he directed. "If you
  ain't coming, I'll bid you good-night."</p>

  <p>Once more they hesitated. Peter, perhaps, saw more than his companion. He
  saw the dark shapes lurking under the railway arch. He knew instinctively
  that they were in some sort of danger. And yet the love of adventure was on
  fire in his blood. His belief in himself was immense. He whispered to
  Sogrange.</p>

  <p>"I do not trust our guide," he said. "If you care to risk it, I am with
  you."</p>

  <p>"Mind the broken pavement," the man called out. "This ain't exactly an
  abode of luxury."</p>

  </div>

  <p>They climbed some broken steps. Their guide opened a door with a Yale key.
  The door swung to, after them, and they found themselves in darkness. There
  had been no light in the windows; there was no light, apparently, in the
  house. Their companion produced an electric torch from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"You had best follow me," he advised. "Our quarters face out the other
  way. We keep this end looking a little deserted."</p>

  <p>They passed through a swing door and everything was at once changed. A
  multitude of lamps hung from the ceiling, the floor was carpeted, the walls
  clean.</p>

  <p>"We don't go in for electric light," their guide explained, "as we try not
  to give the place away. We manage to keep it fairly comfortable, though."</p>

  <p>He pushed open the door and entered a somewhat gorgeously furnished salon.
  There were signs here of feminine occupation, an open piano, and the smell of
  cigarettes. Once more Peter hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Your friends seem to be in hiding," he remarked. "Personally, I am losing
  my curiosity."</p>

  <p>"Guess you won't have to wait very long," the man replied, with
  meaning.</p>

  <p>The room was suddenly invaded on all sides. Four doors, which were quite
  hidden by the pattern of the wall, had opened almost simultaneously, and at
  least a dozen men had entered. This time both Sogrange and Peter knew that
  they were face to face with the real thing. These were men who came silently
  in, no cigarette-stunted youths. Two of them were in evening dress; three or
  four had the appearance of prize fighters. In their countenances was one
  expression common to all&mdash;an air of quiet and conscious strength.</p>

  <p>A fair-headed man, in dinner jacket and black tie, became at once their
  spokesman. He was possessed of a very slight American accent, and he beamed
  at them through a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen," he said, "I am glad to meet you both."</p>

  <p>"Very kind of you, I'm sure," Sogrange answered. "Our friend here," he
  added, indicating their guide, "found us trying to gain a little insight into
  the more interesting part of New York life. He was kind enough to express a
  wish to introduce us to you."</p>

  <p>The man smiled. He looked very much like some studious clerk, except that
  his voice seemed to ring with some latent power.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that your friend's interest in you was not
  entirely unselfish. For three days he has carried in his pocket an order
  instructing him to produce you here."</p>

  <p>"I knew it!" Peter whispered, under his breath.</p>

  <p>"You interest me," Sogrange replied. "May I know whom I have the honor of
  addressing?"</p>

  <p>"You can call me Burr," the man announced, "Philip Burr. Your names it is
  not our wish to know."</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I do not quite understand," Sogrange said.</p>

  <p>"It was scarcely to be expected that you should," Mr. Philip Burr
  admitted. "All I can tell you is that, in cases like yours, I really prefer
  not to know with whom I have to deal."</p>

  <p>"You speak as though you had business with us," Peter remarked.</p>

  <p>"Without doubt, I have," the other replied, grimly. "It is my business to
  see that you do not leave these premises alive."</p>

  <p>Sogrange drew up a chair against which he had been leaning, and sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"Really," he said, "that would be most inconvenient." Peter, too, shook
  his head, sitting upon the end of a sofa and folding his arms. Something told
  him that the moment for fighting was not yet.</p>

  <p>"Inconvenient or not," Mr. Philip Burr continued, "I have orders to carry
  out which I can assure you have never yet been disobeyed since the formation
  of our Society. From what I can see of you, you appear to be very amiable
  gentlemen, and if it would interest you to choose the method&mdash;say, of
  your release&mdash;why, I can assure you we'll do all we can to meet your
  views."</p>

  <p>"I am beginning," Sogrange remarked, "to feel quite at home."</p>

  <p>"You see, we've been through this sort of thing before," Peter added,
  blandly.</p>

  <p>Mr. Philip Burr took a cigar from his case and lit it. At a motion of his
  hand, one of the company passed the box to his two guests.</p>

  <p>"You're not counting upon a visit from the police, or anything of that
  sort, I hope?" Mr. Philip Burr asked.</p>

  <p>Sogrange shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Certainly not," he replied. "I may say that much of the earlier portion
  of my life was spent in frustrating the well-meant but impossible schemes of
  that body of men."</p>

  <p>"If only we had a little more time," Mr. Burr declared, "it seems to me I
  should like to make the acquaintance of you two gentlemen."</p>

  <p>"The matter is entirely in your own hands," Peter reminded him. "We are in
  no hurry."</p>

  <p>Mr. Burr smiled genially.</p>

  <p>"You make me think better of humanity," he confessed. "A month ago we had
  a man here&mdash;got him along somehow or another&mdash;and I had to tell him
  that he was up against it like you two are. My! the fuss he made! Kind of
  saddened me to think a man should be such a coward."</p>

  <p>"Some people like that," Sogrange remarked. "By the bye, Mr. Burr, you'll
  pardon my curiosity. Whom have we to thank for our introduction here
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know as there's any particular harm in telling you," Mr. Burr
  replied&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Nor any particular good," a man who was standing by his side interrupted.
  "Say, Phil, you drag these things out too much. Are there any questions
  you've got to ask 'em, or any property to collect?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing of the sort," Mr. Burr admitted.</p>

  <p>"Then let the gang get to work," the other declared.</p>

  <p>The two men were suddenly conscious that they were being surrounded.
  Peter's hand stole on to the butt of his revolver. Sogrange rose slowly to
  his feet. His hands were thrust out in front of him with the thumbs turned
  down. The four fingers of each hand flashed for a minute through the air. Mr.
  Philip Burr lost all his self-control.</p>

  <p>"Say, where the devil did you learn that trick?" he cried.</p>

  <p>Sogrange laughed scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Trick!" he exclaimed. "Philip Burr, you are unworthy of your position. I
  am the Marquis de Sogrange, and my friend here is the Baron de Grost."</p>

  <p>Mr. Philip Burr had no words. His cigar had dropped on to the carpet. He
  was simply staring.</p>

  <p>"If you need proof," Sogrange continued, "further than any I have given
  you, I have in my pocket, at the present moment, a letter, signed by you
  yourself, pleading for formal reinstatement. This is how you would qualify
  for it! You make use of your power to run a common decoy house, to do away
  with men for money. What fool gave you our names, pray?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Philip Burr was only the wreck of a man. He could not even control his
  voice.</p>

  <p>"It was some German or Belgian nobleman," he faltered. "He brought us
  excellent letters, and he made a large contribution. It was the Count von
  Hern."</p>

  <p>The anger of Sogrange seemed suddenly to fade away. He threw himself into
  a chair by the side of his companion.</p>

  <p>"My dear Baron," he exclaimed, "Bernadine has scored, indeed! Your friend
  has a sense of humor which overwhelms me. Imagine it. He has delivered the
  two heads of our great Society into the hands of one of its cast-off
  branches! Bernadine is a genius, indeed!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Philip Burr began slowly to recover himself. He waved his hand. Nine
  out of the twelve men left the room.</p>

  <p>"Marquis," he said, "for ten years there has been no one whom I have
  desired to meet so much as you. I came to Europe but you declined to receive
  me. I know very well we can't keep our end up like you over there, because we
  haven't politics and that sort of things to play with, but we've done our
  best. We've encouraged only criminology of the highest order. We've tried all
  we can to keep the profession select. The jail-bird, pure and simple, we have
  cast out. The men who have suffered at our hands have been men who have met
  with their deserts."</p>

  <p>"What about us?" Peter demanded. "It seems to me that you had most
  unpleasant plans for our future."</p>

  <p>Philip Burr held up his hands.</p>

  <p>"As I live," he declared, "this is the first time that any money
  consideration has induced me to break away from our principles. That Count
  von Hern, he had powerful friends who were our friends, and he gave me the
  word, straight, that you two had an appointment down below which was
  considerably overdue. I don't know, even now, why I consented. I guess it
  isn't much use apologizing."</p>

  <p>Sogrange rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I am not inclined to bear malice, but you must
  understand this from me, Philip Burr. As a Society, I dissolve you. I deprive
  you of your title and of your signs. Call yourself what you will, but never
  again mention the name of the 'Double-Four.' With us in Europe, another era
  has dawned. We are on the side of law and order. We protect only criminals of
  a certain class, in whose operations we have faith. There is no future for
  such a society in this country. Therefore, as I say, I dissolve it. Now, if
  you are ready, perhaps you will be so good as to provide us with the means of
  reaching our hotel."</p>

  <p>Philip Burr led them into a back street, where his own handsome automobile
  was placed at their service.</p>

  <p>"This kind of breaks me all up," he declared, as he gave the instructions
  to the chauffeur. "If there were two men on the face of this earth whom I'd
  have been proud to meet in a friendly sort of way, it's you two."</p>

  <p>"We bear no malice, Mr. Burr," Sogrange assured him. "You can, if you will
  do us the honor, lunch with us to-morrow at one o'clock at Rector's. My
  friend here is quite interested in the Count von Hern, and he would probably
  like to hear exactly how this affair was arranged."</p>

  <p>"I'll be there, sure," Philip Burr promised, with a farewell wave of the
  hand.</p>

  <p>Sogrange and Peter drove back towards their hotel in silence. It was only
  when they emerged into the civilized part of the city that Sogrange began to
  laugh softly.</p>

  <p>"My friend," he murmured, "you bluffed fairly well, but you were afraid.
  Oh, how I smiled to see your fingers close round the butt of that
  revolver!"</p>

  <p>"What about you?" Peter asked, gruffly. "You don't suppose you took me in,
  do you?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange smiled.</p>

  <p>"I had two reasons for coming to New York," he said. "One we accomplished
  upon the steamer. The other was&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"To reply personally to this letter of Mr. Philip Burr," Sogrange replied,
  "which letter, by the bye, was dated from 15, 100th Street, New York. An
  ordinary visit there would have been useless to me. Something of this sort
  was necessary."</p>

  <p>"Then you knew!" Peter gasped. "Notwithstanding all your bravado, you
  knew!"</p>

  <p>"I had a very fair idea," Sogrange admitted. "Don't be annoyed with me, my
  friend. You have had a little experience. It is all useful. It isn't the
  first time you've looked death in the face. Adventures come to some men
  unasked. You, I think, were born with the habit of them."</p>

  <p>Peter smiled. They had reached the hotel courtyard and he raised himself
  stiffly.</p>

  <p>"There's a little fable about the pitcher that went once too often to the
  well," he remarked. "I have had my share of luck&mdash;more than my share.
  The end must come sometime, you know."</p>

  <p>"Is this superstition?" Sogrange asked.</p>

  <p>"Superstition, pure and simple," Peter confessed, taking his key from the
  office. "It doesn't alter anything. I am fatalist enough to shrug my
  shoulders and move on. But I tell you, Sogrange," he added, after a moment's
  pause, "I wouldn't admit it to any one else in the world, but I am afraid of
  Bernadine. I have had the best of it so often. It can't last. In all we've
  had twelve encounters. The next will be the thirteenth."</p>

  <p>Sogrange shrugged his shoulders slightly as he rang for the lift.</p>

  <p>"I'd propose you for the Thirteen Club, only there's some uncomfortable
  clause about yearly suicides which might not suit you," he remarked.
  "Good-night, and don't dream of Bernadine and your thirteenth encounter."</p>

  <p>"I only hope," Peter murmured, "that I may be in a position to dream after
  it."</p>

  <h2>XI. THE THIRTEENTH ENCOUNTER</h2>

  <h3>First published in <i>Pearson's Magazine</i> (US), Oct 1911</h3>

  <p class="first">The Marquis de Sogrange arrived in Berkeley Square with the
  gray dawn of an October morning, showing in his appearance and dress few
  enough signs of his night journey. Yet he had traveled without stopping from
  Paris, by fast motor car and the mail boat.</p>

  <p>"They telephoned me from Charing Cross," Peter said, "that you could not
  possibly arrive until midday. The clerk assured me that no train had yet
  reached Calais."</p>

  <p>"They had reason in what they told you," Sogrange remarked, as he leaned
  back in a chair and sipped the coffee which had been waiting for him in the
  Baron de Grost's study. "The train itself never got more than a mile away
  from the Gare du Nord. The engine-driver was shot through the head and the
  metals were torn from the way. Paris is within a year now of a second and
  more terrible revolution."</p>

  <p>"You really believe this?" Peter asked, gravely.</p>

  <p>"It is a certainty," Sogrange replied. "Not I alone but many others can
  see this clearly. Everywhere the Socialists have wormed themselves into
  places of trust. They are to be met with in every rank of life, under every
  form of disguise. The post-office strike has already shown us what deplorable
  disasters even a skirmish can bring about. To-day the railway strike has
  paralyzed France. To-day our country lies absolutely at the mercy of any
  invader. As it happens, none is, for the moment, prepared. Who can tell how
  it may be next time?"</p>

  <p>"This is had news," Peter declared. "If this is really the position of
  affairs, the matter is much more serious than the newspapers would have us
  believe."</p>

  <p>"The newspapers," Sogrange muttered, "ignore what lies behind. Some of
  them, I think, are paid to do it. As for the rest, our Press had always an
  ostrich-like tendency. The Frenchman of the cafe does not buy his journal to
  be made sad."</p>

  <p>"You believe, then," Peter asked, "that these strikes have some definite
  tendency?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange set down his cup and smiled bitterly. In the early sunlight,
  still a little cold and unloving, Peter could see that there was a change in
  the man. He was no longer the debonair aristocrat of the race-courses and the
  boulevards. The shadows under his eyes were deeper, his cheeks more sunken.
  He had lost something of the sprightliness of his bearing. His attitude,
  indeed, was almost dejected. He was like a man who sees into the future and
  finds there strange and gruesome things.</p>

  <p>"I do more than believe that," he declared. "I know it. It has fallen to
  my lot to make a very definite discovery concerning them. Listen, my friend.
  For more than six months the government has been trying to discover the
  source of this stream of vile socialistic literature which has contaminated
  the French working classes. The pamphlets have been distributed with devilish
  ingenuity among all national operatives, the army and the navy. The
  government has failed. The Double-Four has succeeded."</p>

  <p>"You have really discovered their source?" Peter exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," Sogrange assented. "The government appealed to us first
  some months ago when I was in America. For a time we had no success. Then a
  clue, and the rest was easy. The navy, the army, the post-office employees,
  the telegraph and telephone operators and the railway men, have been the
  chief recipients of this incessant stream of foul literature. To-day one
  cannot tell how much mischief has been actually done. The strikes which have
  already occurred are only the mutterings of the coming storm. But mark you,
  wherever those pamphlets have gone, trouble has followed. What men may do the
  government is doing, but all the time the poison is at work, the seed has
  been sown. Two millions of money have been spent to corrupt that very class
  which should be the backbone of France. Through the fingers of one man has
  come this shower of gold, one man alone has stood at the head of the great
  organization which has disseminated this loathsome disease. Behind
  him&mdash;well, we know."</p>

  <p>"The man?"</p>

  <p>"It is fitting that you should ask that question," Sogrange replied. "The
  name of that man is Bernadine, Count von Hern."</p>

  <p>Peter remained speechless. There was something almost terrible in the slow
  preciseness with which Sogrange had uttered the name of his enemy, something
  unspeakably threatening in the cold glitter of his angry eyes.</p>

  <p>"Up to the present," Sogrange continued, "I have
  watched&mdash;sympathetically, of course, but with a certain amount of
  amusement&mdash;the duel between you and Bernadine. It has been against your
  country and your country's welfare that most of his efforts have been
  directed, which perhaps accounts for the equanimity with which I have been
  contented to remain a looker-on. It is apparent, my dear Baron, that in most
  of your encounters the honors have remained with you. Yet, as it has chanced,
  never once has Bernadine been struck a real and crushing blow. The time has
  come when this and more must happen. It is no longer a matter of polite
  exchanges. It is a duel a outrance."</p>

  <p>"You mean," Peter began&mdash;</p>

  <p>"I mean that Bernadine must die," Sogrange declared.</p>

  <p>There was a brief silence. Outside, the early morning street noises were
  increasing in volume as the great army of workers, streaming towards the
  heart of the city from a hundred suburbs, passed on to their tasks. A streak
  of sunshine had found its way into the room, lay across the carpet and
  touched Sogrange's still, waxen features. Peter glanced half fearfully at his
  friend and visitor. He himself was no coward, no shrinker from the great
  issues. He, too, had dealt in life and death. Yet there was something in the
  deliberate preciseness of Sogrange's words, as he sat there only a few feet
  away, unspeakably thrilling. It was like a death sentence pronounced in all
  solemnity upon some shivering criminal. There was something inevitable and
  tragical about the whole affair. A pronouncement had been made from which
  there was no appeal&mdash;Bernadine was to die!</p>

  <p>"Isn't this a little exceeding the usual exercise of our powers?" Peter
  asked, slowly.</p>

  <p>"No such occasion as this has ever yet arisen," Sogrange reminded him.
  "Bernadine has fled to this country with barely an hour to spare. His offense
  is extraditable by a law of the last century which has never been repealed.
  He is guilty of treason against the Republic of France. Yet they do not want
  him back, they do not want a trial. I have papers upon my person which, if I
  took them into an English court, would procure for me a warrant for
  Bernadine's arrest. It is not this we desire. Bernadine must die. No fate
  could be too terrible for a man who has striven to corrupt the soul of a
  nation. It is not war, this. It is not honest conspiracy. Is it war, I ask
  you, to seek to poison the drinking water of an enemy, to send stalking into
  their midst some loathsome disease? Such things belong to the ages of
  barbarity. Bernadine has striven to revive them and Bernadine shall die."</p>

  <p>"It is justice," Peter admitted.</p>

  <p>"The question remains," Sogrange continued, "by whose hand&mdash;yours or
  mine?"</p>

  <p>Peter started uneasily.</p>

  <p>"Is that necessary?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I fear that it is," Sogrange replied. "We had a brief meeting of the
  executive council last night, and it was decided, for certain reasons, to
  entrust this task into no other hands. You will smile when I tell you that
  these accursed pamphlets have found their way into the possession of many of
  the rank and file of our own order. There is a marked disinclination on the
  part of those who have been our slaves, to accept orders from any one.
  Espionage we can still command&mdash;the best, perhaps, in
  Europe&mdash;because here we use a different class of material. But of those
  underneath, we are, for the moment, doubtful. Paris is all in a ferment.
  Under its outward seemliness a million throats are ready to take up the
  brazen cry of revolution. One trusts nobody. One fears all the time."</p>

  <p>"You or I!" Peter repeated, slowly. "It will not be sufficient, then, that
  we find Bernadine and deliver him over to your country's laws?"</p>

  <p>"It will not be sufficient," Sogrange answered, sternly. "From those he
  may escape. For him there must be no escape."</p>

  <p>"Sogrange," Peter said, speaking in a low tone, "I have never yet killed a
  human being."</p>

  <p>"Nor I," Sogrange admitted. "Nor have I yet set my heel upon its head and
  stamped the life from a rat upon the pavement. But one lives and one moves
  on. Bernadine is the enemy of your country and mine. He makes war after the
  fashion of vermin. No ordinary cut-throat would succeed against him. It must
  be you or I."</p>

  <p>"How shall we decide?" Peter asked.</p>

  <p>"The spin of a coin," Sogrange replied. "It is best that way. It is best,
  too, done quickly."</p>

  <p>Peter produced a sovereign from his pocket and balanced it on the palm of
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"Let it be understood," Sogrange continued, "that this is a dual
  undertaking. We toss only for the final honor&mdash;for the last stroke. If
  the choice falls upon me, I shall count upon you to help me to the end. If it
  falls upon you, I shall be at your right hand even when you strike the
  blow."</p>

  <p>"It is agreed," Peter said. "See, it is for you to call."</p>

  <p>He threw the coin high into the air.</p>

  <p>"I call heads," Sogrange decided.</p>

  <p>It fell upon the table. Peter covered it with his hand and then slowly
  withdrew the fingers. A little shiver ran through his veins. The harmless
  head that looked up at him was like the figure of death. It was for him to
  strike the blow!</p>

  <p>"Where is Bernadine now?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Get me a morning paper and I will tell you," Sogrange declared, rising.
  "He was in the train which was stopped outside the Gare du Nord, on his way
  to England. What became of the passengers I have not heard. I knew what was
  likely to happen, and I left an hour before in a 100 H. P. Charron."</p>

  <p>Peter rang the bell and ordered the servant who answered it to procure the
  Daily Telegraph. As soon as it arrived, he spread it open upon the table and
  Sogrange looked over his shoulder. These are the headings which they saw in

                     RENEWED RIOTS IN PARIS

                  THE GARE DU NORD IN FLAMES

         TERRIBLE ACCIDENT TO THE CALAIS-DOUVRES EXPRESS

                         MANY DEATHS
</pre>

  <p>Peter's forefinger traveled down the page swiftly. It paused at the
  following paragraph:</p>

  <p>The 8.55 train from the Gare du Nord, carrying many passengers for London,
  after being detained within a mile of Paris for over an hour owing to the
  murder of the engine-driver, made an attempt last night to proceed, with
  terrible results. Near Chantilly, whilst travelling at over fifty miles an
  hour, the switches were tampered with and the express dashed into a goods
  train laden with minerals. Very few particulars are yet to hand, but the
  express was completely wrecked and many lives have been lost.</p>

  <p>Among the dead are the following:</p>

  <p>One by one Peter read out the names. Then he stopped short. A little
  exclamation broke from Sogrange's lips. The thirteenth name upon that list of
  dead was that of Bernadine, Count von Hern.</p>

  <p>"Bernadine!" Peter faltered. "Bernadine is dead!"</p>

  <p>"Killed by the strikers!" Sogrange echoed! "It is a just thing, this."</p>

  <p>The two men looked down at the paper and then up at one another. A strange
  silence seemed to have found its way into the room. The shadow of death lay
  between them. Peter touched his forehead and found it wet.</p>

  <p>"It is a just thing, indeed," he repeated, "but justice and death are
  alike terrible."...</p>

  <p>Late in the afternoon of the same day, a motor car, splashed with mud,
  drew up before the door of the house in Berkeley Square. Sogrange, who was
  standing talking to Peter before the library window, suddenly broke off in
  the middle of a sentence. He stepped back into the room and gripped his
  friend's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It is the Baroness!" he exclaimed, quickly. "What does she want
  here?"</p>

  <p>"The Baroness who? Peter demanded.</p>

  <p>"The Baroness von Ratten. You must have heard of her&mdash;she is the
  friend of Bernadine."</p>

  <p>The two men had been out to lunch at the Ritz with Violet and had walked
  across the Park home. Sogrange had been drawing on his gloves in the act of
  starting out for a call at the Embassy.</p>

  <p>"Does your wife know this woman?" he asked. Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I think not," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Then she has come to see you," Sogrange continued. "What does it mean, I
  wonder?"</p>

  <p>Peter shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"We shall know in a minute."</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door and his servant entered, bearing a card.</p>

  <p>"This lady would like to see you, sir, on important business," he
  said.</p>

  <p>"You can show her in here," Peter directed.</p>

  <p>There was a very short delay. The two men had no time to exchange a word.
  They heard the rustling of a woman's gown, and immediately afterwards the
  perfume of violets seemed to fill the room.</p>

  <p>"The Baroness von Ratten!" the butler announced.</p>

  <p>The door was closed behind her. The servant had disappeared. Peter
  advanced to meet his guest. She was a little above medium height, very slim,
  with extraordinarily fair hair, colorless face, and strange eyes. She was not
  strictly beautiful and yet there was no man upon whom her presence was
  without its effect. Her voice was like her movements, slow and with a grace
  of its own.</p>

  <p>"You do not mind that I have come to see you?" she asked, raising her eyes
  to Peter's. "I believe before I go that you will think terrible things of me,
  but you must not begin before I have told you my errand. It has been a great
  struggle with me before I made up my mind to come here."</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down, Baroness?" Peter invited.</p>

  <p>She saw Sogrange and hesitated.</p>

  <p>"You are not alone," she said, softly. "I wish to speak with you
  alone."</p>

  <p>"Permit me to present to you the Marquis de Sogrange," Peter begged. "He
  is my oldest friend, Baroness. I think that whatever you might have to say to
  me you might very well say before him."</p>

  <p>"It is&mdash;of a private nature," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"The Marquis and I have no secrets," Peter declared, "either political or
  private."</p>

  <p>She sat down and motioned Peter to take a place by her side upon the
  sofa.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive me if I am a little incoherent," she implored. "To-day I
  have had a shock. You, too, have read the news? You must know that the Count
  von Hern is dead&mdash;killed in the railway accident last night?"</p>

  <p>"We read it in the Daily Telegraph," Peter replied.</p>

  <p>"It is in all the papers," she continued. "You know that he was a very
  dear friend of mine?"</p>

  <p>"I have heard so," Peter admitted.</p>

  <p>"Yet there was one subject," she insisted, earnestly, "upon which we never
  agreed. He hated England. I have always loved it. England was kind to me when
  my own country drove me out. I have always felt grateful. It has been a
  sorrow to me that in so many of his schemes, in so much of his work,
  Bernadine should consider his own country at the expense of yours."</p>

  <p>Sogrange drew a little nearer. It began to be interesting, this.</p>

  <p>"I heard the news early this morning by telegram," she went on. "For a
  long time I was prostrated. Then early this afternoon I began to
  think&mdash;one must always think. Bernadine was a dear friend, but things
  between us lately have been different, a little strained. Was it his fault or
  mine&mdash;who can say? Does one tire with the years, I wonder? I
  wonder!"</p>

  <p>Her eyes were lifted to his and Peter was conscious of the fact that she
  wished him to know that they were beautiful. She looked slowly away
  again.</p>

  <p>"This afternoon, as I sat alone," she proceeded, "I remembered that in my
  keeping were many boxes of papers and many letters which have recently
  arrived, all belonging to Bernadine. I reflected that there were certainly
  some who were in his confidence, and that very soon they would come from his
  country and take them all away. And then I remembered what I owed to England,
  and how opposed I always was to Bernadine's schemes, and I thought that the
  best thing I could do to show my gratitude would be to place his papers all
  in the hands of some Englishman, so that they might do no more harm to the
  country which has been kind to me. So I came to you."</p>

  <p>Again her eyes were lifted to his and Peter was very sure indeed that they
  were wonderfully beautiful. He began to realize the fascination of this
  woman, of whom he had heard so much. Her very absence of coloring was a
  charm.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you have brought me these papers?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head slowly.</p>

  <p>"No," she said, "I could not do that. There were too many of
  them&mdash;they are too heavy, and there are piles of
  pamphlets&mdash;revolutionary pamphlets, I am afraid&mdash;all in French,
  which I do not understand. No, I could not bring them to you. But I ordered
  my motor car and I drove up here to tell you that if you like to come down to
  the house in the country where I have been living, to which Bernadine was to
  have come to-night&mdash;yes, and bring your friend, too, if you
  will&mdash;you shall look through them before any one else can arrive."</p>

  <p>"You are very kind," Peter murmured. "Tell me where it is that you
  live."</p>

  <p>"It is beyond Hitchin," she told him, "up the Great North Road. I tell you
  at once, it is a horrible house in a horrible lonely spot. Within a day or
  two I shall leave it myself forever. I hate it&mdash;it gets on my nerves. I
  dream of all the terrible things which perhaps have taken place there. Who
  can tell? It was Bernadine's long before I came to England."</p>

  <p>"When are we to come?" Peter asked.</p>

  <p>"You must come back with me now, at once," the Baroness insisted. "I
  cannot tell how soon some one in his confidence may arrive."</p>

  <p>"I will order my car," Peter declared.</p>

  <p>She laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind coming in mine?" she begged. "It is of no consequence, if you
  object, but every servant in Bernadine's house is a German and a spy. There
  are no women except my own maid. Your car is likely enough known to them and
  there might be trouble. If you will come with me now, you and your friend, if
  you like, I will send you to the station to-night in time to catch the train
  home. I feel that I must have this thing off my mind. You will come?
  Yes?"</p>

  <p>Peter rang the bell and ordered his coat.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," he answered. "May we not offer you some tea first?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"To-day I cannot think of eating or drinking," she replied. "Bernadine and
  I were no longer what we had been, but the shock of his death seems none the
  less terrible. I feel like a traitor to him for coming here, yet I believe
  that I am doing what is right," she added, softly.</p>

  <p>"If you will excuse me for one moment," Peter said, "while I take leave of
  my wife, I will rejoin you presently."</p>

  <p>Peter was absent for only a few minutes. Sogrange and the Baroness
  exchanged the merest commonplaces. As they all passed down the hall, Sogrange
  lingered behind.</p>

  <p>"If you will take the Baroness out to the car," he suggested, "I will
  telephone to the Embassy and tell them not to expect me."</p>

  <p>Peter offered his arm to his companion. She seemed, indeed, to need
  support. Her fingers clutched at his coat-sleeve as they passed on to the
  pavement.</p>

  <p>"I am so glad to be no longer quite alone," she whispered. "Almost I wish
  that your friend were not coming. I know that Bernadine and you were enemies,
  but then you were enemies not personally, but politically. After all, it is
  you who stand for the things which have become so dear to me."</p>

  <p>"It is true that Bernadine and I were bitter antagonists," Peter admitted,
  gravely. "Death, however, ends all that. I wish him no further harm."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"As for me," she said, "I am growing used to being friendless. I was
  friendless before Bernadine came, and latterly we have been nothing to one
  another. Now, I suppose, I shall know what it is to be an outcast once more.
  Did you ever hear my history, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Never, Baroness," he replied. "I understood, I believe, that your
  marriage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My husband divorced me," she confessed, simply. "He was quite within his
  rights. He was impossible. I was very young and very sentimental. They say
  that Englishwomen are cold," she added. "Perhaps that is so. People think
  that I look cold. Do you?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange suddenly opened the door of the car in which they were already
  seated. She leaned back and half closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is rather a long ride," she said, "and I am worn out. I hope you will
  not mind, but for myself I cannot talk when motoring. Smoke, if it pleases
  you."</p>

  <p>"Might one inquire as to our exact destination?" Sogrange asked.</p>

  <p>"We go beyond Hitchin, up the Great North Road," she told him again. "The
  house is called the High House. It stands in the middle of a heath and I
  think it is the loneliest and most miserable place that was ever built. I
  hate it and I am frightened in it. For some reason or other, it suited
  Bernadine, but that is all over now."</p>

  <p>The little party of three relapsed into silence. The car, driven carefully
  enough through the busy streets, gradually increased its pace as they drew
  clear of the suburbs. Peter leaned back in his place, thinking. Bernadine was
  dead! Nothing else would have convinced him so utterly of the fact as that
  simple sentence in the Daily Telegraph, which had been followed up by a
  confirmation and a brief obituary notice in all the evening papers. Curiously
  enough, the fact seemed to have drawn a certain spice out of even this
  adventure; to point, indeed, to a certain monotony in the future. Their
  present enterprise, important though it might turn out to be, was nothing to
  be proud of. A woman, greedy for gold, was selling her lover's secrets before
  the breath was out of his body. Peter turned in his cushioned seat to look at
  her. Without doubt, she was beautiful to one who understood, beautiful in a
  strange, colorless, feline fashion, the beauty of soft limbs, soft movements,
  a caressing voice, with always the promise beyond of more than the actual
  words. Her eyes now were closed, her face was a little weary. Did she really
  rest, Peter wondered? He watched the rising and falling of her bosom, the
  quivering now and then of her eyelids. She had indeed the appearance of a
  woman who had suffered.</p>

  <p>The car rushed on into the darkness. Behind them lay that restless
  phantasmagoria of lights streaming to the sky. In front, blank space. Peter,
  through half-closed eyes, watched the woman by his side. From the moment of
  her entrance into his library, he had summed her up in his mind with a single
  word. She was, beyond a doubt, an adventuress. No woman could have proposed
  the things which she had proposed, who was not of that ilk. Yet for that
  reason it behooved them to have a care in their dealings with her. At her
  instigation they had set out upon this adventure, which might well turn out
  according to any fashion that she chose. Yet without Bernadine what could she
  do? She was not the woman to carry on the work which he had left behind, for
  the love of him. Her words had been frank, her action shameful but natural.
  Bernadine was dead and she had realized quickly enough the best market for
  his secrets. In a few days' time his friends would have come and she would
  have received nothing. He told himself that he was foolish to doubt her.
  There was not a flaw in the sequence of events, no possible reason for the
  suspicions which yet lingered at the back of his brain. Intrigue, it was
  certain, was to her as the breath of her body. He was perfectly willing to
  believe that the death of Bernadine would have affected her little more than
  the sweeping aside of a fly. His very common sense bade him accept her
  story.</p>

  <p>By degrees he became drowsy. Suddenly he was startled into a very
  wide-awake state. Through half-closed eyes he had seen Sogrange draw a sheet
  of paper from his pocket, a gold pencil from his chain, and commence to
  write. In the middle of a sentence, his eyes were abruptly lifted. He was
  looking at the Baroness. Peter, too, turned his head; he, also, looked at the
  Baroness. Without a doubt, she had been watching both of them. Sogrange's
  pencil continued its task, only he traced no more characters. Instead, he
  seemed to be sketching a face, which presently he tore carefully up into
  small pieces and destroyed. He did not even glance towards Peter, but Peter
  understood very well what had happened. He had been about to send him a
  message, but had found the Baroness watching. Peter was fully awake now. His
  faint sense of suspicion had deepened into a positive foreboding. He had a
  reckless desire to stop the car, to descend upon the road and let the secrets
  of Bernadine go where they would. Then his natural love of adventure blazed
  up once more. His moment of weakness had passed. The thrill was in his blood,
  his nerves were tightened. He was ready for what might come, seemingly still
  half asleep, yet, indeed, with every sense of intuition and observation
  keenly alert.</p>

  <p>Sogrange leaned over from his place.</p>

  <p>"It is a lonely country, this, into which we are coming, madame," he
  remarked.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Indeed, it is not so lonely here as you will think it when we arrive at
  our destination," she replied. "There are houses here, but they are hidden by
  the trees. There are no houses near us."</p>

  <p>She rubbed the pane with her hand.</p>

  <p>"We are, I believe, very nearly there," she said. "This is the nearest
  village. Afterwards, we just climb a hill and about half a mile along the top
  of it is the High House."</p>

  <p>"And the name of the village," Sogrange inquired.</p>

  <p>"St Mary's," she told him, "In the summer people call it beautiful around
  here. To me it is the most melancholy spot I ever saw. There is so much rain,
  and one hears the drip, drip in the trees all the day long. Alone I could not
  bear it. To-morrow or the next day I shall pack up my belongings and come to
  London. I am, unfortunately," she added, with a little sigh, "very, very
  poor, but it is my hope that you may find the papers, of which I have spoken
  to you, valuable."</p>

  <p>Sogrange smiled faintly. Peter and he could scarcely forbear to exchange a
  single glance. The woman's candor was almost brutal. She read their
  thoughts.</p>

  <p>"We ascend the hill," she continued. "We draw now very near to the end of
  our journey. There is still one thing I would say to you. Do not think too
  badly of me for what I am about to do. To Bernadine, while he lived, I was
  faithful. Many a time I could have told you of his plans and demanded a great
  sum of money, and you would have given it me willingly, but my lips were
  sealed because, in a way, I loved him. While he lived I gave him what I owed.
  To-day he is dead, and, whatever I do, it cannot concern him any more. To-day
  I am a free woman and I take the side I choose."</p>

  <p>"Dear madame," he replied, "what you have proposed to us is, after all,
  quite natural and very gracious. If one has a fear at all about the matter,
  it is as to the importance of these documents you speak of. Bernadine, I
  know, has dealt in great affairs; but he was a diplomat by instinct,
  experienced and calculating. One does not keep incriminating papers."</p>

  <p>She leaned a little forward. The car had swung round a corner now and was
  making its way up an avenue as dark as pitch.</p>

  <p>"The wisest of us, Monsieur le Marquis," she whispered, "reckon sometimes
  without that one element of sudden death. What should you say, I wonder, to a
  list of agents in France pledged to circulate in certain places literature of
  an infamous sort? What should you say, monsieur, to a copy of a secret report
  of your late maneuvers, franked with the name of one of your own staff
  officers? What should you say," she went on, "to a list of Socialist deputies
  with amounts against their name, amounts paid in hard cash? Are these of no
  importance to you?"</p>

  <p>"Madame," Sogrange answered, simply, "for such information, if it were
  genuine, it would be hard to mention a price which we should not be prepared
  to pay."</p>

  <p>The car came to a sudden standstill. The first impression of the two men
  was that the Baroness had exaggerated the loneliness and desolation of the
  place. There was nothing mysterious or forbidding about the plain, brownstone
  house before which they had stopped. The windows were streaming with light;
  the hall door, already thrown open, disclosed a very comfortable hall,
  brilliantly illuminated. A man-servant assisted his mistress to alight,
  another ushered them in. In the background were other servants. The Baroness
  glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"About dinner, Carl?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It waits for madame," the man answered.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Take care of these gentlemen till I descend," she ordered. "You will not
  mind?" she added, turning pleadingly to Sogrange. "To-day I have eaten
  nothing. I am faint with hunger. Afterwards, it will be a matter but of half
  an hour. You can be in London again by ten o'clock."</p>

  <p>"As you will, madame," Sogrange replied. "We are greatly indebted to you
  for your hospitality. But for costume, you understand that we are as we
  are?"</p>

  <p>"It is perfectly understood," she assured him. "For myself, I rejoin you
  in ten minutes. A loose gown, that is all."</p>

  <p>Sogrange and Peter were shown into a modern bathroom by a servant who was
  so anxious to wait upon them that they had difficulty in sending him away. As
  soon as he was gone and the door closed behind him, Peter put his foot
  against it and turned the key.</p>

  <p>"You were going to write something to me in the car?"</p>

  <p>Sogrange nodded.</p>

  <p>"There was a moment," he admitted, "when I had a suspicion. It has passed.
  This woman is no Roman. She sells the secrets of Bernadine as she would sell
  herself. Nevertheless, it is well always to be prepared. There were probably
  others beside Bernadine who had the entree here."</p>

  <p>"The only suspicious circumstance which I have noticed," Peter remarked,
  "is the number of men-servants. I have seen five already."</p>

  <p>"It is only fair to remember," Sogrange reminded him, "that the Baroness
  herself told us that there were no other save men-servants here and that they
  were all spies. Without a master, I cannot see that they are dangerous. One
  needs, however, to watch all the time."</p>

  <p>"If you see anything suspicious," Peter said, "tap the table with your
  forefinger. Personally, I will admit that I have had my doubts of the
  Baroness, but on the whole I have come to the conclusion that they were
  groundless. She is not the sort of woman to take up a vendetta, especially an
  unprofitable one."</p>

  <p>"She is an exceedingly dangerous person for an impressionable man like
  myself," Sogrange remarked, arranging his tie.</p>

  <p>The butler fetched them in a very few moments and showed them into a
  pleasantly-furnished library, where he mixed cocktails for them from a
  collection of bottles upon the sideboard. He was quite friendly and inclined
  to be loquacious, although he spoke with a slight foreign accent. The house
  belonged to an English gentleman from whom the honored Count had taken it,
  furnished. They were two miles from a station and a mile from the village. It
  was a lonely part, but there were always people coming or going. With one's
  work one scarcely noticed it. He was gratified that the gentlemen found his
  cocktails so excellent. Perhaps he might be permitted the high honor of
  mixing them another? It was a day, this, of deep sadness and gloom. One
  needed to drink something, indeed, to forget the terrible thing which had
  happened. The Count had been a good master, a little impatient sometimes, but
  kind-hearted. The news had been a shock to them all.</p>

  <p>Then, before they had expected her, the Baroness reappeared. She wore a
  wonderful gray gown which seemed to be made in a single piece, a gown which
  fitted her tightly, and yet gave her the curious appearance of a woman
  walking without the burden of clothes. Sogrange, Parisian to the finger-tips,
  watched her with admiring approval. She laid her fingers upon his arm,
  although it was towards Peter that her eyes traveled.</p>

  <p>"Will you take me in, Marquis?" she begged. "It is the only formality we
  will allow ourselves."</p>

  <p>They entered a long, low dining-room, paneled with oak, and with the
  family portraits of the owner of the house still left upon the wall. Dinner
  was served upon a round table and was laid for four. There was a profusion of
  silver, very beautiful glass, and a wonderful cluster of orchids. The
  Marquis, as he handed his hostess to her chair, glanced towards the vacant
  place.</p>

  <p>"It is for my companion, an Austrian lady," she explained. "To-night,
  however, I think that she will not come. She was a distant connection of
  Bernadine's and she is much upset. We leave her place and see. You will sit
  on my other side, Baron."</p>

  <p>The fingers which touched Peter's arm brushed his hand, and were withdrawn
  as though with reluctance. She sank into her chair with a little sigh.</p>

  <p>"It is charming of you two, this," she declared, softly. "You help me
  through this night of solitude and sadness. What I should do if I were alone,
  I cannot tell. You must drink with me a toast, if you will. Will you make it
  to our better acquaintance?"</p>

  <p>No soup had been offered and champagne was served with the hors d'oeuvre.
  Peter raised his glass and looked into the eyes of the woman who was leaning
  so closely towards him that her soft breath fell upon his cheek. She
  whispered something in his ear. For a moment, perhaps, he was carried away,
  but for a moment only. Then Sogrange's voice and the beat of his forefinger
  upon the table stiffened him into sudden alertness. They heard a motor car
  draw up outside.</p>

  <p>"Who can it be?" the Baroness exclaimed, setting her glass down
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"It is, perhaps, our fourth guest who arrives," Sogrange remarked.</p>

  <p>They all three listened, Peter and Sogrange with their glasses still
  suspended in the air.</p>

  <p>"Our fourth guest?" the Baroness repeated. "Madame von Estenier is
  upstairs, lying down. I cannot tell who this may be."</p>

  <p>Her lips were parted. The lines of her forehead had suddenly appeared. Her
  eyes were turned toward the door, hard and bright. Then the glass which she
  had nervously picked up again and was holding between her fingers, fell on to
  the tablecloth with a little crash, and the yellow wine ran bubbling on to
  her plate. Her scream echoed to the roof and rang through the room. It was
  Bernadine who stood there in the doorway, Bernadine in a long traveling
  ulster and the air of one newly arrived from a journey. They all three looked
  at him, but there was not one who spoke. The Baroness, after her one wild
  cry, was dumb.</p>

  <p>"I am indeed fortunate," Bernadine said. "You have as yet, I see, scarcely
  commenced. You probably expected me. I am charmed to find so agreeable a
  party awaiting my arrival."</p>

  <p>He divested himself of his ulster and threw it across the arm of the
  butler, who stood behind him.</p>

  <p>"Come," he continued; "for a man who has just been killed in a railway
  accident, I find myself with an appetite. A glass of wine, Carl. I do not
  know what that toast was, the drinking of which my coming interrupted, but
  let us all drink it together. Aimee, my love to you, dear. Let me
  congratulate you upon the fortitude and courage with which you ignored those
  lying reports of my death. I had fears that I might find you alone in a
  darkened room, with tear-stained eyes and sal volatile by your side. This is
  infinitely better. Gentlemen, you are welcome."</p>

  <p>Sogrange lifted his glass and bowed courteously. Peter followed suit.</p>

  <p>"Really," Sogrange murmured, "the Press nowadays becomes more unreliable
  every day. It is apparent, my dear Von Hern, that this account of your death
  was, to say the least of it, exaggerated."</p>

  <p>Peter said nothing. His eyes were fixed upon the Baroness. She sat in her
  chair quite motionless, but her face had become like the face of some graven
  image. She looked at Bernadine, but her eyes said nothing. Every glint of
  expression seemed to have left her features. Since that one wild shriek she
  had remained voiceless. Encompassed by danger though he knew they now must
  be, Peter found himself possessed by one thought only. Was this a trap into
  which they had fallen, or was the woman, too, deceived?</p>

  <p>"You bring later news from Paris than I myself," Sogrange proceeded,
  helping himself to one of the dishes which a footman was passing round. "How
  did you reach the coast? The evening papers stated distinctly that since the
  accident no attempt had been made to run trains."</p>

  <p>"By motor car from Chantilly," Bernadine replied. "I had the misfortune to
  lose my servant, who was wearing my coat, and who, I gather from the
  newspaper reports, was mistaken for me. I myself was unhurt. I hired a motor
  car and drove to Boulogne&mdash;not the best of journeys, let me tell you,
  for we broke down three times. There was no steamer there, but I hired a
  fishing boat, which brought me across the Channel in something under eight
  hours. From the coast I motored direct here. I was so anxious," he added,
  raising his eyes, "to see how my dear friend&mdash;my dear Aimee&mdash;was
  bearing the terrible news."</p>

  <p>She fluttered for a moment like a bird in a trap. Peter drew a little sigh
  of relief. His self-respect was reinstated. He had decided that she was
  innocent. Upon them, at least, would not fall the ignominy of having been led
  into the simplest of traps by this white-faced Delilah. The butler had
  brought her another glass, which she raised to her lips. She drained its
  contents, but the ghastliness of her appearance remained unchanged. Peter,
  watching her, knew the signs. She was sick with terror.</p>

  <p>"The conditions throughout France are indeed awful," Sogrange remarked.
  "They say, too, that this railway strike is only the beginning of worse
  things."</p>

  <p>Bernadine smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your country, dear Marquis," he said, "is on its last legs. No one knows
  better than I that it is, at the present moment, honeycombed with sedition
  and anarchical impulses. The people are rotten. For years the whole tone of
  France has been decadent. Its fall must even now be close at hand."</p>

  <p>"You take a gloomy view of my country's future," Sogrange declared.</p>

  <p>"Why should one refuse to face facts?" Bernadine replied. "One does not
  often talk so frankly, but we three are met together this evening under
  somewhat peculiar circumstances. The days of the glory of France are past.
  England has laid out her neck for the yoke of the conqueror. Both are doomed
  to fall. Both are ripe for the great humiliation. You two gentlemen whom I
  have the honor to receive as my guests," he concluded, filling his glass and
  bowing towards them, "in your present unfortunate predicament represent
  precisely the position of your two countries."</p>

  <p>"Ave Caesar!" Peter muttered grimly, raising his glass to his lips.</p>

  <p>Bernadine accepted the challenge.</p>

  <p>"It is not I, alas! who may call myself Caesar," he replied, "although it
  is certainly you who are about to die."</p>

  <p>Sogrange turned to the man who stood behind his chair.</p>

  <p>"If I might trouble you for a little dry toast?" he inquired. "A modern
  but very uncomfortable ailment," he added, with a sigh. "One's digestion must
  march with the years, I suppose."</p>

  <p>Bernadine smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your toast you shall have, with pleasure, Marquis," he said, "but as for
  your indigestion, do not let that trouble you any longer. I think that I can
  promise you immunity from that annoying complaint for the rest of your
  life."</p>

  <p>"You are doing your best," Peter declared, leaning back in his chair, "to
  take away my appetite."</p>

  <p>Bernadine looked searchingly from one to the other of his two guests.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted, "you are brave men. I do not know why I should ever
  have doubted it. Your pose is excellent. I have no wish, however, to see you
  buoyed up by a baseless optimism. A somewhat remarkable chance has delivered
  you into my hands. You are my prisoners. You, Peter, Baron de Grost, I have
  hated all my days. You have stood between me and the achievement of some of
  my most dearly-cherished tasks. Always I have said to myself that the day of
  reckoning must come. It has arrived. As for you, Marquis de Sogrange, if my
  personal feelings towards you are less violent, you still represent the
  things absolutely inimical to me and my interests. The departure of you two
  men was the one thing necessary for the successful completion of certain
  tasks which I have in hand at the present moment."</p>

  <p>Peter pushed away his plate.</p>

  <p>"You have succeeded in destroying my appetite, Count," he declared. "Now
  that you have gone so far in expounding your amiable resolutions towards us,
  perhaps you will go a little further and explain exactly how, in this
  eminently respectable house, situated, I understand, in an eminently
  respectable neighborhood, with a police station within a mile, and a dozen or
  so witnesses as to our present whereabouts, you intend to expedite our
  removal?"</p>

  <p>Bernadine pointed toward the woman who sat facing him.</p>

  <p>"Ask the Baroness how these things are arranged."</p>

  <p>They turned towards her. She fell back in her chair with a little gasp.
  She had fainted. Bernadine shrugged his shoulders. The butler and one of the
  footmen, who during the whole of the conversation had stolidly proceeded with
  their duties, in obedience to a gesture from their master took her up in
  their arms and carried her from the room.</p>

  <p>"The fear has come to her, too," Bernadine murmured, softly. "It may come
  to you, my brave friends, before morning."</p>

  <p>"It is possible," Peter answered, his hand stealing around to his hip
  pocket, "but in the meantime, what is to prevent&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The hip pocket was empty. Peter's sentence ended abruptly. Bernadine
  mocked him.</p>

  <p>"To prevent your shooting me in cold blood, I suppose," he remarked.
  "Nothing except that my servants are too clever. No one save myself is
  allowed to remain under this roof with arms in their possession. Your pocket
  was probably picked before you had been in the place five minutes. No, my
  dear Baron, let me assure you that escape will not be so easy! You were
  always just a little inclined to be led away by the fair sex. The best men in
  the world, you know, have shared that failing, and the Baroness, alone and
  unprotected, had her attractions, eh?"</p>

  <p>Then something happened to Peter which had happened to him barely a dozen
  times in his life. He lost his temper and lost it rather badly. Without an
  instant's hesitation, he caught up the decanter which stood by his side and
  flung it in his host's face. Bernadine only partly avoided it by thrusting
  out his arms. The neck caught his forehead and the blood came streaming over
  his tie and collar. Peter had followed the decanter with a sudden spring. His
  fingers were upon Bernadine's throat and he thrust his head back. Sogrange
  sprang to the door to lock it, but he was too late. The room seemed full of
  men-servants. Peter was dragged away, still struggling fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Tie them up!" Bernadine gasped, swaying in his chair. "Tie them up, do
  you hear? Carl, give me brandy."</p>

  <p>He swallowed half a wineglassful of the raw spirit. His eyes were red with
  fury.</p>

  <p>"Take them to the gun room," he ordered, "three of you to each of them,
  mind. I'll shoot the man who lets either escape."</p>

  <p>But Peter and Sogrange were both of them too wise to expend any more of
  their strength in a useless struggle. They suffered themselves to be
  conducted without resistance across the white stone hall, down a long
  passage, and into a room at the end, the window and fireplace of which were
  both blocked up. The floor was of red flags and the walls whitewashed. The
  only furniture was a couple of kitchen chairs and a long table. The door was
  of stout oak and fitted with a double lock. The sole outlet, so far as they
  could see, was a small round hole at the top of the roof. The door was locked
  behind them. They were alone.</p>

  <p>"The odd trick to Bernadine!" Peter exclaimed hoarsely, wiping a spot of
  blood from his forehead. "My dear Marquis, I scarcely know how to apologize.
  It is not often that I lose my temper so completely."</p>

  <p>"The matter seems to be of very little consequence," Sogrange answered.
  "This was probably our intended destination in any case. Seems to be rather
  an unfortunate expedition of ours, I am afraid."</p>

  <p>"One cannot reckon upon men coming back from the dead," Peter declared.
  "It isn't often that you find every morning and every evening paper mistaken.
  As for the woman, I believe in her. She honestly meant to sell us those
  papers of Bernadine's. I believe that she, too, will have to face a day of
  reckoning."</p>

  <p>Sogrange strolled around the room, subjecting it everywhere to a close
  scrutiny. The result was hopeless. There was no method of escape save through
  the door.</p>

  <p>"There is certainly something strange about this apartment," Peter
  remarked. "It is, to say the least of it, unusual to have windows in the roof
  and a door of such proportions. All the same, I think that those threats of
  Bernadine's were a little strained. One cannot get rid of one's enemies,
  nowadays, in the old-fashioned, melodramatic way. Bernadine must know quite
  well that you and I are not the sort of men to walk into a trap of any one's
  setting, just as I am quite sure that he is not the man to risk even a
  scandal by breaking the law openly."</p>

  <p>"You interest me," Sogrange said. "I begin to suspect that you, too, have
  made some plans."</p>

  <p>"But naturally," Peter replied. "Once before Bernadine set a trap for me
  and he nearly had a chance of sending me for a swim in the Thames. Since then
  one takes precautions as a matter of course. We were followed down here, and
  by this time I should imagine that the alarm is given. If all was well, I was
  to have telephoned an hour ago."</p>

  <p>"You are really," Sogrange declared, "quite an agreeable companion, my
  dear Baron. You think of everything."</p>

  <p>The door was suddenly opened. Bernadine stood upon the threshold and
  behind him several of the servants.</p>

  <p>"You will oblige me by stepping back into the study, my friends," he
  ordered.</p>

  <p>"With great pleasure," Sogrange answered, with alacrity. "We have no fancy
  for this room, I can assure you."</p>

  <p>Once more they crossed the stone hall and entered the room into which they
  had first been shown. On the threshold, Peter stopped short and listened. It
  seemed to him that from somewhere upstairs he could hear the sound of a
  woman's sobs. He turned to Bernadine.</p>

  <p>"The Baroness is not unwell, I trust?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The Baroness is as well as she is likely to be for some time," Bernadine
  replied, grimly.</p>

  <p>They were all in the study now. Upon a table stood a telephone instrument.
  Bernadine drew a small revolver from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Baron de Grost," he said, "I find that you are not quite such a fool as I
  thought you. Some one is ringing up for you on the telephone. You will reply
  that you are well and safe and that you will be home as soon as your business
  here is finished. Your wife is at the other end. If you breathe a single word
  to her of your approaching end, she shall hear through the telephone the
  sound of the revolver shot that sends you to Hell."</p>

  <p>"Dear me," Peter protested, "I find this most unpleasant. If you will
  excuse me, I don't think I'll answer the call at all."</p>

  <p>"You will answer it as I have directed," Bernadine insisted. "Only
  remember this&mdash;if you speak a single ill-advised word, the end will be
  as I have said."</p>

  <p>Peter picked up the receiver and held it to his ear.</p>

  <p>"Who is there?" he asked.</p>

  <p>It was Violet whose voice he heard. He listened for a moment to her
  anxious flood of questions.</p>

  <p>"There is not the slightest cause to be alarmed, dear," he said. "Yes, I
  am down at the High House, near St. Mary's. Bernadine is here. It seems that
  those reports of his death were absolutely unfounded.... Danger? Unprotected?
  Why, my dear Violet, you know how careful I always am. Simply because
  Bernadine used once to live here, and because the Baroness was his friend, I
  spoke to Sir John Dory over the telephone before we left, and an escort of
  half-a-dozen police followed us. They are about the place now, I have no
  doubt, but their presence is quite unnecessary. I shall be home before long,
  dear.... Yes, perhaps it would be as well to send the car down. Any one will
  direct him to the house&mdash;the High House, St. Mary's, remember.
  Good-by!"</p>

  <p>Peter replaced the receiver and turned slowly round. Bernadine was
  smiling.</p>

  <p>"You did well to reassure your wife, even though it was a pack of lies you
  told her," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Peter shrugged his shoulders contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"My dear Bernadine," he said, "up till now I have tried to take you
  seriously. You are really passing the limit. I must positively ask you to
  reflect a little. Do men who live the life that you and I live, trust any
  one? Am I&mdash;is the Marquis de Sogrange here&mdash;after a lifetime of
  experience, likely to leave the safety of our homes in company with a lady of
  whom we knew nothing except that she was your companion, without precautions?
  I do you the justice to believe you a person of commonsense. I know that we
  are as safe in this house as we should be in our own. War cannot be made in
  this fashion in an over-policed country like England."</p>

  <p>"Do not be too sure," Bernadine replied. "There are secrets about this
  house which have not yet been disclosed to you. There are means, my dear
  Baron, of transporting you into a world where you are likely to do much less
  harm than here, means ready at hand, and which would leave no more trace
  behind than those crumbling ashes can tell of the coal mine from which they
  came."</p>

  <p>Peter preserved his attitude of bland incredulity.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, drawing a whistle from his pocket, "it is just possible
  that you are in earnest. I will bet you, then, if you like, a hundred pounds,
  that if I blow this whistle you will either have to open your door within
  five minutes or find your house invaded by the police."</p>

  <p>No one spoke for several moments. The veins were standing out upon
  Bernadine's forehead.</p>

  <p>"We have had enough of this folly," he cried. "If you refuse to realize
  your position, so much the worse for you. Blow your whistle, if you will. I
  am content."</p>

  <p>Peter waited for no second bidding. He raised the whistle to his lips and
  blew it, loudly and persistently. Again there was silence. Bernadine mocked
  him.</p>

  <p>"Try once more, dear Baron," he advised. "Your friends are perhaps a
  little hard of hearing. Try once more, and when you have finished, you and I
  and the Marquis de Sogrange will find our way once more to the gun room and
  conclude that trifling matter of business which brought you here."</p>

  <p>Again Peter blew his whistle and again the silence was broken only by
  Bernadine's laugh. Suddenly, however, that laugh was checked. Every one had
  turned toward the door, listening. A bell was ringing throughout the
  house.</p>

  <p>"It is the front door!" one of the servants exclaimed.</p>

  <p>No one moved. As though to put the matter beyond doubt, there was a steady
  knocking to be heard from the same direction.</p>

  <p>"It is a telegram or some late caller," Bernadine declared, hoarsely.
  "Answer it, Carl. If any one would speak with the Baroness, she is indisposed
  and unable to receive. If any one desires me, I am here."</p>

  <p>The man left the room. They heard him withdraw the chain from the door.
  Bernadine wiped the sweat from his forehead as he listened. He still gripped
  the revolver in his hand. Peter had changed his position a little and was
  standing now behind a high-backed chair. They heard the door creak open, a
  voice outside, and presently the tramp of heavy footsteps. Peter nodded
  understandingly.</p>

  <p>"It is exactly as I told you," he said. "You were wise not to bet, my
  friend."</p>

  <p>Again the tramp of feet in the hall. There was something unmistakable
  about the sound, something final and terrifying. Bernadine saw his triumph
  slipping away. Once more this man who had defied him so persistently, was to
  taste the sweets of victory. With a roar of fury he sprang across the room.
  He fired his revolver twice before Sogrange, with a terrible blow, knocked
  his arm upwards and sent the weapon spinning to the ceiling. Peter struck his
  assailant in the mouth, but the blow seemed scarcely to check him. They
  rolled on the floor together, their arms around one another's necks. It was
  an affair, that, but of a moment. Peter, as lithe as a cat, was on his feet
  again almost at once, with a torn collar and an ugly mark on his face. There
  were strangers in the room now and the servants had mostly slipped away
  during the confusion. It was Sir John Dory himself who locked the door.
  Bernadine struggled slowly to his feet. He was face to face with half a dozen
  police constables in plain clothes.</p>

  <p>"You have a charge against this man, Baron?" the police commissioner
  asked.</p>

  <p>Peter shook his head.</p>

  <p>"The quarrel between us," he replied, "is not for the police courts,
  although I will confess, Sir John, that your intervention was opportune."</p>

  <p>"I, on the other hand," Sogrange put in, "demand the arrest of the Count
  von Hern and the seizure of all papers in this house. I am the bearer of an
  autograph letter from the President of France in connection with this matter.
  The Count von Hern has committed extraditable offenses against my country. I
  am prepared to swear an information to that effect."</p>

  <p>The police commissioner turned to Peter.</p>

  <p>"Your friend's name?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"The Marquis de Sogrange," Peter told him.</p>

  <p>"He is a person of authority?"</p>

  <p>"To my certain knowledge," Peter replied, "he has the implicit confidence
  of the French Government."</p>

  <p>Sir John Dory made a sign. In another moment Bernadine would have been
  arrested. It seemed, indeed, as though nothing could save him now from this
  crowning humiliation. He himself, white and furious, was at a loss how to
  deal with an unexpected situation. Suddenly a thing happened stranger than
  any one of them there had ever dreamed of, so strange that even men such as
  Peter, Sogrange and Dory, whose nerves were of iron, faced one another,
  doubting and amazed. The floor beneath them rocked and billowed like the
  waves of a canvas sea. The windows were filled with flashes of red light, a
  great fissure parted the wall, the pictures and book-cases came crashing down
  beneath a shower of masonry. It was the affair of a second. Above them shone
  the stars and around them a noise like thunder. Bernadine, who alone
  understood, was the first to recover himself. He stood in the midst of them,
  his hands above his head, laughing as he looked around at the strange storm,
  laughing like a madman.</p>

  <p>"The wonderful Carl," he cried. "Oh, matchless servant. Arrest me now, if
  you will, you dogs of the police. Rout out my secrets, dear Baron de Grost.
  Tuck them under your arm and hurry to Downing Street. This is the hospitality
  of the High House, my friends. It loves you so well that only your ashes
  shall leave it."</p>

  <p>His mouth was open for another sentence when he was struck. A whole pillar
  of marble from one of the rooms above came crashing through and buried him
  underneath a falling shower of masonry. Peter escaped by a few inches. Those
  who were left unhurt sprang through the yawning wall out into the garden. Sir
  John, Sogrange and Peter, three of the men&mdash;one limping badly, came to a
  standstill in the middle of the lawn. Before them, the house was crumbling
  like a pack of cards, and louder even than the thunder of the falling
  structure was the roar of the red flames.</p>

  <p>"The Baroness!" Peter cried, and took one leap forward.</p>

  <p>"I am here," she sobbed, running to them from out of the shadows. "I have
  lost everything&mdash;my jewels, my clothes, all except what I have on. They
  gave me but a moment's warning."</p>

  <p>"Is there any one else in the house?" Peter demanded.</p>

  <p>"No one but you who were in that room," she answered.</p>

  <p>"Your companion!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"There was no companion," she faltered. "I thought it sounded better to
  speak of her. I had her place laid at table, but she never even existed."</p>

  <p>Peter tore off his coat.</p>

  <p>"There are the others in the room!" he exclaimed. "We must go back."</p>

  <p>Sogrange caught him by the shoulder and pointed to a shadowy group some
  distance away.</p>

  <p>"We are all out but Bernadine," he said. "For him were is no hope.
  Quick!"</p>

  <p>They sprang back only just in time. The outside wall of the house fell
  with a terrible crash. The room which they had quitted was blotted now out of
  existence. From right and left, in all directions along the country road,
  came the flashing of lights and little knots of hurrying people.</p>

  <p>"It is the end!" Peter muttered. "Yesterday I should have regretted the
  passing of a brave enemy. To-day I hail with joy the death of a brute."</p>

  <p>The Baroness, who had been sitting upon a garden seat, sobbing, came
  softly up to them. She laid her fingers upon Peter's arm imploringly.</p>

  <p>"You will not leave me friendless?" she begged. "The papers I promised you
  are destroyed, but many of his secrets are here."</p>

  <p>She tapped her forehead.</p>

  <p>"Madame," Peter answered, "I have no wish to know them. Years ago I swore
  that the passing of Bernadine should mark my own retirement from the world in
  which we both lived. I shall keep my word. To-night Bernadine is dead.
  To-night, Sogrange, my work is finished." The Baroness began to sob
  again.</p>

  <p>"And I thought that you were a man," she moaned, "so gallant, so
  honorable&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Madame," Sogrange intervened, "I shall commend you to the pension list of
  the Double-Four."</p>

  <p>She dried her eyes.</p>

  <p>"It is not money only I want," she whispered, her eyes following
  Peter.</p>

  <p>Sogrange shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You have never seen the Baroness de Grost?" he asked her.</p>

  <p>"But no!"</p>

  <p>"Ah!" Sogrange murmured.... "Our escort, madame, is at your
  service&mdash;as far as London."</p>
