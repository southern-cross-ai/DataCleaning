  <h2>I. DESPAIR AND INTEREST</h2>

  <p class="first">They stood upon the roof of a London boarding-house in the
  neighborhood of Russell Square&mdash;one of those grim shelters, the refuge
  of Transatlantic curiosity and British penury. The girl&mdash;she represented
  the former race was leaning against the frail palisading, with gloomy
  expression and eyes set as though in fixed contemplation of the uninspiring
  panorama. The young man&mdash;unmistakably, uncompromisingly
  English&mdash;stood with his back to the chimney a few feet away, watching
  his companion. The silence between them was as yet unbroken, had lasted,
  indeed, since she had stolen away from the shabby drawing-room below, where a
  florid lady with a raucous voice had been shouting a music-hall ditty. Close
  upon her heels, but without speech of any sort, he had followed. They were
  almost strangers, except for the occasional word or two of greeting which the
  etiquette of the establishment demanded. Yet she had accepted his espionage
  without any protest of word or look. He had followed her with a very definite
  object. Had she surmised it, he wondered? She had not turned her head or
  vouchsafed even a single question or remark to him since he had pushed his
  way through the trap-door almost at her heels and stepped out on to the
  leads. Yet it seemed to him that she must guess.</p>

  <p>Below them, what seemed to be the phantasm of a painted city, a wilderness
  of housetops, of smoke-wreathed spires and chimneys, stretched away to a
  murky, blood-red horizon. Even as they stood there, a deeper color stained
  the sky, an angry sun began to sink into the piled up masses of thick,
  vaporous clouds. The girl watched with an air of sullen yet absorbed
  interest. Her companion's eyes were still fixed wholly and critically upon
  her. Who was she, he wondered? Why had she left her own country to come to a
  city where she seemed to have no friends, no manner of interest? In that
  caravansary of the world's stricken ones she had been an almost unnoticed
  figure, silent, indisposed for conversation, not in any obvious manner
  attractive. Her clothes, notwithstanding their air of having come from a
  first-class dressmaker, were shabby and out of fashion, their extreme
  neatness in itself pathetic. She was thin, yet not without a certain buoyant
  lightness of movement always at variance with her tired eyes, her ceaseless
  air of dejection. And withal she was a rebel. It was written in her attitude,
  it was evident in her lowering, militant expression, the smouldering fire in
  her eyes proclaimed it. Her long, rather narrow face was gripped between her
  hands; her elbows rested upon the brick parapet. She gazed at that world of
  blood-red mists, of unshapely, grotesque buildings, of strange, tawdry
  colors; she listened to the medley of sounds&mdash;crude, shrill, insistent,
  something like the groaning of a world stripped naked&mdash;and she had all
  the time the air of one who hates the thing she looks upon.</p>

  <p>Tavernake, whose curiosity concerning his companion remained unappeased,
  decided that the moment for speech had arrived. He took a step forward upon
  the soft, pulpy leads. Even then he hesitated before he finally committed
  himself. About his appearance little was remarkable save the general air of
  determination which gave character to his undistinguished features. He was
  something above the medium height, broad-set, and with rather more thick
  black hair than he knew how to arrange advantageously. He wore a shirt which
  was somewhat frayed, and an indifferent tie; his boots were heavy and clumsy;
  he wore also a suit of ready-made clothes with the air of one who knew that
  they were ready-made and was satisfied with them. People of a nervous or
  sensitive disposition would, without doubt, have found him irritating but for
  a certain nameless gift&mdash;an almost Napoleonic concentration upon the
  things of the passing moment, which was in itself impressive and which
  somehow disarmed criticism.</p>

  <p>"About that bracelet!" he said at last.</p>

  <p>She moved her head and looked at him. A young man of less assurance would
  have turned and fled. Not so Tavernake. Once sure of his ground he was
  immovable. There was murder in her eyes but he was not even disturbed.</p>

  <p>"I saw you take it from the little table by the piano, you know," he
  continued. "It was rather a rash thing to do. Mrs. Fitzgerald was looking for
  it before I reached the stairs. I expect she has called the police in by
  now."</p>

  <p>Slowly her hand stole into the depths of her pocket and emerged. Something
  flashed for a moment high over her head. The young man caught her wrist just
  in time, caught it in a veritable grip of iron. Then, indeed, the evil fires
  flashed from her eyes, her teeth gleamed white, her bosom rose and fell in a
  storm of angry, unuttered sobs. She was dry-eyed and still speechless, but
  for all that she was a tigress. A strangely-cut silhouette they formed there
  upon the housetops, with a background of empty sky, their feet sinking in the
  warm leads.</p>

  <p>"I think I had better take it," he said. "Let go."</p>

  <p>Her fingers yielded the bracelet&mdash;a tawdry, ill-designed affair of
  rubies and diamonds. He looked at it disapprovingly.</p>

  <p>"That's an ugly thing to go to prison for," he remarked, slipping it into
  his pocket. "It was a stupid thing to do, anyhow, you know. You couldn't have
  got away with it&mdash;unless," he added, looking over the parapet as though
  struck with a sudden idea, "unless you had a confederate below."</p>

  <p>He heard the rush of her skirts and he was only just in time. Nothing, in
  fact, but a considerable amount of presence of mind and the full exercise of
  a strength which was continually providing surprises for his acquaintances,
  was sufficient to save her. Their struggles upon the very edge of the roof
  dislodged a brick from the palisading, which went hurtling down into the
  street. They both paused to watch it, his arms still gripping her and one
  foot pressed against an iron rod. It was immediately after they had seen it
  pitch harmlessly into the road that a new sensation came to this phlegmatic
  young man. For the first time in his life, he realized that it was possible
  to feel a certain pleasurable emotion in the close grasp of a being of the
  opposite sex. Consequently, although she had now ceased to struggle, he kept
  his arms locked around her, looking into her face with an interest intense
  enough, but more analytical than emotional, as though seeking to discover the
  meaning of this curious throbbing of his pulses. She herself, as though
  exhausted, remained quite passive, shivering a little in his grasp and
  breathing like a hunted animal whose last hour has come. Their eyes met; then
  she tore herself away.</p>

  <p>"You are a hateful person," she said deliberately, "a hateful, interfering
  person. I detest you."</p>

  <p>"I think that we will go down now," he replied.</p>

  <p>He raised the trap-door and glanced at her significantly. She held her
  skirts closely together and passed through it without looking at him. She
  stepped lightly down the ladder and without hesitation descended also a
  flight of uncarpeted attic stairs. Here, however, upon the landing, she
  awaited him with obvious reluctance.</p>

  <p>"Are you going to send for the police?" she asked without looking at
  him.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"If I had meant to give you away I should have told Mrs. Fitzgerald at
  once that I had seen you take her bracelet, instead of following you out on
  to the roof."</p>

  <p>"Do you mind telling me what you do propose to do, then?" she continued
  still without looking at him, still without the slightest note of appeal in
  her tone.</p>

  <p>He withdrew the bracelet from his pocket and balanced it upon his
  finger.</p>

  <p>"I am going to say that I took it for a joke," he declared.</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Fitzgerald's sense of humor is not elastic," she warned him.</p>

  <p>"She will be very angry, of course," he assented, "but she will not
  believe that I meant to steal it."</p>

  <p>The girl moved slowly a few steps away.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that I ought to thank you," she said, still with averted face
  and sullen manner. "You have really been very decent. I am much obliged."</p>

  <p>"Are you not coming down?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Not at present," she answered. "I am going to my room."</p>

  <p>He looked around the landing on which they stood, at the miserable,
  uncarpeted floor, the ill-painted doors on which the long-forgotten varnish
  stood out in blisters, the jumble of dilapidated hot-water cans, a mop, and a
  medley of brooms and rags all thrown down together in a corner.</p>

  <p>"But these are the servants' quarters, surely," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"They are good enough for me; my room is here," she told him, turning the
  handle of one of the doors and disappearing. The prompt turning of the key
  sounded, he thought, a little ungracious.</p>

  <p>With the bracelet in his hand, Tavernake descended three more flights of
  stairs and entered the drawing-room of the private hotel conducted by Mrs.
  Raithby Lawrence, whose husband, one learned from her frequent reiteration of
  the fact, had once occupied a distinguished post in the Merchant Service of
  his country. The disturbance following upon the disappearance of the bracelet
  was evidently at its height. There were at least a dozen people in the room,
  most of whom were standing up. The central figure of them all was Mrs.
  Fitzgerald, large and florid, whose yellow hair with its varied shades
  frankly admitted its indebtedness to peroxide; a lady of the dashing type,
  who had once made her mark in the music-halls, but was now happily married to
  a commercial traveler who was seldom visible. Mrs. Fitzgerald was
  talking.</p>

  <p>"In respectable boarding-houses, Mrs. Lawrence," she declared with great
  emphasis, "thefts may sometimes take place, I will admit, in the servants'
  quarters, and with all their temptations, poor things, it's not so much to be
  wondered at. But no such thing as this has ever happened to me
  before&mdash;to have jewelry taken almost from my person in the drawing-room
  of what should be a well-conducted establishment. Not a servant in the room,
  remember, from the moment I took it off until I got up from the piano and
  found it missing. It's your guests you've got to look after, Mrs. Lawrence,
  sorry to say it though I am."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Lawrence managed here, through sheer loss of breath on the part of
  her assailant, to interpose a tearful protest.</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure," she protested feebly, "that there is not a person in
  this house who would dream of stealing anything, however valuable it was. I
  am most particular always about references."</p>

  <p>"Valuable, indeed!" Mrs. Fitzgerald continued with increased volubility.
  "I'd have you understand that I am not one of those who wear trumpery
  jewelry. Thirty-five guineas that bracelet cost me if it cost a penny, and if
  my husband were only at home I could show you the receipt."</p>

  <p>Then there came an interruption of almost tragical interest. Mrs.
  Fitzgerald, her mouth still open, her stream of eloquence suddenly arrested,
  stood with her artificially darkened eyes riveted upon the stolid,
  self-composed figure in the doorway. Every one else was gazing in the same
  direction. Tavernake was holding the bracelet in the palm of his hand.</p>

  <p>"Thirty-five guineas!" he repeated. "If I had known that it was worth as
  much as that, I do not think that I should have dared to touch it."</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you took it!" Mrs. Fitzgerald gasped.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he admitted, "that it was rather a clumsy joke. I
  apologize, Mrs. Fitzgerald. I hope you did not really imagine that it had
  been stolen."</p>

  <p>One was conscious of the little thrill of emotion which marked the
  termination of the episode. Most of the people not directly concerned were
  disappointed; they were being robbed of their excitement, their hopes of a
  tragical denouement were frustrated. Mrs. Lawrence's worn face plainly showed
  her relief. The lady with the yellow hair, on the other hand, who had now
  succeeded in working herself up into a towering rage, snatched the bracelet
  from the young man's fingers and with a purple flush in her cheeks was
  obviously struggling with an intense desire to box his ears.</p>

  <p>"That's not good enough for a tale!" she exclaimed harshly. "I tell you I
  don't believe a word of it. Took it for a joke, indeed! I only wish my
  husband were here; he'd know what to do."</p>

  <p>"Your husband couldn't do much more than get your bracelet back, ma'am,"
  Mrs. Lawrence replied with acerbity. "Such a fuss and calling every one
  thieves, too! I'd be ashamed to be so suspicious."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fitzgerald glared haughtily at her hostess.</p>

  <p>"It's all very well for those that don't possess any jewelry and don't
  know the value of it, to talk," she declared, with her eyes fixed upon a
  black jet ornament which hung from the other woman's neck. "What I say is
  this, and you may just as well hear it from me now as later. I don't believe
  this cock-and-bull story of Mr. Tavernake's. Them as took my bracelet from
  that table meant keeping it, only they hadn't the courage. And I'm not
  referring to you, Mr. Tavernake," the lady continued vigorously, "because I
  don't believe you took it, for all your talk about a joke. And whom you may
  be shielding it wouldn't take me two guesses to name, and your motive must be
  clear to every one. The common hussy!"</p>

  <p>"You are exciting yourself unnecessarily, Mrs. Fitzgerald," Tavernake
  remarked. "Let me assure you that it was I who took your bracelet from that
  table."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Fitzgerald regarded him scornfully.</p>

  <p>"Do you expect me to believe a tale like that?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" Tavernake replied. "It is the truth. I am sorry that you have
  been so upset&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It is not the truth!"</p>

  <p>More sensation! Another unexpected entrance! Once more interest in the
  affair was revived. After all, the lookers-on felt that they were not to be
  robbed of their tragedy. An old lady with yellow cheeks and jet black eyes
  leaned forward with her hand to her ear, anxious not to miss a syllable of
  what was coming. Tavernake bit his lip; it was the girl from the roof who had
  entered the room.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt," she continued in a cool, clear tone, "that Mrs.
  Fitzgerald's first guess would have been correct. I took the bracelet. I did
  not take it for a joke, I did not take it because I admire it&mdash;I think
  it is hideously ugly. I took it because I had no money."</p>

  <p>She paused and looked around at them all, quietly, yet with something in
  her face from which they all shrank. She stood where the light fell full upon
  her shabby black gown and dejected-looking hat. The hollows in her pale
  cheeks, and the faint rims under her eyes, were clearly manifest; but
  notwithstanding her fragile appearance, she held herself with composure and
  even dignity. Twenty&mdash;thirty seconds must have passed whilst she stood
  there, slowly finishing the buttoning of her gloves. No one attempted to
  break the silence. She dominated them all&mdash;they felt that she had
  something more to say. Even Mrs. Fitzgerald felt a weight upon her
  tongue.</p>

  <p>"It was a clumsy attempt," she went on. "I should have had no idea where
  to raise money upon the thing, but I apologize to you, nevertheless, Mrs.
  Fitzgerald, for the anxiety which my removal of your valuable property must
  have caused you," she added, turning to the owner of the bracelet, whose
  cheeks were once more hot with anger at the contempt in the girl's tone. "I
  suppose I ought to thank you, Mr. Tavernake, also, for your well-meant effort
  to preserve my character. In future, that shall be my sole charge. Has any
  one anything more to say to me before I go?"</p>

  <p>Somehow or other, no one had. Mrs. Fitzgerald was irritated and fuming,
  but she contented herself with a snort. Her speech was ready enough as a
  rule, but there was a look in this girl's eyes from which she was glad enough
  to turn away. Mrs. Lawrence made a weak attempt at a farewell.</p>

  <p>"I am sure," she began, "we are all sorry for what's occurred and that you
  must go&mdash;not that perhaps it isn't better, under the circumstances," she
  added hastily. "As regards&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"There is nothing owing to you," the girl interrupted calmly. "You may
  congratulate yourself upon that, for if there were you would not get it. Nor
  have I stolen anything else."</p>

  <p>"About your luggage?" Mrs. Lawrence asked.</p>

  <p>"When I need it, I will send for it," the girl replied.</p>

  <p>She turned her back upon them and before they realized it she was gone.
  She had, indeed, something of the grand manner. She had come to plead guilty
  to a theft and she had left them all feeling a little like snubbed children.
  Mrs. Fitzgerald, as soon as the spell of the girl's presence was removed, was
  one of the first to recover herself. She felt herself beginning to grow hot
  with renewed indignation.</p>

  <p>"A thief!" she exclaimed looking around the room. "Just an ordinary
  self-convicted thief! That's what I call her, and nothing else. And here we
  all stood like a lot of ninnies. Why, if I'd done my duty I'd have locked the
  door and sent for a policeman."</p>

  <p>"Too late now, anyway," Mrs. Lawrence declared. "She's gone for good, and
  no mistake. Walked right out of the house. I heard her slam the front
  door."</p>

  <p>"And a good job, too," Mrs. Fitzgerald armed. "We don't want any of her
  sort here&mdash;not those who've got things of value about them. I bet she
  didn't leave America for nothing."</p>

  <p>A little gray-haired lady, who had not as yet spoken, and who very seldom
  took part in any discussion at all, looked up from her knitting. She was
  desperately poor but she had charitable instincts.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what made her want to steal," she remarked quietly.</p>

  <p>"A born thief," Mrs. Fitzgerald declared with conviction,&mdash;"a real
  bad lot. One of your sly-looking ones, I call her."</p>

  <p>The little lady sighed.</p>

  <p>"When I was better off," she continued, "I used to help at a soup kitchen
  in Poplar. I have never forgotten a certain look we used to see occasionally
  in the faces of some of the men and women. I found out what it meant&mdash;it
  was hunger. Once or twice lately I have passed the girl who has just gone
  out, upon the stairs, and she almost frightened me. She had just the same
  look in her eyes. I noticed it yesterday&mdash;it was just before dinner,
  too&mdash;but she never came down."</p>

  <p>"She paid so much for her room and extra for meals," Mrs. Lawrence said
  thoughtfully. "She never would have a meal unless she paid for it at the
  time. To tell you the truth, I was feeling a bit uneasy about her. She hasn't
  been in the dining-room for two days, and from what they tell me there's no
  signs of her having eaten anything in her room. As for getting anything out,
  why should she? It would be cheaper for her here than anywhere, if she'd got
  any money at all."</p>

  <p>There was an uncomfortable silence. The little old lady with the knitting
  looked down the street into the sultry darkness which had swallowed up the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether Mr. Tavernake knows anything about her," some one
  suggested.</p>

  <p>But Tavernake was not in the room.</p>

  <h2>II. A T&Ecirc;TE-&Agrave;-T&Ecirc;TE SUPPER</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake caught her up in New Oxford Street and fell at
  once into step with her. He wasted no time whatever upon preliminaries.</p>

  <p>"I should be glad," he said, "if you would tell me your name."</p>

  <p>Her first glance at him was fierce enough to have terrified a different
  sort of man. Upon Tavernake it had absolutely no effect.</p>

  <p>"You need not unless you like, of course," he went on, "but I wish to talk
  to you for a few moments and I thought that it would be more convenient if I
  addressed you by name. I do not remember to have heard it mentioned at
  Blenheim House, and Mrs. Lawrence, as you know, does not introduce her
  guests."</p>

  <p>By this time they had walked a score or so of paces together. The girl,
  after her first furious glance, had taken absolutely no notice of him except
  to quicken her pace a little. Tavernake remained by her side, however,
  showing not the slightest sense of embarrassment or annoyance. He seemed
  perfectly content to wait and he had not in the least the appearance of a man
  who could be easily shaken off. From a fit of furious anger she passed
  suddenly and without warning to a state of half hysterical amusement.</p>

  <p>"You are a foolish, absurd person," she declared. "Please go away. I do
  not wish you to walk with me."</p>

  <p>Tavernake remained imperturbable. She remembered suddenly his intervention
  on her behalf.</p>

  <p>"If you insist upon knowing," she said, "my name at Blenheim House was
  Beatrice Burnay. I am much obliged to you for what you did for me there, but
  that is finished. I do not wish to have any conversation with you, and I
  absolutely object to your company. Please leave me at once."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he answered, "but that is not possible."</p>

  <p>"Not possible?" she repeated, wonderingly.</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You have no money, you have eaten no dinner, and I do not believe that
  you have any idea where you are going," he declared, deliberately.</p>

  <p>Her face was once more dark with anger.</p>

  <p>"Even if that were the truth," she insisted, "tell me what concern it is
  of yours? Your reminding me of these facts is simply an impertinence."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry that you look upon it in that light," he remarked, still
  without the least sign of discomposure. "We will, if you do not mind, waive
  the discussion for the moment. Do you prefer a small restaurant or a corner
  in a big one? There is music at Frascati's but there are not so many people
  in the smaller ones."</p>

  <p>She turned half around upon the pavement and looked at him steadfastly.
  His personality was at last beginning to interest her. His square jaw and
  measured speech were indices of a character at least unusual. She recognized
  certain invincible qualities under an exterior absolutely commonplace.</p>

  <p>"Are you as persistent about everything in life?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>"Why not?" he replied. "I try always to be consistent."</p>

  <p>"What is your name?"</p>

  <p>"Leonard Tavernake," he answered, promptly.</p>

  <p>"Are you well off&mdash;I mean moderately well off?"</p>

  <p>"I have a quite sufficient income."</p>

  <p>"Have you any one dependent upon you?"</p>

  <p>"Not a soul," he declared. "I am my own master in every sense of the
  word."</p>

  <p>She laughed in an odd sort of way.</p>

  <p>"Then you shall pay for your persistence," she said,&mdash;"I mean that I
  may as well rob you of a sovereign as the restaurant people."</p>

  <p>"You must tell me now where you would like to go to," he insisted. "It is
  getting late."</p>

  <p>"I do not like these foreign places," she replied. "I should prefer to go
  to the grill-room of a good restaurant."</p>

  <p>"We will take a taxicab," he announced. "You have no objection?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"If you have the money and don't mind spending it," she said, "I will
  admit that I have had all the walking I want. Besides, the toe of my boot is
  worn through and I find it painful. Yesterday I tramped ten miles trying to
  find a man who was getting up a concert party for the provinces."</p>

  <p>"And did you find him?" he asked, hailing a cab.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I found him," she answered, indifferently. "We went through the
  usual programme. He heard me sing, tried to kiss me and promised to let me
  know. Nobody ever refuses anything in my profession, you see. They promise to
  let you know."</p>

  <p>"Are you a singer, then, or an actress?"</p>

  <p>"I am neither," she told him. "I said 'my profession' because it is the
  only one to which I have ever tried to belong. I have never succeeded in
  obtaining an engagement in this country. I do not suppose that even if I had
  persevered I should ever have had one."</p>

  <p>"You have given up the idea, then," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"I have given it up," she admitted, a little curtly. "Please do not think,
  because I am allowing you to be my companion for a short time, that you may
  ask me questions. How fast these taxies go!"</p>

  <p>They drew up at their destination&mdash;a well-known restaurant in Regent
  Street. He paid the cabman and they descended a flight of stairs into the
  grill-room.</p>

  <p>"I hope that this place will suit you," he said. "I have not much
  experience of restaurants."</p>

  <p>She looked around and nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, "I think that it will do."</p>

  <p>She was very shabbily dressed, and he, although his appearance was by no
  means ordinary, was certainly not of the type which inspires immediate
  respect in even the grill-room of a fashionable restaurant. Nevertheless,
  they received prompt and almost officious service. Tavernake, as he watched
  his companion's air, her manner of seating herself and accepting the
  attentions of the head waiter, felt that nameless impulse which was
  responsible for his having followed her from Blenheim House and which he
  could only call curiosity, becoming stronger. An exceedingly matter-of-fact
  person, he was also by instinct and habit observant. He never doubted but
  that she belonged to a class of society from which the guests at the
  boarding-house where they had both lived were seldom recruited, and of which
  he himself knew little. He was not in the least a snob, this young man, but
  he found the fact interesting. Life with him was already very much the same
  as a ledger account&mdash;a matter of debits and credits, and he had never
  failed to include among the latter that curious gift of breeding for which he
  himself, denied it by heritage, had somehow substituted a complete and
  exceedingly rare naturalness.</p>

  <p>"I should like," she announced, laying down the carte, "a fried sole, some
  cutlets, an ice, and black coffee."</p>

  <p>The waiter bowed.</p>

  <p>"And for Monsieur?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake glanced at his watch; it was already ten o'clock.</p>

  <p>"I will take the same," he declared.</p>

  <p>"And to drink?"</p>

  <p>She seemed indifferent.</p>

  <p>"Any light wine," she answered, carelessly, "white or red."</p>

  <p>Tavernake took up the wine list and ordered sauterne. They were left alone
  in their corner for a few minutes, almost the only occupants of the
  place.</p>

  <p>"You are sure that you can afford this?" she asked, looking at him
  critically. "It may cost you a sovereign or thirty shillings."</p>

  <p>He studied the prices on the menu.</p>

  <p>"I can afford it quite well and I have plenty of money with me," he
  assured her, "but I do not think that it will cost more than eighteen
  shillings. While we are waiting for the sole, shall we talk? I can tell you,
  if you choose to hear, why I followed you from the boardinghouse."</p>

  <p>"I don't mind listening to you," she told him, "or I will talk with you
  about anything you like. There is only one subject which I cannot discuss;
  that subject is myself and my own doings."</p>

  <p>Tavernake was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"That makes conversation a bit difficult," he remarked. She leaned back in
  her chair.</p>

  <p>"After this evening," she said, "I go out of your life as completely and
  finally as though I had never existed. I have a fancy to take my poor secrets
  with me. If you wish to talk, tell me about yourself. You have gone out of
  your way to be kind to me. I wonder why. It doesn't seem to be your
  role."</p>

  <p>He smiled slowly. His face was fashioned upon broad lines and the relaxing
  of his lips lightened it wonderfully. He had good teeth, clear gray eyes, and
  coarse black hair which he wore a trifle long; his forehead was too massive
  for good looks.</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted, "I do not think that benevolence is one of my
  characteristics."</p>

  <p>Her dark eyes were turned full upon him; her red lips, redder than ever
  they seemed against the pallor of her cheeks and her deep brown hair, curled
  slightly. There was something almost insolent in her tone.</p>

  <p>"You understand, I hope," she continued, "that you have nothing whatever
  to look for from me in return for this sum which you propose to expend for my
  entertainment?"</p>

  <p>"I understand that," he replied.</p>

  <p>"Not even gratitude," she persisted. "I really do not feel grateful to
  you. You are probably doing this to gratify some selfish interest or
  curiosity. I warn you that I am quite incapable of any of the proper
  sentiments of life."</p>

  <p>"Your gratitude would be of no value to me whatever," he assured her.</p>

  <p>She was still not wholly satisfied. His complete stolidity frustrated
  every effort she made to penetrate beneath the surface.</p>

  <p>"If I believed," she went on, "that you were one of those men&mdash;the
  world is full of them, you know&mdash;who will help a woman with a reasonable
  appearance so long as it does not seriously interfere with their own
  comfort&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Your sex has nothing whatever to do with it," he interrupted. "As to your
  appearance, I have not even considered it. I could not tell you whether you
  are beautiful or ugly&mdash;I am no judge of these matters. What I have done,
  I have done because it pleased me to do it."</p>

  <p>"Do you always do what pleases you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Nearly always."</p>

  <p>She looked him over again attentively, with an interest obviously
  impersonal, a trifle supercilious.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," she remarked, "you consider yourself one of the strong people
  of the world?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know about that," he answered. "I do not often think about
  myself."</p>

  <p>"I mean," she explained, "that you are one of those people who struggle
  hard to get just what they want in life."</p>

  <p>His jaw suddenly tightened and she saw the likeness to Napoleon.</p>

  <p>"I do more than struggle," he affirmed, "I succeed. If I make up my mind
  to do a thing, I do it; if I make up my mind to get a thing, I get it. It
  means hard work sometimes, but that is all."</p>

  <p>For the first time, a really natural interest shone out of her eyes. The
  half sulky contempt with which she had received his advances passed away. She
  became at that moment a human being, self-forgetting, the heritage of her
  charms&mdash;for she really had a curious but very poignant
  attractiveness&mdash;suddenly evident. It was only a momentary lapse and it
  was entirely wasted. Not even one of the waiters happened to be looking that
  way, and Tavernake was thinking wholly of himself.</p>

  <p>"It is a good deal to say&mdash;that," she remarked, reflectively.</p>

  <p>"It is a good deal but it is not too much," he declared. "Every man who
  takes life seriously should say it."</p>

  <p>Then she laughed&mdash;actually laughed&mdash;and he had a vision of
  flashing white teeth, of a mouth breaking into pleasant curves, of dark
  mirth-lit eyes, lustreless no longer, provocative, inspiring. A vague
  impression as of something pleasant warmed his blood. It was a rare thing for
  him to be so stirred, but even then it was not sufficient to disturb the
  focus of his thoughts.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she demanded, "what do you do? What is your profession or
  work?"</p>

  <p>"I am with a firm of auctioneers and estate agents," he answered
  readily,&mdash;"Messrs. Dowling, Spence &amp; Company the name is. Our
  offices are in Waterloo Place."</p>

  <p>"You find it interesting?"</p>

  <p>"Of course," he answered. "Interesting? Why not? I work at it."</p>

  <p>"Are you a partner?"</p>

  <p>"No," he admitted. "Six years ago I was a carpenter; then I became an
  errand boy in Mr. Dowling's office I had to learn the business, you see.
  To-day I am a sort of manager. In eighteen months' time&mdash;perhaps before
  that if they do not offer me a partnership&mdash;I shall start for
  myself."</p>

  <p>Once more the subtlest of smiles flickered at the corners of her lips.</p>

  <p>"Do they know yet?" she asked, with faint irony.</p>

  <p>"Not yet," he replied, with absolute seriousness. "They might tell me to
  go, and I have a few things to learn yet. I would rather make experiments for
  some one else than for myself. I can use the results later; they will help me
  to make money."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly and wiped the tears out of her eyes. They were really
  very beautiful eyes notwithstanding the dark rims encircling them.</p>

  <p>"If only I had met you before!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me," she begged. "It would not be good for your conceit, if you
  have any, to tell you."</p>

  <p>"I have no conceit and I am not inquisitive," he said, "but I do not see
  why you laughed."</p>

  <p>Their period of waiting came to an end at this point. The fish was brought
  and their conversation became disjointed. In the silence which followed, the
  old shadow crept over her face. Once only it lifted. It was while they were
  waiting for the cutlets. She leaned towards him, her elbows upon the
  tablecloth, her face supported by her fingers.</p>

  <p>"I think that it is time we left these generalities," she insisted, "and
  you told me something rather more personal, something which I am very anxious
  to know. Tell me exactly why so self-centered a person as yourself should
  interest himself in a fellow-creature at all. It seems odd to me."</p>

  <p>"It is odd," he admitted, frankly. "I will try to explain it to you but it
  will sound very bald, and I do not think that you will understand. I watched
  you a few nights ago out on the roof at Blenheim House. You were looking
  across the house-tops and you didn't seem to be seeing anything at all
  really, and yet all the time I knew that you were seeing things I couldn't,
  you were understanding and appreciating something which I knew nothing of,
  and it worried me. I tried to talk to you that evening, but you were
  rude."</p>

  <p>"You really are a curious person," she remarked. "Are you always worried,
  then, if you find that some one else is seeing things or understanding things
  which are outside your comprehension?"</p>

  <p>"Always," he replied promptly.</p>

  <p>"You are too far-reaching," she affirmed. "You want to gather everything
  into your life. You cannot. You will only be unhappy if you try. No man can
  do it. You must learn your limitations or suffer all your days."</p>

  <p>"Limitations!" He repeated the words with measureless scorn. "If I learn
  them at all," he declared, with unexpected force, "it will be with scars and
  bruises, for nothing else will content me."</p>

  <p>"We are, I should say, almost the same age," she remarked slowly.</p>

  <p>"I am twenty-five," he told her.</p>

  <p>"I am twenty-two," she said. "It seems strange that two people whose ideas
  of life are as far apart as the Poles should have come together like this
  even for a moment. I do not understand it at all. Did you expect that I
  should tell you just what I saw in the clouds that night?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "not exactly. I have spoken of my first interest in you
  only. There are other things. I told a lie about the bracelet and I followed
  you out of the boarding-house and I brought you here, for some other for
  quite a different reason."</p>

  <p>"Tell me what it was," she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I do not know it myself," he declared solemnly. "I really and honestly do
  not know it. It is because I hoped that it might come to me while we were
  together, that I am here with you at this moment. I do not like impulses
  which I do not understand."</p>

  <p>She laughed at him a little scornfully.</p>

  <p>"After all," she said, "although it may not have dawned upon you yet, it
  is probably the same wretched reason. You are a man and you have the poison
  somewhere in your blood. I am really not bad-looking, you know."</p>

  <p>He looked at her critically. She was a little over-slim, perhaps, but she
  was certainly wonderfully graceful. Even the poise of her head, the manner in
  which she leaned back in her chair, had its individuality. Her features, too,
  were good, though her mouth had grown a trifle hard. For the first time the
  dead pallor of her cheeks was relieved by a touch of color. Even Tavernake
  realized that there were great possibilities about her. Nevertheless, he
  shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I do not agree with you in the least," he asserted firmly. "Your looks
  have nothing to do with it. I am sure that it is not that."</p>

  <p>"Let me cross-examine you," she suggested. "Think carefully now. Does it
  give you no pleasure at all to be sitting here alone with me?"</p>

  <p>He answered her deliberately; it was obvious that he was speaking the
  truth.</p>

  <p>"I am not conscious that it does," he declared. "The only feeling I am
  aware of at the present moment in connection with you, is the curiosity of
  which I have already spoken."</p>

  <p>She leaned a little towards him, extending her very shapely fingers. Once
  more the smile at her lips transformed her face.</p>

  <p>"Look at my hand," she said. "Tell me&mdash;wouldn't you like to hold it
  just for a minute, if I gave it you?"</p>

  <p>Her eyes challenged his, softly and yet imperiously. His whole attention,
  however, seemed to be absorbed by her finger-nails. It seemed strange to him
  that a girl in her straits should have devoted so much care to her hands.</p>

  <p>"No," he answered deliberately, "I have no wish to hold your hand. Why
  should I?"</p>

  <p>"Look at me," she insisted.</p>

  <p>He did so without embarrassment or hesitation,&mdash;it was more than ever
  apparent that he was entirely truthful. She leaned back in her chair,
  laughing softly to herself.</p>

  <p>"Oh, my friend Mr. Leonard Tavernake," she exclaimed, "if you were not so
  crudely, so adorably, so miraculously truthful, what a prig, prig, prig, you
  would be! The cutlets at last, thank goodness! Your cross-examination is
  over. I pronounce you 'Not Guilty!"'</p>

  <p>During the progress of the rest of the meal, they talked very little. At
  its conclusion, Tavernake discharged the bill, having carefully checked each
  item and tipped the waiter the exact amount which the man had the right to
  expect. They ascended the stairs together to the street, the girl lingering a
  few steps behind. On the pavement her fingers touched his arm.</p>

  <p>"I wonder, would you mind driving me down to the Embankment?" she asked
  almost humbly. "It was so close down there and I want some air."</p>

  <p>This was an extravagance which he had scarcely contemplated, but he did
  not hesitate. He called a taxicab and seated himself by her side. Her manner
  seemed to have grown quieter and more subdued, her tone was no longer
  semi-belligerent.</p>

  <p>"I will not keep you much longer," she promised. "I suppose I am not so
  strong as I used to be. I have had scarcely anything to eat for two days and
  conversation has become an unknown luxury. I think&mdash;it seems
  absurd&mdash;but I think that I am feeling a little faint."</p>

  <p>"The air will soon revive you," he said. "As to our conversation, I am
  disappointed. I think that you are very foolish not to tell me more about
  yourself."</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes, ignoring his remark. They turned presently into a
  narrower thoroughfare. She leaned towards him.</p>

  <p>"You have been very good to me," she admitted almost timidly, "and I am
  afraid that I have not been very gracious. We shall not see one another again
  after this evening. I wonder&mdash;would you care to kiss me?"</p>

  <p>He opened his lips and closed them again. He sat quite still, his eyes
  fixed upon the road ahead, until he had strangled something absolutely
  absurd, something unrecognizable.</p>

  <p>"I would rather not," he decided quietly. "I know you mean to be kind but
  that sort of thing&mdash;well, I don't think I understand it. Besides," he
  added with a sudden naive relief, as he clutched at a fugitive but plausible
  thought, "if I did you would not believe the things which I have been telling
  you."</p>

  <p>He had a curious idea that she was disappointed as she turned her head
  away, but she said nothing. Arrived at the Embankment, the cab came slowly to
  a standstill. The girl descended. There was something new in her manner; she
  looked away from him when she spoke.</p>

  <p>"You had better leave me here," she said. "I am going to sit upon that
  seat."</p>

  <p>Then came those few seconds' hesitation which were to count for a great
  deal in his life. The impulse which bade him stay with her was unaccountable
  but it conquered.</p>

  <p>"If you do not object," he remarked with some stiffness, "I should like to
  sit here with you for a little time. There is certainly a breeze."</p>

  <p>She made no comment but walked on. He paid the man and followed her to the
  empty seat. Opposite, some illuminated advertisements blazed their unsightly
  message across the murky sky. Between the two curving rows of yellow lights
  the river flowed&mdash;black, turgid, hopeless. Even here, though they had
  escaped from its absolute thrall, the far-away roar of the city beat upon
  their ears. She listened to it for a moment and then pressed her hands to the
  side of her head.</p>

  <p>"Oh, how I hate it!" she moaned. "The voices, always the voices, calling,
  threatening, beating you away! Take my hands, Leonard Tavernake,&mdash;hold
  me."</p>

  <p>He did as she bade him, clumsily, as yet without comprehension.</p>

  <p>"You are not well," he muttered.</p>

  <p>Her eyes opened and a flash of her old manner returned. She smiled at him,
  feebly but derisively.</p>

  <p>"You foolish boy!" she cried. "Can't you see that I am dying? Hold my
  hands tightly and watch&mdash;watch! Here is one more thing you can
  see&mdash;that you cannot understand."</p>

  <p>He saw the empty phial slip from her sleeve and fall on to the pavement.
  With a cry he sprang up and, carrying her in his arms, rushed out into the
  road.</p>

  <h2>III. AN UNPLEASANT MEETING</h2>

  <p class="first">It was a quarter past eleven and the theatres were
  disgorging their usual nightly crowds. The most human thoroughfare in any of
  the world's great cities was at its best and brightest. Everywhere
  commissionaires were blowing their whistles, the streets were thronged with
  slowly-moving vehicles, the pavements were stirring with life. The little
  crowd which had gathered in front of the chemist's shop was swept away. After
  all, none of them knew exactly what they had been waiting for. There was a
  rumor that a woman had fainted or had met with an accident. Certainly she had
  been carried into the shop and into the inner room, the door of which was
  still closed. A few passers-by had gathered together and stared and waited
  for a few minutes, but had finally lost interest and melted away. A human
  thoroughfare, this, indeed, one of the pulses of the great city beating time
  night and day to the tragedies of life. The chemist's assistant, with
  impassive features, was serving a couple of casual customers from behind the
  counter. Only a few yards away, beyond the closed door, the chemist himself
  and a hastily summoned doctor fought with Death for the body of the girl who
  lay upon the floor, faint moans coming every now and then from her blue
  lips.</p>

  <p>Tavernake, whose forced inaction during that terrible struggle had become
  a burden to him, slipped softly from the room as soon as the doctor had
  whispered that the acute crisis was over, and passed through the shop out
  into the street, a solemn, dazed figure among the light-hearted crowd. Even
  in those grim moments, the man's individualism spoke up to him. He was
  puzzled at his own action, He asked himself a question&mdash;not, indeed,
  with regret, but with something more than curiosity and actual
  selfprobing&mdash;as though, by concentrating his mind upon his recent course
  of action, he would be able to understand the motives which had influenced
  him. Why had he chosen to burden himself with the care of this desperate
  young woman? Supposing she lived, what was to become of her? He had acquired
  a certain definite responsibility with regard to her future, for whatever the
  doctor and his assistant might do, it was his own promptitude and presence of
  mind which had given her the first chance of life. Without a doubt, he had
  behaved foolishly. Why not vanish into the crowd and have done with it? What
  was it to him, after all, whether this girl lived or died? He had done his
  duty&mdash;more than his duty. Why not disappear now and let her take her
  chance? His common sense spoke to him loudly; such thoughts as these beat
  upon his brain.</p>

  <p>Just for once in his life, however, his common sense exercised an
  altogether subordinate position. He knew very well, even while he listened to
  these voices, that he was only counting the minutes until he could return.
  Having absolutely decided that the only reasonable course left for him to
  pursue was to return home and leave the girl to her fate, he found himself
  back inside the shop within a quarter of an hour. The chemist had just come
  out from the inner room, and looked up at his entrance.</p>

  <p>"She'll do now," he announced.</p>

  <p>Tavernake nodded. He was amazed at his own sense of relief.</p>

  <p>"I am glad," he declared.</p>

  <p>The doctor joined them, his black bag in his hand, prepared for departure.
  He addressed himself to Tavernake as the responsible person.</p>

  <p>"The young lady will be all right now," he said, "but she may be rather
  queer for a day or two. Fortunately, she made the usual mistake of people who
  are ignorant of medicine and its effects&mdash;she took enough poison to kill
  a whole household. You had better take care of her, young man," he added
  dryly. "She'll be getting into trouble if she tries this sort of thing
  again."</p>

  <p>"Will she need any special attention during the next few days?" Tavernake
  asked. "The circumstances under which I brought her here are a little
  unusual, and I am not quite sure&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Take her home to bed," the doctor interrupted, "and you'll find she'll
  sleep it off. She seems to have a splendid constitution, although she has let
  herself run down. If you need any further advice and your own medical man is
  not available, I will come and see her if you send for me. Camden, my name
  is; telephone number 734 Gerrard."</p>

  <p>"I should be glad to know the amount of your fee, if you please,"
  Tavernake said.</p>

  <p>"My fee is two guineas," the doctor answered.</p>

  <p>Tavernake paid him and he went away. Already the shadow of the tragedy was
  passing. The chemist had joined his assistant and was busy dispensing drugs
  behind his counter.</p>

  <p>"You can go in to the young lady, if you like," he remarked to Tavernake.
  "I dare say she'll feel better to have some one with her."</p>

  <p>Tavernake passed slowly into the inner room, closing the door behind him.
  He was scarcely prepared for so piteous a sight. The girl's face was white
  and drawn as she lay upon the couch to which they had lifted her. The
  fighting spirit was dead; she was in a state of absolute and complete
  collapse. She opened her eyes at his coning, but closed them again almost
  immediately&mdash;less, it seemed, from any consciousness of his presence
  than from sheer exhaustion.</p>

  <p>"I am glad that you are better," he whispered crossing the room to her
  side.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she murmured almost inaudibly.</p>

  <p>Tavernake stood looking down upon her, and his sense of perplexity
  increased. Stretched on the hard horsehair couch she seemed, indeed,
  pitifully thin and younger than her years. The scowl, which had passed from
  her face, had served in some measure as a disguise.</p>

  <p>"We shall have to leave here in a few minutes," he said, softly. "They
  will want to close the shop."</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry," she faltered, "to have given you all this trouble. You
  must send me to a hospital or the workhouse&mdash;anywhere."</p>

  <p>"You are sure that there are no friends to whom I can send?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"There is no one!"</p>

  <p>She closed her eyes and Tavernake sat quite still on the end of her couch,
  his elbow upon his knee, his head resting upon his hand. Presently, the rush
  of customers having ceased, the chemist came in.</p>

  <p>"I think, if I were you, I should take her home now," he remarked. "She'll
  probably drop off to sleep very soon and wake up much stronger. I have made
  up a prescription here in case of exhaustion."</p>

  <p>Tavernake stared at the man. Take her home! His sense of humor was faint
  enough but he found himself trying to imagine the faces of Mrs. Lawrence or
  Mrs. Fitzgerald if he should return with her to the boardinghouse at such an
  hour.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know where she lives?" the chemist inquired curiously.</p>

  <p>"Of course," Tavernake assented. "You are quite right. I dare say she is
  strong enough now to walk as far as the pavement."</p>

  <p>He paid the bill for the medicines, and they lifted her from the couch.
  Between them she walked slowly into the outer shop. Then she began to drag on
  their arms and she looked up at the chemist a little piteously.</p>

  <p>"May I sit down for a moment?" she begged. "I feel faint."</p>

  <p>They placed her in one of the cane chairs facing the door. The chemist
  mixed her some sal volatile.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," she murmured, "so sorry. In a few minutes&mdash;I shall be
  better."</p>

  <p>Outside, the throng of pedestrians had grown less, but from the great
  restaurant opposite a constant stream of motor-cars and carriages was slowly
  bringing away the supper guests. Tavernake stood at the door, watching them
  idly. The traffic was momentarily blocked and almost opposite to him a
  motor-car, the simple magnificence of which filled him with wonder, had come
  to a standstill. The chauffeur and footman both wore livery which was almost
  white. Inside a swinging vase of flowers was suspended from the roof. A man
  and a woman leaned back in luxurious easy-chairs. The man was dark and had
  the look of a foreigner. The woman was very fair. She wore a long ermine
  cloak and a tiara of pearls.</p>

  <p>Tavernake, whose interest in the passing throngs was entirely superficial,
  found himself for some reason curiously attracted by this glimpse into a
  world of luxury of which he knew nothing; attracted, too, by the woman's
  delicate face with its uncommon type of beauty. Their eyes met as he stood
  there, stolid and motionless, framed in the doorway. Tavernake continued to
  stare, unmindful, perhaps unconscious, of the rudeness of his action. The
  woman, after a moment, glanced away at the shopwindow. A sudden thought
  seemed to strike her. She spoke through the tube at her side and turned to
  her companion. Meanwhile, the footman, leaning from his place, held out his
  arm in warning and the car was slowly backed to the side of the pavement. The
  lady felt for a moment in a bag of white satin which lay upon the round table
  in front of her, and handed a slip of paper through the open window to the
  servant who had already descended and was standing waiting. He came at once
  towards the shop, passing Tavernake, who remained in the door-way.</p>

  <p>"Will you make this up at once, please?" he directed, handing the paper
  across to the chemist.</p>

  <p>The chemist took it in his hand and turned away mechanically toward the
  dispensing room. Suddenly he paused, and, looking back, shook his head.</p>

  <p>"For whom is this prescription required?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"For my mistress," the man answered. "Her name is there."</p>

  <p>"Where is she?"</p>

  <p>"Outside; she is waiting for it."</p>

  <p>"If she really wants this made up to-night," the chemist declared, "she
  must come in and sign the book."</p>

  <p>The footman looked across the counter, for a moment, a little blankly.</p>

  <p>"Am I to tell her that?" he inquired. "It's only a sleeping draught. Her
  regular chemist makes it up all right."</p>

  <p>"That may be," the man behind the counter replied, "but, you see, I am not
  her regular chemist. You had better go and tell her so."</p>

  <p>The footman departed upon his errand without a glance at the girl who was
  sitting within a few feet of him.</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry, madam," he announced to his mistress, "that the chemist
  declines to make up the prescription unless you sign the book."</p>

  <p>"Very well, then, I will come," she declared.</p>

  <p>The woman, handed from the automobile by her servant, lifted her white
  satin skirts in both hands and stepped lightly across the pavement. Tavernake
  stood on one side to let her pass. She seemed to him to be, indeed, a
  creature of that other world of which he knew nothing. Her slow, graceful
  movements, the shimmer of her skirt, her silk stockings, the flashing of the
  diamond buckles upon her shoes, the faint perfume from her clothes, the soft
  touch of her ermine as she swept by&mdash;all these things were indeed
  strange to him. His eyes followed her with rapt interest as she approached
  the counter.</p>

  <p>"You wish me to sign for my prescription?" she asked the chemist. "I will
  do so, with pleasure, if it is necessary, only you must not keep me waiting
  long."</p>

  <p>Her voice was very low and very musical; the slight smile which had parted
  her tired lips, was almost pathetic. Even the chemist felt himself to be a
  human being. He turned at once to his shelves and began to prepare the
  drug.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, madam, that it should have been necessary to fetch you in,"
  he said, apologetically. "My assistant will give you the book if you will
  kindly sign it."</p>

  <p>The assistant dived beneath the counter, reappearing almost immediately
  with a black volume and a pen and ink. The chemist was engrossed upon his
  task; Tavernake's eyes were still riveted upon this woman, who seemed to him
  the most beautiful thing he had ever seen in life. No one was watching the
  girl. The chemist was the first to see her face, and that only in a looking
  glass. He stopped in the act of mixing his drug and turned slowly round. His
  expression was such that they all followed his eyes. The girl was sitting up
  in her chair, with a sudden spot of color burning in her cheeks, her fingers
  gripping the counter as though for support, her eyes dilated, unnatural,
  burning in their white setting with an unholy fire. The lady was the last to
  turn her head, and the bottle of eau-de-cologne which she had taken up from
  the counter, slipped with a crash to the floor. All expression seemed to pass
  from her face; the very life seemed drawn from it. Those who were watching
  her saw suddenly an old woman looking at something of which she was
  afraid.</p>

  <p>The girl seemed to find an unnatural strength. She dragged herself up and
  turned wildly to Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"Take me away," she cried, in a low voice. "Take me away at once."</p>

  <p>The woman at the counter did not speak. Tavernake stepped quickly forward
  and then hesitated. The girl was on her feet now and she clutched at his
  arms. Her eyes besought him.</p>

  <p>"You must take me away, please," she begged, hoarsely. "I am well
  now&mdash;quite well. I can walk."</p>

  <p>Tavernake's lack of imagination stood him in good stead then. He simply
  did what he was told, did it in perfectly mechanical fashion, without asking
  any questions. With the girl leaning heavily upon his arm, he stepped into
  the street and almost immediately into a passing taxicab which he had hailed
  from the threshold of the shop. As he closed the door, he glanced behind him.
  The woman was standing there, half turned towards him, still with that
  strange, stony look upon her lifeless face. The chemist was bending across
  the counter towards her, wondering, perhaps, if another incident were to be
  drawn into his night's work. The eau-de-cologne was running in a little
  stream across the floor.</p>

  <p>"Where to, sir?" the taxicab driver asked Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"Where to?" Tavernake repeated.</p>

  <p>The girl was clinging to his arm.</p>

  <p>"Tell him to drive away from here," she whispered, "to drive anywhere, but
  away from here."</p>

  <p>"Drive straight on," Tavernake directed, "along Fleet Street and up
  Holborn. I will give you the address later on."</p>

  <p>The man changed his speed and their pace increased. Tavernake sat quite
  still, dumfounded by these amazing happenings. The girl by his side was
  clutching his arm, sobbing a little hysterically, holding him all the time as
  though in terror.</p>

  <h2>IV. BREAKFAST WITH BEATRICE</h2>

  <p class="first">The girl, awakened, perhaps, by the passing of some heavy
  cart along the street below, or by the touch of the sunbeam which lay across
  her pillow, first opened her eyes and then, after a preliminary stare around,
  sat up in bed. The events of the previous night slowly shaped themselves in
  her mind. She remembered everything up to the commencement of that drive in
  the taxicab. Sometime after that she must have fainted. And now&mdash;what
  had become of her? Where was she?</p>

  <p>She looked around her in ever-increasing surprise. Certainly it was the
  strangest room she had ever been in. The floor was dusty and innocent of any
  carpet; the window was bare and uncurtained. The walls were unpapered but
  covered here and there with strange-looking plans, one of them taking up
  nearly the whole side of the room&mdash;a very rough piece of work with
  little dabs of blue paint here and there, and shadings and diagrams which
  were absolutely unintelligible. She herself was lying upon a battered iron
  bedstead, and she was wearing a very coarse nightdress. Her own clothes were
  folded up and lay upon a piece of brown paper on the floor by the side of the
  bed. To all appearance, the room was entirely unfurnished, except that in the
  middle of it was a hideous papier mache screen.</p>

  <p>After her first bewildered inspection of her surroundings, it was upon
  this screen that her attention was naturally directed. Obviously it must be
  there to conceal something. Very carefully she leaned out of bed until she
  was able to see around the corner of it. Then her heart gave a little jump
  and she was only just able to stifle an exclamation of fear. Some one was
  sitting there&mdash;a man&mdash;sitting on a battered cane chair, bending
  over a roll of papers which were stretched upon a rude deal table. She felt
  her cheeks grow hot. It must be Tavernake! Where had he brought her? What did
  his presence in the room mean?</p>

  <p>The bed creaked heavily as she regained her former position. A voice came
  to her from behind the screen. She knew it at once. It was Tavernake's.</p>

  <p>"Are you awake?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she answered,&mdash;"yes, I am awake. Is that Mr. Tavernake? Where
  am I, please?"</p>

  <p>"First of all, are you better?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I am better," she assured him, sitting up in bed and pulling the clothes
  to her chin. "I am quite well now. Tell me at once where I am and what you
  are doing over there."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to be terrified about," Tavernake answered. "To all
  effects and purposes, I am in another room. When I move to the door, as I
  shall do directly, I shall drag the screen with me. I can promise
  you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Please explain everything," she begged, "quickly. I am
  most&mdash;uncomfortable."</p>

  <p>"At half-past twelve this morning," Tavernake said, "I found myself alone
  in a taxicab with you, without any luggage or any idea where to go to. To
  make matters worse, you fainted. I tried two hotels but they refused to take
  you in; they were probably afraid that you were going to be ill. Then I
  thought of this room. I am employed, as you know, by a firm of estate agents.
  I do a great deal of work on my own account, however, which I prefer to do in
  secret, and unknown to any one. For that reason, I hired this room a year ago
  and I come here most evenings to work. Sometimes I stay late, so last month I
  bought a small bedstead and had it fixed up here. There is a woman who comes
  in to clean the room. I went to her house last night and persuaded her to
  come here. She undressed you and put you to bed. I am sorry that my presence
  here distresses you, but it is a large building and quite empty at
  night-time. I thought you might wake up and be frightened, so I borrowed this
  screen from the woman and have been sitting here."</p>

  <p>"What, all night?" she gasped.</p>

  <p>"Certainly," he answered. "The woman could not stop herself and this is
  not a residential building at all. All the lower floors are let for offices
  and warehouses, and there is no one else in the place until eight
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>She put her hands to her head and sat quite still for a moment or two. It
  was really hard to take everything in.</p>

  <p>"Aren't you very sleepy?" she asked, irrelevantly.</p>

  <p>"Not very," he replied. "I dozed for an hour, a little time ago. Since
  then I have been looking through some plans which interest me very much."</p>

  <p>"Can I get up?" she inquired, timidly.</p>

  <p>"If you feel strong enough, please do," he answered, with manifest relief.
  "I shall move towards the door, dragging the screen in front of me. You will
  find a brush and comb and some hairpins on your clothes. I could not think of
  anything else to get for you, but, if you will dress, we will walk to London
  Bridge Station, which is just across the way, and while I order some
  breakfast you can go into the ladies' room and do your hair properly. I did
  my best to get hold of a looking-glass, but it was quite impossible."</p>

  <p>The girl's sense of humor was suddenly awake. She had hard work not to
  scream. He had evidently thought out all these details in painstaking
  fashion, one by one.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," she said. "I will get up immediately, if you will do as you
  say."</p>

  <p>He clutched the screen from the inside and dragged it towards the door. On
  the threshold, he spoke to her once more.</p>

  <p>"I shall sit upon the stairs just outside," he announced.</p>

  <p>"I sha'n't be more than five minutes," she assured him.</p>

  <p>She sprang out of bed and dressed quickly. There was nothing beyond where
  the screen had been except a table covered with plans, and a particularly
  hard cane chair which she dragged over for her own use. As she dressed, she
  began to realize how much this matter-of-fact, unimpressionable young man had
  done for her during the last few hours. The reflection affected her in a
  curious manner. She became afflicted with a shyness which she had not felt
  when he was in the room. When at last she had finished her toilette and
  opened the door, she was almost tongue-tied. He was sitting on the top step,
  with his back against the landing, and his eyes were closed. He opened them
  with a little start, however, as soon as he heard her approach.</p>

  <p>"I am glad you have not been long," he remarked. "I want to be at my
  office at nine o'clock and I must go and have a bath somewhere. These stairs
  are rather steep. Please walk carefully."</p>

  <p>She followed him in silence down three flights of stone steps. On each
  landing there were names upon the doors&mdash;two firms of hop merchants, a
  solicitor, and a commission agent. The ground floor was some sort of
  warehouse, from which came a strong smell of leather.</p>

  <p>Tavernake opened the outside door with a small key and they passed into
  the street.</p>

  <p>"London Bridge Station is just across the way," he said. "The refreshment
  room will be open and we can get some breakfast at once."</p>

  <p>"What time is it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"About half-past seven."</p>

  <p>She walked by his side quite meekly, and although there were many things
  which she was longing to say, she remained absolutely without the power of
  speech. Except that he was looking a little crumpled, there was nothing
  whatever in his appearance to indicate that he had been up all night. He
  looked exactly as he had done on the previous day, he seemed even quite
  unconscious that there was anything unusual in their relations. As soon as
  they arrived at the station, he pointed to the ladies' waiting-room.</p>

  <p>"If you will go in and arrange your hair there," he said, "I will go and
  order breakfast and have a shave. I will be back here in about twenty
  minutes. You had better take this."</p>

  <p>He offered her a shilling and she accepted it without hesitation. As soon
  as he had gone, however, she looked at the coin in her hand in blank wonder.
  She had accepted it from him with perfect naturalness and without even saying
  "Thank you!" With a queer little laugh, she pushed open the swinging doors
  and made her way into the waiting-room.</p>

  <p>In hardly more than a quarter of an hour she emerged, to find Tavernake
  waiting for her. He had retied his tie, bought a fresh collar, had been
  shaved. She, too, had improved her appearance.</p>

  <p>"Breakfast is waiting this way," he announced.</p>

  <p>She followed him obediently and they sat down at a small table in the
  station refreshment-room.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she asked, suddenly, "I must ask you something. Has
  anything like this ever happened to you before?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he assured her, with some emphasis.</p>

  <p>"You seem to take everything so much as a matter of course," she
  protested.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't know," she replied, a little feebly. "Only&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She found relief in a sudden and perfectly natural laugh.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "that is better. I am glad that you feel like
  laughing."</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," she declared, "I feel much more like crying. Don't
  you know that you were very foolish last night? You ought to have left me
  alone. Why didn't you? You would have saved yourself a great deal of
  trouble."</p>

  <p>He nodded, as though that point of view did, in some degree, commend
  itself to him.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted, "I suppose I should. I do not, even now, understand
  why I interfered. I can only remember that it didn't seem possible not to at
  the time. I suppose one must have impulses," he added, with a little
  frown.</p>

  <p>"The reflection," she remarked, helping herself to another roll, "seems to
  annoy you."</p>

  <p>"It does," he confessed. "I do not like to feel impelled to do anything
  the reason for which is not apparent. I like to do just the things which seem
  likely to work out best for myself."</p>

  <p>"How you must hate me!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"No, I do not hate you," he replied, "but, on the other hand, you have
  certainly been a trouble to me. First of all, I told a falsehood at the
  boarding-house, and I prefer always to tell the truth when I can. Then I
  followed you out of the house, which I disliked doing very much, and I seem
  to have spent a considerable portion of the time since, in your company,
  under somewhat extraordinary circumstances. I do not understand why I have
  done this."</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is because you are a very good-hearted person," she
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"But I am not," he assured her, calmly. "I am nothing of the sort. I have
  very little sympathy with good-hearted people. I think the world goes very
  much better when every one looks after himself, and the people who are not
  competent to do so go to the wall."</p>

  <p>"It sounds a trifle selfish," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps it is. I have an idea that if I could phrase it differently it
  would become philosophy."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she suggested, smiling across the table at him, "you have
  really done all this because you like me."</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure that it is not that," he declared. "I feel an interest in
  you for which I cannot account, but it does not seem to me to be a personal
  one. Last night," he continued, "when I was sitting there waiting, I tried to
  puzzle it all out. I came to the conclusion that it was because you represent
  something which I do not understand. I am very curious and it always
  interests me to learn. I believe that must be the secret of my interest in
  you."</p>

  <p>"You are very complimentary," she told him, mockingly. "I wonder what
  there is in the world which I could teach so superior a person as Mr.
  Tavernake?"</p>

  <p>He took her question quite seriously.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what there is myself," he answered. "And yet, in a way, I think
  I know."</p>

  <p>"Your imagination should come to the rescue," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"I have no imagination," he declared, gloomily.</p>

  <p>They were silent for several minutes; she was still studying him.</p>

  <p>"I wonder you don't ask me any questions about myself," she said,
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>"There is only one thing," he answered, "concerning which I am in the
  least curious. Last night in the chemist's shop&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't!" she begged him, with suddenly whitening face. "Don't speak of
  that!"</p>

  <p>"Very well," he replied, indifferently. "I thought that you were rather
  inviting my questions. You need not be afraid of any more. I really am not
  curious about personal matters; I find that my own life absorbs all my
  interests."</p>

  <p>They had finished breakfast and he paid the bill. She began to put on her
  gloves.</p>

  <p>"Whatever happens to me," she said, "I shall never forget that you have
  been very kind."</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a moment and then she seemed to realize more completely
  how really kind he had been. There had been a certain crude delicacy about
  his actions which she had under-appreciated. She leaned towards him. There
  was nothing left this morning of that disfiguring sullenness. Her mouth was
  soft; her eyes were bright, almost appealing. If Tavernake had been a judge
  of woman's looks, he must certainly have found her attractive.</p>

  <p>"I am very, very grateful to you," she continued, holding out her hand. "I
  shall always remember how kind you were. Good-bye!"</p>

  <p>"You are not going?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"Why, you didn't imagine that you had taken the care of me upon your
  shoulders for the rest of your life?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't imagine that," he answered. "At the same time, what plans
  have you made? Where are you going?"</p>

  <p>"Oh! I shall think of something," she declared, indifferently.</p>

  <p>He caught the gleam in her eyes, the sudden hopelessness which fell like a
  cloud upon her face. He spoke promptly and with decision.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," he remarked, "you do not know yourself. You are
  just going to drift out of this place and very likely find your way to a seat
  on the Embankment again."</p>

  <p>Her lips quivered. She had tried to be brave but it was hard.</p>

  <p>"Not necessarily," she replied. "Something may turn up."</p>

  <p>He leaned a little across the table towards her.</p>

  <p>"Listen," he said, deliberately, "I will make a proposition to you. It has
  come to me during the last few minutes. I am tired of the boarding-house and
  I wish to leave it. The work which I do at night is becoming more and more
  important. I should like to take two rooms somewhere. If I take a third,
  would you care to call yourself what I called you to the charwoman last
  night&mdash;my sister? I should expect you to look after the meals and my
  clothes, and help me in certain other ways. I cannot give you much of a
  salary," he continued, "but you would have an opportunity during the daytime
  of looking out for some work, if that is what you want, and you would at
  least have a roof and plenty to eat and drink."</p>

  <p>She looked at him in blank amazement. It was obvious that his proposition
  was entirely honest.</p>

  <p>"But, Mr. Tavernake," she protested, "you forget that I am not really your
  sister."</p>

  <p>"Does that matter?" he asked, without flinching. "I think you understand
  the sort of person I am. You would have nothing to fear from any admiration
  on my part&mdash;or anything of that sort," he added, with some show of
  clumsiness. "Those things do not come in my life. I am ambitious to get on,
  to succeed and become wealthy. Other things I do not even think about."</p>

  <p>She was speechless. After a short pause, he went on.</p>

  <p>"I am proposing this arrangement as much for my own sake as for yours. I
  am very well read and I know most of what there is to be known in my
  profession. But there are other things concerning which I am ignorant. Some
  of these things I believe you could teach me."</p>

  <p>Still speechless, she sat and looked at him for several moments. Outside,
  the station now was filled with a hurrying throng on their way to the day's
  work. Engines were shrieking, bells ringing, the press of footsteps was
  unceasing. In the dark, ill-ventilated room itself there was the rattle of
  crockery, the yawning of discontented-looking young women behind the bar,
  young women with their hair still in curl-papers, as yet unprepared for their
  weak little assaults upon the good-nature or susceptibility of their
  customers. A queer corner of life it seemed. She looked at her companion and
  realized how fragmentary was her knowledge of him. There was nothing to be
  gathered from his face. He seemed to have no expression. He was simply
  waiting for her reply, with his thoughts already half engrossed upon the
  business of the day.</p>

  <p>"Really," she began, "I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He came back from his momentary wandering and looked at her. She suddenly
  altered the manner of her speech. It was a strange proposition, perhaps, but
  this was one of the strangest of men.</p>

  <p>"I am quite willing to try it," she decided. "Will you tell me where I can
  meet you later on?"</p>

  <p>"I have an hour and a half for luncheon at one o'clock," he said. "Meet me
  exactly at the southeast corner of Trafalgar Square. Would you like a little
  money?" he added, rising.</p>

  <p>"I have plenty, thank you," she answered.</p>

  <p>He laid half-a-crown upon the table and made an entry in a small
  memorandum book which he drew from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"You had better keep this," he said, "in case you want it. I am going to
  leave you alone here. You can find your way anywhere, I am sure, and I am in
  a hurry. At one o'clock, remember. I hope you will still be feeling
  better."</p>

  <p>He put on his hat and went away without a backward glance. Beatrice sat in
  her chair and watched him out of sight.</p>

  <h2>V. INTRODUCING Mrs. WENHAM GARDNER</h2>

  <p class="first">A very distinguished client was engaging the attention of
  Mr. Dowling, Senior, of Messrs. Dowling, Spence &amp; Company, auctioneers
  and estate agents, whose offices were situated in Waterloo Place, Pall Mall.
  Mr. Dowling was a fussy little man of between fifty and sixty years, who
  spent most of his time playing golf, and who, although he studiously
  contrived to ignore the fact, had long since lost touch with the details of
  his business. Consequently, in the absence of Mr. Dowling, Junior, who had
  developed a marked partiality for a certain bar in the locality, Tavernake
  was hastily summoned to the rescue from another part of the building, by a
  small boy violently out of breath.</p>

  <p>"Never see the governor in such a fuss," the latter declared,
  confidentially, "She's asking no end of questions and he don't know a
  thing."</p>

  <p>"Who is the lady?" Tavernake asked, on the way downstairs.</p>

  <p>"Didn't hear her name," the boy replied. "She's all right, though, I can
  tell you&mdash;a regular slap-up beauty. Such a motor-car, too! Flowers and
  tables and all sorts of things inside. By Jove, won't the governor tear his
  hair if she goes before you get there!"</p>

  <p>Tavernake quickened his steps and in a few moments knocked at the door of
  the private office and entered.</p>

  <p>His chief welcomed him with a gesture of relief. The distinguished client
  of the firm, whose attention he was endeavoring to engage, had glanced toward
  the newcomer, at his first appearance, with an air of somewhat bored
  unconcern. Her eyes, however, did not immediately leave his face. On the
  contrary, from the moment of his entrance she watched him steadfastly.
  Tavernake, stolid, unruffled, at that time without comprehension, approached
  the desk.</p>

  <p>"This is&mdash;er&mdash;Mr. Tavernake, our manager," Mr. Dowling
  announced, obsequiously. "In the absence of my son, he is in charge of the
  letting department. I have no doubt that he will be able to suggest something
  suitable. Tavernake," he continued, "this lady,"&mdash;he glanced at a card
  in front of him&mdash;"Mrs. Wenham Gardner of New York, is looking for a town
  house, and has been kind enough to favor us with an inquiry."</p>

  <p>Tavernake made no immediate reply. Mr. Dowling was shortsighted, and in
  any case it would never have occurred to him to associate nervousness, or any
  form of emotion, with his responsible manager. The beautiful lady leaned back
  in her chair. Her lips were parted in a slight but very curious smile, her
  fingers supported her cheek, her eyelids were contracted as she looked into
  his face. Tavernake felt that their recognition was mutual. Once more he was
  back again in the tragic atmosphere of that chemist's shop, with Beatrice,
  half fainting, in his arms, the beautiful lady turned to stone. It was an odd
  tableau, that, so vividly imprinted upon his memory that it was there before
  him at this very moment. There was mystery in this woman's eyes, mystery and
  something else.</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to have come across anything down here
  which&mdash;er&mdash;particularly attracts Mrs.&mdash;Mrs. Wenham Gardner,"
  Mr. Dowling went on, taking up a little sheaf of papers from the desk. "I
  thought, perhaps, that the Bryanston Square house might have suited, but it
  seems that it is too small, far too small. Mrs. Gardner is used to
  entertaining, and has explained to me that she has a great many friends
  always coming and going from the other side of the water. She requires,
  apparently, twelve bedrooms, besides servants' quarters."</p>

  <p>"Your list is scarcely up to date, sir," Tavernake reminded him. "If the
  rent is of no particular object, there is Grantham House."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dowling's face was suddenly illuminated.</p>

  <p>"Grantham House!" he exclaimed. "Precisely! Now I declare that it had
  absolutely slipped my memory for the moment&mdash;only for the moment,
  mind&mdash;that we have just had placed upon our books one of the most
  desirable mansions in the west end of London. A most valued client, too, one
  whom we are most anxious to oblige. Dear, dear me! It is very
  fortunate&mdash;very fortunate indeed that I happened to think of it,
  especially as it seems that no one had had the sense to place it upon my
  list. Tavernake, get the plans at once and show them to&mdash;er&mdash;to
  Mrs. Gardner."</p>

  <p>Tavernake crossed the room in silence, opened a drawer, and returned with
  a stiff roll of papers, which he spread carefully out in front of this
  unexpected client. She spoke then for the first time since he had entered the
  room. Her voice was low and marvelously sweet. There was very little of the
  American accent about it, but something in the intonation, especially toward
  the end of her sentences, was just a trifle un-English.</p>

  <p>"Where is this Grantham House?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Within a stone's throw of Grosvenor Square," Tavernake answered, briskly.
  "It is really one of the most central spots in the west end. If you will
  allow me!"</p>

  <p>For the next few minutes he was very fluent indeed. With pencil in hand,
  he explained the plans, dwelt on the advantages of the location, and from the
  very reserve of his praise created an impression that the house he was
  describing was the one absolutely perfect domicile in the whole of
  London.</p>

  <p>"Can I look over the place?" she asked, when he had finished.</p>

  <p>"By all means," Mr. Dowling declared, "by all means. I was on the point of
  suggesting it. It will be by far the most satisfactory proceeding. You will
  not be disappointed, my dear madam, I can assure you."</p>

  <p>"I should like to do so, if I may, without delay," she said.</p>

  <p>"There is no opportunity like the present," Mr. Dowling replied. "If you
  will permit me," he added, rising, "it will give me the greatest pleasure to
  escort you personally. My engagements for the rest of the day happen to be
  unimportant. Tavernake, let me have the keys of the rooms that are locked up.
  The caretaker, of course, is there in possession."</p>

  <p>The beautiful visitor rose to her feet, and even that slight movement was
  accomplished with a grace unlike anything which Tavernake had ever seen
  before.</p>

  <p>"I could not think of troubling you so far, Mr. Dowling," she protested.
  "It is not in the least necessary for you to come yourself. Your manager can,
  perhaps, spare me a few minutes. He seems to be so thoroughly posted in all
  the details," she added, apologetically, as she noticed the cloud on Mr.
  Dowling's brow.</p>

  <p>"Just as you like, of course," he declared. "Mr. Tavernake can go, by all
  means. Now I come to think of it, it certainly would be inconvenient for me
  to be away from the office for more than a few minutes. Mr. Tavernake has all
  the details at his fingers' ends, and I only hope, Mrs. Gardner, that he will
  be able to persuade you to take the house. Our client," he added, with a bow,
  "would, I am sure, be delighted to hear that we had secured for him so
  distinguished a tenant."</p>

  <p>She smiled at him, a delightful mixture of graciousness and
  condescension.</p>

  <p>"You are very good," she answered. "The house sounds rather large for me
  but it depends so much upon circumstances. If you are ready, Mr.&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Tavernake," he told her.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she continued, "my car is waiting outside and we might go
  on at once."</p>

  <p>He bowed and held open the door for her, an office which he performed a
  little awkwardly. Mr. Dowling himself escorted her out on to the pavement.
  Tavernake stopped behind to get his hat, and passing out a moment afterwards,
  would have seated himself in front beside the chauffeur but that she held the
  door of the car open and beckoned to him.</p>

  <p>"Will you come inside, please?" she insisted. "There are one or two
  questions which I might ask you as we go along. Please direct the
  chauffeur."</p>

  <p>He obeyed without a word; the car glided off. As they swung round the
  first corner, she leaned forward from among the cushions of her seat and
  looked at him. Then Tavernake was conscious of new things. As though by
  inspiration, he knew that her visit to the office of Messrs. Dowling, Spence
  &amp; Company had been no chance one.</p>

  <p>She remembered him, remembered him as the companion of Beatrice during
  that strange, brief meeting. It was an incomprehensible world, this, into
  which he had wandered. The woman's face had lost her languid, gracious
  expression. There was something there almost akin to tragedy. Her fingers
  fell upon his arm and her touch was no light one. She was gripping him almost
  fiercely.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she said, "I have a memory for faces which seldom fails
  me. I have seen you before quite lately. You remember where, of course. Tell
  me the truth quickly, please."</p>

  <p>The words seemed to leap from her lips. Beautiful and young though she
  undoubtedly was, her intense seriousness had suddenly aged her face.
  Tavernake was bewildered. He, too, was conscious of a curious emotional
  disturbance.</p>

  <p>"The truth? What truth do you mean?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"It was you whom I saw with Beatrice!"</p>

  <p>"You saw me one night about three weeks ago," he admitted slowly. "I was
  in a chemist's shop in the Strand. You were signing his book for a sleeping
  draught, I think."</p>

  <p>She shivered all over.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes!" she cried. "Of course, I remember all about it. The young lady
  who was with you&mdash;what was she doing there? Where is she now?"</p>

  <p>"The young lady was my sister," Tavernake answered stiffly.</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wenham Gardner looked, for a moment, as though she would have struck
  him.</p>

  <p>"You need not lie to me!" she exclaimed. "It is not worth while. Tell me
  where you met her, why you were with her at all in that intimate fashion, and
  where she is now!"</p>

  <p>Tavernake realized at once that so far as this woman was concerned, the
  fable of his relationship with Beatrice was hopeless. She knew!</p>

  <p>"Madam," he replied, "I made the acquaintance of the young lady with whom
  I was that evening, at the boarding-house where we both lived."</p>

  <p>"What were you doing in the chemist's shop?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"The young lady had been ill," he proceeded deliberately, wondering how
  much to tell. "She had been taken very ill indeed. She was just recovering
  when you entered."</p>

  <p>"Where is she now?" the woman asked eagerly. "Is she still at that
  boarding-house of which you spoke?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered.</p>

  <p>Her fingers gripped his arm once more.</p>

  <p>"Why do you answer me always in monosyllables? Don't you understand that
  you must tell me everything that you know about her. You must tell me where I
  can find her, at once."</p>

  <p>Tavernake remained silent. The woman's voice had still that note of
  wonderful sweetness, but she had altogether lost her air of complete and
  aristocratic indifference. She was a very altered person now from the
  distinguished client who had first enlisted his services. For some reason or
  other, he knew that she was suffering from a terrible anxiety.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," he said at last, "whether I can do as you ask."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" she exclaimed sharply.</p>

  <p>"The young lady," he continued, "seemed, on the occasion to which you have
  referred, to be particularly anxious to avoid recognition. She hurried out of
  the place without speaking to you, and she has avoided the subject ever
  since. I do not know what her motives may have been, but I think that I
  should like to ask her first before I tell you where she is to be found."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Wenham Gardner leaned towards him. It was certainly the first time
  that a woman in her apparent rank of life had looked upon Tavernake in such a
  manner. Her forehead was a little wrinkled, her lips were parted, her eyes
  were pathetically, delightfully eloquent.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake, you must not&mdash;you must not refuse me," she pleaded.
  "If you only knew the importance of it, you would not hesitate for a moment.
  This is no idle curiosity on my part. I have reasons, very serious reasons
  indeed, for wishing to discover that poor girl's whereabouts at once. There
  is a possible danger of which she must be warned. No one can do it except
  myself."</p>

  <p>"Are you her friend or her enemy?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask such a question?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I am only going by her expression when she saw you come into the
  chemist's shop," Tavernake persisted doggedly.</p>

  <p>"It is a cruel suggestion, that," the woman cried. "I wish to be her
  friend, I am her friend. If I could only tell you everything, you would
  understand at once what a terrible situation, what a hideous quandary I am
  in."</p>

  <p>Once more Tavernake paused for a few moments. He was never a quick thinker
  and the situation was certainly an embarrassing one for him.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he replied at length, "I beg that you will tell me nothing. The
  young lady of whom you have spoken permits me to call myself her friend, and
  what she has not told me herself I do not wish to learn from others. I will
  tell her of this meeting with you, and if it is her desire, I will bring you
  her address myself within a few hours. I cannot do more than that."</p>

  <p>Her face was suddenly cold and hard.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you will not!" she exclaimed angrily. "You are obstinate. I
  do not know how you dare to refuse what I ask."</p>

  <p>The car had come to a standstill. He stepped out on to the pavement.</p>

  <p>"This is Grantham House, madam," he announced. "Will you descend?"</p>

  <p>He heard her draw a quick breath between her teeth and he caught a gleam
  in her eyes which made him feel vaguely uneasy. She was very angry
  indeed.</p>

  <p>"I do not think that it is necessary for me to do so," she said frigidly.
  "I do not like the look of the house at all. I do not believe that it will
  suit me."</p>

  <p>"At least, now that you are here," he protested, "you will, if you please,
  go over it. I should like you to see the ballroom. The decorations are
  supposed to be quite exceptional."</p>

  <p>She hesitated for a moment and then, with a slight shrug of the shoulders,
  she yielded. There was a note in his tone not exactly insistent, and yet
  dominant, a note which she obeyed although secretly she wondered at herself
  for doing so. They passed inside the house and she followed him from room to
  room, leaving him to do all the talking. She seemed very little interested
  but every now and then she asked a languid question.</p>

  <p>"I do not think that it is in the least likely to suit me," she decided at
  last. "It is all very magnificent, of course, but I consider that the rent is
  exorbitant."</p>

  <p>Tavernake regarded her thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I believe," he said, "that our client might be disposed to consider some
  reduction, in the event of your seriously entertaining taking the house. If
  you like, I will see him on the subject. I feel sure that the amount I have
  mentioned could be reduced, if the other conditions were satisfactory."</p>

  <p>"There would be no harm in your doing so," she assented. "How soon can you
  come and let me know?"</p>

  <p>"I might be able to ring you up this evening; certainly to-morrow
  morning," he answered.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I will not speak upon the telephone," she declared. "I only allow it in
  my rooms under protest. You must come and tell me what your client says. When
  can you see him?"</p>

  <p>"It is doubtful whether I shall be able to find him this evening," he
  replied. "It would probably be to-morrow morning."</p>

  <p>"You might go and try at once," she suggested.</p>

  <p>He was a little surprised.</p>

  <p>"You are really interested in the matter, then?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," she told him, "of course I am interested. I want you to come
  and see me directly you have heard. It is important. Supposing you are able
  to find your client to-night, shall you have seen the young lady before
  then?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not," he answered.</p>

  <p>"You must try," she begged, laying her fingers upon his shoulder. "Mr.
  Tavernake, do please try. You can't realize what all this anxiety means to
  me. I am not at all well and I am seriously worried about&mdash;about that
  young lady. I tell you that I must have an interview with her. It is not for
  my sake so much as hers. She must be warned."</p>

  <p>"Warned?" Tavernake repeated. "I really don't understand."</p>

  <p>"Of course you don't!" she exclaimed impatiently. "Why should you
  understand? I don't want to offend you, Mr. Tavernake," she went on
  hurriedly. "I would like to treat you quite frankly. It really isn't your
  place to make difficulties like this. What is this young lady to you that you
  should presume to consider yourself her guardian?"</p>

  <p>"She is a boarding-house acquaintance," Tavernake confessed, "nothing
  more."</p>

  <p>"Then why did you tell me, only a moment ago, that she was your sister?"
  Mrs. Gardner demanded.</p>

  <p>Tavernake threw open the door before which they had been standing.</p>

  <p>"This," he said, "is the famous dancing gallery. Lord Clumber is quite
  willing to allow the pictures to remain, and I may tell you that they are
  insured for over sixty thousand pounds. There is no finer dancing room than
  this in all London."</p>

  <p>Her eyes swept around it carelessly.</p>

  <p>"I have no doubt," she admitted coldly, "that it is very beautiful. I
  prefer to continue our discussion."</p>

  <p>"The dining-room," he went on, "is almost as large. Lord Clumber tells us
  that he has frequently entertained eighty guests for dinner. The system of
  ventilation in this room is, as you see, entirely modern."</p>

  <p>She took him by the arm and led him to a seat at the further end of the
  apartment.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she said, making an obvious attempt to control her
  temper, "you seem like a very sensible young man, if you will allow me to say
  so, and I want to convince you that it is your duty to answer my questions.
  In the first place&mdash;don't be offended, will you?&mdash;but I cannot
  possibly see what interest you and that young lady can have in one another.
  You belong, to put it baldly, to altogether different social stations, and it
  is not easy to imagine what you could have in common."</p>

  <p>She paused, but Tavernake had nothing to say. His gift of silence amounted
  sometimes almost to genius. She leaned so close to him while she waited in
  vain for his reply, that the ermine about her neck brushed his cheek. The
  perfume of her clothes and hair, the pleading of her deep violet-blue eyes,
  all helped to keep him tongue-tied. Nothing of this sort had ever happened to
  him before. He did not in the least understand what it could possibly
  mean.</p>

  <p>"I am speaking to you now, Mr. Tavernake," she continued earnestly, "for
  your own good. When you tell the young lady, as you have promised to this
  evening, that you have seen me, and that I am very, very anxious to find out
  where she is, she will very likely go down on her knees and beg you to give
  me no information whatever about her. She will do her best to make you
  promise to keep us apart. And yet that is all because she does not
  understand. Believe me, it is better that you should tell me the truth. You
  cannot know her very well, Mr. Tavernake, but she is not very wise, that
  young lady. She is very obstinate, and she has some strange ideas. It is not
  well for her that she should be left in the world alone. You must see that
  for yourself, Mr. Tavernake."</p>

  <p>"She seems a very sensible young lady," he declared slowly. "I should have
  thought that she would have been old enough to know for herself what she
  wanted and what was best for her."</p>

  <p>The woman at his side wrung her hands with a little gesture of
  despair.</p>

  <p>"Oh, why can't I make you understand!" she exclaimed, the emotion once
  more quivering in her tone. "How can I&mdash;how can I possibly make you
  believe me? Listen. Something has happened of which she does not
  know&mdash;something terrible. It is absolutely necessary, in her own
  interests as well as mine, that I see her, and that very shortly."</p>

  <p>"I shall tell her exactly what you say," Tavernake answered apparently
  unmoved. "Perhaps it would be as well now if we went on to view the sleeping
  apartments."</p>

  <p>"Never mind about the sleeping apartments!" she cried quickly. "You must
  do more than tell her. You can't believe that I want to bring harm upon any
  one. Do I look like it? Have I the appearance of a person of evil
  disposition? You can be that young lady's best friend, Mr. Tavernake, if you
  will. Take me to her now, this minute. Believe me, if you do that, you will
  never regret it as long as you live."</p>

  <p>Tavernake studied the pattern of the parquet floor for several moments. It
  was a difficult problem, this. Putting his own extraordinary sensations into
  the background, he was face to face with something which he did not
  comprehend, and he disliked the position intensely. After all, delay seemed
  safest.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he protested, "a few hours more or less can make but little
  difference."</p>

  <p>"That is for me to judge!" she exclaimed. "You say that because you do not
  understand. A few hours may make all the difference in the world."</p>

  <p>He shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I will tell you exactly what is in my mind," he said, deliberately. "The
  young lady was terrified when she saw you that night accidentally in the
  chemist's shop. She almost dragged me away, and although she was almost
  fainting when we reached the taxicab, her greatest and chief anxiety was that
  we should get away before you could follow us. I cannot forget this. Until I
  have received her permission, therefore, to disclose her whereabouts, we
  will, if you please, speak of something else."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet and glancing around was just in time to see the change
  in the face of his companion. That eloquently pleading smile had died away
  from her lips, her teeth were clenched. She looked like a woman struggling
  hard to control some overwhelming passion. Without the smile her lips seemed
  hard, even cruel. There were evil things shining out of her eyes. Tavernake
  felt chilled, almost afraid.</p>

  <p>"We will see the rest of the house," she declared coldly.</p>

  <p>They went on from room to room. Tavernake, recovering himself rapidly,
  master of his subject, was fluent and practical. The woman listened, with
  only a terse remark here and there. Once more they stood in the hall.</p>

  <p>"Is there anything else you would like to see?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she replied, "but there is one thing more I have to say."</p>

  <p>He waited in stolid silence.</p>

  <p>"Only a week ago," she went on, looking him in the face, "I told a man who
  is what you call, I think, an inquiry agent, that I would give a hundred
  pounds if he could discover that young woman for me within twenty-four
  hours."</p>

  <p>Tavernake started, and the smile came back to the lips of Mrs. Wenham
  Gardner. After all, perhaps she had found the way!</p>

  <p>"A hundred pounds is a great deal of money," he said thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Not so very much," she replied. "About a fortnight's rent of this house,
  Mr. Tavernake."</p>

  <p>"Is the offer still open?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She looked into his eyes, and her face had once more the beautiful
  ingenuousness of a child.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she said, "the offer is still open. Get into the car with
  me and drive back to my rooms at the Milan Court, and I will give you a
  cheque for a hundred pounds at once. It will be very easily earned and you
  may just as well take it, for now I know where you are employed, I could have
  you followed day by day until I discover for myself what you are so foolishly
  concealing. Be reasonable, Mr. Tavernake."</p>

  <p>Tavernake stood quite still. His arms were folded, he was looking out of
  the hall window at the smoky vista of roofs and chimneys. From the soles of
  his ready-made boots to his ill-brushed hair, he was a commonplace young man.
  A hundred pounds was to him a vast sum of money. It represented a year's
  strenuous savings, perhaps more. The woman who watched him imagined that he
  was hesitating. Tavernake, however, had no such thought in his mind. He stood
  there instead, wondering what strange thing had come to him that the mention
  of a hundred pounds, delightful sum though it was, never tempted him for a
  single second. What this woman had said might be true. She would probably be
  able to discover the address easily enough without his help. Yet no such
  reflection seemed to make the least difference. From the days of his earliest
  boyhood, from the time when he had flung himself into the struggle, money had
  always meant much to him, money not for its own sake but as the key to those
  things which he coveted in life. Yet at that moment something stronger seemed
  to have asserted itself.</p>

  <p>"You will come?" she whispered, passing her arm through his. "We will be
  there in less than five minutes, and I will write you the cheque before you
  tell me anything."</p>

  <p>He moved towards the door indeed, but he drew a little away from her.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said, "I am sorry to seem so obstinate, but I thought I had
  made you understand some time ago. I do not feel at liberty to tell you
  anything without that young lady's permission."</p>

  <p>"You refuse?" she cried, incredulously. "You refuse a hundred pounds?"</p>

  <p>He opened the door of the car. He seemed scarcely to have heard her.</p>

  <p>"At about eleven o'clock to-morrow morning," he announced, "I shall have
  the pleasure of calling upon you. I trust that you will have decided to take
  the house."</p>

  <h2>VI. QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake sat a few hours later at his evening meal in the
  tiny sitting-room of an apartment house in Chelsea. He wore a black tie, and
  although he had not yet aspired to a dinner coat, the details of his person
  and toilet showed signs of a new attention. Opposite to him was Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she asked, as soon as the small maid-servant who brought in
  their first dish had disappeared, "what have you been doing all day? Have you
  been letting houses or surveying land or book-keeping, or have you been out
  to Marston Rise?"</p>

  <p>It was her customary question, this. She really took an interest in his
  work.</p>

  <p>"I have been attending a rich American client," he announced, "a
  compatriot of your own. I went with her to Grantham House in her own
  motor-car. I believe she thinks of taking it."</p>

  <p>"American!" Beatrice remarked. "What was her name?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake looked up from his plate across the little table, across the
  bowl of simple flowers which was its sole decoration.</p>

  <p>"She called herself Mrs. Wenham Garner!"</p>

  <p>Away like a flash went the new-found peace in the girl's face. She caught
  at her breath, her fingers gripped the table in front of her. Once more she
  was as he had known her first&mdash;pale, with great terrified eyes shining
  out of a haggard face.</p>

  <p>"She has been to you," Beatrice gasped, "for a house? You are sure?"</p>

  <p>"I am quite sure," Tavernake declared, calmly.</p>

  <p>"You recognized her?"</p>

  <p>He assented gravely.</p>

  <p>"It was the woman who stood in the chemist's shop that night, signing her
  name in a book," he said.</p>

  <p>He did not apologize in any way for the shock he had given her. He had
  done it deliberately. From that very first morning, when they had breakfasted
  together at London Bridge, he had felt that he deserved her confidence, and
  in a sense it was a grievance with him that she had withheld it.</p>

  <p>"Did she recognize you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted. "I was sent for into the office and found her there
  with the chief. I felt sure that she recognized me from the first, and when
  she agreed to look at Grantham House, she insisted upon it that I should
  accompany her. While we were in the motor-car, she asked me about you. She
  wished for your address."</p>

  <p>"Did you give it to her?" the girl cried, breathlessly.</p>

  <p>"No; I said that I must consult you first."</p>

  <p>She drew a little sigh of relief. Nevertheless, she was looking white and
  shaken.</p>

  <p>"Did she say what she wanted me for?"</p>

  <p>"She was very mysterious," Tavernake answered. "She spoke of some danger
  of which you knew nothing. Before I came away, she offered me a hundred
  pounds to let her know where you were."</p>

  <p>Beatrice laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"That is just like Elizabeth," she declared. "You must have made her very
  angry. When she wants anything, she wants it very badly indeed, and she will
  never believe that every person has not his price. Money means everything to
  her. If she had it, she would buy, buy, buy all the time."</p>

  <p>"On the face of it," Tavernake remarked, soberly, "her offer seemed rather
  an absurd one. If she is in earnest, if she is really so anxious to discover
  your whereabouts, she will certainly be able to do so without my help."</p>

  <p>"I am not so sure," Beatrice replied. "London is a great hiding
  place."</p>

  <p>"A private detective," he began,&mdash;</p>

  <p>Beatrice shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I do not think," she said, "that Elizabeth will care to employ a private
  detective. Tell me, have you to see her upon this business again?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to her flat at the Milan Court to-morrow morning at eleven
  o'clock."</p>

  <p>Beatrice leaned back in her chair. Presently she recommenced her dinner.
  She had the air of one to whom a respite has been granted. Tavernake, in a
  way, began to resent this continued silence of hers. He had certainly hoped
  that she would at least have gone so far as to explain her anxiety to keep
  her whereabouts secret.</p>

  <p>"You must remember," he went on, after a short pause, "that I am in a
  somewhat peculiar position with regard to you, Beatrice. I know so little
  that I do not even know how to answer in your interests such questions as
  Mrs. Wenham Gardner asked me. I am not complaining, but is this state of
  absolute ignorance necessary?"</p>

  <p>A new thought seemed to come to Beatrice. She looked at her companion
  curiously.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she asked, "what did you think of Mrs. Wenham Gardner?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake answered deliberately, and after a moment's reflection.</p>

  <p>"I thought her," he said, "one of the most beautiful women I have ever
  seen in my life. That is not saying very much, perhaps, but to me it meant a
  good deal. She was exceedingly gracious and her interest in you seemed quite
  real and even affectionate. I do not understand why you should wish to hide
  from such a woman."</p>

  <p>"You found her attractive?" Beatrice persisted.</p>

  <p>"I found her very attractive indeed," Tavernake admitted, without
  hesitation. "She had an air with her. She was quite different from all the
  women I have ever met at the boarding-house or anywhere else. She has a face
  which reminded me somehow of the Madonnas you took me to see in the National
  Gallery the other day."</p>

  <p>Beatrice shivered slightly. For some reason, his remark seemed to have
  distressed her.</p>

  <p>"I am very, very sorry," she declared, "that Elizabeth ever came to your
  office. I want you to promise me, Leonard, that you will be careful whenever
  you are with her."</p>

  <p>Tavernake laughed.</p>

  <p>"Careful!" he repeated. "She isn't likely to be even civil to me tomorrow
  when I tell her that I have seen you and I refuse to give her your address.
  Careful, indeed! What has a poor clerk in a house-agent's office to fear from
  such a personage?"</p>

  <p>The servant had reappeared with their second and last course. For a few
  moments they spoke of casual subjects. Afterwards, however, Tavernake asked a
  question.</p>

  <p>"By the way," he said, "we are hoping to let Grantham House to Mrs. Wenham
  Gardner. I suppose she must be very wealthy?"</p>

  <p>Beatrice looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Why do you come to me for information?" she demanded. "I suppose that she
  brought you references?"</p>

  <p>"We haven't quite got to that stage yet," he answered. "Somehow or other,
  from her manner of talking and general appearance, I do not think that either
  Mr. Dowling or I doubted her financial position."</p>

  <p>"I should never have thought you so credulous a person," remarked
  Beatrice, with a smile.</p>

  <p>Tavernake was genuinely disturbed. His business instincts were
  aroused.</p>

  <p>"Do you really mean that this Mrs. Wenham Gardner is not a person of
  substance?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Beatrice shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"She is the wife of a man who had the reputation of being very wealthy,"
  she replied. "She has no money of her own, I am sure."</p>

  <p>"She still lives with her husband, I suppose?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>Beatrice closed her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I know very little about her," she declared. "Last time I heard, he had
  disappeared, gone away, or something of the sort."</p>

  <p>"And she has no money," Tavernake persisted, "except what she gets from
  him? No settlement, even, or anything of that sort?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all," Beatrice answered.</p>

  <p>"This is very bad news," Tavernake remarked, thinking gloomily of his
  wasted day. "It will be a great disappointment to Mr. Dowling. Why, her
  motor-car was magnificent, and she talked as though money were no object at
  all. I suppose you are quite sure of what you are saying?"</p>

  <p>Beatrice shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I ought to know," she answered, grimly, "for she is my sister."</p>

  <p>Tavernake remained quite motionless for a minute, without speech; it was
  his way of showing surprise. When he was sure that he had grasped the import
  of her words, he spoke again.</p>

  <p>"Your sister!" he repeated. "There is a likeness, of course. You are dark
  and she is fair, but there is a likeness. That would account," he continued,
  "for her anxiety to find you."</p>

  <p>"It also accounts," Beatrice replied, with a little break of the lips,
  "for my anxiety that she should not find me. Leonard," she added, touching
  his hand for a moment with hers, "I wish that I could tell you everything,
  but there are things behind, things so terrible, that even to you, my dear
  brother, I could not speak of them."</p>

  <p>Tavernake rose to his feet and lit a cigarette&mdash;a new habit with him,
  while Beatrice busied herself with a small coffee-making machine. He sat in
  an easy-chair and smoked slowly. He was still wearing his ready-made clothes,
  but his collar was of the fashionable shape, his tie well chosen and neatly
  adjusted. He seemed somehow to have developed.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," he asked, "what am I to tell your sister to-morrow?"</p>

  <p>She shivered as she set his coffee-cup down by his side.</p>

  <p>"Tell her, if you will, that I am well and not in want," she answered.
  "Tell her, too, that I refuse to send my address. Tell her that the one aim
  of my life is to keep the knowledge of my whereabouts a secret from her."</p>

  <p>Tavernake relapsed into silence. He was thinking. Mysteries had no
  attraction for him&mdash;he loathed them. Against this one especially he felt
  a distinct grudge. Nevertheless, some instinct forbade his questioning the
  girl.</p>

  <p>"Apart from more personal matters, then," he asked after some time, "you
  would not advise me to enter into any business negotiations with this
  lady?"</p>

  <p>"You must not think of it," Beatrice replied, firmly. "So far as money is
  concerned, Elizabeth has no conscience whatever. The things she wants in life
  she will have somehow, but it is all the time at other people's expense. Some
  day she will have to pay for it."</p>

  <p>Tavernake sighed.</p>

  <p>"It is very unfortunate," he declared. "The commission on the letting of
  Grantham House would have been worth having."</p>

  <p>"After all, it is only your firm's loss," she reminded him.</p>

  <p>"It does not appeal to me like that," he continued. "So long as I am
  manager for Dowling &amp; Spence, I feel these things personally. However,
  that does not matter. I am afraid it is a disagreeable subject for you, and
  we will not talk about it any longer."</p>

  <p>She lit a cigarette with a little gesture of relief. She came once more to
  his side.</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she said, "I know that I am treating you badly in telling you
  nothing, but it is simply because I do not want to descend to half truths. I
  should like to tell you all or nothing. At present I cannot tell you
  all."</p>

  <p>"Very well," he replied, "I am quite content to leave it with you to do as
  you think best."</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she continued, "of course you think me unreasonable. I can't
  help it. There are things between my sister and myself the knowledge of which
  is a constant nightmare to me. During the last few months of my life it has
  grown to be a perfect terror. It sent me into hiding at Blenheim House, it
  reconciled me even to the decision I came to that night on the Embankment. I
  had decided that sooner than go back, sooner than ask help from her or any
  one connected with her, I would do what I tried to do the time when you saved
  my life."</p>

  <p>Tavernake looked at her wonderingly. She was, indeed, under the spell of
  some deep emotion. Her memory seemed to have carried her back into another
  world, somewhere far away from this dingy little sitting-room which they two
  were sharing together, back into a world where life and death were matters of
  small moment, where the great passions were unchained, and men and women
  moved among the naked things of life. Almost he felt the thrill of it. It was
  something new to him, the touch of a magic finger upon his eyelids. Then the
  moment passed and he was himself again, matter-of-fact, prosaic.</p>

  <p>"Let us dismiss the subject finally," he said. "I must see your sister on
  business to-morrow, but it shall be for the last time."</p>

  <p>"I think," she murmured, "that you will be wise."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room and returned with a newspaper.</p>

  <p>"I saw your music in the hall as I came in," he remarked. "Are you singing
  to-night?"</p>

  <p>The question was entirely in his ordinary tone. It brought her back to the
  world of every-day things as nothing else could have done.</p>

  <p>"Yes; isn't it luck?" she told him. "Three in one week. I only heard an
  hour ago."</p>

  <p>"A city dinner?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"Something of the sort," she replied. "I am to be at the Whitehall Rooms
  at ten o'clock. If you are tired, Leonard, please let me go alone. I really
  do not mind. I can get a 'bus to the door, there and back again."</p>

  <p>"I am not tired," he declared. "To tell you the truth, I scarcely know
  what it is to be tired. I shall go with you, of course."</p>

  <p>She looked at him with a momentary admiration of his powerful frame, his
  strong, forceful face.</p>

  <p>"It seems too bad," she remarked, "after a long day's work to drag you out
  again."</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"I really like to come," he assured her. "Besides," he added, after a
  moment's pause, "I like to hear you sing."</p>

  <p>"I wonder if you mean that?" she asked, looking at him curiously. "I have
  watched you once or twice when I have been singing to you. Do you really care
  for it?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly I do. How can you doubt it? I do not," he continued, slowly,
  "understand music, or anything of that sort, of course, any more than I do
  the pictures you take me to see, and some of the books you talk about. There
  are lots of things I can't get the hang of entirely, but they all leave a
  sort of pleasure behind. One feels it even if one only half appreciates."</p>

  <p>She came over to his chair.</p>

  <p>"I am glad," she said, a little wistfully, "that there is one thing I do
  which you like."</p>

  <p>He looked at her reprovingly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Beatrice," he said, "I often wish I could make you understand how
  extraordinarily helpful and useful to me you have been."</p>

  <p>"Tell me in what way?" she begged.</p>

  <p>"You have given me," he assured her, "an insight into many things in life
  which I had found most perplexing. You see, you have traveled and I haven't.
  You have mixed with all classes of people, and I have gone steadily on in one
  groove. You have told me many things which I shall find very useful indeed
  later on."</p>

  <p>"Dear me," she laughed, "you are making me quite conceited!"</p>

  <p>"Anyhow," he replied, "I don't want you to look upon me, Beatrice, in any
  way as a benefactor. I am much more comfortable here than at the
  boarding-house and it is costing no more money, especially since you began to
  get those singing engagements. By the way, hadn't you better go and get
  ready?"</p>

  <p>She smothered a sigh as she turned away and went slowly upstairs. To all
  appearance, no person who ever breathed was more ordinary than this
  strong-featured, self-centered young man who had put out his arm and snatched
  her from the Maelstrom. Yet it seemed to her that there was something almost
  unnatural about his unapproachability. She was convinced that he was entirely
  honest, not only with regard to his actual relations toward her, but with
  regard to all his purposes. Her sex did not even seem to exist for him. The
  fact that she was good-looking, and with her renewed health daily becoming
  more so, seemed to be of no account to him whatever. He showed interest in
  her appearance sometimes, but it was interest of an entirely impersonal sort.
  He simply expressed himself as satisfied or dissatisfied, as a matter of
  taste. It came to her at that moment that she had never seen him really
  relax. Only when he sat opposite to that great map which hung now in the
  further room, and wandered about from section to section with a pencil in one
  hand and a piece of rubber in another, did he show anything which in any way
  approached enthusiasm, and even then it was always the unmistakable
  enthusiasm born of dead things. Suddenly she laughed at herself in the little
  mirror, laughed softly but heartily. This was the guardian whom Fate had sent
  for her! If Elizabeth had only understood!</p>

  <h2>VII. Mr. PRITCHARD OF NEW YORK</h2>

  <p class="first">Later in the evening, Beatrice and Tavernake traveled
  together in a motor omnibus from their rooms at Chelsea to Northumberland
  Avenue. Tavernake was getting quite used to the programme by now. They sat in
  a dimly-lit waiting-room until the time came for Beatrice to sing. Every now
  and then an excitable little person who was the secretary to some institution
  or other would run in and offer them refreshments, and tell them in what
  order they were to appear. To-night there was no departure from the ordinary
  course of things, except that there was slightly more stir. The dinner was a
  larger one than usual. It came to Beatrice's turn very soon after their
  arrival, and Tavernake, squeezing his way a few steps into the dining-room,
  stood with the waiters against the wall. He looked with curious eyes upon a
  scene with which he had no manner of sympathy.</p>

  <p>A hundred or so of men had dined together in the cause of some charity.
  The odor of their dinner, mingled with the more aromatic perfume of the
  tobacco smoke which was already ascending in little blue clouds from the
  various tables, hung about the over-heated room, seeming, indeed, the fitting
  atmosphere for the long rows of guests. The majority of them were in a state
  of expansiveness. Their faces were redder than when they had sat down; a
  certain stiffness had departed from their shirt-fronts and their manners;
  their faces were flushed, their eyes watery. There were a few
  exceptions&mdash;paler-faced men who sat there with the air of endeavoring to
  bring themselves into accord with surroundings in which they had no real
  concern. Two of these looked up with interest at the first note of Beatrice's
  song. The one was sitting within a few places of the chairman, and he was too
  far away for his little start to be noticed by either Tavernake or Beatrice.
  The nearer one, however, Tavernake happened to be watching, and he saw the
  change in his expression. The man was, in his way, ugly. His face was
  certainly not a good one, although he did not appear to share the immediate
  weaknesses of his neighbors. To every note of the song he listened intently.
  When it was over, he rose and came toward Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"I beg your pardon," he said, "but did I not see you come in with the
  young lady who has just been singing?"</p>

  <p>"You may have," Tavernake answered. "I certainly did come with her."</p>

  <p>"May I ask if you are related to her?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake had got over his hesitation in replying to such questions, by
  now. He answered promptly.</p>

  <p>"I am her brother," he declared.</p>

  <p>The man produced a card.</p>

  <p>"Please introduce me to her," he begged, laconically.</p>

  <p>"Why should I?" Tavernake asked. "I have no reason to suppose that she
  desires to know you."</p>

  <p>The man stared at him for a moment, and then laughed.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "you had better show your sister my card. She is, I
  presume, a professional, as she is singing here. My desire to make her
  acquaintance is purely actuated by business motives."</p>

  <p>Tavernake moved away toward the waiting-room.</p>

  <p>The man, who according to his card was Mr. Sidney Grier, would have
  followed him in, but Tavernake stopped him.</p>

  <p>"If you will wait here," he suggested, "I will see whether my sister
  desires to meet you."</p>

  <p>Once more Mr. Sidney Grier looked surprised, but after a second glance at
  Tavernake he accepted his suggestion and remained outside. Tavernake took the
  card to Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," he announced, "there is a man outside who has heard you sing
  and who wants to be introduced."</p>

  <p>She took the card and her eyes opened wide.</p>

  <p>"Do you know who he is?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," she answered. "He is a great producer of musical comedies.
  Let me think."</p>

  <p>She stood with the card in her hand. Some one else was singing
  now&mdash;an ordinary modern ballad of love and roses, rapture and despair.
  They heard the rising and falling of the woman's voice; the clatter of the
  dinner had ceased. Beatrice stood still thinking, her fingers clinching the
  card of Mr. Sidney Grier.</p>

  <p>"You must bring him in," she said to Tavernake finally.</p>

  <p>Tavernake went outside.</p>

  <p>"My sister will see you," he remarked, with the air of one who brings good
  news.</p>

  <p>Mr. Sidney Grier grunted. He was not used to being kept waiting, even for
  a second. Tavernake ushered him into the retiring room, and the other two
  musicians who were there stared at him as at a god.</p>

  <p>"This is the gentleman whose card you have, Beatrice," Tavernake
  announced. "Mr. Sidney Grier&mdash;Miss Tavernake!"</p>

  <p>The man smiled.</p>

  <p>"Your brother seems to be suspicious of me," he declared. "I found it
  quite difficult to persuade him that you might find it interesting to talk to
  me for a few minutes."</p>

  <p>"He does not quite understand," Beatrice answered. "He has not much
  experience of musical affairs or the stage, and your name would not have any
  significance for him."</p>

  <p>Tavernake went outside and listened idly to the song which was proceeding.
  It was a class of music which secretly he preferred to the stranger and more
  haunting notes of Beatrice's melodies. Apparently the audience was of his
  opinion, for they received it with a vociferous encore, to which the young
  lady generously replied with a music-hall song about "A French lady from over
  the water." Towards the close of the applause which marked the conclusion of
  this effort, Tavernake felt himself touched lightly upon the arm. He turned
  round. By his side was standing the other dinner guest who had shown some
  interest in Beatrice. He was a man apparently of about forty years of age,
  tall and broad-shouldered, with black moustache, and dark, piercing eyes.
  Unlike most of the guests, he wore a short dinner-coat and black tie, from
  which, and his slight accent, Tavernake concluded that he was probably an
  American.</p>

  <p>"Say, you'll forgive my speaking to you," he said, touching Tavernake on
  the arm. "My name is Pritchard. I saw you come in with the young lady who was
  singing a few minutes ago, and if you won't consider it a liberty, I'll be
  very glad indeed if you'll answer me one question."</p>

  <p>Tavernake stiffened insensibly.</p>

  <p>"It depends upon the question," he replied, shortly.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's about the young lady, and that's a fact," Mr. Pritchard
  admitted. "I see that her name upon the programme is given as Miss Tavernake.
  I was seated at the other end of the room but she seemed to me remarkably
  like a young lady from the other side of the Atlantic, whom I am very anxious
  to meet."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you will kindly put your question in plain words," Tavernake
  said.</p>

  <p>"Why, that's easy," Mr. Pritchard declared. "Is Miss Tavernake really her
  name, or an assumed one? I expect it's the same over here as in my
  country&mdash;a singer very often sings under another name than her own, you
  know," he added, noting Tavernake's gathering frown.</p>

  <p>"The young lady in question is my sister, and I do not care to discuss her
  with strangers," Tavernake announced.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pritchard nodded pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course, that ends the matter," he remarked. "Sorry to have
  troubled you, anyway."</p>

  <p>He strolled off back to his seat and Tavernake returned thoughtfully to
  the dressing-room. He found Beatrice alone and waiting for him.</p>

  <p>"You've got rid of that fellow, then?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>Beatrice assented.</p>

  <p>"Yes; he didn't stay very long," she replied.</p>

  <p>"Who was he?" Tavernake asked, curiously.</p>

  <p>"From a musical comedy point of view," she said, "he was the most
  important person in London. He is the emperor of stage-land. He can make the
  fortune of any girl in London who is reasonably good-looking and who can sing
  and dance ever so little."</p>

  <p>"What did he want with you?" Tavernake demanded, suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"He asked me whether I would like to go upon the stage. What do you think
  about it, Leonard?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake, for some reason or other, was displeased.</p>

  <p>"Would you earn much more money than by singing at these dinners?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Very, very much more," she assured him.</p>

  <p>"And you would like the life?"</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Why not? It isn't so bad. I was on the stage in New York for some time
  under much worse conditions."</p>

  <p>He remained silent for a few minutes. They had made their way into the
  street now and were waiting for an omnibus.</p>

  <p>"What did you tell him?" he asked, abruptly.</p>

  <p>She was looking down toward the Embankment, her eyes filled once more with
  the things which he could not understand.</p>

  <p>"I have told him nothing yet," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"You would like to accept?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," she replied. "If only&mdash;I dared!"</p><a name="ch08"

  <br>

  <h2>VIII. WOMAN'S WILES</h2>

  <p class="first">At eleven o'clock the next morning, Tavernake presented
  himself at the Milan Court and inquired for Mrs. Wenham Gardner. He was sent
  at once to her apartments in charge of a page. She was lying upon a sofa
  piled up with cushions, wrapped in a wonderful blue garment which seemed
  somehow to deepen the color of her eyes. By her side was a small table on
  which was some chocolate, a bowl of roses, and a roll of newspapers. She held
  out her hand toward Tavernake, but did not rise. There was something almost
  spiritual about her pallor, the delicate outline of her figure, so
  imperfectly concealed by the thin silk dressing-gown, the faint, tired smile
  with which she welcomed him.</p>

  <p>"You will forgive my receiving you like this, Mr. Tavernake?" she begged.
  "To-day I have a headache. I have been anxious for your coming. You must sit
  by my side, please, and tell me at once whether you have seen Beatrice."</p>

  <p>Tavernake did exactly as he was bidden. The chair toward which she had
  pointed was quite close to the sofa, but there was no other unoccupied in the
  room. She raised herself a little on the couch and turned towards him. Her
  eyes were fixed anxiously upon his, her forehead slightly wrinkled, her voice
  tremulous with eagerness.</p>

  <p>"You have seen her?"</p>

  <p>"I have," he admitted, looking steadily into the lining of his hat.</p>

  <p>"She has been cruel," Elizabeth declared. "I can tell it from your face.
  You have bad news for me."</p>

  <p>"I do not know," Tavernake replied, "whether she has been cruel or not.
  She refuses to allow me to tell you her address. She begged me, indeed, to
  keep away from you altogether."</p>

  <p>"Why? Did she tell you why?"</p>

  <p>"She says that you are her sister, that you have no money of your own and
  that your husband has left you," Tavernake answered, deliberately.</p>

  <p>"Is that all?"</p>

  <p>"No, it is not all," he continued. "As to the rest, she told me nothing
  definite. It is quite clear, however, that she is very anxious to keep away
  from you."</p>

  <p>"But her reason?" Elizabeth persisted. "Did she give you no reason?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake looked her in the face.</p>

  <p>"She gave me no reason," he said.</p>

  <p>"Do you believe that she is justified in treating me like this?" Elizabeth
  asked, playing nervously with a pendant which hung from her smooth, bare
  neck.</p>

  <p>"Of course I do," he replied. "I am quite sure that she would not feel as
  she does unless you had been guilty of something very terrible indeed."</p>

  <p>The woman on the couch winced as though some one had struck her. A more
  susceptible man than Tavernake must have felt a little remorseful at the
  tears which dimmed for a moment her beautiful eyes. Tavernake, however,
  although he felt a moment's uneasiness, although he felt himself assailed all
  the time by a curious new emotion which he utterly failed to understand, was
  nevertheless still immune. The things which were to happen to him had not
  yet, arrived.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he continued, "I was very much disappointed to hear this,
  because I had hoped that we might have been able to let Grantham House to
  you. We cannot consider the matter at all now unless you pay for everything
  in advance."</p>

  <p>She uncovered her eyes and looked at him. People so direct of speech as
  this had come very seldom into her life. She was conscious of a thrill of
  interest. The study of men was a passion with her. Here was indeed a new
  type!</p>

  <p>"So you think that I am an adventuress," she murmured.</p>

  <div align="center">
    <img src="1203061h-images/Tavernake1.png"
         alt="Illustration"
         title="Illustration">
  </div>

  <p>He reflected for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he admitted, "that it comes to that. I should not have
  returned at all if I had not promised. If there is any message which you wish
  me to give your sister, I will take it, but I cannot tell you her
  address."</p>

  <p>She laid her hand suddenly upon his, and raising herself a little on the
  couch, leaned towards him. Her eyes and her lips both pleaded with him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she said slowly, "Beatrice is such a dear, obstinate
  creature, but she does not quite appreciate my position. Do me a favor,
  please. If you have promised not to give me her address let me at least know
  some way or some place in which I could come across her. I am sure she will
  be glad afterwards, and I&mdash;I shall be very grateful."</p>

  <p>Tavernake felt that he was enveloped by something which he did not
  understand, but his lack of experience was so great that he did not even
  wonder at his insensibility.</p>

  <p>"I shall keep my word to your sister," he announced, "in the spirit as
  well as the letter. It is quite useless to ask me to do otherwise."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was at first amazed, then angry, how angry she scarcely knew
  even herself. She had been a spoilt child, she had grown into a spoilt woman.
  Men, at least, had been ready enough to do her bidding all her life. Her
  beauty was of that peculiar kind, half seductive, half pathetic, wholly
  irresistible. And now there had come this strange, almost impossible person,
  against the armor of whose indifference she had spent herself in vain. Her
  eyes filled with tears once more as she looked at him, and Tavernake became
  uneasy. He glanced at the clock and again toward the door.</p>

  <p>"I think, if you will excuse me," he began,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she interrupted, "you are very unkind to me, very unkind
  indeed."</p>

  <p>"I cannot help it," he answered.</p>

  <p>"If you knew everything," she continued, "you would not be so obstinate.
  If Beatrice herself were here, if I could whisper something in her ear, she
  would be only too thankful that I had found her out. Beatrice has always
  misunderstood me, Mr. Tavernake. It is a little hard upon me, for we are both
  so far away from home, from our friends."</p>

  <p>"You can send her any message you like by me," Tavernake declared. "If you
  like, I will wait while you write a letter. If you really have anything to
  say to her which might change her opinion, you can write it, can't you?"</p>

  <p>She looked down at her hands&mdash;very beautiful and well-kept
  hands&mdash;and sighed. This young man, with his unusual imperturbability and
  hateful common sense, was getting on her nerves.</p>

  <p>"It is so hard to write things, Mr. Tavernake," she said, "but, of course,
  it is something to know that if the worst happens I can send her a letter. I
  shall think about that for a short time. Meanwhile, there is so much about
  her I would love to have you tell me. She has no money, has she? How does she
  support herself?"</p>

  <p>"She sings occasionally at concerts," Tavernake replied after a moment's
  pause. "I suppose there is no harm in telling you that."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth leaned towards him. She was very loth indeed to acknowledge
  defeat. Once more her voice was deliciously soft, her forehead delicately
  wrinkled, her blue eyes filled with alluring light.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she murmured, "do you know that you are not in the least
  kind to me? Beatrice and I are sisters, after all. Even she has admitted
  that. She left me most unkindly at a critical time in my life; she
  misunderstood things; if I were to see her, I could explain everything. I
  feel it very much that she is living apart from me in this city where we are
  both strangers. I am anxious about her, Mr. Tavernake. Does she want money?
  If so, will you take her some from me? Can't you suggest any way in which I
  could help her? Do be my friend, please, and advise me."</p>

  <p>Life was certainly opening out for Tavernake. The atmosphere by which he
  was surrounded, which she was deliberately creating around him, was the
  atmosphere of an unknown world. It was a position, this, entirely novel to
  him. Nevertheless, he did his best to cope with it intelligently. He
  reflected carefully before he made any reply, he refused absolutely to listen
  to the strange voices singing in his ears, and he delivered his decision with
  his usual air of finality.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said, "that since Beatrice refuses even to let you know
  her whereabouts, she would not wish to accept anything from you. It seems a
  pity," he went on, the instincts of the money-saver stirring within him; "she
  is certainly none too well off."</p>

  <p>The lady on the couch sighed.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice has at least a friend," she murmured. "It is a great deal to
  have a friend. It is more than I have. We are both so far from home here.
  Often I am sorry that we ever left America. England is not a hospitable
  country, Mr. Tavernake."</p>

  <p>Again this painfully literal young man spoke out what was in his mind.</p>

  <p>"There was a gentleman in the motor-car with you the other night," he
  reminded her.</p>

  <p>She bit her lip.</p>

  <p>"He was just an acquaintance," she answered, "a man whom I used to know in
  New York, passing through London. He called on me and asked me to go to the
  theatre and supper. Why not? I have had a terrible time during the last few
  months, Mr. Tavernake, and I am very lonely&mdash;lonelier than ever since my
  sister deserted me."</p>

  <p>Tavernake began to feel, ridiculous though it seemed, that in some subtle
  and inexplicable fashion he was in danger. At any rate, he was hopelessly
  bewildered. He did not understand why this very beautiful lady should look at
  him as though they were old friends, why her eyes should appeal to him so
  often for sympathy, why her fingers, which a moment ago were resting lightly
  upon his hand, and which she had drawn away with reluctance, should have
  burned him like pin-pricks of fire. The woman who wishes to allure may be as
  subtle as possible in her methods, but a sense of her purpose, however vague
  it may be, is generally communicated to her would be victim. Tavernake was
  becoming distinctly uneasy. He had no vanity. He knew from the first that
  this beautiful creature belonged to a world far removed from any of which he
  had any knowledge. The only solution of the situation which presented itself
  to him was that she might be thinking of borrowing money from him!</p>

  <p>"There was never a time in my life," she continued softly, "when I felt
  that I needed a friend more. I am afraid that my sister has prejudiced you
  against me, Mr. Tavernake. Beatrice is very young, and the young are not
  always sympathetic, you know. They do not make allowances, they do not
  understand."</p>

  <p>"Why did you tell Mr. Dowling things which were not true?" he asked
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>She sighed, and looked down at the handkerchief with which she had been
  toying.</p>

  <p>"It was a very silly piece of conceit," she admitted, "but, you see, I had
  to tell him something."</p>

  <p>"Why did you come to the office at all?" he continued.</p>

  <p>"Do you really want to know that?" she whispered softly.</p>

  <p>"Well,&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I will tell you," she went on suddenly. "It sounds foolish, in a way, and
  yet it wasn't really, because, you see,"&mdash;she smiled at him&mdash;"I was
  anxious about Beatrice. I saw you come out of the office that morning, and I
  recognized you at once. I knew that it was you who had been with Beatrice. I
  made an excuse about the house to come and see whether I could find you
  out."</p>

  <p>Tavernake, in whom the vanity was not yet born, missed wholly the
  significance of her smile, her trifling hesitation.</p>

  <p>"All that," he declared, "is no reason why you should have told Mr.
  Dowling that your husband was a millionaire and had given you carte blanche
  about taking a house."</p>

  <p>"Did I mention&mdash;my husband?"</p>

  <p>"Distinctly," he assured her.</p>

  <p>For the first time she had faltered in her speech. Tavernake felt that she
  herself was shaken by some emotion. Her eyes for a moment were strangely-lit;
  something had come into her face which he did not understand. Then it passed.
  The delightful smile, half deprecating, half appealing, once more parted her
  lips; the gleam of horror no longer shone in her blue eyes.</p>

  <p>"I am always so foolish about money," she declared, "so ignorant that I
  never know how I stand, but really I think that I have plenty, and a hundred
  or two more or less for rent didn't seem to matter much."</p>

  <p>It was a point of view, this, which Tavernake utterly failed to
  comprehend. He looked at her in surprise.</p>

  <p>"I suppose," he protested, "you know how much a year you have to live
  on?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It seems to vary all the time," she sighed. "There are so many
  complications."</p>

  <p>He looked at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"After all," he admitted, "you don't look as though you had much of a head
  for figures."</p>

  <p>"If only I had some one to help me!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>Tavernake moved uneasily in his chair. His sense of danger was
  growing.</p>

  <p>"If you will excuse me now," he said, "I think that I must be getting
  back. I am an employee at Dowling, Spence &amp; Company's, you know, and my
  time is not quite my own. I only came because I promised to."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she begged, looking at him full out of those wonderful
  blue eyes, "please do me a great favor."</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked with clumsy ungraciousness.</p>

  <p>"Come and see me, every now and then, and let me know how my sister is.
  Perhaps you may be able to suggest some way in which I can help her."</p>

  <p>Tavernake considered the question for a moment. He was angry with himself
  for the unaccountable sense of pleasure which her suggestion had given
  him.</p>

  <p>"I am not quite sure," he said, "whether I had better come. Beatrice
  seemed quite anxious that I should not talk about her to you at all. She did
  not like my coming to-day."</p>

  <p>"You seem to know a great deal about my sister," Elizabeth declared
  reflectively. "You call her by her Christian name and you appear to see her
  frequently. Perhaps, even, you are fond of her."</p>

  <p>Tavernake met his questioner's inquiring gaze blankly. He was almost
  indignant.</p>

  <p>"Fond of her!" he exclaimed. "I have never been fond of any one in my
  life, or anything&mdash;except my work," he added.</p>

  <p>She looked at him a little bewildered at first.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you strange person!" she cried, her lips breaking into a delightful
  smile. "Don't you know that you haven't begun to live at all yet? You don't
  even know anything about life, and at the back of it all you have capacity.
  Yes," she went on, "I think that you have the capacity for living."</p>

  <p>Her hand fell upon his with a little gesture which was half a caress. He
  looked around him as though seeking for escape. He was on his feet now and he
  clutched at his hat.</p>

  <p>"I must go," he insisted almost roughly.</p>

  <p>"Am I keeping you?" she asked innocently. "Well, you shall go as soon as
  you please, only you must promise me one thing. You must come back, say
  within a week, and let me know how my sister is. I am not half so brutal as
  you think. I really am anxious about her. Please!"</p>

  <p>"I will promise that," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Wait one moment, then," she begged, turning to the letters by her side.
  "There is just something I want to ask you. Don't be impatient&mdash;it is
  entirely a matter of business."</p>

  <p>All the time he was acutely conscious of that restless desire to get out
  of the room. The woman's white arms, from which the sleeves of her blue gown
  had fallen back, were stretched towards him as she lazily turned over her
  pile of correspondence. They were very beautiful arms and Tavernake, although
  he had had no experience, was dimly aware of the fact. Her eyes, too, seemed
  always to be trying to reach some part of him which was dead, or as yet
  unborn. He could feel her striving to get there, beating against the walls of
  his indifference. Why should a woman wear blue stockings because she had a
  blue gown, he wondered idly. She was not like Beatrice, this alluring,
  beautiful woman, who lay there talking to him in a manner whose meaning came
  to him only in strange, bewildering flashes. He could be with Beatrice and
  feel the truth of what he had once told her&mdash;that her sex was a thing
  which need not even be taken into account between them. With this woman it
  was different; he felt that she wished it to be different.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you had better tell me about that matter of business next time I
  am here," he suggested, with an abruptness which was almost brusque. "I must
  go now. I do not know why I have stayed so long."</p>

  <p>She held out her fingers.</p>

  <p>"You are a very sudden person," she declared, smiling at his discomfiture.
  "If you must go!"</p>

  <p>He scarcely touched her hand, anxious only to get away. And then the door
  opened and a man of somewhat remarkable appearance entered the room with the
  air of a privileged person. He was oddly dressed, with little regard to the
  fashion of the moment. His black coat was cut after the mode of a past
  generation, his collar was of the type affected by Gladstone and his
  fellow-statesmen, his black bow was arranged with studied negligence and he
  showed more frilled white shirt-front than is usual in the daytime. His silk
  hat was glossy but broad-brimmed; his masses of gray hair, brushed back from
  a high, broad forehead, gave him almost a patriarchal aspect. His features
  were large and fairly well-shaped, but his mouth was weak and his cheeks
  lacked the color of a healthy life. Tavernake stared at him open-mouthed. He,
  for his part, looked at Tavernake as he might have looked at some strange
  wild animal.</p>

  <p>"A thousand apologies, dear Elizabeth!" he exclaimed. "I knocked, but I
  imagine that you did not hear me. Knowing your habits, it did not occur to me
  that you might be engaged at this hour of the morning."</p>

  <p>"It is a young man from the house agent's," she announced indifferently,
  "come to see me about a flat."</p>

  <p>"In that case," he suggested amiably, "I am, perhaps, not in the way."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth turned her head slightly and looked at him; he backed
  precipitately toward the door.</p>

  <p>"In a few minutes," he said. "I will return in a few minutes."</p>

  <p>Tavernake attempted to follow his example.</p>

  <p>"There is no occasion for your friend to leave," he protested. "If you
  have any instructions for us, a note to the office will always bring some one
  here to see you."</p>

  <p>She sat up on the couch and smiled at him. His obvious embarrassment
  amused her. It was a new sort of game, this, altogether.</p>

  <p>"Come, Mr. Tavernake," she said, "three minutes more won't matter, will
  it? I will not keep you longer than that, I promise."</p>

  <p>He came reluctantly a few steps back.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he explained, "but we really are busy this morning."</p>

  <p>"This is business," she declared, still smiling at him pleasantly. "My
  sister has filled you with suspicions about me. Some of them may be
  justifiable, some are not. I am not so rich as I should like some people to
  believe. It is so much easier to live well, you know, when people believe
  that you are rolling in money. Still, I am by no means a pauper. I cannot
  afford to take Grantham House, but neither can I afford to go on living here.
  I have decided to make a change, to try and economize, to try and live within
  my means. Now will you bring me a list of small houses or flats, something at
  not more than say two or three hundred a year? It shall be strictly a
  business proceeding. I will pay you for your time, if that is necessary, and
  your commission in advance. There, you can't refuse my offer on those terms,
  can you?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake remained silent. He was conscious that his lack of response
  seemed both sullen and awkward, but he was for the moment tongue-tied. His
  habit of inopportune self-analysis had once more asserted itself. He could
  not understand the curious nature of his mistrust of this woman, nor could he
  understand the pleasure which her suggestion gave him. He wanted to refuse,
  and yet he was glad to be able to tell himself that he was, after all, but an
  employee of his firm and not in a position to decline business on their
  behalf.</p>

  <p>She leaned a little towards him; her tone was almost beseeching.</p>

  <p>"You are not going to be unkind? You will not refuse me?" she pleaded.</p>

  <p>"I will bring you a list," he answered heavily, "on the terms you
  suggest."</p>

  <p>"To-morrow morning?" she begged.</p>

  <p>"As soon as I am able," he promised.</p>

  <p>Then he escaped. Outside in the corridor, the man who had interrupted his
  interview was walking backwards and forwards. Tavernake passed him without
  responding to his bland greeting. He forgot all about the lift and descended
  five flights of stairs....</p>

  <p>A few minutes later, he presented himself at the office and reported that
  Mrs. Wenham Gardner had decided unfavorably about Grantham House, and that
  she was not disposed, indeed, to take premises of anything like such a
  rental. Mr. Dowling was disappointed, and inclined to think that his employee
  had mismanaged the affair.</p>

  <p>"I wish that I had gone myself," he declared. "She obviously wished me to,
  but it happened to be inconvenient. By-the-bye, Tavernake, close the door,
  will you? There is another matter concerning which I should like to speak to
  you."</p>

  <p>Tavernake did as he was bidden at once, without any disquietude. His own
  services to the firm were of such a nature that he had no misgiving whatever
  as to his employer's desire for a private interview.</p>

  <p>"It is about the Marston Rise estate," Mr. Dowling explained, arranging
  his pince nez. "I believe that the time is coming when some sort of overtures
  should be made. You know what has been in my mind for a very considerable
  time."</p>

  <p>Tavernake nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted, "I know quite well."</p>

  <p>"I did hear a rumor," Mr. Dowling continued, "that some one had bought one
  small plot on the outskirts of the estate. I dare say it is not true, and in
  any case it is not worth while troubling about, but it shows that the public
  is beginning to nibble. I am of opinion that the time is almost&mdash;yes,
  almost ripe for a move."</p>

  <p>"Do you wish me to do anything in the matter, sir?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>"In the first place," Mr. Dowling declared, "I should like you to try to
  find out whether any of the plots have really been sold, and, if so, to whom,
  and what would be their price. Can you do this during the week?"</p>

  <p>"I think so," Tavernake answered.</p>

  <p>"Say Monday morning," Mr. Dowling suggested, taking down his hat. "I shall
  be playing golf to-morrow and Friday, and of course Saturday. Monday morning
  you might let me have a report."</p>

  <p>Tavernake went back to his office. After all, then, things were to come to
  a crisis a little earlier than he had thought. He knew quite well that that
  report, if he made it honestly, and no other idea was likely to occur to him,
  would effectually sever his connection with Messrs. Dowling, Spence &amp;
  Company.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>IX. THE PLOT THICKENS</h2>

  <p class="first">The man whom Tavernake had left walking up and down the
  corridor lost no time in presenting himself once more at the apartments of
  Mrs. Wenham Gardner. He entered the suite without ceremony, carefully closing
  both doors behind him. It became obvious then that his deportment on the
  occasion of his previous appearance had been in the nature of a bluff. The
  air with which he looked across the room at the woman who watched him was
  furtive; the hand which laid his hat upon the table was shaking; there was a
  gleam almost of terror in his eyes. The woman remained impassive,
  inscrutable, simply watching him. After a moment or two, however, she
  spoke&mdash;a single monosyllable.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>The man broke down.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth," he exclaimed, "you are too&mdash;too ghastly! I can't stand
  it. You are unnatural."</p>

  <p>She stretched herself upon the couch and turned towards him.</p>

  <p>"Unnatural, am I?" she remarked. "And what are you?"</p>

  <p>He sank into a chair. He had become very flabby indeed.</p>

  <p>"What you are always calling me, I suppose," he muttered,&mdash;"a coward.
  You have so little consideration, Elizabeth. My health isn't what it
  was."</p>

  <p>His eyes had wandered longingly toward the cupboard at the further end of
  the apartment. The woman upon the couch smiled.</p>

  <p>"You may help yourself," she directed carelessly. "Perhaps then you will
  be able to tell me why you have come in such a state."</p>

  <p>He crossed the room in a few hasty steps, his head and shoulders
  disappeared inside the cupboard. There was the sound of the withdrawal of a
  cork, the fizz of a sodawater syphon. He returned to his place a different
  man.</p>

  <p>"You must remember my age, Elizabeth dear," he said, apologetically. "I
  haven't your nerve&mdash;it isn't likely that I should have. When I was
  twenty-five, there was nothing in the world of which I was afraid."</p>

  <p>She looked him over critically.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am not so absolutely courageous as you think," she remarked.
  "To tell you the truth, there are a good many things of which I am afraid
  when you come to me in such a state. I am afraid of you, of what you will do
  or say."</p>

  <p>"You need not be," he assured her hastily. "When I am away from you, I am
  dumb. What I suffer no one knows. I keep it to myself."</p>

  <p>She nodded, a little contemptuously.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you do your best," she declared. "Tell me, now, what is this
  fresh thing which has disturbed you?"</p>

  <p>Her visitor stared at her.</p>

  <p>"Does there need to be any fresh thing?" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"I suppose it is something about Wenham?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The man shivered. He opened his lips and closed them again. The woman's
  tone, if possible, grew colder.</p>

  <p>"I hope you are not going to tell me that you have disobeyed my orders,"
  she said.</p>

  <p>"No," he protested, "no! I was there yesterday. I came back by the mail
  from Penzance. I had to motor thirty miles to catch it."</p>

  <p>"Something has happened, of course," she went on, "something which you are
  afraid to tell 'me. Sit up like a man, my dear father, and let me have the
  truth."</p>

  <p>"Nothing fresh has happened at all," he assured her. "It is simply that
  the memory of the day I spent at that place and that the sight of him has got
  on my nerves till I can't sleep or think of anything else."</p>

  <p>"What rubbish!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"You have only seen the place in fine weather," he continued, dropping his
  voice a little. "Elizabeth, you have no idea what it is really like.
  Yesterday morning I got out of the train at Bodmin and I motored through to
  the village of Clawes. After that there were five miles to walk. There's no
  road, only a sort of broken track, and for the whole of that five miles there
  isn't even a farm building to be seen and I didn't meet a human soul. There
  was a sort of pall of white-gray mists everywhere over the moor, sometimes so
  dense that I couldn't see my way, and you could stop and listen and there
  wasn't a thing to be heard, not even a sheep bell."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly..</p>

  <p>"My dear, foolish father," she murmured, "you don't understand what a rest
  cure is. This is quite all right, quite as it should be. Poor Wenham has been
  seeing too many people all his life&mdash;that is why we have to keep him
  quiet for a time. You can skip the scenery. I suppose you got to the house at
  last?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I got there," continued her father. "You know what a bleak-looking
  place it is, right on the side of a bare hill&mdash;a square, gray stone
  place just the color of the hillside. Well, I got there and walked in. There
  was Ted Mathers, half dressed, no collar, with a bottle of whiskey on the
  table, playing some wretched game of cards by himself. Elizabeth, what a
  brute that man is!"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Go on," she said. "What about Wenham?"</p>

  <p>"He was there in a corner, gazing out of the window. When I came he sprang
  up, but when he saw who it was, he&mdash;he tried to hide. He was afraid of
  me."</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"He said that I&mdash;I reminded him of you."</p>

  <p>"Absurd!" she murmured. "Tell me, how did he look?"</p>

  <p>"Ill, wretched, paler and thinner than ever, and wilder looking."</p>

  <p>"What did Mathers say about him?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"What could he? He told me that he cried all day and begged to be taken
  back to America."</p>

  <p>"No one goes near the place, I suppose?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Not a soul. A man comes from the village to sell things once a week.
  Mathers knows when to expect him and takes care that Wenham is not around.
  They are out of the world there&mdash;no road, no paths, nothing to bring
  even a tourist. I could have imagined such a spot in Arizona, Elizabeth, but
  in England&mdash;no!"</p>

  <p>"Has he any amusements at all?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>The man's hands were shaking; once more his eyes went longingly toward the
  cupboard.</p>

  <p>"He has made&mdash;a doll," he said, "carved it out of a piece of wood and
  dressed it in oddments from his ties. Mathers showed it to me as a joke.
  Elizabeth, it was wonderful&mdash;horrible!"</p>

  <p>"Why?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>"It is you," he continued, moistening his lips with his tongue, "you, in a
  blue gown&mdash;your favorite shade. He has even made blue stockings and
  strange little shoes. He has got some hair from somewhere and parted it just
  like yours."</p>

  <p>"It sounds very touching," she remarked.</p>

  <p>The man was shivering again.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth," he said, "I do not think that he means it kindly. Mathers
  took me up into his room. He has made something there which looks like a
  scaffold. The doll was hanging by a piece of string from the gallows.
  Elizabeth!&mdash;my God, but it was like you!" he cried, suddenly dropping
  his head upon his arms.</p>

  <p>For a moment, a reflection of the terror which had seized him flashed in
  her own face. It passed quickly away. She laughed mockingly.</p>

  <p>"My dear father," she protested, "you are certainly not yourself this
  morning."</p>

  <p>"I saw you swinging," he muttered, "swinging by that piece of cord! There
  was a great black pin through your heart. Elizabeth, if he should get away
  sometime! If some one should come over from America and discover where he
  was! If he should find us out! Oh, my God, if he should find us out!"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth had risen to her feet. She was standing now before the fire, her
  left elbow resting upon the mantelpiece, a trifle of silver gleaming in her
  right hand.</p>

  <p>"Father," she said, "there is no danger in life for those who know no
  fear. Look at me."</p>

  <p>His eyes sought hers, fascinated.</p>

  <p>"If he should find me out," she continued, "it would be no such terrible
  thing, after all. It would be the end."</p>

  <p>Her fingers disclosed the little ornament she was carrying&mdash;a tiny
  pistol. She slipped it back into her pocket. The man was wondering how such a
  thing as this came to be his daughter.</p>

  <p>"You have courage, Elizabeth," he whispered.</p>

  <p>"I have courage," she assented, "because I have brains. I never allow
  myself to be in a position where I should be likely to get the worst of it.
  Ever since the day when he turned so suddenly against me, I have been
  careful."</p>

  <p>Her father leaned towards her.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth," he said, "I never really understood. What was it that came
  over him so suddenly? One day he was your slave, the next I think he would
  have murdered you if he could."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Honestly," she replied, "I felt it impossible to keep up the sham any
  longer. I married Wenham Gardner in New York because he was supposed to be a
  millionaire and because it seemed to be the best thing to do, but as to
  living with him, I never meant that. You know how ridiculous his behavior was
  on the boat. He never let me out of his sight, but swore that he was going to
  give up smoking and drinking and lead a new life for my sake. I really
  believe he meant it, too."</p>

  <p>"Wouldn't it have been better, dear," her father suggested, timidly, "to
  have encouraged him?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"He was absolutely hopeless," she declared. "You say that I have no
  nerves; that is because I do not allow myself to suffer. If I had gone on
  living with Wenham, it would have driven me mad. His habits, his manner of
  life, everything disgusted me. Until I came to see so much of him, I never
  understood what the term 'decadent' really can mean. The very touch of him
  grew to be hateful. No woman could live with such a man. By the way, he
  signed the draft, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>Her father handed her a slip of paper, which she looked at and locked in
  her drawer.</p>

  <p>"Did he make any trouble about it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>The professor shivered.</p>

  <p>"He refused to sign it," he said, in a low tone, "swore he would never
  sign it. Mathers sent me out for a few minutes, made me go into another room.
  When I came back, he gave me the draft. I heard him calling out."</p>

  <p>"Mathers certainly earns his money," she remarked, drily.</p>

  <p>He gazed at her with grudging admiration. This was his daughter, his own
  flesh and blood. Back through the years, for a moment, he seemed to see her,
  a child with hair down her back, sitting on his knee, listening to his
  stories, wondering at the little arts and tricks by which he had wrested
  their pennies and sixpennies from a credulous public. Phrenologist,
  hypnotist, conjurer&mdash;all these things the great Professor Franklin had
  called himself. Often, from the rude stage where he had given his
  performance, he had terrified to death the women and children of his
  audience. It flashed upon him at that moment that never, even in the days of
  her childhood, had he seen fear in Elizabeth's face.</p>

  <p>"You should have been a man, Elizabeth," he muttered.</p>

  <p>She shook her head, smiling as though not ill-pleased at the
  compliment.</p>

  <p>"The power of a man is so limited," she declared. "A woman has more
  weapons."</p>

  <p>"More weapons indeed," the professor agreed, as his eyes traveled over the
  slim yet wonderful perfection of her form, lingered for a moment at the
  little knot of lace at her throat, wrestled with the delicate sweetness of
  her features, struggling hard to think from whom among his ancestors could
  have come a creature so physically attractive.</p>

  <p>"More weapons, indeed," he repeated. "Elizabeth, what a gift&mdash;what a
  gift!"</p>

  <p>"You speak," she replied, "as though it were an evil one."</p>

  <p>"I was only thinking," he said, "that it seems a pity. You are so
  wonderful, we might have found an easier and a less dangerous way to
  fortune."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"The Bohemian blood in me, I suppose," she remarked. "The crooked ways
  attract, you know, when one has been brought up as I was."</p>

  <p>"Your poor mother had no love for them," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice has inherited everything that belonged to my mother. I am your
  own daughter, father. You ought to be proud of me. But there, I gave you
  another commission. Is it true that Jerry is really here?"</p>

  <p>"He arrived in England on Wednesday on the Lusitania. He has been in town
  all the time since."</p>

  <p>A distinct frown darkened her face.</p>

  <p>"He must have had my letter, then," she murmured, half to herself.</p>

  <p>"Without a doubt," her father admitted. "Elizabeth, why do you take
  chances about seeing this man? He was fond of you in New York, I know, but
  then he was fond of his brother, too. He may not believe your story. It may
  be dangerous."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"I think I can convince Jerry Gardner of anything I choose to tell him,"
  she said. "Besides, it is absolutely necessary that I have some information
  about Wenham's affairs. He must have a great deal more money somewhere and I
  must find out how we are to get at it."</p>

  <p>The professor shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I don't like it," he muttered. "Supposing he finds Beatrice!"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice is made of silent stuff," she declared. "I should never be
  afraid of her. All the same, I wish I could find out just where she is. It
  would look better if we were living together."</p>

  <p>The professor shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"She left us of her own free will," he said, "and I don't believe,
  Elizabeth, that she would ever come back again. She knew very well what she
  was doing. She knew that our views of life were not hers. She didn't know
  half but she knew enough. You were quite right in what you said just now;
  Beatrice was more like her mother, and her mother was a good woman."</p>

  <p>"Really!" Elizabeth remarked, insolently.</p>

  <p>"Don't answer like that," he blustered, striking the table. "She was your
  mother, too."</p>

  <p>The woman's face was inscrutable, hard, and flawless behind the little
  cloud of tobacco smoke. The man began to tremble once more. Every time he
  ventured to assert himself, a single look from her was sufficient to quell
  him.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth," he muttered, "you haven't a heart, you haven't a soul, you
  haven't a conscience. I wonder&mdash;what sort of a woman you are!"</p>

  <p>"I am your daughter," she reminded him, pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"I was never quite so bad as that," he went on, taking a large silk
  handkerchief from his pocket and dabbing his forehead. "I had to live and
  times were hard. I have cheated the public, perhaps. I haven't been above
  playing at cards a little cleverly, or making something where I could out of
  the weaker men. But, Elizabeth, I am afraid of you."</p>

  <p>"Men are generally afraid of the big stakes," she remarked, flicking the
  ash from her cigarette. "They will cheat and lie for halfpennies, but they
  are bad gamblers when life or death&mdash;the big things are in the balance.
  Bah!" she went on. "Father, I want Jerry Gardner to come and see me."</p>

  <p>"If you can't make him come, my dear," the professor said, "I am sure it
  will be of no use my trying."</p>

  <p>"He has had my letter," she continued, half to herself; "he has had my
  letter and he does not come."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to be done but wait," her father decided.</p>

  <p>"And meanwhile," she went on, "supposing he were to discover Beatrice,
  supposing they two were to come together; supposing he were to tell her what
  he knows and she were to tell him what she guessed!"</p>

  <p>The professor buried his face in his hands. Elizabeth threw her cigarette
  away with an impatient gesture.</p>

  <p>"What an idiot I am!" she declared. "What is the use of wasting time like
  this?"</p>

  <p>There was a knock at the door. A trim-looking French maid presented
  herself. She addressed her mistress in voluble French. A coiffeur and a
  manicurist were waiting in the next apartment; it was time that Madame
  habited herself. The professor listened to these announcements with an air of
  half-admiring wonder.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I must be going," he said, rising to his feet. "There is just
  one thing I should like to ask you, Elizabeth, if I may, before I go."</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Who was the young man whom I met here just now?"</p>

  <p>"Why do you ask that?" she demanded.</p>

  <p>"I really do not know," her father replied, thoughtfully, "except that his
  appearance seemed a little singular. In some respects he appeared so
  commonplace. His clothes and bearing, in fact, were so ordinary that I was
  surprised to find him here with you. And, on the other hand, his
  face&mdash;you must remember, my dear, that this is entirely a professional
  instinct; I am still interested in faces&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Quite so," she admitted. "Go on. The young man rather puzzles me myself.
  I should like to hear what you make of him. What did you think of his
  face?"</p>

  <p>"There was something powerful about it," he declared, "something dogged,
  splendid, narrow, impossible,&mdash;the sort of face which belongs to a man
  who achieves great things because he is too stupid to recognize failure, even
  when it has him in its arms and its fingers are upon his throat. That young
  man has qualities, my dear, I am sure. Mind you, at present they are dormant,
  but he has qualities."</p>

  <p>She led him to the door.</p>

  <p>"My dear father," she said, "sometimes I really respect you. If you should
  come across that young man again, keep your eye upon him. He knows one thing
  at least which I wish he would tell us&mdash;he knows where Beatrice is."</p>

  <p>Her father looked at her in amazement.</p>

  <p>"He knows where Beatrice is and he has not told you?"</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"You tried to have him tell you and he refused?" the professor
  persisted.</p>

  <p>"Exactly," she admitted.</p>

  <p>Her father put on his hat.</p>

  <p>"I knew that young man was something out of the common."</p><a name="ch10"

  <h2>X. THE JOY OF BATTLE</h2>

  <p class="first">They sat on the trunk of a fallen tree, in the topmost
  corner of the field. In the hedge, close at hand, was a commotion of birds.
  In the elm tree, a little further away, a thrush was singing. A soft west
  wind blew in their faces; the air immediately around them was filled with
  sunlight. Yet almost to their feet stretched one of those great arms of the
  city&mdash;a suburb, with its miles of villas, its clanging of electric cars,
  its waste plots, its rows of struggling shops. And only a little further away
  still, the body itself&mdash;the huge city, throbbing beneath its pall of
  smoke and cloud. The girl, who had been gazing steadily downwards for several
  moments, turned at last to her companion.</p>

  <p>"Do you know," she said, "that this makes me think of the first night you
  spoke to me? You remember it&mdash;up on the roof at Blenheim House?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake did not answer for a moment. He was looking through a
  queerly-shaped instrument that he had brought with him at half-a-dozen stakes
  that he had laboriously driven into the ground some distance away. He was
  absolutely absorbed in his task.</p>

  <p>"The main avenue," he muttered softly to himself. "Yes, it must be a
  trifle more to the left. Then we get all the offshoots parallel and the
  better houses have their southern aspect. I beg your pardon, Beatrice, did
  you say anything?" he broke off suddenly.</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"Nothing worth mentioning. I was just thinking that it reminded me a
  little up here of the first time you and I ever talked together."</p>

  <p>He glanced down at the panorama below, with its odd jumble of hideous
  buildings, softened here and there with wreaths of sunstained smoke, its
  great blots of ugliness irredeemable, insistent.</p>

  <p>"It's different, of course," she went on. "I remember, even now, the view
  from the house-top that night. In a sense, it was finer than this; everything
  was more lurid and yet more chaotic; one simply felt that underneath all
  those mysterious places was some great being, toiling and
  struggling&mdash;Life itself, groaning through space with human cogwheels. Up
  here one sees too much. Oh, my dear Leonard," she continued, "to think that
  you, too, should be one of the devastators!"</p>

  <p>He fitted his instrument into its case and replaced it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "you mustn't call me hard names. I shall remind you of
  the man whose works you are making me read. You know what he says&mdash;'The
  aesthete is, after all, only a dallier. The world lives and progresses by
  reason of its utilitarians.' This hill represents to me most of the things
  that are worth having in life."</p>

  <p>She laughed shortly.</p>

  <p>"You will cut down those hedges and drive away the birds to find a fresh
  home; you will plough up the green grass, cut out a street and lay down
  granite stones. Then I see your ugly little houses coming up like mushrooms
  all over the place. You are a vandal, my dear Leonard."</p>

  <p>"I am simply obeying the law," he answered. "After all, even from your own
  point of view, I do not think that it is so bad. Look closer, and you will
  find that the hedges are blackened here and there with smuts. The birds will
  find a better dwelling place further away. See how the smoke from those
  factory chimneys is sending its smuts across these fields. They are no longer
  country; they are better gathered in."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"There is something about life," she said, sadly, "which terrifies me.
  Every force that counts seems to be destructive."</p>

  <p>Up the steep hill behind them came the puffing and groaning of a small
  motor-car. They both turned their heads to watch it come into view. It was an
  insignificant affair of an almost extinct pattern, a single cylinder machine
  with a round tonneau back. The engine was knocking badly as the driver
  brought it to a standstill a few yards away from them. Involuntarily
  Tavernake stiffened as he saw the two men who descended from it, and who were
  already passing through the gate close to where they were. One was Mr.
  Dowling, the other the manager of the bank where they kept their account. Mr.
  Dowling recognized his manager with surprise but much cordiality.</p>

  <p>"Dear me!" he exclaimed. "Dear me, this is most fortunate! You know Mr.
  Tavernake, of course, Belton? My manager, Mr. Tavernake&mdash;Mr. Belton, of
  the London &amp; Westminster Bank. I have brought Mr. Belton up here,
  Tavernake, to have a look round, so that he may know what we mean to do with
  all the money we shall have to come and borrow, eh?"</p>

  <p>The bank manager smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is a very fine situation," he remarked.</p>

  <p>The eyes of the two men fell upon Beatrice, who had drawn a little to one
  side.</p>

  <p>"May we have the pleasure, Tavernake?" Mr. Dowling said, graciously. "You
  are not married, I believe?"</p>

  <p>"No, this is my sister," Tavernake answered, slowly,&mdash;"Mr. Belton and
  Mr. Dowling."</p>

  <p>The two men acknowledged the salute with some slight surprise. Beatrice,
  although her clothes were simple, had always the air of belonging to a
  different world.</p>

  <p>"Your brother, my dear Miss Tavernake," Mr. Dowling declared, "is a
  perfect genius at discovering these desirable sites. This one I honestly
  consider to be the find of our lifetime. We have now," he proceeded, turning
  to Mr. Belton, "certain information that the cars will run to whatever point
  we desire in this vicinity, and the Metropolitan Railway has also arranged
  for an extension of its system. To-morrow I propose," Mr. Dowling continued,
  holding the sides of his coat and assuming a somewhat pompous manner, "to
  make an offer for the whole of this site. It will involve a very large sum of
  money indeed, but I am convinced that it will be a remunerative
  speculation."</p>

  <p>Tavernake remained grimly silent. This was scarcely the time or the place
  which he would have selected for an explanation with his employer. There were
  signs, however, that the thing was to be forced upon him.</p>

  <p>"I am very pleased indeed to meet you here, Tavernake," Mr. Dowling went
  on, "pleased both for personal reasons and because it shows, if I may be
  allowed to say so, the interest which you take in the firm's business, that
  you should devote your holiday to coming and&mdash;er&mdash;surveying the
  scene of our exploits, so to speak. Perhaps now that you are here you would
  be able to explain to Mr. Belton better than I should, just what it is that
  we propose."</p>

  <p>Tavernake hesitated for a moment. Finally, however, he proceeded to make
  clear a very elaborate and carefully thought out building scheme, to which
  both men listened with much attention. When he had finished, however, he
  turned round to Mr. Dowling, facing him squarely.</p>

  <p>"You will understand, sir," he concluded, "that a scheme such as I have
  pointed out could only be carried through if the whole of the property were
  in one person's hands. I may say that the information to which you referred a
  few days ago was perfectly correct. A considerable portion of the south side
  of the hill has already been purchased, besides certain other plots which
  would interfere considerably with any comprehensive scheme of building."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dowling's face fell at once; his tone was one of annoyance mingled
  with irritation.</p>

  <p>"Come, come," he declared, "this sounds very bad, Mr. Tavernake, very
  neglectful, very careless as to the interests of the firm. Why did we not
  keep our eye upon it? Why did we not forestall this other purchaser, eh? It
  appears to me that we have been slack, very slack indeed."</p>

  <p>Tavernake took a small book from his pocket.</p>

  <p>"You will remember, sir," he said, "that it was on the eleventh of May
  last year when I first spoke to you of this site."</p>

  <p>"Well, well," Mr. Dowling exclaimed, sharply, "what of it?"</p>

  <p>"You were starting out for a fortnight's golf somewhere," Tavernake
  continued, "and you promised to look into the affair when you returned. I
  spoke to you again but you declared that you were far too busy to go into the
  matter at all for the present, you didn't care about this side of London, you
  considered that we had enough on hand&mdash;in fact, you threw cold water
  upon the idea."</p>

  <p>"I may not have been very enthusiastic at first," Mr. Dowling admitted,
  grudgingly. "Latterly, however, I have come round to your views."</p>

  <p>"There have been several articles in various newspapers, and a good deal
  of talk," Tavernake remarked, "which have been more effectual, I think, in
  bringing you round, than my advice. However, what I wish to say to you is
  this, sir, that when I found myself unable to interest you in this scheme, I
  went into it myself to some extent."</p>

  <p>"Went into it yourself?" Mr. Dowling repeated, incredulously. "What do you
  mean, Tavernake? What do you mean, sir?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that I have invested my savings in the purchase of several plots
  of land upon this hillside," Tavernake explained.</p>

  <p>"On your own account?" Mr. Dowling demanded. "Your savings, indeed!"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Tavernake answered. "Why not?"</p>

  <p>"But it's the firm's business, sir&mdash;the firm's, not yours!"</p>

  <p>"The firm had the opportunity," Tavernake pointed out, "and were not
  inclined to avail themselves of it. If I had not bought the land when I did,
  some one else would have bought the whole of it long ago."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dowling was obviously in a furious temper.</p>

  <p>"Do you mean to tell me, sir," he exclaimed, "that you dared to enter into
  private speculations while still an employee of the firm? It is a most
  unheard-of thing, unwarranted, ridiculous. I shall require you, sir, to at
  once make over the plots of land to us&mdash;to the firm, you understand. We
  shall give you your price, of course, although I expect you paid much more
  for it than we should have done. Still, we must give you what you paid, and
  four per cent interest for your money."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," Tavernake replied, "but I am afraid that I should require
  better terms than that. In fact," he continued, "I do not wish to sell. I
  have given a great deal of thought and time to this matter, and I intend to
  carry it out as a personal speculation."</p>

  <p>"Then you will carry it out, sir, from some other place than from within
  the walls of my office," Mr. Dowling declared, furiously. "You understand
  that, Tavernake?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly," Tavernake answered. "You wish me to leave you. It is very
  unwise of you to suggest it, but I am quite prepared to go."</p>

  <p>"You will either resell me those plots at cost price, or you shall not set
  foot within the office again," Mr. Dowling insisted. "It is a gross breach of
  faith, this. I never heard of such a thing in all my life. Most
  unprofessional, impossible behavior!"</p>

  <p>Tavernake showed no signs of anger&mdash;he simply turned a little
  away.</p>

  <p>"I shall not sell you my land, Mr. Dowling," he said, "and it will suit me
  very well to leave your employ. You appear," he continued, "to expect some
  one else to do the whole of the work for you while you reap the entire
  profits. Those days have gone by. My business in the world is to make a
  fortune for myself, and not for you!"</p>

  <p>"How dare you, sir!" Mr. Dowling cried. "I never heard such impertinence
  in my life."</p>

  <p>"You haven't done a stroke of work for five years," Tavernake went on,
  unmoved, "and my efforts have supplied you with a fairly good income. In
  future, those efforts will be directed towards my own advancement."</p>

  <p>Mr. Dowling turned back toward the car.</p>

  <p>"Young man," he said, "you can brazen it out as much as you like, but you
  have been guilty of a gross breach of faith. I shall take care that the exact
  situation is made known in all responsible quarters. You'll get no situation
  with any firm with whom I am acquainted&mdash;I can promise you that. If you
  have anything more to say to Dowling, Spence &amp; Company, let it be in
  writing."</p>

  <p>They parted company there and then. Tavernake and Beatrice went down the
  hill in silence.</p>

  <p>"Does this bother you at all?" she inquired presently.</p>

  <p>"Nothing to speak of," Tavernake answered. "It had to come. I wasn't quite
  ready but that doesn't matter."</p>

  <p>"What shall you do now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Borrow enough to buy the whole of the hill," he replied.</p>

  <p>She looked back.</p>

  <p>"Won't that mean a great deal of money?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"It will be a big thing, of course," he admitted. "Never mind, I dare say
  I shall be able to interest some one in it. In any case, I never meant Mr.
  Dowling to make a fortune out of this."</p>

  <p>They walked on in silence a little further. Then she spoke again, with
  some hesitation.</p>

  <p>"I suppose that what you have done is quite fair, Leonard?"</p>

  <p>He answered her promptly, without any sign of offence at her question.</p>

  <p>"As a matter of fact," he confessed, "it is an unusual thing for any one
  in the employ of a firm of estate agents to make speculations on their own
  account in land. In this case, however, I consider that I was justified. I
  have opened up three building speculations for the firm, on each one of which
  they have made a great deal of money, and I have not even had my salary
  increased, or any recognition whatever offered me. There is a debt, of
  course, which an employee owes to his employer. There is also a debt,
  however, which the employer owes to his employee. In my case I have never
  been treated with the slightest consideration of any sort. What I have done I
  shall stick to. After all, I am more interested in making money for myself
  than for other people."</p>

  <p>They had reached the corner of the field now, and turning into the lane
  commenced the steep descent. It was Sunday evening, and from all the little
  conventicles and tin churches below, the bells began their unmusical summons.
  From further away in the distance came the more melodious chiming from the
  Cathedral and the city churches. The shriller and nearer note, however,
  prevailed. The whole medley of sound was a discord. As they descended, they
  could see the black-coated throngs slowly moving towards the different places
  of worship. There was something uninspiring about it all. She shuddered.</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she said, "I wonder why you are so anxious to get on in the
  world. Why do you want to be rich?"</p>

  <p>He was glancing back toward the hill, the light of calculations in his
  eyes. Once more he was measuring out those plots of land, calculating rent,
  deducting interest.</p>

  <p>"We all seek different things," he replied tolerantly,&mdash;"some fame,
  some pleasure. Mr. Dowling, for instance, has no other ambition than to
  muddle round the golf links a few strokes better than his partner."</p>

  <p>"And you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"It is success I seek," he answered. "Women, as a rule, do not understand.
  You, for instance, Beatrice, are too sentimental. I am very practical. It is
  money that I want. I want money because money means success."</p>

  <p>"And afterwards?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He was attending to her no longer. They were turning now into the broad
  thoroughfare at the bottom of the lane, at the end of which a tram-car was
  waiting. He scribbled a few, final notes into his pocket-book.</p>

  <p>"To-morrow," he exclaimed, with the joy of battle in his tone, "to-morrow
  the fight begins in earnest!"</p>

  <p>Beatrice passed her hand through his arm.</p>

  <p>"Not only for you, dear friend, but for me," she said. "For you? What do
  you mean?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>"I have been trying to tell you all day," she continued, "but you have
  been too engrossed. Yesterday afternoon I went to see Mr. Grier at the Atlas
  Theatre. I had my voice tried, and to-morrow night I am going to take a small
  part in the new musical comedy."</p>

  <p>Tavernake stared at her in something like consternation. His ideas as to
  the stage and all that belonged to it were of a primitive order. Mrs.
  Fitzgerald was perhaps as near as possible to his idea of the type. He
  glanced incredulously at Beatrice&mdash;slim, quietly dressed, yet with the
  unmistakable, to him mysterious, distinction of breeding.</p>

  <p>"You an actress!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Dear Leonard," she said, "this is going to be a part of your education.
  To-morrow night you shall come to the theatre and wait for me at the
  stage-door."</p>

  <h2>XI. A BEWILDERING OFFER</h2>

  <p class="first">Elizabeth stood with her hands behind her back, leaning
  slightly against the writing-table. The professor, with his broad-brimmed hat
  clinched in his fingers, walked restlessly up and down the little room. The
  discussion had not been altogether a pleasant one. Elizabeth was composed but
  serious, her father nervous and excited.</p>

  <p>"You are mad, Elizabeth!" he declared. "Is it that you do not understand,
  or will not? I tell you that we must go."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Where would you drag me to?" she asked. "We certainly can't go back to
  New York."</p>

  <p>He turned fiercely upon her.</p>

  <p>"Whose fault is it that we can't?" he demanded. "If it weren't for you and
  your confounded schemes, I could be walking down Broadway next week. God's
  own city it is, too!" he muttered. "I wish we'd never seen those two young
  men."</p>

  <p>"It was a pity, perhaps," she admitted, "yet we had to do something. We
  were absolutely stonybroke, as they say over here."</p>

  <p>"Anyway, we've got to get out of this," the professor declared.</p>

  <p>"My dear father," she replied, "I will agree that if a new city or a new
  world could arise from the bottom of the sea, where Professor Franklin was
  unknown, and his beautiful daughter Elizabeth had neyer been heard of, it
  might perhaps be advisable for us to go there. As it is--"</p>

  <p>"There is Rome," he exclaimed, "or some of the smaller places! We have
  money for a time. We could get another draft, perhaps, from Wenham."</p>

  <p>She shook her head. "We are just as safe here as anywhere on the
  Continent," she remarked.</p>

  <p>Once more he struck the table. Then he threw out his hands above his head
  with the melodramatic instinct which had always been strong in his blood.</p>

  <p>"Do you think that I am a fool?" he cried. "Do you think I do not know
  that if there were not something moving in your brain you would think no more
  of that clerk, that bourgeois estate agent, than of the door-mat beneath your
  feet? It is what I always complain about. You make use of me as a tool. There
  are always things which I do not understand. He comes here, this young man,
  under a pretext, whether he knows it or not. You talk to him for an hour at a
  time. There should be nothing in your life which I do not know of,
  Elizabeth," he continued, his voice suddenly hoarse as he leaned towards her.
  "Can't you see that there is danger in friendships for you and for me, there
  is danger in intimacies of any sort? I share the danger; I have a right to
  share the knowledge. This young man has no money of his own, I take it. Of
  what use is he to us?"</p>

  <p>"You are too hasty, my dear father," she replied. "Let me assure you that
  there is nothing at all mysterious about Mr. Tavernake. The simple truth is
  that the young man rather attracts me."</p>

  <p>The professor gazed at her incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Attracts you! He!"</p>

  <p>"You have never perfectly understood me, my dear parent," she murmured.
  "You have never appreciated that trait in my character, that strange
  preference, if you like, for the absolutely original. Now in all my life I
  never met such a young man as this. He wears the clothes and he has the
  features and speech of just such a person as you have described, but there is
  a difference."</p>

  <p>"A difference, indeed!" the professor interrupted roughly. "What
  difference, I should like to know?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders lightly.</p>

  <p>"He is stolid without being stupid," she explained. "He is entirely
  self-centered. I smile at him, and he waits patiently until I have finished
  to get on with our business. I have said quite nice things to him and he has
  stared at me without change of expression, absolutely without pleasure or
  emotion of any sort."</p>

  <p>"You are too vain, Elizabeth," her father declared. "You have been spoilt.
  There are a few people in the world whom even you might fail to charm. No
  doubt this young man is one of them."</p>

  <p>She sighed gently.</p>

  <p>"It really does seem," she admitted, "as though you were right, but we
  shall see. By-the-bye, hadn't you better go? The five minutes are nearly
  up."</p>

  <p>He came over to her side, his hat and gloves in his hand, prepared for
  departure.</p>

  <p>"Will you tell me, upon your honor, Elizabeth," he begged, "that there is
  no other reason for your interest? That you are not engaged in any fresh
  schemes of which I know nothing? Things are bad enough as they are. I cannot
  sleep, I cannot rest, for thinking of our position. If I thought that you had
  any fresh plans on hand&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She flicked the ash from her cigarette and checked him with a little
  gesture.</p>

  <p>"He knows where Beatrice is," she remarked thoughtfully, "and I can't get
  him to tell me. There is nothing beyond&mdash;absolutely nothing."...</p>

  <p>When Tavernake was announced, Elizabeth was still smoking, sitting in an
  easy-chair and looking into the fire. Something in her attitude, the droop of
  her head as it rested upon her fingers, reminded him suddenly of Beatrice. He
  showed no other emotion than a sudden pause in his walk across the room. Even
  that, however, in a person whose machinelike attitude towards her provoked
  her resentment, was noticeable.</p>

  <p>"Good morning, my friend!" she said pleasantly. "You have brought me the
  fresh list?"</p>

  <p>"Unfortunately, no, madam," Tavernake answered. "I have called simply to
  announce that I am not able to be of any further assistance to you in the
  matter."</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment without remark.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious, Mr. Tavernake?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied. "The fact is I am not in a position to help you. I have
  left the employ of Messrs. Dowling, Spence &amp; Company."</p>

  <p>"Of your own accord?" she inquired quietly.</p>

  <p>"No, I was dismissed," he confessed. "I should have been compelled to
  leave in a very short time, but Mr. Dowling forestalled me."</p>

  <p>"Won't you sit down and tell me about it?" she invited.</p>

  <p>He looked her in the eyes, square and unflinching. He was still able to do
  that!</p>

  <p>"It could not possibly interest you," he said.</p>

  <p>"And&mdash;my sister? You have seen her?"</p>

  <p>"I have seen your sister," Tavernake answered, without hesitation.</p>

  <p>"You have a message for me?"</p>

  <p>"None," he declared.</p>

  <p>"She refuses&mdash;to be reconciled, then?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid she has no friendly feelings towards you."</p>

  <p>"She gave you no reason?"</p>

  <p>"No direct reason," he admitted, "but her attitude is&mdash;quite
  uncompromising."</p>

  <p>She rose and swept across the floor towards him. With firm but gentle
  fingers she took his worn bowler hat and mended gloves from his hand. Her
  gesture guided him towards a sofa.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice has prejudiced you against me," she murmured. "It is not fair.
  Please come and sit down&mdash;for five minutes," she pleaded. "I want you to
  tell me why you have quarrelled with that funny little man, Mr. Dowling."</p>

  <p>"But, madam,&mdash;" he protested.</p>

  <p>"If you refuse, I shall think that my sister has been telling you stories
  about me," she declared, watching him closely.</p>

  <p>Tavernake drew a little away from her but seated himself on the sofa which
  she had indicated. He took up as much room as possible, and to his relief she
  did not persist in her first intention, which was obviously to seat herself
  beside him.</p>

  <p>"Your sister has told me nothing about you whatsoever," he said
  deliberately. "At the same time, she asked me not to give you her
  address."</p>

  <p>"We will talk about that presently," she interrupted. "In the first place,
  tell me why you have left your place."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Dowling discovered," he told her, in a matter-of-fact tone, "that I
  had been doing some business on my own account. He was quite right to
  disapprove. I have not been back to the office since he found it out."</p>

  <p>"What sort of business?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"The business of the firm is to buy property in undeveloped districts and
  sell it for building estate," he explained. "I have been very successful
  hitherto in finding sites for their operations. A short time ago, I
  discovered one so good that I invested all my own savings in buying certain
  lots, and have an option upon the whole. Mr. Dowling found it out and
  dismissed me."</p>

  <p>"But it seems most unfair," she declared.</p>

  <p>"Not at all," he answered. "In Mr. Dowling's place I should have done the
  same thing. Every one with his way in life to make must look out for himself.
  Strictly speaking, what I did was wrong. I wish, however, that I had done it
  before. One must think of one's self first."</p>

  <p>"And now?" she inquired. "What are you going to do now?"</p>

  <p>"I am going to find a capitalist or float a company to buy the rest of the
  site," he announced. "After that, we must see about building. There is no
  hurry about that, though. The first thing is to secure the site."</p>

  <p>"How much money does it require?"</p>

  <p>"About twelve thousand pounds," he told her.</p>

  <p>"It seems very little," she murmured.</p>

  <p>"The need for money comes afterwards," he explained. "We want to drain and
  plan and build without mortgages. As soon as we are sure of the site, one can
  think of that. My option only extends for a week or so."</p>

  <p>"Do you really think that it is a good speculation?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I do not think about such matters," he answered, drily. "I know."</p>

  <p>She leaned back in her chair, watching him for several
  seconds&mdash;admiring him, as a matter of fact. The profound conviction of
  his words was almost inspiring. In her presence, and she knew that she was a
  very beautiful woman, he appeared, notwithstanding his absence of any
  knowledge of her sex and his lack of social status, unmoved, wholly
  undisturbed. He sat there in perfect naturalness. It did not seem to him even
  unaccountable that she should be interested in his concerns. He was not
  conceited or aggressive in any way. His complete self-confidence lacked any
  militant impulse. He was&mdash;himself, impervious to surroundings, however
  unusual.</p>

  <p>"Why should I not be your capitalist?" she inquired slowly.</p>

  <p>"Have you as much as twelve thousand pounds that you want to invest?" he
  asked, incredulously.</p>

  <p>She rose to her feet and moved across to her desk. He sat quite still,
  watching her without any apparent curiosity. She unlocked a drawer and
  returned to him with a bankbook in her hand.</p>

  <p>"Add that up," she directed, "and tell me how much I have."</p>

  <p>He drew a lead pencil from his pocket and quickly added up the total.</p>

  <p>"If you have not given any cheques since this was made up," he said
  calmly, "you have a credit balance of thirteen thousand, one hundred and
  eighteen pounds, nine shillings and fourpence. It is very foolish of you to
  keep so much money on current account. You are absolutely losing about eight
  pounds a week."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is foolish of me, I suppose," she admitted, "but I have no one to
  advise me just now. My father knows no more about money than a child, and I
  have just had quite a large amount paid to me in cash. I only wish we could
  get Beatrice to share some of this, Mr. Tavernake."</p>

  <p>He made no remark. To all appearance, he had never heard of her sister.
  She came and sat down by his side again.</p>

  <p>"Will you have me for a partner, Mr. Tavernake?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>Then, indeed, for a moment, the impassivity of his features relaxed. He
  was frankly amazed.</p>

  <p>"You cannot mean this," he declared. "You know nothing about the value of
  the property, nothing about the affair at all. It is quite impossible."</p>

  <p>"I know what you have told me," she said. "Is not that enough? You are
  sure that it will make money and you have just told me how foolish I am to
  keep so much money in my bank. Very well, then, I give it to you to invest.
  You must pay me quite a good deal of interest."</p>

  <p>"But you know nothing about me," he protested, "nothing about the
  property."</p>

  <p>"One must trust somebody," she replied. "Why shouldn't I trust you?"</p>

  <p>He was nonplussed. This woman seemed to have an answer for everything.
  Besides, when once he had got over the unexpectedness of the thing, it was,
  of course, a wonderful stroke of fortune for him. Then came a whole rush of
  thoughts, a glow which he thrust back sternly. It would mean seeing her
  often; it would mean coming here to her rooms; it would mean, perhaps, that
  she might come to look upon him as a friend. He set his teeth hard. This was
  folly!</p>

  <p>"Have you any idea about terms?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"My dear friend," she said, "why do you ask me such a question? You know
  quite well that I am not competent to discuss terms with you. Listen. You are
  engaged in a speculation to carry out which you want the loan of twelve
  thousand pounds. Draw up a paper in which you state what my share will be of
  the profits, what interest I shall get for my money, and give particulars of
  the property. Then I will take it to my solicitor, if you insist upon it,
  although I am willing to accept what you think is fair."</p>

  <p>"You must take it to a solicitor, of course," he answered, thoughtfully.
  "I may as well tell you at once, however, that he will probably advise you
  against investing it in such a way."</p>

  <p>"That will make no difference at all," she declared. "Solicitors hate all
  investments, I know, except their horrid mortgages. There are only two
  conditions that I shall make."</p>

  <p>"What are they?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"The first is that you must not say a word of this to my sister."</p>

  <p>Tavernake frowned.</p>

  <p>"That is a little difficult," he remarked. "It happens that your sister
  knows something about the estate and my plans."</p>

  <p>"There is no need to tell her the name of your partner," Elizabeth said.
  "I want this to be our secret entirely, yours and mine."</p>

  <p>Her hand fell upon his; he gripped the sides of his chair. Again he was
  conscious of this bewildering, incomprehensible sensation.</p>

  <p>"And the other condition?" he demanded, hoarsely.</p>

  <p>"That you come sometimes and tell me how things are going on."</p>

  <p>"Come here?" he repeated.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Please! I am very lonely. I shall look forward to your visits."</p>

  <p>Tavernake rose slowly to his feet. He held out his hand&mdash;she knew
  better than to attempt to keep him. He made a speech which was for him
  gallant, but while he made it he looked into her eyes with a directness to
  which she was indeed unaccustomed.</p>

  <p>"I shall come," he said. "I should have wanted to come, anyhow."</p>

  <p>Then he turned abruptly away and left the room. It was the first speech of
  its sort which he had ever made in his life.</p>

  <h2>XII. TAVERNAKE BLUNDERS</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake felt that he had indeed wandered into an alien
  world as he took his place the following evening among the little crowd of
  people who were waiting outside the stage-door of the Atlas Theatre. These
  were surroundings to which he was totally unaccustomed. Two very handsome
  motor-cars were drawn up against the curb, and behind them a string of
  electric broughams and taxicabs, proving conclusively that the young ladies
  of the Atlas Theatre were popular in other than purely theatrical
  circles.</p>

  <p>The handful of young men by whom Tavernake was surrounded were of a genus
  unknown to him. They were all dressed exactly alike, they all seemed to
  breathe the same atmosphere, to exhibit the same indifference towards the
  other loungers. One or two more privileged passed in through the stage-door
  and disappeared. Tavernake contented himself with standing on the edge of the
  curbstone, his hands thrust into the pockets of his dark overcoat, his bowler
  hat, which was not quite the correct shape, slightly on the back of his head;
  his serious, stolid face illuminated by the gleam from a neighboring gas
  lamp.</p>

  <p>Presently, people began to emerge from the door. First of all, the
  musicians and a little stream of stage hands.</p>

  <p>Then a girl's hat appeared in the doorway, and the first of the Atlas
  young ladies came out, to be claimed at once by her escort. Very soon
  afterwards, Beatrice arrived. She recognized Tavernake at once and crossed
  over to him.</p>

  <p>"Well?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"You looked very nice," he said, slowly, as he led the way down the
  street. "Of course, I knew about your singing, but everything
  else&mdash;seemed such a surprise."</p>

  <p>"For instance?"</p>

  <p>"Why, I mean your dancing," he went on, "and somehow or other you looked
  different on the stage."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"'Different' won't do for me," she persisted. "I must have something more
  specific."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, you looked much prettier than I thought you were," Tavernake
  declared, solemnly. "You looked exceedingly nice."</p>

  <p>"You really thought so?" she asked, a little doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I really thought so. I thought you looked much nicer than any of the
  others."</p>

  <p>She squeezed his arm affectionately.</p>

  <p>"Dear Leonard," she said, "it's so nice to have you think so. Do you know,
  Mr. Grier actually asked me out to supper."</p>

  <p>"What impertinence!" Tavernake muttered.</p>

  <p>Beatrice threw her head back and laughed.</p>

  <p>"My dear brother," she protested, "it was a tremendous compliment. You
  must remember that it was entirely through him, too, that I got the
  engagement. Four pounds a week I am going to have. Just think of it!"</p>

  <p>"Four pounds a week is all very well," Tavernake admitted. "It seems a
  great deal of money to earn like that. But I don't think you ought to go out
  to supper with any one whom you know so slightly."</p>

  <p>"Dear prig! You know, you are a shocking prig, Leonard."</p>

  <p>"Am I?" he answered, without offence, and with the air of one seriously
  considering the subject.</p>

  <p>"Of course you are. How could you help it, living the sort of life you've
  led all your days? Never mind, I like you for it. I don't know whether I want
  to go out to supper with anybody&mdash;I really haven't decided yet&mdash;but
  if I did, it would certainly be better for me to go with Mr. Grier, because
  he can do me no end of good at the theatre, if he likes."</p>

  <p>Tavernake was silent for several moments. He was conscious of feeling
  something which he did not altogether understand. He only knew that it
  involved a strong and unreasonable dislike to Mr. Grier. Then he remembered
  that he was her brother, that he had the right to speak with authority.</p>

  <p>"I hope that you will not go out to supper with any one," he said.</p>

  <p>She began to laugh but checked herself.</p>

  <p>"Well," she remarked, "that sounds very terrible. Shall we take a 'bus? To
  tell you the truth, I am dying of hunger. We rehearsed for two hours before
  the performance, and I ate nothing but a sandwich&mdash;I was so
  excited."</p>

  <p>Tavernake hesitated a moment&mdash;he certainly was not himself this
  evening!</p>

  <p>"Would you like to have some supper at a restaurant," he asked, "before we
  go home?"</p>

  <p>"I should love it," she declared, taking his arm as they passed through a
  stream of people. "To tell you the truth, I was so hoping that you would
  propose it."</p>

  <p>"I think," Tavernake said, deliberately, "that there is a place a little
  way along here."</p>

  <p>They pushed their way down the Strand and entered a restaurant which
  Tavernake knew only by name. A small table was found for them and Beatrice
  looked about with delight.</p>

  <p>"Isn't this jolly!" she exclaimed, taking off her gloves. "Why, there are
  five or six of the girls from the theatre here already. There are two, see,
  at the corner table, and the fair-haired girl&mdash;she is just behind me in
  the chorus."</p>

  <p>Tavernake glanced around. The young women whom she pointed out were all
  escorted by men who were scrupulously attired in evening dress. She seemed to
  read his thoughts as she laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"You stupid boy," she said. "You don't suppose that I want to be like
  them, do you? There are lots of things it's delightful to look on at, and
  that's all. Isn't this fish good? I love this place."</p>

  <p>Tavernake looked around him with an interest which he took no pains to
  conceal. Certainly the little groups of people by whom they were surrounded
  on every side had the air of finding some zest in life which up to the
  present, at any rate, had escaped him. They came streaming in, finding
  friends everywhere, laughing and talking, insisting upon tables in impossible
  places, calling out greetings to acquaintances across the room, chaffing the
  maitre d'hotel who was hastening from table to table. The gathering babel of
  voices was mingled every now and then with the popping of corks, and behind
  it all were the soft strains of a very seductive little band, perched up in
  the balcony. Tavernake felt the color mounting into his cheeks. It was true:
  there was something here which was new to him!</p>

  </div>

  <p>"Beatrice," he asked her suddenly, "have you ever drunk champagne?"</p>

  <p>She laughed at him.</p>

  <p>"Often, my dear brother," she answered. "Why?"</p>

  <p>"I never have," he confessed. "We are going to have some now."</p>

  <p>She would have checked him but he had summoned a waiter imperiously and
  given his order.</p>

  <p>"My dear Leonard," she protested, "this is shocking extravagance."</p>

  <p>"Is it?" he replied. "I don't care. Tell me about the theatre. Were they
  kind to you there? Will you be able to keep your place?"</p>

  <p>"The girls were all much nicer than I expected," she told him, "and the
  musical director said that my voice was much too good for the chorus. Oh, I
  do hope that they will keep me!"</p>

  <p>"They would be idiots if they didn't," he declared, vigorously. "You sing
  better and you dance more gracefully and to me you seemed much prettier than
  any one else there."</p>

  <p>She laughed into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"My dear brother," she exclaimed, "your education is progressing indeed!
  It is positively the first evening I have ever heard you attempt to make
  pretty speeches, and you are quite an adept already."</p>

  <p>"I don't know about that," he protested. "I suppose it never occurred to
  me before that you were good-looking," he added, examining her critically,
  "or I dare say I should have told you so. You see, one doesn't notice these
  things in an ordinary way. Lots of other people must have told you so,
  though."</p>

  <p>"I was never spoilt with compliments," she said. "You see, I had a
  beautiful sister."</p>

  <p>The words seemed to have escaped her unconsciously. Almost as they passed
  her lips, her expression changed. She shivered, as though reminded of
  something unpleasant. Tavernake, however, noticed nothing. For the greater
  part of the day he had been sedulously fighting against a new and
  unaccustomed state of mind. He had found his thoughts slipping away, time
  after time, until he had had to set his teeth and use all his will power to
  keep his attention concentrated upon his work. And now once more they had
  escaped, again he felt the strange stir in his blood. The slight flush on his
  cheek grew suddenly deeper. He looked past the girl opposite to him, out of
  the restaurant, across the street, into that little sitting-room in the Milan
  Court. It was Elizabeth who was there in front of him. Again he heard her
  voice, saw the turn of her head, the slow, delightful curve of the lips, the
  eyes that looked into his and spoke to him the first strange whispers of a
  new language. His heart gave a quick throb. He was for the moment
  transformed, a prisoner no longer, a different person, indeed, from the
  stolid, well-behaved young man who found himself for the first time in his
  life in these unaccustomed surroundings. Then Beatrice leaned towards him,
  her voice brought him back to the present&mdash;not, alas, the voice which at
  that moment he would have given so much to have heard.</p>

  <p>"To-night," she murmured, "I feel as though we were at the beginning of
  new things. We must drink a toast."</p>

  <p>Tavernake filled her glass and his own.</p>

  <p>"Luck to you in your new profession!" he said.</p>

  <p>"And here is one after your own heart, you most curious of men!" she
  exclaimed, a few seconds later. "To the undiscovered in life!"</p>

  <p>He drained his glass and set it down empty.</p>

  <p>"The undiscovered," he muttered, looking around. "It is a very good toast,
  Beatrice. There are many things of which one might remain ignorant all one's
  life if one relied wholly upon one's own perceptions."</p>

  <p>"I believe," she agreed, "that if I had not appeared you were in great
  danger of becoming narrow."</p>

  <p>"I am sure of it," he answered, "but you see you came."</p>

  <p>She was thoughtful for a moment.</p>

  <p>"This reminds me just a little of that first dreary feast of ours," she
  said. "You knew what it was like then to feed a genuinely starving girl. And
  I was miserable, Leonard. It didn't seem to me that there was any other end
  save one."</p>

  <p>"You've got over all that nonsense?" he asked anxiously.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I suppose so," she answered. "You see, I've started life again and
  one gets stronger. But there are times even now," she added, "when I am
  afraid."</p>

  <p>The mirth had suddenly died from her face. She looked older, tired, and
  careworn. The shadows were back under her eyes; she glanced around almost
  timorously. He filled her glass.</p>

  <p>"That is foolishness," he said. "Nothing nor anybody can harm you
  now."</p>

  <p>Some note in his voice attracted her attention. Strong and square, with
  hard, forceful face, he sat wholly at his ease among these unfamiliar
  surroundings, a very tower of refuge, she felt, to the weak. His face was not
  strikingly intellectual&mdash;she was not sure now about his mouth&mdash;but
  one seemed to feel that dogged nature, the tireless pains by which he would
  pursue any aim dear to him. The shadows passed away from her mind. What was
  dead was gone! It was not reasonable that she should be haunted all her days
  by the ghosts of other people's sins. The atmosphere of the place, the
  atmosphere of the last few hours, found its way again into her blood. After
  all, she was young, the music was sweet, her pulses were throbbing to the
  tune of this new life. She drank her wine and laughed, her head beating time
  to the music.</p>

  <p>"We have been sad long enough," she declared. "You and I, my dear serious
  brother, will embark in earnest now upon the paths of frivolity. Tell me, how
  did things go to-day?"</p>

  <p>It flashed into his mind that he had great news, but that it was not for
  her. About that matter there was still doubt in his mind, but he could not
  speak of it.</p>

  <p>"I have had an offer," he said guardedly. "I cannot say much about it at
  present, for nothing is certain, but I am sure that I shall be able to raise
  the money somehow."</p>

  <p>His tone was calm and confident. There was no self-assurance or bluster
  about it, and yet it was convincing. She looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"You are a very positive person, Leonard," she remarked. "You must have
  great faith in yourself, I think."</p>

  <p>He considered the question for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I have," he admitted. "I do not think that there is any other way
  to succeed."</p>

  <p>The atmosphere of the place was becoming now almost languorous. The band
  had ceased to play; little parties of men and women were standing about,
  bidding one another goodnight. The lamps had been lowered, and in the gloom
  the voices and laughter seemed to have become lower and more insinuating; the
  lights in the eyes of the women, as they passed down the room on their way
  out, softer and more irresistible.</p>

  <p>"I suppose we must go," she said reluctantly.</p>

  <p>Tavernake paid his bill and they turned into the street. She took his arm
  and they turned westward. Even out here, the atmosphere of the restaurant
  appeared to have found its way. The soberness of life, its harder and more
  practical side, was for the moment obscured. It was not the daytime crowd,
  this, whose footsteps pressed the pavements. The careworn faces of the
  money-seekers had vanished. The men and women to whom life was something of a
  struggle had sought their homes&mdash;resting, perhaps, before they took up
  their labors again. Every moment taxicabs and motor-cars whirled by, flashing
  upon the night a momentary impression of men in evening dress, of women in
  soft garments with jewels in their hair. The spirit of pleasure seemed to
  have crept into the atmosphere. Even the poorer people whom they passed in
  the street, were laughing or singing.</p>

  <p>Tavernake stopped short.</p>

  <p>"To-night," he declared, "is not the night for omnibuses. We are going to
  have a taxicab. I know that you are tired."</p>

  <p>"I should love it," she admitted.</p>

  <p>They hailed one and drove off. Beatrice leaned back among the cushions and
  closed her eyes, her ungloved hand rested almost caressingly upon his. He
  leaned forward. There were new things in the world&mdash;he was sure of it
  now, sure though they were coming to him through the mists, coming to him so
  vaguely that even while he obeyed he did not understand. Her full, soft lips
  were slightly parted; her heavily-fringed eyelids closed; her deep brown
  hair, which had escaped bounds a little, drooping over her ear. His fingers
  suddenly clasped hers tightly.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice!" he whispered.</p>

  <p>She sat up with a start, her eyes questioning his, the breath coming
  quickly through her parted lips.</p>

  <p>"Once you asked me to kiss you, Beatrice," he said. "To-night&mdash;I am
  going to."</p>

  <p>She made no attempt to repulse him. He took her in his arms and kissed
  her. Even in that moment he knew that he had made a mistake. Nevertheless, he
  kissed her again and again, crushing her lips against his.</p>

  <p>"Please let me go, Leonard," she begged at last.</p>

  <p>He obeyed at once. He understood quite well that some strange thing had
  happened. It seemed to him during those next few minutes that everything
  which had passed that night was a dream, that this vivid picture of a life
  more intense, making larger demands upon the senses than anything he had yet
  experienced, was a mirage, a thing which would live only in his memory, a
  life in which he could never take any part. He had blundered; he had come
  into a new world and he had blundered. A sense of guilt was upon him. He had
  a sudden wild desire to cry out that it was Elizabeth whom he had kissed.
  Beatrice was sitting upright in her place, her head turned a little away from
  him. He felt that she was expecting him to speak&mdash;that there were
  inevitable words which he should say. His silence was a confession. He would
  have lied but the seal was upon his lips. So the moment passed, and Tavernake
  had taken another step forward towards his destiny! ...</p>

  <p>As he helped her out of the cab, her fingers tightened for a moment upon
  his hand. She patted it gently as she passed out before him into the house,
  leaving the door open. When he had paid the cabman and followed, she had
  disappeared. He looked into the sitting-room; it was empty. Overhead, he
  could hear her footsteps as she ascended to her room.</p>

  <h2>XIII. AN EVENING CALL</h2>

  <p class="first">In the morning, when he left for the city, she was not down.
  When he came home in the evening, she was gone. Without removing his hat or
  overcoat, he took the letter which he found propped up on the mantelpiece and
  addressed to him to the window and read it.</p>

  <p>DEAR BROTHER LEONARD,&mdash;It wasn't your fault and I don't think it was
  mine. If either of us is to blame, it is certainly I, for though you are such
  a clever and ambitious young person, you really know very little indeed of
  the world,&mdash;not so much, I think, as I do. I am going to stay for a few
  nights, at any rate, with one of the girls at the theatre, who I know wants
  some one to share her tiny flat with her. Afterwards, I shall see.</p>

  <p>Don't throw this letter in the fire and don't think me ungrateful. I shall
  never forget what you did for me. How could I?</p>

  <p>I will send you my address as soon as I am sure of it, or you can always
  write me to the theatre.</p>
  <pre>
                Good-bye, dear Leonard,
                                        YOUR SISTER BEATRICE.
</pre>

  <p>Tavernake looked from the sheet of notepaper out across the gray square.
  He knew that he was very angry, angry though he deliberately folded the
  letter up and placed it in his pocket, angry though he took off his overcoat
  and hung it up with his usual care; but his anger was with himself. He had
  blundered badly. This episode of his life was one which he had better forget.
  It was absolutely out of harmony with all his ideas. He told himself that he
  was glad Beatrice was gone. Housekeeping with an imaginary sister in this
  practical world was an absurdity. Sooner or later it must have come to an
  end. Better now, before it had gone too far&mdash;better now, much better!
  All the same, he knew that he was going to be very lonely.</p>

  <p>He rang the bell for the woman who waited upon them, and whom he seldom
  saw, for Beatrice herself had supplied their immediate wants. He found some
  dinner ready, which he ate with absolute unconsciousness. Then he threw
  himself fiercely into his work. It was all very well for the first hour or
  so, but as ten o'clock grew near he began to find a curious difficulty in
  keeping his attention fixed upon those calculations. The matter of average
  rentals, percentage upon capital&mdash;things which but yesterday he had
  found fascinating&mdash;seemed suddenly irksome. He could fix his attention
  upon nothing. At last he pushed his papers away, put on his hat and coat, and
  walked into the street.</p>

  <p>At the Milan Court, the hall-porter received his inquiry for Elizabeth
  with an air of faint but well-bred surprise. Tavernake, in those days, was a
  person exceedingly difficult to place. His clothes so obviously denoted the
  station in life which he really occupied, while the slight imperiousness of
  his manner, his absolute freedom from any sort of nervousness or awkwardness,
  seemed to bespeak a consideration which those who had to deal with him as a
  stranger found sometimes a little puzzling.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Wenham Gardner is in her rooms, I believe, sir," the man said. "If
  you will wait for a moment, I will inquire."</p>

  <p>He disappeared into his office, thrusting his head out, a moment or two
  later, with the telephone receiver still in his hand.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Gardner would like the name again, sir, please," he remarked.</p>

  <p>Tavernake repeated it firmly.</p>

  <p>"You might say," he added, "that I shall not detain her for more than a
  few minutes."</p>

  <p>The man disappeared once more. When he returned, he indicated the lift to
  Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"If you will go up to the fifth floor, sir," he said, "Mrs. Gardner will
  see you."</p>

  <p>Tavernake found his courage almost leaving him as he knocked at the door
  of her rooms. Her French maid ushered him into the little sitting-room,
  where, to his dismay, he found three men, one sitting on the table, the other
  two in easy-chairs. Elizabeth, in a dress of pale blue satin, was standing
  before the mirror. She turned round as Tavernake entered.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake shall decide!" she exclaimed, waving her hand to him. "Mr.
  Tavernake, there is a difference of opinion about my earrings. Major Post
  here,"&mdash;she indicated a distinguished-looking elderly gentleman, with
  carefully trimmed beard and moustache, and an eyeglass attached to a thin
  band of black ribbon&mdash;"Major Post wants me to wear turquoises. I prefer
  my pearls. Mr. Crease half agrees with me, but as he never agrees with any
  one, on principle, he hates to say so. Mr. Faulkes is wavering. You shall
  decide; you, I know, are one of those people who never waver."</p>

  <p>"I should wear the pearls," Tavernake said.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth made them a little courtesy.</p>

  <p>"You see, my dear friends," she declared, "you have to come to England,
  after all, to find a man who knows his own mind and speaks it without fear.
  The pearls it shall be."</p>

  <p>"It may be decision," Crease drawled, speaking with a slight American
  accent, "or it may be gallantry. Mr. Tavernake knew your own choice."</p>

  <p>"The last word, as usual," she sighed. "Now, if you good people will
  kindly go on downstairs, I will join you in a few minutes. Mr. Tavernake is
  my man of business and I am sure he has something to say to me."</p>

  <p>She dismissed them all pleasantly. As soon as the door was closed she
  turned to Tavernake. Her manner seemed to become a shade less gracious.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I came," Tavernake confessed bluntly. "I was restless
  and I wanted to see you."</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment and then she laughed. Tavernake felt a
  sense of relief; at least she was not angry.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you strangest of mortals!" she exclaimed, holding out her hands.
  "Well, you see me&mdash;in one of my most becoming gowns, too. What do you
  think of the fit?"</p>

  <p>She swept round and faced him again with an expectant look. Tavernake, who
  knew nothing of women's fashions, still realized the superbness of that one
  unbroken line.</p>

  <p>"I can't think how you can move a step in it," he said, "but you
  look&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused. It was as though he had lost his breath. Then he set his teeth
  and finished.</p>

  <p>"You look beautiful," he declared. "I suppose you know that. I suppose
  they've all been telling you so."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"They haven't all your courage, dear Briton," she remarked, "and if they
  did tell me so, I am not sure that I should be convinced. You see, most of my
  friends have lived so long and lived so quickly that they have learned to
  play with words until one never knows whether the things they speak come from
  their hearts. With you it is different."</p>

  <p>"Yes," Tavernake admitted, "with me it is different!"</p>

  <p>She glanced at the clock.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "you have seen me and I am glad to have seen you, and
  you may kiss my fingers if you like, and then you must run away. I am engaged
  to have supper with my friends downstairs."</p>

  <p>He raised her fingers clumsily enough to his lips and kept them there for
  a moment. When he let them go, she wrung them as though in pain, and looked
  at him. She turned abruptly away. In a sense she was disappointed. After all,
  he was an easy victim!</p>

  <p>"Elise," she called out, "my cloak."</p>

  <p>Her maid came hurrying from the next room. Elizabeth turned towards her,
  holding out her shoulders. She nodded to Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"You know the way down, Mr. Tavernake? I shall see you again soon, sha'n't
  I? Good-night!"</p>

  <p>She scarcely glanced at him as she sent him away, yet Tavernake walked on
  air.</p>

  <h2>XIV. A WARNING FROM Mr. PRITCHARD</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake hesitated for a moment under the portico of the
  Milan Court, looking out at the rain which had suddenly commenced to descend.
  He scarcely noticed that he had a companion until the man who was standing by
  his side addressed him.</p>

  <p>"Say, your name is Tavernake, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake, who had been on the point of striding away, turned sharply
  around. The man who had spoken to him was wearing morning clothes of dark
  gray tweed and a soft Homburg hat. His complexion was a little sallow and he
  was clean-shaven except for a slight black moustache. He was smoking a black
  cigar and his accent was transatlantic. Something about his appearance struck
  Tavernake as being vaguely familiar, but he could not at first recall where
  he had seen him before.</p>

  <p>"That is my name, certainly," Tavernake admitted.</p>

  <p>"I am going to ask you a somewhat impertinent question," his neighbor
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"I suppose you can ask it," Tavernake rejoined. "I am not obliged to
  answer, am I?"</p>

  <p>The man smiled.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "that's honest, at any rate. Are you in a hurry for a few
  minutes?"</p>

  <p>"I am in no particular hurry," Tavernake answered. "What do you want?"</p>

  <p>"A few nights ago," the stranger continued, lowering his voice a little,
  "I met you with a young lady whose appearance, for some reason which we
  needn't go into, interested me. To-night I happened to overhear you
  inquiring, only a few minutes ago, for the sister of the same young
  lady."</p>

  <p>"What you heard doesn't concern me in the least," Tavernake retorted. "I
  should say that you had no business to listen."</p>

  <p>His companion smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well," he declared, "I have always heard a good deal about British
  frankness, and it seems to me that I'm getting some. Anyway, I'll tell you
  where I come in. I am interested in Mrs. Wenham Gardner. I am interested,
  also, in her sister, whom I think you know&mdash;Miss Beatrice Franklin, not
  Miss Tavernake!"</p>

  <p>Tavernake made no immediate reply. The man was an American, without a
  doubt. Perhaps he knew something of Beatrice. Perhaps this was one of the
  friends of that former life concerning which she had told him nothing.</p>

  <p>"You are not, by any chance, proposing," Tavernake said at last, "to
  discuss either of these ladies with me? I do not know you or what your
  business may be. In any case, I am going now."</p>

  <p>The other laid his hand on Tavernake's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"You'll be soaked to the skin," he protested. "I want you to come into the
  smoking-room here with me for a few minutes. We will have a drink together
  and a little conversation, if you don't mind."</p>

  <p>"But I do mind," Tavernake declared. "I don't know who you are and I don't
  want to know you, and I am not going to talk about Mrs. Gardner, or any other
  lady of my acquaintance, with strangers. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>"One moment, please, Mr. Tavernake."</p>

  <p>Tavernake hesitated. There was something curiously compelling in the
  other's smooth, distinct voice.</p>

  <p>"I'd like you to take this card," he said. "I told you my name before but
  I expect you've forgotten it,&mdash;Pritchard&mdash;Sam Pritchard. Ever heard
  of me before?"</p>

  <p>"Never!"</p>

  <p>"Not to have heard of me in the United States," the other continued, with
  a grim smile, "would be a tribute to your respectability. Most of the crooks
  who find their way over here know of Sam Pritchard. I am a detective and I
  come from New York."</p>

  <p>Tavernake turned and looked the man over. There was something convincing
  about his tone and appearance. It did not occur to him to doubt for a moment
  a word of this stranger's story.</p>

  <p>"You haven't anything against her&mdash;against either of them?" he asked,
  quickly.</p>

  <p>"Nothing directly," the detective answered. "All the same, you have been
  calling upon Mrs. Wenham Gardner this evening, and if you are a friend of
  hers I think that you had better come along with me and have that talk."</p>

  <p>"I will come," Tavernake agreed, "but I come as a listener. Remember that
  I have nothing to tell you. So far as you are concerned, I do not know either
  of those ladies."</p>

  <p>Pritchard smiled.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "I guess we'll let it go at that. All the same, if you
  don't mind, we'll talk. Come this way and we'll get to the smoking-room
  through the hotel. It's under cover."</p>

  <p>Tavernake moved restlessly in his chair.</p>

  <p>"What the devil is all this talk about crooks!" he exclaimed impatiently.
  "I didn't come here to listen to this sort of thing. I am not sure that I
  believe a word of what you say."</p>

  <p>"Why should you," Pritchard remarked, "without proof? Look here."</p>

  <p>He drew a leather case from his pocket and spread it out. There were a
  dozen photographs there of men in prison attire. The detective pointed to
  one, and with a little shiver Tavernake recognized the face of the man who
  had been sitting at the right hand of Elizabeth.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean to say," he faltered, "that Mrs. Gardner&mdash;"</p>

  <p>The detective folded up his case and replaced it in his pocket.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "we haven't any photographs of your lady friend there, nor
  of her sister. And yet, it may not be so far off."</p>

  <p>"If you are trying to fasten anything upon those ladies,&mdash;" Tavernake
  began, threateningly.</p>

  <p>The detective laughed and patted him on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"It isn't my business to try and fasten things upon any one," he
  interrupted. "At the same time, you seem to be a friend of Mrs. Wenham
  Gardner, and it is just as well that some one should warn her."</p>

  <p>"Warn her of what?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>The detective looked at his cigar meditatively.</p>

  <p>"Make her understand that there is trouble ahead," he replied.</p>

  <p>Tavernake sipped his whiskey and soda and lit a cigarette. Then he turned
  in his chair and looked thoughtfully at his companion. Pritchard was a
  striking-looking man, with hard, clean-cut features&mdash;a man of
  determination.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pritchard, I am a clerk in an estate office. My people were
  work-people and I am trying to better myself in the world. I haven't learned
  how to beat about a subject, but I have learned a little of the world, and I
  know that people such as you are not in the habit of doing things without a
  reason. Why the devil have you brought me in here to talk about Mrs. Gardner
  and her sister? If you've anything to say, why don't you go to Mrs. Gardner
  herself and say it? Why do you come and talk to strangers about their
  affairs? I am here listening to you, but I tell you straight I don't like
  it."</p>

  <p>Pritchard nodded.</p>

  <p>"Say, I am not sure that I don't like that sort of talk," he declared. "I
  know all about you, young man. You're in Dowling &amp; Spence's office and
  you've got to quit. You've got an estate you want financing. Miss Beatrice
  Franklin was living under your roof&mdash;as your sister, I
  understand&mdash;until yesterday, and Mrs. Gardner, for some reason of her
  own, seems to be doing her best to add you to the list of her admirers. I am
  not sure what it all means but I could make a pretty good guess. Here's my
  point, though. You're right. I didn't bring you here for your health. I
  brought you here because you can do me a service and yourself one at the same
  time, and you'll be doing no one any harm, nobody you care about, anyway. I
  have no grudge against Miss Beatrice. I'd just as soon she kept out of the
  trouble that's coming."</p>

  <p>"What is this service?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>Pritchard for the moment evaded the point.</p>

  <p>"I dare say you can understand, Mr. Tavernake," he said, "that in my
  profession one has to sometimes go a long way round to get a man or a woman
  just where you want them. Now we merely glanced at that table as we came in,
  and I can tell you this for gospel truth&mdash;there isn't one of that crowd
  that I couldn't, if I liked, haul back to New York on some charge or another.
  You wonder why I don't do it. I'll tell you. It's because I am
  waiting&mdash;waiting until I can bring home something more serious,
  something that will keep them out of the way for just as long as possible. Do
  you follow me, Mr. Tavernake?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I do," Tavernake answered, doubtfully. "You are only talking of
  the men, of course?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard smiled.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he agreed, "I am only talking of the men. At the same
  time, I guess I'm not betraying any confidence, or telling you anything that
  Mrs. Wenham Gardner doesn't know herself, when I say that she's doing her
  best to qualify for a similar position."</p>

  <p>"You mean that she is doing something against the law!" Tavernake
  exclaimed, indignantly. "I don't believe it for a moment. If she is
  associating with these people, it's because she doesn't know who they
  are."</p>

  <p>Pritchard flicked the ash from his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "every man has a right to his own opinions, and for my
  part I like to hear any one stick up for his friends. It makes no odds to me.
  However, here are a few facts I am going to bring before you. Four months
  ago, one of the turns at a vaudeville show down Broadway consisted of a
  performance by a Professor Franklin and his two daughters, Elizabeth and
  Beatrice. The professor hypnotized, told fortunes, felt heads, and the usual
  rigmarole. Beatrice sang, Elizabeth danced. People came to see the show, not
  because it was any good but because the girls, even in New York, were
  beautiful."</p>

  <p>"A music-hall in New York!" Tavernake muttered.</p>

  <p>The detective nodded.</p>

  <p>"Among the young bloods of the city," he continued, "were two brothers, as
  much alike as twins, although they aren't twins, whose names were Wenham and
  Jerry Gardner. There's nothing in fast life which those young men haven't
  tried. Between them, I should say they represented everything that was known
  of debauchery and dissipation. The eldest can't be more than twenty-seven
  to-day, but if you were to see them in the morning, either of them, before
  they had been massaged and galvanized into life, you'd think they were little
  old men, with just strength enough left to crawl about. Well, to cut a long
  story short, both of them fell in love with Elizabeth."</p>

  <p>"Brutes!" Tavernake interjected.</p>

  <p>"I guess they found Miss Elizabeth a pretty tough nut to crack," the
  detective went on. "Anyhow, you know what her price was from her name, which
  is hers right enough. Wenham, who was a year younger than his brother, was
  the first to bid it. Three months ago, Mr. and Mrs. Wenham Gardner, Miss
  Beatrice, and the devoted father left New York in the Lusitania and came to
  London."</p>

  <p>"Where is this Wenham Gardner, then?" Tavernake demanded.</p>

  <p>Pritchard took his cigar case from his pocket and selected another
  cigar.</p>

  <p>"Say, that's where you strike the nail right on the head," he remarked.
  "Where is this Wenham Gardner?"</p>

  <p>"I don't mind telling you, Mr. Tavernake, that to discover his whereabouts
  is exactly what I am over on this side for. I have a commission from the
  family to find out, and a blank cheque to do it with."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that he has disappeared, then?" asked Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"Off the face of the earth, sir," Pritchard replied. "Something like two
  months ago, the young married couple, with Miss Beatrice, started for a
  holiday tour somewhere down in the west of England. A few days after they
  started, Miss Beatrice comes back to London alone. She goes to a
  boarding-house, is practically penniless, but she has shaken her
  sister&mdash;has, I believe, never spoken with her since. A little later,
  Elizabeth alone turns up in London. She has plenty of money, more money than
  she has ever had the control of before in her life, but no husband."</p>

  <p>"So far, I don't see anything remarkable about that," Tavernake
  interposed.</p>

  <p>"That may or may not be," Pritchard answered, drily. "This creature,
  Wenham Gardner&mdash;I hate to call him a man&mdash;was her abject
  slave&mdash;up till the time they reached London, at any rate. He would never
  have quit of his own accord. He stopped quite suddenly communicating with all
  his friends. None of their cables, even, were answered."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go and ask Mrs. Gardner where he is?" Tavernake demanded
  bluntly.</p>

  <p>"I have already," Pritchard declared, "taken that liberty. With tears in
  her eyes, she assured me that after some slight quarrel, in which she admits
  that she was the one to blame, her husband walked out of the house where they
  were staying, and she has not seen him since. She was quite ready with all
  the particulars, and even implored me to help find him."</p>

  <p>"I cannot imagine," Tavernake said, "why any one should disbelieve
  her."</p>

  <p>The detective smiled.</p>

  <p>"There are a few little outside circumstances," he remarked, looking at
  the ash of his cigar. "In the first place, how do you suppose that this young
  Wenham Gardner spent the last week of his stay in New York?"</p>

  <p>"How should I know?" Tavernake replied, impatiently.</p>

  <p>"By realizing every cent of his property on which he could lay his hands,"
  the detective continued. "It isn't at any time an easy business, and the
  Gardner interest is spread out in many directions, but he must have sailed
  with something like forty thousand pounds in hard cash. A suspicious person
  might presume that that forty thousand pounds has found its way to the
  stronger of the combination."</p>

  <p>"Anything else?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>"I won't worry you much more," the detective answered. "There are a few
  other circumstances which seem to need explanation, but they can wait. There
  is one serious one, however, and that is where you come in."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!" Tavernake remarked. "I was hoping you would come to that
  soon."</p>

  <p>"The two sisters, Beatrice and Elizabeth, have been together ever since we
  can learn anything of their history. Those people who don't understand the
  disappearance of Wenham Gardner would like to know why they quarreled and
  parted, why Beatrice is keeping away from her sister in this strange manner.
  I personally, too, should like to know from Miss Beatrice when she last saw
  Wenham Gardner alive."</p>

  <p>"You want me to ask Miss Beatrice these things?" Tavernake demanded.</p>

  <p>"It might come better from you," Pritchard admitted. "I have written her
  to the theatre but naturally she has not replied."</p>

  <p>Tavernake looked curiously at his companion.</p>

  <p>"Do you really suppose," he asked, "that, even granted there were any
  unusual circumstances in connection with that quarrel&mdash;do you seriously
  suppose that Beatrice would give her sister away?"</p>

  <p>The detective sighed.</p>

  <p>"No doubt, Mr. Tavernake," he said, "these young ladies are friends of
  yours, and perhaps for that reason you are a little prejudiced in their
  favor. Their whole bringing-up and associations, however, have certainly not
  been of a strict order. I cannot help thinking that persuasion might be
  brought to bear upon Miss Beatrice, that it might be pointed out to her that
  a true story is the safest."</p>

  <p>"Well, if you've finished," Tavernake declared, "I'd like to tell you what
  I think of your story. I think it's all d&mdash;d silly nonsense! This Wenham
  Gardner, by your own saying, was half mad. There was a quarrel and he's gone
  off to Paris or somewhere. As to your suggestions about Mrs. Gardner, I think
  they're infamous."</p>

  <p>Pritchard was unmoved by his companion's warmth.</p>

  <p>"Why, that's all right, Mr. Tavernake," he affirmed. "I can quite
  understand your feeling like that just at first. You see, I've been among
  crime and criminals all my days, and I learn to look for a certain set of
  motives when a thing of this sort happens. You've been brought up among
  honest folk, who go the straightforward way about life, and naturally you
  look at the same matter from a different point of view. But you and I have
  got to talk this out. I want you to understand that those very charming young
  ladies are not quite the class of young women whom you know anything about.
  Mind you, I haven't a word to say against Miss Beatrice. I dare say she's as
  straight as they make 'em. But&mdash;you must take another whiskey and soda,
  Mr. Tavernake. Now, I insist upon it. Tim, come right over here."</p>

  <p>Mr. Pritchard seemed to have forgotten what he was talking about. The room
  had been suddenly invaded. The whole of the little supper party, whose
  individual members he had pointed out to his companion, came trooping into
  the room. They were all apparently on the best of terms with themselves, and
  they all seemed to make a point of absolutely ignoring Pritchard's presence.
  Elizabeth was the one exception. She was carrying a tiny Chinese spaniel
  under one arm; with the fingers of her other hand she held a tortoise-shell
  mounted monocle to her eye, and stared directly at the two men. Presently she
  came languidly across the room to them.</p>

  <p>"Dear me," she said, "I had no idea that even your wide circle of
  acquaintances, Mr. Pritchard, included my friend, Mr. Tavernake."</p>

  <p>The two men rose to their feet. Tavernake felt confused and angry. It was
  as though he had been playing the traitor in listening, even for a moment, to
  these stories.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pritchard introduced himself to me only a few minutes ago," he
  declared. "He brought me in here and I have been listening to a lot of
  rubbish from him of which I don't believe a single word."</p>

  <p>She flashed a wonderful smile upon him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Pritchard is so very censorious," she murmured. "He takes such a very
  low view of human nature. After all, though, I suppose we must not blame him.
  I think that as men and women we do not exist to him. We are simply the pegs
  by means of which he can climb a little higher in the esteem of his
  employers."</p>

  <p>Pritchard took up his soft hat and stick.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Gardner," he said, "I will confess that I have been wasting my time
  with this young man. You are a trifle severe upon me. You may find, and
  before long, that I am your best friend."</p>

  <p>She laughed delightfully.</p>

  <p>"Dear Mr. Pritchard," she exclaimed, "it is a strange thought, that! If
  only I dared hope that some day it might come true!"</p>

  <p>"More unlikely things, madam, are happening every hour," the detective
  remarked. "The world&mdash;our little corner of it, at any rate&mdash;is full
  of anomalies. There might even come a time to any one of us three when
  liberty was more dangerous than the prison cell itself."</p>

  <p>He nodded carelessly to Tavernake, and with a bow to Elizabeth turned and
  left the room. Elizabeth remained as though turned to stone, looking after
  him as he descended the stairs.</p>

  <p>"The man is a fool!" Tavernake cried, roughly.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth shook her head and sighed.</p>

  <p>"He is something far more ineffective," she said. "He is just a little too
  clever."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER, XV. GENERAL DISCONTENT</h2>

  <p class="first">Elizabeth did not at once rejoin her friends. Instead, she
  sank on to the low settee close to where she had been standing, and drew
  Tavernake down to her side. She waved her hand across at the others, who were
  calling for her.</p>

  <p>"In a moment, dear people," she said.</p>

  <p>Then she leaned back among the cushions and laughed at her companion.</p>

  <p>"Tell me, Mr. Tavernake," she asked, "don't you feel that you have stepped
  into a sort of modern Arabian Nights?"</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I know Mr. Pritchard's weakness," she continued. "He loves to throw a
  glamour around everything he says or does. Because he honors me by
  interesting himself in my concerns, he has probably told you all sorts of
  wonderful things about me and my friends. A very ingenious romancer, Mr.
  Pritchard, you know. Confess, now, didn't he tell you some stories about
  us?"</p>

  <p>She might have spared herself the trouble of beating about the bush. There
  was no hesitation about Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"He said that your friends were every one of them criminals," Tavernake
  declared, "and he admitted that he was working hard at the present moment to
  discover that you were one, too."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly but heartily.</p>

  <p>"I wonder what was his object," she remarked, "in taking you into his
  confidence."</p>

  <p>"He happened to know," Tavernake explained, "that I was intimate with your
  sister. He wanted me to ask Beatrice a certain question."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth laughed no more. She looked steadfastly into his eyes.</p>

  <p>"And that question?"</p>

  <p>"He wanted me to ask Beatrice why she left you and hid herself in
  London."</p>

  <p>She tried to smile but not very successfully.</p>

  <p>"According to his story," Tavernake continued, "you and Beatrice and your
  husband were away together somewhere in the country. Something happened
  there, something which resulted in the disappearance of your husband.
  Beatrice came back alone and has not been near you since. Soon afterwards,
  you, too, came back alone. Mr. Gardner has not been seen or heard of."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was bending over her dog, but even Tavernake, unobservant though
  he was, could see that she was shaken.</p>

  <p>"Pritchard is a clever man, generally," she remarked, "diabolically
  clever. Why has he told you all this, I wonder? He must have known that you
  would probably repeat it to me. Why does he want to show me his hand?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," Tavernake replied. "These matters are all beyond me.
  They do not concern me in any way. I am not keeping you from your friends?
  Please send me away when you like."</p>

  <p>"Don't go just yet," she begged. "Sit with me for a moment. Can't you
  see," she added, whispering, "that I have had a shock? Sit with me. I can't
  go back to those others just yet."</p>

  <p>Tavernake did as he was bidden. The woman at his side was still caressing
  the little animal she carried. Watching her, however, Tavernake could see
  that her bosom was rising and falling quickly. There was an unnatural pallor
  in her cheeks, a terrified gleam in her eyes. Nevertheless, these things
  passed. In a very few seconds she was herself again.</p>

  <p>"Come," she said, "it is not often that I give way. The only time I am
  ever afraid is when there is something which I do not understand. I do not
  understand Mr. Pritchard to-night. I know that he is my enemy. I cannot
  imagine why he should talk to you. He must have known that you would repeat
  all he said. It is not like him. Tell me, Mr. Tavernake, you have heard all
  sorts of things about me. Do you believe them? Do you believe&mdash;it's
  rather a horrible thing to ask, isn't it?" she went on hurriedly,&mdash;"do
  you believe that I made away with my husband?"</p>

  <p>"You surely do not need to ask me that question," Tavernake answered,
  fervently. "I should believe your word, whatever you told me. I should not
  believe that you could do anything wrong."</p>

  <p>Her hand touched his for a moment and he was repaid.</p>

  <p>"Don't think too well of me," she begged. "I don't want to disappoint
  you."</p>

  <p>Some one pushed open the swing doors and she started nervously. It was
  only a waiter who passed through into the bar.</p>

  <p>"What I think of you," Tavernake said slowly, "nothing could alter, but
  because I am stupid, I suppose, there is quite a good deal that I cannot
  understand. I cannot understand, for instance, why they should suspect you of
  having anything to do with your husband's disappearance. You can prove where
  you were when he left you?"</p>

  <p>"Quite easily," she answered, "only, unfortunately, no one seems to have
  seen him go. He timed his departure so cunningly that he apparently vanished
  into thin air. Even then," she continued, "but for one thing I don't suppose
  that any one would have had suspicions. I dare say Mr. Pritchard told you
  that before we left New York my husband sold out some of his property and
  brought it over to Europe with him in cash. We had both determined that we
  would live abroad and have nothing more to do with America. It was not I who
  persuaded him to do this. It made no difference to me. If he had run away and
  left me, the courts would have given me money. If he had died and I had been
  a widow, he would have left me his property. But simply because there was all
  this money in our hands, and because he disappeared, his people and this man
  Pritchard suspect me."</p>

  <p>"It is wicked," he muttered.</p>

  <p>She turned slowly towards him.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she said, "do you know that you can help me very much
  indeed?"</p>

  <p>"I only wish I could," he replied. "Try me."</p>

  <p>"Can't you see," she went on, "that the great thing against me is that
  Beatrice left me suddenly when we were on that wretched expedition, and came
  back alone? She is in London, I know, quite close to me, and still she hides.
  Pritchard asks himself why. Mr. Tavernake, go and tell her what people are
  saying, go and tell her everything that has happened, let her understand that
  her keeping away is doing me a terrible injury, beg her to come and let
  people see that we are reconciled, and warn her, too, against Pritchard. Will
  you do this for me?"</p>

  <p>"Of course I will," Tavernake answered. "I will see her to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth drew a little sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"And you'll let me know what she says?" she asked, rising.</p>

  <p>"I shall be only too glad to," Tavernake assured her.</p>

  <p>"Good-night!"</p>

  <p>She looked up into his face with a smile which had turned the heads of
  hardened stagers in New York. No wonder that Tavernake felt his heart beat
  against his ribs! He took her hands and held them for a moment. Then he
  turned abruptly away.</p>

  <p>"Good-night!" he said.</p>

  <p>He disappeared through the swing doors. She strolled across the room to
  where her friends were sitting in a circle, laughing and talking. Her father,
  who had just come in and joined them, gripped her by the arm as she sat
  down.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean?" he demanded, with shaking voice. "Did you see that he
  was there with Pritchard&mdash;your young man&mdash;that wretched estate
  agent's clerk? I tell you that Pritchard was pumping him for all he was
  worth."</p>

  <p>"My dear father," she whispered, coldly, "don't be melodramatic. You give
  yourself away the whole time. Go to bed if you can't behave like a man."</p>

  <p>The lights had been turned low, there was no one else in the room. The
  little old gentleman with the eyeglass leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Have you any notion, my dear Elizabeth," he asked, "why our friend
  Pritchard is so much in evidence just at present?"</p>

  <p>"Not on account of you, Jimmy," she answered, "nor of any one else here,
  in fact. The truth is he has conceived a violent admiration for me&mdash;an
  admiration so pronounced, indeed, that he hates to let me out of his
  sight."</p>

  <p>They all laughed uproariously. Then Walter Crease, the journalist, leaned
  forward,&mdash;a man with a long, narrow face, yellow-stained fingers, and
  hollow cheekbones. He glanced around the room before he spoke, and his voice
  sounded like a hoarse whisper.</p>

  <p>"See here," he said, "seems to me Pritchard is getting mighty awkward. He
  hasn't got his posse around him in this country, anyway."</p>

  <p>There was a dead silence for several seconds. Then the little old
  gentleman nodded solemnly.</p>

  <p>"I am a trifle tired of Pritchard myself," he admitted, "and he certainly
  knows too much. He carries too much in his head to go around safely."</p>

  <p>The eyes of Elizabeth were bright.</p>

  <p>"He treats us like children," she declared. "To-night he has told the
  whole of my affairs to a perfect stranger. It is intolerable!"</p>

  <p>The little party broke up soon after. Only Walter Crease and the man
  called Jimmy Post were left talking, and they retired into the window-seat,
  whispering together.</p>

  <p>Tavernake, with his hands thrust deep in his overcoat pockets, left the
  hotel and strode along the Strand. Some fancy seized him before he had gone
  many paces, and turning abruptly to the left he descended to the Embankment.
  He made his way to the very seat upon which he had sat once before with
  Beatrice. With folded arms he leaned back in the corner, looking out across
  the river, at the curving line of lights, at the black, turgid waters, the
  slowly-moving hulk of a barge on its way down the stream. It was a new thing,
  this, for him to have to accuse himself of folly, of weakness. For the last
  few days he had moved in a mist of uncertainty, setting his heel upon all
  reflection, avoiding every issue. To-night he could escape those accusing
  thoughts no longer; to-night he was more than ever bitter with himself. What
  folly was this which had sprung up in his life&mdash;folly colossal,
  unimaginable, as unexpected as though it had fallen a thunderbolt from the
  skies! What had happened to change him so completely!</p>

  <p>His thought traveled back to the boarding-house. It was there that the
  thing had begun. Before that night upon the roof, the finger-posts which he
  had set up with such care and deliberation along the road which led towards
  his coveted goal, had seemed to him to point with unfaltering directness
  towards everything in life worthy of consideration. To-night they were only
  dreary phantasms, marking time across a miserable plain. Perhaps, after all,
  there had been something in his nature, some rebel thing, intolerable yet to
  be reckoned with, which had been first born of that fateful curiosity of his.
  It had leapt up so suddenly, sprung with such scanty notice into strenuous
  and insistent life. Yet what place had it there? He must fight against it,
  root it out with both hands. What was this world of intrigue, this criminal,
  undesirable world, to him? His common sense forbade him altogether to
  dissociate Elizabeth from her friends, from her surroundings. She was the
  secret of the pain which was tearing at his heartstrings, of all the
  excitement, the joy, the passion which had swept like a full flood across the
  level way of his life, which had set him drifting among the unknown seas. Yet
  it was Beatrice who had brought this upon him. If she had never left, if he
  had not tasted the horrors of this new loneliness, he might have been able to
  struggle on. He missed her, missed her diabolically. The other things,
  marvelous though they were, had been more or less like a mirage. This world
  of new emotions had spread like a silken mesh over all his thoughts, over all
  his desires. Beatrice had been a tangible person, restful, delightful, a real
  companion, his one resource against this madness. And now she was gone, and
  he was powerless to get her back. He turned his head, he looked up the road
  along which he had torn that night with his arms around her. She owed him her
  life and she had gone! With all a man's inconsequence, it seemed to him as he
  rose heavily to his feet and started homeward, that she had repaid him with a
  certain amount of ingratitude, that she had left him at the one moment in his
  life when he needed her most.</p>

  <h2>XVI. AN OFFER OF MARRIAGE</h2>

  <p class="first">The next afternoon, at half-past four, Tavernake was having
  tea with Beatrice in the tiny flat which she was sharing with another girl,
  off Kingsway. She opened the door to him herself, and though she chattered
  ceaselessly, it seemed to him that she was by no means at her ease. She
  installed him in the only available chair, an absurd little wicker thing many
  sizes too small for him, and seated herself upon the hearth-rug a few feet
  away.</p>

  <p>"You have soon managed to find me out, Leonard," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he answered. "I had to go to the stage doorkeeper for your
  address."</p>

  <p>"He hadn't the slightest right to give it you," she declared.</p>

  <p>Tavernake shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I had to have it," he said simply.</p>

  <p>"The power of the purse again!" she laughed. "Now that you are here, I
  don't believe that you are a bit glad to see me. Are you?"</p>

  <p>He did not answer for a moment. He was thinking of that vigil upon the
  Embankment, of the long walk home, of the battle with himself, the continual
  striving to tear from his heart this new thing, for which, with a curious and
  most masculine inconsistency, he persisted in holding her responsible.</p>

  <p>"You know, Leonard," she continued, getting up abruptly and beginning to
  make the tea, "I believe that you are angry with me. If you are, all I can
  say is that you are a very foolish person. I had to come away. Can't you see
  that?"</p>

  <p>"I cannot," he answered stolidly.</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"You are not a reasonable person," she declared. "I suppose it is because
  you have led such a queer life, and had no womenfolk to look after you. You
  don't understand. It was absurd, in a way, that I should ever have called
  myself your sister, that we should even have attempted such a ridiculous
  experiment. But after&mdash;after the other night&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Can't we forget that?" he interrupted.</p>

  <p>She raised her eyes and looked at him.</p>

  <p>"Can you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>There was a curious, almost a pleading earnestness in her tone. Her eyes
  had something new to say, something which, though it failed to stir his
  blood, made him vaguely uncomfortable. Nevertheless, he answered her without
  hesitation.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he replied, "I could forget it. I will promise to forget it."</p>

  <p>It was unaccountable, but he almost fancied that he saw this new thing
  pass from her face, leaving her pale and tremulous. She looked away again and
  busied herself with the tea-caddy, but the fingers which held the spoon were
  shaking a little.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose I could forget," she said, "but it would be very difficult
  for either of us to behave as though it had never happened. Besides, it
  really was an impossible situation, you know," she went on, looking down into
  the tea-caddy. "It is much better for me to be here with Annie. You can come
  and see me now and then and we can still be very good friends."</p>

  <p>Tavernake was annoyed. He said nothing, and Beatrice, glancing up, laughed
  at his gloomy expression.</p>

  <p>"You certainly are," she declared, "the most impossible, the most
  primitive person I ever met. London isn't Arcadia, you know, and you are not
  my brother. Besides, you were such an autocrat. You didn't even like my going
  out to supper with Mr. Grier."</p>

  <p>"I hate the fellow!" Tavernake admitted. "Are you seeing much of him?"</p>

  <p>"He took us all out to supper last night," she replied. "I thought it was
  very kind of him to ask me."</p>

  <p>"Kind, indeed! Does he want to marry you?" Tavernake demanded.</p>

  <p>She set down the teapot and again she laughed softly. In her plain black
  gown, very simple, adorned only by the little white bow at her neck,
  quakerlike and spotless, with the added color in her cheeks, too, which
  seemed to have come there during the last few moments, she was a very
  alluring person.</p>

  <p>"He can't," she declared. "He is married already."</p>

  <p>Then there came to Tavernake an inspiration, an inspiration so wonderful
  that he gripped the sides of his chair and sat up. Here, after all, was the
  way out for him, the way out from his garden of madness, the way to escape
  from that mysterious, paralyzing yoke whose burden was already heavy upon his
  shoulders. In that swift, vivid moment he saw something of the truth. He saw
  himself losing all his virility, the tool and plaything of this woman who had
  bewitched him, a poor, fond creature living only for the kind words and
  glances she might throw him at her pleasure. In those few seconds he knew the
  true from the false. Without hesitation, he gripped with all the colossal
  selfishness of his unthinking sex at the rope which was thrown to him.</p>

  <p>"Well, then, I do," he said firmly. "Will you marry me, Beatrice?"</p>

  <p>She threw her head back and laughed, laughed long and softly, and
  Tavernake, simple and unversed in the ways of women, believed that she was
  indeed amused.</p>

  <p>"Neither you nor any one else, dear Leonard!" she exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"But I want you to," he persisted. "I think that you will."</p>

  <p>There was coquetry now in the tantalizing look she flashed him.</p>

  <p>"Am I, too, then, one of these things to be attained in your life?" she
  asked. "Dear Leonard, you mustn't say it like that. I don't like the look of
  your jaw. It frightens me."</p>

  <p>"There is nothing to be afraid of in marrying me," he answered. "I should
  make you a very good husband. Some day you would be rich, very rich indeed. I
  am quite sure that I shall succeed, if not at once, very soon. There is
  plenty of money to be made in the world if one perseveres."</p>

  <p>She had the air of trying to take him seriously.</p>

  <p>"You sound quite convincing," she admitted, "but I do wish that you would
  put all these thoughts out of your mind, Leonard. It doesn't sound like you
  in the least. Remember what you told me that first night; you assured me that
  women had not the slightest part in your life."</p>

  <p>"I have changed," he confessed. "I did not expect anything of the sort to
  happen, but it has. It would be foolish of me to deny it. I have been all my
  life learning, Beatrice," he continued, with a sudden curious softness in his
  tone, "and yet, somehow or other, it seems to me that I never knew anything
  at all until lately. There was no one to direct me, no one to show me just
  what is worth while in life. You have taught me a great deal, you have taught
  me how little I know. And there are things," he went on, solemnly, "of which
  I am afraid, things which I do not begin even to understand. Can't you see
  how it is with me? I am really very ignorant. I want some one who
  understands; I want you, Beatrice, very badly."</p>

  <p>She patted the back of his hand caressingly.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't talk like that, Leonard," she said. "I shouldn't make you a
  good wife. I am not going to marry any one."</p>

  <p>"And why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"That is my secret," she told him, looking into the fire.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that, you will never marry?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I suppose I shall change, like other women," she answered. "Just at
  present, I feel like that."</p>

  <p>"Is it because your sister's marriage&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She caught hold of both his hands; her eyes were suddenly full of
  terror.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't talk about Elizabeth," she begged, "you please mustn't talk
  about her. Promise that you won't."</p>

  <p>"But I came here to talk about her," he replied.</p>

  <p>Beatrice, for a moment, said nothing. Then she threw down his hands and
  laughed once more. As she flung herself back in her place, it seemed to
  Tavernake that he saw once more the girl who had stood upon the roof of the
  boarding-house.</p>

  <p>"You came to talk about Elizabeth!" she exclaimed. "I forgot. Well, go on,
  what is it?"</p>

  <p>"Your sister is in trouble!"</p>

  <p>"Are you her confidant?" Beatrice asked.</p>

  <p>"I am not exactly that," he admitted, "but she has asked me to come and
  see you."</p>

  <p>Beatrice had suddenly grown hard, her lips were set together, even her
  attitude was uncompromising.</p>

  <p>"Say exactly what you have to say," she told him. "I will not
  interrupt."</p>

  <p>"It sounds foolish," Tavernake declared, "because I know so little, but it
  seems that your sister is being annoyed by a man named Pritchard, an American
  detective. She tells me that he suspects her of being concerned in some way
  with the disappearance of her husband. One of his reasons is that you left
  her abruptly and went into hiding, that you will not see or speak to her. She
  wishes you to be reconciled."</p>

  <p>"Is that all?" Beatrice asked.</p>

  <p>"It is all," he replied, "so long as you understand its significance. If
  you go to see your sister, or let her come to see you, this man Pritchard
  will have one of his causes for suspicion removed."</p>

  <p>"So you came as Elizabeth's ambassador," Beatrice said, half as though to
  herself. "Well, here is my answer. I will not go to Elizabeth. If she finds
  out my whereabouts and comes here, then I shall go away again and hide. I
  shall never willingly exchange another word with her as long as I live."</p>

  <p>Tavernake looked at her doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"But she is your sister!" he explained.</p>

  <p>"She is my sister," Beatrice repeated, "and yet what I have said to you I
  mean."</p>

  <p>There was a short silence. Tavernake felt unaccountably ill at ease.
  Something had sprung up between them which he did not understand. He was
  swift to recognize, however, the note of absolute finality in her tone.</p>

  <p>"I have given my message," he declared. "I shall tell her what you say.
  Perhaps I had better go now."</p>

  <p>He half rose to his feet. Suddenly she lost control of herself.</p>

  <p>"Leonard, Leonard," she cried, "don't you see that you are being very
  foolish indeed? You have been good to me. Let me try and repay it a little.
  Elizabeth is my sister, but listen! What I say to you now I say in deadly
  earnest. Elizabeth has no heart, she has no thought for other people, she
  makes use of them and they count for no more to her than the figures that
  pass through one's dreams. She has some sort of hateful gift," Beatrice
  continued, and her voice shook and her eyes flashed, "some hateful gift of
  attracting people to her and making them do her bidding, of spoiling their
  lives and throwing them away when they have ceased to be useful. Leonard, you
  must not let her do this with you."</p>

  <p>He rose to his feet awkwardly. Very likely it was all true, and yet, what
  difference did it make?</p>

  <p>"Thank you," he said.</p>

  <p>They stood, for a moment, hand in hand. Then they heard the sound of a key
  in the lock.</p>

  <p>"Here's Annie coming back!" Beatrice exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Tavernake was introduced to Miss Annie Legarde, who thought he was a very
  strange person indeed because he did not fit in with any of the types of men,
  young or old, of whom she knew anything. And as for Tavernake, he considered
  that Miss Annie Legarde would have looked at least as well in a hat half the
  size, and much better without the powder upon her face. Her clothes were
  obviously more expensive than Beatrice's, but they were put on with less care
  and taste.</p>

  <p>Beatrice came out on to the landing with him.</p>

  <p>"So you won't marry me, Beatrice?" he said, as she held out her hand.</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment and then turned away with a faint sob,
  without even a word of farewell. He watched her disappear and heard the door
  shut. Slowly he began to descend the stone steps. There was something to him
  a little fateful about the closed door above, the long yet easy descent into
  the street.</p>

  <h2>XVII. THE BALCONY AT IMANO'S</h2>

  <p class="first">At six o'clock that evening, Tavernake rang up the Milan
  Court and inquired for Elizabeth. There was a moment or two's delay and then
  he heard her reply. Even over the telephone wires, even though he stood,
  cramped and uncomfortable, in that stuffy little telephone booth, he felt the
  quick start of pleasure, the thrill of something different in life, which
  came to him always at the sound of her voice, at the slightest suggestion of
  her presence.</p>

  <p>"Well, my friend, what fortune?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>"None," he answered. "I have done my best. Beatrice will not listen to
  me."</p>

  <p>"She will not come and see me?"</p>

  <p>"She will not."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was silent for a moment. When she spoke again, there was a
  change in her tone.</p>

  <p>"You have failed, then."</p>

  <p>"I did everything that could be done," Tavernake insisted eagerly. "I am
  quite sure that nothing anybody could say would move Beatrice. She is very
  decided indeed."</p>

  <p>"I have another idea," Elizabeth remarked, after a brief pause. "She will
  not come to me; very well, I must go to her. You must take me there."</p>

  <p>"I cannot do that," Tavernake answered.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>"Beatrice has refused absolutely to permit me to tell you or any one else
  of her whereabouts," he declared. "Without her permission I cannot do
  it."</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he answered uncomfortably.</p>

  <p>There was another silence. When she spoke again, her voice had changed for
  the second time. Tavernake felt his heart sink as he listened.</p>

  <p>"Very well," she said. "I thought that you were my friend, that you wished
  to help me."</p>

  <p>"I do," he replied, "but you would not have me break my word?"</p>

  <p>"You are breaking your word with me," she told him.</p>

  <p>"It is a different thing," he insisted.</p>

  <p>"You will not take me there?" she said once more.</p>

  <p>"I cannot," Tavernake answered.</p>

  <p>"Very well, good-bye!"</p>

  <p>"Don't go," he begged. "Can't I see you somewhere for a few minutes this
  evening?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid not," Elizabeth replied coolly.</p>

  <p>"Are you going out?" he persisted.</p>

  <p>"I am going to the Duke of York's Theatre with some friends," she
  answered. "I am sorry. You have disappointed me."</p>

  <p>She rang off and he turned away from the telephone booth into the street.
  It seemed to him, as he walked down the crowded thoroughfare, that some
  reflection of his own self-contempt was visible in the countenances of the
  men and women who were hurrying past him. Wherever he looked, he was acutely
  conscious of it. In his heart he felt the bitter sense of shame of a man who
  wilfully succumbs to weakness. Yet that night he made his efforts.</p>

  <p>For four hours he sat in his lonely rooms and worked. Then the unequal
  struggle was ended. With a groan he caught up his hat and coat and left the
  house. Half an hour later, he was among the little crowd of loiterers and
  footmen standing outside the doors of the Duke of York's Theatre.</p>

  <p>It was still some time before the termination of the performance. As the
  slow minutes dragged by, he grew to hate himself, to hate this new thing in
  his life which had torn down his everyday standards, which had carried him
  off his feet in this strange and detestable fashion. It was a dormant sense,
  without a doubt, which Elizabeth had stirred into life&mdash;the sense of
  sex, quiescent in him so long, chiefly through his perfect physical sanity;
  perhaps, too, in some measure, from his half-starved imagination. It was
  significant, though, that once aroused it burned with surprising and
  unwavering fidelity. The whole world of women now were different creatures to
  him, but they left him as utterly unmoved as in his unawakened days. It was
  Elizabeth only he wanted, craved for fiercely, with all this late-born
  passion of mingled sentiment and desire. He felt himself, as he hung round
  there upon the pavement, rubbing shoulders with the liveried servants, the
  loafers, and the passers-by, a thing to be despised. He was like a whipped
  dog fawning back to his master. Yet if only he could persuade her to come
  with him, if it were but for an hour! If only she would sit opposite him in
  that wonderful little restaurant, where the lights and the music, the
  laughter and the wine, were all outward symbols of this new life from before
  which her fingers seemed to have torn aside the curtains! His heart beat with
  a fierce impatience. He watched the thin stream of people who left before the
  play was over, suburbanites mostly, in a hurry for their trains. Very soon
  the whole audience followed, commissionaires were busy with their whistles,
  the servants eagerly looking right and left for their masters. And then
  Elizabeth! She came out in the midst of half-a-dozen others, brilliant in a
  wonderful cloak and dress of turquoise blue, laughing with her friends, to
  all appearance the gayest of the party. Tavernake stepped quickly forward,
  but at that moment there was a crush and he could not advance. She passed
  within a yard of him, escorted by a couple of men, and for a moment their
  eyes met. She raised her eyebrows, as though in surprise, and her recognition
  was of the slightest. She passed on and entered a waiting motorcar,
  accompanied by the two men. Tavernake stood and looked after it. She did not
  even glance round. Except for that little gesture of cold surprise, she had
  ignored him. Tavernake, scarcely knowing what he did, turned slowly towards
  the Strand.</p>

  <p>He was face to face now with a crisis before which he seemed powerless.
  Men were there in the world to be bullied, cajoled, or swept out of the way.
  What did one do with a woman who was kind one moment and insolent the next,
  who raised her eyebrows and passed on when he wanted her, when he was there
  longing for her? Those old solid dreams of his&mdash;wealth, power, his name
  on great prospectuses, a position in the world&mdash;these things now
  appeared like the day fancies of a child. He had seen his way towards them.
  Already he had felt his feet upon the rungs of the ladder which leads to
  material success. This was something different, something greater. Then a
  sense of despair chilled his heart. He felt how ignorant, how helpless he
  was. He had not even studied the first text-book of life. Those very
  qualities which had served him so well before were hopeless here.
  Persistence, Beatrice had told him once, only annoys a woman.</p>

  <p>He came to a standstill outside the entrance to the Milan Court, and
  retraced his steps. The thought of Beatrice had brought something soothing
  with it. He felt that he must see her, see her at once. He walked back along
  the Strand and entered the restaurant where Beatrice and he had had their
  memorable supper. From the vestibule he could just see Grier's back as he
  stood talking to a waiter by the side of a round table in the middle of the
  room. Tavernake slowly withdrew and made his way upstairs. There were one or
  two little tables there in the balcony, hidden from the lower part of the
  room. He seated himself at one, handing his coat and hat mechanically to the
  waiter who came hurrying up.</p>

  <p>"But, Monsieur," the man explained, with a deprecating gesture, "these
  tables are all taken."</p>

  <p>Tavernake, who kept an account book in which he registered even his car
  fares, put five shillings in the man's hand.</p>

  <p>"This one I will have," he said, firmly, and sat down.</p>

  <p>The man looked at him and turned aside to speak to the head waiter. They
  conversed together in whispers. Tavernake took no notice. His jaw was set.
  Himself unseen, he was gazing steadfastly at that table below. The head
  waiter shrugged his shoulders and departed; his other clients must be
  mollified. There was a finality which was unanswerable about Tavernake's
  methods.</p>

  <p>Tavernake ate and drank what they brought to him, ate and drank and
  suffered. Everything was as it had been that other night&mdash;the popping of
  corks, the soft music, the laughter of women, the pleasant, luxurious sense
  of warmth and gayety pervading the whole place.</p>

  <p>It was all just the same, but this time he sat outside and looked on.
  Beatrice was seated next Grier, and on her other side was a young man of the
  type which Tavernake detested, partly because it inspired him with a
  reluctant but insistent sense of inferiority. The young man was handsome,
  tall, and thin. His evening clothes fitted him perfectly, his studs and links
  were of the latest mode, his white tie arranged as though by the fingers of
  an artist. And yet he was no tailor's model. A gentleman, beyond a doubt,
  Tavernake decided, watching grudgingly the courteous movement of his head,
  listening sometimes to his well-bred but rather languid voice. Beatrice
  laughed often into his face. She admired him, of course. How could she help
  it! Grier sat at her other side. He, too, talked to her whenever he had the
  chance. It was a new fever which Tavernake was tasting, a new fever burning
  in his blood. He was jealous; he hated the whole party below. In imagination
  he saw Elizabeth with her friends, supping most likely in that other, more
  resplendent restaurant, only a few yards away. He imagined her the centre of
  every attention. Without a doubt, she was looking at her neighbor as she had
  looked at him. Tavernake bit his lip, frowning. If he had had it in his
  power, in those black moments, to have thrown a thunderbolt from his place,
  he would have wrecked every table in the room, he would have watched with joy
  the white, startled faces of the revelers as they fled away into the night.
  It was a new torture, indescribable, bitter. Indeed, this curiosity of his,
  of which he had spoken to Beatrice as they had walked together down Oxford
  Street on that first evening, was being satisfied with a vengeance! He was
  learning of those other things of life. He had sipped at the sweetness; he
  was drinking the bitters!</p>

  <p>An altercation by his side distracted him. Again there was the head waiter
  and a protesting guest. Tavernake looked up and recognized Professor
  Franklin. With his broad-brimmed hat in his hand, the professor, in fluent
  phraseology and a strong American accent, was making himself decidedly
  disagreeable.</p>

  <p>"You had better send for your manager right away, young man," he declared.
  "On Tuesday night he brought me here himself and I engaged this table for the
  week. No, I tell you I won't have any other! I guess my order was good
  enough. You send for Luigi right here. You know who I am? Professor
  Franklin's my name, from New York, and if I say I mean to have a thing, I
  expect to get it."</p>

  <p>For the first time he recognized Tavernake, and paused for a moment in his
  speech.</p>

  <p>"Have I got your table, Professor?" Tavernake asked, slowly.</p>

  <p>"You have, sir," the professor answered. "I did not recognize you when I
  came in or I would have addressed you personally. I have particular reasons
  for occupying a front table here every night this week."</p>

  <p>The thoughts began to crowd in upon Tavernake's brain. He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Why not sit down with me?" he suggested.</p>

  <p>The professor acquiesced without a word. The head waiter, with a sigh of
  relief, took his hat and overcoat and accepted his order. Tavernake leaned
  across the table.</p>

  <p>"Professor," he said, "why do you insist upon sitting up here?"</p>

  <p>The professor moved his head slowly downwards.</p>

  <p>"My young friend, I speak to you in confidence?"</p>

  <p>"In confidence," Tavernake repeated.</p>

  <p>"I come here secretly," the professor continued, "because it is the only
  chance I have of seeing a very dear relative of mine. I am obliged to keep
  away from her just now, but from here I can watch, I can see that she is
  well."</p>

  <p>"You mean your daughter Beatrice," Tavernake said, calmly.</p>

  <p>The professor trembled all over.</p>

  <p>"You know!" he muttered.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I know," Tavernake answered. "I have been able to be of some slight
  assistance to your daughter Beatrice."</p>

  <p>The professor grasped his hand.</p>

  <p>"Yes, yes," he said, "Elizabeth is very angry with you because you will
  not tell her where to find the little girl. You are right, Mr. Tavernake. You
  must never tell her."</p>

  <p>"I don't intend it," Tavernake declared.</p>

  <p>"Say, this is a great evening for me!" the professor went on, eagerly. "I
  found out by accident myself. I was at the bar and I saw her come in with a
  lot of others."</p>

  <p>"Why don't you go and speak to her?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>The professor shivered.</p>

  <p>"There has been a disagreement," he explained. "Beatrice and Elizabeth
  have quarreled. Mind you, Beatrice was right."</p>

  <p>"Then why don't you go to her instead of staying with Elizabeth?"
  Tavernake demanded, bluntly.</p>

  <p>The professor temporarily collapsed. He drank heavily of the whiskey and
  soda by his side, and answered gloomily.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "Beatrice, when she left us, was penniless.
  Mind you, Elizabeth is the one with brains. It is Elizabeth who has the
  money. She has a strong will, too. She keeps me there whether I will or not,
  she makes me do many things&mdash;many things, surely&mdash;which I hate. But
  Elizabeth has her way. If I had gone with Beatrice, if I were to go to her
  now, I should be only a burden upon her."</p>

  <p>"You have no money, then?" Tavernake remarked.</p>

  <p>The professor shook his head sadly.</p>

  <p>"Speculations, my young friend," he replied, "speculations undertaken
  solely with the object of making a fortune for my children. I have had money
  and lost it."</p>

  <p>"Can't you earn any?" Tavernake asked. "Beatrice doesn't seem
  extravagant."</p>

  <p>The professor regarded this outspoken young man with an air of hurt
  dignity.</p>

  <p>"If you will forgive me," he said. "I think that we will choose another
  subject of conversation."</p>

  <p>"At any rate," Tavernake declared, "you must be fond of your daughter or
  you would not come here night after night just to look at her."</p>

  <p>The professor shook out a handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed his
  eyes.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice was always my favorite," he announced solemnly, "but
  Elizabeth&mdash;well, you can't get away from Elizabeth," he added, leaning
  across the table. "To tell you the truth, Mr. Tavernake, Elizabeth terrifies
  me sometimes, she is so bold. I am afraid where her scheming may land us. I
  would be happier with Beatrice if only she had the means to satisfy my
  trifling wants."</p>

  <p>He turned to the waiter and ordered a pint of champagne.</p>

  <p>"Veuve Clicquot '99," he instructed the man. "At my age," he remarked,
  with a sigh, "one has to be careful about these little matters. The wrong
  brand of champagne means a sleepless night."</p>

  <p>Tavernake looked at him in a puzzled way. The professor was a riddle to
  him. He represented no type which had come within the orbit of his
  experience. With the arrival of the champagne, the professor became almost
  eloquent. He leaned forward, gazing stealthily down at the round table.</p>

  <p>"If I could tell you of that girl's mother, Mr. Tavernake," he said, "if I
  could tell you what her history, our history, has been, it would seem to you
  so strange that you would probably regard me as a romancer. No, we have to
  carry our secrets with us."</p>

  <p>"By-the-bye," Tavernake asked, "what are you a professor of?"</p>

  <p>"Of the hidden sciences, sir," was the immediate reply. "Phrenology was my
  earliest love. Since then I have studied in the East; I have spent many years
  in a monastery in China. I have gratified in every way my natural love of the
  occult. I represent today those people of advanced thought who have traveled,
  even in spirit, for ever such a little distance across the line which divides
  the Seen from the Unseen, the Known from the Infinite."</p>

  <p>He took a long draught of champagne. Tavernake gazed at him in blank
  amazement.</p>

  <p>"I don't know much about science," he said. "It is only lately that I have
  begun to realize how ignorant I really am. Your daughter has helped to teach
  me."</p>

  <p>The professor sighed heavily.</p>

  <p>"A young woman of attainments, sir," he remarked, "of character, too. Look
  at the way she carries her head. That was a trick of her mother's."</p>

  <p>"Don't you mean to speak to her at all, then?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>"I dare not," the professor replied. "I am naturally of a truthful
  disposition, and if Elizabeth were to ask me if I had spoken to her sister, I
  should give myself away at once. No, I look on and that is all."</p>

  <p>Tavernake drummed with his fingers upon the tablecloth. Something in the
  merriment of that little party downstairs had filled him with a very bitter
  feeling.</p>

  <p>"You ought to go and claim her, professor," he declared. "Look down at
  them now. Is that the best life for a girl? The men are almost strangers to
  her, and the girls are not fit for her to associate with. She has no friends,
  no relatives. Your daughter Elizabeth can do without you very well. She is
  strong enough to take care of herself."</p>

  <p>"But my dear sir," the professor objected, "Beatrice could not support
  me."</p>

  <p>Tavernake paid his bill without another word. Downstairs the lights had
  been lowered, the party at the round table were already upon their feet.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, professor!" he said. "I am going to see the last of Beatrice
  from the top of the stairs."</p>

  <p>The professor followed him&mdash;they stood there and watched her depart
  with Annie Legarde. The two girls got into a taxicab together, and Tavernake
  breathed a sigh of relief, a relief for which he was wholly unable to
  account, when he saw that Grier made no effort to follow them. As soon as the
  taxi had rolled away, they descended and passed into the street. Then the
  professor suddenly changed his tone.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," he said, "I know what you are thinking about me: I am a
  weak old man who drinks too much and who wasn't born altogether honest. I
  can't give up anything. I'd be happier, really happier, on a crust with
  Beatrice, but I daren't, I simply daren't try it. I prefer the flesh pots
  with Elizabeth, and you despise me for it. I don't blame you, Mr. Tavernake,
  but listen."</p>

  <p>"Well?" Tavernake interjected.</p>

  <p>The professor's fingers gripped his arm.</p>

  <p>"You've known Beatrice longer&mdash;you don't know Elizabeth very well,
  but let me tell you this. Elizabeth is a very wonderful person. I know
  something about character, I know something about those hidden powers which
  men and women possess&mdash;strange powers which no one can understand,
  powers which drag a man to a woman's feet, or which make him shiver when he
  passes another even in a crowd. You see, these things are a science with me,
  Mr. Tavernake, but I don't pretend to understand everything. All I know is
  that Elizabeth is one of those people who can just do what she likes with
  men. I am her father and I am her slave. I tell myself that I would rather be
  with Beatrice, and I am as powerless to go as though I were bound with
  chains. You are a young ignorant man, Mr. Tavernake, you know nothing of
  life, and I will give you a word of warning. It is better for you that you
  keep away from over there."</p>

  <p>He raised one hand and pointed across the street towards the Milan Court;
  with the other he once more gripped Tavernake's arm.</p>

  <p>"Why she should take the trouble even to speak with you for a moment, I do
  not know," the professor continued, "but she does. It has pleased her to talk
  with you&mdash;why I can't imagine&mdash;only if I were you I would get away
  while there is yet time. She is my daughter but she has no heart, no pity. I
  saw her smile at you. I am sorry always for the man she smiles upon like
  that. Goodnight, Mr. Tavernake!"</p>

  <p>The professor crossed the street. Tavernake watched him until he was out
  of sight. Then he felt an arm thrust through his.</p>

  <p>"Why, this is what I call luck!" a familiar voice exclaimed. "Mr.
  Tavernake, you're the very man I was looking for!"</p>

  <br>

  <h2>XVIII. A MIDNIGHT ADVENTURE</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake was not sociably inclined and took no pains to
  conceal the fact. Mr. Pritchard, however, was not easily to be shaken
  off.</p>

  <p>"So you've been palling up to the old man, eh?" he remarked, in friendly
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"I came across the professor unexpectedly," Tavernake answered, coldly.
  "What do you want with me, please? I am on my way home."</p>

  <p>Pritchard laughed softly to himself.</p>

  <p>"Say, there's something about you Britishers I can't help admiring!" he
  declared. "You are downright, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you think we are too clumsy to be anything else," Tavernake
  replied. "This is my 'bus coming. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>Pritchard's hand, however, tightened upon his companion's arm.</p>

  <p>"Look here, young man," he said, "don't you be foolish. I'm a valuable
  acquaintance for you, if you only realized it. Come along across the street
  with me. My club is on the Terrace, just below. Stroll along there with me
  and I'll tell you something about the professor, if you like."</p>

  <p>"Thank you," Tavernake answered, "I don't think I care about hearing
  gossip. Besides, I think I know all there is to be known about him."</p>

  <p>"Did you give Miss Beatrice my message?" Pritchard asked suddenly.</p>

  <p>"If I did," Tavernake replied, "I have no answer for you."</p>

  <p>"Will you tell her this," Pritchard began,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"No, I will tell her nothing!" Tavernake interrupted. "You can look after
  your own affairs. I have no interest in them and I don't want to have.
  Good-night!"</p>

  <p>Pritchard laughed again but he did not relax his grasp upon the other's
  arm.</p>

  <p>"Now, Mr. Tavernake," he said, "it won't do for you to quarrel with me. I
  shouldn't be surprised if you discovered that I am one of the most useful
  acquaintances you ever met in your life. You needn't come into the club
  unless you like, but walk as far as there with me. When we get on to the
  Terrace, with closed houses on one side and a palisade upon the other, I am
  going to say something to you."</p>

  <p>"Very well," Tavernake decided, reluctantly. "I don't know what there is
  you can have to tell me, but I'll come as far as there, at any rate."</p>

  <p>They crossed the Strand and turned into Adam Street. As they neared the
  further corner, Pritchard stepped from the pavement into the middle of the
  street, and looked searchingly around.</p>

  <p>"Say, you'll excuse my being a little careful," he remarked. "This is
  rather a lonely part for the middle of London, and I have been followed for
  the last two days by people whose company I am not over keen about."</p>

  <p>"Followed? What for?" Tavernake demanded.</p>

  <p>"Oh, the usual thing!" answered the detective, with a shrug of the
  shoulders. "That company of crooks I showed you last night don't fancy having
  me around. They've a good many grudges up against Sam Pritchard. I am not
  quite so safe over here as I should be in New York. Most of them are off to
  Paris tomorrow, thank Heavens!"</p>

  <p>"And you?" Tavernake asked. "Are you going, too?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard shook his head.</p>

  <p>"If only those fools would believe it, I'm not over here on their business
  at all. I came over on a special commission this time, as you know. I have a
  word of warning for you, Mr. Tavernake. I guess you won't like to hear it,
  but you've got to."</p>

  <p>Tavernake stopped short.</p>

  <p>"I don't want your warnings!" he said angrily. "I don't want you
  interfering in my affairs!"</p>

  <p>The detective smiled quietly. Then a new expression suddenly tightened his
  lips.</p>

  <p>"Never mind about that just now!" he exclaimed. "See here, take this
  police whistle from my left hand, quick, and blow it for all that you are
  worth!"</p>

  <p>It was characteristic of Tavernake that he was prepared to obey without a
  second's hesitation. The opportunity, however, was denied him. The events
  which followed came and passed like a thought. A blow on his left wrist and
  the whistle fell into the road. A dark figure had sprung up, apparently from
  space; a long arm was twined around Pritchard's neck, bending him backwards;
  there was a gleam of steel within a few inches of his throat. And then
  Tavernake saw a wonderful thing. With a turn of his wrist, Pritchard suddenly
  seemed to lift the form of his assailant into the air. Tavernake caught a
  swift impression of a man's white face, the head pointing to the street, the
  legs twitching convulsively. Head over heels Pritchard seemed to throw him,
  while the knife clattered harmlessly into the roadway. The man lay crumpled
  up and moaning before the door of one of the houses. Pritchard sprang after
  him. The door had been cautiously opened and the man crawled through;
  Pritchard followed; then the door closed and Tavernake beat upon it in
  vain.</p>

  <p>For several seconds&mdash;it seemed to Tavernake much longer&mdash;he
  stood gazing at the door, breathing heavily, absolutely unable to collect his
  thoughts. The whole affair had happened with such amazing celerity! He could
  not bring himself to realize it, to believe that it was Pritchard who had
  been with him only a few seconds ago, who in danger of his life had performed
  that marvelous trick of jiu-jutsu, had followed his unknown assailant into
  that dark, mysterious house, from no single window of which was a single
  gleam of light visible. Tavernake had led an uneventful life. Of the passions
  which breed murder and the desire to kill he knew nothing. He was dazed with
  the suddenness of it all. How could such a thing happen in the midst of
  London, in a thoroughfare only momentarily deserted, at the further end of
  which, indeed, were many signs of life! Then the thought of that knife made
  him shiver&mdash;blue glittering steel cutting the air like whipcord. He
  remembered the look in the assassin's face&mdash;horrible, an epitome of the
  passions, which seemed to reveal to him in that moment the existence of some
  other, some unknown world, about which he had neither read nor dreamed.</p>

  <p>The sound of footsteps came as an immense relief. A man came round the
  corner, smoking a cigarette and humming softly to himself. The presence of
  another human being seemed suddenly to bring Tavernake's feet back upon the
  earth. He moved toward the pavement and addressed the newcomer.</p>

  <p>"Can you tell me how to get inside that house?" he asked quickly.</p>

  <p>The man removed the cigarette from his mouth and stared at his
  questioner.</p>

  <p>"I should ring the bell," he replied, "but surely it's unoccupied? What do
  you want to get in there for?"</p>

  <p>"Less than a minute ago," Tavernake told him, "I was walking here with a
  friend. A man came up behind us and tried deliberately to stab him. He bolted
  afterwards through that door, my friend followed him, the door was closed in
  my face."</p>

  <p>The newcomer was a youngish man, a musician, who had just come from a
  concert and was on his way to the club at the end of the street. Probably,
  had he been a journalist, his curiosity would have been greater than his
  incredulity. As it was, however, he gazed at Tavernake, for a moment,
  blankly.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "this doesn't sound a very likely story of yours,
  you know."</p>

  <p>"I don't care whether it's likely or not," Tavernake answered hotly; "it's
  true! The knife's somewhere in the road there&mdash;it fell up against the
  railings."</p>

  <p>They crossed the road together and searched. There were no signs of the
  weapon. Tavernake peered over the railings.</p>

  <p>"When my friend struck the other man and twisted him over," he explained,
  "the knife seemed to fly up into the air; it might even have reached the
  gardens."</p>

  <p>His companion turned slowly away.</p>

  <p>"Well, it's no use looking down there for it," he remarked. "We might try
  the door, if you like."</p>

  <p>They leaned their weight against it, hammered at the panels, and waited.
  The door was fast closed and no reply came. The musician shrugged his
  shoulders and prepared to depart, after one more glance at Tavernake, half
  suspicious, half questioning.</p>

  <p>"If you think it worth while," he said, "you had better fetch the police,
  perhaps. If you take my advice, though, I think I should go home and forget
  all about it."</p>

  <p>He passed on, leaving Tavernake speechless. The idea that people might not
  believe his story had never seriously occurred to him. Yet all of a sudden he
  began to doubt it himself. He stepped back into the road and looked up at the
  windows of the house&mdash;dark, uncurtained, revealing no sign of life or
  habitation. Had he really taken that walk with Pritchard, stood on this spot
  with him only a minute or two ago? Then he picked up the police whistle and
  he had no longer any doubts. The whole scene was before him again, more
  vividly than ever. Even at this moment, Pritchard might be in need of
  help!</p>

  <p>He turned and walked sharply to the corner of the Terrace, finding himself
  almost immediately face to face with a policeman.</p>

  <p>"You must come into this house with me at once!" Tavernake exclaimed,
  pointing backwards. "A friend of mine was attacked here just now; a man tried
  to stab him. They are both in that house. The man ran away and my friend
  followed him. The door is closed and no one answers."</p>

  <p>The constable looked at Tavernake very much as the musician had done.</p>

  <p>"Do either of them live there, sir?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"How should I know!" Tavernake answered. "The man sprang upon my friend
  from behind. He had a knife in his hand&mdash;I saw it. My friend threw him
  over and he escaped into that house. They are both there now.</p>

  <p>"Which house is it, sir?" the policeman inquired.</p>

  <p>They were standing almost in front of it. The gate was open and Tavernake
  beat against the panels with the flat of his hand. Then, with a cry of
  triumph, he stooped down and picked something up from a crack in the flagged
  stones.</p>

  <p>"The key!" he cried. "Come on, quick!"</p>

  <p>He thrust it into the lock and turned it; the door swung smoothly open.
  The policeman laid his hand upon Tavernake's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "let's have that story of yours again, a little more
  clearly. Who is it that's in this house?"</p>

  <p>"Five minutes ago," Tavernake began, speaking rapidly, "I met a man in the
  Strand whom I know slightly&mdash;Pritchard, an American detective. He said
  that he had something to say to me and he asked me to walk round with him to
  a club in this Terrace. We were in the middle of the road there, talking,
  when a man sprang at him; he must have come up behind quite noiselessly. The
  man had a knife in his hand. My friend threw him head over heels&mdash;it was
  some trick of jiu-jutsu; I have seen it done at the Polytechnic. He fell in
  front of this door which must either have been ajar or else some one who was
  waiting must have let him in. He crawled through and my friend followed him.
  The door was slammed in my face."</p>

  <p>"How long ago was this?" the policeman asked.</p>

  <p>"Not much more than five minutes," Tavernake answered.</p>

  <p>The policeman coughed.</p>

  <p>"It's a very queer story, sir."</p>

  <p>"It's true!" Tavernake declared, fiercely. "You and I have got to search
  this house."</p>

  <p>The policeman nodded.</p>

  <p>"There's no harm in that, sir, anyway."</p>

  <p>He flashed his lantern around the hall&mdash;unfurnished, with paper
  hanging from the walls. Then they began to enter the rooms, one by one.
  Nowhere was there any sign of occupation. From floor to floor they passed, in
  grim silence. In the front chamber of the attic was a camp bedstead, two or
  three humble articles of furniture, and a small stove.</p>

  <p>"Caretaker's kit," the policeman muttered. "Nothing seems to have been
  used for some time."</p>

  <p>They descended the stairs again.</p>

  <p>"You say you saw the two men enter this house, sir?" the policeman
  remarked doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"I did," Tavernake declared. "There is no doubt about it."</p>

  <p>"The back entrances are all properly locked," the policeman pointed out.
  "None of the windows by which any one could escape have been opened. We've
  been into every room. There's no one in the house now, sir, is there?"</p>

  <p>"There doesn't seem to be," Tavernake admitted.</p>

  <p>The policeman looked him over once more; Tavernake certainly had not the
  appearance of one attempting a hoax.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid there is nothing more we can do, sir," the man said civilly.
  "You had better give me your name and address."</p>

  <p>"Can't we go over the place once more?" Tavernake suggested. "I tell you I
  saw them come in."</p>

  <p>"I have my beat outside to look after, sir," the constable answered. "If
  it wasn't that you seem respectable, I should begin to think that you wanted
  me out of the way for a bit. Name and address, please."</p>

  <p>Tavernake gave them readily. They passed out together into the street.</p>

  <p>"I shall report this matter," the man said, closing his book. "Perhaps the
  sergeant will have the house searched again. If you take my advice, sir," he
  added, "you'll go home."</p>

  <p>"I saw them both pass through that door," Tavernake repeated, half to
  himself, still standing upon the pavement and staring at the unlit
  windows.</p>

  <p>The constable made no reply but moved off. Soon he reached the corner of
  the Terrace and disappeared. Tavernake slowly crossed the road and with his
  back to the railings looked steadfastly at the dark front of gray stone
  houses. Big Ben struck one o'clock, several people passed backwards and
  forwards. Men were coming out from the club, and separating for the night;
  the roar of the city was growing fainter. Yet Tavernake felt indisposed to
  move. The look in that man's drawn white face and black eyes haunted him,
  There was tragedy there, the shadow of terrible things, fear, and the
  murderous desire to kill! Through that door they had passed, the two men, one
  in flight, the other in pursuit. Where were they now? Perhaps it had been a
  trap. Pritchard had spoken seriously enough of his enemies.</p>

  <p>Then, as he stood there, he saw for the first time a thin line of light
  through the closely-drawn curtains of a room on the ground floor of the
  adjoining house. Without a moment's hesitation, he crossed the road and rang
  the bell. The door was opened, after a trifling delay, by a man in plain
  clothes, who might, however, have been a servant in mufti. He looked at
  Tavernake suspiciously.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to have disturbed you," Tavernake explained, "but I saw some
  one go in the house next to you, a little time ago. Can you tell me if you
  have heard any noises or voices during the last half-hour?"</p>

  <p>The man shook his head.</p>

  <p>"We have heard nothing, sir," he said.</p>

  <p>"Who lives here?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>"Did you call me up at one o'clock in the morning to ask silly questions?"
  the man replied insolently. "Every one's in bed here and I was just
  going."</p>

  <p>"There's a light in your ground floor room," Tavernake remarked. "There's
  some one talking there now&mdash;I can hear voices."</p>

  <p>The man closed the door in his face. For some time Tavernake wandered
  restlessly about, starting at last reluctantly homewards. He had reached the
  Strand and was crossing Trafalgar Square when a sudden thought held him. He
  stood still for a moment in the middle of the street. Then he turned abruptly
  round. In less than five minutes he was once more on the Terrace.</p><a name=

  <h2>XIX. TAVERNAKE INTERVENES</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake had the feelings of a man suddenly sobered as he
  turned once more into the Adelphi Terrace. Waiting until no one was in sight,
  he opened the door of the empty house with the Yale key which he had kept,
  and carefully closed it. He struck a match and listened for several minutes
  intently; not a sound from anywhere. He moved a few yards further to the
  bottom of the stairs, and listened again; still silence. He turned the handle
  of the ground floor apartment and commenced a fresh search. Room by room he
  examined by the light of his rapidly dwindling matches. This time he meant to
  leave behind him no possibility of any mistake. He even measured the depths
  of the walls for any secret hiding place. From room to room he passed,
  leisurely, always on the alert, always listening. Once, as he opened a door
  on the third floor there was a soft scurrying as though of a skirt across the
  floor. He struck a match quickly, to find a great rat sitting up and looking
  at him with black, beady eyes. It was the only sign of life he found in the
  whole building.</p>

  <p>When he had finished his search, he came down to the ground floor and
  entered the room corresponding with the one from which he had heard voices in
  the adjoining house. He crouched here upon the dusty boards for some time,
  listening. Now and then he fancied that he could still hear voices on the
  other side of the wall, but he was never absolutely certain.</p>

  <p>At last he rose to stretch himself, and almost as he did so a fresh sound
  from outside attracted his notice. A motor-car had turned into the Terrace.
  He walked to the uncurtained window and stood there, sure of being himself
  unseen. Then his heart gave a great leap. Unemotional though he was, this was
  a happening which might well have excited a more phlegmatic individual. A
  motor-car which he remembered very well, although it was driven now by a man
  in dark livery, had stopped at the next house. A woman and two men had
  descended. Tavernake never glanced at the latter; his eyes were fastened upon
  their companion. She was wrapped in a long cloak, but she lifted her skirts
  as she crossed the pavement, and he saw the flash of her silver buckles. Her
  carriage, her figure, were unmistakable. It was Elizabeth who was paying this
  early morning visit next door! Already the little party had disappeared. They
  did not even ring the bell. The door must have been opened silently at their
  coming. The motor-car glided off. Once more the Terrace was deserted.</p>

  <p>Tavernake felt sure that he knew now the solution,&mdash;there was a way
  from this house into the next one. He struck another match and, standing back
  a few yards, looked critically at the dividing wall. In ancient days this had
  evidently been a dwelling-house of importance, elaborately decorated, as the
  fresco work upon the ceiling still indicated. The wall had been divided into
  three panels, with a high wainscoting. Inch by inch he examined it from one
  end to the other; he started from the back and came toward the front. About
  three-quarters of the way there, he paused. It was very simple, after all.
  The solid wall for a couple of feet suddenly ceased, and the design was
  continued with an expanse of stretched canvas, which yielded easily to his
  finger. He leaned his ear against it; he could hear now distinctly the sound
  of voices&mdash;he heard even the woman's laughter. For the height of about
  four feet the wall had been bodily removed. He made a small hole in the
  canvas&mdash;there was still darkness. He enlarged the hole until he could
  thrust his hand through&mdash;there was nothing but canvas the other side. He
  knew now where he was. There was only that single thickness of canvas between
  him and the room. He had but to make the smallest hole in it and he would be
  able to see through. Even now, with the removal of the barrier on his side,
  the voices were more distinct. A complete section of the wall had evidently
  been taken out and replaced by a detachable framework of wood covered with
  stretched canvas. He stood back for a moment and felt with his finger; he
  could almost trace the spot where the woodwork fitted upon hinges. Then he
  went on his hands and knees again, and with his penknife in his hand he
  paused to listen. He could hear the man Crease talking&mdash;a slow, nasal
  drawl. Then he heard Pritchard's voice, followed by what seemed to be a
  groan. There was a silence, then Elizabeth seemed to ask a question. He heard
  her low laugh and some note in it sent a shiver through his body. Pritchard
  was speaking fiercely now. Then, in the middle of his sentence, there was
  silence once more, followed by another groan. He could almost feel the people
  in that room holding their breaths.</p>

  <p>Tavernake was rapidly forgetting all caution. The point of his knife was
  through the canvas. Slowly he worked it round until a small piece, the size
  of a half-crown, was partially cut through. With infinite pains he got his
  head and shoulders into the small recess and for the first time looked into
  the room. Pritchard was sitting almost in the middle of the apartment; his
  arms seemed to be bound to the chair and his legs were tied together. A few
  yards away, Elizabeth, her fur coat laid aside, was lounging back in an
  easy-chair, her dress all glittering with sequins, a curious light in her
  eyes, a cruel smile parting her lips. By her side&mdash;sitting, in fact, on
  the arm of her chair&mdash;was Crease, his long, worn face paler, even, than
  usual; his lips curled in a smile of cynical amusement. Major Post was there,
  carefully dressed as though he had been attending some social gathering,
  standing upon the hearth-rug with his coat-tails under his arms. The
  professor, in whose face seemed written the most abject terror, was talking.
  Tavernake now could hear every word distinctly.</p>

  <p>"My dear Elizabeth! My dear Crease! You are both too precipitate! I tell
  you that I protest&mdash;I protest most strongly. Mr. Pritchard, I am sure,
  with a little persuasion, will listen to reason. I will not be a party to any
  such proceeding as&mdash;as this. You understand, Crease? We have gone quite
  far enough as it is. I will not have it."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"My dear father," she said, "you will really have to take something for
  your nerves. Nothing need happen to Mr. Pritchard at all unless he asks for
  it. He has his chance&mdash;. no one should expect more."</p>

  <p>"You are right, my dear Elizabeth," declared Crease, speaking very slowly
  and with his usual drawl. "This question of his health for the
  future&mdash;at any rate, for the immediate future&mdash;is entirely in
  Pritchard's own hands. There is no one who has received so many warnings as
  he. Bramley was cautioned twice; Mallison was warned three times and burned
  to death; Forsith had word from us only once, and he was shot in a drunken
  brawl. This man Pritchard has been warned a dozen times, he has escaped death
  twice. The time has come to show him that we are in earnest. Threats are
  useless; the time has come for deeds. I say that if Pritchard refuses this
  trifling request of ours, let us see that he leaves this house in such a
  state that he will not be able to do us any harm for some time at least."</p>

  <p>"But he will give his word!" the professor cried excitedly. "I am quite
  sure that if you allow me to talk to him reasonably, he will pledge his word
  to go back to the States and interfere no longer with your affairs."</p>

  <p>Pritchard turned his head slightly. He was a little pale, and the blood
  was dropping slowly on to the floor from a wound in his temple, but his tone
  was contemptuous.</p>

  <p>"I will give you my word, Professor, and you, Elizabeth Gardner, and you,
  Jim Post, and you, Walter Crease, that crippled, or straight, in evil or good
  health, from the very jaws of death I will hang on to life until you have
  paid your just debts. You understand that, all of you? I don't know what sort
  of a show this is. You may be in earnest, or you may be trying a rag. In any
  case, let me assure you of this. You won't get me to beg for mercy. If you
  force me to drink that stuff you are talking about, I'll find the antidote,
  and as sure as there's a prison in America, so surely I'll make you suffer
  for it! If you take my advice," he went on slowly, "and I know what I'm
  talking about, you'll cut these ropes and set open your front door. You 'll
  live longer, all of you."</p>

  <p>"An idiot," Elizabeth remarked pleasantly, "can do but little harm in the
  world. The word of a person of weak intellect is not to be relied upon. For
  my part, I am very tired of our friend, Mr. Pritchard. If you others had been
  disposed to go to much greater lengths, if you had said 'Hang him from the
  ceiling,' I should have been well pleased."</p>

  <p>Pritchard made a slight movement in his chair&mdash;it was certainly not a
  movement of fear.</p>

  <p>"Madam," he said, "I admire your candor. Let me return it. I don't believe
  there's one of you here has the pluck to attempt to do me any serious injury.
  If there is, get on with it. You hear, Mr. Walter Crease? Bring out that
  bottle of yours."</p>

  <p>Crease removed his cigar from his lips and rose slowly to his feet. From
  his waistcoat pocket he produced a small phial, from which he drew the
  cork.</p>

  <p>"Seems to me it's up to us to do the trick," he remarked languidly. "Catch
  hold of his forehead, Jimmy."</p>

  <p>The man known as Major Post threw away his cigarette, and coming round
  behind Pritchard's chair, suddenly bent the man's head backward. Crease
  advanced, phial in hand. Then all Hell seemed to be let loose in Tavernake.
  He stepped back in his place and marked the extent of that wooden partition.
  Then, setting his teeth, he sprang at it, throwing the great weight of his
  massive shoulder against the framework door. Scratched and bleeding, but
  still upon his feet, he burst into the room, with the noise of bricks falling
  behind,&mdash;an apparition so unexpected that the little company gathered
  there seemed turned into some waxwork group from the Chamber of
  Horrors&mdash;motionless, without even the power of movement.</p>

  <p>Tavernake, in those few moments, was like a giant among a company of
  degenerates. He was strong, his muscles were like whipcord, and his condition
  was perfect. Walter Crease went over like a log before his fist; Major Post
  felt the revolver at which he had snatched struck from his hand, and he
  himself remembered nothing more till he came to his senses some time
  afterwards. A slash and a cut and Pritchard was free. The professor stood
  wringing his hands. Elizabeth had risen to her feet. She was pale, but she
  was still more nearly composed than any other person in the room. Tavernake
  and Pritchard were masters of the situation. Pritchard leaned toward the
  mirror and straightened his tie.</p>

  <p>"I am afraid," he said looking down at Walter Crease's groaning figure,
  "that our hosts are scarcely in fit condition to take leave of us. Never
  mind, Mrs. Gardner, we excuse ourselves to you. I cannot pretend to be sorry
  that my friend's somewhat impetuous entrance has disturbed your plans for the
  evening, but I do hope that you will realize now the fatuousness of such
  methods in these days. Good-night! It is time we finished our stroll
  together, Tavernake."</p>

  <p>They moved towards the door&mdash;there was no one to stop them. Only the
  professor tried to say a few words.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mr. Pritchard&mdash;my dear Pritchard, if you will allow me to
  call you so," he exclaimed, "let me beg of you, before you leave us, not to
  take this trifling adventure too seriously! I can assure you that it was
  simply an attempt to coerce you, not in the least an affair to be taken
  seriously!"</p>

  <p>Pritchard smiled.</p>

  <p>"Professor," he said, "and you, Walter Crease, and you, Jimmy Post, if
  you're able to listen, listen to me. You have played the part of children
  to-night. So surely as men and women exist who live as you do, so surely must
  the law wait upon their heels. You cannot cheat justice. It is as inexorable
  as Time itself. When you try these little tricks, you simply give another
  turn to the wheel, add another danger to life. You had better learn to look
  upon me as necessary, all of you, for I am certainly inevitable."</p>

  <p>They passed backwards through the door, then they went down the silent
  hall and out into the street. Even as they did so, the clock struck a quarter
  to two.</p>

  <p>"My friend Tavernake," Pritchard declared, lighting a cigarette with
  steady fingers, "you are a man. Come into the club with me while I bathe my
  forehead. After all, we'll have that drink together before we say
  goodnight."</p>

  <h2>XX. A PLEASANT REUNION</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake awoke some hours later with a puzzled sense of
  having lost his own identity, of having taken up another man's life, stepped
  into another man's shoes. From the day of his first arrival in London, a raw
  country youth, till the night when he had spoken to Beatrice on the roof of
  Blenheim House, nothing that could properly be called an adventure had ever
  happened to him. He had never for a moment felt the want of it; he had not
  even indulged in the reading of books of romance. The thing which had
  happened last night, as in the cold morning sunlight he sat up in his bed,
  seemed to him a thing grotesque, inconceivable. It was not really possible
  that those people&mdash;those well-bred, well-looking people&mdash;had
  seriously contemplated an enormity which seemed to belong to the back pages
  of history, or that he, Tavernake, had burst through a wall with no weapons
  in his hand, and had dominated the situation! He sat there steadily thinking.
  It was incredible, but it was true! There existed still in his mind some
  faint doubt as to whether they would really have proceeded to extremities.
  Pritchard himself had made light of the whole affair, afterwards had treated
  it, indeed, as a huge practical joke. Tavernake, remembering that little
  group as he had first seen it, remained doubtful.</p>

  <p>By degrees, his own personal characteristics began to assert themselves.
  He began to wonder how his action would affect his commercial interests. He
  had probably made an enemy of this wonderful sister of Beatrice's, the woman
  who had so completely filled his thoughts during the last few days, the
  woman, too, who was to have found the money by means of which he was to set
  his feet upon the first rung of the ladder. This was a thing, he decided,
  which must be settled at once. He must see her and know exactly what terms
  they were on, whether or not she meant to be off with her bargain. The
  thought of action of any sort was stimulating. He rose and dressed, had his
  breakfast, and set out on his pilgrimage.</p>

  <p>Soon after eleven o'clock, he presented himself at the Milan Court and
  asked for Mrs. Wenham Gardner. For several minutes he waited about in nervous
  anticipation, then he was told that she was not at home. More than a little
  disappointed, he pressed for news of her. The hall porter thought that she
  had gone down into the country, and if so it was doubtful when she would be
  back. Tavernake was now seriously disconcerted.</p>

  <p>"I want particularly to wire to her," he insisted. "Please find out from
  her maid how I shall direct a telegram."</p>

  <p>The hall porter, who was a most superior person, regarded him blandly.</p>

  <p>"We do not give addresses, sir," he explained, "unless at the expressed
  wish of our clients. If you leave a telegram here, I will send it up to Mrs.
  Gardner's rooms to be forwarded."</p>

  <p>Tavernake scribbled one out, begging for news of her return, added his
  address and left the place. Then he wandered aimlessly about the streets.
  There seemed something flat about the morning, some aftermath of the
  excitement of the previous night was still stirring in his blood.
  Nevertheless, he pulled himself together with an effort, called for a young
  surveyor whom he had engaged to assist him, and spent the rest of the day out
  upon the hill. Religiously he kept his thoughts turned upon his work until
  the twilight came. Then he hurried home to meet the disappointment which he
  had more than half anticipated. There was no telegram for him! He ate his
  dinner and sat with folded arms, looking out into the street. Still no
  telegram! The restlessness came back once more. Soon after ten o'clock it
  became unbearable. He found himself longing for company, the loneliness of
  his little room since the departure of Beatrice had never seemed so real a
  thing. He stood it as long as he could and then, catching up his hat and
  stick, he set his face eastwards, walking vigorously, and with frequent
  glances at the clocks he passed.</p>

  <p>A few minutes past eleven o'clock, he found himself once more in that dark
  thoroughfare at the back of the theatre. The lamp over the stage-door was
  flickering in the same uncertain manner, the same motor-cars were there, the
  same crowd of young men, except that each night they seemed to grow larger.
  This time he had a few minutes only to wait. Beatrice came out among the
  earliest. At the sight of her he was suddenly conscious that he had, after
  all, no excuse for coming, that she would probably cross-examine him about
  Elizabeth, would probably guess the secret of his torments. He shrank back,
  but he was a moment too late for she had seen him. With a few words of excuse
  to the others with whom she was talking, she picked up her skirts and came
  swiftly across the muddy street. Tavernake had no time to escape. He remained
  there until she came, but his cheeks were hot, and he had an uncomfortable
  feeling that his presence, that their meeting like this, was an embarrassment
  to both of them.</p>

  <p>"My dear Leonard," she exclaimed, "why do you hide over there?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered simply.</p>

  <p>She laughed.</p>

  <p>"It looks as though you didn't want to see me," she remarked. "If you
  didn't, why are you here?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose I did want to see you," he replied. "Anyhow, I was lonely. I
  wanted to talk to some one. I walked all the way up here from Chelsea."</p>

  <p>"You have something to tell me?" she suggested.</p>

  <p>"There was something," he admitted. "I thought perhaps you ought to know.
  I had supper with your father last night. We talked about you."</p>

  <p>She started as though he had struck her; her face was suddenly pale and
  anxious.</p>

  <p>"Are you serious, Leonard?" she asked. "My father?"</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said. "I ought not to have blundered it out like that. I
  forgot that you&mdash;you were not seeing anything of him."</p>

  <p>"How did you meet him?"</p>

  <p>"By accident," he answered. "I was sitting alone up in the balcony at
  Imano's, and he wanted my table because he could see you from there, so we
  shared it, and then we began talking. I knew who he was, of course; I had
  seen him in your sister's room. He told me that he had engaged the table for
  every night this week."</p>

  <p>She looked across the road.</p>

  <p>"I can't go out with those people now," she declared. "Wait here for
  me."</p>

  <p>She went back to her friends and talked to them for a moment or two.
  Tavernake could hear Grier's protesting voice and Beatrice's light laugh.
  Evidently they were trying uselessly to persuade her to change her mind. Soon
  she came back to him.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said reluctantly. "I am afraid that I have spoiled your
  evening."</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish, please," she replied taking his arm. "Do you believe
  that my father will be up in the balcony at Imano's to-night?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake nodded.</p>

  <p>"He told me so."</p>

  <p>"We will go and sit up there," she decided. "He knows where I am to be
  found now so it doesn't matter. I should like to see him."</p>

  <p>They walked off together. Though she was evidently absent and distressed,
  Tavernake felt once more that sense of pleasant companionship which her near
  presence always brought him.</p>

  <p>"There is something else I must ask you," she began presently. "I want to
  know if you have seen Pritchard lately."</p>

  <p>"I was with him last night," Tavernake answered.</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"He was asking questions?"</p>

  <p>"Not about you," Tavernake assured her quickly. "It is your sister in whom
  he is interested."</p>

  <p>Beatrice nodded, but she seemed very little relieved. Tavernake could see
  that the old look of fear was back in her face.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Beatrice," he said, regretfully. "I seem just now to be
  always bringing you reminiscences of the people whom it terrifies you to hear
  about."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"It isn't your fault, Leonard," she declared, "only it is rather strange
  that you should be mixed up with them in any way, isn't it? I suppose some
  day you'll find out everything about me. Perhaps you'll be sorry then that
  you ever even called yourself my brother."</p>

  <p>"Don't be foolish," he answered, brusquely.</p>

  <p>She patted his hand.</p>

  <p>"Is the speculation going all right?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"I am hoping to get the money together this week," he replied. "If I get
  it, I shall be well off in a year, rich in five years."</p>

  <p>"There is just a doubt about your getting it, then?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>"Just a doubt," he admitted. "I have a solicitor who is doing his best to
  raise a loan, but I have not heard from him for two days. Then I have also a
  friend who has promised it to me, a friend upon whom I am not quite sure if I
  can rely."</p>

  <p>They turned into the Strand.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about my father, Leonard," she begged.</p>

  <p>He hesitated; it was hard to know exactly how to speak of the
  professor.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps if you have talked with him at all," she went on, "it will help
  you to understand one of the difficulties I had to face in life."</p>

  <p>"He is, I should imagine, a little weak," Tavernake suggested,
  hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>"Very," she answered. "My mother left him in my charge, but I cannot keep
  him."</p>

  <p>"Your sister&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"My sister has more influence than I. She makes life easier for him."</p>

  <p>They reached the restaurant and made their way upstairs. Tavernake
  appropriated the same table and once more the head waiter protested.</p>

  <p>"If the gentleman comes again to-night," Tavernake said, "you will find
  that he will be only too glad to have supper with us."</p>

  <p>Then the professor came. He made his usual somewhat theatrical entrance,
  carrying his broad-brimmed hat in his hand, brandishing his silver-topped
  cane. When he saw Tavernake and Beatrice, he stopped short. Then he held out
  both hands, which Beatrice immediately seized. There were tears in his eyes,
  tears running down his cheeks. He sat down heavily in the chair which
  Tavernake was holding for him.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," he exclaimed, "why, this is most affecting! You have come here
  to have supper with your old father. You trust me, then?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," she replied, still clasping his hands. "If you give me away
  to Elizabeth, it will be the end. The next time I shall never be found."</p>

  <p>"For some days," he assured her, "I have known exactly where you were to
  be found. I have never spoken of it. You are safe. My meals up here," he
  added, with a little sigh, "have been sad feasts. To-night we will be
  cheerful. Some quails, I think, quails and some Clicquot for you, my dear.
  You need it. Ah, this is a happiness indeed!"</p>

  <p>"You know Mr. Tavernake, father," she remarked, after he had given a
  somewhat lengthy order to the waiter.</p>

  <p>"I met and talked with Mr. Tavernake here the other night," the professor
  admitted, with condescension.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake was very good to me at a time when I needed help," Beatrice
  told him.</p>

  <p>The professor grasped Tavernake's hands.</p>

  <p>"You were good to my child," he said, "you were good to me. Waiter, three
  cocktails immediately," he ordered, turning round. "I must drink your health,
  Mr. Tavernake&mdash;I must drink your health at once."</p>

  <p>Tavernake leaned forward towards Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he suggested, "whether you would not rather be alone with your
  father."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You know so much," she replied, "and it really doesn't seem to matter.
  Tell me, father, how do you spend your time?"</p>

  <p>"I must confess, dear," the professor said, "that I have little to do.
  Your sister Elizabeth is quite generous."</p>

  <p>Beatrice sat back in her chair as though she had been struck.</p>

  <p>"Father," she exclaimed, "listen! You are living on that money! Doesn't it
  seem terrible to you? Oh, how can you do it!"</p>

  <p>The professor looked at his daughter with an expression of pained
  surprise.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he explained, "your sister Elizabeth has always been the
  moneyed one of the family. She has brains and I trust her. It is not for me
  to inquire as to the source of the comforts she provides for me. I feel
  myself entitled to receive them, and so I accept."</p>

  <p>"But, father," she went on, "can't you see&mdash;don't you know that it's
  his money&mdash;Wenham's?"</p>

  <p>"It is not a matter, this, my child," the professor observed, sharply,
  "which we can discuss before strangers. Some day we will speak of it, you and
  I."</p>

  <p>"Has he&mdash;been heard of?" she asked, in a whisper.</p>

  <p>The professor frowned.</p>

  <p>"A hot-tempered young man, my dear," he declared uneasily, "a hot tempered
  young man, indeed. Elizabeth gives me to understand that it was just an
  ordinary quarrel and away he went."</p>

  <p>Beatrice was white to the lips.</p>

  <p>"An ordinary quarrel!" she muttered.</p>

  <p>She sat quite still. Tavernake unconsciously found himself watching her.
  There were things in her eyes which frightened him. It seemed as though she
  were looking out of the gay little restaurant, with its lights and music and
  air of comfort, out into some distant quarter of the world, some other and
  very different place. She was living through something which chilled her
  heart, something terrifying. Tavernake saw those things in her face and his
  eyes spelt them out mercilessly.</p>

  <p>"Father," she whispered, leaning towards him, "do you believe what you
  have just been saying to me?"</p>

  <p>It was the professor's turn to be disturbed. He concealed his
  discomfiture, however, with a gesture of annoyance.</p>

  <p>"That is scarcely a proper question, Beatrice," he answered sharply. "Ah,"
  he added, with more geniality, "the cocktails! My young friend Tavernake, I
  drink to our better acquaintance! You are English, as I can see, a real
  Britisher. Some day you must come out to our own great country&mdash;my
  daughter, of course, has told you that we are Americans. A great country,
  sir,&mdash;the greatest I have ever lived in&mdash;room to breathe, room to
  grow, room for a young man like you to plant his ambitions and watch them
  blossom. To our better acquaintance, Mr. Tavernake, and may we meet some day
  in the United States!"</p>

  <p>Tavernake drank the first cocktail in his life and wiped the tears from
  his eyes. The professor found safety in conversation.</p>

  <p>"You know," he went on, "that I am a man of science. Physiognomy delights
  me. Men and women as I meet them represent to me varying types of humanity,
  all interesting, all appealing to my peculiar love of the science of
  psychology. You, my dear Mr. Tavernake, if I may venture to be so personal,
  represent to me, as you sit there, the exact prototype of the young working
  Englishman. You are, I should judge, thorough, dogmatic, narrow, persistent,
  industrious, and bound to be successful according to the scope and nature of
  your ambitions. In this country you will never develop. In my country, sir,
  we should make a colossus of you. We should teach you not to be content with
  small things; we should raise your hand which you yourself kept to your side,
  and we should point your finger to the skies. Waiter," he added, turning
  abruptly round, "if the quails are not yet ready I will take another of these
  excellent cocktails."</p>

  <p>Tavernake was embarrassed. He saw that Beatrice was anxious to talk to her
  father; he saw, also, that her father was determined not to talk to her. With
  a little sigh, however, she resigned herself to the inevitable.</p>

  <p>"I have lectured, sir," the professor continued, "in most of the cities of
  the United States, upon the human race. The tendencies of every unit of the
  human race are my peculiar study. When I speak to you of phrenology, sir, you
  smile, and you think, perhaps, of a man who sits in a back room and takes
  your shilling for feeling the bumps of your head. I am not of this order of
  scientific men, sir. I have diplomas from every university worth mentioning.
  I blend the sciences which treat with the human race. I know something of all
  of them. Character reading to me is at once a passion and a science. Leave me
  alone with a man or a woman for five minutes, paint me a map of Life, and I
  will set the signposts along which that person will travel, and I shall not
  miss one."</p>

  <p>"You are doing no work over here, father, are you?" Beatrice asked.</p>

  <p>"None, my dear," he answered, with a faint note of regret in his tone.
  "Your sister Elizabeth seemed scarcely to desire it. Her movements are very
  uncertain and she likes to have me constantly at hand. My daughter
  Elizabeth," he continued, turning to Tavernake, "is a very beautiful young
  woman, left in my charge under peculiar circumstances. I feel it my duty,
  therefore, to be constantly at hand."</p>

  <p>Again there was a flash of that strange look in the girl's face. She
  leaned forward, but her father declined to meet her gaze.</p>

  <p>"May I ask one or two personal questions?" she faltered. "Remember, I have
  not seen or heard anything from either of you for seven months."</p>

  <p>"By all means, my dear," the professor declared. "Your sister, I am glad
  to say, is well. I myself am as you see me. We have had a pleasant time and
  we have met some dear old friends from the other side. Our greatest trouble
  is that you are temporarily lost to us."</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth doesn't guess&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"My child," the professor interrupted, "I have been loyal to you. If
  Elizabeth knew that I could tell her at any moment your exact whereabouts, I
  think that she would be more angry with me than ever she has been in her
  life, and, my dear," he added, "you know, when Elizabeth is angry, things are
  apt to be unpleasant. But I have been dumb. I have not spoken, nor shall I.
  Yet," the professor went on, "you must not think, Beatrice, that because I
  yield to your whim in this matter I recognize any sufficient cause why you
  should voluntarily estrange yourself from those whose right and privilege it
  is to look after you. You are able, I am glad to see, to make your way in the
  world. I have attended the Atlas Theatre, and I am glad to see that you have
  lost none of your old skill in the song and dance. You are deservedly popular
  there. Soon, I have no doubt, you will aspire to more important parts. Still,
  my dear child," the professor continued, disposing of his second cocktail, "I
  see no reason why your very laudable desire to remain independent should be
  incompatible with a life under your sister's roof and my protection. Mr.
  Tavernake here, with his British instincts, will, I am sure, agree with me
  that it is not well for a young lady&mdash;my own daughter, sir, but I may
  say it&mdash;of considerable personal attractions, to live alone or under the
  chaperonage merely of these other young ladies of the theatre."</p>

  <p>"I think,", Tavernake said, "that your daughter must have very strong
  reasons for preferring to live alone."</p>

  <p>"Imaginary ones, my dear sir," the professor assured
  him,&mdash;"altogether imaginary. The quails at last! And the Clicquot! Now
  this is really a delightful little meeting. I drink to its repetition. This
  is indeed a treat for me. Beatrice, my love to you! Mr. Tavernake, my best
  respects! The only vintage, sir," he concluded, setting down his empty glass
  appreciatively.</p>

  <p>"To go back to what you were saying just now," Tavernake remarked, "I
  quite agree with you about Beatrice's living alone. I am very anxious for her
  to marry me."</p>

  <p>The professor set down his knife and fork. His appearance was one of
  ponderous theatricality.</p>

  <p>"Sir," he declared, "this is indeed a most momentous statement. Am I to
  take it as a serious offer for my daughter's hand?"</p>

  <p>Beatrice leaned over and laid her fingers upon his.</p>

  <p>"Father," she said, "it doesn't matter please. I am not willing to marry
  Mr. Tavernake."</p>

  <p>The professor looked from one to the other and coughed.</p>

  <p>"Are Mr. Tavernake's means," he asked, "of sufficient importance to
  warrant his entering into matrimony?"</p>

  <p>"I have no money at all to speak of," Tavernake answered. "That really
  isn't important. I shall very soon make all that your daughter can
  spend."</p>

  <p>"I agree with my daughter, sir," the professor declared. "The subject
  might well be left until such time as you have improved your position. We
  will dismiss it, therefore,&mdash;dismiss it at once. We will
  talk&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Father," Beatrice interrupted, "let us talk about yourself. Don't you
  think you would be more contented, happier, if you were to try to arrange for
  a few&mdash;a few demonstrations or lectures over here, as you at first
  intended? I know that you must find having nothing to do such a strain upon
  you," she added.</p>

  <p>It was perhaps by accident that her eyes were fixed upon the glass which
  the professor was carrying to his lips. He set it down at once.</p>

  <p>"My child," he said, in a low tone, "I understand you."</p>

  <p>"No, no," she insisted, "I didn't mean that, but you are always better
  when you are working. A man like you," she went on, a little wistfully,
  "should not waste his talents."</p>

  <p>He sighed.</p>

  <p>"You are perhaps right, my child," he admitted. "I will go and see my
  agents to-morrow. Up till now," he went on, "I have refused all offers. I
  have felt that Elizabeth, the care of Elizabeth in her peculiar position,
  demanded my whole attention. Perhaps you are right. Perhaps I have
  over-estimated the necessity of being constantly at her right hand. She is a
  very clever woman Elizabeth," he concluded, "very clever indeed."</p>

  <p>"Where is she now, father?" Beatrice asked.</p>

  <p>"She motored into the country early this morning with some friends," the
  professor said. "They went to a party last night with Walter Crease, London
  correspondent to the New York Gazette," he explained, turning a little away
  from Tavernake. "They were all home very late, I understand, and Elizabeth
  complained of a headache this morning. Personally, I regret to say that I was
  not up when they left."</p>

  <p>Beatrice leaned quite close to her father.</p>

  <p>"Do you see anything of the man Pritchard?" she inquired.</p>

  <p>The professor was suddenly flabby. He set down his glass, spilling half
  its contents. He stole a quick glance at Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"My child," he exclaimed, "you ought to consider my nerves! You know very
  well that the sudden mention of any one whom I dislike so intensely is bad
  for me. I am surprised at you, Beatrice. You show a culpable lack of
  consideration for my infirmities."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, father," she whispered, "but is he here?"</p>

  <p>"He is," the professor admitted. "Between ourselves," he added, a white,
  scared look upon his pale face, "he is spoiling my whole peace of mind. My
  enjoyment of the comforts which Elizabeth is able to provide for me is
  interfered with by that man's constant presence. He seldom speaks, and yet he
  seems always to be watching. I do not trust him, Beatrice. I am a judge of
  men and I tell you that I do not trust him."</p>

  <p>"I wish that Elizabeth would go away," Beatrice said in a low tone. "Of
  course, I have no right&mdash;to say things. Nothing serious has perhaps ever
  happened. And yet&mdash;and yet, for her own sake, I do not think that she
  should stay here in London with Pritchard close at hand."</p>

  <p>The professor raised his glass with shaking fingers.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth knows what is best," he declared, "I am sure that Elizabeth
  knows what is best, but I, too, am beginning to wish that she would go away.
  Last night we met him at Walter Crease's."</p>

  <p>Once more he turned a little nervously towards Tavernake, who was looking
  down into the body of the restaurant with immovable face.</p>

  <p>"We tried to persuade him then to go away. He is really in rather a
  dangerous position here. Jimmy Post has sworn that he will not be taken back
  to New York, and there are one or two others&mdash;a pretty desperate crew.
  We tried last night to reason with Pritchard."</p>

  <p>"It was no good?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"No good at all," the professor answered, drily. "Perhaps, if we had not
  been interrupted, we might have convinced him."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," she begged.</p>

  <p>The professor shook his head. Tavernake still had that air of paying no
  attention whatever to their conversation.</p>

  <p>"It is not for you to know about, my dear," he concluded. "You have chosen
  very wisely to keep out of these matters. Elizabeth has such wonderful
  courage. My own nerve, I regret to say, is not quite what it was. Waiter, I
  will take a liqueur of the old brandy in a large glass."</p>

  <p>The brandy was brought, but the professor seemed haunted by memories and
  his spirits never wholly returned. Not until the lights were turned down and
  Tavernake had paid the bill, did he partially recover his former manner.</p>

  <p>"Dear child," he said, as they stood up together, "I cannot tell you what
  the pleasure has been of this brief reunion."</p>

  <p>She rested her fingers upon his shoulders and looked up into his face.</p>

  <p>"Father," she begged, softly, "come to me. I can keep you, if you don't
  mind for a short time being poor. You shall have all my salary except just
  enough for my clothes, and anything will do for me to wear. I will try so
  hard to make you comfortable."</p>

  <p>He looked at her with an air of offended dignity.</p>

  <p>"My child," he replied, "you must not talk to me like that. If I did not
  feel that my duty lay with Elizabeth, I should insist upon your coming to me,
  and under those conditions it would be I who should provide, not you. But for
  the moment I cannot leave your elder sister altogether. She needs me."</p>

  <p>Beatrice turned away a little sadly. They all three descended the
  stairs.</p>

  <p>"I shall leave our young friend, Mr. Tavernake, to escort you to your
  home," the professor announced. "I myself shall telephone to see if Elizabeth
  has returned. If she is still away, I shall spend an hour or two, I think,
  with my friends at the Blue Room Club. Beatrice, this has been a joy to me, a
  joy soon, I hope, to be repeated."</p>

  <p>He took both her hands. She smiled at him with an attempt at
  cheerfulness.</p>

  <p>"Good-night, father!" she said.</p>

  <p>"And to you, sir, also, good-night!" the professor added, taking
  Tavernake's hand and holding it for a minute in his, while he looked
  impressively in his face. "I will not say too much, but I will say this: so
  much as I have seen of you, I like. Good-night!"</p>

  <p>He turned and strode away. Both Beatrice and Tavernake watched him until
  he disappeared. Then, with a sigh, she picked up her skirts with her right
  hand, and took Tavernake's arm.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind walking home?" she asked. "My head aches."</p>

  <p>Tavernake looked for a moment wistfully across the road toward the Milan
  Court. Beatrice's hand, however, only held his arm the tighter.</p>

  <p>"I am going to make you come with me every step of the way," she declared,
  "so you can just as well make the best of it. Afterwards&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"What about afterwards?" he interrupted.</p>

  <p>"Afterwards," she continued, with decision, "you are to go straight
  home!"</p>

  <h2>XXI. SOME EXCELLENT ADVICE</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake, in response to a somewhat urgent message, walked
  into his solicitor's office almost as soon as they opened on the following
  morning. The junior partner of the firm, who took an interest in him, and was
  anxious, indeed, to invest a small amount in the Marston Rise Building
  Company, received him cordially but with some concern.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Tavernake," he said, "I thought I'd better write a line and
  ask you to come down. You haven't forgotten, have you, that our option of
  purchase lasts only three days longer?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well, what of it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"It's just as well that you should understand the situation," the lawyer
  continued. "Your old people are hard upon our heels in this matter, and there
  will be no chance of any extension&mdash;not even for an hour. Mr. Dowling
  has already put in an offer a thousand pounds better than yours; I heard that
  incidentally yesterday afternoon; so you may be sure that the second your
  option has legally expired, the thing will be off altogether so far as you're
  concerned."</p>

  <p>"That's all very well," Tavernake remarked, "but what about the plots that
  already belong to me?"</p>

  <p>"They have some sort of scheme for leaving those high and dry," the
  solicitor explained. "You see, the drainage and lighting will be largely
  influenced by the purchaser of the whole estate. If Dowling gets it, he means
  to treat your plots so that they will become practically valueless. It's
  rather a mean sort of thing, but then he's a mean little man."</p>

  <p>Tavernake nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well," he announced, "I was coming to see you, anyhow, this morning, to
  talk to you about the money."</p>

  <p>"Your friend isn't backing out?" the lawyer asked, quickly.</p>

  <p>"My friend has not said anything about backing out yet," Tavernake
  replied, "but circumstances have arisen during the last few days which have
  altered my own views as to the expediency of business relations with this
  person. I haven't any reason to suppose that the money won't be forthcoming,
  but if I could get it from any other source, I should prefer it."</p>

  <p>The solicitor looked blank.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he said, "I'll do what I can, if you like, but I may as well
  tell you at once that I don't think I should have a ghost of a chance of
  raising the whole amount."</p>

  <p>"I suppose," Tavernake inquired, thoughtfully, "your firm couldn't do
  anything?"</p>

  <p>"We could do something, certainly," the solicitor answered, "on account of
  our own clients. We might, perhaps, manage up to five thousand pounds. That
  would still leave us wanting seven, however, and I scarcely see where we
  could get it."</p>

  <p>Tavernake was silent for a few moments.</p>

  <p>"You haven't quarreled with your friend, have you?" the solicitor
  asked.</p>

  <p>"No, there has been no quarrel," Tavernake replied. "I have another
  reason."</p>

  <p>"If I were you, I'd try and forget it," his friend advised. "To tell you
  the truth, I have been feeling rather anxious about this affair. It's a big
  thing, you know, and the profit is as sure as the dividend on Consols. I
  should hate to have that little bounder Dowling get in and scoop it up."</p>

  <p>"It's a fine investment," admitted Tavernake, "and, as you say, there
  isn't the slightest risk. That's why I was hoping you might have been able to
  manage it without my calling upon my friend."</p>

  <p>Mr. Martin shook his head.</p>

  <p>"It isn't so easy to convince other people. All the same, I don't want to
  get left. If you'll take my advice, you'll go and call on your friend at
  once, and see exactly how matters stand. If everything's O.K. and you can
  induce him to part a few hours before it is absolutely necessary, I must
  confess that it would take a load off my mind. I don't like these affairs
  that have to be concluded at the last possible moment."</p>

  <p>"Well," Tavernake agreed, "I must try what I can do, then. There is
  nothing else fresh, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," the solicitor answered. "Come back, if you can make any
  definite arrangement, or telephone. The matter is really bothering me a
  little. I don't want to have the other people slip in now."...</p>

  <p>Tavernake, instead of obeying his first impulse and making his way direct
  to the Milan Court, walked to the flat in Kingsway, climbed up the stone
  steps, and asked for Beatrice. She met him at her own door, fully
  dressed.</p>

  <p>"My dear Leonard!" she exclaimed, in surprise. "What an early caller!"</p>

  <p>"I want a few words with you," he said. "Can you spare me five
  minutes?"</p>

  <p>"You must walk with me to the theatre," she replied, "I am just off to
  rehearsal."</p>

  <p>They descended the stairs together.</p>

  <p>"I have something to tell you," Tavernake began, "something to tell you
  which you won't like to hear."</p>

  <p>"Something which I won't like to hear," she repeated, fearfully. "Go on,
  Leonard. It can't be worse than it sounds."</p>

  <p>"I don't know why I've come to tell you," he went on. "I never meant to.
  It came into my mind all of a sudden and I felt that I must. It has to do
  with your sister and the Marston Rise affair."</p>

  <p>"My sister and the Marston Rise affair!" Beatrice exclaimed,
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>Then a sudden light broke in upon her. She stopped short and clutched at
  his hand.</p>

  <p>"You don't mean that it was Elizabeth who was going to find you the
  money?" she cried.</p>

  <p>"I do," he answered. "She offered it of her own accord. I do not know why
  I talked to her of my own affairs, but she led me on to speak of them. Your
  sister is a wonderful person," he continued, dropping his voice. "I don't
  know why, but she made me talk as no one else has ever made me talk before. I
  simply had to tell her things. Then, when I had finished, she showed me her
  bankbooks and suggested that she should invest some of her money in the
  Rise."</p>

  <p>"But do you mean to tell me," Beatrice persisted, "that it is her money
  upon which you are relying for this purchase?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake nodded.</p>

  <p>"You see," he explained, "Mr. Dowling dropped upon us before I was
  prepared. As soon as he found out, he went to the owners of the estate and
  made them a bid for it. The consequence was that they shortened my option and
  gave me very little chance indeed to find the money. When your sister offered
  it, it certainly seemed a wonderful stroke of fortune. I could give her eight
  or ten per cent, whereas she would only get four anywhere else, and I should
  make a profit for myself of over ten thousand pounds, which I cannot do
  unless I find the money to buy the estate."</p>

  <p>"But you mustn't touch that money, you mustn't have anything to do with
  it!" Beatrice exclaimed, walking very fast and looking straight ahead. "You
  don't understand. How should you?"</p>

  <p>"Do you mean that the money was stolen?" Tavernake asked, after a moment's
  pause.</p>

  <p>"No, not stolen," Beatrice replied, "but it comes&mdash;oh! I can't tell
  you, only Elizabeth has no right to it. My own sister! It is all too
  awful!"</p>

  <p>"Do you think that she has come by this money dishonestly?"</p>

  <p>"I am not sure," Beatrice murmured. "There are worse things, more terrible
  things even than theft."</p>

  <p>The practical side of Tavernake's nature was very much to the fore that
  morning. He began to wonder whether women, after all, strange and fascinating
  creatures though they were, possessed judgment which could be relied
  upon&mdash;whether they were not swayed too much by sentiment.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," he said, "you must understand this. I have no time to raise
  the money elsewhere. If I don't get it from your sister, supposing she is
  still willing to let me have it, my chance has gone. I shall have to take a
  situation in some one else's office as a clerk&mdash;probably not so good a
  place as I held at Dowling &amp; Spence's. On the other hand, the use of that
  money for a very short time would be the start of my career. All that you say
  is so vague. Why need I know anything about it? I met your sister in the
  ordinary way of business and she has made an ordinary business proposition to
  me, one by which she will be, incidentally, very greatly benefited. I never
  thought of telling you this at all, but when the time came I hated to go and
  draw that money from your sister without having said anything to you. So I
  came this morning, but I want you, if you possibly can, to look at the matter
  from my point of view."</p>

  <p>She was silent for several moments. Then she glanced at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Why on earth," she asked, "should my sister make this offer to you? She
  isn't a fool. She doesn't usually trust strangers."</p>

  <p>"She trusted me, apparently," Tavernake answered.</p>

  <p>"Can you understand why?" Beatrice demanded.</p>

  <p>"I think that I can," he replied. "If one can rely upon one's perception,
  she is surrounded by people whom she might find agreeable companions but whom
  she is scarcely likely to have much confidence in. Perhaps she realized that
  I wasn't like them."</p>

  <p>"And you want very much to take this money?" she said, half to
  herself.</p>

  <p>"I want to very much indeed," Tavernake admitted. "I was on my way to see
  her this morning and to ask her to let me have it a day or two before the
  time, but I felt, somehow, that there seemed to be a certain amount of deceit
  in going to her and taking it without saying a word to you. I felt that I had
  to come here first. But Beatrice, don't ask me to give it up. It means such a
  long time before I can move again. It's the first step that's so difficult,
  and I must&mdash;I must make a start. It's such a chance, this. I have spent
  so many hours thinking about it. I have planned and worked and sketched it
  all out as no one else could do. I must have that money."</p>

  <p>They walked on in silence until they reached the stage door. Beatrice was
  thinking of her companion as she had seen him so often, poring over his
  plans, busy with ruler and india-rubber, absolutely absorbed in the interest
  of his task. She remembered the first time he had talked about this scheme of
  his, how his whole face had changed, the almost passionate interest with
  which he had worked the thing out even to its smallest details. She realized
  how great a part of his life the thing had become, what a terrible blow it
  would be to him to have to abandon it. She turned and faced him.</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she said, "perhaps, after all, you are right. Perhaps I give
  way too much to what, after all, is only a sentimental feeling. I am thankful
  that you came and told me; I shall always be thankful for that. Take the
  money, but pay it back as soon as you can."</p>

  <p>"I shall do that," he answered. "I shall do that you may rely upon
  it."</p>

  <p>She laid her hand upon his arm.</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she begged, "I know that Elizabeth is very beautiful and very
  fascinating, and I don't wonder that you like to go and see her, but I want
  to ask you to promise me one thing."</p>

  <p>He felt as though he were suddenly turned into stone. It was not
  possible&mdash;it could not be possible that she had guessed his secret!</p>

  <p>"Well?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"Don't let her introduce you to her friends; don't spend too much time
  there," she continued. "Elizabeth is my sister and I don't&mdash;really I
  don't want to say anything that doesn't sound kind, but her friends are not
  fit people for you to know, and Elizabeth&mdash;well she hasn't very much
  heart."</p>

  <p>He was silent for several moments.</p>

  <p>"How did you know I liked going to see your sister?" he asked,
  abruptly.</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"My dear Leonard," she said, "you are not very clever at hiding your
  feelings. When you came to see me the other day, do you imagine I believed
  for a single moment that you asked me to marry you simply because you cared?
  I think, Leonard, that it was because you were afraid, you were afraid of
  something coming into your life so big, so terrifying, that you were ready to
  clutch at the easiest chance of safety."</p>

  <p>"Beatrice, this is absurd!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"No, it isn't that," she declared. "Do you know, my dear Leonard, what
  there was about you from the very first which attracted me?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered.</p>

  <p>"It was your honesty," she continued. "You remember that night upon the
  roof at Blenheim House? You were going to tell a lie for me, and I know how
  you hated it. You love the truth, you are truthful naturally; I would rely
  upon you wherever I was. I know that you would keep your word, I know that
  you would be honest. A woman loves to feel that about a man&mdash;she loves
  it&mdash;and I don't want you to be brought near the people who sneer at
  honesty and all good things. I don't want you to hear their point of view.
  You may be simple and commonplace in some respects; I want you to stay just
  as you are. Do you understand?"</p>

  <p>"I understand," Tavernake replied gravely.</p>

  <p>A call boy shouted her name down the stone passage. She patted him on the
  shoulder and turned away.</p>

  <p>"Run along now and get the money," she said. "Come and see me when it's
  all over."</p>

  <p>Tavernake left her with a long breath of relief and made his way towards
  the Strand. At the corner of Wellington Street he came face to face with
  Pritchard. They stopped at once. There seemed to be something embarrassing
  about this meeting. Pritchard patted him familiarly on the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"How goes it, old man?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I am all right," Tavernake answered, somewhat awkwardly. "How are
  you?"</p>

  <p>"I guess I'd be the better for a drink," Pritchard declared. "Come along.
  Pretty well done up the other night, weren't we? We'll step into the American
  Bar here and try a gin fizz."</p>

  <p>They found themselves presently perched upon two high stools in a deserted
  corner of the bar to which Pritchard had led the way. Tavernake sipped his
  drink tentatively.</p>

  <p>"I should like," he said, "to ask you a question or two about Wednesday
  night."</p>

  <p>Pritchard nodded.</p>

  <p>"Go right ahead," he invited.</p>

  <p>"You seem to take the whole affair as a sort of joke," Tavernake
  remarked.</p>

  <p>"Well, isn't that what it was?" the detective asked, smiling.</p>

  <p>Tavernake shrugged his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"There didn't seem to me to be much joke about it!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p>Pritchard laughed gayly.</p>

  <p>"You are not used to Americans, my young friend," he said. "Over on this
  side you are all so fearfully literal. You are not seriously supposing that
  they meant to dose me with that stuff the other night, eh?"</p>

  <p>"I never thought that there was any doubt about it at all," Tavernake
  declared deliberately.</p>

  <p>Pritchard stroked his moustache meditatively.</p>

  <p>"Well," he remarked, "you are certainly green, and yet I don't know why
  you shouldn't be. Americans are always up to games of that sort. I am not
  saying that they didn't mean to give me a scare, if they could, or that they
  wouldn't have been glad to get a few words of information out of me, or a
  paper or two that I keep pretty safely locked up. It would have been a better
  joke on me then. But as for the rest, as for really trying to make me take
  that stuff, of course, that was all bunkum."</p>

  <p>Tavernake sat quite still in his chair for several minutes.</p>

  <p>"Will you take another gin fizz, Mr. Pritchard?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why not?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake gave the order. He sat on his stool whistling softly to
  himself.</p>

  <p>"Then I suppose," he said at last, "I must have looked a pretty sort of an
  ass coming through the wall like a madman."</p>

  <p>Pritchard shook his head.</p>

  <p>"You looked just about what you were," he answered, "a d&mdash;&mdash;d
  good sort. I'm not playing up to you that it was all pretense. You can never
  trust that gang. The blackguard outside was in earnest, anyway. After all,
  you know, they wouldn't miss me if I were to drop quietly out. There 's no
  one else they 're quite so much afraid of. There 's no one else knows quite
  as much about them."</p>

  <p>"Well, we'll let it go at that," Tavernake declared. "You know so much of
  all these people, though, that I rather wish you 'd tell me something I want
  very much to know."</p>

  <p>"It's by telling nothing," the detective replied quickly, "that I know as
  much as I do. Just one cocktail, eh?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I drank my first cocktail last night," he remarked. "I had supper with
  the professor and his daughter."</p>

  <p>"Not Elizabeth?" Pritchard asked swiftly.</p>

  <p>Tavernake shook his head.</p>

  <p>"With Miss Beatrice," he answered.</p>

  <p>Pritchard set down his glass.</p>

  <p>"Say, Tavernake," he inquired, "you are friendly with that young lady,
  Miss Beatrice, aren't you?"</p>

  <p>"I certainly am," Tavernake answered. "I have a very great regard for
  her."</p>

  <p>"Then I can tell you how to do her a good turn," Pritchard continued,
  earnestly. "Keep her away from that old blackguard. Keep her away from all
  the gang. Believe me, she is looking for trouble by even speaking to
  them."</p>

  <p>"But the man's her father," Tavernake objected, "and he seems fond of
  her."</p>

  <p>"Don't you believe it," Pritchard went on. "He's fond of nothing and
  nobody but himself and easy living. He's soft, mind you, he's got plenty of
  sentiment, he 'll squeeze a tear out of his eye, and all that sort of thing,
  but he'd sell his soul, or his daughter's soul, for a little extra comfort.
  Now Elizabeth doesn't know exactly where her sister is, and she daren't seem
  anxious, or go around making inquiries. Beatrice has her chance to keep away,
  and I can tell you it will be a thundering sight better for her if she
  does."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't understand it at all," Tavernake declared. "I hate
  mysteries."</p>

  <p>Pritchard set down his empty glass.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he remarked, "this affair is too serious, after all, for us
  to talk round like a couple of gossips. I have given you your warning, and if
  you're wise you 'll remember it."</p>

  <p>"Tell me this one thing," Tavernake persisted. "Tell me what is the cause
  of the quarrel between the two? Can't something be done to bring them
  together again?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Nothing," he answered. "As things are at present, they are better apart.
  Coming my way?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake followed him out of the place. Pritchard took his arm as he
  turned down toward the Strand.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "here is a word of advice for you. The
  Scriptures say that you cannot serve God and mammon. Paraphrase that to the
  present situation and remember that you cannot serve Elizabeth and
  Beatrice."</p>

  <p>"What then?" Tavernake demanded.</p>

  <p>The detective waited until he had lit the long black cigar between his
  teeth.</p>

  <p>"I guess you'd better confine your attentions to Beatrice," he
  concluded.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>XXII. DINNER WITH ELIZABETH</h2>

  <p class="first">The rest of that day was for Tavernake a period of feverish
  anxieties. He received two telegrams from Mr. Martin, his solicitor, and he
  himself was more uneasy than he cared to admit. At three o'clock in the
  afternoon, at eight in the evening, and again at eleven o'clock at night, he
  presented himself at the Milan Court, always with the same inquiry. On the
  last occasion, the hall porter had cheering news for him.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Wenham Gardner returned from the country an hour ago, sir," he
  announced. "I can send your name up now, if you wish to see her."</p>

  <p>Tavernake was conscious of a sense of immense relief. Of course, he had
  known that she had not really gone away for good, but all the same her
  absence, especially after the event of the night before last, was a little
  disquieting.</p>

  <p>"My name is Tavernake," he said. "I do not wish to intrude at such an
  hour, but if she could see me for a moment, I should be glad."</p>

  <p>He sat down and waited patiently. Soon a message came that Mr. Tavernake
  was to go up. He ascended in the lift and knocked at the door of her suite.
  Her maid opened it grudgingly. She scarcely took the pains to conceal her
  disapproval of this young man&mdash;so ordinary, so gauche. Why Madame should
  waste her time upon such a one, she could not imagine!</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Gardner will see you directly," she told him. "Madame is dressing
  now to go out for supper. She will be able to spare you only a few
  seconds."</p>

  <p>Tavernake remained alone in the luxurious little sitting-room for nearly
  ten minutes. Then the door of the inner room was opened and Elizabeth
  appeared. Tavernake, rising slowly to his feet, looked at her for a moment in
  reluctant but wondering admiration. She was wearing an ivory satin gown,
  without trimming or lace of any sort, a gown the fit of which seemed to him
  almost a miracle. Her only jewelry was a long rope of pearls and a small
  tiara. Tavernake had never been brought into close contact with any one quite
  like this.</p>

  <p>She was putting on her gloves as she entered and she gave him her left
  hand.</p>

  <p>"What an extraordinary person you are, Mr. Tavernake!" she exclaimed. "You
  really do seem to turn up at the most astonishing times."</p>

  <p>"I am very sorry to have intruded upon you to-night," he said. "As regards
  the last occasion, however, upon which I made an unexpected appearance, I
  make no apologies whatever," he added coolly.</p>

  <p>She laughed softly. She was looking full into his eyes and yet he could
  not tell whether she was angry with him or only amused.</p>

  <p>"You were by way of being a little melodramatic, were you not?" she
  remarked. "Still, you were very much in earnest, and one forgives a great
  deal to any one who is really in earnest. What do you want with me now? I am
  just going downstairs to supper."</p>

  <p>"It is a matter of business," Tavernake replied. "I have a friend who is a
  partner with me in the Marston Rise building speculation, and he is worried
  because there is some one else in the field wanting to buy the property, and
  the day after to-morrow is our last chance of paying over the money."</p>

  <p>She looked at him as though puzzled.</p>

  <p>"What money?"</p>

  <p>"The money which you agreed to lend me, or rather to invest in our
  building company," he reminded her.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"Of course! Why, I had forgotten all about it for the moment. You are
  going to give me ten per cent interest or something splendid, aren't you?
  Well, what about it? You don't want to take it away with you now, I
  suppose?"</p>

  <p>"No," he answered, "it isn't that. To be honest with you, I came to make
  sure that you hadn't changed your mind."</p>

  <p>"And why should I change my mind?"</p>

  <p>"You might be angry with me," he said, "for interfering in your concerns
  the night before last."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I am," she remarked, indifferently.</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to withdraw from your promise?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I really haven't thought much about it," she replied, carelessly.
  "By-the-bye, have you seen Beatrice lately?"</p>

  <p>"We agreed, I think," he reminded her, "that we would not talk about your
  sister."</p>

  <p>She looked at him over her shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I do not remember that I agreed to anything of the sort," she declared.
  "I think it was you who laid down the law about that. As a matter of fact, I
  think that your silence about her is very unkind. I suppose you have seen
  her?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I have seen her," Tavernake admitted.</p>

  <p>"She continues to be tragic," Elizabeth asked, "whenever my name is
  mentioned?"</p>

  <p>"I should not call it tragic," Tavernake answered, reluctantly. "One
  gathers, however, that something transpired between you before she left, of a
  serious nature."</p>

  <p>She looked at him earnestly.</p>

  <p>"Really," she said, "you are a strange, stolid young man. I wonder," she
  went on, smiling into his face, "are you in love with my sister?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake made no immediate response, only something flashed for a moment
  in his eyes which puzzled her.</p>

  <p>"Why do you look at me like that?" she demanded. "You are not angry with
  me for asking?"</p>

  <p>"No, I am not angry," he replied. "It isn't that. But you must
  know&mdash;you must see!"</p>

  <p>Then she indeed did see that he was laboring under a very great emotion.
  She leaned towards him, laughing softly.</p>

  <p>"Now you are really becoming interesting," she murmured. "Tell
  me&mdash;tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>"I don't know what love is!" Tavernake declared fiercely. "I don't know
  what it means to be in love!"</p>

  <p>Again she laughed in his face.</p>

  <p>"Are you so sure?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>She saw the veins stand out upon his temples, watched the passion which
  kept him at first tongue-tied.</p>

  <p>"Sure!" he muttered. "Who can be sure when you look like that!"</p>

  <p>He held out his arms. With a swift little backward movement she flitted
  away and leaned against the table.</p>

  <p>"What a brother-in-law you would make!" she laughed. "So steady, so
  respectable, alas! so serious! Dear Mr. Tavernake, I wish you joy. As a
  matter of fact, you and Beatrice are very well suited for one another."</p>

  <p>The telephone bell rang. She moved over and held the receiver to her ear.
  Her face changed. After the first few words to which she listened, it grew
  dark with anger.</p>

  <p>"You mean to say that Professor Franklin has not been in since
  lunch-time?" she exclaimed. "I left word particularly that I should require
  him to-night. Is Major Post there, then? No? Mr. Crease&mdash;no? Nor Mr.
  Faulkes? Not one of them! Very well, ring me up directly the professor comes
  in, or any of them."</p>

  <p>She replaced the receiver with a gesture of annoyance. Tavernake was
  astonished at the alteration in her expression. The smile had gone, and with
  its passing away lines had come under her eyes and about her mouth. Without a
  word to him she strode away into her bedroom. Tavernake was just wondering
  whether he should retire, when she came back.</p>

  <p>"Listen, Mr. Tavernake," she said, "how far away are your rooms?"</p>

  <p>"Down at Chelsea," he answered, "about two miles and a half."</p>

  <p>"Take a taxi and drive there," she commanded, "or stop. You will find my
  car outside. I will telephone down to say that you are to use it. Change into
  your evening clothes and come back for me. I want you to take me out to
  supper."</p>

  <p>He looked at her in amazement. She stamped her foot.</p>

  <p>"Don't stand there hesitating!" she ordered. "Do as I say! You don't
  expect I am going to help you to buy your wretched property if you refuse me
  the simplest of favors? Hurry, I say! Hurry!"</p>

  <p>"I am really very sorry," Tavernake interposed, "but I do not possess a
  dress suit. I would go, with pleasure, but I haven't got such a thing."</p>

  <p>She looked at him for a moment incredulously. Then she broke into a fit of
  uncontrollable laughter. She sat down upon the edge of a couch and wiped the
  tears from her eyes.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you strange, you wonderful person!" she exclaimed. "You want to buy
  an estate and you want to borrow twelve thousand pounds, and you know where
  Beatrice is and you won't tell me, and you are fully convinced, because you
  burst into a house through the wall, that you saved poor Pritchard from being
  poisoned, and you don't possess a dress suit! Never mind, as it happens it
  doesn't matter about the dress suit. You shall take me out as you are."</p>

  <p>Tavernake felt in his pockets and remembered that he had only thirty
  shillings with him.</p>

  <p>"Here, carry my purse," she said carelessly. "We are going downstairs to
  the smaller restaurant. I have been traveling since six o'clock, and I am
  starving."</p>

  <p>"But how about my clothes?" Tavernake objected. "Will they be all
  right?"</p>

  <p>"It doesn't matter where we are going," she answered. "You look very well
  as you are. Come and let me put your tie straight."</p>

  <p>She came close to him and her fingers played for a moment with his tie.
  She was very near to him and she laughed deliberately into his face.
  Tavernake held himself quite stiff and felt foolish. He also felt absurdly
  happy.</p>

  <p>"There," she remarked, when she had arranged it to her satisfaction, "you
  look all right now. I wonder," she added, half to herself, "what you do look
  like. Something Colonial and forceful, I think. Never mind, help me on with
  my cloak and come along. You are a most respectable-looking escort, and a
  very useful one."</p>

  <p>Although Tavernake was nominally the host, it was Elizabeth who selected
  the table and ordered the supper. There were very few other guests in the
  room, the majority being down in the larger restaurant, but among these few
  Tavernake noticed two of the girls from the chorus at the Atlas. Elizabeth
  had chosen a table from which she had a view of the door, and she took the
  seat facing it. From the first Tavernake felt certain that she was watching
  for some one.</p>

  <p>"Talk to me now, please, about this speculation," she insisted. "I should
  like to know all about it, and whether you are sure that I shall get ten per
  cent for my money."</p>

  <p>Tavernake was in no way reluctant. It was a safe topic for conversation,
  and one concerning which he had plenty to say. But after a time she stopped
  him.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "I have discovered at any rate one subject on which you
  can be fluent. Now I have had enough of building properties, please, and
  house building. I should like to hear a little about Beatrice."</p>

  <p>Tavernake was dumb.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish to talk about Beatrice," he declared, "until I understand
  the cause of this estrangement between you."</p>

  <p>Her eyes flashed angrily and her laugh sounded forced.</p>

  <p>"Not even talk of her! My dear friend," she protested, "you scarcely repay
  the confidence I am placing in you!"</p>

  <p>"You mean the money?"</p>

  <p>"Precisely," she continued. "I trust you, why I do not know&mdash;I
  suppose because I am something of a physiognomist&mdash;with twelve thousand
  pounds of my hard-earned savings. You refuse to trust me with even a few
  simple particulars about the life of my own sister. Come, I don't think that
  things are quite as they should be between us."</p>

  <p>"Do you know where I first met your sister?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>She shook her head pettishly.</p>

  <p>"How should I? You told me nothing."</p>

  <p>"She was staying in a boarding-house where I lived," Tavernake went on. "I
  think I told you that but nothing else. It was a cheap boarding-house but she
  had not enough money to pay for her meals. She was tired of life. She was in
  a desperate state altogether."</p>

  <p>"Are you trying to tell me, or rather trying not to tell me, that Beatrice
  was mad enough to think of committing suicide?" Elizabeth inquired.</p>

  <p>"She was in the frame of mind when such a step was possible," he answered,
  gravely. "You remember that night when I first saw you in the chemist's shop
  across the street? She had been very ill that evening, very ill indeed. You
  could see for yourself the effect meeting you had upon her."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth nodded, and crumbled a little piece of roll between her fingers.
  Then she leaned over the table towards Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"She seemed terrified, didn't she? She hurried you away&mdash;she seemed
  afraid."</p>

  <p>"It was very noticeable," he admitted. "She was terrified. She dragged me
  out of the place. A few minutes later she fainted in the cab."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth smiled.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice was always over-sensitive," she remarked. "Any sudden shock
  unnerved her altogether. Are you terrified of me, too, Mr. Tavernake?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered, frankly. "Sometimes I think that I am."</p>

  <p>She laughed softly.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>He looked into her eyes and he felt abject. How was it possible to sit
  within a few feet of her and remain sane!</p>

  <p>"You are so wonderful," he said, in a low tone, "so different from any one
  else in the world!"</p>

  <p>"You are glad that you met me, then&mdash;that you are here?" she
  asked.</p>

  <p>He raised his eyes once more.</p>

  <p>"I don't know," he answered simply. "If I really believed&mdash;if you
  were always kind like this&mdash;but, you see, you make two men of me. When I
  am with you I am a fool, your fool, to do as you will with. When I am away,
  some glimmerings of common sense come back, and I know."</p>

  <p>"You know what?" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"That you are not honest," he added.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake!" she exclaimed, lifting her head a little.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don t mean dishonest in the ordinary way!" he protested, eagerly.
  "What I mean is that you look things which you don't feel, that you are
  willing for any one who can't help admiring you very much to believe for a
  moment that you, too, feel more kindly than you really do. This is so
  clumsy," he broke off, despairingly, "but you understand what I mean!"</p>

  <p>"You have an adorable way of making yourself understood," she laughed.
  "Come, do let us talk sense for a minute or two. You say that when you are
  with me you are my slave. Then why is it that you do not bring Beatrice here
  when I beg you to?"</p>

  <p>"I am your slave," he answered, "in everything that has to do with myself
  and my own actions. In that other matter it is for your sister to
  decide."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"Well," she said, "I suppose I shall be able to endure life without her.
  At any rate, we will talk of something else. Tell me, are you not curious to
  know why I insisted upon bringing you here?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," he admitted, "I am."</p>

  <p>"Spoken with your usual candor, my dear Briton!" she exclaimed. "Well, I
  will gratify your curiosity. This, as you see, is not a popular supping
  place. A few people come in&mdash;mostly those who for some reason or other
  don't feel smart enough for the big restaurants. The people from the theatres
  come in here who have not time to change their clothes. As you perceive; the
  place has a distinctly Bohemian flavor."</p>

  <p>Tavernake looked around.</p>

  <p>"They seem to come in all sorts of clothes," he remarked. "I am glad."</p>

  <p>"There is a man now in London," Elizabeth continued, "whom I am just as
  anxious to see as I am to find my sister. I believe that this is the most
  likely place to find him. That is why I have come. My father was to have been
  here to take me, but as you heard he has gone out somewhere and not returned.
  None of my other friends were available. You happened to come in just in
  time."</p>

  <p>"And this man whom you want to see," Tavernake asked, "is he here?"</p>

  <p>"Not yet," she answered.</p>

  <p>There were, indeed, only a few scattered groups in the place, and most of
  these were obviously theatrical. But even at that moment a man came in alone
  through the circular doors, and stood just inside, looking around him. He was
  a man of medium height, thin, and of undistinguished appearance. His hair was
  light-colored and plastered a little in front over his forehead. His face was
  thin and he walked with a slight stoop. Something about his clothes and his
  manner of wearing them stamped him as an American. Tavernake glanced at his
  companion, wondering whether this, perhaps, might not be the person for whom
  she was watching. His first glance was careless enough, then he felt his
  heart thump against his ribs. A tragedy had come into the room! The woman at
  his side sat as though turned to stone. There was a look in her face as of
  one who sees Death. The small patch of rouge, invisible before, was now a
  staring daub of color in an oasis of ashen white. Her eyes were as hard as
  stones; her lips were twitching as though, indeed, she had been stricken with
  some disease. No longer was he sitting with this most beautiful lady at whose
  coming all heads were turned in admiration. It was as though an image of
  Death sat there, a frozen presentment of horror itself!</p>

  <h2>XXIII. ON AN ERRAND OF CHIVALRY</h2>

  <p class="first">The seconds passed; the woman beside him showed no sign of
  life. Tavernake felt a fear run cold in his blood, such as in all his days he
  had never known. This, indeed, was something belonging to a world of which he
  knew nothing. What was it? Illness? Pain? Surprise? There was only his
  instinct to tell him. It was terror, the terror of one who looks beyond the
  grave.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Gardner!" he exclaimed. "Elizabeth!"</p>

  <p>The sound of his voice seemed to break the spell. A half-choked sob came
  through her teeth; the struggle for composure commenced.</p>

  <p>"I am ill," she murmured. "Give me my glass. Give it to me."</p>

  <p>Her fingers were feeling for it but it seemed as though she dared not move
  her head. He filled it with wine and placed the stem in her hand. Even then
  she spilled some of it upon the tablecloth. As she raised it to her lips, the
  man who stood still upon the threshold of the restaurant looked into her
  face. Slowly, as though his quest were over, he came down the room.</p>

  <p>"Go away," she said to Tavernake. "Go away, please. He is coming to speak
  to me. I want to be alone with him."</p>

  <p>Strangely enough, at that moment Tavernake saw nothing out of the common
  in her request. He rose at once, without any formal leave-taking, and made
  his way toward the other end of the cafe. As he turned the corner towards the
  smoking-room, he glanced once behind. The man had approached quite close to
  Elizabeth; he was standing before her table, they seemed to be exchanging
  greetings.</p>

  <p>Tavernake went on into the smoking-room and threw himself into an
  easy-chair. He had been there perhaps for ten minutes when Pritchard entered.
  Certainly it was a night of surprises! Even Pritchard, cool, deliberate, slow
  in his movements and speech, seemed temporarily flurried. He came into the
  room walking quickly. As the door swung back, he turned round as though to
  assure himself that he was not being followed. He did not at first see
  Tavernake. He sat on the arm of an easy-chair, his hands in his pockets, his
  eternal cigar in the corner of his mouth, his eyes fixed upon the doors
  through which he had issued. Without a doubt, something had disturbed him. He
  had the look of a man who had received a blow, a surprise of some sort over
  which he was still ruminating. Then he glanced around the room and saw
  Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"Hullo, young man!" he exclaimed. "So this is the way you follow my
  advice!"</p>

  <p>"I never promised to follow it," Tavernake reminded him.</p>

  <p>Pritchard wheeled an easy-chair across the room and called to the
  waiter.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "you shall stand me a drink. Two whiskies and sodas, Tim.
  And now, Mr. Leonard Tavernake, you are going to answer me a question."</p>

  <p>"Am I?" Tavernake muttered.</p>

  <p>"You came down in the lift with Mrs. Wenham Gardner half an hour ago, you
  went into the restaurant and ordered supper. She is there still and you are
  here. Have you quarreled?"</p>

  <p>"No, we did not quarrel," Tavernake answered. "She explained that she was
  supping in the cafe only for the sake of meeting one man. She wanted an
  escort. I filled that post until the man came."</p>

  <p>"He is there now?" Pritchard asked.</p>

  <p>"He is there now," Tavernake assented.</p>

  <p>Pritchard withdrew the cigar from his mouth and watched it for a
  moment.</p>

  <p>"Say, Tavernake," he went on, "is that man who is now having supper with
  Mrs. Wenham Gardner the man whom she expected?"</p>

  <p>"I imagine so," Tavernake replied.</p>

  <p>"Didn't she seem in any way scared or disturbed when he first turned
  up?"</p>

  <p>"She looked as I have seen no one else on earth look before," Tavernake
  admitted. "She seemed simply terrified to death. I do not know why&mdash;she
  didn't explain&mdash;but that is how she looked."</p>

  <p>"Yet she sent you away!"</p>

  <p>"She sent me away. She didn't care what became of me. She was watching the
  door all the time before he came. Who is he, Pritchard?"</p>

  <p>"That sounds a simple question," Pritchard answered gravely, "but it means
  a good deal. There's mischief afoot to-night, Tavernake."</p>

  <p>"You seem to thrive on it," Tavernake retorted, drily. "Any more
  bunkum?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard smiled.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "you're a sensible chap. Take these things for what
  they're worth. Believe me when I tell you now that there is a great deal more
  in the coming of this man than Mrs. Wenham Gardner ever bargained for."</p>

  <p>"I wish you'd tell me who he is," Tavernake begged. "All this mystery
  about Beatrice and her sister, and that lazy old hulk of a father, is most
  irritating."</p>

  <p>Pritchard nodded sympathetically.</p>

  <p>"You'll have to put up with it a little longer, I'm afraid, my young
  friend," he declared. "You've done me a good turn; I'll do you one. I'll give
  you some good advice. Keep out of this place so long as the old man and his
  daughter are hanging out here. The girl 's clever&mdash;oh, she's as clever
  as they make them&mdash;but she's gone wrong from the start. They ain't your
  sort, Tavernake. You don't fit in anywhere. Take my advice and hook it
  altogether."</p>

  <p>Tavernake shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I can't do that just now," he said. "Good-night! I'm off for the present,
  at any rate."</p>

  <p>Pritchard, too, rose to his feet. He passed his arm through
  Tavernake's.</p>

  <p>"Young man," he remarked, "there are not many in this country whom I can
  trust. You're one of them. There's a sort of solidity about you that I rather
  admire. You are not likely to break out and do silly things. Do you care for
  adventures?"</p>

  <p>"I detest them," Tavernake answered, "especially the sort I tumbled into
  the other night."</p>

  <p>Pritchard laughed softly. They had left the room now and were walking
  along the open space at the end of the restaurant, leading to the main
  exit.</p>

  <p>"That's the difference between us," he declared thoughtfully. "Now
  adventures to me are the salt of my life. I hang about here and watch these
  few respectable-looking men and women, and there doesn't seem to be much in
  it to an outsider, but, gee whiz! there's sometimes things underneath which
  you fellows don't tumble to. A man asks another in there to have a drink.
  They make a cheerful appointment to meet for lunch, to motor to Brighton. It
  all sounds so harmless, and yet there are the seeds of a conspiracy already
  sown. They hate me here, but they know very well that wherever they went I
  should be around. I suppose some day they'll get rid of me."</p>

  <p>"More bunkum!" Tavernake muttered.</p>

  <p>They stood in front of the door and passed through into the courtyard. On
  their right, the interior of the smaller restaurant was shielded from view by
  a lattice-work, covered with flowers and shrubs. Pritchard came to a
  standstill at a certain point, and stooping down looked through. He remained
  there without moving for what seemed to Tavernake an extraordinarily long
  time. When he stood up again, there was a distinct change in his face. He was
  looking more serious than Tavernake had ever seen him. But for the
  improbability of the thing, Tavernake would have thought that he had turned
  pale.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "you've got to see me through this. You 've a
  sort of fancy for Mrs. Wenham Gardner, I know. To-night you shall be on her
  side."</p>

  <p>"I don't want any more mysteries," Tavernake protested. "I'd rather go
  home."</p>

  <p>"It can't be done," Pritchard declared, taking his arm once more. "You've
  got to see me through this. Come up to my rooms for a minute."</p>

  <p>They entered the Court and ascended to the eighth floor. Pritchard turned
  on the lights in his room, a plainly furnished and somewhat bare apartment.
  From a cupboard he took out a pair of rubber-soled shoes and threw them to
  Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"Put those on," he directed.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>"You are going to help me," Pritchard answered. "Take my word for it,
  Tavernake, it's all right. I could tackle the job alone, but I'd rather not.
  Now drink this whiskey and soda and light a cigarette. I shall be ready in
  five minutes."</p>

  <p>"But where are we going?" Tavernake demanded.</p>

  <p>"You are going," Pritchard replied, "on an errand of chivalry. You are
  going to become once more a rescuer of woman in distress. You are going to
  save the life of your beautiful friend Elizabeth."</p>

  <h2>XXIV. CLOSE TO TRAGEDY</h2>

  <p class="first">The actual words of greeting which passed between Elizabeth
  and the man whose advent had caused her so much emotion were unimpressive.
  The newcomer, with the tips of his fingers resting upon the tablecloth,
  leaned slightly towards her. At close quarters, he was even more unattractive
  than when Tavernake had first seen him. He was faultily shaped; there was
  something a little decadent about his deep-set eyes and receding forehead.
  Neither was his expression prepossessing. He looked at her as a man looks
  upon the thing he hates.</p>

  <p>"So, Elizabeth," he said, "this pleasure has come at last!"</p>

  <p>"I heard that you were back in England," she replied. "Pray sit down."</p>

  <p>Even then her eyes never left his. All the time they seemed to be fiercely
  questioning, seeking for something in his features which eluded them. It was
  terrible to see the change which the last few minutes had wrought in her. Her
  smooth, girlish face had lost its comeliness. Her eyes, always a little
  narrow, seemed to have receded. It was such a change, this, as comes to a
  brave man who, in the prime of life, feels fear for the first time.</p>

  <p>"I am glad to find you at supper," he declared, taking up the menu. "I am
  hungry. You can bring me some grilled cutlets at once," he added to the
  waiter who stood by his side, "and some brandy. Nothing else."</p>

  <p>The waiter bowed and hurried off. The woman played with her fan but her
  fingers were shaking.</p>

  <p>"I fear," he remarked, "that my coming is rather a shock to you. I am
  sorry to see you looking so distressed."</p>

  <p>"It is not that," she answered with some show of courage. "You know me too
  well to believe me capable of seeking a meeting which I feared. It is the
  strange thing which has happened to you during these last few
  months&mdash;this last year. Do you know&mdash;has any one told
  you&mdash;that you seem to have become even more like&mdash;the image
  of&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He nodded understandingly.</p>

  <p>"Of poor Wenham! Many people have told me that. Of course, you know that
  we were always appallingly alike, and they always said that we should become
  more so in middle-age. After all, there is only a year between us. We might
  have been twins."</p>

  <p>"It is the most terrible thing in likenesses I have ever seen," the woman
  continued slowly. "When you entered the room a few seconds ago, it seemed to
  me that a miracle had happened. It seemed to me that the dead had come to
  life."</p>

  <p>"It must have been a shock," the man murmured, with his eyes upon the
  tablecloth.</p>

  <p>"It was," she agreed, hoarsely. "Can't you see it in my face? I do not
  always look like a woman of forty. Can't you see the gray shadows that are
  there? You see, I admit it frankly. I was terrified&mdash;I am
  terrified!"</p>

  <p>"And why?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Why?" she repeated, looking at him wonderingly. "Doesn't it seem to you a
  terrible thing to think of the dead coming back to life?"</p>

  <p>He tapped lightly upon the tablecloth for a minute with the fingers of one
  hand. Then he looked at her again.</p>

  <p>"It depends," he said, "upon the manner of their death."</p>

  <p>An executioner of the Middle Ages could not have played with his victim
  more skillfully. The woman was shivering now, preserving some outward
  appearance of calm only by the most fierce and unnatural effort.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by that, Jerry?" she asked. "I was not even
  with&mdash;Wenham, when he was lost. You know all about it, I
  suppose,&mdash;how it happened?"</p>

  <p>The man nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"I have heard many stories," he admitted. "Before we leave the subject for
  ever, I should like to hear it from you, from your own lips."</p>

  <p>There was a bottle of champagne upon the table, ordered at the
  commencement of the meal. She touched her glass; the waiter filled it. She
  raised it to her lips and set it down empty. Her fingers were clutching the
  tablecloth.</p>

  <p>"You ask me a hard thing, Jerry," she said. "It is not easy to talk of
  anything so painful. From the moment we left New York, Wenham was strange. He
  drank a good deal upon the steamer. He used to talk sometimes in the most
  wild way. We came to London. He had an attack of delirium tremens. I nursed
  him through it and took him into the country, down into Cornwall. We took a
  small cottage on the outskirts of a fishing village&mdash;St. Catherine's,
  the place was called. There we lived quietly for a time. Sometimes he was
  better, sometimes worse. The doctor in the village was very kind and came
  often to see him. He brought a friend from the neighboring town and they
  agreed that with complete rest Wenham would soon be better. All the time my
  life was a miserable one. He was not fit to be alone and yet he was a
  terrible companion. I did my best. I was with him half of every day,
  sometimes longer. I was with him till my own health began to suffer. At last
  I could stand the solitude no longer. I sent for my father. He came and lived
  with us."</p>

  <p>"The professor," her listener murmured.</p>

  <p>She nodded.</p>

  <p>"It was a little better then for me," she went on, "except that poor
  Wenham seemed to take such a dislike to my father. However, he hated every
  one in turn, even the doctors, who always did their best for him. One day, I
  admit, I lost my temper. We quarreled; I could not help it&mdash;life was
  becoming insupportable. He rushed out of the house&mdash;it was about three
  o'clock in the afternoon. I have never seen him since."</p>

  <p>The man was looking at her, looking at her closely although he was
  blinking all the time.</p>

  <p>"What do you think became of him?" he asked. "What do people think?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"The only thing he cared to do was swim," she said. "His clothes and hat
  were found down in the little cove near where we had a tent."</p>

  <p>"You think, then, that he was drowned?" the man asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded. Speech seemed to be becoming too painful.</p>

  <p>"Drowning," her companion continued, helping himself to brandy, "is not a
  pleasant death. Once I was nearly drowned myself. One struggles for a short
  time and one thinks&mdash;yes, one thinks!" he added.</p>

  <p>He raised his glass to his lips and set it down.</p>

  <p>"It is an easy death, though," he went on, "quite an easy death. By the
  way, were those clothes that were found of poor Wenham's identified as the
  clothes he wore when he left the house?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"One could not say for certain," she answered. "I never noticed how he was
  dressed. He wore nearly always the same sort of things, but he had an endless
  variety."</p>

  <p>"And this was seven months ago&mdash;seven months."</p>

  <p>She assented.</p>

  <p>"Poor Wenham," he murmured. "I suppose he is dead. What are you going to
  do, Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>"I do not know," she replied. "Soon I must go to the lawyers and ask for
  advice. I have very little more money left. I have written several times to
  New York to you, to his friends, but I have had no answer. After all, Jerry,
  I am his wife. No one liked my marrying him, but I am his wife. I have a
  right to a share of his property if he is dead. If he has deserted me, surely
  I shall be allowed something. I do not even know how rich he was."</p>

  <p>The man at her side smiled.</p>

  <p>"Much better off than I ever was," he declared. "But, Elizabeth!"</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"There were rumors that, before you left New York, Wenham converted very
  large sums of money into letters of credit and bonds, very large sums
  indeed." She shook her head. "He had a letter of credit for about a thousand
  pounds, I think," she said. "There is very little left of the money he had
  with him."</p>

  <p>"And you find living here expensive, I dare say?"</p>

  <p>"Very expensive indeed," she agreed, with a sigh. "I have been looking
  forward to seeing you, Jerry. I thought, perhaps, for the sake of old times
  you might advise me."</p>

  <p>"Of old times," he repeated to himself softly. "Elizabeth, do you think of
  them sometimes?"</p>

  <p>She was becoming more herself. This was a game she was used to playing. Of
  old times, indeed! It seemed only yesterday that these two brothers, who had
  the reputation in those days of being the richest young men in New York, were
  both at her feet. So far, she had scarcely been fortunate. There was still a
  chance, however. She looked up. It seemed to her that he was losing his
  composure. Yes, there was something of the old gleam in his eyes! Once he had
  been madly enough in love with her. It ought not to be impossible!</p>

  <p>"Jerry," she said, "I have told you these things. It has been so very,
  very painful for me. Won't you try now and be kind? Remember that I am all
  alone and it is all very difficult for me. I have been looking forward to
  your coming. I have thought so often of those times we spent together in New
  York. Won't you be my friend again? Won't you help me through these dark
  days?"</p>

  <p>Her hand touched his. For a moment he snatched his away as though stung.
  Then he caught her fingers in his and held them as though in a vice. She
  smiled, the smile of conscious power. The flush of beauty was streaming once
  more into her face. Poor fellow, he was still in love, then! The fingers
  which had closed upon hers were burning. What a pity that he was not a little
  more presentable!</p>

  <p>"Yes," he muttered, "we must be friends, Elizabeth. Wenham had all the
  luck at first. Perhaps it's going to be my turn now, eh?"</p>

  <p>He bent towards her. She laughed into his face for a moment and then was
  once more suddenly colorless, the smile frozen upon her lips. She began to
  shiver.</p>

  <p>"What is it?" he asked. "What is it, Elizabeth?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing," she faltered, "only I wish&mdash;I do wish that you were not so
  much like Wenham. Sometimes a trick of your voice, the way you hold your
  head&mdash;it terrifies me!"</p>

  <p>He laughed oddly.</p>

  <p>"You must get used to that, Elizabeth," he declared. "I can't help being
  like him, you know. We were great friends always until you came. I wonder why
  you preferred Wenham."</p>

  <p>"Don't ask me&mdash;please don't ask me that," she begged. "Really, I
  think he happened to be there just at the moment I felt like making a clean
  sweep of everything, of leaving New York and every one and starting life
  again, and I thought Wenham meant it. I thought I should be able to keep him
  from drinking and to help him start a new life altogether over here or on the
  Continent."</p>

  <p>"Poor little woman," he said, "you have been disappointed, I am
  afraid."</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"I am only human, you know," she went on. "Every one told me that Wenham
  was a millionaire, too. See how much I have benefited by it. I am almost
  penniless, I do not know whether he is dead or alive, I do not know what to
  do to get some money. Was Wenham very rich, Jerry?"</p>

  <p>The man laughed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, he was very rich indeed!" he assured her. "It is terrible that you
  should be left like this. We will talk about it together presently, you and
  I. In the meantime, you must let me be your banker."</p>

  <p>"Dear Jerry," she whispered, "you were always generous."</p>

  <p>"You have not spoken of the little prude&mdash;dear Miss Beatrice," he
  reminded her suddenly.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth sighed.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice was a great trial from the first," she declared. "You know how
  she disliked you both&mdash;she was scarcely even civil to Wenham, and she
  would never have come to Europe with us if father hadn't insisted upon it. We
  took her down to Cornwall with us and there she became absolutely
  insupportable. She was always interfering between Wenham and me and imagining
  the most absurd things. One day she left us without a word of warning. I have
  never seen her since."</p>

  <p>The man stared gloomily into his plate.</p>

  <p>"She was a queer little thing," he muttered. "She was good, and she seemed
  to like being good."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth laughed, not quite pleasantly.</p>

  <p>"You speak as though the rest of us," she remarked, "were qualified to
  take orders in wickedness."</p>

  <p>He helped himself to more brandy.</p>

  <p>"Think back," he said. "Think of those days in New York, the life we led,
  the wild things we did week after week, month after month, the same eternal
  round of turning night into day, of struggling everywhere to find new
  pleasures, pulling vice to pieces like children trying to find the inside of
  their playthings."</p>

  <p>"I don't like your mood in the least," she interrupted.</p>

  <p>He drummed for a moment upon the tablecloth with his fingers.</p>

  <p>"We were talking of Beatrice. You don't even know where she is now,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"I have no idea," Elizabeth declared.</p>

  <p>"She was with you for long in Cornwall?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth toyed with her wineglass for a minute.</p>

  <p>"She was there about a month," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"And she didn't approve of the way you and Wenham behaved?" he
  demanded.</p>

  <p>"Apparently not. She left us, anyway. She didn't understand Wenham in the
  least. I shouldn't be surprised," Elizabeth went on, "to hear that she was a
  hospital nurse, or learning typing, or a clerk in an office. She was a young
  woman of gloomy ideas, although she was my sister."</p>

  <p>He came a little closer towards her.</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth," he said, "we will not talk any more about Beatrice. We will
  not talk any more about anything except our two selves."</p>

  <p>"Are you really glad to see me again, Jerry?" she asked softly.</p>

  <p>"You must know it, dear," he whispered. "You must know that I loved you
  always, that I adored you. Oh, you knew it! Don't tell me you didn't. You
  knew it, Elizabeth!"</p>

  <p>She looked down at the tablecloth.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I knew it," she admitted, softly.</p>

  <p>"Can't you guess what it is to me to see you again like this?" he
  continued.</p>

  <p>She sighed.</p>

  <p>"It is something for me, too, to feel that I have a friend close at
  hand."</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "they are turning out the lights here. You want to know
  about Wenham's property. Let me come upstairs with you for a little time and
  I will tell you as much as I can from memory."</p>

  <p>He paid the bill, helped her on with her cloak. His fingers seemed like
  burning spots upon her flesh. They went up in the lift. In the corridors he
  drew her to him and she began to tremble.</p>

  <p>"What is there strange about you, Jerry?" she faltered, looking into his
  face. "You terrify me!"</p>

  <p>"You are glad to see me? Say you are glad to see me?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am glad," she whispered.</p>

  <p>Outside the door of her rooms, she hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," she suggested, faintly,&mdash;"wouldn't it be better if you
  came to-morrow morning?"</p>

  <p>Once more his fingers touched her and again that extraordinary sense of
  fear seemed to turn her blood cold.</p>

  <p>"No," he replied, "I have been put off long enough! You must let me in,
  you must talk with me for half an hour. I will go then, I promise. Half an
  hour! Elizabeth, haven't I waited an eternity for it?"</p>

  <p>He took the keys from her fingers and opened the door, closing it again
  behind them. She led the way into the sitting-room. The whole place was in
  darkness but she turned on the electric light. The cloak slipped from her
  shoulders. He took her hands and looked at her.</p>

  <p>"Jerry," she whispered, "you mustn't look at me like that. You terrify me!
  Let me go!"</p>

  <p>She wrenched herself free with an effort. She stepped back to the corner
  of the room, as far as she could get from him. Her heart was beating
  fiercely. Somehow or other, neither of these two young men, over whose lives
  she had certainly brought to bear a very wonderful influence, had ever before
  stirred her pulses like this. What was it, she wondered? What was the meaning
  of it? Why didn't he speak? He did nothing but look, and there were
  unutterable things in his eyes. Was he angry with her because she had married
  Wenham, or was he blaming her because Wenham had gone? There was passion in
  his face, but such passion! Desire, perhaps, but what else? She caught up a
  telegram which lay upon her writing desk, and tore it open. It was an escape
  for a moment. She read the words, stared, and read them aloud incredulously.
  It was from her father.</p>

  <p>"Jerry Gardner sailed for New York to-day."</p>

  <p>She looked up at the man, and as she looked her face grew gray and the
  thin sheet went quivering from her lifeless fingers to the floor. Then he
  began to laugh, and she knew.</p>

  <p>"Wenham!" she shrieked. "Wenham!"</p>

  <p>There was murder in his face, murder almost in his laugh.</p>

  <p>"Your loving husband!" he answered.</p>

  <p>She sprang for the door but even as she moved she heard the click of the
  bolt shot back. He touched the electric switch and the room was suddenly in
  darkness. She heard him coming towards her, she felt his hot breath upon her
  cheek.</p>

  <p>"My loving wife!" he whispered. "At last!"</p>

  <h2>XXV. THE MADMAN TALKS</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake turned on the light. Pritchard, with a quick leap
  forward, seized Wenham around the waist and dragged him away. Elizabeth had
  fainted; she lay upon the floor, her face the color of marble.</p>

  <p>"Get some water and throw over her," Pritchard ordered.</p>

  <p>Tavernake obeyed. He threw open the window and let in a current of air. In
  a moment or two the woman stirred and raised her head.</p>

  <p>"Look after her for a minute," Pritchard said. "I Il lock this fierce
  little person up in the bathroom."</p>

  <p>Pritchard carried his prisoner out. Tavernake leaned over the woman who
  was slowly coming back to consciousness.</p>

  <p>"Tell me about it," she asked, hoarsely. "Where is he?"</p>

  <p>"Locked up in the bathroom," Tavernake answered. "Pritchard is taking care
  of him. He won't be able to get out."</p>

  <p>"You know who it was?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"I do not," Tavernake replied. "It isn't my business. I'm only here
  because Pritchard begged me to come. He thought he might want help."</p>

  <p>She held his fingers tightly.</p>

  <p>"Where were you?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"In the bathroom when you arrived. Then he bolted the door behind and we
  had to come round through your bedroom."</p>

  <p>"How did Pritchard find out?"</p>

  <p>"I know nothing about it," Tavernake replied. "I only know that he peered
  through the latticework and saw you sitting there at supper."</p>

  <p>She smiled weakly.</p>

  <p>"It must have been rather a shock to him," she said. "He has been
  convinced for the last six months that I murdered Wenham, or got rid of him
  by some means or other. Help me up."</p>

  <p>She staggered to her feet. Tavernake assisted her to an easy chair. Then
  Pritchard came in.</p>

  <p>"He is quite safe," he announced, "sitting on the edge of the bath playing
  with a doll."</p>

  <p>She shivered.</p>

  <p>"What is he doing with it?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Showing me exactly, with a shawl pin, where he meant to have stabbed
  you," Pritchard answered, drily. "Now, my dear lady," he continued, "it seems
  to me that I have done you one injustice, at any rate. I certainly thought
  you'd helped to relieve the world of that young person. Where did he come
  from? Perhaps you can tell me that."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I may as well," she said. "Listen, you have seen what he was
  like to-night, but you don't know what it was to live with him. It was
  Hell!"&mdash;she sobbed&mdash;"absolute Hell! He drank, he took drugs, it was
  all his servant could do to force him even to make his toilet. It was
  impossible. It was crushing the life out of me."</p>

  <p>"Go on," Pritchard directed.</p>

  <p>"There isn't much more to tell," she continued. "I found an old
  farmhouse&mdash;the loneliest spot in Cornwall. We moved there and I left
  him&mdash;with Mathers. I promised Mathers that he should have twenty pounds
  a week for every week he kept his master away from me. He has kept him away
  for seven months."</p>

  <p>"What about that story of yours&mdash;about his having gone in swimming?"
  Pritchard asked.</p>

  <p>"I wanted people to believe that he was dead," she declared defiantly. "I
  was afraid that if you or his relations found him, I should have to live with
  him or give up the money."</p>

  <p>Pritchard nodded.</p>

  <p>"And to-night you thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I thought he was his brother Jerry," she went on. "The likeness was
  always amazing, you know that. I was told that Jerry was in town. I felt
  nervous, somehow, and wired to Mathers. I had his reply only last night. He
  wired that Wenham was quite safe and contented, not even restless."</p>

  <p>"That telegram was sent by Wenham himself," Pritchard remarked. "I think
  you had better hear what he has to say."</p>

  <p>She shrank back.</p>

  <p>"No. I couldn't bear the sight of him again!"</p>

  <p>"I think you had better," Pritchard insisted. "I can assure you that he is
  quite harmless. I will guarantee that."</p>

  <p>He left the room. Soon he returned, his arm locked in the arm of Wenham
  Gardner. The latter had the look of a spoilt child who is in disgrace. He sat
  sullenly upon a chair and glared at every one. Then he produced a small
  crumpled doll, with a thread of black cotton around its neck, and began
  swinging it in front of him, laughing at Elizabeth all the time.</p>

  <p>"Tell us," Pritchard asked, "what has become of Mathers?"</p>

  <p>He stopped swinging the doll, shivered for a moment, and then laughed.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind," he declared. "I guess I don't mind telling. You see,
  whatever I was when I did it, I am mad now&mdash;quite mad. My friend
  Pritchard here says I am mad. I must have been mad or I shouldn't have tried
  to hurt that dear beautiful lady over there."</p>

  <p>He leered at Elizabeth, who shrank back.</p>

  <p>"She ran away from me some time ago," he went on, "sick to death of me she
  was. She thought she'd got all my money. She hadn't. There's plenty more,
  plenty more. She ran away and left me with Mathers. She was paying him so
  much a week to keep me quiet, not to let me go anywhere where I should talk,
  to keep me away from her so that she could live up here and see all her
  friends and spend my money. And at first I didn't mind, and then I did mind,
  and I got angry with Mathers, and Mathers wouldn't let me come away, and
  three nights ago I killed Mathers."</p>

  <p>There was a little thrill of horror. He looked from one to the other. By
  degrees their fear seemed to become communicated to him.</p>

  <p>"What do you mean by looking like that, all of you?" he exclaimed. "What
  does it matter? He was only my man-servant. I am Wenham Gardner, millionaire.
  No one will put me in prison for that. Besides, he shouldn't have tried to
  keep me away from my wife. Anyway, it don't matter. I am quite mad. Mad
  people can do what they like. They have to stop in an asylum for six months,
  and then they're quite cured and they start again. I don't mind being mad for
  six months. Elizabeth," he whined, "come and be mad, too. You haven't been
  kind to me. There's plenty more money&mdash;plenty more. Come back for a
  little time and I'll show you."</p>

  <p>"How did you kill Mathers?" Pritchard asked.</p>

  <p>"I stabbed him when he was stooping down," Wenham Gardner explained. "You
  see, when I left college my father thought it would be good for me to do
  something. I dare say it would have been but I didn't want to. I studied
  surgery for six months. The only thing I remember was just where to kill a
  man behind the left shoulder. I remembered that. Mathers was a fat man, and
  he stooped so that his coat almost burst. I just leaned over, picked out the
  exact spot, and he crumpled all up. I expect," he went on, "you'll find him
  there still. No one comes near the place for days and days. Mathers used to
  leave me locked up and do all the shopping himself. I expect he's lying there
  now. Some one ought to go and see."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was sobbing quietly to herself. Tavernake felt the perspiration
  break out upon his forehead. There was something appalling in the way this
  young man talked.</p>

  <p>"I don't understand why you all look so serious," he continued. "No one is
  going to hurt me for this. I am quite mad now. You see, I am playing with
  this doll. Sane men don't play with dolls. I hope they'll try me in New York,
  though. I am well-known in New York. I know all the lawyers and the jurymen.
  Oh, they're up to all sorts of tricks in New York! Say, you don't suppose
  they'll try me over here?" he broke off suddenly, turning to Pritchard. "I
  shouldn't feel so much at home here."</p>

  <p>"Take him away," Elizabeth begged. "Take him away." Pritchard nodded.</p>

  <p>"I thought you'd better hear," he said. "I am going to take him away now.
  I shall send a telegram to the police-station at St. Catherine's. They had
  better go up and see what's happened."</p>

  <p>Pritchard took his captive once more by the arm. The young man struggled
  violently.</p>

  <p>"I don't like you, Pritchard," he shrieked. "I don't want to go with you.
  I want to stay with Elizabeth. I am not really afraid of her. She'd like to
  kill me, I know, but she's too clever&mdash;oh, she's too clever! I'd like to
  stay with her."</p>

  <p>Pritchard led him away.</p>

  <p>"We'll see about it later on," he said. "You'd better come with me just
  now."</p>

  <p>The door closed behind them. Tavernake staggered up.</p>

  <p>"I must go," he declared. "I must go, too."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth was sobbing quietly to herself. She seemed scarcely to hear him.
  On the threshold Tavernake turned back.</p>

  <p>"That money," he asked, "the money you were going to lend me&mdash;was
  that his?"</p>

  <p>She looked up and nodded. Tavernake went slowly out.</p>

  <h2>XXVI. A CRISIS</h2>

  <p class="first">Pritchard was the first visitor who had ever found his way
  into Tavernake's lodgings. It was barely eight o'clock on the same morning.
  Tavernake, hollow-eyed and bewildered, sat up upon the sofa and gazed across
  the room.</p>

  <p>"Pritchard!" he exclaimed. "Why, what do you want?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard laid his hat and gloves upon the table. Already his first swift
  glance had taken in the details of the little apartment. The overcoat and hat
  which Tavernake had worn the night before lay by his side. The table was
  still arranged for some meal of the previous day. Apart from these things, a
  single glance assured him that Tavernake had not been to bed.</p>

  <p>Pritchard drew up an easy-chair and seated himself deliberately.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he announced, "I have come to the conclusion that you
  need some more advice."</p>

  <p>Tavernake rose to his feet. His own reflection in the looking-glass
  startled him. His hair was crumpled, his tie undone, the marks of his night
  of agony were all too apparent. He felt himself at a disadvantage.</p>

  <p>"How did you find me out?" he asked. "I never gave you my address."</p>

  <p>Pritchard smiled.</p>

  <p>"Even in this country, with a little help," he said, "those things are
  easy enough. I made up my mind that this morning would be to some extent a
  crisis with you. You know, Tavernake, I am not a man who says much, but you
  are the right sort. You've been in with me twice when I should have missed
  you if you hadn't been there."</p>

  <p>Tavernake seemed to have lost the power of speech. He had relapsed again
  into his place upon the sofa. He simply waited.</p>

  <p>"How in the name of mischief," Pritchard continued, impressively, "you
  came to be mixed up in the lives of this amiable trio, I cannot imagine! I am
  not saying a word against Miss Beatrice, mind. All that surprises me is that
  you and she should ever have come together, or, having come together, that
  you should ever have exchanged a word. You see, I am here to speak plain
  truths. You are, I take it, a good sample of the hard, stubborn, middle-class
  Briton. These three people of whom I have spoken, belong&mdash;Miss Beatrice,
  perhaps, by force of circumstances&mdash;but still they do belong to the land
  of Bohemia. However, when one has got over the surprise of finding you on
  intimate terms with Miss Beatrice, there comes a more amazing thing. You,
  with hard common sense written everywhere in your face, have been prepared at
  any moment, for all I know are prepared now, to make an utter and complete
  idiot of yourself over Elizabeth Gardner."</p>

  <p>Still Tavernake did not speak. Pritchard looked at him curiously.</p>

  <p>"Say," he went on, "I have come here to do you a service, if I can. So far
  as I know at present, this very wonderful young lady has kept on the right
  side of the law. But see here, Tavernake, she's been on the wrong side of
  everything that's decent and straight all her days. She married that poor
  creature for his money, and set herself deliberately to drive him off his
  head. Last night's tragedy was her doing, not his, though he, poor devil,
  will have to end his days in an asylum, and the lady will have his money to
  make herself more beautiful than ever with. Now I am going to let you behind
  the scenes, my young friend."</p>

  <p>Then Tavernake rose to his feet. In the shabby little room he seemed to
  have grown suddenly taller. He struck the crazy table with his clenched fist
  so that the crockery upon it rattled. Pritchard was used to seeing
  men&mdash;strong men, too&mdash;moved by various passions, but in Tavernake's
  face he seemed to see new things.</p>

  <p>"Pritchard," Tavernake exclaimed, "I don't want to hear another word!"</p>

  <p>Pritchard smiled.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "what I am going to tell you is the truth. What I am
  going to tell you I'd as soon say in the presence of the lady as here."</p>

  <p>Tavernake took a step forward and Pritchard suddenly realized the man who
  had thrown himself through that little opening in the wall, one against
  three, without a thought of danger.</p>

  <p>"If you say a single word more against her," Tavernake shouted hoarsely,
  "I shall throw you out of the room!"</p>

  <p>Pritchard stared at him. There was something amazing about this young
  man's attitude, something which he could not wholly grasp. He could see, too,
  that Tavernake's words were so few simply because he was trembling under the
  influence of an immense passion.</p>

  <p>"If you won't listen," Pritchard declared, slowly, "I can't talk. Still,
  you've got common sense, I take it. You've the ordinary powers of judging
  between right and wrong, and knowing when a man or a woman's honest. I want
  to save you&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Silence!" Tavernake exclaimed. "Look here, Pritchard," he went on,
  breathing a little more naturally now, "you came here meaning to do the right
  thing&mdash;I know that. You're all right, only you don't understand. You
  don't understand the sort of person I am. I am twenty-four years old, I have
  worked for my own living up here in London since I was twelve. I was a man,
  so far as work and independence went, at fifteen. Since then I have had my
  shoulder to the wheel; I have lived on nothing; I have made a little money
  where it didn't seem possible. I have worried my way into posts which it
  seemed that no one could think of giving me, but all the time I have lived in
  a little corner of the world&mdash;like that."</p>

  <p>His finger suddenly described a circle in the air.</p>

  <p>"You don't understand&mdash;you can't," he went on, "but there it is. I
  never spoke to a woman until I spoke to Beatrice. Chance made me her friend.
  I began to understand the outside of some of those things which I had never
  even dreamed of before. She set me right in many ways. I began to read,
  think, absorb little bits of the real world. It was all wonderful. Then
  Elizabeth came. I met her, too, by accident&mdash;she came to my office for a
  house&mdash;Elizabeth!"</p>

  <p>Pritchard found something almost pathetic in the sudden dropping of
  Tavernake's voice, the softening of his face.</p>

  <p>"I don't know how to talk about these things," Tavernake said, simply.
  "There's a literature that's reached from before the Bible to now, full of
  nothing else. It's all as old as the hills. I suppose I am about the only
  sane man in this city who knew nothing of it; but I did know nothing of it,
  and she was the first woman. Now you understand. I can't hear a word against
  her&mdash;I won't! She may be what you say. If so, she's got to tell me so
  herself!"</p>

  <p>"You mean that you are going to believe any story she likes to put
  up?"</p>

  <p>"I mean that I am going to her," Tavernake answered, "and I have no idea
  in the world what will happen&mdash;whether I shall believe her or not. I can
  see what you think of me," he went on, becoming a little more himself as the
  stress of unaccustomed speech passed him by. "I will tell you something that
  will show you that I realize a good deal. I know the difference between
  Beatrice and Elizabeth. Less than a week ago, I asked Beatrice to marry me.
  It was the only way I could think of, the only way I could kill the
  fever."</p>

  <p>"And Beatrice?" Pritchard asked, curiously.</p>

  <p>"She wouldn't," Tavernake replied. "After all, why should she? I have my
  way to make yet. I can't expect others to believe in me as I believe in
  myself. She was kind but she wouldn't."</p>

  <p>Pritchard lit a cigar.</p>

  <p>"Look here, Tavernake," he said, "you are a young man, you've got your
  life before you and life's a biggish thing. Empty out those romantic thoughts
  of yours, roll up your shirt sleeves and get at it. You are not one of these
  weaklings that need a woman's whispers in their ears to spur them on. You can
  work without that. It's only a chapter in your life&mdash;the passing of
  these three people. A few months ago, you knew nothing of them. Let them go.
  Get back to where you were."</p>

  <p>Then Tavernake for the first time laughed&mdash;a laugh that sounded even
  natural.</p>

  <p>"Have you ever found a man who could do that?" he asked. "The candle gives
  a good light sometimes, but you'll never think it the finest illumination in
  the world when you've seen the sun. Never mind me, Pritchard. I'm going to do
  my best still, but there's one thing that nothing will alter. I am going to
  make that woman tell me her story, I am going to listen to the way she tells
  it to me. You think that where women are concerned I am a fool. I am, but
  there is one great boon which has been vouchsafed to fools&mdash;they can
  tell the true from the false. Some sort of instinct, I suppose. Elizabeth
  shall tell me her story and I shall know, when she tells it, whether she is
  what you say or what she has seemed to me."</p>

  <p>Pritchard held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"You're a queer sort, Tavernake," he declared. "You take life plaguy
  seriously. I only hope you 'll get all out of it you expect to. So long!"</p>

  <p>Tavernake opened the window after his visitor had gone, and leaned out for
  some few minutes, letting the fresh air into the close, stifling room. Then
  he went upstairs, bathed and changed his clothes, made some pretense at
  breakfast, went through his letters with methodical exactness. At eleven
  o'clock he set out upon his pilgrimage.</p>

  <br>

  <h2>XXVII. TAVERNAKE CHOOSES</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake was kept waiting in the hall of the Milan Court
  for at least half an hour before Elizabeth was prepared to see him. He
  wandered aimlessly about watching the people come and go, looking out into
  the flower-hung courtyard, curiously unconscious of himself and of his
  errand, unable to concentrate his thoughts for a moment, yet filled all the
  time with the dull and uneasy sensation of one who moves in a dream. Every
  now and then he heard scraps of conversation from the servants and
  passers-by, referring to the last night's incident. He picked up a paper but
  threw it down after only a casual glance at the paragraph. He saw enough to
  convince him that for the present, at any rate, Elizabeth seemed assured of a
  certain amount of sympathy. The career of poor Wenham Gardner was set down in
  black and white, with little extenuation, little mercy. His misdeeds in
  Paris, his career in New York, spoke for themselves. He was quoted as a type,
  a decadent of the most debauched instincts, to whom crime was a relaxation
  and vice a habit. Tavernake would read no more. He might have been all these
  things, and yet she had become his wife!</p>

  <p>At last came the message for which he was waiting. As usual, her maid met
  him at the door of her suite and ushered him in. Elizabeth was dressed for
  the part very simply, with a suggestion even of mourning in her gray gown.
  She welcomed him with a pathetic smile.</p>

  <p>"Once more, my dear friend," she said, "I have to thank you."</p>

  <p>Her fingers closed upon his and she smiled into his face. Tavernake found
  himself curiously unresponsive. It was the same smile, and he knew very well
  that he himself had not changed, yet it seemed as though life itself were in
  a state of suspense for him.</p>

  <p>"You, too, are looking grave this morning, my friend," she continued. "Oh,
  how horrible it has all been! Within the last two hours I have had at least
  five reporters, a gentleman from Scotland Yard, another from the American
  Ambassador to see me. It is too terrible, of course," she went on. "Wenham's
  people are doing all they can to make it worse. They want to know why we were
  not together, why he was living in the country and I in town. They are trying
  to show that he was under restraint there, as if such a thing were possible!
  Mathers was his own servant&mdash;poor Mathers!"</p>

  <p>She sighed and wiped her eyes. Still Tavernake said nothing. She looked at
  him, a little surprised.</p>

  <p>"You are not very sympathetic," she observed. "Please come and sit down by
  my side and I will show you something."</p>

  <p>He moved towards her but he did not sit down. She stretched out her hand
  and picked something up from the table, holding it towards him. Tavernake
  took it mechanically and held it in his fingers. It was a cheque for twelve
  thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>"You see," she said, "I have not forgotten. This is the day, isn't it? If
  you like, you can stay and have lunch with me up here and we will drink to
  the success of our speculation."</p>

  <p>Tavernake held the cheque in his fingers; he made no motion to put it in
  his pocket. She looked at him with a puzzled frown upon her face.</p>

  <p>"Do talk or say something, please!" she exclaimed. "You look at me like
  some grim figure. Say something. Sit down and be natural."</p>

  <p>"May I ask you some questions?"</p>

  <p>"Of course you may," she replied. "You may do anything sooner than stand
  there looking so grim and unbending. What is it you want to know?"</p>

  <p>"Did you understand that Wenham Gardner was this sort of man when you
  married him?"</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders slightly.</p>

  <p>"I suppose I did," she admitted.</p>

  <p>"You married him, then, only because he was rich?"</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"What else do women marry for, my dear moralist?" she demanded. "It isn't
  my fault if it doesn't sound pretty. One must have money!"</p>

  <p>Tavernake inclined his head gravely; he made no sign of dissent.</p>

  <p>"You two came over to England," he went on, "with Beatrice and your
  father. Beatrice left you because she disapproved of certain things."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth nodded.</p>

  <p>"You may as well know the truth," she said. "Beatrice has the most absurd
  ideas. After a week with Wenham, I knew that he was not a person with whom
  any woman could possibly live. His valet was really only his keeper; he was
  subject to such mad fits that he needed some one always with him. I was
  obliged to leave him in Cornwall. I can't tell you everything, but it was
  absolutely impossible for me to go on living with him."</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," Tavernake remarked, "thought otherwise."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth looked at him quickly from below her eyelids. It was hard,
  however, to gather anything from his face.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice thought otherwise," Elizabeth admitted. "She thought that I
  ought to nurse him, put up with him, give up all my friends, and try and keep
  him alive. Why, it would have been absolute martyrdom, misery for me," she
  declared. "How could I be expected to do such a thing?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake nodded gravely.</p>

  <p>"And the money?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Well, perhaps there I was a trifle calculating," she confessed. "But
  you," she added, nodding at the cheque in his hand, "shouldn't grumble at
  that. I knew when we were married that I should have trouble. His people
  hated me, and I knew that in the event of anything happening like this thing
  which has happened, they would try to get as little as possible allowed me.
  So before we left New York, I got Wenham to turn as much as ever he could
  into cash. That we brought away with us."</p>

  <p>"And who took care of it?"</p>

  <p>Elizabeth smiled.</p>

  <p>"I did," she answered, "naturally."</p>

  <p>"Tell me about last night," Tavernake said. "I suppose I am stupid but I
  don't quite understand."</p>

  <p>"How should you?" she answered. "Listen, then. Wenham, I suppose got tired
  of being shut up with Mathers, although I am sure I don't see what else was
  possible. So he waited for his opportunity, and when the man wasn't
  looking&mdash;well, you know what happened," she added, with a shiver. "He
  got up to London somehow and made his way to Dover Street."</p>

  <p>"Why Dover Street?"</p>

  <p>"I suppose you know," Elizabeth explained, "that Wenham has a
  brother&mdash;Jerry&mdash;who is exactly like him. These two had rooms in
  Dover Street always, where they kept some English clothes and a servant.
  Jerry Gardner was over in London. I knew that, and was expecting to see him
  every day. Wenham found his way to the rooms, dressed himself in his
  brother's clothes, even wore his ring and some of his jewelry, which he knew
  I should recognize, and came here. I believed&mdash;yes, I believed all the
  time," she went on, her voice trembling, "that it was Jerry who was sitting
  with me. Once or twice I had a sort of terrible shiver. Then I remembered how
  much they were alike and it seemed to me ridiculous to be afraid. It was not
  till we got upstairs, till the door was closed behind me, that he turned
  round and I knew!"</p>

  <p>Her head fell suddenly into her hands. It was almost the first sign of
  emotion. Tavernake analyzed it mercilessly. He knew very well that it was
  fear, the coward's fear of that terrible moment.</p>

  <p>"And now?"</p>

  <p>"Now," she went on, more cheerfully, "no one will venture to deny that
  Wenham is mad. He will be placed under restraint, of course, and the courts
  will make me an allowance. One thing is absolutely certain, and that is that
  he will not live a year."</p>

  <p>Tavernake half closed his eyes. Was there no sign of his suffering, no
  warning note of the things which were passing out of his life! The woman who
  smiled upon him seemed to see nothing. The twitching of his fingers, the
  slight quivering of his face, she thought was because of his fear for
  her.</p>

  <p>"And now," she declared, in a suddenly altered tone, "this is all over and
  done with. Now you know everything. There are no more mysteries," she added,
  smiling at him delightfully. "It is all very terrible, of course, but I feel
  as though a great weight had passed away. You and I are going to be friends,
  are we not?"</p>

  <p>She rose slowly to her feet and came towards him. His eyes watched her
  slow, graceful movements as though fascinated. He remembered on that first
  visit of his how wonderful he had thought her walk. She was still smiling up
  at him; her fingers fell upon his shoulders.</p>

  <p>"You are such a strange person," she murmured. "You aren't a little bit
  like any of the men I've ever known, any of the men I have ever cared to have
  as friends. There is something about you altogether different. I suppose that
  is why I rather like you. Are you glad?"</p>

  <p>For a single wild moment Tavernake hesitated. She was so close to him that
  her hair touched his forehead, the breath from her upturned lips fell upon
  his cheeks. Her blue eyes were half pleading, half inviting.</p>

  <p>"You are going to be my very dear friend, are you not&mdash;Leonard?" she
  whispered. "I do feel that I need some one strong like you to help me through
  these days."</p>

  <p>Tavernake suddenly seized the hands that were upon his shoulders, and
  forced them back. She felt herself gripped as though by a vice, and a sudden
  terror seized her. He lifted her up and she caught a glimpse of his wild, set
  face. Then the breath came through his teeth. He shook all over but the fit
  had passed. He simply thrust her away from him.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "we cannot be friends! You are a woman without a heart, you
  are a murderess!"</p>

  <p>He tore her cheque calmly in pieces and flung them scornfully away. She
  stood looking at him, breathing quickly, white to the lips though the murder
  had gone from his eyes.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice warned me," he went on; "Pritchard warned me. Some things I saw
  for myself, but I suppose I was mad. Now I know!"</p>

  <p>He turned away. Her eyes followed him wonderingly.</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she cried out, "you are not going like this? You don't mean
  it!"</p>

  <p>Ever afterwards his restraint amazed him. He did not reply. He closed both
  doors firmly behind him and walked to the lift. She came even to the outside
  door and called down the corridor.</p>

  <p>"Leonard, come back for one moment!"</p>

  <p>He turned his head and looked at her, looked at her from the corner of the
  corridor, steadfastly and without speech. Her fingers dropped from the handle
  of the door. She went back into her room with shaking knees, and began to cry
  softly. Afterwards she wondered at herself. It was the first time she had
  cried for many years.</p>

  <p>Tavernake walked to the city and in less than half an hour's time found
  himself in Mr. Martin's office. The lawyer welcomed him warmly.</p>

  <p>"I'm jolly glad to see you, Tavernake," he declared. "I hope you've got
  the money. Sit down."</p>

  <p>Tavernake did not sit down; he had forgotten, indeed, to take of his
  hat.</p>

  <p>"Martin," he said, "I am sorry for you. I have been fooled and you have to
  pay as well as I have. I can't take up the option on the property. I haven't
  a penny toward it except my own money, and you know how much that is. You can
  sell my plots, if you like, and call the money your costs. I've
  finished."</p>

  <p>The lawyer looked at him with wide-open mouth.</p>

  <p>"What on earth are you talking about, Tavernake?" he exclaimed. "Are you
  drunk, by any chance?"</p>

  <p>"No, I am quite sober," Tavernake answered. "I have made one or two bad
  mistakes, that's all. You have a power of attorney for me. You can do what
  you like with my land, make any terms you please. Good-day!"</p>

  <p>"But, Tavernake, look here!" the lawyer protested, springing to his feet.
  "I say, Tavernake!" he called out.</p>

  <p>But Tavernake heard nothing, or, if he heard, he took no notice. He walked
  out into the street and was lost among the hurrying throngs upon the
  pavements.</p>

  <h2>I. NEW HORIZONS</h2>

  <p class="first">Towards the sky-line, across the level country, stumbling
  and crawling over the deep-hewn dikes, wading sometimes through the
  mud-oozing swamp, Tavernake, who had left the small railway terminus on foot,
  made his way that night steadily seawards, as one pursued by some relentless
  and indefatigable enemy. Twilight had fallen like a mantle around him, fallen
  over that great flat region of fens and pastureland and bog. Little patches
  of mist, harbingers of the coming obscurity, were being drawn now into the
  gradual darkness. Lights twinkled out from the far-scattered homesteads. Here
  and there a dog barked, some lonely bird seeking shelter called to its mate,
  but of human beings there seemed to be no one in sight save the solitary
  traveler.</p>

  <p>Tavernake was in grievous straits. His clothes were caked with mud, his
  hair tossed with the wind, his cheeks pale, his eyes set with the despair of
  that fierce upheaval through which he had passed. For many hours the torture
  which had driven him back towards his birthplace had triumphed over his
  physical exhaustion. Now came the time, however, when the latter asserted
  itself. With a half-stifled moan he collapsed. Sheer fatigue induced a brief
  but merciful spell of uneasy slumber. He lay upon his back near one of the
  broader dikes, his arms outstretched, his unseeing eyes turned toward the
  sky. The darkness deepened and passed away again before the light of the
  moon. When at last he sat up, it was a new world upon which he looked, a
  strange land, moonlit in places, yet full of shadowy somberness. He gazed
  wonderingly around&mdash;for the moment he had forgotten. Then memory came,
  and with memory once more the stab at his heart. He rose to his feet and went
  resolutely on his way.</p>

  <p>Almost until the dawn he walked, keeping as near as he could to that long
  monotonous line of telegraph posts, yet avoiding the road as much as
  possible. With the rising of the sun, he crept into a wayside hovel and lay
  there hidden for hours. Hunger and thirst seemed like things which had passed
  him by. It was sleep only which he craved, sleep and forgetfulness.</p>

  <p>Dusk was falling again before he found himself upon his feet, starting out
  once more upon this strangely thought-of pilgrimage. This time he kept to the
  road, plodding along with tired, dejected footsteps, which had in them still
  something of that restless haste which drove him ceaselessly onward as though
  he were indeed possessed of some unquiet spirit. He was recovering now,
  however, a little of his natural common sense. He remembered that he must
  have food and drink, and he sought them from the wayside public-house like an
  ordinary traveler, conquering without any apparent effort that first
  invincible repugnance of his toward the face of any human being. Then on
  again across this strange land of windmills and spreading plains, until the
  darkness forced him to take shelter once more. That night he slept like a
  child. With the morning, the fever had passed from his blood. A great wind
  blew in his face even as he opened his eyes, touched to wakefulness by the
  morning sun, a wind that came booming over the level places, salt with the
  touch of the ocean and fragrant with the perfume of many marsh plants. He was
  coming toward the sea now, and within a very short distance from where he had
  spent the night, he found a broad, shining river stealing into the land. With
  eager fingers he stripped himself and plunged in, diving again and again
  below the surface, swimming with long, lazy strokes backwards and forwards.
  Afterwards he lay down in the warm, dry grass, dressed himself slowly, and
  went on his way. The wind, which had increased now since the early morning,
  came thundering across the level land, bending the tops of the few scattered
  trees, sending the sails of the windmills spinning, bringing on its bosom now
  stronger than ever the flavor of the sea itself, salt and stimulating.
  Tavernake told himself that this was a new world into which he was coming. He
  would pass into its embrace and life would become a new thing.</p>

  <p>Towards evening with many a thrill of reminiscence, he descended a steep
  hill and walked into a queer time-forgotten village, whose scattered
  red-tiled cottages were built around an arm of the sea. Boldly enough now he
  entered the one inn which flaunted its sign upon the cobbled street, and,
  taking a seat in the stone-floored kitchen, ate and drank and bespoke a bed.
  Later on, he strolled down to the quay and made friends with the few
  fishermen who were loitering there. They answered his questions readily,
  although he found it hard at first to pick up again the dialect of which he
  himself had once made use. The little place was scarcely changed. All
  progress, indeed, seemed to have passed it by. There were a handful of
  fishermen, a boat-builder and a fish-curer in the village. There was no other
  industry save a couple of small farmhouses on the outskirts of the place, no
  railway within twelve miles. Tourists came seldom, excursionists never. In
  the half contented, half animal-like expression which seemed common to all
  the inhabitants, Tavernake read easily enough the history of their uneventful
  days. It was such a shelter as this, indeed, for which he had been
  searching.</p>

  <p>On the second night after his arrival, he walked with the boatbuilder upon
  the wooden quay. The boatbuilder's name was Nicholls, and he was a man of
  some means, deacon of the chapel, with a fair connection as a jobbing
  carpenter, and possessor of the only horse and cart in the place.</p>

  <p>"Nicholls," Tavernake said, "you don't remember me, do you?"</p>

  <p>The boat-builder shook his head slowly and ponderously.</p>

  <p>"There was Richard Tavernake who farmed the low fields," he remarked,
  reminiscently. "Maybe you're a son of his. Now I come to think of it, he had
  a boy apprenticed to the carpentering."</p>

  <p>"I was the boy," Tavernake answered. "I soon had enough of it and went to
  London."</p>

  <p>"You'm grown out of all knowledge," Nicholls declared, "but I mind you
  now. So you've been in London all these years?"</p>

  <p>"I've been in London," Tavernake admitted, "and I think, of the two, that
  Sprey-by-the-Sea is the better place."</p>

  <p>"Sprey is well enough," the boat-builder confessed, "well enough for a man
  who isn't set on change."</p>

  <p>"Change," Tavernake asserted, grimly, "is an overrated joy. I have had too
  much of it in my life. I think that I should like to stay here for some
  time."</p>

  <p>The boat-builder was surprised, but he was a man of heavy and deliberate
  turn of mind and he did not commit himself to speech. Tavernake
  continued.</p>

  <p>"I used to know something of carpentering in my younger days," he said,
  "and I don't think that I have forgotten it all. I wonder if I could find
  anything to do down here?"</p>

  <p>Matthew Nicholls stroked his beard thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"The folk round about are not over partial to strangers," he observed,
  "and you'm been away so long I reckon there's not many as'd recollect you.
  And as for carpentering jobs, there's Tom Lake over at Lesser Blakeney and
  his brother down at Brancaster, besides me on the spot, as you might say.
  It's a poor sort of opening there'd be, if you ask my opinion, especially for
  one like yourself, as 'as got education."</p>

  <p>"I should be satisfied with very little," Tavernake persisted. "I want to
  work with my hands. I should like to forget for a time that I have had any
  education at all."</p>

  <p>"That do seem mightily queer to me," Nicholls remarked, thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>Tavernake smiled.</p>

  <p>"Come," he said, "it isn't altogether unnatural. I want to make something
  with my hands. I think that I could build boats. Why do you not take me into
  your yard? I could do no harm and I should not want much pay."</p>

  <p>Matthew Nicholls stroked his beard once more and this time he counted
  fifty, as was his custom when confronted with a difficult matter. He had no
  need to do anything of the sort, for nothing in the world would have induced
  him to make up his mind on the spot as to so weighty a proposal.</p>

  <p>"It's not likely that you're serious," he objected. "You are a young man
  and strong-limbed, I should imagine, but you've education&mdash;one can tell
  it by the way you pronounce your words. It's but a poor living, after all, to
  be made here."</p>

  <p>"I like the place," Tavernake declared doggedly. "I am a man of small
  needs. I want to work all through the day, work till I am tired enough to
  sleep at night, work till my bones ache and my arms are sore. I suppose you
  could give me enough to live on in a humble way?"</p>

  <p>"Take a bite of supper with me," Nicholls answered. "In these serious
  affairs, my daughter has always her say. We will put the matter before her
  and see what she thinks of it."</p>

  <p>They lingered about the quay until the light from Wells Lighthouse flashed
  across the sea, and until in the distance they could hear the moaning of the
  incoming tide as it rippled over the bar and began to fill the tidal way
  which stretched to the wooden pier itself. Then the two men made their way
  along the village street, through a field, and into the little yard over
  which stood the sign of "Matthew Nicholls, Boat-Builder." At one corner of
  the yard was the cottage in which he lived.</p>

  <p>"You'll come right in, Mr. Tavernake," he said, the instincts of
  hospitality stirring within him as soon as they had passed through the gate.
  "We will talk of this matter together, you and me and the daughter."</p>

  <p>Tavernake seemed, on his introduction to the household, like a man unused
  to feminine society. Perhaps he did not expect to find such a type of her sex
  as Ruth Nicholls in such a remote neighborhood. She was thin, and her cheeks
  were paler than those of any of the other young women whom he had seen about
  the village. Her eyes, too, were darker, and her speech different. There was
  nothing about her which reminded him in the least of the child with whom he
  had played. Tavernake watched her intently. Presently the idea came to him
  that she, too, was seeking shelter.</p>

  <p>Supper was a simple meal, but it was well and deftly served. The girl had
  the gift of moving noiselessly. She was quick without giving the impression
  of haste. To their guest she was courteous, but her recollection of him
  appeared to be slight, and his coming but a matter of slight interest. After
  she had cleared the cloth, however, and produced a jar of tobacco, her father
  bade her sit down with them.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," he began, ponderously, "is thinking some of settling down
  in these parts, Ruth."</p>

  <p>She inclined her head gravely.</p>

  <p>"It appears," her father continued, "that he is sick and tired of the city
  and of head-work. He is wishful to come into the yard with me, if so be that
  we could find enough work for two."</p>

  <p>The girl looked at their visitor, and for the first time there was a
  measure of curiosity in her earnest gaze. Tavernake was, in his way, good
  enough to look upon. He was well-built, his shoulders and physique all spoke
  of strength. His features were firmly cut, although his general expression
  was gloomy. But for a certain moroseness, an uncouthness which he seemed to
  cultivate, he might even have been deemed good-looking.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake would make a great mistake," she said, hesitatingly. "It is
  not well for those who have brains to work with their hands. It is not a
  place for those to live who have been out in the world. At most seasons of
  the year it is but a wilderness. Sometimes there is little enough to do, even
  for father."</p>

  <p>"I am not ambitious for over-much work or for over-much money, Miss
  Nicholls," Tavernake replied. "I will be frank with you both. Things out in
  the world there went ill with me; it was not my fault, but they went ill with
  me. What ambitions I had are finished&mdash;for the present, at any rate. I
  want to rest, I want to work with my hands, to grow my muscles again, to feel
  my strength, to believe that there is something effective in the world I can
  do. I have had a shock, a disappointment,&mdash;call it what you like."</p>

  <p>The old man Nicholls nodded deliberately.</p>

  <p>"Well," he pronounced, "it's a big change to make. I never thought of help
  in the yard before. When there's been more than I could do, I've just let it
  go. Come for a week on trial, Leonard Tavernake. If we are of any use to one
  another, we shall soon know of it."</p>

  <p>The girl, who had been looking out into the night, came back.</p>

  <p>"You are making a mistake, Mr. Tavernake," she said. "You are too young
  and strong to have finished your battle."</p>

  <p>He looked at her steadily and sighed. It was only too obvious that hers
  had been fought and lost.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," he replied softly, "you are right. Perhaps it is only the rest
  I want. We shall see."</p>

  <h2>II. THE SIMPLE LIFE</h2>

  <p class="first">So Tavernake became a boat-builder. Summer passed into
  winter and this hamlet by the sea seemed, indeed, as though it might have
  been one of the forgotten spots upon the earth. Save for that handful of
  cottages, the two farmhouses a few hundred yards inland, and the deserted
  Hall half-hidden in its grove of pine trees, there was no dwelling-place nor
  any sign of human habitation for many miles. For eight hours a day Tavernake
  worked, mostly out of doors, in the little yard which hung over the beach.
  Sometimes he rested from his labors and looked seaward, looked around him as
  though rejoicing in that unbroken solitude, the emptiness of the gray ocean,
  the loneliness of the land behind. What things there were which lay back in
  the cells of his memory, no person there knew, for he spoke of his past to no
  one, not even to Ruth. He was a good workman, and he lived the simple life of
  those others without complaint or weariness. There was nothing in his manner
  to denote that he had been used to anything else. The village had accepted
  him without question. It was only Ruth who still, gravely but kindly enough,
  disapproved of his presence.</p>

  <p>One day she came and sat with him as he smoked his after-dinner pipe,
  leaning against an overturned boat, with his eyes fixed upon that line of
  gray breakers.</p>

  <p>"You spend a good deal of your time thinking, Mr. Tavernake," she remarked
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"Too much," he admitted at once, "too much, Miss Nicholls. I should be
  better employed planing down that mast there."</p>

  <p>"You know that I did not mean that," she said, reprovingly, "only
  sometimes you make me&mdash;shall I confess it?&mdash;almost angry with
  you."</p>

  <p>He took his pipe from his mouth and knocked out the ashes. As they fell on
  the ground so he looked at them.</p>

  <p>"All thought is wasted time," he declared, grimly, "all thought of the
  past. The past is like those ashes; it is dead and finished."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not always," she replied. "Sometimes the past comes to life again.
  Sometimes the bravest of us quit the fight too soon."</p>

  <p>He looked at her questioningly, almost fiercely. Her words, however,
  seemed spoken without intent.</p>

  <p>"So far as mine is concerned," he pronounced, "it is finished. There is a
  memorial stone laid upon it, and no resurrection is possible."</p>

  <p>"You cannot tell," she answered. "No one can tell."</p>

  <p>He turned back to his work almost rudely, but she stayed by his side.</p>

  <p>"Once," she remarked, reflectively, "I, too, went a little way into the
  world. I was a school-teacher at Norwich. I was very fond of some one there;
  we were engaged. Then my mother died and I had to come back to look after
  father."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"We are a long way from Norwich," she continued, quietly. "Soon after I
  left, the man whom I was fond of grew lonely. He found some one else."</p>

  <p>"You have forgotten him?" Tavernake asked, quickly.</p>

  <p>"I shall never forget him," she replied. "That part of life is finished,
  but if ever my father can spare me, I shall go back to my work again.
  Sometimes those work the best and accomplish the most who carry the scars of
  a great wound."</p>

  <p>She turned away to the house, and after that it seemed to him that she
  avoided him for a time. At any rate, she made no further attempt to win his
  confidence. Propinquity, however, was too much for both of them. He was a
  lodger under her father's roof. It was scarcely possible for them to keep
  apart. Saturdays and Sundays they walked sometimes for miles across the
  frost-bound marshes, in the quickening atmosphere of the darkening
  afternoons, when the red sun sank early behind the hills, and the twilight
  grew shorter every day. They watched the sea-birds together and saw the wild
  duck come down to the pools; felt the glow of exercise burn their cheeks;
  felt, too, that common and nameless exultation engendered by their loneliness
  in the solitude of these beautiful empty places. In the evenings they often
  read together, for Nicholls, although no drinker, never missed his hour or so
  at the village inn. Tavernake, in time, began to find a sort of comfort in
  her calm, sexless companionship. He knew very well that he was to her as she
  was to him, something human, something that filled an empty place, yet
  something without direct personality. Little by little he felt the bitterness
  in his heart grow less. Then a late spring&mdash;late, at any rate, in this
  quaint corner of the world&mdash;stole like some wonderful enchantment across
  the face of the moors and the marshes. Yellow gorse starred with golden
  clumps the brown hillside; wild lavender gleamed in patches across the
  silver-streaked marshes; the dead hedges came blossoming into life. Crocuses,
  long lines of yellow and purple crocuses, broke from waxy buds into starlike
  blossoms along the front of Matthew Nicholls's garden. And with the coming o
  spring, Tavernake found himself suddenly able to thin of the past. It was a
  new phase of life. He could sit down and think of those things that had
  happened to him, without fearing to be wrecked by the storm. Often he sat out
  looking seaward, thinking of the days when he had first met Beatrice, of
  those early days of pleasant companionship, of the marvelous avidity with
  which he had learned from her. Only when Elizabeth's face stole into the
  foreground did he spring from his place and turn back to his work.</p>

  <p>One day Tavernake sat poring over the weekly local paper, reading it more
  out of curiosity than from any real interest. Suddenly a familiar name caught
  his eye. His heart seemed to stop beating for a moment, and the page swam
  before his eyes. Quickly he recovered himself and read:</p>
  <pre>

  <p>Twice Tavernake read the announcement. Then he went out and found
  Ruth.</p>

  <p>"Ruth," he told her, "there is something calling me back, perhaps for
  good."</p>

  <p>For the first time she gave him her hand.</p>

  <p>"Now you are talking like a man once more," she declared. "Go and seek it.
  Comeback and say good-bye to us, if you will, but throw your tools into the
  sea."</p>

  <p>Tavernake laughed and looked across at his workshop.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe," he said, "that you've any confidence in my boat."</p>

  <p>"I'm not sure that I would sail with you," she answered, "even if you ever
  finished it. A laborer's work for a laborer's hand. You must go back to the
  other things."</p>

  <h2>III. OLD FRIENDS MEET</h2>

  <p class="first">The professor set down his tumbler upon the zinc-rimmed
  counter. He was very little changed except that he had grown a shade stouter,
  and there was perhaps more color in his cheeks. He carried himself, too, like
  a man who believes in himself. In the small public-house he was, without
  doubt, an impressive figure.</p>

  <p>"My friends," he remarked, "our host's whiskey is good. At the same time,
  I must not forget&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"You'll have one with me, Professor," a youth at his elbow interrupted.
  "Two special whiskies, miss, if you please."</p>

  <p>The professor shrugged his shoulders&mdash;it was a gesture which he
  wished every one to understand. He was suffering now the penalty for a
  popularity which would not be denied!</p>

  <p>"You are very kind, sir," he said, "very kind, indeed. As I was about to
  say, I must not forget that in less than half an hour I am due upon the
  stage. It does not do to disappoint one's audience, sir. It is a poor place,
  this music-hall, but it is full, they tell me packed from floor to ceiling.
  At eight-thirty I must show myself."</p>

  <p>"A marvelous turn, too, Professor," declared one of the young men by whom
  he was surrounded.</p>

  <p>"I thank you, sir," the professor replied, turning towards the speaker,
  glass in hand. "There have been others who have paid me a similar compliment;
  others, I may say, not unconnected with the aristocracy of your
  country&mdash;not unconnected either, I might add," he went on, "with the
  very highest in the land, those who from their exalted position have never
  failed to shower favors upon the more fortunate sons of our profession. The
  science of which I am to some extent the pioneer&mdash;not a drop more, my
  young friend. Say, I'm in dead earnest this time! No more, indeed."</p>

  <p>The young man in knickerbockers who had just come in banged the head of
  his cane upon the counter.</p>

  <p>"You'll never refuse me, Professor," he asserted, confidently. "I'm an old
  supporter, I am. I've seen you in Blackburn and Manchester, and twice here.
  Just as wonderful as ever! And that young lady of yours, Professor, begging
  your pardon if she is your daughter, as no doubt she is, why, she's a nut and
  no mistake."</p>

  <p>The professor sighed. He was in his element but he was getting uneasy at
  the flight of time.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "your face is not familiar to me but I cannot
  refuse your kindly offer. It must be the last, however, absolutely the
  last."</p>

  <p>Then Tavernake, directed here from the music-hall, pushed open the swing
  door and entered. The professor set down his glass untasted. Tavernake came
  slowly across the room.</p>

  <p>"You haven't forgotten me, then, Professor?" he remarked, holding out his
  hand.</p>

  <p>The professor welcomed him a little limply; something of the bombast had
  gone out of his manner. Tavernake's arrival had reminded him of things which
  he had only too easily forgotten.</p>

  <p>"This is very surprising," he faltered, "very surprising indeed. Do you
  live in these parts?"</p>

  <p>"Not far away," Tavernake answered. "I saw your announcement in the
  papers."</p>

  <p>The professor nodded.</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I am on the war-path again. I tried resting but I got fat
  and lazy, and the people wouldn't have it, sir," he continued, recovering
  very quickly something of his former manner. "The number of offers I got
  through my agents by every post was simply astounding&mdash;astounding!"</p>

  <p>"I am looking forward to seeing your performance this evening," Tavernake
  said politely. "In the meantime&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I know what you are thinking of," the professor interrupted. "Well, well,
  give me your arm and we will walk down to the hall together. My friends," the
  professor added, turning round, "I wish you all a good-night!"</p>

  <p>Then the door was pushed half-way open and Tavernake's heart gave a jump.
  It was Beatrice who stood there, very pale, very tired, and much thinner even
  than the Beatrice of the boardinghouse, but still Beatrice.</p>

  <p>"Father," she exclaimed, "do you know that it is nearly&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Then she saw Tavernake and said no more. She seemed to sway a little, and
  Tavernake, taking a quick step forward, grasped her by the hands.</p>

  <p>"Dear sister," he cried, "you have been ill!"</p>

  <p>She was herself again almost in a moment.</p>

  <p>"Ill? Never in my life," she replied. "Only I have been hurrying&mdash;we
  are late already for the performance&mdash;and seeing you there, well, it was
  quite a shock, you know. Walk down with us and tell me all about it. Tell us
  what you are doing here&mdash;or rather, don't talk for a moment! It is all
  so amazing."</p>

  <p>They turned down the narrow cobbled street, the professor walking in the
  middle of the roadway, swinging his cane, a very imposing and wonderful
  figure, with the tails of his frock-coat streaming in the wind, his long hair
  only half-hidden by his hat. He hummed a tune to himself and affected not to
  take any notice of the other two. Then Tavernake suddenly realized that he
  had done a cowardly action in leaving her without a word.</p>

  <p>"There is so much to ask," she began at last, "but you have come
  back."</p>

  <p>She looked at his workman's clothes.</p>

  <p>"What have you been doing?" she asked, sharply.</p>

  <p>"Working," Tavernake answered, "good work, too. I am the better for it.
  Don't mind my clothes, Beatrice. I have been mad for a time, but after all it
  has been a healthy madness."</p>

  <p>"It was a strange thing that you did," she said,&mdash;"you
  disappeared."</p>

  <p>He nodded.</p>

  <p>"Some day," he told her, "I may, perhaps, be able to make you understand.
  Just now I don't think that I could."</p>

  <p>"It was Elizabeth?" she whispered, softly.</p>

  <p>"It was Elizabeth," he admitted.</p>

  <p>They said no more then till they reached the hall. She stopped at the door
  and put out her hand timidly.</p>

  <p>"I shall see you afterwards?" she ventured.</p>

  <p>"Do you mind my coming to the performance?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She hesitated.</p>

  <p>"A few moments ago," she remarked, smiling, "I was dreading your coming.
  Now I think that you had better. It will be all over at ten o'clock, and I
  shall look for you outside. You are living in Norwich?"</p>

  <p>"I shall be here for to-night, at any rate," he answered.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," she said, "afterwards we will have a talk."</p>

  <p>Tavernake passed through the scattered knot of loiterers at the door and
  bought a seat for himself in the little music-hall, which, notwithstanding
  the professor's boast, was none too well filled. It was a place of the
  old-fashioned sort, with small tables in the front, and waiters hurrying
  about serving drinks. The people were of the lowest order, and the atmosphere
  of the room was thick with tobacco smoke. A young woman in a flaxen wig and
  boy's clothes was singing a popular ditty, marching up and down the stage,
  and interspersing the words o f her song with grimaces and appropriate
  action. Tavernake sat down with a barely-smothered groan. He was beginning to
  realize the tragedy upon which he had stumbled. A comic singer followed, who
  in a dress suit several sizes too large for him gave an imitation of a
  popular Irish comedian. Then the curtain went up and the professor was seen,
  standing in front of the curtain and bowing solemnly to a somewhat
  unresponsive audience. A minute later Beatrice came quietly in and sat by his
  side. There was nothing new about the show. Tavernake had seen the same thing
  before, with the exception that the professor was perhaps a little behind the
  majority of his fellow-craftsmen. The performance was finished in dead
  silence, and after it was over, Beatrice came to the front and sang. She was
  a very unusual figure in such a place, in a plain black evening gown, with
  black gloves and no jewelry, but they encored her heartily, and she sang a
  song from the musical comedy in which Tavernake had first seen her. A sudden
  wave of reminiscence stirred within him. His thoughts seemed to go back to
  the night when he had waited for her outside the theatre and they had had
  supper at Imano's, to the day when he had left the boarding-house and entered
  upon his new life. It was more like a dream than ever now.</p>

  <p>He rose and quitted the place immediately she had finished, waiting in the
  street until she appeared. She came out in a few minutes.</p>

  <p>"Father is going to a supper," she announced, "at the inn where he has a
  room for receiving people. Will you come home with me for an hour? Then we
  can go round and fetch him."</p>

  <p>"I should like to," Tavernake answered.</p>

  <p>Her lodgings were only a few steps away&mdash;a strange little house in a
  narrow street. She opened the front door and ushered him in.</p>

  <p>"You understand, of course," she said, smiling, "that we have abandoned
  the haunts of luxury altogether."</p>

  <p>He looked around at the tiny room with its struggling fire and horsehair
  sofa, linoleum for carpet, oleographs for pictures, and he shivered, not for
  his own sake but for hers. On the sideboard were some bread and cheese and a
  bottle of ginger beer.</p>

  <p>"Please imagine," she begged, taking the pins from her hat, "that you are
  in those dear comfortable rooms of ours down at Chelsea. Draw that easy-chair
  up to what there is of the fire, and listen. You smoke still?"</p>

  <p>"I have taken to a pipe," he admitted.</p>

  <p>"Then light it and listen," she went on, smoothing her hair for a minute
  in front of the looking-glass. "You want to know about Elizabeth, of
  course."</p>

  <p>"Yes," he said, "I want to know."</p>

  <p>"Elizabeth, on the whole," Beatrice continued, "got out of all her
  troubles very well. Her husband's people were wild with her, but Elizabeth
  was very clever. They were never able to prove that she had exercised more
  than proper control over poor Wenham. He died two months after they took him
  to the asylum. They offered Elizabeth a lump sum to waive all claims to his
  estate, and she accepted it. I think that she is now somewhere on the
  Continent."</p>

  <p>"And you?" he asked. "Why did you leave the theatre?"</p>

  <p>"It was a matter of looking after my father," she explained. "You see,
  while he was there with Elizabeth he had too much money and nothing to do.
  The consequence was that he was always&mdash;well, I suppose I had better say
  it&mdash;drinking too much, and he was losing all his desire for work. I made
  him promise that if I could get some engagements he would come away with me,
  so I went to an agent and we have been touring like this for quite a long
  time."</p>

  <p>"But what a life for you!" Tavernake exclaimed. "Couldn't you have stayed
  on at the theatre and found him something in London?"</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"In London," she said, "he would never have got out of his old habits. And
  then," she went on, hesitatingly, "you understand that the public want
  something else besides the hypnotism&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Tavernake interrupted her ruthlessly.</p>

  <p>"Of course I understand," he declared, "I was there to-night. I understood
  at once why you were not very anxious for me to go. The people cared nothing
  at all about your father's performance. They simply waited for you. You would
  get the same money if you went round without him."</p>

  <p>She nodded, a trifle shamefacedly.</p>

  <p>"I am so afraid some one will tell him," she confessed. "They nearly
  always ask me to leave out his part of the performance. They have even
  offered me more money if I would come alone. But you see how it is. He
  believes in himself, he thinks he is very clever and he believes that the
  public like his show. It is the only thing which helps him to keep a little
  self-respect. He thinks that my singing is almost unnecessary."</p>

  <p>Tavernake looked into that faint glimmer of miserable fire. He was
  conscious of a curious feeling in his throat. How little he knew of life! The
  pathos of what she had told him, the thought of her bravely traveling the
  country and singing at third-rate music-halls, never taking any credit to
  herself, simply that her father might still believe himself a man of talent,
  appealed to him irresistibly. He suddenly held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Poor little Beatrice!" he exclaimed. "Dear little sister!"</p>

  <p>The hand he gripped was cold, she avoided his eyes.</p>

  <p>"You&mdash;you mustn't," she murmured. "Please don't!"</p>

  <p>He held out his other hand and half rose, but her lips suddenly ceased to
  quiver and she waved him back.</p>

  <p>"No, Leonard," she begged, "please don't do or say anything foolish. Since
  we do meet again, though, like this, I am going to ask you one question. What
  made you come to me and ask me to marry you that day?"</p>

  <p>He looked away; something in her eyes accused him.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," he confessed, "I was a thick-headed ignorant fool, without
  understanding. I came to you for safety. I was afraid of Elizabeth, I was
  afraid of what I felt for her. I wanted to escape from it."</p>

  <p>She smiled piteously.</p>

  <p>"It wasn't a very brave thing to do, was it?" she faltered.</p>

  <p>"It was mean," he admitted. "It was worse than that. But, Beatrice," he
  went on, "I was missing you horribly. You did leave a big empty place when
  you went away. I am not going to excuse myself about Elizabeth. I lived
  through a time of the strangest, most marvelous emotions one could dream of.
  Then the thing came to an end and I felt as though the bottom had gone out of
  life. I suppose&mdash;I loved her," he continued hesitatingly. "I don't know.
  I only know that she filled every thought of my brain, that she lived in
  every beat of my heart, that I would have gone down into Hell to help her.
  And then I understood. That morning she told me something of the truth about
  herself, not meaning to&mdash;unconsciously&mdash;justifying herself all the
  time, not realizing that every word she said was damnable. And then there
  didn't seem to be anything else left, and I had only one desire. I turned my
  back upon everything and I went back to the place where I was born, a little
  fishing village. For the last thirty miles I walked. I shall never forget it.
  When I got there, what I wanted was work, work with my hands. I wanted to
  build something, to create anything that I could labor upon. I became a boat
  builder&mdash;I have been a boatbuilder ever since."</p>

  <p>"And now?" she asked.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice!"</p>

  <p>She turned and faced him. She looked into his eyes very searchingly, very
  wistfully.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," he said, "I ask you once more, only differently. Will you
  marry me now? I'll find some work, I'll make enough money for us. Do you
  remember," he went on, "how I used to talk, how I used to feel that I had
  only to put forth my strength and I could win anything? I'll feel like that
  again, Beatrice, if you'll come to me."</p>

  <p>She shook her head slowly. She looked away from him with a sigh. She had
  the air of one who has sought for something which she has failed to find.</p>

  <p>"You mustn't think of that again, Leonard," she told him. "It would be
  quite impossible. This is the only way I can save my father. We have a tour
  that will take us the best part of another year."</p>

  <p>"But you are sacrificing yourself!" he declared. "I will keep your
  father."</p>

  <p>"It isn't that only," she replied. "For one thing, I couldn't let you; and
  for another, it isn't only the money, it's the work. As long as he's made to
  think that the public expect him every night, he keeps off drinking too much.
  There is nothing else in the whole world which would keep him steady. Don't
  look as though you didn't understand, Leonard. He is my father, you know, and
  there isn't anything more terrible than to see any one who has a claim on us
  give way to anything like that. You mayn't quite approve, but please believe
  that I am doing what I feel to be right."</p>

  <p>The little fire had gone out. Beatrice glanced at the clock and put on her
  jacket again.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, Leonard," she said, "but I think I must go and fetch father
  now. You can walk with me there, if you will. It has been very good to see
  you again. For the rest I don't know what to say to you. Do you think that it
  is quite what you were meant for&mdash;to build boats?"</p>

  <p>"I don't seem to have any other ambition," he answered, wearily. "When I
  read in the paper this morning that you and your father were here, things
  seemed suddenly different. I came at once. I didn't know what I wanted until
  I saw you, but I know now, and it isn't any good."</p>

  <p>"No good at all," she declared cheerfully. "It won't be very long,
  Leonard, before something else comes along to stir you. I don't think you
  were meant to build boats all your life."</p>

  <p>He rose and took up his hat. She was waiting for him at the door. Again
  they passed down the narrow street.</p>

  <p>"Tell, me, Beatrice," he begged, "is it because you don't like me well
  enough that you won't listen to what I ask?"</p>

  <p>For a moment she half closed her eyes as though in pain. Then she laughed,
  not perhaps very naturally. They were standing now by the door of the public
  house.</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she said, "you are very young in years but you are a baby in
  experience. Mind, there are other reasons why I could not&mdash;would not
  dream of marrying you, other reasons which are absolutely sufficient,
  but&mdash;do you know that you have asked me twice and you have never once
  said that you cared, that you have never once looked as though you cared? No,
  don't, please," she interrupted, "don't explain anything. You see, a woman
  always knows&mdash;too well, sometimes."</p>

  <p>She nodded, and passed in through the swinging-doors. Standing out there
  in the narrow, crooked street, Tavernake heard the clapping and applause
  which greeted her entrance, he heard her father's voice. Some one struck a
  note at the piano&mdash;she was going to sing. Very slowly he turned away and
  walked down the cobbled hill.</p>

  <h2>IV. PRITCHARD'S GOOD NEWS</h2>

  <p class="first">Late in the afternoon of the following day, Ruth came home
  from the village and found Tavernake hard at work on his boat. She put down
  her basket and stopped by his side.</p>

  <p>"So you are back again," she remarked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am back again."</p>

  <p>"And nothing has happened?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing has happened," he assented, wearily. "Nothing ever will happen
  now."</p>

  <p>She smiled.</p>

  <p>"You mean that you will stay here and build boats all your life?"</p>

  <p>"That is what I mean to do," he announced.</p>

  <p>She laid her hand upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Don't believe it, Leonard," she said. "There is other work for you in the
  world somewhere, just as there is for me."</p>

  <p>He shook his head and she picked up her basket again, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Your time will come as it comes to the rest of us," she declared,
  cheerfully. "You won't want to sit here and bury your talents in the sands
  all your days. Have you heard what is going to happen to me?"</p>

  <p>"No! Something good, I hope."</p>

  <p>"My father's favorite niece is coming to live with us&mdash;there are
  seven of them altogether, and farming doesn't pay like it used to, so
  Margaret is coming here. Father says that if she is as handy as she used to
  be I may go back to the schools almost at once."</p>

  <p>Tavernake was silent for a moment. Then he got up and threw down his
  tools.</p>

  <p>"Great Heavens!" he exclaimed. "If I am not becoming the most selfish
  brute that ever breathed! Do you know, the first thought I had was that I
  should miss you? You are right, young woman, I must get out of this."</p>

  <p>She disappeared into the house, smiling, and Tavernake called out to
  Nicholls, who was sitting on the wall.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Nicholls," he asked, "how much notice do you want?"</p>

  <p>Matthew Nicholls removed his pipe from his mouth.</p>

  <p>"Why, I don't know that I'm particular," he replied, "being as you want to
  go. Between you and me, I'm gettin' fat and lazy since you came. There ain't
  enough work for two, and that's all there is to it, and being as you're young
  and active, why, I've left it to you, and look at my arms."</p>

  <p>He held them up.</p>

  <p>"Used to be all muscle, now they're nothin' but bloomin' pap. And no' but
  two glasses of beer a day extra have I drunk, just to pass the time. You can
  stay if you will, young man, but you can go out fishin' and leave me the
  work, and I'll pay you just the same, for I'm not saying that I don't like
  your company. Or you can go when you please, and that's the end of it."</p>

  <p>Matthew Nicholls spat upon the stones and replaced his pipe in his mouth.
  Tavernake came in and sat down by his side.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "I believe you are right. I'll stay another week but
  I'll take things easy. You get on with the boat now. I'll sit here and have a
  smoke."</p>

  <p>Nicholls grunted but obeyed, and for the next few days Tavernake loafed.
  On his return one afternoon from a long walk, he saw a familiar figure
  sitting upon the sea wall in front of the workshop, a familiar figure but a
  strange one in these parts. It was Mr. Pritchard, in an American felt hat,
  and smoking a very black cigar. He leaned over and nodded to Tavernake, who
  was staring at him aghast.</p>

  <p>"Hallo, old man!" he called out. "Run you to earth, you see!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I see!" Tavernake exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"Come right along up here and let's talk," Pritchard continued.</p>

  <p>Tavernake obeyed. Pritchard looked him over approvingly. Tavernake was
  roughly dressed in those days, but as a man he had certainly developed.</p>

  <p>"Say, you're looking fine," his visitor remarked. "What wouldn't I give
  for that color and those shoulders!"</p>

  <p>"It is a healthy life," Tavernake admitted. "Do you mean that you've come
  down here to see me?"</p>

  <p>"That's so," Pritchard announced; "down here to see you, and for no other
  reason. Not but that the scenery isn't all it should be, and that sort of
  thing," he went on, "but I am not putting up any bluff about it. It's you I
  am here to talk to. Are you ready? Shall I go straight ahead?"</p>

  <p>"If you please," Tavernake said, slowly filling his pipe.</p>

  <p>"You dropped out of things pretty sudden," Pritchard continued. "It didn't
  take me much guessing to reckon up why. Between you and me, you are not the
  first man who's been up against it on account of that young woman. Don't stop
  me," he begged. "I know how you've been feeling. It was a right good idea of
  yours to come here. Others before you have tried the shady side of New York
  and Paris, and it's the wrong treatment. It's Hell, that's what it is, for
  them. Now that young woman&mdash;we got to speak of her&mdash;is about the
  most beautiful and the most fascinating of her sex&mdash;I'll grant that to
  start with&mdash;but she isn't worth the life of a snail, much less the life
  of a strong man."</p>

  <p>"You are, quite right," Tavernake confessed, shortly. "I know I was a
  fool&mdash;a fool! If I could think of any adjective that would meet the
  case, I'd use it, but there it is. I chucked things and I came here. You
  haven't come down to tell me your opinion of me, I suppose?"</p>

  <p>"Not by any manner of means," Pritchard admitted. "I came down first to
  tell you that you were a fool, if it was necessary. Since you know it, it
  isn't. We'll pass on to the next stage, and that is, what are you going to do
  about it?"</p>

  <p>"It is in my mind at the present moment," Tavernake announced, "to leave
  here. The only trouble is, I am not very keen about London."</p>

  <p>Pritchard nodded thoughtfully.</p>

  <p>"That's all right," he agreed. "London's no place for a man, anyway. You
  don't want to learn the usual tricks of money-making. Money that's made in
  the cities is mostly made with stained fingers. I have a different sort of
  proposal to make."</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," Tavernake said. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"A new country," Pritchard declared, altering the angle of his cigar, "a
  virgin land, mountains and valleys, great rivers to be crossed, all sorts of
  cold and heat to be borne with, a land rich with minerals&mdash;some say
  gold, but never mind that. There is oil in parts, there's tin, there's coal,
  and there's thousands and thousands of miles of forest. You're a
  surveyor?"</p>

  <p>"Passed all my exams," Tavernake agreed tersely.</p>

  <p>"You are the man for out yonder," Pritchard insisted. "I've two years'
  vacation&mdash;dead sick of this city life I am&mdash;and I am going to put
  you on the track of it. You don't know much about prospecting yet, I
  reckon?"</p>

  <p>"Nothing at all!"</p>

  <p>"You soon shall," Pritchard went on. "We'll start from Winnipeg. A few
  horses, some guides, and a couple of tents. We'll spend twenty weeks, my
  friend, without seeing a town. What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p>"Gorgeous!" Tavernake muttered.</p>

  <p>"Twenty weeks we'll strike westward. I know the way to set about the whole
  job. I know one or two of the capitalists, too, and if we don't map out some
  of the grandest estates in British Columbia, why, my name ain't
  Pritchard."</p>

  <p>"But I haven't a penny in the world," Tavernake objected.</p>

  <p>"That's where you're lying," Pritchard remarked, pulling a newspaper from
  his pocket. "See the advertisement for yourself: 'Leonard Tavernake,
  something to his advantage.' Well, down I went to those lawyers&mdash;your
  old lawyer it was&mdash;Martin. I told him I was on your track, and he
  said&mdash;'For Heaven's sake, send the fellow along!' Say, Tavernake, he
  made me laugh the way he described your bursting in upon him and telling him
  to take your land for his costs, and walking out of the room like something
  almighty. Why, he worked that thing so that they had to buy your land, and
  they took him into partnership. He's made a pot of money, and needs no costs
  from you, and there's the money for your land and what he had of yours
  besides, waiting for you."</p>

  <p>Tavernake smoked stolidly at his pipe. His eyes were out seaward, but his
  heart was beating to a new and splendid music. To start life again, a man's
  life, out in the solitudes, out in the great open spaces! It was gorgeous,
  this! He turned round and grasped Pritchard by the shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I say," he exclaimed, "why are you doing all this for me, Pritchard?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard laughed.</p>

  <p>"You did me a good turn," he said, "and you're a man. You've the
  pluck&mdash;that's what I like. You knew nothing, you were as green and
  ignorant as a young man from behind the counter of a country shop, but, my
  God! you'd got the right stuff, and I meant getting even with you if I could.
  You'll leave here with me to-morrow, and in three weeks we sail."</p>

  <p>Ruth came smiling out from the house.</p>

  <p>"Won't you bring your friend in to supper, Mr. Tavernake?" she begged.
  "It's good news, I hope?" she added, lowering her voice a little.</p>

  <p>"It's the best," Tavernake declared, "the best!"</p>

  <br>

  <h2>V. BEATRICE REFUSES</h2>

  <p class="first">A week later Tavernake was in London. A visit to his friend
  Mr. Martin had easily proved the truth of Pritchard's words, and he found
  himself in possession of a sum of money at least twice as great as he had
  anticipated. He stayed at a cheap hotel in the Strand and made purchases
  under Pritchard's supervision. For the first few days he was too busy for
  reflection. Then Pritchard let him alone while he ran over to Paris, and
  Tavernake suddenly realized that he was in the city to which he had thought
  never to return. He passed the back of the theatre where he had waited for
  Beatrice, he looked up at the entrance of the Milan Court; he lunched alone,
  and with a curious mixture of feelings, at the little restaurant where he had
  supped with Beatrice. It was over, that part of his life, over and finished.
  Yet, with his natural truthfulness, he never attempted to disguise from
  himself the pain at his heart. Three times in one day he found himself, under
  some pretext or another, in Imano's Restaurant. Once, in the middle of the
  street, he burst into a fit of laughter. It was while Pritchard was in
  London, and he asked him a question.</p>

  <p>"Pritchard," he remarked, "you area man of experience. Did any one ever
  care for two women at the same time?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard removed his cigar from his teeth and stared at his
  companion.</p>

  <p>"Why, my young friend," he replied, "I've found no trouble myself in being
  fond of a dozen."</p>

  <p>Tavernake smiled and said no more. Pritchard was one of the good fellows
  of the world, but there were things which were hidden from him. Yet
  Tavernake, who had fallen into a habit, during his solitude, of analyzing his
  sensations, was puzzled by this one circumstance, that when he thought of
  Elizabeth, though his heart never failed to beat more quickly, the sense of
  shame generally stole over him; and when he thought of Beatrice, a curious
  loneliness, a loneliness that brought with it a pain, seemed suddenly to make
  the hours drag and his pleasures flavorless. For two days he was puzzled.
  Then his habit of taking long walks helped him toward a solution. In a small
  outlying music-hall in the east-end of London, he saw the same announcement
  that he had noticed in the Norfolk newspaper,&mdash;"Professor Franklin" in
  large type, and "Miss Beatrice Franklin" in small.</p>

  <p>That night he attended the music-hall. The scene was practically a
  repetition of the one in Norwich, only with additions. The professor's
  bombastic performance met with scarcely any applause. Its termination was,
  indeed, interrupted by catcalls and whistles from the gallery. Beatrice's
  songs, on the other hand, were applauded more vociferously than ever. She had
  hard work to avoid a third encore.</p>

  <p>At the end of the performance, Tavernake made his way to the stage-door
  and waited. The neighborhood was an unsavory one, and the building itself
  seemed crowded in among a row of shops of the worst order, fish stalls, and a
  glaring gin palace. Long before Beatrice came out, Tavernake could hear the
  professor's voice down the covered passage, the professor's voice apparently
  raised in anger.</p>

  <p>"Undutiful behavior, that's what I call it&mdash;undutiful!"</p>

  <p>They emerged into the street, the professor very much the same as usual;
  Beatrice paler, with a pathetic droop about her mouth. Tavernake came eagerly
  forward.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice!" he cried, holding out his hand.</p>

  <p>The professor drew back. Beatrice stood still,&mdash;for a moment it
  seemed as though she were about to faint. Tavernake grasped her hands.</p>

  <p>"I am so sorry!" he exclaimed, clumsily. "I ought not to have come up like
  that."</p>

  <p>She smiled a little wan smile.</p>

  <p>"I am quite all right," she replied, "only the heat inside was rather
  trying, and even out here the atmosphere isn't too good, is it? How did you
  find us out?"</p>

  <p>"By chance again," Tavernake answered. "I have news. May I walk with you a
  few steps?"</p>

  <p>She glanced timidly toward her father. The professor was holding aloof in
  dignified silence.</p>

  <p>"Perhaps," Tavernake said quickly, "you would take supper with me? I am
  going abroad, and I should like to say good-bye properly. A bottle of
  champagne and some supper. What do you say, Professor?"</p>

  <p>The professor suffered his features to relax.</p>

  <p>"A very admirable idea," he declared. "Where shall we go?"</p>

  <p>"Is it too late to get to Imano's?" Tavernake suggested.</p>

  <p>The professor hesitated.</p>

  <p>"A taxicab," he remarked, "would do it, if&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He paused, and Tavernake smiled.</p>

  <p>"A taxicab it shall be," he decided. "I am in funds just for the moment.
  Come along, both of you, and I'll tell you all about it."</p>

  <p>He made her take his arm, although her fingers did no more than touch his
  coat sleeve.</p>

  <p>"Pritchard came and dug me out," he continued. "I am going abroad with
  him. It's sort of prospecting in some new country at the back of British
  Columbia. We see what we can find and then go to a financier's and start
  companies, mining companies and oil fields&mdash;anything. I am off in a
  week."</p>

  <p>Beatrice half closed her eyes. They had hailed a passing cab and she sank
  back among the cushions with a sigh of relief.</p>

  <p>"Dear Leonard," she murmured, "I am so glad, so very happy for your sake.
  This is the sort of thing which I hoped would happen."</p>

  <p>"And now tell me about yourselves," he went on.</p>

  <p>There was a sudden silence. Tavernake was conscious that Beatrice's
  clothes were distinctly shabbier, that the professor's hat was shiny. The
  professor cleared his throat.</p>

  <p>"I do not wish," he said, "to intrude our private matters upon one who,
  although I will not call him a stranger, is assuredly not one of our old
  friends. At the same time, I admit that a little trouble has arisen between
  Beatrice and myself, and we were discussing it at the moment you arrived. I
  shall appeal to you now. As an unprejudiced member of the audience to-night,
  Mr. Tavernake, you will give me your honest opinion?"</p>

  <p>"Certainly," Tavernake promised, with a sinking premonition of what was to
  come.</p>

  <p>"What I complain of," the professor began, speaking with elaborate and
  impressive slowness, "is that my performance is hurried over and that too
  long a time is taken up by Beatrice's songs. The management remark upon the
  applause which her efforts occasionally ensure, but, as I would point out to
  you, sir," he continued, "a performance such as mine makes too deep an
  impression for the audience to show their appreciation of it by such vulgar
  methods as hand-clapping and whistling. You follow me, I trust, Mr.
  Tavernake?"</p>

  <p>"Why, yes, of course," Tavernake admitted.</p>

  <p>"I take a sincere and earnest interest in my work," the professor
  declared, "and I feel that when it has to be scamped that my daughter may
  sing a music-hall ditty, the result is, to say the least of it, undignified.
  For some reason or other, I have been unable to induce the management to see
  entirely with me, but my point is that Beatrice should sing one song only,
  and that the additional ten minutes should be occupied by me in either a
  further exposition of my extraordinary powers as a hypnotist, or in a little
  address to the audience upon the hidden sciences. Now I appeal to you, Mr.
  Tavernake, as a young man of common sense. What is your opinion?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake, much too honest to be capable in a general way of duplicity,
  was on the point of giving it, but he caught Beatrice's imploring gaze. Her
  lips were moving. He hesitated.</p>

  <p>"Of course," he began, slowly, "you have to try and put yourself into the
  position of the major part of the audience, who are exceedingly uneducated
  people. It is very hard to give an opinion, Professor. I must say that your
  entertainment this evening was listened to with rapt interest."</p>

  <p>The professor turned solemnly towards his daughter.</p>

  <p>"You hear that, Beatrice?" he said severely. "You hear what Mr. Tavernake
  says? 'With rapt interest!'"</p>

  <p>"At the same time," Tavernake went on, "without a doubt Miss Beatrice's
  songs were also extremely popular. It is rather a pity that the management
  could not give you a little more time."</p>

  <p>"Failing that, sir," the professor declared, "my point is, as I explained
  before, that Beatrice should give up one of her songs. What you have said
  this evening more than ever confirms me in my view."</p>

  <p>Beatrice smiled thankfully at Tavernake.</p>

  <p>"Well," she suggested, "at any rate we will leave it for the present.
  Sometimes I think, though, father, that you frighten them with some of your
  work, and you must remember that they come to be amused."</p>

  <p>"That," the professor admitted, "is the most sensible remark you have
  made, Beatrice. There is indeed something terrifying in some of my
  manifestations, terrifying even to myself, who understand so thoroughly my
  subject. However, as you say, we will dismiss the matter for the present. The
  thought of this supper party is a pleasant one. Do you remember, Mr.
  Tavernake, the night when you and I met in the balcony at Imano's?"</p>

  <p>"Perfectly well," Tavernake answered.</p>

  <p>"Now I shall test your memory," the professor continued, with a knowing
  smile. "Can you remember, sir, the brand of champagne which I was then
  drinking, and which I declared, if you recollect, was the one which best
  agreed with me, the one brand worth drinking?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid I don't remember that," Tavernake confessed. "Restaurant life
  is a thing I know so little of, and I have only drunk champagne once or twice
  in my life."</p>

  <p>"Dear, dear me!" the professor exclaimed. "You do astonish me, sir. Well,
  that brand was Veuve Clicquot, and you may take my word for it, Mr.
  Tavernake, and you may find this knowledge useful to you when you have made a
  fortune in America and have become a man of pleasure; there is no wine equal
  to it. Veuve Clicquot, sir, if possible of the year 1899, though the year
  1900 is quite drinkable."</p>

  <p>"Veuve Clicquot," Tavernake repeated. "I'll remember it for this
  evening."</p>

  <p>The professor beamed.</p>

  <p>"My dear," he said to Beatrice, "Mr. Tavernake will think that I had a
  purpose in testing his memory."</p>

  <p>Beatrice smiled.</p>

  <p>"And hadn't you, father?" she asked.</p>

  <p>They all laughed together.</p>

  <p>"Well, it is pleasant," the professor admitted, "to have one's weaknesses
  ministered to, especially when one is getting on in life," he added, with a
  ponderous sigh. "Never mind, we will think only of pleasant subjects this
  evening. It will be quite interesting, Mr. Tavernake, to hear you order the
  supper."</p>

  <p>"I sha'n't attempt it," Tavernake answered. "I shall pass it on to
  you."</p>

  <p>"This reminds me," the professor declared, "of the old days. I feel sure
  that this is going to be a thoroughly enjoyable evening. We shall think of it
  often, Mr. Tavernake, when you lie sleeping under the stars. Why, what a
  wonderful thing these taxicabs are! You see, we have arrived."</p>

  <p>They secured a small table in a corner at Imano's, and Tavernake found
  himself curiously moved as he watched Beatrice take off her worn and much
  mended gloves and look around uneasily at the other guests. Her clothes were
  indeed shabby, and there were hollows now in her cheeks.</p>

  <p>Again he felt that pain, a pain for which he could not account. Suddenly
  America seemed so far away, the loneliness of the great continent became an
  actual and appreciable thing. The professor was very much occupied ordering
  the supper. Tavernake leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"Do you remember our first supper here, Beatrice?" he asked.</p>

  <p>She nodded, with an attempt at brightness which was a little pitiful.</p>

  <p>"Yes," she replied, "I remember it quite well. And now, please, Leonard,
  don't talk to me again until I have had a glass of wine. I am tired and worn
  out, that is all."</p>

  <p>Even Tavernake knew that she was struggling against the tears which
  already dimmed her eyes. He filled her glass himself. The professor set his
  own down empty with the satisfied smile of a connoisseur.</p>

  <p>"I think," he said, "that you will agree with me about this vintage.
  Beatrice, this is what will bring color into your cheeks. My little girl," he
  continued, turning to Tavernake, "will soon need a holiday. I am hoping
  presently to be able to arrange a short tour by myself, and if so, I shall
  send her to the seaside. Now I want you particularly to try the fish
  salad&mdash;the second dish there. Beatrice, let me help you."</p>

  <p>Presently the orchestra began to play. The warmth of the room, the wine
  and the food&mdash;Tavernake had a horrible idea once that she had eaten
  nothing that day&mdash;brought back some of the color to Beatrice's cheeks
  and a little of the light to her eyes. She began to talk something in the old
  fashion. She avoided, however, any mention of that other supper they had had
  together. As time went on, the professor, who had drunk the best part of two
  bottles of wine and was talking now to a friend, became almost negligible.
  Tavernake leaned across the table.</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," he whispered, "you are not looking well. I am afraid that life
  is getting harder with you."</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I am doing what I must," she answered. "Please don't sympathize with me.
  I am hysterical, I think, tonight. It will pass off."</p>

  <p>"But, Beatrice," he ventured, timidly, "could one do nothing for you? I
  don't like these performances, and between you and me, we know they won't
  stand your father's show much longer. It will certainly come to an end soon.
  Why don't you try and get back your place at the theatre? You could still
  earn enough to keep him."</p>

  <p>"Already I have tried," she replied, sorrowfully. "My place is filled up.
  You see," she added, with a forced laugh, "I have lost some of my looks,
  Leonard. I am thinner, too. Of course, I shall be all right presently, but
  it's rather against me at these west-end places."</p>

  <p>Again he felt that pain at his heart. He was sure now that he was
  beginning to understand!</p>

  <p>"Beatrice," he whispered, "give it up&mdash;marry me I will take care of
  him."</p>

  <p>The flush of color faded from her cheeks. She shivered a little and looked
  at him piteously.</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she pleaded, "you mustn't. I really am not very strong just
  now. We have finished with all that&mdash;it distresses me."</p>

  <p>"But I mean it," he begged. "Somehow, I have felt all sorts of things
  since we came in here. I think of that night, and I believe&mdash;I do
  believe that what came to me before was madness. It was not the same."</p>

  <p>She was trembling now.</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she implored, "if you care for me at all, be quiet. Father will
  turn round directly and I can't bear it. I shall be your very faithful
  friend; I shall think of you through the long days before we meet again, but
  don't&mdash;don't spoil this last evening."</p>

  <p>The professor turned round, his face mottled, his eyes moist, a great
  good-humor apparent in his tone.</p>

  <p>"Well, I must say," he declared, "that this has been a most delightful
  evening. I feel immensely better, and you, too, I hope, Beatrice?"</p>

  <p>She nodded, smiling.</p>

  <p>"I trust that when Mr. Tavernake returns," the professor continued, "he
  will give us the opportunity of entertaining him in much the same manner. It
  will give me very much pleasure, also Beatrice. And if, sir," he proceeded,
  "during your stay in New York you will mention my name at the Goat's Club, or
  the Mosquito Club, you will, I think, find yourself received with a
  hospitality which will surprise you."</p>

  <p>Tavernake thanked him and paid the bill. They walked slowly down the room,
  and Tavernake was curiously reluctant to release the little hand which
  clasped his.</p>

  <p>"I have kept this to the last," Beatrice said, in a low tone. "Elizabeth
  is in London."</p>

  <p>He was curiously unmoved.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" he murmured.</p>

  <p>"I should like you&mdash;I think it would be well for you to go and see
  her," she went on. "You know, Leonard, you were such a strange person in
  those days. You may imagine things. You may not realize where you are. I
  think that you ought to go and see her now, now that you have lived through
  some suffering, now that you understand things better. Will you?"</p>

  <p>"Yes, I will go," Tavernake promised.</p>

  <p>Beatrice glanced round towards where her father was standing.</p>

  <p>"I don't want him to know," she whispered. "I don't want either him or
  myself to be tempted to take any of her money. She is living at Claridge's
  Hotel. Go there and see her before you leave for your new life."</p>

  <p>He stood at the door and watched them go down the Strand, the professor,
  flamboyant, walking erect with flying coat-tails, and his big cigar held
  firmly between his teeth; Beatrice, a wan figure in her black clothes,
  clinging to his arm. Tavernake watched them until they disappeared, conscious
  of a curious excitement, a strange pain, a sense of revelation. When at last
  they were out of sight and he turned back for his coat and hat, his feet were
  suddenly leaden. The band was playing the last selection&mdash;it was the air
  which Beatrice had sung only that night at the east-end music-hall. With a
  sudden overpowering impulse he turned and strode down the Strand in the
  direction where they had vanished. It was too late. There was no sign of
  them.</p>

  <h2>VI. UNDERSTANDING COMES TOO LATE</h2>

  <p class="first">Tavernake's first impression of Elizabeth was that he had
  never, even in his wildest thoughts, done her justice. He had never imagined
  her so wonderfully, so alluringly beautiful. She had received him, after a
  very long delay, in her sitting-room at Claridge's Hotel&mdash;a large
  apartment furnished more like a drawing-room. She was standing, when he
  entered, almost in the center of the room, dressed in a long lace cloak and a
  hat with a drooping black feather. She looked at him, as the door opened, as
  though for a moment half puzzled. Then she laughed softly and held out her
  hands.</p>

  <p>"Why, of course I remember you!" she exclaimed. "And to think that when I
  had your card I couldn't imagine where I had heard the name before! You are
  my dear estate agent's clerk, who wouldn't take my money, and who was so
  wretchedly rude to me twelve months ago."</p>

  <p>Tavernake was quite cool. He found himself wondering whether this was a
  pose, or whether she had indeed forgotten. He decided that it was a pose.</p>

  <p>"I was also," he reminded her, "one night in your rooms at the Milan Court
  when your husband&mdash;"</p>

  <p>She stopped him with an imperative gesture.</p>

  <p>"Spare me, please," she begged. "Those were such terrible days&mdash;so
  dull, too! I remember that you were quite one of the brightest spots. You
  were absolutely different from every one I had ever met before, and you
  interested me immensely."</p>

  <p>She looked at him and slowly shook her head.</p>

  <p>"You look very nice," she said. "Your clothes fit you and you are most
  becomingly tanned, but you don't look half so awkward and so adorable."</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he replied, shortly.</p>

  <p>"And you came to see me!" she went on. "That was really nice of you. You
  were quite fond of me, once, you know. Tell me, has it lasted?"</p>

  <p>"That is exactly what I came to find out," he answered deliberately. "So
  far, I am inclined to think that it has not lasted."</p>

  <p>She made a little wry face and drew his arm through hers.</p>

  <p>"Come and sit down and tell me why," she insisted. "Be honest, now. Is it
  because you think I am looking older?"</p>

  </div>

  <p>"I have thought of you for many hours a day for months," Tavernake said,
  slowly, "and I never imagined you so beautiful as you seem now."</p>

  <p>She clapped her hands.</p>

  <p>"And you mean it, too!" she exclaimed. "There is just the same
  delightfully convincing note in your tone. I am sure that you mean it. Please
  go on adoring me, Mr. Tavernake. I have no one who interests me at all just
  now. There is an Italian Count who wants to marry me, but he is terribly
  poor; and a young Australian, who follows me everywhere, but I am not sure
  about him. There is an English boy, too, who is going to commit suicide if I
  don't say 'yes' to him this week. On the whole, I think I am rather sorry
  that people know I am a widow. Tell me, Mr. Tavernake, are you going to adore
  me, too?"</p>

  <p>"I don't think so," Tavernake answered. "I rather believe that I am
  cured."</p>

  <p>She shrugged her shoulders and laughed musically.</p>

  <p>"But you say that you still think I am beautiful," she went on, "and I am
  sure my clothes are perfect&mdash;they came straight from Paris. I hope you
  appreciate this lace," she added, drawing it through her fingers. "My figure
  is just as good, too, isn't it?"</p>

  <p>She stood up and turned slowly round. Then she sat down suddenly, taking
  his hand in hers.</p>

  <p>"Please don't say that you think I have grown less attractive," she
  begged.</p>

  <p>"As regards your personal attractions," Tavernake replied, "I imagine that
  they are at least as great as ever. If you want the truth, I think that the
  reason I do not adore you any longer is because I saw your sister last
  night."</p>

  <p>"Saw Beatrice!" she exclaimed. "Where?"</p>

  <p>"She was singing at a miserable east-end music-hall so that her father
  might find some sort of employment," Tavernake said. "The people only forbore
  to hiss her father's turn for her sake. She goes about the country with him.
  Heaven knows what they earn, but it must be little enough! Beatrice is shabby
  and thin and pale. She is devoting the best years of her life to what she
  imagines to be her duty."</p>

  <p>"And how does this affect me?" Elizabeth asked, coldly.</p>

  <p>"Only in this way," Tavernake answered. "You asked me how it was that I
  could find you as beautiful as ever and adore you no longer. The reason is
  because I know you to be wretchedly selfish. I believed in you before.
  Everything that you did seemed right. That was because I was a fool, because
  you had filled my brain with impossible fancies, because I saw you and
  everything that you did through a distorted mirror."</p>

  <p>"Have you come here to be rude?" she asked him.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," he replied. "I came here to see whether I was
  cured."</p>

  <p>She began to laugh, very softly at first, but soon she threw herself back
  among the cushions and laid her hand caressingly upon his shoulder.</p>

  <p>"Oh, you are just the same!" she cried. "Just the same dear, truthful
  bundle of honesty and awkwardness and ignorance. So you are going to be
  victim of Beatrice's bow and spear, after all."</p>

  <p>"I have asked your sister to marry me," Tavernake admitted. "She will
  not."</p>

  <p>"She was very wise," Elizabeth declared, wiping the tears from her eyes.
  "As an experience you are delightful. As a husband you would be terribly
  impossible. Are you going to stay and take me out to dinner this evening? I'm
  sure you have a dress suit now."</p>

  <p>Tavernake shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said. "I have already an engagement."</p>

  <p>She looked at him curiously. Was it really true that he had become
  indifferent? She was not used to men who escaped.</p>

  <p>"Tell me," she asked, abruptly, "why did you come? I don't understand. You
  are here, and you pass your time being rude to me. I ask you to take me to
  dinner and you refuse. Do you know that scarcely a man in London would not
  have jumped at such a chance?"</p>

  <p>"Very likely," Tavernake answered. "I have no experience in such matters.
  I only know that I am going to do something else."</p>

  <p>"Something you want to do very much?" she whispered.</p>

  <p>"I am going down to a little music-hall in Whitechapel," Tavernake said,
  "and I am going to meet your sister and I am going to put her in a cab and
  take her to have some supper, and I am going to worry her until she promises
  to be my wife."</p>

  <p>"You are certainly a devoted admirer of the family," she laughed. "Perhaps
  you were in love with her all the time."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I was," he admitted.</p>

  <p>She shook her head.</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," she said. "I think you were quite fond of me once.
  You have such absurdly old-fashioned ideas or I think that you would be fond
  of me now."</p>

  <p>Tavernake rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"I am going," he declared. "This will be good-bye. To-morrow I am going to
  British Columbia."</p>

  <p>The laughter faded for a moment from her face. She was suddenly
  serious.</p>

  <p>"Don't go," she begged. "Listen. I know I am not good like Beatrice, but I
  do like you&mdash;I always did. I suppose it is that wonderful truthfulness
  of yours. You are a different type from the men one meets. I am rather a
  reckless person. It is such a comfort sometimes to meet any one like you. You
  seem such an anchorage. Stay and talk to me for a little time. Take me out
  to-night. You asked me to go with you once, you know, and I would not.
  To-night it is I who ask you."</p>

  <p>He shook his head slowly.</p>

  <p>"This is good-bye!" he said, firmly. "I suppose, after all, you were not
  unkind to me in those days, but you taught me a very bitter lesson. I came to
  you to-day in fear and trembling. I was afraid, perhaps, that the worst was
  not over, that there was more yet to come. Now I know that I am free."</p>

  <p>She stamped her foot.</p>

  <p>"You shall not go away like that," she declared.</p>

  <p>He smiled.</p>

  <p>"Do you think I do not understand?" he continued. "It is only because I am
  able to go, because the touch of your fingers, that look in your eyes, do not
  drive me half mad now, that you want me to stay. You would like to try your
  powers once more. I think not. I am satisfied that I am cured indeed, but
  perhaps it is safer to risk nothing."</p>

  <p>She pointed to the door.</p>

  <p>"Very well, then," she ordered, "you can go."</p>

  <p>He bowed, and already his fingers were on the handle. Suddenly she called
  to him.</p>

  <p>"Leonard! Leonard!"</p>

  <p>He turned round. She was coming towards him with her arms outstretched,
  her eyes were full of tears, there were sobs in her voice.</p>

  <p>"I am so lonely," she begged. "I have thought of you so much. Don't go
  away unkindly. Stay with me for this evening, at any rate. You can see
  Beatrice at any time. It is I who need you most now."</p>

  <p>He looked around at the splendid apartment; he looked at the woman whose
  fingers, glittering with jewels, rested upon his shoulders. Then he thought
  of Beatrice in her shabby black gown and wan little face, and very gently he
  removed her hands.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, "I do not think that you need me any more than I need you.
  This is a caprice of yours. You know it and I know it. Is it worth while to
  play with one another?"</p>

  <p>Her hands fell to her sides. She turned half away but she said nothing.
  Tavernake, with a sudden impulse which had in it nothing of
  passion&mdash;very little, indeed, of affection&mdash;lifted her fingers to
  his lips and passed out of the room. He descended the stairs, filled with a
  wonderful sense of elation, a buoyancy of spirit which he could not
  understand. As he walked blithely to his hotel, however, he began to realize
  how much he had dreaded this interview. He was a free man, after all. The
  spell was broken. He could think of her now as she deserved to be thought of,
  as a consummate woman of the world, selfish, heartless, conscienceless. He
  was well out of her toils. It was nothing to him if even he had known that at
  that moment she was lying upon the sofa to which she had staggered as he left
  the room, weeping bitterly.</p>

  <p>For over an hour Tavernake endured the smells and the bad atmosphere of
  that miserable little music-hall, watching eagerly each time the numbers were
  changed. Then at last, towards the end of the program, the manager appeared
  in front.</p>

  <p>"Ladies and gentlemen," he announced, "I regret very much to inform you
  that owing to the indisposition of the young lady, Miss Beatrice Franklin and
  her father are unable to appear to-night. I have pleasure in announcing an
  extra turn, namely the Sisters De Vere in their wonderful burlesque act."</p>

  <p>There was a murmur of disapprobation mingled with some cheering. Tavernake
  left his place and walked around to the back of the hall. Presently the
  manager came out to him.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry to trouble you, sir," Tavernake said, "but I heard your
  announcement just now from the front. Can you give me the address of
  Professor Franklin? I am a friend, and I should like to go and see them."</p>

  <p>The manager pointed to the stage-doorkeeper.</p>

  <p>"This man will give it you," he announced, shortly. "It's quite close. I
  shall look in myself after the show to know how the young lady is."</p>

  <p>Tavernake procured the address and set out in the taxicab which he had
  kept waiting. The driver listened to the direction doubtfully.</p>

  <p>"It's a poor sort of neighborhood, sir," he remarked.</p>

  <p>"We've got to go there," Tavernake told him.</p>

  <p>They reached it in a few minutes, a miserable street indeed. Tavernake
  knocked at the door of the house to which he was directed, with sinking
  heart. A man, collarless and half dressed, in carpet slippers, opened the
  door after a few moments' waiting.</p>

  <p>"Well, what is it?" he asked, gruffly.</p>

  <p>"Is Professor Franklin here?" Tavernake inquired.</p>

  <p>The man seemed as though he were about to slam the door, but thought
  better of it.</p>

  <p>"If you're a friend of the professor's, as he calls himself," he said,
  "and you've any money to shell out, why, you're welcome, but if you're only
  asking out of curiosity, let me tell you that he used to lodge here but he's
  gone, and if I'd had my way he'd have gone a week ago, him and his daughter,
  too."</p>

  <p>"I don't understand," Tavernake protested. "I thought the young lady was
  ill."</p>

  <p>"She may be ill or she may not," the man replied, sulkily. "All I know is
  that they couldn't pay their rent, couldn't pay their food bill, couldn't pay
  for the drinks the old man was always sending out for. So tonight I spoke up
  and they've gone."</p>

  <p>"At least you know where to!" Tavernake exclaimed.</p>

  <p>"I ain't no sort of an idea," the man declared. "Take my word for it
  straight, guvnor, I know no more about where they went to than the man in the
  moon, except that I'm well shut of them, and there's a matter of eighteen and
  sixpence, if you care to pay it."</p>

  <p>"I'll give you a sovereign," Tavernake promised, "if you will tell me
  where they are now."</p>

  <p>"What's the good of making silly conditions like that!" the man grumbled.
  "If I knew where they were, I'd earn the quid soon enough, but I don't, and
  that's the long and the short of it! And if you ain't going to pay the
  eighteen and six, well, I've answered all the questions I feel inclined
  to."</p>

  <p>"I'll make it two pounds," Tavernake promised. "I'm going to sail for
  America to-morrow morning early, and I must see them first."</p>

  <p>The man leaned forward.</p>

  <p>"Look here," he said, "if I knew where they was, a quid would be quite
  good enough for me, but I don't, and that's straight. If you want to look for
  them, I should try one of the doss houses. As likely there as anywhere."</p>

  <p>He slammed the door and Tavernake turned away. A sudden despair had seized
  him. He looked up and down the street, he looked away beyond and thought of
  the miles and miles of streets, the myriads of chimneys, the huge branches of
  the great city stretching far and wide. At eight o'clock the next morning, he
  must leave for Southampton. Was it too late, after all, that he had
  discovered the truth?</p>

  <h2>VII. IN A VIRGIN COUNTRY</h2>

  <p class="first">One night Tavernake began to laugh. He had grown a long
  brown beard and the hair was over his ears. He was wearing a gray flannel
  shirt, a handkerchief tied around his neck, and a pair of worn riding
  breeches held up by a belt. He had kicked his boots off at the end of a long
  day, and was lying in the moonlight before a fire of pine logs, whose smoke
  went straight to the star-hung sky. No word had been spoken for the last
  hour. Tavernake's fit of mirth came with as little apparent reason as the
  puffs of wind which every now and then stole down from the mountain side and
  made faint music in the virgin forests.</p>

  <p>Pritchard turned over on his side and looked at him. Cigars had for many
  weeks been an unknown thing, and he was smoking a corn-cob pipe full of
  coarse tobacco.</p>

  <p>"Stumbled across a joke anywhere?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid no one but myself would see the humor of it," Tavernake
  answered. "I was thinking of those days in London; I was thinking of
  Beatrice's horror when she discovered that I was wearing ready-made clothes,
  and the amazement of Elizabeth when she found that I hadn't a dress suit.
  It's odd how cramped life gets back there."</p>

  <p>Pritchard nodded, pressing the tobacco down into the bowl of his pipe with
  his forefinger.</p>

  <p>"You're right, Tavernake," he agreed. "One loses one's sense of
  proportion. Men in the cities are all alike. They go about in disguise."</p>

  <p>"I should like," Tavernake said, inconsequently, "to have Mr. Dowling out
  here."</p>

  <p>"Amusing fellow?" Pritchard inquired.</p>

  <p>Tavernake shook his head, smiling.</p>

  <p>"Not in the least," he answered, "only he was a very small man. Out here
  it is difficult to keep small. Don't you feel it, Pritchard? These mountains
  make our hills at home seem like dust-heaps. The skies seem loftier. Look
  down into that valley. It's gigantic, immense."</p>

  <p>Pritchard yawned.</p>

  <p>"There's a little place in the Bowery," he began,&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't want to know any more about New York," Tavernake interrupted.
  "Lean back and close your eyes, smell the cinnamon trees, listen to that
  night bird calling every now and then across the ravine. There's blackness,
  if you like; there's depth. It's like a cloak of velvet to look into. But you
  can't see the bottom&mdash;no, not in the daytime. Listen!"</p>

  <p>Pritchard sat up. For a few moments neither spoke. A dozen yards or so
  off, a scattered group&mdash;the rest of the party&mdash;were playing cards
  around a fire. The green wood crackled, an occasional murmur of voices, a
  laugh or an exclamation, came to their ears, but for the rest, an immense, a
  wonderful silence, a silence which seemed to spread far away over that weird,
  half-invisible world! Tavernake listened reverently.</p>

  <p>"Isn't it marvelous!" he exclaimed. "We haven't seen a human being except
  our own party, for three days. There probably isn't one within hearing of us
  now. Very likely no living person has ever set foot in this precise
  spot."</p>

  <p>"Oh, it's big," Pritchard admitted, "it's big and it's restful, but it
  isn't satisfying. It does for you for a time because you started life wrong
  and you needed a reaction. But for me&mdash;ah, well!" he added, "I hear the
  call right across these thousands of miles of forests and valley and swamp. I
  hear the electric cars and the clash of the overhead railway, I see the
  flaring lights of Broadway and I hear the babel of tongues. I am going back
  to it, Tavernake. There's plenty to go on with. We've done more than carry
  out our program."</p>

  <p>"Back to New York!" Tavernake muttered, disconsolately.</p>

  <p>"So you're not ready yet?" Pritchard demanded.</p>

  <p>"Heavens, no!" Tavernake answered. "Who would be? What is there in New
  York to make up for this?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard was silent for a moment.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "one of us must be getting back near civilization. The
  syndicate will be expecting to hear from us. Besides, we've reports enough
  already. It's time something was decided about that oil country. We've done
  some grand work there, Tavernake."</p>

  <p>Tavernake nodded. He was lying on his side and his eyes were fixed
  wistfully southward, over the glimmering moonlit valley, over the great
  wilderness of virgin pine woods which hung from the mountains on the other
  side, away through the cleft in the hills to the plains beyond, chaotic, a
  world unseen.</p>

  <p>"If you like to go on for a bit," Pritchard suggested, slowly, "there's no
  reason why you shouldn't take McCleod and Richardson with you, and Pete and
  half the horses, and strike for the tin country on the other side of the
  Yolite Hills. So long as we are here, it's quite worth it, if you can stick
  it out."</p>

  <p>Tavernake drew a long breath.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to go," he admitted, simply. "I know McCleod is keen about
  prospecting further south. You see, most of our finds so far have been among
  the oil fields."</p>

  <p>"Settled," Pritchard declared. "To-morrow, then, we part. I'm for the
  valley, and I reckon I'll strike the railway to Chicago in a week. Gee whiz!
  New York will seem good!"</p>

  <p>"You think that the syndicate will be satisfied with what we have done so
  far?" Tavernake asked.</p>

  <p>His companion smiled.</p>

  <p>"If they aren't, they'll be fools. I reckon there's enough oil fields here
  for seven companies. There'll be a bit for us, too, Tavernake, I guess. Don't
  you want to come back to New York and spend it?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake laughed once more, but this time his laugh was not wholly
  natural.</p>

  <p>"Spend it!" he repeated. "What is there to spend it on? Uncomfortable
  clothes, false plays, drinks that are bad for you, food that's half poisoned,
  atmosphere that stifles. My God, Pritchard, is there anything in the world
  like this! Stretch out your arms, man. Lie on your back, look up at the
  stars, let that wind blow over your face. Listen."</p>

  <p>They listened, and again they heard nothing, yet again there seemed to be
  that peculiar quality about the silence which spoke of the vastness of
  space.</p>

  <p>Pritchard rose to his feet.</p>

  <p>"New York and the fleshpots for me," he declared. "Keep in touch, and good
  luck old man!"</p>

  <p>Next day at dawn they parted, and Tavernake, with his three companions,
  set his face towards an almost undiscovered tract of land. Their progress was
  slow, for they were all the time in a country rich with possibilities. For
  weeks they climbed, climbed till they reached the snows and the wind stung
  their faces and they shivered in their rugs at night. They came to a land of
  sparser vegetation, of fewer and wilder animals, where they heard the baying
  of wolves at night, and saw the eyes of strange animals glisten through the
  thicket as the flames of their evening fire shot up toward the sky. Then the
  long descent began, the long descent to the great plain. Now their faces were
  bronzed with a sun ever hotter, ever more powerful. No longer the snow flakes
  beat their cheeks. They came slowly down into a land which seemed to
  Tavernake like the biblical land of Canaan. Three times in ten days they had
  to halt and make a camp, while Tavernake prepared a geographical survey of
  likely-looking land.</p>

  <p>McCleod came up to Tavernake one day with a dull-looking lump in his hand,
  glistening in places.</p>

  <p>"Copper," he announced, shortly. "It's what I've been looking for all the
  time. No end to it. There's something bigger than oil here."</p>

  <p>They spent a month in the locality, and every day McCleod became more
  enthusiastic. After that it was hard work to keep him from heading homeward
  at once.</p>

  <p>"I tell you, sir," he explained to Tavernake, "there's millions there,
  millions between those four stakes of yours. What's the good of more
  prospecting? There's enough there in a square acre to pay the expenses of our
  expedition a thousand times over. Let's get back and make reports. We can
  strike the railway in ten days from here&mdash;perhaps sooner."</p>

  <p>"You go," Tavernake said. "Leave me Pete and two of the horses."</p>

  <p>The man stared at him in surprise.</p>

  <p>"What's the good of going on alone?" he asked. "You're not a mining expert
  or an oil man. You can't go prospecting by yourself."</p>

  <p>"I can't help it," Tavernake answered. "It's something in my blood, I
  suppose. I am going on. Think! You'll strike that railway and in a month you
  will be back in New York. Don't you imagine, when you're there, when you hear
  the clatter and turmoil of it, when you see the pale crowds chivvying one
  another about to pick the dollars from each other's pockets,&mdash;don't you
  believe you'll long for these solitudes, the big empty places, great
  possibilities, the silence? Think of it, man. What is there beyond those
  mountains, I wonder?"</p>

  <p>McCleod sighed.</p>

  <p>"You're right," he said. "One may never get so far out again. Our fortunes
  will keep, I suppose, and anyhow we ought to strike a telegraph station in
  about a fortnight. We'll go right ahead, then."</p>

  <p>In ten days they dropped ten thousand feet. They came to a land where
  their throats were always dry, where the trees and shrubs seemed like
  property affairs from a theatre, where they plunged their heads into every
  pool that came to wash their noses and mouths from the red dust that seemed
  to choke them up. They found tin and oil and more copper. Then, by slow
  stages, they passed on to a land of great grassy plains, of blue grass, miles
  and miles of it, and suddenly one day they came to the telegraph posts, rough
  pine trees unstripped of their bark, with a few sagging wires. Tavernake
  looked at them as Robinson Crusoe might have looked at Man Friday's
  footsteps. It was the first sign of human life which they had seen for
  months.</p>

  <p>"It's a real world we are in, after all!" he sighed. "Somehow or other, I
  thought&mdash;I thought we'd escaped."</p>

  <h2>VIII. BACK TO CIVILIZATION</h2>

  <p class="first">Pritchard, trim and neat, a New Yorker from the careful
  arrangement of his tie to the tips of his patent boots, gazed with something
  like amazement at the man whom he had come to meet at the Grand Central
  Station. Tavernake looked, indeed, like some splendid bushman whose life has
  been spent in the kingdom of the winds and the sun and the rain. He was
  inches broader round the chest, and carried himself with a new freedom. His
  face was bronzed right down to the neck. His beard was fullgrown, his clothes
  travel-stained and worn. He seemed like a breath of real life in the great
  New York depot, surrounded by streams of black-coated, pale-cheeked men.</p>

  <p>Pritchard laughed softly as he passed his arm through his friend's.</p>

  <p>"Come, my Briton," he said, "my primitive man, I have rooms for you in a
  hotel close here. A bath and a mint julep, then I'll take you to a tailor's.
  What about the big country? It's better than your salt marshes, eh? Better
  than your little fishing village? Better than building boats?"</p>

  <p>"You know it," Tavernake answered. "I feel as though I'd been drawing in
  life for month after month. Have I got to wear boots like
  yours&mdash;patent?"</p>

  <p>"Got to be done," Pritchard declared.</p>

  <p>"And the hat&mdash;oh, my Heavens!" Tavernake groaned. "I'll never become
  civilized again."</p>

  <p>"We'll see," Pritchard laughed. "Say, Tavernake, it was a great trip of
  ours. Everything's turning out marvelously. The oil and the copper are big,
  man&mdash;big, I tell you. I reckon your five thousand dollars will be well
  on the way to half a million. I'm pretty near there myself."</p>

  <p>It was not until later on, when he was alone, that Tavernake realized with
  how little interest he listened to his companion's talk of their success. It
  was so short a time ago since the building up of a fortune had been the one
  aim upon which every nerve of his body was centered. Curiously enough, now he
  seemed to take it as a matter of course.</p>

  <p>"On second thoughts, I'll send a tailor round to the hotel," Pritchard
  declared. "I've rooms myself next yours. We can go out and buy boots and the
  other things afterwards."</p>

  <p>By nightfall, Tavernake's wardrobe was complete. Even Pritchard regarded
  him with a certain surprise. He seemed, somehow, to have gained a new
  dignity.</p>

  <p>"Say, but you look great!" he exclaimed. "They won't believe it at the
  meeting to-morrow that you are the man who crossed the Yolite Mountains and
  swam the Peraneek River. That's a wonderful country you were in, Tavernake,
  after you left the tracks."</p>

  <p>They were in Broadway, with the roar of the city in their ears, and
  Tavernake, lifting his face starwards, suddenly seemed to feel the silence
  once more, the perfume of the pine woods, the scent of nature herself, freed
  through all these generations of any presence of man.</p>

  <p>"I'll never keep away from it," he said, softly. "I'll have to go
  back."</p>

  <p>Pritchard smiled.</p>

  <p>"When your report's in shape and the dollars are being scooped in, they'll
  send you back fast enough&mdash;that is, if you still want to go," he
  remarked. "I tell you, Leonard Tavernake, our city men here are out for the
  dollars. Over on your side, a man makes a million or so and he's had enough.
  One fortune here only seems to whet the appetite of a New Yorker. By the
  way," he added, after a moment's hesitation, "does it interest you to know
  that an old friend of yours is in New York?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake's head went round swiftly.</p>

  <p>"Who is it?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. Wenham Gardner."</p>

  <p>Tavernake set his teeth.</p>

  <p>"No," he said, slowly, "I don't know that that interests me."</p>

  <p>"Glad of it," Pritchard went on. "I can tell you I don't think things have
  been going extra well with the lady. She's spent most of what she got from
  the Gardner family, and she doesn't seem to have had the best of luck with
  it, either. I came across her by accident. She is staying at a flashy hotel,
  but it's in the wrong quarter&mdash;second-rate&mdash;quite second-rate."</p>

  <p>"I wonder whether we shall see anything of her," Tavernake remarked.</p>

  <p>"Do you want to?" Pritchard asked. "She'll probably be at Martin's for
  lunch, at the Plaza for tea, and Rector's for supper. She's not exactly the
  lady to remain hidden, you know."</p>

  <p>"We'll avoid those places, then, if you are taking me around," Tavernake
  said.</p>

  <p>"You're cured, are you?" Pritchard inquired.</p>

  <p>"Yes, I am cured," Tavernake answered, "cured of that and a great many
  other things, thanks to you. You found me the right tonic."</p>

  <p>"Tonic," Pritchard repeated, meditatively. "That reminds me. This way for
  the best cocktail in New York."...</p>

  <p>The night was not to pass, however, without its own especial thrill for
  Tavernake. The two men dined together at Delmonico's and went afterwards to a
  roof garden, a new form of entertainment for Tavernake, and one which
  interested him vastly. They secured one of the outside tables near the
  parapets, and below them New York stretched, a flaming phantasmagoria of
  lights and crude buildings. Down the broad avenues with their towering
  blocks, their street cars striking fire all the time like toys below, the
  people streamed like insects away to the Hudson, where the great ferry boats,
  ablaze with lights, went screaming across the dark waters. Tavernake leaned
  over and forgot. There was so much that was amazing in this marvelous city
  for a man who had only just begun to find himself.</p>

  <p>The orchestra, stationed within a few yards of him, commenced to play a
  popular waltz, and Pritchard to talk. Tavernake turned his fascinated eyes
  from the prospect below.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," Pritchard said, "you are up against it to-night. Take a
  drink of your wine and then brace yourself."</p>

  <p>Tavernake did as he was told.</p>

  <p>"What is this danger?" he asked. "What's wrong, anyway?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard had no need to answer. As Tavernake set his glass down, his eyes
  fell upon the little party who had just taken the table almost next to
  theirs. There were Walter Crease, Major Post, two men whom he had never seen
  before in his life&mdash;heavy of cheek, both, dull-eyed, but dressed with a
  rigid observance of the fashion of the city, in short dinner coats and black
  ties. And between them was Elizabeth. Tavernake gripped the sides of his
  chair and looked. Yes, she had altered. Her eyebrows were a trifle made up,
  there was a tinge in her hair which he did not recognize, a touch of color in
  her cheeks which he doubted. Yet her figure and her wonderful presence
  remained, that art of wearing her clothes as no other woman could. She was
  easily the most noticeable-looking of her sex among all the people there.
  Tavernake heard the sound of her voice and once more the thrill came and
  passed. She was the same Elizabeth. Thank God, he thought, that he was not
  the same Tavernake!</p>

  <p>"Do you wish to go?" Pritchard asked.</p>

  <p>Tavernake shook his head.</p>

  <p>"Not I!" he answered. "This place is far too fascinating. Can't we have
  some more wine? This is my treat. And, Pritchard, why do you look at me like
  that? You are not supposing for a moment that I am capable of making an ass
  of myself again?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard smiled in a relieved fashion.</p>

  <p>"My young friend," he said, "I have lived in the world so long and seen so
  many strange things, especially between men and women, that I am never
  surprised at anything. I thought you'd shed your follies as your grip upon
  life had tightened, but one is never sure."</p>

  <p>Tavernake sighed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I have shed the worst of my follies!" he answered. "I only
  wish&mdash;"</p>

  <p>He never finished his sentence. Elizabeth had suddenly seen him. For a
  moment she leaned forward as though to assure herself that she was not
  mistaken. Then she half sprang to her feet and sat down again. Her lips were
  parted&mdash;she was once more bewilderingly beautiful.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Tavernake," she cried, "come and speak to me at once."</p>

  <p>Tavernake rose without hesitation, and walked firmly across the few yards
  which separated them. She held out both her hands.</p>

  <p>"This is wonderful!" she exclaimed. "You in New York! And I have wondered
  so often what became of you."</p>

  <p>Tavernake smiled.</p>

  <p>"It is my first night here," he said. "For two years I have been
  prospecting in the far west."</p>

  <p>"Then I saw your name in the papers," she declared. "It was for the
  Manhattan Syndicate, wasn't it?"</p>

  <p>Tavernake nodded, and one of the men of the party leaned forward with
  interest.</p>

  <p>"You're going to make millions and millions," she assured him. "You always
  knew you would, didn't you?"</p>

  <p>"I am afraid that I was almost too confident," he answered. "But certainly
  we have been quite fortunate."</p>

  <p>One of Elizabeth's companions intervened&mdash;he was the one who had
  pricked up his ears at the mention of the Manhattan Syndicate.</p>

  <p>"Say, Elizabeth," he remarked, "I'd like to meet your friend."</p>

  <p>Elizabeth, with a frown, performed the introduction.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Anthony Cruxhall&mdash;Mr. Tavernake!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Cruxhall held out a fat white hand, on the little finger of which
  glittered a big diamond ring.</p>

  <p>"Say, are you the Mr. Tavernake that was surveyor to the prospecting party
  sent out by the Manhattan Syndicate?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I was," Tavernake admitted, briefly. "I still am, I hope."</p>

  <p>"Then you're just the man I was hoping to meet," Mr. Cruxhall declared.
  "Won't you sit down with us right here? I'd like to talk some about that
  trip. I'm interested in the Syndicate."</p>

  <p>Tavernake shook his head.</p>

  <p>"I've had enough of work for a time," he said. "Besides, I couldn't talk
  about it till after my report to the meeting to-morrow."</p>

  <p>"Just a few words," Mr. Cruxhall persisted. "We'll have a bottle of
  champagne, eh?"</p>

  <p>"You will excuse me, I am sure," Tavernake replied, "when I tell you that
  it would not be correct on my part to discuss my trip until after I have
  handed in my report to the company. I am very glad to have seen you again,
  Mrs. Gardner."</p>

  <p>"But you are not going!" she exclaimed, in dismay.</p>

  <p>"I have left Mr. Pritchard alone," Tavernake answered.</p>

  <p>Elizabeth smiled, and waved her hand to the solitary figure.</p>

  <p>"Our friend Mr. Pritchard again," she remarked. "Well, it is really a
  curious meeting, isn't it? I wonder,"&mdash;she lifted her head to his and
  her eyes called him closer to hers&mdash;"have you forgotten everything?"</p>

  <p>He pointed over the roofs of the houses. His back was to the river and he
  pointed westward.</p>

  <p>"I have been in a country where one forgets," he answered. "I think that I
  have thrown the knapsack of my follies away. I think that it is buried. There
  are some things which I do not forget, but they are scarcely to be spoken
  of."</p>

  <p>"You are a strange young man," she said. "Was I wrong, or were you not
  once in love with me?"</p>

  <p>"I was terribly in love with you," Tavernake confessed.</p>

  <p>"Yet you tore up my cheque and flung yourself away when you found out that
  my standard of morals was not quite what you had expected," she murmured.
  "Haven't you got over that quixoticism a little, Leonard?"</p>

  <p>He drew a deep sigh.</p>

  <p>"I am thankful to say," he declared, earnestly, "that I have not got over
  it, that, if anything, my prejudices are stronger than ever."</p>

  <p>She sat for a moment quite still, and her face had become hard and
  expressionless. She was looking past him, past the line of lights, out into
  the blue darkness.</p>

  <p>"Somehow," she said, softly, "I always prayed that you might remember. You
  were the one true thing I had ever met, you were in earnest. It is past,
  then?"</p>

  <p>"It is past," Tavernake answered, bravely.</p>

  <p>The music of a Hungarian waltz came floating down to them. She half closed
  her eyes. Her head moved slowly with the melody. Tavernake looked away.</p>

  <p>"Will you come and see me just once?" she asked, suddenly. "I am staying
  at the Delvedere, in Forty-Second Street."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," Tavernake replied. "I do not know how long I shall
  be in New York. If I am here for a few days, I shall take my chance at
  finding you at home."</p>

  <p>He bowed, and returned to Pritchard, who welcomed him with a quiet
  smile.</p>

  <p>"You're wise, Tavernake," he said, softly. "I could hear no words, but I
  know that you have been wise. Between you and me," he added, in a lower tone,
  "she is going downhill. She is in with the wrong lot here. She can't seem to
  keep away from them. They are on the very fringe of Bohemia, a great deal
  nearer the arm of the law than makes for respectable society. The man to whom
  I saw you introduced is a millionaire one day and a thief the next. They're
  none of them any good. Did you notice, too, that she is wearing sham jewelry?
  That always looks bad."</p>

  <p>"No, I didn't notice," Tavernake answered.</p>

  <p>He was silent for a moment. Then he leaned a little forward.</p>

  <p>"I wonder," he asked, "do you know anything about her sister?"</p>

  <p>Pritchard finished his wine and knocked the ash from his cigar.</p>

  <p>"Not much," he replied. "I believe she had a very hard time. She took on
  the father, you know, the old professor, and did her best to keep him
  straight. He died about a year ago and Miss Beatrice tried to get back into
  the theatre, but she'd missed her chance. Theatrical business has been
  shocking in London. I heard she'd come out here. Wherever she is, she keeps
  right away from that sort of set," he wound up, moving his head towards
  Elizabeth's friends.</p>

  <p>"I wonder if she is in New York," Tavernake said, with a strange thrill at
  his heart.</p>

  <p>Pritchard made no reply. His eyes were fixed upon the little group at the
  next table. Elizabeth was leaning back in her chair. She seemed to have
  abandoned the conversation. Her eyes were always seeking Tavernake's.
  Pritchard rose to his feet abruptly.</p>

  <p>"It's time we were in bed," he declared. "Remember the meeting
  to-morrow."</p>

  <p>Tavernake rose to his feet. As they passed the next table, Elizabeth
  leaned over to him. Her eyes pleaded with his almost passionately.</p>

  <p>"Dear Leonard," she whispered, "you must&mdash;you must come and see me. I
  shall stay in between four and six every evening this week. The Delvedere,
  remember."</p>

  <p>"Thank you very much," Tavernake answered. "I shall not forget."</p>

  <h2>IX. FOR ALWAYS</h2>

  <p class="first">Once again it seemed to Beatrice that history was repeating
  itself. The dingy, oblong dining-room, with its mosquito netting, stained
  tablecloth, and hard cane chairs, expanded until she fancied herself in the
  drawing-room of Blenheim House. Between the landladies there was little
  enough to choose. Mrs. Raithby Lawrence, notwithstanding her caustic tongue
  and suspicious nature, had at least made some pretense at gentility. The
  woman who faced her now&mdash;hard-featured, with narrow, suspicious eyes and
  a mass of florid hair&mdash;was unmistakably and brutally vulgar.</p>

  <p>"What's the good of your keeping on saying you hope to get an engagement
  next week?" she demanded, with a sneer. "Who's likely to engage you? Why,
  you've lost your color and your looks and your weight since you came to stay
  here. They don't want such as you in the chorus. And for the rest, you're too
  high and mighty, that's my opinion of you. Take what you can get, and how you
  can get it, and be thankful,&mdash;that's my motto. Day after day you tramp
  about the streets with your head in the air, and won't take this and won't
  take that, and meanwhile my bill gets bigger and bigger. Now where have you
  been to this morning, I should like to know?"</p>

  <p>Beatrice, who was faint and tired, shaking in every limb, tried to pass
  out of the room, but her questioner barred the way.</p>

  <p>"I have been up town," she answered, nervously.</p>

  <p>"Hear of anything?"</p>

  <p>Beatrice shook her head.</p>

  <p>"Not yet. Please let me go upstairs and lie down. I am tired and I need to
  rest."</p>

  <p>"And I need my money," Mrs. Selina P. Watkins declared, without quitting
  her position, "and it's no good your going up to your room because the door's
  locked."</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" Beatrice faltered.</p>

  <p>"I mean that I've done with you," the lodging-house keeper announced.
  "Your room's locked up and the key's in my pocket, and the sooner you get out
  of this, the better I shall be pleased."</p>

  <p>"But my box&mdash;my clothes," Beatrice cried.</p>

  <p>"I'll keep 'em a week for you," the woman answered. "Bring me the money by
  then and you shall have them. If I don't hear anything of you, they'll go to
  the auction mart."</p>

  <p>Something of her old spirit fired the girl for a moment. She was angry,
  and she forgot that her knees were trembling with fatigue, that she was weak
  and aching with hunger.</p>

  <p>"How dare you talk like that!" she exclaimed. "You shall have your money
  shortly, but I must have my clothes. I cannot go anywhere without them."</p>

  <p>The woman laughed harshly.</p>

  <p>"Look here, my young lady," she said, "you'll see your box again when I
  see the color of your money, and not before. And now out you go,
  please,&mdash;out you go! If you're going to make any trouble, Solly will
  have to show you the way down the steps."</p>

  <p>The woman had opened the door, and a colored servant, half dressed, with a
  broom in her hand, came slouching down the passage. Beatrice turned and fled
  out of the greasy, noisome atmosphere, down the wooden, uneven steps, out
  into the ugly street. She turned toward the nearest elevated as though by
  instinct, but when she came to the bottom of the stairs she stopped short
  with a little groan. She knew very well that she had not a nickel to pay the
  fare. Her pockets were empty. All day she had eaten nothing, and her last
  coin had gone for the car which had brought her back from Broadway. And here
  she was on the other side of New York, in the region of low-class lodging
  houses, with the Bowery between her and Broadway. She had neither the
  strength nor the courage to walk. With a half-stifled sob she took off her
  one remaining ornament, a cheap enameled brooch, and entered a pawnbroker's
  shop close to where she had been standing.</p>

  <p>"Will you give me something on this, please?" she asked, desperately.</p>

  <p>A man who seemed to be sorting a pile of ready-made coats, paused in his
  task for a moment, took the ornament into his hand, and threw it
  contemptuously upon the counter.</p>

  <p>"Not worth anything," he answered.</p>

  <p>"But it must be worth something," Beatrice protested. "I only want a very
  little."</p>

  <p>Something in her voice compelled the man's attention. He looked at her
  white face.</p>

  <p>"What's the trouble?" he inquired.</p>

  <p>"I must get up to Fifth Avenue somehow," she declared. "I can't walk and I
  haven't a nickel."</p>

  <p>He pushed the brooch back to her and threw a dime upon the counter.</p>

  <p>"Well," he said, "you don't look fit to walk, and that's a fact, but the
  brooch isn't worth entering up. There's a dime for you. Now git, please, I'm
  busy."</p>

  <p>Beatrice clutched the coin and, almost forgetting to thank him, found her
  way up the iron stairs on to the platform of the elevated. Soon she was
  seated in the train, rattling and shaking on its way through the slums into
  the heart of the wonderful city. There was only one thing left for her to
  try, a thing which she had had in her mind for days. Yet she found herself,
  even now she was committed to it, thinking of what lay before her with
  something like black horror. It was her last resource, indeed. Strong though
  she was, she knew by many small signs that her strength was almost at an end.
  The days and weeks of disappointments, the long fruitless trudges from office
  to office, the heart-sickness of constant refusals, poor food, the long
  fasts, had all told their tale. She was attractive enough still. Her pallor
  seemed to have given her a wonderful delicacy. The curve of her lips and the
  soft light in her gray eyes, were still as potent as ever. When she thought,
  though, what a poor asset her appearance had been, the color flamed in her
  cheeks.</p>

  <p>In Broadway she made her way to a very magnificent block of buildings, and
  passing inside took the lift to the seventh floor. Here she got out and
  knocked timidly at a glass-paneled door, on which was inscribed the name of
  Mr. Anthony Cruxhall. A very superior young man bade her enter and inquired
  her business.</p>

  <p>"I wish to see Mr. Cruxhall for a moment, privately," she said. "I shall
  not detain him for more than a minute. My name is Franklin&mdash;Miss
  Beatrice Franklin."</p>

  <p>The young man's lips seemed about to shape themselves into a whistle, but
  something in the girl's face made him change his mind.</p>

  <p>"I guess the boss is in," he admitted. "He's just got back from a big
  meeting, but I am not sure about his seeing any one to-day. However, I'll
  tell him that you're here."</p>

  <p>He disappeared into an inner room. Presently he came out again and held
  the door open.</p>

  <p>"Will you walk right in, Miss Franklin?" he invited.</p>

  <p>Beatrice went in bravely enough, but her knees began to tremble when she
  found herself in the presence of the man she had come to visit. Mr. Anthony
  Cruxhall was not a pleasant-looking person. His cheeks were fat and puffy, he
  wore a diamond ring upon the finger of his too-white hand, and a diamond pin
  in his somewhat flashily arranged necktie. He was smoking a black cigar,
  which he omitted to remove from between his teeth as he welcomed his
  visitor.</p>

  <p>"So you've come to see me at last, little Miss Beatrice!" he said, with a
  particularly unpleasant smile. "Come and sit down here by the side of me.
  That's right, eh? Now what can I do for you?"</p>

  <p>Beatrice was trembling all over. The man's eyes were hateful, his smile
  was hideous.</p>

  <p>"I have not a cent in the world, Mr. Cruxhall," she faltered, "I cannot
  get an engagement, I have been turned out of my rooms, and I am hungry. My
  father always told me that you would be a friend if at any time it happened
  that I needed help. I am very sorry to have to come and beg, yet that is what
  I am doing. Will you lend or give me ten or twenty dollars, so that I can go
  on for a little longer? Or will you help me to get a place among some of your
  theatrical people?"</p>

  <p>Mr. Cruxhall puffed steadily at his cigar for a moment, and leaning back
  in his chair thrust his hand into his trousers' pocket.</p>

  <p>"So bad as that, is it?" he remarked. "So bad as that, eh?"</p>

  <p>"It is very bad indeed," she answered, looking at him quietly, "or you
  know that I should not have come to you."</p>

  <p>Mr. Cruxhall smiled.</p>

  <p>"I remember the last time we talked together," he said, "we didn't get on
  very well. Too high and mighty in those days, weren't you, Miss Beatrice?
  Wouldn't have anything to say to a bad lot like Anthony Cruxhall. You're
  having to come to it, eh?"</p>

  <p>She began to tremble again, but she held herself in.</p>

  <p>"I must live," she murmured. "Give me a little money and let me go
  away."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'll do better than that for you," he answered, thrusting his hand
  into his waistcoat pocket and drawing out a pile of dollar bills. "Let's look
  at you. Gee whiz! Yes, you're shabby, aren't you? Take this," he went on,
  slamming some notes down before her. "Go and get yourself a new frock and a
  hat fit to wear, and meet me at the Madison Square roof garden at eight
  o'clock. We'll have some dinner and I guess we can fix matters up."</p>

  <p>Then he smiled at her again, and Beatrice, whose hand was already upon the
  bills, suddenly felt her knees shake. A great black horror was upon her. She
  turned and fled out of the room, past the astonished clerk, into the lift,
  and was downstairs on the main floor before she remembered where she was,
  what she had done. The clerk, after gazing at her retreating form, hurried
  into the inner office.</p>

  <p>"Young woman hasn't bolted with anything, eh?" he asked.</p>

  <p>Mr. Cruxhall smiled wickedly.</p>

  <p>"Why, no," he replied, "I guess she'll come back!"</p>

  <p>Tavernake left the meeting on that same afternoon with his future
  practically assured for life. He had been appointed surveyor to the company
  at a salary of ten thousand dollars a year, and the mine in which his savings
  were invested was likely to return him his small capital a hundredfold. Very
  kind things had been said of him and to him.</p>

  <p>Pritchard and he had left the place together. When they had reached the
  street, they paused for a moment.</p>

  <p>"I am going to make a call near here," Pritchard said. "Don't forget that
  we are dining together, unless you find something better to do, and in the
  meantime"&mdash;he took a card from his pocket and handed it to
  Tavernake&mdash;"I don't know whether I am a fool or not to give you this,"
  he added. "However, there it is. Do as you choose about it."</p>

  <p>He walked away a little abruptly. Tavernake glanced at the address upon
  the card: 1134, East Third Street. For a moment he was puzzled. Then the
  light broke in upon him suddenly. His heart gave a leap. He turned back into
  the place to ask for some directions and once more stopped short. Down the
  stone corridor, like one who flies from some hideous fate, came a slim black
  figure, with white face and set, horrified stare. Tavernake held out his
  hands and she came to him with a great wondering sob.</p>

  <p>"Leonard!" she cried. "Leonard!"</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt about me," he answered, quickly. "Am I such a very
  terrifying object?"</p>

  <p>She stood quite still and struggled hard. By and by the giddiness
  passed.</p>

  <p>"Leonard," she murmured, "I am ill."</p>

  <p>Then she began to smile.</p>

  <p>"It is too absurd," she faltered, "but you've got to do it all over
  again."'</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Get me something to eat at once," she begged. "I am starving. Somewhere
  where it's cool. Leonard, how wonderful! I never even knew that you were in
  New York."</p>

  <p>He called a carriage and took her off to a roof garden. There, as it was
  early, they got a seat near the parapet. Tavernake talked clumsily about
  himself most of the time. There was a lump in his throat. He felt all the
  while that tragedy was very near. By degrees, though, as she ate and drank,
  the color came back to her cheeks, the fear of a breakdown seemed to pass
  away. She became even cheerful.</p>

  <p>"We are really the most amazing people, Leonard," she declared. "You
  stumbled into my life once before when I was on the point of being turned out
  of my rooms. You've come into it again and you find me once more homeless.
  Don't spend too much money upon our dinner, for I warn you that I am going to
  borrow from you."</p>

  <p>He laughed.</p>

  <p>"That's good news," he remarked, "but I'm not sure that I'm going to lend
  anything."</p>

  <p>He leaned across the table. Their dinner had taken long in preparing and
  the dusk was falling now. Over them were the stars, the band was playing soft
  music, the hubbub of the streets lay far below. Almost they were in a little
  world by themselves.</p>

  <p>"Dear Beatrice," he said, "three times I asked you to marry me and you
  would not, and I asked you because I was a selfish brute, and because I knew
  that it was good for me and that it would save me from things of which I was
  afraid. And now I am asking you the same thing again, but I have a bigger
  reason, Beatrice. I have been alone most of the last two years, I have lived
  the sort of life which brings a man face to face with the truth, helps him to
  know himself and others, and I have found out something."</p>

  <p>"Yes?" she faltered. "Tell me, Leonard."</p>

  <p>"I found out that it was you I cared for always," he continued, "and that
  is why I am asking you to marry me now, Beatrice, only this time I ask you
  because I love you, and because no one else in the world could ever take your
  place or be anything at all to me."</p>

  <p>"Leonard!" she murmured.</p>

  <p>"You are not sorry that I have said this?" he begged.</p>

  <p>She opened her eyes again.</p>

  <p>"I always prayed that I might hear you say it," she answered, "but it
  seems&mdash;oh, it seems so one-sided! Here am I starving and penniless, and
  you&mdash;you, I suppose, are well on the way towards the success you
  worshiped."</p>

  <p>"I am well on the way," he said, earnestly, "towards something greater,
  Beatrice. I am well on the way towards understanding what success really is,
  what things count and what don't. I have even found out," he whispered, "the
  thing which counts for more than anything else in the world, and now that I
  have found it out, I shall never let it go again."</p>

  <p>He pressed her hand and she looked across the table at him with swimming
  eyes. The waiter, who had been approaching, turned discreetly away. The band
  started to play a fresh tune. From down in the streets came the clanging of
  the cars. A curious, cosmopolitan murmur of sounds, but between those two
  there was the wonderful silence.</p>
